PhnomPencil	42	7	16	"That's not the official name, but in case anyone missed it, Google has put together NASA's Landsat images since 1984 to make a timelapse of the entire world. This is fascinating for both amateurs and professional geographers alike -- for some, as cool as the advent of MapQuest, Google Earth, and StreetView -- and I thought Reddit could share ideas for places we should view.

To reach the explorer, go to [Time's site](http://world.time.com/timelapse/), click ""Explore the World"", and in the bottom right panel you can search for where you want to go.

Cool ideas so far (can't be hotlinked yet but the search is easy):

* [RetroJoe](http://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/1e0mk5/timelapse_of_landsat_images_since_1984_for_the/c9vvtnn) recommended searching for **""Dubai""** and **""Singapore""**.

* [dvm](http://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/1e0mk5/timelapse_of_landsat_images_since_1984_for_the/c9w0qc4) recommends **""Three Gorges Dam, China""**.

* [Hallibutman](http://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/1e0mk5/timelapse_of_landsat_images_since_1984_for_the/c9w7pca) recommends searching **""Bucharest""** where you can see the demolition of the inner city in the late 1980s (more info [here](http://www.portmanteau.ro/index_en.html)) and the coast of China near Beijing... search **""Port of Tianjin""**.

* [RedditUpheaval](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/1e0u4y/time_watch_the_world_change_over_the_course_of/c9vrl5d) compares **""Las Vegas""** to mold growing on the planet.

* [Bazpinger](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/1e0u4y/time_watch_the_world_change_over_the_course_of/c9vxb5m) notes the difference at **""Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland""**, after the 2010 volcanic explosion.

Next year I would like to incorporate more hands on activities and projects and I have three questions for the undergrad, grad students, and professional geographers of reddit:

1.) If you could pick one specific skill from your specialty to teach to a high school student, what would it be?

2.)To you, what is the most important geographic skill/concept that a student, who will soon be a member of the general public, needs to know?

3.) What are your other ideas for teaching high school students? What sort of projects would you do? How would you avoid relying on worksheets/packets.

Okay, so that's more than three questions...

Keep in mind that high school students have a range of abilities and knowledge. Some come into World Geography not knowing the seven continents and four oceans. I have had students not be able to differentiate between North or South America or even be able to Locate North America on a map. Ideally, throughout the course of the year, students go from not being able to locate France to locating many countries and understanding concepts such as demographics, levels of development, economic systems, governmental systems, cultural diffusion, plate tectonics, etc.

Thanks!

I was looking at an exhibit showing maps of Russia, dating back to the middle of the 17th century, and noticed that pretty much all the maps spanning 350 years used a conic projection.  It makes sense, as a cylindrical projection would show quite a bit more distortion at higher latitudes.

As a result, Russia is quite rounded;  Alaska is typically shown on the top right, with the the Americas be flipped 90 degrees from what we would normally be used to on a typical Mercator projection.  Finland and the rest of Europe are shown similarly, albeit on the other side of the map.

This made me think out worldview in terms of cartography.  Growing up with the Mercator projection, the world is a rectangle in which we would explore the world as a series of blocks formed by perfectly parallel latitudinal and longitudinal lines.  The process of projecting a spherical shape onto a flat piece of paper, and the distortion is creates is something that I imagine is foreign to most children, and even many adults.

Do people that grow up with alternate projections see the world in a different light?  Do little Russian children look at a map and grow up believing that the USA is way up there in the far right corner of the map?  Is Europe far up there on the left hand side of the map?  If Russian children were to draw the world, would they draw it in a conical fashion, with North America being on the other side of the North Pole rather than being on the other side of the Pacific?

I am by no means suggesting that one way is better than the other; looking at the world in a conical sense might even be better (it saves the embarrassment of wondering why we are flying over Greenland to get to Europe.)

As the title has said, I am currently contemplating a career change into the field of Geography, as it has always been a great personal interest of mine (I love maps, and grew up with National Geographic magazines - sorry if it's too cliche).

As a failure and lack of research on my part before entering university, I wasn't aware of the career prospects that Geography could offer, and decided to keep it as my personal interest. I was also intimidated by the mandatory statistics courses I had to take for a B.A. Geography (barely passed) and I thought it was not my field.

Therefore I pursued and graduated in a B.A. in a humanities major instead (completely unrelated to Geography). I have 3 years of working experience, but it is not related to Geography at all (it's in the field of market research).

I have done a search in this subreddit and have gathered that GIS is where most of the opportunities lie, and from the job descriptions both from the GIS job sites, and what you guys have provided, it seems like an interesting field to me. 

I am aware of the necessary programs/ software that it requires (ArcGIS, AutoCAD, programming &amp; database management) and am willing to devote the time to learn those. I have also looked up Certificate Programs in GIS that are offered in my area and will be able to fit it in my working schedule as well.

My question is, for the ""academic"" part of the GIS field - is a ""Certificate in GIS"" good enough? Or would it be more advisable to do a B.A. in Geography AND the Certificate in GIS?

I've always wondered this but never thought to ask anyone. I've seen this but would like something more detailed.

Examples:

Clearly, when the Missouri meets the Mississippi, the resulting flow is in the direction the Mississippi had been heading; the Mississippi is wider at that point. It makes sense that it is the Mississippi river that continues from that point.

The Allegheny and Monongehela meet in Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River. However, from a map, it really appears that Allegheny is the ""surviving"" river of this - the Ohio continues the curvature of the Allegheny and the Mon appears as a tributary rather than an equal contributor.

Yet, when the Ohio meets the Mississippi, it is the Mississippi that retains its name even though the Ohio appears wider at the meeting point and the resulting path of the river appears to follow the direction began by the Ohio.

Is there an actual principal at play here? Or is it something more arbitrary? I understand that flow has something to do with it, but why doesn't the geography factor in, too? Or does it...?"	t5_2qnms	True

I've danced around a lot of majors but nothing seemed like the right fit. However geography is such a broad subject, it just seems so appealing. I first studied to be a pilot for a couple years but costs were too high and, again, it just wasn't the right fit. I did take a few meteorology classes and I analyzed a lot of maps and graphs, to which were some of my favorite topics to learn about during the course of my training. I have always loved maps, I probably could spend hours looking at maps. I think it would be cool to go into cartography. I used to draw pretend maps as a kid.  I really love learning about other countries around the globe. I hope to one day see Bhutan and Burma. Right now, I'm on track to major in math, to become a math teacher. My ultimate mission was to serve in the peace corps to teach math. I could still serve if  I minor in math. I would still really like to serve. I've taken only a couple of college level geography classes but I did enjoy them a lot. So am I just kidding myself with this illusion that geography is all about traveling maps and graphs?

He's obsessed with checking out places on Google earth and navigating the areas. What kind of books, maps, software, etc. could I get him for Christmas that a geography nut would like? He gets most excited seeing places he has been to and will squeal when he finds it on Google earth. I want to expose him to more because he's so excited, maybe a companion for Google earth. He's also into ""fact"" books like Guinness and Ripley's. He'a also really into pictures rather than text, so that would be better. Thank for the help. :)

EDIT: Thank you all for all the suggestions! I have a lot to look into now. We did do some geocaching last year and he loved it.

And please see my thread here: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/1hu472/some_very_interesting_socialparallels_running/

These findings support my original closer-to-the-equator hypothesis which I'm wondering has probably graduated from mere hypothesis to possibly being a theory or even a law of nature now. 

Now, is temperature the ***Cause*** per say? **NOT NECESSARILY** but for example, warmer weather, people are more likely to be outside, then more likely to be around each other, and more people being around each other which leads to more conflict. But even though temperature is not a direct cause in itself, this is evidence or proof of my ""the closre you are to the equator the crazier things are"" theory (possibly law now). 

If there are any serious / professional social geographers out there working in academia I would love to collaborate with one of you see if we can get some publications out of this. The evidence keeps piling up and can't be ignored much longer. Someone is going to cash in on this. I don't have the repuation within the field of geography so if any geographers out there are interested let's work together. "	t5_2qnms	True

1353453177.0	13ja7o	Writing a term paper. Geographic philosophy question	soundsofthedeep	15	2	4	"I'm writing my final paper for my political geography class (it's about Metal Gear Solid and how videogames impact geopolitical learning, in case you were wondering) and therefore I am doing some research into some conceptual frameworks before writing. I've been reading a few books and focusing on postmodern thought, I've come across some very depressing commentary, and I'm curious what you all think about it.

One man in the book, named Bauman, has asserted that in contrast to the 20th century, we now live in a world where all political institutions are inherently local in scale because the world economy drives the choices individuals make; politics is a function of economics rather than a parallel process. He goes so far as to say that no existing political agency has the ability to ""legitimate, promote, install, and service any set of values or any consistent and cohesive agenda"" for people, and that ""market pressures"" serve this role.

Sirwootalot	17	4	5	[Figured this would be the best subreddit to post these in](http://imgur.com/a/AfmCH) - I wanted to find out which states had the most extreme differences between hot and cold weather (I'd often heard my home state Minnesota is one of the most extreme places on earth in this regard), and couldn't find any maps; so I figured I'd do the research and make them myself. One is for the difference between the highest and lowest record temperatures in each state/province's history, the other is for the difference between average summer highs and average winter lows. I wanted to do all of North America for each of them, but found that reliable data was practically nonexistent for Mexico and Central America, and on a state-by-state basis I could only find yearly average highs vs yearly average lows (as opposed to overall yearly average) for the USA.	t5_2qnms	True

MrNecktie	13	3	9	"I'm currently an undergrad looking at the very long-term in terms of computing; I'm running Arc10 on a laptop pretty okay, but the lack of dedicated graphics hardware means that a lot of cartographics and rendering is slow.

I'm looking to get away with building a decent and cheap gaming rig in a year or so with a few teras of space and having it double as a working computer, but if there was some way to specialize it for geography, I would totally do that instead.

I ask this question now, and not on any other day, because I've been consistently referring to Australia as only an island in a discussion here on Reddit and I'm quite surprised that no one has made an attempt to 'correct' me. Now, I know calling Australia an island may be a moot point to some (those like me, who subscribe to the 5 continent view), but as far as I've encountered away from the computer screen most people are only aware of the 7 continent view.

I'm familiar with some of the discussion regarding the major tectonic plates and how they relate to the formation of the landmasses. However, using tectonic plates as a guide we are still left with Europe and Asia joined as a single continent for a total of 6 continents. The number of possible continents also drops considerably when you consider conjoined landmasses as continents. The lowest count I've seen for continents on Earth is 3, which just seems silly. This estimate considered Africa and Oceania to all be joined with Europe and Asia in a single continent which I thought was altogether strange.

They actually actually drove to where the magnetic north pole was in 1996. 791.16 miles from the actual actual North Pole, and a good 200 miles from where the magnetic Pole was back in 2005. Don't get me wrong; I'd be hard-pressed to make it there even the way they did (and I've had a lot more experience with extreme winter travel than them) but they could've at least mentioned the fact that when they said ""North Pole"" what they meant was ""Not the North Pole"".

I graduated with a BA in Geography (specialized in Environmental Science and Natural Resources) in 2010. I have worked the last two years as an Environmental Consultant but our project has come to an end. We used GIS software at times but I'm not knowledgeable enough to confidently apply for GIS positions. 

Having not been able to find work, I have decided to go back to school in August for GIS. The GIS certificate program would require 5 courses (20hrs total) and cost me about $8000. The courses are Intro to GIS, Computer Mapping &amp; Graphics, Remote Sensing in the fall semester and Advanced GIS and Applications of GIS in the spring semester. 

Money is a huge issue right now and not wanting to get further in debt from loans I'm considering to only take the Intro to GIS in the fall and Advanced GIS in the spring. This would save me about $5000. Only taking these two courses would give me GIS knowledge and experience but not the ""Certificate."" Is this a big deal during the hiring process?

I'll have 2yrs of work experience and 1yr of GIS courses. Should I save the $5k or take out loans to get the certificate?

I am currently studying Geography as an undergrad and I have an opportunity to get a research internship this summer.  I need to come up with a proposal for a project and if the department approves it, they'll give me a bunch of money to go off and complete it under the guidence of one of the professors.  It can be completed here on campus, or abroad (of course I want to pick a project which would take me abroad).  This is a real neat opportunity for me to get some valuable experience, to travel, to make some money and hopefully have some fun this summer.  Also the research can fuel my senior inquiry next year allowing me to get most of that done before my senior year which would be nice.  

Here is the problem; I have no idea where to start thinking of an idea!  I was wondering if any of you have been in a situation like this and could give me some pointers on forming a research idea.  I am not looking for project ideas but rather what the process is that you go through to come up with them.  I'd like to do something in human geography but that's all I have so far.

However, from the few schools I've looked at, most seem to require an undergrad degree in Geo or some other natural science. Is this fairly typical across the map (ha!) for Geo masters programs? Or is a bachelors degree in Geography or some other science necessary.

I am soon to be a Senior at the University of Delaware graduating with a double major in geography and political science  and a minor in computer science and I was wondering what my next steps should be in order to have success with finding a job and having a successful career.

I have taken a few courses in GIS and I've really enjoyed them and I plan to solely take them my senior year. Do you have any suggestions what particular courses I should take that would help me with my future in GIS? As in, what areas should I focus on? What programs should I become proficient in?

Also sadly the University of Delaware only offers a GIS certification for their graduate students, is there anyway I can get one somewhere else? Are GIS certificates necessary to get a job?

I also really enjoy policy work as well so do you have any suggestions about how I can combine my two areas of interest?

Also what general advice do you have for someone about to enter the Job market? Is there anything in particular I should do before graduation? Any other advice is welcome as well!

Thank you all so much!

I-Am-The-Hivemind	6	0	1	"Hey guys, I'm a history student attempting to delve into geographic history a bit more. I've recently completed reading Jerry Broton's *Trading Territories: Mapping the Early Modern World.* I find the work fascinating, as I'm sure some of you have as well. The text deals with the use of early modern maps as commodities in themselves for commercial and diplomatic exchange. I was wondering if anyone has encountered texts that address similar themes (particularly the exchange of
Geographic information as gifts) in other books or articles. The text was published in 1998 and I'm sure much has been done since then. I appreciate any and all aid in directing me towards similar works, as I have found it relatively difficult to locate any using keyword searches."	t5_2qnms	True
