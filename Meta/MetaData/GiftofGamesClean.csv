1369019992.0	1eo876	[Giveaway] Over 200 items to give away to you ungrateful bastards!	lowflyingmonkey	270	36	790	"So some of you might remember me, you're awesome, others might not, well i didn't like you either, but I used to give a bunch of item away here. Around xmas was kind of crazy for me both here and in real life and i ended up taking a hiatus. However, I am back and badder then ever. If you can read, I do question a few of you, I have over 100 individual items totaling over 200 if you add up all the multiple copies to give away this time.

I say items, not games, because some of them are not a single item, humble bundles for example, and in a few cases i have DLC not a game. I have many more if you want to count each individual game and DLC in all bundles and such.

So what do you have to do to get your greedy little hands on my booty? Naming me the king of the world would be a good start but i figured i would start smaller so here is what you do.

**What to do to win!**

Uno: I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and i will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

Dos : Name of the game(s) you want. [List here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop6s0TdK_vRdERnQmpCaFZZTTNiMmF5OHd6R0hvMnc&amp;usp=sharing) (you can only pick 5 items)

Tres: You have 20 minutes to live, what game would you chose to play? Why that game? We are assuming you have access to all games,(video, board, cards, ect) and something to play them on, and people to play with if need.  

For the lazy an easy to copy format

    1. http://steamcommunity.com/id/&lt;Custom URL&gt; or 
       http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/&lt;shit long number that corresponds to your account&gt;
    2. &lt;list of games you want&gt;
    3. &lt;answer to question 3&gt; 

**Rules/guidelines**

uno: I don't actually know Spanish and trying to speak to me in it will just confuse me

beta: Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

△:  The name of the game is entertainment. The more you entertain me the better your chances.

quad:  Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. Mingle, most people wont bite ... unless you ask. 

V: You agree to give me your ~~first~~ 12th born child ^^^(ireallydon'twantkids) 

3+3: I will give what I want, to who I want, when I want. AKA: You are not guaranteed anything, it is not first come first served, There is no true end point of the giveaway (unless i run dry)  and i will be giving games thru out it

Se7en: No i don't have to, and probably won't, give all 200 things away. They are all just up for grabs but not guaranteed to be given away. 

8:  You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported. If you can receive the game you can activate it.

8^(1):  Ok one expectation, if you ask for and win a humble bundle but have a game or two from the bundle already, and there are separate keys, you obviously can't activate those games, since you already have them, but in those cases i would like to request that you give back to the community.

Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post i get nothing for it. Thanks."	t5_2tb4r	True
1370456826.0	1fqj8o	[Giveaway][Steam]Hi, my name is lowflyingmonkey and I have a buying games and/or gifting problem. Just under 50 different games to give away this time.	lowflyingmonkey	232	26	1068	"So I am back with another, slightly smaller, giveaway. Took me a while to figure out what i wanted to give but i decided i wanted to clean out some of my keys.

So that is just what we are doing to do. 

[Here is the Google doc file of the games being given away](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop6s0TdK_vRdDZrbW9fbFRpTFNBZ0FZN0R2MklQZFE&amp;usp=sharing)

**I will need:**

1: Name of the game(s) you want. You can list up to 5 but you will most likely only get one. Order them from most wanted to slightly less wanted.

2: I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and i will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3: The game you are most looking forward to coming out, doesn't have to be soon necessarily.    
Or anything else you want to talk about that would be entertaining really. Just something spark a convo. So the more you say the better.
 
**RULES/GUIDELINES**

Pretty much same rules as last time. 

You are guaranteed nothing and the likely hood of all the games going are slim.

Unless the game are crossed out i still got them. I have multiple keys of many of the games. ( upwards of a total of 100 keys i think)

All keys are redeemable on steam.

Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

You agree to hand over all alcohol to me effective immediately ... i am out. 

The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain me the better your chances.

Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks.

You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported. If you can receive the game you can activate it.    
Because of the nature of keys I may need you to verify that you activated the game. 

Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks."	t5_2tb4r	True

___

~~I somehow ended up with over 500 copies/keys for over 100 games I already have or not interested in playing so I thought there might be someone who might actually want some of these so I looking for people to gift these to. I'm not gifting to anyone just because they ask so no one is guaranteed anything as mentioned above. Also, I will most likely look over brand new reddit accounts obviously created for the purpose of entering a giveaway.~~

~~If you are interested, comment and provide the following information:~~

* ~~The name of game(s) below that are interested in playing. Requesting multiple games is fine but they each should be something you actually want and you may not receive everything you ask for.~~

* ~~Provide reason why you selected the game(s). Including if you had game on your wishlist (prior to today)~~

* ~~Provide a link to your Steam profile so I can make sure you don't already have the game you are asking for if I decide to gift you. I would need to be able to see your game library to do so. A url/link must be provided or your comment will be skipped.~~

~~I will randomly review comments and gift as I please to whomever I want for any reason of my choosing. I will gift randomly for at least a week or so so offer is good until post is closed whenever I feel like I want to stop. I definitely will not be gifting everything.~~

~~If you receive something, gift must be redeemed/activated on your account within a reasonable amount of time, otherwise, you will be banned.~~

**Sorry if you did not winner, but you always have another day.**

**I will put up day two shortly.**



So i did this for the winter sale and i figured i would do it for the summer sale as well. I will put up one giveaway a day with the current daily deals.. I will then pick a winner(s) the next day and then put up the next days sale.

Day 1 daily deals:

    Bioshock Infinite
    Call of Juarez Gunslinger
    Antichamber
    Defiance
    Don't Starve
    Left 4 Dead 2
    Hotline Miami
    Endless Space Emperor Edition
    Scribblenauts Unlimited
    Toki Tori 2


**I will need:**

1. Name of the game you want. Pick one and only one game from the list.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. You can only play one game for the rest of your life, which is it? Why?

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

+ You are guaranteed nothing.

* There will likely be only one or 2 winners a day.

* I will be honest the more expensive the game is the more you will have to work for it.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months or have at least a combined total of 500 karma (link + karma)

* You agree to be spied on by lowflyingmonkey and all subsidiary accounts. All incrementing information will either be collected and used for blackmail or auctioned off to the highest bidder. You are welcome to bid on your own information.

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see the line before this for reasons why. 

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.  

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!"	t5_2tb4r	True
1376668512.0	1khskn	[GoG] Free Magicka on steam for everyone who signs up for Wizard Wars alpha after enough people sign up.	erikossie	179	14	30	"http://signup.wizardwars.com/

When more and more people sign up for Wizard Wars free alpha certain tiers are unlocked, the first two are in-game items but the third and so far final tier gives everyone who has signed up Magicka free on steam.

I can't of course guarantee that it will reach tier 3 but it is at least worth trying. If you already have a Paradox account you can sign up immediately and otherwise you have to create one, it's very quick and only sends one conformation e-mail to you. As far as I know you don't get any newsletter as it gave me the choice to sign up for it after confirming. Signup is of course 100% free :)

1373697230.0	1i7g23	[OFFER] Civilization IV	LongDevil	163	16	187	"So, I like many others that bought Brave New World got a free copy of Civ IV. Since I have and love V, I'm not likely to play it, so I listed it for trade for a Darksiders 2 Season pass. A random stranger saw my thread and gifted me not only the DLC from the Season Pass, but all of the other DLCs as well. I felt compelled to pay it forward with my copy of Civ IV.

If you'd like a chance to win it, please upvote this post, pick a number between 1 and 256, and tell me that you'd like to play it.

good luck.

Edit: I will pick a winner some time tomorrow evening.

Edit 2: the winning number was 136. andyman11 won with 137. Sorry to the other 2 people that picked that number, he picked it first."	t5_2tb4r	True

1370908251.0	1g2yqd	[OFFER][Steam] I still got keys I want to give away! About 40 total different games!	lowflyingmonkey	148	15	899	"So I am back with another, ever growing smaller, giveaway. 

I am still wanting to clean out some of my spare keys. I ended up giving 15 out in the last giveaway [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1fqj8o/giveawaysteamhi_my_name_is_lowflyingmonkey_and_i/) but I still have lots of keys, total of about 83, spread over a total of about 40 different games.

Lets see what we can do to get rid of some more.

[LIST OF GAMES HERE!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Amy_v6ca-axZdHAtcDZ5aVFFQ3RweG5xXzd6NUdDZlE#gid=0)    

* I am using the same list as last time    
+ If the game is struck thru i no longer have it. 
- If it is not stuck thru I should still have it.

**I will need:**

1. Name of the game(s) you want from my list. You can list up to 5 but you will most likely only get one. Order them from most wanted to slightly less wanted.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. What is your favorite gaming moment. (This can be something that scripted and you can enjoy every time you play the game. To something caused by a bug or by other players and so was more of an one off moment.) As always other things to talk about is always welcomed as well!

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

* Pretty much same rules as last time. 

+ You are guaranteed nothing and the likely hood of all the games going are slim.

- Unless the game are crossed out i still got them. I have multiple keys of many of the games.

* All keys are redeemable on steam.

* You agree to give me your ~~left~~ right kidney if I ever need a new one. I will name him jim-bob the movable!

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see line before this for reasons why. You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation.

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.  
Because of the nature of keys I may need you to verify that you activated the game.

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!"	t5_2tb4r	True

Since I'm a big fan of Humble Bundle I bought a BTA bundle even though I already had a couple of the games. Since it's one Steam key for both, one of y'all lucky bastards is gonna get ~~both games~~ Dead Island GOTY and the Saint's Row the Third DLC. **The DLC requires the base game to play, it is not included in the key** (thanks to Chimperilur for pointing that out. If someone wins and doesn't have the base game, I'll add a PWYW gift for the base game.) Said lucky bastard must have a reddit account at least 4 months old. Said lucky bastard must also do the following:

1. Upvote this post, so more potential lucky bastards will see it.
2. Pick a whole number between 1 and 512.
3. Correctly format a link to their Steam profile, cos I am lazy.
4. Tell me about your favorite single player game and why it's your favorite. Please avoid spoilers. Don't just write the name of it either, at least write up a sentence or two. I reserve the right to disqualify overly succinct answers.

I will pick a winning number sometime tomorrow evening. Winner will be chosen by closest number without going over, kinda like the Price is Right but without that giant wheel to spin later. Good luck.

Edit: 125 is the winning number. Aburritogun wins with 123. Thanks for playing y'all, and for the good single player recommendations. "	t5_2tb4r	True

I believe he has created new Reddit accounts with new Steam accounts. Becareful about gifting brand new users with brand new steam accounts.**

**Steamtrades account:**

**This user was found to be farming games on /r/GiftofGames and /r/RandomActsofGaming, using alternate accounts in the same giveaways, as well as trading some games he received and did not activate on Steamtrades.com. As a result he was banned on /r/GiftofGames and /r/RandomActsofGaming.**

His accounts were only used to get games with posts mainly in giveaways and for games requests. Additionally, he was deleting his posts and comments to hide his activity and typically, he left comments in giveaways still open.


**Although I banned him from /r/GiftofGames, he continues to waste my time by making new reddit accounts and post here to farm games from the community. Since I cannot stop him from doing this I would have to recommend blocking his Steam accounts in Steam by clicking on the ""block all communication"" link under the actions on his Steam profiles.**

This will not prevent him from getting Steam keys from the community using new accounts but at least this will make you aware of him and if you have his Steam account blocked, you won't be likely to gift him directly in Steam.

**Please upvote for exposure.**

I have picked a page out of my inventory to give today. That means there is 25 games are up for grabs

[Picture of the games here](http://i.imgur.com/nvr1pn4.png)

I am not going to individually list each one but if you can't tell what one of them is or have a question about one let me know and i will answer as best i can.

^(One i do what to mention though is oblivion, it is GOTY but it is not GOTY deluxe. Which means it doesn't have all the DLC if i remember correctly. Why they have two different GOTY is beyond me x-x)


**What i need**


1. Steam ID in link form please, and by please i mean mandatory.

2. Games you want. List up to 3

3. 
    1. What is your favorite game to mod and what are your favorite mods to use? Links would be lovely. =)
    2. What game would you most like to be able to mod that you currently can't?

**Rules/Guidelines**

* You are guaranteed nothing.

* I do not have to give all the games away.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 6 months.

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see the line before this for reasons why.

* Contrary to popular belief my sweet roll was in fact not stolen, i ate it.

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!

So i did this for the winter sale and i figured i would do it for the summer sale as well. I will put up one giveaway a day with the current daily deals.. I will then pick a winner(s) the next day and then put up the next days sale.

Day 4 daily deals:

1. Name of the game you want. Pick one and only one game from the list.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. Yesterday we did live in which game world, so today lets do if you could be any game character who would it be? Why? You are that character with any of their abilities and talents and all that but you are not immortal. You can still die you don't have responds or multiple life. You are not in a game you are just that character. So choose wisely.

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

1371227830.0	1gchpd	[Offer][Steam]And i am back once again! I've still got more keys i want to get rid of.	lowflyingmonkey	80	5	572	"So here I am again. I still have more keys that i want to get rid of. I am finally down to just under 70 from about 100 when i started. 

I ended up giving 18 out in the last [giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1g2yqd/offersteam_i_still_got_keys_i_want_to_give_away/?limit=1500) and 15 in the one before [that](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1fqj8o/giveawaysteamhi_my_name_is_lowflyingmonkey_and_i/) but I still have lots of keys to give, total of about 67, which are spread over a total of 36 different games.

Lets see what we can do to get rid of some more.

[LIST OF GAMES HERE!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Amy_v6ca-axZdHAtcDZ5aVFFQ3RweG5xXzd6NUdDZlE#gid=0)    

+ If the game is struck thru i no longer have it. 
- If it is not stuck thru I should still have it.

**I will need:**

1. Name of the game(s) you want from my list. You can list up to 5 but you will most likely only get one. Order them from most wanted to slightly less wanted.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. Describe your own perfect game. What game mechanics would be involved, what setting or mix of settings, etc. What is your Villain like? Do you even have a villain? Your main character. Does your ""perfect"" game already exist? What is it? Is there anything you would change about it even if it is your ""perfect game? If so, what? Why? 

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

* Pretty much same rules as last time. 

+ You are guaranteed nothing and the likely hood of all the games going are slim.

- Unless the game are crossed out i still got them. I have multiple keys of many of the games.

* All keys are redeemable on steam.

* You agree that by making a request that you grant lowflyingmonkey LLC full ownership over any and all ideas in your post and any following posts in this thread.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see the line before this for reasons why. 

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.  
Because of the nature of keys I may need you to verify that you activated the game.

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!

1372885311.0	1hlbph	"[GOG] PSA- PM'ing a user, adding on steam, and ""begging"" or ""harassing"" them for a game..."	Shrimplet596	74	11	38	"I'm almost disappointed that we need to talk about this.  We are a strong community filled with great people.  But I guess that with the great, comes the... not so great.

First things first, When we as mods receive a message from you We do our best to respond about the matter.  If you or another user you know is being hassled, report the user (or comment) and feel free to PM us.  Brextn is an amazing mod and handles things very efficiently.  I myself am still learning but am developing the right mindset for courses of action.

With that out of the way, we have a few KEY ISSUES to talk about here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. PM'ing a user/gifter

* This, unless stated ok by the gifter/redditor should overall be a big N.O.

I've only given to this sub and I myself have never had this happen to me, though I'm sure some of you aren't so lucky (depending on the game you're gifting).  If somebody PM's you begging/harassing you, EXAMPLE:  

""hey Redditorsname123,

You should give me that game because I REALLLLYYY want it""  

Or

""Yo redditorsname123,  You're a jackass for not gifting me that game, You and Otherredditorsname are friends and you're a faggot!""

**Screenshot their message, if possible get us there steam ID as well so that we can better monitor the user, and PM us with that information**

We, today, recieved this message **Edited for privacy**

&gt; Since doing my [removed] giveaway, I have received several messages through reddit and one person even added me on steam to ask if i could gift them a copy. This is very discouraging to me and annoying. I would certainly hope this kind of behavior is frowned upon in this subreddit, but I just hoping that we could make some sort of PSA regarding this. I'd make it myself, but i don't want to explicitly single out the people who did this. To be honest, after getting these messages (that seemed like begging to me), it makes me not want to gift anymore.

It's quite harmful to the community to behave like this.  ""finding"" their steam and harassing them on there for a game?  That's just low, and is VERY much so... Not allowed/appreciated here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

B. Begging a user for a game/harassing them for not winning a game.

I've already touched on this a bit but again, if you see somebody being rude;

* ""You know that redditor, You two are in on this together to get gift/recieved tags!""

or the comments that are so frequently removed from [Offer]s and even [Request]s...

*[offer]-*

* Hey OP! If you still have that game I'd LOOVE it if you could give me one too.  c'mon... please?  I only have 1 game and i'm new here and have no money""

*[request] (commented to somebody saying they'll gift the OP of the [request] the game)*

* ""hey man, could I get one too? Or if OP doesnt respond can i get THAT copy?!  (repeat poor and no game shtick)""

Again, If you see things like this, do the following.  

**A.** Report the comment or screenshot the PM.  

**2.** If possible, get their steam ID.  

**and D.** send the Steam ID to us with either the screenshot of the PM, or a permalink to the reported comment. 

This will allow us to deal with the situation faster.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, This isn't directed to the majority of our users because you're all (for the most part since the above situations DO happen) brilliant.  You all are, really...

But this has to stop.  When a user says; 

&gt; it makes me not want to gift anymore.

It's a sad day here, because, even if you ARE the problem... You pushed away another chance to ""OMG GET A GAME FOR MaH L1BR4RY!""  -__-

Please, for the sake of this sub, Be kind to eachother... and treat others as YOU would want to be treated...

Thanks for reading this all, and please upvote for exposure.

^(Ps... If you're waiting for flair, don't post here... I know.. I've been slacking... I'm getting to them now.  My apologies...)

*edited for formatting/spelling*

^(also, It's safe to assume any and all downvoters are those who we do not appreciate in this sub)"	t5_2tb4r	True

1375966804.0	1jyb62	[GOG] A VISUAL rules post. Updated as needed.	Shrimplet596	73	9	60	"**[Visual for HOW TO POST CORRECTLY and SAFELY](http://i.imgur.com/hEMFHBk.png)**

* *When giving a game, please note: You DO HAVE THE RIGHT to enact further restrictions.  Link or comment karma, Age, games owned, activity; etc; etc;   As long as your requirements do not LIMIT the rules, but exceeds them (you can increase, but not DECREASE or lower the requirements past our set standard) then it is OK for you to do so.*

**[Visual for HOW TO UTILIZE and ORGANIZE.  Use to ONLY SEE [Offer] [Request] OR [GoG] posts!](http://i.imgur.com/jsdfKCA.png)**

**[Visual for HOW TO CLOSE YOUR POST and TIMING/RULES ON REPOSTING](http://i.imgur.com/ZpI5KfS.png)**


**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**

New Rules!~

* Coupons, expiring betas, trials, and overall 'free to the public' games or otherwise do NOT count for Gifted or Grabbed flairs. You may give these away and are still required to submit flair request for cataloging, but they will not be assigned flairs.


* If you make a [Request][PC/Steam] or comment on an [Offer][PC/Steam], you **MUST include your STEAM ID.** Keep in mind, the Person MAKING the [Offer] is not required to publicize their ID, only those wishing to receive a gift are.

 * *Your profile must be LINKED (not just a type out of your name) in the post. And your Steam Profile should not be private.  If you see somebody with a private profile, Proceed with caution. (no need to report, but again, proceed with caution)*


* An active reddit account with a valid history, meaning if you frequently delete your posts on any sub, you're unwelcome here, with an age of 2+ months is REQUIRED to post any [Request] or comment on any [Offer] here. Through Mod permission, they may still be permitted.  

 * *The one GIVING the game still has the choice to increase this requirement for their own [Offer] or Givewaway.*


* Begging, PM'ing a gifter, or commenting on anyone else's [Request] post asking for a game is **STRICTLY forbidden.** Multiple offenses will result in a ban without appeal.  If you are begged or see it happening, Screenshot it, We NEED their steamID, and send it to us mods.



* After receiving anything here from /r/giftofgames, you are REQUIRED to post a [GoG] thanking your gifter. This is for proof, as well as cataloging. If you do NOT post a [GoG] Within 24 hours of receiving the game, you are eligible for a temp ban.  Repeat offenses will result in possible banning.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Remember,*  Please hit the report button and then message the mods if you see any suspicious behavior.

* Do not try to farm games here or get games you already have. Do not try to get games here to sell or ""trade up."" Attempting to get around any of the limitations just said will result in a permanent ban and constant watchful eye looking out for you. We also have people in every major giveaway subreddit, as well as we use a shared ban list with those subs, so we will hear if you attempted to do so in another sub too.

As a small side note, if anyone likes what I'm posting, could you upvote the offers even if they have expired? This is ONLY because last night I was sometimes facing a (30 minute?) Reddit-imposed delay on posting because ""your posts haven't been doing too well"" :(

So a couple of upvotes should hopefully keep me posting and get a lot offloaded by midnight GMT.

**Edits where made to winner list since one winner would be out of town not be able to accept the gift.**


So i did this for the winter sale and i figured i would do it for the summer sale as well. I will put up one giveaway a day with the current daily deals.. I will then pick a winner(s) the next day and then put up the next days sale.

Day 7 daily deals:
       
    Grand Theft Auto IV
    Dead Island Riptide
    Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition
    Fallen Enchantress Series

3. What's are the best 1-3 optional features that make you want to play a game? Things which aren't expected to be in the game.

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

+ You are guaranteed nothing.

* There will likely be only one or two winners a day.

* I will be honest the more expensive the game is the more you will have to work for it.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months or have at least a combined total of 500 karma (link + karma)

* Under the new rule of LFM all citizens are now expect to report to the state run fair grounds for relaxation and fun!  
^(All reports of torture and interrogation under the fair grounds are false and you should stop spreading lies before I take you for interrogation!)


* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see the line before this for reasons why. 

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.  

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!"	t5_2tb4r	True

1. Upvote for visibility

2. Tell me which of the two games you want (either Red Faction: Armageddon + Path to War DLC **or** Darksiders)

1363577912.0	1ai6i8	[Offer] Crysis game giveaway!	Dark2099	65	9	83	"I have 8 copies of the original Crysis game for X360/PS3 (4 each), so it's time for a fun little giveaway. Let's be honest, don't go posting if you already have the game. Keep in mind that this is a downloadable copy, so make sure you have space!

I ask for two things as an entry: The name of your favorite underrated game, and your console of preference (the one you would be using the code on). 

I will pick people via random number, and will be checking for multiple entries. Codes will be given out Friday, March 22nd.

edit1: Some upvotes for visibility would be great, the more the merrier! 

edit2: These codes apparently include some Crysis 3 'Hunter' bonuses as well, if you have that game.

edit3: As Rlolt has pointed out, codes may be region locked. Being in North America, it's possible these may not work elsewhere.

edit4: Poor choice of wording, when I said console of preference I meant the console you would like the code for. I will assume the answer would be one and the same, but if not, update your reply!

edit5: Winners have been randomly selected and should be seeing codes shortly. Congrats ChoobChoob, eternitydragon, ericbanh, Xeon117, Admiral_Yelly, stinkyrobot, Cantzon, and DaDosDude.
If they don't work due to a region restriction as mentioned above, you have my apologies. Let me know and I will pass them on."	t5_2tb4r	True

1363016838.0	1a34ob	[GOG]Public Service Announcement: Not everyone with a huge list of games on their Steam account is a rich b*st*rd trying to get free games off people.	OmegaX123	66	9	34	"I've noticed a lot of [REQUEST] posts getting blatantly ignored, and even downvoted (even though the downvote button is, last I checked, disabled on this sub). The only explanations I can think of are either people think downvoting/circumventing the system will reduce the poster's chances of getting the game they want/increase their own chances of getting a game, or they're going to the poster's Steam account, seeing more than 10 games, and saying to themselves 'this guy/girl has money, why does he/she need free games from us?'

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE**. Thanks to subreddits like this, randomactsofgaming, playitforward, websites like PlayBlink, and just friends who want someone to play games with, it is entirely possible to have a huge Steam library without spending one cent.

Just thought I should remind people of that. Not only in response to my own requests, but the requests of quite a few other people I've seen on this subreddit."	t5_2tb4r	True

As with the other days, as money and time permits, I am going to do an giveaway every day. There will be 1 or 2 winners for each day. The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day eight's daily deals:

Lego lord of the rings

xcom enemy unknown

Worms franchise (multiple non bundled deals inside please pick one)

L.A Noire

FTL

Counter strike franchise (multiple non bundled deals inside please pick one)

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be one of the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Give me your Steam ID link.

3: Favorite present/gift you have ever received, and why it was your favorite.

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: [Any gold that you find is now mine!](http://images.wikia.com/phineasandferb/images/5/5c/Old_Coot_-_cropped.jpg)

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

Congrats to them. I will be putting up day 9 shortly.**



So i did this for the winter sale and i figured i would do it for the summer sale as well. I will put up one giveaway a day with the current daily deals.. I will then pick a winner(s) the next day and then put up the next days sale.

Day 7 daily deals:
       
    
   Torchlight 2    
   Farcry 3     
   Garry's Mod     
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3     
   Sim City 4: Deluxe Edition     
   ~~Infestation: Survivor Stories AKA: WAR Z~~ Not available     
   XCOM: Enemy Unknown     
   Magicka     
   Euro Truck Simulator 2    
   The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing      


**I will need:**

1. Name of the game you want. Pick one and only one game from the list.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. Best co-op game? If you want to separate them then, Best co-op local game? Best non local co-op game? Explain why.

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

+ You are guaranteed nothing.

* There will likely be only one or two winners a day.

* I will be honest the more expensive the game is the more you will have to work for it.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months or have at least a combined total of 500 karma (link + karma)

* If you pick WAR Z/Infestation: Survivor Stories, you will be ground up and feed to pigs.

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see the line before this for reasons why. 

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.  

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!"	t5_2tb4r	True

1375588774.0	1jnwli	[OFFER] The game you missed out on during the Steam Summer Sale that you will put a lot of hours into playing	MaximumDan	61	9	173	"So we all know that /r/GiftofGames gets very busy when there's a sale on, especially the Steam Summer Sale.  During this time, I'm sure that many requests were overlooked due to the sheer number of request posts that were coming in each day.

I usually prefer to fulfill requests rather than putting up offers because I believe someone requesting a specific game is more likely to play it than someone entering a giveaway with the hopes of winning whatever's on offer.  

So, I am offering a second chance draw for those who missed out, however my offer is one with a difference.  I have a number of items to give away, but I'm not going to divulge which ones - only to say that most of these were on offer during the Steam Summer Sale (one in particular is often requested but rarely gifted)

If you're unsure if the game you want is on offer, ask for it anyway.  If I have it in my inventory and you meet my criteria, I will consider it.

So what do you need to do?  Simply tell me why you want the game and convince me you will put many hours into it.  Is the game on your wishlist?  Have you asked for it previously?  What can you tell me about the game?  These are some of the things you may want to cover as part of your post.

I'd also recommend reading my [guide to getting gifted](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1jnw0k/gog_maximumdans_guide_to_getting_gifted/) to get an idea of what I (and perhaps other gifters) look for when considering requests.  Reading it will very likely increase your chances here.

This time I will be giving away 3-5 games, possibly more.

Winners will be announced within 12-24 hours.

---

Terms &amp; Conditions

1. You must have an *active* Reddit account 2 months or older

2. Your SteamID must be included in your post (preferably as a link)

3. Giveaway items are for personal use only.  Winners must activate games immediately upon receiving them.

---

Thinks to be aware of

1. If your post history consists entirely of requests and giveaway entries, you are unlikely to be chosen.

2. There is still an element of luck involved - even if you make an excellent post, your chances are higher but you still may not win.

3. I do not respond to unsolicited PMs regarding game requests.  Any such PMs will be ignored and reported to the mods.

Good luck!

EDIT #1  

Thankyou to everyone who posted here, there are some great posts and I have read them all.

At the time of writing this paragraph, 23 hours have elapsed since I first posted the offer.  

Since then, there have been 162 replies.  18 people confirmed that they have read my [guide to getting gifted](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1jnw0k/gog_maximumdans_guide_to_getting_gifted/) in its entirety, so I would like to extend a special thanks those people for taking the time to read my other post.  I regret that I can't give everyone something in addition to my thanks.

I am going through all the responses now and will be updating the list of winners shortly.

---

EDIT #2

Congratulations to:

* kaizan23 - Skyrim
* bleedgr33n - Civ V Gold Edition upgrade
* Xemeriba - Kerbal Space Program
* timmaaykush - FTL
* Jfaz1 - Kerbal Space Program
* Tictacjo - Dark Souls™: Prepare To Die™ Edition
* Phaedrus0230 - Bastion
* Coolboypai - Borderlands 2


Let me conclude by saying there were a LOT of great posts here, some I would have liked to fulfill but do not currently have what they've asked for.  On the flip side, there were some rather poorly written requests too.  Those who read my [Guide to Getting Gifted](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1jnw0k/gog_maximumdans_guide_to_getting_gifted/) would know that I always overlook short 2-3 line requests, and there were a few of those here.

But overall, these were great to read.  Thanks to everyone for participating. 

Until next time :)

**Congrats to them and thanks to everyone that entered.**

Mostly same shit, different day.

As with the other days, as money and time permits, I am going to do an giveaway every day. There will be 1 or 2 winners for each day. The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day five's daily deals:

Endless Space

CAll of Duty: modern warfare Franchise

Company of heroes franchise

Mass effect Franchise

Sonic Franchise ( this is a deal with more then one item, that are not bundled, so please pick one from inside it.)

Of orcs and men

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be one of the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Give me your Steam ID link.

3: Your favorite game no one has ever heard of. While i get ""nobody"" is kind of subjective in this context do truly try to give games that are obscure. Games like bastion and limbo everyone knows even if they haven't played them. It does not need to be a video game. All games count no matter how they are played. Video,flash, board, pen and paper, games you played as a child, ect. If it is called a game you can put it here. Also links and deceptions of the game would be very nice too so i can learn about them. Names alone don't help much. List multiple ones if you want.

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: In the case a deal with the devil is needed, you agree to be my go between so nothing bad happens to me. All positive effects though are still transferred to me.

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

There was an overwhelming amount of people that responded, but only one guessed the correct number. I added the person as a friend on steam and gifted the game. I checked his steam profile today and i noticed that he hasn't even started the game once. I assume there where some people that responded that really wanted to play the game, and i think it is just dickish to receive a game, and not show the slightest interest interest in playing it afterwards.

Well in case you haven't heard THQ is no more. They filled for bankruptcy a while back and parts of them have been sold off, though waiting approval, and soon will be no more. If you want to read more you can go over to this thread on [/r/games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1754pz/thq_shuts_down_studios_sold_off/). I find this very sad since I believe THQ was a good publisher and actually enjoyed what they did and cared about the customers, unlike some other publishers. I have decided to give away some of their games in honor of there closing down. I hope to see some of these franchises in their new homes doing as well as ever.

**This is what i got:**

Darksiders II

Darksiders Franchise Pack

Saints Row: The Third

Homefront

Metro 2033

Red Faction Armageddon

Red Faction Guerrilla

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl

Warhammer 40K: Space Marine

I even have some THQ humble bundle gifts.

If you ask really nicely, and give me a good reason, i might even buy a THQ game off the store, but don't count on it.

**This is how you get:**

1: I need your steam ID, preferably in link form.

2: Pick 3 games you want

3: Tell me what your favorite THQ game is and why.

4: Tell me what you think of the companies that bought the studios/franchises/publishing rights of THQ and how good or bad a mix they will be. ( You do not need to do each individually a general answer will do but feel free to say as much as you would like because i like discussions.)

**Rules:**

I do not have to give all games away.

For any reason i can chose not to give away a game.

You will activate your gift right away after receiving it.

Dogs &gt; Cats

Ali-sama gets all the hugs. Don't ask, just do.

Your Reddit account has to be older then a month.

I will choose winners some time tomorrow based on what ever reasoning i like.


**Let the giveaway begin!**

1374428149.0	1irc25	[GOG] MY official end of the summer getaway sale. Thanks for being part of it!	lowflyingmonkey	55	11	50	"So as some of you might know I decided not to finish the summer sale for a multitude of reasons. Allstar decided to finish day 10 for me, which I thank him highly for, but with day 10 coming to an end I think it is time to officially end it. With the last day or so being only the encore day, and we have done the 10 getaway games that have cards based on them, it just seem right.  Thanks everyone for coming out and joining in the fun. I had fun and learned some interesting things in the process! I have some games i need to check out now too. 

Over the 10 days I ended up giving about 23 game. Which i am very pleased about, even if my wallet isn't xD. 

No I am going to rest my poor poor wallet who is more damaged then i thought. 

Once again thanks everyone for helping make it a great giveaway.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Never played it, Own it, but never played it.  ANYWAY

HI, want it? yea, Thought so.

please, in a comment, post your steam ID, social security, and drivers licen-...wait...wait no that's my, ""steal your identity"" routine. **IGNORE THAT**

hah, ok, so you want the game?  I have aquired 10 copies **[PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/A4gJNue.png?1)**

And I want to give them away to you all :D

Why did I do such a thing?  I sold a ""MTG Foil, Liliana Of The Veil"" card on ebay for $130 - S&amp;H and want to do something more then mod on this sub this month.

so **ANYWAY AGAIN** ^(damn, i'm hyper...), if you want the game, I want your firstbo- fuck.  lost my train of thought again.

*sigh*

I want to whore myself out on my twitch to help get views...OK!? there, i said it.

I won't post it here though as I don't want to be ""THAT"" guy... But if you'd be interested in watching me play games, I do so every tues/thurs/fri.  estimated times of 10am-4pm Central Standard Time.

If you want to win the game, Comment. Post your Steam ID, And that's it...

**These are not requirements, just things that will, from smally to GREATLY, increase your odds of being chosen. (5Months+active on reddit, Steam must have at least 5 other games (non free) to increase chances.  steam account must also be over 8 months old)**

Add a sob story, add a pic, add a thanks, add whatever. idc, I'm just going to randomly select people over the ~~next couple of hours~~ next day to give these to.  Anyway, enjoy.  and if you'd want to watch me stream on twitch...PM me asking for the link.  I wont be live till tomorrow but, hey... why not. :D

ok guys, I'm done here. 

**GO!**

*EDIT: I'm going to go play some league in a few with my buddy, It'll be live, but not planned, just a casual fuck around.   I will give out the games tomorrow, either before I live stream, or after I stream (I want to give as many people a chance to get the games as possible as I don't do these types of things often...)  Thanks everyone.  I'll be back later tonight to respond and converse with you.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**EDIT2:** So some of you have been asking what I stream.  well, my MAIN thing was Binding of Isaac (not pro, but fairly good at the game) And minecraft (total knob and makes an ass of myself quite often in single player).  I've done others though... starting up LoL for live stream.  Working on getting multiplayer games a habit... Such as Worms Revolution, Castle Crashers, Trials, and others...  If you want to see the games I own, [here's my library](steam://openurl/http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shrimplet596/games?tab=all).  If you want to see the games I stream, PM me for the twitch link, or youtube link.  (again, Not posting it here as it has no real effect on if you win the game or not).  

alas, it's 11:50pm, and i'm tired as hell.  I'll return in the morning before my live stream at 10am, then (MOST LIKELY) either during a break, or at the end of the stream i'll come back again and do the ""winners"" post. :D

Thanks again for coming out guys.  Can't wait to see some of [your reactions](http://i.imgur.com/NXOFVHO.gif) **IF** I choose [you](http://macromeme.com/cat/your-majesty-owl.jpg) or [you](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1dtpt2/offersteampc_just_cause_2_on_sale_374_ill_take/c9tw4ok?context=3) :P

(**Take note, awareness/mention of you doesn't mean you're any closer to winning a game then the others, just means I felt the need to show people your humor/splendor in asskisserey :P haha**)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*EDIT3: So I've ""chosen"" my top ten random picks.  Don't be discouraged though... These choices can change as I haven't contacted any of them yet as I'm waiting to see if somebody who I feel should have the game more should arise.  Going live very soon, PM for the link.  I'll be chilling and lobbying up with randoms games now, Undecided what I'll be playing when the REAL stream actually starts at 10am (Central Standard Time).*"	t5_2tb4r	True

The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

The amazing Spider-Man.

castle crashers

hotline miaim

deadlight

batman arkham city: goty

magic the gathering 2013

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be one of the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Give me your Steam ID link.

3: Tell me your top 3 movies. They do not need to be blockbusters.

That is all the information I need from you.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: You agree to make me your king.

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

..

If interested, you must have time to play the games and you are expected to finish each game by completing the single player story and see an ending. If interested in the story, you could play on Easy if you want to to make things easier. 

..

I am thinking this should be done by the end of 2 months which I assume should be reasonable and enough time for someone to complete the story mode of 3 action/fps games. 

..

Please do your research on the games and franchise to make sure the games are something you would play and enjoy. Also be sure your computer meets the minimum requirements to play these games.

* The person selected for this offer will first receive **BioShock 1** to play. While playing, I would like you to take screenshots through your journey in Rapture. You don't have to take hundreds of screenshots but maybe two - three per ""level"" and anything interesting you encounter. After making to the end and watching your ending, please write any recommendation on Steam for the game and I will then gift you  **BioShock 2** to play. 

* Play **BioShock 2**. Continue taking screenshots of your next journey in Rapture. After completing Bioshock 2 and watching your ending, please write any recommendation for the game on Steam and I will gift you **BioShock Infinite** to play.

* Play **BioShock Infinite**. Again, take screenshots during your new adventure in Columbia. After completing BioShock Infinite and watching the ending, please write any recommendation for the game on Steam. As an added bonus for completing the franchise within 2 months, I'll gift you a **BioShock Infinite Season Pass** so you may continue enjoying more of what BioShock Infinite has to offer when the 3 DLC content get released.

**This offer is not for you if you do not have the time for this. You will need to play to receive the games.**

So, as soon as they get me up to date.  I'll be dealing with these issues head on, daily, so please, be patient.  Don't halt your efforts to get your well deserved flairs, but just know that I'm just starting, and I'm here to help.

I have QUITE the bit of off time so do not be afraid to message us with questions.  I'll do my best to respond as will the other mods.  I still have a few questions of my own, but they are slowly answering themselves if not being answered by fellow mods.  Night all.  I look forward to serving you with ample dignity and pride. :D

* to my understanding there are DOZENS... Maybe hundreds of you who haven't received a flair, not including constant new updates.  my schedule is tied at the moment and I'm doing all i can off my mobile.  Tuesday I will begin an overhaul of missing/due flairs.  So please, while i understand your grief as the whole reason I'm a mod is because i noticed this problem with times/responses...

1. Name of the game you want. Pick one and only one game from the list.

3. Completely unrelated to the other questions, what makes you get up in the morning.

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

+ You are guaranteed nothing.

* There will likely be only one or two winners a day.

* I will be honest the more expensive the game is the more you will have to work for it.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months or have at least a combined total of 500 karma (link + karma)

* **Rabbits are to be trusted.**

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool, stick around you ungrateful fucks. No really stick around it ups your chances by like ten fold, see the line before this for reasons why. 

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations, violator will be reported.  

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great, it's a self post so i get nothing for it. Thanks!"	t5_2tb4r	True

Same shit different day.

As with the other days, as money and time permits, I am going to do an giveaway every day. There will be 1 or 2 winners for each day. The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day three's daily deals:

Train Simulator 2013

Dungeon Defenders

Dead Island

Dota 2

Blood Bowl Franchise (there is 2 different games in this one that are not a bundle please pick only one)

Dawn of war franchise

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be off the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Tell me your steam ID

3: Show me your favorite video. It can be about anything at all and can be as SFW or NSFW as you want it to be. Just label it if it is NSFW.

That all the information i need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: You agree to give me your first born.

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

I really just want to thank you all for being able to come on here and share your stories (some of which were very personal). I am seriously glad that some of you were able to use this as an outlet, as I know there was a time when I had no one I could go to to talk about things in my life, and I really REALLY hope that some of you guys got use out of this, besides just as an opportunity for games. I wish I could keep this thread going just to see what some people would post, and just to give away more games and spread more joy. Who knows, maybe I'll do this another time. Until then, though, thank you everyone for everything and anything!




Here's the way this offer will work: if someone asks for a five dollar game and wins, then I won't stop there. I'll find another winner and also give them a game. My plan is to keep gifting games until i'm all out of my money. Here's the thing though, I recently went through a life changing experience with my church group, and what I'd like to hear is all of your life changing experiences, for the better or worse. So here's what I'd like you to put in your post.

1) A number from 1-10,000

2) Your most life changing experience (If you don't have on yet, then there's no shame in that, I was the same before this week, so just put N/A if you don't have one)

3) Your Steam ID

4) Your favorite GIF, cause why not?

**Edit**: Forgot to also say I will pick the winners tomorrow morning.**(Added On Edit)**: ~~I'm gonna have to start gifting games tonight instead of tomorrow morning, seeing as a lot of people are requesting games that will no longer be on sale tomorrow, which I probably should've thought of~~. **I** keep changing my mind which I am sorry for, but I'm just excited to be gifting some games, so I'm gonna start gifting games every hour or so, now. I'll be choosing people by randomly generating numbers on a website until I get a number someone picked. I also just want to hand out a HUGE thanks to all of you guys for sharing your stories. I've seen some posts thanking me for giving the games and all, but money is just money. A lot of you guys have shared some stuff that's really deep and personal, and I want to thank you for being able to do that in front of all of these strangers, whether it's in person or not.**Another Edit:** Here's some advice for anyone out there who plans on doing this in the future. If you do the number thing; don't make it go up to 10,000. Holy nuts this is going to be a while before I even pull someone's number.

**SUPER IMPORTANT EDIT**: I feel so stupid for forgetting the most obvious part you should include! A GAME! INCLUDE THE GAME YOU WANT PLEASE!"	t5_2tb4r	True

*EDIT*
Hi Guys - I'm a little late but I'm back!  Wanted to be sure I read every story, and there's some great ones in here.

Alot of these stories really hit home with me - especially those that brought back memories of my first time playing/beating pokemon, but alas one winner can be chosen and that person is...

ImNotAnAlien!  I will be shooting you a PM sir.


---------------------------------------------------
For anyone curious - I think my most memorable (single player) gaming moment was back when I played Metal Gear Solid 1 for the first time.  I had never played a game where I got into the story so much, and was playing through it right up to the part where you are supposed to get ""Meryl's CODEC number from the back of the CD case"" 

...What?  What CD case?  I just got a CD from the DARPA president it must be on that right?  nope.  
Well then I must have missed an item along the way.  I went back and retraced my footsteps searching for a CD I must have missed.  I searched for probably a couple of hours and finally got exceedingly frustrated and gave up.

The next day I decide to give it a try again.  I picked up the game to throw it in my PS1 and looked at the case... THE PHYSICAL CD CASE.  IT WAS RIGHT THERE ON THE BACK OF IT.  I must be a complete idiot right?  I was flooded with excitement of being able to continue the game.

My mind was kind of blown at a video game breaking the 4th wall like that (and for those that are familiar with the game, it wasn't the first time re: Psycho Mantis).

Anyway - I played through the game and it's still one of my favorite games of all time.  Again - for those familiar with the game I got the ending when you submit to torture... Right in the feels.  I remember staring blankly through the whole credits and when it was over... I started a new game with the stealth cammo.

Unfortunately, there are users (including banned users and several users using alternate accounts) who lurk and post in our subreddit trying to take advantage of your generosity and will attempt to add you and impersonate the person you want to gift to get the game from you before the actual recipient has a chance to respond to you.

As a giver, if you need to gift someone thru Steam, you should have recipient verify their Steam account thru their Reddit account either in a reply or PM if they did not previously provide their Steam account in a post or comment.

**tl; dr Ask for Steam profile link if not already provided and needed to gift.**
___


Also, not everyone's Steam profile name is the same as their Reddit username and it is easy for someone to change their Steam profile name to match someone else's Reddit name to impersonate and scam a free game from you.

There has also been a case where a gift was stolen from an impersonator who changed his Steam profile name on an alternate/newly made Steam account to the Steam name provided by the recipient, added the giver, and pretended to be the recipient and received a game.

The recipient did not provide a link to their Steam account and only a name which made it easy for someone to impersonate and made it difficult of the giver to find the recipient's Steam account.

**tl; dr Easy to change Steam profile name to pretend to be another Redditor; not everyone's Steam profile name is the same as their Reddit Username.**
___

When providing Steam account info, it is recommended that you provide an actual link to your Steam profile to insure you can be added easily. Make sure the link also works.

If you provide only your Steam account/profile name, it can be difficult for someone to find and add you to gift you because dozens of other people may be using a similar name. If you only provide a Steam name and not a link, try to see if you can easily search and find yourself on Steam since you are expecting someone to do this if they want to gift you.

If a giver can't find you or it takes a loft of effort to do so, you may have lost out on a potential gift. 

**tl; dr Provide a working link to your Steam profile to make it easier to add and gift you.**

**Congrats to them i will be notifying each of them individually shortly.**


Well shit i slept half the day. Let day 7 begin, i will pick day 6 winners shortly.

Mostly same sit, different day.

As with the other days, as money and time permits, I am going to do an giveaway every day. There will be 1 or 2 winners for each day. The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day Seven's daily deals:

Natural selection II

 Legend of grimrock

spec ops the line

arma II

the sims 3

the walking dead

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be one of the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Give me your Steam ID link.

3: You can have one super power, which is it and why. Though your super power can't be to have all powers. Yeah you know who you are. &gt;.&gt;

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: We all agree that the friend who said he had ""all powers"" was a dick. Even if we are still friends with him. 

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

Now there are a few things you have to do.

1) Steam ID must be left in the comments so I can see whether or not you own the game because if you do, then you're out of the drawing because I need people that never own the game.

2) You can leave anything on the comments.

3) If you're interested, check out my other request and upvote both this and my request (http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1k5epl/request_groupees_complete_doujin_bundle/). This allows me to see how popular it is. More upvotes will attract other reddit users. Last time I check I was at 3, which is cool.

Good luck guys!

Don't forget that you will need to pay it forward after winning the prize. So either posting thanks or giving a $5 amazon giftcard to the gifted will be good enough. As they say there are other fish to deep fry. I may give out more copies.

Okay this thread is closed. I will message shortly the additional winners. If someone can please send to me by email the doujin bundle, then you will get Garshasp and a bonus game as well. My email is GameDemonKing@yahoo.com"	t5_2tb4r	True

I'm actually in the process of getting a 2nd and hopefully 3rd job (2 full times and an at home job) to help with my bills/debts.

- but shrimp, you're still active in posting comments and submitting crap to other subs... And what about the other mods?

Well, I can't speak for the other mods, I know brextn handles more of the rule and ban watching, which is quite the task of it's own... And Ali does what he can when he can, but he's busier then me on most occasions it seems.

As for myself and my posting... I do it from work off of my phone.  And I can't provide the necessary quality checks and validate each request from my phone as it's format wouldn't work right.  Submitting posts and comments are one thing but flair assigning is an entirely different method that usually comes down to the use of 3+ Windows at any given time.  Can't exactly do that EFFICIENTLY on my phone while dealing with customers at my work.....

I try getting things together on my days off, but then family, or work, or an interview comes up and I lose track of time.  Hell, if I end up getting these other jobs I may have to resign as mod because I'll have no time for my duties here.

I've said it to some of you before... but I'm going to say it again with more warning...

I'm off after Monday around 3pm central time... till Tuesday around 5pm... I will do my best to catch up on flair requests in that timeframe... not impossible, but I have a phone interview RIGHT after work on Monday at 3:30 and depending how that turns out I may or may not have time Tuesday at all to get to flairs... in which case Wednesday the tenth I'll be getting my study material for the exam I need to take within a week (by the 17th) for the online job... so if I can't get time to do flairs before Wednesday.... then I have no response for you guys and girls... =/

I'm sorry, I really am... before money issues reared it's head I was for the most part on top of flair distribution.... but the last couple weeks have been hard and I'm trying to pick up the slack in my life... that's all I can say.

You can continue to message mods about flairs... I encourage it honestly...but there's no promise with how busy all of us are normally on when we can get to them.

With my most earnest regards

I just spent an hour and a half removing stuff to clear the modqueue. Most of it was from here. Which means a few things. 

A.) Things are being reported. That's good. ***But*** this is a hassle and a half when people abuse it. I will not remove things for being offensive to you. If someone is harassing you, then please, report it and use the modmail too. If it breaks the rules, report it, but please also modmail us with a link and what rule it breaks, as it saves us time. 

B.) Things are getting caught in the spam filter. It happens, it's natural, not a whole lot we can do.

C.) The biggest problem of all, ***USERS STILL AREN'T FOLLOWING THE RULES!*** I will remove any and all requests that do not include a proper ""[Request] [Console] [Platform] Title"" format. I will also remove requests and contest entries for not being old enough. This subreddit gets overrun by low quality posts at times, and I will not put up with it.

2. **Do not PM gifters asking for copies of games or requesting a game.** I've already received a couple reports of this going on. This is a BANNABLE OFFENSE. That's right kiddies, we're playing hardball now. GO BIG OR GO HOME RIGHT?
**If this happened to you recently, drop us a mod mail with a screenshot of the PM.** 

3. **Do not mass downvote comments in hopes that you will win.** That's dumb and immature. If you see this happening in threads, please upvote those comments to return the balance.

4. **Request flair as soon as possible.** If you don't request flair and I find out, we're going to have a serious discussion on why you're banned from the subreddit. Flairs are in place to prevent farming of games and identifying which users are selling/trading games. When you send a flair request, I kindly request that you also include a photo of the game activated and in your library if you are the recipient. For gifters, a simple screen shot of the PM of the key being sent or the window showing the gifted game will do.

5. **Stop making multiple request threads of the same game in less than a 24 hour time span.** It's spammy. I will delete all your request threads if I see this happening and give you warning. 


That's all for today.

Do upvote post for visibility since the subreddit is moving very quickly with the influx of requests.


**Obligatory TL;DR Do bad things and you will be banned.**

I always try to keep my requests under $10.Why not ask for something smaller, I know there are quite a few bundles with good games for good prices. I know that if someone is asking for BioShock infinite, that I won't even look at it because its such a ridiculous request. And for the case of asking for things like the killing floor bundle, why not just settle for Killing Floor or if you own it and wanted the DLC, why not just get a DLC?

Same shit different day.

As with the other days, as money and time permits, I am going to do an giveaway every day. There will be 1 or 2 winners for each day. The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day four's daily deals:

ANNO 2070

Saints row: the third

Super Street Fighter IV

Chivalry: Medieval Warfare

Carrier Command: Gaea Mission

Portal Bundle

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be off the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Tell me your steam ID

3: Tell me your favorite TV show, or the one that everyone needs to watch at least once. You may list more then one if you want.

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: You agree to name your children after me.

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

..

Only request this game here if you seriously want to play this game and have the time to play it in June and July. With the sequel, PAYDAY 2 coming out in August, now is the time to get in on the action. Please do some research, check out videos, read about PAYDAY 2, etc to make sure this is a game for you and something you would like and play.

..

I'm not expecting 20+ hours devoted to this game or that you play this everyday. I do, however, expect you to put in at least 4 hours play time in the beginning of June to find out whether you enjoy this game and want more of it or not. 

..

It is fine if after playing a few hours you realize this is not the game for you and you want to stop playing this game. However, if you enjoy the game and expect to play the game more and want more content to enjoy, you may message me and let me know you will continue playing and I will gift you the **Wolfpack DLC and Soundtrack** which adds more content for you to enjoy.

..


If by the end of July, you are still interested in PAYDAY, have devoted at least 10 hours of play time in PAYDAY The Heist, earned some achievements and you want to continue the action in PAYDAY 2, I will gift you a **PAYDAY 2** pre-order copy on the date the game is released.

___

**~~If you are interested in making a request for this offer, please provide the following:~~**

* **~~Link to your Steam profile~~**
* **~~Reason why you want PAYDAY The Heist~~**
* **~~Link to an article or video you read or saw for PAYDAY The Heist or PAYDAY 2 that you found interesting or liked.~~**

**~~I will pick 3 requests by June 1, 2013 and gift the users PAYDAY The Heist.~~**

* **1st Pick: /u/LycaNinja** has been gifted Payday the Heist + Wolfpack DLC + Soundtrack
* **2nd Pick: /u/morroblivion** has been gifted Payday the Heist + Wolfpack DLC + Soundtrack
* **3rd Pick: /u/gorillamunchies** has been gifted Payday the Heist + Wolfpack DLC + Soundtrack

**If you receive PAYDAY from this offer, I do expect you to put in at least 4 hours of game time in June. Do not make a request if you do not have time to play this game.**

For the 3 users selected for this offer, you may ask me for the Wolfpack DLC after 3-4 hours of playtime in June if you plan to continue playing the game. If you continue playing after that and end up devoting at least 10 hours of playtime and earning some achievements in PAYDAY by the end of July, you may ask me for PAYDAY 2, and I will gift you a preorder copy of PAYDAY 2 on the date the game is released.

[I already have the copies ready](http://i.imgur.com/sACEieY.png) so if you are picked, just play and you can receive the DLC + Soundtrack and even PAYDAY 2.

So I bought 3 packs, for $10 each, and figured I'd give them away here. (Only 2 SR3 keys because I gave one away to a friend).

I also have a mystery game I'm giving out. You'll found out what it is when I pick whoever shall receive it!

As I did with my last offer, to make it a little interesting, if you want one of the keys, let me know specifically what you're after, and also tell me who your favourite game character of all time is, and perhaps why they're your favourite. Doesn't have to be the hero of the game, or even the most main character. Just your favourite video game character ever. I'll give it 24 hours, and distribute keys then.

Edit:
To clarify guys, the THQ bundle is **one** Steam key that gives you all the games in the bundle. If you already have any of the games in the bundle, you don't get a spare copy. So I can't give away a single game in the bundle or anything. That being said, if you have one or two games in the bundle, don't feel like you can't ask for it!

1352927903.0	1379no	[Announcement] Looking for a new mod or two!	Cyali	26	1	17	"Hey everyone! 

Firstly, sorry I haven't been around much lately; I'm up to 4 jobs now on top of classes so it's been rough haha. I know the other mods have been pretty busy with real life as well, so we're looking to add one or two more to our team to help us out.

The main thing we're looking for is someone to help upkeep the Google Docs spreadsheet that keeps track of items that have been given and received.

If you're interested in applying, simply answer the following 3 questions. You can just reply to this thread, or if you prefer you can send a [message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGiftofGames).

* Do you have any previous experience as a community moderator, either on reddit or another site? If so, what subreddits/sites?

* Will you be able to spend at least a 20-30 minutes each day updating the spreadsheet?

* Anything else you'd like to say about why you should be chosen?

The main responsibility of this person (or persons, if we pick 2) will be to keep the Google Docs spreadsheet updated. We'd also ask that the new mod(s) check the spam/report queues whenever they log on, and approve anything that's not spam and remove/approve reported threads as appropriate.

Additional responsibilities would include assigning flair, keeping an eye on posts in the subreddit to make sure they follow our [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/o38o8/gog_general_posting_guidelines), answering mod mail, and banning people when necessary, as time permits.

Not being familiar with Google Docs isn't a dealbreaker; we'll show you how to edit it and everything.

If you'd like to apply, post below or message us by the end of the day Sunday ([Central Standard Time](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/central-time)). We'll pick someone shortly after that.

We also ask that you upvote this for visibility. (No karma is given for self posts.)

-------

Edit: Also, just an fyi for everyone, I'm going through the backed up flair requests, so hopefully that should all be updated over the next week. If you don't have your correct flair by next weekend (11/24-25) just send another flair request please. Thanks!"	t5_2tb4r	True

1375588154.0	1jnw0k	[GOG] MaximumDan's guide to getting gifted	MaximumDan	29	7	19	"Let me begin by saying that this is not an official guide and does not, in any way, guarantee that your request will be fulfilled.  It will, however, increase the chances that your post will be noticed (at least by me), and getting noticed is the first step to getting gifted :)


*""More what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules."" - Captain Barbosa*


---


* 1.  Don't be a stranger.

An active, established Reddit account is one of the basic things I look for.  Your account should be *at least* a few months old and have some post history.  *Active* is also a key word here.  I've seen accounts that are a year old and have very few posts.  It's fine if you choose to be a lurker, but don't come out of the woodwork just to ask for things.  

It also helps if you provide a link to your Steam account in your request post to make it easier for gifters to find you. 


* 2.  Give and take.

You should probably give something before you get something.  Things you can give do not necessarily need to be of monetary value.  Reddit is a big place.  Check out other subreddits, contribute to discussions, *give* some advice, *give* an opinion or wish someone well.  I'll always check a person's post history before I consider fulfilling a request, and these are some of the things I look for.  

Also, don't make a habit of of asking for things all the time.  I've seen some user accounts that consist *entirely* of requests and giveaway entries.  As a general rule, if a user's number of request posts and giveaway entries makes up more than 50% of their total posts, I will ignore their request and go to the next one.

If you want to receive from the community, be an active part of the community.


* 3.  Less is *not* more.

We often see request posts that consist of only a few lines and, in some cases, no text at all.  Most of these request posts are far too short to convince me, as a gifter, to look at them for more than a minute (which is probably about the same amount of time it took for someone to write them).  If you're asking for a game, I want to know (in some detail) *why* you want it, why you can't get it yourself and why I should gift it to you.  No need for a sob story, but a good explanation would suffice.  At the very least, put up a small paragraph detailing your reasons.  I'd recommend constructing your request by covering things like why you think you'll enjoy the game, what aspects of the game appeal to you, have you played any similar games, if the game is part of a series have you played any of the others, is the game on your wishlist and how long have you had it on there?  Put a bit of time and effort into request posts so yours doesn't look like every other 2-line request on here.


* 4.  Game on.

If you are fortunate enough to win a giveaway or have a request fulfilled, you should take the time to play the game you were gifted.  This should really go without saying, however I have checked some people's 'grabbed' history and have seen some gifted games that go unplayed (or have very little playtime on them).  If I gave away a game and the recipient put little to no playtime into it, I would be rather disappointed.  I am sure other gifters feel the same.  I'm also going to sneak the word 'coffee' in here to see if people actually read this far, and if you are entering my giveaway use it as part of your request, but don't make it obvious, so I know you've read this.  If someone has a 'grabbed' flair and they've put up a request for another game, I would advise all potential gifters to check on the play time of their previously grabbed game(s).  Nobody wants to waste a gift on someone who's not going to get much out of it. 

If you are gifted a game, play it for a while before asking for another one.  A person's number of 'grabbed' games does not factor into my decision to gift them a game, nor does the overall number of games in their Steam library.  What matters more is if they have put a significant amount of playtime into their previous grab and if they have thanked their previous gifter.


* 5. Wheaton’s Law.

Look it up, know about it, follow it. :)

If you get gifted, remember to put up a post thanking your gifter.  It doesn't cost anything to give thanks, it lets your gifter know that you appreciate their gift and it lets the mods know your request has been fulfilled.  When I search a username on /r/Giftofgames, I expect to see a number of 'thanks' posts equal to the number of their grabbed flair.


---


Again, to re-iterate - following this guide does not, in any way, guarantee that your request will be fulfilled.  You may meet all these criteria and still not get gifted, or you may meet none of them and your request could get fulfilled anyway (just not by me).   

Please do not reply to this post asking for games, this is not the place for it.  But feel free to reply to add to the discussion.


Thanks for reading :)

NB: I do not respond to unsolicited PMs asking for games.  Any such PMs will be ignored and reported to the mods.

1375472697.0	1jl17o	[GoG] Bit of a Poll, not official - A rules change, what would you add/change/do and why?	Shrimplet596	27	3	73	"Now, there are things that we as the mods need to fix for clarity and for efficiency of the sub.

And while there are rules that we've begun to enact but have yet to post  **I** ^(meaning just me, I haven't confronted the other mods on this post) would like to see what you the community would like to see changed or added.

* To be added/already enacted-  Guess passes, temp beta's, TRIALS, coupons, and other ""free to get"" of the sort items do not count for a Gifted flair, or a Grabbed count.

* Possible to add- Require a steamID link for any [Request] post, or [Offer] comment to help simplify the tracking of accounts and verifying fulfilled requests/offers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**EDIT**: I never said the person MAKING the [Offer] Had to post their ID in the post.  Just that those who comment on it are required to.  Same for those who make [Request] Posts.  It would be required for the gifter to know those who are looking to ""grab"" a game, but not required for those looking to ""grab"" a game to know the gifters ID.  This also would mean it wouldn't be IN FLAIR. But without a Steam ID in your [Request] Post, or in the comment for the [Offer] you're trying to receive, it would most likely be removed due to spam/rule breaking.

* How do you feel about adding a required reddit age limit, and activity check?  Same for steam.  That 9 month old reddit with no active postings or comments would be ruled out, and that 2 year old steam with 5 games and a ""time played this week"" of .01 hours would be ruled out because it's obvious they don't play the games they have.

Things like that.  What would you the community like to see/have this sub add/change.

~ If you want the bundle choose a number between 1-700

~ If you want Shank 2 choose a number between 700-1000

**[hawks214](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/158o27/giveaway_steam_daily_deal_sale_day_2/c7k856u) and [Xyreon](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/158o27/giveaway_steam_daily_deal_sale_day_2/c7k86yq)**

**I will be notifying them shortly and then putting up day 3.**



So here the deal, as with the day one giveaway, as money and time permits I am going to do an giveaway every day. There will be 1 or 2 winners for each day. The winners will get a game off the daily deals, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day two daily deals:

**Tom Clancy's franchise** (there is more then one game in this daily deal make sure you pick one from it. **Also see rule 0 please.**)

**Psychonauts**

**F.E.A.R**

**Simcity 4**

**Dishonored**

**Darksiders franchise** (there is more then one game in this daily deal make sure you pick one from it.)

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be off the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Tell me your steam ID

3: Show me your favorite picture/gif. It can literally be about anything and can be as SFW or NSFW as you want it to be. This is to keep me entertained while doing this.

That all the information i need from you.

Rules:

**0: A special rule for day 2, i can not afford the tom Clancy franchise pack since it is 60 dollars. However, any of the individual games in that daily deal can still be entered to win. It is just the complete pack i can not afford.**

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: You agree to relinquish your soul to my custody.

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

Let me get this out of the way. I'm NOT rich, in fact you can call me poor. My nice side (which is apparently big) took over. I regret nothing.

It all happened yesterday when I saw a SR3 request. After hitting up with the guy I found out I was 3 min late. Then it started. He told me he had a friend new to steam and he would like the game. If I didn't already put it in my innovatory, I would have still given him it. 

So I gave his friend: GTA 4 w/EFLC, SR3, and Bioshock 2.

I felt bad for the man who requested SR3 in the first place so I gave him:TWD w/400 days, TES:S Dragonborn, and (recently) Borderlands 2 season pass.

I had fun gifting so I did it again. I saw a nice redditor that requested SMB. I gifted him that and: Bastion, Rouge Legacy, and Castle Crashers (sorry I forgot any other games) All of those games was on his wishlist, causing his wishlist to be empty.

I did it again. This time giving SD. When we where talking I couldn't give him the game because it was in my innovatory (I was on mobile app) so I sent him Castle Crashers (it was on his wishlist) 

And the last gift I sent (as of now) was something special. I call it ""The Birthday To Remember"" (pretty cheesy) but a brother wanted to give his brother a b-day gift. The gift was Garry's Mod. If you didn't catch on, u gave him and his brother more. They both got Counter-Strike Source. 

I felt more happy then I ever did gifting these games. Thank you!

EDIT:I forgot 1 more thing. I gifted a another redditor TWD:400 Days. I need to fix that to make it so I gifted him 2 or 4 games.    

EDIT 2: Another redditor added me as a friend just cause, and I couldn't help but gift him a game. I asked him what he wanted, he said Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 (I'm pretty sure that's what it's called) so I gifted him the collectors edition. I forget stuff easily...

EDIT 3: I HAVE BAD MEMORY. I gifted a redditor which is in my steam friends list GTA 4 w/EFLC because it was in his wishlist and I gave the redditor which was only given 400 days (I'm sorry) Payday: The Heist (it was the only thing is his wishlist)

I get all the games for the winners from tremorgames. (a website where you play games or complete surveys and offers to get points to put towards steam games, desura games, amazon cards, xbox live cards, etc.)


**So if you'd like to help me have more giveaways in the future all you need to do is sign up through my referral** link:http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=25092


**After signing up through my referral link, you can help me by completing offers or playing games to get coins for yourself** :) 

**If you plan on joining tremor games and need help. Head over here:**http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/167x0i/gog_answers_and_help_for_tremor_games/


**Now, I NEVER require you use my referral link. That wouldn't be right at all. So if you'd like to check out the site and sign up without helping me, here's the link:** http://tremorgames.com 


I hope I don't sound too pushy with the website. It's just that I've discovered it recently and it's helping me out with giveaways for you guys. :) So I'm trying to recommend it to all of you who just like me, can't afford every game out there and need an alternative way. :)

1355889450.0	1539rq	[GoG] Warning against gifting /u/TheDancinOat aka /u/Pipboy111	brextn	25	4	69	"**DO NOT GIFT /u/TheDancinOat aka /u/Pipboy111**
His Steam account: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040576530

/u/TheDancinOat is an alt account of /u/Pipboy111 who was banned for attempting to trade a game that he was gifted here in /r/GiftofGames. He made a request for any game and a kind user gifted him a game but he had not intention of playing the game he received even though he asked for anything. If he didn't want anything he should not have requested anything and should have asked for a game he actually wanted which he could have received.

He made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1536j4/requeststeam_its_my_birthday_may_i_have_some/) requesting any game because it is his birthday. He asks for anything but the last time he asked for anything, he was only trying to farm games to trade so if he gets anything he doesn't want he'll probably just trade it away for something else. Any gift is wasted on this user and he only appears to ask for anything so he can use the gift to trade and probably not play it if you isn't really interested in it.

I would recommend going to his Steam account http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040576530 and ""block all communication"" to avoid adding and gifting this user in the future should he return to /r/GiftofGames with a new account. 

___


It is the season for giving and with the Winter Sale coming up, there will be a lot of requests and more people willing to give.  While there are many people deserving of gifts for various reasons, please be aware that there are scammers present trying to take advantage of your kindness so I would advise to look over their Reddit and Steam accounts (if giving a Steam game) for anything unusual before gifting.

Ultimately, gifters have the right to gift anyone they choose for whatever reason they choose and however they choose. Who, what, why, and how you gift is up to you, so if you don't care who you gift to, it is ok too. Give to whoever and however you want. I am only providing my own suggestion if you want to make sure your gift doesn't go to waste. 

Certainly games you received for free or in $1 bundles or those you just want to get rid of aren't worth much to you so it doesn't matter too much who you give to, which is understandable. First come, first serve offers are totally fine if that's how you want to give. 

However, if you're giving away something substantial or worth a lot, I'm sure you want to make sure the person you give to actually wants the game and will play and spend hours on the game to make it worth giving them the game. 

So you may consider reading some posts/comments by the Redditor to make sure they seem like someone you'd like to gift to and that they are active and contributing members on Reddit and not someone here for free games or here for a day and never heard from again once they get their game. 

There's no fool proof way to identify scammers but I would recommend having your own minimum criteria what to look at when giving if you're looking for someone who is deserving of your gift. 

___


**Link a screenshot showing you blocked this user or anyone on the Shared Ban List (like someone banned from /r/giftofgames) in this thread and I will enter you in a raffle to win a copy of Don't Starve. This will show me you read, are aware of the shared ban list, and know one way to look out for scammers. (If you already have this game, I'll give you another game of equal value that you don't have.) I will choose two winners randomly sometime this Friday/Saturday.**

winner #1: /u/Detekzette42
winner #2: /u/Bubbadog12
___

If you actively give here, I would suggest checking the [shared ban list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdHdyS0dQMnRSY01HVWYzSldTaGowbXc#gid=0) and blocking all communication with the steam accounts of known scammers to prevent gifting these users who may continue to make requests with new accounts. There's no quick way to block everyone so at the minimum, check the list from time to time and block new scammers and in particular, those banned from /r/GiftofGames.

When you look at the Steam profile of blocked users, it will show that you blocked them which will be a red flag to you that they may be a scammer and someone you should not gift or someone you don't want to deal anyway with since you may have blocked them for other reasons. Of course, scammers may create or have alternate Steam accounts so you may still need to be cautious gifting Steam account that may look suspicious. 

Note, not everyone has been banned for scamming. See their ban reason then determine whether or not you would like to gift them. Other reasons to be banned include bad behavior and trolling, repeatedly not following the sub reddits rules, etc..


Be cautious when receiving or asking for PMs. Banned users from /r/giftofgames cannot post here but may still send PMs and some users may still lurk for chances to get free games from giveaways where gifters asked to be sent PMs or post game keys publicly.

If you believe someone may be a scammer or trying to scam games here, please report post and/or message the mods with any links or info so we can review and keep an eye out on the user.
___

**EDITS**

**I know long post so I decided to giveaway more of my left over keys if you're interested** which I'll randomly giveaway since you took time to read this post I hope. You just have to post which key you want from the list below and don't have to block anyone if you don't want to.

*This giveaway is separate from the Don't Starve giveaway so asking for a key will not affect your chance of winning Don't Starve and vice versa. You must provide a link showing you blocked someone from the shared banned list by Friday to be entered in the raffle for a copy of Don't Starve*

Minimum requirement is an active Reddit account at least month old to prevent people creating new accounts to get a game in a giveaway. Asking for more than 1 key is ok but don't try to be greedy or you might not get anything and I would suggest mentioning why you are asking for that specific game. 

If you already posted something here, please make a new post if requesting any key below. Just post which one you're interested in for a chance to get it. **I will give these out on Sunday so this giveaway is open until then. Note that even though you may be the only one requesting a specific key, it does not guarantee you will receive it and I may not give out all keys from what I listed.**

**EDIT: With Winter Sale going on, I'll just start giving away so it doesn't get in the way of your purchases. There were multiple requests for certain games but if I only had one, there could only be one winner. If someone else got what you requested and feel free to request something else if you want.**

1353734545.0	13pb08	"[Announcement] Rules updates, warnings policy, and 
flair updates"	Cyali	24	3	22	"Ok guys, so a few updates on our rules.

* **New warning policy**

Firstly, we've got a new warning policy being instituted. The policy is available on google docs [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bydr4tk6p1s4S0gtR3pLcjlmRVE), and it will also be linked in the sidebar for future reference.

Based on the situation, one of the mods can give either a formal or informal warning. Both will be recorded in a private warning log. A third major violation of our rules will result in either a temporary or permanent ban. Formal warnings will be given for serious things, like abusing the subreddit, excessive or repeated trolling/harassment, using racial or prejudiced slurs, etc. Informal warnings will be given for lesser things, especially if it seems the user doesn't realize s/he is breaking our rules.

A second warning may not be given before a ban if the same rule is broken twice For example, if a user was warned for constant harassment and continues this behaviour after the first warning, a ban may be issued instead of a second formal warning.

We definitely don't want to have a heavy hand on the banhammer, but unfortunately it seems like the community has taken a little bit of a downturn and we need to be a little bit stricter with the rules. This new warning policy won't affect the majority of you guys, just the people who are continually making a nuisance of themselves.

--------

* **Harassment/trolling and appropriate conduct**

It seems that lately there has been a lot of harassment and trolling going on in the subreddit recently. It's a little disappointing that we need to bring this up, but we do ask that everyone treats each other a little more respectfully. If you're not sure what constitutes appropriate discourse, check out reddit's [good reddiquette guide](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). 

There are no requirements for requesting an item. You do not have to be low on cash or hard on your luck; it is completely up to the giver who gets an item. It is perfectly fine to call out a scammer, or ask someone for proof if they do post a hard luck story, but there is no reason to swear at them or put them down.

**You are always free to ask a user to prove their story.** If they feel uncomfortable doing so publicly, they can always provide proof via the [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGiftofGames) link, and one of us will post confirmation.

As a side note, while I haven't seen a problem with this I did want to mention it: please make sure to mark any not-safe-for-work posts or external links, as people of all ages use this subreddit. 

------

* **Encouraging pirating**

While downloading games may not be illegal in certain countries, it definitely is illegal in many others. If you do want to suggest that a user pirates a game, please do so via pm. If we see people recommending pirating, the post will be removed.

------

* **Using multi accounts**

Please keep in mind that using multiple accounts to get around our flair rules will result in an immediate ban of the multi. Using throwaway accounts to troll will also result in an immediate ban of the throwaway. It IS ok to use throwaway accounts regarding personal matters if the poster does not want the community to know their usual account, but we do ask that you provide the moderators with the name of your usual account.

------

* **Flair updates**

Firstly, we're instituting a count on flair. We're going to use swiftcashew's suggestion and only institute the count on grabbed items. For example, a user who has given 2 games and received three would have flair that said *Gifted | Grabbed 3*. All gifted and grabbed items will be recorded in the [givers/receivers list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aidr4tk6p1s4dG1mUWxSMmFmVGVsdVY4Mk5DM0FKREE).

As of 11/28, all of the backlog of flair requests should be updated.

------

* **Trading games**

A couple things in this category. Most importantly, we've seen multiple people take games they received from people here and try to trade them for other games in other subreddits. This is completely against our rules, and anyone caught doing this will receive an immediate ban. Asking for games you plan to sell or ""trade up"" is doing nothing but abusing the kindness of the givers in this subreddit.

We've also seen some posts where a user offers an item, but is looking to trade and expects something in return. We ask that if you are looking to trade games, you take a look at /r/steamgameswap or other similar subreddits rather than trading here. If you have an item to give but would also like to request an item, we ask you just make two separate threads for them.

------

**Keep in mind that everyone is entitled to use the report link at the bottom of any post or thread if you feel a posting is inappropriate or breaks our rules.** We will definitely try to be proactive with keeping an eye on posts, but there's no way we can see every single one. By reporting inappropriate posts, you help to keep our community clean and fun for everyone!

I am giving away a key to this highly [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/search?q=Civilization+V&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) game. To make it fair for everyone, I thought I'd make it a small giveaway. 

The only rule is:

* **Your Reddit account must be at least 1+ month old.**

If you pass, all you have to do is leave a comment with the following:

1. A short response on why you want the game. *(Please nothing too long, I'm actually gonna go through and read all these.)*
1. A link to your Steam profile.

I'll choose the winner in 24 hours, which gives everyone a shot and plenty of time.

Good luck!

**Edit: If your Steam profile is private, I'm just going to skip over your comment. This is only to make sure you don't already have the game.**

OK, I realise I didn't make this clear before. Desura codes do not work on Steam. Desura is a different service, available via desura.com, that also offers an app to manage your library and also should give you direct downloads (you can add non steam games to steam, but without steam features such as achievements etc, if you want them all in one list)

I can't give tech support on this but I can give away codes :)

**RULES**

PM me, including ALL of the following :)

* DESURA30 as subject line
* Numbers in order of preference for things you might want
* ANOTHER list of numbers of the things you don't want (games you own, or hate...)

**PLEASE** make sure that you include all numbers from 1-7 in your PM so I know you have considered each item on the list. 

I'd rather give everything away and have a few people thinking ""meh, well it was free"" than have to keep reposting codes, and you can always email them on to another Desura user to pass it forwards. :)

Good luck :)

* 1 - Frozen Synapse, Spacechem, Trauma
* 2 - Trine, Shadowgrounds, Shadowgrounds Survivor
* 3 - Uplink, Darwinia, DEFCON, Multiwinia
* 4 - Crayon Physics Deluxe, Cogs, VVVVVV, Hammerfight, And Yet It Moves
* 5 - Braid, Cortex Command, Machinarium, Osmos, Revenge of the Titans, World of Goo, Lugaru HD, Penumbra: Overture (&amp; Samorost 2?)
* 6 - Braid, Cortex Command, Machinarium, Osmos, Revenge of the Titans
* 7 - Dungeons of Dredmor

1346289743.0	z1wpq	[GoG] How come nearly every single post on this subreddit is getting downvoted?	senichi	32	11	26	"I'm not talking about posts being positive and some people just downvoting because they're mean people, I mean not an upvote to be seen. I'm looking at the seven newest submissions and I see (1|1), (1|2), (1|2), (2|2), (2|3), (1|2), and (1|3). Only two of those seven posts even have one upvote (obviously not counting the poster), and none of them are above 0 points. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't this subreddit specifically made so people could request games? It even says on the sidebar, ""Inspired by Random Kindness and RandomActsofGaming. RAOG doesn't allow requesting, so we decided to make this.""

Why are people getting so butthurt when others find a cool new subreddit and decide to abide by the rules, and use the subreddit for its intended use? This is completely ridiculous.

EDIT: I looked slightly further down and even [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/z0i5x/gog_thank_you_metalface_mk1/) in in the negative. This person is *thanking* someone for a game. Taking time out of their day to publicly acknowledge someone else's generosity which isn't even slightly mandatory and hardly even expected, and people seem to dislike that?

EDIT 2: Since this post actually has positive karma, which isn't what I was expecting to be honest - with all the people downvoting everything - I'd like to thank anyone, and I mean anyone, that has a positive attitude. On the internet and in real life, just by showing up and having a good day, you potentially brighten the day of anyone else around you. This subreddit is literally the spirit of giving, among many other subreddits, and in a lot of cases it's getting a ton of people exactly what they deserve even if they can't get it themselves. Thank you to the many people here that openly offer games and follow through on your offers. Thank you to the people that see someone wants a shiny new game and gifts it to them. Even thank you to those asking for games that hold a positive attitude. And of course, thank you to /u/Cyali for creating this subreddit, and thank you to all the mods for doing all the mod things even though nobody is making you. Sorry if this seems random, but I just had an exceptionally great day for literally no reason and I want to make sure other people feel the same."	t5_2tb4r	True

p.s I am going to flip a table, never have I tried to organize a Reddit post and it's kicking me for it. o_e Working on making it nice and organized for everyone, so hang in there.

Forgive me for being slow, trying to make sure everything is organized. 

Also, if a key does not work, please let me know. They -should- all work, but as I said this is the first post of such caliber for me. o_e I am not normally organized so yea....

Also, I will be responding with ""Sent. &lt;What was sent here&gt;"" just to keep track so I don't double send a key to someone.

Also! Please don't feel bad if you don't receive one, I wish I could provide everyone with a key. It does not do much to brown nose, and I am sending based on the posts that sort of jump out (be it creative, or a story that touches me.)

Arh, had to remove 1 of each ''code'' because I got confused in the mass organization. Sorry about that, it's so hard to keep everything organized. I should have made everything perfect before posting. q_q

**That concludes the give away. Remember to pay it forward if you ever can. Sorry if you did not get something, if I could give everyone everything I would. I will try and do another one of these in the future, following the same format, but no promises. Hopefully everyone who received a code / key, it worked for them. Happy holidays all, enjoy~**

1365432871.0	1bx4ow	[REQUEST] Tripwire Humble Bundle BTA ($2.90/£1.90) OR JUST KILLING FLOOR	brawnycylinder	21	3	8	"So recently Killing Floor has been on sale on steam, so my friends decided to pick it up (more specifically, the Tripwire bundle on steam). I requested the guest pass so i could play with them for a couple days, and see if i should buy the game. I've been quite hooked on to the game in those days, since i haven't really played a zombie survival game since 2009 - COD WAW zombies. This one is just perfect for me, especially as it's on sale. But i recently totaled up my money spent on games in the last 3 months, and it has come to £99.60, which is like $150. I really cannot buy any more games, especially because of recent events that have meant i need to spend money for other things. This is quite literally the only co-op game that my friends play, but i just cannot afford it atm. If i wait, they may not play it anymore...

It should be around **£1.90/$2.90**, so i hope it isn't too much for someone to spare. If someone is kind enough, i will be forever grateful and hope to give away couple of these bundles when i can afford to.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, anyway.

Completely forgot about the link - http://www.humblebundle.com/weekly . When i am able to buy games, i want to do the weekly sale thing. But i live in the UK, and was wondering whether i would be charged for paying in a different currency?

EDIT: Most of my interest is on Killing Floor, so if anyone could give just killing floor alone i will also be so grateful.

EDIT: ~~Turns out i have a bit of cash left on the paypal (£0.81). If anyone were to buy this for me, i know it's not a lot, but i could buy you the non-bta version of it in return.~~ Actually, i just read the rules through again. Unfortunately, i cannot do this because it is considered trading (understandable). Please don't take this down if i can't, but if i am allowed, i would be willing to give away the non-bta bundle on the subreddit.

BTW, i don't know how, but i have managed to reach 11 upvotes! Thank you guys!"	t5_2tb4r	True

What is a game that you love that people have overlooked, maybe a game that slipped through the net because it was released at the same time as a big budget game? or maybe its just an old school classic...

Please up-vote your favorites, the suggestion with the most upvotes wins, if there is a draw i will decide the winner.

I would recommend ~~the game~~ ""Dear Esther"" - it is a very strange experience, i love it and revisit the Hebridean island often.

Maybe a link or vid would be good!! Keep it safe!

1341277916.0	vydml	[GoG] If I could make a few suggestions/comments on this subreddit 	totallygeeky	27	7	16	"You know, this is a good idea for a subreddit. A place for people to request and offer games, to help out other gamers. But let's be honest, this is predominantly requests now. I see only 7 out of the first 50 posts are offers. I think there should be a feeling of give and ye shall receive around here, not of begging for things. 

Also, I think these threads I've seen asking for any game on steam are going against what we're trying to accomplish here. I mean, if you're going to ask for games, at least ask for something you think/know you will like, so the person isn't wasting their money on you. 

A tip for some of you: make it look like you spent more than 5 seconds making the post. Proper grammar, a decent length, and it looking semi-professional makes me a lot more likely to look and consider helping out, personally. I have a feeling more than a few others feel that way too. 

Remember that these people are helping you out of the good of their hearts, so please don't be rude to them, and don't be a serial beggar. I've seen too many people who simply spam giveaway threads and subreddits like this trying to get tons of free shit. That's one of the reasons why places like /r/playitforward have karma limits to participate, so they know you do more than that.

**The giveaway is over folks! Also, Secret of the Magic Crystals has already been claimed!**

______________________________________________________________________________________________
I've received 2 gifts from this subreddit. I really do love this place. So I was thinking to myself, since I have $5.01 in my steam wallet, why don't I give back. I was going to buy borderlands but I'd rather give. So this is kind of a giveaway.

 I will choose one winner in about ~~45 minutes.~~ Whoever can make me laugh a lot, will win. You can post whatever you'd like. Pictures, jokes, .gifs, anything. 

Best of luck to everyone :)

P.S. I forgot to post this but thank you cyclomatek for your giveaway and giving me Skyrim. :D

P.S.S Upvote so that everyone can see :D (I get no karma. But you already know that :3)

edit: I will choose another winner for the Secret of Magic Crystals game. My friend just gifted it to me and I don't want it. So there are 2 winners now.

1st Place: $5 game

2nd Place: Secret of Magic Crystals

edit: I have to go to an appointment in about 20 minutes. I will choose the winner depending when I get back.

edit: I'm off to my appointment! When I return, I will read everyone's joke or view their picture. Best of luck to everyone.     

I'll view some from my phone :D So I won't have to come home to a daunting task.

EDIT: Apparently, my doctor rescheduled so I just came here for nothing. When I get back home, I will choose the winner. Should be around 15-20 minutes. :D


Edit: The winners were Lololnubcake and weemoose12 was generous enough to give Secret of the Magic Crystals to someone else. ~~So the winner is All5claws!~~  Thanks you for playing and making my day! :D

---------------------------------------------

Hello Guys and Gals! TotallyGeeky here, and if that was a surprise, then you need to learn to read better. 

I'm gonna get right down to business. Each prize group will correlate to the numbers after the list of games to win. Follow the instructions and post your entry below. I'll be taking entries on here and on PiF, so some will be awarded in here, and some will not. This will be open for about 2-3 days, I'll give you guys a 6 hour warning when I feel like it. Hooray for specifics!

*FOR EVERY ENTRY, I REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING (AND THE SPECIFICS FOR EACH ENTRY):*

* 300 Combined Karma 

* 3 Month Old Account 

* A link to your steam profile (which must be at least 3 months old, and have at least 3 non F2P games) 

I'll add other rules at my discretion, but I think that covers most of it. 

Here's the specific entry conditions for each group. 

***DON'T FORGET, THESE WINNERS WILL BE PICKED AT MY DISCRETION***

-----------------------------------------

***GROUP 1***

You must write a story me a story. But, I'm feeling like a bit of self promotion (Kinda), so you must write the story about one of Noah Bradley's art pieces, seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/5v2q7#0), see  /r/noahbradley for more. Write a background about the scene, write a biography for a character, write a narrative about any of it, just give me something and link the image you worked with. Minimum length of the story is enough to give the picture a background, a narrative would be nice. 

-------------------------------------------------

***GROUP 2***

I'd like to treat my girlfriend to some cute pictures, so I need the cutest things around. Cats are king in this competition, but good variety is encouraged. The more the merrier for this competition, more will always help. 

--------------------------------------------------

***GROUP 3***

You will write me a poem, confessing your love for me. I make you do this because I love these games in the section an extra large amount. Actual poetry will do a lot better than pseudo-prose. Working in my interests will make your poem even better. Minimum of 12 lines, Although a general rule will be the longer the better. Unless it's shitty. Then I'll be disappointed that you wasted that much time on it. 

---------------------------------------------

***GROUP 4***

It's the Valve games, so in honor you need to trade me an unusual. Just kidding, I just want you to either make me a pretty little picture of a new TF2 unusual effect (must be made by you), or..... Actually, that's it. I just want a picture of your idea for a new effect. The better it is, the better your chances. Also, optional is to design a new hat too.

------------------------------------------

***GROUP 5***

DOTA 2, brah. Just comment saying you want it, and link me an amazing song. Bonus points if you involve my favorite genres (dubstep, jazz, trap, or electroswing). 

----------------------------------------

1354117685.0	13xr5c	"[Announcement] We want YOUR suggestions for 
our new color scheme! (And also all flair should be 
updated now)"	Cyali	20	3	24	"First and foremost, I finished going through all of the flair requests, and everything should be updated. If your flair is incorrect, you can [message me directly](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=cyali). If you should have flair but none was assigned, [please request it again](http://giftofgames.bossydog.net).

------

------

We're looking for your input on our new color scheme! We're looking to change our flair and post colors, but will most likely keep the light grey background. Feel free to suggest a new background color if you like anyway though. Here's where you can put in your two cents. Following are images of all of the current colors of both flair and posts in one spot:

[Flair colors](http://gyazo.com/8d7cd6bd830f1138258f1f5f2f58e7fd.png) | 
[Post colors](http://gyazo.com/2bfee03d857c338e0e2f80bfed3f4b7e.png) | 
[Announcements/reddit title](http://gyazo.com/b4a59e3b90ff342f564ebf3ecfc20138.png) | 
[Top image](http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jWhT2dFmjPtKY7SS.png)

Keep in mind that the announcement/reddit title color *will be the same as the [GoG] tag color*. Also, I'm a little attached to the current top image, so unless there's a really cool suggestion it may end up staying the same =P

For any color suggestions, unless you are suggesting a standard color like red, blue, orange, etc., please include [the hex value](http://cloford.com/resources/colours/500col.htm) of the color you are suggesting. ([Here's another hex chart for reference](http://coolmaxhot.com/graphics/hex-colorsA.gif).)

For flair image suggestions, if possible provide images that are 15px tall and 12-17px wide. If you aren't able to, please provide an image that will scale down well. We prefer .png images as they have the best quality (and are easy to edit), but any common file type will be fine. And, just to cover all the bases, make sure the images are both appropriate and relevent to the flair type.

You don't have to include suggestions for each area, either. If you like the flair images, but just want to suggest new colors, feel free. Or if you only want to suggest a new color for one tag and nothing else, feel free.

**Keep in mind we will be keeping mod flair and the [Announcement] tag the same; these will stay red. As such, red will not be available as a text color to use for any other flair or post colors.** Also, posts using an incorrect tag will still be a greyed out color, but you can suggest a different shade of grey!

------

For your suggestions, please format your post like the examples below. Please also make only one post; if you want to update/add suggestions, add them to your same post.

Gifted flair: [Icon](http://gyazo.com/09bb12668247e8950faa57c4cb6399d0.png), text color: green

Grabbed flair: text color: #0099FF, background color: #0000FF

B) We are moving soon and need to sell a bunch of items from big things (cough, fridge, washer) to little things, give me an idea that isnt ebay or Craigslist on how to get the word out that we have things for sale.

I've been on this sub since I started Reddit, originally watching from the shadows as people gave away game after game to complete strangers. I was amazed at the kindness shown by the community for one another. Eventually, I started joining in the giveaways when I was wanting a new game. I won a fair few over the months I've been here, with those generous people saying no more than to enjoy the game, and maybe when I had the chance do the same for someone else.

So today, I managed to repay some of that kindness. I know, Humble Bundles aren't much, but to some people, they mean the world, to have a new game to play, a world to explore and love.

What I'm getting at is a great big thank you to everyone in the Gift of Games community. I'm happy to say I'm a part of such a group of generous and thankful people, wanting nothing more than to see other people be happy."	t5_2tb4r	True

I moved to a different state to get a job, planning on moving my wife and son with me. She decided she couldn't move away from her family after about a month of me working in a different state. 

That's fine, I understand. I was moved a lot as a child, so I didn't want to do that to my family. I quit my new job and moved back to my original state with her.

Now I'm currently jobless, and actively looking for a job. I'm sure I'll find one, but...in the mean time, the wallet is pretty tight. I've done the job search before, and after so long, you start to get antsy and a little stir crazy.

This is why I'd love this game. Something to play in my downtime between filling out apps and taking care of my child while my wife works.

Hi, I'm not Troy McClure. You might remember me from such giveaways as ""It's Christmas, let's subvert consumerism"", when 100+ games were gifted and some lovely people got in touch directly to gift things in return. 

You lovely, lovely people.

So, here's the plan tonight. I have a few game keys, and to get one, please do the following:

Make an **anagram** of the title of the game you want, and post it in the comments. The weirder/funnier the better. Please only pick one game and put in one suggestion - I'll take upvotes into account when picking who gets the keys, but I might not agree with them entirely so don't try to rig the vote :)

* ~~BioShock 1~~
* ~~Spec Ops The Line~~
* ~~Dungeons: The Dark Lord~~
* ~~Eschalon Book II~~
* ~~Men of War: Assault Squad - DLC Pack~~

Also I think I have a code for...

* Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space

...but I am honestly not sure if it's been redeemed. If any of these fail to work I can only apologise in advance, but I hope you have fun working out an entry anyway!

For any of you, and I know you are out there on the Internet, who don't know what an anagram is... just rearrange the letters :)

Entry rules:

-Reddit account must be at least 2 months old with 500 comment karma (exception - if you've given away stuff in the past in your own giveaway thread - before this giveaway started and can prove it).

-Steam account must be at least 6 months old with at least 12 non-free or Pay-what-you-want games/humble bundle/other cheap bundle games.

-You must redeem the game immediately if you receive it.

-Post your Steam profile - game library must be public to verify.

-I reserve the right to disqualify someone for whatever reason - being suspicious, only posting in gifting subreddits without giving anything, insulting people for no good reason, posting sob-stories here, having 50 AAA titles in your library (200 games is fine - if most of them were discounted/bundle ones or your account is really old), not reading the rules, etc.

-I'll choose after at least 24 hours has passed, but probably 48 or 72 hours. Depends how much interest there is.

To enter;

1) Post your top 3 choices of the above games.

2) Give me a list of your favorite 5 games that you own and a summary of them.

Due to the unusual circumstances regarding Key redeemability, I would ask that you guys not get your hopes up too high, and please don't be too bummed if it doesn't work out.

Tell me which game you'd like in the comments! I'll decide (randomly) who'll get it when I get back from work later tonight.

Original post:

-----------------------------------------------

Hi! This is my first post here for giving games away on this awesome subreddit.
I've been a lurker for a week or so now and have tried winning some of the contests here myself.. Thought it was cool of everyone to be giving games away to others and felt that I should be doing the same too. :)

This giveaway though won't be as straight forward as others, unfortunately. I've created somewhat of a small ARG/Puzzle game for people to play and earn their keys from. My apologies in advance if some of it is a little confusing or cheesey! Like I said this is my first giveaway so.. Not everything's ironed out. But I will be posting hints every now and then if you guys have difficulties.

Anyway, as the title says this is a giveaway for Bioshock 1 &amp; 2, Duke Nukem Forever Complete and Borderlands GoTY. Four different games and four different keys (not counting DNF's DLC keys).. All out there for you guys to find and claim for yourselves. If this giveaway goes well I may do more in the future. :)

Without further ado, let's get things started!

**First puzzle!**

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/46831807/vara-and-the-varb-ate-my-varc.txt

Congratulations to **blahblehbloo** for solving the first puzzle! He snagged DNF Complete.

Congratulations to **resisting_a_rest** for solving puzzles 2&amp;3. He snagged Bioshock 1 and Borderlands GoTY.

To progress onward, you must look for clues in what is uncovered.

**HINTS:** 

* One game key is actually split up between three files. Look for out of place characters and remember the steam key format is XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX

**PS: If you find and use keys please post that you have done so.**"	t5_2tb4r	True

I have decided that Anistuffs has won the game. Thank you all for participating, I'm sorry I couldn't get you all a game of your choice.

He spends a fair amount of time on it (inb4 addict - repetition is a trait of autism), and is 12 years old. I know beggars can't be choosers, but please nothing violent. He gets influenced easily by strong language and violence, so those are thing we try to steer him away from.

Anything would be grand, points even - he loves Minecraft and plays online with our older brother who is currently living a fair distance away. Not a clue why, but he keeps asking for some points to buy the skin packs.

Keys I have:
 Little Inferno (0-50)
 Capsized (51-100)
 Awesomenauts (101-131)
 Awesomenauts Cluck Costume (132-150)
 Intrusion 2 (151-200

All you have to do is say which game you want (you can list up to two of them) and guess a number within the numbers given for each game above. Whoever is closest gets the game. If two people tie somehow then it will be the first poster.

You have three days until this is over.

Edit: A lot of people are actually guessing really close and two have guessed the exact number for two of the games. If all games end up having the exact number guessed for it I will close it early.

Edit 2: I posted a comment but I'll post it here as well... Awesomenauts has been guess correctly and so has Little Inferno. So you can guess for them but it's not going to do much. I won't announce winners until this is complete. The cluck costume, Intrusion 2, and Capsized are still up for grabs right now and some people are getting REALLY close to them.


This has finished as of right now 11:55 PM 6/17/13 the winners will be announced here and messaged to have them send me their steam profile. If they do not respond within 24 hours I will choose the next closest guesser!

Little Inferno: 32 Good job Davidkones for guessing the correct number! You were one of the first guessers too, it shocked me ^ ^

Capsized: 84 No one actually guessed the right answer for this so congratulations to SmurfUnivurf for guessing closest! ^ ^

Awesomenauts: 111 I'm sooo sorry! Three of you guessed the correct number and I feel horrible but as I stated it would be the first who guessed it right so congratulations to Kenkai for guessing it right first! ^ ^

Cluck Costume: 145 Congratulations to Etteface for guessing closest ^ ^

Intrusion 2: 196 This came really close for a while and then earlier today Jeraldpunx11 guessed it correctly so good job! ^ ^

Remember guys, you may still have a chance if these winners do not respond in time! Also, I will be having another giveaway soon most likely so be on the lookout for that!

1345339864.0	ygc0t	[GoG] The Unofficial Official PlayBlink Code Giveaway Thread	swiftcashew	19	3	77	"***INFO***

Hey everyone, as suggested this is a thread for everyone to give out their PlayBlink codes. I am not an admin, but I made the Portal 2 coupon thread so I figured I should be the one to make this one.

***WHAT IS PLAYBLINK.COM?***

PlayBlink.com is a site where you can play minigames and win free Steam games. There are 3 types of giveaways on the site:

Blink Giveaway - The person to score the most in the minigame will win

Random Giveaway - A random entrant will win (do not have to play a minigame)

Mixed Giveaway - The higher you score in the minigame, the better chance you have of being selected randomly

The current minigames are Blinkeled (like Bejeweled) and Blink Shooter (can't think of the name of a similar game).

**Please note that you need at least 20 games which should be worth at least a combined total of $100.**

***RULES OF THE THREAD***

1) Upvote the thread, so that more people may see it.

2) Create a **top-level** comment if you are giving away a code, or are requesting a code.

3) If you redeem a code that is posted, reply to that thread saying that you claimed it. The giver must use strike-through formatting to cross out their code to indicate it has been used. If you recieve a code after requesting, use strike-through on your request. The giver must reply to that request saying they have given the code.

More info will be added if I see something missing, or if someone suggests something to be added.

EDIT: It seems that most of the codes I'm posting in this thread are being locked. Codes are locked when someone who does not meet the requirements attempts to activate the code. Again, please note that you need **at least 20 games which should be worth at least a combined total of $100**."	t5_2tb4r	True

1336537867.0	te7cq	[GoG] About Steam Requests...	amitter	17	3	23	"**TL;DR: From now on I will only gift once I see the profile.**

I know this applies to a small subset of people, so I apologize to those this small rant does not apply to.  
So! Last night I experienced a conversation from a complete stranger that left such a bad taste in my mouth that I felt the urge to post about it here. And to clarify, they were Steam friends with a certain redditor I've gifted to (who I'm not sure I can trust anymore).

It is not appropriate to tell your Steam friends to friend invite me to their friend list and ask/beg me games (or make new scam accounts pretending to be your Steam friends). I am in fact not rich, I am a student with no fixed income, and despite me gifting a lot lately would rather gift games to people who are honest and deserving. You are robbing my trust here as well and what started in good faith feels just awful now.

Anyways, if you've read this far then I have a suggestion or two when requesting for Steam games:  

* When requesting, be sure to post your Steam profile up as a sign of trust.
* Your library can not be barren (or just have 1-2 unplayed games). Have at least 10 bought games or something. And be a gamer, man. Which leads me into...
* Your total played time can not be less than 30 hours. It will come off a little greedy and unappreciative if you hardly played anything and you are here on this subreddit with grabby hands.
* Use some common sense: Do not ask for more games than you deserve. Be honest and do not lie about playing some game together with me when I ask who you are.

I doubt the people that should read this are going to, but I needed to vent. I'm sorry but I think from now on I will only gift once I see the profile. Thanks for listening.

**EDIT:** Thank you all for your replies! Some of you are very kind and I feel like a bit of my faith in humanity is restored that you show support. I understand some of your concerns as well, and I know I should not take a firm grip on the suggestions above, apart from being linked the Steam profile. They really are just suggestions I made to enable a bit of showmanship to the person gifting you. There are other ways for doing so, and showing appreciation in a unique way is one. One redditor was so grateful they made a ""thank you amitter"" image out of (what I think is) minecraft blocks. I loved it. Another redditor about two weeks prior went out of their way and messaged me offering to get -me- something! I was later surprised and happy to having gift a game to them before I realized we messaged before (karma at work there guys)."	t5_2tb4r	True

  So that means you'll be getting:

  -Toki Tori

  -Edge (I believe I also have a steam key from another bundle I bought that I may be giving out to second place ^ ^)

  -x2 10% off Toki Tori 2+ (You can only use one coupon when buying so you can give one to a friend too!)

  As with the last two of these I've done just pick a number 1-600 and whoever guesses the number/ gets the closest will get the bundle! This will be ending in about two days!

  In the event of a tie I will give the first two people, who guessed the number right/got closest/ whatever they did to tie, the bundle. Because I've had people in the past guess the number right or be the same distance away from a number and it was so hard to decide who won. In the end I just assigned a 1 and 2 to the users and put the 1-2 in random.org to decide. I felt bad about it though which is why I've decided on giving two out if this occurs. 

  And...... GO! 
   

Edit: This is now over, congratulations to MCubb for guessing closest ^ ^ Be on the look for another giveaway because there will be plenty more to come!

I just read over the sidebar and guidelines so I think I am doing it right. I have a redemption key for Realms of Arkania 1+2. I got it a couple of months ago from GoG.com.

I hit the random button as I tend to do when I have nothing better to do and landed here. The *very* first thing that came to my mind was this. I fetched the redemption key and now am making this. I *believe* I am doing it correctly. I read the warning policy, side bar and everything I could. If I am doing anything wrong I apologize ahead of time.

I am an active member over to /r/gameswap. I have over 40 trades confirmed through that site, evidenced [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mushroomkingdom/comments/xj96e/patdap_10_confirmed_trades/) among the many pending as well.

The game is this, if you and a group of people (lets say, *four* others) that you personally know/know from others/celebs/etc (Do not add in superheroes or people that can fix everything instantly) had to walk the entire [**Oregon Trail**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail) when everyone you don't deeply care about (everyone you love, not with you, are at the destination, safe) on Earth were Zombies trying to eat you, who would you bring, and why?

I will give my favorite reply the game, granted they fill out and meet the requirements. Please answer like this:

1. [Number between 1-100 for tie breakers] 
1. [First Choice and Why] 
1. [Second Choice and Why] 
1. [Third Choice and Why] 
1. [Fourth Choice and Why] 

* *Number was* **42***; answer to life, the universe, and everything.*
* *First choice was* **Ash Williams** *because he will introduce his boomstick to any zombies that cross us.*
* *Second choice was* **Chef Ramsay** *because we need awesome cooking to survive and if the zombies don't prepare a human corpse correctly he can scold them to re-death.**
* *Third choice was* **Daryl Dixon** *because his crossbow would be soundless, no need for much ammo as he can resupply, and he is motha' fucking DARYL DIXON! What zombie is going to try anything with Daryl staring 'em down?*
* *Fourth choice was* **Ellen Page** *because her small frame, quick wit, and too adorable for the zombies to eat. She probably has some hockey sticks and the proper training with them to do some serious melee damage. Also hot.*

[Choices were shown in alphabetical order]

This giveaway will run from **now** to **Sunday June 23th/Monday June 24th** at **midnight**.

First of all I'm not promising to give this little gem to anybody, i'm promising a chance. If you're interested in playing it you already know what it is so convince me. Tell why you want it and why i should chose you. Also for better chance at getting it tell me your favorite story about something interesting that happened to you in a survival horror game. 

My favorite moment weirdly enough would have to finding the lightsaber in Silent Hill 3. I think you have to finish the game once and then go to specific room in the mall and it's tucked away on a shelf somewhere. not 100% of the conditions or the location, it was along time ago :) and it's a very weird game. just look up  Heather Beam and Sexy Beam... Tell me yours. and again a disclaimer i reserve the right to keep this and offer it again later or to fill a request. I'll probably give it to somebody but survival horror fans are a rare breed so who knows :)

I mean, I respect everyone but when I see a guy who's been on Reddit for a long time. Got a valid steam account with high Steam Rating &amp; asking for a pretty cheap game (on sale or older game) with a good reason, I feel like if I had money for that person. He's worth that game. That's the thing, right?


When I see a pretty new Reddit account, barely been here before. Asking for weird things, such as. Games that cost 50$+, or the very annoying 'Anything' that's become very popular lately. They've also got 0 or barely any Steam Rating. Haven't tried the F2P games and just type a few words, sometimes not even the Steam ID.


I'm **not** raging, just stating that it's a very very low risk with the (possible scamming) people who create those topics daily. If you want a game on Steam, make sure you've played plenty of other F2P/games you own and read about the game you want, trailers/gameplay/stream and then type that in the thread you've created.

Also, I've gained quite some games but the most games I've received are from friends! Just saying :-D


Not mad or raging, just thinking people who really want the games they request here. Make sure you really want it and tried plenty of other stuff before! Sorry for bad english and tl;dr post. First 2 guys who post get dota2 code. (Make sure you say you want it tho)"	t5_2tb4r	True

You can still edit your post and I might count you in.

1373505670.0	1i1suk	[GOG] Current Affairs of Flairs (and other things)	komse	12	1	8	"Hey guys!

As you know, a couple days ago Shrimplet made a post regarding flairs being behind. Now, I have caught up to the ones from this month and most of the ones from last month.

Over the next couple days, you will continue to see your flair update as I work to finish the remaining backlog of flair requests.

That said, I would like to remind everyone of a couple things when requesting flairs that will make the process move along as swiftly as possible for both GoGers and  myself.

1. Please do not resend flair requests for giveaways/grabbed from over a month ago. This will confuse me and give me more items to look through. You may even become double marked on accident. In the event that you believe you've been marked a double grabbed drop me a PM or drop a mod mail.

2. If your flair is still incorrect, i.e. more grabbed than you actually have, then drop me a mod mail. I will do my best to look into and see where I messed up. However, you can also do your part in assisting me by including all your GoG thank threads and the giveaways you won at. Some of you have over hundreds of posts and I don't really have the time to shift through all of them.

3. If you run giveaways in other subreddits (i.e. /r/randomactsofgaming and /r/playitforward) those will not count towards your flair. They're a separate subreddit and community. It just doesn't work like that. This also goes for grabbed counts as well. So, refrain from requesting flair in /r/GoG from /r/RaoG and related subs.

And finally, this is not relating to flairs but other behavior I have noticed in the subreddit inside request threads and how they're set up.

1. [REQUEST] Threads should always be followed by the platform of the game you're requesting. A lot of users seem to be forgetting to add the PC/Steam, PS3, 360, and etc. flairs. While it may not be a big deal for you, it does keep things much orderly and saves individuals time by not having to guess what platform the game is wanted on.

2. **NO BEGGING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S REQUEST THREADS.** This is UNACCEPTABLE behavior on all forms. I am appalled to see other users posting in someone else's request while it's being fulfilled asking the giver if *they have another copy to give out.* That is begging even if it is subtle. If the giver does not actively contact you then don't bother asking. This can discourage others in fulfilling requests as they'll be met with beggers. While the number of users doing this is small, it's still significant enough for me to notice it. 

I know this was a bit long to read, but I hope many of you find it useful = w= b
