SURVIVOR ZERO FAQ

-Engine-

Unity
	
Engines such as UDK or Source aren’t optimized for large worlds. It lacks proper content streaming, so if you walked from one area to another, you'd have to face loading screens. Unity lets us load in parts of the map as you go around, in a separate thread, so they'll load just out of your view as you get closer to them.


-Support-

Windows/OSX
	Unity allows for a lot of support on a variety of devices, including Mac, Xbox360, and mobile devices. The Unity team is working to add in Linux support, so that is a possibility in the future as well.

-Coding-

We are currently coding Survivor0 in C#

-Why won’t we take your money right now? Are we selling it?- 

We currently do not have a business model for the release of this game. 
We’d like to wait until we have something releasable before we decide that and/or to take donations; if the team fails to make the game in a reasonable timeframe, we don’t want you to be upset with your donation!

-Whats the character viewpoint?-

We are making this game in First Person View, with similar controls to other FPS games. 

-Setting-

the game setting is not taking place in any real world location. It is going to be procedurally generated: terrain/items/zombies/roads buildings, will be placed logically every time you start a new game. it will mostly be suburban, with a section of urban environment further in.

-What is the game type?-

We’re making a game about freedom, combat, construction, and zombies! As the name might hint at, it is a game that focuses on survival. Rather than be a combat-oriented run and gun game, we are designing it so attacking zombies head on will likely have consequences. Guns will be hard to find and ammo will be scarce. We also want to incorporate different game modes later on, post production to cater to different players tastes and let them truly customize their experience.

-Will there be multiplayer?-

We are aiming to have a server based co-op mode. We don’t know how many players right now, but this is a topic we’re going to keep in mind during development.

-How customizable will the game be?-

We are aiming to make an extensive options menu so you can play a game to your liking. 

-is there item crafting?-

Yes. Expect details in the future!

-How far are you in to development?-

Two months

-How can I help you?-

The root of the problem is, every time, without fail, this: the project founders try to emulate financed development studios in their team organization.  

They try to recruit and assign ""jobs"" to people. They enjoy working behind closed doors so that they might wow people with screenshots or concept art in their internet ""press releases"".  They, in their inexperience, think every line of code they write is a precious jewel to be buried in the back yard.

Because that's what [their favorite game company] does!

But it doesn't work.  Seriously.  No matter how excited you are about this project, you *will* burn out. Your team will fall apart.  You will struggle to fill the ""jobs"" you created.  New developers will step in, hate the base of work their predecessor created, and insist on rewriting it.  You will find yourself digging in a never-ending hole.

You cannot form a small unpaid team of extremely talented and experienced people who will invest thousands of hours of their life to this.  And make no mistake about it.  That's what's ahead of you: *Thousands of hours of WORK*.

But I didn't come here to rain on your (potentially **AWESOME**) parade.

The most tried and true, tested and proven road for unpaid development projects to succeed is through [free \(liberty\) licensing](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), and encouraging community involvement.

Contributors will come and go, leaving a trail of checkmarks on the todo list.  That bad decision you unknowingly made will be corrected by the combined decades of experience brought by those digging through your repository.  A core team of people will probably stick with it for the long-haul, but only because they were able to step back from time to time and take a breather. 

Your project, given enough like-minded people, able to contribute - both big and small, in their respective areas of expertise/motivation - **will succeed**.

But only if you let it.

The number one thing that prevents that, however, is ego.  Too many people want to believe they're the next John Carmack, and want to close off the development to ensure they can stand alone in the spotlight (or at least share it with as few shoulders as possible).  Do so at your own risk.

I wish you all the best of luck, and hope to see - and contribute to - this on [github](https://github.com/) (or its brethren) soon. :)

tl;dr - make it a community project to maximize the chances of a fun, playable, game that everyone wants to be involved in."	t5_2sn4h	True

Chances are if you're on this subreddit, you've heard of it, so I won't bore you with an overview.  As its in roughly the same genre as Survivor Zero is planned to be, discussing the pro's and con's of Dead Island can serve some benefit.  Perhaps it can help us supporters crystalize what our ideal zombie survival game would be.

I don't want to cover everything in this first post, hopefully this becomes a discussion and not me just spewing my own opinion.  With that said, here's some thoughts from me to get things started.

Pros:

** The game world is big, seamless, and has a consistent art direction*

I'm suspecting a lot of the budget went into making the world the way it is.  There is lots of detail, lots off the beaten path, and its almost entirely non-linear.  Although Survivor Zero is planned to be procedurally generated, perhaps 

** Zombies show damage well*

Flesh burns away, limbs and heads are removed, etc.  They go above and beyond applying a red wound decal and calling it a day.

**Cons:**

** Combat is very “gamey.”*

Lots of button mashing, the damage you do flashes up on screen, zombies are extremely weak, etc.

There is little more depth in the combat system than the original Zelda games.  There are perhaps a few reasons for this.  First is that players are much more mobile than zombies.  You can dart around their blows extremely easily.  In Zombie canon this may be true in reference to foot speed, but the zombies in Dead Island do gigantic windmill swings are very easy to duck away from.  Getting close to a zombie should be dangerous.  Dead Island also uses the same trope that Left 4 Dead does, players are immune to the virus somehow.  This in effect turns things into a stock action game, where being bitten can be cured by chugging an energy drink.  A single zombie bite spells death, and combat needs to be about avoiding them, not tanking through them.

You can also kill zombies by hitting them anywhere, encouraging melee spam to do the most damage.  My thoughts on how to avoid this are a little complex.  Head/neck blows should be the only way to 100% neutralize a zombie (with removing limbs/destroying spine, being partial destruction).  Having a obvious pool of hitpoints to whittle down also ruins any semblance of realism.  You could perhaps quantify skull integrity or % of brain destroyed, but you won't lower that by swinging a paddle at the zombie's torso like Dead Island does.  You shouldn't have to have the cursor over the head to do a headshot though (at least not in melee).  Give the player some leeway, there are some allowances that have to be made for the imprecise nature of monitor resolution and mouse accuracy.  Perhaps as your character gets more experience they're better able land head blows.

Supernatural rage abilities turn me off too.

** Its buggy as hell.*

I don't think I need to explain this one much.  Quests that don't work properly, zombies spazzing out in walls, etc.

** Weapon construction/repair/uprage system lacks realism, is very gamey.*

Taking a baseball bat, cutting a chunk out and sticking in a rotary saw would in no way improve the bat.  It would break on the first solid hit, and smacking a zombie with a rotary saw would do less damage than the bat in the first place.  It's not as silly a system as Dead Rising, but I really hope Survivor Zero avoids this type of crap.  Duct taping a flashlight to a gun=cool, re-gripping an axe so you hold onto it better=cool, using a whetstone to sharpen a blade=cool, taping a battery to a machete so it stuns zombies=lame.

[wall of text]	brotoro	69	8	23	"Hey guys, I'm a modeler for Survivor Zero and I wanted to just rant a little bit about my opinion on PR. I don't talk for the entire team, but I understand where you guys are coming from and I want to put you all at ease as best I can.

I can't stress enough how motivated we all are to seeing this to the finish, despite a few of you assuming we'll give up easily or just disappear. Personally I've seen both sides of it; I've gone from being a huge fan of the game, to actually having the privilege to work on it. Working with these guys has only reinforced my beliefs that they will deliver something spine-meltingly awesome. We don't get paid for this, we're all spending money out of our own pockets, and spending countless hours developing this thing. I personally have worked more-or-less full time trying to make the explorable world of Survivor Zero as good as I can, and all the other members are twice as passionate as I am about what we're doing.

So, I understand where you're coming from when you make a thread asking ""is this dead?"" but its upsetting to see people ignoring our efforts in PR and just assuming we've stopped development because of a simple and unavoidable hiccup (the website going down). We have a [facebook page](http://facebook.com/survivorzerogame) now, and it is updated weekly *at the very minimum*. We also post weekly over on the Screenshot Saturday thread in /r/gamedev (you can check out our latest screenshots [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fwm67/screenshot_saturday_122_only_the_pixels_can_save/caejs6x), and each post has a link to the previous one at the end of it), but I understand that not a lot of you fans will be seeing that stuff, so I want to ask you guys for suggestions on what we could be doing that'll put an end to these silly threads being created. My biggest quip with threads like that is that they turn off other fans and make some of you actually believe that we've halted production when that is absolutely not the case, and never will be!

I get it, you want more updates! More interaction! But where? It seems like facebook isn't reaching enough of you. I'd like to be posting the weekly screenshots of work-in-progress models and things of that nature, but I have to know it'd be well-received and somewhere you can all see it. I don't want it to be another, seemingly wasted, effort in PR.

So, help us improve the community! What would you like to see, and where? Screenshots? Blogs from the developers?

Thanks for your support, just trust that we will deliver the best experience we can. In many ways the team has exceeded expectations I had as a fan, but we hold back a lot because we want it to be polished so we have something finished to show off.

As the programming and art teams have kept pace with the basic necessities of our game and built a badass FPS framework to make sure our foundation is there, our design team has gone through a little restructuring and recently finished strong with a nine-page outline (OUTLINE) of all Survivor Zero's most important features and details. And by recently, I mean mere moments. And by that, I mean I just finished it at 4:04AM after months of planning this beast of a document and am updating you 'cause you deserve it instead of goin' to sleep like I wanted. 

But, in my sleepiness, I shall assure you, there's some serious awesome going on in this document. I wrote the damn thing and even I can't wait to play this game.

God, I wish I could share!

But I can't...

...yet.

As we continue through the development process, transparency will be a high priority for us, but up till now we've tried to be a little hush-hush about where we stand just so that there's no confusion as we go. As stated, we've spent months discussing before laying everything down in ink, and it's in ink that these details will soonishly be shared. Just a matter of time and a little more detail settling before you guys know a good bit as much as we do! (But keep in mind that we gotta hold back for some surprises, so don't expect it all at once by any means...)

Keep your eyes here on the subreddit as we look forward to (hopefully soon) revealing our new website design, and even now we hope to see you on the awesomely fast and wonderfully functional forums at http://forums.survivorzero.com or at #survivorzero on Freenode in IRC!

1310707842.0	iq5z6	As someone who has spent many years in the modding community and even tried to start his own game studio, some advice		65	12	22	"Hey guys, glad to see so much enthusiasm around here. If you wouldn't mind listening I think I can offer some tips on general project management that you might find useful. Over the years I've worked on a lot of (mostly unsuccessful) mod projects for games. I spent over six months working with some close friends last year trying to start our own game studio, which failed spectacularly. My day job is a full time software engineer. While I'm sure you guys are smart and probably know a lot of this, I'm going to post it anyway, because I think these kind of collaborative projects have interesting potential and it never hurts to hear these suggestions again.

Now, I'm still a fairly young guy (mid 20s) so I really don't know a lot. But I can tell you some of the things I DO know, and some of the things I've experienced first hand many times over.

First of all, no matter how many talented people you have, the project is going to be MUCH more difficult and take MUCH more time than you first anticipate. Project estimation on stuff like this is highly subject to Hofstadter's Law:

&gt; Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

I guarantee it'll take you longer than you think, even when you take into account the fact that it'll take you longer than you think. You won't have a remotely good idea of how difficult things or how long they'll take until you're halfway through them (see: [cone of uncertainty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_uncertainty)).

However, you can mitigate this. Develop your project iteratively. Start small, VERY small, and gradually increase the scope of the project as you gain more success. Make prototypes. Evolve them until you know the concepts work. Don't spend too much time focused in on one area. It was mentioned in the original /r/gaming post that someone has already gone out to record sound effects at a gun range. The enthusiasm is great, but let me tell you: you're wasting your time. Sound effects are the last thing you need to be worrying about right now. In fact, you can buy huge sound effect libraries on CD (or probably digitally nowadays) that have professionally recorded sounds done for you. I got one years ago from the library, called Sound Effects 6000 or something, it actually had quite a few well recorded gunshots, both indoors and out. Get major features and functionality done before worrying about stuff like that.

That brings me to another point: *don't make what's already available for free or cheap.* As you may know, there's a ton of great libraries for Unity. Stuff like AI behavior trees and pathfinding are all but done for you. The Asset Store has a ton of great stuff just waiting to be used. Yeah, it costs money, but it also costs people's time to make them. If you can pool some money, use it to buy assets. Because trust me, finding good artwork is VERY difficult. Even if you do get good artists, there's no guarantee they'll stick around.

Get a good project management tool. I highly recommend Redmine. It's the most feature complete and flexible free tool I've used, and fairly easy to set up on any Rails shared hosting or VPS.

BUY UNITY PRO. For the love of god, do NOT attempt a project with more than 1 person using the free edition of Unity. It will NOT WORK. Why? Because Unity free doesn't support version control. And no, you can't just hack it to work with Subversion, the asset library will not sync properly and it will BREAK. The larger your project gets the more of a nightmare it will become. You don't need to pay for the Asset Server (though it might be nice), Subversion is fine. And yeah, it's expensive, but trust me, there's no alternative. You could go use another engine, but none of them are as good. You could write it in XNA, but then you are starting from scratch. If you can't afford it, raise money on Kickstarter or something (probably a good idea anyway). I assume, based on your need for streaming environments that you are already going down this path, but I feel it's important to mention for anyone else reading. I spent a *stupid* amount of time trying to make Unity free work with VCS, it just won't happen, certainly not reliably.

Have a design document. You don't need a massive, 80 page monolithic document outlining every detail of the game, but you NEED to capture the overall vision of the project. A lot of it you won't know until you start to develop specific parts of it, and that's fine. Capturing this on a wiki is excellent. If you use a tool like Redmine, you can capture individual features and tasks in the tracker and assign them to people (and link them to the wiki and other cool stuff, Redmine rocks).

Have a unified artistic vision and style, and make it set in stone. Nothing's worse than deciding halfway through the project that your visual style isn't going to work. Personally, I'd go with something more towards photo realism, mostly because of existing free and commercial assets that you can leverage. Contrast to say, some cell shaded style where you'd have to do it all from scratch.

That's about all I can think of. I'm not really sure why I felt so motivated to write this up... maybe your project sort of reminds me of my own failed projects, making me hopeful you'll succeed. I really hope you guys take this advice to heart. None of this is really magic wisdom, this is common advice anyone will tell you. You probably know most of it but I feel it's good to put down anyway.

All that being said, I may be able to contribute in small amounts as a programmer, UX designer or artist, my competencies being ranked in that same order. :)"	t5_2sn4h	True

That's still happening, I assure you, I just wanted to throw out a shortlist I made in another comment thread so that you'd all have something to go on before I made a more full, detailed list of how the project's been going for the last few months. 

The list **of what's done** (though still, always in a state of being polished):

* Player spawning
* Zombie spawning
* Procedural terrain generation
* Procedural building creation
* AI that dynamically navigates its environment (and does some neat things, too.)
* Varied models and weapons and furniture
* A growing collection of animations
* Intense musical ambience aplenty

There's more than just this list that's in the works, and as stated, this list itself is still in the works, but what's above has been proven to work in our test builds.

And it's all growing all the time, hence the need for this post.

1310693737.0	iq07l	What can you tell us as of now?	lulzwut	56	5	81	"1. Are you aiming for small scale co-op(2-4 players) or larger scale multiplayer?
2. Will the game consist of one large map in which players must explore for resources to survive, or will it be similar to Terarria's randomly generated worlds?
3. What exactly will be the point of the game besides surviving, if anything? Not to say that isn't enough to work with.
4. What features can you confidently say will be in the game? Will players need to find food and water for instance?

Few suggestions. No particular order and not organized.

1. Players should be able to explore inside of nearly every building/structure, and the use of a flash light would be required due to there probably being no power. Flash lights should require batteries that need to be replaced from time to time.
2. Players should be required to find food and water to stay alive.
3. Player inventories should be realistic, and ""weight"" should be something to think about. Players should be able to extend their inventories by finding things like back packs and equipping them.
4. Cosmetics could be something fun to play with, allow players to equip and discover many different cosmetic pieces. Some people may be against this kind of thing, but there's no arguing that this provides a lot of room for progression and is something to keep people interested in going out and exploring.
5. Hunting what little animals are left for food could be another feature.
6. Generators could be another neat feature. Once you build a safe house, you could find a generator and use it for electricity. This would of course require you to refill it with gas from time to time.
7. Vehicle transportation would be cool, but would need to be limited so it's more of a luxury than common form of travel. This would be easy to do by making gasoline rather rare.
8. Players should be able to design all sorts of things using junk they find all over the game world. They could build weapons, small vehicles like bikes, cosmetics, and a number of other type of useful items.
9. Weapons(namely melee) should have durability. This way players can't just simply find a weapon such as a baseball bat and use it forever without the need to repair or find a new one.
10. Skills and stats that increase when performing a related action and decrease over time(GAME time) when the player does not practice. An example of this would be by using a melee weapon a lot your strength increases. Start using a gun more often instead and over time your strength will decrease but your ability to use guns will increase. Sprinting often can increase your stamina, cooking often can increase your cooking ability, etc.
11. Players should be able to free-run and learn new techniques to climb and maneuver their way around the map. Some of these abilities should require certain skill levels such as stamina, climbing and speed.
12. A lot of talk about a ""goal"" has been going on. I think rather than some scripted end game goal, the player(s) main goal should be to create a safe community for humans in which they can live as close to ""normal"" as possible given the circumstances. This also opens up a window for player competition where players and player communities can work together and merge or kill one another off for supplies. The entire state of the game world would be in the hands of the players.
13. Players would need some sort of way to build and/or customize structures like houses. I think something like minecraft would be far too extensive and exploitable though. Perhaps you would be required to start small and build small scale houses, and as your crafting skill raises(carpentry for instance) you'd unlock more blue prints for larger more sturdy structures; which would obviously require the correct materials. Building can be done in a simple animation where your character repeats an animation like banging a hammer and you'd have a ""progress bar"" to show how long it will take; and if another player with the correct skill set helps out it will be built faster; perhaps it would even require more than one person. This way you'd have to be in a safe area to build and sometimes even require protection from being attacked during the building process.
14. Achievement system. Definitely a plus and a nice way to make challenges that players will want to work towards completing.
15. More on inventory. It should not ONLY be about ""slots"", but also about weight. For instance, if you have 10 slots but equip 5 very heavy objects, if you go over your weight limit you won't be able to fill up the other slots. How much weight you can carry will be directly in relation to your strength.
16. I was also thinking of rather than having a direct hierarchy of zombies in which one zombie is better all around than another, there can be zombies with different attributes. This is also realistic, as zombies were once humans. Football players are strong, sprinters are fast, some of them could have been very intelligent before they became zombies and thus retained some of their intelligence when they became zombies, etc. One zombie isn't ""better"" than another; just different. Why make zombies the most simple feature of a game focused on zombies?
17. A little on zombies running. While I don't think they should run, there needs to be an incentive for players to use sprint and increase their stamina and speed. On that note, I do think zombies should be able to at least crawl, drag or otherwise move faster for short bursts in an attempt to snag the player. This speed shouldn't be as fast as a players default speed however. This would be enough to make being stuck in a small area a little bit more challenging.
18. Death penalty. When you die, you should be able to play as a zombie, or hit a ""release"" button at any time in which you lose control of the zombie, which then becomes AI controlled; and you return to the character creation screen to create a new character. When creating a new character, you can choose one of your dead characters and your new character will inherit his/her skills, but NOT inventory. To get your lost inventory, you need to visit the area that your character died, and your inventory will remain there. You do not regain inventory by killing your old character's zombie due to the fact that he may be killed by other players first.
19. While it is said that this will not be an MMO and support a massive amount of players, I think the game should support as much as it can possibly support while remaining stable. The social aspect of this game is one of the most important, in my opinion; being that it's about a zombie apocalypse and trying to survive. I would suggest allowing a max of 32 players per server, and letting this be an option that the server creator/host can toggle.
20. Also about hud. I think it should be a very basic minimal hud, but HP or some sort of life gauge would be nice, since in real life you CAN tell or at least ""feel"" when you're getting weak and about to die, but in-game this is impossible and thus would require some other form of knowing your limits. This could be accomplished without a life gauge with the use of in-game effects such as vision blur, loss of balance, etc.

I propose that you handle ammo in clips and magazines. However, if you don't use up all the bullets in a clip or mag, it is saved within the mag. Once you run out of full mags, you draw on your supply of semi-depleted mags. If you don't want to resort to this, or find more ammo, you must spend time consolidating your rounds into a smaller number of clips or mags.

The team of Survivor Zero is looking for reinforcements! To do this, the art team needs a couple more sets of hands! We currently have 3 positions that would be of great benefit to us if they were filled.

We are currently looking for:

**Character Concept Artist**
We need someone who can sketch many different zombie character concepts, because this game is going to have a lot of zombies! We want zombies that are going to be just as appealing as they are terrifying!

**Character Modeler**
Do you enjoy creating low-poly 3d models based off of a character sketch? We are looking for you! Preferably have similar experience modeling for games.


**Character Rigger**
What are we going to do with characters with no bones?! We need someone who can rig up a character to move, and someone who can do it with a decent level of professionalism. We want these characters to move, and we want them to move well, it all starts off with a decent skeleton and rigging system! We are looking for you!


**Keep in mind these positions are volunteer at the moment and therefore unpaid positions!**

1325285754.0	nwsz1	Project Update: Designing the Apocalypse	s0urc3	55	10	11	"Hey survivors!

Since in our last update I mentioned we were adopting a new sort of development transparency when it comes to how things work around here, I figured the basics would be a good place to start. So, to give you guys a quick overview of what our process looks like, I've put together a couple thoughts and decided to throw 'em into an update for you guys to see how we do what we do!

First, I'd like to say that I've noticed a lot of worry and reports on our lack of availability as being a sign of vaporware, and this is nothing new. No matter how much we update when we can, and no matter how many assets we provide, there are no and never will be any guarantees that anything in the world of game development is certain. We work day to day, however, and each day we log in, there's always more of something to be done and more to keep in mind, and so far, we've been doing this plenty of days. Enough days to know that we're doing just fine for ourselves in terms of getting Survivor Zero out there to the hungry masses. We don't yet have an idea of when it will be done, but we do have a concept of the distance of scope that we're trying to reach and the reality is that it's well within our abilities. The way we've been organizing and tracking our project has worked well for us, and it's the compensations for our distance and non-traditional association with one another that has come to be some of our greatest strengths.

To design Survivor Zero, we've been using a pretty classic method based on the establishment of a Game Design Doc that updates and is updated with tasks and assignments for the team. It started when we did as a couple notes in Google Docs and has evolved far beyond that into a full-fledged technical outline of all of the gameplay elements of S0. We're not held back by the traditional problems with this sort of design, however, because as we work, we stay logged into our IRC channel and are able to receive pretty much immediate feedback on anything we're working on. Because of this, not only are we able to get more perspective on something that others may not have professional experience in but still have a fresh eye for, but we are also able to avoid the pitfalls of developing something only for it to turn into a complete waste when someone else on the team has a problem with a detail. It's a combination of both agile and classic design standpoints that lends a great flexibility to the development of the project.

We are a group of people with families, jobs, and psychological health to monitor, but that doesn't stop us from doing what we can to keep this project alive. We've offered the community a chance to weigh in on our crafting processes, thought long and hard about what's fun vs what's simple vs what's possible, and are putting forth a lot of effort into creating a compelling and realistic tension in our gameworld. But we don't want to feel that we're leaving our own lives behind to do so, so do keep in mind the volunteer nature of this project when you consider how long it's taking us. We know you're all excited to play it, and I know I speak for the whole team when I say there is no way in this world that you could possibly as excited as we are to get a chance to see what our work has wrought, so just know we're pressured internally just as much as we are by our fans!

We'd like to thank you all for your support and consideration when it comes to our project, and we'll be sure to keep you updated in the future. Due to a little complication, this post is going to a self-post on the subreddit as well as a post over at [SurvivorZero.com](http://survivorzero.com), but a perma-link to the individual post will be provided later.

Lochmon	48	3	12	"I seem to recall from early discussion there would not be any of the really fast zombies that some games introduce to up the difficulty, as it's not a ""realistic"" take on zombie behavior. And I recently thought of a possible exception to this....

What if fast zombies are not the high-level boss-like things they are so often depicted as, but instead are simply the *new* zombies? It would work like this: you're present with a living NPC, maybe a merchant or just another somewhat friendly survivor type. Should a zombie attack come, there's a pro and a con to the situation. You've got the additional NPC firepower standing next to you, who will certainly help try to repel any attack... *but* if that NPC is overcome and infected you've got a real problem. He will go down briefly as he starts to die from the transition, but at some point soon he's going to come up moving fast as the instinctual body panics at what's happening. It would be weak, it would be as likely to attack the other zombies as your own character, but it would introduce even more chaos to the situation for a minute, flailing about, gradually slowing to normal as death becomes complete.

Some ""clean"" NPCs will try to kill you on sight, just to take your stuff (or preemptively protect their own). The friendly NPCs are a necessary resource, but also inspire much wariness from the potential of being in their presence at exactly the wrong time. You would stay close during an attack because you have the help, but if he goes down you really need to start putting some distance from him."	t5_2sn4h	True

1311574251.0	iyyec	Procedural Generation of Characters (Zombies)	Alford35	46	4	32	"For a long time now, we have all been playing in increasingly realistic first-person ""worlds"". Yet, despite the varying textures of the planets, forests, cities, dungeons, fortresses, castles and military installations, we constantly encounter bands of familiar-looking bad guys. Game designers have clung to the convenient deceits of alien species, cloning experiments and the like, or simply hoped that the fact that there's a Nazi swastika on an armband would distract us from the fact that, no matter how perfect the Nazi Aryan ideal, they weren't **that** identical.

So, with all the advances in procedural generation of effects and environments, could a world be populated with procedurally generated bad guys? When I heard of the Survivor Zero project, I felt two things. First and foremost, a deep-rooted longing for this game to be everything that it could be. Second, that there could perhaps be no better home for the idea of randomly (within sensible constraints) sized, shaped and, as this is zombies we're talking about, disfigured ""creatures"".

Let me make it clear that I'm not a 3D modeller and I'm not a games programmer. I'm an avid games player and have been since the ZX Spectrum ""glory days"" where a small handful of pixels and a healthy imagination could convey almost anything.

I wonder now, in a gaming world of high resolution, high fidelity, high realism graphics, whether this idea is more complex to realise than it may have been a few years ago? Take a simple example: height. Surely not every fireball throwing Doom Imp was a strapping six-footer? Would a bit of sprite-scaling have helped to make things feel more ""real"" (give or take the Martian location, etc.) as we were mobbed by a gang of green-haired ex-marines? Now, the polygon-count is way up and so, perhaps, would be the complexity of scaling the size of my enemies, but it's still a little disappointing that when I face the Combine in City-17 every victim of a headcrab is pretty much the same size as me.

With Survivor Zero, we're talking about a world full of recently-not-that-dissimilar-to-you-and-me enemies. Zombies don't rush their prey, they swarm and overwhelm with that crushing kind of Terminator-like inevitability that comes with a huge weight of numbers (and an insatiable craving for living flesh). With large numbers, we'll need large variety to avoid the ""reality""-breaking sense of deja-vu of being overrun by 15 identical, drooling and limping ex-Supermarket employees.

So what parameters might be played with to create such variety?

* Clothing - A change of shirt, dress, hat, trouser or skirt colour/pattern would help to break up the masses.
* Height - As a populace we vary in height enormously and while there may be some pretty solid averages, it would be great to be towered-over by a 6'8"" giant or swing a baseball/cricket bat at the head of a 5-footer.
* Weight - Zombies all move at a pretty glacial pace, but that's not to say we shouldn't have a mixture of lean, mean drooling machines and couch-potato waddlers.
* Age - I'm sure I'm not along in thinking it would be fun to put an axe between the eyes of a zombie Granny and what about that difficult moment of having to pull the trigger and scatter the rotting brains of a ten-year-old girl?
* Race - Unless we're in a very sheltered back-water, this world is a wonderfully diverse place and we need some ethnic diversity in our shambling hordes.
* Disfigurement - This was the thing that jumped out at me like a lurking zombie from behind a shower-curtain. Randomly missing arms, legs, eyes, jaws and bowels are what really separate the living from the (un)dead and just think of the variety options just those few parameters could provide.

I'm sure there are many more, but using a few prototypical base models and combining them all (while ""sensibly limiting"" some - we don't necessarily want children in business suits or adults in diapers - that's for a whole other branch of ""online entertainment"") the world could be full of the malingering threat of:

A 6'2"" black guy in jogging pants and a t-shirt missing his left arm, dragging his feet next to a 4'6"" Asian girl with a hole in her abdomen, following a (no longer) 5'8"" chronically obese white woman clawing herself forward thanks to her missing legs...

Is any of this really possible? Well, this game has been founded on the dreams of the masses, so my dream is that it could be populated with realstic representations of wandering corpses of those masses!

1315407854.0	k7n5q	On Melee Combat	harris5	43	3	12	"I'd like to address melee combat a bit.  I hope this reddit is still a medium to share ideas that the dev team can use.  If not, I can repost to the forum if people think that's a better stage now.

Most weapons (in real life as well as games) have a default attack that people will naturally do when picking one up.  With a kitchen knife, you slash and jab.  With a crowbar, you swing down on a target.  With a spear you stab.  Some of these weapons have other uses in combat though.  With the spear, you can hold it by the haft and block/push with it.  With the crowbar you can hook a zombie and pull it to the ground (where it is more easily dispatched).  The kitchen knife is interesting, because unless you're getting lucky and jabbing into the eye, its unlikely you'll be destroying the brain with ""standard"" attacks.  To reliably kill a zombie, you'd want to grab the zombie with an off hand and stab up through the chin or through the eye socket.

What I'm arguing for here is an alternate melee attack in addition to standard swings.  Each weapon would have different alternates.  Some might be push backs or pull downs (such as the crowbar), some might be ""powerblows"" (such as a sledgehammer) or ""grab and stab"" (such as the kitchen knife) which could dispatch a zombie in one blow.  It would make for a much more interesting (and realistic) game than a one button spam system.  Throw in a grappling system and you're golden.

An extra suggestion to tack on: Perhaps ""charging up"" an alternate attack could be an interesting mechanic.  Press the alt attack for a blocking weapon, and you hold it in front of you with two hands to block a blow.  Hold it for a moment longer, and you push out, shoving any zombie back.  Hold the alt attack button for a power attack item like a sledge hammer, and you swing it back a bit, then bring it down in a crushing blow.  If you don't hold long enough, you don't get it over your head.

Anyways, what follows are some alternate attack suggestions for common zombie killing weapons.

* **Click-&gt;block, Hold-&gt;push**: Police baton, machete, baseball bat, spear, shovel
* **Click-&gt;block, Hold-&gt;pull down**: Crowbar, boat hook, pick
* **Hold-&gt;power smash**: Sledgehammer, large axe
* **Hold-&gt;power decapitate**: two handed swords
* **Click-&gt;grab, Hold-&gt;execute zombie**: Kitchen/hunting knife, carpenter hammer
* **Hold-&gt;power on**: Chainsaw

As you gain levels/distribute skillpoints/etc your ""wind ups"" take less time, push them back further, do more damage, use less stamina, whatever.  Can be as complex or as simple as needed.

Please, add suggestions and criticisms.  I'll try to address them as I can.  Any other ways to use melee weapons that I'm missing?"	t5_2sn4h	True

The scenario:

You're all alone, in the middle of a zombie apocalpyse. You've scrounged whatever useful materials you could find, in various ways, and now you're going to craft them into something you need....

1. What did you scrounge, and why?

2. What did you make with it, and how?

3. What are you going to use what you made for?

I've handled a variety of weapons, but I don't think I could help you guys with many of the questions you may have. However, I do know that many of those on /r/guns are devoted firearms enthusiasts, and I think they'd be willing to give you some help with if you have questions about how to design the weapons in your game (e.g., effective range, availability of that ammunition, weight, etc.).

I didn't consult with gunnit before making this post, though, so I can't guarantee its response. But from my time on that subreddit, everyone there seems very friendly and I think they'd be willing to help a brother out.

1310936253.0	is8mw	Getting crafty: Because it shouldn't have to be difficult. Also, ammo management. 	Brimshae	41	5	41	"So, people want (arts and) crafts, ammo piles and a working magazine system. 

Here's an easy way to do this. 

You have an inventory system. Use one item on another, and it performs a certain action. 

Examples: 

1&gt; Use pile of pistol ammo on (partially) empty pistol magazine

---- Reduce rounds in pile by (pistol_magazine_capacity - pistol_magazine_ammo_count)

---- Set pistol_magazine_ammo_count == pistol_magazine_capacity

2&gt; Use hand* on partially empty pistol magazine  

---- Increase rounds in pile by pistol_magazine_ammo_count

---- Set pistol_magazine_ammo_count == 0 

* I got this idea from the now mostly-defunct mmo [RPWGO](http://www.rpgwo.com/). It had a ""use hand"" command that acted as sort of a ""use in inventory"" button. It was used to activate/deactivate items in your inventory, as well as eat and drink items. 

3&gt; Use scrap cloth on bottle of booze

---- Remove booze, remove rag

---- Give molotov. 

4&gt; Use toolbox on (broken item)

----Repair item (increase durability)

----Reduce toolbox durability

5&gt; Use hand on medkit/first aid box/pile of bandages/etc. 

---- Heal player

6&gt; Use hammer &amp; nails on wooden bat

---- [Nailbat](http://www.google.com/search?q=nailbat)

7&gt; Use FAK on FAK

---- Combine first aid kits

---- If FAK_durability &gt; 100%, set one to 100%, and the other to whatever is left

--See: Jagged Alliance 2's system for merging items

8&gt; Use sewing kit on [cloth item]

---- Repair item

9&gt; Use lighter/box of matches/flint block on tinder/fire pit/fire place/BBQ grill

----Light fire. 

This system streamlines crafting and item use, makes it fairly modifiable, and can be used for just about any number of tasks. 

If a modder wanted to add a recipie for a new item, you would add its ingredients (example: hammer+nails &amp; wooden_bat), and its resultant (nailbat).

------

When the last news station went off the air two weeks ago a sense of finality settled over him. Just months prior his life had been *normal*, *repetitive*, and dare he say it, *boring*. Like everyone else he looked towards his future with a longing expectation, hoping something life-changing would happen to him. He didn't necessarily know what that something was, but he expected it to come eventually.

The almost imperceptible static from his radio added a white noise to the dimly lit cellar. He found it the only way he could bring himself to sleep anymore. During his lonely days he would have spent the whole night searching for a signal. Now he felt content to listen to the static and use it to drown out the occasional scream in the distance.

Across the dirt floor he organized the remains of his food stores: a couple cans of green beans, three jugs of water, some dried peaches, and a chocolate bar he lovingly nibbled on when things were at their worst. Somewhere above him he heard footsteps stumble across the wooden floorboards. He leaned over and twisted the nobs on his radio and light, surrounding himself in a cool darkness. The footsteps were awkward and forced, like the person lacked the coordination to control their own legs. His keen ears told him it was one of them. He waited patiently in the dark.

The footsteps continued for what felt like a solid hour before they moved on. He carefully brought light and sound back into his world and gazed across the remainder of his belongings. He figured the food and water he'd be able to stretch for a week or maybe five days, but he couldn't be sure. The only things he was certain about anymore were two undeniable truths. The life he knew was over forever and tomorrow was moving day.

# (Edit: update 1)


He awoke from his nap and slowly drew back into his daily routine. The hand-crank radio, and light, had wound down hours prior and lay against his side for easy access. The darkened cellar he called home, made it nigh impossible to accurately judge the hour. But hours to him were boiled down to  primal notions. The light, where he could briefly expose himself to the outside world with a low risk of contact, and *feeding time*, where whether it be a stormy sky, or night, *they* were everywhere. He notioned that the coolness had something to do with their increase in activity. He liked to surmise and postulate different theories as to why *they* were here and why world plunged into the dark-ages again, where man feared most his fellow man. He figured it was important to keep thinking, to keep planning. After-all, he may be the only one left on the planet doing such things.

He turned the crank dial on his light over a few times and gave thanks to the glorious find. Plucked from the hands of a dead girl on Route 32 he didn't give a moments thought to adding it to his supplies. The radio he brought with him all the way from his house appeared in the periphery of his vision. It initially saved him when he heard the tail end of a report that they were spotted in the town next to his. He grabbed a backpack and some food, then sprinted out to his car. There he had his first encounter with one of them. An old neighbor of his, sitting atop his car, hunched over the remains of his dog, pulling the sinewy flesh into his mouth by great handfuls. He sprinted until his legs burned and his lungs failed, but he made it.

In his new home, he adjusted his light and opened up the book “*Survivor*.” He'd found the book in an old camper and thumbed through to the last chapter. Initially, he hoped it would contain some essential tips on how to live off the land, but instead turned out to be a work of fiction written to poke fun at the media personalities dominating the television. How trivial all of those things seemed today. After a little reading, he double checked all of his supplies and categorically placed them into his backpack - all a part of his routine.

The *routine* is what he truly owed his salvation. When all of those around him were losing their heads (quite literally) he'd taken stock in his ability to prepare. Bouncing from town to town he selected the bare essentials from each stop. He listened, and learned, and with each passing day he understood what it meant to be a true *survivor*. He liked to call himself *Survivor Zero*. It was his own little play on words. He believed that to the world around him he was now invisible, a figure which, even when the last human on Earth fell, when the last person was gone, would still remain, because *he* didn't exist. He was nothing. He was zero impact.

With his backpack slung over him, he punched out his thirty pushups in the dark, then stretched his legs. The latch above him creaked open as he pushed back the heavy door. Through practice he could almost smell them by now, and when his head peered over the edge of his hole, he let his nostrils fill with the familiar smell of blood, new, but not *fresh*. He crawled from the dark and shielded his eyes from the sun. *Today will be a good day*, he thought and strolled out into the field.

(Edit 2)

Crispy August grass crunched under the soles of his running shoes. In the distance, a burned out city smoldered against the blue skyline. Twisted plumes of smoke rose up to the clouds as the last of the buildings succumbed to the steady blaze. The smell of rotted flesh occasionally invaded his nose from a wayward breeze. 

He kept his eyes on the tree-line as he chewed on a long piece of grass. He knew it only took being spotted by one of *them* to bring hundreds more and that could spell disaster if he weren't prepared. The walking did offer a therapeutic release from the claustrophobic existence he now lived. It also heightened his greatest asset – his legs. Oh sure, you might see someone in the movies go toe to toe with a bloodthirsty hell-spawn and live to tell about it, but that didn't fly in the real world. Try getting yourself in a fight with fully grown, bat-shit insane adult and get away without a scratch. It's like jumping into a river and not getting wet. So when it comes down to brass tacks, you'd better get your butt in gear and haul ass.

The sun beat down on him and a few wispy clouds reached across the sky. He took a swig from his water jug and hitched it back to his belt. No sooner had he swallowed when he saw a man burst through the tree line. The man kept looking behind him and moments later a group of undead chased out into the field. The man tripped and fell, face-first into the ground. His screams abated shortly after they piled on him and a throaty gurgle marked his final word. 

*Stupid shit, you never look back when you run. Only way to run is eyes forward, feet stable and arms pumping*. Zero thought, having safely retreated to the trees.

A ways later he crossed over a road. Keeping to the side, he followed it far enough to see a town where he hoped to build another hold out. But first he eyed a cop car, partially ditched into the weeds. He might find something useful in it, so he stashed his pack amongst the trees and carefully crept toward it. His footfalls against the blacktop left a weary feeling in his gut. *You're not supposed to take chances.* But the payoff might be worth the risk.

At the rear of the cop car he found a man propped against the door. The man's face was blistered from extended exposure to the sun. In his lap the man held a black-gripped pistol. 

If the man were still alive, and he woke him, he might end up shot out of panic. And if the man were one of them he might end up bitten. He didn't like it. But a gun was like gold and they were few and far between. With his feet set to run he silently reached for the pistol. A swift grasp loosed it from the man's grip.

The man's head swung back as Zero steadied the pistol.

“Shoot me...” the man said in a voice just above a whisper.

*Bullets are rare.*

“Please... do it.”

*I might need the shot later on.*

“I'm begging you.”

Zero returned to the woods and retrieved his pack, walking up to where the man lay against the car. He leveled his arm and capped off one round to the man's head. *Gotta make sure this shit works.* He jogged into the trees heading in the direction of town.

This is the first time I’ve ever done game networking work, but Unity has been abstracting most of the ‘real’ work away, which has made things tremendously easier.  I’ll be keeping this post fairly non-technical so that:

* Non-coders can hopefully understand what’s going on

* There are much more qualified people to write tech documents on networking than I

My cleanup has revolved around our Player object, with the ultimate goal of making it entirely self-contained.  The Player object (as it is defined now) stores things like health, inventory, stats, and other things of that nature.  The real issue was that many early parts of the code were written ‘assuming’ that there would only be one player in any given game.  This was done mostly to get proof of concept code roughed out before polishing and improving on it.

The fix was to remove all of the areas where the player was strictly defined and change it so anything could be assigned to different player objects.  Essentially this came down to assigning an owner to things that needed accessed by a player.  This essentially came down to changing…

    Magazines = GetMagazines(TheWorld.GameState.ThePlayer.PlayerInv);

to

    Magazines = GetMagazines(owner.PlayerInv);

(taken from one of our weapons classes)

After changing issues similar to this, the Player object was at a point where it could be arbitrarily spawned any number of times without breaking things.  After completing this, I was led to try my hand at…

Networking!  While the networking portion specifically is currently not ready for prime time, it is at least in a functional state.  An authoritative server was implemented, which means that a client player sends their inputs (button presses) to the server, the server executes those inputs, and finally sends the results to all of the other clients.  Using this method (as opposed to letting the players tell the server what should be happening) helps ensure that a bugged/rogue client can’t send wrong data to all of the other players.

Unity has made networking way easier than it should be.  Their API lets developers spend more time on game code, and less time implementing networking logic.  A few of us tested the system by playing run and jump around a digital field with someone on another continent.  The experience was…rather choppy to say the least…  The current implementation gives the clients almost no trust in the communication chain, meaning every client needs to wait for the server to send the results of their input.  This issue will hopefully be solvable by using something called client side prediction.

Client side prediction is giving some trust back to the player who is pressing inputs.  How it should end up working is that when the client does something (say, press W) the client won’t wait for the sever before moving the player forward.  The server will then send the result of where the player should have moved to.  If the client correctly predicted where it should move to, then play smoothly goes on.  If the client was incorrect, the server adjusts the player until the needed correction is accounted for.

And this is where our developer’s IRC turned into a discussion about lag compensation for firing shots.  Some concepts were the Source Engine method, where the server keeps a history of where each player has been over the past second/expanding hitboxes based on distance, movement speed, and lag/trusting the clients to correctly state whether or not they hit something/implementing all of these and having each method adjustable.

But we’ll be getting to THAT hurdle soon enough, first I need to fix everything I have broken while making these changes.  Look forward to our next blog post, in which Darkfrost will be describing how to maintain a healthy sleep schedule."	t5_2sn4h	True

The Design team's also seriously grinding out ideas and questions and answers and working up concepts and throwing them out and kicking them back in and getting closer and closer to figuring out where I might have left my wallet. And also, we're working on the game. Milestones and spec sheets are being written up and reviewed on a pretty consistent basis. Our design discussions are being recorded more in Google Docs than anything and occurring somewhere in the spaces between the margins if not on IRC. If anything, this interruption wasn't an interruption so much as it was a refocusing on our resources and revisit to our development philosophy.

For reference, I'll just be using Fallout3 / FO:NV as a benchmark. Also, you can skip the paragraphs in italics, and jump down a bit if you want to save yourself some reading.

*My big problem with Fallout, is that simply put, you can't reverse the apocalypse and damage of the world you're in. You walk through the world, you see blown up buildings, burnt out cars strewn across highways. Piles of debris everywhere you go and general disorder.*

*Now obviously you're not going to pick up a hammer yourself and set to work fixing every problem you see. In a game like Fallout, it'd literally take you months to manually restore even a small sector of the map to working order (assuming everything is linear). My big gripe, is that almost the entire point of sandbox games, is to craft the game as you see fit, normally through influence and moral based gaming. In Fallout, you can chose to save dozens of individuals, towns, cities and organisations from whatever calamity that is befalling them, through the quest system. At the end of this, they shake your hand, give you some money, and they'll greet you a little nicer in future conversations. That's about it. When you leave, all NPC's just go back to their hovels, stand in corners, or flail around on the ground with disease.*

*I say, YUNOPICKUPHAMMER? If you can effectively influence a significant number of individuals, why not put them to work (allocate them) to fixing things?*

____________
From this point on, I'm talking directly of ideas for this game.

Backstory aside, let's just assume that you start the game in a ~semi safe location. Actually, that doesn't even matter, any location at all. But certain areas of the map are known to be safe, this can be discoverable through conversation with NPC's, writings on walls, following candy on the ground etc. In safe zones (zones can be camps, towns, cities, forests, drilling platforms etc.) you are basically safe from contact with zombies, you're also less likely to come in contact with unsavory NPC's, and basically you don't have to be on your guard. 

Through quests, conversations, bribing, hiring, whatever, you should be able to form yourself from an individual, into a collective/entity/business/organisation/party etc. What you wish to do with your muscle is completely up to you. Wanna purge the town you're currently in and loot what remains, DO IT. Some rival faction over the river giving you strife? It's WARRRR. After you kill their camp, move in and take over. Either rule the new camp, or put a party member in as a de-facto ruler in your stead. Maybe you're a pacifist, so rather than take over existing buildings and towns and camps, you opt to build yourself a brand spanking new holdout/fortress, maybe you build it from scratch, or you just do up an existing abandoned/rundown school you walked past. It's all up to you. 

Now, I'd rather that people don't jump on this straight away and say IT'LL NEVER WORK BECAUSE... Don't do that, help me refine this. Add ideas, things you think could make this manageable. For instance, you might ask, how the hell would you build an entire town from scratch in a world where you don't even know where your next drink of water is coming from? What I'd LOVE to see, is an economics system similar to that employed in the game Mount and Blade. Rather than you grinding resources yourself, towns/cities/camps etc. trade independently. You may indirectly influence what is traded with whom, but prices, quantity, and actual items are simply determined moved around in trading caravans which operate on their own. If you have influence with an existing city, maybe you can get that city to start sending a trading caravan to where you wish to build your new fortress. As a result, lumber, concrete, aluminium sheeting etc. gets shipped out to the area. Your workers than fabricate whatever it is you want. The degree of influence you have with cities determines just how much resource they're willing to send out. Small influence = small amount of resources = long construction times = zombies will slowly kill your people are they build shit.

I can keep going on and on and on about how I'd like to see this game, but I won't keep writing unless actual staff members are interested, it'd be folly otherwise.

In a nutshell, look at the following image:
[img]http://upit.cc/images/1dccf8a2.png[/img]
This is a global map. Dark green = very safe areas. Light green = pretty safe areas. Yellow = Unsafe zombie land. Dark red = motherfucking zombie death traps. White zones are unscouted or just unknown areas. 

To help push those zombies back, you should be able to use your followers to construct stuff in zones. As a result, zombies around where you've built a new fortress get slowly killed off (humans = kill zombies). Slowly but surely you push those zombies back into ever increasing unknown and crazy areas of the world!


Thoughts/ideas/should I stop writing this and get back to writing my essay on Strategic Management for my uni course? (hint: probably, it's due in 12 hours).

*edit* Something I should have mentioned, depending on your influence/how well your new bases are going, other survivors may start to rock up and take up residence in them. At first only the dregs will roll in, than maybe a shop keeper (more places to buy and sell stuff), than maybe some mercenaries will offer to work for free (so long as you provide them with a place to sleep, and food to eat). Stuff like this etc.

Logically too, if you set up an outpost in the middle of Zombieville, you're going to be hard pressed to find a caravan that'll come out to you. Like wise, very few people would ever be able to GET to your new outpost in the first place. Stuff like this is what I would LOVE to see in the game. It'd make it so super awesome.

Taking slow breath in and letting slow breath out, there was silence. He let a few minutes pass as he sat on his heels. Eyes closed, he reached out to grasp the handle of his knife and squeezed tight, letting the man's last moments replay in his mind. It had been a necessary death. His last exhale finalizing the thought, he stood to examine the woman. He turned her over, her face locked in a grimace of pain and confusion, and closed her eyes. There was no sign of anything but burglary and murder. Hers had been an unnecessary death. Moving her arms to her side, he looked toward the man. Entirely opposite from the woman, yet eerily similar in expression, Rev knew he had killed himself, that Rev was only the implement of destruction. It was a place in the world Rev regretted, but he had spent too many moments in his life regretting things he had no choice in. It was simply his place and he would bear it. He picked the man's knife off the floor and walked back into the kitchen.

Taking a towel from the oven handle, he turned on the sink faucet and began washing their blades. There would be plenty more blood to come. It was time to get rid of what he could while he had the chance.
*****

Mac glanced up at the sun, bright and clear and, from its height over the horizon, about 1:00. The late summer day had been quite cool, but his head ran warm with anxiety from staring at the bright pink house across the street. The fires at the end of the road had begun to run out of fuel and a few dead had come back his way. Being out of their sight and keeping low, however, he knew Rev still had a little while before they needed to make plans for the night, but it would have to be soon. He tried to will his eyes to see through the thick flower print curtains that draped behind the porch windows, but he knew he would just have to wait.
*****

Dropping one last can of food into his bag, Rev slung it back over his shoulder. Vegetables, peanut butter, and preserves, they'd appreciate the nutrition later.  He removed a small, ringed, metal cord and a plastic grocery bag and stuffed them into his pants pocket, then cinched the bag tight. Moving back into the room, he solemnly approached the woman's body and knelt. Placing his hands under her knees and back, he lifted and carried her through the side hall toward the master bedroom. The bed was unmade and clothes littered the floor and furniture, but among them lay dozens of empty photo frames. Her bed, however, was covered in their wrinkled and worn contents, ranging from obvious digital camera prints to sepia-toned childhood photos. Glancing over them for a moment, he saw the people that meant the most and could see that under the frazzled hair, there used to be a kind and curious intensity - something he'd felt since seeing the ornaments she'd kept in the yard. She had many photos of time spent travelling, but there was one face, very much like her own, present in nearly all of them. Through varying technologies and resolutions, the photos told the story of the boy's growth into a kind looking man, and in the photo nearest to her pillow, he was just a little boy, feigning anger over a kiss on the cheek from his mother. Taking the photo in hand, he flipped it over. ""Troy - 7 - Big Bear"" had been written on the back in purple pen with wide flourishes. Rev's smile widened a little as he took the photo and set it in her hand, resting it over her heart. ""You got good company, ma'am"" he said, straightening her shawl and setting her open hand comfortably against the other, ""good luck."" He straightened up, and bowing his head, he took one last long breath, covered her with her quilt, stepped back into the hall, and shut the door.

Allowing the peace to settle for a moment, he moved back into the living room and approached the front windows. Pushing the curtains aside and looking out, it seemed nothing was out there to spot him except for Mac. He peered up to the porch, nodded, and walked back through the room to a small, packed hutch of envelopes and Christmas cards. Kneeling to filter through the scrap-filled trash can, he found several bills unpaid -- simply thrown away -- and encountered more than one ""Final Notice"" creditor envelope before coming upon a recent postmark from upstate on a bright purple ""Happy Birthday!"" envelope - the addressor: ""Troy O'Neill"". He folded the envelope and zipped it away into his bag before walking back to the body of the man to begin his work.
*****

It was a relief to see Rev's face in the window. Rev always told him to practice patience when he could, and the reassuring moments always seemed to help. ""Baby steps,"" he'd said. It took that same patience to wait the few more minutes for the front door to open, but when it did, Rev stepped out, carrying a man's body by its wrist and the only foot it had. Its head was crumpled onto its chest and left a trail of blood over the concrete steps. Mac leaned up to see more clearly and could only tell that it had been a while since the man's last shower and that Rev's white shirt clearly showed small flecks of blood while the man was positively covered in it. Looking up to the porch, Rev nodded again, and subtly lifted a hand into the air, quickly rotating it in a ""turn around"" motion. Mac felt his heart rise into his throat and started to turn, but met Rev's gaze and shook his head slightly, steadying himself as Rev nodded, dropped the man's body to the grass, and bent over, slashing open his femoral arteries and the inner part of his biceps. As Rev lifted the man's arm, it was then that Mac saw the man's head flop backwards slightly, unrestrained by tendons, forcing blood out forward onto his chest. Mac swallowed hard, but resisted the urge to turn away, knowing it was better he learn. Once Rev had made the major cuts, he put his foot on the man's chest and pushed his weight onto it, forcing more blood into the grass. When as much blood as Rev felt was useful had been spilled onto the lawn, he straightened up again and glanced back up at the porch.

Mac was pale, but stared back intensely. In that gaze, Rev saw the man that Mac could become if this world didn't kill him first. He felt proud. And for the first time in a long time, he felt the sting of regret that he had something to look forward to."	t5_2sn4h	True

1322434638.0	mra1k	"Is it feasible to have a ""clan/militia"" system implemented?"	ChimpsAhoy	27	5	7	"In a real apocalyptic situation, there would be bands of militias roaming the streets. I think it would be interesting to allow players to gain the opportunity of starting/joining a survival band, whose goals and play style can vary greatly. It would allow players to pool their resources to create larger, more sophisticated bases (wouldn't it be cool to have a reservoir of purified water and a long range radio antenna for private use within your band?)

Since this game is open-ended, these bands could have wildly different ways of playing the game, allowing somebody with a particular play style to create a larger impact with groups of people they can easily cooperate with. One could find paramilitary ""Z-Squad"" militias, whose combat-based members would focus on exterminating  zombies. Or perhaps a player could join a sinister cult and become a dangerous obstacle to other survivors. Imagine exploring an abandoned building and finding a candle-lit shrine in the basement, the hidden gathering place of said cult.

Turf wars would inevitably ensue, with rival bands vying for control of generators, gas stations, and outposts. Lone wolves could take advantage of this discord, while many would join them to have somebody watching your back. The awesome way this game is designed would allow for an infinite number of creative motivations for these clans, along with perhaps the totally malleable development of a backstory behind this open-ended game.

tl;dr: Having the option of joining/starting clans in the game could have a huge and interesting impact on the way it's played."	t5_2sn4h	True

This may have been posted/asked already but my google/search fu is weak and I couldnt find anything.

The obvious ones would be:
Zombies seen, zombies killed, zombies evaded, survival time (how long you survived before becoming a human happy meal) etc.

Some other stats would be interesting as well, like mean time between zombie sightings (How well you are hiding/surviving), effectiveness of your zombie fortifications (How long it takes to damage/destroy) etc.

If these stats and others could be published to a leaderboard type website (optional maybe) it could generate some fun competition between players and add a little to the replay factor.

Zombie health, zombie awareness, ammo rarity, weapon density, zombie density. And you just slide those up and down to create the world you want to play in. 

How many of these options and what they are of course, is up to the devs. I know implementing them all could suck, but I think being able to choose between stronger zombies and weapon rarity would be nice. I'd like a game of dumb zombies but scarce resources, and some people want strong zombies but lots of guns to make it harder for them.  

This also creates the possiblities for game modes such as ""see how long you can survive in hella bad zombie world"" and even the proverbial ""run and gun"" but also allows the player to set up the perfect world for him/her, where zombies aren't too bad, and weapons are lying just the right distance apart.

I know that all of the ones on the website take place after society has collapse, but I hope you don't mind if mine is during the SHTF phase. It also takes place in Savannah, Georgia, I city I'm pretty familiar with.*

It was time to go home. Alex had been hanging around downtown Savannah all afternoon, unsure where to go or what to do. He was supposed to meet a friend of his from Jacksonville, Florida visiting for the weekend, but that was three hours ago. He hadn't responded to any of Alex's phone calls, and now his phone was practically dead. He sat down on a bench and wondered if the sickness scared him from coming.

Alex himself was a wary man. He had a sizable amount of canned goods, water purifiers, a diesel generator, and the like at his house for hurricanes or other disasters. When he had heard of the virulent disease blowing through the country he had expected a lot of people to be riled up. As such he had debated whether even coming into Savannah today or not. But it had been so long since he had seen Darren, not since college, and Alex ultimately decided to go. He was coming to regret that.

The streets were a veritable ocean of worried people, wondering what was happening, what could possibly have warranted men with military-grade equipment shutting down Yamacraw Village and the other subsidized housing neighborhoods in the city. Based on the gas masks, it was pretty obvious that it was disease-related. Despite his hatred of the concept of martial law, he ceded that the worries were pretty founded. Media outlets gave startling numbers of deaths, so many that the CDC had blocked coverage of the disease and ordered a blackout on all statistics concerning it, freedom of the press be damned.

The last thing Alex needed was to be stuck in a city under siege by the National Guard from Fort Stewart. He had been here long enough anyway...Darren wasn't coming. Alex put on a dust mask and started making his way through the city blocks. Downtown Savannah, the touristy area, was nice but God help you if you went into the wrong part of town at night. He wondered what the crime rate would be tonight. He was making his way to River Street, where he could have a straight walk down to the other end of the historic district to where his car was in the parking garage.

The closer he got to the river, the more people there were. More cars, more people. He wondered what the big deal was. A little child bumped into him. He looked down. It was little boy with sandy blonde hair and big eyes, no more than three. Alex smiled at the kid before his mother picked him back up and glared at Alex. He heard her tell her child, ""Stay with mommy, we'll be on the boat in just a little while, okay?"" Alex was bewildered. A boat? There were river boats that gave tours, but that didn't attract this many people at this time of day. What did they expect, that they could just get a ride out of the city on some guy's boat docked on River Street?

If that's what this was all about, Alex was glad he had gotten a concealed carry permit when he turned 21. Not in the eight following years had he ever needed to use, much to his relief. But today...today could be different. A lot of desperate people in a very small area was a recipe for disaster. He tried to stop a man who passed him. ""Why is everybody heading to the river?"" Alex asked him as the man continued to walk at a brisk pace. He wanted to be sure of the situation.

""The Guard says that they have reports coming in giving an indication that the disease has broken their quarantine. They want to lock down the whole district."" The man slowed, but he didn't stop. Alex had to follow to hear the entire explanation.

A sense of dread filled him. He was not going to be trapped and put in some FEMA camp with the others. He didn't *need* to go to River Street to make it to the parking garage...the parking garage. That place was going to be congested as hell in just a few minutes. He needed to get there quickly. Taking a right when he reached the next block, Alex continued on his way perpendicular to the rush of people, but few people were going in his direction. He felt confident. As long as he wasn't trapped in a crowd, he had a decent chance to get out of the city. But his heart quickly sank when he saw what was ahead.

Two humvees blocked the street ahead, with multiple troops milling about clashing with civilians. Alex had no doubt that this wasn't the only road block on the street-- odds are it stretched all the way down, perpendicular to the river. There was only one possibility to get to his car, and that was if the people at River Street had so thoroughly crowded it that it would be impossible for troops to cut it off. Alex turned back around and made his way to the nearest set of steps that would take him down there. As he neared one, he heard shouts and screams coming from the top of the stairs, and a mob of people pushing all about it. He wondered what was going on. Normally he wouldn't care, but this wasn't a normal day.

As he pushed his way to view the scene, he saw the cobbled street by the stairs slick with blood. Apparently a fight had broken out at the top of them, because there was a man clutching his head in a fetal position off to the side, and two crumpled bodies were at the base of the steps. He could see farther down the tide of bodies crammed all the way to the river, glittering in the late afternoon sun. The scene of surprising violence must have been off-putting to many of those people, but Alex's intent to get the hell out of a city that would be on fire by sundown was greater than theirs. Watching his step (not only from the blood-- the two men had broken the old railing on their way down), he kept close to the rough-hewn stone on the right side of the stairs and made his way down to the old brick street. 

Whenever he came down here, to this street that had been a part of the city for hundreds of years, he always wondered what kind of people had walked it before him: pirates, slaves, and British sailors. This time was no different. His mind came to the epidemic of Spanish influenza that had plagued the state nearly 100 years ago, and all of the infected that had walked this street. He wondered about all of the infected that would be walking it tonight. Alex adjusted his dust mask and made his way farther on, taking a right, back on his path. Even up here, away from where the boats were docked, it was still packed enough to give a claustrophobic a panic attack. People were elbow to elbow, and not a boat in sight. ""Good luck with that,"" Alex muttered under his breath to everyone who had looked for a quick fix. No doubt when they realized that this was hopeless, they would be more than happy to turn 180 degrees into the loving arms of the Georgia National Guard. He pushed on, closer to his destination.

But to his dismay, once again, his path was cut off by men in BDU's and gas masks. They were filtering down from the street above and into the throng of people, trying to break up the throng of people. Good luck with that. Civilians outnumbered them to a laughable degree here. If Alex kept low, he could just slip by, with hardly anything more than a touch on the shoulder from these troops. He, however, was one of the lucky few that found himself face to mask with one of the growing number of Guard forces.

""Don't go any farther!"" the man said through the mask.

""I haven't heard any news about Savannah being declared in a state of emergency, what gives you the right to say that?"" Alex said back, raising his voice to be heard against the background noise of yelling, arguing, and babies crying.

The man's response was grabbing Alex when he tried to shove past. His hands went down to Alex's belt and found the .40 Springfield that Alex kept as a concealed weapon. The soldier hefted his rifle but didn't point it at Alex. ""Hand over the weapon slowly,"" he told him. Alex stared at him for a moment, not doing anything.

""You don't have that authority,"" Alex said after the soldier's order was repeated. His heart was racing. The soldier pointed the rifle at him. People were knocking into him from the left and right, and other soldiers were starting to file in. If he waited any longer, there would be no way to get to the parking garage. He reached his hand under his jacket, to where the holster was fitted on the inside of his pants.

""Slowly,"" the soldier reminded him. Alex gripped the weapon and took it out of the holster, carefully bringing it out and holding it in front of the soldier.

""Now hand it over and put your hands on your head. The district is under quarantine and we need to get things organized,"" the soldier explained. Alex held his hand out to give it to him.

Then he shoved it under the soldier's chin and pulled the trigger.

The poor guy didn't even have the chance to see it coming. His body immediately dropped to the ground like a ton of bricks. It took a second for the crowd to react to the sound, but when it did, the sound flooded across the street. Screams and cries ""Gunshot!"" came from everywhere, and the soldiers to Alex's right, where there was now a sizable poised to block off the rest of River Street, were running forward guns readied. They were met by a wall of people whose hysteria must have been broken by the show of resistance and now they were openly combating with their captors. Others, however, moved to grab Alex and bring him to justice.

This entire time he had been staring down at the body. The man he had killed. The one who had just been doing his job. Well, Alex was just doing his. Or was that justification? Adrenaline coursed through his body and when he saw that others were coming for him, he ran. As fast as he could through the crowd of people, shoving past man and woman alike, barreling over some in the process. He had to leave the scene as quickly as possible. Hopefully in this mess of a situation, they wouldn't recognize who he was. Behind him, he began to hear more gunshots. Then automatic gunfire.

Just a few more strides, and he would be off of the streets and, God willing, in a less crowded part of the city. But that was wishful thinking. People were coming his direction, and not necessarily to get him. There were droves of terrified people trying to get away from the violence that was breaking out all around him. In under an hour, the entire city would be given to roaming militias, and no germ or virus was as scary to Alex as a desperate human being.

He had no idea what this disease did to those it infected. Nobody did, except those who witnessed it firsthand. No, Savannah was about to be given to something far worse than looters. Already, closer to the projects, hungry moans could be heard above the sounds of gunfire and screams.

1311688034.0	j059d	Instead of L4D's different kind of zombies...	phiniusmaster	17	3	33	"Once the game is all working well and human zombies are well implemented, the following could solve a couple of problems. A: occasional variation in gameplay, B: getting rid of those piles of undead corpses that are sure to pile up in game and in your RAM eventually. Having different species of zombies to fight against and to roam the streets, consuming your fallen foes to get rid of their bodies in a more fun, tactical, and immersive manner.

**Types of Zombies:**
Adult - by far the most common, many different clothes, fat, skinny, tall short (this has been discussed numerous times here before)
Teen - like adult but slightly smaller, different face presets.
Kid - even smaller, harder to hit, climb onto stuff like tables and stuff more often, not quite as fast as adult or teen.
Child - even smaller, even more hard to hit, energetic but still a bit slower movement, good at climbing up poles or through small spaces. That barricade might keep big things out, but what about the little guys?
Bird - a couple of different species of birds, would mainly roam in packs, feeding on corpses as a mechanic for getting rid of bodies, wouldn't usually attack the player.
Dog - very fast, bites almost always cause lethal infection, have maybe ~5 types, each one varying quite a bit in size.

1351799822.0	12h3al	Stories of Survival: Week 8 - Plateau	Cpt_Steam	23	10	1	"&gt;This is the third installment of Robert's story. Here is Part 1 and Part 2. You can also read this episode on the website [here](http://s-ze.ro/SzPIDn).

Robert came to and solemnly realized that he was not dead.

He pushed himself up off the bedroom floor and licked his dry lips. The sun was already high enough to stop throwing shadows across the room and a staleness hung throughout the house. He drank an entire glass of water from the kitchen before going to the breezeway and locking the front door. He slid the bolt into the frame as noiselessly as he could manage, and did the same for the door to the patio. Then he went back upstairs and turned the water on in the bath. It was cold, and wasn't getting any hotter, so he plugged the drain and left while the tub slowly filled up.

He opened the bedroom closet but did not see any of his clothes. Evelyn must've tossed them out or donated them a long time since. There was just an abundance of dresses and shoes; unfamiliar items sprawled across a familiar space. He spent a long time rifling through the closet. What he was looking for had not yet reached the forefront of his mind, but he continued to search, confident that he would know it when he saw it. Whatever it was, it wasn't in the closet, so he returned to the bathroom.

Placing his dirty clothes on the counter, Robert stepped into the tub.The water was just under room temperature and Robert felt his hair go on end as the cold ran up his body. He forced himself down into the water, and lay with his head beneath the rushing water. A clear, icy waterfall pounded down on him, straight from melted snow. When the tub was full Robert turned off the water, took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He remained still, listening to the sound of the water lapping against the porcelain tub.

He was beside a lake on a quiet summer morning. Low level fog hung inches above the glassy surface, creating an ethereal plateau which stretched all the way to the conifers at the edge of the universe. From some unseen perch a loon ushered forth its soluble song which mixed with the sound of water ebbing gently against the mossy dock. He was young, he hadn't even met Evelyn yet, and his mind was wrapped thick in philosophy.

The misty plane that stretched out before him was his future, and out of it rose jobs, loans, car payments, and a million other objects of dread. But there was also the lady of the lake, some unknown woman lying in wait, ready to rise out and meet him. He watched as his peers jumped into boats around him and paddled quickly into the future. Robert remained still, watching the way they disrupted the quiet; disrupted the present.

The water in the tub felt warm to him now, and Robert held his breath as he submerged his head beneath the water. With his eyes closed, and the water filling his ears, Robert felt removed from the world. He was in a place with no ex wife, no dead daughters, no ungodly shamblers.

He was entirely alone.

A startling thought came over Robert, one that pulled him back into the world in an instant. He realized that something could be in the bathroom, standing above him, and he would have no way of knowing. He sat up quickly and slammed his forehead against the faucet. Blood seeped down into the bathwater. Stepping out of the bath he grabbed a towel and pushed it against his head. He pulled it back a moment later to examine it and found it drenched with blood. He looked at himself in the mirror; a deep gash ran just above his left eyebrow. He dried off and got dressed, still pressing the towel to the wound.

Back in the bedroom Robert sat on the edge of the bed, looking around the room from beneath the towel. Evelyn had remodeled, replaced their beige wallpaper with eggshell, their dark wood moulding with a lighter one. Everything around him was as different as it was the same, like looking at the face of a friend after years apart. His eyes came to rest on the laptop left open on the desk. That great unknown he was looking for resurfaced its shapeless head.

Robert plugged the charger into the laptop and let it resume. The laptop had been left on and had powered off automatically. When it was up Robert dragged his finger across the trackpad, opening up folder after folder. He launched the mail client, and there, sitting in the outbox, waiting for an internet connection, he found it.

**Rob,** 

**I’m not sure if this will send. I’ve tried calling you but the cell towers are overloaded. Everything is going bad. It was on the news for a bit but then that went out also. Ambulances keep going by and people are packing up their cars. I’m going to my mother’s. Not sure it’ll be any better there, but I have to be with her. I know you’ll keep our girls safe. They’re probably better off with you than me right now, so I feel comfort in that. They just went by with loudspeakers. I hope you three are safe. Email me back.**

**- Evelyn**

The flow of blood had lessened, so Robert returned to the bathroom and leaned towards the mirror. The cut was deep, creating a canyon of parted skin across his forehead and he knew that if he didn’t close it up soon, it would probably get infected. He placed a washcloth against the cut and tied it in place with a teal scarf from the closet. He looked amusingly at his reflection. Dirty clothes, bleary eyes, a bearded face, a feminine scarf.

“Who did you use to be?” Robert asked of his reflection.

His reflection smiled back.

Robert decided he would stay one more night in the house. He’d make sure Evelyn’s laptop was charged, and then he’d push deeper into the city at first light. He felt he had reached the edge of the plateau, his toes were hanging over the sheer drop. He felt electric - alive. Fear was a long lost sensation.

He would keep going until he was dead.

And when he was dead, then there would be only blissful nothing."	t5_2sn4h	True

1315874435.0	kdogl	Lets brainstorm some buildings/locations for the procedural world generator!	harris5	15	1	19	"We've got a reasonably large community here, so lets harness that and force feed the devs some unsolicited ideas!

My thinking is thus: if the world is procedurally generated, there will need to be a large library of different buildings, parks, etc that fit onto standard plots of land.  What is actually in those buildings/etc. also will have to be randomly generated from a library of possible items.  Additionally, you can expect to find different types of zombies in different locations.  Doctor and patient zombies in hospitals, construction worker zombies near construction projects, swat team zombies at police stations, etc.

So with all that in mind, lets brainstorm possible buildings/locations for the map generation library, and for each of those lets think up some possible items and zombies that could be found there.  I'll start with a few examples, lets do more in the comments.

**Farm Field**

*Items:* Dead crops/edible produce/unripe produce, abandoned tractor

*Zombies:* Relatively few.  Farmer zombies?

**Police Station**

*Items:* Police radios, police cars, police batons, guns and ammunition, riot shields/armor

*Zombies:* swat team zombies (in armor), patrolmen zombies

**Bank**

*Items:* Lots of money (for what good that does you), perhaps some survivors locked in the vault, an employee breakroom with a vending machine of snacks

*Zombies:* Standard zombies, guard with a lootable pistol?"	t5_2sn4h	True

1311731608.0	j0qel	I am a professional UI/UX designer and I have some interface ideas. 		19	5	16	"I am also a 3D artist and an open source game dev, so I have practice implementing these kinds of ideas in game. 
 
 It seems to me that the key goal of this game is realism, and to that end I have a fairly radical idea. No UI overlay at all. None. 

 **Health** can be conveyed through shaders, blood loss, movement/ability penalties, and by looking down at your body to survey/fix the damage.

**Exhaustion** can be conveyed through puffing/wheezing/slowing

**Ammo** can be seen by looking at your gun and pulling out the magazine. 

**Compass**/map can be shown by looking at your hands or holding them up next to your gun. 


 I do not see why a game based on realism needs to have any form of HUD whatsoever, in the real world you don't know what percentage your health is at, you just know that your leg hurts real bad, looks like shit and you can't walk on it. You don't know that your ""exhaustion meter"" is running low, you just know that you're wincing when you breathe, you're slowing down and you're panting like a bitch. 

 Even **inventory** and **crafting** can be handled in game, without needing a UI overlay. You have a bag, it can hold things, you can give it see-through sides to simulate being able to ""feel around"" in it. You can toggle semitransparent cube grid lines to convey an idea of space constraints.  To craft, you hold one item in your left hand, another item in your right, and you use one on the other, no need for any clunky UI pulling you out of the game world. 

 To **exit the game**, you find a safe space and you go to sleep. Since it’s a persistent multiplayer world, the game goes on in real time with your character asleep in it, if your stronghold is breeched while you're asleep, you die. Perhaps it would be possible to set up an early warning system attached to an rss feed or txt message service in the real world, so you stand a chance of waking up and fending them off. 

For **global chat** we can have voice chat over radios, I would also suggest that allowing graffiti would be a great way of letting players communicate. 


The way I see it this leaves us with system settings, character management, and joining a new game. All of which could be handled through a scrapbook/organiser which is also an in game object, so that the ease of use is relative to your in game lighting situation.

 Now, there are going to need to still be some UI elements, things that are actionable will still need a glow, many of your actions will need to be mapped to keys, there will need to be hovering text overlays on some things. But all of these can be subtly done. The biggest thing is, with no UI, there will need to be a training level.  

Just think about it for a moment, a game with no health bars, no ammo count, no retreating to the safety of the inventory screen. Its all you, in the world, all the time. Any thoughts?

Second-- I know that the idea is based on very meat-and-potatoes gameplay. Do you want this for the zombies as well? In the genre, there's the one side which consists of standard people and animals, just with their flesh shredded and teeth rotting and eye sockets gaping.Then there's the side with freakish, beastly hybrid sorts.

In a world ruled by zombies one would find more shell casings than bullets.  Also if someone is not surrounded they might be able to pick their used shells.  

Lead could be found in art stores and remolded for bullets.

Gunpowder can be made with sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter.

Sulfur in the game would be found in chem labs along with other useful items.

Charcoal could be found in small quantities in art stores and in large quantities in ""Costco"" esc. places.  If necessary it could be made from scratch.

Saltpeter can be made from guano in caves or manure from cow farms, which ever is easier for the devs.

A lot of other useful things can be found in chem labs like thermite and phosphorous.  Thermite could be used to open locked steel doors that protect useful items.  phosphorous can be used to make phosphorous grenades which would distract zombies with a bright white light."	t5_2sn4h	True

A few hours after the sun had risen, Brooke felt a sort of discomfort growing inside her. She had broken from the train tracks a mile or so back and was headed down the deserted interstate towards the tall buildings in the distance. There were dirt fields on either side of the road stretching out as far as the eye could see, feeding into her desperation. Her pace quickened as she watched the bright orange specks on the side of the interstate grew into bulldozers as she approached. She hastened further, almost jogging toward the construction site that sprawled out into the dirt field.

Brooke pushed open the chain link gate at the perimeter of the site, taking care not to make too much noise as she crept inside. She spotted the bright blue beacon of abatement near a temporary building and hustled towards it, forgoing her usual triple-check of the surrounding area. She climbed inside, locked the door behind her, and, after quickly wiping the seat, dropped her pants and sat down. She had still not quite gotten used to this whole “apocalypse” thing.

Danny had been awake for a few hours now, blathering on about his usual nonsense. Brooke sat him up on her knees and smiled at the boy.

“Hi baby!” She exclaimed as she held her son, bouncing him slightly as the relief rushed through her. “You need to potty too?” She pulled his elastic to the side and took a quick whiff, feeling bitter-sweet at the lack of stench. They had found a small campsite along the train tracks with some canned beans and potatoes, so Danny would be filling the diaper any minute now. “That’s okay my little man, you take your time.” Danny began to quietly babble, slipping in a toothless grin here and there as he conversed with his mother.

“Yeah, I remember that. Daddy thought he was being funny, but we didn’t think so, did we Dan?” Brooke wiped and stood up, remembering the last time she’d been in a port-a-potty. “He just blocked the door, like we wouldn’t know it was him.” She paused for a second, smiling, thinking of Anthony leaning against the thin plastic door. Finally turning to leave, Brooke tried to push the door as it resisted. She pushed harder, shoving the man back a foot. “You’re not funny An—“ She froze as her mind snapped back to reality and all signs of Anthony washed away from the man before her. He growled and staggered forward as she slammed the door, switching the sign to “occupied” once again.

“Well that’s just fucking great, isn’t it?” Brooke sat back down on the toilet with her feet lightly pressed against the door, shaking her head, kicking herself for not following procedure. As the man battered the door and howled in the deserted construction site, Brooke sized up her sarcophagus for an exit strategy. Having been in a similar situation once before, she knew there was no way out. Her only hope was through that monster at the door.

“Alright Danny, I’m going to lay you down for just one minute, okay baby?” She set the boy down in the wide sink, wrapping up his arms in her jacket. “I’ll be back in just a second.” As soon as she turned towards the door, the wail started up from behind her as Danny screamed for his mother’s arms. The man at the door grew more forceful and another pair of hands smacked against the side, silhouetted against the wall. She knew it would be a close call, but she had to try. As she unlatched the door, another pair of hands pawed at the walls. Then another. And another.

Her stomach dropped as she locked the door again and slumped against it, letting Danny scream in the sink. “Just shut up Danny,” she mumbled to herself, head in her hands, trying to think of a way out. The monsters outside grew more and more restless with each passing second as Danny’s shriek grew more intense. “Just shut the fuck up!” She stood up and scooped her son out of the sink, wrapping him tightly in her arms as she dropped back to the floor. She rose her voice as a melody escaped her lips. “Hush little baby, don’t you cry, or mommy’s gonna toss you out to die. And if you make her do that, well, mommy’s probably going straight--”

Buckshot ripped through the plastic siding of the port-a-potty, carrying flesh inside with it. Brooke screamed, pressing Danny flat against the floor with her body, silencing him. She listened as the varied gunshots sporadically echoed through the construction site. As the last shot rang out, the deafening silence filled her ears. Brooke arched her back and looked at Danny, his eyes red and shaking with fright as she grabbed him and sat up. A moment later, a light rapping on the door made her jump.

“Anybody in there?” Brooke remained silent, her heart beating out of her chest, staring wide-eyed at the door.

A mousy voice commented, “I think they’re dead...”

After a deep sigh, the voice spoke again. “See asshole, I bet *you* killed ‘em. What did I tell you? Away from the toilet. *Away* from the toilet, Jesus Christ!” Brooke watched helplessly as a metal bar slid into the structure between the frame and the door, snapping it open as the bright light rushed inside. She covered her eyes and pulled Danny close as a hand reached out to her. “It’s okay,” the man reassured her. “You’re safe now.”"	t5_2sn4h	True

1312995929.0	jeqz6	Thoughts on field of view?		13	0	10	"So, my thoughts are this: A lot of first person games use something like 90° or 100° for the field of view. This can be easier to do and looks better because you don't have to worry about perspective issues much.

*However*, humans can see nearly 180° with peripheral vision. That's close to double. Bearing in mind that your vision from each eye overlaps quite a bit, most FPSs give you *worse* vision than being blind in one eye. Now, you can't exactly read signs at 160° off to either side, but you can see movement, and you can see well enough to tell if e.g. that's one of your teammates or a zed walking up to you.

While having a small field of view is easier to make look nice (or so I've heard), and it does add tension to games like this (because you have to look around wildly to keep aware of your surroundings), it's a very artificial sort of difficulty. There are also problems like friendly fire, as you can't see your buddy standing right next to you.

What are people's thoughts on having a (relative to other FPSs) very wide field of view? Is it feasible?

There's also the solution in Red Orchestra 2, which gives you little peripheral vision icons whenever something moves just off your screen. [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzFSBVuD-Co&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=136s)."	t5_2sn4h	True

1313122876.0	jgfyl	Team Recruitment Notice | Modeler 	Xfonic	16	2	7	"(**Team Opening |Current**)


[**Job Description**]
A modeler with experience in game design or Unity. Someone proficient and who specializes in characters. 

[**Duties and Team Functions**]
Basically we're planning on two main models. Obviously the character, and obviously zombies, and POSSIBLY NPCs down the line.

Most importantly, you would need to be Unity ready and capable of animation with an understanding of face topography. The caveat however are the zombies. The system we're planning will be explained in detail upon submission acceptance. So you need to be able to not only model clothing and other changes like these, but also set up the model to be rigged accordingly.

Please submit all inquiries to the following address:  **recruit@survivorzero.com**  

*Note All submissions will be reviewed, and if you can submit a summary of current applicable skills, an online resume or portfolio even better. We will update this posting if the position is filled to reflect that the position is no longer open. Don't fret! We won't toss your submission, we value our community, and we might have the need for help in the near future, so keep an eye here, as well as our main site forums, and our website under the Jobs section*

Meaning that for instance a user could input their zip code, SZ would then use google maps or another satellite imaging service to scope out the local. It would then use the building/landscape models you've already created to basically recreate a users surrounding area, albeit roughly. I think it would be pretty cool to simulate a map of my home town. And if users liked the idea enough maybe have it be possible to export the map and create a world creator app, something similar to valves hammer so that users could further tweak the map to a closer resemblance of their local. Users could then upload the map to either a server hosted on your own site or a fan based site. 

I think this would be a fantastic idea. And if possible users could eventually upload enough maps to the point where theoretically you (the devs) could create a custom game type where a user could essentially roam their continent, traveling from neighboring city to city. The new world areas could be loaded off the cloud. "	t5_2sn4h	True

Why not have them play as zombies untill all the humans are dead, and a server restart can happen?

This would allow the players to keep playing, and yet not require a whole restart. Also, it would probably help if whenever a player controlled zombie is killed, they get to start controlling another one somewhere else.

This would be a great way to keep player interest in one particular server/city.

for example:
  - you see a child trapped in an alley as zombies are closing in.  do you risk your safety?
  - a teary-eyed man holds his wife who's obviously been bitten.  do you kill her?  will you have to kill him?  what if he begs you to do it?
  - a hungry and lonely dog barks from the fifth floor window of an apartment complex
  - your character is very hungry, and you see a man with beef jerky.  maybe you see a kid.
  - an injured survivor keeps begging for food
  - an injured survivor asks for a bullet
  - an alcoholic keeps singing loudly, and zombies start to notice

very important: there should be no global consequence for your actions.

you save the child because it's the right thing to do.  maybe the kid likes you.  you give the injured man food, but he can't do anything to help you.   you don't get any points, and no one else in the world cares about your nobility.  or your cruelty.

rolling a shopping cart full of scavenged goodies should strain every nerve and make you check around corners before returning to the cart to push it through an intersection or past an alley.  and then when you spot a zombie along your path, it's time for a decision: forget the cart and creep home safely, or get ready to push and sprint, bringing a horde on your heels.

the extreme that could be good or bad: build a stealthy character, maybe it's possible to creep through a crowd of zombies, very slowly.  zombie-sight would make this impossible, but you could still creep behind a zombie that's distracted if you're quiet.

smell could be another proximity indicator, but there's also a time element.  perhaps if you spend a lot of time in your hideout, or frequently take the same route between two destinations, the ""human stink"" builds up and zombies will start aggregating like ants to a scent trail."	t5_2sn4h	True

Single-player we'd just go around doing our stuff. We invite a friend to play and he'd spawn in a random place. Either you talk with him through skype or MSN or he'd have to find you. But there could be a random factor where you would be connected to someone (just turn on in the options, or whatever) and neither of you would know each other. You don't like him, just DC and keep playing. In the city there would be radio stations where you could try to broadcast something, or in cop's cars somewhere around the city, to try to reach the other. In this mode the first thing you should try to find is a walkie-talkie and a radio.

This way, both of the players, without knowing each other or where they are, could comunicate and try to meet each other in the game.

The game (imo) should have a 1st person view and an optional 3rd while driving. Driving should be possible, but gas should be scarce, though. If there is a true survival mode, where you are left alone and you have to survive somehow, stuff should get saved. Where you left the cars, where you left the guns, where you left the bodies, etc. Please put guns and the ammount of them and ammo in realistic places. I don't want to enter in every apartment and find ammo for an M16 in the kitchen drawer.

If there is a country side, it should be safer in a way. Less zombies, unless you atract them someway from town, but hard to kill animal zombies, because no one expects a fucking zombie sheep flock, with a zombie rotweiller and a zombie sheppard.

Make an achievement system like WoW and every damn console game now, to keep the game insteresting while running from zombies.

Make a backpack system that limits movement depending on the amounts of bags and filled slots in them. If you have 3 backpacks or 3 shotsguns in one backpack you should be hindered.

1310701766.0	iq3mp	Living NPCs?	23235	7	1	5	"Just wondering whether you folks plan to include other living humans as well as zombies among the characters controlled by game AI. In the classic zombie apocalypse film genre, starting with *Night of the Living Dead,* the zombies are more of an environmental hazard than a real threat.

The most serious threat is the other living humans.

Characters often must cooperate with others to survive, and certainly to do well long term, but an ally is just as likely to lock the door while you're outside and then try to shoot you when you break back in due to power struggles over who runs the besieged the farmhouse. Or they might just set fire to the truck and gas pump on accident.

Then there are the straight up villains - racist cops going on a shooting spree, redneck militias, biker gangs, corrupt wannabe tyrants, and so on. There could be slave traders, terrorists using the chaos as a chance to set off a nuke, and so on. (Speaking of which - what about nuclear power plant meltdowns... how long would it take after abandonment before they all start going Fukushima/Chernobyl, but without *any* mitigation?)

And of course most of the dramatic tension in many of these stories comes from the effort to protect dependents - Ben trying to help the catatonic Barbra in the original *Night of the Living Dead,* pregnancy and motherhood in both versions of *Dawn of the Dead,* the main character of *The Walking Dead* trying to protect his family while the other characters are adopting orphans, falling in love, and so on. You could start out with one or more dependents, or pick them up along the way. You could recruit followers, who you would then also need to protect but might be a bit less helpless and more useful than dependents.

It might facilitate gameplay to have occasional wandering traders (as in *Fallout 3)* or trading posts. These could be simple and straightforward, or as complex as Bartertown from *Thunderdome.*

There could be factions that you could join, work for, fight, rob, temporarily ally with, and so on, similar to the groups in *The Walking Dead:* The Governor's town, the prisoners, the families in the camp outside Atlanta, the cannibals, and so on.

With sufficient complexity, you could spy, pit groups against one another to the benefit of yourself or your third group, and so on. You could take leadership roles within groups, betray them, and so on. That level of politics, especially involving game AI, may be more ambitious than your plan, but it would be awesome.

Very exciting idea, folks. Whether or not you plan to incorporate living NPCs, best of luck to you all."	t5_2sn4h	True

The amount of melee weapons, and the ability to make makeshift weapons from Resident Evil Outbreak was great. I'd like to see something like that in Survivor Zero. Maybe with a crafting system too. Nailgun + baseball bat = Bat with a nail through it. Newspaper + alcohol = molotov, etc.

I'd also prefer slow, shambling zombies (Classical survival horror) with high HP that you can actually evade, rather than hordes of fast zombies with low HP (Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil 4, 5.)

I really like the stronghold system in Urban Dead, as well. When you barricade a place, it takes hours to days for zombies to break in, depending on how skilled you are at barricading. Although it's a text based, basic GUI MMO, it has a good open world feel to it. 

I'd like to see players lose their inventories when they die, leaving them wherever they died. There would be incentive for people to barricade a building, and also incentive for scavenging the city, granted the servers never crash, so the loot will stay around.

If there are vehicles, I hope fuel is such a scarce thing, that you can only use vehicles for life or death situations.

The creation of gangs / clans / units would be really cool too. As a group, you will be able to hold down buildings easier, and fight resistance groups. (Looters, player killers)

I understand the idea of durability for most items and how things will degrade, and im sure since Survivor Zero will have a construction system there will be durability and the ability to repair your items to some extent. But my thought is about metal items such as lead pipes, crowbars and wrenches. In Dead Island they decay pretty darn fast for being something made out of solid steel. I dont know if in Survivor Zero this will be true as well, but I am hoping not. If finding a crowbar is a rarer thing to make up for its higher durability I'd be perfectly alrigth with that, but what I really hope not to see is something made of solid steel degrade after 4 or 5 zombies. It is pretty unrealistic. So what are everyones thoughts on this?

This would allow a lot of positions and such to be sent to everyone with a little amount of data (just pass a seed for each area). At the same time it wouldn't require a manual hand on every single part of the environment which allows for much more scalability.

As for cities, population sizes could be specified for each one, which would dictate how many zombies, how big the city is, how many houses there are, if there are apartments, malls, big stores, etc. 

There is also areas outside cities that would constitute much more farmland and open areas, which would have to be considered.


Interiors are another part that would require a lot of attention, and I think would really add a lot to the game in which every building can be entered, provided you can break down the door.

A large collection of layouts could be created for each interior, that would specify what would be able to be inside each room. For example:

Living room might contain: Couches, rug, counter, tv, table, bookshelf, chair.

A Kitchen might contain: Stove, counters, fridge, freezer, cabinets, table, chairs.

A bathroom might contain: medicine cabinet, bathtub.

Then with the given seed, a room could be generated to contain a set of furniture inside it. Obviously some rules would be set so you don't have a bathroom with 10 bathtubs in it.

Also, each of the objects could have child objects. For example in the bathroom, the medicine cabinet could contain objects. Or on the table a cup of water could be sitting there.

1310751634.0	iql9w	Physical Activities and Diet affect character's physical attributes	chesshaha	6	2	3	"Not sure how you guys' plan on character customization, but a person's starting weight should affect the player's movement (walking and sprinting) speed and stamina level (how long they can run/swim/bike). 

Physical activities like running and swimming should increase the player's stamina over time, so the player can sprint longer. Also jumping, the height of a player's jump should also be an attribute, which uses stamina, this could be a hidden attribute. Imagine jumping from roof top to roof top in a city, some jumps are easier to make, while others are harder. 

Calorie intakes should also have temperately and long term affect on your base physical attributes, if a person haven’t eaten in 3 days, the player's walking speed should decrease, stamina at 10-20%, has a chance to blackout, etc. And the person should also lose weight. On the flip side a player can gain weight, fat in this case, if a player has a calorie surplus and not getting enough physical activities. Gaining muscle is also possible with the combination of right calorie intake and physical activities. 

I think this could be implemented easily if the team taken action early in the development stage. Every food item has a defined amount of calories. If not enough maintenance calories (varies with player's weight) are consumed then their will be an effect on the player. I can provide you with a formula of calories macro if interested.

I may be in the minority, but I've never been much of a forum guy.  One of the attractions of reddit is that it takes the idea behind a traditional online forum, but makes it more approachable and interactive.  I find reddit incredibly easy to use, navigate and contribute to.  I can't say the same thing about the forums.  Besides, there are already three and a half thousand of us here.

Also, while I am familiar if not partial to the sentiments involved in making your Github private, why not make it public as an incentive for the more tech savvy among us to get involved, or at least submit one time patches? (The worst someone not part of the team could do is fork it and request a merge) As I understand it, there are many among us who would contribute, but are otherwise occupied. Why not post a public list of tasks/bugs for any/all programmers to attend to?

And lastly,

* Will the game be open source?
* Will the game be free or paid?
* Although it is early, is an API planned?
* Will worlds be procedurally generated upon creation, or will there be static maps with dynamic content?

Sorry if you guys have made this clear already, but I'm a little unsure on the direction the gameplay is going. Will this be Minecraft with Zombies (in a city with Fallout New Vegas Hardcore mode) or will there be quests and such? Because your FAQ says ""If you want to find survivors, bring friends into your game."" That makes it sound like there won't be anyone else (Though the title or the game may also be a clue for that). I feel a few characters around the city would make the game a lot better. They don't have to be like Left 4 Dead supporting characters, just loners like you who you can encounter and interact with occasionally. Even Terraria has a few NPC's.

Also your FAQ suggests that you can build things in the game, and that a main point of the game will be construction. Will this be similar to the Minecraft/Terraria building scheme? Because with the realistic approach you are taking, building doesn't seem like a good idea. In real life, I'd assume that if you're in a city infested with zombies, you wouldn't try to build sandcastles, especially if you're by yourself. IRL, your only goals would be to survive (eating, drinking, defense against zombies) and finding other survivors. And just trying to survive can get a little tedious after a while if the player doesn't have a clear direction. Realistically, you would construct things after you reestablish the population. You wouldn't do it by yourself surrounded by zombies. And making your own direction would be hard since there would be little to build (if the game is supposed to be like Minecraft) and there would be little to no people to interact with.

Your realistic approach obviously wouldn't favor a guns blazing style of play. The game sounds like it will be like I Am Legend, but that would be less fun in an open sandbox world with it being random and not scripted, as it could decrease tension slightly. If the world is just filled with you and slow-moving zombies, the game will lose its charm after a while, when you learn how to survive easily, and you customize your character more and more.

Also, will there be stores that you can loot (or buy from if you do add NPCs)? Sporting goods stores (that have guns/ammo), convenience stores, furniture stores, supermarkets, hardware stores, pharmacies (and water fountains, residential apartments/houses with limited supplies). Integrating them into the experience will make the game even more fun than it sounds, and it would provide a very realistic way to give the player the resources they need instead of dropping them on the sidewalk.

Again, apologies if you already talked/thought about/discussed this. This sounds like a really fun game if it's done right. Like Grand Theft Auto combined with zombies combined with Fallout New Vegas combined with other awesome games/game elements.

1311642722.0	izppr	I think death should work like this . . .	Drook	6	3	3	"It works kinda like Final Fantasy where you have several characters, the key difference however is that there doesn't have to be a main character, it simply works like this: While out killing zombies you should run into NPCs somewhat regularly, some alone and some already with groups of people. You are able to try and recruit them to join you the kill zombies or rebuild civilization or whatever. Once an NPC has joined you then you are able to play as them if you would like and go out on missions with them, or even scout out a dangerous location if you don't want to loose your main, because if you die on any of your characters they are gone for good. There is a catch though, if a NPC joins you then you have to be able to feed them, have a shelter for them, and other basic survival needs (it can't just be like you have 5 people living in a 6'x6' shack). I like this idea because it adds the element of permadeath and respawnibility.

This also allows some interesting features:
-For multiplayer, it could work so that you can have someone join your server and they could just play as one of your crew.
-There could be large missions to go on that would require 2-3 people each specializing in soething different.
-There could be clan wars over ammo or water or something.
-You could have other members in your clan go out and gather supplies while you do something else (not sure how this would work... maybe highlight an area for them to explore and there be some chance of death)."	t5_2sn4h	True
1311574962.0	iyynq	More inventory system: Anyone remember Castle of the Winds?	Brimshae	4	1	0	"So, Castle of the Winds. And old shareware Rogue-like from the late 90s(?). Had a simple to use, yet amazingly complex inventory system that ~~would~~ should not be terribly difficult to program. 

All items have two parameters: weight and bulk.

You have equipment slots (weapon, armor, shield, shoes, backpack, belt, etc). 

Double-clicking a container opens it. The standardized Windows interface gives every container box its own close button.

Containers (belts, backpacks, bags, chests) have two capacities: weight and bulk. As per basic logic, items can be placed into containers until their weight and/or bulk capacity would be over-filled. 

""It's too heavy for your small pack."" 
""It's too bulky for your large bag."" 

For equipment slots, you just had to have the right type of item. A helmet for your head slot, boots for your feet slot, a bashing/cutting item for your weapon slot*, you get the idea. 

*thought this could be two or three slots, representing weapons you have at the ready. Example: A pistol, a small melee weapon, and a longarm. An alternate would be a large weapon/item and a small weapon/item, such as a claw hammer and a rifle, or a pistol and a sword/fire axe. 

Carry weight directly affected movement speed, but not attack speed (a separate value). Values ranged from I think 200% down to 50%. Trying to pick up anything after that resulted in ""It's too heavy for you."" This also served as your encumbrance modifier. 

Carry bulk did not have a direct effect, it mostly served to make sure you weren't carrying around a giant box in each hand, with one strapped on your back (""It's too bulky for you"").

1310972016.0	ism9h	Applying for the UI/HUD Designer position	jimmysaint13	8	6	7	"Hello! I'm going to be applying for the UI/HUD designer spot and I'd just like to show you guys some things that I'm working on/ideas that I'm pitching.

**Character Status**
First off, is the ability to have your HUD be as informative or minimal as you want. Or you can have no HUD at all! The team has stated that there will be 4 things that will affect your character: Health, Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue. A minimal HUD will have none of these things, while you'll have the option for a full HUD which includes indicators for all four things. If you choose to have no HUD, you will have to rely on audio/visual cues.

For low health, your vision will lose its color and become greyscale, with momentary blurring as you get closer to death. 

For hunger, you'll start hearing stomach growls starting at around 50%. 0% hunger, you're good. 100% hunger, you've just starved to death.

Severe fatigue will result in your character moving slowly, not being able to carry as much (weight will be a factor), and with very severe fatigue (90%+) your vision will momentarily darken to simulate ""nod off"" moments. If you get to 100% fatigue, you will pass out on the spot for several (to be decided how many) hours. When you wake, you will still be severely fatigued, so it would be a VERY good idea to get somewhere safe and get some sleep!

For thirst... I've really tried to think of something for this. What kind of audio cue would you have for this? Seriously, this one is beyond me. I've thought of some kind of 'lip smacking' sound, but something like that might not be apparent to the player as to what it means.

**Inventory Management**
This idea I'm really excited about. The idea is to have a Resident Evil or Diablo-style 'square slot' system. Different items take up different numbers of boxes in different configurations depending on their size. For example, a grenade may take up a single box, where a lead pipe may take up a 1x3 section, a chainsaw taking up a 2x4 box section and so on. Now for the part I'm excited about: 3 distinct 'bag types'. The types I've come up with are [Messenger Bag,](http://i.imgur.com/XtUhq.png) [Backpack,](http://i.imgur.com/Bq2f4.png) and [Mil-Spec Duffle.](http://i.imgur.com/ixekq.png) The Messenger Bag holds the least, but also hinders your movement the least. The Duffle will hold lots, but can easily get cumbersome. The Backpack is equivalent to a medium-sized school backpack and is a compromise between the two.

**Ammo Management**
Another idea that I'm proud of is the idea of using an [Ammo Pouch](http://i.imgur.com/ya1Rg.png). Long story short, if you store ammunition for your active weapon in your ammo pouch, it will take less time to reload. This pouch will have a very limited space that you can ONLY store ammunition in. You can have all the ammo you want in your regular bag, but it will take longer to reload.

**Cell Phone UI**
I wanted to design an interface that minimized immersion breaking. The idea came to me about using a Cell phone during a conversation with a friend that cell phone usage has become so widespread, especially in urban areas, that it seems the people without them are vastly outnumbered by those that have them. Seeing also how cell phones (excluding smart phones) are ridiculously easy to charge (you can charge them effectively via USB which does NOT put out a lot of current), I figured a Cell Phone UI would be the best choice for realism and immersion. A more detailed explanation is available in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZjHlc.png) with more refined ""Home Screen"" images [here](http://i.imgur.com/FK261.png), [here](http://i.imgur.com/6510H.png), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/osT6w.png).

**Minimal HUD**
Now, I already said that you'd have a choice between No HUD, Minimal HUD, and Full HUD. I don't have an image for a Full HUD made up yet, but here is my idea for a [Minimal HUD](http://i.imgur.com/xQmtL.jpg). Basically all you have there are small icon reminders of what to press to bring up other things. Not shown is weapon info, which is only the name of the weapon you will use. This will only show up when switching to that new weapon and will disappear after a few seconds.

I am currently working on a mockup for a Full HUD, I'll make another post when I get that done.

Anyway, thanks for reading, and I hope to be picked up for the team!

1310759511.0	iqpct	My thoughts and input on Survivor 0 so far.	matty2fresh	4	1	2	"I love these ideas coming in, here are some questions with ideas.

Duration of the game: 
What happens if you kill them all, how are more created?
What if whenever you died there would be a ai zombie version of you walking around?


Weapons:
as I said in another post weapons could be improvised, ie. machete, shovel, bat, etc.
Obviously having hardware and gun stores would be available.
NO DEAD RISING COMBO WEAPONS. If anything make them plausible. 

Zombies:
What caused the outbreak? Virus zombies? already dead, out of the dirt zombies? Both? 
Something got into the water therefor infecting the soil?
Their health could be gaged by what kind they are, weak ones would be the living dead as their flesh and organs have already decomposed. Then stronger according to how they were as humans nothing more. There has to be a variety in the zombies because it would be fun to have strategize how to kill them, ""kill that one with the shotty"" or ""shoot this ones legs first""

Animals:
Are they immune?

Multiplayer:
I do like the idea of classes, doctors, mechanics, etc.
Would have to have a limit of them as their can be so many, just the basic ie. a ""juggernaut"", medic etc.

Health:
realistically it would be almost impossible to heal unless you had some sort of antidote. Unless we vote to make it so legit you get bit and you will die/turn. In that case when bit or scratched or whatever will affect how your health degenerates, your walk, &amp; vision. Include some flashes of rage. 

Death:
Respawn? In a sandbox game that would be best.

Plot/Missions:
Sandbox games can be boring if there are no side missions. Easy, a survivor needs help.....

Setting:
City? city with suburbs? Or a mix. 
I would like to see some kind of fortress customization.
example: As you walk around you see a building/house, clear out building of zombies, then set up shop. (be hard in multiplayer as there would be buildings taken everywhere.....) Still a good idea.

Regardless of the transition from human to zombie (dying, quests, whatever), I think that it would be potentially more entertaining to use numerous *weak* zombies in a horde/RTS-type setup as opposed to a single, comparable-to-humans zombie. (Picture a human faced with a dozen slowly creeping zombies that take 1-2 hits to kill and do low but constant damage vs. a stronger zombie that takes more hits to kill and does more damage per swipe)

Of course it could be both systems as a zombie, where you can either have one or the other (for example having a group of coordinated, stronger zombies) but I figured I'd throw it out there to see if anyone else likes the concept."	t5_2sn4h	True

How long after infection would the game be set? 

The reason I am wondering is that I feel like the environment would be quite different depending on how far along in the apocalypse it is set. Things like physical features of houses would be changed of course, but also variable equipment like condition/availability of weapons and condition of zombies.

It would be very cool if for maps in the game you ripped data from google maps/earth and made the cities in the game cities from the real world. Where houses existed you could drop in various generic ""interior"" designs you had made, and where retail stores existed, you could do the same (replace all Walmarts by gigantic Z-Marts, full of game-relevant objects and supplies). 

When a player started a game, he could pick his REAL address, and begin the zombie apocalypse from his own home. He would already know the area: where gun stores are, where grocery stores are, the best ways to get around street-wise, etc. This would allow players to live out the zombie apocalypse fantasy they've always dreamed of. Depending on the game structure (MMO, otherwise,..), you would even know where your friends (who are also playing) are, and try to find them and take shelter together.

It even sounds reasonable to start with a couple big cities (you can play in LA or NYC for example), and over time, as the infection spreads, you release new maps (new cities) as they become ""infected"" in real time.

1310698498.0	iq27p	If it's not too late or too much to ask, this mode of zombie games would be awesome.......	wontstoptalking	5	2	2	"this is a very vague idea, but here goes:


One thing I find lacking in many zombie games is the ""Dead people becoming zombies"" factor.  As in, in L4D, when a zombie kills you....you don't become a zombie!   You just die!  Wtf?  Then how are there tons of zombies?

While the L4D type of ""start the game with a million zombies"" is fun, even MORE fun (sometimes) is the ""slow infection"" gametype.....

As in, start with a bunch of non-zombies.  Start with one zombie.  The zombie kills, and as it kills, the infection spreads exponentially.  THAT's what I want to see in a zombie game.  I want to see the infection happening.


But how can you have so many players, you ask?  How can you start with hundreds of non-zombies?

Easy!  Make them NPC's!  Start in an suburban environment (say, a small town).  People driving to work.  People taking dogs for walks.  There's some road traffic, but not too much.

Then you see a sick person (obviously a zombie) ambling along, and that zombie attacks a person, and people start running.  But now there are two zombies....soon three....

And you (and whoever you're playing with) are the only ones armed with a gun, so you're the only ones who can defend yourselves.  And guess what?  You can WIN!  If you kill all the existing zombies, you can save all the NPCs, and there will be no more source of zombies (they're all dead), so you WIN!  However, this will almost never happen, as the infection always spreads very quickly (exponentially, of course).

So not only are you playing to save yourself, you're playing to save NPCs and preventing THEM from becoming zombies.  Or you could ignore the living NPCs, but then you'd face more zombies in the future.

Please tell me this makes sense.


EDIT:

Oh my god I just had the BEST idea!


Ok, so everything I said above.  But guess what?  Obviously it'd be really easy to win if it starts with just ONE zombie.  Too simple: kill the first zombie.  That seems so easy.  Kill the first zombie and win!  You ended the infection!  But it's too easy to kill only ONE zombie.


Buuuut let's say you can't FIND the zombie!  Say the map is enormous (borderline open-world, maybe, like Bad Company 2's maps.  They're enormous, but not open world).  You need to search while you can for the initial zombies!  Say it takes 1 minute for a killed person to become a zombie.  And it takes time for the slow, dumb zombie to actually kill someone.  And now let's say the zombie spawns randomly.  Could spawn at your feet in the beginning of the game.  Or it could spawn on the other side of the map.  There's no way of knowing.


What you DO know is the amount of current zombies.  At the top right of the screen, somewhere in the (hopefully minimal) HUD, there will be an infected count.  And you watch as that number grows from 1 to 2 to 4 to 10, and maybe you don't see signs of a zombie apocalypse immediately...maybe it's happening too far away...but you know you're running out of time and you have to find the outbreak and isolate it FAST....or there'll be no way of winning...

Oh my god I'm getting such nerd chills right now

EDIT 2: I can't stop here

So the game starts and you know one thing: there's a zombie somewhere out there threatening this world, and we have to stop it before it spreads its disease.  You get in a car, and the three other survivors (or more, I guess!) go their own ways and get in THEIR own cars (or walk; maybe one section of the map is offroad or bad for driving) and hunt down the initial infection zone so you can find it and stop it before it spreads too much to stop.  You take the main street of the town (old school 60's downtown area).  A friend checks the housing roads.  Another friend takes a grocery store area.  You're all searching.  The number of infected at the top of your screen just rose to 3, but none of you see anything yet.


Suddenly, you hear a scream.  You drive down the block (avoiding civilians. let me take a break here: early on, driving will be slow and difficult: you must SAVE the civilians.  You are on their side.  Killing a civilian by running them over or shooting them deducts points.  You gotta save em.  BUT as the game goes on and those civilians become zombies, drive like a lunatic and run them all down! anyway, as I was saying, you drive down the block) and see two zombies slowly ambling after an old lady.  You call out to your teammates your location.  It pings on their maps, and they come as quickly as possible.  You take out the two zombies...but that still leaves one more.  The infected-counter pings up to 2 again, then 4, and suddenly you're in more trouble.  You isolated some of the incident, but one zombie couldn't be found, and is spreading the infection once again.  You were so close!  This time you don't find the outbreak until there are 30 zombies, too much to easily take out with civilians nearby, and so you retreat, with zombies on your tail, to the grocery store, where you know there are some supplies and some shelter.....

OH MY GOD

There could be a small-town USA map (like I was describing above), a super urban New York style city map, a mall, oh man....I don't know if I'm the only one who loves this idea.  Not sure if others will care for it like I do, but THIS is what I want in a zombie game.

Of course, this could just be a mode...there could be a mode that's more conventional L4D style ""no civilians and a million zombies"", if development could take care of designing both modes..."	t5_2sn4h	True

Let's hypothetically say, that starting today I was suddenly thrust forward into the management of this game. I'd humbly accept, there would be a subtle and tasteful champagne and cheese luncheon. I would thank everyone for their hard work thus far and then after we had our feel good moment, lay down the law. 

From this day forward I would institute a a full disclosure policy. We would maintain an actual, dedicated development blog. We would hire a professional (who has a college degree in Journalism) to monitor the office and every week update the community as to what we have accomplished that week, they would summarize meetings that we might have and generally keep the community informed in an EASY to understand, consistent manner. This person would also be the one to reach out to game journalism sites and help spread a positive view of the company. 

We would do away with inconsistent statements. Percentages that simply couldn't exist and promises unless absolutely sure we could keep them.

I would immediately hire professional moderators. They would maintain consistent quality control over the forums. I would do away with volunteer moderators as in my experience, people volunteering to moderate others tend to acquire ego's that do not assist in the maintaining of a respectful community forum.

I would not be so heavy handed with the rules governing community discussions. Even negative criticism has it's place. The only aspects we would act upon would be discussions and comments of an OFFENSIVE nature.

I would schedule a meeting with all staff members, where we would look over the most common criticism and discuss it. I would ask for ideas from the team and implement those ideas that are the most sound.

I would look for an outside anti-hacker program. Bring in professional's who have experience with anti-hacker programs and abandon the in house program so the existing programmers can focus on optimizing the game. 

Speaking of the game. 

I would strive in the early days to BALANCE the game. I would test number of players VS number of Zombies for both difficulty, enjoyment and server stability. I would strive to balance loot better in specific areas. I would immediately do away with the FOUR hour timer and revert to the 1 hour timer without the GC revival.

GC would be for COSMETIC changes only, a tried and true microtransaction system that works with many other AAA titles. 

I would stop adding weapons, characters, art assets (unless applicable), items, anything to do with GC until the core PROMISED inclusions were complete.

1312202925.0	j5mxw	Power sources, aggro radius and player nesting		1	1	3	"Let's face it, the big deal with this kind of thing is getting power when there is no power available due to zombies.

I suggest looking at windfarms as being a place where people would go at least to hook up for power. I think a solar grid could work but in all likelihood zombies are going to smash solar power grids for fun.

Fuel operated generators are going to be pretty bad since they put off such a large amount of noise pollution. Basically I would cause them to increase aggro radius of any camp by a couple miles unless they were deep underground or in a noiseproof room.

Players are going to need to nest in to survive for one night. In any zombie movie I've seen the only players able to survive were able to nest effectively by either being high up off the ground or inside impenetrable fortresses.

Typically anything public access today like shopping malls or whatnot are not going to be suitable since they are constructed with poor material.

Military bases would work but I'm not sure what condition you would make them in or if they would be crawling or not.

I think players should be able to change the physical aspects of rooms they want to use for shelters by reinforcing the rooms.

I recommend putting up a menu UI for this so that each room prefab you make will have multiple levels of security based on the skill of the player.

Some options would be for noiseproofing, reinforcing of the doors and windows, blocking out of light also... and then you gotta look at the defensibility of the place and whether there is an escape route or not.

Prefab of safe rooms (player nests) would be ideal just from a design standpoint, however it could detract from the seemingly open-ended design of the game unless you create many of them.

Just not sure how to handle that, but it's something I feel a zombie game should have."	t5_2sn4h	True

1312189125.0	j5jgw	Multiplayer: Factions	riqk	2	2	3	"I was reading on a post here about the possibilities of multiplayer ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivorzero/comments/ipzhx/multiplayer/)) and in the comments the subject of factions and human players posing as a threat as well as an ally came up. The idea of having a classic zombie, sandbox, open-world, multiplayer game really sparks my interest and I'd love to see it happen. Of course, I'm not a very avid gamer (when I find a game I really like, I do play it A LOT, though) and I have pretty much no experience with coding games so I'm not sure what's possible but here are a few ideas I've had.
___________________________________________________________________    
    
Let's look at this comment posted by **mriodine**:

&gt; personally, i feel like the factions should be player-created, if there are any, and any actions should be up to the players--you should be able to shoot whoever the F**k you want, adn the only effect of identifying with a faction is that you'd be identified with them properly, so that they would actually let you into their fort.
  
  
I really like the idea of this. Having a whole shit-ton of zombies to worry about as well as human interaction adds realism as well as massivemassivemassive playability to the game. Being able to make friends and enemies and having to watch your back for zombies at the same time kind of reminds me of a Fallout: New Vegas type experience only with real players instead of AI.

               ____________________________________________
    
    
Of course, there are problems with this idea, as brought up by **thecalster**:

&gt; I agree, i just feel that by doing this, too many will be created and will result in only the most powerfull being able to really play, and any small groups would just be pushed into the corner and be pocked at with a stick. Also with huge factions, it will become more of a player vs player game and the zombie are just some minor enemies. I think the factions is a good idea so long as its controlled
___________________________________________________________________    
    
    
This is an extremely crucial thought to this type of playing experience. As with most games that encourage free-world multiplayer interaction, there seems to always be a most powerful and popular ""clan"" or whatever that new and old players alike will always be threatened by. Obviously, the problem with this is that the head clan - or in this case, faction - will be a huge problem for any other player who decides they don't want to group with this faction. Here's a small list of possible problems with this idea:

* Head faction(s) will take ultimate control

* Too many factions will take away from zombie aspects

* New players might be drawn away from game due to head faction(s)

* Smaller factions will be kept down

* It will become more of a ""survive against humans"" than ""survive against zombies"" game
    
    
It's true. There's always the threat of early players starting factions that just grow and grow causing people who join later in the game to be turned off or making their experience less exciting by just jumping into a faction with immediate protection or having to watch out for other human players killing them immediately with no repercussions. The game might also turn into being about surviving against these larger factions and zombies being a smaller issue.

    
    
I've thought of some ways to possibly combat some of these issues.

* A possible way to combat the issue is just having different regions players can join. The regions would be like different cities and each city would only allow a certain amount of playable characters to join. I'm thinking kind of like how Runescape (lame, I know) has multiple different worlds, only on a much smaller scale. Maybe each city could host up to 50-100 players and the maps would be randomly generated with the already made environment models.

* Limit how many people can be in a faction. This way more factions might be created but it might turn into more of a worldly order kind of like the United Nations with all the different factions acting like countries in today's world. Of course, you'll still have your small bands of pirates and raiders but they wouldn't be like an ""official"" faction. Make a sort of process for starting a faction so that they have some form of officialism over small bands of raiders.
    
    
I honestly have no idea if this post is going to be a useful contribution or if any of these ideas are even possible but I'd still love to see some discussion on this. I think the idea of having human players pose as a threat as well as zombies really adds to the realism of the game and would more than likely have me hooked on the game. It would kind of be like I Am Legend meets WoW only... Different. You know?

Anyway, feel free to bash all my ideas and share some of yours! I'm really excited about this game as it is and just decided I'd chime in on what I think would be cool in a game, even if it's not necessarily possible for it to be implemented in Survivor Zero.

**TL;DR** - At least read from the first set of bullets down. Pretty much, just an idea of having a lot of playable-character interaction as well as zombie AI."	t5_2sn4h	True

1311828672.0	j1vs2	a possible game mechanic.	daoudalqasir	2	2	5	" i would really like this game to have a minecrafty element with possibility to build amazing structures out of resources you find in the game, say you find half a broken door while you searching through the wastes pick that thing up and use that same broken piece to use in a wall of a fortress your making or maybe lay it down to use it as a bridge to make an alternate route for yourself safe from the zombies or to block up an opening to a pipe that water is flowing through you can get by on dry land, unlike minecraft the water won't just disappear because you blocked of the source if it has nowhere to flow away to then you will have to remove it with your own pipe system or a bucket if you have the time, but hey now you have the ability to make a complicated irrigation system for your settlement. or maybe you'll take that piece of a door and attach a leather strap to it that you found somewhere else and build a shield out of that same piece of door, and all that piping you were going to irrigate with maybe it would be better used to build a rocket launcher our maybe the barrel of a home made sniper rifle or cut in half an you have enough for the barrels for two pistols. the possibilities are endless!

so i started rambling a bit there but what do you guys think of that idea also i love the idea of being able to build an empire or corporation and expand your territory of control.

edit: ok i just cant stop throwing out ideas here: also digging buy/build a shovel now you can dig out the space to build you self a bunker, or maybe a tunnel system (but make sure to enforce it otherwise a horde of zombies running by over head may collapse it) and a sledge hammer can be used to break down the walls of buildings to make new routes or to just claim that concrete for your self (but bear in mind its in that same broken rubble like form that you broke it off the wall with so unless you can find use for odd shaped slabs of concrete, and there would be many although not nearly as sturdy or powerful, you'll have to find away to fuse it into more use full shapes. and a saw can be used to cut the environment in to the exact shape you want all though more time consuming than just smashing a hole in the wall, will be key to extracting the resources in the way you want or for creating elaborate traps for zombies, also necessary for building homemade weapons cut that piping to the exact length you want to adjust the accuracy and range of the gun your building, and the barrel is just one part of it. each aspect and feature can be sculpted to make an entirely unique weapon both stat wise and visual wise. ok next item electrical wiring (i get it redstone, i know this is starting to sound more and more like minecraft, just bear with me a bit) once you build you bunker how are you gonna get the lights on down there your gonna have to connect itn to some sort of power source using that wiring maybe you can connect to a still functioning part of the grid (but its been years since that things been kept up half of its broken its leaking power all over place it will only provide you with a limited amount of power) or maybe you found and old power plant you can connect to near your base or maybe it was a bit farther away, well the farther away it is the more wiring you have to lay down the more expensive thats gonna get not to mention the fact that all that exposed wiring is out in the open for the zombies to rip up you may have to do even more work to safe guard that wire.

then theres also a welding torch for connecting to bits of metal and nails for wood. glue too but that wears down easily.

reserves of gasoline or bateries can be found or bought through out the wastes to power the different devices you build, maybe even an alternate science can be invented for the game to give it abit of a scifi aspect and give you the ability to build devices like jet packs or lasers that wouldn't otherwise be possible or atleast not as simple. (simple compared to reality still pretty tough to find the resources and time in game with the constant threat of the zombie hordes)

vehicles such as cars, boats, or motorcycles even airplanes could also be built out of the scrap found in the wastes but once again would be expensive and complicated as well as easy to break down mid flight (also a runway would have to be cleared for planes to take off and land safely and boats would need to be water tight which will not be so simple.)

so heres the breakdown. the world is entire destructible based on a certain amount of damage some thing takes. every time you touch something it does a little bit of damage (zombies do a whole lot more) this amount of damage on most objects is so miniscule that it would take hundreds maybe thousands of touches to break it. devices such as hammers will do exponentially more damage than you will with your hands also the damage you do will be localized to a certain point in a wall if you use a hammer than according to the amount of damage it does that exceeds the walls limit the physics engine will judge how large an area of the wall was destroyed (i.e if you decide to spend an hour tapping at a wall until you reach exactly its damage limit then you will only end up punching a small hole in it, however if you give it one smack with a sledgehammer that may not break it but it will get you 3/4 quarters of the way, a second smack will get you way over the threshold and destroy a much larger portion)

saws will be for much more detailed jobs, such as designing a specific door way or window rather than just a big hole in the wall, and rather than the damage values they will operate on a basis of what material is being cut a cheap saw will only be able to cut wood and maybe rusted metal the better the saw the stronger material it can cut. once cut the piece of material can be picked up and replaced wherever you need it. things like wooden floor boards doors can also be ripped from floors you find throughout the wastes and put down wherever needed.

digging will work like a mix of the two both the material (type of dirt) and damage value will dictate how deep and wide you dig. though dirt will over time even out so the walls of you hole/ tunnel must be quickly reinforced with another material so it doesn't collapse.

every different component of an item will break down independently, remember that shield i mentioned earlier say you were to take rope instead of a leather strap to build it as you used the shield both the rope and piece of door will both be damaged different amounts based off different types of use. eventually your shield will break and you wont be able to use it until you get it fixed, fixing it however may just be a simple matter of mending or replacing the rope.

alright last point. NO MATERIAL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE! this keeps the game a zombie survival game at its heart rather than just a creative sandbox thing. remember i mentioned that zombies do a lot more touch damage to objects than you do, this keeps the game interesting no matter what you build your base or fortress out of the zombies will always break through given enough time this requires you to constantly be repairing your home to compensate in the areas that the zombies weaken and force you to keep combing the wastes for material or at least money to buy material.

ok i know it sounds allot like minecraft so let me try to point out how it could be different and how it won't just end up as a creative game.

1. zombies! the whole game is based around zombies, so they should be a major threat and there is no real safety. if they are constantly assaulting your base then you are going to be much more inclined to build a practical base than a pretty base especially if its constantly being torn down.

2. chances are you wont be able to make a pretty base, there are no perfect cubes here, you are building out of the rubble of the world that was its rusted and cracked and broken it will take you a real long time and a tone of work to make something pretty all of that while leaving you exposed to the zombies.

3. building your own weapons. building you own 100% unique guns and melee weapons with almost infinite possibility is way cooler than building a house and your going to want to use those weapons.

4. you not breaking a cube and getting a cube, everything has awkward shapes that will take some creative engineering to fit together usefully.

5. this is just one aspect of the game, that barely even includes the zombie part, there will be much more depth to it.

so i'm sure this is an incredible unrealistic idea but still how amazing would this be? i'm just wondering you guys thoughts are?

sorry for the wall of text and bad grammar i apologize.

Randomly chosen weather like rain, fog, and no weather ect.

I was thinking for when it rains, visibility is reduced slightly, not a lot though, also when its raining you shouldnt be able to run as fast, as the floor becomes slippery, so if you sprint or whatever you either have a chance to fall over, or you just have a speed reduction during rain.

As for fog, i was thinking visibility reduced by around 60% or so, so going outside during fog is quite a bad idea, but as its fog running speed isnt impaired.

Also i was thiking if during rain, theres a small chance of a thunderstorm and lightning striking and causing small fires in random places, could be used as an advantage to lead zombies through it so you can save ammo or (if crafted weapons or melee weapons have durability) then saving durability on your melee weapon.

Also another idea i had, this may already be the case, but if you have a gun, and you reload without the clip being empty then you lose the ammo in the clip but your weight decreases as you drop the clip (if a weight system is added) Or your could choose a setting where no clips are dropped and they are just added to the backpack weather theyre empty or not. Also no idication of the ammount of ammo left would be a good idea, forcing people to stop in a safe place and manually count their ammo? (Possilby by unloading the bullets from each clip and counting manually requiring a minute or so of being stood still while an animation plays as you look at your weapon unload ect)

I'Ve got three suggestions for the game:
1) Zombie player. I'd like very much the option of playing the zombies, as they are usually easy to kill a player could start with a swarm of about 30 (or something equivalent in power to one human survivor) .
2) related to that, I can see two level of contamination for human who have been hurt. Let say yellow grade for when you look okay but you are contagious to other human and red when you start to become and look zombie. And, that's the main thing,until you're in the red you're the only one who knows that. That would pretty much stop people from forming big hunting groups due to increase risk of contamination from healthy looking virus bearer and everybody would become paranoid toward everybody else. 
3) Some sort of current medication easily found in pharmacies that would slow the effect of an infection in the yellow zone
4) Playing as a zombie swarm if you manage to brain off a human one could think that his screams would lure some other zombies to your swarm and therefore replenish it with some ""fresh"" troops.

It is not really armor, but more of a zombie suit to help protect myself from those soulless bastards.  Now, in this game, let's say I somehow get into a fight with a spitter (a zombie that spits blood at you to infect you), and I am wearing enough protective gear on my face to where all the spit does is messes up my vision, then I should be able to get away, or at least try to.  Now, impaired vision is probably super complex, so I am not saying put that in, but maybe protection against zombie blood for what I am wearing could work.

Maybe I am wearing a thick winter coat and I get zombie blood on myself, it won't hit my skin, so I am safe, but if I am running around in a tank top and get zombie blood on my arm, well, the human body absorbs liquid, so I would be fucked.

I think it would be neat to have such a capability, where there is (one, for at least a bit of realism) a radio station within the game.

However, here's the catch: it's a real radio station. We could set up an online radio station^1 that plays either music from current times or from whenever the zombie apocalypse happens and music stops being made^2 .

There would be legal problems with actually playing real music, but I believe we could get a legitimate registration for fairly cheap^3 . Alternatively, as I said in the 2nd footnote, we could have redditors compose music for the game.

Other things: The DJs would roleplay. This makes sense because we want the game to be immersive. There's a problem with this, of course, which is that we'd need to actually get DJs to play 24/7. Alternatively, we could just record each hour and, should a radio spot be vacant, we could just use recordings that occur each day. (Example, 7-9 PM EST happens to be empty and we can't get a filler, we could use the recordings from 1-3 PM of the same day)

SO THIS MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE IDEA. Who cares? We'll have fun with it while it lasts.

Does anyone know how to do this? Will someone help me out/DJ/record music?

Footnotes:

1. We could do this right now. In fact, it would be better to have the station up and running well before the game actually comes out to build up hype/get the DJs ready for the actual release of the game.
2. Or we could have some bands perform music particularly for the radio station and get paid--or not. I could get my band to record a few songs, for sure, and a lot of people have volunteered their music.
3. IIRC, the license to play unlimited music as a radio station is roughly $300, but I heard that from word of mouth.

Appendix: I'm aware of the problem that the radio wouldn't be playing when disconnected from the internet. We could have cached recordings (like every other in-game radio) or we could have just static to lighten the load on the hard drive."	t5_2sn4h	True

Datsoon	2	5	1	"I was watching this mediocre alien invasion movie last night (Skyline), in which a small group of survivors is trying to stay alive. I thought it might be cool to expand on this concept and turn it into an entire game, very similar to Survivor Zero. This might the wrong sub/r/, but just hear me out. 

It would have very similar survival mechanics to the zombie survival game, but expeditions outside of your safe house would play out much differently. The enemies would be much smarter, aggressive, and a bit harder to kill, but be encountered less often. For those of you who haven't seen Skyline, think War of the Worlds. Most of the population of the city have been taken, and only a small number survived. In order to keep yourself alive, you would need to leave your safe house every so often to gather supplies, and/or make guerrilla strikes at the aliens.

Survival mechanics of the zombie game would likely remain unchanged, and only the enemies and weapons would need revision. It could likely be achieved through a mod of some sort to the survivor zero game. This is likely asking too much of the survivor zero team, but I thought it sounded interesting, and wanted to see what y'all thought. "	t5_2sn4h	True
1313757236.0	jnswn	The story so far?	DICKTracey	4	6	3	"Hey guys, just found out about this project and wanted to try find out some more information about it. 

First off, is this going to be a single player or mmo style?

Will you have a GTA style ""safe house"" or are you going to be roaming around outside all the time?

Have you decided on a map size yet?

Will there be a day and night cycle?

What type of zombies are you thinking of using? fast and weak like left for dead, slow and strong like resident evil 2/3? or a mix of a few types?

Will zombies be able to use weapons?

Were you thinking of having animals too? (might be cool to see zombie elephants coming out of a zoo! haha)

Were you planning on having the player spawn with a weapon and armor or will this be like an ""average Joe"" who grabs his trusty 
baseball bat?

Were you going to add human npc's or are you the only survivor?

Will there be weapon condition?
If there will be weapon condition, please god put in a repair system!

Will weapons have add-on's / upgrades / different ammo types?

If you die, do you lose all the items and weapons you had on you? If so can you go back to where you died to get them back?

Will weapons respawn at their original spots, or are they gone once you pick them up?

Will you have a limited inventory, max weight that you can carry?

If yes, will there be a way to increase them? finding backpacks, slings, pouches, fitness levels?

Is there going to be a leveling system? 

Is there going to be a skill system? like in the original deus ex for example?

If the answer to either of these questions is yes, will there be weapons that require you to be at a particular level or skill level to use them?

Are you going for a comedic game or a more intense, scary type of feel?

If you get bitten, do you become infected? Be kinda cool to if you had like a time limit to find a cure (or medkit at least)

What are your inspirations for the project?



I think that's everything lol! If you could answer just one question that would be cool! :D

Looks awesome so far! Keep up the good work!"	t5_2sn4h	True
1312813945.0	jcf1x	Suggestion: No money or buying items.	hard_to_explain	4	5	6	A good example of this ruining a franchise is Resident Evil. In the other games, ammo was scarce, and you had to actually look around for it. Then Resident Evil 4 came out, and you didn't feel despair about possibly having to use a melee weapon, because you could just buy ammo from a vendor.	t5_2sn4h	True
1310960522.0	isi4h	Zombies Breeding	Celestro	1	3	12	"This is something I've never heard of in the zombie universe (though it very well may exist). The concept of zombies breeding and evolving rapidly.

It would be really cool to have a system by which zombies ""breed"" and new variations of zombies come about automatically. If a zombie with a higher than average movement speed bred with another zombie that is capable of opening doors, you'd have a fast, door opening terror machine. If that then bred with another zombie that was capable of something else, such as climbing over various obstacles, you'd have an even more deadly and fearsome zombie.

This would allow for the universe to grow with the player. All the zombies could start out as very basic zombies with very small variations in their capabilities. As you fight the zombies, you are removing options from the gene pool, but they are also breeding on their end, creating more and more variations. Some far more deadly, some far LESS deadly (mmm cannon fodder). So now, as the player becomes more capable of survival, amasses more weapons and learns his surroundings better, the game continually presents new challenges as the zombies are getting ""better"" also.

Perhaps, even, if a human player was turned, the zombie version of that human player would inherit some portion of the traits that were present prior to turning. Perhaps he was exceptionally strong, or fast.

I'd love to eventually go up against a zombie capable of forethought, tactics, and that could **shoot back**.

It would be unreasonable to require players to be on for 14 hours every day.
