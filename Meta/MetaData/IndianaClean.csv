In moving down from Indiana to Virginia we lost 4 totes on I80 going East. Yesterday (Sunday 9/2) we left Valpo area around 7pm. At midnight just before getting to the Ohio border, we were signaled by another driving that we had an issue with our trailer. When we pulled over 4 totes were missing, 3 blue 1 orange and 1 tan. We drove back and forth on this stretch of road until 3am and only found one blue tote. What's so important, the tan tote had a hand made baby blanket, with my bf's name,date of birth, and weight when born. Also a huge teddy bear is on the blanket. I would pay a reward for this blanket if found and returned. Also in this tote was two binder of magic the gathering playing cards. Yes nerdy, but again it's from my bf's childhood, and I would pay for these items to be returned. Please keep an eye out if you are in the area. 	t5_2qn7d	True

1370438419.0	1fpw9z	Governor Pence clings to antiquated drug laws; believes they protect Hoosiers.	asimovfan1	59	11	69	"Good morning fellow Hoosiers! I'm on a rampage here...

I wrote to Gov. Pence about a month ago when I learned that he's fighting Brent Steele's proposed changes to legislation regarding marijuana. So you know, I'm of the belief that the war on drugs has failed and that the state and nation are simply making criminals out of ordinary people.

I don't have the content of the first letter I wrote since I submitted it on the Indiana website. I do, however, have the response;

Dear Asimovfan1:

Thank you for contact Governor Pence regarding House Bill 1006. He appreciates the time you took to express your views.  I apologize for not being able to respond to your letter sooner.
 
Governor Pence is committed to combating illegal drug use in Hoosier communities. He believes that illegal drug use lowers the quality of life of the individual drug use, hurts the family, and damages the wider community. It is for those reasons that the governor does not support easing the penalties for possession or use of marijuana.

House Bill 1006, was passed by the Indiana General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Pence and will take effect on July 1, 2014. The 2013 Bill Watch on the governor's website has been established. All legislation that has been sent to the governor's office for consideration can be viewed at http://www.in.gov/gov/billwatch.htm.
 
Please be assured that Governor Pence monitors all legislation closely as it proceeds through the legislative process and thoroughly reviews all bills that are brought to him for his signature.


Again, thank you for contacting Governor Pence and for being an engaged citizen.

Sincerely,

Kristen Kane

Constituent Services Representative

Office of the Governor

And here is what I just emailed them back with;

Good morning,

Several weeks ago I wrote your office urging you to reconsider your stance on penalties for marijuana possession and use. I did receive a letter back and for that I thank you. However, the content of the letter was so canned, contrived and clearly antiquated in its basis I am compelled to write again.

In fact, I plan on writing essentially non-stop until reason prevails.

If you don't believe someone who has lived in Indiana all his life, who is an elected official, working member of the community, active in church and charity and heavily involved in the youth of my community, then perhaps the national discourse will persuade.

In essence; prepare your inbox, because I'm going to scour the internet for every reasonably article I can fine, every post, every news bite related to this topic and forward it to your office. This isn't some vainglorious attempt to annoy. Rather the contrary. I hope you listen. I hope you learn. I hope you realize that YOUR constituents are actually suffering MORE because of the current legislation than they would otherwise.

Your response made the assertion ""that illegal drug use lowers the quality of life of the individual drug use, hurts the family, and damages the wider community. It is for those reasons that the governor does not support easing the penalties for possession or use of marijuana.""

That's a rather nice and powerful comment, if it were remotely true or even practical. 

More lives are effected and ended by prescription drug abuse than cocaine and heroin combined, and more deaths occur each year in Indiana from alcohol abuse than have occurred from marijuana abuse IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. 

Try to put that in context for yourself and see if it hits home. Statistically speaking someone in your family has a relatively high chance of being negatively effected by alcohol use, which is taxed and regulated with the consent of this great state. They have virtually zero chance of being negatively impacted by marijuana, OTHER than for the fact that the state has chosen to cling to ancient, racist and hypocritical legal dogma regarding its use and possession. 

Alcohol kills regularly, yet we stand firm on allowing it. Marijuana has killed literally NO ONE, and let's again put that in a timeline context - EVER.

Please note the link I've included in this email which is the first of many I'll provide in my effort to bring realistic notions to my statehouse. 

http://www.aclu.org/billions-dollars-wasted-racially-biased-arrests

Please, please and for the love of all of the citizens of this great state PLEASE reconsider your out-dated and backward stance on this topic. If there are in fact Hoosiers who still hide behind the rhetoric that Marijuana is a gateway drug, or the devil drug, or some other unreasonable belief it is only because they have been effected by the multi-decade long national war against drugs which has in all reality and in the face of all evidence patently failed not only to curb drug use, but has also failed to protect Americans or improve whatsoever the lives of the people of this nation and this state.

Governor Pence this state elected you with the hopes that you would govern reasonably and with the welfare of our citizens in mind. Making them criminals for using a drug which is less harmful than ones which are being prescribed by doctors or which they can purchase at the grocery store is not reasonable, and does not afford protection to anyone. 

Please know that I'll be submitting these letters in their full content to as many social media websites as I am able in an attempt to bring clarity and honesty to this discourse as it relates to such an important and serious topic.

Thank you again for your time, and until next time,

Sincerely, 

A very concerned constituent.  

I know there are a lot of great arguments out there for decriminalizing marijuana. If you at all agree with me, please PLEASE write the state house. You can send your letters through this link;

http://www.in.gov/gov/2333.htm

Please post your progress back to this spot and anywhere else you can think it might make a difference. In the next week or so I plan to send them the link with San Jose Police Chief Joe McNamara talking about this topic as well since he's very well spoken and about as informed as it gets.

Please do the same!!!

April 17, 2013

Dear Mr. XXXX


I appreciate the time you took to express your thoughts about cybersecurity. Like you, I am concerned about the potential use of the Internet and telecommunications technology to cause harm to the nation's economic and security interests. 

Similar to other national security challenges in the post-9/11 era, cyber threats are multi-faceted and lack clearly defined boundaries.  The source of cyber intrusions is often difficult to determine, but recent reports indicate that many of these attacks or espionage activities may be sponsored by foreign governments. In light of these findings, we have a responsibility to protect critical networks while we protect civil liberties and individual privacy.

Last Congress, in an effort to protect proprietary information stored on domestic cyber networks, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3523, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). I supported this legislation because it gave U.S. businesses the support they need to better protect their customers and networks from a cyber attack, and included provisions to ensure that the private information of American citizens would remain private. This legislation also would have helped to defend our nation's computer networks by making it easier for the federal government and approved U.S. companies to share information about cyber threats and attacks. The 112th Congress ended before the Senate took action on this legislation.

Should future legislation concerning cybersecurity come to the floor of the Senate for a vote, I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind.

It is a privilege to represent you and all Hoosiers in the U.S. Senate. Your continued correspondence is welcome and helps me to better represent our state. I encourage you to write, call, or email if my office can ever be of assistance. You can also check out my Facebook page and follow me on Twitter by visiting my website."	t5_2qn7d	True

So, as a friendly start, I propose the following:

1) *Complete anonymity.*  If we meet up, perhaps we don't share each others user names, and go by just our IRL (in real life) first names.  (Or you can use a fake first name like Bond, or Xavier.  Names with the letter X are pretty cool.)  This way no one can search your GW posts or your WTF posts or whatever.  Additionally, you have the choice of whether or not you want to share personal/user information with your fellow /r/indiana redditors at the meet-up after meeting them.

2) *Be respectful.*  If one of us is crude or mean or disrespectful to anyone, it is just going to leave a bad taste in our mouths and possibly cause drama that is undesired and may ruin the next time a meet-up is proposed.

3) *Be understanding.*  People are different.  People like different things.  If it's not for you, just don't do it.  Life is better when you understand people are different.

4) *Don't be a creeper.*  This is not where you are going to meet the love of your life.  If you think it is, than you will be disappointed.  


Remember when we were all in like 4th grade and someone in our class had a birthday party?  It's kind of like that, only instead of cake and ice cream there's probably beer and corn of some kind, and instead of bringing presents, you bring jokes, and instead of one kid getting all the attention, we all get some of the attention.

For the meetup, here is what I propose, it's just my suggestion and obviously I want to hear everyone's opinion and suggestions.  It sounded like Indianapolis was the choice due to it being centrally located to most of us.

Who: /r/Indiana users, and anyone else that wants to come.

What: Meet up.  Daytime cook-out/day at the Park.  Nighttime bar hopping.  Bring some food to grill and some food to share.  Bring outdoor games, cornhole, redneck golf, fribees, kites, etc...

Where:  [Fort Harrison State Park](http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/2982.htm), Reddick Shelter.

When:  [TBD](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html)  I say like a 3:00pm start time, food about 4:00pm.  Gives us time to hang out, meet, do stuff, then get cleaned up and go out bar hopping later.  

**Cost:  Park Entry is $5/car.**

Why:  The park has a lot of things to do.  Bike riding, fishing, hiking, walking, running, lots of open grass areas for corn hole and the like.  

**You can bring propane gas grills and any alcohol that you want to the park.**

*Any firewood has to come from a store in Marion County and must have a USDA stamp on it.*

The Reddick Shelter is huge and can hold like 130 people, also allows for rain or shine situations.  It has a lot of picnic tables, a huge fireplace, and there is plenty of parking nearby for people from out of town.  I also picked the park because it has a lot of kid friendly amenities so if some of us have kids, and can't ditch them, you can still participate and bring the tricycle-engines along.

After the cookout, if we want to go and check out the city or bar-hop, it's a 15-20 minute drive to downtown, or Broad Ripple, or castleton.

Again, this is just my suggestion, as it didn't sound like anyone made a formal one the other day.

What do you think?

**TL;DR: Cook out at Fort Harrison State Park and spend the day at the park doing stuff.  Also beer and corn.  Hopefully bacon.  Bar hopping later on.**"	t5_2qn7d	True

I asked them if they'd ever seen a Bald Eagle before as I never had.  My grandma says, ""A long time ago, I haven't seen one since the late 60s.""  My grandpa chimes in and says, ""I think I saw one in the early 70s, but not here, up north a way, all gone now because of the DDT and they'll probably never come back.""  I was heartbroken.  I recall mentioning this to a teacher at school who told me of some efforts by the state to reintroduce Bald Eagles locally.  I was excited, but he told me the birds were shy and I may go a lifetime without ever seeing one. 

Years pass and I just accepted that I'd probably never see one outside of a zoo. In January of 2010, I caught my first glimpse of a Bald Eagle while hiking at Turkey Run.  I saw not just one, but three birds that day!  They were swooping down into Sugar Creek and catching fish out of the water.  I won't lie, I was so deeply moved by the experience my eyes filled with tears. The following spring, I saw an eagle at Pine Hills Nature Preserve while hiking just a little bit off trail down a small creek.  Each year since, I've seen more and more eagles in the park.

This is the first year I've seen the birds outside of the park.  I saw one near my home, and another flew in front of my vehicle outside of Greencastle just last week.  I think it's been an incredible experience seeing the birds make such a big comeback.  According to the DNR website, in 2012 they estimated that there were 150-175 nesting sites in the state.   The number has been growing each year, in 2011 the count was 110 nests.  I think as time goes on, the birds will become even more common, there may be a day in the near future when seeing an eagle isn't even a big deal anymore. 

Here is a local nest:

Indiana Conservation Officers, with assistance from U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service agents, have completed an investigation into the killing of a male whooping crane in early January in Knox County.

 The Knox County Prosecutor is reviewing the case, and charges are pending against Jason R. McCarter, 21, of Wheatland, and John C. Burke, 23, of Monroe City.

According to the case report filed with the prosecutor, ICO Joe Haywood received information in mid-January that a whooping crane had been spotlighted at night and shot and killed with a high-powered rifle.

The ensuing investigation involved multiple law enforcement agencies, wildlife biologists and private individuals and provided information that identified the suspects and also linked the bird to a federal program to reintroduce whooping cranes in the eastern United States.   

Whooping cranes are an endangered species protected by both state and federal laws. Efforts to save whooping cranes began after their nationwide population dwindled to 15 birds in 1941, according to the International Crane Foundation.

The Foundation reports there are nearly 600 whooping cranes today, with approximately 445 in the wild. There are more than 100 in the eastern reintroduction flock that travels through Indiana on a migratory path between Wisconsin and Florida. Roughly 150 captive-raised birds are used in the reintroduction programs at a cost exceeding $100,000 per bird.   

The whooping crane shot in Knox County was part of a nesting pair that was taught its migratory path by ultra-light aircraft.

For more on the bird, see www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/crane/08/BandingCodes827.html.

I mean I know some of them are some crazy stories, but really all I'm seeing here is the same old stuff I see on the news or read in the paper.  How about some posts focusing all cool stuff to see in your town? I'm positive there are at least 100 cool things to do in Indiana that I don't know about yet.  Here I'll Go a step further.
I want to hear the coolest thing to do in your town.  This is a challenge.  I love you guys, I love my state, but this subreddit is boring I'm sorry.

Edit: Sorry did not offend anyone.  Just meant to stir up some more interesting discussion.  Yes I know this is my first post here, I was just trying to contribute.  Anyways here is my list.

I'm from Kokomo, so not a very interesting part of our state geographically, but it's nice because I'm about an hour drive from many biggers cities and things to do.  Also: we do have our own things to do.  In no particular order:

Steer and the Stump.  Just sort of your basic dumb touristy stuff.  The steer is a giant old stuffed steer.  The stump is an enormous sycamore stump.  There used to be a phone booth inside.  Both are located at Highland Park.

Speaking of parks, we actually have a couple nice ones.  Highland Park is fairly scenic.  I think it has three or four playgrounds, a nature trail on the hills, a disc golf course, as well as basketball courts, tennis courts, a place for horse shoes and a couple baseball diamonds.  Jackson-Morrow Park has a couple miles of trails, including trails through a small wooded area.  It also has a pretty cool nature center.

On the complete other side of things, Kokomo is known for its strip clubs.  If you're into that sort of thing.  The Hip Hugger is home of the dollar lap dance and the Ultimate Place 2B is visited by celebrities every now and again.

Along with that, we don't have a whole lot of night life here.  We have a couple good bars.  Cook McDoogals Irish Pub is pretty good, good beer, good food.  Ned's Corner Pub is a local hot spot.  If you go there, get the tenderloin trust me.  There are a couple other decent ones, but we have new ones all the time so just ask anyone.

One of the greatest things to do in the middle of the night, as weird as it sounds, is get donuts.  We have the best donuts in the country.  I have to brag about them.  Go to Dan's Variety Bakery, affectionately known as Dirty Dan's.  I have brought people from all over the country here and they leave with a full belly, admitting these are the best donuts they have ever had.  Dan's opens at 1 am, so show up around 12:30 if you want to get a good spot in line on a friday or Saturday night.

A couple other cool things to visit:

Kokomo Opalescent (Sp?) Glass factory:  They produce stained glass used around the world.  Tours there are very interesting and there are even classes for glass blowing and stained glass.

Elwood Haynes Museum:  They argue that the first car was invented here.  No one outside of Kokomo seems to think that though.  Either way it is a fascinating look at Kokomo's past.

Seiberling Mansion:  This houses the Howard County Museum.  It is in an enormous mansion on Sycamore St between McCann and Phillips Streets.

Treasure Mart and Treasure Mart Mall are two very good places to go antiquing.

If you or anyone you know skateboards, we have two very unique skateparks.  DK's Main Street Skatepark is one of the two indoor skateparks in the State.  Lots of skateboarding history there.  Rapper Lil Wayne came here to skateboard in the middle of the night last year.  Also Kokomo Pipeline is a concrete bowl-style skatepark in Jackson Morrow Park featuring the only ""Bent full pipe"" in the world.

Downtown is always a nice place to explore, although it won't take you more than an hour or so to see it all.

Overall, Kokomo is a pretty boring place to live, but it is fun to explore if you have never been here before.  I know I am still discovering new things.  Like a psychic/palm-reader place.  Who knew?

So in my parents neighborhood a few guys have been going around asking people if they need any yard work done and parents needed four trees removed from our lot. These guys have been rude AND not completing work after payment with not only my parents but at least one of their neighbors. They got extremely rude and loud with a neighbor lady and they haven't gone back to do anything since then (not sure of the time frame). So my dad pays them after the first day for half and was going to pay the other half on completion. Yesterday as they were close to finishing up (needed to remove a few more stumps) they ask my dad for the rest so one of them can run to the bank before it closes and the rest will stay and finish up. Being the nice guy my father is he pays them and he goes in the house and 10 minutes later they're gone without finishing up and without saying a word. Now apparently at the bank they were wary of these people and asked for drivers license numbers, address, etc. and they were rude and even got belligerent with the teller and the bank called to ask my mom if the check was legit etc. Now I'm just writing this to warn people because if one person that lives in the Madison county area can not get tricked by these people it will be worth it.

So I went to his facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/GovernorMikePence (if you want it), and wrote up a response about how Portugal has recently discovered after legalizing it after 12 years they're having more money, and the other benefits to legalization are numerous, quoted my sources: http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/evaluating-drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-12-years-later-a-891060.html, and then went on to show him studies that THC cures cancer, proved that source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dSXhwP5QjUQ, and then went on to prove  the Great Lakes State could reap a $2.8 billion payoff for initiating legalization, and proved that source, http://www.theweedblog.com/how-much-money-would-marijuana-legalization-generate-for-michigan/ , so why can't we legalize it and have more money flow ?...

Long story short?

My comment has mysteriously vanished off of his facebook page.

Fucking asshole. 

I'm seriously thinking about informing WSBT and WNDU.

Edit: He also has just deleted my comment about how ""My comment about legalization has been deleted, why?"".

----

Edit 5 minutes letter I'm writing this to all major news sources in the area:

----

Today, I read a story on your (or WNDU's) facebook about how Mike Pence wants to make tougher drug laws for the state of Indiana.

I promptly went to his facebook and told him respectfully that I disagreed with him and gave him multiple sources as to why.

Portugal is doing *leagues* better than it used to when it was illegal:

1: http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/evaluating-drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-12-years-later-a-891060.html

2:

THC cures cancer according to Harvard research: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dSXhwP5QjUQ

3:

Washington State’s fiscal report of costs and benefits of this new legalization legislation yields a startling projection of $1.9 billion generated or saved during the program’s first 5 years. Michigan’s larger population indicates the Great Lakes State could reap a $2.8 billion payoff for initiating similar legislation. Per the Report: “Assuming a fully functioning marijuana market…estimated total revenue generated to the state could be as high as $1,943,936,000 over five fiscal years.” Michigan is the 8th largest state by population, with 9,883,640 residents per the 2010 US Census. Washington is 13th, with 6,724,540 citizens, making them 68% of Michigan’s size. Projecting these numbers reveals the potential for Michigan to capture $2.857 billion in revenue over five years.

If Michigan and Washington could benefit, why couldn't Indiana.

--
That's not the interesting part.

The interesting part, and why I'm writing you today is to tell you that Mike Pense is suppressing the freedom of speech. My comment, as well as it was written, and as respectfully as it was written, proving his speech wrong.. was promptly deleted off of his facebook page even after it had six likes..

When I made another post on his page just five minutes ago, asking ""Why my comment about legalization has more pros than cons was deleted?"" it too, mysteriously vanished.

--

This needs to be exposed, he's trying to protect his image at the cost of revoking someone elses rights.

In case you hadn't heard, next year the State Museum is getting the exhibit ""Where Science Meets Imagination"" featuring a number of props and displays that tie together real science and the Star Wars universe. It's going to be a great time to be a Star Wars fan, but there's some really awesome stuff happening in our area that you can be a part of right now.

Ever see the toy drives at Scotty's Brewhouse (next one is at the 96th St. location Tuesday, June 19th) with the Stormtroopers guarding the toy boxes? Did you get your picture taken with Jedi opening weekend of the 3D release of The Phantom Menace or on Free Comic Book Day? Where did Weird Al find a pair of Tusken raiders?

All those costumed people are members of Bloodfin Garrison of the 501st Legion (the bad guys) and/or Mos Espa Base of the Rebel Legion (the good guys). We're the local chapters of international organizations that use our costumes for both fun and to benefit children through volunteer and charity work. You can read more about us at [our website](http://www.starwarsindiana.com) or our parent organization websites: [501st Legion](http://www.the501st.com) and [Rebel Legion](http://www.rebellegion.com).

Aside from spreading geeky joy at events, we also love getting new people involved. There are lots of resources and helpful members. The sewing and painting is all worth it when a kid recognizes you. With such a major event in the area next year, right now is a really good time to start getting involved.

Events we have done recently:

*Valparaiso Music Festival

*Hoosier Valley Railway Museum Star Wars Weekend

*Toy drives for Scotty's Brewhouse

*Greenwood Relay for Life

*Summit City Comic Con

*May the Fourth Be With You at the City Market

I'll be monitoring this thread, so feel free to ask any questions here or hop over to [our forums](http://www.starwarsindiana.com) and register there. You can also request our presence at an event via our website.

Dear Mr. Minifig81,

 

Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the enforcement of intellectual property protections on the internet.  I value your views, and your input helps me to better represent the people of Indiana's Second District in Congress.

 

Patent and copyright protections are established in Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.  These intellectual property (IP) protections are granted to inventors, excluding others from making, using, or selling their invention without permission, in exchange for public disclosure of the invention when the patent is granted.  This ensures that both the inventor and the public gain from the utility of an idea. 

 

Over the last decade, IP has been increasingly obtained without purchase or the permission of the owner, most frequently through the Internet.  For example, Chinese manufacturers in recent years have blatantly stolen technologies and designs created by Hoosier businesses. This practice directly violates patent laws, and some argue that the loss of potential revenue negatively impacts the incentive to innovate.  Because part of America's economic power comes from our nation's unmatched capacity for innovation, any loss of IP could mean a loss of new jobs and economic growth.  

 

My primary concern is Hoosier jobs. That is why in the 110th Congress, I helped pass The Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act (P.L.110-403), which was designed to better coordinate U.S. agencies' and government efforts to not only protect our IP, but pressure other countries like China that do not do enough to crack down on and deter IP theft. 

 

The argument has been increasingly raised in favor of legislation protecting against the foreign threat of IP theft through the internet.  **While I agree that we must work to strongly prevent IP theft, we must strike a balance that does not curb the freedom and vibrancy of the internet, which has helped to lead to many of our country's more recent advancements.**  In pursuit of this balance, all recent legislative efforts to address this issue have been slowed, allowing for more debate and discussion.  Please know that I will keep your concerns in mind should any legislation concerning IP protection be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the creation and protection of Hoosier jobs will remain my greatest priority.

 

Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to write, call or email me again if I can ever be of assistance.  Also, if you would like to receive regular updates on my actions on your behalf in Congress, sign up for my e-newsletter, [The Donnelly Dispatch](http://donnelly.house.gov/contact/email-updates.shtml).
 

Sincerely,

Joe Donnelly

This means we will be able to host **500** gamers for LAN War 23!

Our last several LAN War events have been tremendous successes -- it literally sold out of 225 seats in 3 days flat -- and the club hope to take that interest and push it toward filling all 500 seats for this momentous and monstrously awesome LAN.

**Some highlights of the event:**

* Held at the Monroe County fairgrounds

* 24 hours long, 12pm Saturday, October 13 to 12pm Sunday

* $20 entry fee

* Dinner and energy drinks provided for free

* Free-to-enter tournaments in the hottest games (keep an eye on our site for more information about which games will be chosen)

* Thousands of dollars in generously donated sponsored prizes

Durrok	19	2	37	"My SO gave birth to our little girl this weekend. I was quite shocked when the nurse came in, gave us [this form](https://forms.in.gov/Download.aspx?id=9992) and told us that we either needed to get married or pay $400 for a genetics test within 60 days or I would not have legal custody over my daughter. I have not been able to find anywhere that says getting married within the 60 days nullifies the need for a genetics test but the nurse insisted that it would. If anyone has any experience in that realm let me know...

I know the last thing a couple needs with a newborn is to be blindsided with a huge bill. Considering that you can buy a genetic paternity test over the counter for $25-$100 if you aren't sure this just seems silly. Of course those won't work, you have to go to a place [accredited by the state](http://www.in.gov/dcs/files/Paternity_Labs.pdf).

Pretty livid about the entire thing but it would appear our hands are tied. Spend $400 on a DNA test that I'm 99% sure will come back as me being the father or $45 on a marriage certificate seem to be the only choices.

Is it really like that there? Nice, but shitty because of the people? Additionally, how does Fishers compare to Carmel in that regard? I know that they're right next to each other, so I'm wondering if they're all that different.

After he passed, we were left with a garage full of random crap. The guy never threw anything away. Just today we took 700lbs of metal, various pieces of scrap, chains, windshield wiper metal, parts from cars, whatever else have you, to a place that takes this kind of crap, weighs it, pays you, and recycles it however they feel fit. Everytime we move a box and clean up more, we reveal a new surprise. This image is one of those surprises.

That rusted hunk of metal and the piece on top of it is a chunk of railroad. How the hell this man managed to get this, I will never know. But the place we take the metal to will not take it due to legal implications. Soo, what are we supposed to do with this?

You could help find a missing identity!	RapedByASegway	15	2	10	"A man was found in a Burger King parking lot in 2004 with head injuries. He has very little memories from life before being found. He calls himself Benjaman Kyle, and was born in **1948** (as he remembers.) Some memories place him as being in Indiana **up to 1963 at the minimum**. He might have attended high school there. Under hypnosis, he came to the idea that it could have been a Catholic high school. So any Redditors that have **parents that attended high school** (especially Catholic hs) in the **60s**, could you ask them to look for **yearbooks** and take a look at his picture?

**Potential clues to keep in mind:**

* born in **1948**

* remembers that his first name was **Benjaman** and was spelled like that exactly

* on the Dr. Phil show, he said he went to **Catholic** high school

* according to genetic analysis, his last name could be **Davidson** so check for that if you get your hands on a yearbook!

* he remembers living in **Denver** in the 70s

1343748631.0	xgazi	My friend, a young composer from Knox, IN, passed away last October. Please, check out his music and see how we are honoring him! (links in body)	deader115	18	3	0	"A good friend of mine, Drew Shearin, was a young composer who won two state youth composing awards in his lifetime, once for a symphonic piece and once for a choral piece. He was a singer, actor, musician, drum major, beloved son, friend, and little brother (to more than just his actual siblings). He was 17 when he passed away in a car accident last October. He was from Knox, IN.

In his honor, Drew's family and friends have started an organization called Drew's Gift. It's focus is on keeping music in children's lives. After only a few months in existence, it gave out its first music scholarship last May to a classmate and fellow drum major at our high school. This will continue to be done annually, and it is the hope of all involved that our financial aid grows to also help pay for instruments for students' whose families cannot afford them alone. We've begun with a focus on our and Drew's community, but hope to continue to grow our area into surrounding communities and perhaps the entire state in time.

On August 4th, we are holding our first major fundraiser for Drew's Gift. There will be live and silent auctions, a motorcycle ride, live music, merchandise, a hog roast, and more. All proceeds go to our organization and will be used to support music in our community. I'm incredibly honored and excited to be a part of this.

I posted this today just to share his story, to keep his memory alive, to ask you to check out some of his music, and to reflect on the important people in your life. Don't waste a chance to say I love you. And, hey, if you're in Northern IN, maybe stop by. Location and details can be found in links below. Or, if you're so inclined, there is a PayPal donation button on his site.

Links to his page, news stories, and music are below.

EDIT: Fixed links.

From Greene county daily world. (Linton, Indiana)

There's a scam going around Greene County that preys on the elderly -- offering them boxed meat products at greatly inflated prices.

So far, the theft/fraud scam has taken several innocent victims for hundreds of dollars, according to Greene County Sheriff's Deputy Jim O'Malley.

Police need help from the public in putting a stop to the unlawful transactions.

The perpetrators are reported to be two, fast-talking, respectable-looking Caucasian men, who have been identified as driving **two different Ford F-150 pickups with a chest-type freezer in the bed. One truck is blue, while the other is white,** according to O'Malley.

**One suspect has dark hair and is described as 6-foot-2 in height and weighing between 300 and 350 pounds. He's clean cut and has short hair.**

**The other man is younger and is about 5-8 tall with a slender build and blond hair.**

O'Malley said police have been able to obtain a good photo of the dark-haired older suspect from surveillance videotape at Bloomfield State Bank, where he quickly cashed a check after a recent fraudulent transaction.

The scam was first reported about a month ago and to date has victims or near-victims in Jasonville, Worthington and Bloomfield and the most recent report was Feb. 14.

One victim is reported to have received about 30 pounds of meat for $1,200. Another woman reportedly paid $180 for a box that she thought was full, but contained just a pound and a half of meat, according to O'Malley.

""We just can't catch these guys,"" O'Malley said in a frustrated tone of voice Wednesday afternoon.

The pair is allegedly selling meat in black-colored boxes that have no brand names or logos on them. There is an official-looking United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection sticker on the box, but O'Malley isn't sure it is legitimate.

One recent brazen illegal transaction reportedly took place in the parking lot of the Dollar General Store on the south side of Bloomfield in which an elderly couple thought they were buying 17 boxes of meat. However, after the suspects drove away, they realized that one of the men somehow had swiftly removed all of the boxes except one from their ""station wagon"" type car. One man reportedly took the items while the other man was talking to the couple and having them write a check, O'Malley explained.

There have also been reports of the duo in the rural areas of the county trying to bilk victims out of money or checks, O'Malley said.

In a case or two, younger children have been told that ""mothers"" have ordered meat and they are at the residence to deliver it and pick up a blank check.

Checks have been handed over and filled out in names that O'Malley suspects were simply lifted from the phone book.

""They appear to be cashing all the checks as soon as they get them,"" the deputy stated.

All county police agencies have been notified of the scam and told to be on the lookout for the suspects.

Anyone who has information about the case, or if you've been a victim, is asked to contract O'Malley at the Greene County Sheriff's Department at 384-4411.

""Most of these people (elderly victims) are on fixed incomes. These guys are just ripping people off. It's like they have no conscious whatsoever,"" O'Malley added.

SkiDude	15	4	22	"I've been hearing quite a bit about Right to Work in the news lately, and also last year when the Democrats fled to Illinois for a while. I've been looking at it trying to figure out why it's a good or bad thing, but I don't understand why it's so controversial, or how it could help/hurt the job market.

Being a bit of a number geek, I decided to run some numbers. Using Unemployment rates from [here](http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm) I ran unemployment rates vs states with and without RTW.

Indiana's Unemployment rate: 9.0%

Average Unemployment rate RTW states: 7.718%

Average Unemployment rate non-RTW states: 7.979%

Average National Unemployment rate: 7.864%

Median Unemployment rate RTW states: 8.05%

Median Unemployment rate non-RTW states: 7.95%

Median National Unemployment rate: 8.0%

The numbers seem to show that Right to Work neither helps nor hurts unemployment rates, which seems to go against TV ads on both sides. So Indiana. Is this bill worth all the fuss, why or why not?"	t5_2qn7d	True

I ""have a friend"" who works at Holiday World down in Santa Claus, so it would be pretty cool if it was there. I might even be able to score some free tickets for some kind of drawing or something.

In Indiana we are also very close to Kings Island, which would be pretty cool too, I suppose.

Basically I was thinking meet up in the morning and ride a few rides together, break into smaller groups until lunchtime, huge group lunch, small groups again. meetup for some last rides together, then leave and get dinner together somewhere nearby.

I mean, I've never done this before so this could sound really dumb. I just thought I'd throw it out there. Any opinions would be welcome, especially those about where, and very rough timelines.

We both enjoy camping, hiking, outdoorsy stuff like that and figured that by camping we would also save the cost of a place to stay. The problem is that I don't know where to start looking to find an area that has pretty woods, trails, or a place to camp. I thought perhaps Reddit could help!

 We would prefer an area that has drive-in style camping, so that we don't have to hike very far in with our things, but has trails to explore during the day. I've looked around a little and was thinking that the town of Carmel/surrounding area would be a good location for us to meet as it is pretty much smack dab in the middle of our drive, so somewhere in that region would be great.

Today, I can't reach the Knox County clerk by phone, and it's impossible to mail something and get proof-of-payment back in two days (which is when my home state will suspend my license).

Is there anyone local who could help? I would PayPal the $25 plus some extra to someone local who would be willing to go to the Knox County courthouse at 620 Busseron Street and pay $25 for this ticket (I have the case number etc which I can provide), and then fax me proof of payment.

*Wild Indiana is a guide to more than one hundred and fifty of the Hoosier State's best outdoor destinations. It may be hard to believe, but there really are sand dunes, prairies, old growth forests, and other natural wonders left in Indiana. This book will show you how to get to those places, and tells you what to expect once you arrive. Wild Indiana contains more than 160 maps and 65 illustrations. Each destination entry includes GPS coordinates, detailed driving instructions, references, and a short narrative description. I've been traipsing around Indiana for more than twenty years. During that time, I've explored every destination in this book (and many others), most of them repeatedly. Wild Indiana is a compendium of my favorites. I hope that it will help you enjoy visiting natural Indiana as much as I have.*

It's been out for almost a year but I am new to Reddit and thought this might be a good way to get the word out... If you are interested, you can get it on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Indiana-Michael-Habeck/dp/0982592906/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1284859827&amp;sr=8-1) or better yet, try stopping by one of your local independent bookstores and see if they have it.

BerriesOfHemp	11	3	22	"Inbetween 86th and Westfield and 86th and College, there's a huge area with a Target and a small area with stores lined up along the right. In that strip, there's a Bagel joint I used to work at called Bagel Fair. Best kosher bagels I've ever had. 

Could anyone go there on a Sunday morning and grab one of their Biali's for me? I live in Japan and obviously can't go and eat one, but I miss them so much... It's been three years since I've been stateside and about four since I've been able to even taste 'em.

I remember working there every Sunday morning and getting one of the Biali's right as they come out of the oven... I'd slice them (really hard considering how flat they are) and I'd put Pastrami, American Cheese, and Cream Cheese in the center. It really match the soaked onions, salt, and poppy seeds strewed on top and went even better with an Arizona Green Tea w/ Honey... 

Every Sunday was filled with heaven. 

If you do go, and the Baker with the Goatee is still there (his name is Jon), tell him Casey says hello?

I know its strange, but man reddit's good at these kinds of things and I figured I'd take a crack at asking. I just want to see it all again... 



Edit: Thank you all for offering to go and do this for me. I know it's really random to have some guy on the Hoosier forum ask other Hoosiers to eat bagels and say hi. It means a lot to me. Honestly working on a bit of some waterworks here at my computer at work. T_T "	t5_2qn7d	True

1339203441.0	ushqc	Anyone else tired of Indiana American Water having monopolistic powers to rip people off on their water bills? (Their rates are even going up)	brokeboysboxers	12	1	11	"Growing up in the country, my family never paid a water bill. Now that I moved to a small town in central Indiana, I have a water/sewer bill. I have a roommate, and we work really hard to keep our utility bills low. One bill we cannot bring down, is our water bill. Keep in mind we have no washing machine, no dishwasher, we limit our showers, and we have checked to make sure we have no leaks, or running toilet.

Last month, I was reviewing my bill, and was shocked at the usage compared to fees. My bill was $56, one of my lowest yet. $31 of it was just for fees (only a few $ being in taxes) and only $25 of it was for actual USAGE.

I read today, that Indiana American Water just got approval to raise their rates once again. It will be an 8% increase, after an already 26% rate increase in 2010. [PROOF](http://www.courierpress.com/news/2012/jun/07/no-headline---ev_water/?partner=RSS)

I also learned that the 'Indiana' American Water company, is actually located in Illinois near Chicago.

I just can't get over the fact that my water bill is higher than my gas and electricity bills COMBINED!! I want to get some feedback from people that have more experience with this company, and see if you guys want to get some change with this. It's not fair that this privately run company from one of the brokest states in the country, has the ability to screw all of these people over on their water bills. I called friends in MULTIPLE other states, to find that on average, they pay between $20-$40/month on their water bills.

My friends and I always just end up doing the un-planned bar style ring-in.  But this year I want to do something a little more adventurous.  We had talked about going to the White Rabbit Burlesque Bingo, but the tickets are sold out.  If anyone has any ideas, or would just like to share their plans, I'm sure any suggestions will help steer my group, and any other redditors, in a fun direction.  We are looking into this [Masquerade Ball](http://www.317area.com/indianapolis/wholesale-district/events/120509/new-years-eve-masquerade-ball-5th-annual.htm), but the $50 cover is a little pricy for my group, we may have to suck it up if no one can help us here.

I'm working on a book for my undergraduate thesis. The paper's due in in a month's time. I found out a few days ago that all the personal papers of one of the authors (including corrected proofs of the book manuscript, and letters between the two authors) are held in the Indiana University library. Unfortunately I'm from the UK.

The library have offered to photocopy and post these things to me - probably at the cost of about $200, and I'm guessing they would arrive about a week before my thesis is due, so too late to do anything useful with.

Reddit mission is: to go to the library and either a) pick up the photocopied pages (probably about 150 in total) and scan them, then email the scans to me. or b) go to the library and scan the manuscripts themselves (I'm not sure if you'd be allowed to do this), then email them.

This would be a whole day's work for sure so it would require saintly patience, and result in MAXIMUM KARMA. You'd also get to read a hilarious 1950s book about synthetic food saving the world.

Just thought I'd give a heads up to any one out there... 

They seem to be following this guide:

An Unethical Guide to the Street-Sold Stereo Speaker Business:

- kindly submitted by Le Saint, of Montreal Canada.

Do you want to make money?  Does the thought of bringing home a $1,000 a week while having the time of your life interest you?

It's easy as long as you (1) have a legal business license for the town you intend to sell in, (2) work for the local stereo speaker scam company, and (3) want to make money!

All you need to learn are these few skills:
""The Hit""

Here you will learn to pick the best target to sell to. Within the business, these people are referred to as ""hits.""  For obvious reasons, the ideal person to choose is the single male, age 20-35. These particular individuals seem to enjoy their electronic gadgets, regardless of cost, and the more high-tech they sound, the more they want them.

Men in expensive cars and trucks are the best to choose because they don't mind spending the extra money on nice things.

Preferably, these men are driving alone because when there is more than one person in the car, it makes it twice as difficult to focus your energy and influence on the ""hit."" Also, the other person can have time to think about what is going on and may clue in their companion.
Avoid the elderly! Unless they seem to be particularly hip, the majority of the population of over-60 individuals in this country have no desire to spend their social security checks on big speakers. Also, you may be putting all of your energy into the show that will have no results while the perfect hit is driving right past you.

Wives and girlfriends can be dangerous to your efforts, as well. If you see someone fitting this description with your intended hit, pass on them unless you're feeling brave, because there is nothing more demoralizing than a spineless man who after buying into your whole story says ""I love these things, but let me go ask my wife.""  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the man will return, crestfallen to inform you that SHE doesn't want them.

A single woman in a car is a different story, however. While never as easy to sell as a man, women can also be convinced that they need speakers, but remember that you cannot be as aggressive with the sale.

""The Pitch""

This is the most important part of the entire process. The pitch is which you quickly (since you may be speeding down a road yelling out the window) tell your hit what you have to sell and why.

The story that you use is always the same. Why?  Because we have been in this business since the seventies and it works! The pitch must be given with all the excitement that you can muster. Remember, you are trying to convince your hit that you are sitting on $6,000 of surplus equipment.

The pitch is:
"" Hey man, hey guy! Want a big set of speakers for your house? I work for an audio company and they just overloaded me!"" 

The majority of the population has an attention span of thirteen seconds before their mind begins to wander. This is because everyone is so used to the short spot commercials they see all day long on TV, so make it quick.

After shouting out the pitch, follow it immediately with ""Pull over and I'll show you!""

Always tell your hit what to do. The concept is to take control of their mind, making them think in an ordered way as you follow through your routine. Therefore you never ask the hit to pull over, because they have the option of saying ""No.""  Just tell them to and you will be surprised how many people follow you to the side of the road.
""The Show""

This is the time to let your dramatic skill shine. You are about to bring the hit to the van and actually show them the product that you are trying to sell for much more than its worth, so you must be convincing.

You are only supposed to be a delivery driver who got overloaded, so don't act too knowledgeable about the speaker. You will be give a spec sheet that has the dimensions of the speakers and false power ranges and additions that do not exist, but they won't know this. All they see is the shiny, laminated, professional looking sheet, and you.

When the hit gets out of their car, bounce up to them and grab their hand, shaking it while explaining the following story. Be sure to include any possible detail that you think might have occurred, since it will make your story much more believable.

If you just won the lottery, I bet you could tell someone everything that happened to you that day, minute to minute.

You tell the hit that you arrived to work in order to pick up your daily deliveries, and someone in the confusion of the morning accidentally doubled your order since regular speakers come in pairs, but the ""special"" studio monitors that you have actually sold individually.

Treat the hit as thought they know more about everything than you do. Build their ego and they will become your instant friend. While at the warehouse, the foreman signed the invoice (an imitation copy given to you every morning at the office), and you left with the extra speakers.

Make your boss out to be a real hard-nose, so that they feel bad for you, the minimum wage earner, and forget about the moral side of the issue. You need to bring back $200 for each pair sold, but the suggested retail price on the spec. sheet is $850 apiece, so you have a lot of leeway since all other money over $ 200 is your to keep.
While talking non-stop the whole time (don't give them time to think) occasionally shove the spec sheet in front of their face for emphasis, but not too often or the hit will concentrate on the sheet and your words will lose their emphasis.

Now show them the speaker, all the while telling them of the different interesting things that these ""professional quality"" speakers have that others don't. Remember, these people did not leave their house with the intention of buying any speakers that day, so it's up to you to convince them that they need these things.

Always look them in the eye, as well. It may make them nervous at first, but once they become caught up in your voice they will see you as less shady. Tap the woofer of the speaker to show them the quality of the polypropylene, but not too hard. In order to make it sound more solid, hit the wooden box of the speaker with the palm of your while your finger taps the woofer.

After going over the other qualities of the speaker, it's time for the sale. If the guy is still there at this point, you've got him interested so close the sale and get your money! The easiest way to reach this point is when you finish the whole story immediately follow it with ""So Bill (always use their name if they tell it to you), what's the most you can do?""

Then STOP! Do not say another word.

The Close

This is the only part of the show where silence is golden. You have asked the buying question, now leave it to the hit to bring up a figure. Wait five minutes if you have to, all the time staring at the hit with an expectant look on your face.

After receiving his offer, blow it out of the water with a ridiculous over-offer. You never know how much money your hit can get his hands on, so don't cut yourself short.

Pitch 'em high, look 'em in the eye, and watch 'em buy.
After haggling (""Come on guy, I know what these are worth, I'm not gonna just give 'em away! What's the most, most, most you can do?""), decide on how much you can get out of this person, and once your reach that figure, immediately say ""Where do you have to go to get the money?"" 

As you say this, grab his hand again and shake it as if you just sealed the deal, pick up the speaker and start walking it to his car. If the door is unlocked, o pen it and stuff the speaker in. If the hit had any doubts about the status of the sale, they are gone now. This is called ""the slam.""

Off to the Bank

If you are working with a partner, ask the hit if you can ride with him to the bank, already assuming that you are going there: ""Not that I don't trust you or anything, man, but you know how it is.""

Have your partner follow the two of you in the van, in case the guy tries to flee with the goods. At the bank, get out and follow him to the ATM, teller, or whatever, and stand right next to him, all the while talking about something other than the sale, so that he does not think about the fact that he is about to take out hundreds of dollars for something that he doesn't need.

If you happen to see that he has more money in his account, don't be afraid to make a scene accusing him to trying to scam YOU: ""Hey, guy, come on, these are worth almost $2,000 a pair and I'm giving them to you for $600 (a $400 profit under the false front of a good deal), you can do another fifty bucks."" They may buy this, they may not, but it's worth the try, and the sale is technically already over so it's hard to screw up at this point, since you are in control.

I'm an Ohio resident, and I've got some friends in Illinois. We're very interested in meeting somewhere in the middle and renting a cabin.

I'm looking for somewhere out of the way, perhaps with an opportunity for river kayaking somewhere nearby. Others in the group are extremely hopeful that they might attend a wine tasting.

It looks like there are cabin rentals and campgrounds all over the state, but based on what I know about such things here in Ohio, campgrounds can often be quite far from equal. Where are some of the best places in the state to do a little camping, canoeing, and wine sipping?"	t5_2qn7d	True

I am trying to find three guys who went out west for Sasquatch last year to see if they are attending again this year! I am from Alberta and camped next to them last time. If you were camped between an Aussie couple and an Albertan couple (we had a red jeep if that helps) then you are likely the fellows I seek. We partied together the whole weekend and had a great time, but never shared any contact information. But, you guys did say you were active redditors, and I hope you subscribe to your home state's subreddit. If you remember me, (I am the dude from the Alberta couple) you should message me so we can plan to meet up this year. Or, if you aren't going, you should still contact me in case you ever decide to road trip to Alberta and need some local help!

And for everyone who isn't them, if you know three guys who went last year and two of their names start with a C (possibly K) or a J (I can't remember the last guys name, I feel ashamed, but we were wasted most of the time) please direct them towards this post!

Thank you, and I hope to meet more pleasant fok from your friendly state this year!"	t5_2qn7d	True

I have known people who live in Vincennes for about 12 years now, and the topic had never come up.  When I told my father-in-law that I wanted to go down there, he responded with a dirty look, followed by ""I don't think so.""

Turns out, the place has almost taken on ""those we don't speak of"" status with the locals.  My in-laws thought I was nuts to even want to go down there.  They said there was a guy who lived in the first house who had been know to greet outsiders with a shotgun.  Another friend said that he had gone down there several years ago to try and find a R/C airplane he had lost control of while flying in the French Commons.  He described them as, ""not friendly, not helpful, and quite threatening.""

Nearly a century ago, the area was used as a harvesting base for the exquisite Wabash pearls.  Hence, Pearl City.  Unfortunately, it appears that history has been totally lost.  There was no evidence of a past pearl industry, and people in the area don't think of it in those terms, rather just as ""where all those weirdos live.""

I walked through at about 8pm.  I didn't really know what to expect other than everyone I had asked to go with me had refused.  I did find it to be quite a dump, but was surprised by a couple newer-looking houses that clearly had electricity (one even had air-conditioning).  Others appeared that they may not have had either electricity or running water.  I never felt necessarily unsafe or in danger, but one thing did seem a bit creepy: I never saw anyone.  I walked the whole length of the place (took about 30 min) in broad daylight taking pictures with my big, not-inconspicuous camera.  I never saw a single person outside, and I never saw any movement or faces in any of the windows.  It got to the point that I would have felt less uncomfortable if I had run into someone and had to explain myself.  It was strange.

In the end, I don't recommend vacationing here.  Walking through with a camera may not even be a great idea, but it didn't strike me as the death chamber that many seem to believe it is.  If you really want to fear for your life, there are a couple of places in our humble Indianapolis and Cincinnati that are far more intimidating."	t5_2qn7d	True

In laporte, Indiana, we just got pulled over, On rt 80.  We were traveling in the passing lane about 75 in a 70 zone.  Unmarked cop car in front of us pulls onto the shoulder, kinda dangerously, slows to pull behind us, pulls us over.  We are 25-30 yr olds all respectful and quiet as he approached the vehicle.  The driver a 31 yr old pregnant woman, asks for the purpose of the stop after she provides her DL and rental agreement.  The officer was Loud and defensive from the outset.  While he was running the info in his cruiser we prepped her with a few questions to ask so that she could have as much info to fight a citation if it was necessary.  The officer comes back with a ticket, of course, 85 Ina 70.  She respectfully inquires about the method he used to detect her speed. Continuing his defensive front, he describes all the different methods of radar, Doppler, and ladar, all of which are usable and reliably functional while he is in motion to detect the speed of someone coming up behind him.  He did not specify which one was used in this case when asked and started walking to his cruiser before more questions could be asked.  I am confident this was an easy get for him because he knew out of states (east coasters) wont fight the tkt.  is all that this officer claimed correct.

Kinie (female) is a great short-haired domestic cat.  We really hate to part with her, but there's no way she can stay in our house because our 18 month old baby is allergic to her (the baby is allergic to several other things too, like milk and eggs), and there's another baby on the way.

Totally independent, this cat is the most laid back easy going cat I've ever met.  I'm not even a cat guy, but I learned to love this one.   She doesn't climb on stuff, she doesn't knock stuff down.   She might hop on your lap.   She likes attention but doesn't demand it.    

Kinie is fixed, and up to date on all of her vaccinations.  She's declawed on the front.   She has a minor eye condition which requires occasional eye drops, but it seems to come and go.   We have a lifetime prescription, so we can transfer that to you.    

If you are potentially interested in adopting her (no charge, of course), please contact me via PM.    We really don't want to send her to the shelter!

She lives in the Warsaw, IN area, but can easily be delivered to you.     Happy to provide all vaccination / medical records,  3 very large bags of cat food, new-in-box litter, and  a carry-cage.

Long story short, my dog and I were walking two days ago and met this cat.  She had found a hole in a building and been living there.  Today as we walked by, they people had mortared the hole up.  She was stuck inside the fenced area part with no way out.  She had very little room to move.  Without criminalizing myself, I took care of it.  She was released and I patched the hole back up.  They will obviously  see it and be pissed tomorrow, but the whole point of the patch was to keep her out, not lock her in.

I would say she is about a year+ and sweet as can be.  I know no one is ever looking for a cat; they just seem to fall in your lap.  But we can't do that.  We already have taken a stray dog and cat in and can't take another.  If you are willing to give this animal the opportunity of a caring home please let me know.'

The Indiana Senate, however, would be elected under an entirely new (to Indiana) method. The Senate would be elected by the State at-large, and the candidates would be placed on a slate. Each voter would then rank the candidates.

1358981527.0	175hhl	Question about Indiana (State Police) Ticket		17	10	54	"So driving home (I'm from Chicago) from NYC (I had a dog) for the holidays, I passed an Indiana State Trooper in Jackson / Porter county. He had pulled over and was giving a ticket to a 18-wheeler. I passed him in the right lane doing the speed limit, 70 mph.  

He pulled me over and cited me for ""Failure to change lanes for a stationary..."" (9-21-8-35-(b)(1)).  I told him I didn't know that was a law (pull over) and as I awaited the ticket, at least 30 other cars passed in the right lane. In fact, after he wrote me up he pulled over another car that passed us in the right lane.

Anyway, he told me that I should have either slowed down or pulled into the left (passing) lane and despite telling me I wasn't speeding, he issued me a warning for ""Speeding - Exceeding 70 mph on a highway.""

My mom is a teacher and one of her fellow teacher's husband's friend is an attorney. Today he quoted me $100 for his fees (reasonable) and said he could get me a ""nonmoving, non-pointable offense"" but that Porter county would charge me $200.

So my questions are:


1. Does anyone know the fee / points for pleading guilty?  $300 seems pretty steep and I'm not sure I'll get points or if they matter for insurance since I live in NY.


2. There were a couple mistakes he made (had the wrong model year of the car, issued me a warning for speeding when I wasn't and he can't prove it, etc.) so what chance do I have in fighting it by saying I couldn't move over?


3. What advice would you give based on #1 and #2?

Thanks, Hoosiers."	t5_2qn7d	True

What do I mean with ""Willing to try using""? Well, this friend is facing some serious daily challenges, and just yesterday I asked her if she ever tried using an iPad, as I think it might be very useful for someone in her Situation. That situation is, 3 years ago, she lost part of both arms, and suffered kidney damage, after contracting a deadly virus.

She had her left hand and most of her right forearm amputated, while she lost big part of her dominant right arm, and was left with heavy scaring in the area, which makes her use the longer and healthier left nub for doing most things, as her short right nub is almost devoid of any sensation. She finds her way for doing things, and copes with just that, but due to the kidney damage she had some sort of medical access point fixed on her left arm, which prevents her from using prosthetic hands (for chance of damaging that access point, which will put her in mortal danger), and prevents her from using her left nub while doing the dialysis. So she basically can't do anything for 3 hours, three days a week, while going through a treatment which many people go through, but I doubt any of them consider as nice, with or without hands.

Her situation means that simply going to best buy and playing with a tablet might be challenging, but even doing that won't answer the question whether that kind of device is a tool she can use efficiently, as she needs more than playing with the device for few minutes do determine if it will enable her making her dialysis sessions little bit nicer, and maybe even become a generally useful productivity tool. 

Basically, iPad (preferably one with siri, as voice commands might be very useful to her), or some other 10"" tablet, just for her to try and using it in the comfort of her home, in her own pace. I would've lend something of that sort myself (I have a Kindle Fire HD), but Unfortunately for both me and her, I live in Israel, so I can't do that… 

I know it's a rather strange request, but as a serious technophile, I really think there's a good chance she will find it quite useful . If you think you can help, or know someone who might, please send me a PM, or comment and I'll PM you. Of course once we converse I will give some extra details, I just want to keep my friend's privacy. 

I'm Posting this to /r/Evansville, /r/Indiana, and /r/assistance subreddits. If you think there are other subreddits, or even other places that can help, don't hesitate to leave a comment or PM me.

Thank you for reading, Jake.

**Indiana State Police advise where to donate, volunteer for tornado cleanup and recovery**
By Dann Denny 331-4350 | ddenny@heraldt.com
March 6, 2012, last update: 3/6 @ 12:32 am

The Sellersburg Indiana State Police Post and other state police posts say they’ve received a slew of calls from people asking how they can help their fellow Hoosiers who’ve been ravaged by Friday’s string of devastating tornadoes.

Police officials say there are many legitimate ways to make cash donations, such as media organizations that are holding telethons. While the Indiana State Police does not endorse or recommend any particular organization, it is providing the following options:

• United Way: To make a cash donation or to volunteer, call the United Way Volunteer Service at 812-287-0519 or visit them in person at 723 Spring St., Jeffersonville. You can also click on http://www.metrounitedway.org/comm/Article.jsp?ArticleID=9 and the appropriate tab to volunteer or donate cash.

• Red Cross: To make a cash donation or to volunteer with the American Red Cross, call 800-733-2767, visit the office at 510 E. Chestnut St. DR384, Louisville, KY 40210, or go to www.redcross.org.

• Another comprehensive list of legitimate locations to make cash donations can be found at the Indiana Department of Homeland Security site at http://www.aidmatrixnetwork.org/CashDonations/Default2.aspx?ST=INDIANA.

Police officials say that contacting these organizations instead of police will reduce the number of inquiries, thus enabling those posts to keep their phone lines open for emergency calls.

Officials from the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security are cautioning Hoosiers to know who they’re donating money to before making a cash donation. They say that while there could be legitimate groups making door-to-door collections, more often than not, money given to door-to-door collectors is diverted to personal gain.

Other options

A press release from U.S. Rep. Todd Young’s office said those who want to help with cleanup and recovery efforts can contact 812-287-0517 or go to 723 Spring St. in Jeffersonville between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. It is the official volunteer coordination site.

Young said people can donate food, clothing and other supplies at 700 Patrol Road in Jeffersonville, off of Ind. 62 in the Census Bureau Warehouse. This is the main supply drop site. It’s not a distribution site.

  When I grew up in a small farm town here in Indiana, we had a local doctor. The doctor closed his practice sometime in the late 80s and everyone started going to the next town over for medical needs.  Now those doctors are aging, no new doctors move to the area, and many are just closing up their practice when they retire.  The folks in the small communities are being forced to drive over an hour just to get medical care, something that can be hard for the elderly or chronically ill.  Now apparently the larger healthcare networks are shutting down some small practices without giving reason! (They also shut down our local maternity ward, which means women have to drive over an hour to give birth in a hospital leading many to opt for inductions rather than try to brave an hour of labor in the car.) 

It's getting more and more difficult to get in to the ones who are still around too.  There are days (sometimes weeks) of waiting for appointments, doctors are not accepting new patients and certain insurance plans or they can't take anyone on medicare/medicaid. With no walk-in clinics around, people find they have to drive to Indy for a sinus infection. 

Personally, I gave up finding a local doctor a few years ago after having a bad experience with the only one in town still accepting patients so I drive 1 1/2 hours for medical care in Indy.  

Anyway, I know it's not an issue that's going to have any effect on you if you live in a larger city, perhaps longer wait times due to the influx of patients from smaller towns, but I think it's a serious issue we really need to start looking at, perhaps offer some kind of incentive packages to new doctors looking to open practices in smaller towns?

I caught him lying in a bush while I was taking my dog out for a bathroom break. Needless to say I frightened him as much, if not more, than he frightened me.

I took the time to talk to him. I told him about the local shelter (Faith Mission for Elkhart) and he told me he had been kicked out for fighting. Maybe he was telling the truth, maybe not. It didn't really matter. I felt obligated to help him out. I brought him some food and a big-ass ugly blanket my fiancée and I never used anymore. During the course of the next week I talked with him a few more times, let him take a few showers since it was still getting pretty warm during the day, and he got set up with temporarily free housing through my landlord. He ended up stiffing my landlord ultimately, but that's not the point.

The experience sort of resonated with me. In the weeks that followed I began noting the number of people with a certain ""homeless"" look about them wandering the streets of Elkhart. Once I started looking I couldn't help but see them. Then the weather got cold and crappy and I noticed I was still seeing them. I made a personal decision then to try to help in a proactive and immediate way. I couldn't fix these guys problems. I couldn't get them all set up with free housing. I couldn't even feed them all, but I did have a few more extra blankets lying around and a fair amount of free time. Also, I had friends, and they had old blankets lying around as well.

For the next several weeks I would go out randomly, especially when it got really cold. I had a backpack with a few old blankets, some worn out gloves and a few exceptionally ugly winter hats. On the really cold nights I started to take a thermos full of hot chocolate and some extra cups as well. What I found shocked and changed me.

The number of people sleeping on the streets in Elkhart, even during the coldest nights, is overwhelming. I expected to run into maybe three or four tops. I ran into that many on my first two nights. I was running out of blankets faster than I could beg them from friends. Homelessness on the streets was a real problem, even in a place as small as Elkhart.

I decided to organize. If I was really going to be able to help I was going to need to find more winter gear and more blankets, the best way I could think of (after I bought out goodwill a few times) was to ask people to donate old blankets and winter gear they no longer needed or used. I printed up flyers and posted them wherever I could, talked to churches, spoke with local homeless service providers and got busy.

Alas, there is only so much that one man can do, even with unlimited free time (which, my free time is limited, believe you me.) I came to r/SouthBend looking for a little help in spreading the message and hopefully finding more sources of donated blankets and winter gear (we mostly need blankets thanks to the wonderful people at Faith Mission who heard about what I was doing and unloaded bags of gloves and hats on me.) I figure I have a fair shot of catching a few Goshen/Elkhart locals lurking in here as well.

I've started a website, and am in the process of establishing The Warmth Project as a 501 (c) 3 not-for-profit charitable organization so that I can feel comfortable accepting cash donations to purchase goods for the project. I mention this only to stress that I am not looking for cash donations. I cannot accept them. I've had to turn down many people with good intentions (and no blankets) when they have tried to offer cash previously. The website http://thewarmthproject.net has the information about what we do and what we're looking for and how we can be contacted. What I'm looking for is people who can maybe spread the word around to people who have blankets lying around collecting dust. I also wouldn't mind trying to find people willing to volunteer to go out on the really cold nights (which, hopefully, we won't see again until next winter) to help me cover more area. I go out on foot, so I am pretty limited in range and my biggest worry is that there are still people out there I am missing. I figure that for every one I find there are probably about two or three that I don't, if not more. Also, I can only focus on the Elkhart area. 

Thanks a lot for sticking it out this far if you're still reading. I appreciate any help, and so do the people I go out to find.

I would like to attend this year, and be a food vendor, with a very unique and novel marshmallow product.  I am a young, broke, passionate entrepreneur/inventor from Texas and I need your help! 

In short, I want to debut a Marshmallow-based product at the festival this year.  I've heard the attendance is around 35,000, and could see that as a great test-bed of taste buds.   It is named after the Kraft production facility there, and ultimately I am hoping to be able to talk to someone from Kraft and pitch them the idea to them in the hopes that Kraft would work with me on it.  I know its a bit outlandish, but I think that with the right intellectual property and trademarks applied for beforehand, I might be able to work WITH Kraft instead of against them.   

Thanks in advance to anyone who might have some information for me.  If I get to go, i'll be sure to give out free products to any redditors that stop by!

1360798557.0	18h70v	Car stolen in December and never recovered, received registration renewal in the mail today :(	Cermo	6	2	5	But the *real* reason I'm posting is: do I just ignore the renewal?  There's no option that I see to declare the car stolen or even sold, and I can't find any pertinent info at the bmv site.  I tried calling but I was too late to get them on the phone, and I'll try again tomorrow... just wondering if anyone else has been here before.  Thanks.	t5_2qn7d	True
1360722977.0	18f3r2	Traveling band seeks shelter between Bloomington and Indianapolis, please help! 	johnnyzito	7	2	2	"I'm traveling thru Indiana touring an indie horror flick across America. I'm trucking along with a 6 piece ska band.

We're playing the Irving tomorrow night in Indianapolis. Right now we're in Bloomington without a place to crash.

We were just going to sleep in our box truck, as we had in the south. However it's going to get really cold tonight and possibly snow. 

If you live anywhere between Bloomington or Indianapolis, and you have a huge heart, please let us sleep on your floor. 

Check out my Facebook.com/johnnyzito for weeks of photo evidence that will support my story.  I can also provide a few references of other redditors we've bunked with on this tour. 

Thanks! 

Happy Abe Lincoln/Charles Darwin's birthday! "	t5_2qn7d	True
