When I uploaded it onto the computer I had to cut off the uneven outline (I had taken a picture of it at a slight angle, so it didn't come out with right angles). After I cropped it, I saw that I liked it better than the uncropped original. 

Initially I felt crappy. Why couldn't I make it look like that in the first place? I didn't make it as good as it could've been. Argh.

Then it occurred to me - the painting simply wasn't finished yet. It took a new perspective to figure it out, but now I know how to make it better. I'm going to use a straight edge to crop the painting into the way I like it. Then, and not until then, will I be done."	t5_2qirl	True

1369793716.0	1f8qo5	My dad is dying and I want him to pick up a long-lost hobby/passion.	sh00ks	20	2	5	"My dad was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in 2002. By then, it had already spread to his cranium, ribs, pelvis, and leg bones. The doctor gave him 2 years. He didn't tell our family; he kept it a secret so we could live, if only for a few more months, in blissful ignorance. That protective bubble lasted 8 years up until the moment I found a medication bottle with a very long and complicated label. As a result of natural curiosity, Google delivered me the news.

Despite knowing he didn't have much longer to live, that motherfucker worked everyday to help my brother and I pay our way through University. He encouraged us to follow our passion and to never work a job we didn't love. We listened: my brother took Fine Arts and I, Film Studies.

Even when his muscles began to deteriorate and the pain was so unbearable he would be lucky to get a couple hours of sleep, he worked. Not until this March, when his legs literally could no longer hold his weight did he have to resign from the architecture firm. Worked on a Tuesday - collapsed - unable to work on Wednesday. It killed him inside. A man who has worked for 40 years suddenly forced, against his will, to stop. He cried that night. I've only ever seen him cry at his father's funeral when I was 10. Powerful, to say the least: your hero, the man you look up to in every possible way, is helpless.

Since then, he had been quite literally on his death bed. The palliative care nurse visited him and told us to make funeral arrangements. We did. We cancelled his cellphone and my sister's wedding booking, which was suppose to be his birthday surprise. I imagine getting that deposit back hurt her in ways I will never understand.

I say ""had been"" on his death bed because he was, and is no longer. After 3 days of diving in and out of consciousness, he arose telling us of a dream he was having, that he was ""operating on himself"". Now, I'm not sure what that means, but they're his words, not mine. A week passes and things are looking up - how could they not when you've internally accepted the death of a loved one and here they are talking to you over tea?

Though, he is not the man he used to be. Worse, he knows it; overwhelmed by his current condition and his inability to do basic tasks, depression set in. 

My dad is a great man and a wonderful artist. He always loved to paint, but was never able to in his spare time. He sacrificed hobbies, employment opportunities, and just about everything under the sun for the chance to be by his child's side for a few extra minutes. 

I believe if he starts painting again, it will be therapeutic for him. This father's day I want to give him the ability to do that. Unfortunately, I know nothing about painting and you guys do! Could anyone help me find some easels that would be easy to hold and rest on your lap? Due to his pain in the pelvic region, he's usually in a half sitting/half lying down position. Ideas for paints and alike would be awesome to!



I really appreciate the help /r/painting, it means a lot. 

TL;DR - My dad is dying from cancer and is depressed that he can no longer do the things he once did. I want to give him the ability to pick up his love of painting again. I'm just asking for some help on where I can buy easels and painting paraphernalia that would be easy for him to use. "	t5_2qirl	True

But it looked like a topographical map with various colors.  [Kind of like this image](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8jWmwd_IJj0/Tlcjs-RTzLI/AAAAAAAACVI/ev6Pu-CY9jg/s1600/Topo%2BTable%2B1.jpg) but imagine inside the lines are different bright colors.  The painting itself was smooth (from being sanded) and the lines of the paint were clean like that picture.  

I asked the artist years ago and he told me, but I forgot.  Well, I reached out to him again and he explained in an email:

&gt; I'm not sure if there is a technical term for it.  I basically imitate natural processes by layering different colors of paint (letting each dry before I do then next) then wearing away with a machine sander.  Splattering an uneven layer as the first layer makes it bumpy so different colors come through much like a topographical map or eroded stones.

I was wondering if anybody has done something similar to this and if you care to explain in a little more detail (or have any videos demonstrating it).  I'd like to replicate this background and paint on top of it.

I'm much more into abstract stuff and color experiments, and will probably have space for a smallish easel. 

Should I try acrylics or oil first? What kind of brushes should I get? What brands would you recommend in the vein of ""cheaper but not super shitty""? What sort of paper (canvas?) should I get? Can I mix paints? 

I'm coming in blind, so any tips or answers would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks a ton everyone! I think this'll give me what I need to get started. I think all my bases have been covered now actually (other than canvas, paints, brushes, and ways to practice mixing there's not much else I think I can learn unless it's from experimenting).

My late uncle painted this sometime in the 1980's. It was one of three paintings he did. I can't explain what the painting is about, or why he painted it, because I never really asked about it. 

However, I love this painting, and I want to have it cleaned and framed. So I was wondering if Reddit could help me find a method to let me clean the painting of dust and light nicotine stains? Any and all help would be appreciated."	t5_2qirl	True

If you are an artist and this sounds like something you would be interested in undertaking please send me a sample of your styles and i would be more then happy to look though them and find one that best matches my vision and represents my dad. I will most definitely pay for your services. 

I hope i am not violating terms and conditions here but i am a terrible artist (stick figure stage) and i always seen the amazing things redditors draw and i would love to support reddit artistis.

Please send me a PM and we can go from there. Thanks for your time."	t5_2qirl	True
1360678417.0	18dle3	Hi, I need some advice on painting this 'terracotta' warrior statue. 	Webfoor	8	1	7	"Hi everyone. I am hoping for some advice and I hope that this is the right subreddit to ask in. 

Long story short is that I live in China and for years have seen   [this statue](http://imgur.com/a/71WQp) outside of a restaurant. Recently the place closed and the local hoods took it upon themselves to desecrate this dude. 

I have time and interest and would like to repaint him so that he looks as awesome as he should and I have the following questions which I hope you can help answer.

1) Should I do anything before I begin painting? I have already thoroughly washed and disinfected.

2) Should I use a primer? Would white spray-paint be a good idea? What would be a better idea?

3) Can I use acrylic paints and a fixative? What would be a better option?

Thank you very much in advance and I appreciate any advice.

2. The second company wants to send out the canvas to a partner of there's to get it scanned. This is more expensive, slow, but I feel will be the beat quality. However I don't really want my art to be shipped.

I did a surrealist/bubblegum/squishy take on the politics from 08. I want to start a new series for the upcoming election but want some fresh ideas. I am not sure what the teacup represents. I just like painting them. I think the critters are obvious. Should I use the donkeys and elephants again? Skip the cups?
I like Romney's ""mittens"" nickname but want something equally as cute for Obama if I use it.


Any ideas are welcome- be as silly, kind, mean, sarcastic as you want.


My topic ideas thus far are:


Healthcare but I don't want to use typical hospital imagery

economics

civil rights

voter fraud/registration 

any interesting campaign bloopers

So I'm using a photo from [TackORama.net](http://tackorama.net/) [A fun retro stock photography site. A lot of the photos are of unknown origin and unknown copyright status] to paint from.

I recreated the image myself onto the canvas, but I didn't take the original photo (because it's from the 50's). Is it ""my"" work? Can I hang it in a gallery with my name on it? Can I sell it? If not, how much does the image need to be altered before I can? Not that I would with this particular piece, but I'm rather enjoying painting retro photos. 

Just want to know if I can call it my own, or what I *should* be calling it!

However, I love seeing the talent within people. I want to inspire creativity and find the most talented people out there to build something special. 

I have thought of different mediums to find my talent, but would like to start with a painting challenge. To do this, I have a few questions to get in the heads of some of the internets most talented painters:

1. How much prize money would incentive you to paint something (min. 24 x 30) if royalties were included on any money your painting made?

2. Ideally, how would you like the prompt to be presented to you? Would you like a very specific prompt were very few details are left to decide on your own? Or would you like a more open ended prompt where the situation is given but most details are left up to the artist?

3. What inspires you to be creative?

Thanks for all of your input."	t5_2qirl	True

For my giftee, I am custom painting a pair of headphones with Adventure Time characters (his favourite cartoon). I am using acrylics, obviously.

The painting is going well, and I am trying to get it as smooth as possible, but there is still some ""painterlyness"" to it. I want to smooth it out some, so it looks cleaner. But I don't want to strip the paint for obvious reasons either, haha.

Any suggestions? Would using a fine steel wool or REALLY REALLY low grit sandpaper (~200 grit) gently smooth the surface and reduce the visible brush strokes without completely stripping the paint? Or would I be better off just embracing the brushstrokes?

You look at it, it waits for you. You go through your paints and brushes together. You take your time with your canvas. A week could go by or even months before you take it up again. It has to feel right. It doesn't mind and you enjoy the security of knowing you could always go back to it. That it's there waiting for you. It fills you with a sense of serenity and satisfaction.
Other times you just take a canvas by surprise. It's just sitting there looking all unspoiled. Pure and untainted. You don't know what your'e doing. You just go for it. Picking paints all will- nilly and grabbing any old brush. You squirt that paint down on any flat surface. Could be that fancy thing you bought at a nice art supply store or just a paper plate you plan on tossing out later. 45 minutes or later it's covered in your liquid energy and you're tired but exhilarated. There's splatter marks on the ground. You don't know how it happened ,but now you've got a painting on your hands. There's no room for it in your life, but now you've got find somewhere to put it. Maybe it could live in your game room. IDK.... It's nice though. You like it. It's just gonna hang on that wall all coy like. When you look at it, you remember that fleeting moment of intense fun.

And then I figure, if I'm going to get really good at this, then I'm going to need to clock 10,000 hours in. Maybe I'll do about 5 [edit: hours] per week (currently working and going to school, full time each, so very busy!).

I want to paint a Weirwood Tree [example](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/f/fa/Weirwood.png) from the A Song of Ice and Fire series.  

Anybody know what kind of paint I should use?  brushes?  How much to purchase (it's a nook, so not too big, not too small) methods for mixing colors and what-not?  I haven't painted since high school and that was over a decade ago!

Thank you very much for all replies."	t5_2qirl	True
1331154733.0	qm9mg	color matching tips?	palehorse864	6	2	4	"I'm trying to match a number of colors, though I'm having limited luck playing with my acrylics. Can anyone offer any tips on matching these colors? I put them up on colour lovers.  

I could probably get the matching colors listed, but I'm not sure they  would adhere that well to a small plastic miniature.  I'm currently using craft acrylics.

1297142785.0	fhbcs	I just recently discovered how awesome painting is. 		5	0	2	"I was sitting at about a [7] and I was looking for something, and I came across an old watercolor set from when I was young. I  got the biggest urge to paint. As I was painting, it dawned on me that the brush strokes mimic the action or image displayed. Like I was painting an ocean, and I used flowing, rolling brushstrokes for farther out, and I used more choppy brush strokes for closer in to the shore. This was really eye opening for me, and I just wonder:

Do you guys feel the same way? What do you feel when you are painting?"	t5_2qirl	True

My first inclination is to make lit windows in the buildings receding on the right hand side of the painting.   
  
More detail in the bridges, but I'd like to keep the shapes/abstract representation aspect for the background   
  
My colors are slightly limited, as I work in wood stain &amp; dye. The only color change I have in mind is to see if I can find another blue for the buildings, and to up the ""rust"" color quotient, to bring out the gold and yellow highlights.  
  
Your input is appreciated, thanks!"	t5_2qirl	True

I am fairly handy at drawing, but not so much at painting. I was thinking of creating a stencil and using that to paint the foreground and cats, and then either get UV paint or invisible ink pens to draw the stars. Is this viable?"	t5_2qirl	True

I haven't painted since middle school, but I really want to try my hand at the palette knife. I don't have any supplies, and am on a budget; what would you recommend for me to buy? I plan on using  9x12 canvas panels, [these knives] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004669XQ6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2MP17GJZ778P1) (unless someone advises otherwise), and acrylic paint. 

I've watched some videos on youtube, so I sort of know *how* this effect if achieved, but I don't know what to use. Do I need to mix the paint with something? What kind of paint do I need? What would you recommend to someone on a tight budget?"	t5_2qirl	True
