My girlfriend and I have been ketoer's since the beginning of this year. I am almost to my goal weight, but this post is dedicated to my awesome and beautiful girlfriend, celebrating reaching a milestone(breaking 140)!

My girlfriend (let's call her H), after learning that she was to be the maid of honor in her older sister's wedding, finally sat down and said, ""Enough, its time to lose weight."" She and I embarked on the keto lifestyle, eating lots of bacon, chicken, hamburgers, veggies, and salads. It was very tough at the beginning. We had a cheat meal once a week, and in hindsight, it hindered us more then helped us. 

H gradually began to notice little changes in her body, her energy levels rose, her stomach(and appetite) shrank, and her cravings gradually subsided. H has never counted calories consistently, but she has plateaued around 140 pounds(but broke 140 today!), and she plans to start counting calories, as well as incorporate intermittent fasting!

Other details:
 as I said before, she never really counted calories. She did a 24 hour fast usually once a week, and gave up beer for the most part. Ate a lot of salads, lot of fish and chicken, and she has no plans to give up keto! She does light-medium cardio 3 times a week when she can. If people want her workouts I can ask her to provide me the nitty-gritty details.



Edit: Workout details.

""Usually I like to start with the Jacob's ladder machine for 3 minutes as a warmup. I keep it on about 70-85 steps for the three minutes.

I like to do a HIIT style workout on the treadmill. 6 mph as the high intensity for three minutes, 3.5 mph for the low intensity for two minutes. I do about 4-6 sets of that.

For abs, I like doing leg raises(both on the floor and hanging), planks both on the side and face down, russian twists, crunches, side crunches, heel touches, bicycles, and anything else I feel like doing.""

Below are the pictures! Congrats to her! Go Keto!

I was really, really holding out for hitting my 2nd goal of 185 (first was 200, hit on Christmas day!), but after seeing this pic from this past weekend I couldn't help myself. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. My fiancee says I'm always too TL;DR. 

Last year around this time I was around 250, maybe 255. I knew I had to lose weight but I didn't know what to do. I didn't have a lot of free time, since we had just bought a small farm. Between my day job and the farm, I knew I couldn't fit in anything else, so any sort of exercise regimen wouldn't work. I had been lurking in /r/keto for awhile but was too afraid to start. I tried to change my overall diet, and the extra physical activity helped towards losing a bit, but I need some serious help. I felt sick all the time. Tired. It was normal for me to be on the toilet 4-5 times a day. Always had stomach issues. High blood pressure. Bad skin. Just ... a mess.

So, after lurking I just took the plunge. The hardest part was living with a non-keto person. Not in the sense that there are carbs around (chips, pasta, etc.) but that since I do most of the cooking, I need to make sure that she's still eating the way she likes to eat -- ends up that most of what I like to cook is keto with sides of non-keto. Whatever I make, I'll just make a side of rice, or pasta, or some bread, and it's the same foods we were eating before! Her weight has been maintained, and mine has gone down, so we're both pretty happy (although she says my shoulders used to be a lot more comfy when they were squishy).

I log all of my food on MyFitnessPal (feel free to add me there as big_onion!), although I feel like I have the senioritis of weight loss -- as I'm approaching my goal, I'm getting lazier with keeping track of my intake. However, my weight isn't going up, which tells me I've become accustomed to eating in such a way that it feels natural to me. I try and eat a lot of veggies, though if I feel like I've stalled a lot I'll go into what I call ""keto hardcore"" and cut back on some stuff except for the very high fiber veggies. I usually feel like shit on those days as I'm not getting enough nutrients, but I usually do that if I feel in a slump and only for a few days. It's usually followed by the I NEED SALAD EVERY MEAL FOR A WEEK craving. 

I don't cheat. Sure, I've had days where I ate some ice cream (very small cup -- way too sweet for me!), or had some beers, or even went to a Chinese buffet (which is surprisingly not bad, if you can find a good one), but I ate those things fully aware of how I'd have to adjust my eating habits immediately following to make up for it. . I tried to plan eating more carbs (especially going out to eat, when the ingredients may be unknown) before days of heavy farm work. To me, cheating implies just out of the blue inhaling a donut or something without any forethought. Call it what you will, but if I thought of it as cheating I'd spend far too much time stressing out about doing something wrong, rather than looking at the longer term goal. I'm only human! 

So, here I am at 192 (and yes, that's a baby bottle in the pic ... sadly full of sweet tea ... stupid baby showers). I'm pretty close to my goal of 185, which was what I remember weighing in 1998 when I graduated from high school. I'm no longer obese, according to Libra, and just plain ol' overweight. I feel amazing most days, and the days I don't feel amazing I usually know that I'm ""missing"" something (probably not eating enough variety). I got some bloodwork done last month and everything was right smack in the middle normal. BP, lipids, everything. I was shocked, and I think my doc (who doesn't think it's a good diet) was too. I'm a numbers guy, so seeing the data was very, very important for me.

I feel like my progress may have been slower than most, or at least slower than I imagined, but I attribute it to drinking like a fish (mixed drinks, usually with flavored water or diet soda) and too many nights of eating late dinners. Regardless, I've been very happy with it. It's been a slow enough progression that I obviously didn't notice the body change until I saw these pics side-by-side (even the fact that ALL of my jeans can be taken off without unbuttoning didn't register with me).

As I approach my goal, I think I will try and integrate some more carbs in the form of whole grains, dairy (seriously, I milk goats every day and hardly get to enjoy it!) and FRUIT. We produce meat, eggs, and dairy on the farm (all pastured birds and grass fed livestock) so I feel like a more paleo approach will work, but I'll worry about that when I get there. I don't miss the carbs. They make me feel sick. I do miss fruit and goat milk (which does NOT make me feel sick!), and we have a LOT of fruit growing on the property. This past year I made wine out of a lot of it so it certainly went to use, but let me tell you how frustrating it was this Christmas when we made hundreds of jars of preserves, marmalade, and other farm-made fruit goodies.

Cheers, and thanks everyone here and at all the other keto-related places on Reddit, MFP, and the web. I never cease to be inspired by or to learn from your stories, whether they be successes or failures. For those of you just starting, it's hard, but you'll find your groove. Take advantage of the groups you find here: sure you can diet on your own, but losing weight with this awesome community is just way too much fun.

1363954362.0	1asmdr	As a mod, I think it's important I share this with all of you. [+A confession]	11Petrichor	86	20	21	"I found Keto in October of last year. It helped me break my plateau, made me feel better, and helped me lose the rest of the weight I wanted to. 

And then life happened. I was good. I was strong through the holidays. Allowing myself to have up to 50g of carbs in stead of my usual 20g on holidays. I lost weight straight through them. And then the month of stupid happened. 

My birthday is one week before valentine's day. My anniversary is shortly thereafter. So I figured FUCK IT. I'm gonna go off keto for a week or so, get right back on, and take a cheat day for my anniversary. 

Here I am, 6 weeks after my birthday. Still not Ketoing. I got a promotion at work, and working in the mall doing retail, there are not a lot of easily accessible options for food that's keto friendly, and quick enough to grab so that I still have time to eat on my break. So I've been eating a lot of pretzels. I suck at planning to bring food with me. 

But no more. I haven't been on a scale in weeks but my clothes still fit the same. I feel like shit. I'm always tired. Tomorrow morning I am back on the keto train. 

But for some of you who may be discouraged, slip ups are part of the process. Life gets in the way. Don't be down on yourself if you mess up or fall off the wagon. Pick yourself up and get back on the right track. Here's to hitting my goal weight by summer! "	t5_2vztm	True

So I went to Panera today to try their hidden menu.  Now, I'm the kind of person that prefers to be keto low-key, so I'm not a big fan of ordering ""off the bun"" when I'm not sure how the restaurant is going to react.  

So I finally decide (get up the nerve) to order the ""Power Steak Lettuce Wraps,"" along with some food for the rest of the fam.  The girl at the counter looked at me as though I had sprouted a second head next to the first which then began spinning around and speaking in tongues.

""Uh, we don't have wraps,"" she said with the affected ennui that only a teenager can manage.

""It's on,"" I said tentatively, ""the hidden menu?""

She turned her head to the girl at the counter next to her, expending the barest minimum of energy to make the move.  ""Have you ever heard of a 'hidden menu'?"" she asked.

""Um, yeah.  We don't have that.  We had a staff meeting about that last week, and we decided not to do that.""

""Oh,"" I said dejectedly, then removed a couple other items from the order, just leaving the soup for my wife.

When they called my name for the soup, it was the manager that handed me the warm brown paper bag. ""Why,"" I asked, ""did you decide to not have the hidden menu?""

She looked at me quizzically.  ""We have that.  Who told you we don't?""

I waved my hand to vaguely indicate the girls at the end of the counter.  ""The blond girl had never heard of it, and the brunette backed her up by saying that you had a meeting and decided not to carry it.""

She was not a happy manager.  Now, at this point of the story, I should tell you with a smile how she quickly made me a power steak wrap and said, ""it's on the house,"" but the only offer she made was to have them ring it up and then they could make it for me.

Customer service failure from the counter all the way up to the manager.

I've been seeing some ""what do I eat/what do people eat?"" posts lately, so I thought it might be helpful to start a thread of the most useful/best foods (not recipes, really, but quick-and-dirty-how-to-get-through-and-thrive sorts of things). 

The ""I couldn't survive on keto without...."" stuff.  Here's mine:

* **Roasted Chicken**. Every week, I buy a roasted chicken (sure, could roast myself, but laaaazy) and separate the meat from the bones. Then I immediately huck the bones + salt + Bragg's amino acids into a pot with some water, and make a delicious chicken broth.

Chicken broth goes into the fridge, and I drink a cup or so a day, usually at night. It helps replenish salts and stuff I've washed out of my system all day from drinking water.

Chicken meat gets eaten either dipped in something delicious (mayo, mustard, [sarayo sauce which is fucking DELICIOUS](http://www.sarayosauce.com/), blue cheese dressing, etc. Also cut up and thrown in with veggie stir-frys, or thrown in breakfast-eggs.

* meat sticks of various sort (I like chorizo sticks, you can find fancy ones at good grocery stores like Whole Foods, but watch the preservatives)

* bacon. I know, I know. I bake it, which is much easier for cleanup, and you don't get grease spatters everywhere. Fuck frying bacon. When you bake it, you can also coat it with whatever spices you want. 

* beef jerky (I make my own homemade. There's been a few threads about this lately). A basic dehydrator can be had for like $35 on Amazon. WORTH IT. 

* [individually-portioned brie bites!!](http://iledefrancecheese.com/index.php/Ile-de-France-single-serve-brie-bites.php)

* cans of coconut milk/coconut oil. That shit goes in/on everything. Including my hair. 

* When I'm desperate for a smoothie, I make one from coconut milk, a small amount of blueberries (like...1/4 or 1/3 cup), some whey protein powder, and ice. It's pretty lavender, and also delicious. 

* Trader Joe's. HEAVEN. They have pre-cooked carnitas that are fabulous...and also their pre-packed meat and cheese trays [Citterio Fresco brand](http://www.citteriousa.com/products-fresco.html) are great to take for lunches.

This was especially important to do since I have been, for the most part (except for the couple of months that followed vacation), following a ketogenic diet since October, and I wanted to see how this diet was going to ruin my already awesome cholesterol numbers. 

My results (to which I stared at with a ""DA-FUQ?!"" face) are below:

Weight lost since last October: 16 pounds (again, I fell off the wagon after vacation, so this doesn't seem too awesome, but it still is, as it was done solely through the keto diet, without exercise [as a baseline to see if food alone was the cause])

Optimal ranges are according to the materials I was given by the nurse:

Total cholesterol level: 174 (optimal is less than 200); I don't have my previous score to compare it to, but it's in the optimal range, so that works for me!

HDL (Good) cholesterol: 82 (optimal is more than 60); went up from 70 during last year's test: health improved

Total cholesterol to HDL ratio: 2.1 (optimal is less than 3.5); went down from 2.9 during last year's test: health improved

Glucose: 88 (70-99 is normal, not pre-diabetic)

Pulse: 68 (normal)

Blood pressure: 116/86 (normal-ish, bottom number is 6 too much, but I was at work when tested, so the nurse said that could affect it)

The nurse actually said to me “Do you do a lot of cardio?,"" to which I replied ""Not at all. I don't exercise, aside from the home improvements I have been doing for the past few months."" She followed with, ""Whatever you’re doing, keep it up! Your numbers are great!” I then explained keto to her, and I don't think she understood it.

So, my weight may still be higher than I’d like, but I am actually really healthy. :) And this is further proof to me that body cholesterol is not necessarily affected by food cholesterol (as I have been eating several eggs a day since October). I read it in books, but I was not truly a believer. I needed to see numbers for myself.

I am now a true believer in Keto! I am drinking the [sugar-free] keto kool-aid and am back at it.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but rather shows a ""lineage of thinking"" that got us to where we are today.  Some of these publications are hard to find now, so I leave them here for you to enjoy:

* First we have William Banting in 1862: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?dihm6p5y8ah1w33
* Then followed Vilhjalmur Stefansson:  http://www.mediafire.com/view/?cdb99lowc6bedid and http://www.mediafire.com/view/?l03rvxfqqe24pxb
* Blake Donaldson based his Eskimo diet on Stefansson's findings:  http://www.lowcarb.ca/atkins-diet-and-low-carb-plans/eskimo-diet-donaldson.html
* Donaldson's diet was cited by A.W. Pennington: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/1/5/343.full.pdf
* And this article about Pennington was published in Holiday Magazine in 1950: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?f8gzqrdwckjykfa
* In 1958, Dr. Mackarness publishes the ""Stone Age Diet"": http://www.lowcarb.ca/atkins-diet-and-low-carb-plans/stone-age-diet-mackarness.html
* T.L. Cleave publishes his first paper on low carb in 1956, and then Saccarine Disease later in 1974: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?3371rv6o4cji7gy
* Yudkin cites T.L. Cleave in his 1972 publication of ""Pure, White and Deadly"": http://www.mediafire.com/view/?l2r345688wilbfv
* And then, Dr. Atkins also publishes, citing the Pennington diet: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?f65xvlvd6pq9chv

After Atkins, we of course had Neanderthin, Protein Power, South Beach, ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" and of course r/keto.

Now, we have /r/theketodiet!

Also, I had to go buy a suit for a wedding this weekend since all my old ones make me look like I'm a kid wearing my dad's clothes. Found out something nice: Not only has my waist size gone from a 38 (a year ago) to a 34, but my neck size went from 17.5 to 15.5!

Next week marks one year of keto, and me nearly hitting my goal (my weight when I graduated high school 15 years ago). This wedding this weekend has me worried, but I'm gonna power through it and honestly, if it takes another week or even another month, that's fine.

I felt like posting my results today and all the pictures that I've taken so far of my progress (Note: I have never cheated nor been kicked out of Ketosis since I've started). Yesterday I bought a small-size t-shirt and I couldn't even believe it. I think that's what motivated me to post today and also I'm in a plateau right now, so I need some love to go through!

I'm sorry I didn't take pictures the week I've started Keto, reason is I didn't believe that it would work so why would have I bothered?

Here are the pictures :

* Starting weight was between 235-240 Lbs, that's my heaviest and I was like this since highschool (2009).  [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/wKWbt)

* February 2013, 209 Lbs. Huge milestone for me, about 90 days in ketosis without cheating, the weight was coming off like I was melting! [Imgur(NSFW, fat hairy guy in underwear)](http://imgur.com/a/LIDl2) 


* March 2013, 200 Lbs. I never thought that I would ever see those exact numbers on the scale. It felt amazing to see what I had accomplished so far and it motivated me to continue! I think the ""smile"" says it all. [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/WhSmb)

* April and May, 185-189 Lbs, in a plateau since the beginning of April. It's really hard to keep doing Keto when you don't see any change on the scale, atleast you still see some in your clothes! At this point, I can't wait 'til I break free from this plateau and reach my GW. [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/WWOrc)

I feel like putting up with other people's preconceptions and prejudice the hardest part of this diet.  I don't feel carb cravings, I feel great, my physicals are fine. I'm not even ""obese,"" just overweight. But I'll be damned if everyone who ever sees me eating doesn't give me an earful of judgement.

1362535833.0	19qyee	Father just got his bi-year blood work back.  He is now a believer of keto!  	Celco217	38	6	16	"Little backstory... father is 55 years old, 5'11"", ~320lbs and has always been yo-yo'ing his weight over the years trying every diet under the sun.  He has been on blood pressure meds for years, and over the past few years hes gotten on to lipitor.  At his biggest he hit about ~390lbs.  Around 2008 he got the gastric bypass surgery.  Worked ""great"" until he hit a plateau around 310lbs and then he got discouraged.  Topper to that, he started going through a divorce with my mom (31 years of marriage).  Weight started to climb again and got back up to around 330lbs. Boils down to him getting discouraged about his weight often, vicious cycle.  

Anyways around mid January, I started on the Keto train.  Right before my fathers birthday I talked the old man into just trying out keto as well.  I promised to be our chef and keep him well cooked and motivated on his quest to diet, aka his diet buddy.  I am currently unemployed after finishing grad school and living at home with him, not that big of deal for me.   

After about a month an a half now on keto, we are both feeling better, but not dropping too much weight.  We are both hanging at some plateaus right now.  He has been getting discouraged again and was getting ready to go into his bi-yearly physical complete with blood work.  Told me that if the numbers were bad he would be getting off of keto.  

So he goes to his appointment, tells the doctor his new diet.  Of course, his doctor tries to scare him that being this big, and munching fat... hes getting ready for some serious health problems.  They do their best to scare him, take blood and tell them they will call with results.  

Well... he just got the numbers back.  After slowly rising cholesterol numbers over the past 3 or so years even with being on blood pressure  and cholesterol meds, his numbers are going in the right direction.  
From his blood test back in October to his test now... 
Total Cholesterol: From 227 down to 161
HDL: From 50 up to 66
LDL: From 150 down to 91
Triglycerides: From 173 down to 49!!!! (WOW!)

Im so proud of him!  Even if he is not losing alot of weight, he is doing great on his health now.  Who would have known some ""old fat fuck"" (his words) eating eggs, bacon, grease, and veggies would kick so much ass on dropping his cholesterol so greatly when all other attempts have failed.  Brief talk with the doctors office gave him hope about maybe getting off his meds if the numbers stay good. 

He is the ""average american"".  Ate the food pyramid, drank a few beers, fat and getting fatter, working his 50 hour weeks to have some money in his pocket, hit by the economy, had to file bankruptcy and foreclosure of the house (Mainly thanks to the ex fucking him over in the divorce). This should be a case study example for anyone.  Gary Taubes has it right.  


**tl;dr: Dad is 55. On BP and Statin drugs. Had gastric bypass. Been on Keto ~1.5 months. Bi-yearly bloodwork compared to his last test in October... Total Cholesterol: 227&gt;161, HDL: 55&gt;66, LDL: 150&gt;91, Triglycerides: 173&gt;49.  Might not be losing too much weight (about 6lbs now) but his blood is healthy like a mother fucker now!  Keto on!**

Adapted very smoothly and really loved everything about it. By September I was down to 285 and down to 270 by christmas. 

I ""maintained"" over the whole holiday season and felt successful despite eating christmas cookies and whatnot. By the end of December I was so incredibly sick of eating sugar (what a concept, eh???). I decided to do a ""no-cheat"" January. My rules: no sugar or starch. No beer (liquor would be OK).  The only exception I tolerated was $tarbucks... ""Sugar free"" mocha with whole milk.  

I dropped 15 pounds in 30 days and my energy levels skyrocked.  It was intense and amazing. 

So, its February. Yesterday the only exception I made was to have a Bitterroot Brewing Single Hop IPA on tap at the brewery.  The hoppy deliciousness was everything I dreamed it would be.  I regret nothing. :-)

Funny thing. This morning I woke up and had 2 or 3 good farts. That's really unusual these days and it took me a minute to figure out the cause and remember the beer. I regret nothing. 

So, I'm going to a friends wedding today (thus my being in Montana and at the Bitterroot Brewery). I'll eat what they serve and skip the mashed potatoes. No-cheat February is next, and no cheat lifetime seems well on the horizon. I love this lifestyle and I never want to go back. 

I'm at Perkins right now. Just finished my 3-egg omelet with pepperjack, mushrooms, and sausage (plus two sides of bacon).  I'm pretty sure the waitress already called 911 to report my impending heart attack!

Asparagus season is peaking right now, and great fresh asparagus will be available for the next couple of months in temperate parts of NA and Europe.

Asparagus is one of those vegetables that improves *dramatically* in quality during its season - fresh, local, in-season asparagus is wonderful. The stems that are no fun to eat in August are crisp and delicious in April.

There are lots of ways to prepare it, but I recommend sauteeing it. It's incredibly simple, and you can use just about any seasoning combination you want. Here's a recipe:

- Bunch asparagus
- Butter or coconut oil
- Slivered or sliced almonds
- Salt
- Pepper
- Powdered ginger
- Lemon juice

&gt; - Snap asparagus in your fingers so that it breaks at about the middle; you can also just slice off the woody parts by touch.
- Heat a pan over medium heat until it reaches a stable temperature
- Add 1tbsp butter or coconut oil, allow to melt but not brown
- Add asparagus and toss to coat in the oil; keep tossing it periodically
- Add 1/4 cup slivered or sliced almonds
- Add a pinch of salt, pinch of black pepper, and pinch of powdered ginger
- Cook, continuing to toss, until the asparagus turns bright green, about 5-7 minutes. Once it does, start checking its texture by noshing on the stem end. When the texture of the stem end is like a fresh apple slice - crisp, not chewy, not woody - the asparagus is done.
- Drizzle very lightly with lemon juice and serve"	t5_2vztm	True

I have never been thin, even when I was a kid I was chubby, and my mom always loves to remind me that the doctor told her when I was a baby that I would always struggle with my weight I think that she thinks it makes me feel better to know that for some reason. 
About this time last year I did weight watchers with a group of friends and while that did works for a little while I just hated eating all of that super processed food and it made me feel sick. After that I joined the gym, worked with a trainer 3-4 times a week and was eating a diet of mostly protein and veggies. While I could tell my fitness level had improved a bit I saw no weight loss whatsoever, not even in my measurements. That was when I went to the doctor about a possible thyroid issue, my dad takes medication for it so I figured that must be it, but nothing. At that point I was really down about the whole thing and I just sort of gave up for the past 6 months or so.
I recently came across keto while surfing reddit at work and one day there was a progress pic posted by a girl who was the same height as me and started at the same weight and got down to 160lbs in something like 6 months... I was pretty skeptical at first but I have been doing a lot of reading and looking at meal plans and feel like I can do it!
My plan is to do my shopping and some cooking on Sunday and then start it off on Monday. For now I am going to do some of the meal plans that I have found during my research phase and not worry as much about calorie counting at first, just worry about eating the keto foods and then after a couple weeks move into calorie counting. 
I am trying not to get my hopes up too high but I feel like I can really do it this time. I am looking forward to learning along with everyone else and I am thankful that there is a community like this to come to when I am struggling."	t5_2vztm	True

At my largest, I had ballooned up to 525 pounds. I did Atkins many years ago and managed to lose 130 pounds but put it back on and then some aften I injured my knee and went into a mini depression.

Around the beginning of December, I found /r/keto by accident and thought I would give this a try and make a new attempt on trying to get my life back under control. I decided that on Christmas night I would start, since this would give me time to clear the house out of non-keto friendly foods. At this point I weighed 493 pounds at my last doctor visit on December 21st.

I am now reporting in today as I made another trip to the doctor and can happily say I am down to 456. I can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel and a way to get there. My energy is up. I no longer crave breads and pastas (my weakness). This has been a miracle for myself so far. So thank you all for this community, I will post some progress pics as I get further down the line.

But on an extremely hurried morning the other day I forgot to brush (in addition to many other things in my rush to get out the door), and later in the day when I realized my mistake, I found I had much less plaque buildup than 'normal', back on carbs.  Being an amateur scientist (and/or lazy), I decided to see what would happen if I only rinsed with Listerine for a couple days, and skipped brushing.  A couple days in, and I don't feel particularly grimy, mouth-wise, and there's not much plaque at all.  My theory is that keto reduces all the crap that plaque forming germs (are they germs? I don't even know!) would use for fuel.  

Long story short, anyone else notice an improvement in oral hygiene on keto?"	t5_2vztm	True

Ideally, I would lose 45 pounds, which would bring me to 130 (I'm a 5'3"" woman). If I managed to lose around 5-10 more that would be ok too, but under 125 is too skinny for my larger frame.

Years ago I lost weight easily doing low fat, and stuck to it with no problems for 4 years. So this whole ""fat is good"" thing is foreign to me. But I've seen articles and testimonials that say keto is better than low fat, so I'm open to it!

When r/keto went all bonkers and r/theketodiet was started I was really starting to show some serious results. I posted my pics on my fb page and a lot of my friends and family were really interested in learning more about my lifestyle. I asked them how they wanted me to share my journey and the consensus was to start a new page.

I have only been doing this for 5 months now, so it certainly is not a page where I think I know everything. It is a page about my journey in keto, and helping those who had a difficult time with reddit to come together like we all do here. I'm throwing it out to all of you, because I would love input from people who are further along in this lifestyle than me to join in on advice and expertise as well. I am also open to more page admins if you have been doing this for a year or longer.

If its not your thing thats cool too. I love this life, I want to share it with the people that I love, and hope to help many more people along the way. Currently I have ten people that are in the starting stages of keto, and they love the page, and they come for advice often. It would be great if they had yours too.

Also, I often share reddit info on the page and give credit where it is due. I know there are some FB pages that take the material and use it as their own. I try my best not to be that person.

Anyway, come check it out and join. Every place that we can all come together, work at this and stay healthy is great.All are welcome!!!"	t5_2vztm	True

So I did keto for a short stint last year, I enjoyed it, but I will be honest, I found breakfast and lunches extremely difficult when trying to fit it around a working day.

I know the subreddit has been going through so up and down times lately, but when I was about here a few months ago, it was supportive and welcoming. I am hoping some of you guys are still around.

I have no one to discuss diet tips with, and I get caught up in small details and never end up with good meals when I go searching.

I dont have a designated lunch time in college as classes are different everyday, and I have no access to a kitchen for lunches. I am also on a tight budget.

I really want to get my body weight down. My mind is going to awful places considering to lose weight.

I'm hoping the community spirit comes back ASAP.

Edit: as a disclaimer, I'm good with the theory and practice of keto. I know what to avoid, and what to eat. Its just sticking to it, meal plans and getting my water intake I'm stuggling with.

Stats: 20 years old. 150 pounds. 5'0.5"". Reactive Hypoglycemic. BMR is 1,382 calories.

I've managed to lose 30 pounds in the past four months by eating whatever keto food I have wanted without any exercise. However, now I have plateaued.

I decided to cut down my calories to 1,500 a day for the past five days. It has been MISERABLE. My normally stable blood sugar was all over the place, I was irritable, I was lightheaded, etc. It is literally not possible for me to stick at 1,500 calories.

Now, before, I was easily eating anywhere between 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day. This is avoidable, since I've now cut out a lot of keto fast food. I also have begun exercising.

1358390103.0	16q649	Night shifts, low blood sugar (?), appropriate snacks? [x-post keto]	ketoker	21	2	15	"I'm a nurse, and I did my first keto night shift last night (I'm about 2 weeks into this round of keto).

I'm just not sure keto foods can keep me going through the night when my body is all fucked up from the time change and physical demands. If you've ever worked nights, you might know that your digestion kind of goes out of whack cause it's used to being asleep. I seemed to get low blood sugar symptoms that didn't resolve til I caved and ate some carbs.

**Details about food &amp; timing:**

I got plenty of sleep, woke up and ate some scrambled eggs with avocado, cauliflower &amp; cheese at 6. I drank an electrolyte drink before I left (400 mg potassium, can't remember numbers for the others, but sodium, etc.) and headed to my work.

By 8 I was feeling pretty spacy and brain foggy, but maybe it was shifting my sleep schedule.  

I packed a hearty salad with eggs, red pepper, cheese and a rich dressing for dinner + a square of dark chocolate, which I ate around 10:30. I felt a bit better, but I'm pretty sure by 2 AM my blood sugar was bottoming out - I was shaky, sweaty, vision a little blurry, and when I lay down for my break my heart was pounding a bit. I was drinking adequate amounts of water through the night (maybe should keep up with the electrolyte drinks). I ended up eating a chocolate from a box someone left in the station for us.

I felt a little better... but by 4 I didn't feel like my cheese, turkey slices &amp; raw broccoli snack I'd packed were going to give me what I needed to push on through the last couple hours of my shift. I caved and got a ginger cookie with my Starbucks instead. Felt much better after that.

I'm not that concerned about having ""cheated"" - it was not much out of temptation, but a need to resolve how shitty I felt and prevent passing out in front of a patient lol. I appear to be back in ketosis now anyway.

**tl;dr: 12 hour ER night shift, low blood sugar, keto meals didn't cut it. What could I eat to prevent this? ...I'm considering eating a piece of fruit while I'm on shift.**

**edit** do I just need more calories to sustain me through the night?

I can't guarantee they'll be good, but with 1 carb per wrapper, if anyone wants to experiment with me, here's how to do it:

Everything is to taste. If you like them creamy, use more cheese. If you like them crabby, add more crab.

* Mix about three cups of softened cream cheese with about a tablespoon of soy sauce. (Use less if just for you. This entire recipe is eyeballed but it's good no matter what)
* Add minced shallots, chives, peppers, or whatever else for veggie to taste
* Add minced crab to taste
* Once your mixture is prepared, lay out your soy wrappers on a flat surface. You may need to trim them into squares depending on the shape you are able to get your hands on.
* Spoon a bit of cream cheese mixture onto the middle of each wrapper
* Put a tiny bit of egg white along.the edge of the wrapper where you will fold to help them stick
* Fold each wrapper in half diagonally, or find a guide online to show you how to make the fancy shape.
* Deep fry your rangoons until slightly browned. It shouldn't take more than 3 minutes. You can pan fry them using enough oil to cover both sides.

My only worry with this recipe is that the wrapper won't stick to itself like a pasta wrapper, resulting in cream cheese spilling into the oil. If this happens I'm going to try baking them."	t5_2vztm	True

I need mods to help out. PM me for details. The subreddit is [1] /r/ketorecipeconversions.  Also, since this is literally a brand new subreddit I am open to suggestions/ideas that would make it better.  

My intention is for this to be a place that focuses on converting recipes that have high-carb elements in them to keto-friendly versions.  My thought was that it would be nice to have a place where someone could specifically post grandma's recipe for... say lasagna (or whatever) and request that someone with more time/skill turn it keto-friendly for them. However, i didn't want any butt-hurt-ness from people spamming this /r/ketorecipes  with requests and having to add a bunch of rules that might ruin an otherwise perfectly wonderful subreddit. 

I've also found that some people are irritated when others request carb substitutes (I guess they feel it doesn't embrace the keto lifestyle or something) and I didn't want to bother them with posts that were all specifically for carb-substitutes.

Also, I genuinely enjoy thinking of ways to get the food I actually want to eat without carbs. Its fun for me. But I don't get nearly enough time to try the things I want to try so I would like to have some mods who enjoy this kind of thing and are enthusiastic about it. I see quite a few people like that in this subreddit who comment what they think might be a good thing to try and then update just a bit later that they have tried it and it didn't work but something else did (or whatever).

So PM me if it sounds like a subreddit you'd like to be involved in. If I understand Reddit correctly, this is a self post so I shouldn't get karma from it (I think...)...

Thanks! :)"	t5_2vztm	True

1359990068.0	17v9re	Keto vs. Caloric Restriction, a personal experience. (x-post from r/Keto)	destructsean	24	6	8	"I was thinking about the past few years the other day, and I was really curious as to how many carbs I was consuming during the periods of my life where I experienced the most weight loss. Luckily, I have been logging all (well, most) of my meals into MFP for the last 2+ years. 

I started being concious about what I ate when I was 265lbs, a little over two years ago, and I downloaded myfitnesspal with a hope that I could lose some weight, and start to feel better about myself. I didn't concern myself with protein or carbs, and adhered to the typical ""low fat, low cal"" way of thought that the media/food industry basically forces on everyone. 

Well, it worked. I started out making HUGE caloric deficits, eating between 700-1300 calories a day, and I lost weight fast. I was at my lightest two winters ago, when I was 155-160lbs. It was far, far too much (for contrast, I'm sitting at 185lbs right now, and I feel great.) 

I looked back on myfitnesspal to see the average of carbohydrates/fats/proteins I was eating daily at this point, around my most successful weight loss point. It turns out, I was eating about 300-500g of carbs daily, only 50-100g of proteins, and on some days, as little as 15-30g of protein. My average caloric intake daily at this point was 1700. I wasn't cheating, whatsoever. 

At this point, I was THIN. I was also partaking in little to no exercise, and had basically lost most of my muscle mass. I felt weak, but I was happy that I was so slender for the first time in my life. I was however, obsessed with food. I wasn't happy with the amount of food I was eating, and it was a constant source of stress and anxiety. 

Fast forward to now. I gained some of that weight back (thankfully..) and evened out at about 185. I was ""skinny fat"" (which I'm still working on.)

It's been 5 weeks into starting keto, and I'm honestly feeling better than I have in a long, long time. I'm eating at maintenance, or just under. I'm working out 5 days a week, lifting heavy at the gym, doing squats, presses, etc. My body fat percentage is sitting at about 19%, and I'm much more muscular than I've ever been. I've lost 5lbs so far with keto, and I'm seeing improvement in both strength and size as far as muscle growth. 

Here's the best part though. I'm happy with the food I'm eating. 

Really, truly, happy. I'm not craving carbs. I'm not sitting on the couch after meeting my caloric goal, beating myself up for wanting to go get a snack. I feel healthier. I'm putting more REAL, UNPROCESSED foods into my body. I'm eating vegetables, good fats, quality proteins, and I'm having fun doing it. I'm cooking more. And best of all, if I engorge myself on food (like I did last night. Honestly, I ate about 3000 calories over maintenance yesterday. Don't ask, I was ravenously hungry after an intense leg routine at the gym.) I don't hate myself for it. I don't wake up bloated, I don't stress all day about how I should drink caffeine for diuresis, or eat less, or workout harder (all very unhealthy practices, I know.) I just keep calm and Keto on, as you say. 

For the first time since my weightloss journey began, I'm happy with food. And I'm happy with myself. 

And THAT'S why I enjoy, and reccommend keto. Not because I feel that it's better for weight loss than calorie restriction alone, but because it's a healthier, more enjoyable alternative. 

I hope some reads this and takes something from it. If not, downvote me out of your view. See if I care. :D

I started back in September when I heard from two of my friends were starting this diet. They explained it to me and it really got me interested, after a day or two of research I had made up my mind to start it.

It has been one of the best decisions of my life. I started 9/22/12 and my starting weight was 280's. As of 1/14/13 I am 229, just under 4 months, and have lost ~50 pounds. I honestly can not remember the last time I weighed this much! As a freshmen in high school I was 255 pounds. I am currently 24, so over half my life I was over 255 pounds. My original goal was to hit 225, but after my progress I thought maybe I can be under 200? Now my goal is to have a body I can be proud of and with keto I can do that. I just want to thank everybody for the help they have given me, especially reading and seeing all the progresses you guys have made, they have been very inspiring.

The first two are from yesterday morning (Jan 8), with my new T3i.  The next three are Week 1 (week of Jan 1), a progress pic from December, and my most current starting weight in November, which I believe is my heaviest weight, ever.

[My MyFitnessPal Food Diary](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/100PoundChallenge)

I've been counting my calories below 1500, and my carbs below 20g per day.  It's been challenging, but for the most part I haven't had many issues with abiding by it aside from a night of some alcohol and a day where I mistakenly ordered some breaded chicken wings that I had been told would have no breading at a restaurant.  I'd say the biggest challenge thus far has been my sleeping schedule and how it affects how and when I choose to eat, but I'm working on that.

For exercise, I've been avoiding any kind of heavy cardio because of back, joint, and hip pain that tends to set in relatively quickly with prolonged walking or other stressful physical activity.  Instead, I've been working on a weight training routine that I actually stole from another redditor.

Mainly it's been a three-routine rotation between working my chest/arms, back/arms, and legs/core.

At the beginning of last year, I issued myself a challenge to lose 100 pounds by Christmas, and if I had succeeded, I was going to 'reward' myself with a tattoo either on my chest or back (only if I could decide on something that was very significant to me and that I wouldn't regret).  Unfortunately, after a month I fell off and remained docile for the next six or so months.  In July I had another short stint that ended poorly, and I began again in November after my brother and his girlfriend encouraged me to join /r/loseit, I was then referred to the keto subreddit and have been doing a keto diet since.

Starting at 361.6 in November, I lost a total of 25 pounds before I slacked off during the holiday.  I hadn't gained back any weight, but I ultimately switched from my home, digital scale—which seemed to have consistency problems—to the standing balance scale at my gym.  The difference was around 8 pounds at the time, and I pulled my loss back from 25 pounds to 19 pounds, because I wanted to be sure that I was correct about my numbers.

So, on the first of this year, I re-issued myself the same challenge, except that I would aim (not unhealthily force myself) to lose 100 pounds within *six* months instead.  I actually bought myself this camera to start taking better photos and even recording video of my weekly progress to perhaps begin posting weekly recap videos of my health routines (I have yet to edit something together from the first week, but I'm working on it).  The camera arrived a few days ago, and the Week Two photos are the first to be taken with it.

I'm sure a lot of this is water weight and I may very well wind up gaining some back relatively soon, or at the very least, that big losses like this in a single week are certainly not going to be any kind of norm, but it feels unbelievable.  I haven't been below 300 pounds in I don't know how many years now.  I used to tell myself that if I ever got over 300 pounds, I didn't know what I'd do to myself (of course I wasn't serious, but still).  Now, I don't know how I'm going to ultimately celebrate being under that number, and I can't wait to be there."	t5_2vztm	True

&gt;I know there was plenty of discussion on the original post but I decided to make an entirely new thread for this because I want this to be void of any moderator hate or mob mentality.

&gt;I'm going to do what wasn't done before the change (that I'm aware of). I want the community to chime in on what they think, in detail, this change actually does. Both good and bad. IF you're going to say that this change ruins the subreddit, I think you should have at least considered it enough to weigh other options. Don't tell me you can't find progress pictures easily because you have to click a few extra times or that ""its harder on a mobile phone"". Let us air out all of our concerns here and PLEASE keep it civil. I, as a mod, can't even find the legitimate concerns in the other post for all the pitchfork raising and trolling. THIS POST is me saying that I'm not trying to ignore the general population of [1] /r/keto.

&gt;This situation has gotten very out of hand and cost the community 2 very important mods that were some of the lifeblood of this subreddit. I will not tolerate any hateful nonsense. I will delete posts volatile in nature that are in no sense related to the issue at hand.

&gt;I want to see this community stick together and do what it was intended to do. Be supportive. Changes to the aesthetics of the subreddit shouldn't divide us.

&gt;In addition, a few mentioned that perhaps we should make ONLY a select number of post types be self post only. I would be open to that kind of suggestion but I haven't discussed this with the mods yet.

&gt;Send me your thoughts, fellow Ketoers...

&gt;edit - If any of you would prefer to voice your concerns in a one on one manner and are more of a lurker, I'm on ketochat or you can PM me for skype information.

**Personal Dislikes:** Cheap Seafood (I'm not a huge fan of fish &amp; shellfish but I make exceptions when done right &amp; fresh, like sashimi, fresh shrimp salad, and poached salmon). 

Other Notes: Cooking is not an issue, I've been cooking since I was 8 and It's a passion of mine, so cooking anything is not a challenge. I'm just curious as to see what people suggest for a shopping cart.


**Overall**

My fellow Keto Redditors, give me your thoughts on certain things you would stock up on, and certain dishes you would also recommend. In return I'll try my best to make the dishes food porn worthy and post them on the reddit.


P.S.
Money can go towards grocery store spending, or going out to eat (IE. Chipotle, Wendy's, Panera, etc): As long as it's all keto/low-carb purchases.


UPDATE/EDIT:
I forgot to mention that I have access to the Oil's (We do have Coconut Oil) &amp; Spices (Salt/Pepper, Etc) in my house. I only have to focus on produce and what really makes a dish. 

Second Update/Edit:
Thank You for all the feedback, I've got a pretty good shopping cart idea going on and I'll keep you guys updated. Also as promised, I'll be posting pictures of some dishes I make hoping that they are foodporn worthy.

I eat dinner at 5:30. go to work at seven pm. eat whatever around midnight. bed at 7 am.  so a long day with less food than most.  I eat pretty healthy outside of pasta (and I eat whole grain type stuff... see I did before Keto) 

an example of what I eat.  steak often when I'm at home with my man.  today I had a ate salad with peppers and roast beef and bacon, my other meal was a salad with hamburger and cheese. yesterday a taco salad, and other meal was a massive omelet with roast beef, bacon, green pepper, tomato, and Swiss. 

am I taking in enough to loose on this?  is it necessary for me to eat more or higher fat foods ?

1366989741.0	1d5p6n	Noob about to start keto	neatospiderplant	23	8	15	"Hello Ketoers. 

I'm going to be starting keto on Monday (April 29th)and I just want to make sure I'm prepared and have it all figured out. 

I've done low carb diets before, but the whole macro aspect is new. I'm excited because when I stalled a few months ago, I tried changing things up to no avail. I'm hoping this is the fine tuning I need to do to get things going again. 

I'm also a little overwhelmed because it seems so complicated. I'm very spontaneous in the kitchen. When I  cook something, I'll decide in the moment to add other ingredients. Sometimes the thing I set out to make becomes something wholly different. I feel like adhering to macro ratios will change all that and that I'll need to plan out my meals carefully to make sure I have the right balance. 

Does that sound right? or am I over thinking this? 

Additional info in case it matters. I started last fall at 219lbs. I was originally counting calories, but hated all the numbers. I found South Beach not only more effective, but easier since I didn't have to keep running totals, I could just have as much of whatever I wanted from the permissible foods. I made it to 189lbs before I stalled and gave up. Incredibly, I've managed to maintain around 189 without any effort. I don't have an official goal weight. Maybe 170 would be ok. But I'll reevaluate when I get there. 

I've chosen to start on Monday because I figured it would give me time to prepare. Plus it's my wedding anniversary and birthday this weekend so I figure there will be cake and dinners out and it's probably just easier to wait until that's all over. 

Lastly, besides the ""useful links"" on the right, are there any recommendations for websites or videos that will help me start my journey? 

Thanks in advance!

First off, I would like to emphasize how EASY these are to make. 2 ingredients and about 10 minutes and you have yourself a Delicious ""pancake!""

Grab yourself some egg whites and Isopure protein powder (http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/nb/lowcarb.html) and you're good to go.

For 1 serving you'll need:
1 cup egg whites.
1 scoop Isopure (flavor of choice).
1 tsp Cinnamon (optional)

Mix, and cook in a skillet as you would standard pancakes! Easy as that. And these things are very filling, seeing as egg whites are the most filling per calorie. More-so then any other food.

Calories: Approximately 200.
Protein: 50g
Fat: 1g
Carbs: 0g

Plus you get all the amino acids and vitamins from the Isopure. :)

As I originally said, it's not fatty enough to, alone, be a keto food. But it'll help keep your keto meals lower calorie! Just add some butter and sausage and you're set! ;)

1361550680.0	190zxj	A word regarding the macros, and fat intake. (x-post from r/keto.) 	destructsean	19	5	18	"I've noticed a lot of talk on here (and instagram, and myfitnesspal) recently regarding ""upping your fat intake"" and making sure to ""hit those fat macros.""

Now, I implore any and all keto experts to correct me if I'm mistaken, or misleading in any of these comments, as the last thing I would want to do is give someone the wrong information.

That being said..

I worry that people are arbitrarily consuming pure fat foods in order to reach the macros and number of grams of fats provided for them from things like the keto calculator.

The way I look at it, if you're eating a set number of calories per day, then by all means, utilize the macros and make sure that you aren't overdoing it when it comes to carb and protein intake.

But, I feel that people are far, far too misguided when it comes to the macros. If you WANT to maintain a caloric goal, and eat that much daily, then by all means, take a few shots of fat and hit your caloric goal. If you aren't hungry, and can cut the calories, do that. The macros are only there people who are eating a consistent amount of calories daily, and serve as a guide.

You want to 1.) eat as little carbs as possible, preferably under 20g of net carbs day, and 2.) eat enough protein to prevent muscle wasting (which is .8g per pound of lean body mass, at the least. If you want to build muscle, this number goes up, obviously.)

The rest of your calories for the day should come from fat. But you don't HAVE to eat all that fat to make sure you're hitting a macro, or your calorie limit. You just CAN. If you eat less fat, that's how you make caloric deficits, and your body will then use it's own fat stores as energy, hence the fat loss the keto diet provides.

Don't arbitrarily take in fat just to ""hit a macro."" Do it if you're hungry. If you're not, enjoy the caloric deficit you just made, and be one step closer to your goal.

Not trying to sound preachy, or step on toes, I'd just hate to see someone who, at the end of the day sees a caloric deficit from what they planned on eating, and seeing a lower number of fat grams from what they thought they were going to take in, down a tablespoon of coconut oil or cream just because they think they should. That's unnecessary calories if you're not hungry!

Again, correct me if I'm wrong in all of this, but judging from what I've read I don't think I am.

Keto on!

My experiment: I have a large garden, and this year I will add some heirloom wheat to the mix. I plan to grow some wheat, harvest it, and make flour. By the time harvest rolls around, I should be at my goal weight, so I will make some bread from this wheat and track what happens to my blood sugar, ketones, etc. I have no idea what will happen, but at the very least, it will be fun to learn how to do all of this from seed to harvest!

I visited my doctor recently, and he explained to me that ketosis isn't really the culprit for the weight loss, it's the lack of caloric intake. I eat two meals a day usually, both high in fat. He explained it like this; Fat content = hunger suppression. No carbs to speak of + hunger suppression + one meal cut out = caloric deficit.

Regardless, it obviously works. I've made it a personal goal of mine to do strict keto without any exercise at all just to see what would happen. Well, I got skinny is what happened.

1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
 3/4 of an onion chopped
3/4 stalk of celery chopped
2 garlic cloves finely chopped
1 tbsp butter
1 tsp salt
1.3 lbs ground beef (I used Kirkland Organic)
1 large egg
1/4 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
2 strips thick bacon
1/4 cup tomato sauce from can
1 tbsp Frank’s Hot Sauce

Heat oven to 375 with rack in the middle
Combine crushed pork rinds &amp; heavy cream in a bowl and set aside
Saute onion, celery &amp; garlic in 1 tbsp butter until tender (8-10 mins)
Combine beef, tomato sauce, egg, Frank’s Hot Sauce, paprika, black pepper &amp; salt
Add celery/onion/garlic mixture and pork rinds/heavy cream mixture to beef mixture
Combine ingredients evenly, form it into a loaf and transfer it to a loaf pan
Cut 2 strips of bacon in half and place them crosswise over the loaf
Bake for until mixture reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 40-45 mins) **

  ** Personally I worry about undercooking the meat whenever I make meatloaf so I back until it appears to be cooked through the center when I cut into it.  This takes closer to 1 hour.  I still broil it for 3 minutes to make that bacon more crispy on top too.**

If bacon on top isn’t crispy reset the oven to broil &amp; broil the meatloaf 4-5 inches from the heat until the bacon is crisp &amp; browned (2-3 mins)

Let the meatloaf rest for 10 mins before transferring it to a platter, cut it lengthwise down the center and between each piece of bacon to create appropriate serving sizes.

I know its all water weight, but my body feels a lot better without it, and its always good for motivation. Although this afternoon, I started getting what I think are some symptoms of the keto flu, so I'm loading up on electrolytes today. 

I have a two-fold question though. I'm on a tight budget, and I don't get a lot of cravings, so its very easy for me to eat the same simple menu everyday. Eggs and bacon for breakfast, tuna or other protein with arugula or spinach and some cheese for lunch and snack, and a chicken thigh with skin and green beans with mushrooms for dinner. Its a very filling meal plan, so I have no need for anything else. However, is it ok to be way below my daily carb macro? At most I'm eating 10grams of carbs a day. I'm also getting a bit too much fat and not enough protein, so does anyone have any suggestions for high-protein snacks that don't have much fat to them? Or is it ok to leave the protein amount a bit below the macro level if you're getting plenty of fat in your diet? For next week, I'm planning on getting chicken breasts with no skin, as opposed to the chicken thighs, so that will fix some of the fat levels. But I was curious about the carb and protein levels.

talking to my wife about bacon and heard that she cooks it in a cold pan as well... I was flabbergasted!!! She always complains how she can never cook the bacon as well as I can. (I thought she was just lying apache didn't have to make herself bacon anymore)

Apparently it says on the back to cook that way - - again, flabbergasted.

So here's how I cook my bacon: 

-Take cast iron skillet put on medium high heat until handle is hot or bacon sizzles as soon as you touch the pan.

- Lay bacon flat 4 at a time or however many will fit with out crowding. (Never lay them on top of each other).

- wait until bacon starts to shrivel up, take tongs and stretch back out. 

- edges will start to turn golden brown. 

- flip!

- Exact same process on this side. (Bacon will have decreased on size; by how much depends on quality and brand).

- once golden brown flip again and let sit for about 10 seconds to crisp. 

- remove from skillet and place on paper towel. This will take some of the grease from bacon to prevent any sogginess.

This creates the PERFECT brown, straight crispy bacon with picture perfect wrinkles on the side.

http://i.imgur.com/0CfynvQ.jpg

One January 7th my husband and I decided that Keto seemed really doable for us. In the past we had tried Herbalife shakes (lost tons of weight and immediately gained it back... plus, those things are nasty), regular calorie counting, cutting all red meats, you name it, we tried it.
This new lifestyle is incredible. We both have more energy, my husband says his back feels better every day (chronic back injury), and I am NEVER hungry! We've both also tried so many new foods that we now love... I'm looking at you Sugar snap peas and Brussels Sprouts!

As of this morning, I am 192lb down from 210lb one month ago, and my husband is down to 283lb from 303lb. I haven't been this thin in over two years and my husband hasn't seen this weight since 2007ish. We;ve never been happier with ourselves and cannot weight (get it, haha) to see what's to come!!!

1358535030.0	16twv2	What is everyone's favorite keto Superbowl / sporting event snacks?	Jubes2681	14	3	13	"I know the big game isn't for a while, but I didn't think it would hurt to get this thread going, especially with the AFC and NFC championship games this weekend which are also good games to watch with friends. Plus, I'm curious to see what ketoers from around the world snack on when they watch big sporting events with friends and family.

So, what do people make for these types of events??


For me, I like making buffalo wings and buffalo dip.


Buffalo Wings


I don't do anything super fancy. I will either deep fry wing pieces or I'll bake them before tossing in buffalo sauce. 


Deep fry method:


* Heat oil and fry wing pieces for 3 mins/batch
* Immediately toss in buffalo sauce in a large bowl, using tongs to make sure wings are coated
* Serve with blue cheese dressing


Baked method:


* Preheat oven to 375
* Line baking sheet with tin foil and place a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet; spray the cooling rack with non-stick spray
* Place wings on cooling rack and bake for 1 hour or until crispy - I usually turn them over half way, but it's not necessary
* Immediately toss in buffalo sauce in a large bowl, using tongs to make sure wings are coated
* Serve with blue cheese dressing


Buffalo Dip


* Buy a roasted chicken and debone that beast and cut up the meat.
* 1 package soften cream cheese
* 1-2 cups blue cheese crumbles
* Buffalo sauce of your choice 

Mix it all together. You can cook this in a crock pot on high for 1-2 hours and it's divine. It can also be baked - I've done 350 for 45-60 minutes and then checked to see if the cheese has all melted. It's good for crowds because non-keto friends can use chips, etc., to dip, and ketoers can use veggies to dip (or just eat it with a spoon like I do because it's so tasty).

I cannot say enough good things about keto, I've lost 60-70 pounds, my asthma and allergies have not given me any trouble and generally feel healthier.

Now I've reached around 210-215 pounds and have been at this weight for close to 6 months I reckon. I am 6'3 so a weight of between 190 and 200 has been my goal.

Over the past 6 months I have become very lax at keto, I got very complacent with my weight and food choice and although it didn't go up I have not lost weight.  I don't think I have been in ketosis in a few months and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to get myself back into it.  A combination of an increasingly active lifestyle and fighting depression has made me crave carbs and when I am at a low point I am a weak weak man.

As the days go by I know it'll be harder and harder for me to go into ketosis but I am dreading the cold turkey carb withdrawal symptoms.

I don't exactly know what I am asking the community, I know I don't need to be told of the benefits of a keto diet, I know a slap on the back to get back on it wont work, has anyone else been in a similar situation while doing keto?

By cheat the guest meant carbing up with pasta dish or something; she also suggested 'clean' cheating where you indulge in non-gluten or sugar foods that are sweet, I assume with stevia or aspartame.

So, basically I have a few questions.

Lets start off with my lunch, I have papa murphy's taco pizza, if I scrape the toppings and don't eat the crust, am I in the clear?

Do I need to count calories or just eat? I've seen some count and some don't, but does it really matter? I have always done calories in vs calories out. 

I was on the calories in/out diet and lost 60lbs, but gained about 25lbs back because I can't seem to get the hold of things here recently and stop binge eating.

So, lets say I have 2 eggs, and a few pieces of bacon for breakfast. Then, a lettuce wrap for lunch with deli meat and cheese and some mayo. Then for dinner I have hamburger helper (cheeseburger mac.) but don't eat the noodles, am I good? I know there is sugar in the tomatoes/sauce, but when cooking for a family and I'm on food stamps (very limited budget) how do I afford to buy/cook separate meals?

I'm male, 27, 5'10"", ~186 lbs. and my problem is that I love sugars. However, watching the scale tip north of 200 bothered me and I set out to correct it. This isn't a story of how I reworked my life, this is how I'm solving a problem.

Doing a 180 with my habits was a no-go from day 1. I'm a programmer by day, and therefor by night. I spend the majority of my day sitting. I loathe running and gyms, but not sports, hiking, physical labor. I love beer and pizza, especially in the company of friends. I eat out 60-80% of the time. I wanted a solution to my weight that involved the least time investment, and sacrificed as little of my favorite habits. Most importantly, the solution would be permanent. This isn't a problem I ever want to tackle again.

Keto isn't new to me, I've messed around with it before. Previously it was more an insatiable curiosity into how it functioned and how little my common sense could explain of it. This time around, though, it would have to come with some caveats. But before I dig into those, let me get some evidence on the table:

(Sorry, no pictures. Didn't take them at the beginning, so wouldn't matter if I took them now)

[The Numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq99GUs6aPr9dGxablZZalY1OWxEdnN5LVh4XzdaRXc&amp;output=html) 

That's not a very straight line, nor is it nearly as steep as the common results. That's probably because every date in red involved carbs. A lot of them. And every day except for one of those was a Friday/Satuday. Needless to say most of that is from beer, bars, pizza, or whatever food the gang was eating. I didn't want a diet to interfere with that, so I didn't let it. Cyclical/Targeted doesn't factor into it. This isn't cheating, this is my diet.

During the week I eat out for lunch everyday. Everyday. Its not the cheapest, but I need to get up to go somewhere rather than stare at a computer screen. See the sun. Walk. etc. There is not a single restaurant, fast food or otherwise, that won't bend over backwards to help out. People have such ridiculous custom orders nowadays, and blow up over the tiniest inconvenience, that asking for a burrito sans tortilla really does not bother them.

After the first two weeks, every date in black on that chart involved at least 1 bottle of diet soda. I know it doesn't work for many, and I'm not arguing one way or the other. I used the first two weeks as a baseline so I could gauge whether artificial sweeteners were being disruptive. They don't phase me, so I abuse it.

Every weekday I walk for 30 minutes. No matter what happened during the day, how active or sedentary I am: 30 minutes. Not a lot really, especially because you can do all sorts of multitasking while walking. Hold a phone call, read, fire off emails, text, listen to music, etc. A smartphone may be required. Mostly, I just need to guarantee I've actually circulated some blood during the day.

Overall I try to keep below 15g net carbs in a normal day. I only track macros and calories if I don't like the progress I'm making. Other than that, I eyeball all of it. When I don't know, I research recipes and ingredients so I can make a relatively strong judgement call about a particular food on the fly. Sometimes this bites me, but I learn from it so it doesn't recur.

So what's the point of all of this? I don't find a lot of people treat keto the way I do. I'm not trying to preach my habits, but I know that as someone who had to design their keto experience from scratch, this kind of testimonial is hard to find. Examples are hard to find. There's a large wealth of cyclical/targeted data out there, but it almost exclusively focuses on gains, and I've unfortunately focused on losses. I enjoy reading the success of others, but I find that most people are very strict with their diet. I knew ahead of time that I wouldn't be, and that made finding examples a lot more rare.

So for anyone out there that relates with past-me, and wants to know the same things I would have:

* You get what you put in. My pattern is strict, and its important it stays that way. If you're prone to falling off the horse, don't go anywhere near the idea.

* If you're creative, any restaurant will suffice. Don't be afraid to ask (just don't get trapped explaining the diet... again).

* Weighing everyday is probably just as uplifting/deflating as doing it occasionally. If you're going to weigh everyday, do it in the morning, naked, and you still won't get a straight line.

* No matter public opinion, if it isn't hurting you, you can keep doing it. Easy enough with the public, they generally still agree with the food pyramid. Harder with ketoers, you guys can be downright nasty about diet sodas and 'cheating'.

* If your 'cheating' is rigid and planned, its not cheating, its your diet. Your diet is no longer strictly keto, but it is not an accident.

* If you do cheat, its your fault.

* Learn. The more you know, the easier it gets. If you don't know, research. Knowledge is power, here.

* Luck doesn't factor into it.

My situation: Both my wife and I are on keto and both of us are successful. Difference between the two of us is that I love to share my progress and statuses with people. I'm an introvert in RL, but online I'm very much an extrovert.

She's an introvert in both respects but has concerns that I'm getting ""Obsessed"" with this. I don't think I am and have countered that I'm excited because it's the first time that I've been able to actually control my food intake and weight successfully. 

In regards to the obsession point; this, in my mind, has taken on more of a passionate hobby since it's replaced nearly all of my video gaming time (I haven't sat down and played in over a week when I used to play every 2-3 days for an hour or so). It's just more interesting to me.

There is an article I remember reading when I was first starting keto, about how previously done research wasnt based on good studies but is quoted over and over again. It was about how low carb diets don't work but it was from a fat camp type setting in the 40s. My memory is a bit fuzzy so sorry if this seems like rambling.

So, I've been on keto for about two months now. I'm a 5'0.5"", 20 year old female, and my weight usually fluctuates between 145 and 150. I normally drink about 36 to 48 ounces of water a day. (However, I never drink pure water. I drink carbonated water with stevia drops in it, or I brew my own Tazo's Iced Passion Tea, and add lemonade to it made with water, lemon juice, and stevia.)

I naturally have very large lips. I've always struggled with chapped lips, but ever since I started keto, it has been THE WORST.

I don't think it's dehydration because I'm not thirsty, nor is my mouth dry.

It could be the weather, since it's winter, but temperatures usually range from the high 20s to the mid 50s with not a lot of wind.

I recently haven't taken my supplements, (bad, I know), and I've heard that vitamin deficiencies can be the culprit. But it just doesn't seem likely.

Tonight, my lips were red and burning, so I put some coconut oil on them. It helped A LOT, and I'm thinking of making my own lip balm with coconut oil, olive oil, and shea butter. (I'm allergic to most traditional chapsticks.)

Does anyone have experience with chronically dry lips, or know any remedies? Could it be possible that I'm not drinking enough water?

After years and years of attempting to count calories, diet, exercise, you name it, I sit here at my heaviest and unhappiest to date. I've been doing a ton of reading and research on this subreddit (and the interwebz in general), and I thought I would begin my journey by committing to it with a post.

I've been overweight since getting my first desk job after high school (about 2004). Right now I'm tipping the scales at 233lbs (I'm a 6' female). My goal is to get down around 170 (this was my weight at the end of high school, and also as skinny as I'd like to be given my height). I'm getting married on NYE this year, and I want to look and feel great for my day!

I'm sick of feeling so unhealthy. I'm sick of feeling tired all the time, of never feeling satisfied. I'm sick of the terrible back pain I feel every day from my degenerative disc disease, and I'm sick of doctors poking and prodding and not helping. I'm 28 years old and it physically hurts me to bend and tie my shoes - I am not okay with accepting this as my life any longer.

I truly believe Keto will be the solution I need. I know it will be hard, but I need a true lifestyle change. I want to set an example for my mother (who is also overweight and unhappy) and prove to her that it can be done. I want to keep up with my marathon-running fiance when we go for walks and hikes. I want to feel good about my body for the first time in...well....ever. I want to be proud of the choices I am making for my health and I want to instill these priorities in the children I hope to have in the coming years.

Tonight I go grocery shopping, armed with a Keto-focused grocery list, and the journey starts as soon as I wake up.

I hope I am okay to post this here, and thank you for reading if you've survived my wall of text. For those of you who have had success, please pass along any helpful tips for those first couple (and inevitably challenging) weeks. I'd love to hear your stories, your successes and failures, and really anything you'd like to share. And I also want to thank you all for inspiring me to take this step."	t5_2vztm	True

I started keto on January 6 after a lot of research, planning, and trying it for about a month back in the fall (lost about 10 lbs then, which I gained back over the holidays). I'm 26, female and started at 190, the heaviest I've ever been. In almost one month I'm down a total of 7 lbs, but my weight is fluctuating and stalling between 185-183 and has been doing this for the past 2 weeks.


I feel like I'm doing very well and being very strict with my diet (will post sample menu in the comments). I'm drinking more water than usual (probably not enough), not eating when I'm not hungry, and trying to eat a lot of fat but still make healthy choices. I have not intentionally started exercising yet, so right now I am just walking about 30 minutes a day with the dog. 


Things I think I can do better: drink more water, start exercising (ugh), eat a smaller dinner portion, eat more fat.  Otherwise, I need your help to critique my diet (see comments).


I really appreciate any advice you guys have! I'm so excited for all of you and your progress, and really hope to join you guys soon :)


*Edit: Thanks everyone for your suggestions! I'm going to cut out drinking for a while and see if that makes a difference. You guys are great! :)

2 (EDIT: SUGAR FREE) Bread and Butter Pickle Spears, chopped like relish

2 Tbl Gould's Mustard

2 Tbl Miracle Whip (EDIT: OR MAYO FOR NO CARBS [otherwise, there's 4g])

2 Tbl finely crumbled Bacon (I used the kind you can buy pre-crumbled)

2 Tsp Liquid Hickory smoke (optional, but I like it)

Directions:

1. Place all the ingredients in a bowl

2. Measure 1 Tbl of the Fake Big Boy's Seasoning and place into bowl

3. Add eggs and mix/mash it all together

4. Enjoy!

Variation: Remove the yolks from the eggs and mix with the other ingredients first; cut up the white and then mix in the yolk/ingredients mixture.

NOTE: you are welcome to play with the quantities of ingredients - I submit this recipe as an idea I had of these ingredients: the smoky flavor of bacon and hickory smoke, the mild bite of the jalapeno with the sweetness of the Bread and Butter Pickle... "	t5_2vztm	True

what is full fat cheese?

I have been on a keto diet on and off for about 3 months now. I started at a peak weight of 297 and am currently 259, on my way to 230. I may keep going at that point, but at 6'2"" and a fairly wide build 230 lbs is what I weighed in HS and would be just fine for me. I didn't do a ton of research when starting. I just went and bought a bottle of multivitamins and started eating like a carnivore. After a few weeks of glorious meat I branched out into veggies quite a lot when food boredom started to set in. Then someone mentioned cocanut oil and almonds (not together) and now I even have a few good snacks and desserts to eat. Its been a great experience. And I am still losing weight at a clip of about 1/2lb a day on average.



Here is the question : I have been reading a lot of posts asking about calorie counting. Calorie counting?? Thats been the hallmark of the keto diet, at least for me. No calorie counting. I eat a PILE of bacon and sausage for breakfast. I eat a tuna salad that is a cup and a half of celery a can of tuna and probably 1/3 cup of mayo. And then I have a steak for dinner. All of that not including the almond/chocolate snacks I have now and then. So how is this working for me and I see posts about it not working for others and they are told to count calories? Calories in vs calories out determines success was in one of the responses I read. I am not eating as much as before, so I suppose it makes sense that I'm losing, but I am taking in a silly number of calories...so what is the difference between keto and something like weight watchers. How is is that this ""works better"" if it is simply a matter of a calorie defecit leading to the weight loss?"	t5_2vztm	True

I've heard it said in the past that it's not always a case of just multiplying the ingredients, like make 10 times the batch or whatever...  Can anyone give me advice on how to convert this recipe to make a larger amount?

From the site:

* 3 Tablespoons Almond meal (heaped-ish. They weren't *overly* heaped, but not level either)
* Half a beaten egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 3 teaspoons stevia
* 3 tablespoons milk
* 1.5 tablespoons oil
* 2 teaspoons cocoa

Mix together in a mug. The batter should be slightly on the runny side, (almond meal will make it dense and rubbery otherwise) so don't stress.

Cook on high for 3 minutes.

I can take you back to my youth growing up a fat kid, but that is another post.  It's January 28, 2013; doing some internetting, I stumble upon r/keto and start reading.  2 hours later, I say 'screw it, why not'.  

Rewind back to July of 2012 (about 8 months ago).  I weighed 210 pounds, and stood a towering 5'8"".  I was gym savvy and knew how to diet (restrict calories, eat more fiber, lean meats, etc).  3 months later, I was down to 185.  Religious calorie counting, running, lifting, doing the right thing.  About October, it started getting cold, I didn't feel like going to the gym, I'm crapped out, and wanted to eat real food.  And boy did I.  We move back to January 28, 2013 and this is where the problem arises.

I was fat again.  My issue is I don't like weighing myself . . . something about the ugly truth of a scale.  I knew I was fat, I looked it, and my clothes were tight.  The clothes I bought when I was 185 didn't fit.  It sucked.  So I start Keto, not knowing my start weight, and now it's 3 weeks+ later.  I've lost 2 inches around my waist, I can button the top collar of my dress shirts, and there is a hop in my step.  The miracles of Keto are true.  

Last night, I say screw it, I feel good, I'm gonna hop on the scale.  I jump on thinking to see 185ish . . . I see 195.  I am dissapointed.  I know Keto works, my clothes are fitting again, but for some reason I expected it to be lower.  I 'feel' like I lost 15 pounds . . . did that mean I started at 210 again?  So as a PSA, even though it may bruise your ego, or downright punch it in the face (as in my case), weigh before you start so you can baseline.  

I am continuing as I enjoy the Keto lifestyle and types of food I can eat and quite frankly, it's not difficult for me.  Though Asian, I do not like rice, and I have given up bread before so it wasn't too big a deal.  I have a before pic and when I get down to 165, I will post the before and after.  "	t5_2vztm	True

I started keto as my NYR in January, and I've stuck with it since then- no mean feat for a Filipino guy brought up on rice. 

I've learned to use MFP (though I really suck at tracking), dealt with the KFlu, and seen the great reddit keto schism, of which I chose this sub as my primary ever since I saw a mod kick a person on chat for the unholy sin of disagreeing with him.

....but I digress. 

After seeing gradual, downward trends, I stepped on the scale this past week and behold, **I was at 250 from 270. 20 lbs in a bit less than 2 months of casual keto?** Damn! 

And I felt great! High energy, no sugar crashes and I wasn't that hungry at all! I was especially glad that I was dropping weight while being sedentary as I'm currently trying to write my Master's Thesis. 

The NSV came ater in the day, as I was getting ready for bed. My lovely girlfriend took one look at me, and goes *""You know, I can really see the weight loss! &lt;3""*

BAM! Million bucks right there! This was working, this is good. Screw everyone else who said this diet was unsustainable, I'll show them!

Then comes the Roadblock. A Roadblock known as a Chocolate Fountain. 

This Friday was my girlfriend's birthday, so on saturday a bunch of us got together and borrowed a chocolate fountain, since my GF is an admitted chocoholic. Complete with fruit, marshmallows, etc etc. It was as far from keto-friendly as Timbuktu is to the moon. 

I'm sorry to say, but my defenses crumbled like chocolate cake in a room of fat kids. I attacked along with my friends, and I could feel the sugar in me like a drug. 

And as the final nail in the coffin, we drunkenly decide to have a 3am Denny's smorgasbord! Yeah, I did opt to have the Philly omelet with corned beef hash on the side (that's keto....kinda?) but I think I'm confident that I broke my calorie limits for the day, and then some.

This morning, hop on the scale, and I'm back at 260. What. :O

It was worth it though! Made my GF happy with chocolate, found out that I didn't really miss sugar all that much, and now I'm back on the keto-wagon, and back in the fight.

&gt;Moral of the Story: If you're going to pig out, make it for something that's worth it.

&gt;2nd Moral of the Story: Stay the f*ck away from fountains of chocolate.

TL;DR- I got lighter, I got thinner, then I drowned in chocolate and Denny's.   "	t5_2vztm	True

Hidden carbs are everywhere [x-post from /r/keto]	bigwhitedude	5	0	1	"When making your own recipes, eating more than a serving of something, and overall just trusting the user submitted information on MFP; be wary of if it's user submitted.

There are a lot of low-cal dieters on that site that are very incomplete in the foods that they enter themselves.

Also, I'll use heavy whipping cream as an example. If you're trusting the fact that it says ""0 carbs"" on the label and you go hog wild on it; you should be wary. 

Heavy whipping cream contains .42 net carbs / tbsp [according to the USDA Nutrient Database](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/52). This is my goto source when filling out my MFP intakes. I have a TON of my own foods built because I don't trust labels.

Since this is a diet filled with whole food eaters you should take extra care to not trust labels. Label rules state that if the nutrient in question has less than .5 g/mg of something then it doesn't need to say it has any on the label.

1358045799.0	16gzj8	Keto friendly pizza?  Yes please!	daringescape	11	6	1	"I'm sure something similar has been done before, but here goes:


* 1 cup flax meal
* 3 tbsp melted butter
* 3 tbsp cream cheese (softened in microwave)
* 1 tbsp parmesan cheese
* 1 egg
* couple of pinches of salt
* some garlic powder
* some italian seasoning

Mix ingredients well, form into ball, roll out onto pizza stone (mine was about 1/4 inch thick) and bake at 400 for 10-15 min. (crust will be slightly crispy on edges) use your judgement.


Pull crust, and put on some sauce of your choosing (I used 1/4 cup of marinara at 4 grams of carbs)  8 oz of mozzarella cheese, and some pepperoni.


Bake another 10 or so minutes or until it looks the way you like it.  I cut mine into 6 slices.  You may want to experiment a bit, as my crust was crispier on the edges than I like, but still delicious.

I've read up on keto, and I know it works but I'm getting told that it's still a calorie deficit issue.  I want more info because: .....

For a matter of 3 months I went on a low fat diet. I was 300 lbs. I ate 1100 calories a day, and was walking a mile a day. I had a high protein, low fat diet (lots of turkey etc, lean breads etc). I was hungry non stop, BUT I stuck with it for 3 months, no cheating. I ended up at 305 lbs.
The next summer I was at 310. I went on what I thought was Atkins (I stayed in induction, etc aka I did keto without knowing I was doing keto). Over that three month period I probably ate between 1200 and 1800 calories a day, and walked about the same (just to class and back from my apartment). At the end of that period I was 240 lbs.

One diet where I consumed less calories and probably expended more working out, I gained 5 lbs (and it wasn't oh hey muscle definition, I looked fatter too). If someone else told me this story I would assume they are lying and cheated on the diet, but I didn't.
The other diet I lost 70 lbs in 3 months, and looked a TON better for the first time in my life. I ended up gaining most of it back after a year of eating junk food non stop since I moved back into dorms, but that's not the point.
How did keto make me lose the weight when I was consuming more calories? My thyroid gland does not work, if that matters at all. I was born with a non working one and have taken synthetic thyroid since I was born. When I was young I was tiny and hyperactive, and then in second grade my father decided drugs were more important than me taking my medicine so I went an entire year without it and tripled in weight. Since then only keto has ever helped me lose weight, nothing else. I played basketball in high school where we ran 3-4 miles a day, lifted weights etc ... never could slim down."	t5_2vztm	True

I'm now three weeks into keto, down 15 lbs, and my doc is totally on board and way excited for me! He was so happy that I came in to get my numbers checked, and was beaming when he told me how cool it was going to be to check them again at 6 and 12 months, ""to see how much they were going to improve, because they *are* going to improve so much"". His only point of concern was that keto is hard to stick to, and he acknowledged that a lot of people have to back off to a more generous ""low-carb"" diet, rather than keto, but I told him about all of the resources I've found, including you lovelies, and the lovelies at /r/keto, /r/xxketo, and /r/ketorecipes, and all of the carb alternatives I've been researching (things like coconut flour, almond flour, flax meal... which were new to him), and that I thought I'd be ok to stick with it. It is challenging, but it has been an entire lifestyle change which has actually made it an adventure. I never cooked before, so I'm learning how to cook while learning how to keto and it's all coming up millhouse.

We didn't discuss staying keto *after* I hit my goal weight, but, to be honest, I don't know if I'll stay keto or go paleo or what, I just know I'll never go back to putting all those sugary carbs in my diabetes-predisposed body and thinking it won't bite me in the ass someday.

Dinner: 4 meatballs, 2tbsp of spaghetti sauce and a gram of mozz. cheese

Any advice? If it matters, I have about 85 pounds to lose. Any help would be much appreciated! 

edit: To be clear, I didn't mean I'm not getting the numbers I'm looking for on the scale. In 3 days I've lost 2.8 pounds and am totally fine with that. I just meant my food info isn't matching up with what I was told to shoot for. Also, looking over my food I've realized I have no veggies in there today other than the little bit that was in my lunch meal. I was going to eat steamed broccoli &amp; cauliflower with my dinner but I'm way over on my calories already."	t5_2vztm	True

1361647332.0	193b5h	Xpost: Keto/Booze theory	MisterChauncyButtons	7	2	5	"*I've been thinking about this lately, and can't seem to find a flaw in my logic. So I'm throwing it out to my fellow ketards to find the flaw, if there is one.*

**Assumption #1:** A person is in full ketosis

**Assumption #2:** The body does not store alcohol, only prioritizes it over all other forms of fuel while it is present in the body.

Lets say I knew ahead of time I was going out on the town on a particular night. I planned accordingly by doing the following:

I ate my calories (say 1600) before noonish for the day to give my body ample time to process the fuel. Then started boozing it up (say 800 cals worth) that evening around 8 pm (hard alcohol, no beer).

Since my body had already processed my usable calories earlier, and will now only burn up the alcohol (knowing I stop burning fat stores during this time). Shouldn't I be able to consume my daily 1600 cals + the 800 cals with no ill effects? Since the booze calories will not be converted to fat?

**Chicken Mushroom Alfredo:** http://i.imgur.com/tc28H.jpg

**Ingredients:**

* 1 bag of shirataki noodles: http://www.nasoya.com/products/shirataki/shirataki_spaghetti.html
* 1/4 garlic alfredo sauce
* 1 frozen chicken breast
* 3oz-ish of baby bella mushrooms
* 1 tbsp coconut oil for frying the chicken
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 oz of shredded parmesan cheese

**Directions:**  
I started by using a smaller frying pan to get the chicken cooking in coconut oil. Then I rinsed the the shirataki noodles with hot water in a strainer to get rid of as much as possible of the nasty fish-smelling liquid they come in. I then placed them in another skillet separate from the one cooking the chicken in order to dry roast them. I just sort of guessed how long, but it was probably about 3-5 minutes, stirring and spreading them a few times.

As the chicken cooked, I cut it into strips, added in mushrooms and the alfredo sauce, and let saute for a bit. I also added salt, onion powder and pepper.  

Then I added the butter to the dry roasting noodles, stirred it around a bit. Then I dumped the chicken frying pan into the noodle frying pan, sprinkled the parmesan on top, and covered for about 4 minutes.  

Finally, I devoured it, and it was amazing. And I'm feeling nice and full.

I intend to keep going after that, but I'm not sure of an actual number, I'll likely aim for 5 or 10 pound increments until I hit something I'm really happy with.

Mid January I went and got some bloodwork done.

Results were as follows: Blood Sugar: 5.6 (metric) Cholesterol 5.09 Triglycerides 0.61 HDL 1.17 LDL (calculated) 3.64 Total Cholesterol 4.4

I haven't had a chance to read up on the results to see whether these are decent, the only one I know is the blood sugar one, as Diabetes runs in the family.

I'm interested in trying the keto diet but I'm not sure if it will work with my religious choices.  I'm Jewish and while I don't keep strictly kosher, I do keep several rules that I think may interfere with a keto diet.

1. No pork or other non-kosher meats - this means no bacon, no sausage, mostly just beef/veal, poultry, and lamb.  Also only certain cuts of meat.
2. No milk/meat - religious laws say several hours needed between eating milk and meat, but I usually just avoid eating them in the same meal.  More comfortable with poultry and dairy together than with beef and dairy together.  These both seem to be pretty big parts of keto and I feel like not eating them together would make life difficult on keto
3. Minor - religious obligation to eat certain breads (challah on Shabbat, matzo on Passover, etc.) - For certain holidays I'm obligated to eat certain foods, but I assume this would work as a cheat day at the worst.

The problem was however, that peanut butter is still a quite rare sight in our stores and when there is some, there's usually added sugar, which ofc is a no no. So when I today came across a small jar with just peanuts (organic even!) and some himalayan salt, I bought it immediately.

I didn't really have anything to add it to, but because people have just eaten a spoon or two of the stuff, I thought that's good enough for me to taste it.

%&amp;¤#! The stuff is stuck everywhere inside my mouth. Probably the hardest thing to eat ever.

Surprisingly it tasted like peanuts.

I was very nervous about this trip and maintaining Keto, so I thought if I can get something that I can eat, it will be easier to avoid the chips and cookies and brownies and... you get the idea. So I ordered these cookies from Amazon. I tasted one last night and I am... skeptical. How is this possibly keto friendly? No net carbs? But it tastes like a cookie! The texture is different, but the taste is not at all shabby. Highly recommend!	t5_2vztm	True

1368539932.0	1ebb7q	Any help appreciated!	neatospiderplant	3	3	8	"I've been doing keto for 2 weeks today watching my (lack of) progress. It's not working. I'm not so much upset about it as I am motivated to find out what I'm doing wrong so I can change it. 

I'm not sure what's relevant so here's my story:

Last fall, I started low-carbing. Went from 209 lbs to 189 and stalled in November. In January, I lost my job. Adjusting to new routine, I didn't make diet a priority. I didn't watch what I ate at all. I stopped using MFP, but kept weighing. Oddly enough, I maintained weight. It fluctuated between 187-191 with no effort.

By April, I had learned about Keto and was going to try it after my birthday. My birthday weekend was FULL of carbs. As a result, I started Keto at 192 on April 30. Since then, the scale has been no different from my usual. I still fluctuate between my usual 187-191


Additional info:

- Pretty sure I'm in ketosis. I haven't used ketosticks since my understanding is that they aren't always reliable. I figure what's the point in spending money when it's not going to give me results I can rely on anyway. BUT I do have an acetone like taste in my mouth.

- I'm not very active. for actual ""exercise"", I walk my dogs and use my backyard trampoline everyday the weather permits. I'm trying to work on this and find ways to get more active, but I'm not really sporty or anything so my ability/enthusiasm about joining a sports team or gym is pretty low. 

- I'm not much of a water drinker. But figuring this might be part of the problem, in the past few days, I've taken measures to ensure I'm drinking more. I'm aiming for 4L a day. 

- I'm trying to really limit the artificial sweeteners. I think I've only had them 2 or 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  

- I'm 31 years old, female. No firm goal weight.

1362345619.0	19lgxb	(X-post) keto pancake / waffle recipe	DookieDaveUK	1	1	0	"Hi all,

Have been experimenting a bit with cream cheese recently, and off of the back of a baked cheesecake recipe (2 tubs cream cheese 500g approx, 2 eggs, 1/4 cup sweetener. Bake at 175 for 20 mins), today we tried this recipe for keto pancakes. 


1.5 scoops of vanilla protein powder
2 eggs
1/4 cup vanilla da Vinci syrup
150g of cream cheese (half a pack)
1/4 cup soya milk
Optional cinnamon to taste

Mix well until very smooth, I used a hand mixer

Fry a ladle full at a time in a pan, in oil until crispy. Don't make them too large as they are quite delicate. Try not to overcrowd the pan, as it will stop them getting crispy, and the oil foams up if it can't cope. 

Serve as you like, we had bacon and SF keto syrup


They were very light compared to our previous experiments with protein pancakes, possible a little too delicate on the flipping, so maybe needs 2 scoops of protein powder, but we try to avoid adding too much as they can easily become quite 'cakey'. 

A recipe in progress, but definitely better than our previous attempts.

In Ketosis, my gums stand strong, even to the smoke, and the taste goes away after a decent brushing.

There are literally thousands of interactions they could look at, yet haven't. 

Based on the majority of the opinions on the other sub and /r/theketodiet, it seems like there are two fundamental opinions:

- Hyped up people who will suck down artificially-sweetened sodas all day

- Many others who will graciously admit that fake sugar makes them crave real sugar. 

Additionally, metabolites like methanol can be produced from things like aspartame, and while I realize that alone, and in one sitting it's negligible, but it just seems like it's something I don't want to put in my body. 

***
I'm fat because I was undisciplined. I lost weight and gained it all back many different times because I relied on crap like artificial sweeteners to get my sugar fix, only to really want the real thing. 

Today, I'm at the precipice of ""obese"" and ""overweight"" which is awesome. I kicked fake sugars almost completely (hey, I'm still going to have a drink or two if I go out once a month), and I've NEVER been this successful at losing weight. I'm feeling better, sleeping better, and living healthier than I ever have in my life. 

I live better because I've introduced a great deal of discipline in my life.

I know others have expressed similar thoughts after kicking all things sweet-tasting. 

***
I just think something with such an...odd background like aspartame has something wrong with it (I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it seems to have been pushed to market via the hands of Rumsfeld and Reagan. I have no political agenda to push, but the hastiness of this added to the number of non-food scientist hands pushing it concerns me). 

And splenda is a chloronated sugar. Now, I'm not going to be dumb and say that anything chlorinated will kill you (NaCl - table salt is required to live, more or less), however, generally-speaking, halogenated molecules are things that are scary - hell - if we worked with ANYTHING halogenated in organic lab, we had a special waste bottle for it under a special hood. 

I'm most startled by this: People sucking down diet coke by 2-3 liters a day in lieu of water. That is vice replacement, and I can only think that this behavior isn't doing the ketoer any favors...

***

Can we have a real discussion about how artificial sugars have hindered our progress in the past, and how kicking them has helped us?
