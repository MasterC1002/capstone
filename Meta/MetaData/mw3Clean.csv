&gt;Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

* If an enemy player gets a Predator Missile, he will single you out. It doesn't matter if you're on your own. It doesn't matter if the rest of your team mates are huddled together on the other side of the map. The enemy player isn't interested in getting a triple kill or a multi kill. He's only interesting in getting **you**.
* A Predator Missile is in the air and you have Blind Eye equipped. Cool, right? Wrong. The enemy player will ignore the red squares and instead, opt for the greyed-out figure that he sees moving in the corner of his screen. That, or one of your team mates will try to escape the Predator Missile by sprinting towards you. 
* The second I decide to reload or check my back, somebody will come running around that corner with akimbo FMGs. It happens every single time and I never learn.
* If I throw down a care package, somebody will steal it from me, regardless of where I've placed it or how attentively I am guarding it. Call of Duty will always find a way to take it from me. Unless its a UAV. Then I can keep it.
* If I'm one kill away from winning a game of FFA and I happen to get killed, I will be spawned at the edge of the map, far away from everybody. My opponent, who is one kill behind me, will be spawned smack bang in the middle of things. Quickscopers and players using pistols-only will magically appear in front of his sight-lines.
* I'm watching a doorway because I'm 100% sure that somebody is inside and that he or she will come barging out at any moment.... I spend 10 seconds aiming down my sights, yet nobody appears. I start to doubt myself. Did I really see that red dot on my radar? Maybe he left via another exit? What if he intends to stay in there for the entire game? And what if somebody has crept up on me while I was too busy focusing on the doorway? My doubts get the better of me and I check my back. Nobody is there. Time to turn back around and focus my attention on the doorway agaiOH FUCK HE'S GOT A STRIKER
* Four enemy players have their backs to me. Either I'll panic, miss and run out of bullets before I kill the second guy or I'll be blown up by an exploding car as I try to get closer.
* I'm playing Infected and I'm holding down an area with my team mates. A lone infected player comes running around the corner and nobody seems to notice him. He breaks through the wall of SMG-wielding players that are surrounding me and focuses all of his efforts on infecting me with a 2-meter knife lunge.
* 2 kills away from a MOAB? Host Migration will fail.
* Your team mates are closer to the enemy? Doesn't matter. You'll be killed first anyway.
* An enemy chopper is in the air and you're trying to lock onto it with your Stinger. You'll spend 10 seconds waiting for it to reappear as it ducks behind tall buildings, only to be shot in the back as soon as you have a clear shot.
* Your attack chopper will fly around taking aerial photographs while you're on a killstreak. As soon as you die and your streak is over, it'll go into beast mode and take out everyone on the opposite team.
* You pick up a weapon that you don't normally use and beast with it. You equip it on one of your classes and you go 1-5 in the first minute.
* You decide to swap your claymore for some semtex. Half-way through the next game, you forget about the change and try to set down a claymore. You throw semtex at the floor and are forced to make a frantic dash to escape the blast.
* You decide to swap your semtex for a claymore. Half-way through the next game, you see a group of enemies. You decide to throw a semtex grenade at them, only to take out a claymore and get killed while you're still clutching it in your hands.
* You get into a close gunfight and you need to reload. Instead of wasting your time with the reload animation, you decide to switch to your secondary weapon. Unfortunately for you, you recently selected the Stinger as your secondary.
* You get a UAV and instinctively call it in. An enemy Counter UAV was already up.
* Patiently flank the enemy team. Your team mates spawn beside you.
* You run around the corner and your team mate is there, milliseconds away from capturing a decoy care package.
* Cooking a grenade? It'll bounce off the frame of the door and come right back at you."	t5_2rp9s	True

1321041851.0	m91m7	How not to suck at MW3 and increase your K/D ratio	cyrex	566	124	167	"**In celebration for #1 on r/MW3:   ~~EERL4KLY7Z  (it can be used twice)~~ I have 4 more codes if anyone wants to trade**

I went from .8 K/D to 1.5 in just 1 week back in MW2 following tips from Seananners on Youtube. The following is what I learned:

Kill death ratio is simply the number of kills divided by the number of deaths in a game. This number can change exponentially in both ways. When you get more kills, you earn more killstreaks enabling even more kills. When you get more deaths, you provide your opponents more kill streaks enabling them to get more kills. At MINIMUM aim to have a 1.0 K/D.  I believe this is achievable in public games by the most uncoordinated people as long as they are willing to work on it. 

Improving your ratio can happen in 2 ways. More kills and less deaths. First, I will give you a few exercises to do in order to increase your control of the game. This will help both sides of the equation. Next, I'll teach you how not to die needlessly, and finally you will get some great tips on how to get more kills. 


**Controller Sensitivity**

Ever see the enemy in your peripheral vision, spin to shoot them and die before your sights aren't even close? Me too :( I stopped this entirely by bumping up my controller sensitivity. It took only 2 games to go from playing at the default (2?) up to 8. This is how:
**Exercise #1**
If your sensitivity is &lt; 5 go into your options and set your controller sensitivity to 10. RIGHT NOW. Just do it. If you are used to a low sensitivity and go to 10,** it will suck**. You might even get a headache. **The goal is to train your thumbs/brain to use smaller movements. The goal is NOT to keep a high sensitvity.** Once you are able to make it through an entire game without the camera spinning every which way, and you get at least a few legitimate kills that required you to quickly aim, drop your sensitivity down to 7. This is where you will really master controlling your aim. **After playing like this for a few days, pick the setting you like best and stay there. Ultimately, you will want to use whatever is most comfortable, even if its a 2 or 3.** 


**Exercise #2**

Play the spec ops training course until you can get the 3 star rating with your sensativity level. For new or inexperience players, this is not easy. If you get into a slump, come back to this and practice up. Be efficient with ammo, aiming, movement, and timing. 


**Button Layout**

Go to your options and switch your button layout to Tactical. This will allow you to go prone in a moment's notice. It switched the prone and melee buttons. This also means it will be more difficult to recover from a missed knifing, but you really shouldn't be trying to knife someone if you have a chance to miss and you have bullets in your primary or secondary weapons. It takes a little getting used to, but it is well worth it in the end. 


**Theater Mode**

Go to your opens and turn theater mode off. Unless you actually want to use this feature, it only slows down your system. If you do want to use it, most likely you are good enough to be posting videos on the internet and already know this stuff ;p


When I finally sat down to analyze why I sucked so much at CoD, I found that I was dying to stupid stuff. I had no discipline. You see videos of great players on youtube running not stop getting kill after kill and it can be discouraging, but you must realize they are putting a LOT of techniques and great discipline to use that you do not see. They are able to do this because they know the maps and they are watching the mini map constantly. The first thing I worked on was preventing deaths dying in situations where my enemy saw me and killed me before I got a chance to acknowledge they were even there. 



**STOP SPRINTING**

More often than not, new players find themselves often dying because they were sprinting around a corner and although they saw the enemy first, they couldn't aim in time to shoot. When you are sprinting you cannot look down the sights as fast, so just stop. What is the hurry anyway? 
**Exercise 2** 
Play 5 games and NEVER sprint. Not once. If you sprint, start your counter over. Learn that it is OK to get someone slower. This will keep you alive. If your goal is to get to one side of the map to the other as fast as possible, keep in mind that dying because you were sprinting doesn't help your reach your goal. Slow and steady wins the race.


The second issue I worked on was preventing the deaths where I was simply in a bad position on the map. Ever notice, how there seems to be this one place on the map that is the hot spot. If you go there, you will probably die. **STOP GOING THERE** I don't know if we are just retarded or what, but I know I had a tough time with this. The middle of the map is so interesting! Guess what. You don't have to go there!.


**Stay on the edge of the map** 

If you stay on the edge of the map, you will always have at least 1 side you don't have to worry about the enemy coming from. In many cases, you can find cover for 1 or 2 more sides, and you really only have to worry about the enemy in 1 direction. You will learn maps faster this way too. If you stay only on the edges of the map, there are fewer perspectives to learn as far as where people might be positioned. The same goes for buildings. If you are inside a building **hug the wall** There is absolutely no reason to be out in the open, yet people do it all the time. If you are not touching a cover surface or the edge of the map, that should be your #1 goal. 


**Dying to killstreaks -- Don't do it** 

One thing that seems to be different in MW3, is that killstreaks don't seem to rule as much as they did in MW2. Maybe its because everyone still sucks, but it really seems more gun oriented. The threat is still there to multiple deaths from kill streaks though. These are, by far, the easiest deaths to prevent. If you have not yet devoted one of your custom slots to an Anti-air class, go do it now. For the love of FSM, just do it! Maybe everyone knows they can do it, but are thinking ""Surely someone else will shoot down the apache, so I won't bother."" Guess what, ** no one else will kill it** Sure, you can hide, but you can't be sure your teammates will, and that means more kills for the enemy, which means more killstreaks. This is not good. Shoot down all deadly, airborn killstreaks. Once the Apache/AC130/Chopper Gunner/Osprey/etc is announced, switch to your anti-air class and shoot it down if you die. I promise you, that no one else will. **Shoot the middle chopper in a Strafe Run, it will blow the other two up!** 

Something new in MW3, is the explosive carepackage. It only took me 10 deaths to learn to not pickup enemy care packages without sitrep. **Just stop picking up carepackages if they are not yours.** 

Use EMP grenades. Kill SAMs, sentry turrets, and any other ground-based killstreaks with them. You'll get credit for a kill, and you'll help your team. 


**Stop dying in a fair gunfight**

So another, big issue I had was my aim sucked and I'd die in a fair gunfight. Sometimes I would get the first shot off even and I'd be the one dead in a mid/long range fight. This is so frustrating! You cannot immediately improve your aim. It takes time, but what you can do is improve your survivability. If you are shooting at someone in mid/long range and miss, or you lose your hit marker after a few hits and they are still alive, turn around and run away. Don't strafe, don't back up and hide, do NOT go prone behind that car. Turn the fuck around and run. For me, it was hard for me to accep that I had to cut my losses. **If they are hitting you and you aren't hitting them, you will die if you stay. RUN!** I don't mean, run to cover. I mean, run away entirely. Move on. Your position was comprimised and if you poke your head there again, you will die. Even if someone else kills your target, you can expect that at least 1 or 2 of his friends spawned near him and will have seen your red dot on the minimap when you were shooting. Another thing that was tough was the 'turning around' part. I used to strafe  away. I eventually realized that I died about 80% of the time when I did this. Once I learned to turn around and sprint around the corner and then keep going, I was dying only 20% of the time in these kind of gunfight situations.



**Winning a gunfight**

Let's move on to increasing kills to improve our K/D ratio. Remember those lost gunfights I told you to run away from? What if you just stop losing them entirely? Besides just having enough time put in to learn to aim properly, there are some simple things you can do to help win each type of gunfight. In long range gun fights, firing in bursts is essential. If you have an automatic weapon, try to fire in 2/3 round bursts. This allows you a faction of a second to makeup for the kick back of the gun. The further away your enemy, the less effective spraying them with bullets will be. If they are out in the open, aim at the body, not the head. If your sights are aimed at their feet when you pull the trigger, feel free to do a 4/5 round burst first and then 2/3 round bursts after. 

Also, get in the habit of **squeezing the trigger**. Don't pull it, yank it, or smash it with your finger, but squeeze it. Get used to the minimum amount of pressure it takes to actually fire. This may not make sense at first, but the same holds true with firing a real weapon. The idea is that you want to move the trigger to the point at which the weapon fires. The goal is NOT to make the trigger move as far as it can as fast as you can. Once you learn to do this, your trigger finger movements will be much more efficienty and your brain will hone in your hand/eye coordination that much faster.

From the [OFFICIAL RULES](http://www.rankupxp.com/Rules/):

&gt; **NO PURCHASE NECESSARY:** To receive one (1) free game piece and a copy of these Official Rules, while supplies last, send your name and complete address postmarked on or before December 16, 2011 to: *DewXP Promotion P.O. Box 760017, El Paso, TX 88576-0017*. Limit one (1) free game piece request per hand-addressed stamped outer envelope. No photocopies or mechanically reproduced requests will be accepted. Sponsors assume no liability for lost, late, stolen, illegible, incomplete, misdirected, mutilated or postage-due mail or requests.

*Note about the following prices:* I took them from my local Wal-Mart; if anybody would have these products the cheapest it would be them. And regarding the cost of the special 20 packs of Mtn Dew, my Wal-Mart didn't have any in stock, so I averaged the cost per can between the 12 and 24 pack.

The max number of minutes you can add to a Gamer ID is 24 hours, 1,440 minutes. The cost of stamps is 44 cents. The rules do not elaborate upon the value of the game piece you will recieve in the mail, but it is likely a simple 15 minute piece due to the ease with which it is obtained.

*****
    $0.44 * 96      = $42.24
    100ct envelope  = $5.94

    Total           = $48.18

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    3oz. bag        1.28    15     0.09    96 bags         122.88

*****

In short: you can max out a Gamer ID with ~$50 and just mailing in for game pieces, which is the cheapest way. The second cheapest is to purchase 16 bags of 17oz Dorritos from Wal-Mart (base cost; local taxes apply).

*****

**UPDATE:** I previously neglected to include into my calculations the combat cards you recieve for each code you enter. As there are 15 in total and you're able to trade them, I'll assume you'll only need 15 codes to get them all, thus reducing the minute cap to 1350 minutes, knocking out 90 minutes worth of codes and products you'll need to collect/buy. The corrected calculations are as follows:

    $0.44 * 90      = $39.60
    100ct envelope  = $5.94

    Total           = $45.54

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Product        Price   Mins.  $/min   # of units   Total cost
                                            to max

    3oz. bag        1.28    15     0.09    90 bags         115.20

Something to take note of: While, as pointed out by [WoodysGamertag](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjKPPh_uWes), electing to go the 17oz Doritos route gives you the added bonus of being well stocked in gaming consumables, as the game codes from Doritos are printed on the outsides of their packaging, there is a risk of someone having copied down the code without buying the chips and using the code themeselves. This is somewhat compensated for by the fact the Doritos codes can be used twice (albeit on separate DewXP accounts), but there's still the chance two people have had the same idea.

Also, while going the Doritos route nets you food, going the mail route will get you considerably more prize entries, depending on your preference."	t5_2rp9s	True

The only class you can pick for All or Nothing has been named after my gamertag! They just [tweeted me](https://twitter.com/#!/InfinityWard/status/185857921383530496). I'm so happy, now I'm just bracing myself for the flood of friend requests :3
I want to give a HUGE thank you to all IW members and I am glad you guys liked All or Nothing! I also made a guide to AoN [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/rl3al/all_or_nothing_guide_from_the_man_who_made_it/).


First I would like to start off by saying I'm not angry. If I don't get credit I won't care so much. I am happy enough knowing that millions of people will be playing a game mode that I invented.

Here's the story. On February 10th I made a game mode and my friend decided I should name it All or Nothing. I recorded it and uploaded to youtube and made this post:
[http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/pmb7v/i_think_i_accidentally_made_an_epic_game_mode/](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/pmb7v/i_think_i_accidentally_made_an_epic_game_mode/)

I was happy with what I made and since then  have been playing it with friends and MW3 players. My guess is that Bancandy saw it because she is the one who posted the news here:
[http://community.callofduty.com/message/205523060#205523060](http://community.callofduty.com/message/205523060#205523060)

What gets me though is I had no idea about this. Even without credit I would have expected a heads up. Can Bancandy or another IW member tell me what's going on? Even if I can't be given credit I would like to know what's happening."	t5_2rp9s	True

1320927605.0	m7c4g	Pro Tips MW3	Prankish	238	40	133	"So have been looking a lot at this sub-reddit since launch and have learned quite a few things and was thinking we could try and compile it into one large thread. 

Some tips/tricks I've seen so far:

* 
Specialist package has got to be the best for leveling. Using hardline it takes 1,3,5,7 kill(s) to get the 200 points for getting the perk. Also an extra 50 points for each kill after 7 is amazing considering your extremely effective with all the perks.
     * Another thing I love about the specialist package is that you get more kills with your gun rather than spending time using a kill streak such as osprey or AC130. I am currently working toward gold G36C and I want that bad boy soon.


* 
I believe this will be fixed but as of now i only use EMP grenade because killing a SAM or a Sentry seems to add a kill to my point streak? I can kill the equipment without putting myself in danger and I get a free kill toward my point streak. At least untill they fix this of course.
     * As effectsfire pointed out this is not a bug! Evidently this is intentional to encourage people to destroy point streak rewards. So take out those stingers and replace their point streaks with yours!
          EDIT: I believe this applies to capturing/destroying objectives as well.

* 
Kill confirmed seems to be the best game mode for leveling. Me and my buddy just share half of our kill points by letting the other take the tag. We are always getting a great amount of points. I only use specialist so I don't run into the problem of having to try and get a tag after I killed a guy halfway across the map with a predator. Denying kills is also great. One time I ran through and collected 6 tags at once. Quick 300 points not counting the kills themselves.  
     * As anEnglishman pointed out, untill now SND, I believe, has been considered that quickest way to gain xp. The only problem is that it is highly dependent on your skill because dying early in the round may mean no points at all. 

That's about all I can remember at this point. Any tips would be great and I will be editing this if I get any.

Tips from comments:
&gt;* 
ReeColi:   When people call out strafe runs, shoot the helicopter in the middle. It blows up the two adjacent helicopters as well, and adds 3 points towards your point streak.

 
&gt;* 
rh1nos:   Try putting only 1 point streak on (e.g. UAV) so you can keep cycling through the same point streak. This will help you complete that point streaks challenges a lot quicker. 

&gt;* 
twenty0ne:   Use marksman, even if you don't snipe. Seriously. It's a huge advantage to more easily see where enemies are at when they're partially obscured by cover or blending in with the environment.
 
&gt;* 
loganz:   Ive been running support killstreaks (UAV and Ballistic Vests ONLY). If you play groundwar, you throw down your ballistic vests at spawn, and everyone picks it up lol.. its 50 points a pop.. 11 team mates, and it stays there for a while... ive been consistently getting 8000-10,000 points per game (without double xp).
Also, save your double XP for later in the prestige, when you are close to hitting a bunch of challenges (10,000 XP etc).. There is no sense in using Double XP from the beginning, since points come slow, and you have no challenges to complete.

&gt;* 
BigStein:   If you're using the FMG9 machine pistol, you know how there is the initial flip animation? Well that only happens the first time you switch to it, so switch to it (and switch back to primary) immediately when you spawn so that the animation doesn't happen at a bad time.

EDIT: At this point I will just be placing tips up here. If you like the tip please find and upvote the guy who wrote it"	t5_2rp9s	True

*16. January 2012: Added some perks tips, Recon Pro and Blind Eye*

------

**GENERAL GAMEPLAY**

* Laying prone and changing weapons make you kinda seem like a dead body (bmcclure937: Only with Assasin Pro, otherwise they see your name).
* Blinking spot icons mean someone is capturing them (if they are grey and blinking it's your team, other team can capture a grey icon without any way to tell, if they are red and blinking it means your team is capturing them).
* You can survive stealth bomber by lying prone directly under your trophy system. (by HybridFx)   
* You can quickly detonate C4. PC: press F twice. XBOX: press X twice. PS3: Press Square twice. You should never detonate any other way. (by HybridFx)   
* Stealth bombers become visible in the radar when you have color-blind mode enabled. Activate this in option menu where you adjust sensitivity.
* Jump and knife a ladder before climbing for quicker weapon draw at the top. (by bmcclure937)
* If you hear a bouncing betty go off, go prone and it won't damage you, if you just crouch you might get away with just massive damage. 
* Sprinting or double tapping change weapon is a quick way to cancel your reload if you are doing so while an enemy is about to shoot you. (Sprinting seems to be most recommended.)
* Planting prone paralell to a bombspot gives better cover in some spots.
* Knifing a Recon Drone and Ballistic Vests destroys it.
* [Yomega260 tips channel.](http://www.youtube.com/user/yomega260/featured)
* [cyrex's How to not suck at MW3 thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/m91m7/how_not_to_suck_at_mw3_and_increase_your_kd_ratio/)


**QUICK XP**   

* [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/nllyr/leveling_tip_use_your_secondaries/)
* [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/oavcd/mw3_protips_collection_thread/c3fwhj7)
* Kill Confirmed is generally agreed upon as the quickest way to get XP. Team Defender is also good.
* SnD is a slow way to level weapon XP, but some argue it's great for normal XP.
* Recon Drone is a great way to get XP. You get XP for each tag, and when they die you get extra XP.
* Do the daily and weekly challenges.
* Specialist package grants large XP. Use Hardline making the 1st Kill +100 and every other kill +100. When you reach 7 kills w/o dying you're rewarded 500xp. Change up the perks often to get challenge XP. (by untempered_schism)  
* Leveling up guns to gold is not a good way to get XP, you should not do more than 500 kills with each Assault RIFLE for max XP per kill. 300 Kills for SMGs. Do Kick and Attatchment challenges since they are easiest.
* An easy way to get XP is from using Extreme Conditioning Pro and Dead Silence Pro. Find an object you can mantle and just go up and down for a while, you complete perk challenges quickly.
* For weapon XP, no matter what gametype you play, you get 100 weapon XP per kill. Accolades you get (like buzzkill, etc), count towards weapon XP. Also, weapon challenges will count as well (Marksman, Expert, Veteran, Mastery, attachment challenges, etc).


**PERKS TIPS**  

* ""Holding your breath"" while aiming down the sights with a non-sniper rifle counts towards Marksman Pro, even though it doesn't affect your shot/accuracy.
* Easiest way to get Sitrep Pro is by planting your Trophy System and knifing it each time you spawn (it counts as enemy equipment destroyed).
* Dick move, but in Hardcore friendly Tactical Insertions count as enemy equipment destroyed towards Sitrep Pro.
* Easiest way to get Recon Pro: Team Defender, AR w grenade launcher, frag grenade/semtex and smaw. Launch every explosive you have through windows and into rooms where the flag is. You should be able to get recon pro in just a couple of games. Just use all your explosives first every time you die.
* Blind Eye: Every enemy killstreak counts, that includes sentries, IMS, etc. Use together with sitrep. Remember to take out CUAVs aswell as UAVs. When you cant find the UAV just lock onto the sky and spin around until you hear beaping.
* Overkill Pro: Equip your favorite SMG as your seconddary, Steady Aim Pro (optional) and Extreme Conditioning, you should get alot of kills quickly running around with this in domination, althought your KD might suffer if this isn't your normal playstyle.


**WEAPONS/EQUIPMENT TIPS**   

* Scrambler works as Blind Eye inside it's area (enemy helicopters and air killstreaks wont see you).
* Jumping while tossing grenades/flashes/stuns/C4 allows for more distance. (by bmcclure937).
* Dual FMG9s can take out a juggernaut in less than a clip.
* Dual Five Sevens have instant reload with Reload Cancel (by bmcclure937)
* Extended magazines increases starting ammo as well. (by HybridFx)
* Crouching and laying prone grant huge accuracy bonuses to LMGs and Sniper Rifles (i.e. less sway and recoil).
* Stinger can lock onto Assault Drones.  
* Stinger can lock onto Recon Drone, but it has a flare so it takes two shots.
* The Stinger ""sticks up"" and can reveal your position behind low cover.
* The longer you aim down the sight the more weapon sway you experience. Counter this by quickly reaiming.
* Play Hardcore modes to level up your shotguns faster. ([thread by TheLoganBoy](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/nwyqd/need_help_leveling_up_your_shotgun/))
* Javelin can lock onto friendly air support and almost anything else.
* The javelin has a huge impact radius.
* Aim javelin into a room to make it launch into the room and explode in the roof (will wipe out entire rooms).
* Emp destroys senteries and recon drones. 
* [Learn about XM-25, it's better than you think.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg83t-2RaTw&amp;list=UUbBZUq_lLroTohd8abgZpLw&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plcp)
* Trophy system takes out Predator Misseles, RPG, Javelin, AC-130 bombs in addition to nades/flashes/c4.
* From a crouching or prone position, the RSASS can generally fire 2 shots on target before recoiling off-centre (i.e. double tapping). Coupled with a silencer, this effectively allows a silent 1 hit kill regardless of hit-zone. 

**KILLSTREAK TIPS**

* Shooting down helicopters, uav, destroying killstreaks, destroy SAM, senteries, etc, capping flags, points in domination and all missions count towards your killstreak.
* Shooting down Strafe Helicopters will shoot down the two next to it, aim for the second on the side with first shot, and then either one with your second striker shot. Boom 1500 points and 5 points towards your killstreak.
* When using a killstreak with laptop, cancel (Y or Triangle) as soon as the laptop is open to skip closing animation afterwards.
* Specialist bonus gives you every weapon proficency in the game from every gun tier. Kick, Flinch, Focus, Breathe, Speed, Melee and etc (by HybridFx) *EXCEPTION: Shotguns do not get damage proficency.* 
* Recon Drone can tag enemy UAV so they show up on radar.   
* Two active UAVs make the line go faster; three active UAVs makes at an Advanced UAV; four active UAVs make AUAV sweep faster.
* Use Hardline and only Assault UAV selected for quick UAVs that build up to AUAV.
* Alternativly use Hardline and only Support UAV and CUAV selected.
* Press R1 (PS3) when using predator to give it a speed boost.

1325851278.0	o5c4s	MW3 Multiplayer Tips	blobber109	214	45	237	"1. Recon Drones can activate enemy Bouncing bettys
    If you have tagged everyone in a SnD round then you could move on to looking for BBs, IMSs, Claymores.

2. You can shoot enemy ballistic vests until they disappear for 100 points

3. You can 'target' friendly aircraft with your javelin to aim at a position that you can't see, especially useful in Drop Zone

4. Teammates spawning mean area is clear of enemies (Hopefully)

5. If you can count on your gun skills in TDM don't head to the area where there is a gun battle going on; flank around the back for all the kills

6. If you have an un-silenced weapon for you primary it is a good idea to have something like a silenced MP9 or Scorpion secondary for if you want to do flanking without the enemy turning around and noticing you

7. For faster XP use a lot of different guns during your ranking up. The easy challenges that you get at the start of using a weapon do boost your XP quite a bit

8. If you find a good choke point and you have an LMG or sniper lay down. In MW3 they have made it so when you are prone sway on LMGs and Snipers is **heavily** reduced.

9.Have a stinger class ready for when you hear Ac130, Osprey gunner and AH-6 incoming at the same time, or if you hear Strafe run because that's about 3000 free XP!

10.Do the daily and weekly challenges. They will sometimes just be to jump 15 feet and survive and that would be a free 1000 Xp or get 50 kills within a short period of time of ADS with quickdraw on, 5000 xp.

11. If you find your K/D sky rocketing and your Win/Loss plummeting jump on TDM. Right now it's full of Christmas noobs and if you have good gun skills or map knowledge you can 'lone-wolf' TDM

12. If a frag is thrown into a room with a few teammates and it is rolling around then pick it up. You may suicide but it will stop the enemy getting a triple

13. Rapid fire and silencer on a Sub is an unbeatable combo. Guns such as the PP90M1 or P90 are still effective at long range with burst fire but they can kill faster than shot guns at close range

14. If you hear a bouncing betty spinning off go prone. They do no damage to you when you are prone

15. When smashing glass knife cancel. This works best on tactical layout as you have to knife, then pull out a semtex/throwing knife/claymore/bouncing betty/tactical insertion/scrambler and then press Y. If you time it right you can take out SAM turrets, windows and sentry guns in half the time. (This also works for riot shields giving you quick melee before you get it)

16. Play different gamemodes to keep the game fresh. You'd be surprised by the differences

If I think of anything else I'll add them later.

Many of these people would LOVE double weapon xp weekends, to help get their gold guns and such.

Here's my idea, the first time you log in during an event a message pops up and makes you select 1) Double XP or 2) Double Weapon XP. Whatever one you choose you get for the remainder of the event.

With this, those who are still leveling can benefit from double xp, and those who are not leveling can benefit from double weapon xp.

There are countless more people without Elite Premium than there are with it. You guys outnumber us immensely. Yet it feels absolute AWESOME to be in this super privileged minority, right? I mean, we get all the new DLC before anyone else (and I'm on Xbox, so I get it before *ANYONE* else). We get cool features on the Elite site. We get our own bat-shit super-cool playlist even. 

**This is all completely, and totally false. Here is the reality of the Elite service.**

1. **The Elite Website**
A lot of you already know this so I will keep it short. The Elite site is a total joke. It touts detailed stats, but the statistics it provides are less detailed than the ones that shipped WITH Black Ops, for which no subscription service was required. Then you have the horrible functionality of the site. After logging in, you *still get prompted to log in* and even *upgrade to Elite Premium* despite already having it. It's completely and totally broken. I have been a web designer for over eight years, and I know what goes into making a great site. Elite is not a great site, but perhaps a polar opposite. Strangely enough, it was designed by one of the most amazing web design firms out there (2advanced). 

2. **The Elite Concept**
When Elite was first announced, a huge feature that it touted was social-networking for COD players. The service COMPLETELY lacks that. You can join social groups, but you can't do anything after that. You can't coordinate events or meet people in said groups. The clan service is a total joke. You have to either create your own clan or find one on a random forum to join. How can this be called networking if you can't even have enlistments for clans? And why the *hell* are some of the clan leveling-up rewards unlocks for the Elite website that changes the backgrounds of pages? Fuck do I want that for? 

3. **Getting content early**
In theory this is awesome, in practice it's a joke. Three new maps have been released so far, and as an Elite Premium member my choices are extremely limited. I can't play the maps with my friends, I can't play the maps with non-Elite members, and I can't play the game types that I want on them. **The playlists don't even exclusively feature the new maps. I have to play three matches of Headquarters on Bootleg before even having a chance to vote for a new map.** As an EP member, I desperately want to play with the hundreds of thousands of players not in our playlist, and not with the 15k or so that are. 

4. **Elite Playlists...are terrible**
The options for game modes are very limited in Elite Playlists, but on top of that you can only play with what is basically the best of the COD community. None of my friends own the Elite service so I have to solo every match against players who are as good as I am or better. I have a 2.22 K/D and ~1.0 W/L, and even I have an insanely hard time playing well on the playlist. **Which would be fine, if that didn't mean being forced into try-hard mode for every match.** If I want a casual game on a new map, forget about it. My only options are to enter beast mode and still be raped in the butt by the 6-man teams that run rampant on the Elite playlist.

5. **The content is not even that good**
One or two new maps every month is not more than previous COD titles. Oh, and despite fourzerotwo desperately not wanting to have flashback maps count as Elite DLC, looks like that's what we will be getting. I love the old maps. I wish many of them would make a comeback in this game. But not via the Elite Premium service. The content isn't bad, it's just not any better than what Treyarch and IW have always been releasing. It's not revolutionary. You know what would be? New guns, new perks, new killstreaks. THAT'S some DLC that I would gladly call new and exciting. Releasing 1-2 maps every month instead of 3-5 maps every four months is not fucking innovative.

So for fuck's sake, how can we get IW and Activision to see the error of their ways and release DLC properly so that it doesn't cause a giant rift in the community like it is right now?"	t5_2rp9s	True

Something that not a lot of people seem to know is that you're able to take screenshots while playing by opening your XMB, and going to your photo tab. There will be a screenshot button there and the screenshot will save to your image folder.

It's spawning them everywhere which is ruining kill streaks and making it extremely easy for them to dominate us."" Response: ""... ... C SECURED!"" ffffuuuuuu

2. If they do listen, they disagree with you. ""FUCK YOU MAN I PLAY THE OBJECTIVE, I CAPTURE EVERYTHING, YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU STUPID GAYFAGGOTNIGGER."" 

3. They're immature 8-15 year old brats who respond to everything you say with ""YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU STUPID GAYFAGGOTNIGGER.""

4. They're in a group of friends talking about some random inconsequential shit. They refuse to make a god damn party and talk there. ""YO DAWG, U SEE JENNIFAR'Z TITTEH IN CLASS TODAY?!"" 
""YEAH DAWG""
""YO BRODAWG WE SO WASTED""
""YA BRO WE SO FKKIN WASTED HOLY SHIIIIIITTEEEE""

5. The constant bitching from the guy who is last place on your team. ""YOU GAYFAGGOTNIGGERS ALL SUCK DICK! STOP PLANTING THE BOMB! WHY WONT ANYONE PLACE CLAYMORES AROUND ME! FUCK YOU STOP SHOOTING THE ENEMY WITH YOUR SNIPERS U FAGGAAATROOONAODIR*&amp;^@^%@!""

6. Your crappy taste in music is playing in the background, and while dubstep has its place in my car and at a club, over a fucking mic it sounds like three kangaroos taking a constipated shit in a thunderstorm.

7. You breathe like a fucking lunatic. This can be excusable if you're having sex/recently transformed into a puppy, but otherwise, fuck you.

8. Women. Of the three girls I play with regularly on MW3, all three practically refuse to play outside of a Live party because of #3 and #9. If they are playing outside of a party, they insta-mute everyone. **pro tip** Nobody on COD wants to have sex with you, but they may be interested in a friendship if you don't come off like someone who recently coated their lips with santorum.

9. BRODAWGS. You know these guys, they think their .95 k/d ratio and 12th prestige makes them the manliest of men. I actually heard a group of these motherfuckers proclaim they are part of the Aryan brotherhood, and curse out some black guy who served in the US Army and was talking about all the accuracies and inaccuracies of the game, something most of us normal fucking people find interesting.  

**in summation, many people find it easier to just mute everyone from the get-go instead of dealing with their shit halfway through an intense match**

I don't do that, and I selectively mute only players that fit into the above categories. I'm always on the look out for hilarious people to play with who take the game seriously enough to actually use teamwork where applicable. It seems that everyone I do end up playing with I met through real friends, or are from COD4/MW2/Blops.

If you do disagree with me, don't give your downvote finger an orgasm just yet, and post why below. I'd love to have a discussion about all the in-game mic etiquette, and **if you have anything to add to the list, post it too and if it is legible and makes sense, I'll throw the fucker right in!**"	t5_2rp9s	True

But, in the heat of the moment, it happened. I saw an opponent move into my periphery and before I realized what had happened, he was dead. I looked down in horror at my own hands, terrified at the fact that this aptitude towards terror had never manifested itself before. Yet, there I was, one kill higher and barely any aim had been taken. 

I cannot take back what I have done. I can only make amends and ask for the support of the community. 

Please /r/mw3, help me to move past this horrid mistake and attempt to become a better person in the process.

Thank you."	t5_2rp9s	True

1321285733.0	mbvc4	The Great Big List of MW3 Tips 	bluearmy	149	18	169	"[This](http://redd.it/bx71p) post in r/MW2 was a great help to lots of people looking for tips on MW2. I'd like to create a list for all of us here on r/MW3. So, if you have a tip that would be helpful, post it in the comments below!

EDIT: Keep the tips coming! I am adding a list below based on the comments so far.

* 3 UAVS at the same time from different people on the same team become Advanced UAV
* With Color Blind Mode enabled you can see enemy Stealth Bomber
* Sitrep will tell you if an enemy care package is real or not
* You can level up your sitrep by deploying and then destroying your own Trophy System
* On an enemy strafe run, shoot the middle helicopter to take out the other two. They will give you multiple points towards your pointstreak for each helicopter destroyed
* Get Blast Shield Pro (immune to flash and stun nades) by blowing up barrels and cars while standing next to them
* Turn off theater mode for less lag
* Specialist killstreak + hardline = fast leveling up of pro perks (can get hardline pro in a few games)
* When using specialist, don't have your original 3 perks include Sleight of Hand or Scavenger, but have them as your rewards since you won't need to reload or get more ammo until after you have already killed a few enemies
* Shooting down air support, taking dom points, capture and returning flags, and assists (with hardline pro), all count towards killstreaks
*Assassin will keep you from being seen by UAV/AUAV, but Blind Eye will keep you from being shot by helecoptors/AC130, do not confuse the two
* Juggernauts have about 500 health, and can heal all of it back if they take no damage for long enough. They are NOT invincible, and can be easily killed with focused fire and surrounding them, 5 knives also does the trick. When someone has a jug on your team, let them enter a firefight first, draw fire, then you enter in and kill everyone doing the shooting
* Bouncing Betties don't affect you when in prone, no matter how close you are.
All weapons (at least ARs and SMGs, not sure about shotguns and sniper rifles) get an increase in idle sway the longer you aim down sight
* If you clear all your Assault Killstreaks and use only UAV and hardline, you can get a UAV for every 2 kills. This applies to everything killstreak

I'm not sure if this has been mentioned before but I visit this subreddit almost daily/use the Recon Drone nearly every game and have never come across this feature. It actually is listed on the COD Wiki so I'm aware that some of you may already know of this but I just thought I'd share this little tidbit for those that don't.

EDIT: Another tip: Recon Drones can trigger motion-sensitive explosive devices such as Claymores which can help your team as the Drone can take the hit instead of a teammate and if you're nimble enough you may even be able to escape unscathed (Note: I also noticed that Stalker Pro does not help in delaying the timer on Claymores/I.M.S. while using the Recon Drone)"	t5_2rp9s	True

The other day I ran into a whole clan of chirping preteens on SND. Loud and obnoxious in the lobby, fag this fag that, you've seen them before. I wasn't playing with a clan, and as is often the case when playing solo against organized teams, my team was getting wrecked. They were decent players, and playing to win.

Now I'm not all that huge about winning, as long as I pop off a few kills here and there, so I was getting ready for 4-0 gg nextmap sorta game. [Then this round happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A73MATNj5jc&amp;context=C4a69581ADvjVQa1PpcFMBIPyODrhmwF2d2R9ks5K9MZX6iD-gpsU=).

Not only did I hear huge ""WOOOOOWS"" and ""YOU FAGGOT"" after every kill (especially that stupid doublekill, during which there was a layered set of WOOOW WHAT THE FUUUs), they really layed on the abuse in the intermission. The usual incomprehensible ""You're not good tryhard, stop using your weapons"" type stuff. So I decided I'd try and win it just to see them blow up.

I ended up going 18-3, winning 4-3, which sent them into some sort of prepubescent peanut butter and horseshit mega rage. They vowed to ""fuck that poodlebear up"" the next game, so I stuck around figuring my luck would run out eventually. Then I won. Again, and again, and again. I won 5-6 games in a row, carrying my team most of the time. It was glorious.

Eventually their vitriol dried up, and I had to go, but that series of games was the most satisfying experience I've had in cod in a long while.

This was a blast and really allowed people to sharpen their sniping skills. If COD developed a couple of these split maps for sniper play would you guys support it? Think of Afgan with a split boundary and more equal cover. I feel that this would be awesome and maybe get some of the sniping only guys from the regular games.	t5_2rp9s	True

I was doing mediocre maybe 5-3, but I did mannage to get a care package. I threw the smoke and it was on its way. Unfortunately at that same moment an enemy decided to kill me. I figured I lost it. Through the TV I beard a teammate of mine start yelling. He was probably just upset. I waited to respawn and sure enough it was close to my care package. I ran over to check if it was still there. As I turned the corner i saw my uncle camping next to it., and a few dead bodies surrounding it. They were teammates. I looked at the score card and noticed he was in the negative even though he had 3 kills. He saved my care package for me and gave me an attack chopper.

We call this challenge ""The Gauntlet."" It is a very simple challenge in that you enter the standard playlist and starting with team death match and see how many games it takes you to get from the top to the bottom. Each time you win a match you move on to the next category, I.e. Team Death Match to Kill Confirmed to Mercenary etc. if you lose the match you stay on that category until you/your team wins. A perfect run is only 12 matches, meaning you never lost. Only full games count, so if you get thrown into a game in progress that is just a free game, doesn't count toward your total or advancement. The goal is to see who can get through all twelve in the least number of games. It combines skill and luck into one neat package. My best total is 32, getting the win in FFA was my demon for 6 matches.  Try it an tell me what you think."	t5_2rp9s	True

I guess the best way I can put this is, if you think MW3 is broken on xbox and it's got to be better on PC, **you're going to have a bad time.** Seriously, the very *first* lobby I joined had a player with a K/D of 62.00. I immediately left and joined a new lobby. This one? two players with K/D's over 40. What the actual fuck? It took me 6 or 7 tries to find a lobby with stats that didn't appear absurdly wrong, and each game was just laggy as all hell (despite my bugatti of a pc and flawless connection), and full of more juvenile trash-talking than I've ever seen in a game. I know keyboards sort of embolden people to communicate more, but I've never seen such dickery in CS:S, or Battlefield for that matter.

Why would you purchase this game for PC? I mean, I'm generally of the ""shooters are better with a keyboard and mouse) camp-- but fuck, that is not the case for anything with an Infinity Ward label on the box. You PC players should storm the headquarters and demand an adequate product.

-Within the first 30 seconds of spawning someone will either run by you or you'll run past their spawn.

-Figure out certain player's strategies because towards the end when all the support streaks start flying you'll want to know how to get those last few kills fast.

-The higher the rank of opponents the more likely you'll want to run dead silence.

-Pick up someone's gun BEFORE you think you need it. 

-When you kill someone expect them to come back and try to counter specifically how you killed them.

-With an unsilenced gun every kill/shot will make enemies flock to you. Depending on your map knowledge and how secure the area is either move away quickly or establish a defense.

-Note where you spawned, someone else will spawn there when you move a certain minimum distance away. People new to free for all often get irritated at getting shot in the back repeatedly for this reason.

-Expect the stuff you hate and you think is overpowered. It's likely that what annoys you the most will be what you run in to the most often.

-Reload under cover, call in kill streaks under cover, anything that momentarily prevents you from shooting should be done under cover.

-Corner campers are usually lower level and stay exactly where they spawn. If you know the map, spawns, and enemies then it should minimize the frustration.

-Most of your deaths will be to one person simply because you two are playing the game in a way that will create constant clashes between the two of you. I.e. If you're rushing you're less likely to encounter the people who patrol an area.

-The portable radar is like a teammate, use it to cover your back but don't rely on it too much.

-The IMS right near a spawn is hilarious. Don't put it or C4 exactly on a spawn as you have temporary explosive immunity when you respawn.

-Watch killcams. Notice details and exploit them. Seeing that an enemy is using something other than sleight of hand makes me use cover more until the reload comes.

I have a theory that they only people who don't constantly moan about this (or any other) game are those over 30 who, like me, grew up playing DOOM.

Go play a that for a month - I promise you all your troubles will fade away and playing modern games will feel like you've just been dropped naked into a bath filled to the brim with honey-coated unicorn dust.

1351205659.0	123cjz	Did anyone else see Elite as a waste of money?	Danyulz	124	27	76	"Around May time, I entered a competition on Twitter for a year of Elite free. Mark Rubin of Infinity Ward asked ""Who voiced Gaz, Ghost and Wallcroft?"". I quickly answered Craig Fairbrass. It was one of those weird things you remember from credits and it just came to me. Anyway, I won the competition and got a [code](http://imgur.com/VuuL8).

I played the first 3 maps of the DLC and I thought that it was alright. Most DLC's with Call of Duty are terrible, in my opinion.

Granted, I got this for free but for £30 ($48), I only like Getaway and Lookout. Most of the maps to me seemed too big (Liberation, Black Box, Foundation) and I thought the Spec Ops missions were pointless. I still to this day haven't played any of the Spec Ops missions from the DLC.

I feel as though the best DLC IW gives to us is free. Erosion and Aground were good maps along with Terminal. I felt a bit disappointed that Shipment or Rust weren't given to us but beggars can't be choosers.

The online stat tracking is good along with the videos (gun guides, Friday Night Fights) and again, I know I got this for free and there's going to be someone who says I shouldn't complain given the circumstances but if I spent £30 on this, I'd be left disappointed.

Then again, I felt disappointed with MW3 as a whole but that's for another discussion. What do you guys think of Elite?"	t5_2rp9s	True

Back in 2010 with MW2 they released two map packs at $15 each totaling 10 maps. Which means each map cost exactly $3. With Elite i am paying $50 for 12 new maps. Which equals out to $4.16 per map, an increase of 28%. (I know it comes with special ops crap too, but lets be fair the majority doesn't even play special ops)

1321000603.0	m8itd	Infinity ward seems to ignore Treyarchs improvements to the series. Why?	LeonWG	112	17	122	"Treyarch tends to release their games with slight improvements over what Infinity ward had done previously. Instead of adopting these improvements into the series in general, Infinity ward ignores them. These arent just differences in design choices, these are improvements which cannot be argued against. Here are a few examples

1. Xp for assists which are proportional to the damage dealt ranging from 20 to 80 xp per assist in TDM. Treyarch has done this since World at war but the modern warfare series continues to award every assist with 20 points regardless of the extent to which you contributed to the death of an enemy.

2. Awarding a kill to the player which put an enemy in last stand (final stand in the case of mw3) rather than awarding the kill to the player who killed him when he was already on the ground. Treyarch patched this into Codbo to everyones satisfaction but Infinity ward took a step backwards and reverted to the old system with final stand. (at least they removed last stand)

3. Displaying objectives captured and defended in the score boards of objective based games. This was in codbo but not in mw3. It is a real shame because it encourages objective oriented playing rather than trying to rack up an impressive amount of kills.

Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. Id just like to know why they decided to ignore these obvious improvements. I cant think of a logical explanation. "	t5_2rp9s	True

1344722501.0	y2dg5	Youtube Spam	onefingerattack	103	15	53	"Over the last two weeks, we've seen a large influx of Youtube spam. We're talking about 10-20 new accounts being setup everyday, just to post their videos. So far today, 27 videos have been sent to the spam filter. Just thought I'd make the rules about YT spam clear to all of our newcomers:

##What is spam?

If your sole purpose for using Reddit is to promote your own Youtube channel, you will most likely be marked down as a spammer, **regardless** of how many subscribers you have. Seriously; there are literally **no exceptions** here. Remember the Raw Instinct debacle? The reason he wasn't getting any views from Reddit is because he had been previously tagged as a spammer. He had 200K+ subscribers and it didn't matter. He was using Reddit for the sole purpose of getting more views and it wasn't tolerated. To put this **no exceptions** policy into perspective: I've even moderated links that were posted by personal friends of mine. This is a blanket across-the-board rule and absolutely everyone has to abide by it.

##Can I post my own videos?

Yes... IF you are a contributing member who takes part in the community or Reddit as a whole. If you regularly contribute to Reddit via comments etc and other non-YT-based-submissions, you're allowed to post your own videos. That's the benefit of being a **contributing member**. That's the benefit of being apart of the community. If you signed up just to get some extra views, you are wasting your time.

##What's a spam filter?

The Reddit anti-spam script runs every time you submit something. It vets your account and it can be extremely sensitive. If it thinks that you might be spamming, your submissions will be sent to the spam filter. This means that a moderator will have to review your submission before anyone can see it. For example; here are some of the things that might cause you to end up in the spam filter:

* You own a new account and you are posting links.
* Your last submission received more downvotes than upvotes.
* You're posting a link to a website that has already been previously marked down as spam.
* You used alt accounts to upvote your own submission (yes, this gets noticed).
* You setup an alt account to try and avoid the spam filter (yes, this gets noticed).
* You deleted a post and tried to re-submit it.
* Your previous submission was confirmed as being spam by a moderator.
* You keep posting links to the same websites / YT channel.

##What's the review process like?

On any given day, 20-50 submissions can end up in the spam filter. For each submission, a moderator has to review the account of the submitter. We can't confirm everything as spam because there's a chance that an innocent submitter might get fucked over and we can't approve everything because there's a chance that spammers will get through. This means that every post caught in the spam filter has to be manually reviewed by a moderator. If your post is caught by the spam filter, your account will be looked at and it will be determined whether or not you're a contributing member. If you're a regular contributor, your post will be approved and it will be pushed to the top of the new queue. If you're a spammer, you'll be tagged as a spammer and all of your future posts will go into the spam filter. Note that this isn't the case for every subreddit. On most subreddits, moderators don't even review the spam filter because of the work that is involved. They just leave you to rot.

##I saw a spammer, WHAT DO
If you see a spammer, simply press the report button and their post will be reviewed by one of the mods. If they're a spammer, they'll be tagged and bagged. If not, the report will be ignored.

The Ah-6 is like my friend who follows me around and rubs my back after a long day then moves away the next moment.

Ditto for the reaper....usually I get at least two kills with that tho so i feel slightly less sad. 

The pave low never makes it to the first kill before getting shot down. 

My poor ac-130, I hardly knew ye.

I'm not stupid enough to use a strafe run.

Not an air streak but ""Your IMS/Sentry gun/Sam turret has been destroyed"" always brings an audible sigh of despair.

I don't think I've ever had an osprey or escort airdrop make it til the first package drop.


I take consolation in the fact that my teammates usually sympathize with my plight and refuse to attempt shooting down the other team's killstreaks. Oh hello Mr. 3-27!

It was insane. The set up I was using was uav, care package, and sentry gun with hardline. Every four kills I got all three. And I'm not even joking, I placed FIVE sentry guns that match. FIVE!

Which is like a lot. Three of them I got from earning the sentry guns from the four kills, one I got from a care package, the other I stole from someone elses care package. I remember placing two sentry guns side by side on that thing in front of the building. In the open area. One I had in the back corner. I just ran around with the pm9 and let the sentry guns do their work, before I knew it, I was tied with someone at 1450. At that point I started freaking out and looking for someone, and suddenly switched to akimbo fmgs. I bumped into a guy in those back stairs. I literally ran into him and just freaked out and started spraying with the fmgs. I won! I won the match! Holy shit. Insane.

I'm sure that whoever invented the idea in MW2 was so fucking excited he made it a perk also.

Who the fuck allows these type of people into the room? What encourages someone to have fun and play better by letting them sit on their ass after they just got it handed to them? Does little billy learn anything from getting a kill in final stand or do they just want a way to say fuck you to people who get kills?

Fuck that fucking fucktard fucker all the way back to his shitty fucking computer and never let him have an idea ever again. Dock his fucking pay.

**1)** Please above all else, equip sitrep. It's the only perk that makes any sense from the 3rd slot, so equip it please. Too many times I have had to watch an idot grab a booby trapped CP only to have him kill our entire fucking team. I try yelling at them to stop but no one is ever in the game channel to listen. I beg you, if you do nothing else, please do equip sitrep, it can win matches.

**2)** Take a trophy, smoke or tactical insertion with you. All 3 are great. The TI needs some thought for placement through and is slow as fuck to deploy.

**3)** Standing in the center of the DZ will get you killed by a package 9 times out of ten.

**4)** Lay down and aim towards points of entry.

**5)** Leave shitty care packages where they are. They provide cover and the time to take to grab a CP leaves you open to getting killed, don't bother with UAVs, vests or remote turrets, they are are fucking usless. Also lay down behind the CP before you pick it up. 

**6)** Right after a DZ switches, run for it, don't stay behind to clean up the enemies, when you kill enemies, they will spawn close to the new DZ allowing them to get there before you, in fact get yourself killed, it gives you the advantage.

**7)** If you happen to be close to a really decent CP left in an old DZ which happens to be closer to you than the new DZ, grab it, but only if it's a game changer.

**8)** Blast shield or assassin are great perks and quick draw somewhat if you are using the trophy or the agonizingly slow tactical insertion. I have two DZ classes, one uses the striker and assassin they other used the riot shield and blast shield.

**9)** Don't use your trophy system as cover, because when you try and shoot the enemy on the other side of it, you will end up damaging your own trophy system. I usually lay down, deploy it and shift to the right or left.

**10)** Good defensive streaks like the IMS or sentry gun should only be deployed if there is at least 20 seconds left in the DZ, if not save it and deploy it at the next DZ for maximum effectiveness.Also if they still up and running when the DZ switches you could try dragging them with you to the new zone, rarely works though since you are wide open to getting shot. I would also save targeted strikes for when you have at least 2 enemies on a DZ, nothing worse than using your pred missle on one bozo only to have a DZ with 5 enemies in it later and no missile to take them out.

In the end its your game and you payed for it so play how you want. You want to stand in the middle of the map picking guys off beefing up your KDR without really helping, then so be it, but if you want your team to win and want to contribute, then play smart and maybe my tips will help. Killers do have their role in DZ and if that's what you are good at setup somewhere that you can take out the enemy as they get close to the DZ, leave the capping to others. 

This is how I play and I am not here to brag, but these tips get me probably and average of 3700 points on the score board, I routinely get scores over 4000 and see scores over 5000 more than I see scores less than 2500. 

Anyway, I seem to be the prophet of DZ on this sub, sorry if you're getting sick of me.

I currently am only missing the AS50 1000 Head shot title and the Dragunov 2500 kills title, and yes, I achieved the 1000 Headshots already for the Dragunov (Currently have about 1000 kills left to get the 2500 kills). I know BuenoMario has proven himself to be the most accomplished sniper I have heard of, if he has his tips to offer they are more than welcome. This isn't quick scoping, this is sniping. 

***Setups*** (These are essential, not optional)

**Primary Sniper Rifle**

* Variable Zoom
* Stability

Variable zoom allows you to be able to scan a large area of the map without unscoping, when in maximum zoom the sway is ridiculously large so stability will make it more moderate. Stability isn't necessary if you use lower zoom settings and when holding breath, switching to the maximum zoom to make pin point adjustments.

**MP9**

* Silencer 

The MP9 is almost an SMG in it's self, it has very low recoil and a good rate of fire. If I use it, it is in defense or taking a position, where you are in close quarters and it would be preferable to keep your exact location more ambiguous.

**Bouncing Betty**

This is far more easy to conceal than a Claymore which could be spotted with its red prongs, though it is easier to survive through the sound of the spring activating when tripped is IMO more noticeable than the click of the claymore which I found to fade into the sounds of battle.

**Portable Radar**

This is the most essential tool that can be offered. Sniping requires good situational awareness, this offers you excellent heads up. Though it won't find Assassins, people don't often travel alone when taking out someone held up in a position, it is likely that his buddy will set your radar off. Also when you are scoped in you lose the mini map and it's audible beep when someone is in range is a good heads up to switch to your secondary.

**Blind Eye**

To be an effective sniper you must be able to operate regardless of the situation, the constant threat of predators will be mitigated, and the running to shelter when a Heli or worse is up no longer happens. Not having to run to shelter also helps you hold your position as the enemy team start to take open ground, making them vulnerable to you, and you less vulnerable to them as opposed to you running in the open to shelter. **If you choose not to use Blind Eye, please equip a trophy system so your set up will not cost the lives and sprees of friendly snipers next to you, Scramblers will hide your red box but will notify everyone around of your presence.**

**Assassin Pro**

YOU MUST USE ASSASSIN. Sniping is about stealth, showing up on radar is just as good as standing out in the open. Also when counter-sniping, an enemy with marksman will easily see your name. I have gotten countless kills on people I can't even see just by aiming under the center of their name, the sniper house in Bakaara, on the cliff on village through a giant mess of leaves. Having your name shown will get you killed, there is nothing more to it than that. As a sniper blast shield is useless, Hardline won't mean a thing if you can't maintain a streak (you should be using Assault streaks), Overkill is useless since you should swap out your secondary the moment you can, and don't get me started on Quickdraw, you should be zoomed in most of the time making the act of ADSing faster completely marginal.

**Marksman**

Obvious choice here, it will find targets that you don't even know about. I have been finding it hard to get this to pro since I only hold breath before i shoot which apparently is not long enough to count.  Sit Rep Pro would help with sound whoring and being able to see another sniper's equipment to let you know that they are in a position near by, but it doesn't help as much as Marksman.

**Assault Kill Streaks**

* Reaper
* AC-130
* Osprey Gunner

Now this is very much up to you, you should be using Assault kill streaks since having long sprees are not uncommon. I can manage a 9-12-17 set up but a 5-9-12 would works just as well. I found specialist nice to have but once i become OMA the addition of stalker changes the move speeds I am accustom to, often getting me killed consistently at 8 kills, you could also use sniping as a good and safe way to become OMA and grabbing primaries from fallen soldiers to enjoy the perks of OMA.

**Martyrdom/Dead Man's Hands**

I know this is looked down upon but if you have been killed that many times trying to take a position you'd be pissed enough to consider this a reasonable streak to use. If it is gained by being sniped then it is totally useless and revenge may be more useful.

1330957414.0	qikjk	MW3: Help a grad student researcher w/a short survey about video game usability?	mrtypography	106	25	90	"Hey, MW3ers. I'm required to share a short survey with online communities interested in MW3. The goal is to get at least 50 people to submit info, which I'll then be analyzing. Not a lot of data, I know. Regardless, research data is research data is research data.

My idea is to skip every other online community. I think Reddit is perfectly sufficient to fulfill the goal of this survey. Even if I can't reach 50 submissions in /r/mw3, perhaps a few of you would be willing to spare ~1 min. lending a hand. A few submissions are better than no submissions, honestly.

For a bit of background: I'm a graduate researcher and have decided to study the usability of video games. It would have been far too easy to study the usability of websites or brooms or thermostats. I chose video games and felt MW3 was an excellent candidate for initial research.

*If you feel generous and would like to spare a bit of time to submit the survey, take note: you do not need to fill out your name, email, or phone number. That information is optional. If you decide to submit that data, it will be used for research purposes, then destroyed. That data is not required, though.* 

***Survey link removed, as survey has concluded***.

Thanks, everyone! You are all awesome.

----------------------------------------------
**Edit #1**: Wow! An excellent response! Thanks to all for the kind words and suggestions. Considering some of the feedback, I've adjusted the survey to be less intrusive. Personal information has been reduced to ZIP (optional, if US) and email (optional). Personal information gathering is NOT the purpose of this survey. As mentioned above, I'm interested in studying the usability of video games, not using personal information for malicious purposes. I truly hope these adjustments have helped assuage concerns about the legitimacy of this survey. One final note: this survey has full [IRB approval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) from my university. I felt it was relevant to mention this to help remove any fears from survey participants.

----------------------------------------------
**Edit #2**: Absolutely unreal. MW3 is incredible. Not only have you lot assisted in improving the survey, but we're past 50 responses already. As a worn-down graduate student, it will be a nice change to sift through data from survey participants the world over. I've no idea how far we'll go with the survey responses, but **I must thank everyone** who has taken the time to submit the survey. The more responses received, the more work I'll have in analyzing the results, but THAT'S OKAY. If the survey suddenly spikes in responses and ends up with hundreds of rows of usable data, I'll probably weep a bit (combo of fear &amp; happiness). Anyway - thanks everyone - locating willing survey participants isn't normally easy or fun.


----------------------------------------------
**Edit #3**: I wanted to provide a quick update while I have some time. According to the rows, ***230+ survey participants*** have submitted data. Submissions keep rolling in, too. I'm floored. [/r/mw3](/r/mw3) really knows how to help a fellow redditor out. Thank you to all who have participated, so far.


----------------------------------------------
**Edit #4**: This survey is a monster. MW3 is beautiful, in every single way. ***505 submissions and counting***. Survey results will be presented in a new post on Wednesday or Thursday! Everyone deserves to see the survey results. It should help paint a very interesting picture of the MW3 audience. Main thing is that it'll be necessary to divorce the emails and ZIPs from the survey results prior to sharing a public results page.


----------------------------------------------
**Edit #5**: About to hit the sack, but I wanted to provide an update. ***545 submissions and counting***. Too incredible. 

----------------------------------------------
**Edit #6**: Survey is closed. New post with survey results will be up later today! ***Final tally was 585 submissions.***"	t5_2rp9s	True

Perhaps this is already common knowledge, but I recently found out you can throw back your own grenades, and it will count towards the ""Hot Potato"" challenge.

I've found the easiest way to do this is on small maps, preferably in a game mode like Drop Zone, where the enemies will be concentrated around a single target. Just throw your grenade in a corner (don't cook it!), pick it up, then chuck it towards the drop zone.

Hope this helps anyone. If you've got a tip for getting another difficult challenge, please post it!

**edit**: You don't have to wait for the ""Press X to throw back!"" message to appear. You can pick it up much sooner. Try it for a bit, you'll get the hang of it soon enough.

1342186208.0	whxik	RE: Does a proficiency carry over ?	jgmcelwain	95	16	63	"A couple of days ago, JackCuff asked if proficiencies carried over when picking up someone else's weapon. Although people in the comments answered, the answers were either blatantly wrong (shotguns with range don't actually have increased range) or one word answers. I decided to do a little investigating in a Private Match:

Firstly, I had an MP7 and JackCuff had a Striker w/ Range - we found the maximum range, and then I killed him and picked up his Striker. We then went back to the maximum range and I attempted to shoot him - however, I couldn't get hitmarkers. After some further testing with other proficiencies on the Striker, we found that the range I could hit him out once I'd picked up his Striker was identical to that of a Striker w/o the Range proficiency. 

Next, we tested Breath and Stability - I had a Breath ACR and JackCuff had a Stability SCAR-L. He killed me and picked up my ACR and did not have the ability to hold breath - I did the opposite (picking up his SCAR-L) and it did not have the benefit of Stability - the gun still had a considerable amount of sway.

Penultimately, we tested Kick and Focus - I had a G36C with Kick and JackCuff had an ACR with Focus. I picked up his G36C and shot on a wall, and he did the same with his own G36C - the difference was noticeable, and it was clear Kick does not carry over. We did the same with Focus, except shooting eachother instead of a wall. It was clear that we flinched much less with our own Focus gun than with a picked up one.

Impact was the last proficiency - we tested how many bullets it took to kill me through the Dome with Impact on and Impact off, and then tried it with a picked up gun which had the Impact proficiency on its class - it took the same number of bullets as it did on the gun without the Impact proficiency with this picked up gun.

Finally, we tested Speed - we had a race, me with an M60 Speed, JackCuff with a naked MK46. I won the race (obviously), then he picked up my M60 and we had another race. If proficiencies carried over, then we would have tied, but I still won the race. 

**TL;DR Proficiencies don't carry over. Except attachments. Because it would be silly to not let attachments carry over.**"	t5_2rp9s	True

For science.


Switching to your secondary(if not a launcher) instead of reloading while in a fire fight.

Running away from fights where the enemy sees you first.

Burst firing

When moving around the map keeping your crosshairs in places where the enemy could be instead of looking down at the ground.

When surprised hipfire then ads. Goes well with the tip above

Playing an area of the map like you would If the entire map consisted of just that area.(Sounds weird but trust me it helps because you tend to expect more situations)

Waiting until 1 kill after you get a streak to call it in. A lot of times I used to get killed right after I got the predator because I was so excited to get it that I forgot that I just killed someone who probably wasn't alone.

If you're in one area of the map and none of your teammates are there. Back track after ever kill...just kinda going back and forth since most likely you're near their spawn and will get shot from behind.

Not really a situational skill but using every weapon in the game up to 500-1000 kills will teach you a TON of stuff. From route running, to using cover better, etc. Trust me it's amazing.

In addition playing without assassin or a silencer will teach you how players react with always knowing your position.

Certain map spots are death traps. For example I never go in the pipe on hardline or that one hallway on lockdown. Death traps.


*Edit: more thoughts

Certain game types will make you focus on different things and could make you better overall. 

FFA: How to handle not having someone watching your back

KC: I tend to have to react faster in KC games than other modes

GW: People are everywhere and will have at least one person to counter every strategy you try, can you adapt?

SND: Patience young grasshopper. You must learn it.

DOM: Game awareness, thinking strategically. This is a big one as your actions can change how the entire enemy team plays prevent them from getting the second flag first by knowing obvious tricks and the other team will switch to more desperate and hurried gameplay and either continue throwing more firepower at that flag or attempt to flank one of your other flags. Failing this they will resort to cheap tactics and camping for kills to get killstreaks. Also at this point people will start getting support streaks and the dynamic will change. That was just an example.

HC Mode: Learning to die less the hard way.

Also I learned how to do several things by focusing solely on that aspect for a few games. 

To learn to intuitively pick up weapons on a streak(it's a valuable skill to not use your gun til it's out of ammo) I ran recon with a rapid fire smg so I'd have to react quickly to not having ammo.

I took sleight of hand off on close quarters maps to teach myself reloading under cover.

I feel like there is no flow to the maps.  My play style has always been move fast/flank.  I look at the radar and move to where the enemies should be but it's just not right.  I constantly get pincered by spawns behind me.  Get killed from angles where there should not be enemies.  There are 100 paths and no predictably, and they're tiny constantly causing spawn shifts.  

There's a UAV in the air constantly, I only have one missile to take it down and scavenger doesn't refill it.  If I want to hide, I have to give up sprint.  

I tried slowing down but it's really not doing it for me. 

I'm not trying to complain.  I just can't get it.  I have no mojo.  I guess I just want to know if anyone else feels like this, I haven't seen many complaints that weren't just biased hate.  And if people have tips, happy to listen.

I was playing in a lobby overnight against a few vocal people who celebrated MW3 with beer and had gotten rather tanked.  In Seatown GW TDM, I ran around the corridors with a shotgun and after killing the same guy 2 times with the AA-12, he started screaming after each subsequent death.

By the matches end, I think I killed him a total of six times and I was having a blast hearing him scream about someone with a machine gun shotgun kept blowing him up before he could do anything.

I hope this isn't something that gets patched or fixed anytime soon.  I'm seriously loving this.  After that game, I did notice it in other maps and matches too.  This also was happening in Bakaara, the Village map, and one other map I cannot remember the name of.

 I'd like to start off saying, change your name. Do it right now, you're not MLG until you have either an ""x, ii"" or my personal favorite the ""xx."" The point of this is to make your gamertag stand out from others, if a kid sees you have a double vowel in your name they know that you're obviously MLG material.


STEP 2: 
Go to your Xbox Live Bio and change your whole Bio until it consists of stars and different characters from foreign languages. The point of this is to make anyone that reads your Bio have to squint to read what it says. This states you're too cool for letters and have to make your own. Now thats MLG status!


STEP 3: 
Scream about everything. If you're not loud you want to be noticed and the point of have MLG status is to be noticed. Practice this by entering pub matches and yelling about every death you get, be sure to scream, LAG! Or OMG, YOU HAVE HOST SCRUB! This lets everyone in the game know that you only died by luck not skill.


STEP 4: 
When you lose scream about how they use claymores and Throwing knifes. Tell them you're better because you rely on skill and not chance, even if you were out Type 95'd across Interchange. Also be sure to yell about 1v1s and smacking randys. Another good tip is to yell about their weapons for instance, you get sniped on Mission while you are using an Ump45. Be sure to tell the sniper that you're better and don't rely on one.

Usually I just ran around looking for equipment on the map to try and destroy it, but that took forever and I usually died in the process.

What you want to do is play Drop Zone, and use the following class:

 &gt; Primary: Shotgun (your choice)

 &gt; Secondary: Stinger/Javelin

 &gt; Lethal: C4

 &gt; Tactical: Trophy System

 &gt; Perk 1: Blind Eye

 &gt; Perk 2: Blast Shield

 &gt; Perk 3: Sitrep

 &gt; Deathstreak: Martyrdom

All you want to do is PTFO. Get to the drop zone and place your trophy system down and sit on the drop zone until you are killed, or the drop zone moves. 

I'll explain why:

Any grenade thrown towards the trophy system will count towards Sitrep Pro. C4 is a bit buggy, it sometimes gets destroyed, sometimes it doesn't. Protects you and your teammates killed and getting that awful annoying perk pro; double whammy. When you get killed, keep an eye out for motion sensors, tactical insertions and other trophy systems. Tac insertions are most common because of the ""1337 SniPzoRz"" that play that lobby going for montage feeds, need to be close by.

Now the easy question is why not EMP grenade. Well you can, but the trophy system has 2 charges per life whereas you only get 1 emp grenade per life. With blind eye, sentry guns and recon drones are redundant and can be taken out easy and you can knife/cancel all other tactical equipment so it's not necessary.

If you want, you can use QuickDraw Pro to deploy the trophy system quicker but you risk being killed by C4s, RPGs and other explosives.

I will also note, when the enemy got an IMS, I did become a martyr, ran in to knife it, for the destroy only to be killed by it. You don't have to, but I was dedicated in getting it.

1340050836.0	v8nwx	Questions Reddit asked BanCandy have been answered, part 1	Excellenze	78	8	156	"Hey Reddit!

* Is there any chance of changing the spawns for sabotage and other game modes?

-Our current focus is improving matchmaking and lag, but that is definitely on our list of things to look at once we can.

* Is there any chance of removing the quickdraw effect on sniper rifles and/or reduce the ability of quickscoping?

-Not in this game, but we can look at making improvements for our next title. It’s an interesting area in the discussion of gameplay as someone can just argue this is a legitimate play style (like camping). It totally sucks when you get killed by it, but it is easily countered. Would love to hear more opinions on this from the community.

* Will the shotguns, M16, MP5, PM-9 and Riot Shield get reworked and will some of these weapons receive a buff?

-We’re always looking into weapon improvement for those that aren’t getting much use. Can’t speak on specifics with these weapons but I know these are ones people would love to see receive buffs. We just buffed LMGs.


* Why do Frag grenades seem to roll towards players that are uphill?

-No logical explanation for that… If it does happen it is definitely a glitch. If you have a video I’ll take a look!

* Will there be an update on infected weapons and the equipment that's used?

-We are pushing for an update yes. Not sure how soon it’ll be as we’ve been all booked up with the Face Off mode recently.

* Are any maps from previous CoDs going to be introduced eventually?

-Hopefully, we want to do it but we have to get it ok’d by our publisher first.

* Will the AK74u or any other ""new"" gun be released soon?

-No new weapon DLC any time soon. This is something we want to look into though and if we can we’d like to do it as free content. Don’t know if we have to memory to support it now though.

* Will the dead silence/sitrep pro bug be fixed soon?

-Yes, already fixed on PS3 and will be included in the next updates for PC/360.

* Will the map glitches on Oasis and Foundation be fixed soon?

-Yes, fixes were updated for this last week. If you’re still seeing it let me know, also report offenders to the IW Enforcers.

* Any news on more lag compensation fixes/tweaks?

-We’re focusing on fixing this now, we’ll have an update soon which will give us an idea of what else needs to be tweaked in order to remedy this issue.

* Will a tweak to sleight of hand or quickdraw speed up the ability to reload/shoot again on the spaz or 1887?

-Sleight of hand would increase the speed but would affect all the weapons with that perk a change to the asset animation timing would be the better way to decrease reload time.

* Will DMH receive any form of a nerf?

-Yes, nerfed on PS3 in the 1.15 patch. Will be in the next updates for PC/Xbox.

* Any chance of a game mode designed for quick scopers only? FFA style game where they can vote on the map and rifle being used.

-We are toying with the idea of having a snipers only playlist. Would probably allow them to choose which rifle they want though.

* Will the pistols be switched up in AoN and/or One in the Chamber?

-I’ll find out if we can, I think we’re looking to update infected first. Are there a lot of people that want this?

* Will there be any penalty for players camping in 1 spot/area for longer than 10 seconds on OiC

-No plan for it, no. Is this an issue?

* Will there be a way to ""kill"" a guest account (and destroy the TI) that is blocking doorways on Infected?

-Unfortunately no, best option is to report that player to the IW Enforcers. 

* Will there be more support for Hardcore gametypes, ground war, infected, etc.?

-I want this yes! I love hardcore so I’m hoping we can fit in a HC ground war or HC Face Off.

* Will the ability to kill teammates equipment in Hardcore be removed? If not will the benefit of it counting toward Sitrep Pro be removed? 

-Nope, it’s called hardcore for a reason ;). I can find out about the counting toward challenge thing, but it is a risky script change.

* Will Ballistic Vests in Hardcore receive any kind of a nerf to balance out the effect it gives the player compared to Core? 

-No plan for that right now. Is it bad? I know it is annoying but does it really make the game unbalanced?

* Why do Hardcore players not have all the same Gameplay modes that Core players have? 

-Hardcore isn’t as popular. We’re looking to add more choices though.

* Will there be any updates to the Mercenary playlist, i.e. the removal of Domination or Ground War?

-Probably not, we like to have the variety available for all players. If you don’t see the mode you like in the lobby you can back out real quick and find a new one.

* Will there be an option to alert/ask you if you want to join a game that is about to end or sitting at a crazy score, i.e. TDM 6500-1200 

-Unfortunately don’t have the tech for this in MW3 but I know this is one of the features we really want in our next game.

* Will there be any improvements to being put in the same game/lobby 3+ times in a row or more after you back out of it or quit the game mid-match?

-Yes, we are making updates to matchmaking.

* Will unranked lobbies ever be introduced? Just to screw around in and not have your stats go down (or up)? Or at least just make infected, gun game, Aon, etc not count towards k/d or w/l and just use them to have fun on?

-It’s on my list of suggestions but this is one that is less desired by the majority of the community. We’ll see what happens.

* Can the riot-shield's hit detection be changed or modified somehow? This way when someone is shooting you, if you're looking at them the whole time, then they won't be able to shoot at you regardless. (I know that's completely different then how it works for every other weapon, but it's infuriating when someone can just run around you and you have no way to defend against it.)

-We can look into it yes, I’ve already submitted some suggestions for Riot Shield improvements so I’ll add this to it.

* Will it be possible to turn the aim-assist feature on and off?  Or at the very least, turn off the aim-assist feature when scoping in with sniper rifles, but then add it back in once they've actually scoped in. It'd have the effect of making quickscoping more difficult, but it'd make it easier to go up against them instead of facing what's effectively a shotgun at all ranges.

-An on/off option is often suggested. We’ll look into this for our next project.

* Is there any way/chance head glitching will be fixed?

-Probably not possible this game since it would require major changes to maps. This is something we can have QA do more passes on for our future titles.

* Will there be a fix for the auto-loss issue?

-Yep, no ETA right now but it will be coming soon.

* Is there any chance of removing noob tubes from hardcore? 

-Probably not, we’d end up having to remove all launchers. Plus, this is the only place they’re affective. Trolololol. Seriously though, we could look into setting up a Hardcore squared playlist that has hardcore rules but no explosives if this is something a lot of the community desires.

* Is it possible to remove death streaks from every game mode and stealth bombers removed from support killstreaks. 

-Sorry but no, these are a part of the game. We can look into nerfing ones that are too strong.

* Is it possible to sort out European lobbies from North/South lobbies, mixing them together gives certain players advantages.

-Yes we are working on an update for this; it’ll match regions to the party hosts too. If the party host is in Europe but the host is in US then they could still possibly match.

* Will the PC support be coming soon?

-We’ll have an update to PC very soon!"	t5_2rp9s	True
