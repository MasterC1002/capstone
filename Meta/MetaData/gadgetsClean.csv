1315295119.0	k67lx	Amazon's amazing customer service	standard_error	1306	410	211	"I won't frame this in a ""It's shit like this Amazon"" kind of way, nor will I post a funny comic about it. Call me dull. I just want to share a very positive experience I had with Amazon customer service. 

I spent this spring in the US, where I bought a Kindle DX (from Best Buy, not directly from Amazon). After moving back home to Sweden, the joystick stopped working, so I called Amazon customer service. After 5 minutes of waiting (when was the last time you got through to customer service that fast?), I got to talk to a customer service representative. Here I was expecting all kinds of trouble (warranty not valid outside US, having to ship the unit to the US to have it fixed, having to send it to a friend in the US and having them go to Best Buy with it etc). However, after less than 15 minutes on the phone, they put in an order for a brand new Kindle DX to be sent to me, in Sweden, with priority international shipping, no charge at all for me (they even pay the import fees, which are fairly high in Sweden!), leaving me very, very impressed!

I wanted to share this because I believe this level of customer service should be rewarded with positive word-of-mouth.

TL;DR: I bought a Kindle DX in the US, it broke in Sweden, Amazon will send me a new replacement free of charge, by priority international shipping. They even pay the import fees."	t5_2qgzt	True

I told him it had been bashed but no pressure on the screen or liquids. He said it didn't matter and is sending me a new one next week. They even provide free postage to return my broken Kindle.

There've been a lot of changes to my product/business/website recently, and I'd love your feedback!	robertgfthomas	793	176	198	"[Here's the original thread in /r/gadgets from 10 months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/saqvb/so_ive_invented_and_am_selling_fullsize_5/)

[Here's the crappy website to which it linked.](http://oldv1.rgft.net)

**[Here's the new less-crappy website!](http://www.thenoteboard.com)**

Within a week of that going up Noteboards were featured on TechCrunch, I'd gotten an offer from ThinkGeek, and I was scrambling to establish a legal business in order to not get in tax trouble, whereas the week before I was happily working a unrelated full-time HR job for a non-profit, expecting to maybe sell a few hundred Noteboards in a year, rather than a thousand in a week.

Last July, I was able to quit that full-time non-profit job and start doing Noteboards full-time. Since then, I've started selling them internationally, and have sold about 14,000 total. I'm still working all by myself from the basement of the house I rent with three other guys, and have learned a **lot** about business, taxes, patents, and all kinds of other crazy crap.

Now Noteboards have square-inch, square-cm, and hexagonal-inch grids on one side which makes them great for D&amp;D-type games — so just last weekend I went to a Con in southern Virginia to try selling Noteboards in-person for the first time.

Over the past few weeks I've completely overhauled the site (again). You can see the previous versions here:

* [Version 1](http://oldv1.rgft.net) -- the original, where this all began
* [Version 2](http://oldv2.rgft.net) -- not very different, but I was proud of the ""buttons"" on the side
* [Version 3](http://oldv3.rgft.net) -- tried pretending I was some legitimate business, instead of just a 23-year-old in his basement
* [Version 4](http://oldv4.rgft.net) -- a more Noteboard-focused version. I really like bright colors.
* [Today!](http://www.thenoteboard.com)

**ALSO**, now I'm donating a Noteboard to a good cause for every order I receive through TheNoteboard.com, which is what I really wanted to do from the start but couldn't afford till now. I've got 4 recipients so far ([you can see them here on the order form](http://www.thenoteboard.com/buy.php)), and hope there'll be more -- suggestions welcome!

I'm posting here again in case anyone has questions about Noteboards, or the experience of creating a business by the seat of the pants, or anything else. I'd also love some tips on how to draw attention to the new charitable-giving component. As an education wonk, I'd really really really like to see Noteboards going to schools and education programs, but I still can't afford to just give a bunch away.

TL;DR /r/gadgets got me a full-time job, and I'm extremely grateful.

EDIT: Massdrop's doing a deal where they're selling Noteboards for cheap! It used to be the main Tweet on the front page of my site, but I replaced it with the Tweet about sending Noteboards to charity. The deal's active for another 18 hours:

[DealExtreme](http://www.dealextreme.com/products.dx/top.sellers~r.66422016) - Has around thirty thousand articles. Has been around for a long time. Home of the infamous 78 cent [pig light](http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.1138~r.66422016).

[Focalprice](http://www.focalprice.com) - Also quite huge. Big competitor of DX. Also has the pig light for 78 cents. Mostly the same stuff that DX has, but there are differences. Ten thousand articles.

[Tinydeal](http://www.tinydeal.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;sk=1267084484YV) - Fairly new player, also sells on eBay. Has some hard to get stuff that the others aren't selling, like pepper sprays and electric shock pistols. Very generous bonus system, and the lowest prices I've found outside of eBay. Also has a nice assortment of Chinese cellphones.

[Kaidomain](http://www.kaidomain.com) - Started by old DX employees. Has a very wide range of flashlights and parts. Has used the Christmas theme since the Christmas of two years ago.

[Pandawill](http://www.pandawill.com) - Haven't tried yet.

[ePathChina](http://www.epathchina.com) - Haven't tried yet. Not everything has free shipping.

[AliExpress](http://www.aliexpress.com) - Simpler version of Alibaba.com, a global trading site. Has a search option to find things with free shipping. You can find real bargains here, but the site is very messy and the search function isn't very good.

[eBay](http://www.ebay.com) - Almost always has the lowest prices for simple things like cables and cellphone accessories. Just remember to search for items that are available to where you live (this gives you search results from eBay global and not only ebay.com).

EDIT: Some additions:

[Mertiline](http://www.meritline.com) - Haven't tried yet, but others seem to like it.

[BuyinCoins](http://www.buyincoins.com) - Haven't tried yet.

EDIT 2: Yay, first page! Some more additions:

[NDSCardsale](http://www.ndscardsale.com/~r.1288857858U28095) - Haven't tried it myself, but they have gotten good reviews by others. Has flashcarts for Nintendo DS, USB dongles for PS3 and other video game accessories.

[DinoDirect](http://www.dinodirect.com/?midd=10273) - Haven't tried it myself. Some good reviews, some bad. Wide selection.

[Brando](http://www.brando.com/) - Haven't tried it myself. Site looks pretty shitty, but they have some nice things.

[GoldenGadgets](https://www.goldengadgets.com) - Nice selection of flashlights and solar power gadgets and equipment.

EDIT 3: Found this one today:

[Pokydady](http://pokydady.com) - Wide assortment of pens and other stationery.

Be weary of shady employees!	ilovethatyouretoxic	755	270	329	"My wife went to the local Verizon store to buy two iPhones (not even on her line, they were gifts for two members of our family) and had quite the experience. She isn't particularly up to date on technology news, but she just went in to pick up the phones and pay so I had no worries. However, in the store, the employee informed her that because she was purchasing a new smart phone, all of the people on our plan had to get rid of unlimited data and switch to pooled data. 4 of the 6 people on our plan *had* unlimited data.
     The employee told her, ""All unlimited data will be gone in June anyways, but it will be easier for you to do it now and pool your data."" Bless her heart, she caved in and now we have 8 people sharing 10GB/month.
     I myself would power through a solid 8-10gb a month. Now I am stuck at just over 2GB (assuming everyone shares equally).

BE WARNED! 

Verizon employees have been manipulative ever since the first time I dealt with them. This is the cherry on top. We are switching as soon as possible. 

I don't know the validity of his statement about eliminating all unlimited data in June, but regardless, Verizon is shady. Be vigilant.

Story:
Dailysteals.com is one of those deal-of-the-day websites.  I found a link, I think on here, to a set of 5.1 Logitech speakers for $40 (something like 70% off), score! Not so much.

I never received a shipping notice, so a week later I sent them an e-mail.  The following Monday they got back to me saying the package was delivered, but waiting at the local post-office, pinned the blame on UPS (probably accurate).  I live in a city though, we have many local post offices, and, despite inquiries, both DailySteals and UPS were useless in pointing me in the right direction.

On my second attempt, I found the correct post office to discover they had simply slapped a shipping label on the product box and some extra packing tape and sent it through.  The box was beat to all hell, but I took it home and opened it up.  All the serial numbers were blacked out, and the subwoofer was already blown.  You gotta be kidding me.

I sent them another email, and again, no response til the following Monday.  They gave me an RMA and offered I ship it back for a refund on my own dime.  Fuck that, I'm not paying more to send this back with the hopes that they might follow through and pay me back at some point.

I told them they could do better, and that as they only respond to customer complaints on Mondays, I'd wait a week.  That was a week and a half ago, with no response yet.  I think it's safe to say I won't be getting one.

So, end of the day, I don't expect to solve this problem, but would see to it that no one else gets screwed over by this company.

TLDR: Dailysteals.com provides shit product with shit customer service.

***AVOID ""http://www.suntekstore.com/""   as they are a scam operation. ***

I ordered an ipad 1 battery case, they sent me this http://i.imgur.com/U2hFo.jpg  and then they wanted ME to pay THEM more money because it was a product i didn't order.  That's right, they screwed up and didn't want me to send the item back but did want me to now BUY the item, the item i didn't order. 

So i asked them about the item i did order, the ipad 1 battery case. they tell me they can't send any further items until i pay something which apparently [after a number of back and forth emails] at a minimum is the ""restocking fee"" of $2 USD. Looking at the fact that it would cost more than $2 USD to send the item from Australia to Hong Kong and i am already $40 invested in this i figured the $2 was worth to just get the actual item sent. So far i am now thinking i am only out an extra $2 as i was expecting the actual item i ordered to be coming soon. 

So i wait another 10 days and get another item in the post. Straight away without even opening the product i notice something is wrong, the item is very Light. that is to say the product was so light that it was like a few DVDs in weight.  I get inside and open the second package, it was this: http://i.imgur.com/Do4KF.jpg  at least this time the item *looked* like product i ordered.  First and foremost i checked to see if my ipad 1 would fit (i know the box says 2 &amp; 3 but i was still hoopeful) - the ipad 1 does not fit, not even close.  But it is not a real item, the case itself has very little weight and appears to be mostly plastic, in fact i was guessing that there was no electronic parts inside but there is *something*. There was a USB plug down the bottom of the case that was seemingly just super glued and Jammed inside, http://i.imgur.com/PAt9x.jpg  i plugged it into a USB socket and starting charging which did prove that it must have had some small battery inside that can hold some power and turn on the LED lights down the bottom. However after being on charge for over 3 hours the ""battery case"" only shows 75% charged and i have found that the whole thing will go flat (according to the LED lights anyway) in less than an hour, it doesn't hold charge and i doubt it would ever provide power to an ipad for more than 5 minutes. 

I have been back and forth with many emails to this ""company"" and they have offered a partial refund of $5 USD - after paying $40 plus another $2 after the first wrong item for the restocking fee i would be losing pretty much all of it as the cost of $5 could be written off in the amount of time i have wasted with this educational venture. I have already opened the paypal dispute but paypal had a terrible track record with scams like this and in the past i have even had them ask for the item to be returned to the seller as per the official refund policy of the ""store"", which actually ended up costing me money overall.  So even if the paypal thing goes good or bad i will be losing money no matter what, just to break even would be a long shot.  I just hope that no one else gets scammed by these scamming scammers from scamville. 

TLDR: suntekstore.com is a scam and just send fake products to get money. 

***Update***
well it seems the company has found this post and are now trying to bribe me into taking down the post. 

&gt;Thanks a lot for your reply. Yes, we can issue full refund to you. But since your comment is very important to our business. Could you please change your feedback on http://bit.ly/O3qjMx first?
If you have done, please let us know, we will fully refund to you asap. Thank you for your help in advance. 


so they are now saying that i can get a full refund where as previously they were only offering $5 or $8. interesting, their horrible conduct and attempt at bribery is shameful at best.  I can only guess how many other people have taken the money and deleted their bad reviews. 

Also, I am still waiting to hear from paypal about it. so far the only email sent from paypal was stating that the seller has provided shipping information... i'm not quite sure what that means, i have received 2 items and neither is the one that was meant to be sent in the first place, and i never received any tracking information before hand.

**UPDATE 2**

WIN! - well it seems something actually went right here as i just got an email from paypal saying that i have received a full refund. 

&gt;We have concluded our investigation into your Buyer Claim

even though i am still out the $2 restocking fee as that wasn't part of the ""initial purchase"", and aside from the 2 months of time wasted trying to just order 1 single item, which resulted in 22 emails from the ""company"".

I bought a G9x mouse quite a while ago and used it for a good long while. It began having issues. I eventually figured out that it works perfectly on wood, but it fails on a mouse pad. 

I wrote to them asking if it's a setting or something and asking for instructions on how to fix it.

They sent me a new mouse, free of charge. Remember, this is a $60-70 mouse.

A year or so later - I notice that the replacement mouse is starting to have issues with the scroll wheel. Finally, the wheel just completely detaches. I send an email asking for advice on opening and fixing the problem. 

My new mouse is in the mail.

Even before my mouse issues, I've nearly always bought Logitech because my experiences with them have always been good and their equipment has always been fantastic. I've seldom had to deal with their customer service because their stuff generally doesn't screw up for me.

When I finally get faulty equipment, they prove that their customer service is amazing. I'm not happy, or course, that I had to use their customer service, but their response makes me love them even more.

I may be sounding like a fan-boy, but when a company goes this far out of their way to make my experience perfect, they deserve it.

1325790468.0	o4a7g	Why you should avoid Sony Vaio computers. Or, my adventures in Sony Support hell.	LovableContrarian	458	189	117	"A few years ago, I bought a sony laptop: model VGN-AR750e. I paid $1,800, which seems steep in today’s market, but at the time it was a decent price for a gaming/media laptop.  Also, Sony was pushing the blu-ray format so they essentially threw a free bluray drive in there despite being a laptop similarly priced to other brands.

Very quickly, though, it was apparent there were design flaws, largely with the hinge system.  The hinges themselves began to “creek,” and the cables for the speakers ran through the hinges.  After about a month, the right speaker cable was cut by the malfunctioning hinge and stopped working.  Secondly, a mysterious internal “beep” began randomly sounding off every now and again. I am no computer science major, but I do know more about computers than the average person.  The beep was a system beep.  This beep was coming from the motherboard, HD, CD-rom drive, or some other internal component (not the speakers). It beeped randomly - sometimes when I was gaming or video editing, but other times when the system was idling.  This wasn't a code-beep either. It wasn’t a sequence of tones to give me a message, it was just this awful noise.

I called up customer service.  While this was not a particularly painless process (talked to multiple people), they did eventually inform me that my local sony store had a support center.  I drove an hour to get to the sony store, only for them to tell me that they couldn’t do a damn thing.  They did nonsense crap like virus scans and basic software troubleshooting, but they wouldn’t touch any hardware issues.  After countless hours on the phone with customer service, they finally agreed to send someone to my house to fix the beep and speakers. I was actually pretty happy that they would send someone to me.

The technician came as scheduled. He fixed the speaker.  When I asked about the beep he basically blew me off and gave me some short answer like, ""I don't know about that, they didn’t tell me anything like that.  A beep, though?...  I wouldn't worry about it.""

Whatever. I was so annoyed with the ordeal that I accepted my repaired speaker and moved on.  The speaker worked, but the beep persisted.  However, the computer didn't seem to have any real issues beyond the physical beeping, so I listened to his advice: I ignored the beep.  It wasn't unbearable, and so as long as it wasn't a serious problem, I could live with it.

Fast-forward a few weeks.  The beeping still persisted, but I also noticed my screen-latch -- the little hook that swoops up to lock my screen in the closed position -- wouldn't latch. It took me a while to notice because I used the laptop as a desktop and rarely closed it and took it with me. After some examination, I found the problem. The flip-up lock wouldn’t latch because it was off-position. The whole screen  was slightly… shifted.  I examined the computer to try to figure out why this happened, and it ultimately led me to the left hinge.  Yes, the same hinge the technician worked on to replace the speaker a few weeks previous.  I don't know what exactly he did, but trust me when I say he further screwed up the already malfunctioning hinges.

When he closed the LCD back up after replacing the speaker, he literally closed a foam seal INTO the computer.  So, you can see this little strip of foam GOUGED into the seal of the computer, which basically forced an opening behind the laptop screen.  This created a whole series of problem with this side of the computer. The top of the computer shifted, and the whole hinge area was completely contorted.  He also neglected to replace a screw is on the bottom of the computer that holds everything together.  As a result of the gap he created, dust made its way UNDER the LCD screen where it can't be cleaned or removed. A month later, the hinge snapped. I’m not going to bore you with the details, but let me just say this: Sony’s warranty centers are based outside of the U.S., they were completely unhelpful when I tried to explain that THEIR TECHNICIAN broke my computer further.  I tried relentlessly for months, and I COULD NOT find a number for anyone higher up or get a transfer. 

But, this calls to a bigger issue.  This laptop model is a lemon, and Sony knew damn well.  It was marketed as Sony’s big Bluray-launch laptop, and within 3 months, it was completely off the shelves and replaced by their FZ series.  The whole thing was swept under the rug.  I am no conspiracy theorist, but it’s obvious that they were aware of this and just tried to temporarily appease all of us poor souls who bought the $2,000 laptop until our warranties ran out.  I can see a board room somewhere with executives deciding that it was cheaper to lose us as customers than to help us, since it was such a short-lived product with barely any purchasers.

This is evidenced by the terrible support I received later. About a year after I bought the laptop, Windows 7 was released.  It’s pretty normal for a company to back-support any model released within two years prior and release new drivers for the new operating system.  All other companies did this. Toshiba, Asus, HP, Dell, and EVERYONE released windows 7 drivers for models that were two years older or less.  My laptop was only a year old, but nothing. Amazingly (and disgustingly), sony released windows 7 drivers for laptops OLDER than mine, but not mine. More evidence that they were trying to pretend they never released this lemon of a laptop.   I installed Windows 7 and finagled the HELL out of it to get it up and running, but I couldn’t get it to work fully.  Without the release of new drivers, I couldn’t get any of the shortcut buttons to work and my webcam wouldn’t work at all.  On a laptop, this is annoying.  No skype or anything.  If I needed to change the volume or brightness, I had to do it manually through windows.  I figured there HAD to be a way around it, but I found VERY educated people online with similar problems, and none of them could find a work around. 

I found that sony would offer 15 minutes of free chat support, so I gave it one last shot.  I knew the time was limited, so I quickly explained my problems in about 30 seconds.  The technician wasted the 15 minutes talking nonsense… I actually saved the last portion of the chat session:

Me: Are there no windows 7 drivers available?  I downloaded the notebook utilities but it doesnt seem to be compatible. However, I am mostly worried about the camera.  I can live without the shortcut buttons functioning. 

Technician: LovableContrarian, I can resolve the web cam issue completely. However, I can also provide alternate solution for the brightness keys, but the av MODE BUTTON WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED.

Me: Okay, great!  

Me: Can you explain what you are going to do, so I know what I did wrong for the future?  I installed the webcam driver from sony support, but it didnt work.

Technician: Sure, I can fix this issue for you if you sign up for any one of our Service plans, even though your system is out of warranty and you are past the FREE 15 minute support period that we have offered.

Me: Well can you just tell me how to fix it really quick? I feel like nothing was really done in the 15 minute time period.  I have no problem doing the workaround myself…  Is there an online link explaining it?

Technician: LovableContrarian, I will resolve the issue completely once you signup for any of our service plans. However, you can pay just $24.99 to get the web cam issue resolved.

Me: No thank you, I will figure it out on my own.  Thanks anyway.

It was a complete bait and switch.  Again, I was only trying to get help on a laptop that I paid $1,800 for, and I was asking for something they should have offered to EVERYONE for FREE.  I was asking for driver support for a year-old laptop, and they want every individual to pay $25 for some guy to give it to you. To this day, there has been no public fix for the webcam or buttons, and they are still non-functioning.

Here I am with a $1,800 laptop with no webcam, no shortcut buttons, and a hinge I had to replace myself.  There is an insane amount of dust under the screen and it continues to get worse.  And, still, something internal randomly beeps at me.  It feels like I bought a $1,800 problem.  I’ve wasted HUNDREDS of hours talking to customer service, looking through forums for solutions, trying drivers, and every other headache that came along.  Despite buying their premiere laptop that was one of the most expensive they offered, I’ve been treated as a second-class customer that needs to leave them alone. When they finally sent one person to help, he created more problems that Sony refuses to accept.

And, I am not alone. These stories are all over the place online.  And, it isn’t even just my model.  Hell, even if you have a working Sony laptop, their driver support is awful. Unless you get a hacked driver, you will be using an old nvidia driver because they only update them once a year (if that). Sony is the ONLY producer with this lack of support for video drivers. And, they only put a small portion of their bundled driver/software on their support site, so if you ever reformat, you lose programs and functionality. This is all from Sony, by the way, which is probably the most expensive windows PC manufacturer around.

I’m certainly not asking for upvotes here, but I did everything I could to make Sony aware that I was getting screwed.  No one cared. I tried to email this to someone important, but Sony will literally ONLY direct you to their foreign support services.  I think a little negative publicity would go a long way.  If you actually made it this far, I thank you for listening, and I advise you to avoid Sony’s Vaio division like the plague."	t5_2qgzt	True

I'm just wondering if that's the consensus.  It's about $200 now, which I can afford, and I'm wondering how similar to reading a book it really looks.

I kind of hate that dull glow from LCD screens (on some existential level) but it looks like there's not much background glow from this.  Does it hurt anyone's eyes?

She's also been catching and releasing them after getting them spayed/neutered. She's been doing this for years. The other day she found a can of cat food with emptied extra strength tylenol capsules around it. She found one dead kitten that she believes died from poisoning.

She wants to get some sort of spy camera set up to catch the perpetrator in the act if they return. The spot is in an alley and she won't have access to power. Ideally, she'd like an inexpensive camera that can be easily hidden, runs on battery power and activates via motion detection. She doesn't have a lot of money, but she really wants to catch whoever is doing this. Anyone have any suggestions?"	t5_2qgzt	True

EDIT:
Really appreciate the comments guys. If you're feeling generous give me a like on Facebook. Just set up the FB account and need to raise awareness. 


EDIT2: Guys I have had some really great feed back and really appreciate it. The general consensus is if I want to hit retail stores in the US the price need to come down. Also we need to rename the 'Mates' to 'Buddies' or similar. Yes we are based in Australia like most of you worked out. I was not intending for this to be a sales tool, but if people do decide they would like a pair message me and I will set up a discount coupon. Cheers for the support guys.

EDIT3: I have shuffled the order of slides based on the feed back from you guys. I hope this helps engage users more when they hit our landing page.
