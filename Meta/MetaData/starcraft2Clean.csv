The real Starcraft discussion happens at /r/starcraft, where there are ten times the number of subscribers than here. This subreddit only fractures the community and makes it harder for new people to find where the real discussion happens. I think we should get rid of this subreddit altogether so that people can join for discussion in one place.

Like, most of you have probably been watching the fiasco in /r/starcraft unfold. In case you missed it, the [most recent post from the moderation team](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/hh5eb/screddit_we_need_to_talk_nao_put_down_your/) does not look good. The official position of Shade and the next most senior mod is this: *You are all taking this way too far. You want shade to leave, but I'm here to tell you he's staying.*

Before we continue, I'd like to remind you all of a few things:

*  /r/starcraft **is a good thing**. It's an amazing community, one that many senior members of TeamLiquid have commented on, saying that /r/starcraft is like the good old days of TL.
* /r/starcraft **has recognition**. Getting invited to a Heart of the Swarm Press event? Enough said.
* /r/starcraft **is worth saving**. A lot of work has gone into this community. Hell, I've been with it since beta and I got my beta key from a community member. We need to keep this thing around. It takes a lot of work to reproduce it elsewhere. 

So where do we go from here? Things don't look good with the moderation staff, but I think we can still take /r/starcraft back. Here is what I propose: 

* Let's **work to foster an awesome community here**. The sidebar needs to be updated, and we need to continue business as usual for Reddit's Starcraft players.
* Let's **actively work to get people to switch over to /r/starcraft2**. This should be done respectfully through PM and commenting. No spam. The purpose of this is to show the Starcraft users of Reddit have a voice.
* Most importantly, let's **continue a campaign to get Shade removed as moderator**. The ultimate goal should be to switch back to /r/starcraft, so we need to get the moderation staff cleaned up.

This process will take time and it will take effort to get what we want. But /r/starcraft is worth saving."	t5_2qspc	True

Welcome to our subreddit - as you can see it's a bit of a work in progress, but we're currently planning a whole lot of changes that will hopefully get things ticking along nicely. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please make them in the comments. We'll be adding sidebar information soon.

The main goal of this subreddit is to give people a place they can discuss all things Starcraft 2 related. The current, hugely popular subreddit (/r/starcraft) is going through a phase we're they're preventing all link posts. There's also a pretty strong community attitude that the subreddit is for serious discussion, not jokes and memes.

This isn't a subreddit dedicated to memes, and it's not a subreddit dedicated to theory. It's dedicated to Starcraft 2, and you can post whatever you want. We're letting the democratic upvote / downvote system decide what's appropriate, and the mods are here to deal with the occasional instances of link spam (instead of just banning all links).

In keeping with that system of democracy - ""corvette"" set this Reddit up and has made me a mod just so I can get stuff organised. Once it's looking nice and there are a few more posts, I will happily step down from this mod position and whoever the community votes in can help to moderate the subreddit.

Anyway - welcome! Post some discussions, post some links and have some fun.

The post on TL:

There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just going to say it.

After having him on our roster for nearly three years, we have decided to release IdrA from the Evil Geniuses StarCraft 2 team. 

To state the obvious, this was a very difficult decision for us. Over the past several years, we as an organization have grown close to Greg, and we have developed a deep appreciation and respect for him as a person. We consider him a member of our family, and parting ways with him leaves us all with a very heavy feeling in our stomachs.

We have built our company as a players-first organization. This is reflected in a number of already well-known benefits that our players receive, such as the attentiveness of our management, the quality of our on-site facilities, and excellent financial support. And while these are all vital parts of taking a players-first approach, we believe that one of the most important ways to support professional gamers is to stay out of their way. 

As most of you are already aware, we let our players be themselves. We believe that our industry's diverse assortment of vibrant personalities plays a huge part in helping make eSports so much fun - for ourselves, and for the viewers. No great novel is without great characters, and we like to let our players find their own roles within the eSports storyline by showcasing the personalities they were born with. We have strict guidelines that regulate certain kinds of more extreme speech, and we take disciplinary action when those guidelines are violated, but for the most part, we stay out of the way. 

This is why it was never really an issue for us that Greg can be rude to his opponents in games, or that he usually speaks his mind very bluntly and directly. But, to us, there's a very big difference between a player being disrespectful to an opponent in a ladder match, and a player being disrespectful to the entire community of people who, via their own enthusiasm and passion for the entertainment product he creates, actually make his profession possible.

The eSports industry, and companies like Evil Geniuses, would not be possible without the passion and support of our community. We, as a company, cannot and will not be supportive of anyone who does not show due respect and appreciation for the community that makes everything we do possible.

Thank you for your time, and (hopefully) your continued support of our team.

Sincerely,

Alexander Garfield
CEO, Evil Geniuses

Sorry for my bad english. I am from Brazil and I am 22y old. I grew in the suburb of São Paulo which is a great city (but expensive). I am from a modest family and I did everything I could to support them while studying. Many of my friends were playing football or were doing bad things while I was at the library.  

I did not enjoy this part of my life cause it was so hard to work, to study and to grew with my friends.     

But I won a prize in a mathematics challenge which basically helped me to go to Paris to study more.    

This is a beautiful city but it's kinda weird for a poor foreigner like me. Everything is expensive and people mocked of how I try to talk. Hopefully the family with which I live help me to be a part of the city.
  
Some months ago I discovered Starcraft 2 and I made some friends. The good part is they are from Paris and I eventually hooked up with them. Now my two french best friends left France for their studies and I stopped Starcraft 2 to focus on my exam.
  
I have just discovered we can now play Starcraft 2 with anyone in the world and I can't wait to find any job to get Heart Of The Swarm to get some new friends. I am watching all the tournaments and top player stream and I can tell this game must be so funny to play.
  
Thanks to Blizzard for the UI rework (it is more social).  

**TLDR : I am from a poor family and hard work + SC2 helped me to focus on a right life. SC2 community is awesome because anyone can be a part of it. So please, think about all the people who cannot play this game you got the chance to own before flamming or making some bad assumptions.**"	t5_2qspc	True

I am starting StarCraft 2 this weekend and wanted a cheat sheet for while I play the game on what unit is strong/weak against what. I know most of you probably have this stuff memorized but I don't. Maybe this will help others too. I just copied and pasted all the images from the starcraft website into one image. For whatever team you play just have that sheet open during the game or printed out. I know the metagame is way more complex than this but this will give me a good start. Hope it helps.

Basically you upload your .SC2Replay files and I'll convert them into web replays.  My twist is I make recordings from 2 players perspectives and show em both to you on the same page (sync'd of course).

I have some other options as well, but I'm really looking for feedback on what things people do not like and what things you think would be cool.

As a side note - my goal for this was to produce something that would scale decently with almost no $ investment (just my time).  Have this running on 1 ec2 micro, static pages and assets (js,css,img) being served up by github pages.  Dynamic pages are being served directly from memcached via nginx module (pages are stored already gzipped).  I know here is probably not the forum, but if anyone is interested in the implementation details I'd be willing to share cuz I think some of concepts I came up with could help others looking to bootstrap their webapp.

Thanks in advance. First Reddit post so go easy on me.

oh and ps - I also have a mobile version so you can watch it on your phone. http://m.ggreplayz.com . Let me know what you think of that as well."	t5_2qspc	True

I am looking for casters, producers, and admins from 7 of 8 distinct regions in North America (the north east is taken care of). these jobs related to a regional semi-pro league that is talked about on [this TL.net thread](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=290439).


So if you have wanted to work in the e-Sports scene for a while, whether you're in high school or old as dirt, shoot me a PM(or email Drogith at nesc2league.com) and we can see if you have the moxy!


**Caster**

There are 2 caster positions open for each region. Each caster will have a specific role aside from technical/color and play-by-play commentary. One caster will be responsible for the product placements when required, while the other caster will be the one actually streaming and switching to the appropriate overlays when needed.


**Admin**

There is 1 admin position open for each region. The admin is there to make sure everything is running smoothly behind the scenes. He/she will be the liason between the players and the producer, as well as the one coordinating with the players to know who is playing who, bracket updates, and keep in touch with the stream chat.


**Producer**

There is 1 producer position open for each region. The producer is responsible for keeping the show running on the surface. That includes queing the casters to announce commercial breaks, running commercials off the stream, inform the casters of next matches, approx time til matches, product placement at times, etc.. The producer will also be the one making the final call on matches streamed and rule rulings.


**The regions are as follows:**

**Northwest Mountain-** *caster/caster/admin/producer*

Alaska, Yukon, Alberta, Northwest Territory, British Columbia


**Quebec and Maritimes-** *caster/caster/admin/producer*

Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., Newfoundland, Labrador


**Ontario-** *caster/caster/admin/producer*

Ontario


**Northern Prairies-** *caster/caster/admin/producer*

Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nunavet


**US West-** *caster/admin/producer*

Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico


**US Midwest-** *caster/caster/admin/producer*

North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio


**US South-** *caster/caster/admin/producer*

Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Washington D.C.


**US Northeast-** *all positions full*

Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey


**2 things you should know.**

1. This is a great opportunity as a stepping stone into the world of e-Sports on the non-playing side of things.

2. Depending on the number of sponsors, these may be paying jobs by either product, or actual money. *NZXT, CoolerMaster, Kingston*"	t5_2qspc	True

So here it is: Tuesdays are the days that Blizzard loves to fix/break/release things. Whether they announce something or not, Tuesday mornings and sometimes afternoons just expect B.net to not be up.

1310346204.0	ilzsn	How does one improve mechanics?	blink00	36	15	48	"This post is inspired by Destiny and other skilled players' insistence on focusing on **mechanics** pre-platinum.

Also, this is less *me* talking and more a compilation of what I've watched, read, seen from all sources, including redditors and TeamLiquid.

**What does *mechanics* mean?** My opinion:

**Macro**

* Use hotkeys.
* Use control groups.
* Never float resources. (Always spend your resources as much as you     
   can. When you have extra resources, it needs a purpose. For
   example, when you're saving 400 min for a Nexus.)
* Build enough gatherers. (2-3 per mineral patch, three per gas)
* Build enough supply so as to *never* get supply capped.
* Constantly build units.
* Expand when you saturate a base.
* Always spawn larvae/spread creep/use chronoboost/mules, etc.
* Invest in upgrades. (Thanks Schamus)
* Map control and awareness. (Gold/Platinum and up.)
* Scouting and game sense. (Platinum and up.)
* Build orders, strategy, decision making. (Platinum and up.)

**Micro**

* Minimize unnecessary clicking and use mouse accurately.
* Be able to macro while controlling units.
* Effective movement of units. (Gold/Platinum and up.) (Thanks Doof07)
* Effective use of unit abilities. (Gold/Platinum and up.)
* Army positioning during battles. (Platinum and up.)
* Try to keep your units busy. (Platinum and up.) (Jasminbulle)

--------------------

So, here's the million dollar question: **How does a player improve in any of these areas?** The quick answer is, pick one of these bullet points, preferably starting with the top of the ""Macro"" list, and just focus on *that one aspect* for maybe 5 games against a computer, then 20 or more games. The desire to win sometimes gets in the way of a new skill, which is essentially your ego talking. If you can put your ego aside, you'll really improve.

I go into detail about improving each aspect in the following paragraphs.

A couple things first:

Macro is more important than Micro. The first two bullets under micro ought to be learned as you are learning the first few bullets of macro.

I may be missing some items, but I think I've covered the most important. 

**Macro**

**First:** Find one SIMPLE build and just do that. Use that build as the basis for learning the fundamentals. Also, only work on one fundamental at a time.

**Hotkeys:** Play many games against the computer where *all you're trying to do* is to use hotkeys. 

Switch to the grid system if you can. It's under the hotkey options. Grid keeps all the hotkeys in a neat place on one side of your keyboard. Once you feel you are never clicking to build units, research upgrades, or use abilities, you're good.

You can use the spacebar to quickly move to the most recent alert - like a battle. You may have to rebind this. (Thanks, confuzD) 

**Control Groups:** Play five games adding *just one* control group. Then add another.

You make a control group by selecting a unit/building or group of units/buildings, then press CTRL + any #.

How you organize your groups is really up to you, but here's one way:

* 1-3 Important buildings.
* 4-6 Important fighting units.
* 7-0 Builders, scouts, misc.

If you are using Grid, you can rebind 789 to more convenient keys and 0 to the tilda ` key. This change makes 7-0 more accessible. Thanks to derekg1000 for the 0 to tilda tip.

You can use shift + # to add to control groups. You can use control + click on unit icon to select all of one unit. Thanks, dmead.

You can use Tab to cycle through buildings or units in one control group. For example, I bind Forges, Cybercore, and other upgrade buildings to 3. By pressing tab, I can cycle between the different buildings.

**Never float resources/build enough miners/build enough supply/constantly build units:** Play twenty games where your only focus is to take care of one of these.

Watch your replays, but *only* look at your resources/miner production/supply production/unit production. When you see several games in a row where your resources constantly stayed low (even during battles)/you constantly produced miners/you never got supply blocked/you constantly were producing units, you have mastered this aspect.

**Note on gatherers: According to this [graph linked by Artha_SC](http://i.imgur.com/sw8lw.png), two gatherers per mineral patch is optimal, for a total of 16 gatherers on minerals. More than that and you get diminishing returns. Thus, it is best to expand as you approach 16 gatherers on minerals, but if you have more, it's decent. Definitely don't go over 24 gatherers on minerals (3 per patch), though, as the extra gains are severely decreased.

(Thanks, LOUD-DUCK, Artha_SC, Eirhead, and Clbull.)

So, when you transfer workers to your new expo, transfer half. This way, you can produce an equal amount of workers from both bases and get to saturation (16 workers) or full saturation (24 workers) faster. (Thanks, saranagati)

**Map Control:** Use units/structures to give yourself vision of key map areas. For example, Zerg can use any combination of overlords, overseers, zerglings, creep tumors, and Xel'Naga Towers to see what's going on. **Watch the mini-map at all times.**

--------------------

**Micro**

**Minimize unnecessary clicking and use the mouse accurately:** When you move a unit somewhere, click exactly where you want that unit to go. You don't need to click several times to zero-in on where you want the unit to be.

You can practice by clicking your control group for the Nexus/Hive/CC, then clicking on a gatherer, then on a specific mineral patch. Start slowly, then speed up. This will improve accuracy and will help with overall micro. (Tip from Day9.)

**Effective movement of units and use of unit abilities:** Find a unit test map and look up YouTube videos on micro for different units of your race. Get gold in some of the Challenge Missions that come with the game. They teach a lot of micro and unit positioning.

**Macro while moving units:** On a build order test map, practice macroing up while keeping a probe alive against an enemy zergling. Other similar exercises can help with specific abilities - say blinking while macro'ing, etc.

**Army positioning:** Get Gold in some of the Challenge Missions. Look up videos on YouTube. Watch the battles of important games.

**Keep units busy:** Kill rocks to gold, defend the Xel'Naga Tower, or defend an important position, i.e. a vulnerable part of your main.

Then I saw my enemy fooling around in my base with a drone - I didn't think anything of it, figured he was just scouting. Then all of a sudden, he places an evolution chamber in between my hatchery and a mineral thingy. I had no idea how to react, so I reacted the same way I would had someone tried to hatchery spine crawler rush me - I sent all of my drones to destroy it.

It took a lot of time to do this, because only about half my drones could even attack it because the mineral thingy and hatchery blocked for a surround. After a good 30 seconds or so, I managed to destroy the evolution chamber and, holy mother of dog, 5-6 little crawley thingies come out of it and kill half of my workers.

Needless to say, I got terribly owned that game.

TL;DR: I got owned by an evolution chamber.

I am a Masters Terran player(IINcheezhead, CheezheadRU) This is something I've been interested in as of late and wanted to attempt my best shot at it.


I want to have 2 project players preferably of lower division(plat and lower) but willing to take a higher division if interesting enough of a case. 
Where I coach them for a few weeks(couple days a week for a few hours, in concept) in an attempt to improve their play(duh). We will go through phases like mechanics, builds, in game coaching, etc. 

Some of this is still in the planning phase and this is why it's free and more willing to take a lower division player, because there might be a better chance of improvement.


Main Req:

1 American player

1 European player

Have to be either English or Russian speaking.

Pref(plat or lower)

(If you have you want to ask questions in-game, achristes.570@ EU Server :) )

Zerg

- Learn to keep your injects up, especially in ZvZ, helps you spend your money aswell

- Try to determine when it is safe to make drones, keep a ling outside his base to see when he moves out

- Dont be afraid to make spines when you have a ton of minerals, just remember to remake the drones

- Don't allin vs terran, ever

- Don't try to learn pro-build orders that you clearly are incapable of doing, IE TLO's crazy ass nydus stuff and drops (by all means try, but don't expect to be able to pull it off)

- Don't have more then 75-ish drones, except if you plan on making a spinewall or smth

Protoss

- I think in the lower leagues, collosus is your best bet

- Make probes and pylons

- Make a proxy pylon when being aggressive

- Use your chronoboost, it's a beastly ability and should be used constantly

- Learn to forcefield and you win

- Zealots with +1weapons two shot lings without armor upgrades.

- Learn to make a gateway/cybercore/zealot wall vs zerg

Terran

- Basicly same as toss

- Constant SCV production, and supply depots to not get supplyblocked

- Get an orbital, mules are really good units (mining units that is)

- Don't ever engage on creep

- Learn to make a depot/rax/depot wall vs zerg

- Learn to scout. This is true of all three races, as all three have different methods of scouting. An SCV or Marine outside your opponents base to keep tabs on them works as well as a ling, though costs more.

- Learn your tools. The strength of Terran is adaptability. Terran has a lot of different tools at its disposal, a lot of which are great for specific situations and few of which are good in general. If you know what to use and when, then you will play 10x better. Know when to go mech, when to go bio, and when to go air.

- Learn your builds and practice them (this is another general one, but I'm gearing it towards terran). Watch pros and figure out their timings for when they build barracks or their orbital command. A smooth build order for Terran is a thing of deadly beauty.

- Building placement. Every supply depot should go where it will be helpful. They're awesome because they can be raised and lowered as needed, so T doesn't need to worry about being blocked in.

- Learn about add-ons. Notice how much pros move their buildings around between a couple addons? There are good reasons for it. Though they're cheap, add-ons take a lot of time to build. When you're first starting, don't worry about being fancy, but consider why a building should have one add on or another and what the best way to get that add on there is as the game progresses.

- Don't be afraid to scan if you really don't know what is going on with your opponent. As you improve, you won't need to scan as much, and you'll learn that a MULE is generally better. But even if you're a GM, if you really can't get a good scout, information is the most valuable commodity.

- As a general rule to start with, get 3 unit producing structures per mining base. That's about how many can be supported with full production, be they barracks, factories, or starports. Getting into the late game and sitting on a ton of money? Build more production so that when you lost a lot of units in a battle, you can rebuild them quickly. This can be the difference between winning and losing against a Z or P, since they can generally build stuff faster than you.

It would be awesome with some help with the toss and terran guides, as I only play Zerg in Diamond league and don't really know about the other races in the lower leagues.

Also, the only scouting you can use in lower leagues are seeing a tech building, seeing double gas at 14 supply from terran doesn't always mean 2port banshee, it could be anything because it is after all low leagues, and those guys are crazy. Short version, scouting is really unreliable in the lower leagues, and players are often very unpredictable.

This is not to bash noobies, but it's the truth (in most cases), you suck, you don't have the necessary mechanics. Basicly all you need to do is to mass games and learn your race, be it injecting, muling, chronoing etc. Learn it and spend your money and your going the right direction. This is not CoD, or some brainless shooter. You will not know how to play this game from the first online game unless you have some RTS experience.
And for god's sake, skip the practice league. It's terribad, has all the ooold ladder maps (Steppes, Blistering Sands etc) in novice version with a slower gamespeed. Learn to play at Faster from the beginning and it will be alot easier.

Again, no hate towards noobies, I &lt;3 heart you always for your crazy strats :)w

For me, the zerglings are running into my base when my first zealot is halfway done.  By the time he is out, 3 probes are down.  Once I manage to kill off all the zerglings ( my zealot dying of course ), more zerglings run into my base.  This cycle repeats until I have no more mineral to make zealots.


I can't remember my build order exactly, but it is something like this.


8-pylon at ramp
11-warpgate at ramp
13-second pylon to power warpgate when the first goes down
Create zealot the second the warpgate is ready, and chrono-boost.

Of course probes are also being pumped out and chrono-booste during this build.

This means if you set the video options of SC2 to be fullscreen windowed mode it will display over the game and count up for you from 0. Just use the hotkeys to reset it when the game starts.

I thought it might be useful for keeping track of builds, reminding you to check units, when to expand, etc. Use it for whatever you want. If this was already done I apologize because I made it for myself.

The included dll is a library for global hotkeys that I found on Sourceforge. Here's the link:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39482/OverlayTest.zip

Instructions:

Go to SC2 video options, check fullscreen windowed.

Use control+arrow keys to move it.
ctrl+' to show/hide, ctrl+; to reset the timer, and ctrl+q to quit.

My initial impression was that the game is very defensive. You can negate early rushes with your commander and point defenses are very powerful.

Then I went online and watched some pro player VODs... WOW. Those guys makes the game seem more like a war sim. The macro is just insane and there's so much going on... There doesn't seem to be a very monotone meta game either. It can end in many different ways, like early tech 1 rushes, dropship snipes of the commander, lategame nukes, experimental units etc... What really impressed me was how much teching really pays off. A tech 3 assault bot can demolish a whole tech 2 army, forcing the other player to fall back.

The game seem to be very macro oriented, but I've seen examples of well executed micro. All-in-all the battles feel more like real-life skirmishes than a game, and the scale is just amazing. Scrolling in and out of the battlefield is very well executed IMO.

I also find the resources interesting. You fight over key mass collecting points, while not building too much at the same time so that the energy consumption gets too high.

That's just my initial thoughts. Let me know what you guys think of it from a constructive POV. ""lol sc is clearly superior fuck supcom"" is not constructive.

As the title says, I am COMPLETELY new to SC2. I have no experience whatsoever with the Starcraft franchise or even RTS' in general.

Not to mention, I have burnt out on D3 after trying to enjoy it for months without success...that game is beyond broken. 


What I'm wondering is, what does someone who literally just stepped into the SC2 scene need to know? I would appreciate any in depth guides, with complete breakdowns, on the basics of the game and sc2 in general. In all honesty, the only reason why I didn't get SC2 earlier, is because it is so intimidating, and there just seems to be so much stuff going on. The learning curve seems huge. Especially to someone who's played shooters such as CoD, CSS, TF2, etc. 


I should also mention, the only class I've tried so far is Terran.

The reason I am making this post is because I am looking for another player(s) that would be interested in learning SC2 with me.  A fellow protoss player around my level would be great for moral support, but obviously any other type of player would be good.

I would like someone that wants to analyze replays on skype, practice, and do all that good stuff.

I beat the campaign on hard, and I think my crowning achievement was that I got all the achievements possible for campaign. After that, I took it a step further and got ALL the challenge achievements. That was pretty tough! Especially 1 or 2 on gold, I forget which. 

Anyway, after THAT, I went on to do some placement matches. After going about 7-3 I think, I was placed in platinum league. Not feeling like I was really platinum, and having anxiety about multiplayer, I never played multiplayer again.

Assuming I can get un-rusted from not playing in such a long time, I am thinking about starting back up in multiplayer. I have googled some basic tips, but these are just it--basic. Really basic, stuff I already knew about (hotkeying buildings + units, attack move, etc.)

Just looking for some medium-advanced tips. I usually play protoss or terran, but would not be opposed to zerg.

Which one is generally easier for new players? What are the advantages and disadvantages for each side?

Something I've noticed about playing Starcraft 2 casually with a few friends is that different people seem to be more inclined towards one or the other (micro vs macro). For me personally, micro is something that comes more naturally to me than macro. One of my friends is the exact opposite; he can macro with less conscious effort, but loses tactical battles because of micro.

I'm just curious to know if the micro/macro inclination correlates to strengths and weaknesses outside the Starcraft realm? Does anyone have any thoughts?

My name is Tyler Sawyer and have been an avid fan of video games for the majority of my life and am currently top 20 masters. I am also have been doing Tae Kwon Do since I was 3, and have become a top level Tae Kwon Do athlete over the years being able to be on national teams to represent the United State in countries all over the world in my weight class. Much of my recent success has been attributed to my mentality when it comes to training and maintaining consistency within my performances. Lately I have been looking at SC2 from a performance perspective, seeing where/how I can improve my performance over time and in tournaments and have been having major success. I can attribute much of this to my background with high level performance and sports psychology.

To keep things short, I have came to the conclusion that sports psychology can also apply to eSports, and while I am not an expert writer nor a qualified sports psychologist (I have taken many seminars over the past 7 years as well as have my own mental coach that I work with every day), I am willing to share my knowledge with others in order for them to take their game play to the next level. I am currently in the process of creating an eBook for everybody to read and will be posting updates on material presented in the book on a website.

I was hoping to get some feedback from you all to see what parts of Starcraft you struggle with mentally in order for me to address them in my book. Below is a small except from one of the early chapters and a link if you are interested in learning more.

Thanks!


&gt;The path to becoming a successful progamer is the same with any high level sport; one must practice and perfect their art little by little until every facet of their game becomes flawless. The ultimate goal for any player is to hone their skills until their actions and reactions become natural, and all that is left to do is live in the moment.


&gt;The most important aspect in succeeding as a gamer is to become aware of how your brain processes the information it is presented. As humans, we have the innate ability to quickly adapt to situations that are presented, and people find that we adapt faster to those situations that we have had prior experience with. For example, if we look at the 4-gate in Zerg vs Protoss in the early days of Starcraft 2, there were plenty of cries of imbalance due to the fact that Zerg players did not understand how to react after seeing the given situation. But over a period of time, they learned how to read the tells of a 4-gate and build units and structures accordingly. In League of Legends, new players have a hard time until they understand the mechanics and abilities of all of the characters. Understanding and experience are forms of adaptation that allow our brains to quickly and subconsciously make decisions.

&gt;Throughout our lives, experiences create memories which mold our neurological system into responding in a way that our brains believe is optimal for the given situation. If you see a car coming, you don’t walk into the street. This is not something you think about: rather, it is a reaction to information coming into your system.

1339785349.0	v3t7c	I am seriously struggling to play Terran. Can anybody give me any answers on how I should play this race.	Clbull	17	4	26	"**NOTE: THERE IS SOME CRASS LANGUAGE HERE. EXCUSE MY WORDING, IT PROBABLY BEST EXPRESSES EACH TERRAN MATCHUP**

I don't have any replays to give but I can describe a lot of my problems in the game as follows:

**TvZ:**

I cannot pull off any effective timing pushes. I have tried Hellion Expand (as in the safe factory before CC variation, not the CC first variation) into Marine Tank pushes whilst trying to establish a third but more often than not it's easy for the Zerg to scout and they often shut it down with absolute ease either with an Infestor timing or muta whorage. As in I'd either get close to the Zerg base then have all my marines fungalled then ling bane a-moved into the army composition, or my tanks would be caught unsieged by a ling bane infestor surround or as soon as I leave my base, 10 - 20 mutas would come in and fucking rape my SCVs.

I have even tried to forget the idea of a timing push and get a fast third (10 - 12 mins) but often get destroyed either by a timing push or by ultra-lategame Zerg where no matter how many tanks I have (and I can have 14+ tanks at one time), I get shut down by a late game ultralisk infestor push or brood lords morphing at my main to ass rape me.

**TvP:**

Similar problem to TvZ. I cannot do any pressure in the early game because more often than not Sentries will shut it down. I try going drop heavy in the midgame but often the Protoss turns it into an unwinnable base race with a Chargelot or Colossus push.

The ultra-late game is unwinnable for me, High Templar are overpowered as fuck, I cannot snipe any because more often than not the Protoss is not mentally retarded and has his army positioned really well and any Blink Stalkers or Chargelots can shut down any attempts to Snipe the High Templar.

Then there's dealing with Protoss aggression. Sometimes their aggression options are ridiculously overpowered, especially if a sentry-heavy timing push.

**TvT:**

Do not get me started on this matchup. The same shit happens every game. Either I get contained and cannot break it then ragequit, or I do a push then get a dual pronged drop rape everything in my base or it goes on to a 1 hour 40 minute long game where I narrowly lose because he has too many Vikings or mass Raven.

**Generally:**

In the later game, I find it seriously hard to keep up with Supply Depot production or extra building production. It's not like it is as Zerg or Protoss. Protoss can literally warp in buildings with the same Probe and Zerg can just sacrifice a drone to convert it into a building, and rely solely on hatcheries and injects to keep constant production.

Oh yeah and I also need to use another two actions per SCV to centre the camera upon a mining base AND use Shift+right click to queue up a command where the SCV moves back to the mineral line after building.

Terran need to actually micro their buildings, switch them around in the air to put Reactors or Tech Labs upon them unless you are morphing a Tech Lab or a Reactor on a building with the sole intention of using it just for that building.

And I find Terran far more micro-intensive than any other race. With bio, I literally have to spam like a Korean, spread my marines perfectly, engage with a really good concave and make sure no huge hits land. And this is just to survive a mid/late game engagement. Furthermore, I have to drop pressure as well if I want to even remotely claw ahead.

**Additional Information:**

I play Zerg at a platinum level on EU server, but I want to play Terran more despite being terrible at the race. I want to aim for Master League no matter what."	t5_2qspc	True

I've been able to ladder a bit recently since finals ended, so I decided to take a little time out of my week to write a short yet interesting guide on my favorite opening for PvZ. I came up with this all of the below information on my own, so I don't actually know what other players are doing recently, and some may even be doing exactly what I detail here. Just a heads up.

1323566998.0	n7zuf	New player need some help regarding macro.	goodbye9hello10	12	1	20	"Alright so I just started playing Starcraft, I played very little when I was a kid. I was more into Warcraft 3 and FZ, but I did play Starcraft a tiny bit. Unfortunately none of that really carried over to this point. Because of this, I'm using the GRID hotkey system. I used to play CoH which I used the grid system on and AoE3 a little bit as well, and in general I think this is the best system for new players.

Anyways. I've been wondering what are some good configurations for binding groups of buildings/units. I've been trying some things out with fairly little success. I'm playing Zerg as a race, and I'm a little bit confused regarding a good way to organize queens and hatcheries and such. What should I bind my hatchery to? Also my queens? I've usually been doing Scouting Drone to 1, then Hatchery(s) on 2, then Queen(s) on 3, and then army after that. Followed by tier two buildings afterwards. I feel there is a better way though for some reason. If anyone could give me some advice regarding that. 

This leads to my next question, is there a way to press one button to cycle through all the units/buildings in a group? 

For example, if I have three queens binded to 4, if I hit 4, is there a button I can hit to cycle through all three of them so I can larvae inject better? Same with Gateways for example, if I wanted to vary units out of each building faster.

Don't forget I am new, so there's probably at least one thing I went full retard talking about. If so just let me know. Thanks.

I realize it is extremely strong and simple but I want to try to have a Mech. style of TvP that I can use when I get bored of MMM or on huge maps.  And I feel like Mech. will be awesome TvP after the Carrier is removed, as that is the best counter to straight Mech. play.  The style I have been trying to utilize is a normal 2rax marine marauder expand into 3 factory mech making 2 tanks and 2 hellions at a time.  I try to add a factory or 2 per expansion.  Then I start to make Ghosts and basically try to go for Ghosts mixed with Tanks, BF Hellions, and Thors.  I don't have a recent replay so I'm not going to bother posting one but I want to start seriously commiting to this style.  Any thoughts?	t5_2qspc	True

**Check In**

Starting at 7:30 pm Eastern on the day of the tournament, all participants must check in to reserve their spot in the bracket. To do so, please send a message to the tournament administrator **tofumaniac.874** in-game once you come online to play in the event. This and any other event will use the in-game chat channel **SCVRush**. Check In closes at **8:29pm Eastern.** Please don’t be late!

**Grand Prize**

The champion will be awarded one hour of free coaching with our prestigious Master coaching staff!

**Tournament Rules**

1. Match Beginning – After the tournament begins, players may continue playing rounds as the bracket updates. If your opponent does not show or is unresponsive, please report him to an admin and wait for 15 minutes. If he fails to response after this period of time, he will then be disqualified immediately.

2. Observers – Other players may observe tournament games provided both participants allow it. If lag issues arise, all observers must leave the game. Staff Members or Casting Partners of SCV Rush may observe any match at any time.

3. Replays – All replays must be saved by both players for possible future investigation. Failure to comply the first time will result in a warning. A second failure will result in disqualification.

4. Disconnects – If a player disconnects within the first 5 minutes, the game will be restarted. After 5 minutes, the disconnected player forfeits the game. If there are any objections to this rule (a player was the decided victor before 5 minutes, for example) players may contact a tournament admin, who will review the replay and determine whether a regame will be played. However, this exception may be applied only once during a round.

5. Stalemates – In the event of a stalemate, the game will be replayed. The full in-game stalemate timer must elapse before players may start a regame.

6. Manner – In-game chat must be limited to the initial good luck, and then good game, expressions. Any communication containing hateful, racial, sexual or otherwise offending content will result in a warning; failure to rectify the bad manner will then result in disqualification. The tournament admins reserve the right to judge what is offensive and what is not.

7. Stream Cheating, Hacking, Illegal Advantages – Players may stream their games if they wish. However, any player abusing an illegal advantage over his opponent will be instantly disqualified from the current event and banned from two future SCV Rush events. The tournament admins reserve the right to decide what determines this illegal practice.

**Miscellaneous**

* You may be contacted by our Content Representative and asked to provide a replay for the purpose of the Video Replay Analysis category. You may reject this proposal if you wish.
* Any questions? Address them either to the comment section below or contact us directly at thescvrush@gmail.com, and we will answer within 24 hours.

Alot of terrans problems vs zerg lategame seems like it is some kind of mass ling reinforcement (obviously this is not the case with all strategies), and lings are very heavy on larvae count right?
My idea is when you see a zerg move out drop some helions in his bases (or run by) and target the larvae. Helions roast larvae and they stack like crazy when you have 10 or so sitting around.
This may be very micro intesive, especially if he attacks you at the same time, but I feel like this idea could be very useful as the zerg can't just reinforce with 116 cracklings. I don't play terran myself so this is something that would be rather difficult for me to test out, but I believe if you can pull this off things would be much easier for terran lategame.

If anyone would like to check this strat out and you are on EU server my ID is Inconsistent.991 and I would love to see how this works out.
I may be stupid as shit for posting this if it's actually good as I play zerg and I like dominating terrans with a lot of lings, but at the same time I feel kind of sorry for Terrans microing/macroing like bosses and still get owned by mass reinforcements.

Now, I have SC2, and I can hardly ever bring myself to play any 1v1. I play 2v2 with a friend, but that's about it. It's just, humiliating to have every single game over by the 10 minute mark. (and I was placed in gold, for whatever reason, despite losing all placement matches.)

Any advice? I play mostly Protoss, because it is so much easier for me to manage construction. Terran, I can never get up any decent unit production, and Zerg completely messes with my mind.

I want to be able to try the other races, but I don't feel I learn much of anything when I'm typing gg 8 minutes in. Makes me not want to play the game anymore and stick to custom."	t5_2qspc	True

My name is Ryan the purpose of this post is to gauge the interest of the Reddit starcraft 2 community if i was to create a daily stream named 'Fat to Buff, Gold to Diamond'.

Now i assume you'll be curious as to what the title of the stream is insinuating, well, basically my intention is to stick to a specific tailored diet and weights training regime and stream starcraft 2 when i am not training with the goal of improving my game play enough to reach diamond league. I will have a webcam positioned so that viewers can see my physique and those viewers who choose to watch over time can notice the transformation. I will not be taking any steroids. My stream will not be of my workouts only starcraft 2 however i will give advice and update everyone on my diet, weights etc if anyone is interested.

So my background, i am 23 years of age, born and live in Australia. Currently i am roughly 110-115kg and 6ft tall with a heavy set build i am estimating i am between 20-30% body fat at the moment so i have a lot to lose but i intend to gain a considerable amount of muscle in that time. I will be following a powerlifters training regime which will focus on increase my weights consistently. 

Hopefully if i get enough positive response from this post i will be able to make this idea become a reality and i will be able to use it for motivation. 

If you have any further questions please respond to this post and i will answer them. My twitch account is www.twitch.tv/ryrymanpie if you're interested please follow me.. 

Also i will be keeping a daily blog where i will discuss my programs and training as well as my current mental state etc. http://ryrymanpie.blogspot.com.au/

For the past probably 6 months I've had awful ladder anxiety. I absolutely love Starcraft. I've watched most of Day9's dailies since SC2 came out, and I've been playing the game since beta.

I feel like I know a lot about the game. I know strengths/weaknesses of individual units, builds, and can identify what my opponent is doing in a game. I feel like I have all of the knowledge to play the game well, but something happens when I'm ready to hit that ""find a match"" button.

When I want to play, I typically play against very hard AI for 2-3 games to warm up, but even after I'm comfortable with how I'm feeling, I end up usually pulling up a stream, or try to play a 2's game with my friend. Or I just play another game altogether.

When I DO hit the find match button, a few things happen... my heart races and feels like it's going to beat out of my chest, my hands shake as I try to do the first few things on my keyboard, especially if they scout extra early. In my mind, I know the earliest marines or lings can show up at my base, but panic sets in. I do stupid things like not only supply block myself, but completely forget a cyb. core... I mean COME ON.

There are some games where I'll let my macro slip because I'm in a panic, then I put down 2 robo bays on one base very very early on, so there's no way I can produce out of it. I can't explain what actually happens in my head, all I know is that with those sort of mistakes, I lose. After 4-5 games, I tend to calm down and start playing like I should, then I win games (although I still feel nervous). My palms sweat, I sit up straight in my chair and I am a focused motherfucker when I play. I have less than 100 1v1 wins and I'm ranked mid-gold currently.

The past two seasons though, I played one 1v1 game, other than my placement matches. The thing is though, I play 2v2 with my friend who plays (he's a plat Terran), and we kick ass. I feel ZERO pressure while playing, I'm relaxed, and I do what I'm supposed to.

It's not that I'm afraid of losing. When I lose, I don't get all down on myself, I mean it's just a game. This season, the first time I played, I had the entire day off, so I was sitting at my computer doing other things. I was wanting to play SC2 so bad, but it took a full 7 hours before I talked myself into playing. After a while, I did well enough, but it took that long for me to actually play.

I had a chance to get on my company's AHGL team a while back, because I played very well when I was practicing with people who were definitely going to be on the team. The problem is that I was silver because I didn't fucking play. I still think of the opportunity I missed because of me simply not playing, and it sucks. I played and beat some others that ended up being on the team (plat level guys), but I didn't make the team because I was silver. I can't blame them, I can only blame myself.

I'm not new to player v.s. player games. I played PvP in MMO's (namely WoW, one of the top arena teams on my server), FPS games, etc... I've been playing games all my life, I don't understand what is so different about Starcraft.

I'm convinced that this is a psychological thing, but I have no idea how to get over this. I watch/read Starcraft-related stuff daily, yet I never play because I wuss out when it's time to ladder.

Does anyone have any insight or advice at all? I know I sound like a pussy, but I honestly can't help what happens in my head when it's time to ladder. Just thought I'd share, because it's very frustrating, and I've missed out on hundreds, if not thousands of games, because I simply let anxiety take over when it's time to play.

TLDR: Get very nervous when it's time to queue for ladder, but I have a good knowledge of the game. I play team games fine, but in 1v1 I miss the very basics of play in games because I'm so anxious (hands shaking, sweating, heart racing, etc)."	t5_2qspc	True

1343427351.0	x9qyz	Reddit, what are your embarrassing noob misunderstandings?	Enigma628	14	5	17	"I'll start.

When I first tried out Zerg, I had never played anything but the campaign, which let me play a lot as Terran and a bit as Protoss, but never as Zerg, so most of the mechanics were pretty new to me. So, one of the hardest things for me to pick up was creep and how to spread it. For the longest time (I think until I hit gold league) I spawned a new tumor EVERY time I wanted to push my creep out. I had no idea I could select previous tumors to move them forward. So, I always built one queen to spawn a tumor and my creep spread was horrendous because of my derpiness. I finally realized after watching pro matches how creep spread works and it was a completely epiphanic moment for me. In my defense, how was I supposed to know that?

So, what are some mistakes or misunderstandings that you have made or had?"	t5_2qspc	True
1343346843.0	x7wc5	New zerg player here, looking for some advice	Quintic	14	4	26	"I just got starcraft 2 and started playing it about a day ago. I played briefly during beta, but didn't really learn anything.

I looked up some build orders on youtube, and am trying to go with building extractor on 14, spawning pool right after, and going for zergling speed or roaches. I got that from here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux_nslpWqaE

I am sure I just suck, but I am getting destroyed against terran going heavy marines/mauraders. Both times I saw them build two or three barracks right away, so I guess this may be a hint they are doing that. But what am I suppose to do against this combination? 

I may be going a bit heavy on zerglings, they seem to chew through them quickest. I am thinking against terran I need to go more roach heavy, so I can take down their wall in. The choke seems to make it hard for zerglings to do.

Any advice would be great. Is there a place where new players can go and meet people who play? I don't really know anyone who plays and can give me advice on how not do be terrible. lol. Thanks."	t5_2qspc	True

1327088286.0	op808	Is the term Manner Mule being classified as every nonmineral mule drop?[OPINION]	Ugotheadcrabs	15	5	14	"While watching today's rebroadcast of the NASTL for EU, I noticed Gretorp and FireZerg saying the term Manner Mule a lot when Puma and Happy were at a standstill siege line.

From playing this game as long as I have, a manner mule to me signifies a ""You lose get out"" or a ""There is no way you can recover"" gesture instead of a strategic placement of your mules to disrupt a siege line that could possibly win you the game.

Another instance relates to what I said before, which is extremely common on the korean servers. When a terran is running through your base, you pretty much are just staring at the screen thinking ""guess I'll go find another match"" Just waiting to say GG, and just so you know you lose, the terran drops a few mules in your base saying ""There really is no way you can come back""


**Seen in the GSL often**


Now, maybe there is such thing as a good manner mule, and a bad manner mule. But is the manner nexus not the same thing as a manner mule just more expensive? and I don't think I have ever seen the manner nexus used as a good manner thing.


**Seen on MC and Incontrols stream occasionally**


My point is, is the term Manner Mule being used too much for actual uses of the mule that aren't obtaining minerals, or are all these uses, siege drops, end game base drops, 'being a dick' drops, all a kind of manner mule.

This wasn't a bash gretorp or FireZerg thread, as a Terran/Toss player I would like to know other peoples opinion on the ""Manner Mule""."	t5_2qspc	True

When I watch this matchup, I almost always see zerg sending out overlords to the edges of the map to watch for drops.  Why don't Terran players usually build 1-2 vikings to take these out?  Are they really expensive?  By my ignorant estimation, best case, you secure the drop secrecy and have a slight chance of supply blocking, worst case you're out the minerals/gas if they eventually get taken out. 

I guess I could see no need to if drops are not a major part of your play, but if they are I'm wondering why Terran players dont do this.  Shed some light please?"	t5_2qspc	True

Grubby's play this week was excellent, and I was really happy with his performance against Rainbow. His builds seem to have progressed beyond ""I can beat everything with blink stalkers.""

qxc's play was less inspired, but he played TvZ the way TvZ needs to be played, and it paid off. His economic harass was debilitating, and he was able to play a waiting game against Darkforce that led him to the win. Hopefully this win will give him the confidence to put him back in the running (in other events) with his creative, multitasking Terran strategies.

While neither of these players are going to be making it to the playoffs, and may not be in NASL season two, at least they proved this week that they deserved a spot in this league."	t5_2qspc	True

1281425483.0	cze7c	In this very chair.	Theropissed	19	9	28	"In this chair, years ago. I remember installing a game I was unfamiliar with. It was Christmas, I had no idea when I unwrapped my gift that I would begin a journey that I would realize what my passion was. It may be exaggerated, or even somewhat doubtful, as many are now looking wondering if I am trolling or being dramatic. Well the least I can say is I could take a dramatic license, but in this case, I am not. 

I played the game, fascinated by its complex simplicity. I remember spending hours as a 10-11 year old boy, trying to stay alive for the 30 minutes so Mengsk could rescue me. I remember the feeling of frustration I had when I awaited Kerrigans rebirth as Zerg. And the awestruck feeling when I saw the final cinematic. A year later, I had waited, impatiently, 365 days for Brood War. Months before that Christmas I had peaked and looked in my parents room for my present. I couldn't find it, when, finally, I saw receipts. Receipt for Brood War was amongst the pile of gifts long forgotten now. For months, I stared at that receipt, wondering what awaited me with the expansion I now cherish as much as the Original, and as much as some cherish the Bible. Finally, when I got it, I was not disappointed. 

Starcraft saw me through boy scouts, karate, middle and high school. It was there when i was in the military, and it was there when i was shattered because I was discharged. Through the darkest parts of my life it was there. In 2007, months after I was discharged, and months after I had lost hope because of it, I saw it. The announcement, I had watched anxiously as I had watched for Ghost and other announcements for it. That week i placed a reservation at Gamestop. Five dollars. Five dollars that would otherwise buy me my new addiction to either smoking or drinking. Two vices that I kept because I could not cope with the world as I should have. The best five dollars I ever spent because for a moment it kept me sane and kept me healthy. For the moment. The cinematic you released early on, I watched over and over again. Even now, I watch it, because I still get excited, I still get overjoyed. 

2010, You annouced the collectors. After visiting your website almost daily for new info, after signing up for the Beta almost a year in advance, You announced a collectors edition. That month I was 100 dollars short on my bills. Oh well. This was worth it. And for months I impatiently awaited much as I did for Brood War, obsessing over it. Combing over every detail you had put out for this game, every cinematic and trailer you released (as well as pirates released). I was so impatient I actually pirated your game a week before I got a beta invite so I could just experience it. I'm ashamed to say that. Because I have standards. If it's something I respect and love, I do not pirate, I buy. Unfortunately, I could not help myself. 

Finally, you released the game (Albeit in Orlando, where I live, there is no midnight and I could not fly out to any of your conventions or midnight releases, I'm poor.), That day I did something unusual. Instead of racing home to install and play, I spent an hour doing errands.....maybe I was too afraid to play it? It was a dream perhaps? After all, I had many dreams similar, and I woke up from them. Then, in my room, I installed the game, it took two hours. I took a nap. I finished the campign there. But it didn't feel right. So I moved downstairs. And took my chair downstairs too. 

You see, that chair, My parents had given me. It's an old computer chair they had, they let me have it because I said i wanted it. It was the same chair that comforted me as I played Starcraft and Brood War years ago. I moved it downstairs to the same location I played Starcraft and Brood War. Unfortunately, the computer is less than a year old, the desk younger than Brood War. But it's the same chair. The same chair I sat in, overjoyed and happy. 

The same chair I sit in still, overjoyed and happy. No matter how many times I lose on your new (and some would say faulty) Battle.net. No matter how many times I fail the mission ""Outlaws"" on hard because I took a second too long. I am still happy. I am still overjoyed. 

If at all, Blizzard, You gave me something to live for, after all of the real war, and all of the crazy #!%! I've seen as a combat medic, and as a teenager. Starcraft, I would say, is the closest thing I have to religion and comfort. 

And for that, I thank you. 

I will buy your two expansions, and anything Starcraft. I have the books. I just request you keep on doing your fine #!%!, no matter what company you merged with. Starcraft, in any form, will always make me happy, and give me a reason to live. 

Thank you Blizzard. 

En Taro Tassadar.

But there are many English SC2 commentators out there, some of whom are in my opinion much better than Husky/HD.

For example, [PsY](http://www.youtube.com/PsyStarcraft) is a #1 ranked platinum Zerg player and his commentary is awesome - and actually much more helpful than Husky/HD for players since he analyses the game a little more. Yeah, he swears sometimes and has less of a professional veneer than Husky or HD have had as of late, but he's my favourite SC2 commentator by far.

YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/PsyStarcraft

I'm surprised there's no link to [Day9](http://day9tv.blip.tv/), he's above and beyond other commentators in terms of breaking games down and analysing them. Some people may not like the way he pauses and rewinds a lot, but there's nobody that goes into as much detail. Plus he does a game every day.

It seems if the protoss player decides he wants to cannon rush, he'll get atleast one up, by then the lings are only just out and get destroyed by cannons, then they just go voidray or DT production :/ Not possible to get any spines down at the natural either because the hatch hasn't spread creep yet.

The only way I can seem to beat it is if I throw down a 12 pool with double extractor trick, but with this I'm sacrificing economy against any player that plays standard.  Is there some trick to defending with drones?  I pull like 5 of them first with 1 attacking the probe, then if he puts up more, I pull all but 3 to deal with it."	t5_2qspc	True

When Toss comes with a pylon/cannon drop at my natural I find it pretty difficult to defend against with drones. I've defended it successfully a few times with 5 drones attack the pylon. The problem I find is when they place it behind the mineral line it's quite hard to surround with drones.

My question: how do i defend against cannon rush at my natural with just drones - when it's placed behind the mineral line - I've scoutted it earlier enough. 

Any vids would be great.

For reference I'm platinum.

Thanks

**Edit: So from what I'm hearing:
1. You can't stop it with 15 hatch (or it's near impossible).
2. Go 14 hatch 
3. Abandon and go to third (which I have done before but it's quite hard to manage 2 bases so far away**

I don't care much that it's perfectly balanced, but are there certain things that you could say are, I guess, massive bullshit?  If so, at what level of play would these actually affect me?  I'm not too optimistic about getting to higher ranks anytime soon seeing as how this would be my first RTS, but I'd like to get as much fun as possible out of it before race balance becomes a glaring issue, assuming I get it.

1363555797.0	1ahh4o	I'm a newbie, should I buy HotS or is WoL okay for now?	lifenotfound	10	0	13	"I've always wanted to get into SC2 but the initial time investment learning all the units and builds and timings was really intimidating.

I have no RTS experience so I approached the game like a university class, trying to memorize units etc and play vs AI. Now that's really boring but I felt stuck in this ""can't play because I don't know anything, can't learn without playing"" loop.

I was watching a Day9 episode and he was talking about getting into SC2 and basically said don't worry about anything just go play. So I turned off the video and played my first multiplayer match!

I ended up winning 2 of my placement matches which was pretty cool, and it stuck me in Silver which I am nowhere near ready for and it keeps matching me against gold players.

So I have a couple of questions now. I noticed a ""leave league"" button, if I leave will it put me in Bronze? Should I worry about this or after I lose enough will it match me against lower-skilled players?

I've only played my 5 placement matches and 2 or 3 games so far.

NExt question is about HotS. Should I buy this now? Is the pool of people on WoL maybe why I'm getting matched against higher players? Or is there still plenty of activity with WoL and I shouldn't worry about it at this time?

I don't want to give the false impression that I actually know anything about the game. I built a Spire because I thought I needed it to make Spore Crawlers when something invisible was killing my stuff. My solution to missing injects is a 2nd hatch so when I do remember I can vomit twice. I also unintentionally play like the goal is to finish the game with the most unspent minerals &gt;.&gt;

Anyway it's a slow Sunday and I'm just sharing my intro into SC2 and kind of wondering about HotS.

*  Where should I be in the ladder right now? I started the game about 5 days ago and I'm currently Silver Division Rank 1, and I've won the last few games as Rank 1.

* At what point are players considered ""good"" I assume its Master's League but what really sets them apart from a Diamond player? 

* What should I be looking to improve on realistically? Right now I'm playing Zerg. I average like 150-200 apm and don't usually miss injects but my creep spread is almost always terrible, is creep spread really important and should I be trying to do that more? 

* What is the proper saturation for a base? I've heard 16 drones on minerals but I've heard different numbers thrown around and I see more on streams sometimes.

* Other than getting higher on the ladder what are things I should be noticing about myself to see that I'm getting better?

I'm sorry if most of these are easy questions or well known but as I'm new I don't really know where to find the resources to get answers. "	t5_2qspc	True

Hi, my name is Breaker. 

This is sort of a story of inspiration from me, but it really helped. I'm just an ordinary gamer - Diamond NA, Platinum on TW/KR. And I'm hoping maybe it will help you guys if you've ever been plagues with as much ladder anxiety as I was prior to this event.

I met GamaniaSen at a Barcraft event at brass monkey in Taipei Taiwan. I'm a caucasian that studies Chinese and International Security Studies, and I was hoping I would actually see Sen with my own two eyes one day, and I did. I was an exchange student.

This was profound to me because he is a world-famous pro and he was a native speaker of Chinese. But frankly, I was impressed with his performance at NASL seasons one and two.

When I met him, I was speaking Mandarin. But I didn't want to come across as the annoying fan-boy, a friend introduced us. I'm trying to translate this as best as I can.
""Hi, my name is Ben.""
""Wa! Your Chinese is really good!""
""Yeah, my ex-girlfriend is from mainland China.""

Besides him, I met JoemanStarcraft and SoBadRush, think ""Day9"" and ""TotalBiscuit"" of Taiwan, respectively. I asked them, ""What does it take to be a caster here in Taiwan?"" and they replied, ""We want someone who is at least diamond on the TW/KR server and is able to speak Chinese.""

This immediately inspired me. It put me into a an amazingly good mood the next day and I was grinding the ladder with a mood that is comparable to Day[9]'s enthusiasm. I lost maybe only one game that day on the Korean ladder, albeit I had tons of coffee and Red Bull, but it helped my critical thinking skills. I threw away this line of thinking that basically folllowed ""What if?"", and I followed through with full mechanical and reactive play. I play zerg.

Since then, I guess you could say I made progress. On the Korean ladder, I made it to Platinum league. I made it into diamond on NA. But there are still flaws I have to face. My own build order flaws and such.

Before I left Taiwan, I was crying my eyes out. The only two things in life that made sense to me came together in a form of perfect harmony: Esports and Chinese Language.

I don't know how to put it... It just put me in an insanely good mood for the longest time, and I noticed improvement because I was able to approach SC2 with a positive, open attitude and recognize what I was actually doing wrong."	t5_2qspc	True

Would'nt it be awsome to start a clan whit the focus to help each other to improve at starcraft?
To be able to find a practice partner when it is needed, and to have people to ask for help form? With the new clan system in Heart of the Swarm I think this woud be a great thing to do. I also got this idea to make a subreddit where people in the clan helps each other out.
The idea is for this to be a open clan for anyone to be apart of, and a great way for people to improve there gamestyle. So anyone from bronse to masters would be able to be apart of this if they so want to. but since HotS isnt coming for a while, I was thinking that a ingame chat channel would be a good starter. Also since there is cross server in HotS we will be able to make this a global clan. But meanwhile i can only make this a EU thing.
But does anyone think this is a good idea? Would anyone of you like to support and be a part of this? Since this won't work unless there is public interest. And i think it might be possible to solve it for the NA people aswell :)

The owners of Green Forest Cafe have hosted a number of onsite gaming tournaments and manage a professional gaming team. Two major tournaments were held in the parking lot of the shopping center and drew thousands of spectators. Green Forest Cafe is a unique business that is driven to inspire the community through gaming and Asian culture.

Green Forest Cafe not only supports the community that we serve but also relays on the community for support. We create and hold gaming events for our community.

Situation explanation:
So me, zerg.. VS protoss. (diamond)
I'm on 3base, he's on 2 base... since he's toss I always make sure to be one base ahead, right? All of the sudden a wild bunge of stalkers appear... The end.

... so I had roaches/bunge of lings but obv he's a Toss so he always out swarms me with his stalkers all tho I'm on 3 bases... I asked him if there was a counter to it, his answer: ""early bangelings"" ... so the answer to blinkstalker would be cheese him with a baneling bust? aha...

I always end up making a huge army of tier 3 units (Carriers, collosi, Mothership) and basically crushing the opponent. 95% that doesn't work out well. Another thing I need improvement on is building/upgrade/unit choices. I always tend to be overwhelmed at the number of choices that I have to make that I tend to make bad ones.

I tend to play Protoss and sometimes Terran. Hardly Zerg.

Any tips and strategies will be replied with cake and ~~poisoned~~ cookies.

EDIT: If someone could help me on how to start off a match that would be great. Specifics like how many probes until you build your first pylon and gateway, how to position buildings in the best way possible and which (Protoss) units are good for certain situations.

So I was playing as T in a (gold) TvZ last night on Antiga Shipyard and I was going to go fast banshee so I went gas first, then Barracks, etc. I scouted the zerg and saw that he went Hatch first so I knew I had a decent amount of time before I would see any pressure. Knowing this I decided instead to try to drop a seige tank on the little ledge and see what I could do.

I teched to siege, got a medivac, filled it with a tank, 3 marines and a scv and dropped on his ledge. I sieged upand used the medivac to get sight. I would also use my wicked gold level macro to pop the marines onto the ledge to lure units over, then pick them up and return them to safety while the tank took out the lings. The SCV kept the medivac healthy (as it was being hit by a queen) and I managed to snipe a few overlords, queen, and lings and disrupt his game pretty decently with a small amount of units.
Eventually he cleared it with mutas, but (yay gold level meta game) I had anticipated that this would be how he would clear it, so back home I was massing marines, marauders and a handful of tanks.

When he cleared it, I pushed with my marines/marauders/medivacs knowing a large portion of his army was mutas and that he most likely didn't have gas to go mass baneling, and I won.

My question is, how should the zerg have reacted? My (again, gold) gut is telling me he should have steered clear of the tank and just gone roaches to clear it off much like you would a bunker contain. The zerg was mad that he has no air until T2, so I was able to make that entire side of his base worthless because he couldn't clear out the medivac. Queens got killed by siege, and medivac kept being heled by my single scv.

ChairYeoman	15	8	3	"Format: The registration form asks you for your league, points, and unspent bonus pool. These numbers are run through a simple formula to (very roughly) calculate your MMR. You’re then grouped into “quads” of 4 by estimated MMR, and you play 3 games with each other person in your quad. The first game is on a predetermined map, and the next games are selected by the loser from the [map pool](http://sites.google.com/site/starcraftquads/maps), which is on the website.

[Here’s the website!](http://sites.google.com/site/starcraftquads)

The tournament starts Friday at 8PM US Eastern, or 5PM US Pacific.

Starting maps:

Round 1: Xel’Naga Caverns (start 8 PM Eastern)

Round 2: MLG Metalopolis (start 9:30 PM Eastern)

Round 3: Tal’darim Altar LE (start 11 PM Eastern)

Registration! (link removed) You must check-in within an hour of the tournament start; another Reddit post will go up 2 hours before the tournament starts.

I am still working out the casting; if needed, I will cast games myself. If you would like to be a caster for this tournament or future ones, [contact me](http://sites.google.com/site/starcraftquads/contact) through the website or PM me.

Good luck and have fun!

Anyways about 20 mins in I have to piss, been drinking beer and green tea, and i really have to go.

I apologize, brb, and pause the game.  I hear the game unpause mid stream and frantically try to finish.  I get back to find my opponent has destroyed my base while I was gone.

I was wondering if you kind sirs could point me in the direction of a website that discusses Starcraft 2 strategies and anything Starcraft 2 related.  I'm just trying to get some more information and maybe meet some cool people as I have 1 friend who plays and only know a quick rush 3 barracks build and a 1/1/1 build. 

So if you guys have a website or any strategies yourselves my ears are wide open. Also I play terran, and if I verse any of you guys in the near future gl hf.

I have been looking for build orders but I don't know where to find ones that are actually viable now.  Liquipedia seems to have the same ones that I used months ago and it seems like they are being easily countered. I could just be terrible, but after watching some replays, the builds people are using are different than they used to be. 

Anyway, Teamliquid forums seem to only have advanced build orders, and I think the ones in Liquipedia are outdated.  Any advice for where I can go to start back at the begining, sorta?"	t5_2qspc	True
1339927749.0	v6al2	I am a newbie Protoss player who keeps dying to the same things. Any recommendations?	scaliper	10	3	14	"Hey hey, y'all!

I suppose I'm technically not a ""newbie"" per se by playtime, but I'm still in Bronze League thanks to a few builds that just constantly wreck me. I was hoping some more experienced players would be willing to help out and give some suggestions.

My first big problem comes with the cannon-rush. I've been reading all over the place for help on this one, to no avail. Advice always follows along the lines of ""just scout it earlier."" Which is all well and good, and I've attempted to do so, but even when I succeed, I still just lose. Whether it's from bad micro or what have you, my opponent will *always* get a fast two pylons, then run his probe off. If I chase the probe, he brings in another one or two to build cannons once the pylons finish, and if I attack the pylons, well, then I see a cancel followed by cannons and pylons. I believe I read somewhere that, executed properly, the first cannon should fall right as the first zealot falls, so ""rushing for units"" isn't really all that viable. So what would be a good approach for me to take in dealing with these things?

Also from Protoss, I often see my opponent get silly numbers of void rays. Now, I've heard the ""cannons mean voids,"" and I've found it to be true, but I find that the wall-offs that I see are nearly certain death to a force of around 5 immortals. In my experience, around the fifth immortal is when the void rays start approaching numbers capable of dealing with any feasible tech-switch, and pushing with less than four immortals generally ends with me losing.

Relatedly, I often run into a player who gets a respectable force of zealots and stalkers and camps my main as a mask for mass-voids. While I find that a zealot/immortal mix generally does well against such a force, especially with some stalkers mixed in, this will usually keep me on low bases, and prevent me from doing the scouting and aggression that I'd like to do against a void-ray build. Is there something I'm not doing properly here?


The rest of my problems come from zerg. I am increasingly finding myself in a situation much like the previous when against zerg: A roach/ling army at the foot of my natural's ramp. I can't really expand to a third, harrassment is made much more difficult, as cutting units at my front leads, without fail, to my being overrun by mass units, and whatever I make to deal with the force is crushed rapidly immediately afterwards by whatever he makes to do so, generally mutalisks. I've tried things like HT/Archon/Zealot with 3-4 immortals, but instead of mutalisks, that generally leads to mass roach, which crushes my army almost instantly and then rides on into my main. Given that my attempts in harassing my opponent under these circumstances and thus cutting my front nearly always leads to getting overwhelmed, which aspect should I be working on? Composition, or harassment, or general micro, or what?

My other zerg problem is the 8/10-pool. I always build a gateway as quickly as I can afford to without cutting probes versus zerg(generally at 13), but the first 8 zerglings always show up right before the first zealot pops out, and then focus-fire it to death. Recently, I tried a cannon-defense upon scouting it, but the zerglings took out the still-building cannon fairly easily. Perhaps I was slow with the cannon, but I don't like the idea of opening with a forge for some reason. I generally feel much more secure with a gateway. How would you recommend dealing with these builds?

Last one(I promise) is fast mass-marauder. I've tried responding with void-rays, immortals, aggression, stalkers, chargelots, sentries, what have you, but I always end up losing, either when he makes a medivac and gets past my force-fields, or when he's making marauders so quickly that my ""counters"" just can't keep up in kill-rate. Any thoughts?

Any help is greatly appreciated. =)"	t5_2qspc	True

I've forgotten everything I learned while playing, but I'd like to get started again.I played Protoss when I first started, but I think I like zerg more so I'd like to play Zerg.

Is there a build I can stick to every game while I work/learn the basics and macro's of Terran? What I mean by this is, when I first played as Zerg I had major issues with macro, larvae management, injects, you name it. A buddy of mine gave me a 14/14 speedling opener, followed by mass roach into roach + corruptors/hydras/infestors etc depending on game situation. This really helped me improve my game because I didn't have to focus on the build. Keeping it consistent helped me remember to watch my supply, expand, inject, spread creep etc. Is there a similar build I can use for terran? Perhaps the 1-1-1?	t5_2qspc	True

I know I am messing something up, but I don't know what it is, so I need you guys' help. I have a few replays (none of them any longer than 20 mins) if you would like to check those out, and will provide a little brief summary of how I felt throughout each.


**Game 1 - Tal'darim Altar**

In this one, I felt like my opening and timings were okay. The only real question I have about this one, is how do I prevent him from backdooring me like he did with those reapers? Do I just have to rely on static defense? 

**Game 2 - Arid Plateau**

In this one, I felt like my macro was way better than his after watching the replay. I kept my money low, I don't think I got supply blocked more than once, but I for whatever reason couldn't defend against his Stalkers. Maybe it was a composition issue here?

I feel like with both of these games, I am struggling with the decision of when to attack him, and I feel like I am losing the benefit of my macro being so good by turtling and not taking advantage of it.

The build I followed was a simple 3 barracks build I saw on Husky's YouTube.

Right now we have features we plan to add, and we were wondering if you have any input/suggestions we should add to fulfill your needs.

Features we plan to have:
1) Users will be able the check the ladder rankings, in addition to their own and their friends. (Match History, Achievements, Most Played Race, etc.)
2) Diagrams of the tech-trees for the three races with description and details.

Our question to you is,
1) Would you love to have an application like this?
2) What other features would you desire?
3) What features would it need for you to consider it the ""essential"" tool for SC2 for both beginner and professional players?

I watch a lot FPVods of pro Starcraft2 players, and I notice that they're always on the move with the apm.
However there's some things that I don't exactly understand:
- By branching my focus onto an overlord drop right into the enemies main, wouldn't that divert more attention that would be more fruitful if I were to focus on the main battles? Main Army v Deathball.
- Why should I do zergling drops if they devalue my main army?

I just installed Starcraft II on my desktop. I had well above the minimum system requirements to play the game, but not quite the ""recommended"" system requirements. 

Anyway, while engaging in large battles, something odd happens. Things that look like bolts of lightning shoot across my screen, sometimes obscuring my vision for just a moment, sometimes several seconds. If I'm fighting a protoss, blue lightning appears. If zerg, red. If terran...who knows! Haven't faced a terran yet.

Does anyone else have this problem?

tl;dr: Graphics glitch appears as lightning shooting across my screen. Que passe?

edit: I updated the drivers as much as possible, it didn't fix. Chances are my graphics card can't handle some aspect of the game play. Also, I turned all the settings to low, to no avail. "	t5_2qspc	True

1288187909.0	dx60j	Sigh, Terran..... 	-Authority-	17	10	54	"I've been wondering for a while now why 99.9% of all games played against terran, regardless of size (1v1 2v2 3v3, hell 4v4) all i see from Terran is Mass Marine/Marauder Bio Ball. I figured the higher i got in leagues and ladders (solid plat now, finally :/ )  i'd see more crazy tactics and attacks that require some finess. All i've actually seen is the standard opening, standard wall off, and mass MM.

I'm not Raging or QQ'ing, i'm just curious why so many other unit's fall upon deaf ears. Terran have such cool units, imo, but i feel like vs. any zerg/protoss late game, they're just pointless, and die within seconds. Every once and a while i'll see Quick Banshees (easily countered as zerg) or Thors thrown into the mix, and unless they're 2/2 at minimum, they die with seconds to roaches / mass muta / etc etc. 

Just wanted some opinions/ideas on the subject.

Now that SC2 has been released I am ready to start casting again.


So reddit I come asking for your help. With my low activity I have no recent replays to cast. Do any of you have a replay you would like casted? Please send it to me at spookycast@yahoo.com. I will be starting back casting tonight so expect new videos this weekend.

Thanks in advanced

P.S. 

For those of you who don't know me i'm Spooky. My youtube channel is all about helping players get better at SC2. I cast all level games talking about strategy, builds, and simple tricks that any player can use to improve there game. I don't just focus on the big names like TLO and Idra, I cast replays to show the average player making average mistakes. My view is you can't learn from the best when you are making different mistakes.

1273231138.0	c10qo	An Idea for sharing Replays with each other. :D	Masternova	8	1	8	"#So I was thinking about how to easily share replays with people that would be easy, instant, and effortless. I have come up with something.

#Things you will need.
1. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MjY1NDQ5)
2. [Junction](http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/Junction.zip)
3. Starcraft 2 (I hope you have this)
3. Not to be afraid of command prompt

#Now, first step is to install Dropbox. [Easy enough.](http://imgur.com/pVjhr.jpg)

#Next, open up the rar that contains Junction.exe and [place it into system32](http://imgur.com/9pnwD.jpg) (Don't worry. It is from microsoft. [Go and download it from the main page if you want](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx))

#Next, open up in separate windows your [Replay folder and your dropbox folder.](http://imgur.com/6ZRRD.jpg) They are found here:
    XP
        C:/Documents and settings/*username*/My Documents/Starcraft II beta/Replays/
        C:/Documents and settings/*username*/My Documents/My Dropbox/
    Vista/Windows 7
        C:/users/*username*/Documents/Starcraft II beta/Replays/
        C:/users/*username*/Documents/My Dropbox/

#Once those are opened, open up Command prompt. In the start menu, [it should be under Accessories.](http://imgur.com/X9Rsz.jpg)

[In it, type](http://imgur.com/YSb5H.jpg) 
##cd
 and then drap the ""Shared folder"" from the dropbox folder into the window and hit enter. It should look like one of these:
    cd ""c:/users/*username*/Documents/My Dropbox/Shared folder/""
or
    cd "" ""c:/Documents and settings/*username*/My Documents/My Dropbox/Shared Folder/""

#After that, type ""Junction Multiplayer"" and drag the ""Multiplayer"" folder into it from the the Replays folder of Starcraft 2 (If you do not have this folder, create it). [It should look like this](http://imgur.com/oqxSD.jpg):
    junction Multiplayer ""c:/Documents and settings/*username*/My Documents/Starcraft II beta/Replays/Multiplayer/""
or
    junction Multiplayer ""c:/users/*username*/Documents/Starcraft II beta/Replays/Multiplayer""

#Now all saved Replays will be sent to that folder. 

#The next step is to share your dropbox with someone. I propose that everyone here has one big repository or something where we can all sync them that way, but it can also be done between just two people and such. 

#[To sync the folder with other people](http://imgur.com/q2vSa.jpg), you or someone else *namely the repository account that I spoke of* simply has to right click on the Multiplayer folder that is in the Shared folder and go to dropbox - Sharing options and to add everyone who has it to the sharing list.

#I wish to make this an automated process, but I only thought of this today so I thought I would share. Tell me if anyone wants to test it with me and such. I will be happy to share (Though I have nothing for I am a lowly copper rank) and to see the amazing replays that you all have to offer."	t5_2qspc	True

Micro-ing focused units to withdraw from battle was very important. From the videos I've seen so far, it seems like micro-ing in sc2 is more focused on groups of units and taking advantage of map ridges.

In early game, clearly micro-ing each unit is very important but later in the game it doesn't seem all that important. what are your thoughts?

Expansions: in war3 you'd want to expand around T2 after/during a battle. So far in sc2 it looks like expanding to your 'natural' takes place very quickly. Any tips on expanding timing?

My online gaming background is mostly in MMORPGs, so this is a completely new genre to me, and I feel very lost.  There's just so much information that I feel I need to absorb to even learn the very basics of this game and stand on my own two feet, and it just seems like a huge barrier of entry into the game.

While I know practice will be sure to help out, one of the biggest questions I have are what exactly do I practice, and how do I practice?

I've taken a look at liquidpedia's site for protoss strategy, Protoss being my race of choice, and while there is a lot of detailed information on there, there's just so much I need to account for BEFORE I even pick one of the 20 different opening build orders that are recommended, and it just seems so overwhelming.

If anyone can give me some pointers, what factors I should just ignore until I get better, what I should practice from the very beginning, things about SC2 you wish you knew when you first started playing, etc.  All will be very welcome.

I picked up SC2 before right in its release and stopped early in the second season(never even laddered, just lobby games by then). And so, I've recently picked up HotS and will first go into the campaign and such before I think of laddering, to get some skills back up again.

Anyway, my question is, what's the current meta/standard builds in the game? Units, what's considered good against what, and also what are the new considered good unit composition and bad ones that worked before? Used to play random btw :D"	t5_2qspc	True

I've been silver/gold rank in WoL. With the release of HoTS, I'm intrested in playing more and improving my game. So I got a couple of questions:

1. I have problems with macroing. When I'm out attacking, I forget to continue spreading creep and injecting larvae on my hatcheries. Do you have any tips on how to combine attacks and keeping an eye out on your hatcheries? I'm using control groups (putting queens and hatcheries in 1 control group), but when I'm going to inject while I'm attacking, my army gets decimated.

2. I could be wrong here, but it seems to me Zerg hasn't received a buff with the release of HoTS? Terran got widow mines, Protoss got oracle's/tempests, etc.

3. I have problems with decisions. I don't know when I should really attack and when I shouldn't, so I give my opponent too much time to get a big army or to tech up. Any tips on this?

Having trouble with macroing and all, should I switch races? Since Zerg really needs decent macroing to be good, I'm not sure if this is the race that suits me (even though it's my favorite one).

I want to start SC2 from the ground up.		9	1	4	"I'm almost completely new to the whole thing cept I've played and loved the SC / Brood War and WC3 / TFT campaigns. Never played online 'cause I wasn't interested. Not a ""gamer"" at all until a while ago when I picked up DOTA and got addicted. Playing at a pretty decent level ATM.

DOTA is amazing but it's a little stressful 'cause you depend on a team and the community is not only bad but also unavoidable since the game forces interaction upon you. In short, I want to play a game where I'm the only factor that matters and where people hopefully stfu and just play. 

I've been following the SC2 scene since beta and I'm subscribed to everything Day[9], but only as a spectator. Weird but heh, the game's fun to watch.

I better cut off to the questions:

1) Is Brood War worth picking up again for practice provided I can still run it on a modern PC? I'll have to save money for the game and I wouldn't mind replaying.

2) Did Blizzard issue some kind of bundle so it's worth picking up the expansion as well?

3) Does the game have a healthy ladder / comp scene?

4) Are the WOL / HOTS campaigns fun? Hey, that matters too.

5) Is the game balanced? Is HOTS balanced?

6) Is it worth downloading that kind-of-a-test client thing from the Blizzard website?

7) Is the community alright? The DOTA community really took a toll on my sanity, I need a break.

Dennis started his caster career in the german ESL_TV studio but became independently with his Channel TakeTV on twitch.tv .

When WoL began he started streaming his Laddergames and called it BecomeAPro , to teach new Terran players how to play , what to do, and what not to do.
Now he started a new try by beginning with HotS and hopefully getting the league he wants to be.
Denns is someone who formed the E-sports Scene and i woudn't say just in germany. For his long commitment we should give him something back. Even if the stream is mostly german i hope you can enjoy it as much as i do and cheer for Dennis. He deserves it!

I know I need to get back to remembering how to drone properly, get a feeling for proper scouting and the new timings of new strats that have come out lately, also get to understanding any new changes in the meta, along with finding and re-testing my unit comps, timings and BO's for that matter. It just feels very overwhelming (fun, interesting, but overwhelming) and I'd like some advice on whether this is how I should be thinking of getting back into the game, of if there's something I'm missing or not taking into account properly.

He likes the maps where you're separated and have more of a corner of the map type spawn. Whereas I prefer we both spawn next to each other in one large base. I also hate when our one large base has multiple ramps. I think the one base idea gets rid of the 2 Zerg 6 pool or double bunker rush or double cannon rush. The cheese stuff that you see in 2v2 is avoided because it's one ramp to wall off. Much easier IMO.

On battle.net I am known as RuneK.

Next week on Monday I will be hosting a Bronze2Gold 2v2 tournament for all those leagues to enter. Later that week I will be holding a 2v2 tournament for Plat2Masters. I will stream and cast the whole event. I will do this every week until I find a reason not to. I have support from a small group of people, as this is my first tournament I am holding. I hope to have about 4 casters, likely 2 for this tournament every time I hold it.

If I find that people are interested and want to join and/or watch I will eventually hold a cash prize for such a tournament. As it stands there is still a chance to win a cash prize for people who win multiple times as per the rules.

Please review the rules and provide feedback. Please join, please watch. I feel 2v2 is something that can be legitimized and I hope to take it far, even having ""pro"" teams. I want to make that happen.

I have a chance to have sponsors for this event but I need to prove to them that people are interested in such an event. If I can get that interest, I can offer larger prize pools.

Soon I hope to have custom maps made just for this tournament (that may catch Blizzard's eye for the ladder, who knows?) but most importantly offer a fun and balanced map.

This is incredibly important to me. Thank you for your time.

I have a close friend who is currently in boot camp, and thus pretty isolated from the world from what I hear. She was really sad she couldn't make it to MLG Anaheim with me, so I was collecting two sets of autographs during the event (one for myself and one for my friend). I got four autographs during the event (Grubby, Day9, DJWheat, and Husky), but I wish I had gotten more (spent too much time watching matches and was way too timid about coming up to some players because they looked busy or were buying food, etc.).

Thus, I would love it if people who know/are pro players or casters could contact me (probably by reddit pm or something?) and we could work out where we could get an autograph for her. Especially (but definitely not limited to) anyone who can contact Team Liquid, because I know she especially wanted an autograph from TLO but he couldn't make it to Anaheim.

She can currently only receive letters or postcards so I was thinking I could get autographs on normal sheets of paper that I could send her so she could have them during boot camp and I know those would help her get through the whole thing a lot easier.

tl;dr: Friend is isolated from the world, really loves sc2, hoping I can get some more autographs for her.

1328598129.0	pee18	Night Owl Brawl Tournament Bonanza coming soon! Fun available for everybody! ♥	kravhen	7	0	3	"Greetings r/starcraft2!

The name’s Kravhen. I run the Night Owl Brawl tournaments, a regular tourney I started in 2012 for people who play late, or perhaps they are done with other z33k tourneys that typically occur earlier. They’ve always been streamed and casted and we’ve had some good fun until now. The next edition, Night Owl Brawl #12, is here: http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5351-kravhen-s-night-owl-brawl-12. You can also subscribe to the Chronic Facture tourney group to keep up with the night owls and other tournaments hosted by my clanmates.

But on this post’s main announcement!

Due to popular demand and the desire to celebrate the 15 first editions of the night owl brawl, I will be organizing a few special edition tournaments to spice things up and have some competitive fun. Here are the ideas so far, along with the links to their tournament page. PLEASE NOTE that the dates, times, rules and most things are tentative for now; that is, every detail is subject to change but this should give you all an idea of what’s coming up!

**1. LOWER LEAGUE SWAG TOURNAMENT:**
[http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5455-night-owl-brawl-lower-league-swag-edition](http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5455-night-owl-brawl-lower-league-swag-edition)

This tournament came into existence because many lower league players have complained that they like playing in night owl tourneys, but they aren’t having fun if they’re getting smashed by diamonds and masters all the time. Bronze, Silver and Gold leaguers, this is your time to shine! Ideas for prize include the possibility of coaching! Come play and showcase your lower league creativity! If the tournament is casted, it’ll also give players the chance to check the VODs afterwards and see how they can improve.

**2. 2V2 TEAMS TOURNAMENT:**
[http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5454-night-owl-brawl-2v2-teams-edition](http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5454-night-owl-brawl-2v2-teams-edition)

Self-explanatory. People sometimes brought their friends, hoping to play against each other in the later stages of the tournament for added epicness, so I figured, why not let friends be friends? Thus, the 2v2 tournament is born. Note that you can sign up teams of up to 3 players. This means you can be up to 3 in a team, but you will only send 2 players at a time for each match obviously. 3v3 and 4v4 may be chaotic most of the time, but 2v2 can be very competitive and very fun, so there it is! Extra reason of allowing 3 players per team is if someone doesn’t show up, the 2v2 team still functions.

**3. CLANS &amp; BUDDIES TOURNAMENT (TEAM SERIES):**
[http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5352-night-owl-brawl-1v1-clans-buddies-edition](http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5352-night-owl-brawl-1v1-clans-buddies-edition)

1v1 team series! What is that, you say? For those not familiar with the format, this tournament works almost exactly like a 1v1 tournament, except you sign up teams of 3 players. Each team sends in 1 player to fight the opposing team’s player. Winner stays for the next match (if Best of 3 or 5), loser must be switched out for another player of that team. A player who lost is “dead” and cannot play again in the same series. instead This format is great for buddies, cliques and of course clans who want to get their crew’s name out there through a competitive 1v1 tournament. So bring your squad and come play!

Alright, so if anyone has any questions, if you would like to sponsor a tournament, cast a tournament, or help in any way, send me a message ingame @ Kravhen.736 or by email at Kravhen@gmail.com."	t5_2qspc	True

Hi guys!

I'm Brazilian and I'm replaying the campaign right now. But I'm facing again this old problem I would like to solve before HotS is out.
I bought my SC2 copy in Brazil, so I have to play it in Portuguese or Spanish (my account is blocked for English/Korean/etc copies). I like Brazilian voice-acting, but as a fan of SC1's voice acting, I downloaded Starcraft II in English, got into the Campaign folder, copied the file enUS.SC2Assets, changed its name to ptBR.SC2Assets, pasted it over my own Campaign folder and voilà... Starcraft 2 in English.

So what is the problem? Problem is, this is just a gimmick. Some things doesnt work right:

1) SOME of the lines are still in Portuguese. Having Tychus or Horner starting to speak Portuguese in the middle of an English conversation is awkward;

2) The lip-sync is ruined. Actually, it is synced for the Portugueses version; not only lips are altered, but also dialogue timing.
Unit quotes are perfect.

Although this (ironically) could fit better in r/firstworldproblems, it really spoils the fun for me sometimes. Can anyone help me?

PS: r/starcraft couldn't do it :(

**EDIT: Ok guys! I found relocaliser that works 100% fine. I've already tested it. Uninterrupted Robert Clothworthy time, here I go!**  http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=283919"	t5_2qspc	True

Season 5 I've decided to take the game a bit more seriously and that means picking one race and sticking with it.

Does anybody know any good VODs/Builds that will allow me to get my head around playing Toss or just advice in general?

I played a few league games and was placed into bronze. After reading guides and watching mechanics videos for a couple of days I know what I should be doing and just need practice adapting and executing these as zerg. I guess you're not supposed to learn in league because you can dig yourself into a hole as far as rankings go (but if I don't really care should i continue to play in bronze anyways?), and so far with custom games that arent ranked, there isn't any type of skill notifier when you search so I've been destroyed by a master rank, and 2 platinum ranks which doesnt even allow for me to have a chance. So if anyone around the bronze/silver rank would like to have friendly practice games in order to improve our skills id love to be added to a friends list, or if you have any advice about this let me know please!

Edit/ SCVs are hard because you need a lot of infestors to keep an SCV parasited long enough to complete a command center, Protoss is much easier because of course you only need to begin warping in a Nexus, which I managed and uploaded [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZUItNcmS7U&amp;fmt=18)."	t5_2qspc	True

Then he made only Dark Templars and  Archons for the first like 20 minutes and continued to complain that Zerg was overpowered. After I beat him he kept messaging me saying that Zerg was overpowered and then I checked the score. He was banking over 2k resources and was supply capped for 2;36 a played with 120 APM and he managed to get into masters 4 TIMES. How is that even possible?"	t5_2qspc	True
