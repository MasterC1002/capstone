1369872557.0	1fay6t	Shy's Ryze setup	Memorize21	93	8	8	"Yo Dyrus,

In your video-analysis of the 2nd game vs Korea you said the runes/masteries you thought Shy was using but after looking at it they were different. And since you want to try or pick up Ryze I thought I'd give you a heads-up of what he used.

In your vid you said he used 9-0-21 masteries and MS quints + mana blues. But after looking at his lvl 1 stats he was using the following setup:


Masteries: 

0-9-21 Because of the following reasons:

He had 0 AP at lvl 1 which makes it impossible to have 9-0-21.

He had 482 health at lvl 1 which is 36 higher than his base (30 from Veteran scar + 6 per level from Durability)

He also had 345 MS which means he had 335 + 3% MS from the Nimble mastery.


Runes: 

Hybrid or Mpen reds

Flat armor yellows

Flat mr blues

Flat mana quints

Because at lvl 1 he had +16 armor and mr, which means +12.7 armor from yellows + 3.5 from masteries (=16.2), +12.1 mr from blues and 3.5 from masteries (=15.6), makes both rounded down +16.

And the mana quints because he had 627 mana at lvl 1. Ryze's base mana is 305, +200 from saph crystal makes 505, +10 from Expanded Mind mastery makes 515, 627-515=112. So we have 112 'unexplained' mana. Flat mana Quints are 37.5 mana, 37.5 x 3 = 112.5

If I recall it correctly these were the exact runes/masteries he used for all his Ryze games EXCEPT the 1st game vs EU, there he ran MS quints.

Hope it helps you playing/picking up Ryze.

Goodluck in the next split!"	t5_2vtnv	True

---

I started watching you around the same time I played league, which is when you used to stream with around 200-500 viewers back in Hawaii, and I remember really enjoying watching you and listening to the music you played (Reminds me of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWCfm0EukkA  I'm sure you remember this track very well) I had a great time spending hours watching you back then. At that time I used to be around 800 elo in solo q. Slowly by watching you and trying my best to improve I slowly started rising, first it was bronze, then silver and then gold, and then I hit plat (when it was the highest) and in late s2 I hit diamond. I've been trying to q up with you since late s2 but failed really hard after many tries and got trolled by rainbow and ppl whos names I wont mention here... I just wanted to say that you helped me improve a lot as a player and a person, which drastically improved my quality of life, thank you Marcus or Dyrus whatever you personally identify with man. I would really like to meet you one day and that doesnt seem too hard since you hangout at events quite often we'll see how that goes. 

----

Knowing you...you probably didnt read that whole thing hehehe, but thats ok at least theres a chance that you will at least get part of what I'm trying to say here. 

---

Other questions: Why are still shy..doesnt make sense?
I wonder what name you identify with in your own head...like when you're mentioning your self in your head..do you call yourself dyrus or marcus or what?

After i watched the froggen interview about how his team is performing much better which was a big part due to having a chef, i decided to once again try to try to contact a team to cook for.
(link to froggen interview)

 (if link doesn't work interview starts at 2:50:20)
I decided to post here to hopefully get noticed by you guys.

Basically i am looking for a team to cook for and after seeing the teams eating habits i feel like having a cook would benefit you guys to a great extent.
If you would like some more information i have a thread with pictures about it here.

I love way to many animes to list, just because I list a few doesn't mean they're the best. I got a lot of hate and demeaning remarks like oh ur retarded or oh ur the best vice versa.

honestly I just say clannad cause it was one of my favorites if we're going to go deep down there are great series like code geass or claymore or berserk and even the mainstream naruto or bleach. I like all of them but in the end the type moon animes and games probably got my top 5-10

2.Thought I would make a thread where everyone could pile all their questions for Dyrus about TSM's week 1 games against CLG, Vulcun &amp; Dignitas.

My question for Dyrus is how do you think you played in your games against, 1. HotshotGG 2. Sycho Sid 3. Kiwikid


hotshot forgot runes like a derp but it's ok cause his team will carry him no matter what until he starts picking nasus or singed.

sycho sid needs more experience.

kiwi kid is going with the full retard strat where you pick singed and still do a lot. something I would of liked to do my entire league life if reginald didn't call singed trash.

kiwi kid has a wide champion pool and strong mechanics, he will be a one of the best top laners hands down in a few months or even weeks. but he will still lack the experience.

my experience vs him he overextended as kayle, then as singed he had double buff and 2 kills on me from 2v1 lane so nothing I could do. I also could of outplayed at one point and got a double kill but I didn't have vision on crumbzz so it was impossible to predict.

jayce/kennen is a better synergy with karthus


xin zhao is useless if you don't get any early ganks off try to drop xin 

zhao


sona can get ignite


vayne can get cleanse (if you know the enemy has cc)


good team comp, more then 1 threat other then vayne to give room 

in team fights.


xin zhao should consider buying oracles mid game and telling team to 

4/5 man roam if organized team.





sidenote: elo advantage for this and last game


karthus should not stand in side brush level 1


vayne is afk needs to help xin zhao with wolves





karthus/riven does wraiths (good)

vayne/sona late to lane, just needs to passive farm vs double golems 

graves janna (lane bully) try to survive and cs.


sona should max heal




just as I type that sona gets fb'ed (need to farm at tower)




bot lane is screwed again proceed to trying to farm at tower and 


begging for jungler help.




kat is good vs karthus proceed to farming (doing a good job out csing)





don't gank karthus mid lane until lvl 4 if you are relying on karthus to 


wall.




don't buy boots on riven/ rush brutalizer/black cleaver/ place ward 

when entering lane vs naut/shen gank combo (high cc)


freeze lane and ask for jungler ganks (thin up wave before ganking)


riven is winning in cs (gj)


vayne should max Q/W/E in that order


bot is screwed proceed to farm wolves and beg for jungler to gank 

lane. pink ward ganking through lane (enemy has full ward coverage)


jungle did good job using kat spells.


don't level up W on riven max Q.


don't trade when the enemy has tons of creeps that will trade back 

on autos.


bot lane should consider going 9/21 with hp quints and just farming all 

game to not get dominated.





riven kills shen 7:59 tell team shen is 6 and has ult. continue to 

pressure top and ward everywhere.


shen ults bot and counter ganks, gets nothing out of it (good)

shen tp's back top (no dragon pressure) proceed to abusing shen with 
no ignite.

karthus should get exhaust over barrier. tell team to man up and get 

oppurtunties to use karthus ult.



complain that your bot lane is losing with karthus ult potential ask 

jungler to babysit bo and pin kward brush.

maxing w on riven first is not that good max q or have lvl 2 e

10:54 good gank on kat mid somehggow dies to karthus xin with flash 

10 seconds away.





11:10 minutes into the game and karthus ult still has not been used, 

use communication to steal kills with karthus ult for mad bank $$$



stack doran blades 3-&gt;pd/berserkers greaves max W so you won't be 

useless with 25 cs to 100. continue to farm all game because graves 

is as big as doublelift.





kat dies again/ karthus can carry, spam chat that you have level 11 

ult and you will take half a bar if your team mans up.





13 minutes into the game, have xin pressure top and move on to bot 

side of the map and do dragon.



don't start blue when karthus is clearing waves (can be stolen by 

janna tornado or graves ult if warded)

karthus flashes away gets double kill anyways. (look to suicide in and 

flash in when oppurtunties arrise.

riven karthus carrying the shit out of this game

don't build 2nd dorans on riven when way ahead proceed to full retard 

bt/black cleaver/ last whisper/ GA build

xin zhao 20 cs behind jarvan playing the support role to much, be 

more selfish.


use smite whenever it's up unless before dragon.

after the 4 kills mid at 14:00 proceed to do dragon it is free.

after dragon buy group bup and siege all outer turrets that are still up 

with 3/4 people while having the remaining useless players (vayne) to 

cover other lanes and afk farm)



midgame have vayne free farm against shen (vayne counters shen in 

split push)

have bot lane go full hp quints cloth 5 to avoid feeding.

xin should stop at spirit stone and build into locket/aegis/spirit of elder 

lizard or golem -&gt; randuins/bulwark

keep in mind vayne will always lose early game so play passive to 

survive through early game unless you're draven.

at 15-20 minute mark laning phase ends, play to get turrets/buffs.

when low mana on karthus dont' turn e on so you can spam q unless 

you're going to die anyways.

karthus has the mechanics of a diamond player

early lizard item on xin is not bad if ahead and snowballing.

if your cs is below your enemies consider playing in a bot game and 

practicing csing for hours to improve mechanical skill. (same with 

jayce e/q combo)


after getting perfect cs go back to normal/ranked then slowly learn 

trading.

play 1 champion and repeat rinse until diamond 1.

buy oracles on support when winning.

vayne should consider not smoking weed when playing league of 

legends

try to use karthus wall on multiple people/ or to zone depending on situation instead of w on tank.

always remember to use summoners during important fights when 

needed.

The person who hacked my computer proceeded to call me on skype over and over, laughing about how he took my account, and that he now has access to my 97 champions and however many skins.  He said he would give me my account back for RP. I already messaged customer support, and got a typical generic, autoresponse. I wanted to get the word out to anyone within riot so that maybe I could get my account back. I'm on a different computer because i'm too afraid to turn my computer on. He would turn on my webcam manually and call me a faggot and laugh about how I lost all of my money. I'm scared and just want some help. I'm a diehard TSM fan so that's why I messaged you. I have a concussion and feel awful and just can't deal with this shit. I'll provide more info in the morning.

BIG EDIT: This Xinsy fellow gave me my account back and talked to me on skype for a while. He told me his friend hacked the account and gave it to him. Not sure why he added me on skype after that though. Apparently he felt bad and gave me my account back. His friend apparently has done this to 100+ people. He said they RAT people and then sell any account they find of significant value. He told me he could have sold my account for $130 if he wanted to. After that, he told me that the RAT was still there after having me connect to teamviewer, and he was unable to erase it. He said he could get his friend to erase it but his friend didn't want to. Also, he got pissed and almost took the account back because he said that I got one of my friends to DOX him through his twitter, he tried to send me proof of it but I didn't receive it. I feel like this is a big problem, and I dont want this to happen to anyone else in the future. He had complete control of my webcam and basically my entire computer. He uninstalled league and i'm still in the process of getting it back. At this point, my main concerns are, I have ip spent on stuff that I didn't want to spend it on. I want to get rid of that. (It was spent on runes). Furthermore I would like to know how I, or any other gamer can prevent this from happening to them. Thank you everyone for reading this and your support.

After watching his interview with Travis at MLG Dallas, I felt like I was watching an entirely different person. He dominated the interview professionally, giving clear and intelligent information. He seemed as if he was thinking logically, rather than speaking with his emotions. He seemed as if he was finally confident and comfortable with himself and his profession, so that he could silence his nay-sayers once and for all.

 Oh thanks!
Yeah, I remember that game, it was pretty funny. Dyrus was on Elise and facing a Diana if I remember correctly. ClakeyD was on our team too. The two of them have been super nice since champ select. I was last pick and Clakey let me have Warwick in the first place, props to him for letting me have a chance.
And Dyrus is by far the nicest pro I've played with so far. Not only was he nice during the game, but when I was hesitating adding him after game, finally deciding not to do so because of the number of adds he has per minute, he was the one who added me. And on top of that he complimented me a lot on stream in front of thousands of people.
Best experience I've had in this game so far. Really enjoyable.

What a subscriber emote only is an emote, like Kappa or FrankerZ, but only those who are subscribed to Dyrus can type. For instance I am a subscriber to CosmoWright so if you have noticed occasionally I have typed [BONK](http://i.imgur.com/F5gkgC3.jpg) in chat but almost no one else can. that's just one example.




Anyway, where do YOU the viewers come in? I'll be taking suggestions for emotes in the next 24 hours. Just link them here and I'll save them on my computer. What I play to do is get a pool of about 15 or more possibilities and then I will have the mod team narrow them down to about 7-10 and then I will create a poll where you guys can vote on which emotes will make it. The poll will not be the final word but will be the biggest factor into which emotes are chosen. I will also link them all to dyrus himself and if he wants specific ones, that say disagree with what the poll says, then we'll be going with what he wants and not the poll obviously.




So as I said, if you have suggestions either link them here or if you don't want others to see you can PM me either here or on twitch. My twitch username is Zylo003. I check both regularly.




Thanks!



EDIT: I suck at formatting so hopefully this doesn't look too bad.



EDIT: A lot of people are asking for something like ""FABULOUS"" written out as an emote.

You shouldn't feel bad and don't worry about disappointing your fans because the true fans will always love you no matter what! In my eyes and in the eyes of many you are one of the best top laners in NA if not the world, you can be sad for a bit but don't forget that there are thousands of people out there who are supporting you.

First when **Reginald** went male dominance all over **Chaox** and said he could bench him from the team if he *'wanted to'*. Then **Xpecial** posted a vlog about shoutting at you for your 2v1 performance, which we all know from your stream is your weakness (with top lane ganks especially). So I have some questions, even if you don't want to publicly answer at least they'll be thought provoking! :)

* Do you feel like your team is not being encouraging or taking advantage of your strengths in 1v1 by putting you in 1v2?

* Xpecial then posted another vlog today and talked about the potential of benching a team mate, What do you think about someone being benched?

It seems like Chaox, Reginald and Xpecial are the only ones who voice their opinions publically on Youtube so I was curious of how you feel.

you can take ignite on support/exhaust vs assassins like zed


stack armor vs this team (game 1)


lux should go ignite vs most matchups but user prefered.


vayne should start dorans blade (can go lifesteal quints too)


when spreading out level 1 with organized team make sure one person watches mid also point defense is a weak level 1, always look to invade with jayce/lux cc into red since enemy is lee sin.


1:38 taric vayne missed double golems


don't be afraid to harass zed he has no potions to sustain vs you level 1/2. every he goes for punish him, avoid ranged q.


1st blood 3:54 taric needed to ward tribrush


4 minutes into the game jarvan is 0/0/0 gank top/mid or through lane bot with double buff. 


make sure smite is on cooldown before ganking.




if you know you're already dead don't waste flash, save it for next time


buy atleast 1 dorans blade on vayne/jayce bot lane should be crushing


max armor aura vs ad on taric. instead of stun


vayne max w or e vs double brusiers. max q for harass vs ranged.


zed can be a hard counter to jayce ask for ganks, buy ninja tabi/1 dorans blade don't build vamp scepter.


jarvan build spirit stone into sunfire vs this team. build only up to aegis and build locket


in custom game practice jayce e q combo over and over until you are comfortable with it


jarvan still 0/0/0 9 minutes in. switch to hecarim or someone who benefits farming jungle for a long time such as 

mundo, or gank more


jarvan gets 2 kills should buy before going bot next  time but turns out well anyways.


vayne needs to level up w and buy dorans blade/shield vs double bruisers/ taric needs dorans shield vs double 

brusiers.


lux is csing very well very little room for improvement at this level.


lux jarvan gets greedy for a kill gets double killed by talon, avoid tower diving unless big wave or low enemy hp.


jayce kills zed 12:30 becareful of going in if zed had w can negate jayce power slam. also zed had flash in 10 

seconds, vs good opponents should be careful going all in vs zed.


bot lane is pretty much lost/ build two doran blades on vayne and avoid boots. build pd/botrk or pd/bloodthirster 

instead of rushing vampscepter/boots 2.


14:00:14:30 to much pointless running around, bot is pushing, ask for help from jungler to push lane out and 

farm current jungle. 


avoid staying around with low hp when enemy casters are nearby.


lux should build chalice and then move on to core items instead of athenes grail, only 1 ap caster enemy. needs 

boots 2.


jarvan should save ult for when enemy safeguards or flashes 17:29


jayce needs tabi/dorans blade for surviving vs zed,


jayce should get blue with lux and 3 man mid/top while other two hold tier 2 or mid turret.


18:30 into game team should roam as 4 and let vayne solo farm bot, recognize that the poke in this team is very 

strong while having engage and disengage.


lux should avoid building zhonyas if possible and get void staff/deathcap asap to carry team harder.


all players should get atleast 1 dorans item as a first item if possible because of efficiency. (player preference)


jarvan should go locket vs mass ad brusiers/and stop at aegis over bulwark. building randuins or tabi and spirit of 

the ancient golems is perfect here.


jayce should go cdr boots for more poke/damage output.


taric should build sunfire cape along with jarvan for efficient anti ad brusier dps


game ended before jayce last whisper -&gt;GA


lux should go voidstaff&gt;deathcap in most cases until 3 items.


jarvan still needs boots 2 at 27:15


vayne should really build 1 dorans blade for the entire game.


taric frozen heart is a perfect choice for this game


jarvan did not need merc threads vs this team/ or jayce but it's still semi useful.


zhonyas becomes a strong item mid late game vs zed/lee/lis


jayce does not need to buy oracles


29:49 jarvan should be running instead of laughing/auto attacking jax baiting for jayce/lux


jayce dies.


enemy lee sin picks up jarvan spree (bad not worth)


vayne should really have taric stick around for most of the game and look for combo wall stuns with team.


vayne should just afk farm after dying 5-10 times and split push bot 123 cs at 31:27 minute mark.


send vayne bot when dragon is down, send vayne top when dragon is up. try to force 4v4 while vayne split 

pushes.



thornmail is probably the best buy in this game next to frozen heart.





end game conclusion. group up lux/jayce sooner to siege mid have 1 for disengage split push with vayne, jarvan 

needs to make use of early ganks.

Previously you had told me that:

&gt; Dyrus- If reginald ever mentions we should hire a chef you will be the first one to know. I find it highly unlikely right now though I do agree a healthy diet would improve overall just everything

Immediately after I posted my previous thread, my girlfriends grandma started having serious complications with her diabetes and other health issues. So I went to Hawaii to help my girlfriend take care of her grandma. This is important because the job I was working at couldn't keep my position open for me until I was back (understandably so), and they have obviously since filled my position. So currently, I am jobless.

Today, my parents came into my room and told me that I was wasting my life trying to get involved with e-sports, and that I was so lazy because I didn't have a job(I've been home from Hawaii for a week...). So I tried explaining to them that ever since I went to Korea and spent time with the starcraft brood war pros and coaches, that I wanted absolutely nothing more than to be a part of e-sports, in any way shape or form. They then told me that if that is the way I felt, and that I wasn't going to get a ""real"" job, then I couldn't live at home any more.

I have absolutely no where to live (unfortunately I cant live with my girlfriend as she is in Hawaii still), and I only have enough money for a short time in a shitty apartment, which i can't get anyway without a job. Some friends have offered to let me stay for a few days, but I would honestly rather not be a burden to them.

I'm not trying to play the ""pity"" card, but rather the ""urgency"" card, as I'm literally on the verge of being homeless.
 
Is there any way that you can talk to Reginald about having me cook for you guys? I hate to be so direct about it but at this point now, I don't exactly have the luxury of being able to wait for Reginald to realize you guys need proper meals rather than just junk food. To be even more direct and honest, I'm going to have to give up everything to continue to survive if i don't get a break of some sort. Nearly all professional athletes have private or team chef's and e-sports players and teams should be no different.

Hope to hear from you soon- Forfekte.

TL;DR- Got kicked out, no job, very little money, no place to stay.

EDIT- I decided to re add the pictures from my other article in case you forgot.

1376282194.0	1k6ru5	[RE:]Dyrus Sleepy Vlog	Skillzonlol	33	9	11	"TL;DR: Me rambling on about how Dyrus has changed my perspective on life in general.

Hi Reddit, I'm Jake/Ibrahim (lots of people online call me Jake). I'm 15 years old and come from New Zealand. I've been playing League for around almost only a year and a half now, on NA (recently transferred to OCE), and I'm around the Plat-Diamond ELO. I'm going to be completely honest with you, I was that pudgy-half Asian that really didn't belong to any group at primary and intermediate school.

I was just that Computer nerd that spent all his time learning to code/playing games. I was bullied for pretty much my last years of primary, intermediate and first year of high school. I started playing League because of Dyrus. A friend told me I looked like him/sounded like him. I was intrigued and then began my journey in League. Over the past year, TSM has been one of my few passions. I've used League to get out all the frustrations that I have in my life being brought up by my asian side, but always find a cooling sensation while watching a TSM member stream. I've always been a fan of Dyrus because I find so much of it relatable, plus I've always liked the vivid personality the TSM house always has. Ever since I watched Dyrus' stream I've been in somewhat the same 'moods' he is in and my personality kind of adapted to it. Even though this has happened, watching Dyrus has also inspired me to be motivated to do things in my life, this was one of the main impacts Dyrus has had on me, this also made me vow that one day, maybe at worlds I'll meet him.

Anyways, as being a fan of Dyrus I've been subbed to his stream for a long time. I'd spend nights watching his stream, not on just how to become a better top laner but just discussing issues between games. Whether it was those funny ""Dyrus"" moments which would keep me laughing on end, or just one hell of a play. Dyrus had latched on to me, and he let me into TSM and into his own personal life through Vlogs. Hearing him talk about his previous life issues always made me feel genuinely better. TSM has greatly shaped my personality and I wish them all the best in their future endeavours. In regards to League, I main Renekton, Rumble and for a short time, Elise. I pretty much follow everything Dyrus does and, so far it has worked out for me :)

Now in regards to this video; 
I'm going to be honest, ever since I reached out to TSM I've been seeing a common occurrence. Every single member goes through a rough time, not just in TSM but any of the current LCS teams. But no matter what Dyrus, you will bounce back. Just take a moment to realise that there are always going to be those people that just are full of themselves, but you have so much more than they do. You have a breathtaking personality from what I have seen, and your connection with the League of Legends community is outstanding. You always take everyones voice into consideration, and you're very grateful too. So just remember Dyrus, care for yourself too. Don't forget that. You've been with TSM for a year now, they know your emotions and they know your personality. So even if you do get mad, just remember that if you can control it to an extent, they understand. Even under all the heat and pressure. You've taught me to just carry on, so make sure you look after yourself and carry on too. Just don't overthink situations, and relax. Remember that you're always doing a good job by streaming. Keeping people company, entertaining and you just make a big difference. You may feel as if you're not by streaming, but make sure you know that you do. You're a truly awesome guy, and trust me I do watch all of your Vlogs ;)

1356026417.0	156ebs	Would appreciate your help on a school project on eSports for my A-Levels Dyrus! (just some questions)	I_Am_PwnD	28	8	2	"First off, let me give you some background: I'm 17, currently attending the last grade of high school and need to get a sort of interview for my special topic on eSports with a focus especially on the influence of Starcraft 2 and LoL due to them being the ""biggest"" games in eSports.

  So you may ask yourself, why do i ask you specifically? It's basically because I literally just found this subreddit and I saw that you answered all serious questions so far and I don't really think that a post in r/lol would get to the frontpage so it gets the attention of the proplayers.

I would be glad if you could answer this questions as good as you can, as it helps me out ENORMOUS. So here they are:

1.	How did you get into the Pro-Scene? Were you active on a competitive level in other games (if yes: which)?

2.	When did you realize that you are âabove the level of the average gamerâ?

3.	What does your family think about your job being a professional gamer? Have you ever been discriminated because of your job and most likely, passion?

4.	What do you think about the growth of eSports over the last 5 years (obviously with LoL being one of the major factors to it)
5.	What are the deciding factors for a professional gamer in order to be able to make a living off it? (Streaming, Tournaments/Sponsors etc)

6.	Gaming houses are currently seen as crucial to be able to keep up with top teams, do you agree with this? What do you think about it in general?

7.	We have seen Asian Teams winning many of the recent big events. Why do you think Asian Teams are beginning to overcome other regions?

8.	How does the average day of a Pro-Gamer look like?


Feel free to add a something if it seems important to you. Would also be very thankful if you could get any other proplayer to answer this too (as it is more context)

By the way, love your stream, keep it up! (Sorry for my poor formatting)

TSM is in kind of a slump now as we all know, they have had ups and downs many times along the line but always risen and brought us the joy of chanting ""T S M"" etc etc.

This is why we love you guys, for personalities and emotional roller coaster you bring us.

Lately (at least deducting from vlogs and game crib) you guys have a lot of internal tention, whenver something happens it was Chaox and now Xpecial fighting with Regi. Regi is frustrtated because his baby that is TSM is doing really bad, you guys are upset but keep quiet. You all know the issues but not all of you talk openly.

So in my humble opinion. This is very unhealthy environment. ReginaId is getting smashed by community, he is upset with the brand going bad etc, plus there is fans being utter shit and blaming all on him. Why don't you all, even beginning with you, start talking more?

You always talk about getting more focused and professional. Listening to your boss or leader is not professional. For any team to work u need cohesion (or w/e the word is) Everyone must give something to get the best results.

I know it may seem hard to force a meeting, not from Regis initiative, because I can suspect it will be like any other, YOU should step up, get OddOne talking, get Xpecial and yourself talking, not fighting but discussing, what is good and what is bad within the team, what your ideas plan, on starategies, getting communication working whatever you feel needs to be changed.

**Regi is under massive pressure and TSM is from what I see slowly falling apart. We do not want this as true fans, I only watch LCS for your matches and as I'm from EU I stay uip until 3-4 AM just to see you play while I'm half asleep.**

So don't take it away from us, force yourself, get more involved in the areas you haven't been before and save what you are passionate about and what we love, for the sake of the team and TSM.

I love all of you guys and don't want to see anyone go, it would break my fanboy hear (however lame it may sound)

Good luck!

**TL;DR: I really love TSM and I know you love it too Dyrone, if you don't want to see it go, you need to try and motivate your team to cooperate more, outside of the game, to get results in the game and get rid of the internal tention. Please read.**

I have never really looked into Gunnars before mostly because I wear prescription lenses, but I am needing new ones and I just found out that you can get Gunnar with a prescription, so I wanted to ask you some questions about them.

Do they really make as big a difference as advertised?

Do you get the fisheye effect after wearing them for a long time? that was one of the major concerns I read about when they first came out.

Does the amber tint have a big effect on color, or is it not so bad and easy to get used to.

Do the lenses get scratched up easily? I pretty much require anti scratch lenses or they get destroyed in a few months time.

I have also read that Gunnars tend to make far away objects more blurry, and details harder to make out, what is your experience with this?

Regardless, keep on keeping on, bro. I love watching you and the rest of TSM when you are on point, but it sucks to see you guys struggling here lately. Just keep in mind that you have tons of people rooting for you and that there are always ways to improve. :)

With Dyrus on the left, the matchups ended up being:

* Malphite versus Renekton
* Jayce versus Kha'Zix
* Shen versus Jayce

Were any of those supposed to be counterpicks? If not why didn't the enemy team select a counterpick for the opportunity to beat you in lane, considering you're first pick. Why does it seem like you're almost never counterpicked?"	t5_2vtnv	True
1366933842.0	1d4amh	Dear Master Dyrus		17	4	9	"Dear Dyrus, I'm gonna keep this short for your sake. 

I like to believe that I'm one of the biggest fan of yours. You're one of my favorite pro players aside from Scarra. 

I'm currently in Silver 1. It took me 55~ games to get to where I am. My biggest fear at the moment is settling down in Silver/Low gold. My LP points started settling, so I get around 13~LP per win now. I watch tourneys, streams, videos, read guides...etc. I cs, ward, take objectives etc. 
Anyways what I'm here for is, I'm scared of playing more ranked games. I'm starting to think that I belong in low gold. That's why I don't play ranked because I truly don't want to be in gold forever. 

What makes a Platinum/Diamond player so different from gold? I practiced my CS'ing so much in custom games, I even have a chart of how much CS I get at 12 minutes. I always aim to improve, but right now I have no clue what else to do.  

Could you just say something that would motivate me to play ranked games again? or something I could do that would make that silver played different than the rest. I see people who got diamond in 50 games, yet I'm only silver 1 with 80 LP.

I LOVE YOU DYRUS. EVEN IF YOU DONT REPLY."	t5_2vtnv	True

1365441019.0	1bxeyg	Dyrus do you have any tips to help me stay consistent and level headed while in ranked?	Drtolittle	18	3	12	"Hey Dyrus,   As many people on this subreddit I am a fan of you and your play style, especially because of your overall solid performances game in and game out. Unfortunately this is where I struggle (In ranked especially), I currently have around 500(blind pick) wins and Iâm trying to ease into ranked but I often get nervous and anxious which then leads to me making stupid moves that I don't usually make. So I would like to know if you have any pre game rituals or anything that you do during games to level yourself and get your mind back into beast mode. 

Also really looking forward to seeing you in the all-stars game! Iâm gonna have to go to the apple store and best buy to use their Pcâs to secure your spot  xD

I am here to see if I can get this post seen by Dyrus, so perhaps we can 1v1 for fun after the tourney. (He also owes me a friend request! :p)

We haven't really seen him too much in LCS as of late, only time I can really think of was CrsClg scrims. However I recently discovered that if you rush Botrk rather than Hextech on Jax, his presence in lane is insane. Obviously, this is coming from someone in Silver2 so my experience likely isn't the same as Diamond/Challenger so looking for your opinion on the matter.

(Also, Zephyr + PD on Jax = Max attack speed and boots become useless. But shh that's my secret)

his r now has mr/armor on passive ult removes armor/mr but gives double passive attack speed.

1364453167.0	1b5y14	I've followed Dyrus for a little more than a year now.	Novasight	15	2	2	"I have to say it's been quite the ride so far. I've seen him at his best and sometimes his worst. He makes mistakes just like anybody but he has the balls to admit to them and that is what separates a decent person and decent LoL player from a great one.

When I first watched Dyrus' stream I probably skimmed over it and shrugged it off. Quite a few months back though a friend of mine said something along the lines ""you have Dyrus' qualities when you speak and interact"" so I took another hard look. It clicked with me that Dyrus was just trying to do his best but still have fun while he streams. His general taste in music mirrors mine almost completely, his mannerisms in his voice and his reactions are pretty close to mine (example: the long drawn out ""fuuuuck duuuuude"") 

He also possessed things I didn't...like actual skill haha. He occasionally raged but he's tried to control it so I've been taking everything he says in since I started following him.

Because of you; Dyrus, I've stepped up my game. I made an account from scratch and practiced and practiced just randoming all the way to 30 then I took it upon myself to learn top lane champs, the ones you made guides on and even ones you don't play much of. 

Because of you; Dyrus, when I actually get to do top lane in ranked I sure as hell do the best I can and when I get a triple kill dunk with Darius or spam laugh as people chase my singed I always make the joke to my friend ""papa Dyrus taught me good.""

Because of you; Dyrus, I've learned to laugh off bad games, think hard about what I could have done better and try and do better next game.

Dyrus almost feels like a long lost brother to me. He has brought out the best in me, he makes me dream of reaching challenger just to have a chance to play a game or 2 with/against him or to even form a team and meet and challenge TSM as a whole. I still have a LOOOOOONG way to go and the league scene will probably die out long before I get there but it's worth a shot.

This may be another one of thousands of fan posts but I just felt I needed to say this with all the stuff that has been happening lately.

So here's to Dyrus, may he continue showing people how top lane should be done!

One thing that jumped out at me from those games was your early completion of Liandry's. In the past I believe it was considered odd to upgrade guise before even picking up a Rylai's since the damage spike wasn't too noticeable and you could just start working on a Zhyona's or Rabadon's instead. Did the recent fix to Dot ticks with Liandry's make it an optimal early pick up? Obviously it's stupid good on Rumble, but is it more effective than before and worth building early since the dot changes?

Nevertheless I am most of the time a really weak link in teamfights. I am not quite sure what to do, I feel like my damage is not that high(I mostly build offtank) and I'm not really able to kill their ADC in one go. It is not totally certain that I am actually the one losing it but it really feels that way, given the fact I am 0 W 3 L with renekton at the moment. So how do I play Renekton in teamfights?

1365244467.0	1bsgzg	Utility Vladimir (REapered)	Memorize21	9	0	10	"Why hello there Dyrus,

I was wondering what is your opinion on the sudden 'hype' of Utility (9-0-21, MoveSpeed Quints, CDR blues and flash&amp;ghost) Vladimir since REapered did it at OGN last week? And Sycho Sid also copied it at LCS this week.

These were the 'most likely' masteries that REapered used in OGN (based on his MoveSpeed and doranshield+pot start) http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#73K7vwdTZv761A

His runes were most likely MPen reds, armour yellows, CDR blues and MS quints. (based on his level 1 stats)

I can see it work in SoloQ vs low damage toplaners who you can dominate (Shen etc.) or champions with no gapcloser. But as soon as you face a gapclose champion (or any champion who can all-in you), don't you just melt early as Vlad with Utility? 

What I do like about Utility tree is that it allows you to start cloth+ward+4pots.

I understand that the Utility makes you scale even better into lategame with the MoveSpeed, SpellVamp, CDR and GP/10, but doesn't it make your laning fase harder on most matchups (compared to 9-21-0)?

1370704145.0	1fxfke	Question about no-ward openers (cloth5, dorans) and timing	DoctorAble	16	7	4	"What do you do when the lane pushes towards your opponent (ie you went aggressive but failed to force out or kill him) and you didn't start with a ward?

I played a game recently that went something like this:

* I was playing Cho'Gath top vs Jarvan IV
* I expected him to be aggressive early, so I started Cloth 5
* He went for a caster-line CS that I fought him over @ Lvl 2
* I won this exchange and should have killed him (I made a mechanical mistake)

Here I was in a weird position.  I ended up bullying when I expected the opposite and have a health/CS advantage.  I have no ward, and the lane was now pushed due to Cho'Gath AoE and minion aggro.  Jarvan IV used his potions, I can pressure his CS a little but not completely because the lane is frozen in front of his turret.

* Do I stay in lane and hope my current advantage keeps me safe? (this is what I did)
* Do I back and lose my advantage? (He pushes and probably ends up with more CS than me)
* Do I sit in the bush and wait for him to push it back a bit?

The end result was that I stayed in sight and got ganked 30-40 seconds later by their jungler, dying.  The lane then snowballed and I needed my jungler to more or less rescue me with a gank.  I ended up being more relevant than Jarvan later and won the game, but I did not do my job early.

What would Dyrus do?  I see that you've been playing a lot of Doran's Blade Kennen lately, so I think you should have some relevant experience (early aggression, no ward).  Thanks.

My problem is that I don't know how to execute it and go for the kill and i usually get ganked and by that time it's too late. Is there like a super secret method on knowing when to go? or do I just lack the knowledge/experience on how to win lane.	t5_2vtnv	True

Twist3dGam3r	9	0	5	"To start off, I would like to say that I own a pair of A40s that are just a few years old, not that this truly matters. Recently, I have wanted to stream a playthrough for a few friends of mine and I have come across some troubles using my astros.


The problem is that when streaming, I am unable to get the sound/music from the game to come through my stream. I am able to use my microphone perfectly fine however. I do believe this is some issue through stereo mix and USB headsets. Any advice or fixes would be appreciated.


And finally, my question to streamers is how exactly is their setup, set up? Those familiar with astros know there are about three ways to connect them(USB/Optical/Analog). For myself, I use the mixamp, connected through USB to my PC. To stream I use FFSplit. In advance, thanks to any help.

here is a quick example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaESjkukEA8 (this isn't me)
anyway, if you think you'd like to try this: 

-go to http://openitg.gr-p.com/ and download the beta 2 client

-Add in songs via song packs like Osu, here a couple good ones

You need to add them into the Songs folder and then into another folder, they already come in a folder so you just drag the folder into your ""Songs"" unless you want to rename the in-game folder name
You can find a collection of most here http://aaronin.jp/boards/viewtopic.php?t=5371 (you need to make an account for this page unfortunately, other places have packs, but this place has always been a solid database)
After that, start er' up and try it out. You may need to sync your OITG app as some computers are either really on sync 1st time or really off sync. you can auto sync it with F7 or 8 I think. Double tap enter when you select a song to add modifiers, I can only assume you would probably want speed mods as most default song speeds are pretty slow (to a rhythm game player)

2 days ago I dreamt I was in America (I'm not from America) for some sort of trip, but it was hard to stay there because I'm not so familiar with the place. In some way I found myself in a cinema, watching some LoL games with friends, and I was sitting in the row behind TSM. After I while I could talk with TheOddOne who explained me why Shyvana and Twisted Fate are such powerful champions (I don't know why those two champions). I also talked with Dyrus: I'm always thinking that I suck and that I will never get better, and Dyrus asked me what made someonde a pro, and the two ansers he wanted were: enjoying playing and knowing how to win (might be absolutely wrong, but still it was a dream), and he hugged me (probably because I was sad I can never go to Dyrus' booth at expos, where I heard he gives free hugs). I also told him that I'm afraid of playing because I hate ragers and the idea of playing bad, so he told me I should keep playing to get better (since he said that in a vlog).


That's all I can remember I think, I just wanted to share it with somebody.

2) My second goto champ is Olaf. The problem I'm facing with him is either being too aggressive or too passive. Since his e is so powerful, I've been putting myself in danger a lot more often but it always ends up fucking me over. What can I do for Olaf harass?

1357099569.0	15t2l3	Didn't show up the first time, so I'll try again: How to get your music info on stream without using a screen region!	y2kkmac	8	3	5	"Hello from one of your twitch.tv mods! Here's a Google Chrome extension that will let you get a music overlay for Xsplit even when you only have one monitor. You can also use this with two monitors and you won't have to use a screen region (this way you can have whatever you want on the second monitor and the music info will still be on stream). The only downside I see is that I noticed you use Firefox. As far as I can tell, there's no version for Firefox and I tried to use a program that's supposed to convert extensions but that didn't work.

WHAT THE EXTENSION DOES

It looks at your Pandora page open in Chrome, gets the song info, and saves it to a text file.
You can go into XSplit and get the text from that file and show it on your stream. No screen region needed.

Here's the page (thanks to untamed for making the extension): https://github.com/untamed0/Untamed-Now-Playing
There are two parts to the instructions: one for Chrome and one for Xsplit.

INSTRUCTIONS (please read these carefully):

Before everything: I noticed this script doesn't like being set up or having options changed when Pandora is open in Chrome. Just make sure the Chrome session you're working with is fresh and hopefully you'll be fine.

GOOGLE CHROME PART:

1. Scroll down, click the link under the ""Install the unpacked extension"" (the packed extension link doesn't work anymore because Google changed where you can get extensions from)
(some of the following instructions are from the github page)
2. Save that .zip and extract it somewhere you can keep it (I just have it in my Documents)
3. Open Google Chrome, click the button in the top right with the 3 horizontal bars on it, go to Tools, click on Extensions.
4. On the extensions page, there's a check box in the top right that says ""Developer mode"" check that. (Don't worry, it just lets you use an unpacked extension)
5. Click the ""Load unpacked extension..."" button (top left area of that page) and select the folder that came out of the .zip (should be named ""untamed0-Untamed-Now-Playing-0416897"" those last numbers might change though). This folder you select should contain folders named ""ico"" and ""lib"" and some other files. If there's another folder named ""untamed-0..."" look inside that.
6. Hit ""OK""
7. You should have a new button in the top right of Chrome that looks like a note. Right-click that and go to Options.
8. Change the directory to where you want (I made a new folder in Documents called ""unp"" and used that)
TIP: you can click on this bar [here](http://imgur.com/sez0U.png) and it'll change to [this](http://imgur.com/xPkVV.png) so you can copy the directory and paste it in your Options page easily. OPTIONAL: You can change the ""Plain text now playing format"" option to something like ""Now Playing: %s%"" (without quotes) to make the XSplit overlay say ""Now Playing: [song info here]"" instead of just the song info.


9. HIT SAVE &lt;-- this is important. It doesn't work if you don't do this. (You can leave the other options alone.)
10. Open Pandora in Google Chrome and start playing a song (any song)
11. Open up the folder you put in the extension's options. Look for a file titled ""unp_now_playing.txt"". You can open it and it'll have your song info in plain text there. It's probably best to leave it closed otherwise your text editor might complain at you every time the song changes.

OKAY NOW FOR THE XSPLIT PART:

1. You should have your normal scene. I guess you can check to see if everything is in order.
2. Add a new ""Title"" source in your scene sources.
3. Check the box next to ""Remote text update"" and I have it set to update every 5 seconds (updates at a reasonable pace but doesn't slow anything on your computer down). I also unchecked the ""Scrolling"" box (if you do this, make sure 60 characters can fit) but you can make it scroll if you want.
4. Set the remote URL to the location of the text file where the Google Chrome extension writes your song info (for example, mine is set at E:\Documents\unp\unp_now_playing.txt)
5. I left the Start and End tags at default. You can change text font, color, size, etc to match your liking.
6. THAT'S ALL. Now you should have plain text of what's on your Pandora without needing a screen region. I think this solution also looks cleaner than the screen region. Yay.

If anything goes wrong or if I wasn't clear of anything in these instructions, shoot me a message on twitch.

Enjoy and happy new year,

You need some time away from your job (league). Not like a vacation, but every day. Some sort of escape for a few hours. Maybe watch a T.V. show or read a good book (I would suggest Game of Thrones for both of those). Spend time with people outside of League, your girlfriend, and just do things that aren't league related. I promise it will help, because spending this much time in your job (this IS your job, no matter how much fun it is) is just difficult and stressful. This is the best advice i can think to give you right now, and I really hope you take it. This will even help with your league play. Also, find someone to talk to about league, or just anything at all. I know I'm just some random stranger on reddit, but if you can't find anyone you trust that much, I'm here to talk to you when you need it, and I'm sure plenty of other fans are too.

1373440177.0	1hzsle	Rengar Triple Q Explanation	paulstep15	4	0	2	"Hey Dyrus / others,

After watching the stream I figured I could provide some assistance with using Rengar's triple Q. The key behind this is the way Rengar's ulti works: it generates 5 charges of Ferocity. This means if you cast your ulti while sitting on x stacks of ferocity, if you consume the stacks immediately (which Q will do, and not remove the ult) the ulti will continue to generate stacks.

For example, if you current hold 4 Ferocity, cast your ulti, IMMEDIATELY Q when you hit 5, your next autoattack will be a Ferocity Q and your stacks will regenerate up to 4. When you leap on the target with the Ferocity Q (1st), you can then cast a regular Q (2nd), which will bring you to 5 Ferocity again for another Ferocity Q (3rd).

You don't have to cast the ulti with 4 stacks; if you want to incorporate either your W or E (or both) before the 3rd Q, you can start with 2-3 stacks of Ferocity, and simply cast W/E/WE, in addition to Q, between the two Ferocity Qs.

tl;dr: get (2/3/4) Ferocity, click R, immediately click Q at 5 Ferocity, click (QWE/QE/Q), click Q at 5 Ferocity"	t5_2vtnv	True

I thought it was mostly because of the team comp. You went with sona,rumble,varus,diana trying to kind of group them up into a small area, however they all kind of had great mobility from abilities( renekton dash, ezreal blink, gragas bodyslam, gragas ult ). Why did you go with this team comp?    
    
    
The baron steal would have maybe gave you enough of a lead on them to win the team fights. Though i think it's mostly got to do with the team comp.

Are you going to add Zed to your professional champion pool anytime soon? Why/why not? Do you think Regi plays him better or worse than you do?

Do you still recommend double Dorans and giants belt if playing in a stagnant top lane?

I think the reduced CD on W is helpful enough to max it after E, but after enough games I realized my ult wasn't killing people with 1-2 health items with a level 1 Q. 

If you gain an early lead (say 5-0-x) would you recommend spamming bloodthirsters or rushing a warmogs?

His W puts me in a unique predicament when building. If I don't build glass cannon, I waste the potential of the unique power that can come from having passive +25% AD.

But rushing warmogs makes diving as a group easier, and helps lategame when I need to be in the middle of a team fight.

Ever since my first encounter with Jayce I have never won a lane against him. Of course sometimes we can win late game but laning against him is nigh impossible. He has all the mechanics that can counter any type of champion. He has a long range poke, gap closer + slow and a knockback if you try to get up close. I'm just curious to hear what you guys think about how to actually beat a Jayce. Some people say go AD nidalee and max your E so you can outsustain him.

After watching some of your streams, I noticed I've been hearing some of the same songs, so I thought that I would share some bands I've really been into lately that have also been good to listen to while playing LoL. Nothing slow and sad here! (I know you use Pandora, and I'm not sure if its a playlist or a station you are using, but see if these catch your fancy.)

[Enemies - Nag Champa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYjLrl2ySFw )

*These guys are an awesome instrumental rock band from Ireland. I listen to them all the time while playing League.

[A Tribe Called Quest - Steve Biko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItLBiHG9gc)
*One of the best hip-hop groups ever. If I could pick a song to see Dyrus nodding his head to on that little stream box, I'd want it to be this!

[B6 - Day of the Weird Beginning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5mCAODSuUY)

A fantastic electronic music producer from Shanghai, China.

[Queens of the Stone Age - God is in the Radio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGf2wKDV-v8)

Really good rock band that doesn't really have any bad songs. I end my shift at my college radio station all the time with this song.

[Nujabes - Luv Sic Pt. 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdQYzEc6wYw)

You might know this guy if you have seen Samurai Champloo. He was a fantastic producer from Japan, and the guy rapping on this song is Shing02.

I would show more, but this is probably enough. Hope you enjoy them!

I've created this thread to ask for a bit of advice. I don't know what role to main in league of legends. I have a good understanding on most of the roles but none have jumped out and caught my attention. i usually play adc but its always a 50% chance that ill go positive and we win. The role honestly bores me. I used to jungle back in season 2 but no matter what i tried my team kept losing and i always took the blame. I have tried since the end of season 2 because of the failed attempts. Support im alright at it's just seem a bit dull to me. Mid and top lane i dont have many problems with  other than when to harass and when to just farm cs. ive been thinking about this for a couple months now and i thought it would have come to me by now.There is one big problem that stops me from being able to play as much as i want and thats my job, i work 12 hour days and only get up to 6 days off a month if im lucky. I dont have the time to experiment with the different champions and lanes. If you could give me some help since you've been playing League since beta and know pretty much everything about it. You've helped me a little bit before when i asked about gunnar's (even though i still haven't gotten a pair since i wrk too much) i was hoping you could help out one more time.

Since his nerfs, his build has changed slightly. Can you give me a god build? My normal go-to build is:


Sorc Boots 

Warmog's/Spirit Visage

WotA

Zhonya's

Rabadon's/Abyssal Scepter 

Rylai's 


However I've been seeing you build Spectral Wraith instead of WotA. You did in your Vlad vs TF match up video and I guess I was curious as to why. Compared to WotA, you give and get the following for Spirit:


+10% CDR 

-40AP 


But maybe there is something that I'm not seeing in the build. You're the one that I based my Vlad play off of so if you could help me to understand why you get Spectral Wraith, or if you have any opinion on my go-to build, please give me some insight.

1372987178.0	1ho085	What was the thought process behind the roster change?	jinmeister	2	2	4	"The lane swap between Dyrus and Reginald...
Before you guys tell me that there isn't much of a difference between lane swaps and such, but the roster change did come with a great change for Dyrus.

As Dyrus moved to mid lane, all that changed was the chair seating and his champion pool. Actually, I shouldn't say his champion pool changed, but now he is geared towards playing carry type champions rather than support tanks. I know that he enjoys playing carries and got tired of the support tanks, but I feel like it was a step back for TSM as the only one who can truly soak up damage now is TheOddOne with his SoAG and Runic Bulwark.
So why did you guys decide to do this roster change? I know that the team put a lot of thought into this before deciding that it was a good idea, but I just want to know what the benefits were.

On a side note, great games today against Coast and Velocity though. Really great to see you guys take a step up from last week."	t5_2vtnv	True

 * Do you think Meteos is the best jungler in NA now?


 * Is Turtle the most talented player in NA or does he have te potential to be? Compare him to Doublelift please!


 * How do you rate Westrice as a top laner? What about his AD, was he a good ADcarry back in the EG days? I remember his Vayne being godlike.


 * Not a question realy, but I remember watching your stream back then, before you een joined TSM. You were talking more, I felt you were more alive back then with higher confidence. I rarely watch your stream nowdays, it's boring to say the least and you know it.

I feel that flat runes are better as it gives you a stronger early game over the other person which you can use to snowball into mid/late game. Although, I think that in certain situations, per level would be more beneficial depending on the situation/champion. I personally have been playing league since Season 1 and have always ran various *flat* runes yet just recently, I have found the benefit of running Health per level seals on my mid lane page (AP, MR, HP per level, Magic pen). Yesterday was the start of my 1 week spring break and I am inside the entire week due to my knee surgery yesterday. Which I mean, isn't a problem as I would probably be inside playing league anyways. So, I have been exploring various rune possibilities and have found quite the interesting combinations. Anyone else have any combinations?

I did not take part in the bench regi idiotic circlejerk and never thought he should be benched (since it's his own team what the fuck?), but this guy makes excellent points. Don't know if you'll read or care but to me this would be a step forward in the TSM mentality, as this guy says Koreans are all equal players and see each other as equal and have 2-3 coaches per team while you guys are 4 players following 1 boss that is also a player, which creates discomfort and negates real talking between players. I don't wanna say i'm 10000% right but these are actually good points that regi should read and understand, it's just for the good of your team and for us fans! Koreans are doing so good because of how they're organized, why not be revolutionary in the NA scene and get organized like them as well? Please when you've time take a look at what this guy said and try and talk to regi about it, even if it's scary to talk to him about such big changes.

Regardless, good job on the game versus MRN. It did look like you guys solved some of the communication issues, except for that last call at baron. However, It was a great game to watch and a solid demonstration of how much of a key player you are to TSM.

I came over, and you guys made room for me at the table, and we had pizza. Afterwards, we went to the US Open tennis games because you guys had said you liked playing tennis to get active. I love tennis myself, and we watch Federer vs Del Potro, an old rivalry.

After this, when it was time to go, you gave me a hug, lifted me over your shoulders (I'm pretty small), and then put me back down.
