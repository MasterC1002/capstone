Youtube had removed to due to a copyright claim from a name I'd never heard of, a Susan Nicholson Hofheinz. Did some research, found [this page](http://www.hobbytalk.com/bbs1/showthread.php?t=89935)

This lady is an old-timey actress, who married some other guy and ended up with the rights to a bunch of old movies, some of which we know and love. 

She has been busy issuing DMCA copyright notices and getting them removed. She has also sued a number of TV stations and other businesses, always losing. Every single one. In one case, a judge who tossed her case out wrote a nine-page opinion ridiculing her. She sues anyone and everyone she can, but never attempts to actually make money from the films themselves, even when there's interest in them.

Now, granted, if she owns the rights to the movies then she is fully within her right to have any instance of the movies removed if they are posted to the net without her permission. But, aren't MST3k episodes their own product, with their own copyrights and copyright holders? The brains had to purchase the rights to use the movies in the first place, correct? I'm wondering if she has the legal right to have MST3k episodes taken down. 

This may not be a complete list, but as of now, episodes I've noticed that are affected by this are as follows:

(Edit to add to this list)

309 - The Amazing Colossal Man

311 - It Conquered the World

418 - Attack of the The Eye Creatures

807 - Terror From the Year 5000

809 - I Was a Teenage Werewolf

TL;DR - Old bag gets sue happy, takes down episodes.

P.S. - Anyone out there who could re-upload these episodes, and submit new links to club-mst3k for them? I don't have them downloaded, though I may start doing that.

Dear Friends,

As we have been adding dates to our live show schedule for 2013, we have come to the decision that this will be our last year actively touring as Cinematic Titanic. We feel that with any project there is a time to move on and as 5 people living in 5 different cities with different lives and projects, it has become increasingly difficult to coordinate our schedules and give Cinematic Titanic the attention it requires to keep growing as a creative enterprise and a business. As a result, we have decided to take this indefinite hiatus.

The last 5+ years have been an amazing opportunity for us all to reconnect creatively with one another and more importantly to connect with the fans of MST3K and new fans of Cinematic Titanic. We've had the great pleasure of playing some beautiful theaters around the country and have taken movie riffing to places we never dreamed, like ILM and Pixar, a sports arena, and even Broadway! The love we've been shown by those we've met and performed for will be with us forever.

We will be performing as many dates as is feasible this year and we hope you'll come out and see us go at it one last time if we come to a theater near you in 2013. We are still in discussions about the production of additional DVDs and we'll keep you posted.

We thank you deeply for all the support you've shown Cinematic Titanic over these years and we're looking forward to many great shows in the year ahead.

Cheers,

The CT Crew"	t5_2qltq	True

I love the show and thoroughly enjoy it while awake too, of course, but it's kind of a comforting thing to fall asleep to now and then. 

The problem is, a lot of the episodes have super loud screaming or  sudden noises in them that wake me up. So I'm a bit limited in my choices here. Some I've found work pretty well are ""The Day the Earth Froze,"" ""Fugitive Alien"" (1 &amp; 2), and ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank.""

Ones that do NOT work well are ""Mitchell"" (because of Gypsy's freakout in the middle), ""Eegah"" (that squeaky voice, lots of screaming), and a fair number of the monster movies (screaming).

So I'm looking for additional suggestions. Which ones do you find quiet and soothing?"	t5_2qltq	True

But I've introduced enough friends to MST3K recently that I'm all Puma Man-ed out. And Manos, the Hands of Fate is so bad that even with MST3K helping, I could only sit through it a handful of times.

So what other amazing episodes should we watch? I tend to prefer the Mike years, but Joel obviously had some classics too.

Thank you for your help!

**tl;dr**: What MST3K shows should a noob watch, excluding Puma Man and Manos?

After a great response to my first thread, I'm going to go ahead with the planning for an episode watching group for MST3K. But before I do, I wanted to solicit some information from you all about what the best way to go about some of the details would be. If you could post your feedback, that'd be great!

1. What's the best place to host group-watching sessions? Twitch.tv? Justin.tv? Any other suggestions?

2. How should we select each week's episodes? We had nearly 20 people say they would be interested, so I was thinking each week someone could just propose their favorite episode/one they wanted us all to watch. Do you think that would work well?

3. For the timing for the (non-mandatory!) group views, I was thinking around 7PM EST, but I wasn't sure about the day of the week that would work out best. Thoughts?

I used to get up early on the weekends and sneak out and watch this on the sci fi channel before my dad wanted the tv to watch sports, then as I grew up I started collecting the dvds and really began to understand just how amazing this was.  When I got to college for theatre performance, I used songs from the show to audition, and they were all met with laughter and a role for me. I went to comic con for the first time last year, and I didn't quite make the line cut for the live Rifftrax show but I did manage to meet the guys. One of the Happiest days of my life!  I want to thank the mods for keeping the spirit of the show alive and all the posters for their amazing submissions!

It's time for an invention exchange a la original MST3K skit. Here's what I want to do: Take a week to dream up a wacky invention that fits the general theme of the old invention exchange skit on the show. Post it as a comment in this thread by next Sunday (AD). 

Here are the ""rules"" (guidelines) --

* You don't actually have to build it, only describe it (pictures are a +)
* Don't use inventions already shown on the show...
* Mega-extra-bonus karma if you actually build it
* Feel free to theme it (evil or uhh ... Joel-esque)

Good luck, and I expect to see some wacky and entertaining stuff.

Last night I trudged right on through Leech Woman and still wasn't too sleepy, so I picked up Starfighters where I left off a few days ago.  

Just... dear god why?  Why did they do that movie?  As one of the guys said during the film, ""this movie has more nothing than any other film we've seen.""  NO PLOT!  WHATSOEVER!  It's like each time something in the film interesting happened, the film makers were thinking ""hey we could make a plot out of this!  ...No, no we better not.""  Over and over again!  All of the movies they've riffed at least had some weak attempt at something that could be misconstrued as a ""plot"", but Starfighters fell far short of even those atrocities.  Halfway through the movie I was determined to watch the rest of it simply as a test of my own endurance.  But I just don't know how they finally decided to use Starfighters in one of their episodes.  Were they completely short of crappy B movies to choose from that week?

However I will give credit where credit is due, and the opening ""BOLD"" sketch is one of, if not *the*, best sketch they've ever done.  "	t5_2qltq	True

1328388383.0	pazx2	I'm creating an episode rating service for MST3K episodes	tslocum	31	3	12	"[http://mst3k.nfshost.com](http://mst3k.nfshost.com)

Subreddit: [/r/MSR3K](/r/MSR3K)

I've been working on it for a bit over the past two days.  Because it's a small project I don't mind sharing it so early in development.

Basically I'm aiming to help out MST3K fans who are still exploring new episodes.  The site will prevent someone from subjecting themselves (purposely) to a Hamlet, if you catch my drift.

Right now the site has barely any functionality, however I am accepting sign ups for new accounts.  At the moment you can browse the episode database and rate it 1 star to 5 stars.  My plan is to add more complex ratings in the future, such as overall film quality, overall riff quality, non-MSTie value, etc.  The ratings given during the site's construction will count later as the overall MST3K episode rating.

A big feature I'd like to have is user-contributed annotations for riffs.  I know there are resources out there for certain episodes, however I'd like to expand that to as many episodes as possible.  This would also lead to the possibility to comments about particular riffs.  But this is an idea I'm still toying with.

I am still in the process of adding all of the episodes to the database.  Quite a few of the episodes are included for now, though.

I'm open to any ideas for the site.  Thanks for the support."	t5_2qltq	True

Well, my job involves sitting at a desk and writing a bunch of code all day, so I listen to a TON of music, audiobooks, and podcasts. I wanted to figure out some way I could go through every episode again, as that would take a long time, but I couldn't figure out how.

Then, my wife made an amazing suggestion: just rip the audio from each episode, and put the audio file on my phone.

After a couple of months of work, I finally have the audio of every single MST3K episode in MP3 format. I gotta tell ya, *listening* to the episodes is like an entirely different experience! First of all, I get to picture in my head what's going on, and make up my own visuals. Secondly, there are some sequences that are HILARIOUS without a visual to go with them, such as the long sequence in the ""Cave Dwellers"" episode where Joel and the Bots recreate the opening credits(all you hear for nearly two minutes is just a bunch of shuffling around.) Lastly, it's a great way to concentrate on the riffs, rather than the movies.

They only perform venues to which they are invited, and nobody in Chicago has invited them yet.

I'm the organizer of the MST3k Meetup group in Chicago (seriously, if you're a Chicago MSTie and you haven't joined us, do so now: http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-MST3K-Group/) and I'm trying to find them a venue.  I have already corresponded with their agent and found out what they need ($15k up front, plus air fare and hotel accommodations -- if I was to rent out a theatre myself and invite them, it would be about $25k), but I need help to get this done.  Is anyone interested in helping?  Does anyone know anything or anyone who knows anything that would be useful here?  Is there enough interest to get a kickstarter funded?

This is a bit out of my wheelhouse; my group generally gets about 20 people and I don't pay for anything except equipment and space; that's about $75 a month.  $25k is... intimidating.  If anyone can help me here, I'll totally be your best friend."	t5_2qltq	True

1365313495.0	1bu8ww	Am I the only person who would love to see a Criterion release of the Coleman Francis trilogy?		21	4	11	"I can't find those films anywhere online in digital or DVD format. 

**Edit:** I'm actually of the unpopular opinion that under the right circumstances Coleman Francis could've been a brilliant filmmaker, and perhaps (though I'd have to see his films without the MST3K riffing before deciding) his existing films are *good*. Let's take a look at his trilogy. **Red Zone Cuba** is a great story. It's about men living on the fringe of American society at a critical time in the nation's cultural history. They're criminals and vagrants out for one thing: financial gain. In search of cash they sign up to fight the communists in Cuba. They come to the defense of the capitalistic system that has forced them into a less than desirable lifestyle, and their own motivations in doing so are greedy. It's a stark portrait of the brutal cycle and circumstances of a society where selfishness is at times masked as individualism, where victim and perpetrator engage in an voluntary act of perpetual degradation of human dignity. After being sent into an ill conceived invasion by forces that deemed them dispensable, and suffering at the hands of their captors in Cuba, they return to America to pursue a gold mine. They eventually victimize a cafe owner by *invading* his land and holding him and his wife *captive*, drawing parallels to their own suffering in Cuba. Again pointing at the selfishness and lack of perspective a me-based culture can give rise to. The film ends with the surrender of our supporting protagonists, and the death of our leading man, signifying the bleak outcome of this criminal philosophy. It's a bold social statement Francis makes with this film, but perhaps not as powerful as the one professed in **The Beast of Yucca Flats**. Here we have the Cold War and the Capitalist-Communist reckless ideology-struggle as our main theme once again. The films depicts defecting Soviet scientist Joseph Javorsky who is being perused by agents of the state he once served. His briefcase contains secrets (about the Soviet moon landing) that the KGB vehemently wish to reclaim. In this pursuit, Jarovsky stumbles onto a nuclear testing ground and is transformed via radiation into the Beast. He then goes on to terrorize the countryside impulsively attacking people. In their hunt for the Beast, police almost kill an innocent man when he's mistaken for Jarovksy, showing how fear and aggression can lead armed parties to attack hastily. Over all, the film show us that destructive power (especially nuclear technology) knows no ideology, that it is as wholly and completely destructive as the Beast was, and therefore must be stopped. Francis calls for nuclear disarmament, and peace despite philosophical difference. Finally, we have **The Skydivers**. In this film the sordid love affairs of skydiving thrill seekers lead to jealousy, self-destruction, and eventually murder. Though not in a manner as powerful as employed his other films, Francis critiques the maverick devil-may-care way of living often romanticized by American culture. He shows how this mentality and behavior can escalate quickly from innocent rebelliousness to murderous egotism. It's perhaps not as brooding as his other films (I believe in an attempt to gain favor with popular studios marketing to a wider audience, it being after all his sophomoric release following the seminal Beast of Yucca Flats) I believe the message to be no less profound. Over all, I feel low production values, bad acting and inexperienced film-making has lead Coleman Francis and his work to be greatly misunderstood. I see Francis as having had the potential to be the American Tarkovksy, both of them used long panning shots of bleak landscapes to illustrate deeper and more profound concepts during a time of great international tension between their respective countries. 

**Edit:**^2 I believe Francis' philosophy of man's destructive tendencies and how they're rationalized by our natural egotism is summed up in a quote taken from his iconic haiku-like narration in The Beast of Yucca Flats: ""Touch a button. Things happen. A scientist becomes a beast."" The illusion of order, the belief that your way is the right way, justifying the destruction of life. In perhaps his most profound scene, at the end of Yucca Flats we see the dead Beast (formerly a man of intellect reduced to nondiscriminatory savagery) being nuzzled by a wild rabbit, postulating that the natural world may one day feed on the entrails of a civilized species that collapsed under the weight of its own violence. 

**Edit:**^3 Also, *coffee*."	t5_2qltq	True

Here is what I remember;

It looks like it may have been made in the 60s or 70s, is about a group of teenagers who are looking for something, (like archaeologists in training). There is a Native American man who is guiding them? I cant remember his purpose, but the joke with this character that he kept offering soup. When we first see the character he describes everything in the soup he made, very slowly, ""I made it with Bell Peppers...onions...""ect. And the main story is, that one of the males of the group is turned into a giant lizard and started killing people, but at the end the remaining members of the group destroy him, and MST3K crew as the Native American say,"" He never got to try my soup... made of onions...bell peppers...""

PLEASE HELP. I have been trying to find this episode for years, I would really appreciate the help :D

This version (longer and, incredibly, worse than the version they used in MST) also gives painfully clumsy explanations for some of the bigger plot holes in the other version. Dr. Hale's helicopter noise is erased by a ""throat microphone"" that he explains to Luther Stark in the helicopter (for no reason). Denby is secretly an atomic physicist. Elliot is an atomic physicist, too (whom Leonard Driscoll at one point tells ""call me a limousine,"" because atomic physicists call limo... eh, never mind). Still no clue why Denby thought it would be beneficial to blow up his car in the first place, though, despite a couple additional scenes that claim to explain it. But Stafford sings ""I Fell In Love With a Cupcake,"" so this thing is a must-see."	t5_2qltq	True

1310956114.0	isg70	r/MST3k, I'm Hosting A Live Riffing Event. The Idea Is Pretty Unique. Comments And Suggestions Appreciated!	SelectaRx	16	6	2	"Just before this past Christmas, a friend and I developed an idea. She would sometimes have an ""MST3k night"" where she would show an episode or two and people would come hang out, drink booze, socialise, etc. Being the avid fan that I am, I requested an episode to watch and through correspondence we developed an idea for an event that could be perpetrated at any bar with a projector and a PA system (in the case of the lack of these two components, they can either be rented or borrowed for the occasion).  
  
Two to three people host the event. The hosts set up and introduce the movies and the premise of the evening. With proper planning and execution, skits could easily be performed here, with the possibility of themes, characters, overarching story arc and such. The evening proceeds thusly:  
  
Two shorts are selected, and the hosts do a live riffing of the shorts. 
After the shorts are introduced and riffed upon by the hosts, a feature is shown. Again, the opportunity for skits between shorts is available if desired. Obviously, number of shorts or even necessity of shorts is entirely up to the hosts.    
At this point any kind of queuing system can be used to enlist the help of audience members. Audience members can be accommodated individually, two to a mic, however you wish, to riff on the movie with the hosts. If the guest audience riffers are good, the hosts riff along with them. If the guest audience riffers suck, the hosts riff on their inability to riff.     
At the end of the night the hosts pick the audience member they thought was the funniest riffer and that person gets a prize (a free drink, t-shirt, stag prize, whatever).    
  
Our particular event closes with area DJ's playing music, as well as drinking and fun until the bar closes, but whatever happens after the riffing event is up to the individuals hosting the event, the time constraints placed on or by the bar, etc. The entire process should take about two hours or so. If doors are opened around 8, allowing for fifteen or thirty minutes for patrons to get settled, the whole affair can easily be over by 10:00PM - 10:30PM. 11:00PM tops. The beauty of this event is that it can be conveniently implemented on any ""dead night"", such as a week night at any bar, allowing interested parties to come experience the event and not have to to stay til the early hours of the morning to enjoy the entire event, while still allowing regular patrons to enjoy their bar as well.  
  
My friend and I were given the chance to stage such an event at a local bar, and, unfortunately, our timing was bad (a few days after Christmas, coupled with winter in a town notorious for it's Seasonal Affective Disorder) and we under-promoted the event, leaving a sour taste in the venue's mouth. We've been given another shot at it and we're going to do it right this time. It's currently summer, everyone's down to hang out and we know tonnes of people who are fans of MST3k. Furthermore, we have a dedicated plan of attack as far as promotions are concerned (fliers, personal flier distribution at relevant hangouts, bars, etc, write ups in the local music and arts papers, social internet promotion aside from facebook, lol). In addition to this, we have the opportunity to stage the event at another bar on the other side of town a few weeks after this coming event.  
  
I'll be using these shows to gauge how well the idea goes over. People I've talked to are excited about the whole affair. I'm sure once we start reaching out and promoting to people, the MST3k and Rifftrax fanbase will embrace the idea (hopefully, lol) and the event will take off and we can stage the event on a monthly or even weekly basis at various clubs around the area.  
  
The idea appeals to me, personally, on a number of levels, not the least of which is affording people the opportunity to be funny on a microphone in a non-traditional comedy setting. May people are interested in comedy, but are scared shitless of performing standup. Here there's almost a kind of karaoke-type fallback. Someone (one of the hosts) is on the mic, constantly being funny and even lightening the load (if not at the inept participants expense) if it proves the participant has gotten themselves into something they're not initially, or even at all very good at, haha. I love comedy and I seriously think this is a unique opportunity to involve people and create an almost kind of ""social comedy"" experience. I'll report back here if our coming attempts at this event are fruitful and I encourage people to take the reins and set up similar events in their own towns. Early adopters clearly have the upper hand of developing the stronger fanbase and culture of riffers, but there's no reason why this couldn't become a karaoke type phenomena with a bar in every neighborhood hosting similar events.  
  
So yeah, tell me what you guys think! What do you think might be the pitfalls here? How awesome do you think the idea is? Would you be excited to have an event like this presented in your area? At what time does the narwhal bacon?!  
  
Also, the name for my particular troupe of riffers/the banner under which I'm going to advertise this particular local event is Mysterious Scientific Cinema 5000 (MSC5k). Mike, Kevin, Bill, if you're reading this, or if any users want to chime in, please to be informing me if that name is in appropriate. I'll change it with no ill will, as it hasn't yet become a brand identity.

For me there are a few. First I think one big mistake they made was almost never putting anyone else in the theater. In particular TV's Frank and Pearl Forester. Both are really funny and we basically never get to see them riff. Pearl did the Summer Movie thing they did with Batman but I don't recall Frank ever being in the theater. It just seems like they under used their comic talent.

Gypsy, I've never liked the voice. The character is fine but the voice always annoyed me. (all versions)

If you are keeping track I finished Season 2. And watched the first episode of Season 3. Random thoughts/insight. Why does the color of Joel's suit keep changing and what was with the creepy goate? You can see the cast getting comfortable and gelling. I love when they pick on one director. Speaking of I swear the stock footage is getting repetative. I know I saw the exact same scene more then once. I know the point is bad movies, but some of these movies are more then bad. I had to break up some episodes into two sitting because the movie was so bad. The riffing great, movie bad. I liked the ""flashback"" episode where they just showed old skits. I've caught a couple ""call backs,"" riffs used before.

Season K is done. The crew is getting better. Can still be a little low on jokes per episode but they have some good lines. Season 1 was out of order. They announced the winners of a contest before they announced the contest. The shorts can be funny too. I am glad the quality is getting better. I can now understand what they are saying. I love when Joel stands up and plays with the screen. Beep Boop Beep, I am pushing the buttons.

Currently one flair class is available that mimics the flair that I had already added via more primitive methods. Here's what will happen: no need to go to a form to get (or change) flair anymore. Now just use the flair link on the top right of the sidebar. Any user should be able to edit their own flair text. 

The old flair text is gone and will stay gone. It was not as elegant as the new flair feature.

TLDR; Just add your own flair using the link at the top right of the sidebar!

1308508031.0	i3pcf	My Own Private MST3K Server	cambot	11	1	6	"I love the nofadz stream for the weekend live riffs, and the justin.tv stream for my iPhone, but I wanted my own stream that could handle my avi collection which includes specials and play a stream at a decent LAN bandwidth, and therefore higher audio and visual quality. After about a day of goofing around with VLC, here's how to do it (assuming linux or unix. Command lines should be the same for windows, but the paths will be different)

You need:

* a computer to stream from (server) and a computer to stream to (client). In theory, they could be the same box, but it gets more complicated.
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) on both boxes
* a collection of MST3K movies on the server (or connected via samba or NFS). You can also do this with other video files or shows, but this is /r/MST3K! My files are in .avi format. Create a playlist of your files in .m3u format which will be used in the command line below. The beauty of this whole adventure is that you don't have to encode your files into a different format!! That takes time and disc space - VLC does it on the fly.

So, my server is a mac mini with VLC installed. The command line to launch everything is this:

    /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC /Users/cambot/MST3K.m3u --loop --random --sout-keep --sout '#gather:std{mux=asf,dst=192.168.0.4:8888,access=mmsh}'

1. 
The first argument is the path to VLC. Replace it with yours.
2. The second argument is the path to your playlist (.m3u) file. 
3. the --loop and --random flags just tell VLC to randomize the playlist and play it forever, just like nofadz and justin.tv. You can omit these if you want.
4. --sout-keep tells VLC to play all tracks in 1 stream. Without this flag, your client will stop playing after 1 track has finished, and you'll have to press play after each track.
5. The last argument in single quotes tells the VLC server how to stream the video. Replace the IP address with your server's IP address and port. I use port 8888 because 8080 (the default) is already in use for VLC http interface. You don't have to bother with the other stuff.

So now, on your client, launch VLC, and File -&gt; Open Network, and enter mmsh://YourIP:Yourport. In my example, this is mmsh://192.168.0.4:8888. 

Voila. Infinite high quality MST3K on your LAN. I use it mostly for when I work out and do chores. You could also share this with others on your LAN or access it from the internet with SSH port forwarding. Have fun, and please comment if you have more ideas!

This is just a quick and dirty way. I'm pretty sure that nofadz uses a shoutcast server. I'm not that fancy, so suggestions are welcome!

**POST SPAM FILTER RESCUE UPDATE**

I've since transferred the stream from my mac mini to my always-on freebsd server to save electricity. I added this script in my home directory which does everything above, but runs it as a daemon and adds the http interface that I can access via the VLC remote iphone app. You can use the no-x version of vlc too. freebsd users enjoy!
