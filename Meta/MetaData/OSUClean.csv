If we win The Game, we as a sub get to pick your sidebar pic that you put up for a week, and vice versa.

Obviously no vulgar or offensive photos.

What do you guys think?

Edit: What this thread should be is people either arguing why we should/shouldn't make this wager, and people posting ideas for pictures for the other sub should your team win.

Edit 2: I messaged one your mods with the idea, and will message the mod over at r/uofm. I think you guys should start looking for pics, unless some of you wanted to wait until The Game is over and use one from it."	t5_2qj3f	True

1361986002.0	19c5bp	A thorough Review of OSU's many bathrooms. (Content and Details inside) 	MaxOre94	102	11	73	"I have begun a series of satirically thorough, detailed reviews of men's restrooms from all over campus. I summarize each review with a score out of ten. At the insistence of my friends, I have decided to post them here. If there is demand, I will continue to release the reviews via installments. I believe this could be an invaluable resource. Upon the completion of my guide, I will combine all the reviews into a pdf file, and post it. 

The first two can be seen here: 
[Bricker Hall Basement](http://i.imgur.com/kdmPWfB.png) and the
[Journalism Building Floor 3](http://i.imgur.com/Q2Vp1Te.png)

I have not yet devised a consistent, precise rubric for scoring, or decided how frequently/regularly I will post reviews (provided there is demand in the from of comments, upvotes, PM's, etc.), though I intend to.  Let me know what you think! 

Edit: I'm thrilled to see such a positive response. The reviews will continue. They will also return with a more orderly and consistent system of rating. Please PM or comment with further suggestions. As of right now, I'll just keep posting the installments on this subreddit.

Well I've talked to him and bought newspapers from him a couple times, but yesterday I didn't have any money, I explained to him.  I told him the true story of having overdrawn my bank account that morning and owing an extra $125.  Without hesitation brother Joe whips out what was about $20 dollars in singles and tried to give me something to help!  Needless to say I refused, but for the past day I've just been thinking about it.  All I can really say about it is that if you do have a buck and see him trying to sell newspapers, maybe just buy one once in a while.  Otherwise, talk to him, he's just a nice guy.  

tl;dr: Brother Joe is a homeless person on high street and when I told him about being broke, he tried to give me money.  I just think that's great."	t5_2qj3f	True

He asked me if I knew Danielle, that I looked like her and he was looking for her. I told him to piss off, I don't know a danielle. He asked me to come closer to the car and I told him to piss off again, and he drove away yelling something.

I saw him stop twice and do the same thing to groups of girls, both who were smart enough to stay away, got home told my roommate and apparently the piece of shit is wanted for sexual assault.

It is very rough around the edges and not working (yet). My goal is to have it up and running for the fall. This would require a significant portion of my summer and before I make that investment, would you all be interested in something like this? And would you use it?

Catal is a map/calendar hybrid. Pick the day you're interested in then further filter the results until you find something you want to go see/do. 

""So like Facebook?"" Not exactly, you have to know what organizations/places you're looking for on Facebook. The goal of Catal is to present events in one place organized by date and time so you can find events instead of searching for events.

After 20 seconds or so they drove away. 

I am so sick of seeing racism directed against Asians on campus. In every class I've taken with a lab component, there's always a conscious effort not to sit with the Chinese kids, and ignorant white kids make mean comments about them behind their backs. I once had a girl in an intro physics class ask me why I'd sit at their table, since they ""can't speak English."" I wonder if she speaks any foreign language at all, let alone at a level of proficiency that would allow her to live in a foreign country.

When interacting with foreigners, you are serving as an ambassador for your country. Remember that the Chinese students studying here are likely the future leaders of their country. Wouldn't you prefer they have fond memories of the US?

1354654371.0	14a4a9	Tips from your TA	osu_grad	72	19	37	"As you prepare for finals week (or whatever you want to call it since it bridges a weekend) please be kind to your grad student graders, TAs, or instructors. We are not professors, we are indentured servants. We have projects, experiments, and dissertations to write, but we must teach intro courses and grade large lecture based classes in order to eat and buy overpriced coffee. Here is a list of some helpful things you can do to not make our lives harder than it already is. Granted, we chose these paths and we love (for the most part) our work and environment, but sometimes we have our limits.

1) We do not give out bad grades because we do not like you. We give bad grades because you earned that grade. It looks better for us to have higher grades in our courses, so why are you blaming us? You should have studied, especially since we probably provided you with study guides, clear hints, and various other tools to assist you in earning a passing grade.

2) This is not 1995. We have all grown up with Word and other word processing programs. Trying to tell us that we uploaded your 15-page paper incorrectly (which you sent to us 5 minutes before the deadline) is insulting. That may work for the old bag of bones with tenure in the nice corner office, but in the dungeons, that nonsense does not fly.

3) When you attend a review session or come to office hours (yeah, remember those things from earlier in the semester?), please do not ask what will be on the exam. Ask pointed questions regarding the material and perhaps you will see that our answers or suggestions for finding those answers will reveal more than what you were asking. 

4) It is highly probable that we have taught and/or graded this course before. We have all heard hundreds of answers on irony in *Bleak House*, the implications of the Franco-Prussian War, and Newton's Laws. **If** you do not know the answer, either formulate the best guess you can or make up something so ridiculous that we give you partial credit for making us laugh. 

5) We know you have to pass this class. We feel for you. Realtalk. If this is your third time stepping into the classroom and you just picked up the required readings for the course, however, do not expect us to feel sorry for you when you fail. If you needed that extra GPA point or class credit to graduate, perhaps you should not have spent the entire semester filming the reactions of your friends to r/spacedicks.

6) We are human. If we make a mistake grading, cut us some slack. Be respectful and calmly ask us to explain something we may have overlooked. Coming to us with some level of respect will do wonders for you and your grade. "	t5_2qj3f	True

Hello everyone. I know you hate these emails, but hear me out. So I went to the Oval yesterday to study for our sociology exam, and, I kid you not, a falcon came out of nowhere and just snatched my laptop and flew away with it. So my first reaction is to yell, ""Come on man, bring my laptop back!"". Then I realized birds can't understand humans (except parakeets, which I still don't know how that's possible). Anyway, after the falcon didn't bring me back my laptop, I started running after it. So I'm running through the Oval, dodging frisbees and footballs, right? This is when the falcon flies into the Thompson Library. And I'm just like, ""uh what""? So naturally, I follow it into the library. It started squawking, so my biggest concern at this point was the people trying to study while this falcon is flying around making noise for no reason. If you were in the library yesterday, you probably already know what I'm talking about. He decides to take the elevator, so I think, ""I'll run up the stairs and beat him to the top"". But when I got to the 11th floor, I couldn't find him anywhere. I look outside and he's just flying outside the library window with my laptop in his beak. The son of a bitch tricked me. He didn't even go upstairs. I'm furious at this point (as you can imagine). I run outside after him and I finally caught up to him when he got to the Olentangy River. We're out in the middle of the river fighting over my laptop when an alligator jumps out of the water and grabs it. And I'm not about to fuck with an alligator. So I just gave up and swam back to land. This leaves me with no study material for our sociology exam on Thursday.

^(So if anyone would be willing to send me their notes from the entire semester, that would be awesome.)

Last time it snowed, we got completely dumped on, and it totally sucked.  All the streets and sidewalks were covered in anywhere from 3-6 inches of snow, getting around town was a nightmare.  

Obviously we have no control over what happens to the streets.  However, we can control how snowy our sidewalks are.  Last time, no one shoveled shit, the snow packed down, the temp rose to the mid 30s during the day, the snow got nice and wet, the temp dropped at night, eventually creating a nice sheet of ice covering basically every sidewalk in the campus area.  

You already know this.  Chances are, you were probably annoyed by it.  I honestly didn't even want to walk my dog because of how slippery it was.  If it ends up snowing a lot this week, be the bigger person and shovel your sidewalk.  I don't want to have to ice skate to class.

GerlachBatman	55	7	75	"I experienced first hand yesterday when our slummed down apartment was being shown how unprepared students are sometimes when looking at a new place to live. Unless you have a parent coming with you, most students have no idea what questions to ask or what research to do before looking at a house. If this helps just one person, I'll be happy.

1. Try to Google apartment reviews for your landlord or complex. Now, almost all large companies will have some negative points, but if the majority are negative, consider the high probability that you will experience those first hand. People don't take time out of their day out of spite, these are real concerns that more people have probably experienced but are too lazy to type something up.

2. Check out the off-campus living survey (http://offcampus.osu.edu/posts/documents/doc-10172012-03424408-1.pdf) Thanks imnotminkus! You can see the ratings there to sort through the average landlords, and the ones you should run screaming from (G.A.S. and UM are on the run-away-screaming list)

3. TEST ALL APPLIANCES when being shown the apartment. If nothing works, ask why it doesn't work, ask TENANT how long it hasn't been working. Tenant is preferable, but if they aren't available ask the person showing it how long and why it isn't functioning. Make sure you have it in writing to fix the appliance by your move in date.

4. If you can, ask the tenant who lives there (preferably away from the person showing) how they like it, why they are leaving. People are too afraid to say anything negative in front of a landlord for fear of retaliation. 

5. Set up an appointment with Student Legal Services to look over your lease, especially if your company is not a major player. It needs to look like it was written by a lawyer, not printed off a word document. The people at SLS are super sweet and they deal with these guys for a living.

6. Don't pick the first house you look at! They are going to rush you, tell you that for whatever reason ""x number of people looked at the place and are going to put down on a lease tomorrow"". I don't know why the rental companies have such a fire under their ass, but they do, and they know your anxiety is already through the roof, so they play on that. Even if you LOVE the house you've looked at, you need something to compare it to, especially if this is your first time.

7. This one applies to people with pets; make sure that if you do have a pet, you make it very clear to your landlord and that you both sign a document or addendum regarding the animal's residence. 

8. If you're not sure how to find different rental companies, here is a list of ones I found and other redditors recommend (+ indicates a redditor rents from them and likes it/ - means they disliked)

9. Word of mouth referrals are ALWAYS the best kind. Ask your friends where they are living if they are off campus, ask them how their landlord is with maintenance and general upkeep. What I did is asked on Reddit if there were any renters who were happy with their landlord, who was a private owner, meaning they only own 2-5 houses which they rent out. 

**10. Never, EVER rent from North Steppe Reality**

Recognizing a great Ohioan and Purdue grad. If the PU band comes to town, it would be a great opportunity for a joint something or rather. What do you guys think?

Edit: While many people are saying it may be possible to do something with the band, even a simple moment of silence by the PA guy during pregame would be very good. Really anything from any entity during that game. The bands would just be the most visible. "	t5_2qj3f	True

I just placed an order and all of the meat I've gotten was damn delicious. As far as I know, all of this meat comes from the farms and Animal Science students. It seems way more local, and way more cheap as I believe they sell it at slightly above cost. Some of the best Brats I've ever had.

please note: you order during the week (before thursday at noon) and pick up friday between 1pm and 4:30pm. The lady working the desk is awesome and if you give her a hard time, i'll beat you up.

Per sweetbananajam: It is sold frozen. So you will have to thaw it if you plan on a friday night cookout.

Of course, I got curious and followed the link to a website which had me enter my info to apply. After finding a phone number, they declared themselves as VECTOR MARKETING.

If you do a simply google search on them you'll come to realize they are going to bankrupt you. They force you to buy expensive knives upwards of $600 so that you can sell them door to door.

I implore you all to make sure you let people know when you see them looking at these advertisements.

EDIT: Just got a call from their receptionist at their Columbus branch. Was friendly enough, asked how I heard about it and what my name was, if I was a student, what year and major. When I told her earth science, she asked me if I saw the ad i Mendenhell Hall. Anyway, I told her to cancel my application and I told her I didn't want to be associated with vector and that I thought it was a scam and I would rather have a minimum wage job. She took it really well and kept a pleasant tone so I assume she knows all this considering she didn't try to defend the company. When I told her about buying expensive knives, she told me that they discontinued that program in 2010 so I don't know what they do know and I would rather not find out."	t5_2qj3f	True

All the students were studying, though some with brews

Students flocked to the library, in hopes that they might

Find a table with an outlet, to last them the night. 



Some sat in the union, studying with peers, 

While others said screw it, and drank a couple beers

On the 2nd floor of the Union I studied and I sat

As I watched all the students, scurry around like rats. 


One played the piano, in hopes that he might

Soothe some of the students, and relieve their fright. 

Of their first exams, under the dreaded semesters, 

Which to myself was painful like a third trimester. 


I sat and I sat, then I began to fret

As my 1500 word minimum, had not yet been met.

Just at that moment, my eyes opened wide

As St. Procrastination, was clearly in sight. 


On Reddit! On Facebook! On your beloved twitter! 

Screw it, why not take a break on the shitter. 

I looked up from my mac, to take a quick break, 

And noticed that my head was beginning to ache. 


I got back to my mac, and began to type. 

With 200 words left, the end was in sight. 

May your finals not suffer the same plight, 

Good luck to you all, and have a great night!

UPDATE 1/11

Email form Rec Sports Director:

Thank you for your email regarding the bouldering wall at Jesse Owens South.  As you may know, we are in the process of opening a new bouldering wall and cave at the Outdoor Adventure Center and we expect this new offering to attract increased traffic to the facility.  We do not have plans to remove the wall at Jesse Owens South in the immediate future.  As we do with all programs and services, we will take time this semester to monitor the use of the bouldering wall at Jesse Owens South and use the information to make decisions about what we offer the university community. I appreciate your feedback and your enthusiasm about Student Life’s Recreational Sports offerings.  Have a great spring semester!


The wall lives to fight another day! Time to get out there and use it this semester so we can ensure its permanence! He said their were no immediate plans to remove it, but my friend who is the OSU student in charge of the wall, was told by staff they would be taking it down on the 14th. So I think we really made a difference. Go team.

I would like to take a moment and just remind you to look when you cross the street.  A lot of people jay-walk (I don't care) but they blindly walk into the street without looking.  This could end up very badly!  (Please note that I'm not trying to be a pretentious cocky biker asshole)  So just look out for us and we'll look out for you.  Enjoy the nice weather!

I've gone to a catholic school all my life and loved it. I feel like nd is a great fit for me, but it's super expensive. I could leave osu debt free. 1 How important is that? 2 I always hear, sure you can make osu small, but really? It's huge! As a slight introvert who is definitely socially aware but doesn't exactly love raging, can I fit in? 3 Should I room with my best friend? Even though its so big I'm afraid if I go to osu I will only hang out with my friends from high school. There will be close to 100 guys going from my school. 4 what's the allure of south campus besides partying? I will be a business major, so I figured north campus would be smart since it is near the b school, plus the lack of air conditioning and sharing of bathrooms is a bit of a south campus turnoff. 5 what else should I know about osu, especially when comparing it to a private, smaller, more expensive school like Notre dame.

- dont take Credit cards, wallets, anything you are afraid to lose. Duct tape your room key to your ass.

- designate someone to watch your shit if you do decide to take something as it will get stolen

- dont fuck with the cops and they wont mess with you. They are there to ensure your safety (but some will join in if you toss up an O-H at them)

- be smart. It's 50 degrees tonight (one of the warmest in my 4 years here) and still cold. People get hypothermia and other bull shit. When you get back to your dorm, use warm water, not burning hot, otherwise you'll have a bad time.

1326239415.0	objd6	Would anybody be interested in lunch?	I_am_the_cheese	35	8	66	"The longer you're in school the harder it is to meet new people. I just wanted to see if there would be any interest in meeting up and getting a meal later this week or this weekend? I'm not sure how many people will respond, but perhaps there could be a small group meetup? I don't know. I just feel like I should try and meet some new people. So, what do you think?

EDIT: I don't have any specific plans, I was just seeing if there was any interest, and it seems there is. Feel free to suggest! I personally don't have a meal plan, but I'm open to anything. Some have suggested making deals for swipes and going to Kennedy Commons; I like that idea. Or if someone is loaded on swipes and wants to make a ton of friends, they could take care of everybody....anybody?


EDIT 2: I'm going to take charge here and set the time and location for ***Kennedy Commons at 4:30pm on Friday.*** That's when they open back up for dinner. Myself, and I'm sure some others, don't have swipes. I'm more than willing to pay cash, or work out some other deal with somebody that does have swipes.

It is far too large for it to simply be gone for good. If I remember the dimensions correctly it was 8ft long, 3ft wide and 3 feet tall. It was solid wood with no moving parts. I put a lot of time into painting and building it. It weighed nearly 200 lbs and would take several people to steal it. It was all black with an OSU logo in the middle. I don't wish to involve police if it is found I would just like it back. I am willing to offer a reward of some kind. PM me if you see it. Thanks!

1348072067.0	1054qj	OSU Urban explorers?  Check out the Gates of Hell!	TheTyger	29	5	14	"If anyone wants to do a little Urban Exploration in the Campus area, I thought I would point out a cool area that a group of friends and I checked out back when we were Seniors.

If you head north of campus, and park behind the Tim Horton's (or just around there), and head back, you come upon a drainage runoff.  Follow that back towards High St., and there is a really cool, graffiti covered tunnel.  I would include links and pictures, but it is much cooler to see it for yourself.  Just make sure to wear boots, bring a Flashlight (even in the day), and do not go when it is raining.  The area is named for the large metal gates that are in place to presumably block large debris like trees from flowing into the tunnel and blocking the water flow.  You can traverse the entire tunnel, and will end up behind the Giant Eagle (I think that is what was there). Good fun for a weekend activity.  

Note:  If memory serves, it is Trespassing to head there, so you'll want to keep that in mind as you head out.  But if you are looking for something fun and different, the Gates of Hell is a really cool exploration trip for a group of friends.

I apologize if any of my landmarks are no longer there, as it has been some years.  

EDIT: Some people are noting that you should probably not go there unless you are up to date on your Hobo-Stab Insurance.  So, yeah, explore at your own risk."	t5_2qj3f	True

I'm not sure what to do. If I change sections, it will be obvious to both the ta and prof and perhaps obvious why, and I don't want to seem insensitive to the ta (am I?), but at the same time, this is a recognized tough prof and I want any advantage I can get.

The next week I awkwardly caught a kid who otherwise would have landed on his butt thanks to your unexpected quick stops. Once, I was stupidly trying to do homework while standing, and I fell into a random guy's lap when you quick-stopped at a light. 

But you know what? I've learned to appreciate your driving style. You've waited for me numerous times as I sprinted across the commuter parking lot trying to catch the bus, and I swear you even smiled at me once after I breathlessly thanked you. When I'm waiting on the curb and I see you driving the next bus to Academic Core, I smile a little because I know I won't be late for my morning class. I know if there was ever any funny business going on in your bus, you'd put a stop to it faster than any of those other scrawny boy drivers. You're professional, quick, and you give off definite badass vibes.

1365989332.0	1cd09t	I'm a Junior in high school and I have a few questions about tOSU	Zerenium	22	4	63	"I'm a Buckeye and I can only see myself attending The Ohio State University. The only problem is that I'm worried that I may not get in.
I'm your classic low-GPA-high-test-score student. I have a 3.0 but I got a 31 on my ACT. This low GPA is largely attributed to my frequent bouts of depression due to a certain female, which probably sounds really stupid but it really messed with my head.

Anyways, My GPA has since improved drastically, as I went from a 1.8 last semester to a 3.9 weighted this semester, 3.7ish unweighted. So there's a definite positive trend. I also have extra curriculars that I'm a part of, such as student council, band, musical, and two volunteer organizations. I'm a board member of a council that is opening up a local teen center for hosting teenager-only events after football games and such. I've also taken difficult classes (AP calc, lang, psych, chem, physics, and two years of honors math and english). I would like to go into computer science and I'm an out of state student (Family moved from Archbold, OH to that state up north, sadly).

Do extra curriculars really help that much? Do you think I have a shot of getting in? I can and plan on improving my ACT score. Any hope?

You are not invincible. The cross walk is not a wall. If you are not paying attention, you WILL get hit. It's happened far too often in the past and can easily be avoided. Take your goddamn earbuds out and pay attention to the world around you. Your ipod will pause.

Show some respect to the people in cars, waiting at crosswalks. If they've been waiting before you even got to the intersection, let them go. Cross after they pass. Too often does traffic get backed up beyond belief, causing more reckless drivers trying to beat people across the street. 
 
A few seconds of your time can mean a world of difference for both cars and people. I know most of you on reddit are smarter than your average person walking about, but it pisses me off to no end when one person walks in front of a car already moving at 15 mph to get through an intersection and has to slam on their brakes.

Be smart, be kind, and stay alive.

I'm a third year Psychology major at OSU. This summer I started a position in the Student Life: Risk Management department. There are plenty of rumors going on about the renovations on campus, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have!

**Edit 1:** A note concerning the North Campus Project: It's a rough moment for this big project. This is mainly due to the fact that Gordon Gee was the one who pushed for this project to start, and was supposed to start this Fall, starting with the demolition of Scott House. However, now that Gee isn't here, they have decided to keep Scott open for the upcoming year and fill it with students. This may mean that the project is on a temporary hold. However, the construction crew for the project will be using Halloran (or Haverfield, I don't exactly remember) for their offices, which could mean that the project is still expected to happen.

So many great questions! Feel free to keep them coming! I'm more than happy to provide the answers you've been looking for!"	t5_2qj3f	True

I literally walked around Thompson for 30+ minutes, and over and over I saw the same study cubbies with shit just left there, as if that is excusable with how full Thompson is right now.

So.. back to the point.  How long before you would say ""fuck yo shit"" to whomever and move their shit onto the ground / throw it away / incinerate it / shred it?  As far as I'm concerned, even 20 minutes is a little much for finals week.

You'd be sharing the bottom floor of a freshly painted house with me. 

Features of the place include: 

* Rent being under $400/month including ALL utilities
* Southwest campus area: fairly quiet and safe and a five-minute walk from the Union, South Campus Gateway, or Jesse Owens South
* Off-street parking
* Free laundry in the basement
* Super nice landlord
* Full kitchen
* Lovely hardwood floors
* A HUGE room, big enough for a queen-sized bed, full desk, many dressers, and more with plenty of floor space to spare 


Age and gender don't matter, and I don't really have any rules about drinking/overnight guests as long as all parties are respectful. 

PM me with info about yourself and your living habits and I'll give you more info about myself, the place, and how else to contact me/when we can meet!

The_Line_Judge	25	9	18	"It's a bit strange to think that we are one of the largest campuses in the nation but we only have just over 3000 readers. I want to try and get other OSU redditors here so that maybe this subreddit could develop further. 

A discussion about this issue has already been made somewhere, but I want to bring it up again. I think it's been brought up that some alumni leave because it's more geared to current students with advertisements and questions concerning other students and academics. Maybe if we could change the content more so that all OSU redditors could actively participate or generate some interest. 

These some thoughts I had, use this post to talk about other suggestions others might have. Hopefully we can put these into action and make this subreddit even bigger.

As a result of a recent break up I find myself in need of a place to live. I'm not too picky about location, as long as we're talking about the campus area (or maybe as far north as Clintonville.)

A little about me: I'm a junior, and I'm turning 21 in about a month. I just switched to the Public Affairs major after jumping around the various arts programs and taking last year off. I've lived off campus for three years, so I'm familiar with all the ins and outs of renting and roommate life. Although I'm not a huge partier, I'm not opposed to living with someone who is. I do like to have friends over every once in a while, but we don't get that rowdy.

I'm a non smoker, but smoking doesn't bother me as long as it's outside. I would prefer to have a cat, but I can find another place for her if it comes down to that. I have class five days a week (ugh, semesters) and I work five days a week, so I'm out of the house a lot. I'm pretty quiet (but not awkwardly so) and I like to read a lot, so I won't be too bothersome.

I'm 420 friendly, but because of the nature of my major and the kinds of jobs/internships I'll be taking, I'm probably not going to be partaking in the green festivities.

1347569601.0	zuaht	So there seems to be enough interest for a OSU Hookah meetup.	bigiberg	15	2	18	"I say we start planning this.  What time works for everyone?  As far as the actual hookah goes, I have a KM and enough shisha, but I think it'd be cool if we had a lot of different hookahs.  Location?  I've never planned a meetup so I'd like as much community input as possible.  Can't wait!

Edit: It looks like Friday night is the night to go.  Unless there are major problems I'm setting the date for the 21st.  And I think the amphitheater is good also.  So 7pm?  With Mowseph and brewed849 bringing their hookahs, plus mine, 3 hookahs for 10ish people should be great.  Does this work for everyone?"	t5_2qj3f	True
1346518666.0	z6unv	Meal plans are ridiculously priced this year. Here is my analysis:	Kerrminater	15	1	11	"*Note: I sent this in an email to OSU's director for dining services today. If you feel similarly I would recommend that you also email him about the content of this post at his email, ahmed.290@osu.edu, so that we can get change enacted sooner rather than later*

When I heard about the new semester meal plans (blocks), I was excited, because they had more function than the swipes previously available. I do not eat very much. I ended each quarter last year with at least 15 swipes, and that is after doing things like buying meals for friends who live off campus, buying pizza for club events, and buying the C Store in North Commons out of applesauce to bring home to my family at the end of the quarter. I am not cheap by any means, but I would not have done these things if I did not have the extra meal swipes from my plan. I simply had to use them or lose them.

As a frugal person, this pains me. I am living on full scholarship (minus work study) which I gained partly through financial aid being great. My family does not have the means to support my schooling in any substantial financial way. I still have almost all of my scholarship disbursement from last year in my bank account, because I am saving it for graduate school if I can't be so lucky as to get that paid for as well.

Meal swipes were one thing, because there was a variety of options, and I could opt for the lowest one. Honestly, I felt it was adequate for a low plan. A student who didn't know better could spring for it and be left without meals for a couple weeks at the end of a quarter, which I observed in more than one case. But for me, 100 swipes was more than enough.

Blocks are a different story. There are two choices for blocks which I feel are adequate for the average student. These are the 450, and the 600 block plans. Payment this year has broken down like this: for $2025, you get 450 block worth 5 dollars at dining locations at $4.50 a block. 50 cents off for every block? A pretty good deal in bulk. The 600 block plan breaks down similarly, except you pay $4 per block instead of $4.50. A better deal! It always pays to buy in bulk, right?

Except when regional and off campus plans are garnering the same advantages at a lower amount. The Block 160 plan gets the same 4.50 per block discount as the Block 400. I can understand some amount of preferential treatment: the commuters need a reason to buy blocks, and a discount is the only way to warrant that. But the discount for on-campus students is nowhere near proportional to this discount. 

With the Block 80 at $4.69 a block, and 160 at $4.50 a block, proportionately the discount for the 450 plan should be $3.59 a block. The 600? $3.16. Like I said, I understand some preferential treatment. But these discounts are grossly undersized when compared to off-campus meal plans. I do not presume to be an economist, but there is a dissonance here which could be addressed. But I don't expect that, because OSU has become a business and its dining needs to be a good source of income. So I will dismiss this claim on the basis that my other requires fulfillment:

450 Blocks, in proportion to the 100 swipes that I had last year. Let's do some more math to figure out what the monetary difference is.

I will use the same standard that the URDS used in the semester conversion, which is simply to make what I paid in 3 quarters match what I will pay in two semesters.

I wanted to do a comparison to see the difference between the price of the traditional meal plan for 2011 and 2012, but the data for 2011 is not available anywhere. So I will have to account for this.

Last year I lived in Taylor Tower. If I were still living there this year, the cost of my room would have increased 6.2%. This is pretty fair, considering all of the construction that is planned. OSU's room and board was scheduled to increase 5.7%. So, the meal plan's average rise must have been planned to be 5.2% to match this figure.

Last year I paid $1125 per quarter for 100 swipes. This adds up to $3375 per year. An increase of 5.2%, $175.50, would put this at approximately $3550.50. My 450 Block meal plan this year is $2025. Multiplied by two is $4050. This is a 500 dollar difference alone that I have to pay this year.. Now, if a swipe is equivalent to two blocks, this is quite a bit of value. We really are getting the $1.70 savings that was mentioned more than once as this plan was announced. 

But I don't need 450 blocks, not by a long shot. Let's take a look at what I used last year. I usually ended my quarters with about 15 swipes left over of my 100. Multiplied to the whole year, out of my 300 swipes I had about 45 left over that I didn't use, which is a fair chunk of cash. Now I can put this in proportion to blocks. If I had 600 blocks, 300 per semester, I would end up with about 45 blocks. Pretty safe, right? And considering I had excess expenses before that number, there is really no way that an eater like me would go below that number. But that isn't how many blocks I am getting! I am getting 450 per semester, or 900 per year. So, I am on track to end up with at least 195 blocks left over per semester. And I can't be the only one.

So, let's imagine the 300 block plan. Actually, the university has expenses to pay, so let's go with Block 350. If you charged $4.75 per block, which I think is pretty fair proportionately, not counting my commuter vs. campus resident talk earlier, this plan would be $3325, or $3475 with the $150 BuckID cash. I know that this option is not even as much as the price hike that inflation creates, the 5.2% I mentioned earlier, but there needs to be an option in place for students from low income households who are frugal, or people like me who do not eat large meals and a snack twice a day, or both, like me. If it has to be the $3550, so be it. We just need a plan that is on the lower end.

I am impressed with the discount that blocks present, even if commuters get a real benefit when it comes to them. But the university cannot presume to force students to buy meal blocks in bulk, without a fair discount, to make up for the lost money from swipes. This is something that will be very frustrating for students come December, me counted among them.

I entreat you and your department, please give options to those of us who are currently experiencing this problem soon by next semester, and to those in the future who will fall into the same dilemma.

TL;DR: Commuters are getting much fairer prices for their meal plans and dining services is making up for the better value of blocks than swipes by forcing you to buy in bulk.

EDIT: I actually made a mathematical error with my percentages. It's pretty hard to extrapolate potential increases as compared to the actual numbers of new meal plans. Anyways, I did more research and it turns out room and board actually increased about 10% this year from my last year. This means that under swipes I could have expected to pay something closer to the amount for blocks, but this is still a matter of about 300 dollars different than what I paid before. I still am yearning for a different plan."	t5_2qj3f	True

I *like* mathematics and physics. As for the former, I have a great aptitude. The latter is kind of, surprisingly, one of the most *interesting* subjects I had in high school, despite that I was never really good at science stuff (I usually have Cs in physics tests). 

I am fascinated by data and stuff and found an article about data science/analysis. I have been thinking that I could be good in that industry, since I am also interested in statistics and very great at math (unnecessary info: I am Asian).

For this last year of high school, these are my current math and science courses: AP Statistics, Advanced PreCalculus, and Advanced Physics. As for my interest in computers and general technology, I have attempted to learning some languages (I know html and I have started Java but never finished). I am not really good at programming and do not really want to spend a lot of time on it. 

I initially decided to major in psychology, since I was thinking that I could be a researcher (which I also would like to do).  I am taking AP Psychology at the moment.

However, I have been thinking lately that maybe I should change my major to CSE or CIS (or something else that's really useful, like mathematics). What are the differences between CIS and CSE though? Engineering seems really popular right now. And I've never really had an exposure on the subject (although my uncle is a Civil Engineer).

I was at the OSU/Wisconsin basketball game and was and always am amused by the student section with the giant faces that are waved around as the opposing team is taking a free throw.  So, at the very least they're entertaining, but does this kind of stuff actually work?  Have the basketball players learned to just completely block all this stuff out?

If not, what about optical illusions?  What if the student section was organized well enough to all hold up signs in a certain way so as to create an optical illusion?  I'm sure we've all seen a number of illusions on the internet where something looks like it's spinning when it's really not or certain objects look bigger/smaller, or whatever.  I remember reading an article about tennis and how tennis players were now banned from wearing anything neon green (tennis ball color) because in the brief moment that the ball crosses over that color the opposing player would briefly lose track it it and therefore throw him/her off thereby being at a disadvantage.  Obviously, a basketball free throw is vastly different than that, but you get the idea.

Is it possible that some combinations of colors could be held up or signs waved/moved around in a certain way so as to create some distortion for the free thrower?  Does anyone know anyone who has some insight into optics or optical illusions that could give a serious/intelligent answer?

Again, possibly an insane/dumb idea, but does anyone have a good answer?  Also, I don't see why this couldn't be extended to football games and field goals."	t5_2qj3f	True

I'm trying to find a place to live, and if you're interested in a potential roommate, I'm looking into a place on Neil and Dodridge offered by Pellaco (please don't take this one from me; I haven't signed a lease form yet) which is about a mile north of campus. It's 2 bed/1 bath, and rent according to the webpage is $650.00 to $750.00/mo. PM me for the webpage.

If you have something else in mind, too, I'd be happy to consider it - I would like to be close to campus, though, since I'm not bringing a car. 

I'm coming from California, and since money's tight, I won't be able to view the apartment before I arrive. If you're able to visit and let me know of your opinion on the place before signing, I'd really appreciate it. I will likely arrive on July 13th or 14th for my departmental orientation, teaching job training, and qualifying exam prep.

1365515071.0	1bzl9u	Smoking / Tobacco Ban	mick4state	30	19	51	"I don't like it for many reasons.

* It *seems* less about worry over smoke and health effects and more about overt discrimination against tobacco users.
* It *seems* like there were a number of ""compromise"" options that were pushed to the wayside.

I also worry about how they'll enforce it. I don't see many options. (Note that these are the possibilites I can see and my thoughts on each of them. There could be other options I have not yet considered.)

* OSU Police/Security will enforce the ban. This is unacceptable. Campus PD/Security exist for the sake of student safety, and any attention turned away from this pursuit is dangerous for students.
* A new agency/group will enforce the ban. So where does the money come from? From ticketing an already poor student population during hard economic times? Unacceptable. From funds designated for education? Unacceptable.
* No enforcement mechanism. In this case the rule would be a rule in word only. In such a case, why even have the rule?

I'm a non-smoker who used to smoke a pack a day. I enjoy avoiding the smell of smoke as much as anyone. But this feels like discrimination to me. ^(Yes, discrimination is a broad word. Yes, there are far worse offenses and degrees of discrimination. But the existence of those does not change the definition of the word nor the fact that this qualifies.) I even emailed Gee about it and he said (in different words) ""I know. We're allowed to discriminate against tobacco users.""

Basically I'm interested in starting/organizing a peaceful opposition to this ban. The student body can stand against the ban while still supporting courteous smoking habits like standing downwind of non-smokers and staying away from doors and heavily crowded areas. Hell, even cancer rings are better than an outright ban. These options are more reasonable and should have received more consideration. 

If you're interested in opposing this move by the university, let me know.

I know my life will be different as a grad student. So if you're a grad student, where do you live? theres this stigma at KU that grad students don't like to to live in our ""student ghetto"" which are just old historic houses, that are kind of renovated (enough to live in) that a lot of undergrads live in within walking distance from campus. lots of partying happens here, but if you find a good house its quiet and fine. what is housing like? within walking distance from campus? with dishwashers? (i really want a dishwasher) is it older houses segmented into apartments, or are there apartment complexes? is it easy to bike to?

1371953300.0	1gvyyg	Undecided about enrolling at OSU	mullrboy	18	8	24	"Hey redditors from OSU!!

I'm an international student from India, and I just visited the campus today. I was pretty impressed with the Student Union and the friendly manner of the students here. The central University campus is beautiful, is right next to downtown Columbus, and the College of Engineering (my intended major is Electrical Engineering, Honors program) is ranked pretty well too. Because Columbus is a pretty big city, getting a job after graduation and probably settling down in Ohio won't be that hard. Plus, because there's such a large student population (around 40,000) there won't be any problem with making new friends and joining student associations.

But when I talked with a few shop owners they told me that OSU was a big-time party school and places like High Street are filled with drunk people almost every evening. Plus at around 7 o clock the area around the University buildings was filled with seedy looking people lurking everywhere, some who stared at me rather intently. Many of the housing buildings also look quite run down and old (my uncle's observation, not mine!) and there were a lot of shady characters there as well.

To be honest I have nothing against party schools. But by nature I'm a rather studious and serious guy who wants to come to college to study and do research as an undergrad. I'm paying quite a lot for my tuition fees as an international student, and I want to make the MOST of it. I also heard that OSU has a huge football culture and everybody's into it. To be honest I don't really follow sports a lot and am not into college sports. Is The Ohio State University the right place for me? Please reply honestly"	t5_2qj3f	True

I'm going into my second year at UCF in Florida and am thinking of transferring to OSU (for a few reasons, not important). I've noticed you guys have different degrees tailored towards different interests, such as the CIS and CSE program. I think this is pretty interesting, as the school I'm attending now as just the general computer science degree.


So I guess what I'm wanting to know is: What course did you take in computer science? How was your experience at OSU? How common are internships at big companies like Google? Those who may of graduated, where are you now? 

I'm also interested in what companies often hire OSU CS students. For those who aren't interested in making video games, such as myself, most have goals of making it to Google or Facebook or whatnot. Not everyone for sure, but that seems like the general census of most CS majors at my university.

I just wanted some feedback on what OSU is like, as I don't know anyone who goes there.  Are there a decent number of people from out of state, and do they have an easy time making their way in?  Really just overall impressions of the school, as I am unlikely to be able to visit.  Would be greatly appreciated!

Edit:  Thanks for the really helpful feedback.  Just some random questions:
What do you do for fun, during the day and at night?

I will be entering my junior year this Autumn and am currently enrolled in the Information Systems program at Fisher. Lately, I've been second-guessing my specialization choice...

Speaking with recent graduates of the program, bosses (who surveyed a few industry connections that would potentially hire an IS graduate) and tons internet research, has me thinking that IS might not be the best option for me.

The reason I got into IS is because I want to work with computers. Recognizing that, I've started to realize that Computer Science &amp; Engineering is where I should have been.

What I'd like to know:

Objectively, would you rather leave OSU with a CSE degree or an IS degree and why? 

Has anyone successfully switched schools (or even specializations) this late in their college career? *Few requirements are interchangeable :(.*

All input is appreciated!

I contacted the University regarding non-traditional/graduate housing, with one available place being in the Gateway (read: too expensive), and the other being off of Indianola. I have contacted friends who know the area, and they have indicated that it is not in a good part of town.

Does anybody know of any good places to look, or have any openings?

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/osudota

If you haven't played DOTA before, it's a lot of fun if you're in a group of friends. If you have played LoL, it's like that, but with much more theory involved and bit more micromanagement (if you can pull 80%+ last hits as Draven, you're about ready to play an average DOTA carry, other roles are a bit more comparable, except support, jungle, and suicide-laners). You also don't need to grind. 

Invites to DOTA2 are either free if you're willing to fill out a survey and wait ( http://www.dota2.com/survey/experience/ ), or about 5 dollars (2 keys from the DOTA store is the going rate for an invite). Obviously we'd be willing to help you learn the game if you're willing to play it.

I know that I'll get ripped off pretty harshly already, just figured I'd ask where you guys/gals resell in order to get the most money back. I was thinking UBX, and if Barnes and Noble is as heartbreaking as they are when selling books, I'm definitely avoiding it.

**edit:** I sold back my physiology book for about $90 at SBX, and am looking into selling a few more on Amazon. Thanks!"	t5_2qj3f	True

1331796901.0	qxipv	Any Buckeye (undergrad) alums that returned to OSU to pursue a Master's or PhD?	Glossophile	10	1	19	"Hey, I got two degrees from OSU back in 2008 (Linguistics and French) and I'm now pursuing my M.A. in Linguistics at the U of Utah. It's a really long story but, I basically do not want to stay here to pursue my PhD and I'm looking at possible PhD programs to which I would like to apply. 

Usually in the field of linguistics you do not attend the university which you attended for your B.A/B.S. for a higher degree, like your PhD (because of different schools of thought on theories, etc. and the whole ""let's be diverse and learn new things"" type thing). Anyway, I've contact the Dept. chair and she said I would totally be considered since I've branched out and studied at a school quite different than OSU.

 Basically, the only thing I want to know is how different is OSU as a grad student than when you were an undergrad? I was REALLY involved around campus as an undergrad and sometimes I think I fantasize about my years at OSU. I think sometimes people get sick of me comparing UofU to OSU, but I just can't help it and as a buckeye I'm sure you all understand how it is! Even better, has anyone left OSU, pursued a degree and then returned back to OSU to pursue another? Of course I know what being a grad student is like, but I'm just afraid that by returning to OSU, it may be so different that I may end up not liking it. The program is wonderful and the only reason I'm even considering OSU again is because of that reason, as well as the opportunity I will get in getting a graduate certificate in Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies. I'd love to hear about your experiences.

**tl;dr:** I got two B.A.s from OSU, doing my M.A. at UofUtah and thinking of returning to OSU for PhD, how different is being an undergrad at OSU from being a grad student (more on the OSU side of things and not the grad school side of things).

**EDIT**: I'm not really looking for advice on grad school. I've successfully applied and have entered into a graduate program. My question is more about your social life and connections to extra-curricular sort of things with the University. Do you still attend football? Here in Utah I don't, cause the Utes aren't that amazing and it just wouldn't be the same, sitting in a stadium that holds less than 50,000 people."	t5_2qj3f	True

It was my freshman year, autumn quarter I had Dr. Stoltzfus.  He was an amazing, caring, and funny teacher.  He cared so much about the students and their success.  He has so much passion for teaching Chem 121 and other classes.  At the end of the year he made a slideshow for our class to sum up the quarter, it was comprised of our SEI comments(which were hilarious) and his personal reasons why he started teaching and getting his degree.  It was a sad and beautiful message toward the end(about his mom's death) and he had almost everybody in the class in tears.  I was tearing up too.  After I got out of that class, I said he was going to be the best teacher that I will have at OSU.  Still holds.
