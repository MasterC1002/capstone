1361986089.0	19c5fl	Not to toot my own horn, but I had an epiphany regarding the 2A after reading some other Redditor's comments- this realization puts to rest any debate about 2A. Self-post so as not to karma whore.		298	47	96	"I wrote this out as a response to someone else but was buried and I think more gun-lovers should be read and be aware of this- I wasn't. (The commenter said I left out the ""well regulated milita"" part in my citing the amendment, a common point of arguing when confronted by hoplophobes.)

This is a common and severe misunderstanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Let me explain.

You have to understand who these documents are speaking to, and who is saying it. The Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights are speaking to the government. You know, ""We the People"".
The Bill of Rights does not grant rights to the people. Those rights, unless specifically handed over to the government, rest inherently with the people. That's the entire idea behind the constitution- a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

The second amendment is not speaking to the people, it's speaking to the government. The second amendment is not saying, ""hey citizen, you're allowed to have a gun if you're part of a militia or if you're well regulated or this or that."" No. The second amendment does not grant rights. We already inherently have those rights. Instead, the second amendment speaks to the government and says, ""hey government, the people need guns to be able to form a militia so that they may overthrown you if need be"".

There is no ""you can have a gun if you're in a militia"". It's the other way around. ""Government cannot curtail the rights of the citizens to own guns, because they need to be able to form a militia"".

There is no ambiguity here, this is the sole reason for the second amendment- to overthrow a tyrannical government, and the dialogue through hundreds of years has never disputed that fact until some very misinformed people very recently, who clearly have never read the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. (That our firearms also allow us to hunt and target shoot and protect our families is a bonus.) Assistant Chief Justice Joseph Story, in the late 1800's, predicted this day when people would forget why that amendment was written, he predicted that people would find it absurd that we would want to be able to overthrow the government, and when that day comes, we are in for some bad times.

**TL;DR:** We don't even need a second amendment. Citizens inherently have the right to own guns. The second amendments speaks clearly to the government that they are never to take our guns away, because the power must remain with the people."	t5_2ryez	True

Gentlemen, Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey with his toady Harry Reid of Nevada have decided that in the wake of the Boston bombings all explosive powder needs to be regulated and anyone making explosives at home (that's us) will need a permit.

Do you really want to need a permit to reload?  Buy powder with a background check?

Never mind these idiots used $400 worth of fireworks to get their explosives, it's the reloading community's fault for being able to buy smokeless powder (and black powder) off the shelves.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/25/lautenberg-pushing-explosives-restrictions/

They're buying up all the ammunition and now they're coming after reloaders.

Did I mention that the bill says nothing about fireworks?

My daughter is almost four.  Since she was old enough to notice, she has always been fascinated by the pistol.  I talk to her about the Four Rules in simplistic enough terms that she can spit them back at my by rote.  She can walk me thorough field stripping the pistol.  She isn't strong enough to operate the pistol or disassemble it, but she can point out every step to me.

A couple of days ago, she got some kind of spring loaded toy in a kids meal that shoots cardboard disks.  When I arrived home that evening she was beside herself with excitement to show me her new gun.  We sat down and she show me how to clear it, pretended to disassemble and reassemble it, and then came her crowning moment.  She look at her mother and me and said, ""Mommy, Daddy.  The gun is loaded and very, very dangerous now.  I'm going to put it over here so don't touch it unless you ask me first.""

My wife looked at me and said, ""I think she's OK."" 

Edit: Another reason I posted this is because so many parents (those who do and don't own guns) teach their kids to fear guns.  They should teach them to respect them instead.  Fire is a tool for survival.  Similarly, it should be respected and used with care because of it inherently destructive qualities."	t5_2ryez	True

Water cannons blinding, injuring, and killing people. Gangs of riot police beating up even lonely women or teenagers. 

These protests started due to a park being demolished (where people peacefully assemble), and Erdogan (the Islamofascist leader) wanted to build a shopping mall and mosque there. Turks are tired of taxpayer money being used to build more Mosques. They are tired of being oppressed by a democratically-elected Islamic regime that fines TV stations for blasphemy and jails journalists and the military for being non-religious and opposing them.

Police are [raiding peoples' homes and destroying all sorts of property as well.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-982715)

There are reports of police shooting live rounds into peoples' heads and ambulances can't get there because the roads are blocked.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/03/world/europe/turkey-protests/index.html  (video shows many incidents)

The government has been cutting off electricity to disable WiFi. They've also cut internet access to Twitter/Facebook by extorting some private corporate ISPs through government pressure (so much for free-market AKP).

---
Turkey has no right to bear arms. It has freedom of speech supposedly, but arrests are commonly made for political dissent.

Erdogan, the prime minister, and the AKP government has also silenced opposition, arresting many military officials and ex-parliamentarians (opposing parties) for ""coup plots / overthrow plots""--essentially thought crime. They have targeted them based on their political views, not because they have any evidence.

Since the courts, parliament, presidency, and prime ministership are controlled by the AKP, they don't have to provide any evidence. Just fake some word documents and keep them in jail and in the courts indefinitely.

In Turkey you cannot buy most firearms, you're only allowed a certain amount of bullets if you have a hunter's license and only certain firearms. 

Yet the police is militarized and has all sorts of weapons in their arsenal. The police are seen as the loyal arm of Erdogan and because of fears of the secular military, Erdogan has armed them to the teeth.

Continue defending your 2nd amendment rights. It's what keeps government accountable. Appreciate that you live in a country where you are allowed all sorts of firearms but definitely ask for more and fight every registry and every ban.

I thought this would interest you all knowing what exactly you are fighting for and what the founding fathers of the US thought about when writing the 2nd amendment. They knew from the Battle of Concord and Lexington that oppressive governments would do anything in their power to silence opposition and guns are the only way for revolution.

**TL;DR:** Defend your 2nd amendment rights, or you will end up like Turkey, victims of a police state, getting beat up no matter how peacefully you protest your rights---and hoping the army will save the day (which has been neutered by the government with hundreds of military officials sitting in jail for progressive political views).

**edit:** added a bit of context because some people didn't realize why these protests were happening and were comparing it to Libya/Sweden/Syria/Egypt, and this is completely the opposite kind of protest. These are secular people protesting against Islamic fundamentalist regime---not Islamic fundamentalists protesting an authoritarian secular leader."	t5_2ryez	True

If you read the blurb on the sidebar you will see that we're going to value the first amendment just as much as the second. I have a few things to say about how this place will be moderated.

I want to keep this place as close to a direct democracy as possible. I would love to say that the only rule is that there are no rules, but there will be SOME content moderation. No child pornography will be allowed. Stuff like that.. I need your help to actually figure out what can endanger the community legally. As far as content goes, anything goes. It's not my job to determine what is in the best interest of the community. That is the community's job. Flaming is allowed. Racism is allowed. Homophobia and other forms of bigotry are allowed. But It is my hope that these things will not be tolerated. Because in the end it's up to the community to use downvotes to censor its self.

If you could reply with a few things that you think should be allowed/disallowed (CP is an example of something that we will delete without hesitation), please do so and if you see something you like, use the voting system to get it to the top. If you have any ideas, now is your chance to run them by us. Whatever the community wants, the community gets.

I've had a few requests for moderators. I made RB23 a mod a few months ago (I'm pretty sure I was drunk) as a sort of joke, but I will contact him in a bit to see if he understands what I'm going for here. I am not looking for new moderators right now. Until we hit the 5 or 10,000 subscriber mark I am confident that I can handle the sub with just two mods. The idea is that we want less moderation and more user control via the vote system. 

Please keep in mind this type of community can easily get out of hand. 4Chan's /b/ was supposed to have had no rules, but the moderators quickly learned that certain lines do have to be drawn in the sand for legal reasons. The key phrase here is ""arbitrary censorship"". Mods here will not ban or delete posts because they think it is spam or because they think some gun shop owner is trying to advertise or whatever the fuck drama happened that caused this quick influx of 1500 members. That is precisely what the vote system is here for. Please use it. 

It's my goal to never go back on this policy.

I work for is about as strong pro-guns as they come (as am I). If you want to earn our eternal gratitude, please do the following:

*Only call the Representative or Senator that represents you. Any calls to other Reps. or Sens. only create pointless work for us and the Congressman/woman you called will never see it. Yes, this includes Feinstein and Boehner.

*Simply tell us to log your view as being against the AWB and against the magazine capacity limitation (if that's your personal view) and we will log you as such. You need to provide your name and mailing address to be entered into the system that the Member of Congress looks at (in most offices).

*Lecturing me or my co-workers on the fact that ""assault rifles"" is a bullshit term, etc. is pointless. If you really want to debate the Rep/Sen's view on the issue, ask to speak to their 2nd Amendment/Firearms Legislative Assistant. We have ZERO input into how the Congressman votes.

EDIT: It's pretty much a one man-one vote system. Once you express your views once, we mark you as such, and thats it. Multiple calls/letters don't do anything but create more paperwork for us.

1362185676.0	19hwt6	Magpul just released a statement on their position concerning magazine sales to LEO	Chowley_1	207	28	34	"REGARDING LEO SALES

March 1st, 2013

Back in 1990, when I was deployed in Desert Shield and Desert Storm as a Marine grunt, some companies prioritized me items for my M16 for shipping that I purchased with my own funds. After getting out and forming Magpul in 1999, I established the same priority policy for Military and Law Enforcement, due to the requirements of their profession.

The same policy has been in place for 13 years now and has never been an issue until a few days ago. I do not support the idea that individual police officers should be punished for the actions of their elected officials. That said, I understand the concerns that some have with Law Enforcement officers getting special treatment while at the same time denouncing second amendment rights to another citizen in the same state.

With the fight in Colorado right now we do not have time to implement a new program, so I have suspended all LE sales to ban states until we can implement a system wherein any Law Enforcement Officer buying for duty use will have to promise to uphold their oath to the US Constitution - specifically the second and fourteenth amendments - as it applies to all citizens.

1361550659.0	190zwj	The long road to my Carry Permit and the conversion of my wife from a hoplophobe to a gun-nut.	FatherVic	197	18	79	"I’ve been married to the most wonderful woman for more than 15 years now.  We have 3 amazing children and despite life’s ups and downs, we are still as strong as ever.

There has always been one area where we just haven’t agreed in the past and that is the matter of firearms.  Roxy was raised in California around some pretty liberal people who despise guns, religion, and capitalism.  Since she’s a smart girl, she never bought into any of it and grew in her own experiences.  Where guns are concerned, she’s fine with the idea of a well-armed populace and hates attempts to trample the 2nd Amendment.   However, she’s always been a bit hoplophobic and as such I turned my attention from firearms early in our marriage, mostly because I love her more than anything.

Then it happened…
We moved to Tennessee to take a job with a small electronics company.  We sold our house and crammed everything we owned into a Penske and drove to our new (rented) townhome in Murfreesboro, sight unseen.  We didn’t have much time to look for a place to live before we moved so we picked one out on the web and made arrangements to sign a 1 year lease.

It wasn’t the nicest place.  Sure the townhome was fine, but the neighbors across the street in the apartments were less than savory.  We had a few occasions where police officers in t-shirts and the consummate “badge necklace” chased drug dealers through or past our tiny yard.  There were problems with our son being one of 2 white kids on the bus for school being bullied, there were burglaries - It was just a bad place to live.

One night, my wife woke me up because there was some yelling going on outside.  Some poor woman was being sexually assaulted (near rape).  A good-Samaritan neighbor had stepped out and tried to put a stop to it.  He was met with a pistol in his face and a good threat.  Police were called but the perpetrators left.  The next morning, the would-be rapist began going door to door threatening anyone who would “snitch”.

I called my little brother in Kansas City and he shipped his shotgun to a local FFL and I took transfer of it.  My wife and I felt so helpless.  I knew that we were way past due for some protection in the home.  It took this event for my wife to see it the same way.  The year was 2007.

We broke our lease and moved into a nice house toward the north end of town.  We enjoyed peace and prosperity.  I gave my brother back his shotgun and Roxy let me buy a Mosin.  That was 2008.

In 2009, we lost almost everything we owned when our house was destroyed by the Good Friday Tornado that ripped its way from one side of Murfreesboro to the other.  My Mosin survived and my lovely and intelligent wife decided that we needed to be more prepared for emergencies. 

For the next 2 years, we set about rebuilding our lives and planning for the future.  Money was saved, bug-out kits were assembled, and food and supplies were securely stored.

In 2011, I angled for a handgun.  It was difficult.  I had made some extra cash on a side project and used the old “everyone else is getting one” argument.  Some readers may want to know why I didn’t just “man-up” and put my foot down.  Neither of us is into that; we have built a marriage of mutual respect and no piece of iron is worth losing my family.  I reasoned with her that we needed it to be prepared, we needed it for self-defense, and most importantly, unless she could come up with a good reason why not, then it was going to happen anyway.  I received several speeches on “if any of your kids … it’s over ” And “I don’t like it but you’re a big boy”.  So I did.

After much searching, research, and putting several pistols, I settled on the Sig Sauer P250 in 9mm.  It was done.  I made every effort to keep the wife calm.  I kept it locked up, unloaded, etc.  Sure it wasn’t an effective weapon locked and unloaded but I was operating on the “baby steps” principle.

Next came getting a carry permit.  Nope.  After several arguments over the course of a year and a half the answer was no.   I respect my wife, so I decided to respect her wishes.  She, at that point was still pretty terrified of guns.  I gave up on angling for the permit…  at the time.

I feel I need to note that I couldn’t get her to agree to come shooting with me either.

So since my first purchase in January 2011, I bought a Sig 522 rifle.  I argued that it was for the kids and cheaper to shoot.  She reluctantly gave in.  Then I did some work for an acquaintance and picked up a Ruger Blackhawk as partial payment.  I also snagged a Sig P6, P220 (with 22lr kit) and a Mossberg 500 - all by winter of 2012.

The more guns became prevalent, the more comfortable she got.  I took the kids shooting, drilled them on safety and kept an open-door policy on my guns.  My kids understood that at any time, I would drop anything and let them see and handle my firearms.  The more she saw them being completely responsible, the more comfortable she became with the idea of firearms.  In October of 2012, one of her freshly divorced friends started dating a gun nut.  It then became a topic of discussion and before I knew it, I was taking a day off work to take her and her friends to the range.  It was amazing!  She said she had fun, told me which gun was her favorite to shoot (P220 – btw), but told me not to get too excited as it wasn’t really her thing.   And I found out that she is a better shot than me.

Christmas time, she let me get bb and pellet guns for the kids.  Red Ryders for the younger 2 (on pink for the girs) and a Ruger Airhawk Pellet gun for the tween.  I had made a huge breakthrough.

Then Sandy Hook and all the media that followed.  She became enraged at attempts by the media and government to vilify gun owners.  Around New Year’s, we were driving about, running errands.  The radio was on, the topic was 2A and she turned to me and said, “You had better schedule a carry permit class for us.”  

I was floored!  I looked at her and asked her if she knew what she was saying.  Her response was loud and clear, “Yes!  Who the hell are they to tell me what I can’t have!”

I figured it to be too good to be true, so I left it alone.  2 weeks later she called me at work.  She asked me if I had scheduled that class yet.  I knew she was serious.  I scheduled it and we are due in class tomorrow morning (23rd).

I made our reservations and she received her email confirmation almost immediately.  The conversation went like this:

Roxy: “It says her that I have to bring my gun...”
FatherVic: “No problem, sweetie, I have plenty of guns.”
Roxy: “What if I wanted my own gun?”
http://i.qkme.me/3t3ku4.jpg

Again I let that go, but decided that I would surprise her with a gun of her own.  We decided last week that she needed a little range time before our class.  Saturday we went to our favorite range and spent an hour shooting.  She admitted to me that she had a blast.  This week I picked up her new gun, but not before she called me (the day I was to pick it up) and asked me if she could go gun shopping and pick out a gun she wanted.  I calmly let her know that in this frenzied market, she would only be able to get what she could get and not what she wanted but that when this all settles down, I will take her shopping.

Tuesday, I picked up her brand-new small frame 38 special revolver and wrapped it in pretty paper.  She loves it.  It’s “her” gun.  She has spent the last few nights practicing its functions.  I even threw together some dummy rounds so she could practice loading.

Tomorrow is the big day and Monday we plan to turn our paperwork into the state.  It has been a long, arduous journey but it has been worth it.  I took it slow and easy.  I respected her wishes and kept my love for her in priority.  She will probably never love shooting the way I do and I will probably never love scrapbooking the way she does.  But what I have now with her is an increase in love and understanding and finally, a healthy respect for firearms.

1367738544.0	1dq0xl	"""How many Bostonians wish they had a gun two weeks ago?"""	hydrogenous	205	30	44	"Wayne LaPierre asked this in one of his recent talks. Well, let me give a bit of insight on this.

I'm from south boston. I've got scars on my knuckles. I've still got a headache from getting my License to Carry Class A. When we had the attack on the Marathon I lost a former coworker. I saw a video of her dying. I won't forget her scream. I've seen pictures of her posted on Reddit that I won't forget. Many of my coworkers knew the MIT police officer who was killed, and this whole incident hit my workplace hard.

I wore eSAPI plates during the manhunt. I work out of the area where the bombers were reported to be in. My job is high-risk, so I am licensed to open-carry and generally wear some kind of protective armor. That day I wore my IV vest and had a IIIA as a spare to lend out. I also had my ""customized"" Glock 19 on my hip and an M9 locked in my jump bag. 

When the manhunt was going down, I offered rides home to my friends and coworkers who were stranded because of the public transit shutdown. Many of my friends were scared and stranded when the MBTA shut down. Nobody could get anywhere, although the highways were strangely absent of the typical traffic. Everyone was scared and a ""Shelter in Place"" order was in effect.

And you know what? As a Bostonian who had a gun, I never once felt scared. I only felt a heightened sense of awareness. 

Lots of anti-gunners try to play us off like we are paranoid or scared of something. I'm not paranoid, and I'm not afraid. The only thing I was afraid of was not making it home to my family. I made sure they knew where the spare key to my gun safe was hidden, and gave them a plan to defend themselves. 

I lost somebody. I could have been a target. But I was armed, and I was ready and trained to defend myself, and reached out to my friends who were not able to.

1362746899.0	19wq8k	Alert; Colorado. We only need three Dems to stop these bills.	mccscott	172	29	19	"They did it. After listening to hours upon hours of testimony against the upcoming gun control bills, the democrats on the Colorado Senate Committees passed a slate of seven anti-gun bills. The full Senate will vote on these bills tomorrow. House Bills 1224, 1226, 1228, and 1229 and Senate Bills 195, 196, and 197, if passed, will severely restrict access to firearms, impose unjust burdens on responsible gun owners, and make Colorado a more dangerous place to live. Many of the senate democrats aren't listening to their constituents and are completely ignoring the bills’ disastrous unintended consequences.

I strongly encourage you to come to the capitol tomorrow and make your voices heard. The turnout on Monday was very encouraging; the capitol was completely packed with Second Amendment supporters and we could hear the car horns blaring outside all day long. You can no longer testify on the bills, but coming to the capitol tomorrow will still make a difference. Each senator should be made to look every one of you in the eyes before they vote on these bills.

If you can’t make it to the capitol, you can watch a live broadcast of the proceedings at http://www.coloradochannel.net/live-broadcast.

Contact your state senator immediately and tell them to vote “no” on these bills. You can find your local legislators here: http://votesmart.org/. Your legislators’ contact information can be found at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/Directory?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/DirectorySen?openframeset for the Senate. In addition to voicing your opinions, you should remind your legislators that you won’t forget their votes on these bills during the 2014 election. Remember that we’re trying to convince these senators not to vote on these bills, so please be polite and concise.

The bad news is that the majority party supports these bills. The good news is that not all senate democrats are completely behind the gun bills.  Below is a list of democrat legislators the Denver Post has stated could be swayed to vote “no”:
 
Angela Giron
303-866-4878
angela.giron.senate@state.co.us
 
Cheri Jahn
303-866-4856
cheri.jahn.senate@state.co.us
 
Andy Kerr
303-866-4859
andy.kerr.senate@state.co.us
 
Gail Schwartz (from a rural district-her constituents probably do not support gun control)
303-866-4871
gail.schwartz.senate@state.co.us
 
Linda Newell
303-866-4846
linda.newell.senate@gmail.com
 
We need only three votes to shoot the bills down.
Don’t get discouraged. We’ve already made waves so large they’re impossible for the gun grabbers to ignore. Let’s remind these legislators that they were not elected to advance a political ideology; they were elected to represent their constituents.
 
Sincerely,
Senator Greg Brophy

Yeah, that's silly and would never happen so lets just restrict your access.  Two week waiting period on all alcohol purchases and the government needs to run a background check on whether or not you can consume it. Perhaps in two weeks you won't be so eager to get drunk...

Oh is that ridiculous? Okay, well the BIG problem is people drinking too much and driving so let's just install breathalyzer ignition systems on every car in the United States...

No, you don't like being treated as a criminal when you sit in your car? Oh and there is the sober passenger loophole too...

These things are too ineffective.  We should reduce the amount of alcohol content in a given volume of liquid. I know you like 4-5% in beer but that is too much for you.  How about .5%? Oh and no more hard liquor!  That is FAR too dangerous for you...

I know you're a responsible adult, but it's too dangerous for YOU because there are OTHER people out there that MIGHT use it irresponsibly...


In 2010, 10,228 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for nearly one-third (31%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm

In 2009 the deaths from ""Assault (homicide) by discharge of firearms"" was 11493. (Table 10) http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_03.pdf

If you can believe the data sources listed below, then [criminals in the US kill fewer people with assault weapons than the number of people killed by police use of tasers.](http://i.imgur.com/SAb7spp.jpg)

During Feinstein's speech last Thursday, [she claimed assault weapons were used to kill more than 350 since the sunset of the previous ban in September of 2004.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGnad82pdsY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m29s) She also claimed that at least 450 additional people were injured by assault weapons. *This would seem a pretty good indicator that her data shows a number not much higher than 350, otherwise could have said 375 or 400.* If take the 350 and divide it by the 8 years (8 years, 4 months and a few days actually), you get a number just under 42 per year.

I've heard this statistic mentioned many times throughout various gun debates, but I've never once seen the article or source it was written in directly linked. I did a little sleuthing on that statistic, and was pretty disappointed by the lack of decent citation and figure releases. I was also disappointed by the poor scopes and tones of the studies. I'll elaborate:

The original article was very difficult to find and is not commonly cited by articles mentioning its figures. Here it is: http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Fulltext/2010/02000/Do_Guns_Provide_Safety__At_What_Cost_.16.aspx

First off, the article is a biased editorial, not something written with the intent of displaying proper facts or data. The article contains no charts or tables and doesn't specify the scope or method behind any of the statistics it refers to.

To comment on some of the statistics mentioned:

&gt; Suicide is the leading cause of death among gun owners in the initial years of acquisition.

Well, no shit. People buy guns with the *intent* of committing suicide. Better public health care and federally-accessible health records would pretty much eliminate this problem.

&gt; Out of 395 fatalities occurring at a family home where a gun was present, suicide accounted for 333 cases (84%); 41 were domestic violence homicides, and 12 were accidents, while only nine were shootings of an intruder.

This study comes from one private survey conducted in the 80s in the greater Seattle, WA area ([link to study mention, again without showing extended figures or collection method](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/27/AR2008062702864.html)). It is not representative of the USA as a whole, and as such the numbers presented don't come anywhere close to any national surveys or estimates. It's also worth noting that Washington's suicide rate is higher than the national average, though not by much ([source](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-statistics.html)).

And now, our favorite figure to mention:

&gt; Presence of a firearm in the home reportedly results in death or injury to household members or visitors over 12 times more often than to an intruder.

[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10516848) is the only source used to bring up that figure. It's another editorial article written by a medical chairman who has spent years writing polarizing articles on gun crime and drawing tons of criticism for his poor methods of data presentation. [His wiki page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kellermann)

**TL;DR:**

&gt; When faced with a home robbery, yes, but on the whole you are 12 times more likely to kill a visitor or family member than an intruder, and your risk of successful suicide triples.

While this has been mentioned a lot in various gun debates, its origin is VERY questionable, and I don't find it convincing or compelling at all."	t5_2ryez	True

We know that nothing we can say will ease your pain in this trying time, but you are in our thoughts and prayers, and we dearly hope that you will come to find some comfort.
That being said, there are many people, who in a very predictable fashion, are trying to use this tragedy to further their political agenda of restricting our 2nd Amendment rights. We all knew that with the re-election of Barack Obama, there would be the risk of a President unrestrained by the prospect of another campaign, who would reveal his true intentions of limiting freedom. We now see the President working with Sen. Feinstein, to revive her long discredited and discarded Assault Weapons Ban, in an attempt to harness the emotions of the moment for political gain.

&gt;We at GunAuction.com would like to publicly declare that we fully understand the core purpose of the 2nd Amendment - to maintain the balance of power that exists between the government and the governed, and that we will never compromise our standards regarding the 2nd Amendment, that it is our 1st Amendment duty to provide this marketplace to the American public.

1367941065.0	1dv7hx	Background Checks Are Back: Reid Says Only 3 More Republicans Needed to Pass (link in comments, article in text)	hollymartin	149	24	23	"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Senate Democrats are bullish on bipartisan background check legislation. He told the The Las Vegas Review in an interview released by Huffington Post, “So we are going to pick up some more votes. I may be able to get another Democrat or two. That would get us up to 57. We may only need three additional Republicans.”

According to a Senate source speaking to CNN, the following four Republicans being targeted: Sen. Kelly Ayotte (NH), Sen. Jeff Flake (AZ), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Sen. Dean Heller (NV).

“Joe Manchin called me yesterday. He thinks he has a couple more votes. The one senator, Republican Senator from New Hampshire [Kelly Ayotte], has been — wham, man has she been hit hard,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said in an interview with The Las Vegas Review Journal this past weekend, via an advance portion released to the The Huffington Post. He continued, “She’s the only senator in the northeast to vote against background checks. She went from a hugely positive number in New Hampshire — her negatives now outweigh her positives. She is being hit every place she goes. So we are going to pick up some more votes. I may be able to get another Democrat or two. That would get us up to 57. We may only need three additional Republicans. So we’ll see.”

Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) co-sponsored the background checks bill that has between 85-90% support from the public according to various polls. At least five senators who voted no on the first vote are facing severe backlash, including Republican senators. They are Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mark Begich (D-AK), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Dean Heller (R-NV). The vote was 54-46, and fell 5 short (6, technically, but Reid’s vote was a procedural vote) of passing.

Dems aren’t naming names, but the Huffington Post reported that a “source close to negotiations” said “that there were two senators who opposed Manchin-Toomey who would flip once minor, superficial changes were made to the bill.”

There were four red state Senate Dems who voted no, Sens. Pryor, Baucus, Begich, and Heitkamp. Four Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in opposing the NRA with Republican Senators Collins, Kirk, McCain, and Toomey voting for the bill. Red state Democrat Mary Landrieu took the risk to vote her conscience in spite of the political risk, voting yes on the bill.

According to a Senate source speaking to CNN , Senator Manchin is targeting four Republicans: Sen. Kelly Ayotte (NH), Sen. Jeff Flake (AZ), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Sen. Dean Heller (NV). Basically, these flippers require one sentence to be changed in the bill in order to save face for their previous no vote.

Any bill that passes the Senate still has to work its way to even getting put up for a vote in the dysfunctional Republican House of Representatives, where the NRA has a strong hold over the majority party. A February PPP poll showed that support from the NRA could actually toxic to a candidate. But each step is a step closer to forcing House Republicans to be accountable to the public for their failure to serve the public interest.

Reid did not indicate how the next vote would be presented, but it’s also possible that he will provide political cover to Republicans, whom Toomey blamed for the failure to pass the bill, saying that they were too afraid to appear to be “helping” the President.

1369541425.0	1f2edb	So I witnessed a shootout this evening with my family at a park. Now more than ever, we need to be able to defend ourselves...	FatherVic	152	35	61	"Now I'm a CCW holder and this story is interesting because while I didn't draw my firearm, I came as close as I ever want to get.

Where I go to church, we have 2 families that are moving out of state.  A couple of members of the congregation put together a farewell party for them.  The location was a park in a less than desirable area of town.  In fact, one of the people moving away (a good friend of mine) was texting me while my family and I were on our way over there, commenting about the unsavory location of the park.

We got there, had some food, had some laughs and everything seemed to be going well.  It was a small park with 2 pavilions a small soccer field and a small playground.  I would estimate that the park was probably, at most 100x100 yards, give or take.  There was a large family in the other pavilion having a birthday party with a bounce castle for their 4 year old.  Their music was pretty loud, but no one really cared.  Some of their group were congregating near an entrance to the park off of a dead-end street.  There, a group of ""local ne'er-do-wells"" had gathered to loiter.

My 2 sons were playing futbol and my daughter was at the playground with a bunch of other kids when we heard the popping of gunfire.  At first, I suspected fireworks but looked and beheld a shooter about 30-50 yards from my pavilion.  My wife and 2 sons (along with some other small children) took cover behind a trash can and I say my youngest daughter with 3 adults I knew, making a run for the fence line (not my first choice, but what are you going to do?).  I moved my hand to my firearm that I carry at about 1 o'clock and assessed the situation.

The gunfire was in the parking lot between a group of about 3-4 ""people"" (quotes because they are gang-banger scum which actually defines them as mindless animals) - it was not directed at our position.  I knew that if they came this way, they would have to go through me first.  Fortunately, they were only intent on trying to murder each other so the only risk was that of a stray bullet. I decided that drawing my weapon was not a good choice so I left it in my holster and concentrated on my family.

I looked to my wife, who by this time was screaming for me to find my daughter.  I knew where she was so I gave her a reassuring nod, and hollered to her that I had her and I would go to her.  I grabbed my youngest son and headed for the fence-line.  There, I found 20 kids and a few adults, trying to calm them down.  My children were flat on the ground, crying.  I motioned for them to get behind me.  I dialed 911 and found that they had already been contacted.  By this time, the gunfire had stopped.

People started to stir and my friend told them to stay put, ""there is always a second wave!  Stay down.""  Sure enough after 3 or 4 minutes, the shooting started again over by the entrance where the loitering was occurring and the violence had started.  It ended seconds later.

After about 8 or 9 minutes, the police finally arrived and left again quickly.  3 minutes later, they came back and taped off the area.  We stayed and waited until our vehicles were released to us and, after making sure everyone in our party was safely out of there, my family and I left.

Here's the deal...

I was certainly scared, I'm not going to pretend I wasn't.  I was, however, calm.  I kept my cool and as a result was able to assess the situation for myself and my family.  I had the appropriate tools to deal with the situation should it have come my friend's or family's way.

This is why it is so important that we be allowed to keep and bear arms.  The world is dangerous and getting more so every day.  The police were no help.  I was the last line of defense.  I'm just glad it didn't come to it.


**EDIT**

[Here is the park](http://goo.gl/maps/nnSCR).  Shooting happened along the north side of the parking lot.  It started at the northwest corner of the soccer field and moved to the parking lot.  We were at the smaller pavilion.

BUT, if you remove suicide from the stats, that number drops drastically!	bcrabbers	141	25	78	"Gun control lobbyist worldwide seem to love using the USA as the perfect excuse for the need for tighter gun laws. According to the stats, the US ranks around 11th in the world for the most firearm-related deaths (or, even better, the highest among developed nations) with a whopping 10.3 deaths per 100,000. Start putting those numbers out there, and you can imagine what people will say. But something about those stats didn't seem right to me, so I did a little digging...

It turns out that, while those stats are true, they don't tell the whole story. The term ""firearm-related deaths"" sounds very dramatic and, when included in an article describing the violence, hatred and murder that todays media is obsessed with, it's easy to connect that term with malicious intent. However, that would not be entirely accurate. The term ""firearm-related death"" means exactly that. It is any death that is related in any way to the use of a firearm and, in addition to homicide, also includes accidental death and suicide.

What difference does that make, I hear you ask? A very big difference! You see, the stats on all US firearm-related deaths is around 10.3 per 100k BUT, if you remove the number of suicides &amp; unintentionals from that figure, it drops to 2.98 (in '09). 

Here is why that matters. Gun control advocates say that tighter laws will make it harder for a bad guy to shoot a good guy, claiming such high numbers as 10 deaths in 100k as the main reason and making the assumption that that number will disappear. But the ugly truth is this: more people kill themselves with a gun than are actually killed by others. (5.75 in '05). Making that distinction is important because it's a reflection on intent. Suicide, while horrible, is not as drastic as murder (except in murder/suicide cases, of course). Homicide shows an intensely malicious intent towards another human, one that suicide does not typically reflect. This is why making the distinction between those two figures is important when using those stats in a case for gun control. 

By all this I am not suggesting that there is not a problem nor that 2.98 is a number to brag about (far from it!). I am also not in any way making light of the number of suicides in this country. What I am saying is that if we actually want to put the brakes on violence and the needless loss of human life in our society, we need to get our facts straight and stop fighting a war with the wrong intel. 

About two weeks before the Aurora theatre shooting, I read of a man that was stabbed outside of a train station in Australia. Australia is known for its tight gun laws and, having lived there myself AND obtained a firearms licence, I can attest to it's strict stance on gun control, but all the gun laws in the world would not have stopped that young man from getting stabbed.

As it's been said, gun laws only affect the people who actually keep the law. Murderers, rapists, thieves...we have a name from them: lawbreakers. In my opinion, if there is a problem, it is not on a legal level but societal. 



Disclaimer: 
Bear in mind, these numbers are only on firearm-related deaths, not deaths occurring by other means.

1355758465.0	14zvpu	Taking the emotion out of the gun control debate. [Wall of Text]	candre23	152	39	78	"Like a lot of things, gun control is a very polarizing issue.  Most people are either *really* in favor of limiting/removing access to firearms, or *really* against it.  These strong feelings cloud the real issues.  We should not even be asking if we *should* ban guns, because everybody already has a strong opinion on that question and there's not really much room for a debate.  The question we need to ask - the question that makes the hot-button question irrelevant - is ""*can* we ban guns?""

And the answer, in the United States, is no.

I don't mean legally or morally, I mean that *logistically* we cannot possibly ban guns in any effective way.  It is simply impossible to disarm America at this point in time or at any point in the foreseeable future.  Any attempt to do so will, at best, be a major inconvenience to law-abiding citizens.  At worst, it will cause more violence and death than all the mass shooting attacks in recorded history.  What it *won't* do is make anybody any safer.  The gun genie is out of the bottle in the US, and there is no legislating around that fact.

There are, at best guess, about a *quarter of a billion* guns in the USA.  That's nearly one gun per person.  Just about half of all adult Americans own at least one firearm.  Almost none of these weapons are ""registered"" in any meaningful way.  Even if the government threw the constitution and tradition to the wind (wouldn't be the first time) and enacted severe UK-style gun restrictions, there would be no way to find and recover those couple-hundred-million newly illegal firearms.

Oh sure, you could ask people to hand them in.  You could even pay them to do so or threaten prison if they didn't.  But how many guns would that actually remove from circulation?  90% is probably a high estimate, but that still leaves tens of millions of guns out there.  There are more than a few people who have gun collections worth many thousands of dollars.  Do you think they're going to just give up their investment?  What about the sizable percentage of gun owners who deeply believe that gun ownership is their *right*, regardless of what ""the man"" says?  There are states that are seriously considering seceding from the union over *health care* - what do you expect to happen when the government that they already distrust tries to forcibly disarm them?

Even if by some miracle you managed to remove 99% of all civilian-owned guns in the US without violence, then what?  That still leaves *several million* guns out there.  Guns which are, by definition, exclusively in the hands of people with no regard for the law.  All the people who would be most likely to use a gun to commit a crime *will still have their guns*.  Nearly all of those people aren't allowed to possess firearms now, what do you think will change then?  At best, crime will remain constant.  An argument could probably be made that it might even go up.

OK, so obviously total disarmament is not feasible.  What about assault weapon bans?  We had one before, and though many grumbled, nobody started a civil war over it.

Well, the fact is that it didn't actually *do* anything for gun crime rates.  Several studies showed no detectable change in crime trends thanks to the AWB.  Gun crime was already on the decline when the ban went into effect.  It continued to decline *at the same rate* during the ban, and maintained the same trajectory after the ban was lifted ten years later.  It created a hell of a hassle for gun owners, threw more than a few otherwise-law-abiding people in jail for technical infractions, and drove the cost of pre-ban guns and parts through the roof, but it didn't make anybody any safer.  There is nobody alive today who wouldn't have been if the ban had not been in place for a decade.

So maybe this time it's a little stricter?  Maybe no grandfathering in pre-ban guns and parts?

That just pushes you closer to the first option of violent resistance.  As I initially stated, any gun control measure in the US will, *at best*, do nothing.  There is no gun-crime reduction to be had that wouldn't come at the cost of massively larger anti-control violence.  There are too many guns in circulation, and too pervasive a gun culture in much of the country.  From a purely logical, rational standpoint, gun control as it is being pushed now is a *really* bad idea that cannot possibly benefit society.

So the next time you engage someone on the other side in a debate (probably in the next five minutes, the way things are at the moment), try to refrain from emotional arguments and stick to facts and logic.  Yes, it is truly horrible what happened in CT last week and it probably wouldn't have been nearly as bad if he didn't have guns.  Yes, you like guns and you feel you are entitled to own them.  Yes, the other guy is always wrong.  But none of that matters.  **It is not possible to disarm American civilians.**  You can make guns every bit as illegal as drugs, and they'll remain just as accessible as drugs (to criminals, at least) for exactly the same reasons.  We don't even need to debate whether or not we *should*, because no matter what, we *can't*.  

Instead, as we should be doing with drugs, we should be focusing on harm mitigation.  We cannot take guns away from everybody who might snap, but we can sure as hell reduce the chance that they might snap in the first place.  Health care in general and mental health care in particular is woefully underfunded and borderline inaccessible for much of the population.  You want to prevent atrocities?  Then help people before they get to the point where they feel that committing an atrocity is their only option.  *That* is something we *can* do."	t5_2ryez	True

My reasons for this decision are many, and it was not easy for me to click the button. I have been ruminating on this for weeks. This morning I woke up to an NPR show that was discussing the Arab reaction to the ""Innocence of Muslims"" video. The overall consensus was that free speech only works when people act in a civilized and responsible manor. That hit home.

I have chosen to ban the user in question because the actions that user was the exact opposite of civility, and because the user contributed nothing but spamming blank posts across the subreddit. Keep in mind that this was not arbitrary censorship or an easy decision for me. 

It was difficult because my actions were the actions of a hypocrite and it went against some of my principles. I have received multiple messages and hundreds of reports over this user's actions and used this as a justification for the ban. 

What do you think of this? Should I continue this policy of banning spammers? What set of criteria should I follow to make decisions like this in the future?

1359175463.0	17au6z	Feinstein's AWB is a smokescreen, and we're still at risk.  Here's why.	SergeantTibbs	130	22	21	"The thoughts contained below are mine.  I don't believe we're out of the woods by a long shot, just because Feinstein's bill looks like it'll die an inglorious death.  I actually think it's a clever distraction.  Here's why:

1.  The chances of Feinstein's bill making it out of committee is slim to none. It's too politically toxic, and even if it did pass there's every reason to believe a Supreme Court sympathetic to gun owners would smack it down as being unconstitutional on DC vs. Heller grounds (it's in common use).

2. Feinstein's bill is sucking all the air out of the debate by being the big bad scary thing we have to defeat. It's worth noting some smaller bills focusing on magazine restrictions, ending online ammo sales, and universal background checks, were proposed earlier or basically at the same time as Feinstein's bill. 

3. Democrats in insecure seats could get crushed in 2014-16 on gun legislation, like what happened in '94.  Reid doesn't want to risk that by letting AWB type laws out of committee. 

4. When Feinstein's bill tanks, it will distract people long enough to get the smaller bills out of committee in the shadow of the wreckage.  These could be passed as ""reasonable compromise"" in the dead of night on a Friday just before a big holiday weekend. 

Joe Biden gave the game away when he acknowledged that ""assault weapons"" aren't responsible for the majority of gun crime.  If this whole thing was really about banning modern sporting rifles, that's where the pressure likely would be, but it's not.  They *know* the AWB will die, and Reid might not even let it get that far.

Here's the worst part: the smaller bills aren't enough to warrant tossing out Republicans in secure seats in favor of more gun-friendly candidates, and their votes can be glossed over by repeating that they helped kill Feinstein's bill. Democrats in insecure seats didn't do enough to damage gun rights to make Democrats in gun-friendly states primary their own candidates, thus risking Republican takeover. 

So since Republicans won't throw out *mostly* gun friendly but duplicitous Republican senators, and Democrats are too at-risk of losing the slim Senate majority to primary their own candidates on something like the gun issue, it doesn't matter if Feinstein's bill goes down in flames. It's just a distraction for the other smaller bills they're actually going for.  

Republicans get to say they killed the big bad AWB, and Democrats get the compromise legislation without causing a big enough stink to get tossed out. Hell, even the NRA gets a bone. They killed the AWB, took down Feinstein, and secured memberships and donations for years.  They even get more nasty DemocRat strawmen to fight for another decade and raise money to defeat (ineffectually I might add, the NRA-supported candidates got *hosed*).

Everybody wins, except for gun rights supporters.

And hey, if the laws get torn down by the SCOTUS, well then fine. But if one conservative justice takes a dirt nap or retires, it'll be liberals in the majority and gun-rights legislation won't reach the court for years. The small bills could last for quite a long time... at least long enough for another exploitable tragedy. "	t5_2ryez	True

Turns out there was a big interest in it. I've been taking groups of 3 shooters out. Today was the second group. 

I required them to memorize the 4 rules of gun safety, and watch a couple of Hickock45 videos. They came prepared, but as soon as people arrived we went over all of the rules and I explained each one as best as I could.

We had a lot of guns to shoot. SW Model 34 in .22LR, SW Model 41 in .22LR, Ruger 10/22, Ruger Security Six, Glock 19, Beretta M92FS, Mosin Nagant 91/30 ('28 Tula),  Stevens side by side 20ga. Glenfield 25 and an M+M M10.

I had all the .22LR that we could shoot (I have an ammo can that's 1/4 filled with it), but I gave out everything else. It's a bit of an expense with how hard it is to get ammo these days, but I figure it's worth it. 

Despite the shitty weather and frozen feet, it was a great success. Everyone got to shoot every gun at least once, and I could tell a few people really took a liking to the Model 41 target pistol. 

I did it in conjunction with a friend of mine and redditor who I won't name. He did an excellent job at sharing his guns and ammo, but also was pivotal in explaining how some of the proposed gun control would ban a lot of the stuff we shot today. This is especially true in my home state, where we are staring down a 7-round magazine ban like NY passed. 

I think that introducing new people to the sport is just as important as calling our reps. A lot of people simply don't have any friends or family that shoot. They have no exposure to our hobby and lifestyle. They hear these ""common sense"" proposals and wonder why ""gun nuts"" are being so offended by it. These people get bombarded by the media, and it's not that they are incapable of thinking rationally, they just only hear one side of the story.

One of the guys that came said that he's been shooting with his friends before at a farm and was just blown away at how safety conscious we were being compared to the other time he went. It's all stuff that you and I take for granted. Things that are essentially muscle memory to us-- like sticking your index finger on the frame, and strict adherence to the four rules.

Since that day he has been deathly afraid of any and all firearms and has openly hated on me for owning  my guns. Well..last week he asked me what I wanted for my 23rd birthday..I said all I want is for you to let me take you shooting..after a heated debate he agreed. That afternoon I taught him everything i know about gun safety. We spent an hour or more simply going over how to be safe. He shot my AR, my AK, my Beretta 92 fs, my mossberg 500, my marlin 30/30, my little derringer, two of my .38 specials and a .22 long rifle. At the end of the day he admitted to me that he was wrong about guns at least in my case and those who are responsible with them.. And that he had thoroughly enjoyed himself. I Signed over ownership of the .22 that night to him as long as he promised to follow all the rules I taught him without exception. He's fired over 500 rounds out of it since that night! XD

He wanted to know if I would offer my support of Mr. Franken in his bid for reelection in the Senate. I explained that I cannot offer my support at this time since I do not know Mr. Franken's stance on several issues I've contacted him about via email, and via telephone and have yet to receive a response of any kind. The gentlemen offered to discuss Mr. Franken's viewpoints on various issues which I happily obliged. On the topic of gun control, Mr. Franken:

* First and foremost, ""supports the 2nd amendment rights of all Americans""... read on...
* Believes in sporting and hunting... (rolling my eyes...)
* Supports banning 'assault weapons'
* Supports banning 'high capacity clips'
* Supports 'closing the gun show loophole'

In short, he either has no balls whatsoever to stand up to his aligned party, or he really is an idiotic schmuck of the highest kind. I maintained my cool, and politely discussed why Mr. Franken's position I felt was gravely incorrect. We had a very fact-based, emotionless conversation, including discussion of the real intent of the 2nd amendment. In the end, we simply agreed that my ideals and Al's were ""incompatible"". In the politest and most respectful way possible, I did also let the caller know that not only would I not support Mr. Franken, now that I know his position on this critical issue, I would do everything in my power to ensure he is *not* reelected, and any challenger will have my full support of time/money/energy. He seemed to understand my sentiment, and we thanked each other for the conversation.

I do not think anyone has actually attempted to provide a history of small-arms development, and there is a widely held assumption that civilian and military small arms have historically been developed somewhat independent of eachother; at least that seems to be the implied belief when a person says ""Those were only made for killing people.""

There are a few points I would like to make to hopefully educate some of those that are unfamiliar with small-arms history. 

* **An overview and timeline of how modern firearms have developed.**


* **The United States has a history of modern firearms readily available to civilians.**


 **Overview of Small-arms Development since 1770**

**1775-ish**
The Continental Army was armed with a hodge-podge of rifles and muskets in 1775. The difference between the two was that a musket consisted of a tube (barrel) that took a loosely fitting ball and fired it innaccurately, but good enough to hit a formation of men at close range; A rifle had a barrel that took a tightly fitting ball, and there were grooves cut into the barrel to make the ball spin (rifling, where the term 'rifle' comes from). The rifle was more accurate than the musket, and allowed rifleman to target individual soldiers or officers with a reasonable degree of sucess; However, it was faster to load and fire a smoothbore musket, and could be fired for a longer period of time in a prolonged battle. (Blackpowder leaves a residue in the barrel that would build up in rifles/muskets, and make it difficult to stuff the ball down the barrel.) Basically, a rifle was more useful at longer distances, and in short engagements; but if you were going to stick around and duke it out, you would have probably been better off with a musket.

**Civil War**
Let's fast-forward to the American Civil War. There are a few things we need to cover. The [Minie Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minie_Ball), the [percussion cap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_Cap), [metal cartridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)), [repeating rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_repeating_rifle), and [revolving pistols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver).

The Minie Ball was a football shaped projectile that worked very well in rifles, and dramatically increased the range and accuracy of rifle fire. The percussion cap allowed firearms to be fired more quickly, more accurately, and in any weather. Percusion caps provided much more instaneous ignition of the black-powder, and did away with the very large flash-fire that was near a persons eye when they were firing. Accurate rifle fire was now posible out to 1000 yards, and ""sharpshooting"" began to take much more notoriety during the Civil War.

Metal cartidges allowed firearms to be loaded even quicker than muzzle-loading rifles, and they were also more reliable, and safer. In the heat of combat, it was not uncommon for a solider to forget to remove the old percussion cap on the nipple of his rifle, and put a new one on; as a result, a soldier would put new powder and bullet on top of the old one, and if they did this a few times, and then remembered to put a cap on, it could blow the rifle up! Metal cartridges and single-shot rifles simplified the loading process to simply putting a cartridge in, cocking the hammer, and pulling the trigger. Another advantage that metal cartidge cases provides was allowing the soldier to load and fire from a prone (laying down) position instead of kneeling or standing to load the rifle; it may not seem like much, but a soldier that is lying down is a much harder target to hit than one that is standing up.

Repeating rifles like the Spencer rifle (the one in the link) allowed soldiers to fire more shots before having to reload, and further increased the firepower at the disposal of a solider. The same can be said for revolvers. A group of Calvary soldiers with repeating rifles, and revolvers would have been a true force multiplier; A spencer carbine allowed soldiers to shoot 7 shots, and a revolver would have given him another 6 (or 12 if he had two), as well as a saber that was effective at close range or off horseback. With this kind of firepower at their disposal, a calvary unit could flank, and quickly subdue a much larger fighting force armed with muzzle loading rifles.

Following the Civil War, single-shot and repeating rifles took divergent paths; single-shot rifles were designed for fire larger bullets with more blackpowder behind them to be effective at longer ranges, while repeating rifles focused on smaller bullets and less powder so that more could be fitted into the magazine. Just like difference between rifles and muskets in the Revolutionary War, the utility of each was dependent upon the situation; one of the many reasons that Custer was over-run at the Battle of the Little Big Horn was because the Sioux had some lever-action repeating rifles, and were able to close the distance between them and the 7th Calvary, and exploit their close range firepower.

**World War I**
The time between the Civil War and World War I saw more improvements in firearms; the development of [smokeless powder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder) that could drive bullets faster than blackpowder, the [spitzer (pointy) bullet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_bullet), [machine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun), [automatic rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_rifle), and [submachine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun)

Smokless powder greatly reduced the smoke signature that a soldier produced when firing his rifle; it also pushed bullets a lot faster than blackpowder in a smaller package, and when coupled with pointed bullets, and a greater understanding of trajectories, allowed rifles to be even more effective at longer ranges.

Bolt-action repeating rifles like the [Gewhr 98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_98#M_98_controlled-feed_bolt-action_system) that could fire the new cartridges that were much more effective at longer-ranges, and stipper clips/chargers allowed bolt-action rifles to be reloaded much quicker than the previous generation of lever-action repeating rifles.

Machine guns like the [Maxim gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun) that fired the newer cartridges made it much easier for entrenched armies to hold ground against infantry and calvary charges; when coupled with a knowledge of trajectories (the arc the bullet flies), it was a very good terrain denial weapon. 

Much of the focus during World War I was trying to find ways to overcome the stalemate that machine guns, bolt-action rifles, and artillery created. Armored cars and tanks were a direct result of World War I. As far as firearms were concerned, efforts were focused on developing weapons that allowed infantry to gain ground again;  light machine guns, automatic rifles, and submachine guns, guns were developed in an effort to allow infantry to gain and hold ground again. 

Light machine guns were simply designed to be mobile machine guns, and were easier to carry when assaulting a trench-line, and could be quickly deployed and operated by two people.

Automatic rifles were typically fed by a detachable magazine, and could be operated by one soldier. The initial doctrine (developed by the French) was walking fire, where there would be a line of automatic rifleman that would advance across no-mans land with an Automatic rifle strapped to the hip, and fire a shot every time the left foot struck the ground, and create a wall of lead that would kill the germans...needless to say, it was not a very good idea. As a result, the automatic rifles were used much in the same way a light-machine gun would be; to bring an increased amount of firepower against the enemy, and allow rifleman to advance.

Submachine guns fired a pistol cartridge out of a detachable magazine, and were so that soliders would have a lot of close range firepower to overwhelm an enemies trench and take it over in a short period of time.

It would not be until World War II that they would their worth when coupled with tanks, trucks, and airpower that long lines of fortifications would be overcame.

**World War II**

World War II was fought with much of the same technology as the First World War, except mechanization could overcome trench-lines. Airplanes, artillery, and tanks could be massed at a single point, and then punch through a defensive line, surround it, and cut off it's supplies.

Most of Europe went to war with the same bolt-action rifles it had carried in World War I, but also saw the much wide issue of submachine guns, light machine guns, and automatic rifles. Infantry tactics were focused on how to strike a balance between short-range firepower and long range accuracy, as well as having the foot soliders be able to keep up with and support the tanks.

The United States entered World War II with the [M1 Garand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand) which was a semi-automatic rifle that increased the firepower of the infantry rifleman without having to sacrifice the range or accuracy of a bolt-action rifle. Towards the end of the War, Germany and the Soviet Union also began to issue semi-automatic rifles.

The most notable firearms advance came in the form of the Assault Rifle. The idea behind the Assault Rifle was to combine all of the best aspects of a submachine gun, and an automatic rifle, and a semi-automatic rifle into one, and develop a weapon that was more suitable for fast-paced warfare. The German [FG42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG42) was an early attempt at an Assault rifle, but was not much more useful than a semi-automatic rifle because it used a full-power rifle cartridge which has too much recoil to be effective in a lightweight rifle. 

The next attempt at an assault rifle (and where the namesake comes from) was the Stg.44; the Stg.44 has all of the hallmarks of what makes an assault rifle an assault rifle; it was select fire, and fired an intermediate cartridge. In order to make it somewhat useful in full-auto, it fired a unique cartridge that was a dramtically shortend rifle cartridge. It was select fire, so it could be fired semi-automatic (one shot at a time) or full-auto (bunches of shots per trigger pull). Basically, the Assault Rifle sacrificed the extreme-range of the full powered rifle cartridge for some of the short range utility of the submachine gun; it was intended to be a much more useful weapon in a mobile war where accurate long range rifle fire was not as useful.

**Vietnam**

The United States fought the Korean War was fought with the same firearms that were used in World War II; it would not be until Vietnam that the United States would have a real Assault Rifle.

Following World War II, the United States was left with a lot of different weapons that filled a niche role, and wanted a rifle that could replace many different weapons. The M14 rifle that the United States adopted in 1959 had the exact same pitfalls as the German FG42; it tried to do too many things at once. The Army did not want to sacrifice the long range firepower of a full sized rifle, but also wanted something in a rifle-sized package that could be used as an automatic rifle, rifle, and submachine gun. The full powered rifle cartridge made it uncontrollable in full-automatic fire, and as a result, it was really only an adequate replacement for the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle.

The [M16 rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle) is the only true assault rifle adopted by the United States, and has been the standard arm for over 40 years in one form or another. The M16 was fired a smaller/lighter cartridge from a 20-round box magazine, and was select-fire. The M16 also incorporate the use of aluminum and plastic into the rifle and was signficantly lighter than previous rifles. It fills the same gap that all assault rifles are supposed to fill; it is intended to be a flexible weapon for fast moving mechanized warfare.

Except for some major snafus (the rifle was hastily adopted, and did not work well), it was well suited for Vietnam and close range jungle warfare. 

**Vietnam-Now**

Following Korean War, there was an effort to replace all of the niche weapons with with a common rifle that could do a little bit of everything, since it is easier to train and maintain just one rifle system instead of four. In our two latest wars, there has been a reversal of that trend on some levels; the intermediate cartridge that the M16 fires is not very useful for long range engagements. In the mountains of Afghanistan, this has became fairly apparent, and rifles have been issued to fill the long-range engagement niche. Even the discarded M14 rifles saw a comeback as a Designated Marksman rifle.

The main advancement in the infantry soldiers area has came in the form of rugged telescopic sights, and night vision observation devices; the rifles remain much the same as they were in the Vietnam war.

1359652830.0	17mzfw	The demand for a National CC Permit has been drowned in the rhetorical tumult, but it should continue to be heard.	daeedorian	110	14	36	"We've heard the dozens of inane new policies suggested by people who know less than nothing about firearms--most of which are thinly veiled attempts to gradually subvert 2A until its social utility has been completely sabotaged.

Here's the new legislation that I would like to see presented:

* A National CCW permit with adequate funding for purpose-built training standards, course materials, and basic qualification testing.

* A fixed price for receiving the training.

* Strict confidentiality standards surrounding the permit database, which make it a crime to publish any records therein.

* Opt-in at a state level. Restrictive states can choose not to take part in the program, if voters in those states reject it. Similarly, states with Constitutional Carry would have no need for a standardized permit.

* Total reciprocity for all states that opt-in.

I believe in the full wording of the Second Amendment. I believe that the framers envisioned a nation of trained and armed civilians, who would be outfitted and prepared to defend themselves as necessary.

""Well regulated,"" in the terminology of the era meant ""well-trained"". Possessing a firearm is vital to individual security, but knowing how to use it is a close second in terms of importance.

If the goal of new firearm policies is indeed to improve public safety, the creation of a standardized and nationally recognized training curriculum has the potential to have a real positive effect.

American civilian gun owners are facing a PR predicament today. 

Why is the common urban voter who has no knowledge of guns generally comfortable with ""ex-military"" or ""retired cops"" being armed, even with formidable defensive equipment?

Because legitimacy comes along with training. Soldiers and police officers are known to receive formal firearms training. To the average layman, this increases their credibility and makes their possession of firearms seem more justified and less threatening.

All civilian shooters should be able to attain some measure of the same credibility. A National CC Permit has the potential to offer just that.

In other words, you can call it a National CC Permit, but the framers would've called it militia status.

Just wondering if others have had similar thoughts.

**Edit:** 

*The response to this post has been interesting to me. It's obvious that a majority of 2A supporters are instantly adverse to anything involving gun rights and the Federal government. My perspective is that the Federal government is the source of most of the firearm restrictions that affect gun owners, so if our rights are going to be expanded, it's going to be through Federal changes.*

*What I'm discussing here isn't Federally ""enforced"" carry permits, nor the imposition of Federal law onto states that already have permit-free Constitutional Carry.*

*The flaw I perceive in the current system is simply that there is no set of standards for training and licensing among the majority of states that require proof of training in order to receive a CC permit.*

*My ideal scenario would simply be the creation of a training curriculum that could be recognized across state lines. Federal funding would be logical, since such a system would remove administrative burden from states, but it might be best administered by the private contract sector.*"	t5_2ryez	True

Do you and your representatives believe that the government is the only entity sanctioned to commit violence.  It is my belief that the 2nd amendment has established that individuals also carry that right and is at the heart of it's inclusion.

Why do police enjoy that privilege and no one else?  Is it the oath? Training?  Can citizens who take the oath and complete the training get that same power?

We (government) have decided that some of us get guns and are allowed to carry them and allowed to kill people.  We've even said they can kill people under circumstances not allowed by others.  We need to break down that argument to it's basic premise.

It's time to cut through all the fog and get politicians who sponsor gun restrictions to clearly state their position on an individuals right to self defense."	t5_2ryez	True

1356977800.0	15qeqg	Second Amendment Myths: a grammatically challenged and flawed draft enumeration of why our freedom to keep and bear arms is so important.		122	31	32	"myth 1: that the second amendment applies to state run military groups and not to an individual citizen

this myth has repeatedly been debunked but bears repeating. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th  and part of the 10th amendments all enumerate natural rights for individuals. 

Why then would the 2nd amendment alone be a right for the govt ? The SCOTUS agrees and has ruled that the right to bear arms is an individual right. 

James Madison who drafted the BoR wrote tens of dozens of times that the militia is the ""body of the people"" composed of able bodied persons owning personal weapons. 

The historic context and intent of the persons who wrote it are clearly protecting an individual right.


myth 2: that the second amendment protects hunters and other sporting uses but not military style weapons. 


the historic context of the second amendment has no basis in hunting or sporting uses. those uses are never mentioned whatsoever. 

the bill of rights is a political document and the 2nd amendment, when viewed in the context of the times, is clearly protecting the right of individuals to participate in foreign or domestic defense of the nation. 

Defense of the nation cannot be done with antiquated weaponry. a citizen was expected to have a modern rifle kept in good condition and ready to be called to arms. 

myth 3: that the government with its insane amount of military power could stomp the citizenry and therefore the 2nd amendment is outdated, irrelevant for our modern world. 

the members of our military, from lifelong career vets to national guard grunts is made up of your brothers, sisters, uncles, dads, friends and friends of friends. 

to think that a majority of these people would participate in the highly illegal act of attacking its own populace in any kind of real numbers is ludicrous. 

the American people are unlike any other people currently on this earth. our sense of national pride is only dwarfed by our sense of individual liberty and mistrust of government. 

There may be some military members who participate is slaughtering their fellow man, but 80+ million gun owners dwarfs any standing army on the planet. there is no one, especially internet armchair generals, who have any idea how any kind of scenario like this would play out. 

The flip side of this myth is the idea that, the government is so powerful that someone would consider it pointless to retain one of their core freedoms. 

the idea that, because the government is so powerful we should simply give up this most important freedom as it is useless. giving up is antithesis to our national character.

**this argument is an argument for LESS FEDERAL MILITARY, not less personal freedom.** 

Our founding fathers did not want us to have anything like the type of federal military power that we have today. it is an agent of citizen suppression in the wrong hands.


myth 4: that gun violence and mass killings are on the rise. 

the numbers simply don't support this assertion and in fact show a downward decline over the last few decades.


myth 5: that reducing the size of large magazines to only hold 10 will alter a killer's ability to kill a lot of people.


a magazine for any handgun or rifle can be changed in less than 2 seconds. the idea that slightly slowing down the amount of firepower that is coming out of a gun will create less destruction has no basis in science when it has been shown that repeatedly, killers have plenty of time to reload and continue. 

only an armed citizen or officer of the law responding to a criminal can effectively stop someone from continuing to kill. 

if magazines with a capacity over 10 or even affixed to a firearm is a limitation placed on law abiding citizens, the 500 million existing magazines will still be available and reduces the law abiding citizen's ability to respond to a criminal who has no such magazine restrictions. 

A criminal can simply modify a ten round magazine to hold 15, 20, or more if they choose, rendering the law impotent.


myth 6: that gun owners are rednecks, nutters and kooky.


millions upon millions of members of all political parties enjoy the personal freedom afforded to them by natural right and enumerated in the Constitution. 

it is estimated that over 40% of the people, and probably much higher due to distrust, own some type of firearm. 

Firearms are an American tradition that most nations on this earth do not have or have under extreme restrictions limiting them to sporting uses only, which is not compatible with our constitution.


Calling a 2nd amendment supporter a nutter is like saying people who participate in free speech should be labeled seditionists. 

It is frightening that practicing a protected natural right is criticized while maintaining blind faith in govt that has proven time and time again to overstep its powers is encouraged. 

If you don’t trust the govt to truly look out for your rights and interests as so many people in polls believe, then why would you surrender rights to that same govt ?


Why would you advocate that an untrustworthy govt be given the power to strip you of such an important freedom that
helps keep it in check ?

myth 7: that the government of the united states would never attack or send in military against its own people and therefore
the second amendment is pointless. that we are in some type of ""enlightened"" era where guns are not compatible with modern societies. 

Waco, Ruby Ridge, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria. 

Please go watch the news and realize that the federal govt has overstepped its powers so egregiously over the years that we now accept the Patriot Act, warrant-less wiretapping (supposedly only against foreigners) and  doors being kicked in on a regular basis as a fact of life. 

The  Govt of the United States of America has superseded and extended its powers way beyond the original mandate and while it may continue to be benevolent and working for the good of the people now, the 2nd amendment is there to keep this power in check. 

Without it, there is simply no recourse for the people AT ALL.

It's no wonder our opposition is having such an easy time steamrolling legislation over us, because if *we're* confused, then what do you expect the average non-firearm owner knows?

1.  An **assault rifle** is a firearm used by the military, and is capable of firing *more than one round per trigger pull*.  They are **automatic weapons**.  [These are M16s.](http://i.imgur.com/O3nI1.jpg)  [This is what makes them assault rifles.](http://i.imgur.com/EdOT5.jpg)  Assault rifles fire an **intermediate cartridge** and have a **detachable magazine**.  **Assault rifles** are regulated by the [National Firearms Act of 1934](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act) and the [Hughes Amendment of the Firearm Owners Protect Act of 1986](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act#Machine_Gun_Ban).  **Automatic weapons** must be registered with the BATFE, no more automatic weapons are allowed to be manufactured for civilian ownership, and no more automatic weapons can be registered with the BATFE.

2.  A **semi-automatic rifle** is a rifle that fires one cartridge per trigger pull.  Semi-autos are chambered in any multitude of rounds, from .22 LR to .50 BMG, or smaller, or larger.  This is the [Ruger Mini-14](http://i.imgur.com/CBHiI.jpg), a common semi-automatic rifle.  It accepts a detachable magazine, and fires an intermediate cartridge.

3.  An **assault weapon** is a *~~legally~~ politically defined term*, with varying definitions depending on the various laws that attempt to regulate them.  The most commonly cited source for the definition of an **assault weapon** is the [Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban)  The criteria that define an assault weapon are *mostly cosmetic* and do not affect *function* but enhance comfort.  **Assault weapons** are still **semi-automatic** rifles (and sometimes pistols) no different than the Ruger Mini-14 pictured above."	t5_2ryez	True

1341929522.0	wbtb4	Stop settling for WASR-10's for your first AK. List of AK's by manufacturer and model for about the same price as a WASR-10.		103	18	49	"Too many people settle for a WASR-10. Are they good rifles? Yes. Do they have problems? Almost always. Can these problems be worked out? Usually. 
I'm not bashing WASR's. I had one myself once and I loved it. I put LOTS of rounds through it. But it did have canted sights, etc. So here's a list of AK's you can find that about the same price as WASR-10's that I believe are a step up in quality.

[M+M M10 Rifles](http://www.aimsurplus.com/eos/images/product//large_F1COM10762SF.jpg)
These rifles are made in Romania in the same place WASR-10's are. M+M outfits them with rail systems, houge grips, and some other goodies. They have a gas block/front sight combo so it can be described as a poor man's AK-104/105. You can find them for around $550-650

[Century Arms AKMS](http://cdn4.gunsforsale.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/5c6e3d4ad9ca995de50d6ebefb3bcec7/c/e/century_1662_akms.jpg)
These rifles are built on Polish underfolder kits and built on a NoDak spud receiver. I've handled tons of these rifles and you wouldn't believe it came from Century Arms. Receiver is 1.5mm thick and fit and finish is excellent. Non-chrome lined barrel for accuracy but I would avoid corrosive ammo. Great buy also. These can be had at about $600 sometimes less. These are drying up.

[I.O. Inc Polish Sporter](http://grabagun.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/265x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/I/O/IOPOLI0010_1.jpg.jpg) 
These rifles just started showing up from my distributors. We got one in and the fit and finish is good. Pretty standard AK stuff here, but better than a WASR by far. You can find these for $550-650.

[I.O. Inc Spoter](http://www.centermassfirearms.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/img_1762.jpg.jpg)
Claiming to be US made, these do have many US made parts but they do use unissued parts from overseas. Again, a standard AK. Polymer stocked guns can be had for under $600 and the wood stocked guns are a little more.

[Century Arms PAP M70](http://www.riflegear.com/images/Product/medium/1632.jpg)
These are heavy duty AK's built on RPK receivers. Slightly thicker barrel, advanced safety selector, and picatinny rail dust cover that LOCKS into the receiver. I've handled a few of these and the top mount seems very sturdy. I would mount a red dot on one but probably not a precision scope. These a very sturdy, but heavy, AK's. These rifles lack a rear tang so you cannot change your buttstock. You can get these for $650-750.

[ATI AT-47](http://www.maverick.thegunsource.com/DisplayPic.aspx?PIC=420374)
These are beautiful rifles with very, very nice wood on them that almost looks Russian or Bulgarian. ATI is new to the AK world so some are known to have small problems so if you find one, look it over real good. If it's okay, it's a great buy. They make these in two configurations, milled and stamped. The milled is complete garbage. It's held together with screws and it's a weird milled/stamped hybrid. The stamped version is your stand AK that is held with rivets. I own one of these and it's a great barrel. They claim that they are outfitted with a Shaw match grade barrel. The stamped version can be had for as little has $450 but sometimes go up to $600. The milled go from $600 and up.

There's more out there from small manufacturers and online retailers, but then the price goes out of the range of the WASR. 

So if you are looking for an AK and think the WASR 10 is the most affordable, there's many more choices out there. 
Thanks."	t5_2ryez	True

Thomas is the official source, GovTrack has a nicer design and API, and OpenCongress has tools to track bills, send letters to your congressmen and women, view news sites and blogs that have talked about the bills, and more.

1364158597.0	1axkx2	Attack on 2nd Amendment in Nevada	ThePoliticalHat	91	17	28	"An ""assault weapons"" ban has been introduced in Nevada by the loathsome Sen. Segerblom in the form of [SB396](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Reports/history.cfm?ID=925).  It would:

* Prohibits the purchase, sale or transfer of commonly owned semi-automatic firearms under the political misnomer ""assault weapons,"" and makes a violation of any of these provisions a felony.

*  Prohibits the purchase, possession, sale or transfer of ""large capacity magazines"" – meaning standard capacity magazines capable of holding ten or more rounds.

* Prohibits the purchase or possession of ""metal piercing bullets"" which is a clear attack on all ammunition.

* Criminalizes private transfers of firearms by requiring background checks on firearms transfers unless the person receiving the firearm has a Concealed Carry permit.

A companioin bill, [AB234](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Reports/history.cfm?DocumentType=1&amp;BillNo=234), by Assemblyman Horne would impost an excise tax on guns *and* bullets!

Legislators can be contacted [here](http://www.capwiz.com/nra/state/main/?state=nv&amp;view=myofficials), or alternately opinions can be given *directly* [here](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/Opinions/77th2013/A/).

On the flip side there are some very good bills to support:

* [SB226](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Reports/history.cfm?DocumentType=2&amp;BillNo=226) would eliminate local restrictions on gun owners, including gun registration schemes.

* [SB137](https://nelis.leg.state.nv.us/77th2013/App#/77th2013/Bill/Overview/SB137) would make Nevada a ""Constitutional Carry"" state.

* [SB223](https://nelis.leg.state.nv.us/77th2013/App#/77th2013/Bill/Overview/SB223) would allow employees at public colleges and K-12 schools who hold a valid CCW to carry on campus to protect their students.

* [AB340](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Reports/history.cfm?DocumentType=1&amp;BillNo=340) would also require uniform application of gun laws by eliminated local restrictions.

If there are any other subreddits this ought to be posted to, please do so or let me know.

For freedom.

Every story about Obama, Biden, and gun control was now about ""reducing gun violence"" and not ""gun control"".  It's amazing to see newspeak in action like this.  Has anyone else noticed that this change in wording happened suddenly?

We need to keep using the correct terms such as ""infringing on rights"" and ""reducing freedoms"".  Otherwise, the anti-gun crowd will keep using their term, and if you're against it, then you must want to *increase* gun violence.

I devised a secure way to attach it to the luggage rack on my motorcycle, and decided to take a little spin and see how it rides.

I stopped at the main parking lot of Garden of the Gods, and looked at the rocks for a bit, then hopped on the bike and rode to Balanced Rock, where I got off and took a cigarette break. I was OCing my P-95, and the AK was clearly visible. 

As I was standing by my bike, a cop car drove up real slow with a plainclothes guy on the passenger side looking intently out the window. When I saw him I smiled and waved, He smiled and waved back and drove on.

I built the crate from scratch, using cheap lumber and plywood from a home improvement store. The interior is lined with a black, rubber shelf liner. Two rods are positioned across the interior near the barrel and at the handgrip area; both are wrapped with pipe insulation. I used velcro straps to secure the weapons in place (one on the top rail and one on the bottom).

I may add straps to hold pistols against the sidewall in the empty space near the top.

1360510098.0	188ysx	The three big problems with gun owner insurance schemes	Oranguthang	89	18	30	"When the discussion gets heated, it's becoming more and more common to have someone throw out, ""Well, why don't we just have an insurance requirement for gun ownership?""  I've chewed on it for quite a while, and I think there is not one, not two, but three problems with the idea that should completely kill it.

1.  Logical.  People think it will work like car insurance, but it can't.  You have Uninsured Motorist coverage for when an uninsured driver hits your car.  The important part in that sentence is ""your car.""  If an uninsured driver hits you on the sidewalk, your auto insurance isn't going to pay anything.  For firearm insurance to work, all possible victims would have to carry insurance, not just firearm owners, i.e. every single person in the nation.  That can't work.

2.  Privacy.  Firearm insurance carries along with it an assumption of two things: universal registration and lifecycle management by the state, which would mean no private transfers and a lost-or-stolen reporting mandate.  While insurance might sound friendly, universal registration does not.

3.  Racism.  An insurance scheme carried out by the free market would be inherently regressive, and as such inherently racist.  Any actuary worth his salt would charge the highest rates to the poorest (most crime-ridden) areas.  If we can be candid about the intent of insurance, which is actually to chill gun ownership until such time as it becomes a thing of the past, then we can see that impoverished areas would ""lose"" their 2nd Amendment rights well before the wealthy areas.  In any large city in the nation that means that minorities would be affected first.  It would be funny, however, to see the ACLU lobbying for firearm insurance subsidies for the poor.  

I welcome any criticisms of my logic or additional analysis of the insurance idea."	t5_2ryez	True

Let me get to the most important point, this sub is not a circle jerk where we congratulate each other on buying glocks and mosins. This sub is the group of guys that is out there on the firing range who enjoy shooting for what it is. It is not the gunshop inhabited by a bunch of judgemental dicks who [know more than you](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/), instead this is the place where you can ask for suggestions and celebrate shooting as a form of relaxation or a way to burn spare time. It's a place where you can ask questions on any day besides ""moronic mondays"" and can enjoy your second amendment. 

If you are here because some dick mod said your subreddit was [crap](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/10vur2/expectations_and_clarifications/), don't expect that negativity to spread here. That being said, remember rule number 1: Don't be a dick.

The text is also below because I assume most people would prefer to just read it here. It seems a lot of people have been asking about it, so hopefully this helps. I appreciate feedback as well.

---

The amendment to expand background checks failed yesterday. It seems a lot of people are very upset with this, but why? I have two simple questions to ask, and then I'll give a summary.

**1. Do you know what the current laws are for background checks?**

**2. Do you know what the amendment to expand background checks says?**

I would imagine that most people cannot answer those two questions.

The biggest issue I see is that people don't know what the current laws are regarding background checks. The media is throwing around so much misinformation about it though, so I can't really blame them. Here are some of the main myths about current background checks.

* **You can buy a gun over the internet without a background check.**

Well you can... until you go to pick it up. You can go to a website selling guns, pick one out and click purchase. Then you have to do some steps that the media seems to leave out. You have to ship it to a store with  a Federal Firearms License (FFL). When it gets shipped there and you go to pick it up, they run a background check on you. If you fail the background check, you don't get the gun. You cannot ship a gun to your door.

There is an exception to this, and it's for people who have a [Curio &amp; Relic](http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/curios-relics.html) (C&amp;R) license. This is just a special kind of FFL, and it has limits. You have to do a lot of paperwork, pass background checks and pay money for forms. All of this grants a person the ability to have firearms, only those classified as C&amp;R firearms, shipped to their door. All of these firearms have to be at least 50 years old and classified as a C&amp;R firearm. These firearms do not include replicas.  Generally, these are not the type of people you have to worry about committing crimes.

* **You can walk into Walmart and buy a gun without a background check.**

This is just wrong. Any business that wants to sell firearms needs to have an FFL. Any company or person with an FFL who is selling a firearm to another person must go through a background check. There are two exemptions to this. In a state like Texas, a person with a Concealed Handgun License (CHL) does not need a background check. This is because they already passed the requirements to get that license, which are actually stricter than the background check itself. They still have to fill out a 4473 form when purchasing though. The other exemption is dealing with National Firearms Act (NFA) items. These are also dealt with more strictly than a simple background check.

* **The ""gun show loophole"" lets people buy guns without a background check.**

If we look above we can see that any business with an FFL has to do a background check when selling items. This includes being at a gun show. So what is this ""gun show loophole""? It's if you and I were to meet at a gun show and you wanted to buy a gun from me. I could sell you the gun without a background check. Why? Because it's a private sale between two citizens. This is only true if we are from the same state. I cannot go to an out-of- state gun show and sell another person a firearm. I would need to go through a dealer with an FFL and, you guessed it, that requires a background check. The same holds if someone came to my state looking to buy a gun from me; it would require that I ship it to a dealer with an FFL in the recipient's state. Once again, this requires a background check. So the ""gun show loophole"" isn't a loophole at all, it's just one citizen selling an item to another.

* **People are privately selling firearms to criminals.**

One person can sell any firearm that they own personally to any other person who they believe is not a felon. As stated above, this requires both people to be from the same state, and the sale must be in the state of residency. Anyone (including people selling from an FFL dealer), for any reason at all, can choose not to sell a firearm to any other person.

-   -   -   -   -   -   -

So then what would these expanded background checks cover? [This link](http://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=965) is to a summary of the bill.

* **Improves the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS).**

This is the current biggest downfall of the background check system. This does in fact need to be improved upon, and I agree with most of what it says. The problem is that they currently don't even have the resources to follow through with this system. Adding more criteria without actually following through on current prosecutions is useless.  About 1/10th of 1% of failed NICS  checks are [actually prosecuted](http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/10/opinion/avlon-obama-gun-control/index.html?hpt=hp_t2).

* **Require background checks for all firearm sales.**

This is a really good idea... in theory. If we look at the current laws, it shows that the only thing that this would attempt to improve is background checks on private sales. The problem is that it is literally impossible to enforce. Criminals are going to completely ignore this law and continue to sell without going through this system. This means it would only affect law abiding citizens, and cost them more money as well. These background checks are not free, and one of the biggest attractions of a private sale is that they are generally cheaper, due to it being a used item. Because of this, people would just completely ignore the law, and there would be no way to prove that they were. A law that cannot be enforced is not a good law. A law that only makes it harder on people obeying the law is not a good law.

The only way to hopefully enforce it properly is with a national registry, which the amendment said it would not do. Registration is a whole different can of worms. To give a very good and recent example of why this wouldn't work is [Canada](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2013/01/22/canada-tried-registering-long-guns-and-gave-up/). The cost was way more than they expected, and they just did not have the proper resources to follow through with it. The USA is already in debt, so the cost would definitely be too much for us. The current NICS system also does not have enough resources, so how would the USA have enough resources to run a registry?

I've heard people say ""this may not be the answer, but we have to do something"". That, in my opinion, is a terrible thought process and an even worse way to go about handling laws. If something will not work properly as a law, then it needs to be improved. Until then, forcing something through just to say ""we tried"" is only going to make things worse.

**In summary:**

- Can background checks be improved? Yes.

- Was this amendment the correct way to do that? No.

1348531281.0	10f5yu	Tips for hitting a target... any target... that helped me... and may help you...	Septimius	82	19	14	"The tips I listed below are ones that a LOT of the good people here in /r/firearms have contributed to one of my threads. I was able to apply some, not all, of these and needless to say, I improved from hitting the target twice outta 16 rounds to hitting target 19 outta 25 rounds!

Granted, my target was only from 15 feet, but the way I was shooting, I would be lucky if I hit the darn thing from 3 feet!

A lot of these tips are probably common knowledge to the more experienced of firearm owners, but to me, they were new and VERY helpful. A lot of these I just copied and pasted from their comments, hope that's ok...

Anyways, thanks again to all of you and, in no particular order, here is what I learned:

*  Dry Firing

*  If you're shooting a semi-automatic chamber a round, drop the magazine, fire the chambered round, then fire on an empty chamber and see where the gun goes (or hopefully doesn't). Re-insert the magazine and repeat. 

* Shoot at a blank piece of paper not a target. You brain will pick a point of aim for you. Once you're getting a group that'd fit inside the outline of a CD at 5 yards, go to 10, 15, 20 yards. Once you can shoot consistent groups you can worry about point of aim.

* Snap Caps

* Check your eye dominance also. I'm right handed but left eye dominant.

* a session or two with a professional firearms instructor.

* A helpful dry fire drill to reduce flinch and smooth out that trigger pull is to place a penny on top of your slide and dry fire until you can do it without the penny falling off. Once you can do that, stack 2 pennies on your slide... Then 3... Then 4... Etc.

* ...firearms class had me shooting at 3 feet to start. No joke. Pistol shooting stays exactly the same no matter what reasonable distance you are shooting. If you cant put 12/12 inside the circle at 3 feet then your errors will only be multiplied as you move out. I just put the target at 3 feet until I could put 12/12 in the inside circle twice in a row, and then kept moving it back until I got to about 20 feet. Then I started working on speed.

* learn how to breathe through mouth out through nose and pull the trigger steadily and slowly.

* Get a pair of cheap glasses, dark or clear lenses, doesn't matter. Cover the lenses with black tape, so that you can see NOTHING through them. Black tape is important. Then, on the lens that matches your dominate hand, poke a tiny, tiny, TINY hole in the black tape. Start small, eye of a needle small. You want to just barely be able to see the target when you put the glasses on. This may take some experimentation.

* Shooting is about consistency and repetition. I would recommend starting close to your target and ignore where the rounds are hitting the paper, just shoot the same every trigger pull. Once you start to see patterns emerge from doing that then you can start to adjust what you are doing. Often times people will miss, adjust, miss, adjust, miss, adjust, and they end up chasing themselves because they over adjust and it is a constant struggle. You have to really be aware of what you are doing to be able to fix it. Take it slow, don't be in a rush, and don't be afraid to start 10ft away with a giant piece of poster board.

* It's mostly about the stance, grip, and trigger pull. Don't be scared of the gun and be leaning back... lean forward into it a little. Learn proper grip for your revolver/semi-auto. learn how to pull the trigger with the tip of your finger.. and pull STRAIGHT back.

* Practice, Practice, and more Practice, and after that... even more Practice.

* Also if you have something with a rail you can mount a laser and this will help you see what your trigger pull is doing when dry firing.

With the other thread slowly making it's way down the pages, I just wanted to get all the good stuff from that thread into an easier to read AND print format... into a fresher thread. (hope I didn't break any rules!?)

We may have one of the highest costs of living up here but being a heavily rural state we understand the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

Coming up in our latest session:

* [HB24](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=HB24): Stregthens right for self defense to include ""any place the person has the right to be"".
* [HB69](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=HB69): ""..providing criminal penalties for federal officials who enforce or attempt to enforce a federal law, regulation, rule, or order regulating certain firearms and firearm accessories in this state"".  This one is powerful in scope and also stregthens the already passed [Firearms Freedom Act of 2010](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill_text.asp?hsid=HB0186D&amp;session=26) allowing for in-state creation of previously NFA banned firearms.  It received opposition from our legislative legal review in committee recently though.
* [HJR4](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=HJR4): Another symbolic bill sending a message to the US executive letting them know we don't support further infringement on our rights.
* [SJR6](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=SJR6): Same thing as above for our senate.
* [SB11](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=SB11) Allows for citizens over 18 to ""..Manufacture, sell, or transfer a switchblade.."".

Alaska's stance on firearms is already very strong and our current 90 day session shows some good progress in reaffirming our state constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  Our constitution was amended in 1994 to include: ""The individual right to keep and bear arms shall not be denied or infringed by the State or a political subdivision of the State."".  At least our legislative branch up here seems to ""get it"".

The last week of April I purchased a new Taurus PT-138 PRO from an online seller. A week or so later it was transferred to me by a local FFL holder. A few days after that I took it to the range (cleaned and oiled first) and experienced a number of failures to fire. Gun goes click, off center firing pin strike. I also experienced feed failures this first time out.

I put several hundred rounds through it hoping it would wear in and sort itself out, but I continued to have these problems. I paid to ship it to Taurus for repair. About five weeks later I got it back and it still does the same things. I am not pleased but hey, things happen.

I paid to ship it to Taurus a second time and managed to get through to someone there who identified himself to me as Christian, a supervisor. We spoke for a bit and I told him I was pretty disappointed to buy a faulty firearm and then get it back not repaired. He assured me that he would look into the matter and see that it got straightened out. This time I got it back in a bit over a week and took it to the range to try it out. Still has the same problems.

I'm pissed now so I call them back and at least they agree to pay the shipping to send it back for the third time. I am most specific in telling their customer service representatives that I do not want the same weapon back because it is defective and two repair attempts have failed. I want what I paid for...a new firearm with zero defects. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that I would get a call back. The call never came. I called back and reiterated that I want to speak to someone in management about replacing, not repairing, my defective product. I was agonizingly clear in stating that I would not accept return shipment of the same firearm again. I was assured once again that someone in management would call me back. Again, the call never came so I didn't know where we stood.

This morning FedEx came to my door with a package I was not expecting from, you guessed it, Miami. They sent the same faulty gun back to me a third time. I declined the delivery and called Taurus back to see what was going on. Once again I'm waiting for a call from management that I now know will never come. I am writing off the money that I paid for the gun as it will annoy me less to lose the money than it will to continue dealing with these idiots. Needless to say, I'm sorry that I bought one of their products and it will never happen again. Had I researched better I probably wouldn't have purchased this one, as this is by no means the first Taurus quality rant to appear on the internet. Just think...for another hundred bucks I could have had a Beretta. Lesson learned.

tldr: Don't buy a Taurus, they suck.

1357955074.0	16exmh	"The ""FIRE"" in a crowded theater argument"	pricecw	73	16	12	"Hey all,   
   
  Went to a town hall meeting with my Senator this last week, questions were open format, random ticket drawing, and I was pulled to ask the very first question in the room.  So I asked him about his stance on the proposals to violate American civil rights with the proposed bills, and then got to follow up once.  Responses from him did not give me good feelings, and it appears I will be searching for candidates in upcoming elections. 
    
Anyway, in response to my followup, he trotted out the old idea that rights can be infringed, just look at the 1st and yelling ""FIRE"" in a crowded theater.  I talked to a friend afterwords, that had never heard why I think that is BS, so I thought I would share.   
    
The government is not restricting free speech or the first amendment here.  If they wanted to do that (along the lines of gun control), they would muzzle everyone going into the theater to ensure that no one could stand up and yell ""FIRE"" no matter what.   
   
Instead, what the government has done is charge you for the damage you do.  If you were in a theater and yelled FIRE, and no one did anything, you would probably be escorted out, and maybe charged with attempting to incite panic.  If you got a panic to happen, someone was trampled to death, and there was no fire, you would be charged with manslaughter/murder.  Now, if there was a fire, you would be OK, and no charge.   
    
Basically, they are not removing your rights, but holding you responsible for your actions and the damage and harm you may cause.  To bring this back to firearms, the government should follow the same, if you shoot someone, you get charged, if not, you are OK.

&gt;You may have heard on the news about a southern California
man put under 72-hour psychiatric observation when it was
found he owned 100 guns and allegedly had (by rough
estimate) 1-million rounds of ammunition stored in his home.
The house also featured a secret escape tunnel.

&gt;My favorite quote from the dimwit television reporter: ""Wow!
He has about a million machine gun bullets."" The headline
referred to it as a ""massive weapons cache.""

&gt;By southern California standards someone even owning 100,000
rounds would be called ""mentally unstable."" Just imagine if
he lived elsewhere:

&gt;In Arizona, he'd be called ""an avid gun collector.""

&gt;In Arkansas, he'd be called ""a novice gun collector.""

&gt;In Utah, he'd be called ""moderately well prepared,"" but
they'd probably reserve judgment until they made sure that
he had a corresponding quantity of stored food.

&gt;In Montana, he'd be called ""The neighborhood 'Go-To' guy.""

&gt;In Idaho, he'd be called ""a likely gubernatorial candidate.""

&gt;In Wyoming, he'd be called ""an eligible bachelor.""

&gt;And, in Texas, he'd be called ""a deer hunting buddy."""	t5_2ryez	True

1362606440.0	19suxs	Response from CO State Senator Cheri Jahn [YOUR LETTERS ARE WORKING, KEEP UP THE PRESSURE!]	IblisSmokeandFlame	65	13	10	"Dear Friends,

Thanks to all of you for taking the time to write to me about an emotionally charged issue, and please allow me to also say an even bigger thank you to the many constituents who have attended my town hall meetings this year.  There are hundreds of bills that are coming through the legislative process this year and I am working hard to closely follow them all.  I wish I could respond to each of you personally, but I have been receiving literally thousands of emails and phone calls about the firearm bills we are hearing in the Senate this week, and I wanted to reach out to as many of my constituents as possible before I vote.  I will do my best to concisely address the concerns I have heard from you all, and I must say, I am truly thankful for the kind and respectful discourse we have been able to have.  

I think it is important for citizens to know how I look at every piece of legislation that comes before me regardless of the issue.  First of all, I always ask, what are we trying to fix?  Is it a problem that the state (and I emphasize state here) government can resolve?  Secondly, as you all know, the devil is in the details on any policy or legislation that is passed, so I look carefully to anticipate any unintended consequences.  It is my job to look deeply and thoroughly and to talk with experts on each issue.  I spend a lot of time researching and talking with people in my district.  Finally, I painstakingly look to see how the policy can be enforced.  If you can't enforce it, then we probably should not pass it.

I would like to share my thoughts and positions on the bills that I have looked at so far.  Please keep in mind that at the time of this writing I have yet to hear debate on these bills as they have not come to any of the committees I serve on.  First of all, the background fee bill, HB 13-1228; I currently support because I have been assured that the money collected will only be used to cover the cost of the background checks.  I believe in the 2nd Amendment but do not see charging a $10.00 fee unreasonable or as a violation of that Constitutional right. The state previously charged a fee through in the 1990s until the federal government started paying for the checks. When the cost was returned to the state, the fees were not reinstated and now the cost is being subsidized by taxpayers.  

HB13-1224, the magazine limitation bill, I cannot support.  Again, my previous concerns about the enforceability of the law weigh on me quite heavily.  There is no way to distinguish between who would own these magazines legally versus those who bought them illegally. I feel that this legislation would be punishing those citizens who bought them before the ban, or possibly inherited them, while at the same time allowing people to simply drive them across the border from another state.   I always look for unintended consequences and I think this bill is flawed.

HB 13-1229, requiring universal background checks, is a bill that I find reasonable.  I see nothing wrong with a person having to get a background check to obtain a firearm.  I will be listening closely in debate to be sure that there are sufficient provisions for selling to family members and for things like collectibles and antiques.  

HB 13-1226, the concealed carry on campus bill, is another one I cannot support.  I have not heard of one incident that had to do with a law abiding citizen committing a harmful act that had a concealed carry permit. These are, after all, adults that have gone through the legal processes to carry a firearm.  

SB 13-196 is the liability bill, and I am not supporting it.  I would liken it to holding a car dealership liable for someone driving drunk and getting in an accident, and then saying that the dealership did not use 'reasonable' care when selling them the car.  What constitutes reasonable care? I think this is very far reaching.

SB 13-195 is a actually just a cleanup bill that closes a loophole in the process to gain a concealed carry permit.  Years ago when we began the process to legalize concealed carry licenses, the language of the bill didn’t include a provision for internet classes (because there was no such thing at the time).  This bill simply requires that to earn a concealed carry permit, the applicant must attend the class in person, and cannot attend via the internet.  This bill is a common sense approach to make concealed carry permit holders accountable to the required safety training, and I will be voting in support of it.  

Again, I wanted to sincerely thank you for taking the time to contact my office. We have been inundated with thousands of calls and emails on both sides of the issues and I’m so pleased to have so many of my constituents making their voices heard.  I also hope that you will stay involved with the process on other issues as we continue to look at legislation in other areas of state government.  Feel free to contact me again anytime and we look forward to the great work we can do together.  

Sincerely,
Senator Cheri Jahn
