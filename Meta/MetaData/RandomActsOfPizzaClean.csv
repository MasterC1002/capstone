Throwing up a new post with some more organization to it since the other thread is so big and comments are being overlooked.

**if you use the code 'getgrub' when ordering on grubhub, it will give you $5 off your order!!**

**another edit to add State Police to this list.  I will find locations for them and add them in shortly. Thanks elle for pointing them out**

• MA State Police- Foxboro / 136 Washington St Foxboro, MA {{Papa Ginos is right down the street from them, their phone # is (508) 543-1516 or order online at papaginos.com}}

 • MA State Police - Boston/ 250 Leverett Circle Boston MA
Dominos is the only popping for their location.  Dominos 64 Staniford St Boston, MA 02114 
(617) 248-0100 

 • MA State Police- Weston/ 668 South Ave Weston, MA
Dominos location: 868 Worcester St Wellesley, MA (781) 235-6800 again only Dominos popping for their delivery area.


 • MA State Police- Revere/ 220 Revere Beach Blvd Revere, MA
Dominos location: 570 Broadway Revere, MA (781) 289-1020

The above is a list of departments that have been involved in the whole ordeal.  There is also FBI I will be adding to the list shortly.  The above lists the addresses of each department.  Along with their address is the nearest Dominos (easy online ordering; yes I know..it's a chain but still) In addition, there is another link under each department which links to Yelp pages showing other places that deliver to each department.


**Another option we have is going through [grubhub for online ordering](www.grubhub.com) see the list above, get the address for the department you'd like to help...pop it into grubhubs page and it will pop places that deliver to each location.  You are *not* limited to sending only pizza.  Any resturant you find in a yelp or grubhub search that delivers is welcomed.  You can pay online and also cover the delivery fee and a tip for the driver through online ordering as well.**


I am waiting to hear back from Boston PD for any funds set up for the fallen and/or injured officers.  This way if you are able and willing to do more than just food, you have that option and it will be legit.  


**There is also a [google document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmcPpxye8WDxdHBXLVcwS0g2N2VjVndENkhOZ183ckE&amp;usp=sharing) with a collection of hospitals and different branches involved in this whole thing.**  Please note, Watertown has been WELL TAKEN CARE OF NOW!  


Any questions or concerns, let me know.  Thank you all for your part in this.  I know it might not seem like much to some but, for those being sent grub...I know it is appreciated and is a nice change from the under appreciation they are often faced with.







**another update**

**Officer Sean Collier is the officer who lost his life.  His family has asked that donations be made in his name/honor to the [Jimmy Fund](http://www.jimmyfund.org/) article stating this can be found [here](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/obit-officer-sean-collier-0419.html)**

ANOTHER ADDITION:
USCG Station Boston launched and Air Station Cape Cod also sent a couple helos over there which are all coordinated by USCG Sector Boston. So, it's three seperate units. Just figured i'd mention it! :) I'll let you know if I think of anywhere else. The base has security guards that will call the station watchstanders usually and tell them. 


USCG Station Boston is at 427 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109, but you have to use (617)828-8953 as the phone number for Station for the notification.

1331095502.0	qla8g	FUCK PAPA JOHNS	dirty_chimp	107	10	22	"So I thought I'd be a swell guy and order someone pizza on Random Acts of Pizza via Papa Johns.  The person to receive pizza went to the store to pick up his - paid for - food, and was rejected because we were two different people.  They asked for payment in store (which wasn't going to happen since it was a RAOP!).  Needless to say, he left empty handed, and probably very embarrassed.  I called the store and once I spoke to the manager and cleared things up, he said the only issue now was that the receiver was out of his delivery area, and told me he'd transfer the order to the closer corresponding store. Also, I'd kindly like to point out that they have fine print saying that in the event of an issue, I will be called and an email will be sent if they were unable to reach me by phone; none of which I received.

 I followed up with the manager of the closer whom basically told me since I am in another state to kindly F-off since the credit card wont be present upon delivery.  I asked if I could send him proof such as a driver license and credit card picture; he responded that he didn't have a fax machine. Really?

Why can I order hundreds of dollars of merchandise through their website using my credit card and have it shipped to a completely different address and have the product left on a door step unsigned for, but I can't order a pizza to be picked up or delivered.

FUCK PAPA JOHNS. Boycotting them for good. Corporate complaints made already.

Edit: Dominoes made it happen. huray! Wish I knew how to xpost this shit. I am furious."	t5_2sle9	True
1346161636.0	yyle0	So, I got scammed by a Redditor on /r/RandomActsofPizza last night. (x-post)	herpderpster	106	12	27	"***[UPDATE]***: Redditor bfeliciano was kind enough to buy a pizza for the true victim of the scam, the guy who asked for pizza in the first place! As long as he got his pie, I'm happy, and the world is good again. :)

I like to read /r/RandomActsofPizza and /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza because they provide evidence that people still do good things for other people. It's fun to read the stories and see people's reactions to having their request for pizza met, even though it's a small thing. Just some people giving what they can to help their fellow man.




Anyway, last night I was reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/yvk0b/broke_till_the_1st_feel_like_shit_after_quitting/) thread, and gave props to the OP after he was heavily criticized for quitting smoking because of his girlfriend's pregnancy scare, and then continued to quit after it turned out to be negative. Later, I asked him to PM me about pizza.




Afterwards, I went off Reddit for a couple of hours and then remembered my message, so I went back on and found several messages from whom I thought was one person. It turns out, the messages were from two people. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/9WcJY.png) is my inbox, which shows the messages. I was suspicious, because 999rafica responded twice, and then I had another message saying that he just got my message to PM me. I figured, hey, he probably saw my comment on the thread and then my PM so he sent me multiple replies. Or maybe he was excited about pizza and wondered why I didn't respond for a couple of hours.




I ended up replying to the most-recent message, which was from ***999raffca***. The legitimate user's name is 999raff***i***ca, but I didn't notice the spelling difference until it was too late. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/user/999raffca) is the scammer's user profile. It was made right before he messaged me, proving that the account was made specifically to fool me. I guess I wasn't too concerned about getting scammed on a subreddit that's supposed to be about giving out of the random kindness of your heart.




Anyway, I don't know what Reddit wants me to do about this, but because the purchase (which was an e-gift certificate to Domino's) was made by me, I can't file it as fraud with my bank, and because the code was already used, Domino's isn't going to refund me.




I guess I just want everyone out there to know that people suck, regardless of what you think. Not everybody sucks--but enough people do that it's hard, and often unwise, to trust anyone."	t5_2sle9	True

1374555098.0	1iv641	[META] Just a reminder to all	menmybabies	65	6	18	"1. Your account must be at least a month old and active in order to make a request in this subreddit.

2. Givers if you find a request you want to assist, please PM the person to initiate conversation with them.  There are some people who lurk and will make a fake name to nab the OP pizza from them.  For example, my name is menmybabies someone might come along and make the name mennybabies to try to trick the giver.  


3. Please do not spam the sub!  Limit your request to twice per week.  No posting over and over again.


4. Either request or offer, judging a requestor is not acceptable.  If you're not feeling the request or think the story posted is bull, back click out.  We don't want anyone being put down when making a request.


5. We have this handy feature on all pages 'report' please use this to bring a post to the moderators attention.  Our mod queue is checked on a regular basis.


6. We will be making some changes to the sub to include a facelift of the sub, we will be implementing a flair for our givers and a flair for those who have been given pizza.


7. For those who are helped out by someone, please take the time to post a thank you thread.  It isn't about recognition for the giver, it helps inspire others to give too.


8. It is important to note we are not a need based community.  Requesting pizza isn't limited to those in need, without money and/or food.  Anyone whose account meets our guidelines is welcome to make a request.  Sob story is not required.  If you want some pizza, ask for it.  Don't lie or exaggerate your situation to increase your chances of being helped.  

9. Our mod team is here for you.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to scroll down on the right and send us a message.  


10. To those who have been given pizza, please pay it forward.  Though, it isn't a requirement it is certainly nice to see someone who has been helped out come back to help someone else out.  Let it go full circle.  That's what keeps our subreddit going.


11. Lastly, we are well aware of the scummy article put out by wired.  Please don't let them stop our community from being the amazing corner of reddit it is.  We've been removing posts which refer to the article, not because we don't care but because we don't want to increase their traffic and allow their article to breed negativity!  


Thank you all for being a part of our community.  We are what we are because of each of you and your contributions to this subreddit.  Let's show them no matter how hard they try to beat us down, they will not knock us down.

* Inbox me a story, a **FUNNY** story that will make me laugh.  I need the morale boost.  Funniest story gets a $50.00 gift card on me.  So make it a good one!

Your stories will be going to great use as I am in the desert...*yay*...

Any and all morale for me is great!  Also, less than 2 months until I leave!  Ahhhhh....gonna be great to be back in Germany!

* Winner will be chosen by Saturday morning @ 0000 hours.  And the winner will be announced on this thread.  Once you send me your story, post on here that you sent it.  Love you all!


EDIT: Alright everyone...I know it's a little late (duty calls) heh...duty...but OP is about to deliver.  After reading these stories, I thought to myself, wow...these redditors are really living comical lives.  And I thank every single one of you for sharing.  My morale is much higher than what it was.  Only 44 days left btw :). Anywho...for the OP deliverance (c'mere boy, you sure got a purrty mouth)....

The story I chose wasn't as lengthy as some of the submissions, but it was the easiest to put myself in the situation, and if I was in this situation I would've died laughing...might have even put the bum up for a night for making me laugh so hard.  Anywho, I'm sure he's already guessed it, but the winner is Black_Plazma!  Here's the winning story!

So I rode the light rail downtown this morning, and I am walking back to grab the train back home, and a smaller Asian dude is in front of me. I look up and there is a homeless man pants all the way down pooping by a bus stop. The Asian man and I both are now walking with our heads down trying not to look, and all of a sudden the Asian man sneezes as we are walking past this public pooper. The homeless man I shit you not looks at the other guy walking in front of me dead in the eye, and says ""Cover your mouth when you sneeze."" as he is shitting on the sidewalk. The complete irony of this situation was the best thing ever.

1348446410.0	10d86w	Not sure if this is allowed, but this is a thank you for a previous random act of pizza.	malprintemps	62	11	1	"Please let me know if I need to remove this and I will.

A little over a year ago, at the end of my sophomore year of college, my mom was checked into rehab for anorexia. She's a single mom who somehow managed to work and pay for my college at the same time, and with whom I'm extremely close. While she was checked in, she couldn't receive phone calls. At the same time, I ran out of money and, due to a mix up with my school, my meal plan ran out.

My friends did their best to give me their guest meals and take me out when they could afford it, but they were broke students too. One very dear friend took me to Walmart and paid for a month's supply of ramen and teriyaki sauce- all she could afford. She probably saved my life. But ramen doesn't really keep you going so well. My health and my grades spiraled and so did my mental state. My professors and my assistant dean did everything they could to help me, including giving me one hundred dollars from a fund created for students like me, but one hundred dollars only goes so far over a few months.

Finally, on my lowest night, a very dear friend of mine who lives more than ten hours away ordered me a pizza. An extra-large pizza with lots of toppings, so I would have left-overs. I had finally gotten the courage to tell someone how scared and hungry I was, and he reached out. After that, my luck changed. My dad was able to wire me some money (he's nearly as broke as I am) and I survived the rest of the semester.

I eventually dropped out and moved home to take care of my mom and work. I live paycheck-to-paycheck in a national volunteer service so that she doesn't have to support me. And today, out of nowhere, more than a year later, that same friend ordered me another pizza. People like him give me hope. I'm not at rock bottom, eating three packs of ramen a day and asking my friends to steal cereal from the dining hall. I have work and I'm learning a trade and I'm doing better.

Anyway. To all you pizza givers, thank you. You change lives. Your little contribution is not so little. And to all you pizza receivers, keep on truckin, and remember the pizza that got you through.

A sincere thank you to all who participated from alerting me to locations missed, to updating the spread sheet, to sending off orders of hot food.  We had members send cookies, pies, desserts, pizza, wings, subs, sandwich platters, fries, burgers, cheese burgers and more.


This has been amazing and wouldn't have been possible without each and every single one of you coming together and supporting Boston officials.  Many of the departments reached out personally to convey their thanks and appreciation.  This has been an amazing and humbling project to be a part of.


Often, Reddit gets called for the bad, the gore, the ugly.  Together, we helped make a beautiful thing occur.  Something Reddit can be proud of.  We had people from all over the states as well an international reaching out.  The outpouring of love and support was incredible.


Thank you to each and every single person involved with this.  We had several who remained silent and did their part, though you were silent you're not forgotten or looked past.  It is all appreciated.


It was both my honor and my pleasure to 'head up' this wonderful project.  My hope is that the officials know and feel the love and support from around the world.  They do a thankless job, thank you for showing them it was appreciated.


Please continue to keep them all in your thoughts as things move forward.  Funerals are under way for those who lost their lives.  Recovery is a long road ahead for countless victims.  I hope this sent a message saying ""united we stand, we have your back and support you Boston""  


I was interviewed by a Boston reporter today.  A story will be published regardling the awesomeness we all made happen.  Once I get the link, I will be sure to share it with you all.


Tonight, I am honored to be not only a moderator of this subreddit but, also damn honored to be amongst a group of amazing indlviduals such as yourselves.  Job well done /r/randomactsofpizza.  


In a dark time, we pulled together and made something wonderful and powerful come out of it.  In a time where a lot of loss in humanity was lost, this helped restore that faith and show, there is a ton of good out there.  Keep being fabulous my fellow raop'ers.  


Again, thank you to everyone involved in this sub and a great big thank you to all of the officers and offices involved in the whole ordeal.  The hard work, dedication, swiftness and professionalism was noticed and appreciated.

Yea, pizza is good and all, but the people who take the money as well as time to do this for another human being is just a way of showing helping another person in need. A few weeks ago I ordered my girlfriend a pizza. Not just for her, but for her whole family which includes her mother, father, and two sisters. She is in another state right now because of college and she had no money. Her parents were both working and she had been running around doing errands while watching her two younger sisters. We were talking for a little bit and I mentioned that we were having pizza that evening. She told me how I'm so lucky, that she wish she could join me, and that she was hungry, but didn't think she would be having dinner that night. So I offered to order her some, it wasn't the first time I offered to order her food, but before she had refused and I didn't push it. This time however, I wanted to really get her it, and not only for her but her sisters as well. They were in the background wanting to talk to me and have overheard that I mentioned I would buy pizza for them and were so ecstatic. This time when she said no she didn't want me wasting money on her I told her that I don't care, it's not wasting money, and that I would send her pizza anyways because I really wanted to. So I spent the next two hours online finding a pizza place around where she lived that would not only deliver pizza, but accept my card online or on the phone without having to go to the store and show them it. I finally succeeded and when she got home the pizza man came about 20 minutes after with their family pizza box. I order pizza and wings for her whole family and they were so happy and relived that they had food that night. She told me how thankful she was and I felt just really good that I could do that for someone I care about. For anyone for that matter in fact and really make their day. It was more satisfying than me having pizza. I hope that everyone who does a good deed here and provides that nice hot dinner to someone who really needs it, feels the same way I did. I'd just thought I'd share my gratitude to those who really helped someone out.	t5_2sle9	True

For those who haven't seen the movie it's a story of a little boy who starts a movement where people randomley help people in random ways. This Sub used to be that. Now it's people asking for shit. Not that it's completely deteriorated, and I'm not saying that asking for stuff is terrible-in fact keep it up! But this Sub started off with people helping people randomely, simply because someone was in need. If you come here, for any reason, whether it's to request, or tell of something you did please at least try to take the message away of HELPING PEOPLE!

Just wanted to remind you guys to please make sure you are sending pizza to the username that you originally interacted with.


We recently had a few cases where a third party would follow a pizza exchange about to take place and they quickly created a username very similar to the requester of pizza, in a pathetic attempt to trick the pizza sender into sending them the pizza instead. 


So please be vigilante and make sure you are sending the pizza to the indeed intended person, and report those that try to scam the good hearted people of this subreddit.


Don't let this discourage you from sending pizza to those who are truly in need of it, your good deeds are very much appreciated and needed. We just need to make sure to prevent the occasional scammer from getting through the cracks.

thank you, kind stranger, you made this girl cry of happiness!!

hello generous redditors,

my mom always told me that if you don't eat enough, you will get fat, because your body will go into starvation mode and store everything possible in case you skip more meals.

well, i need help today. i quit my job because i was being harassed, and though i luckily (thank god!) was able to find a new job, but it will be two full weeks before i am paid. i have cans of Manwich and a few cups of noodles, but a hot hot pizza would be freakin amaaazing today. also, one large pizza is like four meals for this girl, so you'd really be feeding me for an entire day! 

think of it as an investment in the future! i am studying pre-med and am planning on dedicating the rest of my life to telling people how bad pizza is for you! jk. i do want to help though, and once this two weeks is up, i'd like to buy you a pizza.

thanks for reading everybody,

NoKarmalNoCry	27	5	10	"I've been down before, and were it not for the compassion of good people--some of them strangers--I may have never recovered.  And I'm not a fan of breads and such, and I thought people like me who might want/need some healthier grub would appreciate not being relegated to pizza (though most WFs that I know of have pizza, if you'd still prefer that).  PM me with F/L name, physical addy, and email and I'll have a Gift Card sent first class via USPS (which may not arrive by the 25th, sorry for that).  There's an ""eGiftCard"" option as well, which would be useful for anyone with a printer or smartphone, so let me know which would be preferred.

Note:

* First 5 unique name/address combos PMed to me will each receive one $50 card.

* Whole Foods was chosen mostly for the health aspects, but also for the convenience (online, mailable GCs). I'm sorry for those who don't live near a store, but this is a pretty firm condition.  Let me know what might be similar nearby, and I'll see what I can do, but I can't make any promises.

* My brother is a professional con man, trust me when I say I've heard them all.  Preference will be given to those who aren't looking for loopholes or angles.  That said, I don't care about my own karma--neither the reddit, nor the Vedic variety.  So if your the type of depraved sociopath who would take this gift from someone who needs it, well... enjoy spending not insignificant psychic effort trying to drown out your conscience as it tells you just how shitty such a choice would be.  Still, I can't stop you from trying.

* I'll post updates to let everyone know about availability.

[Edit1]: 1 down, 4 to go - 7:47pm EST.

[Edit2]: 2 down, 3 to go - 8:35pm EST.

[Edit3]: 3 down, 2 to go, but I need to step out for a few hours.  Will check back and continue later tonight - 9:17pm EST.

[Edit4]: Sorry for the down time, everyone.  I sent a card or a message to everyone who PMed me while I was out.  I can fulfill those requests, but no more at this time.  Best wishes to everyone, and I hope your holidays are filled with love.  And for those of you who were sent my name in the email from Whole Foods, please keep that information private.

Steven did a charity drive a while back where he raised over $30,000 with a friend but as a result his paypal was frozen so he can't buy anything. Proof of that is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe2pI21GCic

I've spent a lot of my own money on both of us this weekend because of this fact, and I've been spending way too much. I was hoping someone out there could send us a pizza or two. 

Here is proof of us existing:

The contest is going to end on the 31st so get your comments in by then. 

I will choose the winner by writing down the usernames of the posters, put the name into a hat then choose! 

Hope to see a lot of participation. 

The only rules to this are 
-do not post comments more than once.
-reddit account must not be throw away. I need to see activity from the account first. Just so people can't make a double submission.


Edit: As I did not see this thread blowing up like this, instead of one give away. I am going to do a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.

1st place- one large pizza of your choosing
2nd place- one medium one topping pizza
3rd place- order of breadsticks

Hope everyone who previously commented sees this update so they will know the new changes! 
Thanks everyone! Someday I hope someone will run their own contest so I may win!

Edit 2: I know I said the contest will end on the 31st, but I feel that this has lasted too long and I will be doing the drawing tonight. I will post and pm the winners and pizza will be delivered on the 31st as promised. Thanks for all the support and good luck =]"	t5_2sle9	True

**When you place an order please update the [google document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmcPpxye8WDxdHBXLVcwS0g2N2VjVndENkhOZ183ckE&amp;usp=sharing#gid=0) to reflect which department you sent off to. Thanks again everyone for helping make this happen.**









~~With that said, we had an officer from one of the Boston PD departments come on reddit.  They brought up a part of the group I didn't even think of.  There are detectives and CSI teams out at the crime scenes which are still shutdown to the public.  I'll need to find a delivery location for them but, it'd be nice to get something out to them as well.~~  News said this was just reopened so I don't think it is active with CSI and detectives





~~Boston FBI and ATF were closed.  I believe there was at least two orders for Monday delivery to FBI so if anyone is compelled, setting something up for these locations Monday or during the week, that'd be great!~~ **PER THE FBI DIRECTLY: PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM ANY DELIVERY ORDERS!!  SECURITY MEASURES; THEY HAVE TO TURN THE FOOD AWAY....PLEASE SEND TO ANOTHER AGENCIES, FBI IS THE ONLY UNABLE TO ACCEPT OUR ORDERS THOUGH, THEY DO APPRECIATE THE GESTURE!!!** 




Also, another location that wasn't sent to is: [Suffolk County District Attorney's Office DA Daniel F. Conley](http://www.suffolkdistrictattorney.com/)  One Bulfinch Place  Boston MA 02114  Phone (617) 619-4000 
They will be heading up the prosecution of this guy!!!!




Boston Dispatch and EMS are out of Boston PD Headquarters at 1 Schroeder Plaza, Roxbury Crossing, MA 




Finally, these were all late additions, edited in at about 9:30pm on Saturday, 4-20-13 so any orders sent to any of these would be well received and appreciated:

Kenziekay082909	23	4	11	"I have posted a few times on here and have received one pizza from such a kind young man a few weeks ago when my family had nothing to eat. We still do not but that pizza was one of the smallest but BEST gifts we have ever received. then the next day a family offered to send us a $20 Walmart giftcard to help us get some food.

Amazing.

However we only get paid once a month and only received $1400 this month. Our money goes to bills, bills, and any food we can get for our 3 year old.

I do not want to ask again for a pizza, but we are starving.

We live in a home where the lady keeps expired food in the pantry and I am talking expired peanut butter since 1992 at its worst!!!

The full pantry is misleading since all of it is expired. Plus she is never home and never brings food.

My daughter has been eating bread and I have tried to make as much as I can for her and have not eaten much myself. She comes before me always.

My husband is a veteran and VA cannot do anything to help us. We have also gone to a food bank but we do not even have the gas to get out there now and haven't for weeks.

I am very blessed to have been gifted a card and a pizza this month. I had lost my faith in humanity but those two families restored it. It is great to know that there are still some kind hearts out there. Very reassuring.

Like I said, I hate to ask for another pizza but we need something. I do not expect it and will return the favor when possible! If there is something you would like in return please ask! My husband is in art school and loves drawing comics and cartoons so he can possibly draw one for someone who helps!'

IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS IN MORE NEED AND HAS NEVER RECEIVED A PIZZA OR ANY HELP, PLEASE CONSIDER THEM FIRST. I am not selfish and do not expect anything.

We say why the fuck not if it's free and hop on the ambulance. Mid-ride I wise up and ask the cool emt dude if ambulances really are free, he said no and we all laughed and I said fuck etc. now we're at mt Sinai hospital in queens and my gf went from a wheelchair to a gown in the er for a uti. Normally you just go to urgent care and get antibiotics for cheap but since this happened at 5am only
Hospitals were open. Did some research and ambulances are $1k and up and the hospital visit will be $400 or more(probably more).

It would have been perfect for me, since I have agoraphobia (among other things), and it's a 100% at-home job. They give you a week to study and pass the ""open book"" test, so I worked hard to absorb everything in the 161-page manual. I am really terrible at studying, so it wasn't easy. Then today I opened up the page to take the test, and found that I had mixed up the time it was due. I was supposed to turn it in at 12:00 AM on the 6th. I had misremembered it as 12:00 PM. It was basically the first time I had really pushed myself to study, and I had a great feeling of accomplishment when I realized I understood everything. It was heartbreaking, and I've felt like crap all day because of it. I sent them an email explaining everything and asking if I can take it, but I'm not confident it will work. Anyway, I'm on disability until I can find a good job, and since I'm supporting two people, the money's tight. I've been craving some short-term indulgence for days.

**Update:** I got home from work to find a flurry of responses across not just this thread but also the original trees post. [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) did me a serious solid, not just offer a pizza, but was able to help with enough cash that I can get real groceries for the first time in weeks. [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) has responded saying he will take care of me too, we corresponded. [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots) messaged me but I haven't heard back.

Now I'm in that weird predicament where I want to accept one of the gifts and have a Pizza today, but where I would feel terrible if all three of these people went through with their gifts. So far, dehOne's looks solid. Now I don't know what to do with the other two. But no responses from them yet and no pizzas. So hopefully I'm good now. This also means I'm well taken care of.

You guys are amazing. My eyes are leaking and I don't know why.

---

Long story short. Someone on /r/trees posted a picture of pizza. [I complained because I'm hungry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/) (Which in hindsight I should have just stayed quiet.) This led to posts which I was sent here.

It's 4/20. Smokers everywhere across the country think it's a day to celebrate recreational smoking. I smoke occasionally for severe anxiety and depression problems.

But today I can't. I work all weekend. In addition, we're between paychecks. There's no money on hand, negative $26 debt in my account, and no food on the shelf but a few potatoes and a pack of spaghetti noodles. I won't get to eat a full meal, and I won't get to smoke out casually. But that picture of Pizza is damn tempting, and I'm fighting off hunger pains.

I work 40+ hours a week. My roommate just lost her job and is unhelpful. My wife has medical problems and cannot work, but SSDI has spent months ""processing"" her. So she has no income for the last 4 years. My medical is nearly $200 a month to account for her medication and our coverage. We just had a baby who is wonderful. With four people in the house, I pay bills and rent and have a little bit of cash left over a month goes to her medical and nickle/dime bills. The smoke I have for my own problems was fronted to me by my friend, and I smoke probably about $20 a month at most.

There are no excuses. A self sufficient man like me should be able to handle my money well enough to take care of this by myself. Due to our situation, though, we have not been able to afford laundry for several months, we haven't bought more than a handful of food a month, and my car will be unusable because I can't afford repairs.

Bad year so far. It would be nice to give the wife something to eat this weekend."	t5_2sle9	True

1341649882.0	w67fd	[Request]  Reddit, help these good folks out of a bad situation, just a little bit.		16	1	3	"One foot at a time, you know?  Okay, so here's the breakdown.

On my way to work at Wal-mart on Thursday I spotted a car parked out at the farthest end of the parking lot with the hood up.  I, thinking that maybe they needed a jump or something, went over to check in and see if I could help.  

It turns out that these people are actually neck-deep in a shitty situation.  

They were on their way to California from Indiana so the husband could start his job as a welder for biodiesel fuel tanks.  14 miles from my workplace their vehicle's timing belt skips and they're stranded on the interstate.  A tow truck comes and tows them 14 miles to Colby, KS and drops them off in the Wal-mart parking lot, charging them $200 just for dropping them there.  Now they're stuck, broke, and have absolutely no way to fix it.  I ask them how much they need, they say it'll probably cost a couple hundred to fix their vehicle enough to get them going.

Maybe I'm an idiot for trusting them, but I *know* they're truthful, I know it in my damn heart.  I tell them I'll spot them as much cash as I can, at least it'll pay for a hotel and some food.  I go in, my balance is $279.15.   I withdraw $100 and hand it over.  I don't get paid for two more weeks, I'm in need of an oil change and I need fuel to keep me going on the 1-hour trip to and from work.  I'm literally running on the skin of my teeth with $179.   I pick them up a case of water to because it's goddamn hot outside and you can't sit in the sun for that long without hydration.  

I start my shift, go inside, come back out at 1am and they're still there.  They went and found a hotel for the night.  I go home and come back the next day (Friday).

They're still out there, they ask me if I have any tools and I don't have them on me.  They explain to me what's wrong with their vehicle as far as they can tell and they need some metric wrenches and sockets to get the damn thing off.  They're worried that management will call the cops or a towtruck and have their vehicle impounded.  I go inside and talk to my boss and get a promise out of him that they'll leave it alone.

I make a few more plans, on my lunch I'll take them to a hotel and get them another night.  In the morning I'll look for some wrenches and sockets to bring and see if we can't get that fucking belt off.  

I left them at the motel 6 for the night.  They'll call in the morning.

Reddit, I'm fucked, they're fucked.  I have $90 to survive on for the next two weeks.  I might be able to do it, Gods willing, but right now I've given every last penny I can spare.  I'm appealing now to you guys, at least help get them a hot meal.  They're in desperate need of help and a little kindness shown to them from strangers on the internet and maybe a good meal will help them just a little bit, just for another day.

If nothing else, it's my birthday, think of it as a birthday gift.  

I'm also somewhat artistic, I can draw ponies.  If you help them out I promise you the best fucking picture my pencil and hand can draw.

I'll update in the morning.  I'm tired.

Update 1:  Sorry about that folks, I didn't get around to it in the morning.  Luckily they're staying tonight at a local family's house that has given them a little bit of relaxation time and a hot meal.  I'm still open for receiving pizza, we've only got a Pizza Hut here, if anyone wishes to donate something.  They got the tools they needed to get their belts off, which is a godsend.  I'll probably see them tomorrow and I'll get around to talking to them about local charities that might be able to give them a hand.  I should probably make sure that this is okay with them too.

I'm a recently graduated college student in the 3D film industry having a hard time looking for work. I found a summer job teaching kids 3D gaming software at a summer camp but since i've only just started, i'm stuck without money for the next few weeks. I had to borrow this months rent from my 18 year old hard working brother who works at a grocery store. Any money I can get I must save to repay him. My only chance is to sell some of my possessions and try to find free lance work. I'm so sick of PB&amp;J. I live with 3 other struggling roommates and If anybody finds it in their heart to send me a Pizza I will share it with them. This is the first time I've ever asked for a pizza here.

~~I invited some younger friends over just for a chillaxing New Years Eve party. They opted to walk to the park, while I went to a gas station for a nice 83 cent cola. They told me they got lost while walking to the park, fair enough, I'm there chaperone, responsibility is on me for their safety. Unknown to me however, they were really at home, directing the whole ordeal, while eating just about every ounce of food in my apartment. This carried on for 140 minutes, with increasing intensity, before I caught on and came home. It wasn't too funny to me.~~

~~In the same vein, my elderly Grandmother (90 1/2 years) still lives alone in the same, massive house as her family of 10 did. Over the years, the unused potions of her house have become a stockpile of things she doesn't need, or people left, and don't want. I've been helping her clean and fix up the house, kill the roaches and mice, and try and make her life a little more enjoyable. I also spent my last dime in the process.~~

~~I'm broke and alone on this sunday, so, can anyone help? I would really...like, REALLY appreciate some noms :3~~

~~I also have a free steam game to offer. Payday: the Heist. Not exactly a blockbuster kind of game, but its what I have~~

EDIT 1:
Received the pizza! Half cheese for me, half mushroom for my grandmother. She was quoted as telling Cuntpuncher27: ""Thank you Thank you thank you!"" (yes, three times)

A collection of pics on my imgur, a few of me, one of the living room before our clean up (Which was 3 hours in-progress when the pic was taken) one after, and one showing just how much we have left to go... Then. One with me and Grandma Wanda :3  and one of the pizza. You made her night, Miss Cuntpuncher27, and I'll sleep without an empty stomach, so, thank you so much! If I can ever return the favor in a few weeks or months or years, let me know!

Hello there,

My name is Anthraxium and i live in Holland.
Due to my situation (Mentally disabled; can't work) and my way too low income i haven't eaten in about two days, a friend of mine gave me some bread two days ago, before that, i didn't eat for nearly 4 days...

The next gov. payment is in 12 days: http://www.ib-groep.nl/particulieren/default.asp

At that point i can buy food again.

If someone is kind enough to share some food with me you could take my starvation away..

I nearly beg you to help me as i'm sitting here, scavenging for food and asking friends, but i can only ask so many times...

Greetings,
Me..

I just got to college for my third year and my girlfriend of 3 years has gone to Germany for a year, and she just broke it off with me today (3 weeks in) for whatever reasons.  I am also remembering my mother as the 1 year anniversary of her death has just passed (she was 46, I'm 21, Cancers a bitch)  Money and other issues are on my mind, but I've not felt this down in quite sometime.  I'm located in Vermont but I'm willing to pitch in for some pizza sending or receive some pizza love.  Either works for me, but I just feel the need to do something.

Hiya folks, Beaumont Texas here. 

Like the title said tonight's the big night and this is something I'd actually only planned on doing after I moved out but then I thought 'What the hell, I might already be at rock bottom but there's no good reason why I can't try and dig myself a couple more inches down here.'

That said my dad's not a such a big fan of queers (or me) but the 200-pound oaf of bigotry won't shy away from a surprise meat lover's pizza, 'specially after a hard day of harassing people to buy his company's imports of fancy Limited Addition Golden China Tea Plates.

Would go out and buy one myself (the pizza, not a tea plate), but I just started my job at OG a few days ago and won't be making any tips until this weekend plus my ritzy diet of nothing but peanuts and ramen needs to be toned down a bit, at least for a night, and it would be much appreciated on my part if you could help this rainbow-pisser knock down two proverbial birds with one moochful, delicious stone.

That being the case, I promised to buy 1 pie for each slice of pizza I received and I plan to stick to that promise.  I literally just started the job today and so it will be 2 weeks before I get a paycheck and likely a little longer before I can afford to buy any pizzas at all.

Turns out somebody hacked into my bank account and emptied it out. The bank caught it while it was mostly still pending, and contacted me. Because I had not authorized those purchases, they locked down my account and I got all but about $100 back. I was going to go into the bank today to get it sorted out and maybe get my account unlocked so I could use checks or something, but the one branch close to me is apparently closed on Saturdays.

I know everything will turn out fine, but I just feel shitty today. All my friends are out of town, and I could use some anonymous kindness.

If you care for back story, I'm currently on social assistance in my home city of Toronto. My landlord (Also on social assistance) and I are friends. We're currently at war with our neighbor, an angry old woman whom hates us for a history of things (Not that I feel we've been bad neighbors, to be honest), and who has seen fit to STEAL OUR MAIL from social assistance, and write 'return to sender' on it and jam it back in a post box.

If you're unfamiliar with how social assistance works, if they have their mail returned they immediately cut off support to that particular address. The end result for us is that due to our neighbor returning our mail, they have suspended our accounts until we can sort things out and prove we actually live where we claim to live. This means we aren't getting help until the end of the month, and our pantry currently consists of corn meal, some sugar, and dog kibble.

Through a bizarre turn of events I am receiving a free tablet PC from 2003 in a short matter of time, probably tomorrow, from my beautiful girlfriend.

(NSFW if your work is uptight about doodled penises)

My proposition is this, RAOP: In return for your generous and benevolent act of much needed nutrition, I will offer you my services as a crappy doodler, once I acquire this tablet. I will also offer you a free copy of my independent puzzle game produced with my friend from Alberta, [Gravity Garden](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=16216.0)! (It's already free on PC, I'm just offering it because... Because.) It was even recognized in Ukrainian PC magazine Domashny PK and featured on the JayIsGames weekly download, and nominated for best indie puzzle game of 2010, also on JayIsGames! (We lost!)

If for some reason that's not enough for you (and I don't see why it wouldn't be) please don't hesitate to make unreasonable demands of me! I'm down for just about anything that doesn't involve nudity (I'm not that kind of girl [I'm a man]) or spiders. If I can sing you [Tonight, The Streets Are Ours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmugwrlnSWA), or offer you a picture of me wearing a gasmask, a cowboy hat, a soldier helmet, and a soviet infantry hat, all at the same time, [I can do that too](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1160406/pro.jpg).

I usually prefer to give and hope that the karma might make it's way back to me one day, but I've fallen on some hard times. Over the last year I've lost 100 pounds without even trying. I've been dealing with chronic nausea most days accompanied by a near complete loss of appetite and have been in and out of the doctor's office. 

Just this morning I had to get an upper endoscopy to find out what's wrong with me and it failed to yield any answers. The medical bills are piling up and it's gotten to the point that I can't even afford food on the days that I'm actually hungry enough to eat.

I know pizza isn't exactly the healthiest vegetable in the world, but I just need to put some weight on at this point. The doctor says that if I lose any more weight it would be very dangerous for me to get a cold or flu. Thanks in advance for anything you can send.

Spent my last few bucks on cat food awhile ago (gotta feed the chilluns first), so I've been living off a big bag of rice for the last week or two.  No problem there, I can rough it.  BUT, this morning I go to make my breakfast rice, and lo and behold, there's like 15 little roaches (and a couple larger ones) inside the bag, feasting on my would be meal.  My whole apartment complex is infested with the fuckers, and I'd gotten pretty good at guarding my food, but I guess they found a hole in the bag.  ;_;  So picture me trying to grab a dozen or so of these monsters as they burrow deeper into the rice.  I pour some rice into a bowl for easier sifting, figure I can get them out if there's less volume.  Then all the wriggling and  scurrying starts to get to me.  Put the whole mess back in the cabinet, shut door and declared loudly, ""NOPE.""

But it's several hours later and my tummy is inciting rebellion.  I thinks it's time to (wo)man up and face the Roach Rice.  I'm trying really, REALLY hard not to think about the nutritional content of cockroach shit, but can't help it.  I got turned down for the job I was really hoping to get today too, so yeah... pizza sounds fantastic right about now.

Pay sucked. GF at the time was a supervisor at albertsons. She got me a better, higher paying job there. Well, they dicked me around at Albertsons(made me stock the whole store, while 2 other guys sat on their ass). Because of politics, management did nothing. I quit. My gf supported my decision and told me that ""I have your back. Don't worry about money. Just pay me back when you get a job. I'll pay your rent don't worry."" I didn't even ask her. She offered. I suffer from major depression disorder and have had rough interactions with people, so I'm not used to such treatment. It felt good. And I relied on her while applying for jobs every day. I got my job back at wal-mart and actually am in line for a promotion. BUT I don't get paid until next week. I've exhausted all of my ramen and hot dogs. And 2 weeks ago, she broke up with me and couldnt so much as give me a reason. BUT she said ""I still have your back on rent"" Well, today's the 1st. And she is going back on her word. I have a week to come up with $550 for rent. And I've run out of food. I have $0 to my name. And now, I'm on my own for   everything. All because I believed her. I wouldn't have quit Albertsons so quickly if she hadnt have told me she wouldve had my back. I completely put faith in her. And it failed.

We could REALLY go for a pizza right now! We have been helping our friends renovate their new home and have used our money to pay for gas to get out to their home multiple times, for gas for my husband to get to school, or for food for our baby girl.

One pizza would be awesome. We would be extremely grateful. 

My husband is a fantastic artist and is willing to draw a picture of something for the one who buys us a pizza! =D

I won't be able to mail your piece out until after Tuesday (fiancé gets his last paycheck then), but you have my word that whatever piece of art you choose is yours if you're willing to foot the bill for a pizza.

Anyway, thanks so much for considering! We'd both sincerely appreciate your help.

It was actually a huge weight off her shoulders because she normally makes dinner and she's been stressing about her cat a whole lot. She's gone today to spend some time with a friend who's going to help her with Raven.

We taught my mom Fluxx and Gubs, and I taught both of them how to play Scopa, it's the first family time we've had in weeks. Everyone's stress levels were greatly reduced.

I happen to think the sub looks awesome.  What do you think?


A few new things have been implemented.  When you make a post to the subreddit, please use the tags to mark your post as a request or offer.  If you are posting something about a deal or discount, please use meta and a mod will add the tag for meta posts.  


Users are asked to mark offers as such and requests as such.  It will color code the thread and will enable people to use the new search on the side to sift through specific posts.


Another thing we have implemented is user flair.  There is a flair for those who have given pizza, they will be given the slice of pizza.  For users who have been gifted from a request/contest you will be given a green gift to represent that you've been gifted in the sub.


Givers, please message the mods to let us know who you gave to so we can assign proper flair for both you and your recipient too.  People who have received can also message the mods and let us know who gave to you so everyone gets their proper flair assigned.


The rules haven't changed, they all remain the same.  We just thought it was time to revamp things and give the sub a new look.  The sidebar now has a hover feature for the rules.. PLEASE READ THOSE PRIOR TO POSTING!!!

We met two years ago, and after several long term relationships (4+years) I never even saw myself getting married until I met him... This amazing man just spent his last pennies, on an expensive last minute plane ticket to fly me out of a remote location on the east coast next friday, which my boss was supposed to pay for but he is conveniently out of contact range at this point in time... literally, there is no cellphone signal or internet or any way to contact him... please note I will be fighting for reimbursement of ticket cost....

Needless to say, he pulled through at the last minute and is saving my butt, because I'm not even eligible for a credit card with my student debt and have no access to purchase a flight home. I'm in a super remote location and can't transfer him money (email transfers dont work outside of the country and the closest bank is hours away by car, which I dont have...) but I don't want him to go hungry.... He has very few groceries, but if someone could order him a pizza or even send him a shoprite/acme giftcard (local grocery stores) I would be so grateful!  I get there on friday, and I do have money so I would totally repay said debt at my earliest convenience!!! 

If this is something you think you could do, I would not only repay you but pay it forward as well! I'm in an impossibly tight spot, and I feel totally indebted to my incredible white night..

* I would be totally willing to show ticket as proof, if necessary! please pm me :)

I thought this was a great idea, the person at the other end had/has a $20 AMC movie gift card. Perfect, I have an AMC theater that I go to all the time. So I responded and here we go.


*RAOP Gift Cards*

*from XXXXXXXXXXXXXX*

  *sent 1 month ago*

*Are you still willing to do this?*

**I replied yes**

*re: RAOP Gift Cards*

*from XXXXXXXXXXXXX*

  *sent 1 month ago*

*Cool. I have never traded gift cards, so I am not sure how to work this. Any ideas?*

**I asked a few questions about what he/she had**

*re: RAOP Gift Cards*

*from XXXXXXXXXXXX*

  *sent 1 month ago*

*It is a physical card, or rather two physical cards, for 10.00 each.*

**This is probably where I should have just said thanks but no thanks, but I was in a good mood and thought ""what the hell"" hopefully this person won't screw me out of movie gift cards. So I decided to send him/her a $20.00 e-gift card from dominos**

*re: RAOP Gift Cards*

*from XXXXXXXXX*

*  sent 1 month ago*

*Okay. My email is: XXXXXXXXXXXX*

*When I go to mail it tomorrow, as that is when I have available transportation, I will take a picture of it going* 

*into the mailbox and email/PM it to you. Does that work?*

**Yes, that would have worked, unfortunately those pictures were never sent to me. In any case he/she received the gift cards.**

*XXXXXXX@gmail.com *

*Jul 19 to me* 

*Got it. :) I will be sending this out tomorrow, and taking picture.*


**So then I wait, and wait, and wait ... finally I send a PM asking when he/she had sent the gift card.**

*re: Card*

*from XXXXXXXXXXX*

 * sent 21 days ago*

*Last Sunday. If you still don't have them tomorrow, lemme know, I'll accost the mail dude and see wtf. Maybe he*

 *didn't check all the outboxes in the complex, we have like 40 of them for some reason.*


**Wait, didn't you tell me in an earlier PM that you needed to get transportation to send them? how do you now suddenly have 40 mail boxes in some complex? In any case I wait, I didn't get them tomorrow.**

*re: Card*

*from XXXXXXXX sent 20 days ago*

*'kay, I'll accost the mailman.*

**More waiting, sent another nudge asking if it went out.**

*re: Card*

*from XXXXXXXX sent 18 days ago*

*It was still in the mailbox for some reason. But if you haven't gotten it soon, I will send you twenty by paypal*

*when I get paid.*

**WHAT!? So let me get this straight, the gift cards are still in the mailbox that you needed transportation to get to 2 weeks later? What sort of mailbox that you need transportation to get to allows you to see mail that was put in it. If it was your mailbox on your house then yes, but you would have seen that before 2 weeks. this is starting to sound like a heaping helping of BS. And why if you sent the gift cards would you then offer to pay me $20.00 on paypal? but i have to see this through.**

*re: Card*

*from XXXXXXXXXX sent 13 days ago*

*Yes. Is your paypal email the same as the email you used to send me gift card. I will send you 20.00 when I get* 

*paid finally on Friday to whatever it is, and when you get the gift card, keep that as bonus.*


**I don't even know where to begin with this, to this persons credit he/she has continued to communicate with me and even sent me a whopping $2.00 on paypal, but this should have been a clean transaction, nice and easy. Instead here I am still thinking about it.** 

BTW this is more about me needing to vent than anything else. I feel like I'm a good guy with a big heart and I do for others when I have the means. It's nonsense like this that makes me not want to help others.

**TL;DR:** responded to an add to swap gift cards, person reneged and is now on the longest term payment plan for $20.00 ever recorded.

I've been searching for a job for the duration of this slow, twisted screw-over, but have had no luck. I will receive *some* unemployment, but it will not come in for another two weeks, provided my last employer doesn't somehow convince the state to also screw me over. It's been an unusually rough patch in my life, and I'll spare you the details of everything else, but I'm 3,000 miles from my family and they're too broke with medical bills to help. 

Would anyone be so kind as to order me a pizza and feed me for a few days?

You'll also be doing me the huge favor of giving my brain something other than water and gum to work with. I've been over-clocking it with the amount of homework this part of the semester has dumped upon me.

I don't have a million friends to talk to, so I'm going to talk to you, and hopefully eat dinner afterwards!

It was my mistake, I understand that now. Long story short (will post long story long if there is any interest), a woman that made me feel incredibly safe and comfortable came to me with a sob story and I gave her my entire paycheck. I AM employed, so please give pizza first to those who are not, but I am completely out of food and money until my next paycheck, two weeks from now. 

Mostly the pizza is to try and comfort my hurt pride. I always considered myself a responsible person who could not be lied to or manipulated. It is frustrating to think that what I thought as being the most sincere emotional exchange I had experienced, was truly a con set up to take my hard-earned money. And it IS hard-earned, I nanny for FOUR children- all under the age of eight! 

I know this isn't what is usually seen as deserving of pizza- especially since I put myself in this position- but I am counting on Randomactsofpizza to be truly random and send a pizza to someone who just made a very painful ""growing up"" mistake!

Thanks for taking the time to read this, everybody. I wish I could impart some wisdom or advice after experiencing this fuck-up, but I truly don't know what I've learned from it. There was nothing she did that could have lead me to not trust her! And you can't just not trust anybody! So I don't know. Maybe the wisdom is to trust people and help them when you can, but not in priority over your own needs. Take care of yourself so that you can then take care of others?

1367443348.0	1diaao	Follow up to previous request. [Recieved]	darkmooninc	8	2	3	"Here's an overview of what happened. I was in dire straights. Medical problems and only one income for three adults and a child has strained our financial situation. On Friday April 19th I looked into my bank account and [realized the worst had come.](http://i.imgur.com/cwgRVrT.jpg) That's negative $26. We had no food in the fridge for adults and I was crushed in despair under my situation.

Then someone on /r/trees posted a delicious picture of [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/4Ec6Qyb.jpg) (My god that is still delicious looking...) which I decided to [comment on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/c9j05w3)  Now in hindsight maybe I should have just stayed quiet but the hunger was on me something fierce. From that post, I was given the idea to try /r/RandomActsOfPizza and /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza . Now, I'm hesitant because I work hard for what little money I have and begging seems depressing. But, I have a [wife and child](http://i.imgur.com/Di5vxyr.jpg) and a [recently unemployed roommate](http://i.imgur.com/PnX4wnP.jpg) who are all really important to me. But I asked. Which [I capped the original post into a pic.](http://i.imgur.com/BSbVsqx.jpg)

I made the post as I went in to work that night. And in my cubby box work had given me [a pair of free tickets to a certain event.](http://i.imgur.com/UnoVdlT.jpg) We'll get back to that.

So I spent work from midnight till eight in the morning waiting to see how things would turn out. I got a response from [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots) quickly, in offer to get us pizza. I was hesitant and wasn't sure how reliable anyone is on the internet, so I replied and asked, maybe begged, for just a pizza. Just one pizza maybe, you know? Remind me what it's like to eat a fatty meal, but a filling one at that. Then a response by  [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) offering pizza. I should have said no. But it sounded like I might get two pizzas. Shame on me, I guess. Then another person [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) sent a pizza. 3 whole pizzas!

I did in many of these cases try to let them know that someone else already helped, but they seemed insistent. I told them to send pizzas in the evening.

Me and the wife and our daughter left to go see [muppets](http://i.imgur.com/Oh5zOUa.jpg) and watch a free show work comped me. [It was crazy and my daughter loved it.](http://i.imgur.com/VEfmQB2.jpg) I had barely enough gas to get there and back before the gas light came on, which just meant I would be walking to work the next week. But it's worth it, you know? [It's worth it to see her eyes light up.](http://i.imgur.com/NrKAqLxh.jpg)

So I return home to find pizzas. Pizzas everywhere. They came while we were at the show, and our roommate had received them. My memory is hazy who got what, and I didn't take many pictures, but I'll try and make the correct associations there.  donny_pots and mm_kay both sent me pizzas, I think three total between them. But it was dehOne who made me cry.

dehOne first sent me [this amazing spread of food.](http://i.imgur.com/xzFnycJh.jpg) which was a weekend meal enough as is, not to mentiuon mm_kay and donny_pot's gifts above. But then dehOne went one step further. I got $25 in Paypal which was the reason I could get to work on gas the next week. And then my email got this amazing thing: [this gift card](http://i.imgur.com/NW0lK8j.jpg). What do you do for that? My wife and I were stunned with tears. [This picture doesn't account for the fifth pizza we ate and the side items.](http://i.imgur.com/R0P6ZMS.jpg) but I can tell you that the following week we were fed. Lastly, at the end of that day, I found someone had gifted me a month of Reddit Gold.

So there you go Reddit. I asked for maybe a pizza or two. My pessimism told me no one would really help, it was wrong. With negative money, next to empty gas, an empty fridge, and a lot of stress I asked you guys for help. And you helped. About ten pizzas, $25 in my gas tank, a Sesame Street show (not you guys technically but I still thank you), and enough food to get us to a paycheck where we can eat real food finally.

Thank you. I love you all. Thank you so much. I feel terrible still, as the situation is barely improving. Random Acts is not for long term. I don't really want to ask for help again, I need to just get a second job. But thank you for this brief relief from the stress. Thank you [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots), thank you [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay), and thank you a big bunch [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne).

Thank you all.

I hope my next big post is how I have more money than I know what to do with and have bought 20 pizzas for people on Reddit."	t5_2sle9	True

I haven't seen many UK threads (if any) on here, but I'll live in hope.

My family consists of my mum, me (the eldest, 23) my brother and sister. Mum's not had a job in years, due to raising us, and is finding it really hard to get anyone to hire this 43 year year old woman, who's only work experience in the last 20 years is at a charity shop, and despite effectively managing that place they passed over her when a position came up. I've recently finished my apprenticeship and am back to being unemployed. 

Then there's the depression. My mum's suffered with it for around about 7 years, I've been suffering for nearly 4 the end of my apprenticeship drove me to breakdown into a hysterical mess; and my sister attempted suicide 2 years ago and has been struggling since.

We barely have the heating on due to not having a great deal to spare  on gas, and we've been scraping by after paying bills and buy what food we can. Occasionally one of us is able to eat out, but it's a rarity. I don't remember the last time we all had pizza.

I finally finished my website, [prizegenius.com](http://prizegenius.com) and would really appreciate it if someone could help me test the system or offer any advice.

The way the website works - you choose a prize you want to win and are prompted to fill out an offer from an advertiser. I've tried to pick the least spammy ads and the simplest ones to complete. Once you complete the offer, the algorithm will calculate if you are a winner or not. You can try as many times as you want until you win.

[I put together a video to walk you through the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4z0hh1098Q)

What I want you to do:

- Let me know if there are any offers that don't credit when they should, or if there is any other reason for me to remove a certain advertiser and look for a new one.

- Suggest new prizes that I can offer.

- Report any loopholes or ways that someone can cheat this system.

- Any general feedback will also be greatly appreciated.

I have a lot of $10 gift card codes to restaurant.com and will give a code out to any who replies to this post. Just type ""10gc"" anywhere in your response and I will PM you the code.

1325529565.0	o00dc	[Request] Food for poor kid feeling really depressed? (Story in comments)(Lengthy)	RyuTaskmaster	9	1	5	"Hello everyone. I tried posting this last night, but realized that all the pizza places around here were closed, so I'll just try posting it again here today. I made a new reddit user name because I don't want my sister to read this.

Hey guys, please, allow me to just give you some back story on why I'm actually feeling down. I'm normally a pretty positive guy, but this Holiday season has really gotten to me.

My name's Mike, and I'd like to share with you the sparknotes version of my life. When I was a little kid my Dad passed away from brain cancer, my Mom remarried a man and then about a year later she passed away from lung cancer. My sister and I lived with the new husband for about a year and a half until we moved in with a family we met through a church here in town. Turns out that they weren't really ready for more kids and were incredibly abusive to my sister and I. We moved in when I was 12 and my sister moved about two years later when she turned 18. I stayed there for another year alone until a family I met through a church camp wanted me to move in with them up north. After a summer with them, they decided they no longer wanted me and sent me back down to the cities. When I came back down, I was dropped off at my Aunt's house who wants nothing to do with me and she turned me away.

The first family I stayed with for the three years, who had legal guardianship of me, turned me away because they said I gave the Mom mental problems. Being left with all my belongings on a side of a road, I called a friend and his family let me stay with them for a few years so I could finish school here in town. About a year in, they get a job offer from a place in Iowa, so they moved. They offered for me to come with, but I had an offer from a friend here in town that begged me to stay and graduate with the new friends I had met at this school. I did that, but that summer they were going to have a relative move in with them, so I had to move out of there when I was 17. 

I ended up moving to a house that wasn't so good, but the best I could get because I was still 17. I ended up working at a game store called Play N Trade where I met some of the greatest people I've ever known. I poured hours upon hours into that store. They closed down two years ago on Christmas Eve because of an investor going bankrupt due to investing in too many long term things. 

I went unemployed for about three months or so until I started working at another game store. I really didn't like it, but they went bankrupt as well, so I lost another job. After about another three months or so I started working where I'm working now, and I'm slowing starting to catch up on the large amount that I owe my renters from going unemployed so much. 

This Holiday season I stayed home on Christmas, with nothing but coke to drink. I currently have $1.24 to my name. I haven't eaten in three days, and I won't until Thursday, unless someone would be gracious enough to order me a Pizza. 

I do have steam, and I got some coupons during the sale, if you'd want any of those, you're more than welcome to have any of them.

I try not to get down, and normally I'm not, but during a holiday season with no family, and losing a job that meant a lot to me, and just being extremely hungry, I'm feeling down.

If someone would be kind enough to get me anything, hell, another 2 liter of coke would be great, I would be forever grateful.

Thank you for reading this and allowing me to vent, it feels good to type it all out sometimes and just let it all go. Happy New Year everyone.

In case you missed it the first time around here's the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/mf231/request_im_building_a_site_to_deliver_munchies_to/). 

TL;DR? My friends and I are starting a business in Burlington, VT next year to deliver food to drunk and high kids so that they're not putting themselves in danger by going out into the world to get their own. The only thing was, it was taking a while to get the website together.

We hadn't had much in the way of food that actually tastes good this semester and [ZeeRex](http://www.reddit.com/user/ZeeRex) was nice enough to order us a pizza! All the way from [Texas](http://imgur.com/a/ykwOg#vixMV)! He liked what we were up to, and wanted to support us keeping all the Ents safe. In exchange, we made him an official Initial Investor on our About Us page.

Well, a month has passed, and most of the website is functional. We thought we'd give you all a preview of what it looks like. So without further adieu, here's [The Burlington Munch](theburlingtonmunch.freeiz.com)! We've still got to fine tune the e-commerce portion of it, and get our final menu down for the upcoming 2012 Fall Semester. We've also got to get our capital and employees lined up.

So here we are. We need to do some more work on the site, but we're all hungry and poor again. Everyone on The Burlington Munch team would really appreciate another pizza so we can get this business in motion. [Thanks Reddit!](http://imgur.com/a/ykwOg#dn2Ue)"	t5_2sle9	True

I haven't received my grant money for college yet, and had to use my only disposable income to purchase my books for classes. About 500 dollars worth. My mom bought a fair amount of meat and chicken (relative to our income) around 4pm. Well, around 4pm is when the power went out here, so we had to throw out $50 dollars of good meat. We have plenty of dry food to get by on, but it would mean a lot to my mom if we had an easy day.	t5_2sle9	True

I'm stuck in a funk that I'm having a hard time lifting myself up out of.  Since I can't seem to make myself happy or smile, maybe this offer can make you smile and happy instead.  Life is kicking my butt and I'm an unhappy camper.  Let's make my unhappy turn into your happy okay!?  

A few things about this offer:

1. You gotta be close to Papa Johns to pick it up

2. You must live in the US, as it won't work outside the US

3. Your account must meet our posting guidelines which means older than a month and active on reddit

To enter, just comment with something that makes you happy, even when life isn't so great.  For me, it would be my kids... they keep me going and grounded.  Love my little ladies with everything in me! :)

AmpleDeficit	11	4	7	"Brevity isn't my forte, but please bear with me. I'm 23, my life the past year has been a downward spiral into alcoholism and a truly self-destructive mindset. I lost my job, quit college for the 4th time, moved from the place I loved back home to live with my grandmother. Things take a turn for the worse, and I have a run-in with the police on a drunken rampage that I decide to involve a loaded gun this time. Make bail after a week by my never-in-my-life dad trying to step up to the plate. Happy to try and connect. Dad ends up losing his temper and beating me. I leave, get lucky with somebody accommodating me, old family friend, turns out they just want to suck every last penny out of me to support their ""habits"". 

Meet another ""good Samaritan"", hit it off real well and decide to try starting a small business together, things look up. Then he asks for me to write a bad check for him. He'll get it back to me next week, no worries. Next week. Couple weeks..couple more checks. Give me $300 for the blackjack table and I'll double it. Quit your regular day job and let's work full time together on something else. Well this leads to that, and I find myself losing my mind. I have nowhere to turn to except booze, the one that's always there for me in the end, it seems, when everyone else has betrayed. 

I land myself back in jail for a month, relieved to be away from all the stress. But where's that friend who has been planning to pay me back for all these months? I get out earlier today to find out that he has wiped my entire PayPal out, left me -$924, -$5 on my Green Dot card (all I can get now that no bank will accept me). Also ruining my eBay account, my only source of income for the past several months. Not counting the -$3000 on my PayPal SmartConnect credit line. 

Where is he to be found? Long gone. Where am I? Sitting here with no food, nothing, not even a snack in this house. I may not be one of those people who haven't eaten for days, or that life has just beat down on its own free will. I'm in this predicament because of my actions and irresponsible behavior. Because I let life get me down and I chose the wrong solutions. I don't feel I'm as deserving of charity pizza over anyone, if anyone at all. I just wanted to come on here and say that I really didn't expect to be betrayed like this by someone I felt I could trust, and I woulda gone and gotten myself a pizza with my own money had I not been cleaned out. And then some. But alas, this is what happened, and I am sitting here penniless, can't even make money with the debt, I doubt PayPal will be fixing this anytime soon, or ever. No excuses. Just hungry, starving to get out and buy that real food, my first plan of action upon release. Not only was that ruined, but the pain of this betrayal is great. If anybody can find it in their heart to add just a little positive note to this day, which have been far and few in between, I will be eternally grateful and I will return the favor for somebody else some day, when I have my life back on track and dig myself out of this seemingly bottomless pit.

All charities go towards the wounded warrior foundation, and we are a growing group of friends. 


Now that I got that out of the way, lets get to the details. 

I need a facebook timeline. One that embodies the US military, and video games. If you could come up with a logo for us as well, that would be epic. 

I'm willing to buy a large pizza with whatever you want on top of it. I will do this for two people, or whoever has the best logo.

So, as many of you already know (if you've seen my recent 2 posts) I'm a Duke fan.  Sadly, they got knocked outta the tournament.  Here's how to win a meal for this coming up Saturday/Sunday time frame!

* You have to guess who is going to move onto the championship game.
* You must give a combined total points for both games (ex: Louisville - 81 and Witchita St. - 74 = 155 points.)
* Person with the correct teams and closest combined scores gets a free meal on me.
* Who can refuse a chance to win a free meal on the Championship Game night? (Monday, the 8th)

Best of luck!!!!  I'll be rootin for the underdog of course!

http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/icay5/request_a_pizza_from_reddit_would_help_but/

I was in a really shitty place 5 months ago. No money, no phone, no nothing. Now, I've got two jobs, paying a car note, moving into my own place and assuming guardian role of my little brother (who my father also kicked out, wtf.)

Anyway, I was thinking about the pizza I got and how happy I was when I received it, when I remembered that I never paid it back! How fucked up of me.

Anyway, since it's the Christmas season and my credit card bill (yeah, I got one of those now too!) will be being paid in the next couple days, I figure why not spread the cheer a little and get some pizza! I'll definitely do one, but I just had to pay my registration on my car and my deposit on my new apartment so I'll see how many others I can do.

BUT, I want this to be interesting. If I decide to accept your request, I want something in return. The best part? It can be ANYTHING. Anything at all. Delivered digitally, delivered physically, it doesn't matter. The only catch is: it has to be something you somehow acquired/created/spawned on your own. Basically, I don't want a link to some picture from the internet or something like that. It can be a song, it can be a thank you picture, (but that's a little boring) it can be a drawing, I really don't care! Don't tell me what you're going to offer me until I accept your request, to make it a bit more fair.

Well, have at it, Reddit. Shoot me your stories!

I will donate when I am on better financial footing.  I graduate in about a month and expect (hope) to be able to do better then.  


The original thread I made is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/1gonds/request/) but you might not be able to see it, I can see it on my comments but not on the homepage.  It was deleted because a mod mistakenly thought I was a brand new account.

Here is the text:
I've been struggling lately. I'm also a student going to school full time on the GI Bill, but over summer it doesn't cover my bills, let alone food. I ran out of most things, and I'm waiting on $20 that my mom sent me but it's in the mail. I am really hungry and I have eaten all the rice and oatmeal I can stomach. If someone would help me with a pizza I would be so very grateful. When I graduate, at the end of summer, I will pay it forward whenever I can. Or if you'd rather, I could give you a giftcard to use when you fall into need, once I'm able. I've been poor for a long time and I want to give back too. Once I'm working again, I'll more than be able to afford myself.
Thank you for anyone who reads this.

Additionally, I will add that I had an ach I thought was trapped in limbo that was for groceries, but it turns out that my account was blocked for a fraud transaction on the ninth.  I don't have a phone any longer so I never got the message.  And I haven't had money to try the card so I didn't discover it on my own.  I can show proof of that (privately) if necessary.  It's nothing detailed, unfortunately, just a failed transaction tape from the atm when the after-hours service was trying to remove the block temporarily so I could access the funds.  

I have been a redditor for over a year, and (privately) I will share the name of my former account if it is needed.  I am very hungry and I would very much appreciate any help given tonight.  

Thank you.

Please read this [X-post from /r/secretsanta](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/n37da/i_have_a_favor_to_ask_of_all_you_secret_santas/), and spread the word via FB, Twitter, upvotes, etc.  If my friend can meet her fundraising goal before xmas, I'll come back to RAoP and give away 10 pizzas.

**ORIGINAL POST:**

This may not be the right subreddit for this, but since we are all here to share a little joy this holiday season, I thought I'd make a humble request of this awesome reddit community.

I have been racking my brain trying to think of a xmas gift this year for a very dear friend of mine.  Today, she posted on FB about her fundraising efforts for the March of Dimes, and I got an idea.  

She and her family have participated in the March for Babies walk every year since losing their 12-day-old baby daughter Tera back in 2001 due to a congenital heart defect.  Her FB post mentioned that any donations through the end of the year [will be matched](https://www.marchofdimes.com/giving/support_yearend.html), effectively doubling the donation.

I thought it would be awesome if a bunch of random redditors started donating to her [March for Babies team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&amp;ct=4&amp;w=5202211&amp;u=TeamTeraUT) out of the blue.  She would be dumbfounded.  Her fundraising goal is $500, and if she could meet that goal before XMAS, it would **BLOW HER MIND!**

So please, all you wonderful secret santas out there -- how about taking on one more giftee for any donation amount at all?  I'll pledge that if she reaches her $500 goal before Dec. 25, **I'll donate an additional $200 myself.** 

So thank you all for reading this.  If you want to read up more on the charity, you can go to the [March for Babies](http://www.marchforbabies.org/) web site.  You can donate to my friend's team, Team Tera, on her team's [donation web page](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&amp;ct=4&amp;w=5202211&amp;u=TeamTeraUT).

**THANK YOU!!**

-----------------------


**TL;DR** - As a gift to a friend, I'm trying to raise money for her [March for Babies fundraising team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&amp;ct=4&amp;w=5202211&amp;u=TeamTeraUT).  I'm hoping awesome secret santas such as yourselves might want to help.  :-)

My husband is a mechanic and he isn't getting a lot of work (he's paid by the job essentially, not by the clocked in hours). We both work really hard but lately we just don't have enough. A pizza would be a real treat for us because we couldn't do anything special for our anniversary this past weekend (no money and we both worked). A pizza from anywhere would be so wonderful.  Thank you guys for reading this.

My account is new because I made another login so my husband doesn't know I'm trying to get a pizza for us."	t5_2sle9	True

Hi everyone. This is not my main account. My main account is [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/SoManyMinutes/).

I lost my job several months ago and have completely run out of money and food. I have an interview with public services on Monday but I'm out of luck until then.

I don't any kids to feed, I'm not homeless or any other sort of sob story -- I'm just really hungry. I don't eat a lot so I can easily make a pizza last until Monday.

I would truly appreciate any help one of you lovely people can give.

Cheers, folks.

I would never ask anyone for charity face to face, but I haven't eaten in 2 days because I needed books more than I needed food. I have gone without food before, and I have plenty of water, but I don't get paid for two weeks and have no one in my town to reach out to. I feel ashamed to beg like this but I will pay it forward when I have the means. 

Will trade shitty pencil/pen sketch. By shitty, I mean very very shitty. I have no artistic talent.

1376155276.0	1k3ic6	[request] GA, US ; I might be about to lose my place to live and be kicked out; a pizza would be a very welcome diversion to this stress.	Freshlaid_Dragon_egg	10	7	0	"From what you can tell from my post history, I had to move back in with my parents recently when I lost the job allowing me to live on my own and, in turn, was unable to find another before rent was due.

As is fair, I was told when I moved in that I would be expected to work around the house to earn my room. I was fine with this; how could that not be fair? How wrong I was.

What they equated as a fair amount of work for use of my old room [which had remained empty] was to work from 7am to past 7pm; essentially to work the same amount they did, but without any of the benefits, such as a regular amount of food, or the money to pay for my car insurance, student loan and only 10 a week, if I was lucky, for gas to go into town and apply for jobs.

Food, for example, is kept sparingly. The most there is to eat regularly is eggs [as they keep chickens], pbnj [sometimes] and tea. My mom thinks i'm losing weight solely because i'm working outside a lot, though the truth of it is i'm losing weight in equal portions from not having enough to eat on a regular basis.

The excessive expected work doesn't even end there. I was expected to work like this 7 days a week. Right, no off days. Kinda hard to look for a job with no time to do it.

Eventually, early on, I convinced them to give me tuesday and wednesday for looking for jobs; only one of such days I could feasibly even have the gas to leave the house to do so.

I've now ruined pretty much all of my clothes via souring from being drenched in sweat for the period of a day, since I've been busting my ass, but even the work I put in isn't satisfactory to them and  they've gotten more and more aggressive about it lately. Now i've got a threat looming over me that i'll be kicked out, which will ultimately ruin my shots of getting a job since i'll have no where to go, sleep or stay clean to keep myself presentable for a job.

So, anyhow, I would really like some pizza to help mask this stress, if only for a short time. I don't live close enough to any pizza place to have it delivered [apparently 5 miles is the local limit?] but i've got enough gas left over from this week to be able to drive to any of the big three to carry out."	t5_2sle9	True
1375906003.0	1jwmz7	[Request] I just moved into a new place and spent all my $ on a deposit + rent. Will create artwork in exchange for dinner! (IA)	DavidBowieIVDIY	7	1	2	"
Hi! I just moved into a new apartment and spent all of my money (except for a dollar in my wallet and about $2 in my bank account) in doing so. All I've got in my fridge/cupboards is some water, half a bottle of vodka, and some tea. I'd love to have a delicious pizza for dinner! It would even last me the rest of the week! 

I feel awful getting things just handed to me for free, so in return I would create a work of art (most likely a painting or drawing) of the subject of your choice. Want a totally rad painting of your feline or canine sidekick to hang above the mantle? You got it. A charcoal drawing of your favorite celebrity? Sure! Heck, some random thing that only your imagination can think of? Absolutely. 

(I would also be more than happy to PM prospective pizza givers with proof of my situation and examples of some of my work :) )

THANKS! :)

[EDIT] how about TWO paintings? A nice little diptych? 2 full days of just tea is wearing me down. Don't make me bust into the vodka (yet)

[EDIT2] for a little more incentive, [here is the latest painting that I did]( http://www.imgur.com/eq2YTLd.jpeg) . My tummy is grumbly :( [5:07 pm CST]

All we need now is an electricity pole and some papers to be signed for propane. We used a skillet to cook but our (second) generator just took a dump.
