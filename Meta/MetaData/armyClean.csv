1364306333.0	1b1hfq	I am an Active Duty Army Recruiter.  Have questions about joining the Army?  Ask them here. 	JavexV	177	30	979	"In the spirit of our resident Drill Sarn't's awesome BCT thread, and at the urging of the residents of this fine subreddit, let's (attempt) to consolidate all of our recruiting questions HERE!  

I'll do my best to answer everything that comes this way, or at the very least confirm what our other resident experts already know.

So everyone knows my background (if it matter), I've spent about 8 years in the Army, and 1 year so far as a Recruiter.  Recruiting tours typically run 3 years, so I've got another 2 to go.

Which means I'll be able to answer questions for a GOOD.  LONG.  WHILE.

(Please upvote this thread for visibility purposes, as I get no karma for self-posts, so you're not doing it for my imaginary score's sake.)

EDIT: Hey, so as this thread gets bigger, if you don't get an answer from me within a few hours, feel free to PM me.  I really do want to try to answer every question personally, even if it's only to confirm what other have already told you.

EDIT 2: **DO NOT LIE TO YOUR RECRUITERS**

EDIT 3: As of 16 MAY 13, the language list for 35P ACASP (ie, the only route for some of you prior service to come back to Active Duty) has been expanded.  GoArmy's Facebook page posted the list (along with the entirety of our Prior Service Business Rules), and you can find it at https://www.facebook.com/notes/goarmycom/updated-prior-service-ps-accession-business-rules-for-enlistments-into-the-regul/553474098029792

Edit 4: I will have to sleep sometime, but consider this an eternally active thread.  If you ask a question, I will respond eventually, it may just take a few hours.  If I take too long, again, please PM me.  I swear I will get back to you.

EDIT 5: **Allow me to stress I am an Active/Reserve Army Recruiter.  My answers may not apply to the National Guard, as they operate separately for recruiting.**

EDIT 6:  HEY GUYS, speaking of the National Guard, if you DO have a Guard-specific question, you can ask them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1bjjtt/i_am_a_recruiter_for_the_army_national_guard/).  All thanks to [/u/hazo501](http://www.reddit.com/user/hazo501). "	t5_2qtr8	True

About two miles in to the run, I notice a Soldier to my right begin to struggle to keep up with the formation, but she wasn't giving up. I started encouraging her and reminding her to keep herself dressed to the right. She was very obviously sucking wind, but she kept going. There were a couple times where she lagged behind, but each time I told her to catch up, she'd push herself a little harder. We finished the run and after we were dismissed, she found me and personally thanked me for helping her. I was taken aback by it, and just replied to her that she did all the work, and I complimented her fortitude. 

It's moments like those that make me proud to be an NCO, and make me happy to be in the Army.

1369344054.0	1exgre	New PT Uniform Prototype	PuddinCup	91	6	126	"http://imgur.com/a/jjAfh#yfkfgot

I have received a set of the new PT uniform prototype for a 45 day testing. After the 45 days I'll have to give feedback on how I feel about it. They have made some nice changes for each piece of the uniform.

For the shorts there is a spandex like underlining, so when you lift your legs up you wont give a show to your battle buddy. They cut out the net like crap on the old shorts, which I see a lot of people cutting that stuff out. I ran in the shorts this morning and they did not at all run up my crotch or ass which is awesome. I always find my self pulling the old PT shorts down on a run. There are two pockets on the pair of shorts, one for the keys like the old shorts and and ID pocket on the spandex part. Also the shorts feel really nice on my skin, the texture is smooth and silky. They are longer in length so no ranger panty's.

The short sleeve shirt feels nice too, so hopefully no more chapped nipples. The major said it's able to dry faster and the army letters wont fade. The long sleeve shirt has taken out the turtle neck thing, the cuffs are a lot looser too.

The PT jacket looks great in my opinion. The cuffs are looser to so you don't get that balloon effect. The PT pants are easy to put on and off now, they still have a zipper on the pants legs. The bottom of the pants legs are looser too so with all of it together you don't look like a marshmallow. 

So if you have any questions on the prototype PT uniform please feel free to ask. As a note I want to say sorry for the poor quality I only have a camera on my phone."	t5_2qtr8	True

I've posted it a few other places, but for an Army thats been at war for over a decade, we don't share stories often enough	moms3rdfavorite	102	21	19	"We rolled out of the gate just after sunrise. I was driving, SGT D was the Truck Commander, T was our gunner, and H and N were the 60mm mortar team attached to my vehicle. In fact, I wasn’t even supposed to be there, the only reason they needed me, my truck, or it’s weapon was to transport those mortars. The day before the mission, Lt. H, the leader of 3rd Platoon, told me he added me and my truck to the manifest. I remember myself and SGT D asking him if he was sure that he wanted T behind the vehicles weapon. He had been in combat before and had always done a decent job, he just wasn’t cut out for the lifestyle. He was about 5’5, and 130 pounds soaking wet with a French Canadian accent. Lt. H assured us that T could handle it and everything would go as planned. That disheartened me even more. The plan was a 25 hour mission sitting in large vehicles, deep in enemy territory. I didn’t like the plan. 


We met at the base of the Wata Pur Valley where we met with the Route Clearance Package. A specialized team used to clear routes of improvised explosive devices. A great thing to have, but it will ruin any element of surprise. Especially in the mountains where the vehicles were incredibly sluggish. The journey itself was an ordeal. I call it a route because it damn sure was no road. We entered by driving up north in a river bed, and up the center of the river until we came upon a small dirt road meant for small Toyota pick ups, so driving multi ton armored vehicles on these roads was especially nerve wracking. At some parts one side of the vehicle would rub against the mountain, while if I looked out of my window I would stare down a steep cliff, then we would take a turn and I would have to navigate around a gigantic boulder and a rock slide, or whatever else could go wrong or slow the mission up. It can take up to two hours to make the journey no longer than 5 miles. 


We finally reached the village of Qatar Kala, our planned mission site. The village was just off the side of the road, and across that road was a district center we had paid the locals to build. I was basically a four walled compound with a small section that was indoors so they could hold town meetings or pray. Our vehicles surrounded the district center, leaving two guns facing to the north, and two on the other side of the district center, facing Qatar Kala to the south, we had one more vehicle left where the road forked around the District Center. There was also a small sniper team and a few riflemen in an over watch position in the mountains to the Northeast of the village.  After Route Clearance uncluster fucked themselves and got on their way we went to ground. I went to the district center to help the platoons Forward Observer set up his Satellite communications. This was half of our mission, our medic was also setting up and we would be giving free medical care to any villager that stopped by. Being as how they were in the habit of using cow shit to patch holes in the walls of their homes, any chance to get medicine was something to get in line for. We also gave out food, flour, sugar, water, necessities. 


I got back to the truck and joined in on the miracle of minds that is lower enlisted Infantrymen making small talk. We ran through the usual; “Who’d You Rather?”, “Fuck, Marry, Kill”, “How much would it cost for you bang a guy”. We covered all the scholarly stuff, and the conversation turned to killing. The mortar guys talked about how it didn’t bother them, it was indirect fire so they didn’t see it and felt no impact. Then T shocked us all. He said he hoped he had never shot anybody, and that he would never have to. This is practically sacrilege in the Infantry. Even if you think it, you’d never say it. It’s like correcting an old man for saying a derogatory word about an Asian dude. You just don’t, they’re from a  different generation. We spend months leading up to war dehumanizing our enemies. When we talk, we talk about them as though they are sub human. This isn’t anything new. This is what soldiers do. This is what we must do. We have to dehumanize our enemy, and the people they walked amongst. This way, when we saw the carnage we caused. When we see the things that we see every night while wait for sleep to come, we can keep it together in that moment when strength in character is needed. So we questioned T, asked him what he had been doing during those fights he had been in if he wasn’t trying to kill the enemy. Trying to kill those wishing to do harm to him and his brothers. We asked him if we could trust him in our turret and he swore we could.


We had been in position for about an hour, and had started to set up for the night. For me that meant making sure my water and beef jerky were accessible, and I had successful communications with all friendly elements. The mortarmen got out and set up the tube and started unloading a few rounds for quick access. As the sun started getting higher a lot more villagers started to come out for the free aid we were giving. We remember a few that stood out, they put us on edge. We noticed one of them checking out the setup of our mortar tube so we told him to leave. We wanted to detain him, but had no grounds to do so.  About an hour later we set up gun rotations in the truck, because sitting in a sling in the sun for hours is draining and more awful than it sounds. That’s when I heard the first shot fire. It was a sniper round. I woke up the mortarmen, had to slap H in the helmet to get them alert. Then we started getting rifle fire from multiple positions. We were officially under enemy contact, but had no idea what was coming out way.  


Our mortar guys got out of the truck and started to hang 60mm high explosive rounds. Not wanting to just sit behind the drivers wheel I asked SGT D if I could go give them a hand. He said yes so I grabbed the vehicles extra Mk46 light machine gun and a few drums of ammo and ran over to them. As soon as I opened the driver door  I could hear rounds cracking past me, I could hear them ricochet off the vehicle. I ran to their position anyways. We had been in dozens of fights before, and this one was pretty small so far so we were just kind of dicking around, not taking it seriously. Idiots. I was teaching them about how the Mk46 worked and letting them shoot it, and they were teaching me how to fire a mortar.  Then it got serious. The district center was on the valley floor, and well over 100 heavily armed Taliban had slipped into fighting positions surrounding us. All at the same time Rocket Propelled Grenades, and heavy machine gun fire rained down on us from all sides. I was stunned momentarily. I finally came to as I saw H and N sprinting back to the vehicle for cover. They had a few seconds lead on me. I jumped up, and sprinted back to the truck. I’ve never ran so fast in my life. My chest was on fire, my body crushing under the weight of armor, ammo, and water, and my adrenaline kept me at a dead sprint. I could hear rounds cracking past me. I could see dirt kicking up in front of me, hitting everything but me. I remember being incredibly concerned about being shot in the tooth. I have no idea why that specifically. I continued this sprint for what felt like hours, but was only seconds. I didn’t stop running until I physically impacted the truck, It was the only thing giving us any cover. I reached in for my M4 and saw it was gone. H had taken it, since he left his along with the mortar tube I left my Mk46 when the ambushed kicked off. So I ran to the back of the truck, opened it up and grabbed a SMAW-D rocket launcher. I moved to the front passenger side of the truck using the tire for cover. I found a machine gun position, drew a bead on them, and fired. Silence. Nothing. Misfire. I fired again. Silence. Then a Rocket Propelled Grenade hit the driver side tire, followed by two more. The concussions were deafening. I could no longer hear the gun fire, no more explosions, I could feel the cool breeze from the concussion of the RPG blasts blow past my ankles. It felt nice. I started to hear ringing and the gunfire and explosions came back to me.  I remembered where I was, what the situation was. The situation was fucked and we needed to get the essential weapons we had left in the open. I ran back to the driver door, exposing myself to heavy close machine gun fire, and jumped in, slamming the door as fast as humanly possible. I crept along acting as a moving barrier for the guys recovering the Mk46, Mortar Tube and rounds, and rifles. We were now back in the fight, when  I heard everyone yelling at T. “Shoot T, fucking shoot them!” they were all shouting, and he just stayed down in the vehicle shouting “I can’t do it! I can’t!’ 


I couldn’t believe it. Six months in country, countless fights, and this is the first time I see someone; one of my peers backing down. I ran to the rear door, grabbed T, and pulled him out of the vehicles gun turret and got behind the 240b machine gun. I had entered a new world. I could hear rounds firing off, and cracking past my head at almost the same time, I could hear them hitting the shield in front of, and the ballistic glass all around me. I could see multiple muzzle flashes from multiple positions. I let a 200 round burst go into the village, spraying hundreds of 7.62mm rounds into the windows. Normally you would never do that large of a burst of gunfire, it is almost impossible to accurately fire and is a waste of rounds. But these were the circumstances. We lost the first step in winning an ambush; gain fire superiority. Without the Mk46, 60mm Mortar tube, and T not shooting from the vehicle we had nothing but rifle fire and some grenades until then. Also a basic tactic is to mass your weapons on the most casualty producing weapon on the battlefield. On our battlefield, it was our mortar crew and their tube. They had fire superiority, and were massing their firepower on our position. I had to let out 200 rounds, I had to let them know we were in the fight and there to win it. 


I dropped back down and yelled at T to prep cans of ammo for me.  240b cases can be a pain in the ass if not prepped because the canister has two 100 round belts in separate boxes. They have to be removed from their separate boxes, linked together, and then you are ready to go. It doesn’t sound like much until you are outnumbered almost 150 to 25, and are losing. That’s when it becomes a seconds game and every second counts. I saw SGT D standing over T, my M4 jammed under his vest, into his ribs. He was screaming at T for his cowardice. Asking him why he shouldn’t kill him. I didn’t care. In those moments, T valued his life over ours, and he showed it, when we were all willing to die for each other.  I shook my head, grabbed another can of ammo, and stood up to reload. I saw SGT D step out with a LAW rocket and fire at a nearby enemy position.


That’s when the call came in over the radio. We had taken a casualty at our overwatch position. One of the snipers had taken a AK47 round through his shoulder. They were blowing claymores to stop the Taliban advance on their position. I We could not get to them, and they were completely pinned down by accurate and heavy machine gun and rocket fire. Standing up would have been a death sentence.  They had to wait, and we had to wait until we could beat back the overwhelming Taliban force until a Blackhawk could come in and a medic could hoist him out of there. We stood our ground and fought for over two hours.  Every time I would stand in the turret to reload I would brace for a round to hit me in the face at any moment.  The constant sound of rounds cracking past my head,  heavy machine guns firing, a constant barrage of mortar and artillery fire, and an aerial bombardment made a deafening indescribable sound. I remember at one point taking a breather, and making peace with the fact that I would die defending that position that day. Then I got right back up and into the fight. By the end of the fight I personally fired over 8,000 rounds at the enemy.


Rounds were cracking by, hundreds of them, I could hear them all. There were 155mm Howitzer shells coming in from four different positions now for us, two 120mm Mortars nearby, and our 60mm was hanging rounds. The explosions were constant and deafening . Reloading the 240 seemed impossible. I had so much adrenaline, and fear, and hate coursing through me that my hands were trembling. I opened the latch, and was able to sweep out the links and casings but I fumbled with the new belt. My hands were shaking furiously. I tried to calm down and control my breathing. Precious seconds tick by, as dozens, possibly hundreds of rounds crack past me, as I am standing and exposing my entire upper body fumbling with this ammo. Finally I get the rounds in place, and start doing 7-10 round bursts between 5 different houses we were taking fire from.  That’s when I saw them; moving between the buildings. Two armed fighters with AK47’s, and at that moment two women and two kids ran out of a door into the same alley within feet of the enemy. As I said before, this was a world where seconds meant the difference between flying home with your friends, and getting flown home in a box. I had rounds firing all around me, one began to raise his weapon at me, and I let two 10 round bursts go. They all dropped; my only regret from 12 months of fighting. I never once had a second thought or a feeling of guilt when I shot anyone that meant to do me, or those protecting me harm. I don’t care if they were pulling a trigger or using a radio giving away our movements. When they chose sides that was their decision. It took me a while to come to terms with the women and kids. I didn’t tell a single person about it for almost two years. I carried it with me, an invisible mark of shame. I can look at it in different perspectives now that help ease the guilt, but I will always see them. I still hear the gun fire every night. I hear the distant crash of artillery, and the sound of steel exploding, and a hail of machine gun fire every night as I lay there waiting for sleep too come."	t5_2qtr8	True

WILLingtonegotiate	83	22	32	"On July 6, 2003 I was in a convoy that was ambushed in the market of Abu Ghraib (a small town just west of Baghdad). The vehicle infront of me was being peppered by 7.62 rounds from a Jordanian foreign insurgent, and I returned direct fire with my m4. 

During majorcombat operations I used plenty of suppressive fire, and since I was an forward observer I used artillery to kill on a large scale, but this was the first day I placed my sights center mass of a man. It felt mechanical, cold, and surprisingly easy. I squeezed of my first round which struck the front left of his shoulder, the second trigger squeeze sent a round steaming into his chest, just under is right pectoral muscle. As he dropped I sent about 15 more rounds down range tohis crumpled body, striking him 8 more times. 

The driver of the vehicle in front of me was hit twice, one round through each arm. I like to think I saved his life by killing the man who was attempting to kill him, but in my sleep I only see his body falling to the ground with no memories of the reasoning behind it.

I do not regret this act, and I think I would do it again without thought, but that does not change how I felt about it. Upon searching his body afterwards I remember seeing his face and thinking, ""Damn you, you fool."" Well anyway, happy 4th."	t5_2qtr8	True

Alls well I have my inprocessing done and everything, told yesterday ""be here tomorrow in full winter PTs at 620 for PT"", ""no problem sergeant"". I get all my shit together, arrange a ride with another guy in my platoon who has a car and whos sorta kinda my sponsor (never actually assigned one, hes just sorta taken over the role and has helped me and the two guys who came with me a shit ton). Blahblahblah I go to bed and set my alarm and whatnot. Wake up today at 430 (commute is a madcunt so we leave at 520), I get out of bed, throw on a pair of pt pants and go into the common area shared by me and the guy next door to go pee. Before I go further a little bit about my current barracks, Its a one room bedroom sorta thing, 10x14 feet and I share a common area seperated from my room with a door that has one of them 'push in the button' on the handle locks. The common room has no outside access, windows or otherwise, the only way in or out is through the rooms. Okay back to my story. So I finish peeing and go to go back into my room and finish getting ready and what not. I grab the handle to my door and twist, nothing happens. Shits broke and the door is now locked shut. No big deal I figure I'll wake up my neighbor and go through his room outside then into mine through the window I cracked last night. I knock, nothing again so I knock harder. He's not there -_-  I spend the next HOUR AND A HALF sitting in that tiny ass room panicking because I'm gonna be late to PT on my first fucking day in the real army. I can hear my phone ringing in my bedroom, my battle-buddies calling wondering where the fuck I am. FINALLY my sponsor comes banging on my door outside thinking I've slept in. I bang back and yell to him whats happened. He calls up CQ who calls staff duty to come release me from my prison. Made it to work with minutes to spare lol. Also later on I hit myself in the balls when I hit the release button on a spring loaded bipod on the bottom of a gangsta-grip on an M4 during weapons familiarization. FML

1375546350.0	1jmqe0	A long-winded rant/vent session regarding the current counseling environment (IMHO)	SlinkyJoe	50	1	44	"I have a Soldier who runs to the nearest CSM everytime she is counseled. It's happened multiple times. The CSM hands her a ""get out of jail free"" card everytime and backs her. He calls my NCOIC into his office and proceeds to bash him and pick apart every counseling statement or email like a lawyer. He ***always*** backs our worst Soldiers. She's wrong. Everyone in my shop knows it. She's a terrible NCO. Totally unreliable. Lazy. Despised by her subordinates. She'll put more effort into trying to find ways ***out*** of work than it would take to just do her job. We're coming up on the end of a tour. My NCOIC and I sat down and wrote her NCOER. It's not even bad. He's been in a while and so have I and we both grew up in a different Army. Even just 5-6 years ago to me it seems like it was a much different Army. We both grew up in a system that was not anywhere near as insane about documenting everything as today's Army. I've never had a group of Soldiers in my Company/Battalion/Unit that were such a bunch of barracks lawyers. As a result, we're SOL properly assessing this Soldier and here's why: 

It's gotten to the point now that we've been discouraged so much from counseling poor/non-performers (as have many others in this Unit) that we stopped doing it. We had to. Every negative counseling was picked to shreds by the CSM/BC (until the CSM got booted out of theater - then she simply went to the next higher CSM - it's her M.O.). After enough times we both stopped doing it. It wasn't worth the ass pain we'd have to put up with, and she was being protected. So we get to her NCOER. My NCOIC gives her successes - we just don't have enough written counselings to support anything lower - every time we tried they were shot down. I gave her overall 3's. She says she's going to appeal (it's not even signed/refused to sign yet). By regulation, straight out of 623-3, overall 3's represent an overall ""good"" rating. Since when does every NCO get 2's guaranteed to them? When did 2's become average, and 3's become poor? I digrees - anyway, so then she proceeds to print out every email and counseling she's received so far during the tour, walks over to the 1SG's office, tells her she's going to BDE to talk to the CSM (open door policy), and leaves. Not a word to anyone else in her chain. BDE CSM calls my NCOIC up to his office and proceeds to pick apart his emails and counselings. ""You didn't explain in enough detail how to do this task"", ""you said *this word* when you shoud have said *that word*"", ""you can't negatively counsel if you didn't provide retraining (on an MOS task)"", ""She has the right to request formal counseling on assigned tasks - you have to provide it"". He gives her yet another get out of jail free card. She's going to ride yet again and we're going to have to roll over and give a shit NCO a free pass.

WHAT DOES THIS ACCOMPLISH? HOW DOES THIS HELP THE ARMY? WHY WOULD A SENIOR NON-COM THROW ANOTHER SENIOR NON-COM UNDER THE BUS FOR A CRAP NCO? He even said ""good Soldiers don't come by to see me about this stuff. Only poor performers come through trying to find loopholes"". He ***knows*** she's trying to get over, and he ***still backs her***. What good does this do anyone? You're just poisoning the NCO corps!

So we're rolling over. She gets a free ride and some other Unit will inevitably pick her up where she'll do it all over again. We had two negative counseling statements lined up for failing to accomplish a task and for showing up late to work before she ran to BDE to cry to the CSM. Now they're toilet paper, because if we give them to her she'll cry ""reprisal"" and that'll be the end of that.

This is happening because of two reasons, as I see it:

1. We have been discouraged from counseling Soldiers negatively. All they have to do is run to mommy or daddy and they don't have to be held accountable for their actions. Mommy said no? Daddy too? Run to grandpa. Sooner or later someone in the chain is going to find fault and blame the leadership. ""Coach, counsel, develop"", they'll say. And we'll lose the backing of higher. The Boss will get a phone call. He'll tell me in his best lawyer-speak to let it go. And it'll slide.

2. As a result of #1 up there we'll get to the NCOER and there won't be enough negative counselings to give anything less than a 2/2. The NCO will get promoted. The vicious cycle will continue.

Some people will say they're right. But its getting to the point now where you have to pass the bar exam to write a counseling statement. One wrong word, one misspelling, one phrase that ""comes across the wrong way"" and you're toast. You can't give constructive criticism to Soldiers if they don't want to hear it, and when it comes time to evaluate no one is around to back your assessment of the Soldier's potential. It's like everyone gets a participation medal or something. 
This compounds the issue that the word of leadership no longer counts for crap. Verbal counselings don't exist. They are meaningless. If you don't spend all day documenting the shortcomings of poor performers, vetting them through legal, then trying to explaining them to senior leadership while they shit all over you, then the Soldier gets away with murder. My current problem child is at the point now where ***every single task*** she is assigned requires a step-by-step instructional counseling statement outlining what her duty entails in perfect detail. If one item is missed, or the job changes at all, you have to write a new statement or else she won't be held accountable.

Whatever happened to the days of the verbal order? The days when a Soldier was told to do a task, and they ***fucking executed***. Or if they were confused or didn't understand something they would either a. figure it out or b. ASK. What happened to the days when chain of command meant something? When skipping said chain got you an ass chewing? When senior leaders were allowed to lead? To assess? To supervise? To delegate tasks to subordinates without having to spoon-feed them? I'm handcuffed by the System. I can't counsel, and I can't properly assess without counseling. It's lose-lose.

Maybe it's just this unit. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. But I've never seen anything like it before. And most every leader/senior leader in my vicinity is complaining about the same issue. We've been ham-stringed by regulation and a series of higher leaders who refuse to back their subordinate leadership if a Soldier wants to complain about having to do her damn job. 

Anyways this issue has had me fuming all day and I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm sure lots of you have dealt with problem Soldiers before - hell, I've dealt with plenty. But I've never had seen such a mess of red tape lined up to counsel and assess them before. I'm sure I've had missteps. Nobody is perfect. I just don't feel like today's Army has my back when it comes to dealing with Soldiers who just want to work the system to their advantage. Bah. I digress.

tl;dr: It seems to me more and more everyday - leadership is not being backed on counseling/NCOERs. You can't counsel without being a lawyer, and you can't effectively assess without having the (bulletproof) counselings. It's lose-lose.

I know many people are in airborne, running your 8 miles with you 70 lb ruck on, and doing tons of shit on the side.  Remember to take care of your back and knees, especially if you're a cockstrong young buck still trying to out work everyone else.  I'm 28 with the knees and back of a 50 something and some days I feel like I can barely walk.  If you hurt yourself, get it on your medical records so you can take care of it later on in life.   Ignore those guys who think going to sick call once in 2 years is malingering.   By the time you ETS it's going to be way too late.

Nothing big, nothing life changing, just take care of your bodies, because you won't always be 21 and in the best shape of your life.  I didn't do it and I'd hate to see anyone make the same mistakes I did.  "	t5_2qtr8	True

Post your questions, I've got answers.	auraness	35	4	96	"I've been getting a lot of questions through PMs since [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1jh1sh/steps_to_be_an_army_officer/), and I thought I might as well share with the public since there's a lot of interest. 

First of all, I'm only the subject matter expert on the ROTC route. I can talk to you about other programs like OCS or HSPS, but you can probably find better sources on Google.

ROTC is a program designed to commission officers in the United States military. Although designed to take 4 years, it can be done in 2 or 3 years based on a case to case scenario. The reason for this is because the US military requires a bachelor's degree to commission, meaning that your time of commissioning has to match your degree plan for college (some exceptions, such as if you already have a bachelors and are going for a masters).

For the 3 year program, it's called compression, and allows the Cadet to take both the MS I (military science level I) and the MS II year simultaneously. Very minimal paperwork is required for this option. 

For a 2 year program, a new Cadet needs to attend a month long camp at Ft. Knox called LTC (leadership training course) designed to cram 2 years of information into 4 weeks. The second way to qualify for the two year program is if you have prior enlisted service. Slots are limited for LTC so if you are interested, you need to contact your school's ROO (Recruiting and Operations Officer) ASAP.

That being said, if you are an incoming freshman, you can only enroll in the 4-year option (unless you're an engineer, there's a 5-year plan for you guys), if you are an incoming sophomore, you can only enroll in the 3-year option, and if you're an incoming junior, there's no way to participate in ROTC unless you can get a slot to LTC, or have prior military service. There is an exception if you plan on going to grad school, and I will go into it if someone asks.

Now, while you're part of the program, ROTC is very much like taking a minor. The lifestyle is very relaxed and you are only expected to wear ACUs to your military science classes, which, including lab, is between 4-7 hours of the week. PT is 3 days a week, typically Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and you show up to those sessions in your PT uniform. Outside of those commitments, you're free to live your life as a normal college student.

Going into the financial aspect of ROTC. First, you have to understand that there are 3 tiers of participation in ROTC. From the lowest up, you have participating Cadets, enrolled Cadets, and contracted Cadets. Participating means you're just taking the MS lecture, and perhaps the PT class. There's no paperwork, and you have not agreed to serve in the Army. A participating Cadet will not be able to attend labs or FTXs. An enrolled Cadet is someone who is taking the MS lecture, PT class, as well as signed up for the lab. There is more paperwork to clear you to attend labs, but other than that, there's no distinguishable difference from a participating Cadet.

Contracted Cadets, on the other hand, have agreed to a service obligation to the Army and have thus completed paperwork necessary for that to happen (clearing you medically, background check for security clearance, ect). All contracted Cadets draw a stipend and book money. Stipend starts at $300 a month for an MS I Cadet, and increases to $500 a month for an MS IV. Once you've contracted with ROTC, you can also compete for a scholarship. This is an important point to understand: Although scholarships are competitive, you do not have to have a scholarship to commission through ROTC. 

The scholarships through the schools are generally 3-year or 2-year scholarships, where as the national scholarships are all 4-year scholarships. Scholarships cover either tuition or room and board. Typically, Cadets opt for the tuition option and then use their stipend money to pay for room and board (I did the opposite when I was a Cadet because I had Tuition Assistance money).

I think that's enough information to get us started. I'll answer all questions posted here, though it might take me up to 24 hours to get back to you. If you're not here to ask questions, but just want to jump into ROTC, PM me and I'll help get the paperwork started for you and put you in contact with a ROO."	t5_2qtr8	True

I'm going to do my best to answer the most commonly asked questions and I invite my fellow medics to add to this FAQ to their heart's content. I especially welcome input from the newer medics in regards to the training practices.

----------------------------------

* **What do 68W's do?**

Medics, in conjunction with other medical MOS's, are responsible for force preservation both on and off the battlefield. As a healthcare specialist, you will examine and treat patients under the license of a higher practitioner such as a Physician's Assistant or Doctor. As a combat medic you will be deployed with your fellow Soldiers and potentially providing emergency care in combat. These two jobs are both under the purview of the 68W and you will be expected to be proficient in either role as the situation warrants.

-----------------------------------

* **What kind of training will I undergo?**

After you have graduated BCT you will be sent to Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio, Texas. Ft. Sam is now a Joint Service School, providing the medical training for all branches. Army 68W AIT is approximately 16-18 weeks long depending on when you go. The first half of AIT is the EMT course, where you will gain national certification as an Emergency Medical Technician-Basic, provided you pass the NREMT certification test. Failure to pass after a certain number of attempts will result in being removed from the rest of the course and processed for reclassification to another MOS. Once you have finished the EMT course, the rest of AIT is comprised of combat medicine training, consisting of things such as combat casualty care, advanced airways, basic pharmacology, trauma management, and the like.

This portion of your training culminates in a two-week Field Training Exercise (FTX) at Camp Bullis, where you will receive refresher combat training and learn some new concepts related to providing care on the battlefield, which you will then get to put to the test in simulated combat operations.

----------------------------------------

* **Alright, HeyPrivate, you've told us about the training, what about downtime?**

This is where your mileage may really vary, and I'm going to ask for input from the newer medics as to the current practices. But when I went through at the end of 2009, we had plenty of time to ourselves. Once you were done with class for the day, you were released to do your own thing, as long as you didn't leave the company area. On weekends, if your company was given an off-post pass, you could travel off Fort Sam to do whatever it is you felt like doing. If it was an on-post pass, you couldn't leave the base, but you could travel freely (more or less) on the base itself to do things like go to the Main Exchange or the Shoppette. Smoking was allowed in designated areas, and drinking was allowed as long as you were of legal age (21) and only while on a pass. Recently I've heard these are no longer allowed; I'll let someone else fill that in.

-------------------------------------

* **This sounds easy! But is there anything I can do to get a head start?**

Sure. If you currently hold an NREMT certification, you can challenge the EMT course, and if you make it, you will be fast-tracked into a company that is starting the Whiskey (combat medical) training.
If you don't want to do that, find and study some EMT study guides and NREMT practice tests. Learn some basic medical terminology and anatomy. There's plenty of free resources available.

-------------------------------------

* **Ok, so what happens after I graduate?**

Once again, your mileage may vary. If you are Guard or Reserves, you probably already know where you'll be going and what to expect. You Active Duty types will receive orders to your first duty station at some point near the end of your training. The vast majority of medics end up in combat units, with the rest going to support units such as a Combat Support Hospital or medical units. You may be deployed right away, or you may never deploy; such is the way of the Army.

-----------------------------------------------

* **I have a question that you somehow managed not to answer in that long-winded tirade!**

You're a big boy or girl now, just ask. Somebody will have the answer. Just please keep this thread related to the 68W MOS.

-----------------------------------------------

That's it for now. As always, kids, a recruiter is the best place to start for general questions and more specific information.
------------------------
-------------------------------------

EDIT 1:

According to [this post here](http://redd.it/1ffkvi) TRADOC policy now prohibits overnight passes and alcohol consumption, among other things. So be ready to deal with that.

------------------------------------

EDIT 2:

I can't believe I forgot to include this the first time. Yes, there are females in 68W AIT. Yes, there are usually a lot. **DO NOT FUCK, FALL IN LOVE WITH OR MARRY THESE FEMALES. JUST DON'T DO IT. I HEAR YOU THINKING ABOUT IT. YES, EVEN YOU. DON'T DO IT. THEY ARE TRIFLING BITCHES.**

**THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO LADIES.** 

Seriously, people, AIT is not the place for that shit. Find somebody not in the military if you must, but there are plenty of sex shops in San Antonio and your PSG will be much less pissed if he/she finds a fleshlight/vibrator in your locker than if you come down with the down-below-drips.

--------------------------------------

EDIT 3: I Found an old post I wrote about Bullis so you get a bonus.

&gt;It's either going to be cold as fuck or hot as hell. There is no middle ground. When I went through it was January and therefore cold as fuck. We were in hemi-tents with heaters that worked maybe twice a week. We were there for two weeks. There's no tobacco or anything but water allowed. Of course that didn't stop anybody. There was a civilian service that did our laundry at the end of the first week. They take it off site and bring it back within a day or two.

&gt;Each platoon cycled through the training lanes because there weren't that many instructors. The instructors out there are cool as shit but don't fuck up or they'll make you regret it. You'll basically be relearning room clearance, CQB, and of course all the medic shit like TC3. It will all be simulated with blank rounds and pyro and all that other fun shit (not for us though, we had a ""supply shortage""). The most memorable part for me was being forced to stay up for 36 hours then being put through a combat stress run in the BAS. You'll be doing lots of marching, running, dragging, and all that other fun shit so make sure you're in shape. Chow was MREs except for dinner, which was hot As.

&gt;Each platoon cycled through platoon leaders, unless you were hot shit, in which case you were left in charge for the duration. That was fun but also kind of stressful because at Bullis the PL actually will have to make leadership decisions.

&gt;The second week is ""War Days"" and you'll just have to find out about that for yourself.

I promised my fiancee that I would spend the night with her tonight so I could meet her family tomorrow morning and take her ring shopping tomorrow night. And for those that think I don’t know her well enough to get married, she said her dad married her mom after only knowing her for a few hours and they been married for over 30 years.

 First, and most important: **Don't disregard these tips because you know you are only going to do one enlistment and get out.** I knew I was getting out 13 years ago and ended up staying in.

**Skill level 1 (PVT-CPL (SPC)**: Get some college. College won't do a lot for you know, but you will wish you had started sooner when you have been in for awhile.

 Do those schools that are offered to you. It doesn't matter if it is Ranger school, Airborne school, Air Assault, or First Aid. You want to get the schools done as early in your career as you can so you can get more done later if needed. 

This applies throughout your career, don't look for a TDA to follow a TDA or look for a TOE to follow a TOE. I understand that at SL1 you may not have a lot of command over your next assignment, and I will give some final suggestions, but if you start in a clinic, hospital, or office job, try to get into a deployable position. 

**Skill Level 2:** You need a leadership position. Squad leader, Team leader, something on your ERB that shows you are in a leadership position. You are enrolled in college, right? If you cannot get a leadership position, make sure you can demonstrate on your NCO-ER that you are remaining technically proficient. Did you conduct training? Did you create a training model?

Get those schools that you didn't get to do when you were skill level 1. Again, Airborne, Pathfinder, or advanced or specialized training in your MOS or CMF. 

You can volunteer for special duty, but in most CMF, you won't have much luck getting them. 

**Skill Level 3:** At this point you should not have to worry about college. You should at least have your Associate's Degree. Continue to work toward your Bachelor's Degree. Ideally, your degree will reflect your MOS. If not, a degree will assist you later in your career. You should also consider volunteering for a special duty assignment. (Recruiter, Drill Sergeant, Instructor, something of that sort.) 

Let's say you have made it to this point in your career and you have been in TDA assignments for your entire career and you can't seem to break the cycle. Go to boards. I don't mean the NCO of the Quarter Board. I mean the NCO of the Year Board. Audie Murphy Board, SGT. Morales Board, MACOM NCO of the Year Board, are all ways to overcome the lack of TOE assignments. You should be working to achieving EFMB or EIB if that is available to you. 

**Skill Level 4:** You should have at least an Associate's Degree. You should have your Bachelor's Degree if you can't show a lot of deployment time. If you can still get a special duty and you have not had one before, you need to try to get an assignment as an instructor. You need to get leadership time. Platoon or Detachment NCO would be best. Section NCOIC would be acceptable. 

**Skill Level 5:** If you get a 1SG position offered, you need to take it. You won't make CSM if you have not been a 1SG. Get your Bachelor's degree. 

**Tips throughout your career.** Keep in mind that branch knows what is best for you. If branch is telling you to take an assignment, talk to your leadership about why that is being offered. If you get a special duty assignment, don't run from it. That special duty will help you later in your career. Try to balance TDA and TO&amp;E.

Let me start by saying that I've never fully understood the policy against keeping pets overseas.  I've played with a few puppies and cats that lived on our base while deployed, and I've never really given the policy much thought.  Recently, however, I think that I finally figured out the *why* behind the policy. 

I've had the opportunity to work with a few Army Medical folks (Doctor-types), who were making a big deal over Soldiers who keep pets while deployed.  Specifically, this article, originally a reddit post, has been making a few rounds in the Medical Community: http://nation.foxnews.com/military/2013/02/06/soldier-takes-nap-adopted-cat-kuwait So, I asked the doctor types to explain it to me.

The big fuss is over rabies, obviously. But here's the thing, just how serious is rabies? Don't we have shots that can prevent it?  Well, yes we have shots, but thats not the issue.  An untreated rabies bite can turn into a case of Clinical Rabies.  How serious is that?  Well, according the the CDC, less than 10 people have survived Clinical Rabies.  Not 10 people this year, 10 people *ever.* 
**Source 1:** http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/symptoms/index.html

Granted, a Soldier that is bitten by a rabid dog could receive proper treatment to prevent clinical rabies, but another concern is that the Soldier will not seek help if they are bitten.  Unfortunately, the Army has a complex dynamic, where those who seek help are thought of as weak, as in the case of the stigma associated with mental health treatment.  As a result, many do not seek help when they may need it.

Case in point, in 2011, a Specialist from the 10th Mountain died as a result of Rabies contracted overseas after he was bitten while breaking up a fight between his dog and a rabid dog. **Source 2:** http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6117a2.htm  and **Source 3:** http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2139198/Pfc-Kevin-Shumaker-CDC-warns-deployed-troops-rabies-danger-soldier-dies-months-dog-bite-Afghanistan.html#axzz2KmMCQxBe 

I know that I'm not going to prevent anyone from keeping pets overseas, but I just want to let you know the *why* behind the policy.  We're all adults, so we can make our own decisions.


Rabies is pretty serious and can be transmitted via bite or saliva.  If you do come into contact with either, inform your Chain of Command and the medics.  Its better to err on the side of caution.

* Have someone other than your sponsor look over your uniform before you go into the board. Your sponsor has seen your uniform a few times and knows what fixes he suggests. Get another NCO to look at your uniform to find the things your sponsor doesn't see. 

*  Listen to the questions asked. You may not think you know the answer, but with a second or two of thought, you can come up with an answer. I asked a Soldier tonight what is the first thing you would do when you come across a casualty with no pulse, and he had no answer. He wanted the study guide answer, but I wanted the fast answer of call 911. 

* Be confident. Hell, you can miss every question I ask, but if you answer confident, I will give you more points than if you look at your hands and say, I don't know at this time, Sergeant. 

* Be loud. Everything you do in the Army can be loud. When you do facing movements, I want to hear your shoes click. I want to have to hear your responses without having to listen closely. 

* Do what you are asked to do. You can do it. The president of the board tonight asked the participants to sing the NCO Creed. No one took the challenge. 

Any other suggestions would be welcome. I am posting this to show that winning a board can be easy. Especially a company level board. "	t5_2qtr8	True

A lot of things went into the decision making process, but there were a few things that weighed heavily on my decision that I think some people should consider when the time comes to make the decision (note: This is probably going to weigh more towards those in their first contract as I can relate).

After I re-up'ed a lot of the fresh privates looked at me like I was nuts,but I can see why. When you first start out in the military, like any job, it can be tough and you're just learning the ropes each day at a time. I don't think a lot of those guys got that. They go through the moaning and groaning of having to do the same routine each day, and then have curveballs thrown at them every chance they get. It's the *negative* things the focus on instead of the positive. You're getting a ""reliable"" pay check, you're getting a place to live (ie barracks, on-post housing, BAH) and all those other great things the recruiter told you. 

But what it boiled down to was if I really enjoyed my job or not. I'm a Scout; my job sucks, but i've had more opportunities given to me in the military than I could see myself getting in po-dunk Ohio town. When I came here, I was that FNG who was getting dropped every second for breathing wrong. I got physically injured a few times, nothing I could control, but I recovered and kept going. 2 years later, i'm a team leader, i'm a Raven operator, I still jump out of airplanes, and i'm going to the promotion board next month.

I didn't want to post this to feel like I was boasting, but convey to a *lot* of the younger guys out there, and maybe even some of our leadership, that when the decision comes for you to decide if you want to continue your career in the military, look at the WHOLE picture. If you plan on getting out, *have a plan for the civilian world*. I know a few guys who celebrated a year from their ETS date all the way until they hung up their boots, stepped outside of the gates, and then just went ""Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do now"".

So I was going to settle for being a cop, but the benefits of the Army seem to outweight the cons. The E-4, and college loan repayment (i have $60k in student loan debt), and guaranteed job benefits sound great.

Will I really be able to join as an E-4? I'm considering a few jobs. I'd like to try CID, but the goarmy site lists it as entry level, but about.com says I'd need two years as an MP before I can do CID. Is that true? Also thinking about intelligence, and I like photography so maybe something related to that.

Is it at all likely that I could get a two year active duty enlistment? I don't mind signing up for more, but if there's a chance, I'd like to try for two years, and if I like it I'd go for more.

Is MP really as bad as everyone says? Will I have issues with my age? I'm also not exactly fit, but I'm working on it, I can do 35 pushups, and I'm going to start running. I'm 5'11"", 170 lbs.

I'm in the Army. I'm an E-4 and I've been with my current unit for almost 3 years. I went on leave in the last week of May.

Before I left, I was told that I had a class scheduled for the 12th of June, during my scheduled leave, and that I needed to submit a 4187 in order to be put in the class in July. Mind you, this is after my leave had already been approved. I got with the schools NCO, submitted my 4187 and was told it was taken care of and I didn't have anything to worry about.

Yesterday, I got a call from my platoon sergeant. He told me to call him back ASAP and so I did because I'm a stupid motherfucker. He informed me that my class reschedule had not been approved and that I needed to get back to post immediately because I could not miss the class. He told me that if its on my ATTRS, I cannot miss it and that the CSM is tracking so I'd better get back. All the while that I'm on the phone with him, 1SG is yelling in the background that I'd better ""get (my) ass back here"".  I talked to my first line and he wasn't tracking anything. He said he would call but then said he never got through to our platoon sergeant. 

The class is a half-day recertification class that happens several times a month. I'm on leave with family that I won't see again until after deployment and a wedding that I took leave to be here for hasn't even happened yet. My leave was approved weeks before I left. 

My return tickets are already bought and paid for and I cannot afford to pay for different ones or to have it rescheduled.

What can I do? What can I expect my punishment to be if I don't go back for this class?

EDIT:

Platoon sergeant called back today and asked me what I was doing.  I told him that I don't have the money for a ticket right now to which he replied, ""good answer.""  He said he was fighting command on this and that I had no idea what he was doing for me.  I got him an itinerary showing how expensive the ticket was and he called back saying, ""Don't worry about it.  Enjoy your leave.  You owe me.""  

This should be fun.

Its not the work that gets me, its my whole troop (company). First of all I am a mortarman and love my MOS but I am with a cavalry scout battalion. I have no issues with scouts and don't feed into the feud that is just stupid in my opinion. Well a few months before we deployed the CoC split up our small mortar platoon and integrated it within the 3 scout platoons. I was ecstatic because that meant that I would most likely be dismounted and not have to worry about the truck. Well that was not the case. I have effectively been turned into something that I have never trained for. I am not the only one discouraged about this change as my section sergeant eventually moved over to headquarters because he feels that the work he put into the platoon was completely negated. I find myself with a new section sergeant who is a complete opposite from my last. I am constantly put on extra details and belittled on the regular (side note: I am not a bad soldier as I do what I am told when I am told and have a good attitude). So my new section sergeant sees me as a piece of shit private who doesn't know anything. I am still new to the army (1 year) and I wasn't taught much by previous NCOs. Not because they didn't care but because the troop required so many mindless tasks to be fulfilled rather than quality training. Now I find myself totally unprepared in a hostile country with nobody on my side. I don't know what to do because I feel trapped with no way out. I want to talk to somebody but there is nothing anybody can do. I've already tried talking to my first line but that didn't resolve anything.

And that would be the **free** 4,500 a year that the Army gives for going to college. I've been in for five years and I'm just now starting to take my education seriously, which is a shame because I might have had or been close to having my bachelors by now. I'll try to break it down a bit:

You need approx. 20 classes to earn an associates degree. If you start when the Army gives you your 4,500 (start of the FY, October), and take just two classes a semester, you can have your degree in just shy of 2.5 years. That's including taking April through August off. (I'm using the prices for my school, UMUC, which would be higher than a local community college. If your tuition is lower, the quicker you can get your degree).

Seriously. Instead of getting drunk every weekend, take a few classes. See if your unit has any incentives for doing so. You may think that you won't be able to take classes in person because they are during the duty day. Well, you'll never know if you don't ask.

My girlfriend is starting college this year and I'm doing a 4 year contract. I have only had shitty part time jobs and as I'm sitting here in the hotel, the fact that I'm going to be on my own and suddenly jump into supporting myself has hit me like a ton of bricks. 

Honestly? I'm scared as hell. I've never been on my own outside of home, and the unknown is only making me worse. I have no choice but to do this, and I know I'll get through it, but I'm afraid I'm going to screw up in some way, or that I'm going to be the weak one. I know I'm bitching, but I'd like to talk to someone anonymously and get it off my chest before I ship.

1. Don't ever say can't or won't. That is the quickest way to get sent home. You can, or else the Drill Sergeant would not have you do it. You will if you ever want to wear the uniform.

2. Don't spend all your money on the stupid s**t the vendors try t  sell you. Many people come in and this is their first time to have money in their pocket. You want to come out of BCT with a few dollars to your name. The Drill Sergeants may say you won't be released until someone buys from the vendor, let the other guys buy the class ring, the engraved diploma, the coffee mugs, the whatever. You can get this stuff at a better price when you get to AIT.

3. Buy the unit T-shirt. Seems to contradict the above, but you will have days later in your career where you get to wear your BCT T-shirt, and you really want to have something to remember your class by. Hell, buy two and have your class sign one. They don't cost much. 

4. Write home. It doesn't matter if you have anyone who reads your letters. What is important is that you remember that you have someone to write to. It also helps you see that it ain't that bad. When you put it down in words, you see that you made it through. 

5. When you do call home, tell your people how much you have done
and not what sucks. They will worry more if you stress the negatives, and you will focus more on the suck factor if you make that a point of your calls.  

This is all I got for now. I invite Senior NCO's and those who recently completed BCT to add on."	t5_2qtr8	True

I'm thinking of volunteering for our sister brigades deployment in early 2014, but as I'm having a baby next month I'm not sure what I really want to do, but I do want to deploy.

As a Combat Engineer one of the things that is ingrained in us from Day 1 at Leonard Wood is that Combat Engineers lead the way, doing some of the most dangerous work in the Army such as breaching mine fields, emplaced obstacles and fortifications.  Not to mention our new mission as route clearance.

The other day while on KP, for the first time in the Army, I really got frustrated with demonstrated elitism from another soldier.  This guy was an 11C and kept calling everybody Pogues.  Yes, I know he and other Infantry are just as indoctrinated into their regimental mindset as us engineers are, but I couldn't help but be somewhat offended.  Here was this virgin, slick sleeve like myself going out of his way to demean other soldiers, most of whom were also combat arms.  We were a collection of Calvary Scouts, Tankers, Combat Engineers and Infantry.

His outward elitism and unwillingness to work with us was a real morale killer and ended up costing us over an hour in final cleanup because he kept saying stuff like, ""Let the pogues do the mopping"", etc.

I've not had a lot of encounters with a lot of infantry in my brigade as my BSTB battalion is comprised of HHC, Signal, Military Intelligence and Engineers.  I guess I wonder if this elitist attitude and outward lack of care for accomplishing the mission is the rule or the norm for 11 series?  Do you combat veterans have a more macroscopic view of how the army works as a whole than virgin privates do?

I'm a lieutenant in a company that has extremely low morale. I know that's normal in Korea, but it's gotten worse in the past week.

Minus details, we have a problem with things like curfew violations. Higher response is to hold mass formations tell the Soldiers that they're bad and they should feel bad. NCOs want more things like barracks inspections/formations/marching everywhere like in AIT/written counselings over verbal correction. I'm ok with whatever the NCOs want to do, but!

I'm worried because: (1) daily open ranks inspections aren't going to make the soldiers less bored and lonely, or give them anything that isn't ""risky"" to do after 2200 on the weekends; (2) now my soldiers have it in their heads they're in the fuckup unit, and I assume they'll act like it. The *best case* scenario is that they get all motivated and disciplined on the surface but actually hate life and the unit and their jobs, while the worst case is that they stop caring and the 99.3% of the soldiers who aren't problems, become problems.

My AFQT is a 92 I was hoping for Avionics Mechanic. At the MEPS when my clearance was denied I was a little crushed and afraid I would be a truck driver or bb counter but amongst all of those MOS there was 1 single spot open for 12 D, Engineer Diver, and I jumped on it. I've been surfing for about 14 years and am a strong swimmer but I have zero scuba experience. So now for some questions:

The rumors I've been hearing from the recruiter and some online research is that this is one of the smallest MOS in the Army, not much more than 200 total active duty. I'll be doing salvage, demolitions, inspections, SAR, and repairs underwater.

Now for the kicker. Out of BCT I will go to selection at LWOOD where I've been told that by day 2, 80-90% of candidates will quit. Is this selection course expected to be comparable to rangers or SF or is more of an issue that many of these people just didn't prepare/don't know what they are getting themselves into?

I took my 1-1-1 assessment at the recruiter yesterday and did 36 push ups, 36 sit ups (1 minute each) and ran the mile in 7:22 (not my best time, but I took a solid 2 month break from running after a knee and hamstring strain) and after that I did 10 pull ups.

I'm kinda freaking out because I'm usually that squared away, #1 guy anybody goes to when they need something. I never thought I'd do something this stupid and I need some help.

Long story short, I was drinking last night off-post, didn't realize the guy I had switched duty with had backed out last second, and showed up for my hall guard shift at 0000. I ended up falling asleep before the SGT came upstairs for bedcheck. He smelled alcohol on me, we go to the MP station, and got a counseling statement..

I guess I'm just wanting to know the severity of my offense, what punishment I can expect, and what I can do to make it better. The CQ sergeant that I just talked to said Article 15, but past that he doesn't really know.

I have no idea how the injury occurred, except that symptoms presented themselves when training with the ROTC at Ft. Knox.

I was told by my doctors that it was unlikely that I would regain all of my strength/feeling, but it's been 7 months (+ 1 day) since surgery and I've never been in better shape.  Today, my recruiter called to tell me that they approved my waiver and I get to go [back] to MEPS next week.

New faces, new eguipment, new organization. Back when I was in, we were trying two active brigades, and a round out brigade in divisions. That sucked, so we went back to three full brigades. We almost all wore BDU's, carried an M16A2 or M203, the SAW was still a piece of shit that could and did vibrate itself apart as it fired, and the Berrata was replacing the .45 and everyone hated it. Oh, and we still had those fucking green Class A's. 

So what's new, what's still hanging around pissign everyone off, and how the fuck have they reorganized the Army and all it's brigades and regiments? I could never keep up with all the changes. During and after Desert Strom I went from being (all in the same group of men) 5th Infantry DIvision to 2nd Armored Division to 4th Infantry Division within the space of a year. It sort of looks like that is happening now. What's the new Force Org Chart supposed to look like? How are we supposed to fight it?

And the new Blues for class A's. Do you guys like em or hate em? Used to be only the Old Guard bothered wit them, and we were stuck with the shit green Class A's. The blues look sharp to me, and they seem to have some lineage to them, instead of being some badly designed fashion plate.

It looks like I have to go to 11B school.  Even though my Marine Corps MOS of 0321 translated to 11B for the Guard, the ROC said I need to go to Benning for OSUT.  I'm ok with that, but do I need to do *all* of OSUT?  Or just the ""blue phase"" or whatever?  Right now my paperwork has me put down for all of it.

Also, what should I brush up on before I get there?  I'm assuming that as a prior-service guy with my background, I should probably not look like I don't know what I'm doing at any point when I show up.  Pulling out my old RHB is obvious.  A former 11A, now 18A, friend of mine suggested I pick up the Soldiers' Manual of Common Tasks 1 and 2.  Any idea where I can get an official hard copy?

After I got back from MEPS, my recruiters told me I need to start the ""Future Soldiers"" training program they do.  Is this worth my time?  It seems to be tacitly optional.

But holy shit did I have a great time, I was an armed escort for a deploying unit, I never got to work the road because of my hip injury I had gotten in osut. (Quick word of advice to those coming in, It you hurt yourself in training and your drill sgt tells you not to do anything about it because you'll get stuck in training, DO NOT fucking listen. Your injury will only get worse and you'll get fucked over like me.) 
I was on Platoon bitch for awhile when everyone was going through training for the road. My first two platoon sgts didn't even acknowledge my existence. My the third was amazing. She put me through armor school and that's when I got to stay at the company for 24 hours straight to issue weapons to our soldiers on the road and training. I'm only 19 (20 next month) and I know how to fully service 50 cal machine guns, 240Bs, 249s, Mosberg 500s, M4s, M16, and M9s. I've been in charge of over a million dollars in equipment and my first sgt gave me props and thanked me for it. It really sucks because my unit has two deployments for PSD and Law and order, and I missed out on both. All and all it was a great life experience while it lasted.

A little background about me so you know where I stand: I am an MSIII SMP cadet attending a decent public university (BA Economics). I am enlisted in the Guard as an 11B which will be null once I commission. I also plan on serving only my required time (min. 4 years). Who knows, that might change.

I am fairly confident that I will be ranked in the top 10% based on my OML, but I do also realize that that might not happen. 

To give you an idea of where I am on my OML: 3.7 or 3.8 GPA, 280 PT (will max by spring), SMP, some extracurriculars (IM sports) and I'm aiming for an E at camp hopefully with Recondo.

I have three branching options that I have in mind and was wondering if any currently serving officers or retired could offer me any input.

1. Branch AV: Why? Flying would just honestly be kick-ass and exciting. I like adventure and I believe aviation would provide me with that in excess. The downside I see is that I'm not sure how applicable that is after I retire.

2. Branch IN: Why? I have ""some"" experience in this branch and I like the aspects of being a PL of a combat arms branch. The downside is the same as if I branched Aviation.

3. Branch MI and branch detail IN/AR: Why? I believe this would give me the most experience in different fields for the limited time I would be serving. It would also give me great experience to transition into the civilian sector. 

I know ultimately the decision lies with me and that my decision also depends on what I plan to do after I retire. However, all I want to know is your take on these branches and what you would/did choose and why. I did talk to my cadre and many other officers, but I love getting input from as many individuals as possible. 

As to what I'd like to do after I retire, it's either go to medical school or pursue some type of government job. Really opposite ends of the spectrum, but my final decision will depend on my experience in the Army.

Thank you in advance!

I suggested that it would be significantly faster to weight them, but the LT refused. 

So Joe and I started counting when the XO told us that the request was rediculous and to just weight them.... Which we did.

he then told me that a job is a job, and that it's infinitely easier to get a clearance from within the Army, so I should go ahead and enlist in whatever MOS I think I can stand for a year, and then try and reclass. I think that's a poor idea, but wanted to get some advice from you guys.

Took fifteen different correspondence courses through ALMS and ATRRS, every single one of them had problems with launching content, tests, or visual issues with the ""next"" button not being visible. 

Have taken a course on Crater Analysis 17 times because it requires a 100% grade to pass, and it doesn't tell you what you missed. Test involves the old ""drag this thing to this position and if its not PERFECT"" then you fail.

Have completed 8 courses in the last 3 weeks, finished the last one two weeks ago and no change in points. 

Had last record PT test back in March, magically changed last week on my ERB to a test I took a year ago in August. 

Had a flag from last august that was lifted a month later, has been expired for almost a year and Branch, HRC and retention all say it's somebody else that has to lift it, and/or everybody has a different idea of what is supposed to be done to take care of it. (And I'm the one that is driving to Squadron, Regiment and Corps level S-1 and retention back and forth trying to fix it because nobody else is) 

(HRC said they were sorry and deleted the flag, but apparently two systems are supposed to talk to each other and they didn't, so HRC can't delete the flag because they don't have access to the system that its on, and they can't tell me who does or even the NAME of the system)

S-1 went to retention and they said they deleted the flag, should show on Sunday. Promotion Point Worksheet says I'm barred from Reenlistment. Retention looks me up in their system and says I'm not.

Have submitted all my awards four times through two different units to upload to OMPF, the only one that has managed to make it on there is my BSMV. Still missing 10 personal awards.  

1SG goes to S-1 three times raising holy hell because I'm still not showing as promotable after passing the board two months ago. 

Missing three and a half years of overseas time, have turned it in twice along with my OMPF from when I was in the Marines- apparently my OMPF on DISK from HQMC is not good enough, because nobody in Squadron/Regiment can comprehend we used to have typewriters to input PCS and award info.

I'm currently assigned to a unit that is now inactivated. I just came back from a deployment 3 months ago. Currently, it's just a cluster-fuck of Soldiers trying to get the hell out of here. 

While I was deployed, I came down on assignment for a unit that was near my current duty station. I re-enlisted for stabilization a few months prior, so I was pretty excited.

Our OIC (CW2) came down for orders to go to Belgium. When they asked if he knew anyone else qualified, my name popped up because I have a TS-SCI. My assignment was almost immediately changed to go to Belgium. I was super psyched about it. 

Then, after I re-deployed, my assignment dissapeared. After a while of trying to fight with branch, they informed me I needed to waive my stabilization in order to be re-assigned. So I did that.

Now branch is telling me that there are NO REQUISITIONS for Belgium even though a by-name request (submitted from a 4-star) was submitted. 

Belgium is currently tracking me on their gains roster, but I have no assignment instructions in ASK or my ERB. In order to receive my orders, I need branch to give the go-ahead. But they're being really difficult. 

Any advice or tips? 


TL;DR. Waived stabilization for special assignment. Got by-name-request. Branch isn't budging telling me there's nothing available for the special assignment. Current unit inactivated and consists of cleaning out buildings and details.

Anyways, to kind of get some background, I'm 21, a graphic design major working on my AA at community college. I also work in Hollywood, and get jobs PAing up there.  A few weeks ago I came to the realization after watching a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H40EsEVU1Wk&amp;feature=player_embedded) of a shelled neighborhood in Syria and watching a kid get pulled out of the rubble with part of the back of his head missing and he was still alive. I just realized that what I was doing didn't matter to me, and that I couldn't just sit there and do nothing about this kind of stuff happening in the world.

Anyways, my boss's stepson was in Intelligence in the Army, and I sat down to talk with him and it turns out he actually worked with special ops as a field analyst, and I fell in love with that career path, that's where I wanted to go.

The only problem was that when I dropped by the recruiters, they knew nothing of the 35 series(Specifically I wanted 35-N or 35-S) and told me that they don't hand out jobs, I just get whatever I'm assigned, which is contradictory to what my boss's stepson said.

Anyways, Could someone please explain to me how to go about getting into that career path in the Army? Because I'm already set working in Hollywood, so I'm very cautious of giving that up to join the Army and get a job with whatever they assign me. 

Any help is appreciated. Really, I just want a straight forward explanation on how I would be able to pursue this career pathway in the Army, what I'll need to do, what I'd need to tell the recruiter, etc.

1376874235.0	1kmyef	"(22 yo F) Looking to joining the Army &amp; was confronted last night by intensely negative views of the army... by people, my family, and their ""friends"" who were in the military prior"	THowl	13	2	48	"THE WALL OF TEXT.
So last night I was at a crazy wedding celebration and in a partial family setting I was confronted with much negativity on my thoughts of joining the Army or any military branch (with small exception of the Air Force).  

The funny part is that up until now I've never really been confronted by any of my immediate family due to the lack of caring and interest, to be blunt.  My mother and I are not very close, but we do give a show to look like we are getting along- but so far that's it.  She was at the party but was only observing the conversations that took place. 

My mother has basically said nothing about me joining the Army.  With the random exception that ""it might be good for you"".  


Something I didn't quite expect to happen during the party: my cousins repeatedly sat down with me to tell me extremely negative views of the military, and especially the Army.  Now, my cousins are not and have never been in the Army or any military branch, so I took what they had to say lightly; but my cousins also claimed to have a lot of military friends that had experienced nothing but negativity from their active duty.  Their conclusion was that if I joined the Army I would be in the front lines, the first to be expended and used.  Now this sort of implies that I'd be a grunt- but my goal is to be medical in the Army (or Airforce).

Then I had someone, who did serve in the Navy for 6 years, sit down with me and tell me how he was dishonorably discharged from the military and how the military is crap now- and has been changing for the worst.  He was also beating around the bush being somewhat sexist too in his argument of how the military is going ""downhill"" all due to lowered expectations and non-camaraderie rules and atmosphere, using women's track times and PFT results as one example.  This guy and most of the people at the party seemed, I want to say ignorant and even extreme, but the man served for 6 years beginning in 1992 and I have not.  Although very notably, he was dishonorably discharged and seemed like a trouble-maker from his recollections.

Stunningly though, I also met a very positive and old airforce female, Marceline, who had been serving for over 20 years before retiring.  She loved the airforce and shared her positive and negative experiences of her job of being a B52 pilot (I'm a little fuzzy on the details here since I was drinking, but she was a pilot of something- derp) when it was amazingly rare for women to have this kind of position.  I very much enjoyed everything she had to say, even hearing that she served in the Vietnam war, transporting thousands of caskets, and her very close calls.  AND her losing her dearly loved husband in the military who followed her nearly everywhere.  Now she was the most willing to talk in depth about her experience and didn't hold back details.



**TLDR;**
Coming back from that party, Their testimonies have not deterred me from joining, quite the opposite in fact.  *I just wish that I knew more military friends and military knowledge before I officially serve the Army or Airforce.*  Any good ways to make good military friends before going in?  



**Edit**
I live in the United States, California Bay Area. I do not have a degree but I do have some college and no medical background (I've wanted to do medical and science classes forever but general ed came first).  **My first choice in the MOS list I've made is 68W**, and a majority of the list contains the rest of the 60's and other series that doesn't require a degree beforehand; BUT I have listed alternatives in case 68W doesn't work out for whatever reason.

I am currently 27, turning 28 in the fall. I have spoken to recruiters on and off the past few years from different branches about enlisted vs officer/reserve vs active, and different jobs in each.

My biggest concern however, is my age. I know the enlistment limit is 35, but I am concerned about being a decade older than the youngest enlisted, if that will cause any hindrances upon enlistment.

The mower went one way, the wheel the other, and my supercisor didn't quite know which way to go. 5 years and what a fight the two fo us had.

1336252491.0	t8txb	Getting kicked out of my house for dropping out of college and joining the Army....help	brianpilotsz	11	0	17	Here is some background info regarding my situation. I am a second generation immigrant, US born and raised. My parents are from the Caribbean and still carry themselves with a lot of ignorance and misunderstanding. In September 2011, I became the first person in my family to go away for college. I was the pride and joy of the family until I decided to drop out because I didn't feel very comfortable at my university. I'm from the city and I wanted to try a bigger campus and larger student population with a lot more activities. By the time I made the decision to drop out it was too late to enroll in the spring semester at my desired school, meaning I had to stick around until the fall. My parents took this as a sign that I had dropped out of college with no intention to go back. I became depressed because of all the harassment I was being put through in my house,i.e, I had become the shame of the family and categorized as my other low-life siblings. I decided to put my studies on hold and join the army for all the opportunities and a desire to serve the country that has given me so much. Long story short: I enlisted, not shipping until the fall and my parents are constantly harassing me for being a 20 year old drop out with no future (in their perspective) still living at home. I am constantly being threaten that I am going to be thrown out. I spoke to my recruiter about it and said he will bring it up to the first lieutenant which seems uninterested with whats happening. Can you guys suggest anything I can do before I am thrown out in the streets? I am willing to take any MOS even though I scored a 74 in the asvab as long as I am able to leave ASAP. Thank you for your help in advance. 	t5_2qtr8	True

In a couple months, there is going to be **huge** announcement regarding troop levels. **Everyone, you, me, your soldiers, everyone, must prepare to leave the army in 2 years.**... The army is in the buisness of War. When there is no war, buisness isn't good. Just like if you work for verizon, and everyone switches to AT&amp;T, you get laid off. Be prepared to see numbers drop **significantly**... **Even those who re-signed to get their duty station of choice might be gone in two years**.. Start making your back up plan ***NOW***....""

Among his other quotes, this came as a kind of stronger statement than I expected. Anyone else heard of something similar?!?!

I looked at the email some of you were asking about from the SMA about new semi-centralized board procedures. I'll sum it up for you since it's kind of long to just post, and then I'll provide the link to the new Doctirne 2015 website that everything is supposed to be based off of. I didn't see anything wrong with it as far as OPSEC or even FOUO, but if there is someone let me know so I can delete this. 

The SMA's email basically states that we've relied on on-line study guides for too long and that information and standards in the Army are evolving too rapidly for the study guides to keep up. The first thing I thought of was PT. The Army's PRT manual is FM 7-22, but if you look at a board study guide it will still have PT as FM 21-20. There are a lot more and better examples out there, but I think that's pretty accurate. He sums it up at the end saying change the way you're doing boards time now. MOIs need to be updated and all that.

The link to the Doctrine 2015 website is [here](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/MCCOE/Doctrine2015Tables.asp). The SMA stated clearly to choose your board questions out of those manuals and nothing else.

First about me, I am a 35F (formerly 96B for prior service folks) an intelligence analyst, In the NG (I really wanted this job, active recruiter wouldn't give it to me)
was talking to my S2/G2, and our unit is confirmed for deployment sometime next year, I have the date and no I'm not dumb enough to tell you (OPSEC). It will most likely be Afgan mainly depending on how our Annual Training goes this summer and what the BDE CMDR thinks of our BN.
For the past 7-ish months we have had a group of prior service guys come to our unit with this huge training event, mainly for the officers in the BN staff, the key E7s some 6s and even fewer E5s.
Being the only recently trained 35F I was asked to join these staff drills to help with the S2 shop, I was more then happy to join. 
These drills for me was at first just being in the back, lurking reddit until the BN CMDR asked me to brief him, I got up there and nailed the brief to the S2s suprise, after which the 2 kept me at his side at all times, mainly having the two of us stay up with the 3 and XO into 12-1 AM and getting up at 5-6ish, the other month I was awarded a coin and told by the CSM, HHC 1SG and HHC CPT that they were all very impressed, 
to put it simply and sound conceited, I am really good at my job in a training environment, and I love my job

Now my questions (for any prior/current service/35F/11B/18X, I don't care just need insight)


-What is it actually like being deployed in an S2 shop? I mean i was told all the BS AIT rumors, ""you'll help delta kick down doors"" and shit
but seriously? I know it depends on Deployment but any insight other then that would help.

-Directed mainly to 11B, and 13/14 series, what can the intel guys do to help you?/what does higher usually fuck up on? I want to really try and make a difference here, I've heard some pretty bad stories on how the intel guys haven't had enough and gotten some guys seriously messed up, In a DIGEX the S3 messed up bad and kinda dismissed my prediction of OPFOR in this town, he said there couldn't be, I told him i predicted at least X, and there was X times 2 we lost alot of guys, and I still cant stop beating myself up over it, and that was 100% simulated

-mainly to NG or NG to Active re ups, I want to go active, very badly, But I Don't want to fuck over this unit, I know a few guys in the companies, and I fee like i owe it to the unit, I am seriously one of 3 recently trained 35F in this BN any advice here will be helpful

Since I have no one to talk to/ask, I will post my questions here. I lived in NY for three years between 2007 and 2010. I got a middle school and a high school junior US diploma and finished 12th grade back in my home country. Now I am 19 1/2 years old, I am a European, from Bulgaria. I want to enlist in the US Army Infantry ( I hear you are granted a **FULL** US Citizenship, and that you get it by the time you finish BCT.) and get on active duty once done with training. The reason I am interested in the full US Citizenship besides from the fact that I will be able to live in America, is so after I finish my contract with the army, I want to join a TLA (Three Letter Agency - FBI/CIA etc) straight away. I have been working out for over a year, so I am fit, but a bit skinny (around 140-150 lbs currently, but I am still working out and gaining weight). I am around 6ft tall and have very fast reflexes and endurance, which when trained should be 10 times better from what they are now. No medical conditions, perfect 20/20 vision, I know Bulgarian, some of: Russian, Spanish, Italian and French, and obviously very fluent in English. Here are my questions:
*Question 1: As I have no US Citizenship, what do I have to do to travel to USA and enlist?*
*Question 2: How long does the enlisting process take? Should I be concerned with finding a place to stay and for how long?*
*Question 3: What should I be concerned with when I am done with the initial process? What can I bring with me to BCT/OSUT?*
*Question 4: Is there a way to contact a US Army recruiter online before I travel to the US, so I can prepare for everything I might need to enlist?*

1347424420.0	zr1m7	11Chuck looking for deployment advice.	mortarmanmike	15	5	5	"Yup. Got notified I will be deploying with my unit as soon as I reported to my duty station. I've only been in the Army for a minute and was wondering what I can do to prepare myself (besides the obvious, such as PT) to make sure my battle buddies and I return home safely. 

I'd like to give as many details as to were we are going, but putting such information on a public forum would be a poor choice on my behalf. All I can say is that I am going to Afghanistan and will be staying on a FOB. My unit doesn't know what equipment we are going to be using so I don't know if I am going to be dealing with the 60mm as a dismount, or if we will have a mobile 120mm. 

Well I have a few questions that have been on my mind and are in no specific order.

-Boots. I have the basic training standard issue, which are no problem, but I'd like to upgrade. I'm thinking of the Rocky C4T's. Any other suggestions?

-Extra clothing. I already have 6 (brand new) t-shirts and 5 pairs (brand new also) of Fox River socks ready to be packed and shipped to our new home. All of this is on top of what I have already and use on a daily basis. Should I splurge and buy more brand new clothes?

-Underwear. Any suggestions? I free balled for a month at NTC. Don't want to soil my brand new issued gear.

-Reading material. Is there any specific books or references I can read prior to deploying to give me some insight on OPFOR's tactics? Last thing I want is being on a patrol not knowing what the enemy is capable of.

-Special workouts. Besides our morning PT, is there anything I can do to give me ""functional strength"" that would be useful when in a TIC?

-High Speed hooah gear. Figured I may as well become a ""gear queer"" and spend a little extra money on gear that will be above the standard. I'm thinking about making my rifle (SI M4) lighter and more customized to myself. Any suggestions on how about to do this?

This is all I have thus far, and any help would be greatly appreciated. 


Lastly I'd like to thank all servicemen and women for their service, past and present. Although I am an Infantry soldier, I see myself different from the stereotypical stuck up grunt. I appreciate what the support MOS's do for us and help make sure we are squared away on and off the battlefield. 


Thank you,

My SO and I have been together since well before I joined the military. We were wary of getting married earlier because we wanted to see if the relationship could withstand two years of AIT and the rigors and stresses that come with being military. It did, and we're finally talking about getting married.

The problem is primarily logistics. I'm based in HI, she lives on the East coast. She has a house, a solid job (she's a phlebotomist), we're the same age and have comparable accumulated stuff, etc. She's got strongly established roots. A life. Considering all this, it'd be enormously expensive and difficult to move all this to HI. I'm trying to figure out how to do this without destroying our respective bank accounts, and to minimize the detrimental impact on her. My greatest fear is that coming out here might feel like giving up her entire life. This is our (though she doesn't quite come out and say it) biggest reservation at this point.

* Are you really kept up for 3 days during reception? 
* Any ideas on what Brigade I will be in? 
* What should I wear/bring to reception?

First of all, has anyone out there done the Call to Active Duty (C2AD from here out) program? Any advice for me?

Second block of questions, these might be best answered by the HR wizards out there; I know the rules for the C2AD, the major one being that I have to have gone to an active duty captains career course (CCC). My BN will send me to the reserve Quartermaster career course, but a career counselor I talked to said I have to go to the AD Maneuver CCC. That would be awesome, but obviously, my BN won't sign off on that.  I have talked to HRC and a couple of different career counselors and they give me conflicting answers as to how this is done. If I apply to the C2AD program, is my reserve unit supposed to send me to captains career course, or does HRC? Because I want to go to to CA, do I need to go to the MCCC or a different one (one career counselor said there was a SOFCCC)? Can I go to the reserve CAQC while I'm waiting, or do I need to go to the AD CAQC? Worst case scenario, should I go to the Signal CCC , then apply to C2AD?

First, let me say that I disagree with the young Captain that suicide should be institutionally considered a shameful act.

But some of what he states is correct.  How does our current approach help to stem the tide on suicides in the military?  What good does a safety stand-down day do?

It is much easier for leadership at any level to throw away a training day to PowerPoint and chaplains, hoping that it will help prevent suicides, than to enforce leader accountability every day on counseling programs and home visitations. But how can a BN or above commander enforce these programs from their level?

Finally, after the water and Tylenol treatment, I get to see the PA. I get a two week profile for muscle strain. Two weeks pass and i still have the pain. During the PA's follow up, re recommends Yoga and return to PT or begin the process for a MEDBOARD. 

I feel like a total failure to my soldiers. I show up get hurt during PT, 1SG sees me as a complete waste of rank because of poor PT. My motivation is gone, that drive as an NCO is no longer there when I'm treated like a lazy private, trying to get out of PT. I'm on my last leg.

But at the same time I really just want to get my schooling done for as little out of pocket money as possible. I scored a 91 on the ASVAB so I have a wide variety of what I could do. 

My own questions are:
Is what I hear from my mother (who is so violently against me joining any branch that she kicked me out of the house, should I sign any paperwork) about how women are treated in the Army really as bad as she makes it sound?
I know money is tight, would Army or AF be able to help more with college? (I know I'm posting in r/Army, I only am bc I'm leaning more toward the Army)
Since I scored a 91, does that give me some kind of ""bargaining"" power with my recruiters? (Not entirely sure how else to word this question)

That being said, I'm not sure why...Has life in Big Army, specifically the monster that is the 82nd, sucked the life and motivation out of me?

I'm good at my job, I know this because I have outstanding soldiers who I use as a measuring stick for my own performance. What I cannot stand any longer is the constant stream of BS that seems omnipresent here in the 82nd. All it takes is one bad apple in a leadership position to poison an entire unit, to make it difficult for soldiers to train, and make them miserable at work. I'm sick of the lack of resources available to me to train my soldiers, and the apparent indifference from senior leaders to change anything. I can't speak for other units, but the 82nd seems to suffer from a bad case of ""We have always done it that way""-itis. Complete lack of common sense is rampant, and the bureaucracy is thick.

**My question is this...Will I be more content, or even fulfilled in my job, If I were to attend Selection/the Q/join SF? Am I better off finishing off this enlistment and putting the Army behind me?**

I've been applying to medical school and have always considered military medicine as I feel that it would allow me to serve both my country and the most deserving population of individuals of which I can imagine. 

But, I've had little success with admissions (my undergraduate grades leave something to be desired, although I hoped my success in grad school would compensate, it seems its not enough). I'm tired of sitting on my ass trying to scrape points together for my resume. I want to DO something. I got myself EMT certified, but I can't find a job (I think they see my MS and wonder what the hell I'm doing--fairly valid--but also my county is overloaded with out of work paramedics willing to work as emts cause the supply of medics here is overwhelming demand). 

Obviously going to OCS and becoming an officer has advantages... but not the MOS. From what I understand, being NREMT certified expedites some of the training which is enticing; however, there's no guarantee that I'd be a medic (ie I could be attached to a hospital as a health tech equivalent?). I'm sorta a work out fanatic, so the fitness aspect doesn't bother/concern me.

Anyway,

Why did you join the army? My reason behind asking this is this little story that happened to me. Over the weekend(fri,sat) I had to go to my great grandmas funeral. Not all of my family knows that I am joining the army, and was explaining to some of them what my goals are while I am in because i plan on making my army experience the best I possible can before I get out. Well, while I am talking to my cousin about it, this older guy steps in(idk how he is related to me) and started saying that he thinks I won't even make it through airborne school. 

Little does he know that I have goals that I want more than anything to accomplish, and nothing is going to stand in my way of getting them. You know unless it's something intense. He was also ranting on about how I should just go to college and get my degree in computers(yeah i know a lot about computers already cause it was a hobby for me in school), and just start out making shit tons of money. 

I went on and told my cousin, ignoring this doucher, to tell her that I want to become some kind of law enforcer after the army. Then he butts his annoying ass in again and says, ""so you want to only make 20k a year?"" Again I ignored him because we are at a funeral, so I don't want to get into an argument.  

I am not joining the army for the money, nor am I becoming a cop of some sort for the money. Most of the time people don't do it for the money, they do it to serve their country the best they can. Which is why I am asking people on this subreddit why they joined. 

So, Why did you join?

1333126715.0	rl4x8	My great uncle passed away this morning. He served in the Army during the Vietnam war. This is a letter he wrote me in 2005 per my request to interview him for a Veterans report I was writing.	purpleghost89	11	1	4	"I was born in Phoenix, Arizona on May 6th, 1941. WWII affected us because our father was sent to war and returned as a drunk. He left our family and left my mom mom with trying to support and cloth us. I was only 6 months old when WWII had started. As a child times were rough since I grew up with no father and my mom had to work 3 jobs to support her 5 sons. As a young man, I used to love to bowl and play softball with the guys I worked with. Since being disabled, I now like to go to casinos and do a little gambling. 

I will start when I was drafted by the U.S. Army in June, 1966. I took a battery of tests to determine where and what I was best suited for. As it turned out my tests showed that I would be good as a company clerk. I signed up for an additional year to be guaranteed a position as a clerk. I went to Ft. Bliss, Texas for my basic training for 12 weeks. From there I was transferred to Ft. Ord, California for advanced training. My first permanent unit was with the 41st artillery headquarters in Ft. Still, Oklahoma. That was the unit I was with when we were sent to South Vietnam in April of 1967. We were flown from Oklahoma City, OK to Oakland, California where we boarded the USNS Geiger, U troop transport ship for our travel to South Vietnam. The trip took 18 days, which included 3 days of of seasickness for me. Our arrival was in Quihnon, Vietnam where we unloaded our our gear and were issued 7 magazines of bullets for our M-16 rifles. We then went by convoy to our base camp called camp Townes 25 miles north of Quihnon. The base was named after the first American to die in that area. We were there for months and then moved further north to Phucat, Vietnam. For your info, Phucat was the birth place of Ho Chi Ming, the leader of North Vietnam. 

In September of 1967 I was promoted to the rank of Specialist 5th class, E5 which is the same as a 3 stripe Sargent. My jobs included being the battery clerk for the first Sargent and the company commander who was a captain. My other jobs included Sargent of the guard. This job required me to post guards at all of our guard posts and check them every night and check each post to make sure that all the guards were ok. These guards protected the rest of the troops who slept at night. Another job I had twice a month was being in charge of what we called the Suicide Squad. The troops on duty would sleep with their clothes and ammunition belts on with their rifle in their arms. This job was used only when a guard tower was attacked. If the guards were attacked the squad would be driven to that tower and hold off any enemy attack until the troops that were sleeping were dressed and ready to fight. The most dangerous thing about Vietnam was that you could tell who was the enemy. They all looked the same. Any attack would usually come at night. As far as known battles, I could not say because there was not a front line to fight. Attacks would come from any and all directions. Our unit had the responsibility of guarding the southern side of Phucat Air Force base. The South Koreans guarded the western and eastern side side while the South Vietnam units guarded the northern side. We spent quite a few nights in bunkers waiting to be attacked. 

During the month of January 1968 was the time that that the people of that country celebrated their holy days. We called it the Tet New Year. During one night that month all units of U.S. services were attacked by North Vietnam armies along with Viet Cong (South Vietnam communist fighters). That had to be the bloodiest days for U.S. troops. There were a lot of Americans killed and twice as many enemy troops killed. Some of the cities were taken over by communist units and it took weeks of fighting to get them back. In April 1968 I was sent back to the United States and reassigned to hospital personnel, Ft. Ord California. My responsibilities there were to keep U.S. Army files on all hospital personnel up to date and all promotions recorded on their files. My other duty was to go to the airport and meet planes carrying wounded troops being assigned to Ft. Ord hospital.I would ride on the buses that brought the troops to the hospital. I would ask any of the wounded if there was anything I could do for them. The first thing a wounded trooper wanted was to notify their parents or wife that they were back in the U.S. 

As far as medals, I received the South Vietnam Occupation Medal and the Army Commendation medal for meritorious service. At the time when I was in Vietnam all areas around were sprayed with a chemical called agent orange. What this chemical did was kill all foliage so that the enemy troops could not hide there. This chemical which was to be safe to all people, turned out to be a lie. I left the Army on June 13th 1969. In January of 2000, I became ill and was taken in for tests. It was determined by V.A. hospital doctors that my legs had been damaged by agent orange. I am now helped by the V.A. hospital. There is still no cure for what I have. My legs from the knew down are numb and hurt everyday. The only thing that doctors can do is to give me pain pills for the pain. 

I have lost track of any of my buddies that Belonged to the same units with me. As an American I was mad as hell to see how someone could do this to our country. I was glad that our president sent troops to weed out those responsible. As far as Iraq, At first I was glad because we would take weapons of mass destruction out of the dictators hand. Now I feel that we were lied to in order to get rid of this mad man. our troops should be brought home now...I believe that the people of Iraq do not care about us. They praise us in public and try to kill all Americans. 

The national security in this country has now made all Americans think that we are no longer as secure as we thought we were. We now try to question any package that is left behind. We will have to safe guard this country of ours so that one day we can feel as safe as we used to. I don't think it will happen any time soon, maybe never, but we must try. As far as the future, I probably won't be here but, this country has got to stop being the protector of all countries. As we have seen, this country has sent troops to all parts of the world. We are now weak since we don't have the troops to handle every problem that comes up. This is, and should be, the problem for the United Nations, not just the U.S. We should and must remember countries like France who have depended on the United States to save them during any war...and what thanks does this country get. We are hated and shunned by our friends. I know that our country can only count on small nations and countries like Great Britain and Australia to help us. Hopefully we will be able to protect this country when the time comes. "	t5_2qtr8	True

However, I had some inescapable summer school that I needed to complete in order to graduate on time, so they had to pass the slot to someone else.  

I was just wondering when my next chance to go would be? I have LDAC next summer, so it's doubtful I'll be able to go to Airborne also.  When I eventually graduate BOLC, will I have the opportunity to go?  If not, then when?"	t5_2qtr8	True

I'm a 22 year old male working full time now with a bachelor's in Asian Studies looking to enlist as a 35F. I worked at an army internship while I was in school for awhile and really liked the whole feel of it, and have been planning this for awhile.

I'm meeting with a recruiter in two days and I was wondering if there was anything I should make sure I get put into the contract, basically I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions. Nobody in my family has been in the military except for my dead grandfather and none of my friends are either, so I'm short of real life options to turn to.

I've heard I can get airborne into my contract, which means I get to learn how to jump from a plane (correct me if I'm wrong), and that sounds awesome, even if it doesn't line up with the 35F job duties. But I really like the look of this job and like the basic descriptions I've read, although I'm not really sure about the post-army opportunities I can do with it, I see CIA, those kinds of agencies, but is that realistic? 

Another question, will I have any chance to request any sort of deployment locations (I'm going Active Duty)? I understand they can send me anywhere, but will I get a choice? I'd like to go anywhere outside the country if possible. 

Thanks, and if there's anything else I didn't ask and I should know, it'd be really helpful if I could have some of your advice.

He said if I'm not committed to being open minded about different MOSs then I was not ready to join the Army. I said thank you for your time, shook his hand and left.

1352699319.0	131trf	Slightly nervous. Could use some input. Being told to 'forget' certain things for my security clearance. How likely is this to bite me in the ass? 	ThrowawayAirman	9	0	18	"A bit of background:

I'm going for a position that requires a Secret clearance. I had a conviction as a juvenile. I'm not sure exactly what the charge ended up being or felony/misdemeanor/etc. but it was a pretty serious crime. I've done everything I can to forget it. It was a bad decision, over 14 years ago. I've never done anything remotely similar since, and only had a few small traffic convictions since then. I've discussed it with my recruiter, as much as I remember. He told me it didn't come back on my record and I need to just forget it again. The 1Sgt in charge also said the same thing. Said it wouldn't matter for a secret clearance, and probably not for a TS/SCI clearance either. 

I've also got quite a bit of debt. I was told to forget this, too. It's about $15,000 total, most from student loans for a degree I never completed. I was told I can't get a TS/SCI because of it since they will pull my credit, but that I should have no problem getting a Secret as they shouldn't even look at my credit for it. 

So my question, then: I'm supposed to go soon to take my physical and swear in the first time. As part of this, I'll have to go through questioning where they're going to threaten me, ask me about everything I put down, try to scare me, etc. 

Not gonna lie, I'm a bit worried about omitting those things. It's a huge fine, and a lot of prison time if they do decide to pull my credit or juvenile record. 

Can anyone give me any advice here? I really don't want to spend time in prison, but I also don't want to have to do 11b because I can't get a security clearance. Should I just listen to my recruiter and the 1Sgt, or is this bad advice that's gonna fuck me? "	t5_2qtr8	True

So here's the deal: I am medically healthy.  Never had chronic anything conditions.  Maybe a seasonal allergy here or there.  A few weeks ago, I had a bad cold, congestion, etc. and it made my throat hurt, made me a little wheezy.  I went into the doctor, and they start asking me all kinds of questions about whether or not I've ever had asthma, to which I reply, no, of course not, I ran track and cross country, etc.  I don't have asthma, I didn't have it when I was little, and I don't have it now.  Exercise makes me sweaty, but it doesn't make me sick.  So just to be safe, the doctor proscribes me a couple inhalers.  I don't take them, yadda yadda yadda, end of story.  I even went to an ears, nose and throat specialist who told me I was fine.  

Basically, I'm worried that if I try to enlist, they will see that I was proscribed inhalers, even though I breathe fine and have exercised fine my whole life.  My questions are: will they be able to see that I have been given inhalers, even if I never needed them?  And also, does it matter that as a child I was never diagnosed with asthma and that I don't have it to this day?  I was never told ""you have asthma,"" the most the doctor said was ""maybe being sick brought some asthma symptoms to the surface.  Try these inhalers.""  I'm a little freaked out because I'm afraid I've inadvertently screwed myself even though I was never sick with asthma to begin with."	t5_2qtr8	True
1349958316.0	11b0qs	[MOD POST] Looking for input from the community	mistahARK	8	0	6	"Hey r/Army, again, I'm the new mod here. I'm pretty excited to do some cool stuff with this subreddit. I want to make it a functional, educational, and open forum site for people of all ranks, positions, and MOSs to share related links, discuss topics related to our Army today, and to allow experienced Soldiers to answer questions from new Soldiers and Future Soldiers alike.

After some thought, I've decided to remove the rank structure to support the atmosphere I just described. You are free to state your rank in your posts, but I believe that having a visible rank structure in an open forum such as this, will alter the behaviors of certain posters, and will not encourage completely open discussion.

Instead, I've decided to implement either MOS flair, or Branch Insignia flair. [I'll leave the decision up to the userbase.](http://gopollgo.com/r-slash-army-users-what-type-of-flair-would-you-prefer)

Next topic. I'm not extremely experienced in webdesign or CSS, some of you visiting the site in the last few hours may have wondered what the hell I was doing a couple times. I'm definitely still leraning, and interested in doing so (that's part of the reason I really wanted to acquire this subreddit), but I would really appreciate some help with site design! If any of you are somewhat knowledgable of CSS, please PM me. As I stated in a previous post, I'd also like some help in building /r/NCOcorps.

One last thing. I've noticed that a lot of the submissions have been hitting the spambox lately. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the spam filter or what, but if your post doesn't hit the ""new"" tab after 5 minutes, then please message me and I'll review it."	t5_2qtr8	True

I can follow orders and I know the DS are there to make me a stronger person mentally. Just worrig about the APFT at the end of osut. How many people actually fail out of the army because of that?

1371272537.0	1gdvwu	Dis proportionate treatment questions.	Mabus157	7	2	11	"So this is not a complaint but a question. 

I've noticed that when a joe screws up they get put on blast, their counseling is photocopied and put on a wall etc. pretty much everyone knows when you screw up.

When a senior nco or officer screws up (save generals raping someone) it is under wraps. Example being my unit had a brigade sgt maj get drunk at a get together with officers and after disagreeing about college football said sgt maj knocks the officer down and kicks him in the mouth breaking his jaw. Afterwards the sgt maj drives home drunk and is later arrested for aggravated assault and dwi. 

I found our about this from a SPC, I was wary about his story until I noticed that his picture was gone from bde hq with no reason. Later the story was confirmed to me by a Sfc that was there.

This sgt maj was notorious for holding quite public incident reviews whenever a soldier screwed up at anything. From spousal abuse to speeding tickets he tore into soldiers and NCOs alike. When he screwed up I was wondering who would hold hid incident review but it never came. 

Can anyone explain why this is? Why do we hold our soldiers to a different standard then ourselves?"	t5_2qtr8	True
1370911449.0	1g32y0	Friend on emergency leave during basic training?	frosted_peaches	9	3	11	"I have a friend who recently enlisted in the national guard, and left for basic training just over a month ago. A couple of days ago, she started posting pictures of herself (in ACU's) with her toddler, in what looked like an airport terminal. Someone else asked her why she was home so early, and all she said was that there was a family emergency and that she had to come home. Ever since then, shes been posting on facebook about how shes getting mani/pedicures, going out for breakfast/lunch/dinner, getting shitfaced with her friends at the club, and trying to get friends to go see movies at the movie theater with her. 


I was under the impression that you couldn't take emergency leave while in basic unless a family member was dead/dying, and shes really not acting like something like this has happened. Are there other events that warrant emergency leave while in basic? Shes stated a couple of times that she doesn't know how long she'll be home for, which kind of makes me think that she may have gotten kicked out for some reason but doesn't want to admit it.

I graduated with a 4.0 from Penn State almost two years ago with a bachelor's in psychology and a minor in sociology.  Since I graduated, I have applied to hundreds of jobs -- I got *one* interview, and it turned out it was for a dish company I've never heard of and was more like a pyramid scheme than an employment opportunity.  I have, for all intents, no job history (I always focused on school; high school, college, it made no difference.  School came first).  I can't get a decent paying job, because I have no experience or work history.  I can't GET a work history from the lower-paying jobs because I'm ""overqualified.""  Yay, degree.  Thus, I can't get a job *anywhere*.  I've tried follow-up calls, I've tried insisting on seeing people face-to-face.

I loved psychology.  I loved studying behaviorism.  I loved all the biology/math/statistics classes I took as well.  However, it's not doing anything for me.  I'm smart (maybe even very smart), but ""smart"" means nothing in this economy.  They want ""skilled"" or ""experienced"".  There aren't jobs in my field unless I get a Master's (and even then, I have no guarantees at a job).

I've tried for these two years to get a job.  McDonald's won't even hire me.  My options are A) Get a Master's, go FURTHER in debt, and not guarantee a job even then or B) Go into the military.

The military will put me at E-4 immediately, thanks to my degree.  I may even be able to go through an officer program.  Instead of being weighed DOWN by my degree, it'll actually help.  I'll get my loans paid (currently $35,000), have an *actual job*, get work experience/a job history and be trained in something applicable in the civilian world (as long as I choose the right MOS).

Am I overlooking anything?  I really think the military would be my best route, currently.  It's damn near impossible to get ANY kind of job right now unless you know someone or *didn't* go to college.  I suggested ""maybe the military"" to myself a week ago, almost as a joke.  Then the more I thought about it, the more I realized it may actually be the best option.  I love my country (though not always the government) and it seems like a *phenomenal* reciprocating relationship (the Army and me).

I work well in a structured environment; I flourished in college with deadlines, research, travelling (to present research at conferences), leading other students on research projects, etc.  

I think I would do well in the military, in a medical MOS or such.

My first choice is joining the army and becoming a medic (68w). After I get out of the army and gain the experience needed, I can apply to medical schools/PA schools and eventually become a physician/PA.

My second choice is joining the army and becoming either 35F/35G. After the army, I plan to get a job at the CIA/FBI/NSA as an analyst or something... or... I can stay in the army and work my way up to 35L/35X/35Y.

My first choice, I've research and thought about for awhile and I see this pathway is very common, but when I tried to do research on my second choice... there's not much information available. 

I already talked to my recruiter about 2nd choice and he said I would be an ideal candidate for the CIA/FBI because 
1. already have my bachelors from a top 25 university
2. i will have years of experience by the time I apply
3. i will have top secret clearance by the time I apply

My question to you redditors is... is my second choice really realistic? Is it difficult to get a job in the CIA/FBI/NSA post-army or move up to 35L/35X/35Y? Is the job outlook good or bad?

The two options are EQUALLY appealing to me, but the only thing scary is that it seems my 1st option has more job security in the future than my 2nd option.

I'm not ruling out 35F but I want to get opinions from maybe more knowledgable people as to how good of a MOS 35F is, and how much of it is just desk work (I think I might shoot myself if I worked at a desk all day, even if it is just National Guard) 	t5_2qtr8	True

anyone have a chart of MOSs that allow Falant colorblind passing? Or could you tell me if 25N is in it?

I have been looking through as much information as I can find and have a list of at least a dozen MOS that I would be interested in. I briefly spoke to a Recruiter on Friday but would like the opinions of those of you who have served or are serving.

- I have a GED and some college so I meet the requirements but was thinking of taking a semester full time at a local community college prior to enlisting. In your experience does more or recent college experience make much of a difference if you don't have a degree? 

- I am mostly interested in Military Intelligence and should have no problem passing the ASVAB in the 95th percentile. My line scores shouldn't be a problem either but my credit might be an issue for these positions because they all seem to require clearance. I have a little less than $10,000 debt split about evenly between hospital bills and a car repossession; I have never allowed myself to have credit cards so I have no credit card debt. I haven't been making payments because I have found myself unemployed multiple times in the past 3 years and just haven't been able to. I have no criminal history, no traffic violations and nothing else that could disqualify me. Should I plan on one of my backup MOS choices instead?

- If I do have to choose an MOS outside of MI will I be able to put in for retraining once my credit is straightened out? How likely are they to allow you to change career paths once initially trained?

- Which MOS choices that don't require security clearance are good to learn skills that will translate well to MI positions. My ultimate goals are 35F with eventual 35P. I am very interested in linguistics.

I know the standard (read recruiter) answers for some of these but I know that because none of you have a vested interest in my enrollment you aren't going to be as likely to sugar-coat the answers. I really appreciate any insight you could give me. I like to have things well thought out and prepare for multiple scenarios. Even if I can't do MI I am still interested in joining the service. I'll just have to re-evaluate my goals."	t5_2qtr8	True

1350251433.0	11h9mc	Reserves, Chapter 9 separation due to APFT failure. JAG and retention questions...	tubachris85x	9	2	14	"Shit has hit the fan lately but I'll leave my personal life out of it. Been struggling with my PT for awhile and now it's biting me in the ass. CO has put together the packet for separation from the TPU. I have 45 days from tomorrow to make a formal response and not entirely sure how to proceed...

I spoke to them about the possibility of passing within those 45 days, to which he responded he would ""try"" to reverse the process. My biggest issue is the push up event, always has been. I spoke to the retention office and they told me that my best bet if the reversal is not done, is to be separated into the IIR, something they told me is at the CO's discretion. 

What bothers me is that both the CO and the SGT I spoke to at retention never dealt with an APFT related separation...they claim to have never seen one. One thing the retention sgt told me, was that being put into the IIR has no affect to the CO or the unit, and expressed that there is no real reason I shouldn't be allowed that option, unless you were a fuck up.

I took her advice and went to speak to my CO again. He pretty much treated it as if he would be making an exception and that he had ""no reason to do so."" He said he would consult with another officer but that his mind is pretty much made up. 

I am not fighting the reasons for the separations, I know I'm not meeting the standards. My intentions were to re-enter the army again when I get my life back in order and I get back into shape. However, given the current state of the military, prior service will more then likely be refused from re-enlistment. Therefore, going into the IIR would be beneficial for when that time comes, which will not be long if granted. 

My question is pretty much, aside from passing the APFT before the 45 days are up (which still is not a promise of reversal), how can I challenge the CO's desicion to NOT allow me to be placed into the IIR? Would this be a retention board?

Anyways back to the point.. The Opord seems like such an outdated tool to me. Many might agree due to the fact that they don't use it either overseas but My view is that I think the Idea is grand, I just feel the execution is flawed for modern day combat. not because the last 10 years have been COIN centric or I feel that combat will never go back to a conventional model. It is simply that I feel that current technology, as well as the landscape of the world in general means that the situation will change rapidly and you must employ a Agile force to effectively fight future conflicts. I feel that the 8TLP's are still important but that the time that you have to employ them to full effect will always be short; and will always force you to be flexible. I feel that the Opord discourages that. I continually see leaders and students try and force the plan to work instead of just taking a minute to be like ""alright Dave, seems shits change take 3rd squad that way and 2nd squad will have to place security over there now looks like were winging it again"". But it seems arguing over whether or not the 4th Paragraph is called Command and control or command and signal is more important. as well as if soldiers have finished the Human trafficking online course and effectively learned how to Photoshop their names on the certificate. I feel that army leaders have become to focused on the  silly crap than the things that really matter once crap starts to go south. Watching the classes come through the course I continually see soldiers who have no clue how to put a battery in a radio and turn it on, The deer in the headlights look is in full effect and we have yet to try and put a Freq into the silly thing I dare not even try and bring up Antenna theory. Simple skills that I apparently have taken for granted seem lost on many of these soldiers (and no it's not just the 1LT's ) even though some commander had to sign a piece of paper for that soldiers packet claiming that said soldier can do such task and is an expert at it. I think the thing that bothers me most is that in a broad general term these young (often though some are older than me)  soldiers are the best that that unit has to offer (well out of the pool of people willing to attend the course), In my Eyes Ranger school is like Harvard, In that simply attending or graduating does not mean that your worth a shit, just Simply that set your self apart and people have a higher initial expectation of you.

I don't have to take the ASVAB but I'll still go with the group on Wednesday night, stay at the hotel, then do all the physical stuff on Thursday. I am really excited, since I got my dream contract; 25B with Option 40, so Airborne and Ranger. I am so beyond stoked for that, but for some reason I'm really freaking out about MEPS.

I don't have any physical deformities, diseases, abnormalities or anything, but I can't shake this uneasiness. I've read a ton of posts about it, and spoke to the recruiter, so I know what happens, such as the urine test, checkin the ol' butthole, vision, blood pressure, all the stuff in your underwear, etc. But I'm afraid a few things could go wrong...

My recruiter was big on making a big deal about them wanting to find any reason to disqualify me. He made it seem like they are monsters who are only looking for bad things, and will kick me out at any chance they get. Is it really that bad? Do they go out of their way to send you home? One thing in particular is that on my feet, I have a few tiny barely noticeable spots that could be viewed as athlete's foot, but it can only be seen in bright direct light (which I'm sure the rooms have). Will they fixate on that? I don't feel it, its not itchy or anything, and I wouldn't know I have it otherwise. I'm afraid they'll boot me out. Also, with the 'underwear Olympics,' do you have to be able to touch your toes? I know you have to do a bunch of weird movements, and I'm guessing they'll tell you to bend over and check for scoliosis and such, but I can't touch my toes. Is this a problem? Is the duck walk going from heel to toe ALL the way down in a squat position? Or can you come up a little? It seems way harder than it needs to be when I practice, but maybe I'm being down too far. I don't know why I'm freaking out about that in particular, but I am.

All in all, I'm just trying to gauge how in depth they look at you. I've decided to only answer the doc questions with ""Yes sir"" or ""No sir,"" no details, and keep everything simple and be polite and respectful. But those few things are having me worried. I figure tons of people get through it right? How often do they send people packing? How long does it take in total? Thank you for any help or encouragement guys!!

1374301561.0	1iolk6	Thinking about enlisting in the reserves... Got questions.	seattlechris	8	2	28	"Ok, so a little background before I submit my questions to you folks: I graduated HS 10 years ago, and back then my goal was to enlist in the PLC program with the Marines. However during my senior year I had hurt my shoulder playing football and my recruiter had issues with me joining and advised that I strengthen my shoulder back up before I continued. I decided that while I did that I was goning to move to Seattle from my home town and explore the country before I enlisted while I got my shoulder back in shape. Later the summer after my HS I was involved in a car wreck that left me with having constant migraines for several years (I have little to no migraine effects now). However the doctor I was seeing put me on a experimental medication that had a horrible side effect of rapid weight gain. I went from 210lbs to 370 in months even though I continued to excersise and eat healthy, the meds kept putting weight on (I eventually got off all medication). Anyhow I ended up in school and graduated with two AA degrees. With in the last 2 years I have been pushing myself and have been able to drop myself down to 245. During this time I thought that any hope I had to join the services had disappeared long time ago with my dreams of playing college football. I currently work as a Corrections Officer at one of my states largest prison facilities, and talking with a number of my fellow officers who have served, I have started thinking that if I could drop my weight down a few more pounds, I might be able to enlist after all. My question is, even though I shouldnt put to much stock in what other people think, I don't want people thinking that I waited till the war was over before I enlisted and that I was a ""pussy"". I want/and alway have wanted to enlist due to the fact that the men in my family that I have looked up to not only served (going back to the Revolution) but also tought me to love and serve my country in some fashion. So my question is, at the age of 29, do you think that it is to late to enlist? 

tl:dr; after weighing 300+lbs my whole adult life I'm now 245 and at the age of 29, with the war officially over, is it to late to enlist? "	t5_2qtr8	True

3. I understand that there aren't always opportunites to volunteer for Airborne/RASP at BCS/AIT. What are the odds of being able to volunteer for RASP later in my career?

CPTKickass	9	5	20	"Given the Army's announcement that, as of 1 Jan 2016, all MOS's and units will be open to women, what does r/military think about women being required to register with Selective Service? The army announcement is below.

http://www.army.mil/article/105814/

In 1981, the Supreme Court decided that women were exempt from Selective Service because the primary intent of the draft is to fill combat roles, and since women couldn't do that, they need not register. 

""The existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress' decision to exempt women from registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided not to register them.""

If I was a recipient of a 4-yr ROTC scholarship, can I still qualify for scholarship benefits under the Hazelwood Act if I only do my 4 years I'm obligated to fulfill the terms of my scholarship? 

I am currently an Officer on active duty and have about 8 months left on my contract and am looking at going to grad school.

I haven't seen anything that says I wouldn't qualify, but I know there is a clause under the Post 9/11 GI Bill which says that an ROTC Scholarship recipient or a USMA Grad must fulfill their initial obligation before they begin earning benefits. In other words, I won't start getting GI bill benefits until after I serve my first 4 years (I received a 4 yr scholarship).

College degree in comp sci  
Poor vision that will need PRK  
Currently living and working in VA  


My recruiter suggested I do the following:  
Enlist into the reserves   
Get a job at Fort Eustis working in either aviation electronics or mechanical  
While working there talk to my commanding officer about getting to pilot  
Take the required tests for helo pilot  
Use that to show I'm worth the investment (Get PRK from the army)

- Should I bring my cell phone to BCT? Should I cut it off before I leave? Hearing mixed results on this one.

I'm 34 years old with a BA that isn't doing me any good in the private sector. I really think that the Army could be a good option but I'm running out of time. Am I too old? Is it a good/bad idea? I'm a wildland firefighter, so I'm pretty much unconcerned about meeting the basic PT req's and stuff, but I'm concerned about the APFT req's for 37F because apparently you have to score a 270 or higher for it...the push-ups/sit-ups are no sweat, but I'm not a great runner. If I didn't make the 270 score, would that mean that I'd forfeit my MOS and have to do some random job? Is it possible to get the MEPS counselor to put some secondary MOS clause in your contract? 

Specific to 37F: 

My BA is in Philosophy/Psychology. I'm not interested in this MOS for the same reasons that I've seen the majority of people online claim - I  saw one that said ""becuz I liek to fuck with people"". My impression of psyops is that it's a propaganda generation/dissemination job and that it's based mainly in cultural anthropology/social psychology type stuff. If that's the case, it's right up my alley. I also like the ethics implied in it; I like that psyops products/activities can prevent combat casualties for all sides of a conflict (though I'm aware that sometimes, it's used to goad adversaries into fighting). 

Do you have 37F experience? If you do, please talk to me; this could be a really life changing move for me...Is this job going to suck? Am I going to end up leaning on a broom or something somewhere? Are your skills actually utilized? If I do get the job, how can I get stationed overseas? Is Airborne school hard? Is language school hard? What's a good back-up MOS (if that's possible) based on what you know about my interests/background? 

What other questions should I be asking? What should I ask MEPS people? Are the horror stories you hear about with the military just people washing out and blaming others or is it actually possible to get screwed?

I'm a [i]very[/i] deliberate person. I don't do things without thinking about them a great deal. I have my firefighting job and in the off-season, I'm a professional climbing arborist; there's no end game in either, though, and I'm reluctant to incur another 30k in debt to get my grad degree. The Army just seems like a good option for me at this point and I wanted to investigate it before my time ran out. Can I use the GI Bill for a grad degree?

So currently i am an ROTC cadet (MSII) right now who is finishing my undergraduate degree this semester. Originally i had planned to go to a two year grad school program and just finish my MS3 and MS4 year. Fast forward to now, I am no longer going to graduate school, but instead I am going to Law School, and will be a practicing lawyer once i finish law school (assuming i pass the BAR).

I met with some of my cadre, and they were not sure what to do, or how that would work once i graduated. They said i can keep going with the program and after LDAC (or even before) they would see what they could do with me. They also said I could just go the route of Direct Commissioning. Can i still get into JAG if i do ROTC? Or am i better off direct commissioning (If thats what its called?)?

Hopefully this is the right place for this, they did tell me to see if I could do some of my own research and see what i could find. I went online to the army website and looked on there for information, but there was no contact information for me to use. Also if I ended up using any terms wrong please let me know, I am new this whole thing, but I am trying my best to get it right


Edit: I understand the title sounds a little funky, i realized that after i submitted it.

Edit 2: thanks for the advice everyone! I still have sometime left before I decide, I'm actually taking the LSAT tomorrow! So that will really decide where/what I do."	t5_2qtr8	True
1360097259.0	17ycex	Can soldiers who are no longer in the Army be punished for lying about their experience while they were in?	Junticus	11	3	21	I know this guy that has started a fairly popular blog and is lying about his time served (as well as other aspects of his life).  His blog paints a much different picture.  He talks of his struggles with PTSD and how he is currently doing a documentary of his experiences.  He wasn't medically discharged, he was a PV1 when he got out because he got demoted for getting caught impersonating an officer (he put a CW2 rank on his uniform), he didn't get blown up or hit by an IED, he wasn't in military intelligence, he was just infantry. He got sick over there from eating the food but he just had to take medicine for a few months and it was better.  I guess what I am asking is, is there any way action can be taken on people who are lying about their time is service?	t5_2qtr8	True

I'm currently writing a story and I have a part where a unit is trapped by their enemy. This would be Iraq and one of the soldiers needs to call on the radio for reinforcements but I'm not sure how he is suppose to say that. I did a google search but could find anything so I thought maybe some service men and women would be willing to help. 

The characters in the scene are in the US Army so that's why I came specifically here. 

Thanks in advance. "	t5_2qtr8	True
1359988021.0	17v82o	Resigning commission to enlist 18X?	TristanRecord	9	4	17	"Sob story time: Some years ago a buddy of mine convinced me to join ROTC, and while I was there another buddy of mine convinced me to join (and commission into) the reserves, saying that my unique critical language skillset would greatly help this unit's mission (PSYOP.)

Fast forward to the Reserve, I'm a miserable staff POG, USAR changed the rules on PO reclass so I have three years until I can put in my packet for PO, not to mention my unit probably won't ever send me because of budget tightfistedness. Over the last few years I have figured out what I want out of the Army, and it's Special Forces. I love rucking, running, shooting, studying the couple of languages I speak, I'm in the top 5 PT score in the battalion (beating a couple former Ranger/SF guys we have milling around); My unit's never going to deploy again, I have applied for a ton of deployments over the past two years, and gotten nothing. I would apply for SFAS as an officer, but the SF recruiter I talked to said that I would never get selected as an officer without a deployment

I talked to a couple of recruiters and they were really elusive about whether or not I could resign my commission and enlist. One said I could, and that the only thing I was eligible to enlist for was 18x, but then he started talking some bull story about ""you would have to enlist as an E-5, but you can't go to SFAS as an E-5"" which sounds like complete garbage. I am completely willing to go to OSUT, Airborne, WLC, pre-SFAS, start right over from the beginning as a private if that's the way it is.

Does anyone have the straight scoop? It's not like I'm resigning my commission to be a pussy and get out, I want to do something more and better than my current useless 'brief the commander about enterprise e-mail changeover once a month' thing.

I'm, unfortunately, a reservist due to me being a dumbass in high school and settling for my G.E.D. I wanted active duty but couldn't due it due to the G.E.D. I've been informed that if I were to get 15 college credits and do 18 months in the reserves then I can switch over to active. Is that true?  

If I were to want to shoot for Rangers, I'm assuming I need to be active. Whether or not I need to be active to attempt it,what exactly do I need to do to try?

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I have a few questions about the army reserves.  

Let me start by saying that I attempted to join right after high school. I had asthma as a child and when i told my recruiter, he told me to lie about it. I went to meps and lied. I got to the very end of the process and my conscience (and signs that said I'd be imprisoned, etc) got the best of me and I said ""never mind.""   

I'm considering joining again, but I'm just not really wanting to move away. I also don't really want to be deployed. What I do want is the benefits and experience. 

Is this the wrong reason to join? I've been told if someone does x years in the reserves he then has the obligation to be called back at any time within the next few years. I don't trust recruiters and I'd like to get the straight answer from you all.  

I don't have issues with asthma and I'm athletic enough. But I don't want to lie about it again and I would plan on admitting I lied if asked.  Would this disqualify me in any way?
