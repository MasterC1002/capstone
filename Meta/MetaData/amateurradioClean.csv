1311729214.0	j0pe0	Basics of HAM radio: The short version	versaham	78	10	19	"First post :)

I keep seeing posts requesting a basic introduction to amateur radio for the unfamiliar, so what follows is my best attempt. I will include as many links to examples as I can.

First off, saying ""*Amateur / HAM radio is like CB radio, you use it to talk to people*"" is oversimplified. Akin to saying ""*Skateboarding is like bike-riding, you use it to get around without a car*""


**OK, so what is HAM radio then?**

Primarily HAM radio is a set of radio frequency bands set aside for use by everyday people. It cannot be used for broadcasting (especially music), or for making money. Outside of that it can be used for experimentation, talking, emergency communications, and sending/receiving digital data. [A good list of the available frequencies can be found on wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#ITU_Region_2)


**But don't you need a license?**

Yes, a license is required from the [FCC](http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_home&amp;id=amateur), however:

* tests and licenses normally cost less than $20 US

* licenses are good for 10 years (do not need to re-test to renew)

* The pool of questions on the tests are all [published with the answers](http://www.arrl.org/question-pools)

* Nearly every area has a [HAM radio club](http://www.arrl.org/find-a-club) willing to help you

**What kind of equipment do I need, and how much does it cost?**

* For the 160 to 10 meter bands, you need an [HF radio](http://electronics.shop.ebay.com/Transceivers-/40065/i.html?_trkparms=65%253A12%257C66%253A2%257C39%253A1%257C72%253A5052&amp;rt=nc&amp;_nkw=hf&amp;_sticky=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_sop=1&amp;_sc=1)

* For the other bands, you need a radio named after that band, ie 2 meters needs a [2 meter radio](http://electronics.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=2+meter&amp;_sacat=40065&amp;_sop=1&amp;_odkw=hf&amp;_osacat=40065&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m270.l1313)

* For the 70 centimeter band you need a [70 centimeter radio(also called a 440 radio)](http://electronics.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=%2870+cm%2C+440%29&amp;_sacat=40065&amp;_sop=1&amp;_dmd=1&amp;_odkw=%2870+cm%2C+440%29&amp;_osacat=40065&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m270.l1313)

* etc, etc...

* Also, you will need an antenna. Plan on spending $50 or less for a good-but-cheap antenna setup.


**What license is needed for each band?**

* The first level of license is called ""*Technician*"". This gives you unlimited access to all frequencies above 30Mhz. 

* The second level of license is ""*General*"". This allows access to everything technician allows **plus** access to most frequencies below 30 Mhz

* The highest level of license is ""*Extra*"". This allows the use of all frequencies allocated to amateur radio.

* *Also, it is no longer required to know morse code, at all. Not even a little.*


**How can I see what this is all about?**

* To checkout the HF bands, goto [www.websdr.org](http://www.websdr.org/), tune around and listen a bit.

* For decoding the digital noises, I recommend [downloading fldigi](http://www.w1hkj.com/download.html). It runs on nearly every platform and decodes nearly every type of signal.

* For a simple intro on how HF waves travel around the world, checkout [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave).

* Checkout the #hamradio room on the freenode, undernet, or efnet [IRC networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc) and ask questions.


**What other interesting stuff do people do with amateur radio?**

* [Chat keyboard-to-keyboard around the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31), chatroom style or one-to-one.

* Run beacons which [test the propagation of HF radio waves](http://wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/map)

* Connect local [repeaters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater) together [over the internet using Voice over IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRLP)

* [Communicate using satellites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSCAR) (yes, [HAM radio gives you access to satellites](http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php))

* Setup long-range TCP/IP networks using 802.11a/g hardware. [The 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz WiFi bands overlap into amateur radio bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_multimedia_radio)

1326298158.0	ocgqo	On January 18th, Reddit will go offline for 12 hours.  I propose we get on the air!	mwilliams	72	1	52	"If you haven't seen [the official blog post yet](http://www.reddit.com/tb/obg8v) detailing Reddit going offline on the 18th between 8am-8pm EST (1300–0100 UTC) to protest PIPA/SOPA - I recommend you give it a read.

What's unique about our subreddit is that we're not dependent on a 3rd party who can silence us (within reason - jammers and annoyances aside).

My proposal:  On the 18th of January, we organize a number of frequencies covering the bands to allow for full communication while Reddit is offline.  We'll occupy Echolink (we have a Reddit Echolink conference we can use, or we can establish home on an IRLP enabled Echolink conference) &amp; HF. 

Does anyone have opinions or suggestions on this?  ~~Some coordination can occur all day long on IRC~~, but we can count on some frequencies for data modes to be constant - but if we're looking at SSB, we might need to float around a bit unless we can establish ourselves on a clear frequency with some luck.  Perhaps keep an ear out for ""CQ Reddit CQ Reddit""?  

Thoughts?  Opinions?  Suggestions?

Also - we might be able to get some shameless advertising on this.  Perhaps an IAmA post ""We are the amateur radio operators of Reddit from [/r/amateurradio](/r/amateurradio) who will be on the air while Reddit shut downs for 12 hours, ask us anything"" type of post in which we can all participate on.  We could draft a post here of how we would describe how we're staying on the air and are directly communicating without a 3rd party, our equipment, licensing requirements, etc etc.  Also provide many WebSDR means for others to listen in if interested.

Am I going overboard with this?  I work from home, so I can be by my radio most of the day.  I won't be able to be super active, but I can monitor PSK31 on 20m during the day and tune around listening for any CQ reddit calls.  Though I figure this would be most active after 5pm when people are out of work for the day.

-------------------
**I wasted no time, [here's the IAmA post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ockxv/we_are_the_hams_of_ramateurrradio_and_when_reddit/), I encourage everyone to participate if it takes off!**

-----------------
As suggested by Chucklz, I think I'm going to skip out on IRC and rely on nothing by the airwaves.

We can fire up another thread for final preparation before the 18th, perhaps where people might be more easily found, what modes you'll be working, etc etc.  For example, I think I'll mostly be working 15m/20m/40m PSK31 and SSB.  Likely more PSK31, monitoring waterfalls for CQ Reddit calls if there will be many working data modes."	t5_2qi86	True

Thanks to all of the redditors who offered tips and encouragement!  It took a fair amount of studying and cramming, especially for Extra.  One of the VE's said they only see this happen once or twice a year.  I was surprised at how many people failed the test though.  We had a couple of failed Generals, a failed Extra and even a failed Tech.  The VE team was very encouraging, though.  They suggested that people who passed a particular exam should try the next level exam, just to see if they might be able to pass it.  Also, I didn't realize it, but you can take the same exam again as a different version if you want.  It will cost you another $15, though.

However, I don't think I would recommend this (doing all three tests) as a viable strategy.  I know some of my knowledge is very shallow.  For example, there is only one answer on all three tests that uses the word ""puncture"" and that is the right answer.  I have a lot of things like that I inadvertently picked up while drilling the answers.  Right now, I would say about 30% of my knowledge is deep, 40% is normal, and 30% is shallow.  That's not anything  I would want to brag about. 

In retrospect, it would have been better to get the tech license, play around, learn, get context, etc. Then move to General and do the same thing.  Honestly, I don't see any compelling reason to get Extra other than bragging rights.   "	t5_2qi86	True

1365615425.0	1c2qbr	Bike broke in half while riding, phone left at home. Local repeater and ham to the rescue!	noahpugsley	63	4	30	"So yesterday I was heading to my buddies house across town (Tacoma, WA) on my bike. I haven't been taking it lately but yesterday for some reason I brought along my Baofeng UV-5R + MFJ-1717S, just for kicks and to see how far away I could hit the local repeater on 2m (w7dk).

About half way there the head tube basically cracked off the front of the bike. It's now useless and a huge pain to carry anywhere. I reach into my pocket to find my ipod instead of my phone. Great. Took about 20 seconds for the light to go off. I jumped on the w7dk repeater, explained my problem and asked if anyone out there knew if it had an auto patch and could they tell me how to use it. The only chatter all day was one response to my earlier tests. Within seconds a guy gets on and tells me that, no, this one has no auto patch. Then another dude gets on, says the same thing, but then offers to make the call for me. Yes! The rest is obvious and I was picked up in 10 minutes. So cool. 

Just wanted to share that cause I'm new to the hobby and I was quite taken by the novelty of the experience. And also of not having to trudge home! I know this kind of thing happens all the time but for me this was my first 'real' use of amateur radio aside from little tests here and there or talking to my buddy over irlp. So, Thanks Tacoma club,(w7dk.org) I'll see ya saturday. And thanks to all the hams that have kept up with the hobby so that I was able to take an interest.

**Summary:** Front of my bike broke off. Left my phone at home. Through the local repeater got another ham who called a friend of mine and I was picked up in minutes. It was awesome!

Update: Each conductive element of the dipole is about 99cm long, so I'm guessing this thing worked in the 70MHz region. The whole antenna is about 199.6cm long, including the gap between the conductive elements.

I'm 30 now and got my basic license when I was 22.  I tried out all the local clubs, had a setup at my parent's place and was active on HF.  I lasted maybe a year as I found the community was a bunch of old guys talking about their equipment and about nothing much else.  I tried the qrp folk out and they were okay but I just didn't find the community as a whole to be vibrant or engaging by any definition.  

Are there any people under 40 years old who are active after many years?  Has your experience been similar?

1313603659.0	jlt7v	My collision with hams -or- how I learned to stop worrying and love the static.		49	2	74	"I came to /r/amateurradio in the [/r/trees collision](http://imgur.com/I1elB) and was instantly interested. I had never had any experience with broadcasting other than a pair of wrist walkie-talkies from Fry's that wouldn't receive a signal transmitted from down the street.

First things first, being the kind of guy that needs a deadline to really get into gear, I found a [testing session](http://www.arrl.org/find-an-amateur-radio-license-exam-session) scheduled for August 6th. I contacted the VE (volunteer examiner) and made sure the session was still scheduled and checked what I needed to bring with me (blank scratch paper, 2 IDs (one picture ID) and a pencil/pen).

Next up was learning materials. I had wonderful success with KB6NUs [""No-nonsense No-code Technician's Class License Study Guide""](http://www.kb6nu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010_Tech_Study_Guide.pdf) and [Patrick J Maloney's Technician Class iOS testing app]( http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amateur-radio-exam-prep-technician/id297951496?mt=8).

Now that I was starting to feel prepared for the test, I turned my attention to finding a radio. In hopes of finding a hammitor (?) that had an old starter radio they were looking to part with for a good price, I [posted in /r/amateurradio](http://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/j2ave/you_guys_inspired_me_to_get_my_technicians/) looking for deals on radios and advice on taking the test. Not only did I get tons of quality advice on the test taking process, but  **an amazing redditor named [SpeedGeek](http://www.reddit.com/user/SpeedGeek)** passed down a very gently used Icom W2A and a host of accessories, refusing any payment but giving the condition that I do everything I can to get more people into the hobby (my buddy is taking his text in Vegas next month, SpeedGeek). Needless to say, I happily agreed :)

After receiving the radio in the mail, I spent a very long week listening, tuning, scanning and doing anything else I could with the radio short of actually hitting that 'transmit' button. I like to say that period is like trying to learn programming by watching other people code, but not being allowed to actually touch the keyboard. Very frustrating.

On the 6th, I nervously took the test (in the employee meeting room of a local grocery store) along with about 10 other people. Some were testing for their Tech license, some were upgrading to General, and one guy was teting up to Extra. There was even a 7 year old girl taking her technician's exam. She passed, in case any of you were wondering.

The test itself was very simple. It consists of 35 multiple choice questions, 26 of which correct is a passing score. 

Last friday, my call sign appeared in the FCC database, and I am now ready to explore! Since then, I've found some local repeaters and stumbled across some LEO frequencies (radio drama ftw) and tried a couple times to make a QSO, but I have, as of yet, been unsuccessful. I will not, however, give up. :)

I just wanted to write this up in hopes that someone else that has found this subreddit might be motivated to take the plunge and get your license!

I came here in the /r/trees collision and I can't believe I never got into radios sooner. 

I've gotten some study guides, and between them and a practice testing app, I'm feeling pretty confident about the material (passing consistently on practice tests). However, does anyone have any advice pertaining to the test itself? I understand the practice questions are drawn from the actual test questions, so it seems pretty cut and dry. Am I missing anything?

I'm working on learning CW at 20 wpm, and doing ok, but I'm nowhere near 'fluent'. As I understand it, CW is no longer a requirement (in the US) for your license. Is not having a good grasp on CW going to hinder me as far as working the radio while I learn it?

Lastly, anyone got a handheld dual band collecting dust they might want to sell to someone just getting into the hobby?

Flair is not just for anything that comes to mind. It should be reserved for either your call sign (with class, if you'd like), your QTH (location), or simply left blank. It should *not* be what rig you're running, your CB call sign (""roger doger, Calico Kitten!""), or a description of what you had for lunch today. It also cannot be a fake call sign or someone else's. Flair will be subject to moderation.

While 100% anonymity is not required for this post, I don't really want to single out this club, because I'm sure there are many more like it.

Every year or so I get the idea to go to a local club meeting thinking it will be somehow different than last time. Every year I am disappointed. I took my daughter (age 6) to the local club meeting tonight.

While daughter sat quietly before the meeting completing her homework, I chatted with another ""new guy"" at the meeting at the same table. Then, the meeting got started. There was cake and ice cream at the beginning of the meeting, so there was some noise. Abnormal ruckus, I assumed; soon to be rectified.

When the program started, a very knowledgable gentleman was giving a really neat presentation. Unfortunately, there was no microphone, so we were already straining to hear. The room was a very narrow rectangle and not conducive to any presentation. A public address system of some kind would have worked wonders. These are hams, let's try to conquer the sound amplification thing.

Meanwhile, the ladies (who evidently couldn't care less about ham radio), sat in the back of the room and chatted, giggled and hooted about everything from their next cake baking party to Beyonce's wardrobe from the half-time show. I cannot pay attention to a strained elderly voice of wisdom while listening to this ruckus. Meanwhile, my 6 year old daughter sat quietly; after all, we'd just had a talk about how it's rude to speak when others are talking. What an angel.

An evidently ""long time"" member of the club came barging into the room late. Most people at the meeting weren't exactly competing for style awards, but this fellow was very overweight and wearing the worst fake leather cowboy hat I've ever seen and a trench coat-ish thing. When he walked his feet shuffled loudly, which echoed across the uncarpeted hall. 

The same fellow's phone rang, but it took him about 45 seconds to realize the obnoxious musical ring tone was his. He answered as loudly as possible ""HELLO? YES. I'M IN A MEETING. HOLD ON."" He shuffled out of the room loudly letting the door slam behind him. The bang of the door temporarily muted the cackling ladies, but it soon started back up. Other various side conversations, by evidently hard of hearing men, confused the room even more.

When he returned from his phone call, he let the door slam again and stood about 5 feet behind me. There was finally some silence when, suddenly, a giant belch that turned some heads. He shuffled over the ladies table and began to lay on the game. He could not control the tone of his voice.

I was ready to go by this time, so I quietly gathered my daughter's things. I had to throw away a plate from the aforementioned cake, so I walked to nearly where he was. In a seemingly accidental movement, he took a step forward and farted as loud and as wet as he could. He made no apologies, and I'm not 100% sure he realizes it happened.

I gathered my daughter, showered her with praise for being so polite and respectful and talked to her about the lessons we could learn from these people.


TL;DR - Went to ham club meeting. Attendees were rude, loud, burped and farted. If you are the president of a club, consider a loudspeaker to help squelch room noise.

It's a high.  I'm liking it.  

Best part of it was, I had one of my co-workers, a non-ham, sitting with me.  I hear the CQ, go back to him, thinking ""this'll never happen, I've never gotten more than 5w out of this antenna, I'm gonna look like a crackpot""

Then I heard my call come back!!  I about went through the roof!  I'm freaking out inside, staying calm outside, getting the qsl (except the frequency, stupid moron me, thank goodness for other hams and QRZ) and having a nice chat about 0C weather and 20cm of snow where he's at.

Whoo.  Now I'm about to sit in the parking lot for lunch-hour and see if I can get any more.  I was driving around and got a busted QSL from Italy(?).

I see a lot of newbies coming in, looking for info on getting into the hobby. It can be frustrating to try and start from scratch using online resources only, as information can seem somewhat fragmented, and questions are many and complex. A forum like this is a great place to glean information and ask specific questions, but it can leave big holes.

So, I will happily volunteer to be a one-on-one mentor for any newbie who wants information on the hobby, whether it's just a couple questions, or going from clueless noob to DXCC. If you're not in the Great Lakes region, I'd be happy to help online, but if you're within a 2 hour drive of Meadville, PA, I'll mentor folks face to face as well.

A few qualifications:
Licensed 10 years next month, 5 years as an Extra. I've taught licensing classes for more than 100 people with an 85% pass rate. I've dabbled in almost every facet of the hobby, Satellites, Tropo, QRP, Aeronautical Mobile, Land mobile, antenna and transceiver homebrew, contesting, VLF, etc.

Perhaps my biggest qualification: I've been told I'm 'not dangerous, or an ass', which I think in most states qualifies me to teach high school.

So, if you want a specific person you can come to with questions, drop me an orangered and we can set up a reliable way to communicate.

If other members are interested in offering up their services as an Elmer one-on-one, post in the comments below and maybe we can generate a list for the sidebar or something.

**EDIT:** Fellow Elmers, it's time to step up. I seem to have identified a need, as I've been contacted by at least a dozen individuals both in the thread below, and by PM. I can help everyone I've heard from so far, but it might come to a point where that isn't the case in the very near future.

**EDIT 2: (1/05/2012)** I'm heading out for the weekend on vacation, so I may not be as easy to reach until Tuesday. I will try and keep up with posts here, but if you don't hear from me immediately, don't despair. My fellow Elmers are starting to find their way into the thread, and hopefully they can pick up some of the slack until I return.

It was just a bad vibe all the way around there. Well about a month ago I found another club in my area, and I just went to their first meeting since my discovery, and holy cow- what a difference. A smaller group of people (some even close to my age, but still mostly older) who seemed excited about radio, and excited to have another person joining them who wanted to learn about radio.

""Regarding the speed at which the FCC responds to complaints, I again refer you to what Laura Smith said in the article in the December issue of QST, in which she answered by three words, administrative due process.  The FCC is under many more constraints than when Riley Hollingsworth was in the Enforcement position plus having fewer people to follow up on cases.  Most of us can’t appreciate the ramifications of this and simply see slow response as a sign of lack of interest in enforcement on the amateur bands.  This is not true, it is just the fact that there is more red tape to go through and the FCC has to have the needed documentation, otherwise the case is likely to be thrown out.

 

Since letters went out regarding interference on 14313 several months ago, I have noticed improvement there, although at times, unacceptable behavior remains.  Work is continuing by the FCC there to address the remaining issues.""

The reason I asked is because my dad is a huge hamateur radio dude and I'd had his call-sign engraved into my brain after hearing him from the kitchen on his radio.  It seemed random so I ended up using it as my password later on in life.

I haven't talked much with him about his radio stuff so I don't know if there's any significance behind it or if it's just randomly assigned.  

I don't talk to him often cause he's in England right now (I'm  American) and We're rarely both on skype at the same time.  I kinda miss him so I should probably log on now.  :/

I started the night calling CQ a few times and listening. 20 watts on 20 meters at 0100Z might have been tough, I thought. As it turns out, not so hard. Maybe that's part of the allure of CW.

Hovering around the bottom of 20M, I stumbled across this guy calling CQ fairly slow and sending his call slow enough even I could copy (most of) it. I missed the last letter, but decided to respond anyway. I just sent his call and mine, and waited. He responded and, I heard my call repeated, then his. I got the fill I needed on the last letter.

Then he started the QSO, at first I was overwhelmed and my brain turned off. I missed a lot of his first few remarks. My head was swimming and I was sweating. I think I heard a signal report, 599, as I recall. Then I took a deep breath and focused only on what was being sent, without beating myself up about what I had missed. I copied (poorly) his name (which I later confirmed on QRZ) and city. He turned it back to me, I heard my call again (God knows I had sent it enough during practice with just the sidetone of the radio to recognize it). I'm really doing this, I thought.

Back to me, I now replied. His call, mine again, and then ""SRY I AM SO SLOW MY 1ST QSO JASON HERE. BTU"" Except, I screwed up on sending the ""Y"" in ""SRY,"" so there was a little rough spot. And then, nothing but silence. Well, S3-level noise, but no reply. Damn, I was so slow I ran him off. At this point I'm frustrated with myself, and I'm pretty sure I'll never make a real CW QSO.  So, I fired off an email to his account I found on QRZ. Told him thanks for trying, sorry I was slow, and hope to hear him again. 

Then, out of nowhere a new email to me, from him. It's not a reply to my email, but rather a new email, indicating he probably looked me up on QRZ, too. He says his computer crashed when he turned it back to me and it locked his radio in transmit. He missed my reply and by the time he got back, another QSO had started. Anyway, he then replied to my email and said my signal was excellent and I did really well for the first time. He has agreed to work with me later this week to help build my speed.

I logged it, I guess it wasn't a full QSO by some standards, but damn it, it was cool. I think I'm hooked on CW.

**TL;DR  Made my first CW QSO tonight, and was nervous that I screwed it up. Turned out the other guy's equipment malfunctioned, and now I have a CW elmer.**

1363211607.0	1a8sds	May I ask some questions about spark-gap  transmitters?	Marauder	36	1	19	"I figured if anyone knew about transmitters and antennas it would be this group. In an attempt to understand why antennas radiate electromagnetic waves I have gone back to studying the first transmitter – the spark gap transmitter.  I'm working my way forward from there.  Anyway.... [I found this page](http://resonanceswavesandfields.blogspot.com/2007_06_01_archive.html) with a flash animation of a simple spark gap generator and a description of its operation.  It is pretty straightforward and I get it.  My questions, in reference to the circuit shown on that page, are:


1.)	That battery is going to need serious potential to provide the necessary voltage for a spark to jump the gap.  I’m assuming that the voltage and current capacity of the battery and the charging capacitor Cc are what determine the transmitter power output before accounting for gain from the antenna.  Is this correct? I'm guessing in real SG transmitters this would actually be the output from an induction coil.


2.)	I am assuming the impulse from the current jumping the gap is analogous to the thwack of ringing a bell.  The thwack is needed to create the resonance in the LC circuit (to which the antenna is attached).  Modern transmitters don’t need to do this because they set up a continuous wave that is used for the carrier.  Correct so far?


3.)	The resonant frequency of the LC circuit *could* be set up for low frequency ranges (say 60Hz) but it would be pointless because A.) Low frequency waves have low energy so they aren’t going to go very far and B.) the antenna length needs to be ½ the wavelength of the resonant wave for the antenna to be an effective radiator.   (And resonance is key to creating an effective radiator?) A 60Hz wave would require an antenna miles long so it isn’t practical to attempt to broadcast on waves much longer than say 600 kHz. Am I still on track?


4.)	Finally…. I don’t completely understand why the spark gap transmitter transmits over such a wide band (and thus are illegal everywhere).  I assume it is because the resonance in the rather primitive LC circuit is very imprecise.  So even though you size the coil and capacitor to generate a 600Khz wave it actually generates a messy wave that can be anywhere from say 100khz to 1.2 mHz (or worse).   Can someone clarify why they are so imprecise in their transmission?

Sorry for the wall of text.  If you can help in anyway or point me towards good resources, I would really appreciate it. If I don't have anything horribly wrong I think I am ready to progress to how much more modern transmitters work.  I hadn't really thought about getting my license but so far this is fun. Who knows where it will lead...

I started a thread last night in this subreddit asking all non-licensed readers to list their biggest roadblocks to getting licensed, with the hopes of maybe finding 5 or 6 people who I could help along the way. What I got was a huge response from the entire community, newbies and elmers alike, and a lot of input on issues that need to be addressed.

Perhaps one of the more surprising conclusions I came to is: Most people who believe they have some significant obstacle to overcome actually just have too little, or incorrect information. This can range from simple things, like not knowing the best places to shop for inexpensive gear or not being able to find a VE exam in their area, to fairly complex issues resulting from the highly fragmented nature of information regarding amateur radio on the internet at large. it was encouraging though, to see that many of these people  (I had more than 2 dozen newbies reply) could probably be helped in such a way as to make it practical for them  to become licensed within just a few weeks time.

So, I am going to attempt to address various subjects and questions I gleaned from that original thread in a modular, easy to follow format. We're going to start off with the #1 reason given for why folks put off getting licensed, and, big surprise, it's **MONEY!**

If you google around, you find pages and pages of folks using sleek, spankin' new radios for all their ham radio needs. This is marketing folks. It's safe to say that the average ham goes a minimum of 3 years between major equipment purchases, and those purchases tend to be for what I call 'peripheral gear'. Actual radio purchases are usually less common than that. 

People assume that the hobby is extremely expensive, and like many hobbies, it *can* be extremely expensive. But it doesn't have to be.

Let's break down the costs of getting started from scratch. You walk up to me today and say ""I want to be a ham!"" No equipment, no experience, no electronics skills, no study material, nothing.

The first (potential) expense is going to be study material. This is going to focus on US hams, as I have very little knowledge of the licensing process for other countries. There are lots of ways to go about studying for the test, and we'll get in to that in a later installment. For now, we're going to divide it into media. First and most popular are paper study guides. Books. Gordon West, ARRL, Ham Radio For Dummies, there are lots. Most of these, unless you happen to find a recent licensee who might be willing to loan you a current book, run between $17 and $30. 

The second is CDs and DVDs. Software mostly, some audio books. Great for blind folks, but often overkill. These can run from $25 to $100.

Then we're on to the free resources. The first stop for any new ham who's looking to study without spending money needs to be the [Technician Class Question Pool](http://www.ncvec.org/page.php?id=349). The pool is available in several formats like MS Word, .TXT, and the graphics are available separately. Once you have that, you have *every* question they could possibly ask you on the test, in it's complete and correct form. With the answers. Free.

Seriously.

The only thing they can change is what order the answers are in. So A can become D, B can become C, etc. No wording can change what so ever though.

Once you have these, you can begin studying the question pool. This is all the Gordon West books from W5YI are, though Gordo does a great job of organizing the questions into a coherent order, and explaining the answers and how to get them. He just runs through the entire question pool one question at a time. Google and /amateurradio can explain how those answers come about though.

There are also a number of websites that allow you to take practice tests online. [QRZ](http://www.qrz.com/ht/) is probably one of the most popular one, and they've done a bang up job improving their testing app over the last few years. Here's a list of others:

[AA9PW](http://aa9pw.com/)  
[HamTestOnline](http://www.hamradiolicenseexam.com/) (**This one isn't free** but it is a decent value)  
[HamExam.Org](http://hamexam.org/)  
[eHam.net](http://www.eham.net/exams/)  
[RadioExam.Org](http://www.radioexam.org/)  

There are also a number of apps for iPhone and Android out there that do the same thing.

These are just a few options. There are many, many others. I recommend using more than one, as it seems that some have a tendency to show some questions over and over again, while ignoring other questions. Some sites like QRZ have methods of avoiding this problem, but it still isn't a bad idea to switch it up now and then. We'll get more into study methods and tactics in a later installment.

So, you've studied your butt off. You're ready for the exam. Exams in the US are going to generally cost between $10 and $17, though some clubs will eat the cost of the exam if you join. This is not an FCC fee. This is a fee charged by the ARRL and your local club to offset the costs of proctoring the exam. Testing materials, writing utensils, sometimes venue rental, etc. Not all VEs are ARRL VEs, and some don't charge fees PERIOD. The [Laurel VEC](http://larcmd.org/vec/index.php?pg=teams) is one such group. Your license must be renewed every 10 years. At this time, there are *NO* fees levied by the FCC for any step of this process **UNLESS** you want a vanity callsign. Then it costs something like $21 initially and every 10 years.

At this point, you're licensed! Congrats! You've spent anywhere from $0 to $100 to get here, depending on whether a Laurel VEC is available near you, and your preferred method of studying.

Now you want to get on the air. You need a radio, right? Actually not necessarily. Thanks to technology developed in the last 10 years or so, you actually don't need a radio in your hand to talk to other people on the radio. Software like [Echolink](http://www.echolink.org/) and [IRLP](http://www.irlp.net/) can actually let you connect directly to repeaters, other individuals, or even fully functional HF radios from your PC or phone. It may not be quite as much fun, or quite as flexible as a real radio, but as a way to get started, it's not half bad.

**You're on the air. You've spent $0 (ok, maybe $15) total.**

If you've got a local club that's doing well in your area, join! Most clubs charge dues less than $30 a year, and it can open up a lot of equipment to you. Club stations can range from simple contest and public demo setups, to massive University ham radio clubs (*MANY* large universities and colleges have a radio club!). As an added bonus, many times new hams will discover that radios magically materialize from closets, sheds, and storage units when a newbie shows up. People will loan out radios that are gathering dust on the shelf. I personally was loaned a $3,500 radio shortly after upgrading to General!

Echolink is cool and all, and messing around with the club station is fun, but you want a real radio. Your OWN radio. I get it. First of all, **DO NOT FIXATE ON NEW!!**. We hams tend to take pretty good care of our equipment. It is very often a point of personal pride. When new radios come into the shack, often old ones go up for sale to finance the purchase. The used market is strong right now.

Hamfests are a good start. I got my niece on the air this summer for $50 with a Kenwood dual band HT that just needed a new battery pack. Got everything we needed at her first hamfest.

Also, while I advise most folks to avoid Craigslist and eBay because of concerns about buying stolen or damaged radios, or just being outright scammed out of money, there is one place online I have always been comfortable buying used gear. [QRZ has a Sale &amp; Trade Board!](http://forums.qrz.com/forumdisplay.php?7-Ham-Radio-Gear-For-Sale). 

Use some caution, and maybe get an experienced ham to help you shop, but I've made several dozen purchases from individuals on the QRZ swapmeet, and sold gear there as well. I've never been dissappointed, and I've gotten some stellar deals. Hams there have their personal reputation at stake, because there are a *lot* of hams that are members of QRZ. Word gets around quick if you're a scam artist.

The key with buying gear is **PATIENCE**. If you don't see a good deal in your price range, don't rush into a mediocre deal. Hold out, even if it means waiting for another hamfest, or another paycheck. It will pay off in the end.

So with that first HT, you can at least work the local repeaters. You may also be able to work our fleet of satellites with a homebrew antenna if you bought a dual bander. With Satellites, you can get almost anywhere in North America, the Carribbean, and big chunks of Central America with 5w and a $20 antenna. If you prefer to buy new, there's a new company in the market that is a great first radio. [Woxoun](http://www.wouxun.com/) radios are turning up everywhere these days, and AES is now a dealer for them (At least, the one in Cleveland is). These are the Honda Civic of the new radio world. They've got a decent set of features, they're reasonably reliable, and best of all, they're VERY affordable. The 5w dualbander, new out of the box with some nice features, is right around $100.

You're now talking to stations all over the US, and you've spent $50-$150.

Things I've noticed: /r/morse is not very active. Anything we can do to change this? Seems as though it's not very needed since /r/amateurradio is so expansive. Also, the swap meet thread seems to have gone by the wayside too. Is this the case? 

In case anyone is still wondering, I am leaving BigFriendlyRobot in charge of the flair as it does a nice job of enforcing valid call signs. This may be subject to change in the future, but I like it for now. Please discuss below if you feel differently!

I also added a link to the FAQ thread. Does everyone like this? Is this a good format, or should it be something a little more permanent?

On September 27th at 9:35AM PDT, our satellite ([TechEdSat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechEdSat) - KJ6TVO) will be deployed from the International Space Station.  We have a couple of ground stations in the Silicon Valley, and one in Lithuania (don't ask), but to get better packet coverage we are enlisting the help of the amateur radio community to download these packets!

Some technical information:

* The transmitter will send AX.25 packets once every 4 seconds, at 100 mW with a minimum gain of -3 dB (tumbling spacecraft)
* The transmission frequency is 437.465 MHz, linearly polarized
* Based on our link calculations, if you have a 14 dB antenna you should be able to pick up packets horizon to horizon,  an 8 dB antenna should get you +15* to +15*, and a 3 dB antenna should get you +35* to +35*.
* The above numbers represent signals that will meet minimum signal to noise ratio requirements for packet decoding.  If you receive a noisy packet that you cannot decode, we'd love to get audio as well!
* *PLEASE* submit all packets [here](http://techedsat.com/index.php?option=com_proforms&amp;view=form&amp;jid=1&amp;Itemid=189)
* Orbital Elements should be available from NORAD within a few days of deployment.

Packets look like this:

Short instructions for how to receive packets on a laptop using MixW:  http://mixw.net/index.php?j=downloads

Tune your receiver to the appropriate frequency, turn off squelch and set the volume to the lowest possible setting.  Connect the radio’s audio output to the laptop’s Line In port, and configure the software as shown in the pictures attached.  Note you must select Mode-&gt; Packet before Mode-&gt;Mode Settings will give you the appropriate AX.25 packet settings.

Some folks don't like to ask basic questions publicly, or might have numerous questions and feel like they would be spamming the subreddit, so I'll extend an offer that I've made before with good results.

If anyone has questions they don't want to ask here, or feel like one-on-one interaction would be better for them, I would be happy to help.

I'm in the US. I've been a ham for about 12 years, Extra since 2005. I'm coming back in to the hobby after a bit of a break over the last year due to living arrangements and a lack of free time.

I've been an instructor for the Boy Scouts for about 7 years, for both the merit badge and a licensing, and now I'm moving to the Navigators. I've gotten about 100 students through the licensing process over the years.

I've got a wide range of experience in the hobby. SSB, digital, some CW, backpacking and portable operations, SKYWARN, satellites, and tons of homebrew (radios, antennas, and accessories).

I would be more than happy to answer individual questions, or walk you through the whole process to get your license (in the US). I can communicate via PM, this thread, or email. If you're in the Pittsburgh, PA area, I would be happy to work face to face. If you're out of the US, I'll try and set you up with someone in your country who can walk you through the process.

How many folks I can work with will really depend on what sort of input everyone needs, so I'll work on a first come, first served basis.

I found the local club, went to a couple of meetings, and joined, but I don't think they foster a good environment for young folks like me (I'm 23) to learn and do more. The club barely participates in anything, tasked me with editing the web site and newsletter knowing I don't know all that much, and doesn't seem to want to help out. As a result we have a new web site with old content and I have yet to release a newsletter since I have nothing to put in it. It needs a changing of the guard and I don't think it will happen anytime soon.

Would it be bad etiquette to completely bypass the existing club and get some 35-and-under hams together to do something different? I really want to keep the hobby from literally dying out and I feel that's the only way I can do something about it. Has anyone else done this and/or had any success?

As I came into my late twenties I finally had the scratch and the occasion to build up an HF station and a satellite station, two long-held dreams of mine.

Here's the problem. I am completely offended and have nothing in common with the average ham operator, to the point where I am considering shelving my license and selling all of my gear to engage in a hobby where there is less blatant racism and blind conservatism. 

Any spin down 75 meters will give you a treasure trove of anti-Obama racism and cussing, when they're not discussing ailments. (This really happens. All day long. All up and down the band.) The younger more techy types are either really, really undersocialized or have drank far too deeply from the Emergency Public Service Radio Guys Kool-Aid and are whackers with blue lights on their car and a radio on a belt-clip 24/7.

My sat station is fun and a great challenge, but of course that's not HF so there's no real funding for those endeavors, and it's hard to justify $500 all-mode radios (do it right or don't do it at all IMO) for multiple bands when the only action they get is a 30 second RST exchange QSO twice a month.

Are there any more professional, clean-cut (not stinky), not dying and not hate-monger radio operators? I don't mean to pigeonhole, but I have been sitting there in my little shack spinning the dial, sighing and moving on for YEARS. Scientifically/technically speaking I love radio and RF more than any other calling I've found, but I'm at a point where I kind of need to justify my continued involvement and spending on this hobby, and I feel that it's turned into the last refuge of a few sad old hateful men.

1375952942.0	1jy25x	A story about RFI, with a happy ending	kc0plg	31	1	16	"I have been fighting extreme RFI on my HF radio ever since I got my general ticket. It sounded like power lines arcing, so I made the assumption that it was power line noise. It was absolutely terrible, completely ruining my experience. I considered buying Audio DSPs to match the DSP filters in my radio. I was prepared to hunt down this menace so I could enjoy my hobby. Then I got to thinking......

A couple of months ago my beloved mongrel of a dog chewed up my wife's macbook air power supply. Being the cheap ass that I am, I ordered a generic off amazon and everyone was happy. While I was messing around upstairs I got the thought that maybe the noise was actually coming from my residence and I started shutting things down. Magically, when I pulled power to that damned Chinese knock off piece of shit the maddening RFI that I had been experiencing went away. 

There was a reason that power supply was cheap. It works, but it carries no FCC seal and obviously is a super noise radiating piece of garbage. Instead of buying a $200 audio DSP, I will now be spending $70 on a better power supply for her laptop.

This is the best piece of advice that any of the older hams have ever passed down to me because its the absolute truth. I've been a ham for a few years now and have seen many new hams make the antenna an after thought. They go into a ham store and plop the majority of their money down on a shiny new ham radio like a Kenwood TS-590S, a Yaesu FT-950, or something even more expensive then turn around an just put up a G5RV or a random length wire/dipole and a tuner without any research on antennas. Not going to say those radios aren't good, because they are. But when you have a shitty or poorly thought out antenna setup those shiny new DSP based radios aren't going to perform any better on the air then something made in the 70's or 80's attached to a good antenna setup.

I have personally never owned a radio that wasn't built in the 80's except for my Yaesu FT-817 qrp rig. I've always focused on the antenna in any given situation and tried to think outside of the box when doing my research. I've always been told I sound just as good as the newer radio setups and some have even expressed disbelief I was QRP or only running 100 watts. So if you're new to HF, don't put all your money and research into the radio leaving the antenna as an after thought. Think of your shack as a whole including the antenna when doing your research and save some money buying a used rig to get yourself started. If you do decide to get a more expensive new radio, put even more thought into the antenna to really get out there.

TL;DR: No, read it."	t5_2qi86	True

1361380008.0	18w7wr	Passed my tests, I have a few questions...	pconwell	33	3	58	"I passed my Tech, General and Extra all in one sitting Monday night. I started out just wanting to get my tech for emergency communications (I don't have any particular interests in HF, although it might be cool one day when I have money to buy some more equipment), but I recently got divorced and studying for the tests was a good detraction, so I just started studying all the tests. I studied probably 3-4 hours a day, almost every day for about a month - I missed one question on the tech, one on the general, and 5 on the extra...

Problem is, I know the 'answers' to the test questions, but there are a lot of things that I don't really know about actually operating the radios and the 'culture', if you will. I don't really know many people that are hams, so studying the books and passing the test is one thing, but it's kinda like getting your driver's license (I guess) - reading the manual and 'knowing' the answers is a lot different from actual driving a car. So...

1. How long does it take to get your call sign? I read it normally take 3-4 day to show up in the ULS database?
2. Is there a map, like a Google Maps overlay, of the location of repeaters? I know I can find repeater locations through directories [like this](http://www.artscipub.com/repeaters/states/Tennessee.asp), but I haven't been able to find a good map of repeaters.
3. My dad took the test with me and passed his tech - I would like to get him a cheap 'starter' radio that is decent quality. I was thinking of the UV-5R, I know it's popular and very affordable - but would it be a good 'starter' radio?
4. Repeater Callsigns - are they the callsigns of the repeaters themselves? Or the callsigns of the ham that runs the repeater? And I've noticed that there are multiple repeaters with different callsigns, does that mean they are linked repeaters, or just run by the same guy?

I'm sure I have a billion more questions, but these are the ones that are coming to mind right now.

Thanks!

EDIT: Another question. Is there an easy way to find repeaters for a city I travel to? Or is it just a matter of getting onto a directory and searching the city and seeing which ones I have luck with as I drive through?

Also, another question - are most repeaters on some type of generator backup? I would assume they have at least *some* type of backup power. My point is, if there is some type of major disaster and power is knocked out for several days, will the repeaters still run (assuming they weren't damaged during the disaster), or would you most likely be relegated to simplex?

We know that this person is still alive and well as he has posted on several forums and even ""sold"" the same piece of equipment to another ham up in the Kansas City Area with the same results.

1372044609.0	1gy3pf	We don't need no stinkin' Field Day	VE6LK	30	2	9	"What follows is an extract of a report for our section ARES command.  We participated in activities for the Floods in High River, Alberta.

Perspective: 16 hours before our ARES activation we were planning our Field Day activities at Scott’s home.  That was late Wednesday night.

We were placed on standby 0900h Thursday and activated at 1330h.  I departed my workplace at 1400h and arrived at the EOC approximately 1630h faced by several road closures and hampered by clogged and failed cellular networks and in-town roadways, a drive that would normally have taken me about 1 hour.  Upon my arrival the Town of High River’s sewer systems were offline and water was being drawn from the reservoir.  Phone lines were down and Telus cellular was offline but for the few of us who had Rogers it was fine.  Occasionally we’d get a bit of propagation and our cellphones would perk up to life for a second only to disappear for hours again.  There was no internet as the Town’s servers were also evacuated before a failover to the hotsite completed.

The EOC had already been evacuated to its backup location at the High River Firehall when I arrived with talk of moving again being forced by water levels increasing rapidly.  We bugged out about 2 hours later and drove 100km around road closures to the Nanton Firehall, normally a 25 minute drive that took close to an hour.  At 2230h we were moved back to the HR Firehall where we continued operations.  Owing to the rapidly changing EOC location I made the decision to split Net Control away from the EOC functions, thus we used Scott’s home location as Net Control.   At first the EOC was in High River Firehall (2h), then my truck (1h), then Nanton Firehall (2h), then my truck (.5h), then High River Firehall – so we split the operations as a result of being forced from our Firehall but still needing to run a controlled net.  That turned out to be a key differentiator allowing us to focus 100% on the task at hand.

Net Control’s roles were to schedule workers and report them provincially.  Net Control was staffed with some less experienced amateurs however they were very well organized with up to 4 people at a time working in it and two nearby but off-duty.  They rotated OPs every 2 hours to give breaks.  They totally self-organized.  I also told them to pair less experienced amateurs with more experienced allowing the newbies to learn and grow.

I gave Scott directions over the phone while driving away from the Town’s Firehall when we bugged out threatened by water.  I told him to set expectations with volunteers that they may deploy into a disaster zone and needed to come prepared with rubber boots and shoes, clothing, some food and water as well as their HT and radios.  Extra antennas a bonus.  We ended up with a very diverse asset base, everything from longwires to Buddipoles to those with multiple HTs, 4x4s and generators.  There was talk of deploying via Helicopter to the local Hospital.

We worked closely with many agencies including the Provincial Operations Centre, AEMA, RCMP, Alberta Health Services and of course the Town of High River.  We also coordinated our activities with other ARES units in the province.  Simply put, we couldn’t have done this without the high level of coordination and cooperation among ARES teams.  It worked well and should be used again.  Along the way our mission became twofold; to help the Town of High River and to help AHS.  We dealt with the AHS traffic from our position in the EOC and in cooperation with the POC.

The operations in an EOC are controlled chaos.  We are privy to much information that is highly confidential.  We worked shoulder to shoulder with people that had lost their homes and kept soldiering on with much professionalism.  It is a highly emotionally charged and very noisy atmosphere.  It didn’t help that we were not in our normal EOC and guests in the Firehall.  Hotbunking was normal as was sleeping on the couch.  We had half our normal physical space and very poor ventilation as it wasn't designed for that many people in it.

We were able to stand down when the cellular networks were stabilized for about 18 hours.

We adjourned to the Scott’s home for a debrief meal and meeting to discuss lessons learned, good and bad.  Splitting the command and control between EOC and Net Control was a key win allowing me to focus on EOC without logistics/scheduling concerns.  Our list of “do better” is matched in length with “what we did good”.

I’ll summarize it by saying that we don’t need no stinkin’ Field Day – we ARE prepared.  And I’m damn proud of the entire team of 50 amateurs.  Of course if I did file a contest entry, the exchange would be 5 Foxtrot, Alberta, representative of the number of control stations.  We’d probably win the contest for the sheer amount of traffic passed as well as running on emergency power and interactions with government agencies!

Here is the album: http://imgur.com/a/Gv8DA

I am able to talk just fine on a repeater in Dubuque, Iowa which is over 20 miles away, using the 2 meter mobile radio and the Kenwood HT. I'm on the top (6th) floor of my dorm, so that is helpful too. Unfortunately the local repeater here in town is on the 70cm band, so I can only talk on that one with my Yaesu HT. I am planning on bringing a 2 meter amplifier back up here from home to see if I can get better reception of the Dubuque repeater since that is the main one I will be talking on.

I didn't realize you could sit for the General, etc for free after passing the Tech so the VEC convinced me to try the General test. I took it but missed about 12 questions. Not necessarily bad for not studying any of the material.

I am anxiously awaiting my call sign. I currently have a Yaesu VX-3R - it's a great little handheld. I replaced the rubber duck antenna with a Diamond SRH77CA - I like it so far. 

My main interests are to join ARES, Skywarn and my local club. Hopefully I can chat on the local repeaters with the HT. Eventually I want to get an HF rig, construct my own antenna in my yard (nothing fancy, maybe a DIY wire between some trees) and explore DXing. This is all very new so I hope to get more familiar with my interests as time goes on.

Overall just excited to get my license!

No one seems to have the patience for a real conversation, and when someone does, there's rarely much to talk about beyond the weather.  But redditors, obviously, always have plenty to talk about.  It seems to me like PSK ragchewing would be fun - sort of like IRC or talk in the early days of the Internet, except with a higher character error rate :-)  

It ought not to be that hard to set up an informal net - all the fun of the reddit net and no need to actually key up a mike and let your voice be heard. Good for the SAPs among us.  And it'd probably reach a wider audience than the SSB net, too.

In fact, with a relatively quiet chunk of spectrum and the right software, capable of following more than one PSK ""track"" at once, it might even be possible to carry out a duplex (n-plex?) conversation, multiplying the fun.  And then we could try out other modes...

So what say ye, hams of reddit?  Who's up for it?

1344700562.0	y1uo2	Passed my technician license exam today and got a new radio!	ZureaL	32	4	20	"This morning I went to the Columbus Ohio Hamfest and passed the tech exam.  I was going to take the General as well, but there were so many people taking tests, they couldn't easily accomodate and since I wasn't really prepared for the General and it was free, I didn't complain.  

When I was active duty USAF about 20 years ago, I was an HF radio operator and one of our missions was MARS radio, callsign AGA7RM (Rhein Main AFB, GE) and I got to talk to some amateurs as far away as Iowa and it was pretty cool.  When I left the military I always thought I'd go back to doing some form of radio, but never found the time to do it.

Recently, a guy at work who had gotten out of ham, had given me a couple of radios (Realistic HTX-202 and a Yaesu FT-5200) he had, which really motivated me to start studying.  Picked up the tech manual and spend the past few weeks getting ready for it.

While at the hamfest, there were lots of people selling stuff, including a couple of guys that had the radio I've been wanting to buy, a Yaesu VX-7R tri-band mobile.  One was kind of beat up, but had lots of stuff with it, external mic, barometric sensor installed, etc...and he wanted $325 for it.  Another guy had one, open box, but had never been used, just purchased back in December, wanted $310.  Talked that guy down a bit and picked up the brand new one.

Today was a fantastic day!

Edit on 8/13/12 -- I scanned the FCC call sign db for a lark and found that they had assigned me already.  Test on Saturday, call sign on Monday?!  Well played ARRL/FCC, well played.

Seemed to be a big improvement - less noise, clearer signals.  I called CQ a few more times and then heard my call sign coming back - from N9KIW in Colorado; a distance of almost 800 miles.  Not huge DX, but still very thrilling.  I was also able to make contacts with several people participating in the QSO parties today - several in Georgia and New Mexico.

I've quite enjoyed this subreddit and learned a lot from you folks. I've also been enjoying amateur radio as a hobby for a year and a half now, slowly working through the intricacies and enjoying the hobby. I've noticed a few questions seem to come up fairly often, either on this subreddit or in conversations with friends. So here's a completely unsorted, quick-and-dirty, might-be-but-hopefully-isn't-completely-wrong FAQ about amateur radio.

All the opinions are mine, so if there's any controversy, I'm probably the heretic/idiot. I also apologize for the US-centric view in writing this--I've never operated outside the contental US. If you have any corrections/additions, please suggest them! Mods, maybe we could get this into the sidebar?

Alas, I wrote way too much and it won't fit in the a self-post. I'll post each one individually in a comment, I guess.

I have a Baofeng UV-5R that I'll us for local repeaters, but want to know where I should be looking for a base or possibly mobile HF rig. I don't know what kind of band coverage I'd want since I haven't played around yet on HF, so I'll probably just keep an eye out for good deals and wait for something to show up.

I'm going to get involved with the local DEM for emergency preparedness, and support my local amateur radio club which seems like it could use some fresh blood (see: 10% rule for volunteer organizations).

I have a mag mount I tried using a year or so ago for an old CB and later a scanner. I figure I can replace its aerial with something more appropriately sized for 2m/70cm. If I wanted to get an antenna a bit higher at home, is there a tried and true design I should try first? Repeater coverage is good, but I'd like to see how far I can get on simplex.

*Original Post*

I have the software ready to go to create the *REDDIT* conference server on EchoLink. Dedicated conference. Just say the word. I didn't want to steal any thunder from VA3CQC on this one, but I did think it'd be nice to have a conf to connect to and talk to fellow redditors during the week at random. It'll be about 2-5 days for validation, but yeah, give me the go ahead and we can do this.

**UPDATE @ 2011-05-29 0345UTC **: I got the following back from EchoLink.
    Thanks for writing.
    A large number of EchoLink conference servers with excess capacity are already online.  Therefore, at this 
    time, we are no longer routinely approving new conference server requests.  If possible, please try to make 
    use of existing conference servers, or make use of the Conferencing feature in the EchoLink software under 
    your existing callsign.

    Thanks and 73,
    EchoLink Validation Team

**SO** I used my personal callsign. It's up permanently. If it goes down, I will fix it, but seeing as it is on an infrastructure box with a DS-3 behind it, I don't see it going down that often. It's under KB3SQV-L. **ENJOY**

**2ND UPDATE @ 2011-05-29 0353UTC ** I have a ticket into my ISP right now to get those ports opened on my DS-3 to allow the outside world to connect. As soon as it works, I shall let everyone know here.

**3RD UPDATE @ 2011-05-29 0617UTC ** IT'S ALIVE!!! MUAHAHAHA*cough* Ok, KB3SQV-L. Just got off the phone with ISP and my iPhone EchoLink connects just fine. Have at and 73s de KB3SQV."	t5_2qi86	True

* [Puxing 2M HT](http://i.imgur.com/Xtfl6.jpg) - Includes charging cradle, rubber ducky and 2 batteries.

* [Quansheng Dual Band HT](http://i.imgur.com/B5WAN.jpg) - Includes charging cradle and rubber ducky.

* [Yaesu VX6 HT](http://i.imgur.com/BlSXE.jpg) - Includes rubber ducky antenna, charger, and programming cable and AA battery holder.

All radios are in fine working condition.  The Quansheng is almost brand new.  The Puxing shows some use, and the VX-6 is the most used, but works fine.

There are some requirements for these free radios though... so maybe they're not free. :)

* I will only ship to Canada.

* Buyer will pay actual shipping costs via pay pal prior to shipping.

* Shipping method will be by Canada Post (xpresspost, or regular parcel if you'd like).

* I will only ship to a registered amateur with a valid Canadian call sign (as verified in the RAC DB).

* I'd prefer these were given to new amateurs, or used as a door prize for a ham course or something.   Don't bother msg'ing me if you're just planning on ebaying them.

* All radios go together.

PM me if you're interested.

I attempted the general (which I hadn't really studied for, but my chemical engineer friend said there was a decent chance I could pass - I am working on completing my electrical engineering degree), but neglected to pass that.  SO, it's something to strive for now!

But, I'll be on a semi-limited budget until March 2014 (when my degree is completed).  

My biggest reasons for joining the ranks of hams is it's intrigued me for a while, I'm (going to be) an EE, tinkering/building is a fun hobby, and it sounds neato burrito.  Plus, I've worked with a number of hams before (at a previous internship I've had) and they recommended it.  

I'm going to be picking up a Yaesu FT-60R later Memorial Day week.  Gotta pick up my paycheck from work on Tuesday, so I'll order it at lunch.  :D  

I live in a small town (which has a repeater, still need to check it out a bit more) and there's a club that operates out of the nearest bigger city.  Plus, there is Louisville, but I haven't looked to see if they're more active.  But, if things go right, I'll be moving to New Albany, which is a bit closer.  ramble.

Anyways, my field of specialty is analog engineering, so I hope to eventually build my own shack, at least as far as I can.  I consider electromagnetics the devil, but I'll soon have to learn it, so ....  haha.  

But, the goal right now is to get the FT-60R, get some time under my belt on the airwaves (as much as I can), and start looking at what I can design/build myself, and how I can make things pretty sweet.  

I really like this community, by the way.  They definitely helped motivate me AND study/get a good feel for the ""culture.""

I might also get involved with Skywarn and ARES.  The region I'm living in now has a bad history of rough weather, so being able to help out (probably).  Need to figure out how to get a mobile rig going on my leased Corolla...  haha.

There are two contests going on, both digital, so I thought I'd just tune around and maybe give a contester or two a contact. As it happened I stumbled into a CW portion of 20-meters.

Much to my amazement the pattern of CQ just jumped out at me. I could actually copy that simple pair of letters.

Got fascinated and set FLDigi software to CW mode with the speaker on.

Within minutes (well maybe 40 minutes) I was hearing the code and copying it ahead of what appeared on my screen.

Yes, it's true, at least for this ham -- you never forget, even though it's been 20 years since I passed my (required back then) 13 wpm code test. 

I swore back then I'd never, ever, use Morse code after that rite of passage.  Never say never.

Oh yes, I cheated....used FLDigi to make a couple CW contacts just to make somebody happy. Then I began to wonder if all the CW I was hearing was machine-sent or hand-sent.  Listened a little more and found you can tell the difference. Hand sent has a rhythm, machine sent doesn't.

The guy, Mike I think was his name, was operating his radio when we arrived. He told me a little about it and it just blew my mind. I love electronics, especially older electronics. I have a particular interest in analog equipment, but thats another story.  

He told me I could learn and he would show me if I wanted. I took his number but never got around to calling him. He doesn't live in the area any more and I have been thinking a lot about it lately, only I don't know where to start. I understand that you need a FCC license to transmit but I do not know much about it or the equipment that is needed to start. I would just like to get my feet wet for now. Second hand equipment is in my future, I can see that now. There is no way I can afford some of the stuff Mike showed me. 
So just any advice, information, personal words, anything would be great. 
If I wanted to talk to a specific person, how would I do that? How much power is enough and how far will it reach? What is the science behind talking over extreme distances? What kind of interesting things can I discover? What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? Just anything. I really am completely fascinated. 

Tl;dr I want to try my hand at amateur radio and I really dont even know where to start. Looking for personal advice and information.

ham radio besides the obvious? (better wording

So through no exact reason I can remember I started looking up what you guys do. After reading about how to take the tests and the different setups people use and all of that I said to myself ""Well this seems really cool, maybe I should get started on this once I get a job."" 

Well after doing more research and going through that one site that allows you to listen in digitally to different frequencies I realized that all I heard people do was exchange callsigns and perhaps do some small chat about random things. 

So I decided to come to you guys because I KNEW there would be a subreddit dealing with this, and I went through about two months worth of postings and found nothing to the contrary of what I heard earlier, with the large exception of getting signals off of sats and having field days and whatnot.

So hams out there I ask as respectfully as I can as a person who has very little idea about what you do, is Amateur Radio just all about learning technical things, perhaps building or modifying your own equipment,talking with other hams across the globe, helping emergency broadcasts and public service? If so I completely understand but I must admit at the same time I'm slightly let down. I thought you would be able to broadcast a signal in a very small band much like a legalized pirate radio, but I've seen no posts about this.

Once again I mean no disrespect to you guys, I now know this hobby takes a lot to learn about and requires time and money to get into, I just was not able to find another post like this in the last month or so, and I figured I may as well ask before I just decide to listen in, instead of taking the plunge.

Two engineers offered to help by putting the one I made on an analyzer, and help me build it better with the remaining twinlead I have. Then another gave me this bombshell....I was telling him what I had planned to use it for, explained that the fishing line and weight was for throwing it up a branch, etc. He suggested that I take the weight off of it, get a helium balloon (of proper size) and use that to float the antenna with my RG58 lead to my radio.

My understanding is that direct communication between citizens  of the USSR and the citizens of the West (USA, in particular) was thought to be undesirable by the Soviet government (and vice-versa?). 

In the pre-internet days, I would imagine that amateur radio was one of the only (if not THE only) possible ways of no-middleman citizen-to-citizen correspondence across the Iron Curtain.

I was wondering if there might be anyone here that was around and active in the hobby during that time period. If so, what can you recall about how such contacts were conducted/regulated. Any strange stories to tell?

- R4
- R5

This is the 4th free book I've gotten from such promotions... I also got the most recent copy of the ARRL Operating Manual, Antenna Wire Classics Vol: 2, and the ARRL Emergency Communications handbook.

- Upgrade to extra.  This won't require much, just some studying time.  I was hoping to sneak it in by the end of the year, but no such luck!

- Improve my CW copying to the point where I can copy faster than I can send.  I've had a few CW elmers tell me that I'll eventually hit a plateau of sorts and I'll be able to copy much faster than I can send.  I can currently send @ 18wpm somewhat consistently, I'd be incredibly happy to copy at least that!

- Attend a Field Day, hopefully with NT1K, KB1RMA, and maybe even KF7IYQ.  I've only been licensed for two Field Days and I've had a wedding to attend both weekends.  My calendar is clear so far this year...  Otherwise, I may my nice canopy in my back yard, string up a dipole and operate with my KX3 from my deep cycle marine battery all weekend.  

- Achieve an award of some sort.  Likely WAS followed by DXCC.  I have many confirmations for WAS already, I can likely sked the remaining states.  DXCC will be a little more tricky, but I think if I pay closer attention to DX spots, I could pull it off in 2013.  I also think I can achieve shack sloth status for SOTA.  I do enjoy chasing!

- More antennas in the air.  I'm a bit weak in the E/W department, my current 80m double is oriented N/S and even though it's an inverted V, it's not very strong E/W.

- Complete a SOTA activation with my KX3.  The KX3's purchase was primarily driven to operate portable, so I need to get out there!  I have a few summits nearby, no 10 pointers, but they'd still be fun and it'd get my feet wet.

- Obtain a bug.  I have a straight key I really enjoy (though I would like a Navy Flame Proof), a nice paddle (a Begali), so I'd like the complete the collection with a bug of some sort that won't completely break the bank.

- Finally make that satellite contact.  I just ordered a Baofeng UV-5RE, maybe I'll grab Arrow's nice handheld yagi or put something together myself (or throw on a cheap 14"" whip antenna), but this was one of my goals last year and I never achieved it.  

So that's what I've come up with for now.  Last year seemed to be a lot of kit building and finding out where I want to go in the hobby.  This year feels a lot like I know where I want to go, I just need to level up (primarily in my CW) to get there.

Have a good holiday and new year everyone!  My wife's pregnant with twins and due by the end of January.  So I'll likely be going dark for quite some time.  This will definitely give me a late start on my goals but who knows, only time will tell!

Extras	31	6	15	"I posted a couple of days ago asking for some advice on a GPS tracker to go on a weather balloon.  You folks were helpful and encouraging as always, and a special thanks goes out to user WalterFStarbuck who offered helpful advice in the comments and in a personal message.

Contacting the FAA was a breeze, and those folks are very willing to work with you as long as you know the answers to their questions in advance.

* How high will the balloon go before bursting?
* What is the balloon's rate of assent? 
* What time will the balloon be launched, and what is the projected time when it will be down?
* Where is the balloon projected to land?
* What is the weight of the payload?
* Do you fall under F.A.R. 101?

Even though this balloon did not fall under F.A.R. 101, WalterFStarbuck advised me to contact them anyway, because no pilot should be surprised by a weather balloon and have to take evasive action to avoid it. I would also recommend this, because of how simple it was to file the NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), even though the provision covering weather balloons did not extend to balloons that have as light of payloads as mine (under 6 pounds).

Not everything went perfect though.  Sadly the radio I was using for APRS continued to use digipeaters even at a high altitude, which is certainly not necessary. The camera's batteries also died very early (~50,000 feet above sea level) because of the extreme cold.  The next time I do this I think I'll have extra batteries in the payload that are surrounded by hand warmers.  Sounds strange, but it might just do the trick. 

[Here is a link to the video the camera and balloon produced, for those interested.  It's only 3 minutes long, so be sure to view it in HD if you can.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IzGXDH3hJc)

If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to help out the community with an answer. If you've ever wanted to do something similar, I would highly recommend such a project.  It was a ton of fun, and it got a lot of people in my community interested in Amateur Radio."	t5_2qi86	True

1329526561.0	punmr	Absolute newb trying to figure out if ham radio is for him	Murloh	29	2	28	"I am trying to decide if the Ham Radio hobby is for me.  A bit on me:  I am totally a geek by nature.  I studied and worked with electronics for a couple of years many moons ago.  I then started my current career in IT professionally back in the late 90s.  

I've always been interested in ham radio.  I finally decided to start studying for my Technician Class license last week.  I am using the ARRL Ham Radio License Manual as well as some online resources.  I must admit, the technology strongly appeals to my geek side.  Learning about terms I've heard my entire life, but never truly understanding them too deeply like UHF, VHF, etc.  I am not sure why, but getting an official call sign just seems cool to me.  Oh, and the equipment, from what I have been researching is fascinating to me.   Radios, building a DYI antenna, etc etc.

From the forums, sites, and other online places I've been visiting the past couple of weeks about the hobby, the ham community in general seems like an awesome group of folks.  Very friendly, helpful, and supportive.  A long while ago, I worked with a ham and I remember him as one of the coolest people I know.  I've since lost touch with him.

So I was telling a buddy of mine about my interest in ham radio and that I was studying to get the Technical license.   He then asked me ""Sounds interesting, but is the whole point to just talk to random people?  You can sort of do that now with IRC can't you?""  And this got me to start second guessing myself...  

After I get the Technician Class license, and maybe the General Class license, then what?  What is an average day in the life of a ham really like?  Is the whole point to fire up the radio and talk to a random distant person?  I admit that I am rather introverted and likewise, quite terrible at small talk with strangers.  My biggest worry in the hobby is that after getting into and really enjoying the technical side of things, that the social aspect is not something for me. 

Any honest insight folks could share would be greatly appreciated!  

**TLDR: I am loving learning everything about ham radio, but I am concerned that the social aspect would cause me to lose interest.**

**EDIT01:** Wow, I'd first like to say a heart felt thank you to everyone that took the time to reply.  I've decided that I am, without any hesitation whatsoever now, going to pursue my Technician Class license and then on to the General Class license.  I didn't realize the hobby was so expansive and diverse with the examples so many people gave.  I now have some definite ideas on things to research and explore.  You guys really opened up my eyes here - again...  THANK YOU!

**EDIT02:** By all means, please do keep posting all these terrific diverse ideas!  I am willing to bet this can also help other newbies that were wondering the same thing as me as to the possibilities of fun stuff to do with ham radio.  I am seeing more and more those possibilities are endless.  I am even more excited now to get my licenses! "	t5_2qi86	True

1326244725.0	obnib	What's this, $7.00 to renew a license?	cymrufollies	29	4	39	"In the mail today came an official looking envelope stating, ""It's time to Renew!""  Inside there are official looking forms for my license renewal including my callsign, name, address, class of license, all of which is available at QRZ.com.  But, there's also a place to put in my credit card info to pay the $7.00 fee.

Then, in small print it says, ""neither this renewal card nor the NCVEC form 605 may be mailed to the FCC and is only acceptable when electronically submitted to the FCC by a VEC.

Now, here's what I know: license renewals from the FCC are free. You get them by going on line within 90 days of expiration (not before 90 days), you enter your information including a special FCC number which is kinda hard to find and you're done.

Close scrutiny shows that the mailing came from W5YI VEC Inc. and it came a month before the 90 day window, thus giving lie to the ""time to Renew!"" notice printed in bold type on the front of the envelope.

It looks to me as though W5YI is offering to use their electronic link to the FCC database to generate a little profit from those amateurs who either don't know how to use the FCC site or are too lazy to do it themselves.

I have no complaint with this tactic except that it seems a bit slimy. If W5YI really had good intentions it would have included a paragraph stating that an individual could do the same thing for free by going to the FCC website. Obviously, there's a good reason for W5YI not to do that -- mainly because it would hurt their sales.

This post is not meant as a slam to W5YI, they do good work administering the tests. It's just to point out that their way isn't the only way to renew a license. Oh, and for the [lazy](http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=cft&amp;id=amateur&amp;page=cft_renew_amateur).

While on campus I finished the hardware for a new balloon tracker. But I had to move to Seattle for a summer internship. The hardware was ready to go but the software for the microcontroller (MSP430F438) wasn't. I needed to test if my AX.25 +NZRI packetization code was valid.

At first I looked up the nearest APRS i-gater (which was 2.5 mi away) and biked there with the tracker. Nothing was getting picked up, so I contacted the operator and asked him if he had observed anything. Turned out he didn't have any 1200 baud equipment. Bummer.

I had brought my Baofeng radio with me just for kicks so I decided to try to use that to debug my packets. I downloaded the APRSDroid android app and set the radio speaker close to the phone mic, but that didnt work. I then plugged the headset that comes with the radio into it and set the earphone really close to the phone mic just to see if that would work by the off chance. I got surprised when it did. I was able to decode APRS packets picked up by the UV-5R with this setup. I know the ideal way would have been to make a direct cable connection but I didn't have a car to go to a radioshack or the tools to fabricate it.

I was able to finish up the code for the tracker and shipped it back to my team in Ann Arbor. The tracker can send out position reports, receive DTMF commands and send GSM text reports on the ground. It made its maiden flight on Aug 1st. Except for a slight hiccup of a GPS lock at 40,000 ft (now fixed with a simple command) everything worked flawlessly.

---------

I remember getting my ham license back in 1992. I was 13 years old, and the thought of using 2-way radios to talk to other people had always fascinated me. I found myself intrigued by the “professionalism” of the Hams, not to mention the fact that hams got to play with seriously cool equipment (repeaters, huge antennas, auto-patch systems, and tons more!). It was real ego boost to be able to pick up a ham radio in any given location and make a phone call, talk to emergency personnel, or ask for assistance from a fellow him if your car broke down. There were practical reasons to have a ham radio license and carry a radio.

These days, the internet and cell phones have all but eliminated any of the traditional arguments on why ham radio is so important. Your cell phone will get you out of most any sticky situation, and the internet lets you talk to ‘strangers’ from all over the world without even trying. The trend is pretty clear when you get on the air, too. It’s extremely unusual to meet anyone under the age 60. (Interestingly, the same age group that’s been the slowest to adopt the internet).

So what’s the point?  Ham Radio is the Past, Present, and Future of Wireless Innovation

There are a number of people out there who really are genuinely interested in RF (Radio Frequency) engineering. You have Ham Radio enthusiasts to thank for nearly every major modern advance in radio and electronics over the last 100 years. For example, the inventor of the integrated circuit (present in pretty much anything that has a button or a display today) says his love of electronics was because of his early involvement in ham radio. Current wireless technologies, such as WiFi, cell phones, wireless 3G and 4G, satellite communications, and much, much more all have their roots in ham radio. With very few exceptions, the engineers who are inventing and advancing the world of wireless technologies got their start, and their inspirations, from the ham world. If you’re the kind of person who loves to experiment with technology, you’ll find the ham radio world provides a never- ending supply of “I wonder what would happen if........” scenarios, built around a community of fellow engineers who are always inventing new and interesting ways of experimenting with radio technology.

For those who are genuinely interested in a career (or a hobby) developing new wireless technologies, ham radio is currently he –only- legal way for the average person to experiment, learn, grow, and innovate. The FCC is very protective of this field (for various reasons), so for the sake of future innovation, ham radio provides a critical bridge between having an interest in the field, and creating new technologies for commercial purposes.

What about Emergency Preparedness?

Emergency preparedness is the other “foot in the door” that continues to provide a lot of attention to the hobby. Unlike nearly all commercial communications systems, ham radio has no dependency on terrestrial infrastructure that can fail. Ham radio operators played a critical role during recent disasters, such as Katrina, 9/11, and the 2003 North American blackout, where normal communications systems were either completely down, or overwhelmed. And it wasn’t just voice and morse code, hams set up wireless computer networks to relay large amounts of information digitally as well. When the grid went down, ham radio took its place.

Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as “get your ham license, and you’ll be ready for an emergency!”

In 1993, the FCC eliminated the requirement to learn morse code in order to get a ham radio license. It caused a massive influx of new (younger) people to get their ham radio licenses. But the majority of these new licensees weren’t interested in ham radio, they were interested in emergency preparedness. Most people who got their license around this theme realized the whole “ham thing” was much more complex than they realized and quickly lost interest. Even today, the vast majority of people passing their entry-level ham test are joining for the same (wrong) reasons, and like their predecessors from nearly 20 years ago, it isn’t taking long before they realize they’re in over their heads and they go back to focusing on their real hobby (emergency preparedness).

It’s a little like buying yourself a shiny new jet with the intent to eventually become a pilot. The airplane looks pretty impressive sitting in your driveway, until you realize that simply owning the airplane doesn’t mean you know how to operate it. It takes years of training and experience before you can actually fly – and if, during those years of training, you realize that you’re actually not that interested in the science of aviation, you’re going to get bored long before you ever learn to fly your new jet.

I mention this only to acknowledge that, while emergency communications is an important element of ham radio, it’s a very misunderstood topic. Those who are providing real assistance during emergencies are veterans of the hobby, and not those who have a license and a radio tucked away in a box. I would argue that, for those who are not sincerely interested in the technical side of the hobby, there are likely no benefits related to emergency preparedness.

Regardless, emergency preparedness remains a popular pillar of support for the hobby from the FCC and from congress. When things don’t go as planned, leave it to a group of guys who eat, sleep, and breathe ingenuity to come up with a solution.

Conclusion

Are there any other practical uses for ham radio in the 21st century? Given the massive proliferation of the internet and cell phones of this day and age, the answer is “probably not.”. But for those who love camping (as opposed to staying in a hotel), you understand that there can be a certain appreciation for “getting back to the basics”. Mountain climbers don’t climb the mountain because it needs to be done, they do it because the mountain presents a challenge. A NASCAR driver has but one purpose in a race: To prove that his skills and the engineering abilities of his team are superior. Ham radio operators will tell you that the accomplishments of making an “over the air” contact are a direct reflection of their own engineering prowess, and the next challenge always awaits. “Can I do it again with less power? A smaller antenna?”.

It’s sad that the ham community, the same folks who pride themselves on their ability to communicate, has done such a poor job of getting this message in front of the rising generation. This is a group of kids who have been solving complex problems since before they could read and write (video games, computers, the internet, cell phones). For the sake of the future of American innovation, I sincerely hope we can figure out a way to make sure the message is understood: Ham radio is simply a great way to challenge yourself with state of the art science and communications technology. It is generally nothing more, and it is definitely nothing less.

1374929928.0	1j5p8v	Proposal - Reddit SSB calling frequencies	whozurdaddy	27	3	30	"Hi folks,  as some others here have pointed out, calling CQ doesnt seem to get the responses that a new person would hope for anymore.  Thats been my experience anyway so far.  Id like to propose a set of standard CQ calling frequencies for Redditors (and non-Redditors alike)  I say ""set"" because naturally some freqs may be occupied, bands may be noisy, etc.  Maybe a couple for each band.

I think it would also be great to help newer General class licensees get started and make contacts.  One of my most enjoyable contacts was actually prearranged online here.  What do you guys think?  Once we have a few, perhaps the mod could list them in the right side bar.   We should also check them against [known net frequencies](http://www.n1yz.com/HFNET_LIST.HTM) to be sure we do not overlap with those activities. 

**EDIT**:  Ok, after a few responses, here's some proposed frequencies:

40 meters: (preferred)

7.207.50 Mhz

20 meters: (secondary when above is congested or noisy)

14.335.50 Mhz

10 meters: (when open &amp; technician class)

28.440 Mhz

Rationale:  The first two are within the General-class license area.  Both are also viewable with [this](http://w4ax.com/index.html) web SDR in case you want to monitor the frequencies via a waterfall display. (He is in Atlanta though).  Im a little concerned about the 20 meter selection as I dont want to interfere with SSTV broadcasts, but lets see how that works out.  For 10 meters, when it is open, fits not only within General, but also Technician SSB.  I agree with TrouserPudding on the 80 meter issue, so let's leave that to the standard Reddit net.

We welcome more comments.  Ill check again later tonight and pitch it to the mods if this seems favorable to everyone.


(BTW - if you use the Web SDR for monitoring, there is a squelch checkbox so you can sit idle and let it run without listening to noise)

**UPDATE**:

I think we have consenus to move forward.  Hopefully the mods will post these up on the sidebar.  For now, feel free to start calling CQ on these frequencies.  Ill be monitoring :)"	t5_2qi86	True

I'm a younger ham, an EE student, and I'm really itching to get more involved. But the last few months of my attempts have left me thinking it's no wonder there aren't young people picking up the mic.

I'm in Chicago right now for the summer, and I may hear the same 3-4 people on any one of a dozen repeaters, and only every couple of days. I key up and rarely is there anyone that isn't just looking to talk to their pal. Now all right, I hear you saying it: ""Don't let 2m HT operations get you down. Go find the fun in HF!""

Problem is I can't find a radio in my budget. It seems like everyone I've found selling a radio - especially locally - is retired and won't accept anything less than MSRP for their 5-10 year old used radio. Why are resale values on HF-band radios so unrealistically high? I literally had someone tell me today that he couldn't part with his radio for anything other than just under retail price because he was on social security and living on savings. Not exactly reassuring. Granted I've been looking for HF/VHF/UHF from the last 10 years, but even some of the older HF-band gear is on the higher end of what I could convince myself to pay as a student.

Please convince me that this isn't the complete reality of ham operations. I know it isn't! The hams I've met at school and at work are just as down-to-earth and realistic as they are passionate about the hobby. What's a guy to do?

I'm just sick of every factor imaginable between cost, lack of operators, and the age of the ones around driving me away from 'traditional' ham operations. Of course there aren't any young people! No one is making it very easy!

Now I could always go around and tinker in SHF/EHF/THF-world, but it's awfully hard to get to microwave without even having learned to work the more historically prevalent bands.

I realize this is awfully ranty, but I'm rather frustrated. Trying to make it work somehow."	t5_2qi86	True
1371500615.0	1gjdt3	Hunting RFI	cymrufollies	27	3	6	"While passing through the HF bands I noticed a strange bit of RFI. It was a rhythmical pulse of noise and it was everywhere. So rhythmical I first thought it was a noisy fan.

Out comes the Grundig portable radio and a tour of the likely suspect: the power lines. Oddly they were quiet, it was my house that was radiating.

Inside the house the noise picked up everytime I came near an electrical outlet. Next step was to start isolating circuits by switching them off and on.

But then, it was especially noisy near an outlet that had 1) a telephone answerer and 2) a phone. Both were powered by wall warts.

The clue was the answerer. It blinked the number of messages in sync with the noise pulses. How could a low power device be doing that?

Aaaha...In the same power strip there was a lamp whose plug wasn't quite in the socket. There it was: a loose connection adjacent to a transformer/rectifier that was drawing current in a rhythmical fashion.

Problem solved simply be firmly plugging in the lamp.

Just goes to show that best and sometimes the only way to isolate RFI is through simple elimination, luck and looking in the most unlikely of places."	t5_2qi86	True

1332393712.0	r7zjw	Have any of you folks ever been able to sense a transmission directly?  I've had an odd experience recently.		26	1	38	"About two months ago I suddenly realized I was hearing a bit of a strange sound in my ear.  It had the same 'presence' as tinnitus, which I do suffer from occasionally, but was much lower, probably in the 800-1200Hz range, and was randomly alternating between two tones...like someone twiddling their fingers randomly between two keys on a electric keyboard.  It does this three to five times per second.

Since then I've noted a few more things.

1 - it comes and goes (same as tinnitus, no big deal)

2 - it always has the same two pitches

3 - it seems to be louder in portions of the home (which could be quieter, who knows)

Two weeks ago it was quite loud in my ear while I was in my basement, so I killed the mains thinking it might have been a bit of electronics.  However, it didn't stop, and I listened to it for about five minutes (in my head).  It just kept on.

Anyway, fast forward to this past Saturday.  I've recently been smitten by the capabilities of software defined radios (hence my other question in here).  This, in turn, rekindled a long standing interest in ham radio.  I've been studying and tinkering, and something told me to go grab an old CB my wife bough for me 15 years ago that was still in the original box (Cobra 19 Ultra^II and a weird window antenna).  So I hook it up to a booster battery that I have and start surfing through the channels. 

When I got to channel 34, my heart skipped a beat.  LOUD AND CLEAR was that same twiddling sound.  The pitch was just slightly different,  but the cadence was identical and it was very clear.  Only on channel 34, and all of the surrounding stations are completely quiet.   I visited it the following day, still there.

Tonight, thinking that it might be interesting to post in here to see if anyone else had similar experiences, I listened hard for the sound while in the basement.  Nothing.  Upstairs, different rooms, nothing.  Writing it off as temperamental, I fired up the CB to record a small sample to see if anyone might be able to identify it.  Of course, the sound is gone.   (Mostly, you can hear faint clicks of the same cadence, but no tones)

I am trying to find a way to fix it so that I can mitigate/elevate the problems.  Our houses are bout 12 feet apart and his tower (for now) is between them.  He plans to move it in the spring but I am concerned that something is gonna break before then.  I have talked to him and I am picking up some chokes to hopefully take care of the phone issues and he has been helpful, but I am kind of hoping that some of you guys have experienced the same type problems and can suggest what I might do.  The problem list:

* Alarm system has tripped once if not twice because of the broadcasts.  I have seen the lights on the panel flicker to the correspond with broadcasts
* Broadcasts cause the air circulation fan on my furnace to shut down
* The central vacuum will come on at random times when he is on
* Lights are slightly flickering, it's as if it is because of power draw there is probably nothing that I can do about his one
* Phones are all picking him up both wired and wireless.

**Videos**

* http://youtu.be/KyqSwuuD_ko - Furnace issues (sound is coming from my computer speakers)
* http://youtu.be/8saBvirh58g - Broadcast being picked up by alarm system and coming out smoke detectors

So the main thing I am really worried about is our furnace as it can't be good for it to repetitively fire like it is.  What essentially is happening the exhaust fan comes on, the burner fires then the air circulation fan comes on.  If the air circulation fan shuts down like it has been, the furnace then turns off the burner  and exhaust fan, waits for a minute or two then tries the whole process again.  The alarm system is also distressing because I feel that I am going to have to take it offline until he moves the tower and that bothers me for obvious reasons.

**TLDR**: Neighbour is a amateur radio operator and his broadcasts are messing with my furnace, phones, alarm system, central vac and power.  I am looking for operators who have solved these issues in their own homes.

**EDIT 1**
The antenna in question is a fan dipole.

**EDIT 2**
For those that have asked I have been working with him he is not being an ass about this.  I turned to you guys because of your hundreds of years of cumulative experience.

I had a post in shortwave about this before I realized this was the proper subreddit.  I forgot to mention that I am able to hear him when I have my headphones on with my iphone when it is plugged into the wall adapter but not when I pull it from the wall.  So could it be a grounding issue?

**EDIT 5**

I sent the scammer my money via PayPal and I've been working with them for a resolution. It looks like they're going to come through for me (and hopefully everyone else) in getting our money back, but even still I'd much prefer to have never been scammed to begin with.

1359424874.0	17gvze	Am I Missing Something?	unrustlable	25	2	35	"I've had my Technician license for about a year now. I was given some hand-me-down equipment from a relative who's been into ham radio for decades. I've been hitting up local repeaters and checking in on local nets with a Wouxun handheld, and it's comforting to know I have means of communicating a good 50 miles in any direction in the event of an emergency (my main reason for getting into radio; I've been participating in relaying local weather conditions on skywarn nets, and the local club will likely be working on ARES training this year). 

My big question is about enjoying amateur radio as a hobby. I've met the local club members, and they are very nice, informative, and helpful people, but I feel like I'm missing out on something. I'll acknowledge a massive age gap against the average operator as I'm 24, and I'm sure that there is a bit of lacking common ground. Another bit of trouble I've noticed is that a lot of conversations I stumble on while going through the nearby repeaters are just about what kind of new gear people have gotten and how much better things sound or how much farther they go. I guess it's a bit analogous to a video gaming club where all people talk about is their custom-built PCs rather than video games. It's a bit hard to wrap my head around it at times, especially since I'm not yet well-versed in digital, can barely do some CW, not licensed or equipped for DX, etc. 

I acknowledge that this may or may not be representative of the worldwide amateur radio community, and I mean no disrespect by it. However, despite the immense amount of fun people have with this hobby, I feel that I'm missing out on some community-based aspect of it. 

Have I been extremely out of the loop on this, or do a lot of new operators get this bit of a rocky start?

Edit: I appreciate everyone's input. It's pretty obvious that I need to up my game and go for HF. I'll keep up with it and hope that I can make some more contacts farther away. "	t5_2qi86	True

I have a pretty terrible portable antenna. I don't remember the name of it now, but it doesn't matter because it doesn't work well indoors. I know next to nothing about electronics and antenna design. I took my general a few years ago and the material I learned from the class is long gone. 

What I want to do is work on WAS (phone) on 20m, and then start branching out towards DXCC. I'm working on learning CW and (again) I know next to nothing about digital modes, but I'd be willing to give that a shot.

Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to ask is what should I do to finally get on the air? I'm looking for apartment antenna suggestions (in case it matters I'm on the ground floor of a 3 story apartment) and advice on operating modes (should I start with voice, or explore digital, or get CW learned?).

&gt; The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library. Its purposes include offering permanent access for researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities, and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections, and provides specialized services for adaptive reading and information access for the blind and other persons with disabilities. 

This morning he was Twittering about needing some help archiving some old Ham Radio magazines.  I figure we could crowd source some talent here and all reap the benefits of having a nice archive of a really cool magazine with some great content!  

So here are the instructions from Jason...

&gt; I figure it's best to assign a person a year at a time (12 issues), and see if they like this.

&gt; The main collection url is [http://www.archive.org/details/ham-radio-magazine](http://www.archive.org/details/ham-radio-magazine) and the template for what I've typed in is at: [http://www.archive.org/details/1968-12-hamradiomag](http://www.archive.org/details/1968-12-hamradiomag)

&gt; As you can see, I made the title: Ham Radio Magazine Vol. 1 No. 10.  And then I made the description by typing in the contents page. Page numbers not needed, just article, author and getting stuff in general order as best I could.

&gt; All I'd need is a textfile or e-mail from you with the title, then the description, then an empty line, then the next one. I'll do the rest of the work of getting it into the site.

With that said - anyone up for the task?  You can browse through and find a year, claim that year and proceed.  Your finished text file can be sent to jason@textfiles.com.  Also include that you're from Reddit via /r/amateurradio

Please comment if you're going to claim a year, and I will go ahead and update it below so we don't have two people doing the same work.  And if you're finished, follow up and I can update that as well.  I need to get to work so I'll see what's available when I get home and pick up a year myself and go from there.

Don't hesitate to ask questions (or move on if you're not interested :)).

1335124790.0	sn0rb	CW Encouragement -- An Update	zerobeat	22	2	7	"I thought I would provide an update to when [I asked for encouragement in learning CW](http://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/s0vbg/need_encouragement_share_your_cw_experiences/).  I kept the character speed up high but increased the spacing (25wpm char speed, 7wpm spacing) and it suddenly became much easier to learn.

A few days ago, N4CNC did a scheduled CW QSO with me on 40m.  Kept it slow with wide character spacing and made sure to stay in touch online between messages to make sure we understood where our mistakes were.  This was a vast improvement over my very first CW QSO many years ago where I was so nervous that I never picked it up again and ended up being exactly what I needed to feel comfortable calling CQ on my own.

I've made more than a half dozen CW QSOs since then and am making sure to have at least one a day.  The people I have conversed with have been incredibly accepting and have slowed down, repeated things as often as I needed, and understood all the mistakes I've made.  It turned out I didn't have to copy perfectly -- the first few (and one of the QSOs with the person using a straight key) look like a Wheel of Fortune puzzle early on, but the general message still got through.  One QSO I managed to only copied the RST and callsign as I tripped up on everything else, but I didn't get frustrated and turn off the radio -- just kept going and sent back what I could.

For anyone out there that is learning or wants to learn, it is absolutely worth it.  It isn't easy, but once you can mostly copy W1AW slow code broadcasts or your practice material you should get on the air.  Schedule a QSO with someone here for your first one to get your feet wet -- you'll be absolutely hooked.  I'm genuinely surprised by how much fun it has turned out to be!"	t5_2qi86	True

1322176620.0	mobr4	My country's ham radio laws are RIDICULOUS.	gui77	25	2	34	"Hey guys! I live in Portugal and, as I've learned more and more about amateur radio and its community from this subreddit and a couple other sites, I was totally stoked and ready to jump in - I was super excited. So, I tried to find clubs/organizations near me - but there aren't any very close, and I don't have my own transportation which makes it even harder.

But I decide to take the exam, so I look up the rules and procedures and laws. After AGES of piecing together information from multiple website's (the national regulator's site is very confusing for a beginner), I finally understand the laws. Here are a couple of the rules:
* After I take the exam (which costs 50euros), I need a license, which is 20 more euros. This license needs to be renewed yearly.
* If I pass - the test now required 80% correct answers - I become a category 3. As a 3, I CAN ONLY RECEIVE (wtf!) during 2 entire years. I cannot transmit anything, on any bands. The only exception is if I use someone else' station with them present, which for me isn't possible.

I think this is absolutely ridiculous - has anyone else stumbled unto such laws? This pretty much means that, even if I pass, I won't be able to transmit anything for 2 entire years... which isn't very motivating. I'm not sure if I should get a radio and listen in anyway, or maybe get a radio with PMR446 bands (446.*, which is license-free in the EU) like a cheapo baofeng uv3r, which has been spoken about a lot lately, or something of the sort.

I think one of my problems has been that a lot of CW training programs drill you on block of random letters. I get bored pretty quickly decoding what looks like Enigma code! Plus, with random blocks of letters, you really don't have an opportunity to guess at any missing letters.

I am listening to the ARRL Learn CW audio files in my car and at home, so I'm using their sequence to create my audio files.

So here is my procedure:
-the first block of letters in the ARRL course are aerntiosdhc. If found one of those Scrabble cheater websites that generates a list of words from a set of letters.

-I copy the words I want to a text file, and use the G4FON software to generate a CW .wav file using the settings I want. (I have the letters sent at 15wpm but an overall code speed of 5wpm). 

-I convert the .wav file to .mp3 using LAME.

-For extra fun, the G4FON software can generate files with QRM(nearby signals), QSB (fading), and adjustable noise levels.

I only have the first block of letters done and converted to .mp3, here is the link to a public folder on my Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B954XllxZcudTnJhZ1M2R2RkR3M&amp;usp=sharing

These were selling in dayton for listed price. Anyone else get one?
Here are some things I have learned about it thus far:

Pros:
 * For the coverage and other features, the price is unmatched.
 * Internals are very well constructed.
 * Receive sensitivity is surprisingly good.
 * More compact than an FT-817.

Cons:
 * Audio isn't that great. Turn it up too high and it's very distorted.
 * The ""optimized filters"" ranges are not where they should be.
 * BFO offsets were off by 100hz. Easily changed via settings menu.
 * The supposed CAT control does not work at all.

Firmware is held on an STC12C5A32S2. STC is a Chinese IC design company and the chip is an enhanced 8051 based microcontroller with 64K internal flash memory. It supports ISP, so I ordered 10 of these chips and got a free USB programmer. My current theory is the CAT control is either nonexistent or currently disabled. There is no known method/software to perform firmware updates for this radio yet, so only time will tell. As such, I have taken it upon myself to start digging into this firmware as there are many features this radio is capable of that are not being taken advantage of due to primitive firmware."	t5_2qi86	True

I deploy to my bedroom and establish [a small qrp station on my nightstand](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rasteenb/6838636597/).  I string an end-fed-half-wave (EFHW) antenna out the window to a nearby tree.  

The station was working well until yesterday when suddenly all signals were replaced by S9+ noise across all bands.  It was horrible and threatened to destroy all fun for awhile.  

So today I turned off all the breakers.  The noise disappeared.  Then I asked my wife go out to our breaker box and begin turning them on one at a time.  Eventually we hit paydirt and the horrible noise returned.

Having isolated the circuit, I eventually traced the source to my son's laptop power supply.  We'd replaced the original supply awhile ago (it died), but I hadn't set up a nightstand radio station since.  I swapped his power supply with the one on my wife's computer (on a different circuit), and all was well.  That was awesome and I was very happy to be back on the air.

Now that the year is winding down, how about we follow up?  I'll go first.

&gt; Become proficient in CW (aiming for my first CW QSO in the March/April timeframe)

Goal somewhat met.  My copying isn't proficient, but I'm proficient enough that I'm not too shy to get on the air in the CW portion of the bands.  I've worked many CW stations, with both a paddle and a straight key.  My sending is decent but copying is still rough and has been the hurdle holding me back.  I'm hoping to participate in the ARRL CW Rookie Roundup in December.

&gt; Build a bunch of kits (Softrock, Rock-mite, SW+, ScQRPion Black Widow Paddle[1] )

Success!  I built a Rockmite40, Softrock RX Ensemble II, and a Hendricks SOTA Tuner.  This was likely the most rewarding part of 2012.  Especially with the SMT work on the Softrock.  I have a lot more confidence in kit building now and I hope to have many more in my future.  I'd love to build a Steve Weber MTR!  

&gt; Make a CW contact with above built kits

No dice.  Despite building the Rockmite40, I didn't have a resonant antenna for 40m.  I was able to get spotted on the reverse beacon network, but I didn't want to blow the finals and ruin it.  My primary HF rig has an internal ATU, and I didn't want to spend money on a tuner.  So I had my fun with the build and sold it to another ham who has made many successful contacts with it.  The Softrock was a fun and lengthy build for me, I took my time with it.  But with the lack of decent SDR applications on OSX and a KX3 coming my way (with I/Q out), I too sold the Softrock.  I built the SOTA tuner (a half wave end fed tuner) and used it for portable CW work with a YouKits HB1A - which have also been sold.

&gt; Portable/QRP operation. Maybe a SOTA[2] activation or two

Success.  [I blogged about it here](http://w2mdw.blogspot.com/2012/07/w2mdwp-activating-lake-nebo.html).  A single contact and he was roughly 20mi away, if that!  But it was fun anyway and instilled that I really wanted to always have a portable setup.  Also - no SOTA activations (yet) but I did just pass 200 chaser points.  Well on my way to becoming a shack sloth!

&gt; Start attending local club meetings. I started off strong when I got licensed last year but quickly faded. Though topics were often a bit stale or the meetings were for voting for various officer positions and such.

Womp womp.  Busy summer with four weddings.   I didn't make a single meeting and I had a wedding on field day.  Though I do keep an eye on meeting schedules and I'll make attempts when I can.

&gt; Make a satellite contact (something that caught my eye to get me into the hobby and then sat on the back burner as I explored the rest of the hobby)

I've done some listening but no successful QSOs.  Though I have a love/hate relationship with VHF/UHF and I don't want to put much money into it as HF has all of my interesting.  So I'd still like to talk through the birds but this has gotten pretty low my list.

And finally, not on my list but I finally ditched the G5RV which made many people happy.  I put up an 80m doublet and saw significant performance improvements.  Thanks for pushing me in that direction KB1RMA, NT1K, KF7IYQ!

So how did you do in 2012?  Any additions to your stations?  Significant DX worked?  License upgrades?  Antenna work?

Different hams seem to have different ideas of what Field Day is about.  Some see the event as primarily a contest, and have the view that there's not much point in doing it if you're not going to try to get a lot of points.  Others see the event primarily as an emergency preparedness event, and want to get out and practice deploying in the field, with emergency power, and show that the can make things work in an emergency.  Still others focus primarily on the event as a public outreach, and almost everyone wants to just get out and have a good time.

Unfortunately the different ideas that different groups have about what Field Day should be sometimes cause friction.  A contester may become frustrated that others don't want to operate all night, or that the group doesn't have the most up-to-date contest logging software, or that the techniques used are not optimized to get more contacts faster.  A non-contester, say an emergency guy, may not care about any of that - he's as happy with 50 contacts as he is with 500, because he's shown that he can do what he needs to do in an emergency.  He may not see any need to make himself uncomfortable by operating into the wee hours.  He may feel annoyed by the complaints of the contesters who want him to do a bunch of things he doesn't think are valuable or fun.

As for myself, it seems to me that everyone should do what they find fun and valuable, and not complain that others don't enjoy the same things.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working out that way for us.

Hey all. It's been an exhausting week... It's about 1 AM, and I'm not entirely sure I'm quite coherent enough to be writing this, but I was so excited to get this and I had to tell you.

So I started stuffing [the board](http://i.imgur.com/TvOpY.jpg) exactly one week ago. Solder paste and hot air pencils are the way to go, let me tell you. After the power supply, the FPGA was the first major component to go down. It was a hairy few hours of checking each pin under the microscope and clearing solder bridges, but I was confident there were no shorts. Plug it in, and get magic smoke. FPGA was rotated 90 degrees.

Replaced it with a new Spartan 6, and dented $15 in my wallet. Yow. Me and my cousin practically leaped for joy when the chip showed up in the JTAG scan.

Next down was the FTDI chip to handle communications between the FPGA and the Computer. I sent 0x00 to 0xff to the computer to make sure it was working, but oddly enough, there was some strange issue. 0x00 to 0x3F would go just fine, and then it would jump to 0xC0 and repeat three times.

Turns out there was a bridge between data[7] and data[6], so 0x40 turned into 0xC0. Rats... I cleared the bridge, but I'd already blown the data pin on my FPGA. I almost cried myself to sleep. The next morning, however, I remembered my ADC was 14-bit, so I'd need two clock cycles on the 8-bit bus (now 7-bit) to transfer the data across. Come to think of it... nothing's changed really. Except I don't trust that bank on my FPGA anymore...

Today I slapped down the ADC. This part was perhaps the trickiest, because I had no real way to sit and verify small parts of the chip worked. It was all or nothing, and a $47.00 all or nothing at that. Quite nervous.

My surface mount skills had significantly improved however, and the chip miraculously worked the first time. Well, most of it. I was only transmitting the seven most significant bits to the computer for lack of time to write the verilog to properly transfer of data.

Anywho. The next big test is to hook it up to the antenna at my university's ham radio shack, and see if I can pull in some radio waves! But maybe I want to show this to my professor first... that way if a lightning bolt shoots out of the clear blue sky and destroys my project, I might still get a passing grade.

I'll keep you all posted to what comes out from this. Thanks for being part of my inspiration to continue with this project! I probably won't be able to answer any questions right now... but I promise I'll come back when the semester's over and wrap this whole thing up!"	t5_2qi86	True

1322737864.0	mw0xd	Looking for a LF Through-the-earth transceiver (cave radio)	dgriffith	21	1	17	"Greetings all,

I work in an underground mine in the comms section. We have a couple of means of communication - a leaky feeder VHF system and a VLF system running at 376Hz (""PED""). The leaky only works if you can see the cabling, the PED works through-rock for 500 metres or so, but it's one-way text only, very slow, and depends on a 15km loop antenna run through the mine that might not survive any serious catastrophe. There's no guarantee that the leaky feeder system would still be in one piece after an accident either - if personnel are trapped in an area, it's quite likely the feeder cable would have been damaged as well.

So I'm looking for a pair of LF cave radios for TTE testing for emergency use. Distance between units only has to be a few hundred metres. I've seen info on the ""HeyPhone"" and ""Nicola System"" units that run at about 87-100kHz, and the Siemens TEDRA units, but while there's plenty of info from 5 years ago, none of them seem to be available anymore. 

Alas, my skills are rusty and I'm always busy dealing with other stuff, so the general ""build it yerself"" response means I'll probably be retired before it's done!

I would like to have a couple for testing throughout our orebody, even if it's just to satisfy my curiosity.  So does anyone know of any commercial manufacturers (or *sigh* up to date kits/schematics) of any such gear? 

Edit: Some Links to stuff - 

[CREG home page](http://bcra.org.uk/creg/) - useful info in here, even if not updated recently.

The [HeyPhone](http://bcra.org.uk/creg/heyphone/) - Simple 87kHz USB with earthed electrodes for antenna.

The [Nicola System I/II/III](http://nicola.sssi.fr/spip.php?rubrique13) - I/II are similar to the HeyPhone, III is much more complex. Needs a bluetooth headset.... digital transmission, seems a bit fiddly. (And project stalled?)

Siemens [TEDRA](http://www.barrabes.com/tedra/EN/home.asp) - Designed by a university group, backed by Siemens. Still waiting on a response from Siemens..... the site selling them says they're no longer available.

Ultra Electronics [RockPhone](http://www.ultra-ms.com/capabilities/through-the-earth-communication/rockphone.html)  - Uses a loop antenna centred at 5kHz (?) with digital voice/data, limited range.

My elmer turned me on to a GREAT deal on a well taken care of older FT-817 (non ND version). After all I had read here and elsewhere about avoiding QRP rigs, especially SSB QRP, I was prepared for the worst. I got home this afternoon, switched the coax over to the 817 and heard ""Contest! Contest!"". So being the fool I am, I jumped right in! Sure as anything, contacts right off the bat. Sure the ZZ2T struggled a bit to copy my callsign, but he got it. 4235 miles, 5watts, during a contest, with an SFI number of only 112. XE3/K5ENS got me right on the first call.

4235 miles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok9GvHyREGM
1250 miles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR5UHnlGbgw

Although my antenna is not anything like world class, it is pretty decent. It's been said before, but your antenna is just as important as your rig, maybe even a bit more so.

These low power rigs can be had pretty cheaply. A tricked out FT-817 can be had for &lt;$500. In my case way less than $500. Icom and TenTec also have made some great low power HF rigs but the model names escape me right now.

The point is, don't be put off by not being able to afford a megabuck rig. Get into the QRP thing, get a good antenna, and have fun!

Are there drawbacks to QRP? Sure! Do I feel a lot more pumped talking to Brazil with 5watts instead of my usual 100? You bet.

Syria's recent [forced withdrawal from the internet](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/30/syria-internet-outage-how-it-happened/) is astonishing. CloudFlare suspects that 3 undersea cables and 1 overland cable would have all had to have been severed. It seems the Syrian government pulled the plug to prevent the rest of the world from seeing the chaos and tragedy they're bringing upon Syrian citizens.  Landlines and mobile phones also took a hit. 

Last time a middle-eastern country lost their internet access, there were [reports of shortwave radio usage.]( http://mobile.news.com.au/breaking-news/ham-operator-reveals-us-psyops-broadcast/story-e6frfku0-1226025610252) Will we hear anything on the ham bands out of Syria?

It seems Syrian's have leveled up, smuggling in satellite communications hardware and using Skype to communicate to the outside world. However, once the Government tracks them down with help from Iran, they may resort to more primitive measures. 

Another bit of news comes out of Mexico. A [report]( http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/zeta-radio/?utm_source=Contextly&amp;utm_medium=RelatedLinks&amp;utm_campaign=Previous) says the Zeta drug cartel has been kidnapping and enslaving engineers to build their extensive radio network.[ (link 1)]( http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/12/cartel-radio-mexico/) [ (link 2) ]( http://m.yahoo.com/w/legobpengine/news/mexicos-cartels-build-own-national-radio-system-200251816.html?orig_host_hdr=news.yahoo.com&amp;.intl=US&amp;.lang=en-US) Most of the engineers have come from an IBM facility within the country and are held  until their duty is complete, a duty from which they may never return alive.

The network is always in flux, and is very stealthy.

1350616828.0	11q97n	Have you ever heard yourself?	zerobeat	23	3	11	"I'd always heard the story that with really good propagation and luck on HF that operators can hear an echo of themselves a split second later if they are fast enough with the mic key or their CW rig has full break in:  the idea being that one's signal would bounce once or twice around the earth and -- even with the speed of the signal -- you'd still be able to hear yourself due to a delay because of the great distance traveled, which is ~1/7s for every trip around the earth.  Of course I've never had it happen (I've never run more than barefoot/50w on CW) and have kind of dismissed it as legend since I've never spoken with anyone that has experienced it.

And then I [stumbled upon this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_delayed_echo).

&gt; Goodacre reports that he pointed his antenna towards the horizon and received his own 28 MHz signal delayed by up to about 9 seconds.  His measurement implies travel up to 65 rounds around the earth.

Has anyone here ever experienced this?  Here I was searching around today expecting to find a cool YouTube video of someone demonstrating the phenomenon but I only end up finding badly written articles that always include the ""could be aliens"" reference."	t5_2qi86	True

Can anyone here give me a basic breakdown of HAM tech? I get the basics like Power, receiver (here there be dragons, not sure what to look for), Mic, speaker, and antenna. I get the idea that power+antenna are the keys, but there's what 2m and 5m bands? and different antennas work with each, right?

1340073042.0	v98z1	[Update] New facility on campus wants my university's radio club to move	antiquekid3	23	5	22	"Well, it's been more than a week, and I promised everyone an update. 

This past week, the security officer has been gone. Thus, talking to her was impossible. I did manage to meet with the department head, and he indicated that there was worry that the SCIFs could not get their acceptance with nearby antennas. It was all a matter of perception.

Today I met with the security officer. She had previously requested information (twice, actually...she never even read them) regarding the antennas and what's within the club room. She said that she was worried that the antennas were close enough to listen in on the communications. I told her this was not possible no matter how close the antenna was, since the radios behind it are pre-1990, and the majority of them are tube radios. I also told her exactly what bands we could operate (which is nothing above 70cm and nothing below 80m). She did ask what the 'V' and 'U' stood for in ""VHF"" and ""UHF"", respectively. I offered to take her over to the club room so she could see for herself. She said she would want to do that at some point soon, but really to verify that people with binoculars can't seen into the building. 

It sounds like they will reconsider kicking us off the roof. The non-technical people will have to be convinced that these antennas would not jeopardize the security, and notably, the acceptance. I am hoping a tour of the club room along with more explaining that our tube radios are the equivalent of a rock when it comes to receiving secure communications will be all it takes to really convince them.

I also emailed a high-up professor emeritus who happens to be a huge DXer. I have asked him to meet with the associate dean, who I found was the one who made the decision to take the antennas down. Hopefully he can be convinced by the professor to reconsider as well.

Technically speaking, the orders have already been given, and I've already asked the guy responsible for taking the antenna down how much money I would have to pay him to not do it. His response? ""I would like to retire, ya know..."" :)

I believe I shall be giving at least one more update by the beginning of next week, assuming things have progressed."	t5_2qi86	True

1339202790.0	ush85	New facility on campus wants my university's radio club to move	antiquekid3	25	5	39	"Let me preface this with a story, one that really foresaw the outcome of this situation:

A group of five (myself, the president; a grad student; another undergrad; the faculty advisor; and an active alum) were up on the roof of the building where our club's shack is located, back in February or March. We were putting up a 144/440 MHz antenna for packet radio and repeater use. The club's faculty advisor of course had permission for us to be up here (since we do have antennas to maintain) and had the key to get us onto the roof. We were just finishing up when the door opens, and out walks the head of the ECE department. He says that the security officer in the building next door is complaining that we are on the roof and need to come down. We politely oblige but mention that we had permission and were just installing a new antenna.

Apparently mentioning the new antenna part wasn't so hot. That seemed to worry him, despite him understanding that it's just a replacement for the j-pole that we took down. We ended up having to write a letter to the security officer explaining what the antenna was and what we intend to do with it. No complaints were made (from what we could tell), and all seemed back to normal.

Alright, so here's what I end up hearing two days ago from our advisor:

The antennas (notably the large tri-bander on a 10' tower section) have to come down. No questions. Apparently the dean has ordered this, and there's nothing we can do about it. We are trying to find a good location that is convenient for students, but few locations exist that would be good for antennas. Our current location wasn't optimal, but we were still able to do some good work.

So what's all this about anyways? The building next door, as it turns out, is supposed to eventually be a secure facility. The antennas on top of our building apparently make the facility look insecure or something like that. We have mentioned before that our club room stays locked, is only accessible by club members, and can only be operated by licensed radio operators. If it really is a security issue, and not just a matter of perception...are they really scared our Heathkit AM/SSB tube twins and Kenwood TS-450S are going to receive top secret encrypted communication links? And so far, we've had zero complaints of harmful interference, but I could still see that as a more valid concern. Nevertheless, I am very frustrated that one of the oldest clubs on campus is being forced out of our current home because the new guys in town think our antennas are a security risk. It's just a big mess, and I hope it gets resolved soon with pleasant outcomes for all involved."	t5_2qi86	True

Also, some of the HAM operators in my area (I have a KI6 callsign) don't seem to like the younger hams.  I've overheard conversations on some of the repeaters here ""these young people don't understand the importance of code... they don't know anything... blah blah blah"" and it's really turned me off.

I took up the hobby because I think it's an important skill to have, and for many of the same reasons older hams have.  

However I get discouraged when I hear conversations like that and I've not checked out the other bands (other than 2m/440) because I'm worried that it'll be more of the same.

Do any of you younger hams feel the same way?  I realize there are a lot of great Elmers out there, and I've definitely gotten to talk to a lot of them, but there are quite a few older hams that don't care for 20 somethings in the hobby."	t5_2qi86	True

Criticisms are also welcome.  I know I could just go buy a new rig.  I know I should have thought more about my antenna first.  I'm concerned I'll be out trying to find an antenna tuner before I can get on the air......

But whatever. It will all work out eventually, so any help in that direction is appreciated.

As far as things useful for HF, I've got a Diamond SX-1000 wattmeter, a 50 amp Astron power supply, a bunch of cable ends, some jumpers and......a call sign.  Time to figure the rest out.

[Amateur Radio High Altitude Ballooning](http://www.arhab.org/index.html#)

This year our goal is to break the duration record of 57 hours 2 minutes and to do that we need the help of the HAM community to maintain communications with the air vehicle. 

We are currently holding our launch date while waiting for optimum launch conditions to break the duration record. On our website (www.projectbluehorizon.com) you can check the latest flight predictions and eventually track the flight path of the balloon in real time. You can also visit the User Input tab on our website to input data points you've received and help us track the balloon.

In the event of communication loss from our Ground Control station, some HAMs may even be asked to assist in issuing commands to our air vehicle.

We expect to launch PBH-18 (call sign N2XE) within the next two weeks. I will post updated information here in r/amateurradio with explicit date and time information as we are more sure of our exact launch date.

* APRS: 144.390 (call sign KD2AUC)
* 30M band (call sign N2XE)
* 40M band (call sign N2XE)


Thanks in advance for your help and participation!

-Project Blue Horizon Team

Also, if you have any questions feel free to ask. I'll be monitoring this post until I put up the launch information in a new post.

Foundation, which is what I had previously, gives you a max 10W pX output power, and access to 80/40/15/10, and 2m/70cm. With a foundation license, you can only use voice and manually keyed morse. No data modes.

Standard ups the output limit to 100W pX on SSB, 30W pY on FM, and adds 15m, 6m and some of the higher bands (23cm, 13cm) to your allowed list. Maximum bandwidth of 16KHz though (no ATV)

Advanced up your max output power to 400W pX on SSB, 120W pY on everything else, and gives you access to all the bands (30m, so on).

I've been on my foundation license since March, but this weekend I finally got around to sitting my Advanced exam, and passed! 

I've been meaning to sit the exam for a while. I'm involved in Project Horus, a high altitude ballooning group in Adelaide, South Australia, and we transmit RTTY, and beacon APRS from our balloon payloads. I've designed the payloads that are used on these flights, but haven't been able to use my own call-sign on them - now I'll be able to.

*  Was supposed to go to a radio rally yesterday but decided not to because my friend had no cash and there wasn't anything I wanted so it seemed daft to do a 340 mile round trip for a few connectors

*  Today I travelled to the other side of the UK to my usual once fortnightly IT auction to buy some stock. For some reason, I decided to take off the Tarheel and put my dual bander on and see what was happening on the repeaters on the 212 mile round trip. I've not been on VHF/UHF mobile for over 6 months.

*  The auction, which is cash only, made a mistake and omitted 2 laptops I'd bought. I couldn't be bothered to sort it out so had £100 more than I should have.

*  On the way back I heard a guy talking about TS480's. He wasn't on the repeater that covered his area and it was the first time I'd been on it. He was asking how much they were worth so I told him about £600-£650 for the HX. He said he was going to sell it for £450 for a quick sale as he had two sat doing nothing. £450 happened to be the amount of money I had in my wallet plus the £300 maximum daily cash amount I could withdraw on my ATM card! 

* It was 20 miles out of my way on a 212 mile round trip and there was a cash point just round the corner from his house.

1311703886.0	j0d51	A question to the community	k-diddly	18	2	19	"Hello all.

First, I have been reading here for a while and I really appreciate how well the Ents have been being received...the level of 'lingo' and amount of explanations are great.

I have been watching this sub-reddit for a while and have always been interested in amateur radio...I remember soldering up a crystal radio kit as a kid.

Regarding amateur radio, I have been considering just jumping right in, but my nature is a bit more reserved.  I was happy to see a link allowing me to stream live feeds from local signal sources recently, and I got excited to have the opportunity to ""lurk"" without any investment.

I listened to the police and fire channels as they worked to put out a wildfire in the backcountry.  It was great to listen in as the helicopters were coordinated to make water drops.

However, when I tune in to any local repeaters, what I find is immature drivel.... Three or four guys calling each other names, threatening violence, and talking about how they would like to rape one of the participant's wife.

The question I allude to in the title is:  Is this the sort of behavior that is going on most of the time or is there anything more enriching to this hobby?

tl;dr   Listening to local repeaters I usually hear foul, demeaning, bigoted, immature crap...is that all there is?"	t5_2qi86	True

Made it out, but due to my income I ended up in a ""luxury apartment"" with heavy restrictions. The good news is I have access to an attic that isn't shared with other tenants so I have a place to install an antenna coupler and a loop antenna. The bad news is with the weather getting colder here we ended up with a few furry tenants up there that need eviction so we need to get the land lord involved to send someone up there to take care of it. So until the critters are gone no antenna is going up there in fear of damage to my rather expensive equipment and/or a not so friendly confrontation with said critters.

I'm thinking for a temp solution until the critters are gone to run a small loop along the edge of the ceiling of my room, but I'm concerned about RFI and safety. I never intend to run more the 100W in any given situation (amps are expensive) and I'm not shy to QRP operations (I do a lot of QRP/P stuff), but I would like to be able to use SSB phone if possible.

I'm not a ham yet, but I'm taking my test next week and should get technician and think I have decent odds of getting general. I already have a dual-band HT for my public safety day job that I can use to get on 2m and 70cm, and I've been learning morse code with lcwo.net. I'm aware of a number of other things I can do but I'm not sure what equipment I need. SSB/CW/PSK31/other digital modes. I don't want to spend a bunch of money on gear just to get on the HF bands, but the selection of HF radios seems to be either the stuff Yaesu offers, which looks like way more than I need or would understand, or something like a QRP transmitter kit. My problem is that it's very difficult, as someone who isn't used to the terminology and the systems involved, to understand exactly what each of these pieces of equipment is actually capable of and how it interfaces with the next piece. 

I'll be specific: I understand that there is a need to zero-beat in order to properly use CW. CW kits such as [this one](http://smallwonderlabs.com/Rockmite.htm) look like an easy way to get on the air (I'm decent with a soldering iron), but they don't appear to have any frequency adjustment, so how is this ""zero-beat"" handled, if at all? Or are these actually only capable of operating on one frequency, and the hope is that everyone's electronics are close enough that it works? Doesn't the restriction to only one frequency severely limit your capability? I'm aware of the availability of used radios, but for the sake of reference, how much should I expect to pay to find a radio that would allow me to transmit using at least SSB and CW on at least one HF band? Other than an antenna and a key/paddle, is there anything else I need?

I appreciate any assistance you can give. I have been scouring the internet over the last few days but all I have found is overpriced gear, outdated websites, and broken links. I have read the FAQ linked in the sidebar, and 10/20/40 meters seem like a useful set, but I'm in the middle of a city, so I'd have some trouble with huge antennas."	t5_2qi86	True

How does this happen?	molo1134	17	0	11	"I starting doing 20m PSK in March of this year, and have been trying to get on at least a couple times a week.  Last night was the first time I've seen propagation conditions like this, and I'm not sure what mechanism allowed this to occur.

I am located in Northern New Jersey.  The nearest stations I hear on 20m (other than the truly local) are usually in the 1300km range.  Last night I sat down at 0120Z and worked Michigan at 1000km and Wisconsin at 1100km.  I got back on at 0230Z and worked Ohio at 680km and Maryland at 340km (!!).  At 0300 I worked two Virginia stations at 500km and 650km.  Around 0400 I worked Pennsylvania twice at 500km and 450km.

While this was going on, I also made a few more usual contacts with stations further afield.  This included Spain, Venezuela, New Mexico and Oklahoma.

So, it seems as if there was a second propagation mechanism in addition to the usual 20m DX propagation.  The area that I was able to hear seemed to progress from west to east over the course of a couple hours.  Does anyone know what kind of propagation mechanism allowed this to happen?  If I had stayed up late, might I have heard New England?

Thanks for any ideas you may have.

I tried to get several other calls, actually about five 1x2s, but I was unsuccessful. This was the first 1x3 on my list. I was pretty bummed that I didn't get a 1x2, but I may keep trying. Being in the 4th call district, it can be pretty rough. Maybe not as bad as 5, though.

I went the cheap route and did it all through the FCC. If you don't go this route, you're seriously wasting your money. I think I paid $14 or so to do it. It takes a little while to get your password, so plan that well in advance before the call you want expires. The rest of the process was quite easy and didn't require much effort. I was unsure if the submission or filing date was used to determine what calls were applicable, which probably led me to lose a few of the 1x2s. There's always next time, and for another $14, I sure wouldn't mind doing it again. But I'll stick with W4GNU for the next few months and see how it works.

So, with that being said, who has a vanity call, and how did you get yours? Does your call have any special meaning? Also, what are some fun acronyms (or technically initialisms, I suppose) you've developed for your call?

tl;dr;tl;dr: Ham radio is the new arduino?


   So, this past Saturday, a large hackathon occurred (SHDH). SHDH regularly gathers in excess of 200 people. And, I observed multiple people discussing or working on ham radio stuff (6 or 7). In addition, half of them were 18-25 like myself. I think I would have noticed if people had their radios out at a previous SHDH, but this is an anecdote, so take it as you will.

   Anyways, this theory came about when I was talking with a friend who just got his license. I had always had a vague interest in amateur radio, and he had spurred me to start studying for technician. 

   In addition, I think there's a bit of an interest in ""old"" technology. Stuff that isn't as popular as it used to be, but no less useful. See /r/revival . 

   So, here's my uneducated-guess-prediction: many people like me are going to be drawn to ham radio through the DIY scene, more then ever before. People seeing their peers in technology get interested will cause them to get interested as well.

What I've found doesn't exactly confirm, but strongly suggests that the band was chosen, in a large part, by the lobbying of Raytheon in 1946 in anticipation of their Radarange microwave oven. What's troubling me is that it seems they only asked for a general region of spectrum, (10cm / 3GHz) and the rationale for settling on 2.4 is hard to find. 

Raython bluntly state ""*We do not entertain requests for academic research assistance.""* and my enquiries with the FCC are going slowly. 

Would anyone here know someone (likely very old) or perhaps a child of someone who may have been involved with Raytheon during that time? Or perhaps working there at the moment with access to some historical data?

Should I bother with an APRS handheld for camping+hiking?	stevek353	18	2	33	"I have read most every ""Which HT should I get?"" thread on /r/amateurradio but I had a few more specific questions before buying my first HT.

I'm looking for a handheld radio that I could use to keep in contact with my wife in the event of a natural disaster or most likely just hiking around in Appalachia. She and I are both studying for our Tech exam (and possibly General) next month.

Being very new to hamming, I had a few questions:

1. Of course terrain/weather/etc are always a factor, but what kind of range could I typically expect with a [Yaesu VX-6R](http://yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;ProdCatID=111&amp;encProdID=4C6F204F6FEBB5BAFA58BCC1C131EAC0&amp;DivisionID=65&amp;isArchived=0) in a non-mountainous but still non-flat East Coast forest? What about with a better after-market antenna?
2. Would a [VX-7R](http://yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;ProdCatID=111&amp;encProdID=8D3254BFC69FB172D78647DC56EFB0E9&amp;DivisionID=65&amp;isArchived=0) or [VX-8GR](http://yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;ProdCatID=111&amp;encProdID=9D0EA3E2FB5ED55942E531288EF4C787&amp;DivisionID=65&amp;isArchived=0) give me more range?
3. Would I be getting a lot more range out of a ham HT, or would it not be much better than a decent GMRS radio? In my experience, 35-mile GMRS radios [hardly even work over 1 mile](http://www.amazon.com/review/R8B4B1YTLUSGO/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B007FELOZO&amp;nodeID=1077068&amp;store=car).
4. Is a 10-mile range in a ""non-flat East Coast forest"" area unrealistic with a typical HT?
5. I know one can transmit/receive notifications with APRS, is this data always public? Or could my wife and I share our locations privately via APRS?
6. Should I bother with an APRS-capable HT (eg VX-8GR)?

After lurking around here for a while, I'm going to be taking the Tech exam tomorrow! I'm a BSEE student with interests in signal processing and RF, and I'd love to get a decent ham setup going eventually. I've been playing around with the /r/RTLSDR project lately, though I feel as if even there I'm limited with the feasibility of antennae. I can't seem to pick up many transmissions, and no further than ~120 miles.

With no room for a discone or other fancy antenna in my apartment, I've been running an el-cheapo dipole with a short run of RG6. My concern is that in the ham world, I won't be able to do a whole lot out of my apartment. I hope this question isn't too ill-conceived, but I'm not very familiar with what radios and antennae would be well-suited for such a situation. Would anyone care to offer any advice?"	t5_2qi86	True

I've had my Technician license for a while now, got it when I lived in an apartment at the encouragement of my father-in-law and didn't have my own radio.  I borrowed his IC-V82 a while back and programmed it and managed to meet up with him on the air briefly via a local repeater (he's also a newb that never pursued it past having a radio and the license sadly).

I want to try and make contact over some of the local repeaters, and I've found a list over at http://www.w8bi.org. I've programmed them into my radio and have read the etiquette/how to over at http://www.hamuniverse.com/repeater.html. What I can't find however is whether or not you have to be a member of any clubs in norder to use the repeaters, and whether or not I'm even allowed to transmit on the SKYWARN repeaters or do they need to be left alone for SKYWARN business only.

I'm also curious about making initial random contact, do I do just as the hamuniverse article says and key up and then state my call letters and wait? Or should I say something a little more grandiose?

I'm at work and brought my radio, but apparently I'm not able to get a signal in the building on the handheld because I'm not hearing the periodic repeater welcome messages while scanning my channels.

I'm really looking forward to getting a little more involved. I apologize in advance for any faux pas I commit. Thanks everyone!"	t5_2qi86	True

I have always had a thing for the ""forgotten bands"".  I had a Yaesu VX-7R a while back which would do 300 mW on 1.25, so never really gave it a shot.

Now, I (for whatever reason) want to get onto 220.  I know that it isn't popular and a lot of activity has waned on the central / eastern parts of the US since there isn't a bunch of commercial gear that was ever repurposed, but word is that the propagation characteristics of 1.25m are good.  There are 2 220 repeaters in the Louisville / Southern Indiana area that I don't know how active they are, but would love to try this out as an alternative.

I found on eBay a cheapo Chinese 5 watt 220 rig for 69.99 (KST V6) and joined the Yahoo Group for it.  Am I wasting time?  I know there are times that 2M and 70CM are dead so another band can't be useful, right?  Well I like experimenting and playing with parts of our hobby so they wont die.

HungryLikeTheWolf99	18	0	21	"For someone with only a 2m FM radio, digital modes aren't very exciting - at least, not if you listen to most people who seem to be talking about it online. Of course, they say you have to be using side band to be taking advantage of digital modes.

However, a buddy and I recently tried both BPSK31 and Olivia 4/125 over our 2m FM radios (simplex). We decreased our transmit capability (by changing output wattages and antennas) until we could barely hear that there was a voice under all the noise, if at all. We then both tried keying up and transmitting BPSK31 or Olivia.

To my great surprise, on the same wattage/antenna situation in which you couldn't make out a voice, you could hear the tones of the digital modulation loud and clear, and we made successful contact using both modes. Further experimentation found that Olivia was less error-prone, but no errors were found on the first attempt.

So, the question is: is it possible that you may see similar gains using digital modes over an FM radio as you see switching to SSB, or better yet, to a digital mode on SSB?

tl;dr. Could digital over 2mFM rigs be good?"	t5_2qi86	True

I've been a lurker for a while now, but decided I was going to get my business in order over spring break.  I spent the past week studying on and off, and today I finally took my Exams.  I got 100% on both the Technician and General tests, but missed passing the Extra by 2 questions.  But I'll make sure to ace it next time!  Anyway, I just wanted to say Hey, and I'm so happy to finally be able to become part of this subreddit, and I can't wait to add my callsign next to my name!

NT1K is strappin' ass with his SB-200 (Of course still the G5RV handicap) so at least tune in and if you can't hear us, there's a good change you'll be able to hear him.

I got my glowbox about a year ago now and hope to find something interesting to improve my listening experience.

Will I even be able to buy anything (receivers/antennas) given that I don't have a license either?  Is there some kind of unwritten rule I should know about before going?

(I really need to study to take the license exam)
