1364215433.0	1ayxjg	My BluRay Stealth Mod	crazy_scout	63	4	11	"So I decided I want to keep my case as sleek looking as possible so I went ahead and devoted a few hours to stealth modding my blu ray drive.

The last time I did this, I had to press the corner of the bay cover to open my drive, this time I opted for a more elegant solution and decided to go ahead and make a switch/button.



This is what my top I/O looked like before the mod

[Stock Picture of Top](http://puu.sh/2mREQ)

Notice the button looking thing under the reset button. It is actually just molded plastic and not a functioning button at all, all molded with the top plastic cover.



So first thing was first I decided I would go ahead and use an X-Acto Knife and carfully cut out myself a button out of that molded plastic. After cutting that out I took apart my BluRay Drive, I soldered on some wires to the existing eject button's solder points. Drilled some holes into my BluRay Drive to run the cables through.

Next I measured how much further in the drive would be sitting in the drive bay as a result of using the original mesh covering, and went ahead and drilled some new mounting holes for the bluray drive in my case.

After that I went and bought myself a tactile button to use as the eject button, and went ahead and mounted it on some PCB and placed it on the existing pcb of the I/O of the top panel, lined up perfectly. 

Soldered the wires to the button, superglued the plastic I cut out on top of the tactile button, and now viola I have a stealth drive with an eject button.

Next step is I want to get some clear sticker printing paper and print out ""Eject"" or just an eject symbol and put that sticker on my new button just to make it look even more stock.


Anyways past all the boring tidbits here is how it turned out.



[The blue outline is the button I made that ejects the drive.](http://puu.sh/2mRQ8)




[And the drive opened](http://puu.sh/2mRSV)



I know on the right hand side of the button there is a scoff mark, its not too noticeable but when I get a day off I will go ahead and buff it out/fill it so its not visible at all.

Up until 3 days ago, the middle one was used for my Playstation and an IPTV Receiver, but that wasn't high tech enough, so I decided to integrate a full fletched computer.

I collected all the parts I had laying around and started my journey.

Components used:

*  2x 320gb HDD (shitty)

*  AMD 64 4400+ (shitty)

*  1.5 gig RAM (shitty)

*  1GB Graphics card (shitty)

*  Shitty power supply I had laying around.

So, these is the fruits of working nonstop Sunday afternoon on making a realistic looking case with the idea that I had months ago and submitted a few weeks ago. I decided to sit down with Sketchup again and really put in some effort. This is still really a nonfunctioning model. The measurements aren't great and I borrowed models for the Mobo, GPU, CPU Fan, PSU, SSD's, 5.25"" and 3.5"" drives, 120mm fans, fan filter meshes, and honeycomb mesh. Utilizing the 3D Warehouse in Sketchup really allowed me to focus my design around the actual items of the case instead of just imagining it there.

To recap, the idea is to have a small case that can fit nicely on a desktop and showcase all of your sweet hardware. It always annoyed me that cases sat on the floor with the side window facing (usually) away from the user, or covered up by desk legs. Why isn't the window in the front?! I want to see all of my gear that I've worked hard to purchase, install, cable manage, and color coordinate. 

Two things I should mention about the case. It will only fit a Micro-Atx motherboard, which is fine, they're just as good as full ATX boards. Secondly, it turns the board 90 degrees clockwise, so that the i/o panel and cords are on the top of the case. 

The case has four distinct sections. The Top is a removeable ""cap"" that covers all of your cables going into the computer. It has three cable grommets on the back to route cables through.

The Front houses the motherboard, GPU, CPU, CPU Fan, RAM, and four 120mm case fans that can be turned any way to allow air to flow from either left to right or right to left through the case. The Front has a removable windowed panel. This is where you view your awesome hardware, on your desk, at the forefront of vision where they belong. There are also four rubber cable grommets to allow cables through from....

...The Back houses the PSU and up to four SSD's. With the PSU in the back, it makes cable management a breeze. No more having to hide useless cables. Only pull the cables you want through the appropriate grommets and leave the rest in the back of the case. The back panel is removable.

The Bottom houses a single 5.25"" drive and two 3.5"" drives. Looking back at the pictures I can see that I missed some of the drive bay modeling for the 3.5"" bays. Oops.

The Ultabox has the following dimensions (these are approximations as I really have no idea how thick walls should be, exact sizes for drive bays, etc):

Height- ~17.5""
Width- ~14.5""
Depth- ~11""

All walls are 1/8"" thick. I have no idea if this is a decent width or not. It looked good tho.

A lot of work still needs to be done to make this thing a reality. I need to make legimate measurements, add small details like hinges, tabs, catches, screw holes, etc. I also need way more skill/time/money to actually build it, but it's a step closer at least, and a hell of a lot better than the original one I mocked up. I'm still not sure where to go from here. /u/Brodholm managed to get sponsors for his Chasis 101 which is really cool, but I have no idea how to go about doing that. So, this idea still hangs in the aether...for now.

Enjoy!

I finished up the final touches on my window mod. I bought a kit from frozencpu.com but it was a bit large so I had to cut it down about 2.35"" 

Everything went great up until having to put the window in place. The window mold with locking strip SUCKS! It was incredibly finicky and hard to work with. I ended up gluing the strip onto the case side then placing the window in.

1359589779.0	17lefi	Metal coolant hoses?	chairmanxiao	22	0	12	My liquid cooling is due for a flush, so I figured I might as well tidy it up and make it look a bit nicer. I've seen a few PCs with bent metal tubing instead of flexible rubber hoses (most notably the Murderbox PCs), and I was wondering if anyone had any tips or links to resources about how to pull off metal tubes. I have tube bending and cutting tools, and tube is pretty cheap, but I have no idea what the best way to connect the tube to my components is. I've heard that compression fittings work on some copper tubing, but I haven't been able to get much more information. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!	t5_2tj99	True

I am currently in the process of converting from a red/black theme to a white/black one, which is why in the pic you will see, the colors aren't exactly matching, anyway I digress.

I started with one of [these](http://www.dpciwholesale.com/images/D/5456.JPG), measured the height that the gpu should be sitting at, and cut the twisted section to size with my dremel. Then I used the dremel to buff/polish the metal. Next I made a couple feet using my hot glue gun and stuck them to the shaft. Finally I painted it with some white spray paint. [Here](http://imgur.com/2QNwtN4) is the finished product installed. I Know its not much, but I like how it turned out, and for about a dollar I think its a good option.

1359322563.0	17dzmo	Planning on putting my gaming rig into an old computer case i have lying around, and i have some questions i hope to get answered. Pictures of the case inside!	zuruckai	19	2	14	"So i want to put my computer inside [this awesome old case](http://imgur.com/a/AQqIz#0). The reason for this is partly because i can (atleast i hope so), and i really want to try it, because i think it sounds awesome to have a really old computer case with modern technology inside. I am also planning on going to this big lan- party (The gathering) and i would rather bring this case than my huge 800D i have atm. (i am taking the train)

But i am having some issues getting this to work, if I am going to put my psu where the old psu is, I get a clearing of 1 cm between the top of the stock cpu cooler and the bottom of the psu. If the measurements of the cooler i found on the internet is right. The length between the old motherboard and the psu cage is 74mm and and the cooler is supposed to be 64mm high. My question is will the cpu get enough air with only a 1cm clearance? keep in mind I am going to try to fit in as many fans as I possibly can by cutting holes for them and so on.

Another thing i need is some suggestins for where to put my hdd's. I have two that i would like to fit in there somehow. My first idea was to keep the small floppy+1hdd cage that was inside already. (in the middle of the case to the left) If i am going this route I am going to have to find somthing to support its weight as it was ""connected"" to the drive bay above it before. And I also would have to find another place to put my second hdd. BTW i was planning on keeping the floppy drive there to get the old-school look :)

So what do you guys think? Is this a stupid idea, or is it doable?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 

Here is the parts i plan to put inside:

After I tore the full cable sleeving off my 24pin cable from my OCZ ZX 850W I found [capacitors in my cable](http://i.imgur.com/77bFQ.jpg). And unfortunately, in my haste to get the old sleeving off, [I knocked one of the leads out of whatever socket it was in](http://i.imgur.com/DfQoy.jpg).

The side that is still connected is in a +3.3v socket, and the other lead is currently sitting between a ground and +5v socket. My first guess would be that it should be in the ground (all the others connect between some voltage and ground) but I don't want to mess anything up.

Anyone know how it should be reconnected? My google-fu seems to have failed me on this.
Also, does anyone know why there are capacitors on my cable at all? I would have thought these would be internal to the PSU. And since they'll probably cause problems with the custom sleeving, is there any reason I can't move them into the PSU as long as I keep them connected to the equivalent wires?"	t5_2tj99	True

My solution for my new build was to have a single, well-filtered input, and have all the other fans output.  However, the side 230mm fan wasn't enough for me.  I decided to bolt on a 14"" car radiator fan.  It's designed for 12v/2200rpm/1500cfm, but I have it running at about 4v/800rpm.  I can't measure cfm, but I'm guessing it's around 300-400ish.  Also, the Thor has a few nice red lights, as does my corsair PSU.  Why not make the fan light up, too?  For this, I ordered some flat LED strips from china, hooked up sets of 6 to 3 of the 10 fan blades, and powered them through a slip ring.  Here are the pictures (there aren't many, since I was so convinced this wouldn't work, I didn't document much)

LiarInGlass	18	2	5	"I've been a long time reader and member of Overclock.net, and came across [""The Mod""](http://www.overclock.net/t/1203528/official-nvidia-gpu-mod-club-aka-the-mod), a quick and easy mod for using a CLC (Closed Liquid Cooler) like an Antec 620, 920, or Corsair H50/H60/H70 on a GPU instead of CPU like intended. I haven't seen a lot of people doing this around here, but I thought I'd show it off and express how pleased I am with the results. My gaming PC is now much more amazing to me and I love it.

With stock cooling, my GTX 480 at stock voltage and a very small overclock would idle at around 55-60C, and would hit above 85-90C under full load when running OCCT or other benchmarking applications.

After applying the Antec 620, with a decent location for the radiator and the fans, it's now heavily overclocked to 900/1800/2200 at 1.163 volts and idles between 33-35C and hits about 60C under full load. That's a pretty huge difference for me, and I no longer have to hear the extremely loud and annoying fan from the 480. I just keep the fan at 30% at all times to help keep the VRM cooled.

I didn't have much room to work with since my machine is a little old now, and I hate this case, so I try not to mess with it too much. I just have the radiator near the middle/front with a push/pull configuration, and I leave my side panel off.

The mod took a bit of time, but it was definitely worth it. All that was needed was the Antec 920, zip ties, thermal paste, and some patience.

I used four zip ties to connect around the Antec 920 and tightened them a bit, and then fed 4 through the ring of zip ties I made, then looped them and fed them through the holes of the 480 PCB, and then fastened them down tightly.

I hope some more people around here give this a try, as the temperature is pretty awesome. I don't think it's as good as a real water system, but it's definitely better than fan cooling and using stock coolers or it even seems better than the aftermarket coolers that I've seen.

Here's a few shots I took of the process.

All in all, I think it was a really awesome experiment and I'm pleased with a fairly silent GPU now and got to take advantage of a pretty high overclock compared to stock. I wish I could get it higher, but I seem to not be able to get any higher. It's still good enough for me.

Hope some others around here try this out if you haven't seen it. It's pretty awesome and simple.

1369858779.0	1fagnn	Front window PC Case	Ultamaynard	18	1	23	"So, I'm not sure where to post this, but I've had an idea. It may not be an original idea (well it was for me), but I can't find this kind of case anywhere online. I also don't have the time or resources to make it happen right now, and really just wanted some input.

Why isn't there a chassis out there with a front facing window? I don't just mean a case with a single window on the front, but a whole re-imagining of the case. I spend a lot of time and money picking out parts that match and look good together, work on cable management, and organize my case in such a way that it's damn pleasing to look at.  So why the hell does it sit on the floor with a measly side window? Why isn't the motherboard the ""face"" of the case? I've mocked up what I would like to do in Sketchup (I've just learned a little about it, so the mockup isn't great). 

Here are some pics: 
http://imgur.com/a/fphcv

Here's how it's laid out. The case ultimately has three sections, the front, back and bottom. The front of the case has a large window panel that can be removed with thumb screws to give access to the motherboard.  The motherboard tray, and that whole front section only has room for the motherboard (and components that typically go on it, gpu, cpu, fan, ram ,etc), io panel and a fan or two at the back and front(not pictured), as well as room for cables to come through to the motherboard. That section is what you want to show off and even just admire yourself with a couple of cold-cathodes. 

Behind the motherboard panel is the back section. That section has the powersupply (turned sideways, with the intake fan facing out of the back), and any HDD's and SSD's. I didn't design the inside of that section, but I'm sure brackets and holders for drives could easily be mounted.

Finally, the bottom section contains your optical drives, any 3.5"" devices (usb hubs, fan controllers, etc). 

I'd imagine that the front window panel, back panel, and bottom of the case would all open to allow access. Otherwise it'd be dark, wrinkle-coated steel. 

The main point of the case would be to have a more compact case that can sit on your desk, to the right of your monitor(s) for all the world to admire, instead of on the damn floor. (has to be the right since the i/o panel is on the left side of the case, unless it could be made in such a way that the mobo and stuff was upside down to flip it) The dimensions I have in Sketchup (which are probably pretty damn off considering all the walls are 2D in the model) are H18"", W13"", D11.""

That's it. Sorry for the wall of text and the ill-formed ideas.

EDIT: I realize that Lian Li has a new mini-ITX case that's basically a curved model of my idea.
http://www.pcper.com/news/General-Tech/Lian-Li-Announces-New-Mini-ITX-Chassis-Curve-Shaped-Design-and-Front-Acrylic-Windo

I promise I'd come up with my idea before this was announced.  Also, I'm looking at full ATX or Mini-ATX at max. The idea is for a full sized computer to fit on a desk and be artwork as the fruit of hard work and money and not just something that sits idle on the floor. "	t5_2tj99	True

&gt; discuss new mod ideas for their rigs

Basically, when mounted with the pipes towards the front of the case, the front-right corner of the radiator (as viewed from the front of the case) is wedged-ish under the front panel connector ""stand"". So, we drilled a single hole, threw a self-tapping screw in, took that out and [put a shelf bracket in](http://i.imgur.com/A7AW0WP.jpg). Now I have two screws from one of the fans holding the radiator *down*, and the front panel connector and this shelf bracket holding the rad at opposite corners to prevent lateral movement.

I hope this helps somebody. This doesn't affect mounting the roof at all, and is far less invasive than it might have been if I were to drill all new holes. Plus, I did this whilst my rig was installed in the case; so you don't need to strip it apart.

1361342371.0	18vglk	So it may be crazy, but...	Amidaryu	15	0	20	"So, I was looking at all the incredible PC mods on this subreddit, and I was thinking, perhaps I myself could emulate these innovative individuals. Then, I was at a loss as to what exactly to do. I own [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146092) work of art by NZXT, and the lack inherent flaws in the design (aesthetic's wise) caused a problem in my thought process. I basically wished somehow *make it my own*, without disturbing its unique profile. When finally it hit me:

I often find myself in a game, wanting to know how my CPU and such are holding up under the strain produced by such applications. Not that I really worry, but rather I feel a certain sense of pride in my idle and load temps. Anywho, I was looking online and I found many touchscreen fan controllers that also displayed the temperature. Now, I myself don't really wish to install one of these in a drivebay, but I would really like to have a display for such things. So, I took one look at my unused Ipad 1, and had a eureka moment of sorts. 

In conclusion, I'd like to have /r/pcmods opinion on the feasibility of mounting an Ipad 1 in the unused 200mm sidefan mount. Im unaware of anyone attempting it before, so that was a tad exciting, while also discouraging. One major roadblock is the actual utility of such a thing, since I'm unaware of how I'd actually go about feeding any software (I doubt I'd be able to use iOS for such a purpose, another problem) the sensory inputs from either my motherboard, or an attached sensor. The cutting of the side panel seems simple enough though, so no problems there. Anyways, are my aspirations bigger than the reality of the project?

TL;DR: I want to mount my Ipad to display cpu and possibly gpu temps on my cases sidepanel. "	t5_2tj99	True

1342221377.0	wiwdb	Can anyone give me some advice?	David_mcnasty	14	0	5	"Ok first some backstory:
So I've been planning on building a computer for years now(I'm 20, been planning this since I was 14.) but I've had tons of financial troubles up until now. I've finally gotten to a place where it will be safe to spend money building it. This august I will earn about $2000 and plan to spend $1000-$1300 building the pc and I really want to go all out with it. Since I want to go all out I really want to make a custom case, the issue is I have no experience with this. I've built plenty of computers and taken both networking and hardware classes, but this is out of my comfort zone. I've been bouncing around idea's for years but I've finally decided I want a LotR theme, something akin to [this](http://i.imgur.com/Dao5s.jpg) but with an orc theme. I've done some sketches and although I wish I could be that detailed I figured I would go with either an Eye of Sauron/tower somehow, or possibly a troll(my favorite enemies in the books).

Now my question:
What would the best way for someone new to the case modding scene be to learn something of the art, what will I most likely need to get it done, and is there any specific case that would be easiest to work with from anyone's experience?

P.S. I realize this is a long winded post, but I'm excited to finally be doing this and want to do the best I can for it."	t5_2tj99	True

* Based on the dimensions of my PC case (19.51"" x 7.68"" x 17.32""), should I get 12 or 15 inch Cathode Lights? 

* With the white case, this next question is more of a matter of opinion. I'm torn between using UV purple lights or green lights. Does reddit have any accurate photos of PCs using such lighting options?

- Trim Tools (optional) (**[link](http://www.amazon.com/Wilmar-W80648-Composite-Trim-Removal/dp/B002KSAZ78/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372129598&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=trim+tools)**) (**[my pic](http://i.imgur.com/MbGgAm3.jpg)**)


-----------------

**How do I remove my bezels?**:

- I recommend using some 'trim tools' (linked above) to help you pry apart your monitor without scratching anything. They are quite durable as well.

- Google your specific monitor model + debezel guide...also check YouTube.

-----------------

**Specific directions for Glossy Bezels:**

1. Take the 400 grit sandpaper and rough up the glossy surface around the entire bezel. This is going to give the paint something to adhere to without marring the actual plastic and creating deep grooves.

2. Clean off all the debris created by using the sandpaper on glossy paint. Use a hose or something...

3. Dry it off, but make sure whatever you dry it with doesn't leave too many little fibers or whatever behind.

-----------------

**The remainder of the directions apply to both Glossy and Metal Bezels:**

4. Take the Rust-Oleum Plastic Primer and shake it really well for about 30 seconds. Do a little test spray on some cardboard. Then apply the first and only coat. I did about 2 sprays back and forth on each bezel side to make sure I got a good, even coating. I held the spray can about 6-8 inches from the bezel. Tip: Start spraying before the spray nozzle is even in front of the bezel...this way you don't end up with too much paint on the corners from where you would've first started spraying. You'll see what I mean in the pics below, if that wasn't clear.

5. Wait 20-30 minutes for the Primer to dry. It dries pretty quickly.

6. Take the Rust-Oleum Enamel Spray Paint and shake it for 30 seconds, then test it. Apply your first coat. Use the same spray method as above.

7. Wait 15-20 minutes for the first Enamel coat to dry.

8. Apply the second Enamel Spray Paint coat.

9. Wait 20-30 minutes for the second Enamel coat to dry.

10. Come back and inspect your work. Is the paint too thick in a certain area and have little 'pock' marks because the paint dried funny there? If so, take your 400 grit sandpaper and gently sand that small area. Use your finger to brush away the dust created from using the sandpaper. Do one more coat of paint just on the edge of the bezel that you sanded.

11. Wait 24-48 hours for the paint to fully dry/set.

-----------------

Good job, you now have sexy matte bezels. :)

Several switches that do work, maybe volume, on/off and such. On the left side, buttons could be used as a WASD game-pad. Integrated 720p or 1080p screen. Doesn't have to be a touchscreen. Working VU meter would be great. External power brick?

I have been gradually upgrading this machine for about 6-9 months. But recently decided to really spice it up with some custom case modding, new GPU and MoBo and some new interiors.

It was a great project and my first major mod. I was a bit nervous on dremeling the case but it turned out really good in my opinion. I know I over spent on things like the fans and mobo but I really like the look and money wasn't an issue. I might trade out the apevia 120mm fan in the bottom for another Corsair case fan. Really happy with those.

Eventually I will replace the 2 monitors with a 3 monitor setup but I need to sell them first.

So I bought a Sugo SG-05 ultra-small mini-itx case, and a MSI radeon 7950, because I'm crazy. Well, I thought the card would fit, but it turns out the available internal dimensions of the case are about 1/4"" too short, due to the heat sink cover shield sticking out past the end of the PCB. I was thinking of cutting a slot through the entire front left side of the case, both to make room for the video card, and to allow the card to vent it's hot air out the front of the case rather than have it pushed into the small space around the motherboard and CPU. The interior frame of the case is .6mm steel, I can cut that easily enough with a little hand held dremel tool, however I'm not sure what I can use to cut the plastic cover that goes on the front so that it doesn't look horrible. Also, I was thinking, to make the case look better after doing this, I could put a screen over the part i cut out. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Ideally, it can be a complete desktop solution that I can pick up and take with me when I want to go to a LAN or a friend's house.

I'd think it'd be fairly easy to make a custom housing for the parts that would be fairly low-profile and not bulky - My main concern would be a monitor.

It would be nice to allow a 22 - 24"" monitor fold down into a padded bay that would protect it ""en-route"", or just keep it down when at home, connected to my regular setup.   When I get to a friend's house, I can fold the monitor up and lock it into place to play games (I realize the monitor would probably be down low, but I'm okay with that scenario for the moment). 

I'd assume this ought to be possible with some type of VESA mount setup, although I may have to consider stability if a monitor and mount is weighted towards the back.  Does anyone have suggestions on a practical and affordable way to achieve this?

Something like this [Cheetah mount](http://www.amazon.com/Cheetah-ALAMLB-Articulating-Displays-Patterns/dp/B001GTT0VO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351391595&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=cheetah+mount) seems universal enough to mount the monitor properly, but most of its pivot points require manually tightening/loosening to adjust every time I'd want to ""fold out"" or ""fold in"", but it may be a starting point.

1338668865.0	uhly5	Making a Wall PC, need advice!	wallModder	16	4	8	"I'm trying to make a wall mounted PC inspired by [HangPC](http://www.hangpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/500x_bedroom-case.jpg). I already bought a used PC case and cut it up using a dremel grinding disc (not recommended) so now it's down to the motherboard tray, case fan mount, and the card mounting brackets.

My goal is to make it easy to swap components and to get it out of the way to avoid ""refreshing"" my PC with desktop beverages.

What should I use for a backplane? Is metal a good idea, so that everything can be grounded as a PC case is? Also how should I mount the backplane to a wall?

I need to mount the HDDs (SSD and spinning) securely. I also need something to [avoid vibration](http://computershopper.com/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/antec-p183-drive-bays/234684-1-eng-US/antec-p183-drive-bays.jpg). I'm inspired by [these clips for cars](http://www.exogear.com/products-exomount-car-mount-holder.html) but need something cheaper and more appropriate.

Finally I need to mount the PSU and mobo tray to the backplane. Again the goal is to make it easy to swap components, so I don't want to rivet things on like HangPC. One idea for the PSU is to use two narrow bungie cord ribbons with some clamp mechanism to flexibly hold the PSU against the backplane, along with some ridges to prevent it from slowly sliding away. I'm really not sure how to mount the mobo tray, since that's the heaviest component.

Advice appreciated! Thanks!!"	t5_2tj99	True
1329269617.0	pq0na	Ready to build custom case. Need some input/advice. 	johnbell	12	0	8	"**My goals:**

-To build a decently powered, inexpensive gaming pc. 

-I want it to be small, powerful, and upgradable. 

-I don't want it to be loud or have it produce as much heat as my last rig. 

---

**Rig Specs so far:**

-ITX Mobo (Biostar TH61), 2x4gb ram.

-intel i3 2120, nvidia 550ti, full size atx psu.

---

**Idea for the Case:**

-NO PSU over CPU configuation. (Lian-Li style)

-No 5.25 bay.

-140mm fan direct to cpu hsf

-GPU fan has direct access to cool air.

-PSU exhausts air down and out.

-black acrylic all around. 

-sleeved psu to help with space constraints.

---

**Renderings of the case:**

-Please keep in mind, these were done in several minutes just to get an idea of scale. 

-Sizes should be spot on, but it's not exactly pretty... 

-Be kind... It's my first time using sketch up.

[http://i.imgur.com/uCl9N.png](http://i.imgur.com/uCl9N.png)

---

**Where I need input:**

-I'm thinking that my fan configuration should be no problem. I plan to just use a grill/filter on the top of the case for the GPU, letting it's own fan pull the air in.

-The 140mm on the side will blow onto the stock HSF combo, then should be pulled down by the PSU and exit out the rear. 

-I may or may not increase the depth of the case. The overall depth is 100% dependant on the length of the video card. Right now, my GTX 550ti is pretty short. 

-Still working on HDD mounting.

-Is 1/2"" acrylic overkill? would stepping down to 3/8"" be safe?

-Cheapest place for 140mm &amp; 92mm holesaws?

Problem is, i wanted to use a ps3 since i already have an Xbox. 

But it looks to me like that concept wouldn't work given the PS3's weird hardware architecture. It's almost like the board is sandwiched between the cooling system on one side, and drives and power supply on the other :( Any tips from the pros? 

Here's a link to the ps3's setup...

**EDIT:** After trying to sleeve the same cable over 6 times (I'll probably end up using my entire supply of paracord on one stupid cable), this happened: http://i.imgur.com/idnvXaX.jpg I guess some people just weren't meant to be sleevers.

So this is my first time attempting to sleeve my own cables. I decided to start on a 24-pin ATX power extension that I had lying around. My problem is that when I try to push the pin back into the connector, the sleeving won't fit so it pushes the sleeving back further down the wire and bunches it all up. I didn't take a picture of when this happened but below are pictures of the cheap tools I bought as a starter kit and some pictures of the (probably poor) job I did so far.

The fans have horrendous dust buildup on them and even a trusty toothbrush isnt getting them off. It seems that the best way to go about doing this is to hit it with a wet toothbrush or hard bristled brush of some sort to really loosen things up and turn it into goop, and then wipe it down using a napkin and hit the cracks/crevices with a Q-tip.

EDIT: For lubricating the fan, you can take the sticker off, take off the dust cap if there is one, and put a drop of oil (sewing machine oil or something, not WD-40) in there to make your fans quiet.
/edit  

For cleaning old crusty TIM off of the CPU, I did the same but used a completely dry tooth brush and the stuff came right off. Its a Q6600 processor but otherwise you have to be REALLY careful not to bend the pins.

If you bend the pins, like I did on the old pentium IV that I'll be turning into a keychain (it was a commercial computer so not worth trying to rebuild) you can fix it by putting a straight edge like a knife in between the pins and gently bending it back where it should be.

What all tips and stuff have you guys got?

Also, this isnt cleaning/maintenence related, but I have 2 molex fans and 3 3-pin fans. My mobo has a single 4-pin header and a single 3-pin header. Needless to say, just about every single fan except for 1 will be running full speed all the time until I upgrade to a proper cooling solution. To get the extra 3-pin fan working, I cut the female molex off of the Pentium computer PSU, shoved some headers I had laying around into the wiring, and plugged it into the molex fan's connector. Now all of the fans should be working. This was a tricky situation because the front case fan is blue, the CPU fan is blue, and all the other fans are black. I wanted 2 CPU cooler fans to be blue and all case fans to be black so that only internal lighting is blue. This fixes all problems. Pics if you guys are interested, though the solution isnt quite finalized yet. I'm still waiting on shipment of GPU and RAM."	t5_2tj99	True

I bought a couple of new parts for my rig and I'm going to have to take it apart anyways and I figured while I'm in there I may be able to address some of these issues. I would like some advice about how to go about doing these upgrades.

**1: CPU cutout** - for whatever reason CM positioned the cutout so it wouldn't work with the LGA 1366 processor series so I have to remove my motherboard to reset my heatsink. I just bought a new heatsink so this might be the time to fix the issue. I know that people who do this have a tool called a dremel and the simple just cut it out. I don't have one and I don't think I have the budget to buy one at this point. Is there another way?

**2: Front usb 3.0** - new versions of the HAF 922 have front usb 3.0 instead of 2.0. Is there anyway to get a front panel either from CM or else where and add it in?

**3: Black interior** - how do people get their interior black? Do they use spray paint? or some other method? Do i have have to break the case apart into pieces and buy some kind of rivet gun? Or can it be done more simply?

If I would have known about the Corsair 650D at the time I bought my R4, I probably would have gone with that case. So, Is there anything I can do with my r4's already windowed side panel? I tried looking for non-windowed panels on Fractal Designs site but they don't sell them so I can't custom make one unless I switch my panels sides. But then I'd have a window on the back side exposing all the ugly cables. Anyone have any ideas? 	t5_2tj99	True

well. I recently found my old netbook, the MSI wind u230. it was great, good graphics card and processor in a small package until overtime it wore out. the hinged started giving out [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gUM5bJn) and eventually the monitor stopped working properly.

I'm getting the NZXT 820 (Black) and am going to buy a liquid cooling setup to go with is for my CPU (1155 socket) and 2 GPUs (7970). 

I am aiming for a orange and blue colour scheme. 

I have a blackwidow keyboard (blue led) and steelseries kana mouse (orange led) and want to stick with the theme. 

In the NZXT 820 I will have orange and blue LEDs but I don't know if the blue will over power the orange or something along those lines. 

I was thinking that the case's pre-installed leds would be orange and the back fan would be orange and then the bottom fan could be blue. 

The liquid cooling would be clear tubes with blue coolant. Once again, I don't know if the orange LED would affect this. Or if it would be better if I go blue tube with clear coolant or blue tube with blue coolant to make the colour stronger?

Any tips or advice on parts for the liquid cooling and how i should setup the lighting would be greatly appreciated. 

Maybe even a better colour scheme if there are any :)

I'd like to know the downside(s) to using glue before I implement it in my rig.


The process I use to secure the sleeving to the wire is:

1. Apply a thin, 1/4"" line of glue on two sides of the end of the wire (just below the first set of connector tangs)

2. Pull the sleeving over the glue and just past the first set of connector tangs

3. Pinch and roll the wire until the glue dries

4. Use a lighter to taper/conform the sleeving around the base of the connector pin

Okay so here's my idea, I apologize in advance for such a crude diagram. Just read the titles of each image as you scroll down. 

http://imgur.com/a/fUWD7

As you can see by the last two pictures, I could do two independent loops (1 CPU, 1 GPU) or one larger circular loop with dual pumps and a double wide reservoir.  Because of the radiator placement, the large single loop would not practically allow flow through both radiators back to back.  It would be radiator =&gt; 2 pumps and double res =&gt; radiator.


I'm by no means ready to hit the 'checkout' button on this, I don't even have a coherent parts list other than the case and the 5.25"" dual pump/reservoir. I'm just looking to see if the design itself has any legitimacy. I'd appreciate your feedback on ways it could work, ways it could fail etc. Thoughts?

(*Disclaimer*: I know this is going to be a challenge coming from no experience with WC, and I know I'm making it harder than it needs to be by picking a non full tower case.

I work as a moblie DJ and modded my desktop computer to make it easier to take and use at gigs. I DJ with a desktop instead of a laptop because I love power! A full size video card is nice to use when DJ'ing with music videos. An added bonus is the ability to upgrade and replace parts more easily than a laptop. 

My first drastic change was to bolt my monitor to my tower. This saves me a lot of time hooking up my monitor as it is always ready to go! Granted, I do lose a lot of adjustability.

My second innovation was to hook up a DJ usb controller into a spare 3.5"" drive bay. This way I just plop my desktop down and plug my PA system directly into the usb controller. Numark makes a small controller called the DJ IO that fit in the bay. I actually traded in a larger/more expensive/arguably better DJ controller because the DJ IO is so convenient and puts out a louder sound. 

Combined with a gear grip and a server power cord (into the PSU and monitor power supply) I have a DJ pc that is a portable plug and play powerhouse. Below is an album:

I've already got the money set back to buy a $4k+ build.  This will be my third computer and on my last I used an all-in-one water-cooler (H100). This time around I wanted to go all out. I plan on liquid cooling mobo, ram, cpu and 2 gpus.  In preparation I've bought a few parts already.

So far I've purchased the Cosmos II, an EK 360mm thin rad. 2x EK 240mm thick rads, an EK res, a few fittings, and about 14 120mm Bitfenix fans.  I already have the fans and rads in place in the case with the 360 on top (obviously) and the 2 240s in the bottom compartment where the 6 hard drive bays were.

My question: What's the best way to keep the second 240mm rad in place?  Right now the first 240mm rad is attached to the inside of the included bracket with fans on the outside.  It is then connected to the second 240mm rad via these little guys.  http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/big1mablrog1.html
http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/big1mablanad.html

Two more fans are then attached to the outside of the second rad.  Also, would putting a shroud inbetween the two rads be worthwhile?  I had planned on having two fans between them as well, but apparently the fans are just a few mm too thick.

I picked up my jigsaw I bought plugged it into my extension chord and started cutting. I immediately noticed that how I was cutting was wrong because the acrylic was  *cracking* so I stopped and thought about it for a second. I thought that if I slowed down the progression of cutting so as slow as I could and it still happened so I just kept cutting until I was finished. These cracks aren't such a big deal I could live with them but since I'm using a case that's pretty much trash and I am using to test my abilities since it's the first time *modding* I went ahead and made another cut in the metal on the top side. A few minutes later I am making another window from the acrylic this time when the chipping happens it's larger the first cracks where shorter that half your finger nail in length, these cracks on the second window are about 1-3 1/2 inches long and made triangle chipped pieces actually break off from the main part of the acrylic. r/pcmods...

1329357439.0	prn20	First true custom built pc and I have questions.		8	0	14	"Grammar Nazis: I apologize in advance.

Good evening gentlemen (and women). I'm building my first truly custom machine. In the past, I've done minor daily driver builds. Nothing extreme. My new build consists of: Intel i7-2700K, 2 GTX-580s (3gb), 1 GTX-470, 32gb Corsair Vengeance, Intel 520 120gb SSD, 4 2TB HDD, and an Asus Maximus IV Extreme MoBo.  Will have a dual loop liquid cooling system.

1.) What would be a sufficient power supply? I'm looking at the Antec 1200w. I believe it'll do but, I'm worried about not having enough juice AND not having room for upgrades.

2.) I have already bought my case, a Thermaltake Level 10 GT. I know it will suffice for what I want to do but, I think it will hinder me in the way I execute the build. Where can I sell a brand new case (can't return, as I no longer have the box)? And, where would be a place I can start looking for a good liquid cooling case?

3.) Will using the GTX-470 for physX bottleneck my performance? I have 2 of them, with liquid cooling blocks attached (original hardware available too). They where given to me for free and work great by themselves. But, I had already bought my 580s and not looking to return them.

Thanks for any feedback!

Note: The PC is overkill. Just accept this and move on.


EDIT: Just an update. I decided to stick with my 2700K. I have been itching for so long for a custom PC and this is my chance before I get bogged down with marriage and bills. So, I think, though my build will immediately be outdated (such is life), it will suffice for me. I believe it will still be insanely powerful. Thanks for all the help and comments. I'll be sure to post picks of the build as it progresses. I might even do a 3D pipe design of the dual loop cooling system I have designed.

EDIT 2: I am going to fab up my cooling loops using standard piping but, when its all done, I am going to switch it out for some nickel plated copper or polished 304 stainless steel. These will not be purely for anesthetics. Both are corrosion resistant and can be treated for bacteria. Both both nickel and SS are resistant. "	t5_2tj99	True

- Patience

------------

**Let's get to work:**

Prep work.

**1.** First remove the outer casing of your Qnix. How? Check this awesome **['Dismantling Korean QX2710' Playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnVkA6ZcoQv5piavGXZDJv3Wj2E4MT_iE)** if that isn't thorough enough or you want a second source, **[watch MenacingTuba dismantle the monitor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0EMmNmvFcAA#t=263s)** in his video review. Follow all of the instructions in the video until you have the LCD completely disconnected and sitting outside of the plastic casing.
**2.** Unscrew the PCB box from the back of plastic casing and then remove the metal sheet that protects the PCB by removing the screws. **[It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/mIqkaiN.jpg)** 
**3.** Unscrew the screws from the PCB and remove it from the metal casing.
**4.** Remove the speaker connections...sorry I forgot to take pictures of this step, but it's dead easy. Just follow the **[red and blue wires](http://i.imgur.com/K50Mkal.jpg)** from the speakers to the PCB and pull it out gently.
**5.** Screw the PCB back into the little metal mounts in the casing.
**6.** If you want to go ahead and paint the metal bezels then remove **[these three screws](http://i.imgur.com/QS0oi2B.jpg)** and follow **videos 12 &amp; 13 in [this playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnVkA6ZcoQv5piavGXZDJv3Wj2E4MT_iE)** to see how to remove the metal bezel. The trim tools come in handy here. **[Bezel Painting Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmods/comments/1h0k8a/my_guide_to_painting_your_bezels_matte_black/)**.

**While the paint is drying on our bezel, lets prepare the PCB Box/VESA mounting solution:**

**1.** Go to your local Home Depot/Lowes (or regional equivalent) and find 1/8"" Tempered Hardboard. You'll likely have to buy a huge 2""x4"" piece of it. Get them to cut it for you, I know this is a free service at Home Depot.

**2.** Have them cut you a few squares to the dimensions of 9.75"" &amp; 9.375""  pieces (just in case you screw up).

**[Tempered Hardboard pic](http://i.imgur.com/7MmpFAy.jpg)**

**3.** If you're lucky enough, the same store will carry the screws you need, otherwise you'll need to go to a specialty hardware store. You'll need **six** of each, 4-40 Phillips 3/4"" Flathead Machine Screws (1/2"" work too) &amp; 4-40 Phillips Hex Nuts. These Phillips screws will connect our PCB Box + Metal covering plate + Tempered Hardboard all together. More on that later. You'll need **four** of each, M4 Metric Machine Screws &amp; M4 Metric Hex Nuts. These M4 screws are for connecting our VESA monitor mounts to the VESA connector on the back of the PCB box.

**4.** Take the **[flat metal covering plate](http://i.imgur.com/9MlALrZ.jpg)** and line it up against one of your spare 9.75"" &amp; 9.375"" square pieces of tempered hardboard. This will be our practice board. Grab a sharpie and mark the 6 screw holes. Grab your drill and a 5/32"" drill bit. We want to drill from the fibrous/rough side of the hardboard through to the smooth side, so make your screwhole marks on the rough side. Drill your holes. Grab your hammer and on the smooth side flatten down the fibers that were pushed up due to the drilling (you'll see what I mean). Grab your Phillips screws. The metal covering plate will go on the smooth side of the board. Push your Phillips screws through from the rough side. If your drilling was accurate then it should all line up quite nicely. If not, then just grab another square piece of hardboard. You'll get it right this time. Bang down the fibers on both sides of the board around the drill holes. When our Phillips screws are pushed in we want their flatheads to lie very flushly with the rough side of the hardboard, as this side of the hardboard will be what is placed against the metal back panel of the LCD.

**5.** Grab the actual PCB box (and your Phillips Hex Nuts) and screw everything together.

**[It will look like this](http://i.imgur.com/9XLX44c.jpg)**.

**[Reverse side](http://i.imgur.com/gWCL6D3.jpg)**.

**6.** Great, our PCB box is finished.

-----------------

**Connecting the PCB Box/VESA Mount to the LCD panel:**

**1.** Use a ruler to find exactly in the middle where the PCB box will go.

**2.** Outline a square the size of the PCB Box.

**3.** Grab your 60 Grit sandpaper and sand down the area inside the square. No need to get too crazy, I just made straight lines in a checkerboard pattern.

**4.** Take a damp cloth and clean away as much debris/dust from sanding as possible.

**[Should look like this](http://i.imgur.com/B9mVtrM.jpg)**.


**5.** Tape up all of your cables onto the PCB box so they don't get in the way when we do our epoxy.

**[Cables taped](http://i.imgur.com/cyt8ckR.jpg)**.

**6.** Practice setting down your PCB box onto the outlined square so you don't screw it up when it matters later.
**7.** Get some disposable dishes and some sort of mixing utensil and squeeze out the entirety of both tubes of the JB Weld epoxy.

**[Epoxy 1](http://i.imgur.com/oEJ8uV2.jpg)**.

**[Epoxy 2](http://i.imgur.com/OPlVBl8.jpg)**.

**8.** Apply the epoxy evenly as possible within the square.

**[Epoxy applied](http://i.imgur.com/nDimap0.jpg)**.

**9.** Place your PCB box down firmly and remove the tape from the cables. Place something heavy on top of the PCB box. I used two bricks (that's what's in the plastic baggy - didn't wanna get brick dust everywhere) on top of a towel.

**[PCB Box placed](http://i.imgur.com/2zx32Wr.jpg)**.

**10.** Wait 48 hours for the epoxy to dry.

**11.** Take your Scotch 3M Mounting Tape and do like so over the back of the PCB box, **make sure you don't cover the power connector or DVI-D cable holes!** And don't take the red cover off the outside facing part of the tape, heh.

**[Taped up](http://i.imgur.com/ZY9wz5c.jpg)**.

**12.** Take the black foamy stuff that came with your Qnix and cut some of it to mount the monitor controls on. Sorry I don't have a really good picture of this. The reason for doing this is that I think some kinda electrical issues occur when the little PCB board of the monitor controls touches the metal of the LCD panel. I could be wrong...but...just do it.

I did it like this:

**[Controls mounted](http://i.imgur.com/3QqP1qL.jpg)**.

**13.** Reseat all of your cables.

**14.** Grab your M4 Metric screws and attach the monitor to your VESA mount. Place the nuts on the screws first and then put them through your stand's VESA holes and then into the VESA mounting pegs on the back of the PCB. Sorry this isn't the greatest picture ever.

**[Rear view](http://i.imgur.com/McYMVkv.jpg)**.

**15.** Sit down and admire your work, we're done baby.

If I missed something or you have any questions, feel free to ask.

1366182176.0	1cipwe	Couple of questions about Water Cooling, attempting my first custom loop.	hitsonblackgirls	7	0	30	"Hi all.

So recently I picked up a new case (Corsair 800D). I want to go ahead and build my first custom water-cooling loop, but have a few questions that i'd love to hear some advice on. First, here is my current rig:

* Case: Corsair 800D
* PSU: Corsair AX860W (Fully modular, Platinum rated)
* CPU: AMD FX 8350 @ 4.0 GHz (no overclock applied)
* Mobo: ASUS M5A99X Evo R2.0 (likely will be upgrading to a better AM3+ board soon)
* GPU: 2 x EVGA 660ti in SLI
* RAM: 16 GB (4 x 4GB) G.Skill 1600 MHz (will likely be upgrading RAM soon)
* SSD: 128 GB Intel 320
* HDD: 2 x 1TB Seagate Barracuda (Running in Raid 1 via Windows 7)

First, I am not sure what kind of power water-cooling tends to require. I plan on have a 360mm Radiator and cooling my CPU and eventually my GPU's as well (I am currently debating selling them and purchasing newer cards before putting money into water-blocks for the GPU. Will my AX860W be enough for this?

Second is if there are any reason why I should pick one type of fitting over another type (compression vs barb).

Third: What kind of pump should I be looking at? I'm not afraid to spend a bit extra if it means that I am getting a superior pump.

Any advice from people with experience in water-cooling would be great!

Mounting the cpu cooler causes the heat pipes to block the PCI slot. I can probably get passed this problem if I adjusted the angle of the heat pipes. So is there a way to easily bend the heat pipes without breaking or damaging the performance of the cooler?

UPDATE: So even with everyone suggesting me not to, I decided on bending the tubes after consulting some mechanical engineers at work. It was a bit easy to do since the cooler is an L shaped cooler, meaning the tubes were bent previously in two places, making them easier to manipulate. I just used my hands and bent each side one at a time. The end result is not bad. The angle is now straight. 

[Here is after my first bend, no cracks or damage](http://imgur.com/1avfb4s)

I am in college so I thought it would be nice if I could have it set up so that I can just plug in the power cord and it is good to go.  I was hoping to do a 20-22 inch single screen set up.

I was wondering what you guys thought about the potential of one.  I know it will be a lot more work than buying a cheap tower and just screwing things in but I would like the project.

I do however mainly want a computer that I can play games on at high settings, if this project is too unfeasible to turn out that well I would prefer to just have the regular set up.

I have never modded a case.  I have decent skills with a rotary tool and some assorted DIY work, and I know a decent amount about the hardware.  

I'm looking for any advice on whether this is feasible and if so how I might go about this.  I think I will try to save up maybe $900 for everything, I will need to buy a monitor and all the components.  I probably will be looking to try to recycle some things like a PSU to make budget.  

Some concerns I had thinking about this where if there would be enough ventilation and if I would have space.


Edit:  I should have been more clear this is definitely not a laptop replacement.  I have a laptop that will cut it for most functions, but it is becoming more and more outdated so I need a new computer for gaming.

Well, I have access to a CNC mill, so I figure I might as well go ahead and make my own.

My big question is this: 

Aside from a big copper plate that contacts the components, a sealed chamber for the liquid to flow through, and fittings for hoses, is there anything else that needs to be designed into the block?

I've researched and seen blocks that have heatsink fins inside the liquid chamber, so I'll probably put some of those in, but is there anything important other than that?

I cut off the plastic support for the top removable cover (not pictured), then cut the case mesh.  I used some u-channel molding around the edges to make it look a little cleaner.  At the rear, I didn't really want to stuff that 120mm rad inside the case and make things that much more cramped, so I cut two small holes to pass my fittings through.  I used the same u-channel molding for those too.

The steel has started to corrode. I will soon replace the steel sheet. I used a ton of zip ties to secure the wiring. I am using a fan controller with an AC adapter and 4 fans bought from new egg.

1364864203.0	1bhc92	Antec 900 - Adding a Third Front Fan		6	1	5	"Hi r/pcmods


I am working on my first build. Like everyone else in the world, I am looking for a great air cooling setup for a reasonable price. Hopefully somewhere in the 100$ range.


I am leaning towards the Antec 900 at the moment. I have seen some people alter the front of the case so that they have 3 120mm intake fans there instead of the 2 that come stock. 


Here's my situation:


I am only using  *one* 3.5"" internal hard drive. *My optical drive is external*, effectively freeing up space in the front of the case. I also don't plan to use a fan controller because if I understand correctly I can change the fan speeds by opening the case up and changing it manually, which I'm fine with.  (Could be wrong)


The ways I've seen this done are as follows:

1.) Using the bracket from the optional internal fan that is behind the HHD cages to mount a fan on the front.

2.) Using the bracket from the rear exhaust fan to mount a fan at the front and installing a new fan to replace the rear back exhaust fan

3.) Finding an Antec HDD drive cage with a fan in it and installing that.

The information/videos I have found on this are surprisingly vague. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. Option 1.) Seems viable. I have read that optional internal fan on the Antec 900 doesn't do a whole lot and from an air flow perspective I think a 3rd fan at the front to send air through the case and out the exhaust makes more sense. I think my setup actually makes it easier to do because I'm not looking to put an optical drive in, just one 3.5"" plain Jane hard drive


Has anyone done this to their 900?


Sorry if this is convoluted! This is my first build and a very big part of me has no idea what I'm doing, but it's fun nevertheless!

Edit - The problem I have is that the 200mm fan I have installed on the front of my case has a hard time getting air through the hard drive cages which are mounted behind the 200mm fan.

1358966384.0	174wd5	Planning on making custom, ATX-compliant case from scratch. I have a few questions regarding general hardware/material considerations.	Tarnate	6	0	6	"For starters, it will likely be built using custom-cut and 3D printed parts ordered from Ponoko (I have neither the space nor the tools to cut the materials at home), and it will have a very non-standard shape (along with probably a few non-standard features, such as off-circuit switch-operated fan system with it's dedicated power source, most likely a simple AC-DC adapter, possibly with slots for custom-made removable intake filters, probably made from nylon or metal net with a rigid frame). It will most likely be made out of acrylic panel (either clear or opaque black, possibly a mix of the two), with a frame possibly made out of aluminum sheet with either polyamide, ABS or, if I have the money and it will look nice, stainless steel joints. The case itself will be horizontal (non-tower), and will be composed of three main parts: the bottom, static base, and two upper ""shells"" that will open up [like one of those old floppy/CD cases](http://www.mwarnersales.com/warnersalesebay/photos/DSC10825.JPG).  The aim of that case will be to try providing as much accessibility and flexibility as possible (See, I fell in love with the access ease of an old Dell Dimension E520, but I can't recycle the case due to the proprietary formats) to mostly every part, and as such I aim to make as many parts removable and wireable from the bay access from above, as well as using as many screwless solutions as possible for the inner hardware (such as mounting brackets and snap-lock for the expansion cards). Motherboard IO panel and PSU will most likely end up on the left (although depending on how the design evolves it may still end up at the back), with ""frontal"" features (power buttons, USB ports, front audio ports) either on the other side or at the front, possibly at a 90 degree angle from the motherboard. There will be a high possibility of the PSU not participating in the cooling of the case (at least for the PSUs with non-linear cooling vents).

First question is obvious: any recommendations/warnings or such for the materials regarding their interaction with the hardware?

Second question: Is there any non-obvious hardware (by that I'm mostly thinking HDDs) that should not be placed in any other position than horizontal, or have any other consideration?

It came with no keyboard reciever, the wrong mouse for the combo bundle (it was supposed to come with an MX revolution looking thing, it came with an MK510 or something), and it was so filthy with so much crap between the keys that I considered it a biohazard.

Anyways, I assumed I could simply clean the thing out and it would feel like new again. I did, and it is damn near spotless now, but the keys still seem to stick. Its a silicon nub style keyboard, and its as if the silicon nubs dont have enough upwards force to counteract the stickiness of the plastic keys on the plastic key guide. The keys themselves are just regular keyboard keys but they have a little plastic ""piston"" that sits in a plastic housing of presumably the same material.

I figured maybe I should try sanding it but I just dismantled the whole thing again and upon closer inspection, there are some really weird nooks and crannies in here. I feel like i'll never get it sanded down enough to make any sort of a real difference.

(I also posted this in /r/buildapc)

I built my own laptop to an extent. MSI sells ""barebones"" laptops that come with the frame, display, ODD, battery, mobo, and GPU. I purchased and installed my own hard drives, RAM, and CPU. The one I have has an Nvidia GTX 570M videocard in it. It is a spectacular card for the price and fact that it is mobile.

The base clock for the GPU is 575MHz @ 850mV. I have overvolted it to 900mV and overclocked it 830MHz before artifacts appeared and eventually my computer crashed. I change the clock speed based on the games I play, but I usually operate between 470MHz and 700MHz. However, the combined excess heat generated from overvolting (which raises heat output exponentially) and overclocking (which raises heat output linearly) means that my games always run at 70+ degrees. Very demanding games run in the 80s. If I don't have my fans running at 100%, it is possible to hit 90+ degrees, which is very, very bad for my laptop. Right now, I can't afford to get a new gaming computer, and I'm an enthusiast, so I want to push this laptop to see what I can do. I have concluded that I want to install my own custom liquid cooling.

I already have a laptop cooler underneath at all times when I'm gaming, and I have a secondary USB fan that I use to help move air around my computer so the heat doesn't built up. I have also applied better thermal paste and more conductive thermal pads to the GPU heatsink. Thus, I have essentially tried everything. But I want to operate at maximum potential.

I have purchased [this low profile water block](http://i.imgur.com/w4bkXAK.jpg) on Ebay ^[link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Water-cooling-copper-Water-Block-water-cooler-Special-Price-Gift-/120989015383#vi-content) .

[This](http://i.imgur.com/DHtqrGw.jpg) is the inside of my computer.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/h9seXDK.png) is my plan for the water block and cooling setup. The block will be placed on top of the heatsink directly over the GPU core.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/dhfQwGZ.jpg) is a closeup of the heatsink.

I only have approximately 5mm of clearance between the bottom cover of my laptop and the heat spreaders on the heatsink. However, in order to conduct heat better, I will likely need to use a dremel to remove the few spikes  on the heatsink that will get in the way. In addition to allowing the water block to be more flush with the metal below it, it will give me the extra few millimeters needed in order to not have to modify the bottom cover of my laptop.

I will drill two holes in the back of the laptop for the tubing to get out, where I will complete the liquid circuit with a pump, cooler, and radiator/fan. This is where I need help. I don't know what to buy.

I know I need a pump and a radiator. And it needs to be powered by something. I was thinking something like [this simple pump](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Liquid-Cooling-System-Pump-PC-Water-Cooling-Circulation-Pump-12V-600L-hour-25dB-/190826770299?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c6e296f7b) with a super small reservoir built in (although I could buy a real reservoir if absolutely necessary) and a [cooling radiator](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Aluminum-Heat-Exchanger-Radiator-For-CPU-CO2-PC-Laser-Water-liquid-Cool-System-/151059918256?pt=US_Water_Cooling&amp;hash=item232bdf6db0) with a 120mm fan. Then I'll need to power all of this. I don't want to buy a full sized computer PSU, because that is overkill. But a simple AC to 12V DC adapter would be useful. [Would this work](http://www.walmart.com/ip/16318477?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227000000000&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=21486607510&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;wl6=19880599990&amp;veh=sem) do you think?

The only thing I have purchased so far is the water block.

**I know this is insane, but I really want to see what I can do with this water cooling. So if anyone could give me some advice on the radiator, power supply, and pump, that would be greatly appreciated. I am also completely clueless on what fittings and tubing I will need to purchase for this project.** 

Also, if there is a better subreddit for this, just point me in that direction.

My proposed modification involves a sheet of metal (Aluminum, or some other material) to be placed (with cable management holes cut) behind the drive cage area (Red area in picture below) and wrap the front of it with White Carbon Fiber Vinyl, as well as the nearby area of the motherboard tray so that it matches. I also plan to wrap the front of the front panel door in White Carbon Fiber Vinyl.

My second proposed mod is a type of Power Supply cover, which would go over the top and side of my power supply area (Color coded blue in the image), but would still be able to be removed for easy access to the PSU. This part I'm not as sure about, though I had the idea of make it screw into something (the bottom of the case, maybe?) so I can take it out but still have it be firmly attached while moving the case around.

My question for you all, is what materials should I use, and how would I best go about doing these two mods while achieving the best possible aesthetics?

Thank you for your time, and sorry for the wall of text.

Tips, tricks, materials, tools, and techniques?	7RED7	8	1	12	"I'm planning to modify the Corsair 600t and I would like to be able to do several things. Firstly, I will be doing with out a DVD drive (USB and networking are all I need for data transfer, I can make a windows ISO for USB, and I otherwise only get games through steam downloads) so I want to pop the unsightly drive bay grilles out, and instead of replacing them with something smooth (ala the ""30"" case on MDPC) I want to pop out the lower grille as well and install a single uniform grille that runs the entire height of the front panel. I would also like to make it easy to pop up with a removable dust filter mounted behind it.

I'm basically removing the drive bays entirely and mounting a second large fan above the stock so that the entire front panel is intake/exhaust [similar to what would be seen here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112159) but with larger fans. This will be exhaust if I put some large water rads in the front, or just a damn nice intake if funds end up tight and I drop down to air cooling.

[Here is my original concept for what I'm planning if it clarifies the situation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/zxj9l/what_is_the_largest_radiator_that_can_be_made_to/) Mostly I'm just interested in studying the craft of grillework and what I can do with it at the moment though.

I would also like to consider carving out the mesh in the primary side panel [seen here](http://www.corsair.com/pc-cases/corsair-computer-case-accessories/graphite-series-600-side-panel-with-windowed-and-mesh-inserts.html) to make mounts for larger fans or at least a greater number of 120's, with a new and slightly larger grill and easy to remove dust filter.

HP Elitebook 8530p (nothing fancy or impressive) with the single, built in, HD display.

What I want to be doing:

I want to attach a display from an old laptop in a manner that would allow me to have a second monitor attached, permanently, to my laptop. I would want it to sit on the opposite side of my screen facing outwards with hinges to allow it to swivel and sit adjacent to the built-in display. This would be useful for giving presentations (showing the presentation on the outside of my laptop while I run it from the keyboard side), watching movies, or using it generally as a second display next to my own when I'm working on personal things. Battery life is irrelevant at this point because mine needs the charger to run for longer than 45 minutes anyways.

Built in display: LG LP154WE2 (TL)(A8)

One I want to add: LG LP154WX4 (TL)(C4) out of an HP Pavillion dv6000

I guess the biggest question is whether this is even possible? Second, I just need a shove in the right direction as to how (if it even is possible).

I'm going to try and max out the fans on the case (so 15, since I should be able to mount an additional one on the front, and my heatsink supports two, so that should make up for the three lost).

Or am I going about this the wrong way, and is there a product that I'm missing that would do this easily?

Are you planning to get the case and want to know if some oddball idea will fit? Give me a couple points of reference and I'll try and get a (pretty close) measurement for you.
Are you wanting to expand something but you're just to busy to pull all your components out and measure that little bit way in the back? I'll try and get that for you.
I probably won't be cutting the upper drive bays out for a few days, so it would be a good time if you need anything measured to or from those.

**Q1: is there some kind of a female 2pin LED to molex connector? what is that called? Amazon preferred.**  

I have LED strips that my dad got for me. They are white LED strips, as I dont plan on putting any colors apart from white in this case. Unless, of course, there is such a thing as an RGB fan and RGB controller like NZXT Hue that can control everything all at once.

I plan on hooking these white strips up to the single 12 volt line that I have available on the built in fan controller. The LED strips my dad gave me will run on anything from 9-14 volts without needing heat sinks. I can run them in parallel and all I need to watch out for is too much current draw. i have no clue what kind of current draw these things use, but they are intended for use in vehicles, and according to him there is nothign I can do at 12 volts that will make them draw too much. They are a complete circuit, all they need is DC 12 volts.

**Q2: I'm just wondering how much current this fan controller is capable of really putting out on the LED lines, if that is a possible metric to get.**

**Q3: if anyone knows of a better white LED solution to light up the inside of this CM Storm Stryker that can connect to the stock fan controller's LED thing, I'd love to hear suggestions. Again, amazon preferred. I have prime membership and I dont buy from newegg anymore.**"	t5_2tj99	True

Today I installed some custom lighting effect in my reservoir using 5mm leds, saran wrap and duct tape. It was when I booted my system I noticed some strange things in my reservoir. 

[Here is a video for you!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrP1OXDMGZE)


I noticed the turbulence which you can see at the video above. The hole there is the inlet to the reservoir and the reservoir is a quite small single bay reservoir. My pump is a jingway dp-600p (600 l/h). The rest if the loop is the standard radator and cpu block.
Is the turbulence you can see above the inlet normal or is my pump to strong for such a small reservoir causing the turbulence that decreases the pump performance or something. 

I also noticed the plastic film swaying wildly around in that turbulence could that be the cause of this? Is that plastic film even supposed to be there because that does not look normal at all!
Should I like flip the case on its back, open the front and remove it?

Really, What i may end up doing is getting a multimeter and checking what powers what and how much voltage, but that is alot of work if there is something that can save me time and money.

I'm pretty good with most things, but struggling a little bit trying to figure out how to wire this switch (with built in led) to turn of a UV cathode.  The switch is in the link below.  The LED in the switch requires (I believe) 2 volts for the led.  I've tested the LED by wiring 2 AA batteries in a series for 3 volts across the 2 smaller poles and the light lit up.

http://www.mroelectronics.com/mro/product.php?id_product=172

My question is, where do I get the needed voltage to activate the led light in the switch when I use the switch to turn on my cathode lights?  I would like the led light in the switch to turn on when I turn on the cathode lights. Do I need to tap into the +5 volts of the power supply, then use a resistor to lower it to around ~2 volts, or is there another way?  Below is a picture I've taken showing my switches etc.

If anyone has or can find anything online I could look at, I would be very appreciative.1

I see lots of closed loop coolers crammed in this case for the cpu, but I want to do an open loop and get full cover water blocks for the video cards (I would like to xfire/sli if possible).

My plan would be to mount a large triple rad on the outside (because I already have a triple rad) either on the front or back (probably need rad boxes to hold it away from the side of the case). Barbs would sit at the top and come through the top 120mm fan (no need for that fan).

I would then go from the rad to the cpu, then cpu to the video cards; if I were to use full cover blocks I would need to run the coolant in parrallel through those blocks. I don't think I could run those block in series as there isn't enough room for 90 degree elbow between the two cards, or under the ""bottom"" card.

From the video card I would add a T-line for filling, and then go to the pump; where the pump goes I think is going to be the biggest problem. My thought is the bottom fan would come out and I place the pump beside the PSU, or I would place it above the PSU near the Ram/CPU. I already have a Liang D5 pump so space may be an issue... 

From the pump I would need to go back to the top to where the radiator barbs are.

My concerns are:

* clearance for full cover GPU blocks
* if running the video card blocks in parallel is going to be a problem if I overclock them and then run them hard for gaming
* where the pump will go and fit; I guess I could buy a smaller DDC3 pump.
* how this is going to look with a rad hanging off the side and how messy the inside is going to look if I put in a side window.

Does anyone have any opinions or thoughts about this? Can anyone find examples of anyone trying this type of cooling?

I was brain storming on how I would hook up my 3 7950's (2x 6 pin for those wondering) with making it look like an absolute mess. So, I figured that I could just make my own cables that are custom to the length that I need and sleeve them accordingly. The only issue is that I have no idea if this would even work. Would a single wire from the psu be able to output enough power to make it through all three or better yet, all six?

If there are any PSU guru's out there I would love to know if it would work!

My idea is to use angle to build a frame and put sheet on top of that. I'd definitely like to have an aluminum bezel, but other than that I'm not sure which metals would be best where. Note that cost is also a factor, a full aluminum case would be nice, but so far it looks like aluminum sheet is more expensive than steel sheet. Also, if anyone could point me to a good place to get metal from that'd be great (the site I'm looking at now is: http://www.metalsdepot.com/).

Another question: does anyone know of somewhere I could buy an ATX motherboard tray with the I/O shield cutout and PCI slots? I'd prefer to not make that myself as there are so many cuts and holes that need to be very exact.

At the time, the mac was cheaper then the alternative in PC hardware (also, its tri-booted with linux, OS-X and windows)

So, I have a interesting idea, and a problem I need to solve:

I have a late 2008 macbook pro 15' that's been my school workhorse sense 2008, and now its beginning to show its age. Most notably is apples lack of airflow to the GPU and CPU heat pipes. From my experiments, air is drawn in from the keyboard, over the RAM modules, though fans setup in push and then out the heat sinks and the back. What im wondering is due to this versions modular design, would it be possible to custom build a poly glass or acrylic back panel for it with holes (with filters) to increase the airflow?

1362849535.0	19z74q	Multi-device mod/cram into a server case. (Sun Enterprise 3500). Ideas? Advice?	DoxBox	3	1	7	"So, by chance, I came into posession of an old server, a Sun Enterprise 3500, which is a **tank** of a machine.


I gutted it this morning, and took some pictures. They are [here.](http://imgur.com/a/D0QDo)


I want to put all of my electronics in it.

That is, two computers, my stereo receiver, a set of lighted switches, a USB hub or two, a switch (so I only need one line for connectivity), basically whatever I can cram into this machine is going in. The particular parts aren't really too important to list, but the motherboards are an Intel DP55WG, with a single video card of low weight, and an MSI Z77A-G41 with two heavy Asus Radeon 7770s. I want this build to be as solid as the tank I'm building it in.


The hard drive mounting system is intact, and I would like to use it if possible. As shown, I also have six of the 8 hard drive rails. I also pulled off the heatsinks(?) from the hard drives; surely they couldn't hurt, and they seem to fit consumer drives just fine. 

If you look at the first photo in the album, you'll see the hard drive mounts are one solid piece with the rest of the front structure of the case, which is wholly removable. Without it, though, I would have to remount the door and lock in a different way. However, with the insane number of screws holding everything together, and the thick steel it is all made of, I can get away with a fair amount of ""trimming"" to fit things in. Lots of dremel work...

It has a key switch, which I intend to use. Going to have some tedious time with a multimeter unless I can find the pinout for it in the manual.


Ideally I want to spend as little as possible - I'm making an unrelated and expensive purchase later today that I'll be paying off for months. Scrap metal should be easily had, along with motherboard trays, common PC mounting brackets, etc. I have a fair number of fans, two cases I can cannibalize (plus a literally endless supply of generic office computer cases from each of my two workplaces.) 


Whatever tools I require are available.


Now, all that being said, I still have no plan of attack. 


Can anyone offer me some advice on how to mount the motherboards and video cards securely, in this space? They need to be mounted such that all my connectors are in one central location. Alternatively, advice on how to make extension cables to mounted I/O ports would be welcome.


Aesthetics wise, I want to try for an ""industrial danger area"" type motif. In the album I linked above, you can see some high voltage warning stickers in yellow and black, which I took from the mainboard's power supply connectors. Advice is welcome here, as well.


I know cramming all my electronics into one box isn't exactly an ideal option for those electronics; I will work around any problems that come up, this is something I've wanted to do for a long time. Make a box so complex it deserves the name DoxBox.


[Manual (PDF warning)](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19095-01/ent6k.srvr/805-2630-11/805-2630-11.pdf) in case anybody would like to know anything about this case, or how solid this thing is (count the f*cking screws), or the physical dimensions...


**TL;DR: Recovered Sun Enterprise 3500 server, turning into case for multiple computers and other electronics, advice would be helpful.


Edit: The last picture in the album is the filler panel, which goes in the back. I don't think it's big enough to mount a motherboard to, but a workaround may be possible. I was thinking perhaps, if I could, mount both motherboards to this, one of them upside down so the I/O ports of both motherboards are right next to each other but not in the way of each other."	t5_2tj99	True

Granted, their HDD bays are better than most in that style, but it was still a deal-breaker for me.

-the screen is held together with electrical tape, and the hinges are nearly shot. Some keys are missing/don't work as well
-battery is shot, so its stuck wherever its plugged in
-it has temp spikes up to ~80c for no reason, even sitting idle, leading me to believe the heatsink no longer functions properly (removed, cleaned, and replaced thermal compound to no avail as well)
I would like to somehow convert it to a htpc system, all in one nice looking case. The internals i can do without too much hassle.  The main issues I don't know how to resolve are replacing the heatsinks for the cpu and gpu. Are there existing coolers that can be modified for this purpose or will something need to be custom made? Is there a way to start it up remotely from full shutdown?

I'll be cutting the 5m LED strip ([eBay description here](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/5M-Orange-Non-waterproof-SMD-3528-Flexible-300p-LEDs-60LEDs-M-Strips-Light-/120927043391?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item1c27d03f3f#ht_3635wt_1396)) into four separate pieces as pictured. I then plan to solder copper wire between each of them.

The power leads will connect to a 4-pin molex from my power supply. Since the LED voltage input is 12VDC, I'll be connecting only the yellow and black wires from the molex source.


Is there anything I need to know before doing this? Am I missing something crucial that could potentially blow up my LED's or power supply?

Thanks :)"	t5_2tj99	True

sorry this isn't a crazy or special mod, but I want to get some LEDs for inside my case. Can you guys suggest to me what you use? Which ones I should get?

1338328965.0	ub17z	tx750w fan replacement/fix		2	0	4	"I just broke the fan blade on my TX750W power supply. it was a really old second hand PSU and I was trying to get fist sized dust bunnies out of it using an air compressor thing while holding the fan in place to keep it from spinning. I accidentally let the fan go and it revved up. When I tried slowing it down I guess it clipped something or another and one of the fan blades snapped clean off. I do have a 140mm fan that came with my case and I will be upgrading my entire cooling solution after I can finally afford a monitor. Is it worthwhile to try to open up this PSU and shove a 140mm fan from my case into this PSU? I dont know what speed it needs to run at or anything or if it needs to run slower or faster than a regular 140mm fan.

**EDIT** so I popped that .16 amp fan into there. It never spins anyways. I think i'm not taxing the components anywhere near enough for it to actually make the PSU work hard at all, and I wouldnt be surprised if the fan doesnt even make a difference in the long run. Either way, when i do a cooling upgrade i'll be ordering some proper fans and doing it up the right way."	t5_2tj99	True

I would really like to run a watercooling setup inside an H630 but I'm concerned about the front intake, as it is only a strip up 2/3rds of the right front panel and I don't think 2x or 3x NF-F12s would be able to push sufficient air over a rad inside.

Now I understand the H630 is intended to be silent, but I couldn't care less about that aspect, I simply like the looks.

I'm trying to determine if it would be worth my time modding in a mesh panel onto the front piece, similar to what Fractal Design's Arc Midi R2 has going.

Also I know I could purchase a Phantom 630 side-window but I dislike the mesh cutout on the bottom of it, so I would prefer modding something myself.

1375760952.0	1jsfgh	Need some help with designing and choosing mechanism for a pcmod, any help would be appreciated	peace_suffer	1	0	7	"###Project:

I need to make an arm that my [monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824001181) can mount to. The arm I had planned was something like an [anglepose lamp's arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglepoise_lamp), only I want to make it out of wood with metal springs, instead of all metal.

###Where I Need Help

1. Wood choice: What would be the best choice wood to use for this project? 

2. Since it's with wood, it will be very difficult to match the design of the metal anglepose lamp. What would be the ideal design for the arm, to allow maximum mobility, tension, and durability?

3. The arm can't be standing. This is meant to free up space on my desk, so I would prefer to mount it to the side of my desk (there is a 2x4 (4cmx9cm) runner on either side to secure the arm to. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to do this to still allow maximum range of motion of the monitor?

4. This is a large monitor, and quite heavy. The mounting plate needs to be able to adjust independently from the arm. This would require more springs to accommodate, but how would I integrate that with the arm?

5. Again, this is a large monitor, and quite heavy. When I put it at a certain angle, I want it to *stay* in that angle. What weight/length/size springs would be sufficient to do this?

2 big snags I see for this mod is figuring out how to display the ram (extended away from the MoBo and placed next to it). Do ribbons for 240 DIMM exist? Looking online seemed fruitless. Someone on a forum pointed out that the added length could affect timing which I'm currently accepting as the reason for why these dont seem to exist. Which brings me to snag #2.

* I mostly do network administration, with a bit of gaming in my off hours. I do a little image editing and video on this. It's also my primary audio source.
* I'd like to get a third Hanns-G 27.5"" but the supply on that appears to have dried up all of the sudden. I'm also planning a second video card so I can do SLI, as well as a second 256 SSD so I can do RAID 0 because the added capacity would be nice, as well as being able to utilize the throughput of both 6 Gbps channels at once.
* I'm running Polk Audio Monitor 30 Series II speakers and a Polk PSW10 subwoofer off an old Denon 80 watt/channel receiver.
* I just added a second GTX 560 Ti and configured SLI, as well as a third monitor. Unfortunately this covered my PCI slot and I'm doomed to onboard sound until I can get a PCI-e Xonar Essense STX.
* I should also say that a fair chunk of these parts were cannibalized from my last machine (rotational hard drives, optical drives, sound card, keyboard and mouse, and one of the monitors)."	t5_2tj99	True

1357789629.0	16aky7	I have a crazy laptop cooling question that I need insight on.	CoolMcDouche	1	0	4	I have a crappy Dell Studio 1537 laptop.  And My gpu/ram tends to get really hot while playing certain games.  I've began tinkering with custom cooling ideas/methods to try to suck as much heat off the chipsets as i can.  When I got the computer (Free from a previous job.  I'd never pay for this piece of shit), there was a thermal pad between the gpu chip and the heatsink/heatpipe that connected the rest of the system to the cpu and then eventually the fan/main heatsink assembly.  So I removed the pad and placed a thin piece of copper that had been cleaned and had artic silver 5 on both sides to help transfer heat between the gpu and the mini-heatsink piece above.  It seems to have helped a bit with heat transfer.  Now here's the crazy part.  Would it be worth removing that section of the heat-control section [the part here below the cpu-cooling portion of the pipe assembly](http://i.imgur.com/2P6FM.jpg), and putting a permanent larger heatsink on the gpu?  I have a cooling pad that sucks air from the bottom of the laptop through cooling vents directly above the gpu and ram.  And also, is there any home-brew method to cool ram sticks in a native flat laptop layout method.  Does it do any good to cool the single side that is facing away from the motherboard, if you can't cool the side that faces it?  If this is tough to understand please let me know.

1353975466.0	13ucfg	MDPC-X Crimping tool.. O M G!	NotAnotherHong	1	0	0	"First off! Build quality looks amazing!! I haven't used it to crimp just yet, but playing with it, the feel is exceptional!! I've applied light torsion to it (twisting it with my hands), and the play I feel is minimal. I'd say there's maybe 1 mm of movement, and that's because the tool is designed to move. No way that anyone would call it slop. The frame is thick and the tool is heavy. The handles are a hard plastic, and very sturdy. They are ergonomically curved to fit the hand, and I feel no rough edges or corners. There are indents for your fingers, and while they are fairly wide (for larger hands), my smaller hands fit the tool perfectly. The ratcheting mechanism is satisfyingly crisp. There are Phillips head bolts holding the crimping heads firmly in place, and presumably to replace them when worn out or damaged. Although the chances of that happening (in my estimation at least) are slim to none, unless you are abusing the tool :P. The entire tool is matte black including all the hardware and c-clips, save for the shiny ""VPA GS"" sticker.

This is German craftsmanship at it's finest!!

For those of you who don't know, MDPC-X is a German site (and presumably company) run by a guy named Nils. He states that he built MPDC-X on the premises of No Compromises, and from looking at the quality of the Crimping tool, it is evident! There are no rough edges or burrs, and no scratches in the finish. The feel is industrial, and I actually prefer this to the shiny chrome plated tools that are so prevalent in the American consumer tool sector... For those of you not in the EU, it's a bit tough to get the tool, as you have to hit the international website at certain times (the next open time is listed on the website). His reason (in his own words): 
&gt; Sure, I could transform MDPC into a bigger company, sell more, earn more, begin to compromise on products and service, give my products to resellers etc. ...
&gt;... but turning MDPC into ""just another average company"" is not what I want! I am Nils, not a ""shop"" :D  

I love this attitude, and couldn't agree more!!

When I finally got the tool in the mail (I ran into shipping mayhem due to Turkey day here in the States...), it came in a plain padded manila envelope, and on the back, he drew a little picture! :D I can't say how much the little touches like this make me happy. The tool came in a plain white box, and came with test crimps from my tool in a little baggie. 

Again.. The little touches that are huge. 

The tool came with 60 crimps for fans, 50 male and 50 female crimp contacts for ATX/PCIE/EPS. Also in the package came a sample of his sleeving. I'm not a sleeving guy, but the sleeving is a much higher quality than the kind that came on my PSU. After playing with it a bit, it's easy to see why people like it so much!! It's a bright and vibrant fluorescent orange. (Typing this, I set it on my back lit keyboard, and it reacts to the LED lighting by glowing. This makes me think it's UV reactive, and might look awesome in the right system...)

To sum this up, I was told that this is the best ATX crimping tool out there, and I am NOT disappoint. I haven't had a chance to use the tool yet, but I see no reason to doubt the claims on this tool.
As for MDPC-X.com, I think I've found a favorite vendor, and have it bookmarked!!!"	t5_2tj99	True

I'm not sure if this helps or makes it worse but it may be useful to know.

Thanks in advance!

1345563925.0	yl1zk	Externally mounted Antec Kuhler 620	quantum2384	2	1	0	As the title says I want to mount my Antec Kuhler 620 radiator on the OUTSIDE rear panel of my Thermaltake MSI. The radiator doesn't fit right on my case and I had to rig it on a top panel with two screws (but about 1/8 of it is covered by solid top). It doesn't feel stable there, the fan cause it to shake, and I think having it mounted outside will lead to overall temp decreases. I've read how to take apart the tubing with out cutting and it seems simple enough, but I am not really trying to add a resevoir into my case since it is cramped as is. Has anyone had experience taking one of these bad boys apart? If I position the barbs to point up and apply pressure to the outlet while passing them through one at a time, will I loose any coolant? And if I do loose a little bit, will it matter? Is there an easy way to empty and fill it up?	t5_2tj99	True

It's aesthetic just really hits the spot.

I don't really ever plan to install a cd/dvd/br/etc. drive, and will only be mounting one or two SSD's in the bottom of the compartment (backups and storage will be on external 1+TB drives that follow me around everywhere). So I would like to knock out the upper drive bays (the lower drive bays can conveniently pop out and be moved further into the case so they are not a problem), pop in a new fan to match the original below it (hopefully making the case a bit more of a wind-tunnel), and rework the entire front with a new grille and high quality dust filter so that it looks homogeneous.

I have never attempted a case mod before in my life, and I don't really know what factors I need to consider here besides ""how am I gonna remove the stuff"" and ""how am I going to make a mount for the fan"".
Any advice or comments would be welcome. :)

The only problem I have is that it's quite plain. Solid black, with an unpainted interior, no lights, and no window. It's not flashy. 

What kind of mods would r/pcmods suggest for a beginner, without costing too much? I don't want to spend more than $50 on materials, any more and it would be better just to buy a different case. 

I definitely want to paint the case, add some lighting, and add a window. 

• Thoughts on colour schemes? I was thinking white with gold accents. 

• Lots of people suggest using automotive paint. Will it work on plastic? Will I have to put it into a pneumatic gun or buy a spray can type thing? Will the case need sandblasting first?

• Can I paint a fan?

• Which kind of lights are most cost effective? How do I connect them to power? How many will I need?

• Lighting colours?

• Proper procedure for adding a window? Cheapest source for the acrylic? (Location: British Columbia)

• Any other cool ideas?

From dotems
If your looking at the Sabertooth then you may want to consider putting in a little effort and just making a cover out of perspex yourself it would not be particularly difficult but you would want to do it properly then just paint it a mat black and you can use an motherboard you want, as well as that you would have something you could really call your own. Just find a motherboard with all black or black and red heatsinks and slots and your good to go it doesn't matter what color the PCB is. If done right you can cover anything you don't want up even slots you aren't using, in every pc build I have seen where the builder has taken the time to do it well it looks amazing. I'll try to find you some examples and edit them in to this post. Just something to consider before buying an expensive mobo you may not completely utilize for anything other than aesthetics, something I do completely understand and appreciate by the way. If you are willing to spend a bit more boards look absolutely amazing the MSI Big Bang Mpower boards look amazing for a black build and have no red which would look really nice with some more subtle red ram and other components.


I might actually do this, having cut outs for the PCI slots, heat sinks and RAM slots on my ASROCK Z77 Extreme 4, I would probably cover the final cut out persprex in a carbon fiber vinyl wrap or a matte black vinyl wrap.
The big question I have is that would I run into any heating problems with my MOBO, I have no plans in over clocking and such.

1372697078.0	1hfnrd	Open/constant flowing water cooling loop? good or bad idea?	Jaynight	1	1	4	"So I recently bought my first house and am thinking of using this to upgrade my water cooling system in my PC.  Its currently just a small 240mm Rad Pump and CPU block.

The option I was thinking of are:

1) Run some tubes down to the basement and put the radiator, and pump in the basement. Logic behind this is the basement is fairly cold and there is lots of space down there.

2) Very interested in this option.  I noticed my PC room is above the main water line coming into the basement. This gave me the idea of just branching off of my water main, run a line to the computer and then a drain line back down to the basement. This would give the computer access to water that is always between 5-10 degrees Celsius. However my main concerns with this idea are: 

 Build up - Would counter with putting a Reverse Osmosis system before the water heads upstairs. This would make the water distilled quality and since the water is clorinated organic things should not grow. 
 Pressure - The Reverse Osmosis would help with this some however a pressure reducer may still be needed as the water comes in at about 40 psi.
 Condensation - On hot humid summer days large amounts of condensation would form on the pipes and possibly inside the computer. 

Just wondering does this sound like a bad idea or does it actually make sense? Input would be great.

However, each core is hyper-threaded as well making a total of 4 ""cores"" viewed by my computer. I've got a friend with a quad core, running at the same 2.40GHz. For a program that ONLY uses a single core, like Minecraft, is my hyper threaded machine a crutch?

Considering both of our systems have cores running at 2.40GHz and Minecraft can only use 1 core I'm assuming hyper threading takes that 2.40GHz core and splits it into 2 1.20GHz ""cores"". Considering it doesn't really notice or use the other cores, regardless of if it was 2, 4, or more. Otherwise, wouldn't I be getting the same framerate as my friend rather than less? I've already ruled out RAM and the graphics card as the issue.

Is my idea on how hyper threading works correct? And if so, and I disable it, would I see a performance increase in Minecraft? How would it affect my other software? I normally keep Waterfox, Steam, Trillian, and Raptr up from start up to shut down, unless I'm playing Minecraft, in which case I close out Waterfox and Raptr and set Trillian to Away. I also use Photoshop CS2 for drawing but that's rare.

I've been searching for a i5/i7 compatatible light colored motherboard and can't seem to find one. I am trying to keep a RGB color scheme through the build. Suggestions?

Other option would be fabricating some sort of motherboard cover/shield. What kind of problems would that pose to cooling?"	t5_2tj99	True

I want to paint my motherboard black and I understand painting it will trap heat and there is a very big chance of the things shorting/melting/going kablooy but it's worth a try right?

Not really. It isn't worth it but I want to do it.

~~I want to ask three questions. The first is;~~ What kind of paint do I need that isn't conductive and doesn't have any chemicals that can ruin plastic or whatever, matte or even Plasti Dip maybe?

~~Second question. I'll need to cover some of the pins obviously so will any kind of masking tape do? I don't want to short anything.~~

~~Last.~~ What are my chances of success?

Edit: I'll be painting everything except for the pins. I'll insert some old broken ram pieces and pci stuff in the slots so paint doesn't go inside."	t5_2tj99	True

1362607777.0	19swu0	Paint for a video card shroud? Sorry if this is a stupid question	khushi97	2	4	6	Well I've got a black and white themed build and would love my [ASUS DCII GTX 670](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121659) to be white with black stripes to match better. Is there any type of paint that can withstand the high temps of a graphics card? This one runs pretty cool, 55C max. Also, the shroud is all metal.	t5_2tj99	True
