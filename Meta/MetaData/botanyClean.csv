1366851428.0	1d1tra	A plant identification site that I've been working on	Tude	53	1	31	"[Link](http://plantfinder.nfshost.com/search.php)

So, I've been working on this site off and on for a few months. The whole point is to help people identify plants using a wider array of traits that those used in keys (which tend to be heavily based on minor details of flower parts), and with a fuzzy bayesian-like search algorithm. Normally, sites use an all or nothing approach to searches.

I realize that the HTML is barely functional and there is little in the way of 'design' at the moment, because I'm just trying to get the base functionality and infrastructure down. I think that I sufficiently protected against injection attacks and stuff like that, but I backed everything up in case some jerk decides to mess things up.

I've also got some ideas of how to spruce up the functionality, like having conditional traits. Maybe the flower traits shouldn't really show up if a person selects 'gymnosperm' or 'cone' for instance. However, I designed the database to very flexible and easy to expand in all sorts of ways, so I can add all kinds of functionality later.

Right now, I have characterized a comprehensive list of plants (about 104spp) from the Sehome Hill Arboretum in Bellingham, WA, USA. This is just a starting list for developmental and practical purposes. Few other plants have been added.

I want to know what people think works and what doesn't. Which traits are useful, which are superfluous, which are confusing, etc. I want it to be useful for everyone with maybe a little bit of overarching coaching/guidance (like a quick explanation of how composite flowers work, or something). I just want some input to help make it better.

Right now a help system is in place, although it's pretty rudimentary and only a few topics have any substance. Not all inputted data is 100% accurate, although it should be for the most part.

So yeah, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. :)

edit: Question to anyone: How might I go about getting some sort of income from this? I'm not trying to be greedy, it's just that I'm not in a great financial place at the moment and can't afford to spend as much time on this project as I could otherwise. Do you think that people would want to donate to the project, or something like that? "	t5_2qrcz	True

Hi fellow Botanists!

As some of you know, there has been talk of improving r/botany lately. With so many fellow Botanists on reddit, it seems appropriate that we should have a more 'updated' subreddit for us. 

Here is what we have been talking about behind the scenes:

* A FAQ that will define what Botany is and what it is not
* Have a list of common characters and character states
* Have a link to APG III and how it relates to Evolution
* Start a weekly peer reviewed journal paper discussion
* Other ideas (your input)

In the FAQ, we have the following questions lined up:

* What is a Plant?
* What is the difference between Botany and Horticulture?
* Can you help identify this plant for me?
* I want help building a garden for fresh vegetables and herbs, is this the right place?
* I want to know more about careers in Botany, where do I start?
* How do Botanists classify plants?
* What are the parts of a flower?
* Where can I learn more about the native plants in my area?
* What are the best Botany textbooks out there right now?
* I have a question related to Botany, but I don't know how to ask it. What do I do?
* How do Botanists feel about illegal plants?
* What is Arabidopsis and why do I keep seeing that name everywhere? 
* What is the current research trend in Botany?
* I want to do a botanical experiment in my free time, what should I do?
* What are statistics and how do they relate to Botany?
* Other questions answered (your input)

Does anyone have any input on what else to add to the FAQ? Or perhaps other ideas to help improving this subreddit? What do you wish was easily available, but is currently not?

I was just wondering if any of you in the field could give me some advice about what sorts of jobs exist for someone with a bachelor's degree.  Additionally I've thought about gettin at a Master's perhaps.  What do you think that would add to my opportunities?  I think I'd like to work as a breeder or managing a greenhouse but a nursery would fit me as well I believe.  Any sort of input is welcome.  If this was posted in the wrong place just lemme know where it belongs.  Thanks in advance! 	t5_2qrcz	True

1323785903.0	nazsw	"/r/Botany reading week 1. ""Patience Yields Secrets of Seed Longevity"". "	Young_Zaphod	18	1	9	"Based on interested garnered from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/botany/comments/nag0w/would_rbotany_be_interested_in_collectively/) topic, I have found an article for this week. I decided not to pick a published scientific paper for the first week, but instead an article written based on an ongoing study about seed longevity. The paper itself is fascinating, and brings up some interesting points (as well as a little bit of history about Botany over a century ago and its relevance in today's world). I figured this would be a good way to test the waters. 

**The full text of the article can be found [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/291/5510/1884.full).**

This study has been ongoing at my University for over 120 years now. Feel free to post questions, thoughts, and comments in response to the paper. Here's a few points to get you started:

* What relevance does seed longevity have in today's world? (Think about farming, land clearing, and other land allocations).
* How significant is seed longevity in your field of study? Do you have anything to add to the article that others may be interested in?
* What abiotic factors affect growth initiation?
* What suggestions do you have for this link, or for future links? 

Enjoy the paper!"	t5_2qrcz	True

Hey all, I've never posted to this ~~thread~~ forum, I'm active on /r/microgrow where the main focus is on cannabis. I'm a legal grower myself and have 17 years experience of growing a wide range of plants indoors from propagating orchids with an aeroponic system, experimenting with duck weed (neat little plant), Fuji apple on a P-22 super dwarfing rootstock on top of the more typical plants such as tomato (both determinate and indeterminate),  peppers, basil, stevia, lettuce etc. I have no formal education, never even passed a trig course, but also do theoretical and real research in chaos theory, neural networks, [synthetic nervous systems](http://www.google.com/patents/US20070285040?dq=synthetic+nervous+system+for+robotic+locomotion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bWCTUM3sLOKDiwKInIGQBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA) based on coupled sine wave oscillators to simulate neuronal central pattern generation clusters, etc. Here's a [wiki](http://www.beam-wiki.org/wiki/Tom_Jenner) someone did on me.

I wanted to share a technique that I've been using for 4 years now  that can radically alter the morphology of many plants. It's patent pending and I'm only describing part of the work here. It's actually much more encompassing. I've lost most of my pics when a trojan wiped my hard drive and the external hard drive so some of the pics are going to be pics and photos printed out. It's a shame because I've spent a lot of time [light profiling plants](http://i.imgur.com/xeKfr.jpg) usually with 10-13 different light combinations and 4 seedlings (which is a bit low but I only have so much room, 7 would be more ideal).

SLT is the selective manipulation of light sensitive proteins. I believe it's the photropin protein group that is having the main effect in what I'm doing but could also be the crytochrome protein group. Regardless, by using LED light sticks [such as these](http://i.imgur.com/JgVGR.jpg) to directly illuminate the stem of a plant at around 500uMol/meter^2 /sec, one can turn a normally 8 feet tall pole bean in to a full yielding 8 inch tall pole bean as [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/0j8DO.jpg) and instead of normally 6 inch long internodes [you get this](http://i.imgur.com/HZzCM.jpg) which allows a very productive protein producer to be grown indoors. (An interesting thing about Kentucky Wonder pole bean is that it will fully flower out under 24 hour lighting but won't continue to flower out until 18 hours of light, 6 hours of darkness. Which proteins are responsible for this particular phenomenon, CONSTANS, the Flowering Locus proteins, APETALA etc, I have no idea. It does add an interesting twist to the florigen hypothesis). 

How the light sticks are used is like this as shown with [C. sativa (Jack Herer)](http://i.imgur.com/dwLo5.jpg). Blue side lighting alone will not accomplish the same effect. The lights need to be up close and the light uninterrupted. The light sticks are ran and wired up parallel daisy chain such as how one would run drip emitters. In the case of the Jack Herer plant, and with [intracanopy LED lighting](http://imgur.com/WDGr3), 75-100% greater yield per area is easily achieved. A [foil wrap](http://i.imgur.com/brrUX.jpg) is sometimes used with a small fan but foil wrapping really only makes sense with high value plants.

To give some more examples, here's sweet basil with the blue lights sticks but with a minus blue light source on the leaves. You'll notice that the leaves are [4 times larger than normal](http://i.imgur.com/e2dqQ.jpg) in a compact plant. This wouldn't happen with a minus blue light source alone (it would grow very poorly if at all) nor can it be done with blue light on the leaves. I tried growing some lettuce leaf basil, which already produce leaves 4 times larger than sweet basil but could not get the leaves to grow any bigger regardless of the light combinations used. This is very interesting from a microbiological standpoint. Genetically, sweet basil can produce giant, more productive leaves. These techniques had very little affect on purple basil.

Here's [jalapeno](http://i.imgur.com/bGtGh.jpg) that went through SLT and what the [stem looked like](http://i.imgur.com/ls9wE.jpg) after harvest. For many plants 4-5 nodes per inch is typical.

Here's an example of another cannabis plant (unknown strain) also with [4-5 nodes per inch](http://i.imgur.com/9E8K3.jpg). The sticks are to spread the leaves so I can take the picture.

I've also been working with hardwoods like [Fuji apple](http://i.imgur.com/vddhA.jpg) and the technique appears to work as long as you hit the stem with the intense blue light before the bark forms to produce more compact apple scions. This may allow the possibility of using more productive rootstocks. I wish to try it with coffee since coffee trees tend to be pruned back to 6 feet tall every year, more lower branching could allow for greater yields.

So, it will be at least 18 months to get this to market but I wanted to show people how to make the light sticks for non-commercial and educational use. The LEDs are oval 20x55 degrees. 20 degrees from side to side allows aiming slop and to also hit the side branches to help shrink them also, 55 degrees up and down allows for light overlap. It's best not to use round beam pattern LEDs. The LEDs can be bought [here in the US](http://ledz.com/?p=leds.oval). Use part number 725LB7C . Three LEDs in series with a 330 ohm resistor and put them in a linear array is what you want. The Chinese LEDs need to be under driven so they'll last and the arrays will work from an unregulated 12-14 volt power supply for safety and cost reduction. It's a good idea to [encapsulate them with 5 minute epoxy](http://i.imgur.com/lQUFo.jpg) since hydroponic solution will quickly destroy the light sticks. If you're careful, encapsulation isn't needed.

I'm only allowed 1000 word posts so I can answer questions in the comment section. I would like to point out that I'm looking for a non-profit group to give majority rights to and to bring the light sticks to market. I'm thinking of a number much higher than 51% when I say majority rights. I'm currently meeting with a large non-profit for this purpose.

As mentioned, this is the tip of the iceberg.

I'm 21 living in the States, and finally getting up the courage to go to college, and my interest is primarily with plants. I was wondering if anyone could give me a no-bullshit account of what it's like to be a botanist. I understand there are a lot of different types of botanists, I was hoping to do as much work outside as possible, though I'm quite sure that I'm romanticizing what day-to-day life would truly be like. Ideally I think it would be great to travel to remote locations looking for new plants, but I'm sure those jobs are hard to come by. Another question was whether or not a bachelors would be sufficient? I would guess that most of the jobs are in research, which means graduate school right? Any information you can give me to help get me started with knowing whether or not going to school for this is a good idea would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!	t5_2qrcz	True

1362145270.0	19gmbn	Looking to get into botany, need some help.	TheCrazedChemist	17	1	17	I have recently become interested in botany, specifically as a potential research focus (I am a sophomore chemistry major/ biology minor, and have to do some sort of research for my major). However, I don't know very much about botany; the last time I learned about botany specifically was in 10th grade biology. I want to learn at least the basics of the field so I can decide for sure if I want to pursue this further, but I don't really know where to start. I can't really just buy a textbook unless I can find it for free someplace, so that's an obvious limitation. So does anyone know of any source of basic information about botany, preferably one that focuses on it from the viewpoint of chemistry, and maybe discusses practical uses of plants? I know that a bit specific but the more criteria that are met, the better.	t5_2qrcz	True

Robert_Bork	14	1	6	"So I've been getting into Tree ID a lot and I've been doing some basic botany reading. Maples, Ashes, Dogwoods, and Horse Chestnuts/Buckeyes, I guess, all have opposite leaf patterns. Everyone else has some fraction made up by the Fibonacci sequence (alternate or spiral). I read that this is a consequence of different types of auxin (growth hormone) causing different leaf growth patterns. So that's the proximal cause of leaf patterning.

But it doesn't get to the distal cause. Is this just an arbitrary mutation which has no bearing on genus survival? Is it a spandrel or exaptation? If so for what? Do maples have some disadvantage?"	t5_2qrcz	True

Being the inventor-y kinda person I am, I thought to myself ""I wonder if I could make a potted plant/soap dish, and eliminate this annoying problem.""  Then I thought ""wow, are you dumb, that would kill the plant!"".  Finally I thought, ""Reddit is smart, why not ask /r/botany?""

So.  Are you aware of *any* plants that:

(a) &lt;3 soapy water enough to be doused in ~100-150 millilitres/week.  Could potentially be supplemented with additional water to dilute.

(b) Could work as a potted/house plant.

My questions are pretty basic. Should I as a non-botanist consider gathering seeds to donate to a conservation society like Kew or the RBS? If so, how? 

I can update this post with pics to verify the ID later this afternoon if requested.

Edit: I'm pretty sure it was a misidentification at this point. I originally posted this based on loose direct observation and word of mouth from another, but it seems more likely to be a sweet Betsy (Trillium cuneatum) with pronounced mottling based on info at hand.

Anyway, I cut most of the stem off so I could float it in a clear cup of water and put it by a windowsill, just so it would look/smell nice.

A few years ago some of the plants developed bad fasciation and then would keel over and die. Now they will only grow a few inches before getting this problem. I can't see any sign of insect damage or signs of bacterial/fungal on the stems. The roots look rotten when I pull the plant up. IMHO it must be a virus or bacteria or maybe a fungus in the soil. No other plants in the garden show the same symptoms. 

I can't see anything online about this problem and given the harm this  plant's done in the US/Canada would anyone be interested in a sample of one of the plants/soil? 

Some bad photos. This is only one of two in the garden from at least +20 a few years ago.

However, none of these cite any kind of reputable source (or source at all).  I understand the leaves are toxic, but I don't think that warrants extrapolation to the wood itself.

The only thing I can find that *barely* merits concern is that maple has the potential to exude creosote when burned-- but this wood won't be burned, it'll just be chewed on.

I'm starting to wonder if this is just something that's been telephoned for so many generations it is now a misconception.  I appreciate any input.

*The original response to a cautious optimist and their naysaying coupled with the foundational reasoning:*

http://www.reddit.com/r/botany/comments/qdx0m/has_any_endeavor_gone_about_systematically/c3wx380

*The inquiry into the botanical world and its numerous dimensions that led to the recursive reaction:*

http://www.reddit.com/r/botany/comments/qdx0m/has_any_endeavor_gone_about_systematically/

---

The way forward:

* A founding of a non-Profit to coordinate, mediate, and execute a plan of action between various organizations, agencies, and entities across international and multi-disciplined boundaries in search of actionable execution for a botanical bonanza of scientific survey.

* An interim steering committee and membership of enthusiasts, hobbyists, scientists, botanists, et cetera that share the ideal of establishing a complete compendium of every naturally occurring molecule known to humankind.

* A digital presence consisting of a subreddit at /r/thebotanicalcompediumproject that would be a source of updates, coordination, discussion, and dialogue between concerned parties and the various stakeholders until more established channels of communication could be built up.  A website, social media pages, and everything more online so as to keep everyone up to date, informed, and digitally tuned in to the growing endeavor.  Let's start an encyclopedia with an open-source, malleable yet moderated, wiki-type user experience interface to expand upon the ideas of collecting, storing, and making everything accessible to everyone involved with the project.

* A vast array of well-refined writings, descriptions, mission statements, and such regarding the intended scope of the project and so on.

* A survey of current works to date.  A survey of the task before us all.  A survey of the necessary resources required to complete such a project in various timescales and scopes of workforces, synchronization, coordination, and applied efforts.

* An informal and formal survey of those interested coupled with a listing of everyone and their potentially available resources contrasted with the gains and losses for each entity and stakeholder involved including time, effort, resources both human, financial, equipment, and others, and the knowledge to be attained, digested, comprehended and how to go about doing so."	t5_2qrcz	True

Why don't poison oak or poison ivy have a easily recognizable warning to other organisms that contact with them is dangerous.  He compared them to cacti, which, of course, have very prominent visible warnings about the danger of contact. 

I don't know the answer, but hypothesized that it was because poison oak/ivy evolved in resource-rich ecosystems so inadvertent, minor contact was easily survivable, whereas, for cacti, any breaching of their stems can be fatal.  This was all pulled out of my ass, so if anyone (say, an actual botanist or something) knows or has a better idea, I'd love to pass it along. "	t5_2qrcz	True

I thought they needed water for reproduction... was it in my tap water? I tried a google search, but most of the pages I found had overly detailed information on alternation of generations and the differences between asexual and sexual reproduction. 	t5_2qrcz	True
1363469600.0	1afgvu	Any suggestions for Seed ID books?	blthree	10	0	4	"So I graduated in December with a degree in Horticulture/Agriculture and finally managed to land my first real job as a seed analyst at seed testing company. Part of my training includes working towards getting an RST certification (Registered seed technologist) and a huge part of this is being able to identify weed seeds that might be found in various seed lots.

I picked up a copy of [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0685390705/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), which I previously had borrowed from a friend. It's pretty good, but I would like to find something that's broader then just weed seeds. I have a decent amount of botanical knowledge and I'm not afraid of higher level resources. We have a 5000+ specie seed herbarium at work so drawings and photos are not a necessity.

Two years ago i bought a supermarket phothos on a whim, it was my first houseplant. fast forward another year and i would eventually take the stalks from the growing vine and allowed them to root in adjacent pots to make a daughter plant. This was done over the winter(2010) btw.

The next spring(2011) i noticed a new growth out of the daughter pot and having no idea what it was i just let it grow, it turned out to be a long stalky/viney bouquet of pretty pink flower that grew all summer, and with the help of a q-tip, begat seedpods which each contained dozens of small black seeds much like poppy seeds. I cut the long stalks back a few inches to the dirt when the flower fell off past winter(2011), and now i have new flower growth this spring. 

I also planted a few of the seeds and the sprouts from those seeds are shown in the last pic of the album.

I have had no luck identifying the new plant, i cant seem to find any pictures online of a flowering pothos, the new sprouts and the flowering part in my pot both have the same hairy texture that you can see in one picture has caught and killed a few gnats however the pothos next door has no hair and the stems look nothing alike.

Is it possible that the flowering stem is a reproductive part of the pothos or did i just happen to grow a seed that errantly flown its way into my window and into my pot of soil?

First, I have a plan to create a self sustaining aquarium (or something similar), however I'd like to have a broad understanding of underwater plants and their life cycles and needs before I even purchase an aquarium.

Second, I'd enjoy the idea of dabbling with ""dry""/above ground plants and, (pardoning this horrible example) creating things like ""tudaisies"" or other plant hybrids. Is this kind of thing possible in a home environment?

I'm in the great lakes region. It seems like this year has been tough on a lot of trees and plants in the neighborhood (although plenty more are doing just fine). 

We had a very cold, very snowy winter, a freakishly wet spring and then it snapped straight into a hot, dry summer. Not much rain at all after May, but we're still way above average for the year. Last time I remember checking we were at 30"" and the average year to date was 20"". What kind of effect might this have on a tree?

What about groundwater? I live near a river and a big lake and we had water in the basement for months this year. The base of the trunk looks a little funky, now that I look at it. Maybe the roots are all rotten?


Also, I half-assed a pH test with a fishtank kit. You can tell me why it's worthless but I did it anyway. We put down a little all-purpose fertilizer as well a few shovels of lime in the spring, though I didn't really think about it too hard. It sits under a large pine tree so I just figured it couldn't hurt. What kind of pH preferences does this mystery tree have?

I remember it being sickly and late-blooming in the spring, with sparse patches of regular growth. The leaves were mostly pale and papery with deep-green veins, and they kinda rolled up on themselves.  Now I would probably just describe it as ""mostly dead."" 

Anyway, I'm hoping the poor tree's death might serve as a learning experience for me. I feel like a jerk having watched it wither away, like I killed the last Truffula Tree. But there were also the now-deceased cherry, japanese maple and magnolia trees to attend to, and the warts on the grapes, and all the beetles and weeds and you know the drill.

On to the topic: in about a month I'll be off to a random rural commonland, to work there as the village doctor for a whole year, and I'd like to take some medicinal herbs with me to grow (and learn lots about them). But I'm at a loss, I know so little about them...

I was thinking on spearmint, datura, arnica/wolf'sbane, and the like.

The place is in the NE of Mexico, the climate of the area ranges from humid to very humid, at about 400mm yearly precipitation, and temperature averages 19°C (66°F) during summer, goes down below -10°C (14°F) in winter.

I know it's too much information to learn in about a month (there'll be no internet there), but I'd really appreciate any advice/information reddit can give me :)

By the way, I believe in primum non nocere, so don't think I'll be irresponsible, I consider this as a learning opportunity but will NEVER risk anyone's life."	t5_2qrcz	True

Additionally, I'm sorry if I am not following the rules. I hope you'll allow me to ask this question. 

So, I am creating a fictional world. I needed something in this specific part of the world that created an ""off"" season in the spring/summer months that *made people lazier*. It would be a prominent part of their culture; an effect of nature. 

I thought of pollen and honeysuckle. But fictional versions of each. A pollen that dusts everything with its yellow hue, but has the added effect of giving everyone alcoholic-symptoms (or something close to marijuana). Or, perhaps a cup-shaped flower that stores water in its petals while releasing certain chemicals...it could be a carnivorous plant that uses the alcohol to poison it small, mammal victims? 

I don't know. Point is, I need your help. Usually, when I create these things, I look toward things on earth that already have these qualities or something similar. But this is my first attempt at plant-life, in truth. 

Is there anything remotely similar to what I'm describing? If not, is there anything *you* could dream up to point me in the right direction? It doesn't have to be firmly scientific. It just needs to give the illusion that it is...

I was hoping an Aloe Vera expert could help me out with a problem I'm having with my Aloe Vera plant. I will explain the problem first, and the background later.

What was once a prolific, huge Aloe Vera plant is now two or three tiny plants, which are struggling to grow roots and occasionally turning brown/losing plumpness in leaves. I'm tempted to pull them out and keep them in water until they regain health, but I've re-potted them and moved them around several times, I almost feel like I should just leave them be and pay close attention to them. Please help!!

Background:
My mom had three huge pots of Aloe Vera. When her home was foreclosed, I got all of her plants, including the Aloe Vera. The Aloe Vera was so abundant and intense that I divided most of it and sold it on Craigslist or gave it away to friends as gifts. 
Flash forward two years, and I admittedly abused my remaining Aloe Vera. I didn't pay as much attention to the plant as I should of. Before I knew it, most of the Aloe had died, and the remainder didn't have roots. 
I've re-potted it several times, allowed it to dry between watering and even tried talking to it to help it regain health.
It's been about a month since I've began giving this plant a concerted effort, and it doesn't seem to be bouncing back.
I'm just freaked out because it was such a prolific plant, and my mom has a deep emotional connection to the plant, as do I. 


I know this species roots in water. Would I be better off keeping it in a small glass of water until it bounces back? Or should I just keep a close eye on it and hope that it will regain strength.
This strain of Aloe is intense, usually creating numerous babies, growing large and quickly.
I know what I did wrong was ignoring the plant, and incorrectly potting it, but I have been giving it so much love and it's not bouncing back.
Help!!! PLEASE!!


I'm new to reddit, but if I can figure it out, I will post a pic of the plant shortly after posting this.

1325555019.0	o0id1	which microscope	redaniel	10	2	2	"im a total microscope virgin and i  need a microscope to observe plant leaves, and some structures. especifically im interested to see how different chemicals change its epidermis (i need to see the stoma and trichomes as well), and hopefully be able to see whats up with the mesophyll (how does one slice a uniform section of a leaf - an exacto knife will do ?).

strangely im also an amateur astronomer so i understand the variables involved in picking a good telescope (aperture is what you look for and not the advertised magnification, and with the former you have an idea of how much you will be able to magnify without loss of resolution- 30 to 50x of mag per inch of aperture is the usual rule of thumb) but im a complete dumbass for microscopes. i dont know what to look for, what brands are great without being premium(there are excellent brands like celestron that deliver it, but there are premium brands that are totally unecessary unless you are rich purist semiprofessional, like takahachi or questar or Ap - i guess, for binoculars it is the difference between a nikon or canon and a zeiss or swarovski) and whether the light source of the microscope should be above or below my slides (and if there is a microscope with both - given that i want to see stuff reflected from the leaf and not thru it at times). id also like to understand whether it is worth getting something that attaches to a laptop than going for pure optics, and how much magnification i need (i think i want to see 1 micra). sorry for the inordinate amount of questions but i need some basic literature and some reviewer of those things.

any help appreciated, grazie."	t5_2qrcz	True

My situation is as follows.

My fiancee' is joining the United States Air Force within the next few months and I will be accompanying her. We are unsure of where we will be stationed but we are shooting for out of country, hoping for England. She will have a four year obligation to the AF, so I am looking to go to school in that time period. I was hoping to ask you some questions about schooling, jobs, and research for the field of Botany. Since we are unsure of where we will be landing, and for matters of preference as well, I'd like to take online classes, does that sound plausible? My end goal is Enthobotany, so any information in that regard is appreciated as well.

Schooling

*1. What options do I have for where I can go to school for Botany?

*2. Do they have online classes? Is the difficulty higher than attending an actual class?

*3. What is required for a degree in Botany? Ethnobotany if you know?

*4. How long does it generally take to acquire these degrees?

*5. How much does it generally cost for the schooling?


Jobs

*1. What jobs are available in the field? What are they like?

*2. Where are these jobs located specifically? What kind of work 
environment?

*3. What are the salaries like?

*4. What are the best and worst things about working in the field?


Research

*1. What are some ways I could get started now?

*2. Where are the major research facilities and what do they research specifically?

*3. What kind of research has already been done?

*4. What kind of research is going on currently?


I appreciate any answers and all help. Thank you very much in advance."	t5_2qrcz	True

ThomasKnight	11	3	8	"I have started a blog to try to get the word out about really good conservation organizations- a very few big guys get all the press and a lot of really amazing organizations are totally overshadowed.  If you're not in the field it can be hard to know which ones are good and which ones are largely ineffectual.  I've been involved in the animal side of conservation and know those organizations well, but while they usually work to save the entire habitat, plants are usually not their primary focus.  So I was interested to get your input on which organizations do the best work with endangered plants.  I'm looking for people with experience with projects that the organization has been involved with and seen their tangible results first-hand, not people who have just seen their PR materials and thought that made them look good- any kid with Photoshop can make a slick website &amp; PR campaign and the groups that look terrible on the internet are often doing astounding work.  I want to know who is actually changing the world in an amazing, positive way.  They also don't need to be large organizations or global (or even national) in scope.  My lack of familiarity with the plant conservation community is a weakness that I would like to fix for myself, and ideally publicize for the rest of the world as well.

If you have any suggestions, either post them here or send them to me if you prefer, ideally with a summary of what they do that you think makes them awesome.  And for full disclosure, I am cross-posting this to r/environment and r/conservation as well, but I am not doing this to karma whore.  I don't care about karma (well, not Reddit's kind anyhow) and formed this throwaway account just for this question to prove it.  All I want is to help the plants- won't you help the plants?  I'm just looking to promote conservation organizations that are helping to make a difference.

EDIT: So it was pointed out I should have added my blog address for interested parties: http://conservationheroes.blogspot.com/"	t5_2qrcz	True
1308935380.0	i87oz	How can I make my blueberries sweet?	AnnaLemma	9	2	10	"I planted a couple of blueberry bushes in my backyard a couple of months ago, but the berries are just bland. It's not that they're underripe - they're not really tart or tangy, just bland.

One of the bushes is a Toro, and I don't remember the other type (it's a similar size - small shrubs about 2' tall and 3' in branch spread diameter - but has smaller and more numerous berries)... Planted in NJ, if that helps. 

Is it just a matter of some varieties not being as sweet as others, or can I do something with the soil/fertilizer to make the berries tastier? Or could it be that the plant needs to mature a bit more to produce sweet berries? They way they are right now, they're not worth keeping for next year =(

I can eat some beans like green beans, peas, soy, etc. However I cannot eat red beans, white beans, pintos, lentils, etc. I have not done a lot of experimenting on what I can and can't eat because it is so painful and the pain lasts hours, depending on how much I eat.


Does someone with a knowledge of food proteins see a similarity in the things I can't eat? Beans are in everything (especially international foods) and it makes it hard to know what foods I can try.

I'm a plant biology student (the only one in my university) and we are supposed to be designing our independant studies at the moment, unfortunatley my course hasn't really gained much focus on the plant side of things yet. My current idea is to test adhesive properties of pollen on certian textiles when subjected to various conditions (e.g. emulated weather conditions) for forensic reasons and the benefit of those with hayfever and athsma. however this idea doesn't really have me jumping for joy, i would much prefer an idea with a more botanical focus, my first idea for example was to somehow investigate the limits of seed dormancy, but apparently this is already a very well researched area.	t5_2qrcz	True

1350434188.0	11loa4	In a natural environment, how many viable seeds does it take to propagate a plant?	jason-samfield	11	5	7	"Having now harvested and collected wild and domestic seeds for a few seasons and successfully sprouted at least one of each of most of the species that I collected, I'm very curious on what the magnitude of the number of seeds produced (that are viable as well as not) that actually end up getting germinated, and then sprouted, and then survive to seedling, and eventually to make it to reproductive maturity and or species maturity in the wild.

---

For instance, an oak tree might produce numerous hoards of acorns.  On some sort of average account or metric, about how many acorns are viable for a particular season?

* About how many viable acorns land on the ground (as opposed to foraged or somehow disturbed prior to falling)?
* How many acorns eventually germinate?
* How many live to become a seedling?
* How many grow to a sapling?
* How many grow to reproductive maturity?
* And how many might reach species maturity?
* And how does this compare to other tree seeds/nuts and or other types of plants such as grasses, wildflowers, shrubs (wild and cultivated), and maybe even food crops?

---

I'm just looking for ballpark estimates of various species or types of plants such as a tree versus a grass versus a wildflower.  I don't need precise values, although if that sort of research is known, that would be great!

I know that the botanical world is extremely complex, but it seems rather interesting to me that the serendipity needed for a viable seed to ""plant itself"" and grow successfully to reproductive maturity is a slim margin of chance against the massive odds needed for survival.  It just seems to me that at almost every turn and corner, the odds are against a viable seed germinating properly and eventually growing into a mature plant.

---

Also, are there any downsides to helping mother nature along and sprouting the viable seeds (by collecting them and growing them in nursery fashion) and then planting them into the wild?  Will the sprouted plants be weaker because of the nursing?  Will the ecology be detrimentally affected by the artificial species populating?"	t5_2qrcz	True

Supposedly the leaves absorb the sugar, and this raises the Brix, which is cryoprotective through freezing-point depression. 

Can foliage really absorb significant amounts of sugar? What about better cryoprotectants like glycerol? If plants can absorb sugar this way, why can't you ""feed"" plants with sugar to help a struggling plant survive or increase yield of a troublesome variety of fruit or vegetable (obviously not sustainable)?

PS: I initially got turned on to this because of a super scammy product called [BioWash](http://www.fertilizerboosters.com/). They seem to use literally every bizarre pseudoscience buzz word in the books. As far as I can tell, the product is just vegetable (coconut, corn) derived surfactant and sugars from one of many sources (tree sap, sugarcane, grains, potatoes), and maybe some ethanol.

I am currently building a smartphone app based on 'The Secret Life of Plants' (the book or film, anyone?), a 1973 bestseller. Having read the book and watched the film myself, I was very interested in the experiments mentioned (Backster Effect, etc.). Research on the internet showed that many people have attempted to recreate the experiments by themselves. Products inspired by the book were invented, to help fans try out some experiments from the book themselves (eg. Floranium). 

I find the movement to be quite interesting, there are people worldwide tinkering with science, robotics and plants to discover their own truths from the book, which I think is wonderful. Unfortunately, all these information are scattered and difficult to find. A concept I want to produce is a digital platform for the international fanbase of the title to find encouragement (for those who have not) to carry out their own experiments, and a sharing platform for those who have. It will be a great follow-up after the book and the film for the fans and it will bring ourselves closer to the hands-on, intriguing experiments mentioned. The problem is that many of us don't know how to even start.

I will like to bring in both experts and amateurs, to build a community with shared interest, and bring up-to-date news of any new discoveries or inventions. For those who have done the experiments, you can share to the rest of the community journaling how you did it, tutorials, notes, your discoveries. It will be motivating and educational for others who are interested but lost. 

We can have a little fun with plants, science, and robotics. By ourselves or with family, children, or in school. Who knows what will come out of it? Using smartphone applications and website database, we can have beautiful experiment journals and discussions all based on The Secret Life of Plants. The phone app have multiple optional plug-ins installed (for galvanometric readings, weather, sound output, etc.) and these can be created by the community, for the community. The idea is for it to be procedurally-generated, and users are free to install plug-ins depending on their own level of participation. One clearer visual of how sophisticated the phone app could be is when we use an installed augmented reality plug-in, we can point our phone cameras at a certain plant in our house and see its temperature, moisture, galvanometric reading graph progress, as data layered above one plant. Move the camera to another plant, and the data changes accordingly. I want to allow technology to help us see things we cannot see within nature through our own eyes. 

Now, as this is still in progress, I would like to hear your say on this concept. Do you have any feedback and comments? I would definitely love to hear them and take them on board :)"	t5_2qrcz	True

My understanding is that humans are unable to digest cellulose, the strong outer component of the plant cell wall. This means that we cannot access the protein-rich organelles and nutrients floating in the cyoplasm, including the DNA and RNA components.

Some animals, like cows, store bacteria in their cecum that produce cellulase. This allows them to break down the cell wall and derive protein from plants like grass. In humans, the cecum (and associated appendix) remain rather useless except for giving us lovely bouts of appendicitis, adenocarcinomas and the lovely jelly-belly of psuedomyxoma peritonei.

Would it be possible for humans to supplement via an enteric-coated capsule cellulase (allowing it to bypass the stomach and perhaps in our diets, allowing us to derive more nutrients from dietary fiber and plant matter? Not saying this is necessary, but the mad scientists in me was thinking of the possibilities.

Maybe the problem is delivery of the enzyme to the distal intestine without breakdown by human proteases. Additionally, if the enzyme could not work well in the stomach or duodenum and perhaps proximal jejunum then there are no human proteases in the rest of the intestine to utilize the intracellular nutrients. Maybe the cellulase could be mixed with a slurry of plant matter, allowing it to digest before you drink a...disgusting?...grass smoothie.

Xaotik-NG	9	5	9	"Ok so, I'd like to preface this by saying this: I am in no way a gardener or botanist, the last time I grew plants, they were strawberries that I grew with my mother as a very young child, she thought it would be some activity that my brother and I could do together.

So recently, I've seen the idea of terrariums tossed around quite a bit, and, having dabbled in biology a bit during high school, now studying engineering, I see these little glass orbs as an amazingly simple and elegant solution for growing food in a controlled environment, being able to keep pesticides completely out of the equation.

So my question is, and mind you, I'm not actually capable of doing this, but it's just an idea, if I theoretically had a glass orb large enough, could I grow something completely out of its native region? Say like Bananas for example, in my home state of New York? Also, since the glass orb can theoretically be located in temperature-controlled conditions, could I, or anyone, also grow fruits completely out of season?

Like I said, this is just an idea out of the blue based on my newly sparked interest in terrariums, and I would like the opinions of some actual plant-life-enthusiasts. All comments and opinions are appreciated, thanks!"	t5_2qrcz	True

My degree will be in ""Environmental Studies"", but my focus has been botany. Everything I've come up with so far has been shot down by me or the faculty. 

My first idea was to develop some baseline data for an estuary in Mexico. I was going to determine the net ariel primary productivity of a mangrove forest there. This project would be fine, but the data doesn't seem useful if it isn't over an entire year. 

Another idea I had was to figure out the diversity of foliar fungal endophytes in the same plant community (I really like this estuary). The problem here is that I don't have any mycology classes under my belt and the school lacks the necessary equipment. I know I could fund and make all of the necessary equipment, but the faculty thinks otherwise. 

I'm mostly interested in diversity, which is why I liked the fungal endophytes idea so much.

I have been told that the senior project should be a culmination of what I've learned here during my undergrad. This got me thinking about what I've actually learned and I can't say that I've learned all that much.

Last week I read that they should be under-potted to show their trunks so as a quick fix I took about 3 inches of dirt off the top and, low and behold, there was a trunk! The problem is there seems to be a lot of roots stemming from the trunk which makes me feel like I should put the dirt back... 

What do? What is going to happen when I buy and new, smaller pot? And finally any other advice you can offer me on how to aid this little guy in becoming the best ponytail palm he can be would be awesome!

**Hybridization as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness in plants?**

*Norman C. Ellstrand and Kristina A. Schierenbeck*

**Abstract**

Invasive species are of great interest to evolutionary biologists and
ecologists because they represent historical examples of dramatic
evolutionary and ecological change. Likewise, they are increasingly
important economically and environmentally as pests. Obtaining
generalizations about the tiny fraction of immigrant taxa that
become successful invaders has been frustrated by two enigmatic
phenomena. Many of those species that become successful only do
so (i) after an unusually long lag time after initial arrival, andyor (ii)
after multiple introductions. We propose an evolutionary mechanism
that may account for these observations. Hybridization between
species or between disparate source populations may serve
as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness. We present and
review a remarkable number of cases in which hybridization
preceded the emergence of successful invasive populations. Progeny
with a history of hybridization may enjoy one or more
potential genetic benefits relative to their progenitors. The observed
lag times and multiple introductions that seem a prerequisite
for certain species to evolve invasiveness may be a correlate of
the time necessary for previously isolated populations to come into
contact and for hybridization to occur. Our examples demonstrate
that invasiveness can evolve. Our model does not represent the
only evolutionary pathway to invasiveness, but is clearly an underappreciated
mechanism worthy of more consideration in explaining
the evolution of invasiveness in plants.

1330634628.0	qdemo	When do roots grow the deepest?	jason-samfield	8	2	10	"Essentially, what is an average rule-of-thumb function that would apply for the rate of root growth (or more specifically deeper root growth versus breadth) in both various seasonal and meteorological conditions?

* Do roots grow the deepest when in search of water shortly after heavy rains?

* Do roots grow the deepest and or most during times of wet, moist conditions favorable to growth in general?

* What conditions would be applicable to growing the deepest roots to the most amount of plants?

* Are long periods of minimal precipitation prefaced and followed by short periods of heavy rainfall better for deeper root growth?

* Or are medium periods of minimal precipitation prefaced and followed by medium periods of moderate rainfall better for deeper root growth?

What are the most limiting factors to root growth?  Soil type?  Rainfall intervals?  Average temperatures and or the diurnal oscillations of temperature?  Sustained humidity and high dew point intervals?

Does a sequence of simultaneous decreases in humidity, dew point, and temperature along with increases in RMS wind, wind gusts, pressure, and sunshine favor root growth at all?  Essentially, does the drying out of the surface  during a high pressure influx push a plant's metabolism into overdrive at all?"	t5_2qrcz	True

1376778462.0	1kkne2	Could you help me make my fiddle leaf fig feel better?	ObliterateMe	2	0	1	"Hey r/botany! I recently moved into a new apartment with a great southern facing window. I just had to get a big, pretty plant! I chose the fiddle leaf fig as the newest addition. I've had pretty easy keepers before this guy. The moment I bring him home, I repot him in a very large pot (which I hear could be very problematic?) and set him in a shady spot out on our patio. During the morning he gets very bright, direct light, then, due to the shape of the building, gets shade from about 1:00 pm onward. 

I'm sure the plant has been stressed out. I've read that moving around can cause problems. Considering he spent a two hour car drive to get here, maybe he just isn't feeling tip top. Anyway, here's the pictures of his leaves:

http://imgur.com/a/lX4Co

I easily pulled off three leaves which were mostly yellow and covered in brown spots like the ones on these leaves. These leaves are located at the bottom of the plant. I've read that it can be overwatering. I will admit I may have given it too much water the first time I watered it. Plus I gave it some miracle gro fertilizer. I just watered it for the second time yesterday, so about nine days after the first watering. I gave it significantly less and only watered it around the surrounding soil. I only watered it because I noticed the top leaves beginning to dry up. "	t5_2qrcz	True
