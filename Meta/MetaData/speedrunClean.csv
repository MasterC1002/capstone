**Please note that this is how I do things**

----------------------

**1) Pick A Game You Love** 

You need to pick a game you absolutely love to play and genuinely will not mind starting over and over and over again, even if that means watching the 10 minute intro again, killing that RNG ridden boss or if you don't get that low chance steal/drop.

**2) Do Your Research** 

Find the WR run of the game you choose, the forum posts regarding the tricks, glitches or routes, statistics for various things (heavily dependent on the game) and set some time aside during the week to study these. This will probably be the most annoying thing to do out of everything because you need to take notes, mentally or on paper/computer, so you can understand mechanically how things function within the game and WHY these tricks work. 

**3)  Getting Your Baseline** 

Do a casual run, abuse save states if needed, just want to get a run you're ok with having as a starting point right now. Now load the WR video and time it the same way you timed your run. Do note that if the WR skips something that you didn't in your casual run, just delete the split from your timings so that your splits and the WR splits are the same reference points. This is very adjustable and heavily dependent upon the game in regards to how you time it, it would be impossible for me to suggest how to do so. After all this is done, you now have a baseline to work off of for later AND know where you stand compared to the WR. 

**4) Learning Time**

Break all the tricks, glitches, tactics, menu operations, whatever it is in this game you need to learn up into categories that are either easy, medium or hard difficulty. How you practice these is entirely up to you, but personally I go for the hard stuff first since it usually encompasses the easy/medium stuff in most games. Our goal here is to build up muscle memory for ALL things in ALL categories as best as possible. Do not worry or think about full runs right now, you want to solely focus on learning what, why, and how things work that make these exploits possible and in the time it takes you to do so, you'll be doing them more fluidly and the execution you have for them will improve massively over time. Repeating this for everything you've set into the categories mentioned earlier until you're capable of holding a conversation with someone while performing the actions basically out of almost pure muscle memory. There will be tricks this isn't possible for just due to how they work but it's assumed anyone serious about a game will know this.

**5) The Other Side of Learning**

Now break the run up into sections, however you please. Our goal here is to do the same as above and build up some muscle memory, except now we're doing full sections that combine multiple tricks together throughout pieces of a full run. Building up a general knowledge of visual cues, music references and other ""tells"" the game can provide here is what you should strive for as well as consistency. Again, we want to be able to do all of this while being distracted, so that should be your goal as it was before, having a friend try to distract you with conversation is a great way to push this muscle memory building.

**6) It Starts**

Go back and do a full run and completely destroy your casual run times. The difference now is that we've got all that muscle memory, timings and knowledge from the learning phase and are feeling really good about our times throughout the run. Once you get a solid run you're content with, compare again to the WR times and note where you're losing time/gaining time at. Now take that information and practice those areas a bit then do another run. NEVER spend too much time practicing, you will lose the muscle memory you've built up for other sections of the game.

**7) The Reset Trap and Why You Avoid It**

Eventually you'll begin doing races, working towards developing WR attempts, etc... The one thing you should continuously avoid is falling into what I refer to as the ""Reset Trap."" What I mean by this is that people will begin resetting because they lose a minimal amount of time on a split and assume that because of this, the run is totally impossible to recover. This is false, many of the more famous runners have 1 or 2 pretty bad splits in their WR runs (by their standards). When you fall into this kind of logic of resetting for even the most minor thing, you WILL burn yourself out extremely quickly even if you love the game. The only time you should start resetting constantly is if something you do completely removes any chance of the run being salvageable later. For instance, if I can save 14 seconds throughout my entire run and a split i get is in the red by 6, I'm going to keep going. If that red dips past 14 seconds, then I'll reset right away because it is impossible to recover any further time loss in regards to the improving my time overall. **AdamSDA** ""There's also the issue of wanting a good, clean run as a new PB/WR to the best of one's ability rather than something with one or more big mistakes."" 

**8) Community Help**

Never let someone with a better time get to you. If someone beats your time, go ask them what they did differently, watch the video of it and learn the differences yourself, go practice their methods and generally don't ever view it as ""I've been defeated and can't beat the new time!"" The community for speed running is honestly one of the most helpful and respectful communities I've ever been a part of. You should never be afraid to ask for help, tips or anything regarding speed running at all, people here usually will go out of their way to help you.

**9) TAS Strats**

Once you're on par with WR runs and pretty confident in your abilities, look up the TAS of a game and see what it does. Now see if there's any way you can include those tactics in some way to improve your time. This is your ultimate goal as a player is to get as close as you can to what people do with frame by frame input. Even pulling off one of these TAS strats can save huge amounts of time compared to other people who aren't as practiced. It also puts you in the mindset of saving frames, not seconds, which boosts the standards at which you hold your runs thus overall making your confidence and comfort with the game even higher after some time.

**BorisAcornKing:**

""Always record every single serious attempt. If you pull a rabbit out of a hat and get the record, you want that on video. If you need to practice an area, it helps to have that on video. if something hilarious happened, you want that on video.

-A guy who would be holding the Spelunky WR if he had only bothered to record a casual run.""

Questions asked frequently/answered on this subreddit:

**What is a Split?**

Splits are the times you keep track of while playing through a game. They enable you to see how far ahead/behind you are compared to a previous run of the game at a specific spot. Most runners have splits on the screen when they stream. The most common program for splits is WSplit, which can be found on this subreddit's sidebar.

**Whats is a single segment and a multi-segmented run? And whats the difference?**

shnizalwizal: ""A single segment is a one sitting run, you play the game from start to finish. Multi-segment is when you but piece of gameplay together. Single segment is far more popular.""

**About RNG, Random Number Generation, what about it? How it works?**

[gnuvince's RNG description](http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1fzhoo/a_couple_of_questions/caflp2k)

About random numbers, without going too much into details (and I assure you, there are a lot of details to go into), computers do not have random number generators, they have pseudo random number generators. What does that mean? It means that a sequence of numbers generated by a PRNG ""looks"" random, but is actually the output of a deterministic process.

These PRNGs work by selecting an initial value (called the seed; usual candidates are the current time, or some information on the system) and keep feeding that value into the PRNG function. For example, here's such a function:

next curr = (curr * 214013 + 2531011) `mod` 2^15

And here are the numbers it generates for different seeds (0 and 1):

ghci&gt; take 20 $ iterate next 0
[0,7875,3706,23381,8388,19575,21854,5801,16072,619,898,7229,32268,21663,23782,8209,17040,5907,25994,5669]
ghci&gt; take 20 $ iterate next 1
[1,25280,30339,1850,28949,24452,4151,2590,30825,6536,29227,13378,2557,13516,12383,18854,22993,5456,7891,20042]  

If you know the generation algorithm, and you know the current value of the seed, you can know what the next ""random"" values are going to be.

Hope this all helps somebody out there.

1358385369.0	16pzxo	AGDQ is officially over. Just some closing thoughts I had on the event and speed running.	WastedPanda	79	7	55	"I hope this is in the right place. I couldn't really think of anywhere else to put it as it's about a speedrunning event. If this violates the rules please delete it, and know that I apologize for wasting your time.

Another AGDQ has come to a close, and as I sit here with it still fresh in my mind all I can think is: "" Wow. "" These men and women took 10 days out of their busy schedules of work, school, and just general life to sit in a center far away from many of their homes to marathon their respective games, back to back, as fast as they could for the enjoyment of all the viewers for a noble cause of a charity donation drive. While providing interesting trivia or detailed explanation of the way the glitches they utilize in their runs, they show their passing for gaming, speedrunning, a community that they all rally around, and a common goal of wanting to eliminate cancer.

As always, there were personalities there well known in the speedrunning community, and then those who were unknown until their slot in the schedule. Speedrunners like Cosmowright, Carl Sagan, and Trihex wowed the viewers with masterful runs, filled with interesting explanations of the different tricks, glitches, and bugs while also explaining why they work the way they do, and sometimes even detailing us a bit of history for the glitches when they could.

For the more unknown runners; two specific people stuck out to me personally, one of which will be no surprise and the other who I only seen run at the very end of the bonus stream.

1. The first runner which stood out to me was BlueGlass. Now now, hold your horses, this isn't going to be an "" ALL PRAISE YSG!! "" comment. What stuck out to me about BlueGlass was how many of the runs he caught. Nearly every time I looked in the room on camera, he was sitting there or I could hear him talking and knew he was in the room watching off camera. Constantly asking questions, laughing, or even just viewing the runs whenever possible. Legitimately interested in speedrunning with all the different games and their respective glitches. Fascinated about the history or explanations of why the glitches work the way they do. Having what seemed to be the time of his life as he just sat there hanging out with some of the people of the speedrunning community and watching them work their magic. Of course, we also can't forget the way he powered through the Ecco games, same smile on his face and still laughing, even in a game that I know for a fact had been quite possibly one the most difficult game many of us have played. BlueGlass stated he'll start streaming after he's situated back at home, and I hope he does. He was a blast to watch, and it's no secret that the chat fell in love with him for his slightly awkward, yet truly enthusiastic behavior.

2. The second runner which stood out to me was one that I hadn't seen play any other game during the marathon, and the one he did play only right at the very end of the bonus stream. I'm talking now about Spineshark. Now, maybe I missed him playing another game during the main marathon during one of my short 1 to 2 1/2 hour sleep cycles, but the only game I seen him play was "" El Viento. "" What stood out to me about Spineshark was his first impression when he sat down to play. A large smile on his face, and only saying at first "" I'm not very good at this game, but I really like playing it. "" I knew I'd enjoy the run just because of how enthusiastic he was just to play the short, twenty minute run of the game. He spent the entire time playing talking about the levels, bosses, things to remember when running it, useful little tricks. All the basic stuff that you would expect from a runner, but *he did it all while having a huge smile on his face and having fun just playing a simple game.* It didn't matter if he was the best ever or not, just because the amount of fun he was having was contagious. The chat had exploded with "" SMILEshark! "" comments, and people really had a blast watching him play, seemingly just because of how much fun he was having while playing.

Though I only mentioned two specific runners right there, that's because those two stuck out the most to me. This is not to say that none of the other runners were good, and is in fact, quite the opposite of what I think. I had a blast watching every run I could, even runs that didn't even seem that interesting to me at first like Skryim or Final Fantasy IX. ( Of course, I changed my mind on those two. Skyrim was pretty interesting to watch, and I had a blast with the FF9 watching because Spike and Puwexil were pretty interesting in their actions and how they explained everything )

One note I must address is the some negative points I noticed. A lot of people I seen on different forums and in chat were complaints about how chat was being run. "" IRC is filled with dictator mods, and twitch chat is always either shut off or you get banned instantly for no reason by the bots "" and other comments like that seemed to circle around this event. Sure Twitch chat was shut off quite a bit, which kind of took away from the experience and went a bit anti-hype. However, it's the lesser of two evils. Sure, it's an example of many being punished for the acts of a few, but to those complaining, where you keeping a good eye on chat? Sure, during bigger like Cosmo or Siglemic you had their typical watchers going about with their typical trolling, but relatively mild jokes. Of course Trihex's HEXMEN were out in full force during his JSR-HD run, but much like Cosmo and Sig's viewers, were mild and fun trolling at most. Some people showed that they could not be trusted during other runner's games though. When Emptyeye and Mrs. Emptyeye were up, I was surprised at all the hateful and disgusting things being said. When Withhelde was on screen, sure there was the typical "" Swagger Poppins "" jokes, but many hurtful and disrespectful things were being said then as well. To summarize the chat all I can say is this:

1. Yes, there was heavy moderation, but with a constant 20k - 30k+ viewers you have to be able to reign in the kind of explosions that can happen in chat.

2. Many of the times the chat was shut off, it wasn't the fault of the mods, but the fault of some people in chat being incredibly disrespectful to either the runners, others in the room, or even hatred directed at the mods for keeping them in line.

3. Many people think it's fine to spam or chat like they typically do in their normal speedrun chats. This is not always the case. Keep in mind that this was a charity marathon. You have people here that aren't normally used to the speedrunning chats. You have people from the charity that they're streaming for, and possibly many others. Sure, it's about having fun, but they still need to retain some professionalism. Where as your trolling with twitch faces is normally met with a couple laughs when you say that the BrainSlug face is "" BigNig "" you have to remember that they can't have comments like that in chat because they don't need accusations of racism or disrespect towards any race/color/creed against them because it could hurt the charity that they're representing. Also, don't expect all the people who may not typically watch speedrunning streams to fully understand the FrankerZ Kappa RESET spam.

4. When you're being deliberately disrespectful and asking questions like "" Hey, what's that transsexual in the back named lololol "" or "" OMG, get that land whale off the couch or she'll break it "" don't be surprised when you get banned and chalk it up to the nods being Nazis. Show some respect to the runners and people holding this event and don't be such an asshole to the people dedicating their time to a good cause and losing out on sleep.

I enjoyed this years AGDQ. I'm really looking forward to SGDQ, and of course next years AGDQ as well. It's always a great event to watch where you can learn a lot about speedrunning while having fun watching some really cool people. I think it went off great, especially while raising an amazing $427k for the PCF, and am wondering how they'll top it next year. All in all, major props to EVERYONE who helped make it possible through planning, donating, playing, or even the tech set-up. Can't wait to see the stream next year .

In closing, there is one last thing I'd like to address regarding the chat when it comes to speedrunning. I really wish something could be done about it, but I doubt that will ever happen. As a speedrunner myself ( who rarely streams my practice or attempts for PBs now ) I've noticed some pretty negative things about chat. Obviously, I'm not great. That's why my titles have NEVER been "" WR attempts. "" However, you have people that view Sig, Trihex, Cosmo, or other big runners like that, who then go around and view other people's channels as well. I can't tell you the amount of times I've had people come into my chat and watched me play for a minute or two before telling me that I suck and to just give up... Now, I don't personally care what they think, and I'll usually just laugh and agree with them. I only play SM64 because I think it's fun to keep myself on my toes and practice a few different games while looking for the next game to take seriously speedrunning. However, think of these people going into someone who's just getting into speedrunning. Someone who may not have as tough as skin. There are people out there who are easily discouraged, and going in and telling them to give up and that they suck could actually make them give it up. I'd rather be part of a group of hobbyists that are far more inclusive in the community rather than a group of elitist trolls that think the only people who should stream are the Sig and Cosmo's of their games. It's kind of infuriating and sad seeing how many promising runners I had followed that closed their accounts and quit speedrunning just because of trolls not understanding that everyone has to start somewhere.

Remember, the community isn't just the people playing the games, it's judged on it's viewers as well. It's fun to spam FrankerZ every now and then while joking with the streamer, but being outright disrespectful whether it's in a personal channel chat, or during a marathon isn't right. It brings a negative view of speedrunning all over the community. Support all the runners whenever possible, and if you have any problems then keep them to yourself or take them up directly with the person they're directed at privately and not make a large amount of drama.

I just opened up the stream when he started talking to him on Skype and I'm not sure what to think of him. He did sound like a nice guy, but I can't help to feel like a donation this big must be some sort of troll.

What do you guys think?

Edit:

I guess this is Kryptic's twitch http://www.twitch.tv/krypticsader

Edit2: 

He donated some more and is now at $3810

Edit3:

I just noticed it says ""Krypticsader $5310"" at the top of the stream now. Insanity.

Edit4: 

$5385

Edit7:

**The full story** 

This is from the second skype call and is all we know at the moment.

His name is apparently Tyler(?)(Just tell me if I should not out his name or anything, but Cosmo said it several times on stream)

Tyler is 21 years old and works as a fire fighter. He ended up in the hospital and watched Cosmos stream while staying there. He recently got paid and decided to donate.

Edit14:

https://twitter.com/cosmowright/status/365237674740686849

""$10,000 update
 
Kryptic said if the money wasn't through by Wednesday it's taking too long and I should call PayPal.
 
I called PayPal and eventually found out the money was cancelled before it ever reached PayPal (by either Kryptic or his bank).
 
I asked Kryptic about this and he says he didn't cancel, so he called his bank. He then said the bank told him that PayPal declined it, and that the money would be returned into his bank account tomorrow.
 
Kryptic says after the money is returned tomorrow, he will re-donate the $10000 in full via debit card."""	t5_2sf9e	True

1374351836.0	1ipntd	SGDQ is nearly upon us, just some thoughts of mine.	WastedPanda	60	6	36	"( Really quick, if this is in the wrong place or anything about it is against rules, please do whatever is necessary. I understand and apologize for wasting anyone's time. :) )

So, as we all know, SGDQ (Summer Games Done Quick ) is soon to begin. I just wanted to do a short write up to some things that where on my mind that I think we should remember.
	
Now, back when AGDQ had just ended, I [wrote up a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/16pzxo/agdq_is_officially_over_just_some_closing/) about some things I enjoyed about it, but also some issues that I seen, and I wanted to point some of those issues out in hopes that we could remember to try and avoid them to the best of our ability. This mainly focuses on the kind of chat that was going on during AGDQ, and the negativity/disrespect that was going through it at times.
	
1. Everyone involved are people just like us, so try to remember to be respectful. They're giving up their time, sleep, and money to travel and play these games. Sure, they're "" just playing games "" but at the same time they've put a lot of time and effort into making sure that each individual run is as best as they can make it for our enjoyment, which isn't easy by any means because it's easy to become forgetful of how difficult some games are when you regularly watch the best runners at the games play. Being disrespectful or rude to them is just a huge slap in the face for what they're giving up to bring this event to us. This doesn't just apply to those running games either. It also includes those who helped organize the event, and those who are there to help out and make things easier for this marathon to go off without a hitch. 
	
2. There are cases of drama happening every now and then, much like some issues at AGDQ that people wouldn't drop that started ruining the vibe. Try to avoid posting about drama if it occurs so that it fades away into obscurity faster. By making comments about any issues that may arise, you just make it more well known and more pronounced, and in turn help make the problem bigger. Let's try to avoid that because it it can turn others against one another and hurt them.
	
3. This event is for a great cause. Remember that it will probably be featured in many places, with people outside of the speedrunning community coming to watch. Keep this in mind as you chat. I know FrankerZ, Kappa, and the occasional ASCII art spam is common among speedrunning chat, as is a bit of trolling, but remember that not everyone there may be a regular follower of speedruns, or even a regular stream watcher. Our chat will reflect not only upon each individual runner playing at the time/the SRL and SDA communities/and the speedrunning community at large, but it could ALSO reflect upon Doctor's Without Borders because that's what the event is raising money for.
	
4. Respect the mods in the chat. There's most likely going to be 1-4k people watching at all time, obviously higher during peaktimes/big runs. Chat is bound to get crazy at times. Understand that there's probably going to be a about 500 - 100 to each individual mod in chat at some times, so they MAY need to turn it off if things get out of hand. That's not their fault, they're simply overwhelmed and cannot keep up with moderation needs. Remember that if people behave themselves, the chat can stay up more and mods don't need to stress out over what's acceptable and what's not. Once again, they're people too who are giving up their time, and at some points sleep, to help this event.

5. **Racism, homophobia, bigotry, sexism and all other hateful comments have no place at this event. Check that crap at the door because no one wants to see it. For those who do see those comments in chats, remember that if enough people are positive in chat, that we can drown out that hate. Always seek to be actively positive to try and help this event go even more smoothly. Chat can be a major hype train that sets the mood for people's runs and that's good, however it doesn't take much for people to ruin it for others. Keep in mind that these men and women do not need to do this, and if it gets progressively worse each year, you never know whether or not they'll just give up on it as something that could have been had it not been for the negativity. Let's keep it clean, fun, and positive to show them that this is something we'd like to see continue for a long time.**
	
I know that the /r/speedrun community is normally well behaved in chats ( ...right guys? ..guys? ) but not everyone is. If any runners see this, it would be a safe bet to talk to your stream chat about behavior, or if you have friends that are going to tune in, to talk to them about it. I'm sure this won't help the issue at large with chats going nuts, but at least it's an attempt to remind people to remember to read the rules for the chats and be respectful to everyone involved.
	
With that being said, SGDQ looks great so far with their schedule, and there are plenty of excellent runs by great people planned for our enjoyment. I look forward to it, as I'm sure many of us do. So let's try to do our best to help them out by not overloading them with moderation needs, or by being disrespectful. Support all the runners, and respect that they're coming together for a great cause.
	
Thanks for reading :)

1359313162.0	17dopz	Holy Drama Batman	IAmAN00bie	50	6	54	"On Saturday Nights, many speed runners compete in Ocarina of Time bingo, which is where runners must complete a set of 5 tasks in any order as fast as possible. RunnerGuy (a long-time OoT runner) decided to participate while being drunk. Many fun times were had watching DrunkerGuy fail glitches he normally would've gotten quite easily, but the actual bingo part isn't important at all. What happened after the run started it all.  

RunnerGuy is a big fan of FrankerZ, and in his drunkenness even more so. He held an afterparty where he sat and played the FrankerZ song over at tehurn.com/FrankerZ while he ""directed"" the ""FrankerZ train"" to various Twitch channels. Basically, the streamer where the FrankerZ train has landed would have massive ASCII art of FrankerZ spammed alongside the regular FrankerZ face, and the streamer who is being raided becomes the ""conductor"" who picks the next person for the raid. Runnerguy would direct the train to Twitch users, most of whom were SRL people and knew about it, in order to see their reactions. Eventually, the train was beginning to run out of SRL people to link to (RunnerGuy wanted to find people who *didn't* know about the FrankerZ train, in order to get a better ""LOL WTF"" reaction), so non-SRL people began being linked as well. Some of these users were from Team Ludendi, but others were unaffiliated with speed running at all. This is where the problem began.  

Twitch user Crumps2 was linked, and his chat flooded with FrankerZ e-motes and ASCII art. A Twitch admin by the name of Itaku happened to be watching Crumps2's stream, and had set-up an anti-spam bot to monitor Crumps2's chat. The bot, however, enacted an incredibly large number of bans so quickly (because the FrankerZ spam came so quickly and in large numbers) that it itself was IP banned for ironically ""spamming"" the chat. Subscriber mode was turned on in the chat, and Crumps2 and Itaku were both visibly angry. Itaku allegedly said that he was going to go through the chat logs and IP ban any user who participated in the spam raid (later clarified by another admin named George that only ASCII art spammers would be banned). Itaku and Crumps2 allegedly used a few slurs against the people from the FrankerZ train in their rage, and Crumps2 laughed at the raid by telling them it was only going to raise his viewer count to the point where he could apply for Twitch partner. The combination of the bans, alleged use of slurs, and Crumps2's condescending remarks angered the people from the FrankerZ train, and many took to RunnerGuy's (now empty, as he was offline) chat and IAteYourPie's (in the middle of a Paper Mario All Cards race, but otherwise previously unrelated to this drama) chat to speak about their anger.

Now it gets even crazier. A lot of mud was slinged around, screencaps of convos posted, and many SRL runners involved themselves in Pie's chat and on Twitter. Pie HIMSELF calls out Itaku on his stream, and tells people to report Itaku ON STREAM. The admin named George shows up and turns on subscriber mode on Pie's stream to have a direct conversation with him as well as the other SRL runners on Pie's chat. I'll try and sum up the arguments both sides made here:  

FrankerZ Train/Speed Runners:

1) IP banning was a disproportionate reaction to the FrankerZ train.  
2) FrankerZ train was friendly, and would leave within minutes.  
3) FrankerZ train exposes viewers to new streamers.  

Crumps2/Itaku:  

1) It was unnecessary spam, flooded the chat. The streamer never asked for it.  
2) Caused chat servers to slow down, likened the raid to a DDoS.  
3) Raiders broke the streamer's chat rules.  

Both sides kept to their own chats, and each felt they were in the right. The man who started it all - RunnerGuy - even showed up on his offline stream's chat (apparently sobered up) to find out what the hell just happened. Who would've thought an e-mote of a dog would have caused so much trouble?

A Twitch staff member by the name of Horror posted an official response [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchtv/comments/17cwb4/what_the_actual_fuck_twitchtv_frankerz_train/c84levg) and crumps' responded [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/140yg8g7x23d3QNJGlP8xkBNgPWiOt1X2-4NLVJtpTMU/preview?sle=true).

* **The DooDooDoo Crew during Super Mario Sunshine**: they were all great sports to really get involved, and surprisingly musical! SM Sunshine is such a fun game to watch, great atmosphere.
* **Catechumen hidden developer area with Peaches**: the devs who made this terrible, terrible game had a good sense of humor. And Peaches commentary really made it.

Familiarise yourself with the game. Familiarise yourself with streaming. Familarise yourself with how Speed Runs Live works. [This is the FAQ here](http://speedrunslive.com/faq/). 

The channel we will be meeting up in is:

Server: irc.speedrunslive.com  
Room: #/r/speedrun

There is no need to confirm your attendance. If you don't arrive within 15 minutes of the time, we *will* leave without you!

**Hints &amp; Tips** [](/WinWaker)

1. Keep in mind is that it takes time for your blaster bolts, once fired, to
strike your enemies. Far-away enemies take longer to hit - but if you want to
stay safe, these are the ones to hit! A few targeting tips:
1) For moving enemies, shoot where they're going to be, not where they are. 2)
If you're confident your bolts will strike, move on - get a head start on the
next enemy.
2. Don't be afraid to lob a few nova bombs to help clear stray enemies so that
you'll get a high score, especially on the easier stages. But think carefully
before you deploy your last one - you might need it to get out of a desperate
situation.  
4. Rolling is your friend - your rolls can deflect anything except collisions and missiles. It's a skill of central importance.  
5. Do play this game in stereo. Not only does it sound better, but you'll be
able to use the left-and-right channels as directional cues for the sounds of
engines, blaster bolts, and missiles headed your way.  
6. The easier and simplist route seems to be 'Level 1'  
7. [My first splits with a Game Over and two additional lives lost.](http://i.imgur.com/SNvyMqh.png) It would easily be under 25 minutes.

All participants are welcome. We are not racing to each other, we are racing to beat our PB. **RUN FOR FUN!**

**Updates** [](/HotPokket)

1. [These are the results from the Time Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H2DviF7ea4znE0cxGFNLzXKeFbROZSU5Ltg8IO_s_TM/viewanalytics). And [this is the result from time preferred](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0Apn2mdLhG_pidHVBRGxjeVAyQVhaTmI5el9HcGE1WGc&amp;oid=2&amp;zx=lix98ki3iqog). The data from these two have decided which day and time the race will be held. We might ask the same questions again in a month to see if the timing is still efficient.
2. The final score for the game suggestions is tied 10 each between [Star Fox any% (SNES) and Super Meat Boy any% (PC)!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apn2mdLhG_pidE5iNUdiYVN0VDNmblFNV2l4Wk96dnc#gid=0). This is actually preferred, and we will be play Star Fox on Saturday, and Super Meat Boy the following Saturday. Every gaming vote will thus dictate the game raced the week after. This is to allow a full week to practice instead of five or four days. This also allows participants to race every 2 weeks if needed, with a knowledge of the game selected. Star Fox was chosen for this week (five days practice) because it is a rail shooter which needs less practice than Super Meat Boy.
3. **[SUPER MEAT BOY IS ON SALE FOR £2.39 FOR A VERY LIMITED TIME. BUY NOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN NEXT WEEKS RACE.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/)**
4. Google Docs has been good for adding gaming suggestions, but does anybody know of a polling website that allows users to add options without potentially rigging the results? I've had to check over 200 revisions from the Spreadsheet in order to make sure no cheating occurred.

I know that for some serious speedrunners, it is a long time, but for me, it felt like I just blown my 6 year old me's mind. (wall of text incoming!)

After seeing the SGDQ 16 star race with siglemic, I thought to myself ""hey, most of those tricks don't seem too hard; maybe i'll try them someday!"" and today, I burrowed a friend's cartridge so I could finally try those awesome glitches myself. And I must say, clipping through the doors with MIPS looks easy, but man, I had the hardest time in my life! But the first time I could do it, I felt something I haven't felt in a long, long time.

Pure, unadultured joy. Like the type of joy I had as a 6 year old when I played Super Mario 64 for the first time. I felt like if I had unlocked something secret within the game that I haven't ever seen or done.

After clearing the second Bowser battle, I tried my first reverse long jump to pass the 50 star door and OH BOY I felt even more happy when I could finally do it (and for some reason, I started laughing a LOT, probably from watching poor mario blast thru the door super fast and backwards xD). Did the same thing with the 70 star door, but I did it wrong the first time and warped to wet-dry world :(. There goes like 5 minutes! 

Finally I'm at the final level. Didn't do any YOLO strats to reach the pipe since I didn't want to risk ruinning my time (as if I had some sort fo WR to beat or something xD). I reach bowser, get killed once, then killed him the second time. Final time was about 42:40.

It took me MONTHS to beat this game 16 years ago, and now, it took me less than an hour. When I think of it that way, it BLOWS MY MIND so much. It's been a long time since I had this much fun with a game, and I enjoyed every single second :D.

tl;dr: First speedrun in my life, I poop my pants in joy and awe when I managed to do some of the crazy glitches in this game and beat it in less than an hour.

If you didn't know, the Pokemon speedrunner [Werster](http://twitch.tv/werster) made [polls on Strawpoll](http://pastebin.com/XZReh8ck) for every game in the marathon. Each poll had users rank the game on a scale from 1 to 5, and also indicate whether they had never seen the game before, seen the game before but not seen a speedrun, or seen a speedrun before.

I wrote a script to pull the data out of all these polls automatically. Then  I found the average score for each game and ranked them. I posted a Google Doc with all the data [here](http://bombch.us/H0r).

The idea was for the people who run the SDA marathons to see this data and use it to make better schedules in the future. Somehow I get the feeling they won't really care though.

1364761110.0	1bdjch	So this YouTuber, AstralsGamer, has stolen Exo's old Super Meat Boy WR	lillesvin	39	8	17	"I hate to give him views, but [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK45djg3FpQ). And while he's not directly claiming it's his run, he certainly didn't correct people when they congratulated him on his great run. And when asked if it was SS or TAS (yeah, I know, it doesn't make much sense), he happily answered that it was single segment (though he never explicitly said that *he* was the one doing it as a single segment).

When I called him out on it he said ""I never claimed it was my run"" (but he was certainly leading people on e.g. by answering questions about the run in the comments) and then he deleted a lot of comments and blocked me from commenting. Classy.

I've contacted Exo on Twitter. I don't know if he ever checks that, but it's the only means of contacting him I've found.

Is this a common thing? I mean, that people steal runs and claim them as their own? Doing runs of Super Meat Boy myself I know how much time and effort Exo has put into this run, so seeing this douchebag ripping it (even if it is an outdated WR) pisses me off to no end.

Edit: Exo's run is here: http://dl.speeddemosarchive.com/demo.pl?SuperMeatBoy_PC_1924 if you want to verify for yourself that they are indeed identical.

**Update:** At least he has updated the video title to acknowledge that it is Exo's run. He's also deleted comments to make it look like it's always been that way (e.g. by deleting my comment calling him out on it not being his run).

**Update 2:** He disabled comments on that video... I guess he doesn't like being called out on stealing content. I really, really hope that Exo sees my tweet and gives him hell. (If anyone here knows him or talks to him, feel free to tell him.)

**Update 3:** As Parax0 pointed out in the comments, the fucker is a YouTube Partner, which means he's been making money off Exo's run."	t5_2sf9e	True

I got this a couple weeks ago, but just now managed to encode and upload the recording.  I did this run on the Virtual Console, which I've found to have no timing differences with the NES version.  I picked up the game last August along with Sinister1 so we could race it at AGDQ.  10:40 was my ultimate goal time, but I never thought I would get it any time soon.  I gained some confidence while practicing it at AGDQ and decided I was close enough to go for it when I got back home.


What's cool about this running this game in the any% category is that there's practically no RNG at all to worry about, just straight-up memorization and good execution.  I make 4 perceivable mistakes in this run, but if I eventually cut those out, I could probably get a 10:35 (it might take a while though).  Still, this is a pretty clean run, and I'm happy to at least have achieved this time.  I never even played the Ninja Gaiden games until last year, I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for an intense, short, and challenging speedrun!"	t5_2sf9e	True

Any tips how I can improve? Getting an adapter for the controller to use with an emulator so I can savestate right before some of the tricks and don't have to die/redo the whole level?





/EDIT: Completed and recorded a run on emulator. Big improvement on my previous, still pretty bad though :D

I think a perfect human run can get down to 4:10 maybe 4:09 but I think I'll move on now unless someone beats it. I base this on the fact that I have gotten a 2:07 pipe organ before (once out of ~500 runs), and I probably wasted 2 seconds with minor stuff. But getting a 2:07 pipe organ is very, very rare. 

Sorry for the terrible stream layout, I just started streaming using OBS like 2 days ago and I'm still messing with the layout. I realize the controller input thing looks dumb, and everything just looks scattered. Also, I didn't know there's a setting to not show the mouse cursor... lol (yes, I'm running this on FCEUX. I'll eventually switch to NES if my game gets accepted into AGDQ.) 

This is what the run looked like back in the beginning of February. This is really embarrassing. Just saying http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExLnt2Svu0

There is plenty of discussion of this topic on twitter and on the irc #leaderboards channel. I'm curious as to what my fellow redditors think.

If you aren't aware of the discussions going on, here is a quick tl;dr. Basically, SRL is trying to implement leaderboards, but is having trouble figuring out the best way to accomodate runs across multiple systems (console, VC, emulator) and multiple versions of the game (1.0, 1.1, english, japanese, etc.). Some people are saying only consoles should be considered legit. Others are saying only ""official"" releases should be legit (no emulator, but VC is ok because it is an ""official"" first-party emulator), others are saying to allow everything (except things that are completely and obviously broken, e.g. PJ64 v2.0 for OoT).

What do you guys think? Again, please be civil. If someone's personal opinion is that emulator should be banned, don't get angry at them because you are an emulator player. Simply state your opinions and why.

Thank you to everybody who made this possible. There has been a lot of support from all the users and a few mods also. Personally, I've made some really cool friends who are a laugh, and more importantly share the same passion as I do for playing games *really* fast!

A round of applause to /u/I_AM_A_BICYCLE / 'AndyPerfect' for winning the first race in 31:44, and 'McFat89' for not only winning the second race in 31:34 but for also setting a new SRL record for All Cups 50cc! [](/Kappa)// 

The VOD for the first race is [here](http://www.twitch.tv/honeybeard_/b/439843649?t=8m20s) (begins at 8m, 20s in), second race is [here](http://www.twitch.tv/teejm/b/439941982?t=14m25s) (begins at 14m 20s) If anybody has a better quality VOD from their stream, feel free to link it. 240p streaming hype! 

Aside from annoucing the results of the race, I want you guys to (a) express any positive or negative comments about the race, (b) suggest ways in which future races might be improved upon, and (c) vote for next weeks game!

One question I do want to ask is what time is best for you guys? Is an earlier and later race better? Would you rather speedrun on a Friday or Saturday?

I apologize for taking so long on making these videos. I procrastinated and it's my fault, but I figure I should at lest let everybody know how it's going.

I just finished all the outlines for the videos with the exception of Point Insertion which has a rough draft. I plan on getting a rough draft for all the chapters/videos first, and then I'd like to either get all the final drafts for all the chapters/videos and release them all at around the same time, or write the final draft for a video, record it and upload it.

Ideally, I'd like to get all the videos posted by the end of the summer, but if it takes longer, I'm aiming to have them all done by at least the end of this year.

Sorry for taking so long, hopefully they'll be good enough quality so people won't have to ask questions.

Regards,
Woobly"	t5_2sf9e	True

However, I'm having a lot of trouble deciding what to show. Maybe you guys could give me some ideas for good runs to show?

The event is only 4 hours long, so runs &lt;30 minutes are heavily preferred.

I am totally set on showing:

OoT Any% - 22 minutes

SM64 0 star - 8 minutes

Sections of SM64 120 star - 30 minutes

I Wanna Be the Guy - 30 minutes

Super Mario Bros - 5 minutes

Tony Hawk 3 - 6 minutes

This leaves about 2 and a half hours left to fill. Any other good ones to show? Popular games and heavily glitched games are much preferred as I think people will find that the most entertaining. Keep in mind most of these people don't know what a speed run is, so the runs can't be subtly brilliant, they have to be really crazy and awesome. I am also open to showing just sections (like I will definitely show off RBA in some form) but that could get annoying to micro-manage for me.

Okay. Everyone seems to disagree with the ""Do not post any stream links other than your own."" rule. Alright, I understand. Now, how can we compromise? 

From the [last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1cmmjg/rules_have_officially_been_implemented/), 

/u/MasterCMo suggested this:

&gt;Might I suggest a rule that another subreddit I'm subbed to (/r/MECoOp[1] ) uses in regards to streams - if you post a link to a livestream, you are responsible for deleting the link once the stream ends. It might not help as far as the same streamers being reposted, but it would most definitely help in clearing up links to offline streams.

Would you guys agree to this?

If you don't delete it, we won't ban you or anything, it's just more of a common courtesy. Alternatively, if you see a post like ""X is on pace for a WR in X"" and they're done streaming, report it. I don't mind deleting stuff. I'll happily do that. 

I am sorry for not doing this the first time. I would just like everyone to be happy.

Edit:

I made a poll. http://www.poll-maker.com/poll17156x9fFB4c04-2

My idea is have a poll up from sunday to friday with games. After friday, the game with the most votes is what we race.

I wrote up some rules for the IRC channel. Most of it is common sense, but you should [take a look](http://bombch.us/BQO) anyway. 

I need your banner ideas. I already have quite a few, but if you have an idea and want to help shape this subreddit, now is your chance! Please PM me with any ideas you come up with!

I'm a university student from Montreal, Canada who is working on a research project about speedrunning and the community that surrounds it. As someone who has watched speedruns and casually run some games on the side, I was kind of shocked to see how little attention speedrunning has received in game studies and I really want to change that.

A big part of that so far has been keeping a log of my own experiences as I do runs, but I’m only one perspective. That’s where you come in. I have a set of interview questions that I'm looking for people to answer and I thought this might be a good place to turn. If you have some time over the next couple of weeks, I would really appreciate any takers.

That’s about it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Confidentiality is not a problem if you just let me know. I can also make myself available for skype interviews if emails aren't your thing.

If you are interested, let me know here or at speedrunning.research@gmail.com.

Thanks!"	t5_2sf9e	True

No backpack because it allows me to warp anywhere and spawn starites with a bug, so I've come up with 3 categories, Full Map (Map 100% done, I have not routed this), No Backpack, and Backpack. 

I kill myself after every mission because it lets me enter the next zone without the opening cutscene, this cuts around 5 minutes off my run and lets me do other skips and bugs (see: The warp to Sir G.'s Castle).

This would've been around 1:18, but I had two major mistakes.

1. For the mission ""Desert Raiders"", adding a black hole at the end lets me skip around 10 seconds and kill the raiders before the cutscene is over. I messed it up, the black hole sucked up the starite.
2. During Payper N. Penitentiary, I am able to longwarp to the missions, saving me about 5 - 10 seconds. The last one saves me JUST enough time to enter the mission before my speed gets too high and I fly offscreen. Putting the knife in the cake (I needed one more mini starite), shifted the camera and prevented me from clicking on the mission.

I can beak 1:20, have been trying, but unable to get that good of a run on 12 starite and 24 starite so far.

I may route 100% map completion eventually. 


If people have questions about the run, feel free to ask.
Before you ask:

Q: There's a bunch of mini starites hidden, why don't you just use all of these?
A: You get around 20 or so doing this, I use some of them (camel, spring shoes, windy block), but later ones require 2+ objects, it really isn't faster using these. Maybe a TAS might be quicker. 

Q: You missed a zone!
A: I do this on purpose, this zone's starite takes the longest to currently complete out of every mission. I get enough mini starites to skip 1 mission, this is it. I am working to optimize it to skip another, this'll be date night due to the massive cutscene. "	t5_2sf9e	True

I can't seem to find very much on guides or anything about the different techniques he uses. Things such as the long jump bellyflop thing he does a lot, the crazy wall jumps, the BLJ.

1) I know what game I'm going to start with, Super Mario 3, but what are some good games to go to from there?

2)What is some good software that I can use to record from my tv? I don't need superb quality. Just something that will get the job done in semi-decent quality. Preferably something in the $30-$40 range. A little more would be fine, a little cheaper would be fantastic.

3) Is there a way for me to live stream directly from my tv? If so, how would I do it? If not, how do you live stream without using a webcam?

Yup yup. I talked it over with /u/ALT-F-X and added some much needed rules.

**EDIT: The Rules are in the sidebar! Sorry for any confusion, I thought I had pointed that out.**

For clarifications sake, I'll go over them.

The first rule should really be obvious. If you act like an asshole, you will be treated as one. Don't be that guy.

Second rule should speak for itself too. [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is mostly common sense, but read it over sometime. :)

Third rule is simple. Have fun!

If you guys have any questions or feedback, we love to hear it! Thanks for reading guys. [](/FrankerZ)

Edit: Okay, It's clear that you don't agree to rule 2 (Do not post any stream links other than your own.) . Can we compromise? The mods don't want to see the same stream every few days. If you can manage that, we'll agree.

Edit2: Oooookay downvote brigade. I get it. Instead of downvoting all of my posts, why don't you tell me what you want? I'll take the rule out for now. 

/u/MasterCMo suggested this:

&gt;Might I suggest a rule that another subreddit I'm subbed to (/r/MECoOp[1] ) uses in regards to streams - if you post a link to a livestream, you are responsible for deleting the link once the stream ends. It might not help as far as the same streamers being reposted, but it would most definitely help in clearing up links to offline streams.

In an effort to help boost each other up, does anybody fancy (a) racing each other on Speedrunslive.com, and (b) forming a small Twitch.tv community for one another including support, raiding, etc.

If so, then great. We might be able to have a sub-Twitch category called /r/speedrun or something, just an idea.

As for me, I'm Honeybeard (Twitch: Honeybeard_). 23 year old guy from the UK. I have no real experience of speedrunning or streaming. Been watching Twitch for about six months, favourite speedrun games to watch are Boshy, Mario Kart 64, FF VII, VIII, and IV, and Super Mario Bros 2. As for games that I am looking forward to speedrun, I am pretty flexible. I wouldn't speedrun more popular or long games though including Mario 64 or Zeldas.

How about you? Do you have any suggestions of a game we can all race together? A good beginner game might be a circuit of Super Mario Kart. What are your thoughts?

**Edit**: There seems to be some interest already, which is great. If you would all familiarise yourself with [Super Mario Kart for the SNES](http://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Kart), I might suggest we have our first race(s) on Friday 2nd August (Time TBA). This is strictly a run for fun race, so don't be afraid of being bad. I doubt a lot of us will get much practice. I am unfortunately busy this weekend (all of Saturday, most of Sunday daytime), but this doesn't prevent you guys from organising your own events without me.

**Game:** [Super Mario Kart (SNES)](http://speedrunslive.com/races/game/#!/smk/1)  
**Goal:** Complete All Cups 50cc any%  
**Estimate:** 40 minutes  
**Time:** Friday 2nd August, time TBA  
**Emulator** (if needed): Snes9x 1.53

If we can all agree on it, I would like to race using speedrunslive.com. This requires every entry to also [familiarise themselves with that website](http://speedrunslive.com/faq/) and [basic streaming](http://www.twitch.tv/broadcast) (if you're using an emulator).

If you are interested, let yourself be known in this thread with your timezone. If we can communicate via Skype, even better! I will be PM'ing everybody in roughly sixteen hours from now finalising details.

**Edit 2**: I've just done a practice run to familiarise myself with the game and streaming in general. These are my splits if people want to copy them and my first time with no practice. http://i.imgur.com/2zwOOzQ.jpg

My first attempt at this run was completed yesterday, ending up with a time of 4:27:16.  I've improved my routing a bit and made some decent notes, and I believe I can shave 30 minutes off this time before I even try to do some more serious learning. The later part of the run still needs a bit of work but I'll get it down eventually.

I've had some incredibly useful advice given to me by viewers, so if you have any tips feel free to throw them my way. Thanks in advance.

Edit: Massive success!  Run completed at 3:36:51, a saving of 50 minutes.  Thanks to everyone who dropped by to watch.

In general it's something I would be interested in offering habitually (much like Erdos did with math problems) and I would love to see the practice become popular. Here's an example bounty which happens to be one I actually really want to make, but is used here so you have some idea what I'm talking about:

*New Super Mario Bros. 2* has a ""Coin Rush"" mode where you have to get as many coins as possible. I enjoy playing it and have developed what seems to me the fastest strategy for scoring the maximum 30000 coins per run. Today I decided to make and upload to youtube [a video](http://youtu.be/9chvnBNd4A4) of my strategy. However, I couldn't quite get my quickest time when recording (I finished with 77 remaining on the clock when I have previously had 78) and anyway I strongly suspect that a more skillful player could do my exact same strategy but faster. Even more than that I love the creative ways speedrunners break apart games and figure out clever routes, so it would be especially cool if people were able to **destroy** what I think is my oh-so great strategy. I'd like to offer a bounty of, say, $25 to the first person to do the level with 79 seconds left on the clock and, say, $50 to anyone able to do it with 81 or better. (I like to think I would start with moderately generous bounties and as the system became more popular among both players and setters a vague market would emerge where the community developed a broad ""feel"" for what is an appropriate bounty for a particular challenge.)

The above is an example, it is NOT a formal announcement of the setting of this bounty. It was so you have some idea of what I'm going on about. I want to set it and others but I see many things to consider first. Here are my thoughts so far:

Submitting a run is simple enough (video uploaded/emailed), and paying out the bounty too (paypal) but that's only a part of it. I perceive these immediately obvious problems:

1.) How to publicise a bounty to the right people in a credible fashion? I thought about mentioning in IRC and chat channels of known speedrunners, as well as direct messaging them, but why would they take it seriously, if they even saw the message at all? I recall some fighting game combo challenges which have been publicised on Eventhubs to great success, so perhaps speedrunning blogs and news sites are the way to go. What speedrunning blogs and news sites are there that would be open to posting such bounties?

2.) How to persuade participants that they would indeed be paid? One solution seems to be to initially transfer the funds to a well-known, well-trusted, and well-respected member of the community who would be able to retransfer them to the bounty winner, or back to the bounty setter when the deadline was up if no-one had won. (Deadlines on a bounty seem appropriate given the tendency for money which hangs around in one place too long to be eventually spent. This could be a problem if that ""open bounty"" is suddenly solved 10 years later and one week before Christmas.)

3.) How to decide if a submission has successfully met the conditions of the bounty? In my Mario example I feel it would be obvious to me, but as a general principle leaving it to the discretion of the bounty-setter could be unwise. As with the transfer of the actual money without a third party, that would rely on the honesty of the bounty-setter - in this case their honesty not to deny in bad faith that the conditions had been met as a way of getting out of paying up. An independent sufficiently well-versed in the game could be assigned here.

4, 5, 6, ...) ?

As a closing comment, I remember among some of the fighting game communities in London there would be occasional ""money matches"", which were rather different from the US ""Bison dollar"" style of money match. Members of the community who *wanted* to see a high stakes match between specific players would get some money together and offer it as a winner-takes-all incentive to those two players having a showdown first to 15 or so. The money made them fight tooth and claw, it was great. That's different from a bounty, but one idea is the same as what I'm describing here: a financial incentive from people who are interested in the hobby to people who are good at the hobby to direct their efforts in a particular way.

Well, that's quite enough from me. I want to hear what everyone here thinks."	t5_2sf9e	True

After watching gamers speedrun game after game for an entire week at Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), I have decided to jump on the bandwagon and start speedrunning games myself!

""The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates"" is a 1994 SNES title. It was a shining jewel of my childhood, so I was surprised when I couldn't find a single speedrun or TAS for this game.

I will lead the crusade of glory for this forgotten classic!

This category of run includes up to the first encounter of the final boss, Zora, with a time of 11:05. In the future, I will be racing two categories: first encounter and final encounter.

Fellow speedrunner DjDai, a Banjo Tooie speedrunner and current world record score holder on The Bishi Bashi, has also been begun his training alongside me in this SNES classic. I wish the best of luck to the both of us!

EDIT 2:
Since some people have had issues viewing the document, here's 2 PDF's of some tabs

~~Saturn's new Act 1 route~~ [Obsoleted Today]

[Act 1 Route Ingredient Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m9j6qd8jzcg4rdc/Saturn%27s%20Ingredient%20Act%201%20Route.pdf)

--------------------------

**Project Goals:**

* Generate interest in the game through a well presented and detailed guide.

* Provide enough information for each area that will let new players understand how and why things are done.

* Offer optional detours/routes where appropriate that others may wish to explore and experiment with.

* Detailed maps with paths clearly marked (where appropriate) and items to collect displayed.

* Strategy for bosses within the guide will be tested and timed to be effective compared against most other strategies for them, anything discovered to be better will be edited in and updated.

* Fairly aggressive updating, I don't want to half ass this guide and leave it with some sub-par route, as of this posting it is already out of date because a player (Saturn) routed out a better way of doing Act 1, which I'll be updating tonight.

* Eventually there will be formulas for alchemy spell damage so people can experiment within the guide itself to understand and explore why we do certain things with the spells.

* Set a slightly higher standard for guides, I hate looking up a speed run guide and seeing it's out of date, poorly detailed, lacking information, and/or not well organized. I'm sure some people share this feeling and I'm hoping to provide something that isn't remotely like those previous guides.

--------------------------

**Progress:**

&gt; [02-06-13] Guide has been updated for new route all the way to Act 2 Start

&gt; [02-07-13] I now have a run to go off of that's solid enough for further acts, will begin work sometime tonight

&gt; [02-10-13] I have to rewrite the majority of the guide due to a trick found that obsoletes the TAS.

--------------------------

I would absolutely love some constructive criticism on this, it's something I'm very much driven to finish and I want it to be something that we (the people involved with it) can be proud to present to newer players.

I recently started speedrunning DragonBall Z: Legacy of Goku II for the GBA, and I am the only person currently running this game.

(Also, this is a thinly veiled invitation: anyone interested in learning new games should try this one on for size.  Makes for a pretty interesting speedrun because you'll be under-leveled for most fights.  If you don't want to speedrun it, definitely give it a try casually, it's fun both ways.  Avoid Legacy of Goku 1 like the plague, though.)

Anyway, there is a final boss and you can easily predict the final blow, which leads to a fairly long cutscene.  This is where I think the timer should stop (although it's not where I stopped my timer during my first run).

Another possibility goes as follows:  After the cutscene following the final boss fight (which is quite long), you're thrown back into the overworld and have to fly to Kami's Lookout to activate the final cutscene of a game.  You might say you should end the split there, because you're triggering the final text boxes of the game.

However, that segment would be nearly the same length every time, and would only differentiate to the frame (perfect running in this game takes 3 frames to execute, more if you're not TASing). 

I will add some videos shortly to show you what I mean, in case you haven't played the game before.

Some of these runs seem credible as being possible for a human, but some of them are just ridiculous.

These runs are performed by the developers of the game, so they obviously have the opportunity to build in tools for slow motion, re-records, frame-by-frame, etc. Many of them incorporate multiple players, which adds to the difficulty, although they typically look more impressive than they actually are because more things are happening on screen. They also must have some very skilled players in their QA department. 

This run in particular sticks out like a sore thumb though: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja8pyZhV9xA

Five players, all five with very precise timing required to follow a specific pre-defined path. The gamepad player (the one placing platforms) in particular is the one who draws my attention. If you're familiar with the mechanics of Boost Mode you know how hard it is to be really accurate with placing platforms, and this person is able to place platforms for two to three separate paths at once, and also taps the Fuzzies to reverse their direction from time to time.

1370576710.0	1fu9vr	aLttP (GBA) - Palace of the Four Sword (Mirror Glitch) speedrun route	wazzumz	14	1	0	Hello. So I decided to tackle the most insane challenge ever and I plan on devoting time to practice. You may have seen my Master Sword attempts on the SNES version of aLttP. However, this is a run exclusive to the GBA version, involving the Palace of the Four Sword. Normally, you need to beat both aLttP and Four Swords in order to gain access to this dungeon. By using the Mirror Glitch, it is possible to enter the dungeon via other means but there are items still required to complete the dungeon and boss battles. What makes this run extremely difficult to achieve in a single segment is the measly health of 4 hearts. I highly encourage any Zelda fans to try this out, even if you need more heart containers, bottles, and fairies. Here is the route for [noobies](http://pastebin.com/gZK3JJvx) or [veterans](http://pastebin.com/VwTFpdaC). Also, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dzcl5PrX4) is a short tutorial about the Mirror Glitch.	t5_2sf9e	True

1. The final score for the game suggestions is seven votes to [VVVVVV](http://thelettervsixtim.es/) any% ([Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apn2mdLhG_pidHI0OUlLVHl5QkdLblI0TUQza1RuLVE#gid=0)). This will be raced August 24th.  
2. Google Docs has been good for adding gaming suggestions, but does anybody know of a polling website that allows users to add options without potentially rigging the results? I've had to check over 200 revisions from the Spreadsheet in order to make sure no cheating occurred.  
3. I've had a few requests from people asking for only console games to be included in races. They are free to emulate for 24 hours. Opposed to buying a game such as Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV for only a week. What is the general consensus?

I VERY MUCH enjoy speedrunning, and want to continue doing it, but I'm having trouble finding motivation to continue practicing. an example would be a few days ago, I was trying to improve my Rapture time in Meat Boy Any%. I practiced for 3 straight days, and when I went to run it, it was like I had never practiced. I immediately got frustrated and stopped playing.

Some friends of mine are members of a national music fraternity, and our chapter really wants to do something great involving gaming. 

Our idea is to hold a gaming marathon where we all stream games that we're good at and provide commentary, similar to AGDQ but on a much much smaller scale. We would likely all stream in one room using my PC and my TV for the games. We're planning on learning some games to speedrun and having the marathon happen in late april. 

We would not take any money for our fraternity or anything, but choose a music charity to donate to, likely one that promotes education in the schools as that is our main goal with this.

Does anybody have any advice on how we can get this started? Any input would be appreciated.

Aside from announcing the results of the race, this thread is to (a) provide feedback about the race on Aug 24th, and (b) vote for next weeks game! 

To suggest and vote for games to play, [edit this document!!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apn2mdLhG_pidHI0OUlLVHl5QkdLblI0TUQza1RuLVE#gid=0) Feel free to suggest your own games and vote for current games suggested. The vote will close early next week.

The game we are speedrunning next is Super Meat Boy any%! Suggested by /u/lillesvin.

** **UPDATES** ** [](/MVGame)

* There are some criteria for suggesting games:  
a) The estimate must be no higher than 60 minutes.  
b) It must be easy to play on the PC or emulate.  
c) It must be achievable to learn within a weeks worth of practice.  
* Is there any interest in a mumble chat (or equivalent?) We all seem to talk using Skype, but that involves quite a lot of hassle sometimes. Does anybody here have any experience in setting up/maintaining mumble chat or teamspeak?

Thanks again for everybody's contribution.

I've recently gotten into speedrunning MGS 4 but I'm only slowly getting into it because I'm still in the learning process. 
I've also been working on MGS 3 Foxhound single segment which I've done with using saves already where I've had some speedrun methods implemented. I also use speedrun methods for my single segment even though I'm still just doing practice runs. So while I've beed doing these practice runs I've been thinking that I might aswell speedrun MGS3 even though it seems to be more figured out then MGS4.

So are there still any MGS 3/4 speedrunners here or in any of the communitys (are there even more then SDA and SRL?).


I've also started streaming like 3 days ago and I've been enjoying it so much that I really feel like starting speedrunning mgs 3 once I get my single segment foxhound and mgs 4 when I've learned enough to get atleast solid runs. So I'm also thinking about trying to get into SRL on twitch but this comes when I'm ready for it.

1369656210.0	1f4tc2	New to speedrunning with questions and need of advice	Ragnus	12	1	5	"Hello,

I've been watching a lot of streams on twitchTV of speedrunners or MGS of people who don't actively speedrun but most likely have done it in the past. Watching the MGS in particular I've convinced myself to get a ps3 (I only had a 360 till recently) so I could also enjoy MGS4 and
the upcoming MGS V. I've had the hd collection for the 360 already but played mgs 2 and 3 once and didn't even finish PW until I watched the MGS streams.

I've then started to go for the highest rank in the game as practice because in a speedrun you would meet the same requirements (no kills/alerts/continues) so it was/is helpful to aim for the rank before bothering about serious speedruns. Right now I only achieved the highest rank for MGS3 and I could already start practicing on what I can to get a good time while it still would be not even close enough to call it a good run. I also have many strats/routes that I made up myself because I didn't bother looking up routes/starts for everything.

The other MGS game I'm trying to get the highest rank on right now is MGS4. I'm still busy doing the routing but I'm doing just slow progress due to many reasons. One reason is, that I've not only been inspired to try to get into speedrunning but also streaming so I'm more busy getting informatin on what I need and if it is even within range of my possibilities.

Another reason is, that I'm not really sure if it's worth going at these game and try to speedrun these due to their age. For now I know that atleast I want to learn how to speedrun these games. Not with a time that can compete to the WR but so I could say it's an okay time.
The reason why I atleast want to learn how to speedrun the already existing MGS games is so I can hopefully, if I get into speedrunning in general, start learning to run a new game which, in this case, would be MGS V.

So most Speedrunners I watch play rather old games so from watching streams I don't feel like I get much input on rather new games that I might want to run.

________________________________________________________________________________
To sum up questions:
1. Is it worth to get into speedrunning for a game which is mostly figured out already and might not have many active runners

2. What are the best ways to practice? Should Is it more important to learn everything about the game (e.g. mechanics) or should I focus on learning the best existing route? (probably differs based on the game)

3. How to I find information about other active runners? From what I've seen on SpeedRunsLive.com they don't even list mgs3 and 4 in their list of games.

________________________________________________________________________________

I appreciate all kind of advice you could give for somebody who is interested in speedrunning and wants to get into it.

And sorry for that long introduction/explanation text, felt like it should be there.

Thanks in advance :)"	t5_2sf9e	True

I understand that using emulators in speedruns is not legit (for non TAS at least) due to save states and a whole other bunch of obvious reasons, however I have heard a bunch of times in this subreddit and from speedrunners themselves that emulation or N64 Emulation in particular is not accurate enough for speedrunning.

This has always confused me because I use emulators to play casually, rather than constantly having all my n64 games with me, and have never encountered any issues where I felt i would have not seen a certain glitch if I was using the actual console. People claim the SNES emulators are far more accurate but once again I see them as being just as accurate as any N64 emulator I have used. Can anyone explain just how the N64 emulators are inaccurate?

**Hints &amp; Tips**  

* If at all possible, please try to run the NTSC version. PAL is slower.
* Understand the different stats between characters. DK Jr and Bowser play very differently to Peach and Yoshi.
* The timer begins when we select the Mushroom Cup. The timer ends when we cross the finish line of Mario Circuit 4 (the fifth and final race in the Star Cup). Your splits are up to you.
* When you finish the fifth and tenth race (the last race of the Mushroom and Flower Cup), reset the game, and continue to the proceeding cup as quickly as possible. Hard Reset in Snes9x is Shift + Ctrl + R. You can change this by pressing Alt+F9 and going to Page 2. I suggest Ctrl + R, or even just R.
* Coins increase your speed. I think (correct me if I'm wrong), 0 coins decrease your speed by 10% and 10 coins increases your speed by 10%. Anything higher is redundant.
* Ease off the gas pedal and use your momentum to glide around a tight corner, and then speed up. It is better to slow down and speed up then to hit a wall or a heavier character. By hitting a wall, you lose all of your speed.
* Respect Trollser Castle 2 and 3.

SpeedRunsLive has an interesting skew on the games it features, and I'm thinking that really can't be all the speed runs that are going on at any one time. I can't believe that 85% of the world's speedrunners only play Zelda, Pokemon, Super Mario World and Dark Souls. (Yes, I've read all the side-bars!)

Is there any other aggregated source of live stuff? Or is it just a case of knowing the identities of other people and where they hang out?

Thanks in advance for any hints..."	t5_2sf9e	True

This is my currently known compilation of warp glitches in the game. 

Reset Spawning - This allows you to reset into a level. Doing this skips the opening cutscene that starts when you load a level for the first time. To do this, die (adding the attribute ""dead"" to maxwell is the quickest way I know of). While doing the flip animation, press M (or whatever your map macro is) and pick the zone you'd like to enter. When the popup occurs, click reset. If you take too long it'll go away and you'll enter the level normally.

Starite Warp - Upon reset spawning into a level, your map will bug out. Opening it up and selected a zone will not warp you. If you complete a mission, you'll warp to the position of the starite on the new zone. 

Death Stall - Just found this one, no idea of the use yet. This lets you bring the effect of the Starite Warp past starites. This would let you use starite spawning in zones with multiple starites. To do it, move onto the mission, die, click reset and open the map with M. Then, press F, and you'll be able to enter the mission while dead. Finishing the mission will let you do the Starite warp again.

Death Enter - Again just found this one, done the same was as death stall, but instead move over a map transition zone. This'll let you enter the map without the cutscene, but instead at the NORMAL enter point. 

Death Warp - This one works very oddly. I haven't entirely figured it out, but when Reset Skipping into a level and dieing then continuing, you are warped to a position on the map. I believe it is either the spawn point of the last zone you were in, or the first camera spot of the last map you were in.

Mission Swap - On Starite Spawning, in the mission, resetting will result in the mission's objects spawning in the new zone. There is no current uses for this, it's just cool.

Windy Warp - This is a long warp using windy items. Windy items push you right, but if you move left (in some areas), you can build up extreme speed, which (in some cases) will cause you to jet across the map. This is very volatile and may end up in messing up your run. There are uses for it that save time. 

Also there are some crashes with warps, but they're useless obviously. "	t5_2sf9e	True

I was wondering though, where does one start? What are the main 'hubs' of the speedrun community (online, IRC, etc) and how does one choose which game to play? Any help would be great!

EDIT: Hi guys! I'd like to thank you all for the great suggestions in getting started. It seems as though the most common piece of advice is to choose to runs games I actually enjoy playing, which makes a whole lot of sense. I'd also like to particularly thank duckfist for that extremely informative wall of text. Thanks for taking the time to write that out.

As for which games I'm gonna play, the ones I know best are VVVVVV and Metroid Fusion, so I'll start with those. That being said, I'm also really interested in learning something that I can bingo, so I think I'll put in the time to learn Super Metroid as well. 

I must admit that Super Metroid seems much more daunting since it's far more popular and its players more skilled, but your comments about how the community is accepting of newbies are very reassuring!

This is the link to the video, I just finished streaming it aswell. http://www.twitch.tv/projakeyy/c/2677241

The game is quite easy to route because you just need to find the shortest races and marked men and just do them every license. This game is very repetitive because you will be doing most events 4/5 times because every license your races reset it self. This is a Any% speedrun up to the Burnout License, the reason I decided to go up to the Burnout License is because it makes the credits come and I thought that would be a good way to end the speedrun. You could do it up to Elite License but that's like another 2/3 hours added and you will have to complete every event and find every car to do so.

If you have any question, leave them down below.

Edit 1: I Will post a image tomorrow with what races are best to do

Edit 2: Here the link to the races to do http://i.imgur.com/nFvOJmQ.jpg

The List of cars to use:

Hunter Cavalry (Starting car)

Nakamura Ikusa GT (Unlock when you get C License)

Carson Fastback (Unlock when you get B License)

Jensen P12 (This should be the only car you need to takedown and you would use it for the rest of the game)

Rossolini Tempesta (Unlock when you get A License)

Rossolini Tempesta GT (This Car is very hard to use)

Touge Sport (If you cant find the P12 but you find this car, use this)

There is no specific route on this, its just do any of them races from the picture, some races you will complete will end near event that you haven't done yet and you can chain them to together. 

Little tip: When you doing a road rage or Stunt run and you have reached the target score, you can drive to the next event you haven't done yet. a quick way to end stunt runs and road rages is to stop and wait a few seconds and the event will just end it self.

If you do the wrong events there is a way to leave the event without actually quitting the game, All you need to do is go to the menu, go to online menu and go to freeburn online and it will come up, if you do this you will leave the event, just press yes and then leave the menu and bam you have quit the event.

Edit 3: Another Tip: Don't take out any cars when in free roam because it will make the cutscene in the garage a lot longer so just leave them driving around paradise city."	t5_2sf9e	True

The reason for that is that I can't do the Wrong Warp. The first part where I die while killing Gohma is pretty easy, but when it comes to do the actual wrong warp, I fail badly. The part I keep messing up at is the ocarina items part.

Here's the setup I've been trying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9njm8DdZQ1w

I've tried many, many times, but no matter how many times I try it, ocarina items never happens. I go to the corner, do seven backflips, a sideroll, a neutral roll, and backflip while doing ocarina items, but only the cutscene plays. 

I thought it was the fact that my bottle was too far away on the controller, so I moved it to C-left and it still didn't work. I also read that you can't reset after watching the Deku Tree cutscene, so I redid the file and saved outside the Deku Tree. 

No matter what I try, nothing happens. I don't have enough money for a controller adapter to use save states, so I just end up going through the entire Deku Tree again before losing interest after three or four times.

I've been curious about how the [Castle Crush glitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D95R9h7Jqw), shown here on a youtube clip for example, works.  After a few googles, I couldn't find any documentation for it and seeing as how it's one of the better-known ones I figured there should be something to explain why it happens!  Any ideas or resources?  

It seems similar to the Orb glitch in SMW or, in general, to some sort of ""buffer overflow""-like attack where a pointer for the sprites has gone awry.  In the video the sprites that it ""creates"", like the Rambi barrel or the enemy sprites, are those which are close to the Kongs which makes me think that the programming may have initialized and stored the sprite in memory to spawn, but the ""trick barrel"" might make the program perform some check (""Are both Kongs alive?"") to make sure that one of them spawns and this may in turn explain why some of the more bizarre sprites (the shadow ones, the flashy-glowy ones, etc.).

1358151434.0	16jja2	What is the difference between RTA and Single-segment?	megatr	9	2	5	"I feel like there is some confusion on RTA as a term and not a lot of information.

Basically, 'single segment' is a term invented by SpeedDemosArchive: ""Speedruns that beat a game in one sitting without loading save files or quitting are single-segment runs."" 
RTA comes from Japanese runners for 'Real-Time Attack' in that it uses a real-life timer, to contrast between TA, or 'Time Attack' where the runner goes for the best ingame time (possibly by loading saves).

Single segment is associated with SDA, which uses ingame timers in their rankings. This can possibly lead to a difference in ranking because ingame timers to not take lag into account, but a real-timed run will. I don't think this has happened and probably won't ever happen for a variety of reasons. Any run that loads a save will be considered 'segmented' where there is no punishment for loading saves.

The difference in the two term's definitions applies, in practice, only to Zelda games because saving and quitting is pretty good at saving time. Because every game is different, its up to the communties of each game to define their own rules. In the end, SDA is not a leaderboard, and aLttP runners have called their single-segment category ""Any% no S+Q""."	t5_2sf9e	True

(videos included)"	FroYoSwaggins	9	1	7	"I've been frustrated with this star the past couple days. Basically, **Shy Guy seems to change his location** for reasons that are so subtle that I can't tell what it is. Or perhaps it's RNG and I can't control the outcome?

I've compiled some short video clips as examples. Here's the ""ideal"" run: http://youtu.be/Dp9RO8WsVFY

And here's the run where Shy Guy moves forward from his original location: http://youtu.be/VIKaTIn7NnQ

There are not too many differences in the above videos. I managed to get to the pillar fairly quickly in both videos. So that takes away my first thought about how speed matters. 

For more proof, I recorded another video where I purposely slowed down the time it took me to reach the pillar: http://youtu.be/v6W-fBMINpE

Here's some other reasons I suspect Shy Guy moves:

* My method of reaching the pillar (using Long Jump instead of the Jump Dive)

* Keeping Shy Guy in my line of sight, rather than the pillar blocking my view of him

* Touching the area to the right (after jumping over the hill) that is not quick sand.

Up until that point I'd been improving my time steadily, but since then I haven't even been able to get sub 30m except for one time where I got a 28:something... I've been doing between 3 and 25 runs per day (except for a few days where I haven't had time to play) and I haven't changed my strats at all. When practicing individual worlds I usually beat my splits handily, but when I try to do an actual run I start messing up the most ridiculous things. I'm sure you all know it --- you've beaten this level at least 100 times in a row without dying and suddenly you die 15 times on it using the same strat as always. I've never gotten mad when playing games before, but when stuff like that happens it apparently sends me right into the red, and that's certainly not a feeling I enjoy.

I'm getting really frustrated, because I'm pretty sure that I have the skill to get at least sub 22, but my hands don't seem to want to listen. Every time I've got a good run going (like -58s on the second-to-last split) I completely choke in the last world and end up completing the run at +6m. I even tried running without a timer to alleviate some of the pressure of knowing you're ahead, but it didn't really make any difference, because you know when you've got a good run going and in my case that equals choking apparently. It wouldn't feel so bad about it if my PB was actually good, but it's crap and I *should* be able to do better.

So how do *you* deal with this stuff? Do you take a break for a week or something knowing that you'll get rusty and will have to retrain a bit before getting back into shape? Do you keep at it even though your thumbs and your pride hurt? Do you accept the outlook that you're probably never going to improve and find another game to run? Or do you do something completely different?

It doesnt connect to any global leaderboards any longer but it does record your times on each level and I still spend a lot of time trying to beat my times and get each one as low as possible.

I've given it a very, very amateur couple of attempts and came up with a rough structure. Using the in-game clock for measurement, complete a level as quickly as possible, then subtract the ending time (the clock stops when Mario reaches the flagpole) from the starting time:

W1-1  400 – 348 = 52sec

W1-2 (Take Shortcut)  400 – 317 = 83sec = 1min23sec

W1-A  300 – 209 = 91sec = 1min31sec

W5-1  400 – 306 = 96 = 1min36sec
W5-2  (Take Shortcut) 400 – 309 = 91sec = 1min31sec

W5-6  400 – 313 = 87sec = 1min27sec

W5-Castle  500 – 343 = 157sec = 2mins37sec Running Total = 00:11:57

W6-1  400 – 347 = 53sec

W6-2 500 – 408 = 92sec = 1min32sec

W6-Tower (Use Secret Finish) 500 – 375 = 125sec = 2min5sec

W6-6  400 – 268 = 132sec = 2mins12sec

W6-Tower 2 500 – 357 = 143sec = 2min23sec

W6-7 400 – 290 = 110sec = 1min50sec

W6-Castle (Use Rear Entrance) 500 – 427 = 73sec = 1min13sec Running Total = 24:14

W7-1 400 – 265 = 135sec = 2min15sec

W7-2: 400 – 322 = 78sec = 1min18sec (Although level 7-3 can also be taken here)

W7-Tower 500 – 243 = 257sec = 4min17sec

W7-Ghost House (Take Shortcut) 400 – 310 = 90sec = 1min30sec

W7-Castle  500 – 371 = 129sec = 2min9sec

W7-Airship  600 -  325 = 275sec = 4min35sec

W8-1 (Take Shortcut) 400 – 320 = 80sec = 1min20sec

W8-4 400 – 201 = 199sec = 3min19sec

W8-Boss  400 – 225 = 175sec = 2min15sec

W8 – Final Boss 700 - 646 up to 1st door, 619 up to killing Bowser for the first time, 608 up to the stairs, 488 to defeat final boss, (700 - 646) + (646 - 619) + (619 - 608) + (608 - 488) = 3min32sec up to defeating the final boss

**Total Time = 50 minutes 44 seconds**

This is all very rough around the edges and I know there are levels which could use a LOT of tightening (especially the boss fights) but the quick route to the last level is sound. With the new Squirrel suit item and the Power Squirrel Suit especially I wonder if many of these times could be beaten easily with heavy use of flying through a level....I didn't depend on those items during this speedrun 99% was all running &amp; jumping.

Anyway I hope this is of some use to people thinking of trying this. Please let me know of your thoughts and your own attempts!"	t5_2sf9e	True

Now I want to get into speedrunning, and maybe you can recommend me games which are good for speedrunning? I started to practice one of my favorite games, Dark Souls, BKH% and AllBosses% on Xbox, but I have to move away and I can't take my Xbox with me. 
I'm looking for a RPG: 

* The WR shouldn't be higher than 1:30:00, so my time would be approx. 2:00:00. 
* Some RNG is okay, but the run shouldn't completly depend on it. 
* It should be playable either on the PC or on an emulator, but I can't emulate stuff like PS2 (thanks craptop).
* Something along the likes of Final Fantasy would be neat.

_______________

Current SDA Run: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFZpzAlYNI (16:35)

I was hoping to find someone familiar with running this game to answer a few questions:

* Is emulator standard/acceptable?  I have it for Genesis, but find the system's controllers to be very unresponsive.
 * Answer: Emulator would not qualify for SDA submission.  (I should have guessed)
* When does the timer start?
 * Answer: From other runs I have been showed, it seems to start when you press Start Game.
* What are the differences between difficulties?  Is it only the amount of lives you start with, or are does the AI change?
* Is it not actually necessary to get all the flutes in the third level?  moooh seems to skip one and still completes the level (Agrabah Rooftops).
 * Answer: See next question.
* What causes the magic carpet to take you on the longer route or the shorter route on the third level (Agrabah Rooftops)?
 * Answer: Grabbing one of the flutes.
* Is in mandatory to complete the magic carpet ride challenge (Rug Ride) ?  It is 2 minutes quicker to just let yourself die 3 times.
 * Answer: Seems there are two categories because of this.

1376281512.0	1k6r1r	Really interesting question...	tbio25	7	0	6	"Ok, so ""The Boy and His Blob"" for the NES has a huge glitch where you fall down the hole, call for the blob, and fall down the hole again and press left and this allows you to walk through walls. This can be seen in the epic TAS here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=331v-D14V7k

As you walk to the left, you actually run through the credits screen. I've managed to do this in real time (it's actually not too difficult). The TAS ends the timing on the last input, which doesn't actually happen for a minute afterwards. However, my question is if it should be considered beating the game if you scroll to the credits screen, despite being able to do inputs. 

The only analog I can come up with is OoT, when you wrong warp to the credits from a dungeon. This was considered beating the game back when it was the fastest way to any%.

So I don't think anyone runs this game at all, or has ever run it (I can't find anything, but I'd love to know someone else has also done this), so on a technicality I guess it's a WR, but I don't put much stock in that.


I routed this game myself over the past month (would have been faster, but time constraints due to work and what not) and finally sat down and did a couple full runs today.  A few offline, and two streamed (to just myself, because no one has ever even heard of this game).


I'd love to recommend this game to people, but I honestly can't.  I wanted to route it because I remembered it being really fun the first time I played it, but frankly it's a pretty lack-luster game with a lot of bad design (like AI that never misses, that's a TON of fun. mutter grumble grumble).  I do plan to continue to run it and skim time off (I think with some optimization I can take off 2+ minutes in a single level) though, and I'd welcome competition. Far more fun to run games other people also run.

Some games I've already attempted to learn include Metroid Fusion, Metroid Zero Mission, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. I also own a copy of Metroid 2, been meaning to give that one a shot.

Preferable criteria:

* Games that are more skill based than route based
* Length anywhere between 45 mins to two hours
* Any system (emulators), but I would prefer either GB, GBC, GBA, Gamecube, Wii or PC (because then I can buy physical copies).
* Any genre, preferably RPG or Side scroller

The criteria might seem strict, but I'm pretty flexible. Feel free to throw shit at me. The only one I really care about is the game length. Probably three hours at max.

Also, Virtual Console games DO count for that third.

I appreciate any help :D

Edit: My Twitch: http://twitch.tv/vespher/

Edit 2: I like JRPGs and Anime style games. Those get +1s.

I'm not trying to bring this back up for the sake of bashing, but as a speedrunning community, we need to not treat people badly if they make us upset. That's the issue between the Runner and the person they are (if at all) upset with.

1359983857.0	17v59w	A general question from a guy new to speedrunning	Itrillian	6	1	6	"I've been interested in speedrunning for a while mostly because it seemed like a fun challenge to do for one of my favorite games : Darksouls.

However I wanted to start off with another game first, preferably one that wasn't pretty much solved completely yet. So I've started practicing Dishonored speedruns. I've gone off what I've been able to find on youtube and practicing the run and shaving off seconds has been fun to do. Mind you I'm not looking to set down any wordrecords , I just want to have fun with it and challenge myself.

However, I've been having some problems with the game. First off there's a really specific point where the game pretty much always crashes if I go too fast. Luckely it's right at the start so I guess I can just start over everytime that happens but it's quite annoying.

Secondly , there's a surprisingly big amount of random elements to the game. How do you handle this? Do you just need to hope you get lucky on a run and put down a much better time even though you might have played worse than a previous run. A good example is the golden cat where seemingly randomly the 2 brothers will be in different spots, and one of the configurations is quite obviously faster than the other one. Or the Boyles party where you can get one out of three different targets. Other examples are guard placement/behavior and static defenses acting differently on a whim.

**tldr;**How do you handle randomness in a game when trying to run it?

One small sidenote question , on speedrunslive is it even possible to register a run for yourself or do you need to always be running against other people in a race?"	t5_2sf9e	True

Since VC saves so much time because it loads faster they made it into a different category when it comes to SM64 but why isn't it the same with IQue? I mean Cosmo showed a week or two ago that you saved atleast 10sec (maybe more can't really remember) when playing with the IQue (you save this time in faster text though and not load times) compared to playing the japanese Oot. To me it seems that this should also be a different category if you're going to separate versions because of the time they save.

i'm in the speedrunning community more or less for 2 years but until now i have been a lurker and just informed but never submitted any runs. Now i got to a level, that i'am about to submit my first run! I want to submit one of my Final Fantasy X runs and have a few questions for the terms. 


* At first i want to run the PAL-Version of the game and since it is a difference of 50 to 60 fps between the NTSC and the PAL Version i guess this would open up a new catergory, or would it not?


* And i got the problem, that i have no capture card so i thought about using the PSCX2 i found no evidence of it giving any advantage over the console (unlike for example Project 64 2.x where you have faster loading times) or have i missed something?


* And last but not least - the game takes about 10 to 11 hours to finish so i would prefer taking a break after maybe 5 hours. I would not retry and would just jump in at the place i did before without any changes .. just a slight pause. Would it still count as a single segment (since it is without retries) or would it count as segmented, because it is not in a single sitting?

Super Meat Boy: I'm actually pretty good at this and can do the light world quite speedy. I've talked about it on my stream before but we'll see.

Ocarina of Time Any%: I definitely think I could do this. Cosmo really inspired me here. Plus it's just very cool run that I'd love to learn. Although I don't want to end up hating one of my favourite games.

Hotline Miami: Just a cool run, it's fast paced and fun. I'm all right at it but I would need more practice.

Super Mario Sunshine: I don't have a lot to say other than that I've watched a lot of streams on it so I actually get the strats more-so than the others on this list.

Super Mario 64 16 Star Run: It's shorter and wouldn't require quite as much focus. But I'd still need a ton of practice, because I'm no where near as good as I need to be.

Super Mario World (Probably Any% but I'm up for aything): I'm most interested in this because I love the game so much but I need a lot of practice. I don't know the strats as well as the others on this list. I'm trying to catch more streams from it but it seems like I'm a ways away from even attempting it.

What sort of capture card do you guys recommend for AV/S-Video recording?

Could anyone tell me what the current WR time is, and link me the VOD/video if available?

Oh and i'm looking for a single-segment run.

Thanks."	t5_2sf9e	True

1368757934.0	1ehs8i	Need guinea pigs for my 60fps console streaming guide	unwary	6	1	2	"The gist of it is that I use Mediaplayer Classic to output the video that is captured from my nes, and then I postprocess the video using a script thru FFdshow using Avisynth where the video gets some color fixing and upscaled. Then I finally stream that output with Open Broadcaster at 60fps.

It took a lot of experimenting to find some good deinterlacing plugins and then dealing with one really weird bug that I finally figured out with MPC.
