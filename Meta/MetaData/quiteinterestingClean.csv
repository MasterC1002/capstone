However, sometimes it bothers me when the writers try to fool the panelists through clever wording rather than stumping them because of their preconceived notions. The one that bothers me most is ""How many Moons does the Earth have?""

The answer HONESTLY is one. Other ""moons"" in our solar system have different names and are classified as natural satellites. Plus, Cruithne doesn't even count as a satellite.

It's not a big deal but it doesn't seem to be within the spirit of the show.

I'm an American, and am finding more excellent programs all the time from the BBC. And QI is right up there as one of the best I've seen.

I plowed through every episode, (including the pilot, 'making of' and all of the XL episodes too) and I find myself just picking a series, and having it on in the background while I do stuff around the house. And every time I watch one, I laugh at something I didn't pick up before, or learn another nugget about the blue whale (hehehe).

Anyway, I'm eagerly awaiting the April series, and can't wait to join in on the conversation after I search the interwebs and liberate a copy to view across the pond.

The site says they had to remove all their links but would be back up with a new tv site and a new name on January 15. Its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/WatchSerieseu/210686605636231) suggests using http://www.1channel.ch/?tv, but I am nervous about using any other site without getting some feedback on its legitimacy.	t5_2rfzr	True

Alright listen up, [maggots](http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/soldiercat2_icon1350.jpg), I hope you're reading this while on the toilet because this post is going to get scary. *Really* scary. If you've got old ladies watching you right now, then tell them to go away. They shouldn't bother you when you're on the toilet anyways.  

Gentlemen, (and also lady-gentlemen) we have a situation of the utmost concern: I was using my computer-box to do some reconnaissance in the southwestern region of Reddit, past the LOLmountains and a few miles south of the bitstreams, when I discovered something truly horrifying. I had seen many disturbed subreddits in my day: I'd seen /r/WTF videos on bizzare abnormalities, I'd traveled far, far North to /r/fiftyfifty, where I'd seen all manners of horrors, and porn. Lots of porn. I've hit RandNSFW so many times I've lost count already. But nothing, NOTHING compares to what I saw there in that valley in-between the provinces of /r/funny and /r/photos that fateful day.

I saw... /r/MildlyInteresting.  It was *horrible*. The entire populace was being subjugated under the oppressive rule of mediocrity. Every last subject was forced to post banal pictures of things that were halfhearted and dull, *or worse*, posted images and posts that were of interesting facts, explained in the dullest possible light! Interesting facts are *our* area of expertise! The regime has been in power for so long, that I saw to my horror that the populace outright *accepted* these injustices as the norm, settling for something only mildly interesting. I immediately ran back as fast as I could for three whole hours back here, back through the deep forests of General Ignorance, back to the Quite Interesting coastline to tell you of their plight.

Quite Interesting Ladies and Gentlemen, I plea for the poor souls wallowing in the valley of only Mildly interesting material: To Arms! To Arms! We must liberate our generally ignorant brethren from the fist of mediocrity, and deliver unto them material that isn't sort-of interesting, is not kind-of interesting, isn't uninteresting, and **ABOVE ALL** is **NOT** *MILDLY INTERESTING!* We must deliver unto them that which is *unequivocally* Quite Interesting.

**TL;DR: Ah HA! One's fallen in the trap boys! Drop the net! We've caught one!**
