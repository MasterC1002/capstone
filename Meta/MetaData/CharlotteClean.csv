Excellent restaurants, hung out at the 7th St Public Market for a couple hours, walked around town a ton. Your city is amazingly clean and incredibly walkable and pedestrian-friendly. It feels very well laid-out and designed. Everyone is super friendly.

1330970207.0	qitjd	The vote on an NC constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is coming in 2 months.  Let's stop this.	LAR0311	76	8	19	"Hi fellow Charlotte redditors.  I'm sure some, if not most, of you have heard of this already.  On May 8th, there will be a vote to add Amendment 1 to the NC Constitution.  That amendment is to ban same sex marriage:

&gt;""Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State. This section does not prohibit a private party from entering into contracts with another private party; nor does this section prohibit courts from adjudicating the rights of private parties pursuant to such contracts.""

This amendment is religiously motivated and has no business in our state constitution.  In fact, nothing that oppresses a certain group of individuals has a place in any constitution.  For those who agree with me and support equality in this state, we need to get the word out so this does not make it into our constitution. 

Here is link to [Protect NC Families](http://www.protectncfamilies.org/), an organization opposed to Amendment 1.

1354784173.0	14djw5	Went to Barefoot Archery today. 	uologan	71	6	10	"I know absolutely know nothing about archery but a friend of the family who has really never had a significant Christmas expressed an interest in it. So I wanted to make this one special for him, but, I didn't have a lot of money. Ended up being directed to [Barefoot Archery](http://www.barefootarchery.com/) all they specialize in is archery. After cruising around the store it was apparent that this stuff was out of my financial league. The owner came over to see if he could help so I gave him the story. He went to the back and came out with an older Darton compound that looked pretty sweet. He said $75. I asked about arrows and he said he would throw in 3 with tips. So I was like SOLD! I told him at first I had about a $100 budget. Right so he comes back with the bow and the arrows. I casually ask if my friend can come here and use the range. He then produces a ticket for 2 free hours....which is basically $20. I'm like, 'Sweet thanks!' how much do I owe you? He says...'$65' Blew my mind. 

It made me want to give a 'pat on the back' in the best way that I could. I think these guys have been there for forever and if anyone is in need of archery type things then this is the place. "	t5_2qo2j	True

1370819402.0	1g0c5j	Testing the waters, who would be interested in participating in a Restore the Fourth Rally in Charlotte	manergy	80	20	64	"I've organised two events like this in uptown Charlotte in the past, both with a decent turn out of 150-200 people and since I acquired the proper permits everything went very smoothly. So I'm wondering if any of you would be interested in peacefully supporting our Fourth Amendment rights in Charlotte or Raleigh, depending on your location. I haven't begun any kind of planning for this event yet but the date of the rally will be July 4th. Time and location is undecided. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fxm1h/introduction_please_read_this_first/) in /r/restorethefourth may answer some questions about what this movement aims to achieve. 

Please feel free to post suggestions and if you are interested please let me know. Thank you!

Edit 1: I feel like I should add that the date of July 4th may not be the best for everyone and we're still very early in the process of planning this event. So the date is not solid yet.

Edit 2: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/?sk=welcome#!/events/1383530558525482/) page is up. 

Edit 3 9:28PM: I can already see growing support for a Raleigh rally. If you would like to start a Raleigh rally, feel free to. I am not capable of organizing two events but I can share my knowledge and any documents I have with whoever wants to organize the Raleigh meetup. **That being said,** it would be best to have as large a group as possible. If you can make it to Charlotte or are willing to carpool, please wait before starting a new rally event. Thanks everyone!

Edit 4 9:50pm: I'm starting to upload some helpful documents concerning the laws in Charlotte [here is the link](https://drive.google.com/?authuser=0#folders/0B92WYAng4f_wNk5Na2xEdXI5bEk)

Edit 5 11:16pm: Signing off for the night. Please join the Facebook group if you are planning to attend. If you don't have an account, just create one for the event because until we get a website or IRC channel set up, the Facebook page will be the best way to get information regarding the event. 

Edit 6: Good morning everyone! I wanted to add something to Edit 3. It looks like there is plenty of support in Charlotte to justify holding the rally in the Queen City. So that is solid now, we still need a solid time for the event. If we do hold it on the 4th of July, we should start around 10am and stay until maybe 3pm. We want to make sure people can still be with their family on that day. You could even bring your family along if they also hold the 4th amendment close. There will be a fireworks show uptown as soon as it gets dark that night, its usually around 830pm if I remember correctly. There are also lots of parks nearby where you can grill out and watch some fireworks from. **Here is what we need from all of you:** Tell us the best time frame that will work for you on July 4th. If nothing works, let us know that too. Don't be afraid to bring the conversation over to Facebook, some wall activity will get more people interested that don't follow reddit. Thanks everyone!"	t5_2qo2j	True

1359649621.0	17mvmq	Queens Road is slightly less ridiculous than you think.	ketosabe	55	9	23	"J.S. **Myers** (""S"" is for Springs, the same Springs that had a huge textile industry) eventually owned 1005 acres (using it for cotton production) from Providence Road to Sugar Creek, and his home was stately, and located right around where the Manor Theater is now. He planted it with stately trees, and it (his home) became known as **Myers Park**. 

He also dreamed of one day using some of the land for a nice suburb (imagine that!) for Charlotte. His daughter married a developer named George Stephens, who had worked with the soon-to-be-""famous"" John Nolen, planner/architect extraordinaire from Philadelphia (studied at Wharton and Harvard). Stephens enlisted other investors as well.

Their first? (or most important) purchase was of the McD Watkins dairy farm, which connected ""Myers Park"" with the existing trolley line on Elizabeth. If you don't know this, folks, Elizabeth becomes Trade . . . so that's important . . . even rich people gotta get to work. **More importantly, folks, this explains the portion of our funny map picture of Queens that isn't a loop**.

However, ""The trolley needed a way to turn around at the end of the line, and Nolen turned this necessity to a virtue when laying out his plan. At the southern extremity of the suburb he formed the boulevard into a wide loop so that the cars could turn back to town, and, equally importantly, so that no resident would be more than a two and one-half block walk from mass transit."" **This explains the rest of all Queens Road segments that are in a loop.**

Finally, neither Nolen nor Stephens named Queens Road . . . they left it up to a contest which was won by a school teacher at Central High (Central High is now CPCC). She chose ""Queens"" because of the naming of Charlotte after Queen Charlotte. Shortly thereafter, Presbyterian College for women, located in Myers Park and also designed by Nolen, was renamed ""Queens College.""

I'm a construction worker in Charlotte, and lately, I've been working on an upfit at the old Mecklenburg County Courthouse (now DA's office) at 700 E. Trade here in town. 

From the outside, the building only appears to be three stories, but it's actually seven. There's a sub-basement, a basement, levels 1-3 with offices, and then 4 and 5 which house an old jail.

The courthouse was built in 1898, and the best I can figure from writing on walls, the jail was last used in the 1969-70 time period.

Everything still works-you'll see a long lever in a cabinet that's used to open various doors on the larger cell block. The small silver buttons select which doors to open and close, and the large (3ft long) lever is pulled to activate those doors. 

The jail itself could house probably about 70 or so people at full capacity. There are larger cells that housed four inmates, and smaller ones that housed individuals. You'll see in the pics.

The best I can tell, this is all going to be left intact. The only thing that has been removed are the locks for the individual cells and the beds in all the cells for some reason, both removed a long time ago. The cost of lead abatement for removal, and the sheer logistics of getting tons of steel out of a building likely makes it cost-prohibitive to remove the space. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I'll be keeping an eye on this thread for a few days.

I also share a family connection to this space-at the end of the gallery, you'll notice a couple pictures of a WWI memorial plaque. Keller Stillwell was my great-grandfather's twin brother who was killed in France on Armistice Day, after the treaty was signed. If you don't believe me, I can provide photos of his gravestone at a local churchyard, and the letter recieved from the U.S. Army upon his death.

My grandfather on my Mother's side was a Charlotte city policeman from 1966 to 1975. He likely put a few people away up here.

If you don't like the people going to the meetup, then don't fucking go and stop ruining it for the rest of us. 

If you are a ""attention whore"" or a ""push over"" or a ""know it all,"" I really don't care, I still want to meet people and broaden my comfort zone. And I really hope you guys are more pleasant than people are giving you credit for.

We've reviewed her various places, but I thought this forum would also be a good place to post our warning.

My husband and I were very unhappy with The Clebourne House, and we would not recommend them as a wedding venue.  After being given the “salesperson smile,” we found that as we got closer to our wedding day the director/owner of the Clebourne house, Candace, became increasingly more difficult to work with.  As you can find in other reviews, if you choose to go with people (officiants, caterers, photographers etc) outside of Candace's suggestions, the helpfulness that she is willing to give will decrease quickly.  

She was incredibly rude to our guests, as well.  Many guests mentioned how pushy, loud, and rude she was when dealing with our ceremony and reception.  She was unorganized and unprofessional both during our year of planning and especially during our wedding day.

Further, Candace requires anyone who books with her to also use her catering.  Our food tasted terrible, our buffet was tiny, and she tore it down before all of our guests were finished eating.  Not only that, but she promised us hot roast beef and gave us cold-cut roast beef from a deli counter.  When we mentioned to her that we had wanted hot roast beef, she denied ever having that conversation with us.

All-in-all, Candace is extremely difficult to work with.  She didn't respect us or our ideas/vision for our wedding, and she made the whole planning process more stressful than necessary.  My husband and I don't have fond memories of our wedding day because of all of the things that Candace did to make us feel unwelcome, unwanted, and unappreciated on our special day.  When we tried to speak to her about these grievances, she wouldn't discuss any of the real issues we addressed.  She wouldn't even return our emails after she sent a first response email that basically said, ""too bad"".  Bottom line, Candace wants your money, and once she has it, you're not important to her anymore.  

Though The Clebourne House seems like a good deal, it really isn't.  Our advice is to book somewhere else. "	t5_2qo2j	True

Here is my suggested script:

 &gt;Senator,

&gt; As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. McIntyre voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse. I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving into the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this. I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at my university. Your younger generation does not agree with these draconian laws and as they know CISPA to be. Again, I plead to you to vote no on this bill. I look forward to hearing back from you.

I ran the Spartan race at the national whitewater center a few Saturdays ago, came home and a few days laker noticed a strange rash on my arms and legs. After talking with my teammates, all of which had the same rash, I went to the doctor. They said that I have Impetigo, which is a fairly serious skin based staph infection.

Just wanted to let you know that New Years in your city was awesome.  I had commented earlier that I was attending the Widespread Panic show from Atlanta.  Our crew took your advice and went to Noda brewery (awesome) and Heist (excellent food - alright beer).  We also hit up the Diamond diner, Midnight diner and Amelie's - Midnight was amazing.  I really enjoyed exploring your city!  Walked around the NASCAR Hall of Fame - looked cool, especially how they lit it at night.  My favorite moment outside of the incredible show that Widespread put on was walking back from the arena through the club scene at EpiCentre.  It was hilarious to see the club goers and the hippies passing each other both being like ""WTF????""  There were definitely some amateurs out there - lots of crying and yelling and screaming at cabs, haha.  Just wanted to say I loved your city and you should be proud!"	t5_2qo2j	True

**Edit#2: I believe I have found a home for the Jeep. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays all!!!**
If you'd like to comment below, or ask questions, fine. Otherwise, if you are interested in either, how about PM'ing me?

Here's the deal: 

~~1) I have 4 tickets to the Panthers game and a parking pass~~. I can't go, and I'd like to give (yes, give) the tickets to someone other than a ""usual suspect"" that I often offer them to. Here are my terms: The tickets are good (middle bowl), and free, but in addition to being able to meet me some time tomorrow (I live near uptown) you must 

a) root for the home team, 

b) generally behave (not get shitface wasted) 

c) include a child or children who never/almost never get to go and would be thrilled as part of an early Xmas, late Hanukkah, whatever gift, 

d) promise on those children's lives that you will go (and not sell them), send me a picture of you at the game as proof, and 

e) think about some nice thing to ""pay this forward""--I really don't care what, just something.

~~**Idea #2: I have a used ""Power Wheels Jeep Hurricane two seater""**~~ [picture of jeep hurricane]( http://trus.imageg.net/graphics/media/trus/Aplusplus/2011/2310848/Fisher-Price-Power-Wheels-Jeep-Hurricane-with-Monster-Traction-2310848-01.jpg) that I am retiring from my kids' toys. It also is free. The best ages for these are probably 3-5, but allegedly it can handle up to 130 lbs weight (combined for 2 children) In addition to being able to pick this up (it's big) some time tomorrow,) here are my conditions:

a) you are at least semi-handy. I will show you the one problem I have had with it (has to do w/ the gears/axle) and show you my fix, but be prepared to have to tinker with it from time to time

b) you can afford a new battery charger (and at some point, a new battery) The battery still has a charge, but I can't find the charger. They sell them at Walmart, near the Power Wheels. They ain't cheap, but since the toy itself is like $400ish new, spending $40 on a charger is a cheap way (note: a small charger w/ alligator clips may work, but I don't know)

c) This must be for your child(ren), not to sell. Please send me a pic of them enjoying it for proof some day?

d) pay it forward in some way. I don't care, rake your elderly neighbors leaves, or go visit a shut-in, or call that family member you've been estranged from and tell them you're sorry (even if they should be the ones saying they're sorry. Just do something nice.

I hope this works, I'm just trying to do something kind today. I will edit this when these 2 items are gone. Peace, Love, and Joy this season and always."	t5_2qo2j	True

Lots of great bands were there rocking it out in the rain to mud-soaked adoring fans.  Sadly, a few bands (Rise Against, Volbeat, Soundgarden &amp; Bush) shirked their responsibilities to thousands of hard-working people who paid alot of money to stand in the cold pouring rain to get DISSED by some their favorite bands.  As one of those rain &amp; mud-soaked fans, my girlfriend &amp; I were appalled at the way this was handled, both by the Rebellion ""Event Crew"" and the bands themselves.  After 1.5 hours of no music, the ""Information tent"" was overrun by cold tired people wanting to know what was going on.  The answer from the Tent attendant (accompanied by a cop) was ""I have no idea.""  People were starting to get very irate.  Shortly thereafter the Information Tent just disappeared!  Cops began to amass at the side of the stage, as they were fearful of a major situation once the crowd found out that the ""Rain or Shine"" event was cancelled due to rain.  Yes, that's what I said!  We finally decided to leave upon seeing Bush's equipment being removed from the stage &amp; being loaded into a truck.  There were still many thousands of people there when we left, standing around wondering ""what the fuck?""  As we exited, we saw a very irate woman being subdued by 2 cops.  Instead of telling people what was going on, they just left us standing around in the cold rain.  Communication people!  And to all the bands who played their hearts out in the rain ((like Buckcherry, Sevendust, Steel Panther, Pop Evil, Red Line Chemistry and Heaven's Basement), you ROCK!  To the 4 pussy bands who copped out because of a little water falling from the sky, you SUCK! This is just disgusting!"	t5_2qo2j	True

I thought I was going to spend my entire time here watching TV and listening to the niece cry. Thanks to this subreddit I had the best vacation of my adult life:

- I watched the Charlotte Knights take on the Atlanta team, and caught a foul ball bare handed! (flipped it to a kid)
- Went to a local Comedy Club
- Bowled in a pretty cool lounge alley 
- Visited an REI in person for the first time and wanted to max out my credit card
- Ran the Blue Points 5K by the football stadium
- Checked out the NASCAR hall of fame (I'm sure it's a big deal to anyone who like NASCAR but I was lost)
- Went to the Whitewater Center and had a great time rafting and zipping.

1371149198.0	1ga9sy	The /r/Charlotte Job Search - Let's get some redditors hired!	kenfagerdotcom	30	3	42	"Hello (your reddit username here),

I am currently looking for work in the Charlotte area and know that I'm not the only one. I currently work with *zero* redditors and that needs to change. Monster, LinkedIn, and Craigslist are not leading to interviews so it is time to turn to another network. 

Here is how I imagine this works. If you're looking for work leave a comment of what field you are looking for. Then briefly list with bullet points some of the experiences/skills you have. Hopefully a fellow redditor will read your comment and give you a lead. Best case scenario: You get a job. Worst case scenario: You get the satisfaction of trying. Tips about leads even from people not job searching would be appreciated.

**Job Search Example from JohnQRedditor:**

     I am looking for a new job related to my passion of redditing. Explanation etcetera...

     Field: Professional Redditor
     Experience: 
     * Skill #1 - Posting OC to various subreddits
     * Skill #2 - Karma delegation to comments
     * Skill #3 - Mod of several niche reddits
     * Skill #4 - Professional bacon eating
     &gt;&gt;LinkedIn Profile Link Here&lt;&lt;

     

**Job Example from AwesomBoss5000:**

     
     We've been looking for a person to professionally mod our corporate subreddits with skill and accuracy. 
     It would also be nice if we had someone to generate some OC every now and then. 
     Must love bacon.



Let's get some /r/Charlotte people hired. Go to it.

Oh, and thanks /r/Charlotte.

**FYI:** I checked with the /r/Charlotte mods if it was cool if I post this here instead of /r/CharlotteJobs for better exposure. They were cool with it. Thanks */u/uologan* and */u/Ridley87*."	t5_2qo2j	True

Tonight we're in Concord, at 363 N Church, serving up free apple and peach pie slices from 7 pm until whenever the pie runs out.

This is an event put on by local shops and we are their guest.  I'm told that there will also be musicians and wine slushies.  Sounds like fun, so we hope to see lots of redditors there!

About 7 months ago I rescued two kittens that had been abandoned by their mother outside my apartment complex. They were about 8 weeks old at the time. The problem is, the fiance and I are moving in together and between the two of us we have six (!) cats. I know. The new landlord isn't down with that. We never meant to keep these little ones, but they're so sweet we couldn't bring ourselves to give them up initially. Now we kinda have to.

Their names are Nibbler (the male) and Leela (the female). They were born together, they were rescued together, and they're inseparable friends and playmates now, so we have to adopt them out as a pair. They are absolutely adorable and very social (though they may take some time to get used to you). I really wish I didn't have to part with them, but such is life. If anyone here on /r/charlotte is willing to give these little ones a good home it would be greatly appreciated. 

Here's an small album of them. http://imgur.com/a/JAbO6. I can supply more pictures or information upon request. I have a dog, and the kittens get along with her swimmingly. They're both fixed and up to date on their shots. I'm giving them away for free and will include a food bowl, a water bowl, a covered litter box, and a few of their toys. Thanks."	t5_2qo2j	True

I teach 10th grade English at Garinger High School, which as some of you may know is a Title I school, meaning most of my students live at or below the poverty line. My kids are ferociously smart, but the biggest hurdle I face is that they HATE reading and avoid it at all costs, so most of them are a year (or two, or more) below grade level. 

There's a lot of research indicating that independently reading books that you actually like does amazing things for you academically (imagine that!), and that's something I strive to build into my class as much as possible. My classroom library, however, is modest at best, and I would be forever grateful if you would help me bulk it up with books that are cluttering your shelves!

I will take pretty much anything with a reading level above the sixth grade and below, say, a college philosophy text, and will happily come pick them up at a time that is convenient for you.

I actually have no problem talking to strangers, but breaking the ice is awkward for me. I mean I'm a redditor so isn't it basically law that I have some SAP in me?

Anyways, has anyone else moved here and didn't know anyone? What did you do to get plugged in? I'm not saying that I've made great effort into meeting folks, but I struggle with the fact that I can't find ""my kind of people."" I moved from Atlanta and I had established a pretty incredible group of friends. I'm not ""hood"" or anything, but why do I get weird looks when I wear my fitted hats? Why don't I hear any of the bars playing any other kind of music than top 40's? Is it just that type of town? Is there some counterculture that I'm missing out on? 

I also work a ridiculous amount and I love my job, so I may have not been putting in the work that's required for meeting people, but I don't even know where to start...

Forgive the stream of consciousness, but I've just been thinking more about it lately. 

**TL:DR  I just moved to Charlotte in December, where are the cool people?**

Screen repairs are normally $100, mention reddit and I'll take care of you for $70. My name is Alex, thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the positive reception, you guys are awesome! A few additional things I should have mentioned:

- I am located near UNCC but am mobile as well! I will come to your residence / work / local coffee shop and fix your device while you wait.

- I do repair other electronics (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) but I typically have to schedule those a few days out (I order parts as needed for those). PM me with any questions!

- If you have an issue that is not a cracked screen (button, speaker, etc), you may want to take it to apple and see if they'll take care of you under a warranty repair (even if you're out of yours).

Ahem, so I own a new house that I've been living in a little over a year, one of my roommates is moving out May 10th so I'd like to find someone to move into that space.  Decently large room, you would have access to over 2000 square feet of space, very large backyard, front load washer/dryer set, open garage space (that I plan to move some stuff out of to start working out in), large kitchen etc.~~


~~Neighborhood is quiet and I live near the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater so if you are outside in a lawn chair you can hear the concerts during the summer.  Both my neighbors are awesome, friendly and most likely going to barbecue with them this summer.~~


~~I'm not looking for someone wanting to have parties all the time, loud, having tons of people over all the time.  Two guys one in late 20's and I just turned 30 that works a bit of the time and both fairly quiet.  One that has a small child that's here about half the month but well mannered and doesn't cause a ruckus.~~  


~~Preferably someone needing arrangements for at least six months or more, I don't increase rent or anything, it stays consistent.  Utilities are cheap with the front load washer and dryer, plus neither of us here are energy hogs.~~  


~~No age or gender preference, I've lived with plenty of men/women before and no real issues.~~


~~Let me know what you think, I'm even able to work with you on when you are able to move in and such. PM me with more details, figured I'd hit up Char Redditors before I go word of mouth.~~  


~~Also I actually have a smaller room and larger room, I'm not going to do anything with that other room for a bit so if you'd like to utilize both rooms for space arrangements can be made.~~  


~~For students needing a place to crash for the summer I wouldn't mind renting out the smaller room for the summer, furnishing can be arranged.~~ 


~~For those not familiar with Charlotte its North East Charlotte at border of Concord and Harrisburg.   About 25min-30min from everything, can get to ""uptown"" in about 25min.~~
~~Hit me up!~~



~~tl;dr One or two rooms to rent out of a 2k square feet house in a nice neighborhood in NE Charlotte~~

~~Edit: My other roommate decided to utilize the smaller room~~

**Edit: It's done, someone has grabbed the room. I truly do appreciate the efforts of those that gave me upvotes and commented to bring it up higher in r/charlotte. Thank you!!!**"	t5_2qo2j	True

For now it is a separation but I honestly don't know what it means. After being with her for eight years I am coming to the realization I don't have a single friend or group of people I know that is not a couple friend or someone that is tied in with the X. At first I was depressed sad and all that garbage that comes with this kinda crap. But now I just want to go out and meet new people. I am 26 years old, Live in the university area.I am only looking for friendships and people I can talk to. I am fair game for almost anything. I am just looking for a group of really good people, people that know how to have fun and are willing to basically let a stranger hang out with em. I am a real cool guy. Hell I am a redditor right? Honestly I am a little depressed right now. My whole entire life and everything up to this point revolved around her. And now I only have to think about me. At one point I could call 30 people on a given night and have something to do all the time. Now I am the strait representation of the forever alone meme. I probably won't get any responses but if there are any kind souls out there that want a goofy cool guy that is game for almost anything please send me a message or comment, I feel like a complete idiot for posting here like this. But right now I just don't know where to begin. I have lived in Charlotte for 20+ years and I know there are great people out there please let me know where the meet-ups are and what is going on these days, I need to get out of this bubble of my life and move on. 

*Edit to clarify

 Wow what a response. I am really impressed by this group and want to thank you guys/gals for all the suggestions. I will be going to the trivia night @ Kennedys Wed. night. I hope to meat some of you and have great time. (that and i kick ass at trivia) also I am going to check out picassos as well on Tuesday night. Also I will look into this Disc Golf thing, I have always wanted to play it just never really tried. I enjoy reg golf on occasions but never really got into it like I wanted to. Hopefully I will see some of you at these 2 events. I will be the tall  guy asking random people if they are from the internet LOL on Tuesday and Wed. night.

Us: Two young male professionals (29, and 27 y/o) and two dogs.

House: Yes, a house, not an apartment, with ample room for not only the two of us and the dogs, but also you and ALL your stuff. There is a master suite with it's own bathroom, and also two smaller bedrooms that share a full bath. There is a full front and backyard, plus a garage which can hold any random stuff you may have. Washer and dryer, washing machine, etc. Again, it may sound like a lot to have two guys, two dogs, and yourself, but I promise we have more room than we need.

You: As long as you pay your bills on time, I'm not too worried about anything else.

When: Looking for someone to move in in October.

Hou Much: You have two choices, you can either take the master suite, or one of the secondary bedrooms, the master suite being a bit more expensive, obviously. We would ask for rent, plus we can negotiate either a flat fee for utilities, or we can split them three ways, your choice. Either way, you'd be looking at anywhere from $650-$750 a month.

I'm Dan, and I run the league. We have a series of Reddit teams in the Washington, DC area called ""Suck It Trebek"" (**[Source 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLx96hsA08)**, **[Source 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQMomgdOgBM)**, **[Source 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8Qqu_WBIc)**) - and it'd be great to keep the tradition in other cities!

I asked the mods if I could post this here, and they were great about it, so please feel free to ask me any questions you might have. If you're interested in captaining a team, PM me, as captains play for free and you won't need to buy the LivingSocial deal.

NAKID offers recreations sports leagues, such as kickball, dodgeball, volleyball and flag football, coupled with a variety of social events, like free parties, free movie screenings, bar crawls, scavenger hunts, happy hours and more. Just to avoid any confusion, we play fully clothed. :)  NAKID stands for ""**N**o, **A**dult **K**ickball **I**sn't **D**umb"".

**Edit**: We have one league that plays on Sundays (2pm or 3pm each week) and another that plays on Thursdays (6:30pm or 7:30pm each week). All games will be at Bryant Neighborhood Park near Uptown ([see Google Map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bryant+Neighborhood+Park,+West+Morehead+Street,+Charlotte,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=38.880816,-77.102156&amp;sspn=0.210601,0.242043&amp;oq=bryant+neigh&amp;hq=Bryant+Neighborhood+Park,+West+Morehead+Street,+Charlotte,+NC&amp;t=m&amp;z=17)).

I have a small dog, not really looking to add anymore pets, but it can definetly be discussed, my dog likes girl dogs and  cats,hes not so sure about boy dogs.
We'd have to share a bathroom. The downstairs is pretty furnished and I'll be adding some better stuff. There is not a lot of storage in the house if any. But its a newly renovated unit, I am the first person to move in since the gutted the entire unit. There are wood floors downstairs and up the stairs, and upstirs hallway, bedrooms are carpet...there is washer and dryer also.
So I am asking 350 + deposit of 350. I will pay for cable internet at no cost to you , I will be asking for half of the electric and water. In the Winter there will be gas as well I believe.

Looking for some one who is flexable and easy going.  I dont want a bunch of people over all the time, I hang out maybe once a week with some girl friends downstairs , but other the that is doesnt get to exciting around the house.

Amelie's: I basically live there. I mean, honestly, I live less-than-a-short-distance-that-is-ambiguous-enough-so-you-can't-stalk-me from there. You know it's good, even if you've never been there. Chocolate, soup, baguettes, whatever. Eat this shit now.

The Liberty: Not exactly a ""best kept secret"" sort of place, but I regularly run into people who have never heard of it. Very gastropub with updated classics like pork-belly sliders and probably the best burger I've ever had. Seasonal menu takes itself seriously, but not too seriously. Great beer selection, and they'll pair beer to food.

LuLu: In the month or so I've been reading r/Charlotte, I've seen LuLu mentioned probably 5 times. Great French/Italian, nice staff, cozy atmosphere. Decent price for the level of cuisine. Heard good things about brunch, never had it. Seasonal menu. Duck and smoked eggplant lasagna are great.

Hickory House: Hickory House? What's that? Never heard of it? Bitches, please. I had driven past probably 50-60 times without giving it a second thought. It's on North Tryon, a bit before the split with University City, and it's a windowless box. Seriously. No windows. It's also fucking OLD. The decor is literally various wood cutting implements, and small cover wagons over the wall sconces. But who fucking cares, there's a fireplace the size of a Volkswagen dumping delicious hickory smell into your nose and onto the fabulous meat. Fucking god, all the time I wasted at Mac's.

Speaking of old ass dives, have you been to Brook's? It's on Brevard, BEHIND the Highland Mill apartment building. It's literally a shack. Like, so small they use a semi-trailer to store things. Won best ""old school"" burger in Charlotte. Elusive for 2 reasons: only open from 7 - 2 on weekdays, and only takes cash. Seriously, I lived across the street from it for 3 years and only ate there twice during that time.

Dim Sum: On Central. Good, relatively authentic Chinese in general, but as the name would imply, fabulous Dim Sum on Sundays. For the uninitiated, Dim Sum is like Chinese Tapas that comes on a steamer cart and you eat until you either shit your pants or start to hallucinate.

Lang Van: Last one, I promise. I didn't even like Vietnamese food before coming here. It's on Shamrock, just past Eastway. Nicest people ever. Good food, fast, cheap. Great pho. After going there, I found out that more than half of my coworkers went there regularly... they just assumed I knew.

Plus, any of your Charlotteians are super welcome to come too! Come on Reddit, I know we can do this! Let's show that there's more to Gaston County than the fundies and teahadists!

PFLAG (Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) will be hosting the event next Thursday (a week from today), June 21st. It will be from 7:00pm until 9:00pm in the Center City Park, which is the small park downtown on Main Avenue, near Freeman's Pub. The one with the big metal tree. I can give more specific directions to anyone who doesn't know the spot.

I propose a Reddit bomb of this event, followed by drinks at Freeman's Pub afterwards. It should be a fun night, a night of hope instead of depression about how backwards our county can be. I think we all need this! 

Post here if you're interested in coming. I think we should be able to set up carpools for those of you who want to come but don't have transportation.

1366899338.0	1d30d4	For Those Looking for Rentals	shezbot	22	5	10	"Hi! I've had a few people send me personal messages regarding help for rental properties. If you are looking for something outside of an apartment complex in the Charlotte area, you need to be aware that most rentals are moving very quickly. Real estate as a whole is moving very quickly in Charlotte as we have a shortage of properties on the market (Currently we have about 15,000 properties listed for over 1 Million residents). It is very much a Seller's market again.

That said, if you are looking for a rental, you need to move QUICKLY if you see something you like. I had a friend looking last fall and it took her 2 months to find something. Once she did, it would be gone. Luckily, I found her a property and she moved on it that day, got it rented the next day and she has been happy. 

So, rental resources.

Use Zillow. It is your friend.
Use www.mapliv.com.  We use both of these sites when we are looking for comparable rents so we know how much to adjust our rental rates when it's time to renew leases.

If you want some help, shoot me a PM and I can search the MLS for you and let you know what I find. Please let me know the area you are looking in, your maximum rent, the number of bedrooms/baths and if you have pets. 

Also, for those in the Plaza Midwood area or those looking to move there, we will have a rental available in June on Thomas Ave. I don't yet know the rental amount but probably close to $1800-$2000/month. It's a 3 bedroom, 2 bath home, 1848 square feet.

I have always thought they had some of the best bbq around and they are a real bbq place with smokers in the back pouring smoke out.  My wife mentioned that she read some reviews and people said they had a really good burger. Tonight we decided to try. My wife got the large single burger and I got the [Large Double Cheese burger](http://i.imgur.com/2julVPO.jpg) the picture doesn't do justice to the actual enormity of it. I have never done any eating challenges but this was the first burger that I could only eat half of and take the rest home in my entire life. As for the taste it was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious! For only $5.99 it was certainly worth the drive. My wife and I have been getting our hair cut in Gastonia for over 20 years and Kyle Fletchers has been one of our favorite places to eat at when we do.

She's a huge cuddler, loves sleeping in the bed with us. Purrs CONSTANTLY. Will usually come greet you at the door. Please take her. &lt;3

Now, let me tell you the story of Tupac. 

Last year we lived in Columbia and noticed this cat that was laying around. She'd let us pet and hold her, purring the entire time. After a while we decided to take her to the vet because she had a bite mark on her tail. She kind of just never left our house after that.

I've got 2 other cats that were there before her. After months of trying to integrate them and discourage fighting, she just will NOT get along with Cat #1. (She ignores Cat #2.) I think it is in her best interest if she was an only cat.

You've gotta understand, I love this cat more than anything. I'm going to cry my eyes out when someone takes her. I'm turning to Reddit because generally you're all great folks and she really needs to be in an environment where she doesn't feel the need to fight her way to the top.

I'll give her to you for free. Along with her favorite toy.

I'm updating her vaccines on Monday so she'll be covered for the next year. We feed our kitties Halo Chicken (http://shop.halopets.com/Dry-Cat-Food-Indoor/Spots-Stew-Cat-Indoor-Chicken-11-5-lb) and use Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Clumping Litter (http://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Essentials-Clumping-10-5-Pounds/dp/B001FK61BQ). 

Of course I won't expect whomever picks her up to continue (it can be pricey) but that's what she's used to.

Pics of her: https://imgur.com/a/EUVn4

Edit: Oh yeah - I meant to say she's spayed and FIV negative. We live in Pineville, I'll bring her to you (along with her carrier which you get to keep) provided you're not 2 hours away, haha."	t5_2qo2j	True

Even when I went to NYC six monts later, I didn't like it as much as I loved this city and its people. 
So I wanted to sincerely thank all of you for making me live the best moments of my life. I think about it everyday, and I miss it a lot. Someday, I'll go back and I'll stay.

Some friends and I are going to be playing Ultimate this Sunday at Colonel Francis Beatty Park in the Matthews/Weddington area at 2:30. We'd love for you guys/ladies to come out. Please bring water (though there is a fountain) to prevent the dehydration and the death. On the off chance that the place we are trying to play (one of the soccer fields), is occupied, we can look around for a free field or try and hit up some volleyball. Id love to see you friends out there and to meet some of you finally. I will be in bright yellow short shorts, and will most likely be shirtless. Also, ladies will be provided, though you'll have to talk to them yourself.

We are having a board game meetup on 2/7/12.  Details can be [found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/p7c1f/okay_now_board_game_night_tuesday_feb_7th/)  [Send a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=duketime) to receive the address.  It will start around 7 PM.

Details can be [found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/ox7vu/meetup_fri_feb_10th_noda_bar_crawl/)  The plan is to meet at [Solstice on the back patio.](http://solsticetavern.com/)  There will be a Reddit alien to look for.  If it is cold/raining, then we may be located on the inside.

There is also a [William Davies Park](http://www.bringfido.com/attraction/695/) meetup that is pending.

There is a weekly recurring meetup that changes locations.  Be sure to check [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/ovimi/saturday_eat_up_or_meet_up_at_intermezzo_pizzeria/) for any details.  The meetup is every Saturday at a locally owned restaurant.

The last one takes place at [Kennedy's](http://www.kennedyscharlotte.com/) for trivia each Wednesday.  You should always be on the lookout for a reminder thread [such as this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/owknw/dont_forget_about_trivia_tonight/).  There are free shots to be won each week.

If I've forgotten about any or overlooked one, be sure to let me know and I'll add it to the list.  Also be sure to check the meetup box in the upper right hand corner of the page.

EDIT: I have a few more to post!  [Josh Carter](http://www.reverbnation.com/jc803music) will be playing at the [Smalls on Elizabeth Avenue](http://www.yelp.com/biz/smalls-charlotte) on 2/10/12.

Husband and I moved to Charlotte this summer, with our two kids and dog in tow. We have no friends or family here. We'd like to hang out with people and well, lets see...there really is no way to word this and not sound lonely and sad is there...have friends. I'm not lonely or sad, so much as having people to hang out with is awesome and fun.

I've managed to miss all the meetups, oops, going to try and make it out to one soon.

General info: In our early 30's, husband is a computer dude, maker, star wars fan, rocks at being a dad, and isn't all that excited to work for the man but he deals. I'm a hobbyist photographer, who will be back in school in the spring, art nerd-not so much crafty, don't have an out of the house job so I can wrangle children and save some moola till I finish getting my degree. Husband and I aren't super alike, but we both enjoy anything that is funny and smart, or toilet humor whichever is available. We love our kids, but know they aren't human trophies. 

TL;DR: Parents need friends, too. 

EDIT: You guys are awesome! I'm impressed by the warm welcome, fantastic information and response to this. I'm running around doing stuff like a boss today, but I'll sit down later and respond.

2 - What are the best real estate companies to contact for preliminary market information for renting and/or buying homes in Charlotte and possibly Concord?

P.s., thank you all for all the recommendations and information you provided me.

I have a sweet two bedroom, 1 bath apartment in NoDa that is missing one other awesome person to live in it. It is an upstairs unit in a new duplex with a shared entry. The bathroom has Jack and Jill sinks, and a jacuzzi tub. The bedrooms are on opposite sides of the unit, and there is lots of closet and storage space. Your room could be furnished, or not. The rent is $600 a month, and includes heat, water, trash, electric, basic cable, wifi, and a security system. There is no washer and dryer, and no dishwasher. 

About me: I'm 34, work part time locally, and do some part time consulting from home. I'm also in grad school, and spend the rest of my time studying. I have friends over about once a week, but all we do is cook dinner, have a drink, and talk. I go out a couple of nights as well. I enjoy listening to records, and making art, but these days I'm mostly studying. Also, I have no TV, and do not want one in shared space. Don't worry, your room is already wired for cable. I keep my house clean, but may leave dishes overnight when I'm too full and sleepy from dinner.

About you: I'm looking for someone who is laid back, respectful, and also generally quiet. Since I work and study from home, a 9-5er is preferred. However, I don't want an awkward situation where we can't be friends, drink some wine and talk smack about the world. I just know that I need a bit of space to take care of my business. Oh yeah, you also have to be able to pay rent on time, every time.

PM me if you are interested, or know someone who might be. No jerks please. I can start showing the apartment tomorrow night, or after 7/1 when I'm back in town.

And yeah, throwaway- I like to keep some things private.

So I put an event up for this Saturday, May the 18th at around 11am. We'll hike a trail up to the top of Crowders Mountain.

Info:
A hike to the top of Crowder's Mountain for a lovely picnic and view on what will hopefully be a nice sunny day.

We'll meet at the picnic tables of the Linwood Road Access area. From there we'll take the Tower Trail (about 1.25 miles) up to the overlook, we'll hopefully relax and have a good ol' time.


DIRECTIONS:

Take I-85 South to Gastonia and get off at exit 13 - Edgewood Road. Take a left and follow until the the road becomes Archie Whitesides Rd. When you come to a road en, take the left onto Linwood Road an you'll see the entrance then on your right.

Confused? 
[Here is a map to the area where we'll meetup](http://i.imgur.com/BjBXOJU.jpg)

Remember to wear comfy shoes. And don't forget your shades, sunscreen, and water. The trail is pretty smooth.

Have a pooch that loves the outdoors!? Well bring em. The trail and park are pooch friendly, but remember to keep em leashed, and have your poopy bags ready.

Keep Charlotte Boring, which I'll just call KCB for the sake of brevity, was started by a friend of mine back in 2011.  Since Charlotte has (or at least HAD) a bit of a reputation of being bland compared to some other big cities, the name was chosen ironically.  We actually don't want to keep Charlotte boring at all; we just thought it sounded catchy.  In a nutshell, this is who we are:

We're heavily focused on people and smaller businesses, getting to know the people that are at the heart of this community, and finding out the passion that drives them to do what they do here in the Queen City and in the surrounding areas.  It's easy to feel a disconnect from others in a busy world, especially in a busy, growing city like Charlotte.  Essentially, we want to remind people that those connections are still there, and behind all of the goods and services we provide, we're all humans that rely on each other.

We have a style that you would be likely to see from Creative Loafing, but we try to write from the heart and do our best to avoid sounding too sterile.  We tend to post links from external sources with some of our own commentary included.  We also hope to post photos of what we encounter around town, and we like asking poll questions to see what fans are thinking.

We're working day and night to get our website live, and we're also planning out a t-shirt presale.  Currently, however, we're doing almost all of our work out of our Facebook page, and as I've just received access to the KCB Twitter account, that'll be underway soon.

I'm very thankful to have received mod approval to get on my little soapbox here.  If anyone is interested in what we stand for, wants to join our team, or just wants to see some examples, like us at http://www.facebook.com/keepcharlotteboring.  If you want to ask me a question, comment on what we're doing, or want to suggest a place we should check out, let me know!  I'm available through here, PM, or you can follow us at the Twitter name @keepcltboring.

Thanks for your time, everyone!  I'm extremely excited about this project.  Hope to talk to you soon!

*Edited for typo corrections.

*Edit 2:  We want to talk to ents and get everything straightened out. For now, we've unpublished our Facebook page. Once everything is square, we'll continue from there. We're still going through with our plans, but we may be making some changes if necessary. We've also taken your suggestions into consideration, so we'd like to say 'thank you' for providing us with feedback. We will continue to update as new information is available. Again, thanks for everyone's feedback, and for your understanding. --hirnrissig"	t5_2qo2j	True

It's cool here, we have a really nice, completely furnished place, with utilities included in price, and we each pay $750. Hardwood floors, incredible grill, 2 patios, and a really relaxing, clean area. We'll trade off using the garage we share every week.

I'm 25, and it'd be nice to get someone about the same. I'm not super loud, no smoking, and I do enjoy some craft beer or wine on the weekends.

I almost nailed down to one apartment in South (Century Parkside Apartments, Candler Lane, Charlotte, NC) and one in North (Ashford Green, Barton Creek Dr, Charlotte, NC, pretty close to University area).

I work in Uptown (South College Street) and wondering which is a better place to stay? 
I want to keep the commute time as less as possible and defintely less than one hour.

I really appreciate your help. If you have any suggestions on apartments that is golden. :)

EDIT: Thanks a lot for all the replies guys. After considering all the things, I have decided to stay in South Charlotte. I have to take a shared accomodation and the only option I got from North Charlotte is close to University, which almost all of you said a boring place.

We're 40ish overweight nerds, gamers. I'm not looking to go rock climbing or anything like that. Maybe a cheap/free concert, Shakespeare in the Park, or some kind of festival or event. We don't have kids; we're just big kids ourselves.

Also, we're interested in making some friends locally. We moved here for a new job for my wife, so we don't know anyone in the area. We're into computers, Rock Band (I've got a 360 in storage until the movers deliver our stuff in a week or so), reading, sci fi and action movies, maybe some board gaming (but nothing insane like Diplomacy) and tabletop RPGs (although I'm basically a newb at that.)

So I'm looking to help organize one, but my apartment is too small to have a ""get-together"" of any more than about 5 people.

Would anybody be willing to ""host"" a MTG meetup at their place? It would either be this coming weekend or next (I'm only in town Thursday - Sunday). All you really need is a living room and a table (parking is preferred, too). We shouldn't be too rowdy...

Even if you don't play, but are curious, I can bring a bunch of decks (I have around 5-6 casual decks, but enough cards to make more) and am always willing to teach the game to newbies.

My name is Sol, and I've recently had the wonderful opportunity to host a slam poetry performance show on July 28th (The last Saturday in July). Me, an amateur spoken word poet from right here in Charlotte, Shane Manier from Kannapolis (Head Slam Poet of the NC Poetry Council), and Austin Garrido from Gastonia will be performing explosive poems from 7-9. 

We all have plenty of stage experience, but this is my first independent show, so I'd exetremely honored to have redditors come by and check it out!

It will be at Mugs Coffee Shop on Park Road, located next to the Harris Teeter (first left after the light for Selwyn).

I'll post a reminder closer to the event, but wanted to plant the seed now.

If you want to check out some of my work, I post a lot of my poems (mostly in written form) to solspoetry.tumblr.com
[**EDIT: Just wanted to clarify that there are no ads on my blog and I do not get any revenue from it**]

YouTube search Shane Manier to hear a few of her poems. 

It's going to be a good time, with great coffee, and greater poetry. 

--The event will have some harsh language and themes, but will be pretty tame if you want to bring kids. I'd rate it PG-13--

--EDIT2: I left this out, but the show is FREE. You are encouraged to drink coffee or buy a coffee cake, but the poets and all involved are doing this for free--"	t5_2qo2j	True

Thank you everyone for offering help and advice. I've gotten a membership at a local gym and am using the showers there. Also, I now have my student ID and can use on-campus facilities as well.

--------------------------------
Hello.

I'm an incoming UNC student looking for work and housing. I'll be able to secure housing once I get financial aid, and I have enough cash on hand for the first week of classes (19th-23rd) in a hotel.

However, I'm in town currently while I'm looking for work and would like to be able to get a shower early (5am-ish) tomorrow and friday mornings so that I'm presentable for interviews, cold calls, etc.

I'd like to avoid men's shelters, as I'd feel badly about taking up resources meant for the homeless.

Anyways, anyone know of any free-inexpensive bathing options? Even an inexpensive gym membership would do, if they were open early enough.

EDIT: Aww, you guys.

Thanks for offers of food and hospitality, but I really just need a place to drag a rag across my ass once a day. I wound up signing up with planet fitness.

I've lived all over the east coast and NEVER have I lived somewhere where the income gap is so huge, and the neighborhoods are so gentrified and segregated. Me and my girlfriend both make a lower middle class income, and we cannot find one place to live where we feel safe, OR don't have to spend every penny we own on rent.

Your ""cool"" neighborhoods like NODA are a fucking joke. It makes me sick how these neighborhoods, attempting to be ""cool"" contribute to the awful thin line between the rich and the poor in CLT. There is no middle class here.

And the city, unless you enjoy getting blackout drunk, or watching sports there is nothing to do. (I don't drink, and don't enjoy sports) 

The highways are terrible and everyday I sit in standstill traffic on 485. I remember before I moved here, I used to love to go cycling around the city. Not here. The roads were designed for rich, over privileged bankers to move the minorities to ghettos, and create a horrible city for the have and have-nots.

I can't wait to get downvoted. I just wish I knew all this all this before I moved to this dump.

This is my husband's birthday weekend, and I'm thinking of getting us tickets. Has anyone been? I'm apprehensive after going to a similar event nearby that was poorly planned/organized and ended in disaster. I want his birthday to be awesome! 

Any input appreciated.

Edited to add: Also considering Beer Bourbon and BBQ, set for the same day at Southpark (http://www.beerandbourbon.com/north-carolina/show-info). Because if there's anything my husband likes better than beer, it's pork and liquor and beer, and we would prefer to stay uptown anyway.

I'm just getting information tonight and asking those interested to interview to meet up another time to shoot it hopefully in the next couple of weeks.  If you've got insightful feedback and can't make it out tonight that will work as well.

PM me if you are interested, although I am working like 9pm-8pm today so I will try to answer questions when I am able.  Those interested come on out and thank you in advance!

Thus, my wife and I would like to see if any /r/Charlotteans would be interested in ~~indoctrination~~ playing.

I'm talking about starting with games like Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne* but more (as per footnote) Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, Stone Age, or (shudder) Small World. If it catches on, obviously we can mix it up into some heavier territory. Of course, folks already into gaming are welcome as well (and less to teach!).

Most likely, though, my wife and I will be teaching, so that sort of limits the size of the group (I'd like to play and not just showrun, of course). Some options I've explored are the Caribou Coffee on Park Road, as they're not often busy and have a big room to use. Only thing is you need to pay $35 per hour (on coffee and pastries and such), and for smaller turnouts that may be hard to meet. For smaller groups (say, up to six) we'd be cool hosting, if you're cool coming by. Prior game night was on Tuesday, and weeknights seem to be unintrusive, but weekends would be cool also if it catches and we've got some folks interested in marathon sessions.

My wife and I are about 30 (well, no ""abouts"" about it regarding myself), like longs walks on the beach, and also haven't ever really done this before.

He was one of the legends of motorsport... truly one of the best that ever lived, until he was killed in a wreck at Imola in 1994.  It came out last year in England, and was scheduled for a very limited release here in America.  Someone at Cars &amp; Coffee today was handing out flyers for it, having set up his own special screening here where we weren't one of the selected ""limited release"" cities.

The premiere is August 30th, starting at 6pm with the movie scheduled to start around 8.  There will be some various NASCAR/Indycar/Grand-Am/ALMS drivers there signing autographs.  Riley Technologies is supposed to bring out a few DP cars to show off in the parking lot.  They're working on getting a few other race teams to come show off their cars.  After that, it will run throughout the day Friday Sept 2-Sunday Sept 4th without all the hoopla surrounding it.  More information is available on their Facebook page:

If you haven't heard of this place, you got to [check it out](http://www.mynoda.org/2011/05/the-chop-shop-opens-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks/).

The are two more bands on the bill:  The Feral and Jupiter Tide.  Both are really good, some of the best local hard rock bands in the Charlotte area.  The price of admission is $4, doors open at 8:00pm.  The first band should go on about 9:30pm, we will be playing around 11:30pm.  

If anyone comes out, please find me and say hey.  I will be the guitar player with short hair.

HitLikeAGirl	12	1	16	"I've been scouring through tons of photography websites in the Charlotte area, but have yet to find something that works. Most wedding photographers are charging $2,000 and up, which is just not do-able for my fiance and I.

I'd like to spend around $500 - $700 for our wedding photos. I am perfectly fine with student/up-and-coming photographers, as long as the picture quality is decent. Our wedding will be held Sunday, December 15th.

Time is running out and I'm in a frenzy. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Edit: Holy cow, I am so appreciative for everyone's offers of help. I chose someone thanks to this thread that is well within my budget. I thought it'd be a long shot to post here, but it ended up being the best move I've made in my search so far! I hope this thread helps any future couples looking for a cost-effective photographer.

I've been living here for just over a year. I work full-time at a restaurant uptown and will be starting school part-time in June. Ideally I would need someone by the first of April, but I could make it work if you can't move in until later. I had a friend I thought was going to move in but it did not work out with her.

The condo is a 900 sq. ft. 2-story unit in a row of attached townhome-style units, with a huge front porch. It's off of Randolph Rd., walking distance to Kennedy's/Jackalope Jack's, Presbyterian Hospital, CPCC and about 2 miles from Uptown. I have a full kitchen with a washer and dryer, a mostly furnished living room (but there's room for more furniture) and the bedrooms have big closets. The one downside is that there is no dishwasher, but I don't cook much so it doesn't bother me. I am very clean and pretty low-key and easygoing. I don't have pets and I don't smoke. I don't have pictures of the condo now but I'd be happy to take some.

The rent is $363 each, plus utilities (gas, water, electric, internet) which are usually between $50-$80 each per month. I would prefer another female, no kids. I dont smoke but I dont mind if you do. Pets require an additional deposit.

Message me if you're interested or have any questions.

I travel a lot more often now and they are unjustly taking on the burden of the situation. They have been forced to stay at home alone for weeks at a time (with a visitor to check on them, etc.) or be boarded for long periods.  

I know the situation is incredibly unfair to them but I am also unwilling to give up my livelihood for the sake of being home. As the situation has become more difficult on them in the recent year, I am really hoping to find a good home for the both of them.

All that said, they are very suitable for a family or someone wanting indoor only cuddly karma machines. They are incredibly well behaved and do not have their front claws. They also both know their names very well.

Tigger is a regular Lassie if the food bowl is empty and will always help you find your way to it (they are trained for free feeding) and Trinity will perform ""drive by"" self pets (all you have to do is hang down your hand, she does the rest).

The linked picture is a flyer that my sister made on my behalf that I will start posting. She would take them but she and her recently married husband already have 5 large dogs between the two of them. I have had multiple friends/family members interested but they have all had major legitimate reasons for not being able to take them.

Please, if you or anyone you know of someone who may be a good home for these two, contact me here for more information.

I'm moving to Charlotte from Baltimore in a little under a month from now.  I'll be working in Lancaster, SC, but I wanted to live in Charlotte because, well, there's not a whole lot to do down in Lancaster.  Anyway, I have a few questions for everyone!

Being from Baltimore, MD, I'm quite fond of my seafood.. where would be the best place for seafood be in Charlotte?  Up here in MD, you can find it on every street corner, with steamed blue crabs being the staple, but steamed shrimp, fresh scallops, raw oysters, and everything else in between is also really popular.

Also, I'm well aware that Charlotte is Panther town.  However.. are there any bars which will cater to fans of a black bird we call the Raven around here?  I saw a horrifyingly black and yellow car sporting Steelers logo the first time I came to town in June (Us Raven fans don't really like the Steelers), so I'm sure every team has a contingent of fans somewhere in the city.

And finally, where do the cool people (redditors) in Ballantyne hang out for a drink after a long day at work?"	t5_2qo2j	True

[With LAN support on the horizon for Minecraft](https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/212932831540822019), I was wondering if there are any fellow Charlotteans that would be interested in a Minecraft houseparty / meetup in the future?

If we have a sizeable group we could do all sorts of things, such as group building projects, co-op enderdragon slaying, or we could even fight it out ""hunger games"" style in [Ultra-Hardcore mode](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1008473-125-xxxhardcorexxx-mod/). The potential for awesomeness is quite high!

Is there anyone who would be interested in this sort of Meetup?

**Update:**
Wow, we seem to have quite a lot of people interested! Let's follow the 1.3 updates regarding LAN support closely over the next few weeks and see what gets implemented.

At the end of October, we two young folks will be embarking on a two-week whirlwind of a roadtrip. Aye, but here's the rub: we're broke! We can cover the car and all, and food and beers and whatnot, no problem. But hotels? Not so much. So we ask of you this: anybody wanna put up a couple of big-dreamin' road travellers?

**A little about us:**

We are two twentysomething kids, creative types, living in New York City (No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn). He's a musician and works in radio. She's a line cook. We love beers, live music, cats and dogs and birds and frogs. We don't ask for much: just a couch or a floor, or even a yard in which to pitch a tent (literally speaking, folks). We're well-mannered and housetrained. If you're up for it, we'd love to see your city from your point of view. Play the tour guide!

**What we can do for you:**

In exchange for your hospitality, we can offer a private-chef-style meal, getcha good and drunk, wash your windows, vacuum the curtains, whatever. We can also guarantee reciprocation: come crash at our place in Brooklyn, any ol' time you'd like!

We realize this is a couchsurfing kinda situation, and yeah, we're gonna do that too. We just thought we'd reach out to our fellow redditors first. We've never done this kind of thing, and reddit's yet to let us down.

We'll be in Charlotte on 11/10. If you can help us out, you'll score some real-life karma (and we will both go back and upvote every one of your posts ;D ).

China owns $1.1 trillion, while a lot, that's not most of our debt. I ignored and forgot the rest already but that part sticks out like a sore thumb to me. They only recently passed Japan but of course the Republicans didn't care then. They also own most of it because we hold a major trade deficit due to our free trade stance with them, if they didn't buy our debt we'd go broke faster and would actually look at manufacturing our own goods again, either that or force them to stop manipulating their currency by withdrawing from their market before their labor bubble burst.

http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt

I'm sure I'll pick the rest of it apart next time I see it. I'm also putting it here because I usually see it during the Channel 9 broadcast.

Just saw it again. Yeah our unemployment has been pretty high throughout most of the past decade, starting with major outsourcing. The Republican party is very pro-free trade which results in high unemployment for the US. It was somewhere around 9% in 2002. The high gas prices are caused by speculation on oil futures with no regulation (we can regulate like we do food stuffs if needed), besides the Republicans love big oil how are they going to be any better? Sorry for the rant, the commercial is just total BS. Sure Obama isn't doing a lot about it but it's due to the Democrats not being capable of lockstepping (pre-Republican house takeover) and the Republicans stalling anything proposed by Democrats (post-house takeover). They do not have our best interest in mind, you can see Sue Myrick's voting record for proof."	t5_2qo2j	True

I've been reading all of the threads on /r/Charlotte regarding moving and one theme that seems to occur often is the anti-hipster comments.  Let me first start by saying that I, myself am not a ""hipster"" and avoid living in ""hipster"" neighborhoods (Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Bushwick, etc...) because at times I do find their attitude annoying (especially the ""hipsters"" who are living off of their parents money).  I do, however, find myself multiple times/week hanging out in ""hipster"" neighborhoods because they have the best food, best dive bars, best coffee and generally the best entertainment (IMO).

To me - real ""hipsters"" are snobby in all the right areas, they love good coffee, an eclectic variety of food, cheap beer in dives or really good beer that doesn't cost $9/pint - also the types of bars - they have Barcade (a bar with 25 cent old school standup arcade games), Skeeball bars, a movie theater with food/booze, the best shows, free personal pizza with purchase of beer (Alligator Lounge), a cool old bowling alley with a great bar, etc...

I liken the ""hipster"" to the bee. If you have a large garden, you should also keep bees because they will help your garden flourish - yes, bees sting and fly around your face and are sometimes annoying, but without them, your garden would be more difficult to sustain and may not produce as high a quality of fruit/veggie/flower.

So - here's my question: Am I reading too far into certain comments from people on the internet just ranting about whatever comes to mind, or is there really a general disliking of ""hipsters"" from people who are from Charlotte or lived there for a long period of time?  This is legitimate curiosity, not meant to insult or condescend.

Currently, Charlotte is at the top of my ""move to"" cities and I'll probably be posting more annoying questions that have been asked a thousand times.

One of them is allergic to cats and the original plan was to keep her in my room all the time, but the more I think about it the more I am sure she is going to go insane.

She comes with lots of litter, food, food bowls, a fresh litter box, a carrier, is microchipped, and she is all caught up with her shots. Let me know if interested! She is 11 years old, mostly an indoor cat (we allow her to go outside, but she goes out for 5 minutes and wants back in). 

I have had her for years and so it is very important that she goes somewhere that she is going to be well taken care of. I hate to give her up at all, I couldn't stand the thought of her going somewhere where the owner wasn't interested in actually taking care of an animal.

1371486073.0	1giu2g	Hello /r/Charlotte! I'm looking for a Carolina BBQ recommendation.	bunka77	12	1	62	"I'm in town from Kansas City, and I want to compare some BBQ styles.  I keep hearing about your Carolina vinegar and/or mustard based BBQ, and I want to give it a try.  What's the best Carolina style restaurant in or near Charlotte?

I can get all the tomato based sauce I need in KC so I'm not really looking for that style, (Although, obviously, I feel it's superior.  KC BBQ is best BBQ.)  This week though, I want to try something new.

**EDIT: Kickin' Pig** 

Okay, we catered Kickin Pig BBQ from Rock Hill today for lunch.  Now I'm hesitant to be too critical because it was catered BBQ, and I got to lunch a little late so it was a bit cold when I got there.  I'm not going to count this as my Carolina BBQ experience, but I'll share my thoughts anyway.  We had copped pork, chicken, ribs (they were gone by the time I got down there) wings, baked beans, and *cole*slaw.  In fact there were two different types of *cole*slaw, but I'm not a big fan, so I didn't have any.

**Chopped Pork**-  I think this was eastern Carolina style as I didn't see or taste any mustard Carolina Gold sauce.  When I first saw it, I thought it was going to be really greasy, but that might just be the way vinegar sits on it, because it wasn't greasy at all.  It was cold (not their fault) but it was still good, and very moist.  It was difficult to suppress my instinct to pour ""sweet ketchup"" all over it, but I didn't.  All things considered, I enjoyed it.  Especially how moist it was.

**chicken wing**  These I did pour some ""sweet ketchup"" all over, and I have to say, this Kickin' Pigs place makes a very good BBQ sauce.  The hot and the sweet sauce were both very good (I think I preferred their hot BBQ sauce a bit more).  The chicken wings were a bit hard, and unlike the pork, it wasn't nearly as moist, but I'll chalk that up to it being cold...

**BBQ Baked Beans**  These kind of surprised me.  They were different than any baked beans I've had before.  I noticed they were sweeter, and they had slices of sweet onion in them.  Also, they were made with pinto *and* black beans.  I liked them a lot, too, and I was surprised that even sides were done differently here.  I'm sure there was more difference in the recipe than just sliced onions and black beans, but they really did taste a lot different than the beans we have in KC.  I don't think they were cooked as long, b/c the beans weren't mushy (like ours are) and the color wasn't quite as homogenized.  I also think we might add more pepper to our beans.  Anyway, I know this is about BBQ, and I just spent more time reviewing the baked beans, but I was just surprised they were so much different.  I wasn't expecting it.

**EDIT 2: 521 BBQ**

I just want to start by saying thanks to /r/charlotte for the responses, your recommendation (521 BBQ) was very good.  I ordered [A rib plate which comes with beans, fries, hush puppies and *cole*slaw (which I substituted out for onion rings, and I added a large chopped pork sandwich)](http://i.imgur.com/nwGkNDy.jpg).  I has very nerves all day about the vinegar BBQ sauce.  I wanted to keep an open minding, but I just couldn't imagine that I would like it.  When I got to 521 BBQ, and smelled the smoke, my fears subsided.  That is, until I got to the counter.  I asked for the rib plate, but first I wanted to clarify if it was a half slab of ribs.  When the cute young high school girl ringing me up confirmed the rib plate was a half slab, I asked if I could order on the long or short end.  She said, ""No, they're baby back ribs""... Suddenly my fears came rushing back.  But then almost immediately I felt like an asshole.  After all, I don't even really care if it's long or short end because they're both delicious, so I smiled and said I would also like the large chopped pork sandwich.

**Vinegar sauce**  I was really worried I was going to hate this... I put a little on my ""sandwich"" (I didn't eat any of the bun, just the chopped pork) and tried it.  It was really good.  I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it.  It helped make the meat more juicy, and brought out the smoke flavor at first, then finished with the spices in the sauce.

**Mustard sauce**  This is the one I was really excited to try, and it was everything I hoped it would be.  The ""original"" KC BBQ place, Arthur Bryant's, serves a [world famous sauce](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EEr7HJsBacI/RiN6DtXgINI/AAAAAAAAAr8/tKDd7q1NzMA/s320/Bryant+and+St+Peter.gif) which is technically vinegar based, but tastes pretty thick and mustard-y.  (KC's tomato based sauce tradition follows Ollie Gate's recipe from the *other* ""original"" KC BBQ join [Gate's BBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6CWOsRXee0&amp;t=45).)  Anyway, I put the mustard sauce on the rest of my chopped pork, and it was really good, too.  I still like my tomato based sauce, but I think I might have to order in some of your Carolina gold sauce when I get the cravings.

**Ribs** I'm going to start off saying I liked the ribs.  They were good ribs.  They had a thick pink smoke ring, and good flavor, they looked incredible, they were moist, the rub was great, and I detected a bit of sauce that was dabbed on in the last hour or smoking which mixed with the meats sweat and caramelized nicely around the outside.  I'll put them against any other rack of ribs I've eaten.  I want to get that out of the way, because I have some criticism, too.  For starters, they were very tender- but like *too* tender.  I wish they would have given up *just a bit* more fight coming off the bone (if ""the meat was *too* tender"" isn't a first world problem, then I don't know what the term even means).

The other issue I had was a bit more disconcerting, and I want to ask you guys if this is how ribs here are traditionally served.  After smoking the ribs, they threw them upside down on a charcoal grill for a couple minutes, which took parts of the deliciously caramelized sauce and charred it.  Every rib had a good bite and a half where I couldn't really get over the taste of burnt meat...  I think the whole thing would have been better if they just never made their way to the grill, and I got them right out of the pit.  Is that typical here?  Did they maybe just accidentally leave my rack on the grill a tad too long?  Again the ribs were good, but I just didn't understand the decision to grill them.

**Sides**  Really uneventful, nothing too special to talk about.  I don't think the crinkle cut fries or the onion rings were any different than what a fast food place might serve.  The beans and hush-puppies were okay, but nothing special.  But good sides are only a bonus, not really a deal breaker.

Again Charlotte, thank you for all the recommendations, and I really enjoyed my stay here!"	t5_2qo2j	True

Original summary: puppy was rejected by humane society.  I was afraid he'd be euthanized before I could get back to him.  But all turned out very well.  He's safe and officially adopted. 

Here are some pictures from the day I found him:

http://imgur.com/a/nNiOd

EDIT: And here's a week later:

http://imgur.com/a/mAmmz

~~I'm reaching out to Reddit after a dozen calls, voicemails, emails, and dead ends over the past two days.~~

~~Here's my goal:  make sure I can get a particular puppy before he's euthanized.~~

~~Background: I found him Sunday, in bad but not terrible shape.  Got him checked out and medicined up at my vet.  Then asked the humane society for help finding him a good a permanent home.  I'll take him if there's not one.  They said fine, but since he's found, he must go through Animal Control and their standard waiting period.  So against better judgment and with extreme regret I took him to Animal Control.~~

~~Problem: The Humane Society's vet passed on him because of a lazy eye.  One that was thoroughly checked out by my vet and might simply go away on its own.  Justification was that they're too short on resources to take dogs with something wrong with them.~~

~~Many calls and conversations later, it still didn't matter that I will be covering all medical and food costs, as well as sheltering him, making donations, and offsetting any volunteer hours with my own time.~~

~~So he's now at Animal control, and technically their property today.  While there are many notes in their system and voicemails on their supervisor boxes, I can't get in touch with anyone, and I'm worried he'll be euthanized or declared unadoptable before i physically can get there.~~

~~I would like to get in touch with someone, anyone, who can help me get through this red tape and find a way to get him back.  Any kind of cost or personal time commitment isn't a problem.  Do any of you have contacts at either organization?  Or advice on ways to get around it?~~"	t5_2qo2j	True

I'm definitely the city type and love going to nice restaurants, concerts, plays, art walks (which kind of scares me away from Wilmington). I had the chance to visit Wilmington and the UNCW campus back in October. I felt like the city was pretty small and not a whole lot to do. Most of the places I went (from the airport down Market to the campus and downtown) seemed pretty old and trashy. I didn't get a chance to visit Wrightsville Beach as I was only in the city for 3 hours or so. My overview was very limited by that time. I never got to go to Charlotte or visit the UNCC campus. My uncle, who lives in Charlotte, actually toured the campus and took pictures and sent them to me so I have a decent feel of what it is like.

The band isn't looking for a guarantee, a cut of the door, or anything like that - just a chance to get in front of new audiences and hopefully sell some merchandise.

It's a great group that has already been a featured performer at SXSW, played ACL Festival this past weekend, and has reached #1 for consecutive days with both of their first singles on the music blog aggregator Hype Machine. They're currently mixing their sophomore album, with many new tracks appearing on tour this coming month.

If you're interested in hosting the band around those dates, PM me and we can get you in touch and talk details. 

For your listening pleasure...

With a new moon staying out of the night sky and this brisk fall air slaying the urban haze, I had an extra-sweet time spying stars from Ballantyne last night. Say you can make it out to a quiet place in the net few nights. No lights in your face, a view of the horizon. Here's what there is to see in the heavens above. If this PSA is a hit, I'll take on the huge issues of viewing locations and urban light pollution in the next update.

UP ALL NIGHT?
Hanging out in the northeast at evening's start is the bright five-star ""W"" of queen Cassiopeia. If you were to stay up from 8 pm to 5 am, you would see it draw a circle counter-clockwise around the North Pole of the sky.

EARLY ON
Sunset's at 6:49. Good stargazing begins about an hour after. Straight overhead and bright will be the spindly cross of Cygnus, ""the swan,"" one of the largest constellations by area in the celestial sphere. A fat, four-star ""T"" forms the back of Cygnus's body. The brightest star is Deneb, at the swan's tail.
Skirting the northern horizon early in the evening will be Ursa Major (the Big Dipper). Above it lies Ursa Minor, the Little Dipper. It's smaller and dimmer than its big sibling. The North Star, Polaris, and the two stars at the end of its small box-shaped dipper are the easiest to see. Between Ursa Minor and Cygnus lie the diamond-shaped head of Draco, as well as the bright white star Vega in its tiny constellation of Lyra.
If you're somewhere with a particularly clear shot of the southwest horizon, yellowish Mars will be visible in the bright trio of ""claws"" of Scorpio as it sets around 8:30. Following Scorpio down the ladder of the sky at 10:00, and looking like a connect-the-dots Biltmore House is the bright, broad jumble of Sagittarius. 

NIGHT OWLS ONLY
By 11:00, beautiful Taurus the bull will be rising in the East. The horns are its most identifiable feature, they look like a peace sign. Rising with it these next few nights will be the bold orb of Jupiter. One way to identify planets against stars is the way they twinkle in the sky a lot less. Visible above Taurus is the unique little jewel box known as the Pleiades. 
Orion and Gemini rise after and below Taurus by 1 or 1:30. By wintertime, they will be rising earlier in the evening, good news for the non-night owls among us. Vega sets in the NW as Sirius, the most luminous star you'll ever see, rises in the SE around 2:30.
By 5 am, the morning star herself, Venus, rises from the due-eastern horizon. Ursa Major will be making an encore, rising north of Venus. At 6:30, the night's over. Gotta watch blue skies for the next twelve hours...

The skies will be shifting as the year ticks by. I'll keep you updated. Feel free to PM me more information about astronomy or night skies."	t5_2qo2j	True

Wanted to put a call out to invite anyone who wants to learn the process, and anyone who wants to bring their equipment with them and join in an outdoor brew session this Sunday at Noon.

I have a 10'x10' canopy and a couple camp chairs I can set up and can get another canopy if needed.  I'm thinking I'll grill some burgers and dogs for a late lunch, I have a milk stout that's aged and ready to drink and might have a few Irish Stout and Copper ales left to sample from previous brew sessions.

Sounds like a great idea to me.. I know a few redditors that are actually in the Charlotte Disc Golf Club /r/cdgc (sound off, if you see this fellas!) --

Firstly, gauging interest: 

- How many of you are disc golfers?

- How many of you are NOT disc golfers, but might be interested in this strange and beautiful sport that recently brought thousands of people from 13 different countries to our fine city to play on fourteen of our beautiful (and abundant) courses? 

I guess we have a few options. We could get together outside of any club activities and just play a round... maybe make it a weekly thing? 

Or, there are tons of club activities that go on every week. Every Thursday at 5pm is Amateur League at Sugaw Park. It's a lot of fun, and a low-stress type of tournament. $5 to enter - the payout is usually 15-20 discs AND a bunch of ""Closest to the Pin"" prizes. You also get a handicap, so beginners can and do beat pros when all the calculating is over! This is where I amassed at least half of my disc collection, so I encourage everyone to check it out.

Anyway... beginners, pros, disc-curious... respond, s'il vous plait!

To offset the cost of this I scored some nice swag. Couple packs of those Camel Orb things a sample pack of some other nicotine type things. Two sweet aprons also scored from the Camel tent. Monster energy drinks and some four hour energy things you often see at the gas station for $2 a pop. Oh Wendy's had a thing set up giving away free burgers and frostys (I did not partake of the burger but had a frosty for desert). Then I got 'the itis' and had to go home and take a nap.

If you have any experience working with cell phones and are looking for full time work, Mon-Friday 9:30-6:15, 2,3 Saturdays a month, 10-5 (You get a full day off if you work a Saturday) and NEVER WORK A SUNDAY :)  The pay is 9$-11$ an hour, but can be negotiated depending on experience and how you preform during your first 90 days.

If you are interested, send me your name and a little about yourself.  I will then give you my email and phone number so that we can set up an interview.

Thanks, I finally hope to meet a Redditor in the wild, and maybe even work with you! "	t5_2qo2j	True
1311656916.0	izw6b	A different poker game - Saturdays	EpicallyAwesome	10	0	11	"We host a NL Texas Hold'em game every Saturday night starting between 6:30-7:30.  We always have at least 4-6 people (2-3 redditors), but are looking for a few more to flesh it out up to 8 (We could possibly handle more if we pull out the blackjack table too).  Buy-in is normally $15-20.  3rd place gets half money back, 2nd gets money back, 1st gets the rest.  If we only have 5, only top 2 get paid.  The game is located in south Charlotte near South Park Mall.  Blinds increase every 15 minutes with a smoke break every other blind.

We don't supply food or alcohol, but you're welcome to bring your own as most of us will probably be drinking anyways.  Also, we're 420 friendly, so if that's what you're into, it's cool.

The way it works is you let me know you're interested with a comment on here and message me your facebook URL.  I'll add you and then add you to the poker group facebook page also.  From there we create an event and you will be auto invited every week to RSVP: Yes, no, maybe.  We've been doing it this way for a while now and it works out pretty well.  Just fyi, the age range of our current players are 22-30.

1311371492.0	ix6mj	My wife got a job offer in your city, We could really use some moving advice.	aywwts4	11	1	33	"**Preemptive TLDR: Husband and wife in their mid twenties seeks fun youthful living in a safer place for under 1400 a month. Working a few miles NE of the center of the city.** We will likely only have one shot in the city to find the place to live. Work starts mid august, potentially in less than 3 weeks, so I need help!

*(I have Read every thread on the subject about moving and apartments on r/Charlotte and r/charlottenc need some more info if you don't mind)* Pardon my naive questions.

** Our personal circumstances** 

My wife and I will likely be moving to your nice looking town in the next month, we will be moving from Green Bay Wisconsin. We are both mid twenties, (White is a pretty safe assumption of anyone from Wisconsin BTW, I'm the second Wisconsin expat on this subreddit) she just got offered a job as a teacher just to the north east of ""uptown"" (I think is the nomenclature, it is outside of the loop/beltline (Is there a local name for the 277/77 loop around the uptown (Also do you really not call it a downtown?) but only by a few minutes. We realize the schools are a bit rough in CMS but strongly feel every kid deserves a good education and have no regrets about that. I am an IT/Network tech who can perform my current job anywhere in the world with internet, but will look into picking up more clients in NC, no rush though. *(Personal Advertisement: Need VPNs Firewalls, Networking, open source solutions like content filters, gateway virus filters, internet usage narcs (facebook blockers), customized customer/lead databases, all with a mind for budget and low long term cost, let me know :)*

Your apartment/townhouse/rental house market is overwhelming and crazy, I have never seen so many affordable and attractive places up for rent. You have 3 bedroom houses for rent for cheaper than I could rent a mediocre 2 bedroom apartment here.)


**Where should we live? Where should we avoid.** Also, what the hell is a NoDA? :)

We are shopping in the ~900-1400 for a one bedroom, preferably with an office/den and a nice sized kitchen for regular cooks, I Also won't deny being impressed by modern looking granite counter-tops, steel appliances, and stylish dark wood cabinets, even if it is all a laminate from ikea.

We are both young, in our mid twenties, have no kids, and want to have fun. We are foodies from Wisconsin so we love drinking and dining, and being able to walk to those venues would be great. (We are not a fan of the dive bar crowd, quality microbrews and good fresh healthful quality food is what we like) We like live music, shows, parks, walking, having fun, etc. I see lots of very nice quaint looking houses for great prices but I am worried they are too far from the action.

We loved the ""walkable and urban"" feel of Madison WI, your uptown ""4th ward"" looks very attractive if a good apartment could be found for the right price but I realize the square footage would go down a lot. Though it gets closer to the schools she would teach in.** Are there other more affordable areas that are also attractive for these reasons? Perhaps where having 2 parking spots is easier to come by?**

Relative safety would be good, not so worried about car theft/break in, we drive dented up wagons, violent crime however is a definite downer.

**Other questions:** 

* Does Virgin Mobile have good 3G service there? (They show up good on their maps, but their maps and reality seldom agree)

* Real estate companies to avoid? Anyone you would recommend, we will likely need to fly out stay in a hotel, and find a place in a rushed manner.

* Good websites to shop for apartments in your area? (Using Craigslist and Zillow at the moment)

* Hypothetically if we lived uptown and my wife had to take a 15 minute bus-ride northeast because we had one car, are the buses safe/clean/not creepy as all hell?

* How hard are the emissions inspections to pass? I have a 92 oldsmobile that is rusted around the everything, particularly the muffler, I love the car to death (literally, its a death trap) but I wouldn't want to stick a bunch of money catalytic converters and whatnot.

* Is Time Warner available throughout most of the city? We have great luck with them here, and terrible luck with ATT, is the same roughly true in your area?

* Here we have a great grocery store that is the size of multiple Walmart super centers selling every food imaginable at great prices here, anything similar there? We would gladly drive a distance to find it. 

* Am I going to be able to find fresh mozzarella, Gouda, aged asiago, young asiago, 10 year cheddar, etc etc etc, Our liquor stores have several hundred if not thousand micro-brews for sale will I be disappointed? (Yes every Wisconsin stereotype is 100% accurate, actually the reality is probably even worse than the stereotype.) 

You city seriously looks very impressive on google's street view, So that's what regular growth and prosperity looks like huh? All our towns are losing population, aging, and rotting from the inside out, our downtown's are littered with abandoned storefronts, 20 year dead malls, and industrial buildings, etc. You have a thriving subreddit of what seems to be incredibly helpful and happy people (/r/greenbay is filled with depressed people who all use the caveat, yes I reluctantly live in green bay, BUT I plan on leaving ASAP) I am seriously excited to be escaping from Green Bay and its nine month long winters, and coming to visit for perhaps quite a while. **Thanks for your time!**

We had a couple new faces with reddichange and Bob_fKING_rOss. I think reddichange won a couple so that was cool. Newsedition took a place as well.

On a whim I grabbed [One of these for a prize since beer seems to be popular](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/113/573) as luck would have it the person that won it did not drink so everyone else glutted it down lol.

I have a feeling that the next event is going to be the largest turn out yet as Tommy and Frank will be back in town.

1364762042.0	1bdkeq	Need a place to live in South Park?		11	3	8	Hey all, sorry to make a Craigslist-style post, but thought this might be a slightly less sketchy way to find a roommate. I live in a nice, new 2 bed/2 bath apartment in South Park (right behind the Whole Foods). My current roommate is moving to Raleigh for a new job and I'm looking for someone to move into his room in mid April. Rent is $547.50 each per month, utilities are about $75 each (but I can be talked into cancelling cable, if you don't really want it). I have two cats and per the building's rules no more pets are allowed. Your room is the larger of the two, en suite, walk-in closet. I'm a 25 year old woman, I work a lot, and am pretty low-key. PM me if you're interested and I can send you photos, give you more details, etc. Thanks!	t5_2qo2j	True

Hi, i'm going to be a new resident to the Charlotte area. (We are going to be moving into the Windover apartments.)

I actually spent most of my time in Waynesville, NC because that is where her parents live. So, I don't really know much about Charlotte at all.... (went to Charlotte twice during the whole trip, once to get the apartment all set up, then again the final day to get dropped off at the airport.)

Oh yeah and an interesting detail..... we are driving from Sacramento, CA to Charlotte, NC. This will be loads of fun.

Nice little house and i'm looking for a roommate because living alone sucks.  I'm looking for someone who's at least moderately neat.  I have a lady that comes to clean every week and can do most of the cleaning like dishes, moping, bathrooms, and your bedroom if you choose.

It's empty so you will need a bed.  I can supply a TV and night stand and such but no bed.  You will have your own full bath that is painted yellow (light yellow) and you can decorate however you see fit.  I'm asking for first, last, and security but if you've been at your job for over a year and provide a number I can call to verify I can waive security.

I'm looking for someone who works 9-5 and likes to go out and do things during the week perhaps but especially weekends.  If you want more information reply here or send me a PM and i can arrange a time for us to chat on phone, skype or you can see the room in person and do an interview then.

1361798937.0	196vgr	Realistic Commute Times to Downtown?? (Mint Hill, Fort Mill, and Pineville	Breezer95	13	5	25	"I'm hoping to get real world feedback on what commute times are like from each of these areas to downtown. I am currently in the downtown area and plan to move within the year. I have lived in various areas outside of downtown over the years, but the commute time seems to fluctuate every 3 years or so with new businesses, neighborhoods, construction, etc.  

That said... if anyone has some recent ""realistic"" commute times for any of these places, I'd really appreciate it.

By realistic, I mean on morning/evening rush hour traffic. Once upon a time a trip from parts of Mooresville to downtown would be less than 40min on avg.... but when I lived there I started having to give myself 75min on avg to get to work solely due to congestion and high potential of wrecks.  
  
Really appreciate all the information. It basically reassured me that a lot of what I hear from people is BS and most commutes are going to be legitimately 30 minutes minimum regardless. Thanks!"	t5_2qo2j	True

Ok, so I tried Midnight Diner and it was pretty good overall. The waffle was a bit overcooked but not burnt. Not the best there, sort of average. But the chicken wings were great IMHO. The joint overall is alright, but not a lot of room at the booth I was at with 5 people. Menu is pretty decent with a lot of selection and the prices are not bad either. Its not a super clean place or fine dining, but I liked it.
