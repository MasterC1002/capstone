1358898396.0	17360y	[Modpost] 1000 subscribers? Hooray! Competition time!	Nocontext_Wallpaper	25	7	8	"Never thought my work would be as popular as this, so to celebrate, I'm going to host a competition! ^yaaaaaay

Simply put, I want you lovely lot to put your out of context caps on and create the weirdest, best looking wallpapers you can think of. You don't have to actually have context for the text, you can come up with it yourself, but I'm sure the voters would like to actually see what it means.

**RULES**

1. Follow the **subreddit rules** posted in the sidebar to the right ---&gt;

2. **One submission per person**. I will keep track of those who enter, and if you enter twice, I will remove your first entry in case you think your second try is better and would like to enter that one instead.

3. Votes will be counted from **total number of upvotes**, not points (so downvotes will not matter). This prevents people from downvoting other's entries to make theirs appear more popular.

4. Submissions are to be left as **post in the subreddit**, alongside a **reply in [this thread over here (click me!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext_wallpapers/comments/17366x/competition_entries/)**. Title it with something relevant to the text on the wallpaper, so we know which post is which. Also, in the same post, link the context and original wallpaper.

5. Use high resolution images **(1024x768 minimum)**. This allows those who actually enjoy your work to use it as a wallpaper, rather than just a senseless image.

6. Winner is subject to my judgement as to whether the submission was fair, original and has not used any sort of cheateredery. If the most upvoted wins by a *mile*, it may be obvious that they used a bot to supply upvotes. Please don't do this, I may just not let it count.

**PRIZES** (omgwtfnowai)


I'm poor and unoriginal. 1^st prize will be to become a moderator of the subreddit and have a choice of one of the following:

- 1x any $15/£10 **Steam game** of their choice

- 1x year's subscription to **CatFacts^tm**

- 1x year's supply of **Reddit Gold^tm**

- 1,000,000x **Internet hugs**

- Your submission **printed out in high quality** and mailed to you.

- Something worth $15/£10 I can have mailed to your address (I promise I won't use your address for anything bad!)

2^nd and 3^rd prizes will be moderation of the subreddit and a month's worth of Reddit Gold^tm

10 of the best submissions (including the top three) will be put into a nocontext wallpaper calendar (not sure how I will do this yet, but they will be ready sometime for you all to purchase online).

You have until **8^th February** to hand your submission in, so get working on it!"	t5_2vy4j	True

However, I feel that I should post some sort of guideline as to how to format your posts here, just to make it clearer for all of us.

**1)** Make your titles relevant to the text on the wallpaper, not about the picture itself.

**2)** The text on the wallpaper should *not* be relevant to the picture itself, that's the glory of a nocontext_wallpaper!

**3)** Within the comments of your submission, post a link to the relevant context of the text and to the source image you used.  This allows those curious enough to follow through with the text to see how it came about. Format of this should be:

 **""Context: [subreddit/screenshot link]""**

**""Source: [imgur/flickr/wherever]**

If there is no actual context and you came up with it yourself (discouraged, but allowable) then say so in a comment.

**4)** If people request different versions of your post or suggest improvements, take them as kind words of advice! If you feel that you wish to improve with your work, have a go at using the advice given and resubmit it as a reply to the suggestion and see if it's improved. I do, and I personally feel that my work has improved substantially!

**5)** Use **high quality** images suitable for wallpaper use. I recommend a minimum resolution of 1024x768, but any larger size is just fine as well. Also post the resolution in the title of your post.

Finally, **6)** Have fun! I enjoy making completely dumb wallpapers and I hope you wonderful people enjoy them too, and you should enjoy making them too."	t5_2vy4j	True

This has led to an increase in the number of people submitting their own works here, which I approve of, but I just want to remind everyone to **read the rules in the sidebar** before submitting your works. This way, we can keep the quality high and context gone, and you may even want to submit your best wallpaper in my competition!

Running this subreddit is getting difficult by myself, so on the 8th February, I'll be choosing a winner from the entries for a $15/£10 prize of their choice from the prize list (pretty small atm but can be anything really). I will also let them become a moderator of the subreddit, along with the 2nd and 3rd place winners.
