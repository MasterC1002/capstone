So I'm curious about a few things here. When you want to read input, the syntax is `var name = System.Console.ReadLine();` ... Is there a better way to achieve this? The above code looks pretty Python-ish and it's kinda disturbing, especially since C# **is** a C dialect. Does C# have a `scanf` equivalent? And other cool tricks you'd like to share?

Also, I know there is the mono project, but how safe is it to use? Is it overly complicated, because I was thinking of typing some C# on a Linux distro and I don't want anything more complicated than a `gcc $file ..`

Anyways, thank you for your time here and I'd be interested to read the comments later.

([Screenshot](http://serayen.com/ck2/coabuilder.jpg)) To build the Coat of Arms, I needed to draw it pixel by pixel using a series of masks.

[Here](http://serayen.com/ck2/coaguide/christemppercross.png) is a combined image of one of the template masks which is actually 4 files, with each numbered area being a separate file and drawn as a separate layer, then combined after. And [here](http://serayen.com/ck2/coaguide/christpattern3.png) is one of the pattern mask  files, with the green, red, and blue being replaced by the chosen colours. The emblems(lions in the screenshot) and frame are drawn on afterwards.

With the standard bitmap class, it was taking around 500 ms to draw the four layers, even when it was drawing pixels only visible with the mask. Needless to say this isn't too good if you want to have the image update immediately after a control is changed. After I learned how to do unsafe pixel modification the draw time dropped down to 7ms for all four layers."	t5_2qhdf	True

I've just recently started to learn to code. I have dabbled a little in C++, but it was only a first-level course.

Why C#? I don't really know, I guess its from many of my friends that codes, they gave me the hints up on learning C#, since its rather simple and easy to use. Some said I should learn the from the roots up starting with C++ or C(if I want a tough experiance).
One even suggested Python, he works mainly with web-coding so I guess Python is used mostly for that?

Anyway, I decided to start learning C#. On my own, not taking any classes. At my work I have a ton of free time now on the summer so I can code at work if I want to. Although I can't install anything on my workcomputer, and I haven't had the money to invest in a laptop, yet.

I found this site: http://www.compileonline.com/compile_csharp_online.php which let you code online, but it is rather limited when using inputs. I was wondering if there is a similar site that lets you use almost as close as possible to a comand prompt window.

* If covariance utilizes inheritance hierarchy (correct me if I'm wrong) to work such as when assigning a more derived object to a less derived reference, on what basis does contravariance work when it's the opposite way?
* Couldn't I hypothetically do something in the contravariant interface method that wouldn't be allowed by the less derived type object which will be assigned? Why or why not?
* Why can a covariant type only be referenced as the return type? What is the limiting reason?
* Why can a contravariant type only be referenced as the type of the method argument and not as the return type? What is the limiting reason?
* In what situations or examples can covariance and contravariance become necessary or useful? Please keep the examples simple and/or use generic interfaces to explain since I have not reached delegates yet.

If you can answer any of these questions I'd be very grateful. I've read the variance section in the generics chapter about 3 times and I've searched for articles but many utilize delegates which I have yet to cover and the others do not answer my questions."	t5_2qhdf	True

We like the mechanics of the game and the idea behind it, so we want to carry on developing this as a group project.

I have two questions. My first is about csproj files; is it possible to write separate csproj files that reference platform specific assemblies (api compatible but built for different platforms) and have those platform specific csproj files include another csproj file that references only code and content?

My second question is regarding documentation. I've seen how useful triple forward slash comments can be and I want to somehow integrate them with something like Sphinx (Which I have used at work with Python code). My current plan is to use Doxygen to parse the triple forward slash comments, use Breathe to allow Sphinx to work with the Doxygen generated api docs. Does anyone have any experience doing something like this and can you suggest any ways of improving or automating the process, especially if it can be integrated with something like Read The Docs.

    int asd = (int)e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""];

was causing my program to jump to a random place in the code(jumping into another function).  
It seemed to be not completely random: First time reaching the above line = jump to line x, second time -&gt; line y, third time -&gt; line y, fourth time -&gt; line z (then i stopped testing).

Well... I solved the problem this way:

    int asd = Convert.ToInt32(e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""]); 


But I would still like to know what may cause behaviour like this.  
My first attemt in fixing it was completely rebuilding the project, then I checked for events and seached for something that may happen when getting the e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""] variable...none of them fixed the problem, but what I wrote above did...I am slightly confused now.  

All Ideas are welcome, maybe I will test them =)

UPDATE:
After hours of testing, I can say that my initial thoughts are probably wrong.
The same thing now happens at another line, which has nothing in common with the previous one.

The line it jumps to is roughly in the area where something happens, that triggers the event that calls the function the lines are in.

There is stuff in the function that still needs to be executed, and it sadly breaks my complete program if this jump happens. (The important stuff isn't displayed anymore, the program itself keeps on running.)"	t5_2qhdf	True

1372872607.0	1hkub1	Need some help for the direction to take with a C# Project	helpmecsharp	16	4	7	"Hi All,

First off, let me thank this group for helping me out with a lot of my daily work. I come here often to read up on the latest and greatest in C# development. 

I recently started work on a Project which is written in C# and has both a Front end in ASP.NET and Web Services component in WCF. A small piece of this Integration needs to be re-written to be integrated with a Third party API.

Now here are the issues

1. The current state of code has very little to almost NO documentation
2. Configuration files are old, may or may not be using some or all of the key parameters
3. Parts of code may not be used at all and there is no ""Deprecated"" advice from the Developers. 
4. NO Documentation on the Architecture, Process flow and or Page flow within the Application
5. I do not have Debug permissions until at least 2 more weeks (Slow process within the Company for access related stuff)

With all these issues, I need some guidance to do the following

1. Creating a process/page flow diagrams with some analysis of the Code
2. Document pieces of code that will have to be re-written for the Integration
and Finally,
3. To understand the new Integration and how much of the code may / may not be re-used. 

Any direction in this regard will be of great help.

     foreach (string s in list.Items)
                        {

                            sc.WaitForStatus(System.ServiceProcess.ServiceControllerStatus.Stopped, new TimeSpan(0, 0, 10));
                            sc.Refresh();
                            LogToConsole(s + "" stopped"");
                        }
    
But when I run as a non-domain admin, I get an access denied error. When I manually log on to that box as the non-admin user and open services, I get the UAC popup. If i click through it, I can stop the services fine. 

How can I assert UAC permissions remotely?

I tried googling this, but it seems Im not asking the right question.

Anyone know the best practice use cases here? Assume a C# solution in VS which includes several projects (a ""super-project""). One or more of the projects are actually library-type controls in their own right, and currently under source control. 

I want to be able to pull in the latest changes made to the original library project (think custom controls), so that they are reflected in the super-project. 

Also, If I make a customization to one of the library projects within the project group, I would like the option to push changes back upstream if I decide the change should be universal to that particular control. Other changes I may want to keep only within the version being used in the super-project.

Is this a case for submodules, or for Subtree merging? If it not a clear case, what are the pitfalls? Each seems potentially messy. Does one model or the other lend itself better to Visual Studio's ""Solution"" structure?

I'm hoping someone can spoon feed me a little bit.  I'm doing a summer internship where I've been tasked at creating both an app and a web interface for something.  However all of my experience is in the linux realm using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

Could someone please explain to me how exactly the following pieces fit in the puzzle:

ASP - my understanding is that this a web-centric language much like PHP is.  Yes, no?

C# - So C# is a language.  Am I correct in the understanding that it's an extension of C in the same vein as C++ is an extension of C?  If so, are people using C# to program server-side scripts (in other words is C# used to replace ASP or am I smoking crack here?).  I'm not sure if I should be aiming to use C# just for the app I'm to build or for the whole deal.

.NET - I skimmed wikipedia's page on .NET but would truly appreciate a uber-brief explanation of .NET and what this ""framework"" is for.


I realize only one of these questions is directly related to C# but I'm really not quite sure what level of integration (if any) C# has with the others.  As always, my apologies if my noobishness has caused me to post something where it should be posted. :)"	t5_2qhdf	True

Now then, I am using 'Murach's ASP.Net 4.0 Web Programming with C# as a study reference, and Visual Studio 2010 for developing. Now then, I should first note that I haven't been in the programming groove for 5+ years and have since forgotten some of the basics, so forgive me if I call something by the wrong name and so forth. 

Now then, I am working on 'SessionsState' and am confused about the functionality and the usage. 

The examples provided by the book are: 

**A statement that adds or updates a session state item**  

EX: Session[""Cart""] = cart;

**Another way to add or update a session state item**  

EX: Session.Add(""Cart"", cart);

What I am confused about I guess is the entire thing. I don't get what's going on here at all, and I've read the chapter twice. They had me create a class identifying 3 variables:  

Public Class Customer  
    Public Property FirstName As String  
    Public Property LastName As String  
    Public Property Email As String  
End Class  

Which is called Customer.vb  

They then want me to:

&gt;""4. Switch back to the CheckOut page and add an event handler for the Load event of the page. 

I've got that down.

&gt;If the page is not being posted back, this event handler should get a Customer object from session state and store it in a variable that's declared outside the method.  

So I came up with:

If (!IsPostBack); 

but that's as far as I can get, I just don't understand. The rest of the step follows:  

&gt; Then, if session state doesn't contain a customer object, this variable will store a null value. If it doesn't store a null value, though, this method should display the customer information in the text boxes.  

This may be easy as pie for most of you, but I just picked up the book yesterday and have only basic .NET familiarity. So forgive my idiocy, and please assist? I hate feeling stuck."	t5_2qhdf	True

That being said, I'm looking for a few pointers, or perhaps some pseudocode that's a little easier to understand. 

I'm trying create the following program:

""Three salespeople work at Sunshine Hot Tubs— Andrea, Brittany, and Eric. Write a C# console application to prepare a Sales Commission report that prompts the user for a salesperson’s initial (‘ A’, ‘ B’, or ‘ E’). While the user does not type ‘ Z’, continue by prompting for the amount of three sales the salesperson made. Calculate the salesperson’s commission as 20 percent of the sales amount, and add the commission to a running total for that salesperson. After the user types ‘ Z’ for an initial, display each salesperson’s total commission earned, along with the total commission paid. Display a title and header for the report. Use a for loop to write the salesperson’s name, total sales and commission on one line of the report. Your application is expected to contain several methods.""

So I'm fairly sure that I've got it set up correctly where the user enters their name, but I'm having real hell with figuring out how to get and calculate the commission.

I have a web service which accepts data from our affiliates. I thought this business logic was in place, its not and it's causing problems with a few Affiliates that can't get their act together. 

We have separate columns in our database for Years and Months. And months should ONLY be 0-11 months. We shouldn't allow any value greater than 11. Since if it was 1 Year, 12 Months. That should be entered as 2 Years, 0 Months. 

So looking at the code I notice we just move the data.
 this.EmployerMonths = dt.Rows[0][""EmployedMonths""].ToString().PadLeft(1, '0');

So I thought I'd add the following to convert back to 11 if the value is greater. But then realized it was a string and not an int. So added the convert.toint32.
            // Make max employer months to be 11 months - Max 12-10-12
            if (Convert.ToInt32(this.EmployerMonths) &gt; 11)
            {

It started off as just a pre-made AIML bot, where it would load a dll that someone else had made for C# and spit out lines based on what people said in the rooms.  That grew tiresome so I decided to try to make a markov chain ""brain"" to the bot, which I based on an old friend's ruby bot called Language Bot (and you'll see I named the markov chain ""brain"" the ""LB Brain"" due to that).  

And it's been worked on off and on since. I've got a little bit of spare time this week and loaded it up after not touching it for a while. And..well, it's probably a huge wreck.  At this point the whole ""learn as I go"" thing is making the bot a huge mess.  And I'm not really sure where to go to really learn about how to fix this and improve it.  And I mean the code itself, not trying to improve how the lines are generated or any way to make the bot ""smarter"".

I threw the whole thing up on [google code](http://code.google.com/p/kon-csharp-chatterbot/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FBin) and while I don't really expect anyone to seriously sit down and rewrite the bot for me, I'm really hoping someone here might be able to at least look through and give me some pointers/suggestions/maybe some code blocks to make things better. 
I tried to comment quite a bit as I went (as I was taking months off at a time and needed to know what I was doing when I came back) so hopefully you'll be able to follow what it's trying to do lol.

Also, if anyone knows of any solid, easy to tap into, pre-made IRC libraries to use..I'd appreciate that as well.  I'm really more interested in the markov chain/chat bot aspect.  Having to write my own IRC client in addition has been quite a headache for me.

Thanks in advance to anyone who tries to help me out with this."	t5_2qhdf	True

Can someone provide an example of how I would implement the built-in .NET data binding or another design pattern I should be using?  Is there a standard way to do this using LINQ-To-SQL objects?

&gt; I started working as a programmer in training at my current employer a few weeks ago. They had me learn C#, and I've got the basics. We are solely working in Visual Studio developing ASP.NET web pages, and of coarse using SQL as our database standard. My background in programming beforehand was only VB.NET, but I picked up C# no problem. 

I am very much stuck on SQL, I've got the syntax. My task today is to learn how to use stored procedures, it seems easy enough, and maybe I'm making this a bigger problem than it should be, but I cannot for the life of my understand the how/why of stored procedures. I get that they're run on the server side, to save resources locally, and they're essentially precompiled SQL code that you call whenever you want to perform that function ( I like to think that they're similar to a 'class' in the C# world)....but I just can't wrap my head around it. So what I am asking of you, sweet reddit, is for a super basic guide that works with Visual Studio and SQL and C# and goes step by step....creating a database, adding tables, and then manipulating the data with stored procedures....my googling has given me a few resources, but I get overwhelmed as soon as something's mentioned that I don't understand (which is a good amount) and as a result, I go into a hosing state in which I can't do anything. So please, for the love of all that is holy, help me out! 

Please, and thank you!

So here it is, I have a class called UI that is pretty much the HUD for the game I'm working on. The UI class is responsible for updating a list of buttons once something is selected (i.e. you select a building it displays the buttons that are associated with that building). The way I would like to do this is have a object that holds a reference to what is currently selected, once it changes it updates the buttons. The thing is I don't have a base class for everything that can be selected so I can't just polymorph from a generic class to the more specific type. I have two main base classes, building and unit. Now the obvious solution would be to create two objects to hold a reference, one for buildings and another for units but that is bad design and isn't very modular (plus if I had another base class for a different type of unit I would have to do a lot more coding to get that to work). The next solution I thought of would be using generics but I still have the same problem with polymorphing but with the bonus of type safety. Then again I could always choose Object as the base class and go from there although that doesn't seem like very good practice either. I'm new to C# (I'm mainly a Java programmer) so I'm not 100% on how generics work with C# but is there a way to say ""anything that implements the interface selectable""?

I'm working on a 3D viewer using OpenTK. The 3D viewing part works fine. I can already import STL files (Which is a format designed for 3D printers and it outputs an array of triangles. Pretty simple but also limited), and interact with them with no problem.


Now I'm trying to write a parser for a 3D format called XGL. XGL follows the XML standard.
In this format you have an interesting structure of objects, which can have meshes and other objects within themselves.
[This is all the documentation I could find about the file format](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/xgl/xgl_spec.html).


It is the first time that I try to parse an XML file and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I understand that because the structure of the objects in the XGL file are flexible (there may or may not be children, those children may or may not have more children) I have to make a class that can accommodate all this (I can't just have the class be generated from the info on the XML file, is this right?). But I don't know how to handle the hierarchy, how to know when I left a node and I'm back at a different property of it's parent.

I would really appreciate it if somebody could point me in the right direction. Maybe I'm making this too complicated and there is a semi-automatic way to generate a class and fill it with information. What would be the easiest way of doing something like this?
Any interesting reads or similar projects?

I know this question is horribly made, because I know so little that I don't know what I don't know... Please make any questions that might help define my problem in a more useful way.

1359154438.0	17a82z	Two questions about program deployment	bakedpatato	11	3	9	"I'm writing a WPF app that depends on a couple of (i'm assuming) WPF dlls for the controls in the program(DevExpress WPF if you're curious). From what I read on the DevExpress web site and what I've seen online, if I put the required dlls next to the .exe and run the .exe, the program will work. 

However, if I have a computer with .net 4.0 installed and nothing else and I run the VS2012 emitted exe in a folder with all the proper dlls, the program crashes with a Xaml parse error(project is .net 4.0). 

But if I use clickonce(with all the proper dlls put in the project) on the same computer and then run the clickonce installed program, my program doesn't crash(because clickonce registers all the dlls with the GAC right?). 

This does not work for me because I need to define where the exe is installed. I tried integrating all the dlls into the exe using [this method](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2010/02/03/jeffrey-richter-excerpt-2-from-clr-via-c-third-edition.aspx) but the program still crashes with the same Xaml parse error.

The engine is suposed to allow the user to program the most minimal amount, while allowing for a very in depth product at the end. In this case, the engine is used for Text Based Adventure Games. I have posted a couple time before about this for Ideas FOR it. I've finalized the Ideas and am in the process of making them work, but I have a simple problem that requires complex code that I am confused about.

The problem that I have is that I want to create a method, lets say called ""AddCommand"", with the following parameters, ""(string command, [method] script)"". when the user wants to add a command to the program, instead of requiring them to make a complex switch statement with lines beyond lines of code for it to execute,  I want them to have a simple command, ""AddCommand(""/walk"", script.WalkScript());"" to add the command. In the example I provided I want the program to realize, when the user types ""/walk"", it will invoke ""script.WalkScript();"" (I have an empty Script class, script is a Script object, with a method RunScript). But that is my problem. For one, I have made the method store ""/walk"" in an array, but I do not know how to store the ""script.WalkScript()"" method. I know I could make a Delegate, but that would require the USER to make a delegate for each method, which is a complex idea I dont want to require them to do. So firstly, how would I be able to do this, in a way that the ONLY thing the user would be require to do is make a simple ""WalkScript"" method in the Script class, then do the command ""Add Command"" method. My second question, which is kind of a given... how, in the ""AddCommand"", method would I RUN the given method that they imputed as the parameter?

1372191584.0	1h26mh	Wait on async tasks from synchronous methods without deadlocking in WindowsForms/ASP.NET	BecauseItOwns	6	3	5	"Hi Folks, I released a (very small) library to call asynchronous tasks from synchronous methods and get their results. It's been a huge help so far so I thought I'd share it to help others and get feedback on improvements to make.

Link: [AsyncBridge](https://github.com/tejacques/AsyncBridge)

Background:
While working on an older ASP.NET project, I began writing async functions to take advantage of concurrency in DB calls, however, since most of the project predated async, it was not ""Turtles all the way down"" and I encountered extremely frustrating deadlocks while trying to queue up multiple tasks and wait on them. In my searching I came across several articles including [this one](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx) which mentioned you could ""[only] mix blocking and async code [in] Console main method"". I began trying to find ways around this, but most either didn't work or were extremely cumbersome and inelegant.

Finally after a lot of searching I came across [this class](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/163ef755-ff7b-4ea5-b226-bbe8ef5f4796/is-there-a-pattern-for-calling-an-async-method-synchronously) by John Melville which nearly did what I wanted. His class is the foundation for mine, and allows you to unwrap the result of a task that's run synchronously by passing it as a lamba.

E.G.

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncString()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        return ""TestAsync"";
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        string s = AsyncInline.RunSync(() =&gt; AsyncString());
    }

That was pretty good, but it wasn't very easy to queue up multiple tasks in a way to use that effectively, and you also had to wrap all of the tasks in lambdas, which is extra boilerplate.

What I came up with was a compromise between extracting the result easily, and queuing up multiple async tasks easily, and the result looks like this:

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncString()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        return ""TestAsync"";
    }
    
    public void Test()
    {
        string string1 = """";
        string string2 = """";
    
        using (var A = AsyncHelper.Wait)
        {
            A.Run(AsyncString(), x =&gt; string1 = x.Result);
            A.Run(AsyncString(), x =&gt; string2 = x.Result);
        }
    
        // Total Execution time at this point will be ~1000ms, not ~2000ms
        // The value of string1 = ""TestAsync""
        // The value of string2 = ""TestAsync""
    }

Exceptions bubble up to the top and stop execution of all queued tasks. Here's an example:

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncStringException()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new Exception(""Test Exception."");
    }

    public void TestException()
    {
        string s = """";
    
        try
        {
            using (var A = AsyncHelper.Wait)
            {
                A.Run(AsyncString(), x =&gt; s = x.Result);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // e.Message                 = ""AsyncBridge.Run method threw an exception.""
            // e.InnerException.Message) = ""Test Exception.""
            // Handle exception
            // ...
        }
    }

The library also allows for easy error handling with the Fire And Forget pattern, which can be called from either a synchronous function or an asynchronous one.

    public void Test()
    {
        AsyncHelper.FireAndForget(
            () =&gt; { /* Do Stuff on the thread pool */ },
            exception =&gt; { /* Optional exception handling, silently drop by default */ });
    }

This avoids the problem that can occur with memory leaks by calling Task.Run without handling exceptions, because the tasks sit around in memory holding onto the exception data until it is handled.

I wanted to use two classes because in the future I think this will be a must and if I get the concepts down ill be a better student/programmer.

What I think I didnt do right: Do I want my I/O in the main class there before I create my object and pass it to it? Or do I want my Console.ReadLine(); as one of the first things in my constructor?

Is there a better way to do displayMessage() and should it be located in that class? Or should I do that a totally different way?

Any and all pointers would help a lot, and I learn a ton by example.

For readers who don't use TPL: *CancellationTokens are similar to booleans; convenient in loop conditionals for ""should I continue working on this?""*

Unfortunately, CancellationTokens aren't passed into Task Actions as objects despite being explicitly used as Task parameters; Because the Task's Token is only for stopping Tasks before they start. Is there an easy way to pass a token into every Task's Action without doing Action&lt;token&gt;? I have nested tasks that don't pass objects around, so passing objects between Actions gets out of hand very quickly. 

Or, does anyone know if the sister implementation *Parallel* works any better with tokens in this respect? I'm just a bit taken-aback at how inaccessible the task parameters are despite the nature of *sender* and *e* we see everywhere else that tell us damn near anything we could possibly want to know about creation parameters.

**Background:** I'm learning C# by trial and error. The theme is that there's a long multi-threaded calculation being tossed off of the UI thread, and callbacks are used where you might expect returns. However, the UI may change the query before the calculation completes, which means any CPU wasted on the old query will only slow down the current query. That's where the cancellation comes in.

1327946064.0	p38lk	Where is my architecture broken? [Winforms/Events/Architecture]	Tetha	7	2	5	"Greetings.

I need some second or third eyes to look over this, since right now, the necessary actions to make this work sound just bad and I suppose I am missing something due to a lack of C# experience. 

I am currently working on a winforms c# application. More specifically, I am reworking a highly convoluted control flow between a custom winforms widget and the corresponding controller. 

To nail down some terms, the widget is called a DrawingPanel. On the drawing panel, the user can place certain components, which can be considered orange squares for now. He can select single components by clicking on them with the left button, he can select multiple components by dragging a box around them. Once he has components selected, he can right click and select operations like cut, paste, copy and so on with the obvious semantics. For usability reasons, he can also use these operations on a single component without selecting it. 

In the old state, the control flow between the DrawingPanel and the so-called EventManager mostly looks like two angry cats wrestling in mud, as it goes back and forth about 4 - 6 times in order to deduce the set of selected components. Somewhere in there, they are highlighted, but after an hour, I gave up deducing that for now, especially because there are about 2 dead highlighting functions in there. Since I have to add quite a bit of funcionality here, I guess it is up to me to redo this. 

In order to redo this, I figured a good way to straighten this out would be the following:

I add one event per user command to the DrawingPanel. The Controller of the DrawingPanel subscribes to these events and modifies the model accordingly in the event handler. For example, if a set of components is selected and the user clicks on ""Copy"" in the context menu, a CopyRequest-Event is raised which has this set of arguments as an argument. If a user clicks on ""Paste"" in the component menu, a PasteRequest-Event is raised, which is parametrized by the position of the paste request.

This should encapsulate the user interface, as the interface is reduced to a black box which is parametrized by the data model and raises events from the user. The EventManager could handle all user interfaces, which provide the appropiate events. Furthermore, the control flow would be greatly simplified, as it would become unidirectional: UI goes to Controller goes to Model.

Now, onto my problem. I have some very heavy code duplication in my event handlers in the DrawingPanel. A ton of event handlers subscribe to the Click-Event of a context menu, wrap the currently selected components into an ComponentSetArgument-object and fire the request-event with this new argument (if its not null). I am failing to remove this duplication. 

So far, I have tried to implement a higher order event handler generator (which would take a component set event and generate an evenhandler to subscribe at the click-event) and a mapping function on events (which would handle the click-event, apply a function and signal the outgoing event). Both of these fail because the multiway delegates are immutable. Thus, correct functionality would depend on creating the mapping or calling the wrap+call-higher order function after all subscribers are subscribed to the event. This yells ""recipe for disaster"" for me.

So, is there anything I can do beyond either tolerating this massive duplication or rolling my own subscription management there? Or, do I take the totally wrong way there and there is a massively better architecture here?"	t5_2qhdf	True

1330937094.0	qid31	Question about class instantiation and initialization	Tohserus	5	3	24	"Okay, I'm not a *complete* novice at programming, but I have trouble with certain aspects of OOP.

One of my questions is: Why does an instance of a class apparently need to be initialized twice?

The link to the tutorial in question that doesn't *explain this* is here:
http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson09

Right under Lesson 9-3, he lists this code:

    using System;

    public class DrawDemo
    {
        public static int Main( )
        {
            DrawingObject[] dObj = new DrawingObject[4];

            dObj[0] = new Line();
            dObj[1] = new Circle();
            dObj[2] = new Square();
            dObj[3] = new DrawingObject();

            foreach (DrawingObject drawObj in dObj)
            {
                drawObj.Draw();
            }

            return 0;
        }
    }

Under this code, he says this:

&gt;The type of object in this array is the DrawingObject class. The array is named dObj and is being **initialized** to hold four objects of type DrawingObject.
&gt;
&gt;Next the dObj array is **initialized**.

Normally I would write it off as an error in the description, but this particular method of creating instances has always confused me for just this reason. It seems that you need to initialize them twice, once to create the instance, and another to....create...the instance? I don't know. Help, please. I want to understand and I'm getting more fed up with OOP by the minute. :("	t5_2qhdf	True

I work in an office that does a lot of shipping/receiving. We use a system I've designed that prints labels/receipts/checks on all sorts of printers. A lot of time is wasted clicking a link, opening the file (pdf), selecting print, and choosing the printer.

Traditionally you can't print directly from a browser to an application, so I thought maybe I could use some sort of custom URL handler, and do something like this...

print://printer1:website.com/file.pdf

""printer1"" would be linked to a given printer via some sort of ini file or xml config or something, and then it would just print the given file out to the proper printer.

1296129613.0	f9zgf	Need some help with locking a shared resource between classes.	oystagoymp	3	0	9	"Ok first I must preface this question with a disclaimer, I'm really new to threading so this may be a 'newbie' question but I searched google and couldn't find an answer. As I understand it a critical section is code that can be accessed by only one thread, the danger being one thread will overwrite a value before the other is finished and vice versa. What can you do about changes made outside of your class for example, I have a line monitoring program:

    int currentNumber = provider.GetCurrentNumber();
    if(provider.CanPassNumber(false, currentNumber))
    {
    currentNumber+=2;
    provider.SetNumber(currentNumber);
    }

and on another thread I have something like this:

    if(condition)
        provider.SetNumber(numberToSet);


Now I'm afraid that in the first function I get currentNumber which is 5, right after that on another thread the number is set to 7 and then it rewrites the 7 to 6, ignoring the change made by the thread that set it to 7.

Is there anyway to lock provider.SetNumber until the first function finishes? The critical section is basically the currentNumber which can be changed by many places in the program.

I hope I made myself clear, if not let me know and I will try to explain myself better.

EDIT: Also I made the functions really short for the example. In reality the function is much longer and makes changes to currentNumber many times so I don't really want to put a lock around the entire function. If I lock every call to provider.SetNumber and release it after I finish it can change during the time it is released before I lock it again to call provider.SetNumber. Honestly I'm also worried about locking the entire function because of performance and deadlock."	t5_2qhdf	True

1374425929.0	1ir9mv	My experience with WPF, and why you shouldn't be afraid of Expression Blend.	SayNoToWar	3	1	2	"Recently I've been writing a mailing app for a friend. Actually a hot chick I was dating. Needless to say since I didn't want to disappoint and wanted the quickest result I started off with tried and trusted Winforms. 

Why? Because I know Winforms. I know what to expect, I know the controls and although I knew the interface would come out looking a bit 1990's I felt the functionality was more important. Mainly I wanted to deliver :) But WPF and more importantly Expression Blend scared the hell out of me. I had this idea, it will be like Flash, and the last time I tried that it didn't go down very well. 

So I did the whole app in Windows forms. With more than enough time to spare, I decided I would create a v2 only this time using WPF for the front end. 

So 3 nights of coffee and no sleep, some tutorials and a bit of fiddling and experimenting, these are my findings. 

1. WPF with Visual Studio 2012 has come a long way and XAML has matured. However the whole WPF drag and drop type of styling isn't entirely there yet. Like every single other WYSIWYG editor, Blend too has it's problems, and you will be expected from time to time to edit XAML, but this isn't too big a deal. 

Examples: When adding a groupbox control -&gt; by default it only supports 1 child, so you manually need to add a GRID element. 

Some properties such as font colors don't update. Manually editing the XAML - fixes everything. 

2. Ok the Blend interface has some quirks - but all in all you can get everything done. 

3. What is Expression Blend? It's basically a designer tool like Macromedia Flash. However the lines blur between code and design because you can also code inside of Blend (but it's a bit limited). So it is best to have a solution open in both VS (for coding and debugging) and Blend for designing. For example you can't drag an image onto the canvas using Visual Studio, likewise you don't get great code completion using Blend. 

4. What is WPF anyways, isn't Silverlight dead? WPF is far from dead, and is actually a really awesome way to create great looking UI's. I think Microsofts main reason for killing off Silverlight is because they have intentions of IE natively supporting WPF. 

IE sucks so what's the point? HTML5 rules, WPF is dead! Again not so. Yes IE sucks, and no I don't have any plans to start using it soon. I'm not even going to try entice you with the whole ""corporate thin client"" usage. Instead I'm going to be hopeful and dream of the day when rendering engines (and 3rd party ones) can be installed in ALL of the popular browsers. An open source XAML rendering engine funded by Microsoft might just kick start this whole thing. 

Don't hole your breath? WPF is still good for Winform applications and there is always the Mono implementation for Linux apps. 

5. Without any formal training was I able to create a stunning user interface? Yes absolutely. My application isn't finished, but in 3 days I've learnt more than just the basics of WPF. I haven't even touched on overwriting control styles yet, and even without that, I've managed to create an app that looks a whole lot better than the Winforms app. 

6. What about animations and storyboards? Now here is where many desktop developers start getting the shivers from fear. Just remember the whole animation delivery is event driven. 

For example. I had 5 buttons I wanted to fade in and slide into view from the top of my form on FormLoad. Using Blend you assign the onLoad event to a storyboard. In the storyboard you have a time line, at each point in the timeline controls can have differant properties. Since it is key frame driven, XAML rendering figures out the interpolation between frames. So if you have opacity set to 0% at start, and 5 seconds later you have it set to 100%, the rendering takes care of the animation inbetween. Same for positioning, same for any property. 

7. Would you recommend it. Yes whole heartily. If you're a desktop WinForms developer. Take the plunge, set aside some time on a weekend, and just do it.

When I try running it on Windows 7 64-bit, it immediately crashes.  I was under the impression that executables generated for the .NET framework would run regardless of the host OS.

The only thing I can think of is that updated versions of the CLR v2 fixed a potentially unsafe operation that was not handled in the versions 3 years ago, and this results in the crash now.

I no longer have access to Visual Studio to debug it. Can anyone help me out and run it through a debugger to see where in the source it's causing the ""overflow exception""?

My first attempt was to write an extension for a webbrowser forms control, which was going great until I reached a page that had the entire HTMl generated dynamically through jquery.  I couldn't access any of the generated controls. 

As I understand it, I can get around this by using the mshtml library and reading the IHTMLDocument2, but then I totally lose the functionality of the web browser control which made it so useful.  It's pretty much just a raw HTML document without the usefulness of invoking javascript or set values/attributes etc.

My question is more high level, did I run into a solvable issue with my first strategy and I didn't realize it.  Or should I abandon it and look for a different solution (maybe chrome/ie extensions, building a whole new class on HtmlAgilityPack and sending out programmatic requests, or something else I hadn't thought of)"	t5_2qhdf	True

I've got a C# (4.5) WPF application that currently has cosmetic changes for each customer that uses the app.  These changes basically consist of a couple of images (company logo, etc) and some strings (Company names, procedural names, etc) rather than any changes to the business logic.

What I was hoping existed, was something very similar to the Localisation satellite assembly functionality, whereby I could have a separate class library project for each customer containing just a resource file, which would contain the changes to wording and images for that specific customer.  (e.g.  CustomerResources.dll).   If the CustomerResources library existed existed in the deployed package, then this would be searched for resources and if the specified resource wasn't found it would fall back to the main application (Neutral) Resources.

This would mean that only the strings and images that a customer wanted Customised would need to be their resource file, and their specific CustomerResources be included in their release package. 

I started putting something together using a MarkUp Extension for the Resource Strings, but hit some difficulties when it came to images declared within the XAML.

I briefly thought about using the Localisation framework to do this (e.g. provide a ""en-GB"" or ""en-US"" resource which is customer based, falling back to a neutral ""en"" resource library) but quickly realised this would be very problematic since I'd be relying on the correct Culture being set on their PC, and additionally would just lead to all sorts of headaches when the application does need to be properly localised.

I was wondering if there was any more straightfoward way of doing this that someone could suggest?  Failing that, I'll carry on using extensions and helper classes to roll my own.  I just thought this may be a fairly common problem.

I'm learning by rewriting a program that uses an XML file as a data source to use a SQL Server database as its data source.  The only problem is that my work environment is a medical one and so there are announcements going off all the time and I'm called away so often that I can't coherently string two thoughts together.  I have to write everything down so I can come back to it.  This is the bit of code I'm looking at.  I think I can grok more of it than I can explain because I don't have the vocabulary.

private static void LoadProducts(string path)

{

    products c;

    var s = new XmlSerializer(typeof (products));

    var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);

    TextReader reader = new StreamReader(fs);

    try

    {

	     fs.Position = 0;

	     c = (products) s.Deserialize(reader);

	     fs.Close();


         _toys = c.toys != null ? c.toys.ToList() : new List&lt;ProductsToy&gt;();

...............................................................................................

The first line is the declaration of a method to which is passed the xml file path in string form.

""products c"" comes from ""public partial class products"" (a class created by Visual Studio when adding the ""products.xml"" file as a data source?).  

Would the above be declaring a variable of user-defined type?

The line that really gets me is this one:

_toys = c.toys != null ? c.toys.ToList() : new List&lt;ProductsToy&gt;();

I think that this means ""Set _toys equal to the toys instance data of object c where c.toys isn't null, make _toys a list equal to the list of Toy elements in the xml document Products.""

var doc = XDocument.Load(@""c:\test.xml"");

**This XML works:**

Hey all, I inherited some code that I'm attempting to put into my C# project. It's used to check whether a particular user is a member of a particular AD group. GetGroups is a seperate class file which returns group information based on the AD User name. The SessionSessGroups variable is a string value containing all groups found for that AD Username. 

I've been looking over it for a couple of days and am drawing a blank as to how to make this work, I'm still pretty new to this so any help in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. 

The confusion on my end is the line where isallowed is assigned the value. I understand what it's trying to do(find whether the groupname is in the SessionSessGroups string or not), but not sure what the C# equivalent is to this?  Is this an overloaded method? I can post elsewhere if this is not the relevant subreddit.
        
    Session(""sessview"") = """"


        Dim isallowed As Int16
        Dim groupname As String = """"
        Dim adusername As String

        adusername = Page.User.Identity.Name
        'Create an instance of the class 
        Dim objgetgroups As GetGroups
        objgetgroups = New GetGroups
        objgetgroups.ReturnGroups(adusername)
        Session(""Groups"") = objgetgroups.SessionSessGroups.ToString
        isallowed = Session(""groups"").IndexOf(groupname)
        If isallowed &gt; 0 Then

This is the errenous part of my Main class:

		private bool ReadAndValidateInput(out string name, out double price)

				return true;

		}

It's filled to the brim with errors, I know. I tried to change a ton of things to make it work but I probably just made it worse. I simply don't know how to do this assignment because I've never seen a complete use of it. From what the compiler catches at the moment:

; expected after ReadAndValidateName, &amp;&amp; and after ReadAndValidatePrice. Plus a } expected right after the first if Also 'Method must have a return type' at ReadAndValidatePrice, all on the same line. Then 'Expected class, delegate, enum, interface or struct' on both of the lines that have methods. Finally, I have a 'Type or namespace definition, or end-of-file expected' at the bottom, but if I remove a } I get an '} expected' in the same place.

This is the used part of the utility class, the compiler doesn't say anything about errors or warnings in that class.

		public static bool GetInteger(string stringToConvert, out int intOutValue) //Convert a string to an int
		{
			if (int.TryParse(stringToConvert, out intOutValue) &amp;&amp; intOutValue &gt;= 0)
				return true;
			else
				return false;
		}
		
		public static bool GetDouble(string stringToConvert, out double doubleOutValue) //Convert a string to a double

			if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(stringToCheck))

I would be most grateful if someone could point out how it's supposed to look. I know this sounds like 'hey, do my homework!' but I'm completely dumbfounded. If you still don't believe me, then at least give me another example similar to mine. I want to at least see how it's supposed to look.

1362270770.0	19jtwr	SMS payment system - where to start?	bluish_	1	1	4	"Hello /r/csharp,

I'm wondering how to go about programming an SMS payment system, I'm currently working on a project where I'd like users to be able to pay for virtual currency using their phone for small transactions. 

How I'm imagining it to work:

 * User texts a number with EXAMPLE 100
 * User receives a confirmation text explaining the charge
 * User replies with either ACCEPT or DECLINE
 * If user replies with ACCEPT, text them a randomly generated code that will be used to redeem the virtual currency on my website.

I know that what I'm trying to achieve is possible, [here's an example](http://gateway.txtnation.com/solutions/sms/premium/payforit/). There are some third party services available that can do this for me, but I'm interested to see how I could implement it myself - even if only as a programming exercise.

Thanks!


EDIT: In case it's unclear from the original post I want to be able to charge users via SMS. They text a number and are charged an amount of money that's either deducted from their pay as you go balance or added to their contract balance."	t5_2qhdf	True

We're currently doing a project involving cars using Visual Studios 2010 in Windows Form. The point of it is to be able to pick a company, the car model, choose from options and then show all the financing. I'm working with tabs in order to make it look all nice.

Now to get to the point. The company logos are displayed on the first tab page as picture boxes. Once one is clicked on, it will bring you to the next tab page which will display the different models of cars. I want to use the same form to display the models from each company, so I am looking for a way to bring a groupbox from one form to my original form. I know there's a way to have groupboxes on the outskirts of the form and have them moved to a certain point once a picturebox is clicked on, but I'd like to do it this way so that my form isn't all cluttered.

1360075270.0	17xm94	Thoughts on how I can better handle tracking my company's sales rep's commission	gatordrew	1	1	1	"Currently, I have an interface where I select a rep, product category, and location to calculate their commission. So, whenever an invoice comes in I just check that criteria to see if a rep matches it and, if so, apply commission. This has worked for the first 1.5 years since the app went live. However, as our company has grown, some rep contracts no longer are specified as an exact location, but rather criteria such as ""all facilities in Miami, FL"". So, right now whenever we add a new location I have to manually go back in and add commission for that location (if we even remember to do that). 

I know that has to be a better way. But, I'm just not sure how to implement it. My first thought was to have another table that has City and State as columns and then add a trigger on the Locations table, then whenever a Location is inserted it would check that table to see if it matches, and, if so, it would automatically create the Commission record.

Does anyone else have any other recommendations?

Midasx	2	2	3	"So I am taking an array of file paths that are mp3's and passing them to my play function. The play function will play them in sequence by first selecting the song then calculating how long it is then sleeping that long. At which point the loop goes through the next iteration and plays the next track. 

However the way I have it now, the loop just skips to the end track. During my debugging I had a MessageBox popup some information and low and behold this makes it work perfectly. The problem is now I have a MessageBox. 

I figured that the MessageBox was giving the function enough time to calculate the song length and set the delay appropriately, so I tried adding a delay in with Thread.Sleep; however this meant that it just jumped to the last song again with a delay each time!

Here is the code:

        public void play(string[] file)

            foreach (var song in file)
            {

My apologies for the messyness of the code, I've only been learning C# for a week!

I'm not entirely sure using a series of ""if"" statements is the best way to do this but I wanted to at least get it working first.

Some of you may remember my previous post, and I have done plenty of reading since then. I have, somewhat, solved my issue, and now I have something that works. It, however, doesn't seem terribly pretty.

One of my issues was ""A search can return multiple items. In that case, show a 'Duplicate items found, please choose one' dialog"". This I solved with a MultipleItems window, a MultipleItemsVM class, and sending a message called MultipleItemsFound(list_of_items, callback), and I send the message ""MultipleItemsFound(list_of_items, (i) =&gt; Sale.add(i)"". There's a little bit of CodeBehind to make the window appear and hide according to the contents of the DatraGrid. This seems acceptable, but maybe I'm missing something.

This works.

I thought, though, of making a Search Control (in order to encapsulate behavior that will be shared among 3 views/viewmodels), which would consist of a Textbox, and a Popup with a Textbox and a DataGrid. This element has the following behavior: 

* When an user presses Enter, it searches for any items with the code typed into the first TextBox.
      * If no items match, nothing happens.
      * If one item matches, the control's Item binding is changed.
      * If more than one item matches, the popup shows.
* When the user presses F2, all items are searched for, and the popup shows.

* The popup has 2 elements
     * When text is entered into its textbox, the DataGrid is filtered to match.
     * If the user double-clicks on an element, the control's Item binding is set.
     * If the user hits Escape, the popup is closed.

Then, I can just DataBind the Searcher's Item and when it changes, add it to my Sale (actually, it would trigger one of two events: AddItem, and RemoveItem, and it would also have a Count property, since one can type ""2*f00b4r"" to add 2 of some item type).

Should this be a simple, ""stupid"" control? Could/should I make a SearchViewModel and put all behavior there, and have all viewmodels contain (and publish) one of those? Is that making the VM ""too specific""? (Is the VM supposed to work unchanged with WPF and SL, for example? Or am I just making a mess of myself and one is simply supposed to create VMs when changing the view ""drastically""?)

Is this possible/correct/totally stupid? Should I stay with the first solution?

I know I'm overthinking this; I overengineer solutions in personal projects so they become simple when I need to do stuff quickly.

1333021135.0	rj3j8	Getting a 3.5 year old program to run on Win7/.NET 4	grazzhoppa	1	1	2	"I wrote a C# .NET program that targeted .NET version 2 and it worked without error on Windows XP 32-bit.

When I try running it on Windows 7 64-bit, it immediately crashes. I was under the impression that executables generated for the .NET framework would run regardless of the host OS.

The only thing I can think of is that updated versions of the CLR v2 fixed a potentially unsafe operation that was not handled in the versions 3 years ago, and this results in the crash now.

I no longer have access to Visual Studio to debug it. Can anyone help me out and run it through a debugger to see where in the source it's causing the ""overflow exception""?

I got some great feedback from you all last time and made several changes in that regard.

* You can now reference multiple lines in a comment using ""at notation"". If you want to reference line 3 in your comment you would say ""@3"" that will get turned into a link that when clicked will flash line 3 red. If you want to reference a block of code you can type ""@3-5"" that will reference lines 3, 4, and 5. 
* The home page has been reworked to show all reviews (using infinite scroll) you can also optionally filter the reviews by language.
* SSL is used over the whole site to improve security.
* Red comment tabs appear on both sides of a review now so they should be more noticeable. 

Let me know what you think of this latest release.

Calling a method while ignoring the return type would be ambiguous to the compiler. With that in mind, my question is why are static method parameter lists not distinct from instance method parameter lists?

This will not compile and is understandable:

    public class SomeThing
    {
        public void Load(string someString) { }
        public SomeThing Load(string someString) { return new SomeThing(); }
    }
  
  This will also not compile, but I don't understand why:

    public class SomeThing2
    {
        public void Load(string someString) { }
        public static SomeThing2 Load(string someString) { return new SomeThing2(); }
    }

The compiler already seems to distinguish between static and non-static methods. As in, you can't call static methods for a class from an instance of that class and vice versa. Why don't static methods get their own distinct set of parameter lists with respect to method overloading?"	t5_2qhdf	True

So I asked our IT department, and they developed it; it's now almost finished but some things are not working yet. I don't have access to the source code, but I asked for a snippet and found something scaring there, along these lines:

&gt;/\*   number of answer choices \*/

&gt;                            new &gt;Rug.Ws.GameAnswerService.GameAnswerService().LoadAnswerByQuestion((long)questionId);

&gt;        NAnswers = (int) Nanswerdto.Length; 

The web application is some kind of quiz, this code should count how many answer we already got, reading them from the DB. The problem (I think) is that this code loads all this objects into memory just for counting them, which seems crazy to me. Also, the same structure is repeated many times in the code.

So I'm asking:

* is this the right way to count records in a DB in C# ?
* (if no) what is the right way?

I wrote a program that loops through a select amount of pictures, and also shows real-time public transit times. The public transit page is toggable, it can be turned on/off by sending a command to a server that's part of the program. The program is running on a kiosk, so the idea is to remotely control everything.

It worked for about 6 months, but now suddenly the program isn't responding to commands received on the server *unless* I ""get the attention"" by for example connecting with Teamviewer or shaking the mouse. After O do this the command is processed and the page is turned on/off, And continues to do so for a while until it ""falls asleep"" again.

Does anyone recognize the problem, or have suggestions on how to fix it?

It's a C# WPF application. The server is running on a separate thread (there's separate threads for the clock and public transit data retriever as well).

It turns out that it's not just a little bit slower than a basic struct, it's a *lot* slower. The times to access each channel 10,000,000 times on the Color struct and the basic byte struct are:

* Color: 0.196 seconds.

It's even slower if you use one of the built in colours instead of FromArgb(), at 0.355 seconds.

You can see the benchmark code at [https://gist.github.com/Measter/5683984](https://gist.github.com/Measter/5683984).
