TheCrazedMadman	50	1	27	"Maybe the [mix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18D3s_s0di4) I was listening to was REALLY awesome, maybe I'm a little drunk, or Im at the point in my life where Hardstyle is just PERFECT for me. I almost cant handle how much I like this stuff....its a great feeling being surrounded by all this great music I've never been exposed to until now. Now I need some sort of direction on where to go from here...what are some good artists/songs that are essential for a new Hardstyle fan?

Some bands that I listened to before coming here were: Skrillex, Feed Me, Justice, Wolfgang Gartner, Knife Party, Madeon, Zedd, SebastiAn

This is all kind of tripping me out because I have a polar opposite music taste of slow indie rock as well which takes up the majority of my music collection....haha

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses guys! Think I'll be set for at least a month of going though all these artists tracks, time to free up some space on my good ol iPod :D"	t5_2rluz	True

Just because some of the producers are being jack asses doesn't mean we have to be. We decide how we act towards each other so let's try and act mature, since that isn't really happening at the moment. I posted a link to a Frontliner song and it got more downvotes than is regular for this sub, and in the comments every person that said they enjoyed the song got at least 4 downvotes.

This isn't about me missing out on internet points, I just want to keep the good community vibe that is held together by the music. I don't want more debating in here (this post), either. Whoever is right or wrong is not our problem. Hope when I check here tomorrow we have some better vibes

Well, either way.. I see too many downvotes in this subreddit compared to the upvotes. We have 3.3k readers but the Q-Dance survey was the highest post I've seen in quite a while. Personally, I use downvotes only when the content is absolutely terrible and deserves not only to be ignored, but to be downvoted. I see no use in downvoting a track simply because you don't like it, especially in such a small subreddit. Can we try and be a bit better about the voting system? If you don't like a song/post, ignore it. If the post was genuinely bad, downvote it.	t5_2rluz	True

I mean, it's easy to argue that dubstep is a hard enough style and there's a lot of cool tracks within that grene, but I'm a bit baffled by Headhuntrez saying that hardstyle is evolving in the direction of Noisecontrollers remix of Hardwell's tune ""Apollo"".  
  
The hardstyle genre will ofcourse evolve, but claiming that Nisecontrollers version of Hardwell - Apollo is the direction hardstyle is evolving is surprising to me, because it's a little too close to house for my taste to be hard enough to be labled hardstyle. Infact, if the first two songs of Hard With Style 21 is a sort of compass of what direction he want's to take hardstyle, I'd argue that he has to take a look at him self and maybe concider a change of genre.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I love Headhunterz and his music, and he has an amazing talent to produce good tunes.  
I guess the question is when does Headhunterz need to face the fact that some music he finds for his podcast is better suited for his alias Shilo, and not Headhunterz which one of today's biggest and most prominent faces of hardstyle?"	t5_2rluz	True

a)Some new amateur producer linked his or her track and wanted feedback(e.g, the track linked doesn't satisfy you because the producer wasn't good enough)

b)Content is relevant to hardstyle, but isn't actually a hardstyle track

Please stop. The downvote arrow is here to so you guys can actually  filter out content that is not relevant to this sub reddit at all(as in people who post wrong genres in this sub reddit, for example), not to prevent people from receiving feedback on their new track.

Beatmaster180	30	7	57	"Being from the United States, it's become obvious to me that EDM has entered the mainstream.  Just listen to the top 40...there's so much trance and house influences.  Americans are starting to get used to that kind of bassy electronic sound.  Now, when I play/DJ at parties, there's a specific group of people that go crazy when I drop hardstyle.  They are totally taken aback, but then seem to really enjoy it.  People seem to be way more open to harder music now that they've had a taste of EDM.  

A lot of EDM fans in America have heard of the ""term"" hardstyle, but really never listened to it.  The fact that it's entitled ""hardstyle"" makes people its crazy speedcore techno shit, or some kind of sex music or something. But when they actually hear it...totally changes their perspective.  

What do you guys think, specifically fellow American hardstyle fans?

For some reason I can't directly link to the wiki though, I mean I can but it looks like an abomination if I do, I have to look into that another time. Again if you know an artist that is missing I will add them if you tell me who.

The other topic would be what /u/TheMelonKid asked two days ago. Should we do an artist of the week thing?

I personally think a song of the week would work better (either those that were posted or those that were released, I'd prefer the latter).

The other thing that /u/TheKoolKandy suggested was a weekly (or every 2 weeks or monthly) news/discussion thread.

One idea I had was a weekly thread about which tracks had been released, which would be trivial if we're going to vote for a track of the week.

I want to know what you guys/girls think. Should  we do those things? How should we do them? So please speak for yourself, if you don't like the ideas say why and don't just downvote.

Also please upvote for visibility so that I can hear as many oppinions as possible (I don't get karma for text posts).

I've been on this subreddit since I became a redditor and it is by far my favorite subreddit. The community is very friendly towards everyone and is very open for new DJ's trying to earn a name.

Now I still wonder why it doesn't have a nice look. Like the logo is just the Reddit Alien and there is no nice cover whatsoever. 

I am not a designer, so I can't make this happen, but it would be nice if there was someone who could make this subreddit a little bit more beautiful than it already is! Not only the ears want some, the eyes too.

It's a suggestion and feel free to discuss. Thanks for reading.

If this was a hardstyle remix, I would have not been bothered, but this was the original version, which is not at all hardstyle.  This might seem silly to complain about, but Fear.FM has always been my go-to hardstyle station, and I have never heard them play any dubstep or other completely unrelated EDM sub-genres.  Thoughts?

It's almost like this genre loves me as much as I love it, and it's *insane*! Yes, I talk about [euphoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria), the one and only word capable of explaining what it feels like to experience this genre alone.

That being said. I was hoping you guys could help me on the way. Maybe share a song or two that gives you this very same feeling. And also share some old stuff that got you where you are today.

To begin with, I want to share some of the tracks I never seem to get tired of (*fingers crossed*).

For the time being I made 5 pages:

* **Artists**, I'm sure I missed some so let me know if you remember any and I'm also going to add all the soundcloud pages/youtube channels later on.

* **Labels**, same as with artists if you know any I missed please tell me and I'll add them. First I wanted to link to their homepage but some of them don't have any or it's not really being used (i.e. Unite, Digital Age, etc.) so I settled with their (or the artist it belongs to) youtube page.

* **Podcasts**, again if you know any others tell me and I'll add them (link to their youtube/soundcloud page would be nice too).

* **AMAs**, only Audiofreq's for now, I hope we can change that in the future! ;)

And here's where you come in, I made a page for producers that are on our subreddit so if you want to be a part of it make sure to comment with your soundcloud/youtube page (or both) or send us a message and tell us your alias too if you have one but it's not the name of your soundcloud/youtube page.

Edit: [direct link](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/wiki/index)

Edit 2: Of course if you have any questions/suggestions feel free to post them in the comments!

Edit 3: Since there are a lot more labels and artists than I imagined (what was I thinking), I made a small change and put the focus on DWX, Fusion, Scantraxx and Brennan Heart, Coone, DBSTF, Frontliner, Headhunterz, Noisecontrollers, Wildstylez, Zatox on the labels and artists page respectively. So now you still have a list of all (all the ones we can think of atm at least) labels and artists but if you're new you can check out the arguably most popular labels and artists right off the bat. Also started to add the youtube/soundcloud pages for the artists."	t5_2rluz	True

Why?

A easy list of all new and old tracks of artists!

I want to hear more hardstyle in short amount of time.
No more searching if there are new tracks and if you missed a few.
Most tracks get released after one year they had been played, Before you know they excist you had to wait a long time. Thats why official lists can't be trusted.



I could use some help in doing more artists. If **you want to help**, I can add you as a editor of the document. (Thanks)

No new tracks, no new hype for like ages. Then BAM, he joins DWX. What happened this time? Why?

i made a view pictures and videos and would like to share it with you :)

so i´m currently upload my whole videos/pics (about 6 gigabyte) so i have a little timespace to write my story ;)

On 14th of June @ 22:00 we went by car from austria(linz) to the netherlands(amsterdam). 
After checking in, in our hotel in amsterdam and a short lunch we went directly to hardshore festival (also by car).

Hardshore was really awesome and the Therarecords-Stage was such a killer :) 

**Pics of Hardshore:**

[Part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCQ0SGJUKeM&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Hardshore was really awesome but we have been extremly tired of all the long way without sleep (friday 06:00-saturday 24:00 without sleep was very hard) so we had to leave a little earlier but we got a nice sunset on our way home to the hotel - [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/mnPkne3.jpg)

Then we spent Sunday to Friday in Amsterdam and enjoyed our freetime at the ocean - [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/MQogBku.jpg)

So there it was, the day we've waited so long and it was fucking raining...

Parking place and everything went very fine and good, except finding a place for our tent (one tent, just a 3 person tent) after walking two rounds on the camping area we found our place to build our tent, finally.

For all who are interested in prices 1 Token = 2,5 € and here are the pricelists screenshotted out of the iPhone ap:

Saturday was really really awesome....prefix &amp; density killed everything standing at blue stage such an awesome set :) As you all know adaro killed red stage, we met Ran-D in the crowd and made a picture (is on the digital camera @ home not on my phone i will add it later) and a picture with the raw boss b-front :)

There was only one very big disappointment...on saturday we thought...""meh frontliner again? the same set will come up, lets go for a coffee and a muffin""...we were sitting at the camping arena having our coffee and eating some awesome choco muffin when all of sudden...BÄM...the firework starts...DAFUQ?! why would you call a show, a endshow when its on saturday and there is a sunday with a ""closing ritual""?  man, qdance you bitches fucked me really up....hope they post a video of the sunday firework after gunz for hire because this was really awesome :)

Sunday was strange: rainy, sun, rainy, stormy, sun, rainy....we put together our stuff and went to the car to bring the first things back (another night in the tent was unacceptable :D ) and after that we went to blue stage (like every day, best stage on defqon) eating some noodles, drinking a drink an watching hard driver like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/j7OFkN3.jpg)

Then we enjoyed the rest of the day and after the gunz for hire set + fireworks we went back to the car and yesterday @ 14:00 we finally arrived back home such a good feeling in your own bed :)

Harha	12	1	4	"So, I've been learning alot about how hardstyle kicks are made for a few months now and since I've uploaded some of them @ freesound I thought that I might aswell share the link to them here. For pitching them I'd suggest Cubase's own algorithms or FL Studio's slide note function. There's more information about each kick @ freesound...

Feel free to play around with them and even use them in your productions if you wish.

Link to the freesound.org samplepack. (I will probably upload more kicks there in the future.):

1372151112.0	1h10pm	So I recently became spiritual with hardstyle	gooodtimez	10	0	9	"i started listening to calvin harris and old deadmau5 when i was 12. im a month away from being 18 now. two years ago, i fell in love with house at ID festival. then came progressive house when i saw eric prydz at ID festival last year. 6 months ago i become spiritual with trance. and now, i am spiritual with hardstyle and its fucking amazing. 

i was just listening to a D-Block and S-Te-Fan thrillology mix and got lost in a euphoric reflection on my life. I got into it at first, felt the hardstyle vibe. then about 10 mins into it, i thought about when i first listened to EDM, the specific feeling of contentment i felt. It was (Im not alone by calvin harris and deadmau5) then i thought about how i used to watch defqon, edc, and other edm shows on youtube and dreamed of going to a festival. Over the years, I have been to PLENTY of shows. I thought about all the people ive met at shows, the spiritual connection between me and my best friends (and random people) during sets. anyways... there came a time when i was listening (eyes closed, HQ headphones, lying on my bed) when i lost all sense of time and consciousness. i was so deep in a state of euphoria (from the hardstyle) and appreciation. It was like i was naturally looking at all the great things that life has to offer. this continued until the end of the mix.

sidenote: i get alot of anxiety, stress out alot, and over think alot. dont get me wrong, im still outgoing person and always look for fun. but i feel a sense of being held back by stress. school, work, home life, etc. but ill analyze my stress and realize that its not a big load. but yeah, i feel like ive always been ""held back"" by an ""invisible wall"" if that makes sense.   

the reason why im posting this here, is because i want to share with you guys that no matter how stressed you can be, if you feel like you dont have friends, you got fired, you flunked out, you lost someone close, whatever it be... life has a lot of beauty out there. sometimes its hard to find the beauty, sometimes the bad out weighs the good. but does it really?

anyways, at this point im ranting. but guys, try to find the inner beauty that life has to offer. &lt;3"	t5_2rluz	True

I'm sure you all have noticed that so many hardstyle artists use the letter 'z' in place of 's' in their artist names. Besides the possible aesthetic of it making their name look 'cooler' or more unique, why do they choose to do this?

1349354991.0	10xlio	In response to the hardstyle artist AMA thread, let's try to get an artist to do one.	Coffey522	14	2	9	"I was reading the thread about what hardstyle artist we would all want to see do an AMA and I thought maybe we could tweet at one to try and get them to do it. I think we should start off with someone like Technoboy or The Prophet because they have been around since the beginning of hardstyle so it would be pretty interesting to hear from them. They also have a fairly low amount of followers on twitter so we will have a better chance at them seeing it.

Here are the clicktotweet links with a general idea of what to say, of course you can change your message up a bit if you want though.

Technoboy clicktotweet link: http://clicktotweet.me/e2f6vzc1

The Prophet clicktotweet link: http://clicktotweet.me/xLraJdh2

Here is a link to their facebook pages if you want to post on there too.

I notice we have a few shufflers so I was wondering, what is we set a date in the future, lets say, in about a 2 months time, and submit videos of us shuffling and the subscribers vote on who the best shuffler is.

We will also have certain rules applied such as how long the dance has to be and/or what songs we can choose. And what kind of point system we will have. What reward will be given to the winner... Stuff like that. Like, I was thinking, we get to pick two hardstyle songs that we can shuffle too, each being at least 40 seconds long to test our stamina and giving us a basis on what to judge.

Any and all ideas will be welcomed here. We can do this as a community so I'm keeping an open mind. If the mods agree and we have enough people to volunteer too do this then we can start practicing as soon as possible.

I definitely am willing too do this, it's up to the rest of you. I'm just throwing this idea out there, I don't expect it to get anywhere but if it does that would be great. What do you say?"	t5_2rluz	True
