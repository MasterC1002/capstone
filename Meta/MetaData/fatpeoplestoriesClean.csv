1364133009.0	1awv99	Excuse making hambeast in class shut down	Tim8080	3962	472	175	"   In my college English class yesterday we were discussing our final research paper topics. When it was my turn I told my professor and the class that my topic was going to be the obesity epidemic in America. I outline my topic and what points I was going to focus on. All seemed to be going well, the professor approved the topic and I thought that was it.
     I was wrong, in my class we have one hambeast who is about 5,5 and 250lbs.She also brings a drink from burger king each day so i can only assume she eats there as well.She starts to make typical excuses for the obesity problem. Her biggest one was that many including her have injuries. She said she had a bad knee and it prevents her from exercising. What's funny is I got shot a few times in Afghanistan, one of which was to the spine, im in a wheelchair. I lift and exercise all the time and am ripped. I was wearing a tight shirt to show that off that day too.
      I just look at her coldly and say in a flat tone, you have one injured knee, it must be so hard to exercise, I can't imagine how hard it is. Then I grab my legs, wiggle them like wet spaghetti at her. Many in the class laughed or giggled. She turned bright red, sputtered, started to cry and had to leave class. It's one of the few great things about being in a wheelchair, hambeast excuses have no effect on me."	t5_2vzax	True

OK, quick backstory, blah, blah, blah:


Been losing lots of weight. Losing Hamplanet status and becoming Mini-Moon, on my way to true fitness. As I have mentioned in other submissions, I don't like drawing attention to what I have lost so far, as people get defensive or uncomfortable around me. Mostly, they start justifying their food choices. Sometimes, when it is really bad, people get downright bitchy and start acting as thought I am doing something wrong. 


This is the first time an all out fight has occurred. And I blame you, FPS. I. Blame. You. 


***

On Saturday I went for a rare night out with the hubby to a friend's house for drinks. It is always a big occasion when this happens, as we have a couple of young kids and it isn't always easy to find a sitter or arrange a sleepover. Plus, we are kinda homebodies. 


Everything is going well, until one of our friends shows up. He is cool, but his ~~elephant-princess~~ girlfriend is not. She is one of those large women who only stops talking to eat (and half the time, not even then), and always has an opinion that is full of nothing but stupid. She is also a massive bitch. 


The others are generally not that nice to her, to be honest. Not outright mean, but cold. I have always gone out of my way to be nice, because I think their treatment of her is kind of messed up. I am a bit of a softy, when it comes down to it. 


About halfway through the night, one of our friends comments on how good I look. They haven't seen me since Halloween, and I have lost about 40 lbs since then. It is definitely getting noticeable. 


This displeases the elephant-princess, and I can see it coming before she even speaks. I prepare my jimmies to be rustled. 


""I can't believe you gave into that shit,"" she says. 


Now, this isn't what I expected her to say. Not one bit...I assumed she was going to go on her usual diatribe about how she can never lose weight, no matter what she does. Add in the fact that I am drunk, and I am a little slow on the uptake. 


**I didn't see things coming, guys!**


""That dieting bullshit. That we have to be skinny to be happy. It is nothing but a scam by the magazine industry, trying to tell women how to be beautiful.""


""I don't think there is a correlation between obesity and magazines, EP,"" I replied. "" Not conforming to another person's ideal of beauty has nothing to do with improving health and personal confidence by rejecting a bad lifestyle.""


Clearly, I was a fool. 


""Bullshit, OP! Fucking bullshit! Every pound you lose is like a slap in the face to feminists. You are ruining the entire women's movement, and for what? To fit into a size zero?""


[MFW](http://images.wikia.com/glee/images/7/75/Santana_WHAT.gif)


At this point everyone is staring at us, but no one wants to say anything. However, I can see my husband getting pretty annoyed, and he is glaring openly.


""EP, what the hell are you talking about?"" I ask, my alcohol fueled brain not responding properly. 


""You want to look hot, like magazines say you should look to be hot."" She turns to my husband. ""I can't believe you are letting her do this to her body. Not only is it unhealthy, and will cause an eating disorder, but she is going to cheat on you.""


**WHAT?!**


At this point even her own boyfriend (who never says shit) tells her to shut up. But she is just getting started. 


""No! That is what happens? These women lose all this weight for no reason, then they cheat on their spouses because they want people to make them feel pretty. It is nothing but a slut fantasy!""


Losing control....


""And you aren't even healthy. I am definitely more healthy than you, OP. I don't even diet or anything. I eat what I want, because I know it is just a lie by the fashion industry. I'm not some stupid slut who does what I am told like a skinny drone.""


What happens next, I blame on you guys. I had FPS horrors rolling through my mind, and I was just so sick of having so many stories of my own. I was sick of the fat logic, the invalidation of the work I had done, the questioning of my methods and motives, the fact that so many people feel the right to comment on my life choices. I had just had it. 


So I did what I never should have done. 


I let this subreddit merge with real life. 


I entered the FPS Zone.


**""SHUT THE FUCK UP, EP!""**


Yes, I actually shouted this. Or my version  of shouting, which is really talking loudly. 


""I refuse to be lectured on health *or* feminism by Hamzilla, Queen of the Fries! So shut your god damn dickholster!""


OMG, you guys. OMG, I actually said that shit. I am dead serious, you guys. 


Dead silence around us. 


HFW I can't even find a gif that describes it. 


Already, I feel like shit and I am about to apologize. Until she takes a swing at me...and misses. Her hand hits the wall behind my head, she screams, calls me a cunt and leaves. 


Her boyfriend gets up and goes after her. I can actually hear them shouting at the side of the house. We are in the backyard. Then we hear it: 


""THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO FUCK THE WHORE, YOU ASSHOLE!""


All of us stop and look at each other. What? 


Evidently, she had been railing at him for not defending her. He had told her that she should have kept her mouth shut and had been inappropriate. She accused him of sleeping with me (???), and when he said she was being ridiculous told him to prove it by going and calling me out for being a bitch. He said no, she screamed that, and...


...they broke up. 


My FPS caused a breakup, guys. 


***


I don't know how I feel about my interactions with people, lately. I have faced so much scrutiny and backlash since losing weight. Never before have so many people acted so hateful towards me, and I am losing friends fast. Which is making me more and more resentful, hence my epic freak out above. 


Has anyone else ever faced constant criticism when they started losing a lot of weight? Don't get me wrong, I get plenty of encouragement, too. But...Jesus Christ!


Edit: Format.

Edit #2: Jesus Christ...I cannot believe how much attention this has gotten. It was at, like, 200 upvotes. Then I come back and it is currently at almost 550. Not to mention the almost 200 comments. You guys are amazing, and I feel so much better about what happened. 

Seriously, this is the most supportive, caring subreddit around. Major love to every one of you.

1363899563.0	1ar8op	She wanted to ride a horse. 	SometimesIArt	2910	345	237	"Backstory: 

I've always worked in the horse industry, since I was 11. I started that young at a trail riding barn, leading pony rides and such, and stayed there into my late teens leading trails/driving wagons. And because of how long I'd been there I ended up being the barn manager/running the farm because the owners were lazy and wanted nothing to do with the animals. 

This story took place on said farm. 

One morning we get a call in for a party of 5 to go out on a 2hr trail. That requires 7 horses because two guides, and so I grab a couple of the younger workers and we get to work bringing the animals in/getting them ready, etc. No one told us there was a rider with... er... special needs. 

They show up a bit early, which is cool, we're not on a super tight schedule, so I send the workers off to bring out the horses/get the riders up while I finish up saddling the last of them. 

After they go out, one comes back into the barn IMMEDIATELY, pale as a ghost. ""Boss, you're gonna want to come and... meet... the riders..."" 

""Why, is there something wrong?"" 

""Er... yeah... um... just come. Please?"" 

I go out into the ""start"" area and am greeted by 4 overweight-but-not-obese people and 1 woman whose legs I'm not entirely sure existed. She had to be like 450lbs. I panic, knowing that none of the horses we have ready can hold her. They're all around 1400lbs, and they're only supposed to carry MAXIMUM 20% of their body weight (~280lbs tops). 1400lbs isn't exactly a small horse, either. 

I walk up, introduce myself as trail guide, confirm that they were *all* riding, and the bubblebutt woman enthusiastically confirms that they're super excited. I just smile tensely and say ""awesome, well... you're a bit earlier than expected, just give us a few minutes to finish up."" And everyone's super cool. 

I go back to the fields and grab one of the wagon horses. 

[One of these motherfuckers.](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/002/f/7/Percheron_Stallion_Stock_by_AdeliePenguin.jpg)

Manage to find a saddle that will fit him, and load it up with a heavy duty breastcollar so it can't slip sideways. Apologize profusely to the horse and take him out to the riders. He weighs about 1950lbs, still only around a 380lb allowance but it's the best we can do. 

Start matching horses and riders, when Bubblebutt (BB) pipes up ""oooooooh I want the golden one!!"" 

""No, ma'am, sorry that's actually my horse."" Literally mine. As in, I owned her, she was my competition horse I guided trails with to keep her fit. 

""Ahw, surely you can switch up! She's so pretty!"" 

""Ma'am, we paired you up with that one,"" I point to the wagon horse. 

She pauses. She knows full well why that one is hers, and she doesn't like it. ""No, not him, he's too big. I'm afraid of him."" 

""He's super gentle, he'll take good care of you, I promise."" 

""You can't get on a horse that big. Can you even ride something like that? I don't believe you. Why do I have to have the big one?!"" 

Do you really want me to answer that?!

She goes on whining for a while while the others are mounted up. Finally, after debating with her, I end up somehow agreeing to take another one of the same size out to prove that they are perfectly safe. I send one of the workers to take my horse back and grab another Perch (wagon horse) while we get BB up on hers. 

She can't get up like a normal person. Duhdur. 

She refuses to try to get on using the fence. (""I'll fall over the fence! It's too dangerous!"") 

Finally, we lead the Perch out into the picnic area and get her to stand on one of the (thankfully) concrete tables and get up from there. 

She gets up annnnnd.... begins to slide off of the other side. The horse gives me a ""wtf are you doing to me?"" look as I rush around and desperately shove her from the other side, my hands lost in folds of Idon'twanttothinkaboutwhat. 

Crisis averted, she stays on by clinging to the neck. 

Close enough. 

She's mad at me still. Horse is mad at me. 

[hfw](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPhyCc8vYGA/T8_CbBHz2tI/AAAAAAAABpk/IKcERum2rHo/s1600/sad_horse.jpg)

Worker comes back, can't find big enough saddle for 2nd Perch. Have to bareback. BB flies off in a fit about how this farm isn't safe, how I can't do that because how will I even get on, I'm going to fall off, everyone is going to die, her life is in danger, she's going to fall and break her neck... and the kicker: 

""Just because I'm big doesn't mean you need to make fun of me and make me ride this huge mountain!!!"" 

LIVNG. BREATHING. ANIMAL. YOU. FUCK. 

I'm standing there waiting for her to finish and hoping she cancels and storms off. Her family looks embarrassed. The horse looks miserable. The workers don't know what to do. The other guide is waiting for us to go. 

I ask if she still wants to go on the ride. 

""YES. I DO. HORSES ARE MY FAVOURITE. HORSES ARE MY LIFE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR THE THING YOU LOVE.""

Food? Must say nothing. 

I get up (from the ground, you stupid bitch), and she makes a comment about how it'll be so funny when I fall off. Her cell phone is ready to call the ambulance. 

We go out. 

She starts to have fun. 

""I WANNA GALLOP!"" 

""No, we don't do that here.""

""NO FAIR WAAAAAAH."" 

Half an hour in. ""I'm hungry, when are we going back?""

""Hour and a half."" 

""Did you bring snacks?""

""... no.""

""Fine, guess I'll starve."" 

Doubt it. 

Hour in. 

""I'm TIIIIIIRED. I'm SOOOOORE. I'm HUUUUUNGRY. This horse is LAAAAAAAZY. I want to GALLOOOOOOOP."" 

NO WE ARE NOT FUCKING GALLOPING STFU FFS. 

 I've had to yell at her multiple times to stop yanking on the horse's face, too, and threaten to make her walk back if she doesn't stop. Her response? ""He needs to know who's boss!"" 

You sat your fat ass on his poor back, he freaking knows who's in charge. 

We end up taking a shorter way in because she started crying because she was so hungry and angry we wouldn't let her gallop. We get back and it takes both workers and all four of her family members to get her down. 

Ever hear a sigh of relief from a HORSE? Yeah. 

I fed that horse a zillion treats and spent half the night giving him acupressure treatment that day. What a trooper. 

After that we changed our policy to have a serious weight restriction of 300lbs. Farm owners were not happy about it, said it was grounds for discrimination, but I didn't care because that poor animal was sweat-drenched and huffing/puffing by the time we got home... NEVER AGAIN. 

**TL;DR**: Really fat woman wants to go on a trail ride, complains when we have to find the biggest horse on the farm to carry her, bitches the whole time and eventually cuts the ride short because she's too hungry to go on. "	t5_2vzax	True

I was a rock climbing instructor. I helped people survive their way up a 50 foot wall. Twas a normal day, loving life and enjoying what I did while getting my education on. All of the sudden the ground shakes. I look over and a whale of a man walks in. Now, I worked at a fitness center inside a major university... so this wasn't totally uncommon. However, whale-man had his eyes locked on the wall. A wave of fear rushes over me. 

I see him waddle over to the front desk and point at my wall. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. I'm the one who has to belay the monster. That means if (and when...) the whale decides to come off the wall and beach himself, I have to make sure he makes it to the ground softly. [This is me belaying](http://imgur.com/KEU7uw4) for those of you who have never seen it done. Now... there are issues with belaying things that weigh more than you. Rarely an issue for a guy my size, so you can imagine the fear that rushed over me when I realize my trial run was going to be on two of me. I go to the bathroom. Wash my face. It works. Try it. 

I tell the whale I need to know his weight for safety and planning reasons (type of rope, harness, security issues, will I make it out alive questions, etc.). He clocks in at mere 521 pounds. WHY ARE YOU HERE? I put him on the beginners wall. He can't use a stretchy rope. He has to use a shitty non-stretch rope to give him a 10% chance of survival. If he falls, he may break the rope. Fuck me. This means I can't strap to the ground using [these types of straps](http://imgur.com/ghDYeyZ). This means if he falls I'm going to go up when he comes down. This means... shit. This is just bad news. 

The whale takes off. Makes it up three feet, falls. I go up three feet, he goes to the ground. Try again. Three feet. Falls. I go up three feet, he goes to the ground. He's had enough. Thank god it's over. Whale: ""see you tomorrow"". Whatttttttt? 

Tomorrow he's back. Then the next day, and the next and the next. After two months the whale was making it to the ceiling and every time he would fall or let go after a full run, I would go all the way up, he would come all the way down. Turns out it's a pretty good time. 

After one year, the whale dropped so much weight from rock climbing and other areas of fitness that he was talking to doctors about skin surgery to cut off all the excess. He turned into a graceful gazelle, a hawk perched in the air. He went from climbing the children's beginner route to taking on tricky areas, overhangs and inverted sections. 

The whale's name was Greg and he never once complained about how he was too fat to rock climb. He never got pissed at the university for investing over $100k in a rock wall meant for ""skinny people"" (Like me? Ha. Right.). He never said ""I can't"". He just shut up and did it. I liked Greg, despite how much shit he scared out of me the day we met. 

EDIT: Dude is gunna make it. 


**TL;DR** I worked at a rock wall and had to belay a 500+ pound man, fearing for my life the entire time. He lost a lot of weight, got 1/2 descent at climbing and never once complained about being fat. "	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; the time has come

Now my friends, is where your jimmies can be avenged. You've all sat here, at your computer screens, shaking fists in frustration. Cries of ""Beta!"" and ""pushover"" have echoed through the hall. But it is upon us. I wanted you to hold on and experience the naked, greasy justice now.

&gt;Jan nodds and steps up

&gt; ""Yeah, thats not true at all""

&gt;""Hamthrax has been making working here really difficult. She's made advances toward me, and won't let me work. She's also made my girlfriend very upset with some of the things she says.""

&gt;re-tell the dinner fiasco, and explain how she violated my privacy

&gt; other female coworkers start talking

&gt; food stealing, thin shaming, straight-up middle school style bullying

&gt; She starts staring at me

&gt; Look at her

&gt; Whatever

&gt; Keep reading shit on my phone

&gt; She starts breathing more and more heavily

&gt; Ignore her

&gt; She starts coughing

&gt; Keeps coughing and staring at me

&gt; At this point my jonathans are quite rumbled

&gt; Ask her ""do you need anything?""

&gt; ""HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT BEFORE OFFERING YOUR SEAT""

&gt; ""I am not going to offer my seat""

&gt;Pretty quiet night

&gt;Suddenly floors start shaking, chunks falling from the ceiling

&gt;A whole family of Lard Shufflers have walked in off the street

&gt;Mother is a true Hambeast

&gt;Average height, fat rolls everywhere, thighs so big she has to waddle in crablike fashion

&gt;She approaches my counter, face is so fat you can't even see her eyes

&gt;I'm guessing heart attack, stroke, intestinal blockage, diabeetus

&gt;Get her in the exam room, takes three tries to hoist herself onto the exam table

&gt;Fear for table's structural integrity

&gt;Turns out hambeast is here about some sort  of skin condition

&gt;Lifts up her circus tent, exposing muh curves

&gt;Stifle urge to vomit, professional mode engaged

&gt;Take deep breath and investigate indicated region

&gt;Awful looking brown-black growth on midsection

&gt;Oh fuck it looks like a melanoma

&gt;skincancer.trojan

&gt;It is very advanced, it is almost certain the cancer has spread

&gt;Less than five percent survival rate

&gt;Those poor kids, they're going to be orphans

&gt;Look at the little HamMoons

&gt;Only toddlers and already have the curves

&gt;They will probably be better off without the mombeast

&gt;Bring back doctor to examine the cancer

&gt;Puts on latex gloves and engages close examination mode

&gt;Doctor manipulates fat rolls to expose previously hidden belly button

&gt;Inbetween the rolls of fat is a greasy sort of cream cheese coating

&gt;Doctor and I are assailed by fresh wave of putrescent scent

&gt;Doctor turns away and coughs

&gt;Professional mode re-engaged

&gt;The cancer seems to have its origins in belly button

Oh, hello there my round lovelies.I only have a little bit of time before finals eat me alive. Welcome back to the land of Hamthrax, I'll be your guide on our next leg of the tour: the dance of Chocolate Milk Hotel. If you can remember, we left with Hammy and the Bloatedfish embarrassing herself at an important dinner with the bosses looking on. Me and Jan (also know as Fatty Bait, or /u/notbelgianbutdutch) are nice(ish) people with a high tolerance for stupidity in the name of hilarity. To those of you who asked/ expressed concern, I am much better, thank you :). The stomach bug came and went, and I am no longer ""bulimic"". but don't tell that to our friend Hamthrax, or she might freak out and crush a mid-sized Japanese City. 

Cut to early March. Bf has completed his part of the project and is generally  happier person. After the dinner fiasco, Hamthrax had to apologize to the entire department in a meeting in which she reveals that her -wait for it- -waaaaaait for it- - waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiit- THYROID has been causing mood swings and therefore she'll no longer be a dramatic bitch around the office. I don't want to shock you all, but there was about ZERO doctors / medical advice involved in this announcement. According to the manager Jan is friendly with, they've been trying to get rid of her since the Christmas party, but Hamthrax apparently got herself a lawyer and threatened to wage a messy, greasy discrimination suit against them. Raise your hand if this shocks you. 

But now, onto our story: its a lovely, fresh smelling, mayo-less day in the Big Apple. Quick someone tell her it's called that and she'll leave this city forever. Now, Jan, as much as I love him, can be literally the most forgetful person in the entire world. This day he left his lunch, his phone, and his keys in the apartment. I had only morning classes that day, so I dropped by to give him his stuff and have lunch while I was at it:

&gt;be me 

&gt;be dressed in black jeans, black shirt, black cardigan and converse.

&gt;run up to office, no sense in taking elevator

&gt;office is on the 6th floor

&gt;walk to bf's cubicle, but am stopped by gale force winds 

&gt;try to keep a grip on all loose clothing

&gt;trouble breathing

&gt;hang onto nearest wall and inch forward

&gt;there she is

&gt;my one and only super sized deluxe ice cream surprise

&gt;sitting on SideDish's desk in the next cubicle over

&gt;swinging leg, causing winds to send paper flying every which way

&gt;munching on large fries and what smells like General Tsao's chicken, but its white 

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/Y21P5Pa.gif) I see the ranch dressing bottle next to her

&gt;have a panic attack as I see bf with his head buried in his keyboard

&gt;did she finally managed to suck out his insides for her mating ritual?

&gt;PrayingMantisScienceTeacher.bffy

&gt;run up to him, ignoring primal howl from Miike Slow

&gt;shake his shoulders

&gt; he jerks up like a vet in the middle of a PTSD dream

&gt; relieved when it is just me and not Hammy Davis Carl's Jr. 

&gt;whispers ""she's been here all break""

&gt;hollering in graphic detail about her recent conquest

&gt; teehee'ing at every possible junction not occupied by food

&gt; grab his hand and make our way to the break room

&gt;packed some leftovers

&gt;we're literally two steps from the cubicle 

&gt;""hey SIDEDISH, you know how EMO girls are always bulimic?""

&gt;SideDish doesn't respond

&gt; me and bf almost start giggling

&gt; ""YEAH SKINNY WHORES""

&gt;Jan almost turns around, but I grab him and we race walk away

&gt;break room is kind of small, two small tables, two chairs each

&gt;eating facility is downstairs, but we don't have that much time

&gt; microwave two portions 

&gt;Jan grabs forks and glasses of water and sits down at one of the tables

&gt;smellslikeheaven.tofu

&gt;hear the floorboards moaning

&gt;yup, what a shock

&gt; Depeche a la mode's diabetes senses are tingling

&gt; literally just pull the plate out of the microwave

&gt;Mumford and Scones is still clutching her tray of ranch-mutilated chinese

&gt; tosses her massive body into one of the chairs

&gt;it's comrades weep for the poor piece of furniture

&gt;bagpipes can be heard through the room

&gt;Fatboy Not-So-Slim ( I see you, throwaway47351) gives me a smug look 

&gt; is clearly pleased with her cunning manipulation of the seating

&gt;Hamthrax used Being A Fat Cunt!

&gt;it's not super effective

&gt; i struggle to keep a straight face as I head to the other table

&gt;bf scoops up water and forks and moves with me

&gt; Bruno Mars bar looks shocked her brilliant move did not keep me from enjoying my food with bf

&gt;JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaAAAn

&gt;millions of Dutch vomit in the streets

&gt;JAAAAaaaAAANN come sit with MEH I WANNA TELL YOU SOMETHING

&gt;almost pass out as her ranch/chinese breath hits us

&gt; Jan looks over his shoulder and asks her if it's about her ""boys""

&gt;""TEEHEE NO……. WELL YES ITS ABOUT YOUUUUUUU""

&gt;winks and I gag

&gt;""THERE SHE GOES JAN, DONTCHA WANNA SIT OVER HERE""

&gt;nope.nlogo

&gt;Nat King Coleslaw takes what was supposed to be a sexy bite of her chicken, biting down on the plastic fork so hard it snaps

&gt;""OOPPS TEEHEE""

&gt;we can't help but stare as we eat

&gt;she spits out the plastic, then *sucks the ranch-chicken-saliva off the shards*

&gt;jesustakethewheel.exe

&gt;we start shoveling food into our mouths to get out of there

&gt;""WATCH OUT roomsgotrooms, ITS GONNA BE PAINFUL THROWING THAT ALL UP""

&gt;stops only when the music playing from the small radio in the corner chages

&gt;combines ""sexy roll"" with ""look at from under eyelashes""

&gt;resulting dance move sends us both into hysterics

&gt;she just starts singing louder

1369077423.0	1epmtg	Holy shit guys, I can't stop laughing.	SometimesIArt	2010	393	525	"Oh my gosh guys. I just can't right now. 

Because. 

I put [this list](http://i.imgur.com/6YGLOE2.jpg) up on my fridge because everyone has officially announced they want to be healthier in my household (even British Roommate!). I took note of the most common things everyone in the house eats, looked up their nutrition info, and made a snazzy two-page list. 

And everything. 

Everything. 

That Eventual Planet eats is super high cal. 

Granola, bacon, eggs, butter, cheese, hollandaise sauce, homo milk, fries, ice cream, alcohol, cookies, muffins (oh god, the muffins…), pancakes, burgers, bread, pizza, cream sauce, sugary Starbucks… 

Everything.

She thought I was making numbers up to prove her wrong. Bitch broke my computer a few days ago and has been itching to go off on me since I made her pay for it.

She got SO mad at me when she saw the list, insisting she's been eating *so* healthy and hasn't lost weight (in like 5 days of ""dieting""). Said that it *proves* she's MEANT to be the weight she is at. 

Anyways.

Right now, she's currently *screaming* at Google. Screaming. At her laptop. Because she's trying to prove the list wrong and Google is confirming everything I wrote down. 

She just realized she chucks back over 3500cal/day. Oh my gosh. I feel like a horrible person for laughing so hard. But she won't stop yelling at Google. 

""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN 500 CALORIES?!"" 

""GRANOLA'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUCKING HEALTHY!"" 

""DAMMIT WHAT THE FUCK THERE'S NO WAY I CAN ONLY HAVE THAT MUCH SUGAR A DAY! BULLSHIT!"" 

""BUT IT'S *VEGGIE* PIZZA!"" 

She is so mad at real life right now guys. 

And she's shouting all of it through mouthfuls of grilled cheese with bacon in it.

Oh shit. My sides. I can't breathe. Oh my gosh. This feels so good. 

*Maybe she'll freaking make it now.* If this doesn't give her a heart attack in the next hour. 

Last story from her [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dvy85/eventual_planet_wants_a_summer_body/). Man. Ugh. I'm sorry, I wasn't going to post much more about her, but oh man, this is too much. "	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;5 mins later

&gt;Horrified. Shocked. Scared.

&gt;I might be a full-fledged FPS hamplanet in a few years.

As you know, we fat people hate being reminded of our bad habits. So I was agitated (side note: agitated fatties are kind of fun to watch).

&gt;later in the day...

&gt;in car, driving on highway 

&gt;asking lots of questions of myself - lots of ""Why?""

&gt;Encountering fatty logic excuses, start shooting them down.

&gt;""I'm addicted to food.""

&gt;Fuck that, people can break heroin addictions, I can break a Big Mac addiction

&gt;""It's just so hard to lose weight.""

&gt;Damn straight, if it was easy everyone would do it.

&gt;""I hate working out because I look dumb doing it.""

&gt;Fuck the haters, they're not worth my time.

&gt;get to the bottom of this.

&gt;core of feels at the center of the hamplanet

&gt;""I don't deserve good health.""

&gt;THE FUCK I DON'T. THAT'S BULLSHIT. FUCK. THAT.

Rest of the day, bought meat/veggies at the grocery store, ate salad for lunch and dinner, and went for a walk. Feels good.

So I guess.... thanks FPS? Wish me luck.

**For part 4 of this delectable saga, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ilk5s/tales_from_it_pt4_muh_conditions_are_reeeal/)**

For those of you who are just *tooooo* disabled to read my previous installments, I had just stumbled home after besting Mr DesperateRomantic at his game of trying to falsely accuse me of reporting sexual harassment against ShyIntern, by Lard Lover. However, before leaving work for the day, Lard Lover had sent out emails to both myself, my Dept. Head and the Head of HR threatening to have us fired, and to sue us for discrimination against her 'disability', time lost and expenses occurred due to ~~I don't fucking know~~ loss of lunch time, I'm guessing.

&gt;Wake up after night of heavy drinking to erase memories

&gt;Ha, no hang over!

&gt;Get up

&gt;Not as bad as I was expecting

&gt;Codine, save me

&gt;Have my usual breakfast of weetbix and news

&gt;Half expecting to hear my phone *bzzz* at any moment

&gt;Manage a bus trip all the way to work without an 'urgent' email from Lard Lover

&gt;novomit.yay!

After drearily arriving at my work, almost forgetting the events of the previous day (my plan for alcohol based memory erasure was only a few pints off from working completely), I manage to make it to my floor before seeing the cluster fuck that was about to assault my pre-chai morning sensibilities.

&gt;Peer into my Dept. Head's office

&gt;See Lard Lover and another man, close to her size, sitting down

&gt;Well, I'll be asking to order two new chairs then

&gt;I stare in, amazed that she had actually brought in a lawyer

&gt;Dept. Head subtly looks at me and shakes his head

&gt;Begin giggling from the absurdity of the situation

&gt;Make it to my desk and some chai before Dept. Head finally texts me

&gt;""Got lawyer from Lard Lover. Come 'ASAP'""

&gt;lel, he wants to waste as much time with this lawyer as possible

&gt;Lard Lover paying hourly premium for that bloke

&gt;Decide to go around and help some interns with basic tickets, before sauntering off to Dept. Head's office

As I walk in, I notice that my Dept. Head can barely keep a smile from his face. Relaxed by the thought that any charges she may make against me will be just ridiculous, I lean casually against the door frame.

&gt;""Sorry for interrupting your important work [me], but unfortunately Lard Lover has decided to waste our department's time by coming here with her lawyer, instead of going straight to HR to deal with this matter""

&gt;""HOW DARE YOU. That BITCH has caused me considerable emotional and financial damage! I demand that you at least demote her to the position she really deserves""

&gt;""So suddenly YOU think that you have the right to dictate to me, how I should treat my department members?""

Lawyer interjects at this point...

&gt;""We think it would be a sign of good faith by this company to at least put [me] on suspended leave until the matter is dealt with""

&gt;""Well, I think it would be a sign of good faith that you don't expect me to suspend one of my few higher support people, simply because Lard Lover demands it. In fact, if Lard Lover had told us the real problem with her computer, instead of turning it into an ""urgent"" case, none of us would be here""

&gt;""I think we're done here. Lard Lover, lets go up to HR where they will actually listen to our demands""

The lawyer and Lard Lover waddle off. I just burst into laughter as they're close to leaving ear shot, and close the door behind me to talk to my Dept. Head

&gt;""So, do you think they even have anything against us?""

&gt;""Not a chance in hell. Sure, they might try and drag it through the courts, but with the sexual harassment charge that HR are pushing through mighty fast, they don't have a leg to stand on""

&gt;*quietly* ""Not that they can barely stand on their own damn legs""

I go back to my duties, mostly helping interns with tickets, as there had not been any catastrophic failures with equipment recently. 

&gt;*bzzz*

&gt;Please be a catastrophic failure...

&gt;""[Me], Please come up to HR Dept. Head's office 'ASAP'""

&gt;Hot damn, even the HR Dept. Head is in on wasting this persons time as well

&gt;Hear later that my Dept. Head had contacted them as he was dealing with Lard Lover's lawyer, telling them to try and stall as much as possible

&gt;Giggle continuously as I help through 2 more tickets, and then jump in the lift

&gt;What's this?

&gt;Lard Lover and her Lawyer are leaving?

&gt;Dat waddle

&gt;Avoid any eye contact with me

&gt;See them waiting outside the lifts

&gt;Kind of just stare, not quite realizing what I'm doing

&gt;""YOU FUCKING SKINNY WHORE, YOU THINK YOU'VE WON, DON'T YOU?""

&gt;Deer in the head lights...

&gt;""WELL I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY. I'LL SPREAD YOUR NAME. BELIEVE ME, I WILL FUCKING END YOUR CAREER, IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT THAT, YOU FUCKING IT LACKEY""

&gt;Actually begin to laugh

&gt;This enrages the beast

&gt;She... charges?

&gt;Speed waddle, more like it

&gt;""YEAH, YOU CAN'T FIGHT THIS SHIT. I WILL BEAT YOUR ASS DOWN TO A PULP""

&gt;Slowly back towards HR Dept. Head's office

&gt;She keeps following, bellowing obscenities

&gt;HR Dept. Head storms out to see what the commotion is about

&gt;""LARD LOVER. Consider your suspension canceled, and your contract terminated! Get you and your pile of shit out of this building, and I'll be sending you the cost of an entire renovation team to refurbish and repaint that disgusting office of yours""

Lard Lover stops in her tracks, trying to figure out her next move. I could almost see her face turn blue.

&gt;""You've REALLY hit shit this time, defending that fucking whore. Discrimination brings a lot of bad press. If you hire me back, I won't drag you through the courts and the media. I can tell you, Today Tonight will side with me!""

&gt;HR Dept. Head actually bursts into hysterics

&gt;""I'll get a REAL lawyer this time! I'll fucking make sure you all don't have jobs! I hope you enjoy being disgusting hobos, you cunts""

&gt;Oh shit, she said the 'c' word

&gt;It may be in Australia, but you don't say that in the workplace

&gt;HR Dept. Head speed dials someone

&gt;""Security, there are two people I need escorted from the building, along with their belongings. Bring plastic bags, and don't allow them to use our bins""

&gt;""YOU WON'T BE GETTING US TO LEAVE HERE WITHOUT AN APOLOGY AND A COURT DATE""

&gt;I don't think she understands how this works

&gt;Wait... she said a 'real' lawyer?

&gt;Security finally arrives, takes them off

I go and sit to calm my nerves in HR Dept. Head's office, and ask what the hell happened before I managed to make my way up there. After a few long breaths, recovering from a fit of laughter, we talk.

&gt;""Well, turns out that lawyer she had... it was her brother, pretending to be a lawyer. She was claiming all sorts of charges to be leveled against the company, and demanding your resignation. I'm guessing she couldn't get a real lawyer to take up her case, so she tried to scare us into giving her a settlement""

&gt;""HA. So there won't be anymore from her?""

&gt;""Not if she is smart about it, which she probably isn't. I'll have the legal team notified of her transgressions, and see if we can take her, or her brother to court, for pretending to be a lawyer or something. I don't know, legal will deal with it""

&gt;""And what about Mr DesperateRomantic?""

&gt;""He was put on suspension, pending an internal audit of his work. I don't expect that he will pass our standards""

&gt;(2 months later now, and the audit is still ongoing)

&gt;""Anyway, [me], I'll let you get back to your work. I know [My Dept. Head] is needing as much support as he can. I might see if I can get a few higher support guys for you""

And there, my little munchkins, is where my saga comes to a close. I heard from the security guys that Lard Lover and her brother tried to get rid of the rubbish they cleaned from her office by stowing it in our industrial bins. The security officers forced them to pile them into their cars, and leave the building entirely. Imaging them in their cars, with bags of garbage around them just made my fucking day. I doubt they disposed of them properly, but hey, it was gone.

Facilities is still trying to get Lard Lover to pay for the cost of refurbishing her entire office. Nothing was salvageable... the desk was completely warped, her super expensive 'disability friendly' chair was too disgusting for words, and I didn't even bother trying to save her computer. That was the most fulfilling throw away job I've ever done. 

And don't worry your little bums about lack of more stories. I wrangled a few from some of her PTSD suffering colleagues, over a few pints of cider. There's no therapy like pub therapy.

1374367455.0	1iq3tw	FAT IS A DISABILITY	sugarelf	1974	539	218	"I work one on one as an aide with a very lovely woman who has quite a few physical disabilities. She doesn't speak verbally but she's incredibly intelligent and uses a machine to speak for her. Her wheelchair is petty large and to get in and out of my van we use a lift system. This morning we headed out to Walmart to do some early back to school shopping. She is SO excited and hellllll yeah, we didn't even have to circle the lot a million times to find a handicapped space with the extra area for her lift. Life is going well. 

As we're leaving however my girl starts having seizures. Oh shit. We dash to the van to get her emergency meds and don't you fucking know it some cunt is parked in the area for the lift. Are you fucking kidding me. The medicine to stop the seizure is in the form of a gel that goes in rectally, and I'm not flipping her over and shoving something up her ass in a parking lot. I grab the meds from the other side and run back in the store with her straight to the bathroom. I get the seizure to stop, get my girl settled, and head to find a manager. They announce over the speaker system that the person blocking our van needs to move IMMEDIATELY. 

We go back outside and wait. And wait. 5 min goes by, ok. Well maybe they forgot their placard and they're not just an asshole and are moving slowly because they are disabled.. 15 minutes goes by.. Wtf.. My girl is starting to nod in and out and I need to get her home to rest... 25 minutes.. I start considering  going back in to ask again.. But lo and behold a couple of the biggest lardasses I've ever seen in my life are shuffling their meaty thighs in my direction with one cart full of processed bullshit and another with nothing but stacks and stacks of boxes of diet coke. 

Attempting to hold my rage back, I say ""Excuse me... You know that this area is for wheelchairs and lifts, right? My friend can't get into our van until you move your car. We've been waiting over a half an hour."" 

The one I assume is female starts to turn an even deeper shade of red and roars ""THIS SPACE IS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITAHS. IM HANDICAPPED AND I NEED THIS SPACE HOW DARE YOU TRY TO RUSH ME WE DON'T MOVE AS FAST AS PEOPLE LIKE *YOU*"". 

I apologize and say their placard isn't up and being disabled they should understand the frustration of not being able to have the accommodations they need and would they please move their goddamn car so we can leave. 

This sends the wild beetusbeast into a frenzy ranting and literally spitting about how they know ALL about not getting the accommodations they need because they were denied a placard and how fat discrimination at the hands of thin people is LITERALLY the worst thing anyone could ever face. As I'm trying to keep my cool and politely repeat to this fucking grease ball that she needs to move (I'm working.. Don't yell.. I'm working... Don't smack her...) I notice my friend going to town on her communication device. 

""I am disabled. You are fat. Move your fucking car."" 

The look on this woman's face was the most priceless and beautiful thing I've ever seen and I love the girl I work with so much. 

After a few minutes of stuttering and ""FAT IS A DISABILITY"" grunts the guy she was with finishes loading the car and they were off. 

My girl is still smirking about it. 

Edit: Since people keep asking - letting her chill and backing the van out wasn't an option. The wheelchair is a pain in the ass and the brakes don't work. The parking area has a slope to it. I couldn't find a spot that was both within my line of sight and not against a car or something to have her wait. She and I would both rather wait than be out of sight from each other or at risk of rolling into traffic in a situation like this. Please stop messaging me about what a terrible aide I am.

&gt;Be me working at a cardiology clinic with an endocrinology clinic above us.  

&gt;Be calling a patient, NW, to schedule a nuclear stress test.  

This test is a cardiac stress test, you receive a nuclear isotope and this circulates through your blood stream.  Weight matters in this test as it is a 3-5 hour test so there needs to be enough of the isotope to last in your system for the imaging. 

&gt;[mfw](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TFb2XGhT2GM/UZJ4C5GKf0I/AAAAAAAAC60/PbfmS-j0BPM/s400/HarryPotter-Shock.gif) I find patients weight in chart.  489 pounds!

&gt;Over 300 pounds means a two day protocol as the isotope will leave the system before all imaging is completed.

&gt;500 pounds is to big to fit in the machine.  Since we're so close I have to speak with the nurses to make sure that this is going to be ok.  [pain in my ass](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1wzn2KAx91r2e1lj.gif)

&gt;Get everything ok'd, call NW. 

&gt;Female answers phone, I ask for NW.

&gt;Dis his wife, wat you want?

&gt;I'm calling to schedule a stress test.

&gt;To save on boring details, she asks NW about it, he yells for her to deal with it. This man already sounds like a petulant teenager, he's 47.

&gt;Schedule appointment, explain two day protocol.

&gt;[mfw](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5hfozZZ5O1r86gmto1_400.gif) I have to explain the preparation for the test.

&gt;NW needs to know that he can't have any caffeine for 12 hours before the test and no food or water for 4 hours prior.

&gt;NW wife: WAT!? He can't go that long without food.

&gt;Braying in the background: I HAVE TO EAT!  DIABEETUS! I WON'T DO THE TEST!

I should note that while this is not an ASAP you're going to die sort of test, there is some sense of urgency.  The doctor is concerned enough to order it, which means he wants to know what's going on pretty quickly.  It's rare, but patients have died from preventable problems because they haven't gotten in soon enough to take this test.

&gt;Explain that he can bring a snack but it's very important he doesn't eat or have caffeine.

&gt;(all in the background while his wife is trying to talk) I CAN'T GO THAT LONG WITHOUT FOOD! I'LL DIE!  NO ONE CAN GO THAT LONG WITHOUT FOOD!

&gt;Me: whatever, I'm hanging up.

&gt;Be several months later after some 12 cancellations and no shows of a rather difficult to schedule test that other people also need to have but can't because this guy waits till 5 minutes before to cancel so no one else can have the spot.

&gt;lightbulbs flicker. 

&gt;glass in the door rattles.

&gt;Hear ""Oh shit."" from a small frail man standing near the door, he hightails it to the back 
of the room with his walker.

&gt;NW squeezes through the door in all of his glory.  

&gt;[Nggghhh](http://replygif.net/i/253)

&gt;Motherfucker has THREE large grocery bags of ""snacks"" with him.  THREE.

&gt;Think, wow, that's excessive.  

&gt;Wife enters behind him.  She has the sodas.  Oh god, the sodas.  

&gt;FOUR more bags!

&gt;I vow to never eat anything but veggies ever again.

&gt;I thankfully do not check him in, but to say he's not happy about not eating or having his precious soda is an understatement.

&gt;be two hours later.  NW has been complaining and huffing and puffing about his beetus and his overwhelming hunger the entire time. He has maybe 30 more minutes to being able to eat.

&gt;There is a family with three small children, the mother is also having a stress test and they've been there for an hour

&gt;Father leaves to get lunch for the family, returns with sandwiches and a box of cupcakes for the kids.

&gt;[NWfw](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo5hqwpxNy1qh40pv.gif) he sees those delicious frosted treats.

&gt;NW is silent the whole time the family is eating, staring.  The father is clearly uncomfortable with the attention and is inching his children further away.  

&gt;Children start on the cupcakes.  They are young and messy and these are giant frosted mountains.  There is frosting EVERYWHERE.

&gt;Mother fucker is going to eat those children, I know it.

&gt;NW gets up and leaves the room, I assume to scream at the nurses again.

&gt;Fire alarm goes off.

&gt;We evacuate the waiting room, everyone in the building is out in the parking lot within a few minutes.

&gt;Almost everyone.

&gt;NW and wife are missing.

&gt;I go back inside.... 

&gt;NW IS EATING THE CHILDRENS CUPCAKES.

&gt;HE PULLED THE FIRE ALARM TO STEAL CHILDRENS CUPCAKES.

&gt;I thought people only stole candy from kids in movies!

*edit* It is ridiculously difficult to evacuate a clinic full of actual sick and very old people who are in the process of testing.  This makes it an even bigger douche move.

&gt;He looks me straight in the eye unapologetically and opens his 2 liter and guzzles the entire thing and reaches for another cupcake.

&gt;Father comes back inside with children, children cry as this hamplanet has eaten their food, father begins to yell at NW.

&gt;Cue fatlogic!

&gt;They're small and don't need to eat like I do! I have the BEETUS and my sugars is low!

&gt;Father goes to grab the cupcakes.

&gt;NW gives guttural cry and tries to hide the cupcakes behind him, shoving the father away.

&gt;[mfw](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8vx1nOGnT1r9ixyz.gif) father punches NW in the face and grabs the cupcakes back.

&gt;Oldest girl runs up and kicks NW in the knee.  

In the end NW was arrested for pulling a false fire alarm and petty theft.  When NW tried to say the father punched him, we all said that we saw NW steal the cupcakes and shove the father and nothing else.

tl;dr: 500 lb patient furious he'll be denied food for test, after 2 hours steals cupcakes from children, assaults father.  

*edit* Or as [britta__perry](http://www.reddit.com/user/britta__perry) so eloquently put it; He endangered lives to steal candy from a baby after months of fucking over patients who need procedures done.

**For part 3 of my tasty saga, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1iiyoh/tales_from_it_pt3_desperation_knows_no_bounds/)**

Again, for those of you with *condishuns* who just *can't* read the previous stories I posted, I am about to, again, take Mr DesperateRomantic from HR, head on, for ignoring my report of sexual harassment against my ShyIntern by Lard Lover, and making false charges for bullying and false claims against Lard Lover, who, in my previous saga, managed to turn me into an alcoholic through several hits to my sanity. 

&gt;I see the game you're playing, Mr DesperateRomantic

&gt;Still stunned from the barrage of shit piled on me by this one HR manager

&gt;Got the Dept. Heads on my side at least

&gt;Yeah that should count for something

I sat in my office, trying to conjure up a way to call Mr DesperateRomantics bluff. Accusations like this could end careers. There is no way I'm letting my hard work here go to waste, and have ShyIntern have to put up with more sexual harassment. 

&gt;Getting close to the end of the day

&gt;About 45min after the PTSD causing events of the last post occured

&gt;3pm chai tea, always a good choice

&gt;See bathroom

&gt;Waves of fear and disgust overcome me, put milky chai down

&gt;Look into the stalls again

&gt;Dear god the evidence is still there!

&gt;Still there...

&gt;....HA

&gt;Call my Dept. Manager, tell him to bring down HR's Dept. Head, urgently

&gt;""Goddamn it, we got here as fast as we could. What's up? Is it something to do with Mr DesperateRomantic?""

&gt;I nod solemnly, and lead them to the scene of the crime

&gt;Both Dept. Heads burst out into laughter. The smear of makeup had the clear, thick blue colour Lard Lover wore as eye shadow. Similar to [this](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/quiz/46319_1218334023690_241_300.jpg)

&gt;I wish I could laugh

&gt;1000yardstare.iso

After seeing the destruction and the two clearly used condoms, they asked if I knew who was responsible, and if I was able to go on record to say who it was. I agree, and go with the HR Dept. Head to give my 'testimony'. I felt like I was a witness to a crime against humanity

&gt;Oh lift music, how calming you are

&gt;Walk around HR's floor

&gt;Walk past Mr DesperateRomantics office

&gt;See Lard Lover, squatting in the spare chair, fresh from her Sizzlers trip

&gt;Had a take away container

&gt;2ltr bottle of diet coke, half finished

&gt;Mr DesperateRomantic see's us walking by

&gt;Never seen a deer in the headlights, but I'm sure his face will be the closest I've ever come

&gt;Scoot off to the Dept. Head's office

&gt;Corner office view, so lovely

&gt;Please, landscape, take away the memories

I tell all to the Dept. Head, who was miffed about having to be dragged into this at all. I also mention Lard Lover has claimed disability within the company, without actually providing proof to HR. Most importantly, I recounted the accusations leveled at me regarding Lard Lover claiming I made a false accusation against her sexually harassing ShyIntern. This did not settle well. 

&gt;""Why on earth was I not told beforehand?! Any false accusation claims come directly to me""

&gt;""Maybe you should ask Mr DesperateRomantic""

&gt;Please let Lard Lover still be there

&gt;Please, Please, Please, Please...

&gt;YES

&gt;""Mr DesperateRomantic, why is Lard Lover in your office? Has there been another complaint?""

&gt;""N-No. She is here t-to finish her lunch""

&gt;""She has been on lunch since about 12 when I saw her leaving for McDonalds. Lard Lover, why are you not working?""

&gt;Lard Lover takes another, very slow, ""sexy"" bite of her crispy potato skins and sour cream

&gt;*HHURRRRGGGLLLLLL*

&gt;""WELLL, You SHOULD know about my *disability* that requires me to have more energy input than other people""

&gt;""Well, there is nothing on file... there hasn't been any disability of yours on file for 8 years, but apparently for 5 of those, you've claimed that you've been disabled. Tell me, how did you manage to get past HR's protocol?""

&gt;""Mr DesperateRomantic said that he had everything sorted out for me!""

&gt;""Well, nothing is up, and we've got internal auditing on our ass asking why we gave you any special privileges without documentation""

&gt;""THIS IS DISCRIMINATION. ITS CLEAR THAT I HAVE A CONDITION. Mr DesperateRomantic said he would deal with this!""

All three of us look towards Mr DesperateRomantic, who looked like he was trying his hardest not to jump from his window to a very timely death. He had been found out. For something I thought had only been going on for 5 months at the most, it turns out that for 5 years, this cow had managed to swindle benefits from the company for a non existent disability. The HR Dept Head layed into him.

&gt;""I-I've delt with t-the disability of Lard Lover f-for a while n-now... s-she had proof b-but lost it""

&gt;""So you saw the proof, didn't scan it, and then somehow thought that internal auditing would just let you get away with it? I don't even know how you managed to keep it up for 5 bloody years""

&gt;""IT'S BECAUSSE MY CONDITION IS REEEEAL""

&gt;""And what IS your condition, considering it was never actually recorded""

And there was silence. 30 seconds of the most delightful, fulfilling silence I had ever experienced. It was the silence that let me know that everything was going to be ok, that I would win this, that I would be able to eat tuna casserole and chai tea again.

&gt;""Well, I've never seen you use insulin, and you've never asked for a sharps disposal box for the office like a few of our other diabetic employees have, so it can't be that. Does that help narrow it down for you?""

&gt;HR Dept. Head has gone full alpha

&gt;Need to wipe my nose to hide my shit eating grin

&gt;""YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW, THAT INFORMATION IS PRIVATE""

&gt;""But you've managed to claim several thousand dollars worth of benefits and equipment, which you have summarily destroyed, from your 'disability'. If you can't tell me, or even Mr DesperateRomantic what your disability is, with a doctors certificate as proof, within the next 7 days, you will be subject to a RIGOROUS internal review. I hear from your Dept. Head that you've been doing very poorly indeed, and that Mr DesperateRomantic is the only reason you're still here""

&gt;""EXPECT TO HEAR FROM MY LAWYER IN THE MORNING, YOU STUPID DICKHEAD""

She left the room. Well, when I say that, she struggled to get out of the chair she was in, cracked the armrest (as she did with the other one she sat on), threw her take away container at the HR Dept. Head, and slammed the door behind her.

&gt;""Mr DesperateRomantic, we're going to need to have a talk. [Me], you can return to your duties now. Thanks for your help""

&gt;Leave feeling triumphant as fuck

&gt;Make new chai

&gt;Get back to desk

&gt;Text SO to meet me at the pub later

&gt;All is good, for now

&gt;*bzzz*

&gt;Huh, maybe a problem with a comp-

LOLNOPE

&gt;""I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT YOUR TIME AT THIS COMPANY HAS ENDED. [HR Dept. Head] CAN'T PROTECT YOU NOW, I HAVE THEM AROUND MY FINGER. YOU SPITEFUL BITCH, I WILL MAKE SURE YOU NEVER WORK IN IT AGAIN. YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYER TOMORROW, AND EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED WILL PAY. YOU'VE INVADED MY PRIVACY, DISCRIMINATED AGAINST MY DISABILITY, AND FORCED ME TO HAVE UNNEEDED EXPENSES. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU IN COURT.""

&gt;Put down the chai. Get out the flask

&gt;Wonder if she realizes this is a COMPANY email

&gt;Sigh, and call in my Dept. Head

&gt;""So, what's the protocol for dealing with *this*""

&gt;Show him the email

&gt;""Well, I guess we'll have to see if she actually gets a lawyer, won't we?""

And there, my munchkins, I leave you again. I headed down to the pub to get blind drunk with my SO and a few mates who felt my pain dearly. Many jimmy's were rustled, and many more will be settled. And hey, today I really don't have anything to do, so I *might* post the next saga sooner. Or I could starve you all, like the thin privileged whore I am! Haha!

Hi again, FPS. I once again apologize about my long absence, (I have been reading when I can, but haven't had the time to write.) I will say that at least this time, I have a good excuse for neglecting to feed you sweet, sweet hams.

You see, I live in Calgary, AB. We have been the victims of some [serious flooding](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/06/20/pictures-and-videos-of-massive-flooding-in-canmore-and-southern-alberta/) lately, and, well, I didn't fare so well. I live very near to the Elbow River, which is one of two main rivers that runs through the city. I also happen to live in a basement room in the house I ~~am living in~~ lived at. 

Fortunately, due to the quick work of emergency personnel, I was given enough warning to get myself, and a few of my more valuable and irreplaceable possessions to higher ground. However, most everything else I own was lost to the water.

I spent a few nights at a shelter before heading to a friend's house on higher ground. I've been here looking for a new place to live ever since. 

Since my job has been shut down, also due to flooding, I've had some spare time on my hands. I've been using this time to volunteer my time to the cleanup efforts, helping other Calgarians to haul out the ruined possessions in their basements. It's been difficult, but I have seen some truly incredible things, both from individuals and corporations, both good and bad.

This is one of the latter.

Going green.

&gt;Be me

&gt;21 years old, helping other residents clean out their basements

&gt;Be working for 7 hours

&gt;Tired

&gt;Hungry

&gt;Soaked

&gt;Muddy

&gt;Happy to be doing what I can for my cityfolk

&gt;Hear that Original Joe's is cooking burgers/fries for the volunteers, giving them away for free to *volunteers*

Seriously, support OJ's if you have on near you, and tell them thanks from Calgary. They are run by some really great people

&gt;Finish the house we are on

&gt;We all go down to OJ's for our first hot meal in days

&gt;thisisgoingtotastesogood.excitement

&gt;Get there, and there are probably 40-50 other soggy, muddy, tired volunteers in line ahead of us

&gt;News travels quick, but that's alright

&gt;Time for some bonding time with some great people

&gt;Line is moving fairly quick

&gt;OJ's people hammering their grub out like total bosses

&gt;iloveyou.mp3

&gt;Getting near the front of the line, when a car pulls up

&gt;This pathetic, spherical excuse for a human steps up

&gt;Probably 5'5"", 300 or so lbs (162cm, 135kg or thereabouts)

&gt;Totally clean

&gt;Totally dry

&gt;Hair all did

&gt;Nails did

&gt;Wearing small heels

&gt;Starts making loud conversation at the back of the line

&gt;Hear something about free food for the hungry people

&gt;Someone corrects her

&gt;""This is for volunteers, lady""

&gt;Now you have my undivided attention

&gt;Flood Relief Fatty (FRF): ""NAW SON, THIS BE FOR HUNGRY PEOPLE""

&gt;Other volunteer shakes his head, turns his back on her

&gt;Too tired for this shit

&gt;Get up to the front

&gt;Get my burger and my fries

&gt;ohsweetbabyjesusthishasbeensentfromonhigh.sogood

&gt;Hang around to eat and chat with other volunteers

&gt;Maybe a little bit to watch the free dinner show

&gt;FRF gets close to front of the line

&gt;All of a sudden, two fire trucks pull up

&gt;12 firefighters, equally wet and muddy disembark

&gt;Head up to the side of the table, and talk to the (probably) manager of OJ's

&gt;He nods, and starts pulling burgers off the grill, throwing them in to go boxes, and handing them to the firefighters

&gt;Firefighters take their delicious bounty and begin heading back to the truck

&gt;They be busy muthafuckers right now

&gt;This dipleases FRF

&gt;She loudly HARRUMPHs, crosses her arms, and pouts

&gt;A few volunteers shake their heads in disgust, but stay mum on the subject

&gt;Her time will come

&gt;Eventually, she gets to the front of the line

&gt;OJ's grill guy looks at her like she has two heads

&gt;OJGG: ""Uhhh... What the fuck are you doing?""

&gt;FRF: ""AHM HuNGRY AND I HERD YOU HAD FREE FOOD FOR HUNGRY PEOPLE""

&gt;OJGG: ""We are providing free hot meals to volunteers helping out with the flood effort. You don't seem to fit the bill.""

&gt;FRF: ""NAW WELL IM HUNGRY AND YOU HAFF TO FEED ME. IM NOT MOVING TIL YOU DO""

&gt;She plants herself in place

&gt;OJGG shrugs, and stars passing burgers over her head and around her (he had long arms) to the volunteers behind/beside her

&gt;This also displeases the Ham

&gt;The next time OJGG passes a burger around her, she reaches for it, and knocks it to the pavement

&gt;Fuck this shit. I've had it

&gt;I'm too tired, too wet, too muddy to give a fuck

&gt;There is no beta today

&gt;I walk up to her, burger/fries still on a to go box in my hand

&gt;In hindsight, this was a mistake

&gt;Me: ""You need to get out of line and apologize to everybody here right now, or I will forcibly remove you from the line.""

&gt;FRF: ""AHD LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY YOU FAT FUCK. WHY YOU EVFEN EATING THESE FRIES YOU'RE ALREADY TOO FAT""

For reference, [this is me](http://imgur.com/OKrwgzV). Yes, that is my underwear. Pants are for the weak. (SFW)

&gt;And with that, she reaches out with a speed that I did not think possible from a ham

&gt;Must have been the hamdrenaline from being in the presence of food

&gt;Grabs a handful of my fries

&gt;No.

&gt;NO.

&gt;Atomic rage level 10 reached

&gt;Evacuate surrounding areas

&gt;Reach out and grab her wrist, intercepting it mere inches from her gaping maw

&gt;Pull her hand back

&gt;Feel wrist fat move long before the arm begins to

&gt;I care not

&gt;Begin to shake her arm vigorously, while yelling at her like I would a puppy (but louder)

&gt;Me: DROP IT. DROP IT. NO. BAD. DROP THE FRIES. DROP IT. BAD GIRL.

&gt;Still shaking, fries beginning to fly loose

&gt;Continue to shake

&gt;Continue to scold

&gt;NO. BAD. DROP THEM

&gt;Fries still coming loose, only a few remain

&gt;Fatty still holding on to the fries

&gt;There is no anger anymore, only shake

&gt;Finally, all the fries are gone from her grasp

&gt;Pull her by that hand out of line, and back to her car

&gt;Open the door for her, stand between her and the line

&gt;Me: ""Now you will get the FUCK in your car, and get the fuck out of here. Maybe if you actually stopped to help instead of being a worthless drain on society, you might actually lose some weight.""

&gt;FRF is about to cry

&gt;I don't care

&gt;Me: ""And save the waterworks. You think you are going to get any sympathy from these hardworking people that you just tried to steal food from? You're fucked. Now. Leave.""

&gt;FRF bursts into tears, but slowly gets into her car yammering inconsolably

&gt;She drives away

&gt;I return to my group, feeling pleased with myself.

&gt;Get a few pats on the back on the way, and the OJGG replaces my lost fries

&gt;Ate with my crew, and then went back and put 5 more hours into the neighbours houses.

&gt;Be sophomore in college ~1.5 years ago

&gt;doing that engineering shit that everyone on Reddit is doing in between r/atheism posts.

&gt;Meet a lot of cool likeminded people in the process. 

&gt;Except for Hamfucker.

&gt;He's exactly what the name implies, he is a ham and he is also a supreme fucker. 

&gt;He's 5'11"" and must weight god damned near 400-450 lbs.

&gt;Now, this alone I wouldn't really care about, I lack prejudice against people for their size. I used to be a pretty big guy. In early high school I weighed at my heaviest 280lbs. I know what it's like to be big. I understand how intimidating or daunting a task like losing all that weight is. Especially with a dependence on food.

&gt;I know those rationalizations we've all come to know as fatlogic.

&gt;Started lifting like a motherfucker sophomore year of high school. Got ripped to bits by freshman year of college. 190 lbs at 10% bf. I made it brahs.

&gt;SonOfZeuspose.jpg

&gt;At this point in the story I was a hefty 225 lbs again, but I had started raw powerlifting the year before, so I was even bigger with a bit of fat. Probably around 15-20%.

&gt;I've competed in and won meets.

&gt;Back to the Fucker of Ham.

&gt;He was in the engineering program with me.

&gt;Loud, obnoxious, and just a downright shit person.

&gt;Smelled like mildew and sour milk.

&gt;Wears the same Nyan-Cat shirt almost everday.

&gt;Also, crocs.

&gt;Ate a family sized bag of chips everyday in statics, jowls flopping about zealously.

&gt;He also has an ego-complex.

&gt;Thinks he's god'- I mean Sagan's gift to science.

&gt;Constantly belittles people by gloating his grades above theirs even if he was well within the c-range for most of the class.

&gt;Professor would sometimes leave the gradebook open on the computer when he went to the BR or to grab something from his office.

&gt;Hamfucker took it upon himself to go through and announce the failing grade of a classmate.

&gt;Classmate was having a rough semester, his mother was diagnosed with a rapidly advancing form of cancer, forget what kind, and in between working and helping his parents his grades slipped. He was still keepin on though.

&gt;Cue deathglare from everyone.

&gt;""Lol what? I was just saying the truth.""

&gt;Classmate sits their looking pretty defeated. Guy ended up dropping the class the next day.

&gt;""Huehuehue"" to himself and walks away back to his Ruffles chips.

&gt;Professor comes back in and I pull him aside after class to explain what happened. 

&gt;Prof is a bro, but can do nothing because he didn't witness it, believes everyone in class and gives Hamfucker a warning.

&gt;Walking out of class hear whining and foot stamping coming from the prof's direction.

&gt;Hamfucker isn't having it.

&gt;Fast forward to later in the semester.

&gt;Hamfucker has interjected himself into our social group.

&gt;Whatever, shit isn't high school, I only have to put up with him for a bit. Plus, the guy is entertaining, the childishness and the utter bullshit he spews from his gullet is impossible to believe. 

&gt;Fellow engineering-bro starts asking me about lifting.

&gt;I've had some confidence issues because of my former Spherical-Mode, but have recently started wearing tighter fitting shirts and tanks. Swole Acceptance n' shit.

&gt;peoplebemirin.jpg

&gt;""Lifting all that weight is bad for your joints"" interjects Hamfucker.

&gt;""And I suppose you're an expert on that subject as well?"" I ask.

&gt;""Yeah, well you see my uncl- *trails off into some BS story* - and now he can't walk, stuff is bad for your health"" says the smug ham.

&gt;Always lies about shit, knows a guy who did this, or he formerly did that. One time he said he ""flirted"" with Emma Watson and that he was present at a running of the bulls in Spain.

&gt;""Well, you carry around a load of at least an extra 200lbs constantly, how is that not bad for you?""

&gt;ohshit.fuckdidisaythat

&gt;Beady eyes narrow, grease perspires, mouth agape, expelling heavy fumes of cheeto-dust. Can see him struggling to find an explanation.

&gt;Him: ""Becau- Because I eat enough to do that""

&gt;rationalization.pdf

&gt;Me: ""I eat nearly 3000 calories a day during a bulking period.""

&gt;Him: ""And that's why you're chubbier than I am.""

&gt;wut faces from everyone.

&gt;2+2=potato

&gt;Windows is shutting down to protect data

&gt;Finally, I lose it, there is no way my hardwork equates to that barely moving, save for the fat undulation, piece of shit.

&gt;Me: ""Really, man? You can't believe the bullshit coming out of your mouth right now, can you?""

&gt;Him: ""Must suck to finally have someone tell you that they're both stronger and more fit than you.""

&gt;everyone just bursts out laughing, fatty must think they're agreeing and continues in on the BS.

&gt;So, I do the unthinkable. I actually touch the nasty mothefucker. I stand up, pull him out of his chair and proceed to fireman pull the dude onto my shoulder. 

&gt;I am atlas.

&gt;He is screeching like the little piggy he is. Probably hasn't seen heights from this angle since birth.

&gt;""PUT ME DOWN, MY DIABETES!""

&gt;I put him down, now completely covered in HIS sweat, not mine.

&gt;""Now do the same to me, since you're stronger.""

&gt;Him, panting in his chair. ""NO, dude that's GAY""

&gt;""No, it's because you can't.""

TL;DR Hamfucker is an extraordinary asshole. I literally give him a different ""perspective.""

I love the job, I love most of the people I deal with (even the ones who don't know ""What the box under the desk with the lights"" does), and even more, I love the stories I accumulate.

My main love of this job, is that where I am now, I'm not to be fucked with. Oh, I'll help you with your computers and all the software you have to use (For electrical engineers, some of those idiots barely even know how to install Auto-Cad! Makes me sad, they're usually so smart...), and I'll talk you through problems you have, but if you fuck with our equipment, *don't expect me to be nice.* I know what it's like going through internal auditing, and I'll make damn sure my costs are kept down. Prevention and education is key!

Now, you may be wondering ""Why are you not over in /r/talesfromtechsupport? Why are you allllll the way over here?"" Well, my little beetus monsters, I figured you would enjoy the story about how one woman's negligence and entitlement got her fired, and how I managed to clear up the mess.

&gt;Wakin' up on Monday morning, getting that nice stretching in

&gt;Breakfast of Weetbix... damn good Aussie stuff. Lets check the morning ne...

&gt;*bzzzzz*

&gt; Wait. What is that?

&gt;*bzzzzz*

I check my phone, expecting a phone call with the amount of buzzing that was coming through. Nope. After leaving my work phone off all weekend (I'm strict about taking calls on the weekend now, after having lost 70+ hours of over time giving support over the phone and not being able to claim for it) and turning it on Monday morning, I had expected MAYBE a few emails.

Nope.

35 emails, all from one address, sent both Saturday and Sunday.

&gt;grumble.avi

&gt;Open a few, all with the subject ""URGANT"" (actual spelling)

&gt;""HELP. KEYBOARD WONT WORK. PLEASE SEND HELP""

&gt;Generous lack of information such as WHERE THE HELL SHE ACTUALLY IS

&gt;Suspect she was emailing from home

&gt;Goddamn home problems, I will NOT be dealing with that

&gt;Read through more, in beautiful, chronological order

&gt;""THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, I NEED TO WORK ON THE WEEKENDS TO CATCH UP AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING ONE BIT""

Please be advised this is translated from near gibberish to something legible. 

&gt;""NOW THE MOUSE IS NOT WORKING. YOUR SET UPS ARE CLEARLY FAULTY. I WILL BE CONTACTING THE VP ABOUT THIS.""

&gt;Please be kidding me you idiot

&gt;Have automatic message that says no support people are available on the weekend (Despite my recommendations to HR), meaning she would have received 35 automatic emails in reply

&gt;Next email...

Oh dear god...

&gt;""I DO NOT APPRECIATE BEING TOLD THERE WILL BE NO ONE TO HELP ON THE WEEKEND. HOW ON EARTH DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT FUNCTION LIKE THIS. EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN HELPFUL APART FROM YOU. I'LL HAVE YOU ALL FIRED, I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.""

I couldn't fathom this reaction... she actually thought the automatically generated emails that were sent to her, EACH TIME SHE SENT AN EMAIL, were from me. Each one written the exact same way. 

I put my phone down and finished getting ready for work. Now armed with the knowledge that she isn't trying to get me to just fix her home computer, I set off on the bus to discover what graven misfortune had befallen her PC. 

Having never dealt with this person before, I set down my stuff, and went to her office (after asking a few people where the office might actually be), with the same, happy demeanor that I usually bring to a 'higher' service request. I usually leave the ""turn it on and off again"" issues to my delightful underlings.

&gt;The smell

&gt;It's true what the FPS's say... it's always the smell that hits first

&gt;Nose is now actually running... perfume and cheese under-stank overload. 

&gt;subtletissue.gif

&gt;Finally raise my head enough to see what was behind the desk in this foul lair one would call an 'office'

&gt;Sweet baby Zeus...

&gt;Not far off this [lady](http://www.stickboydaily.com/images/2012/05/400-pound-Briton-4-576x594.jpg), except caked in pancake makeup, and not smiling... not at all...

&gt;""Well, it only took you two bloody days to get up here!""

&gt;""Yes, well, hi, I'm from IT...""

&gt;""I FIGURED. Not like I get anyone else coming in here""

&gt;Iwonderwhy.glare

&gt;""... You said you had an urgent, advanced issue with your PC. Can you explain the issue?""

&gt;Try to sit down on the spare chair, begin to move trash on the chair to the ground

&gt;""DON'T YOU MOVE THAT STUFF, IT'S MINE. YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST COME IN HERE AND ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE?!""

&gt;wat

&gt;wat

&gt;WAT

To give a better view of this lair, the ground was covered in litter... you could barely make out her desk for all the chip packets, and even McDonalds boxes and bags that lay around the place. There was clearly litter that was just 'flung' over her desk, onto the ground. 

&gt;Stand... awkwardly.

&gt;""Ok, well lets get down to the bottom of this issue then.""

&gt;""FINALLY. It's not that hard to fix one of these damns pieces of shit. Like I said in the email, the keyboard and mouse have died.""

&gt;""Well, if you let me have a look at it, I'll see what I can do. Do you mind if I use your computer?""

&gt;""NO. This is MY computer, with MY personal information on it. Why should I let one of you IT lackeys onto it""

&gt;Begin to leave

&gt;""Well, there is not much more I can do then ma'am""

&gt;Begin to step over piles of trash

It took a least 30 seconds to get to the door... with the joyous thought of telling her department head about this clusterfuck, I grab the doorknob, when suddenly...

&gt;*SSCREEEE*

&gt;Assume dying cat is in the room

&gt;Speed dial RSPCA

&gt;Oh wait, it was just the fucking whale in the room, trying to get my attention my making random noises.

&gt;""Excuse me?""

&gt;""HOW DARE YOU TRY AND LEAVE. I WANT THIS FIXED NOW, WITH MY PRIVACY CONSIDERED. DON'T ACT LIKE YOU'RE SO HIGH AND MIGHTY, I CAN GET YOU FIRED!""

&gt;Had been leaving the room for a good 30sec... did she have to plan this? Was she really that slow?

&gt;""Then let me use your computer, or else, I have business elsewhere to attend to""

&gt;""FINE. But don't expect me to move. My *disability* means I have to stay seated as much as possible""

It hit me. The first time someone had used that excuse around me. Like a tonne of bricks, it fell around my common sense, as the last shreds of my allotted daily sanity fell away.

&gt;I begin to just push rubbish off her desk. No pens or paper to be seen. Just litter.

&gt;Ignore her whale calls

&gt;Shake mouse around... nothing works. Same with keyboard. Re-plug them in? Driver problem? Nope.

&gt;I look down, and to my despair, underneath my hands were the most disgusting excuses for computer equipment I've ever seen in my life

&gt;Every key had sauce with crumbs dried into it

&gt;No keys would actually go down all the way

&gt;Mouse still clicks... why does it not work?

&gt;Look under mouse

&gt;Sauce

&gt;Fucking SAUCE had gotten into the optical outlet (the laser pointy thingie). It was completely dried.

&gt;Crumbs in every crook and cranny

&gt;Actually dry heave

&gt;""ARE YOU DISRESPECTING ME?""

I just left the room. Dear god, unless you've experienced it yourself, there is nothing that comes close to the mess I encountered in that room. I thought it was just litter at first, but the dried food and crumbs was just... I don't like to think of it now.

&gt;Go back to own office

&gt;Call in most unfortunate underling... had accidentally cracked two monitors last week by carrying them like an idiot

&gt;Give him a new mouse and keyboard, and the room number, nothing else

&gt;Begin to vigorously make notes and send emails to department heads regarding this woman

&gt;Give her a warning that this would be the last IT equipment replacement we would be doing for her, given her lack of respect for company policy of keeping it clean and tidy

5 minuets later, after brewing a nice, hot tea

&gt;*bzzzz*

&gt;An email already? Maybe one of the department heads is reprimanding her!

&gt;lolnope

&gt;""HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF DEFACING OFFICE PROPERTY. I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW I CLEAN MY EQUIPMENT IF I EVER DROP ANYTHING ON IT BY LICKING IT UP AND WIPING IT DOWN. I DON'T APPRECIATE LIES BEING SPREAD AROUND ABOUT ME IN THE OFFICE. I'LL BE TAKING THIS UP WITH HR""

&gt;dat capslock

&gt;cc'd to her department head

&gt;The sheer ridiculousness of the situation over comes me, begin to laugh uncontrollably

&gt;Department head comes in (awesome bloke), having read the emails I cc'd him in on, and reads the email this woman had sent me

&gt;Both rollick in laughter together

&gt;We've been here too long to put up with this shit.

But alas, as we all know, FPS's are never this simple. Stay tuned for the next episode of ""When whales attack computer equipment"", when the threat of legal action, violent protection of her stash of trash, and my stubborn adherence to the most basic company policies culminate into a lovely clusterfuck for you youngin's to enjoy!

1364583169.0	1b9a2d	Fattie tries to be known as most athletic in the office	argumentbacker1	1433	176	141	"Ok guys, I just discovered this subreddit and I've got an experience to share from a year ago. Sorry I'm not a great storyteller and not really a huge fan of greentext.

Alright. I work at an awesome company where all of my coworkers range from overweight to obese. I'm a 5'4"" 120, about 24% bodyfat (pretty good for a woman), and active lifestyle. Easily the most fit out of all my coworkers (a task as hard as their bellies). 

Never really had a problem with anyone about weight, most of coworkers are fat but super cool people, except for one ~~little~~ enormous thing: a ~~woman~~ whale who used to occasionally make snide comments about me dieting (""eating bland food isn't worth it"", ""at least I enjoy life"", ""mooo mooo mooo""). She's probably 5'6"" 250, and that's optomistic. This particular genus of whale was kind of self-conscious about her weight even though no one brought it up, and she liked to bring up that she was an athlete in high school. So we'll call her the Fatlete. 

Anyway Fatlete was honestly a cool person to be around, especially since she stopped making comments about my diet once I started keto to cut and targeted keto to ""bulk"". But she always liked to paint herself as athletic and healthy despite the obvious drooping rolls of her bellyfa- I'm sorry: her sexy, sexy curves. Yeah she was one of those hamplanets. She'd always single me out, saying things like ""We should compete sometime, I'd like to see how you do"" and ""I wonder if all your working out makes you athletic like me, I'm a little heavier but I make up for it with skill""

Not sure she knows what athletic means

I captained varsity basketball back in the day and played varsity soccer too. 

Apparently she played softball. So did several other fatties in the office (does softball attract fat people?)

So last year around July the company is having a softball game for the employees. Free barbecue so of course everyone's going. HR wisely bought about 5 burgers for every person, because by the end there were none left over. I'm sure the grill was licked clean too. I attend because Fatlete says in the lunch room in front of everyone ""Good, it's time to see who the *real* atheltes are here. I hope you can make it argumentbacker1"".

I've never swung a bat in my life, so at the game I strike out twice, hit a grounder once. Fatlete, who's probably wider than her bat, hits it pretty deep all three times. For anyone else it would be a triple or double, but she stumbles so slowly to first base it's a single. She's gasping for air and red as a beet (not that she'd know what that was) and damn near collapsing on first base.

Kind of embarrassing, everyone cheering ""GO GO GO"" and kind of fading when she's practically crawling when it's time to run to second or third. She never made it to home plate, she gave up once in between third and home, just sat down and asked someone to bring her gatorade. 

Somehow in her fat-warped brain that day proved she was the best athlete in the company, and after the game she joked about it saying ""Argumentbacker1 might work out a lot, but this fat woman's the best athlete!"" I laugh and play along because it starts out pretty light-hearted and everyones having a good time. 

This shit don't stop. For the next few weeks, whenever she walks into a room with people, the Fatlete announces ""[Company]'s greatest athlete has now arrived!"" while looking at me. At lunch while she gorges on her mountains of buttered mashed potatoes, ""I might eat a lot but I'm good at sports so it's okay"", ""You need to eat more for energy, that's why I was so much better than you at the softball game"".

She gets a little placard for her desk that says ""MOST ATHLETIC"".

Dieting and fitness advice starts coming out her grubby mouth: ""You shouldn't lift, it's not right for women. You need to do cardio like me."" Her cardio consists of walking half a mile to the nearest Dunkin Donuts and no doubt singlehandedly keeping that franchise alive. Seriously, we all pass by that Dunkin Donuts on the way to work and she is the ONLY customer I've ever seen in there.

I have enough so I beg HR to make the next event basketball or soccer of frisbee or anything that requires moving your legs for a continued amount of time.

Couple months later, they schedule a basketball game. Everyone shows up again, the free food an all-powerful beacon to the hungry whales. Fatlete says she actually played basketball in high school. I imagine Shaq circa 2009. So of course she's talking mad trash (she knows I played soccer, I never told her I led my conference in scoring in womens basketball). 

We get on the court. We're on separate teams. She guards me of course, looking for the chance to embarrass me (lol, the fat must have seeped into her marbled brain, she was delusional). 

Oh god I've been praying for this.

Oh god several people are recording this game thank you thank you thank you.

Oh god I'm about the orgasm before tip off.

We win the tip off and I completely wreck the everloving shit out of Fatlete and her team. I was a one woman fast break literally EVERY possession since I had the astounding ability to run faster than a light jog.

Fatlete can't even dribble, her grimy paws are too blubbery and her arms too stubby. I steal the ball from her effortlessly half a dozen times and race down the court for an easy layup. 

Holy shit I'm Russell Westbrook out here. Seriously, a 12 year old child could have dominated this game.

One time she tries to chase me and literally falls flat on her face. The game is stopped for a few minutes as she doesn't get up, leaving an ocean of sweat on the floor. She's wheezing and heaving, and after a moment we realize that's not all just grease and sweat on her face, she's crying a little too. We all feel a little bad, then someone makes a joke about some athlete crying (sorry I don't follow football so I didn't catch the reference). Everyone laughs and we keep playing.

We win that game 16 - 0, and easily win the next few games too.

After the game, I never rub it in or say anything. Her shutting up forever was the best reward. Silence is golden.

Her stupid little placard is gone too.

1374515131.0	1itppi	Sick of my fatty family outcasting me because I'm healthy...	Demaikeru	1548	311	252	"I was a fatty like the rest of my family at one point, but at the minute I weigh 190 pounds, 6 feet tall, and work out a lot. I used to be roughly 250 pounds and every single person who has known me during my weight loss has been ecstatic and extremely happy for me that I'm in the greatest shape of my life. Everyone except for, funnily enough, my immediate family. I'd have thought that being my immediate family, they'd be super happy for me because they knew how sad it made me that I started really piling on the pounds and not looking after myself. But yesterday I came in from my daily jog and my parents apparently had, ""had enough"" of me being different, and let out starchy rage at me.

So I get in and it's roughly 7:30pm, and I jump in the shower and whatnot. Get out, get dried, brush my teeth and everything and go to my room. A minute later, my parents are stood at my door, looking pretty pissed off. I asked what was up, and they just flipped their shit. ""WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO GET BACK FROM YOUR STUPID RUN, WE'RE ORDERING PIZZA AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT"" my mum screams, chins bouncing rhythmically with her mouth. My dad raises his voice too, telling me that it's ""not fair on the rest of us"" that I ""go out running every day around 6pm so they can't eat around that time"". I haven't eaten fast food in *months*, and I remind them, again, that I'll make my own food. They really flip their shit now, telling me that just because I'm ""different to them"" (they can't face that I'm healthy and they're not) I can't do things with them. But this is where it gets good.

My older sister (5'7, roughly 270 pounds) tells me that I'm doing it (getting in shape) because *I hate them.* Yeah. I know. I asked my parents if they really thought that and they agreed. I told them that they're fucking insane for thinking that, and it's not my fault they can't deal with the fact I'm healthy and happy, and they're the complete opposite, and that it's bullshit that they take it out on me. Then my dad comes out with this, ""Well it's hardly fair on us if you get into shape and we have to see you do it. We'll all be glad when you go back to university, it's not fair that we have suffer (yes, used the word suffer) while you be different.""

&gt;Be me, 5'10"" 155 lbs, relatively fit but working on improving myself

&gt;training for very first half-marathon

&gt;Running for exploration as well as exercise, just getting used to a new area.

&gt;Starting to lose my balance, being sucked off the road onto the sidewalk and onto the lawn by an unknown gravitational force

&gt;Is this a black hole?

&gt;No, just a hamplanet

&gt;Make eye contact, the planet seems oddly familiar, can't figure out why

&gt;Furiously sprint to break her gravitational force, go about my run

&gt;Get home and check my email and see something by an ex-girlfriend from college

&gt;Oh god, that wasn't...it couldn't have been... 

&gt;Yep, it was her.  Someone who was 5'5"" 130 or so in college has added at least 150 lbs in a few years.

&gt;She wants to see me for coffee.

&gt;Because I make terrible life decisions I say yes for some reason.

&gt;Meet for coffee, things are going OK until the subject of weight comes up after I notice that she's downed an entire 2 liter of Coke with her coffee.  It appears there is another in a shopping bag she's carrying with her.

&gt;She begins secreting grease from her eyes spontaneously and wails about how she eats practically nothing she can't lose weight and I'm so fit and it's not fair, it must be genetics, waaaaaaaaaaaah

&gt;yeahright.jpg

&gt;I agree to help her and say we're going to track your calories.  You have to make a list of everything you eat.  AND NO SODA, ABSOLUTELY NO SODA.

&gt;She agrees.

&gt;We go by her place and start by weighing her.  

&gt;297 lbs.  Yikes.

&gt;I draw up a meal plan for her, roughly 2500 calories a day, suggest some light exercise, a little walking, I even help her shop.  

&gt;1 week later

&gt;Go by her place and ask her how she's going.  She's raving about how much more energy she has and she's eating exactly right it must be working.

&gt;Weighin time, moment of truth.

&gt;And the survey says...299

&gt;wat

&gt;Bursts into treats again.  ""I'LL ALWAYS BE FAT, MY STUPID METABOLISM, I DID EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT AND I GAINED WEIGHT I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT WHY WHY WHY?""

&gt;I suspect she's been cheating but lower the calories per day to 2000 and tell her to keep at it.

&gt;1 more week passes.

&gt;I go to check in on her and she's already crying bacon fat again.  She says she now weighs 303, first time in her life she's been over 300, she needs lap band, it's the only way.

&gt;Sit down on the couch thinking this over.  She has to be cheating on the diet.  That's the only possible answer.

&gt;Ask her ""and you ate NOTHING besides what's on the chart""

&gt;""YES""

&gt;""You swear on it""

&gt;""I SWEAR TO JEEBUS AND ALL THE SAINTS""

&gt;Racking my brain trying to figure out what went wrong

&gt;She goes into the kitchen to get something to drink, comes back with a bottle of Ocean Spray cranberry drink and she's guzzling from the bottle

&gt;Waitaminute.jpg

&gt;""How much of that stuff are you drinking?""

&gt;""ONLY THREE BOTTLES A DAY""

&gt;oh my

&gt;I do the math and realize that's roughly 3000 calories.  Point this out.

&gt;""THOSE CALORIES DON'T COUNT, THEY'RE HEALTHY""

&gt;bertstare.jpg


The story actually has a happy ending though.  After realizing the error of her ways she tried again a few weeks later and tried the 2500 calorie meal plan and drank only water.  Like magic, the weight started falling off of her.  She's not all the way back to her college weight yet, but she's not that far off.  And she beat me in the last half marathon we ran.  

She's gonna make it."	t5_2vzax	True

First off, let me just thank each and every one of you magnificent roll-queens. You all found time between battling the 'Beetus and keeping that delicious gelatinous form to vote for Hamthrax in the Hammys, and I couldn't be more grateful. I really wish i could deliver this one sooner, but somehow my calculus professor doesn't understand that I have a doctors note and NEED TO WRITE FPS.

Lets continue where we left off: me and Jan weeping tears of laughter outside an expensive restaurant, Hamthrax and bf's company about to dine inside.

&gt;be me and bf

&gt;just finished crying our eyes out from laughter

&gt;must go back upstairs, managers are expecting bf

&gt;lock hands and walk up together

&gt;its us against the world*

&gt;*planet

&gt;relieved that dinner has been called

&gt;go into dining room

&gt;gorgeous.mahogany

&gt;table is set, proper silverware

&gt;look over to see Red Jumpsuit Appafatus a few seats away

&gt;throwing glares like they're doctor's orders

&gt;marvel at how she is still able squint eyes without fat caving into her eye sockets

&gt;medicalmysteries.wav

&gt;there's a really small menu, prix fixe, with options for every dietary need

&gt;well, not EVERY dietary need

&gt;theres an appetizer, salad, dinner, and dessert course, with two or three choices for each 

&gt;i settle for the vegetarian options, praying i can keep it down, feel in queasy after wine

&gt;meanwhile Fat Folds Five is surprisingly cool

&gt; says this place finally got it right and that she should eat here more often

&gt;""good portions""

&gt;err.. alrighty. 

&gt;make eye contact with Jan and he is just as puzzled

&gt;waiter comes over and asks us which options we'd each like

&gt;Felonious Chunk's face is a pasty, acne scarred, confused puddle of flab

&gt;""waddu u mean, option?""

&gt;the table is utterly silent as everyone registers what she says

&gt;she thought the two or three dishes per course were ALL going to be served per person

&gt;she has no idea what a prix fixe menu is

&gt;Jan makes a choking sound and it breaks the silence

&gt;look over at him 

&gt;he is almost purple in the face with effort

&gt;can't laugh can't laugh

&gt;MUST NOT LAUGH

&gt;everyone around the table is either stifling hysterics, looking extremely uncomfortable or shaking their heads in disbelief

&gt;surely she didn't think normal people at 3 dishes for four courses apiece

&gt;SideDish looks mortified, leans over to Lady Antibulimia, tries to quietly explain

&gt;""WUT??""

&gt;""You can only have one of the three"" one of the manager almost screams at her

&gt;Aerosmithfield Hams is deep red

&gt;blimp.jpg

&gt;is clearly deeply wounded, eye fat droops downward

&gt;growls at the waiter

&gt;""can i get two of one then?!!?"" nearly takes the man's head off

&gt; waiter is still stunned

&gt;his mind is visibly bending under the pressure it takes to comprehend the full glory of BananaHama

&gt;only a bark from the beast awakens the man, who says he'll have to check

&gt;starts taking everyone else's orders

&gt;""CHECK NOW""

&gt;heads turn so fast all that can be heard is displaced air

&gt;""uh….""

&gt;manager looks about to blow 

&gt;waiter takes one look at her and walks out the door

&gt;what followed were minutes of absolute tension

&gt;air was so thick Bon-Bon Jovi tried to make a snack of it

&gt;manager seethingly asks her why she thought she was more important then the rest of us waiting to order. 

&gt;Milli Vanilli Ice Cream turns on the water works

&gt;excuses waft from that gaping maw like bread aroma from a bakery

&gt;fear for my metaphor as she'll try to eat that too

&gt;""AH NEED TO MAKE SURE I GET ENOUGH FOOD FOR MY THIGHROIDS""

&gt;""I'M NOT SOME 	SICK SKINNY CHILD I NEED TO EAT""

&gt;waiter comes back with two more curious looking waiters

&gt;tells Hambuwumba she can only pick one

&gt;rage. pure rage on the boar's face

&gt;starts up the blubber factory

&gt;mass ignoring of Fat Company starts

&gt;other two waiters go around to take orders

&gt;placing orders while the beast glowers

&gt;waiters leave, conversation begins to resume

&gt;bf is telling manager about a drive we took out to long island 

&gt;Switch(diabetes)Foot interjects every FIVE FUCKIN SECONDS

&gt;keeps talking about how well she knows New York and how many good places she knows to eat

&gt;doesn't count, she's the size of the fucking state, of course she knows it better

&gt;surfacearea.algebra

&gt;Bf shoots her nasty look

&gt;""we're not talking about food""

&gt;Band of Hippos looks offended and confused

&gt;clearly can't imagine *not* thinking about what to shove into her black-hole of consumption next

&gt;manager asks the company members to talk a little about the project

&gt;boring, but its kind of the reason we're here

&gt;shut up and listen to presentation

&gt;waiters bring food in about half way through bf's part (the last part) of the project

&gt;everyone else pushes plates a little bit forward

&gt;common courtesy

&gt;Talking Headcheese doesn't abide by manners established by the thin-privilege elite

&gt;instead starts chowing down 

&gt;ICola Pop shoots daggers in between dripping mouthful of mushroom and cheese

&gt;loudly announces that ""WE ALL NEED TO DIG IN GUYS""

&gt;bf counters just as loudly ""NOT DONE YET"". 

&gt;Cutting Cake Crew continues eating, chewing loudly, makes eye contact with BF

&gt;Jan can't take it, screams across the table ""HOW ABOUT YOU TRY EATING LIKE PEOPLE, NOT LIKE COWS?""

&gt;The Flabulous Thunderthighs starts quivering and crying

&gt;shocker: no one cares

&gt;bf finishes up presentation 

&gt;takes five minutes

&gt; everyone starts eating, except for Can't Runaways, whose massacred her appetizer and is now eyefucking plates left and right

&gt;start eating my food

&gt;uh.oh

&gt;almost half way through portion (tiny portions by the way

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif) i realize the combination of watching Don Hamley scarf down her own portion and my still sensitive stomach will not end well

&gt;excuse myself as quickly as possible and almost run to the bathroom to hurl

&gt;bent over the toilet, sexy as you please, throwing up my guts

&gt;suddenly the door opens (hadn't locked it in my haste)

&gt;goddamn it, it's The Over-Lovin Spoonful with a triumphant look on that fat mashed up face

&gt;or maybe that's her face of indigestion. hard to tell

&gt;starts wild call of…god only knows

&gt;if i hadn't been so sick I would have admired the way her stomach gracefully escaped her tent, a grease stained slice of flesh dangling from the elastic fabric

&gt;her cankles flapped excitedly in her fishnets

&gt;next thing I know Weezer is bellowing ""I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT""

&gt;people come running 

&gt;find me being sick, with Thick Lizzy pointing at me and shaking her layers about

&gt;people start freaking out

&gt;Jan helps me up, explaining that I've been sick for at least a month no--

&gt; ""I KNEW SHE WAS A BULIMIC DO YOU SEE JAAAAAN WHAT KIND OF GIRLFRIEND IS THAT???????""

&gt;dear god

&gt;everyone is staring at her, then staring at me

&gt;jimmies: rustled

&gt;we interrupt this dramatic scene for more vomit

&gt;manager tells everyone to leave and go back to -

&gt;wait, where did Marinara &amp; the Diabetes go?

&gt;people go back to the room while I wash my face in the bathroom

&gt;hear cries of rage, me and Jan make our way back

&gt;Tempura Trap had taken early leave and tried to eat everyone's leftover appetizers

&gt;OFF THEIR PLATES

&gt;starts wailing about portion size

&gt;laugh so hard Ialmost puke again

&gt;manager tells Jan he should take me home

&gt;Fatti Smith starts yelling ""HE CAN'T GO, HE HAS TO STAY""

&gt;manager tells her its okay, because she can't stay either until she ""learns to behave like a civilized human being""

&gt;oh god, puke/laughter

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lol.gif) i walk out of the place arm in arm with my man as Gusher struggles down the stairs

TL;DR: Hamthrax gets a verbal smack down from bf &amp; boss, then thrown out of a fancy company dinner for being a rude cunt to me after I puke.

Stay tune, the drama gets even more greasy!

**For part 2 of my delectable saga, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1igov5/tales_from_it_pt2_not_even_zeus_would_hit_that/)**

To ensure that newcomers to this story whose condishuns prevent them from reading the back story, I am about to storm into the offices of HR, who have both allowed a disgustingly unhygienic, computer destroying, under working, over paid lard lover continue to be employed, while also allowing her to sexually harass one of my shy interns. The reason she managed to get away with it for so long, is because she was banging our Mr DesperateRomantic, a manager who had no luck with anyone ever, except for the past 3-4 months.

&gt;Jump in the lift

&gt;Learn its very hard to actually jump into, and be mad in a lift

&gt;Realize they put calming music in there to prevent office shoot ups

&gt;Wait... we have no guns here!

&gt;Become both relaxed and intrigued

&gt;Exit the lift, the calmness lifts, leaving only unbridled rage

Having reached the floor where both HR and some logistics people where working, we search around for the sender of the offending email in my previous story, accusing me of bullying Lard Lover. The hunt for Mr DesperateRomantic was drawing to a close.

&gt;Round final corner

&gt;No blue shell in sight!

&gt;Come up to his office, him sitting hunched back, typing furiously

&gt;politeness.exe is still not responding, restart the program?

&gt;Burst in

After making ourselves comfortable in his office, Mr DesperateRomantic began to stutter, not having been used to dealing with actual employees before. He was just sending out emails to 'offenders' of company policy, and letting Dept. Heads deal with it. Not today, bozo.

&gt;""So, after ignoring a serious sexual harassment case made against Lard Lover, you've decided to come after one of my managers for doing her job?""

&gt;""N-n-no. She wasn't do-do-doing her job properly. There are certain p-protocols one has to follow when dealing with d-d-disabled people at our company""

&gt;""Oh! So what is Lard Lovers disability, exactly. Being the desk jockey who actually makes sure we have the paper work regarding disabilities, you should be able to tell us exactly how [me] managed to be so offensive""

&gt;Got him cornered

&gt;Dept. Head had executive access to all employee files on our system

&gt;Lard Lover had no disability filed with us

&gt;Figured after 8 years, she might of said something

&gt;""I-I'm not allowed to te-""

&gt;""You know that's bullshit. We both have enough clearance to see those files, and [me] being here is required as she is the one having the accusations held against her""

&gt;""Well, b-bullying in the w-workplace is very seri-""

&gt;""And sexual harassment isn't?! Look, I suggest that you ether make a proper case against this valued employee, rather than just a vague, threatening email, or have a talk with Lard Lover again to see where the real fact lie. And while you're at it, actually DEAL with this sexual harassment charge!""

&gt;Leave triumphantly.

Or so we thought. 

&gt;Lunch time!

&gt;Actually brought something from home

&gt;Dat tuna casserole. Best microwaved until superheated, and then eaten faster than a porn star guzzles cocks

&gt;Hear something coming from lunch room bathrooms

&gt;Two lunchrooms for the entire building. Just fuckin' great

&gt;*thud*

&gt;*thud*

&gt;*thud*

&gt;Oh god, not in the bathrooms...

&gt;*thud*

&gt;Enter silently, prepared to leave a note on the mirror saying ""Next time, do it at home""

&gt;*thud*

&gt;""Ohhhh yeah, *moan* Mr DesperateRomantic. *moan* You've made my life sooooo much better. I needed a real *moan* man to satisfy me""

&gt;Oh my sweet sugar covered sanity...

&gt;From the disabled stall...

&gt;""Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!""

&gt;*thuds* stop abruptly

&gt;Jump into random stall

&gt;""Ugh, help me straighten up, won't you daaarl""

&gt;""S-sure thing""

&gt;Can hear him panting quite hard

&gt;""Let's go out and get lunch. I doubt anyone will notice us gone *teehee*. Maybe to Sizzlers?""

Sizzlers is our ""all you can eat"" buffet. We don't have any others like it around here. 

&gt;Prepare to see stock prices plummet in an hour

&gt;""Snacking will help me take my mind off those goddamn IT jerks. Telling me I can't get help from them! It's THEIR computers that are fucking up! And it's none of their business that my office is kept as it is. Hell, it makes it easier for me to work... the smell keeps me alert""

&gt;WHAT

&gt;WHAT

&gt;My sanity was now crumpled, lying on the floor, after taking one right to the bollocks

&gt;At least she had a 'justification' for the rubbish

&gt;If you can't eat the fast food, you may as well smell it!

&gt;Hear her grumble and burp... and then...

&gt;Queef

Now, I understand that queefing is a perfectly natural way for the womanly body to react to a good dicking, but my god, it was the wettest, loudest queef I've ever heard. If the situation were not so horrifying, I would be impressed.

&gt;""*teehee*, You've worn me out after that session. I hate going on top though. We should buy some toys to make it easier""

&gt;Explains the thuds then

&gt;Probably the most exercise she's gotten this month

&gt;Eyes watering from a mixture of the smell and a need to vomit from the noise of the queef

&gt;Just trying to pretend to poop

&gt;May not need to pretend, my body wants to evacuate everything from sheer disgust

&gt;Finally hear them leave

&gt;Wash my hands, arms, and face

&gt;Curiosity overwhelms me

&gt;Look over into the disabled stall

&gt;Two used condoms, makeup smeared on the floor, toilet paper crumpled everywhere

&gt;A bag of McDonalds

At this point, not even my super heated delicious tuna casserole could beg me to eat it, so I just quietly leave, take it back to my desk, and pull out the sneaky flask I had in my desk draw.

&gt;Why why why why why why

&gt;Decide to try and eat a bit of casserole

&gt;Mmm, creamy goo-

&gt;Immediately spit it out

&gt;Wash mouth out with delicious vodka

&gt;Can't do this

&gt;Can't do this

&gt;Can't do this

&gt;Dept. Head comes in

&gt;""Hey, we need to have a chat. Apparently that idiot has claimed that not only did you bully her while fixing her computer, but that you pressured ShyIntern into making a false claim of sexual harassment""

&gt;Oh all the flying fucks...

&gt;""And this is all coming from Mr DesperateRomantic?""

&gt;""Oh yeah. I called a few other HR managers, and they haven't even heard of it going through. I managed to get one to take up the sexual harassment, but they said the bullying case against you will have to be dealt directly with Mr DesperateRomantic and his boss""

&gt;Stunned silence

&gt;""Well then, lets call their bluff""

And that there, my little monsters, is where I'll be leaving you until tomorrows saga. As I write it out, I remember more, and the more I want to bang my head against a wall. I'm off to do something productive, maybe.

I hope you all know that I should be writing a 30 page paper right now. But I love this subreddit too much to let it starve and loose it's perfect curves. So onward to Hamthrax drama! This is part one of a dinner party which now lives in infamy in the mind of the attendees. wewillnotforget.mpeg.

&gt;looks like the holiday party is still fresh in everyone's mind

&gt;no one likes her very much, so YellowLard's solution is to be doubly horrible

&gt;sipping wine, chatting to upper management
 
&gt;set phasers to polite conversation

&gt;am in the middle of being introduced to a manager I hadn't previously met when a sound cracks through the air

&gt;a waiter below us must have dropped a pot or something really big. 

&gt;second thump

&gt;oh wow so many waiters, so clumsy

&gt;third thump, closer this time

&gt;Oh god. Please don't let be --

&gt;it's beautiful

&gt;bf had forgotten to mention that since last i laid eyes on the glorious big boned goddess there was at least 20 new pounds to love

&gt;face is now impossibly fat, eyes are barely visible through that cottage-cheese like complexion. 

&gt;let me relieve your anxiety: she has dressed appropriately for this event

&gt;oh, oh wait

&gt; this WAS a meeting of the High School Freshman Anarchy Club, right? 

&gt;not an upscale dinner full of upper-management types

&gt;definitely appropriate that the beast has a donned a tiny torn up denim skirt

&gt;tiny is relative

&gt;could have functioned as a tablecloth for a buffet

&gt;fishnets under, her legs look exactly like hams

&gt;top was a bed sheet like material tied on one shoulder, allowing glorious left bingo wing to rub up against Hamthrax's voluminous sideboobage/backfat combo

&gt;manager who i was talking to is furious

&gt;mutters under breath ""I can't fucking believe it""

&gt;walks away, i assume to drown himself in wine

&gt;bf tells me they all got a memo about dressing appropriately and tastefully, with a note that it would be appreciated (read: required) if people could take out all non-discrete piercings

&gt;JAAAAAaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaN

&gt;people flee our general location

&gt;sympathetic looks are thrown, but nobody will make the sacrifice to distract her

&gt;would never ask that of someone

&gt;As I Lay Frying is now in our faces, huffing as if she had just caught up to a rouge Mr. Softie truck

&gt;smirks widely as she regards my weight loss

&gt;can see smears of ketchup in her teeth

&gt;""Long time no see roomsgotrooms, looks like you're disappearing"" 

&gt;Massive Heart Attack smiles even wider at Jan, exposing more food stained teeth

&gt; a powerful stench washes over us and I gag 

&gt;Hamthrax gives a mocking smile and whispers ""you should do that in the bathroom, girlie. no wonder you're so thin, you throw up everything""

&gt;smile back at the lump of doughy flesh oscillating in front of me

&gt;""Maybe you should give it a try. it might persuade you to use some mouthwash once in a while.""

&gt;[hfw](http://i.imgur.com/nv0tiFm.gif) an eternity  later when her fat covered grey cells process this statement

&gt; glares at Jan, who's face has contorted with quiet laughter

&gt;tosses her hair back, everyone gets splattered with grease

&gt;Ham Morrison's face twists in confusion/indigestion

&gt;""why are these sandwiches so tiny?""

&gt;mfw i have no face

&gt;Buffalo Winger is still unsettled by the size 

&gt;like a dog confronted with a vacuum cleaner, total confusion

&gt;this is the longest carbohydrates have lingered outside her suction tube

&gt;""how is this supposed to fill you up?"" the boulder ruminates aloud

&gt;can't take it, must leave before my sides leave this earth permanently

&gt;take Jan by the hand and search for higher, cleaner smelling ground

&gt;stand by the bar

&gt;there is no seating available in this area, surely Armin van Beetus will not follow

&gt;nope.shit

&gt;the rumbling and a loud belch alerts us the the fact that Hamthrax the great requires alcohol

&gt;one of the managers cradles his face in his hands, wondering what he did to deserve this plague on his workplace

&gt;Fat Zo orders a banana daiquiri 

&gt;what is this, spring break in Cabo?

&gt;the bartender looks at her uncomprehendingly

&gt;apologizes, doesn't have a blender

&gt;the monster howls and summons all of her energy to scream at the poor man

&gt;stops when she sees the manager's face

&gt;pure. anger.

&gt;Hamthrax must recognize this look from that billion times she looked at her reflection after a buffet didn't restock fast enough

&gt;grumbles ""this is bullshit"" and opens her sweat-covered purse

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/fUjHBaT.gif) she pulls a greasy 2 liter of Coke from the depths of the foul smelling vacuum

&gt;bartender's mouth is wide open as he searches our faces for confirmation that this is real life

&gt;[pretty accurate representation](http://i.imgur.com/in1YaMb.jpg)

&gt;oh, sweet man, it is

&gt;look over at Jan and realize he has turned puce and is laughing hysterically

&gt;Fatt &amp; Dim smiles over at him, and asks what is so funny

&gt;he can't answer, laughter is choking him

&gt;Diabetes Antwoord is now confused

&gt;her delusions start fighting with the reality that her beloved is obviously laughing at her

&gt;turns to me

&gt;causes mini-cyclone with her movement

&gt;gets about two inches from my face

&gt;itburns.avi

&gt;""what did you say you skinny whore? I'm SO done with you making fun of me behind my back"" the whisper come out along with flecks of food and a wave of digested Coke breath

&gt;first of all, her back is so wide that most activities go on behind it

&gt;thats just spacial physics

&gt;second, hadn't said a word

&gt;point both of these thing out to her 

&gt;Jan has now lost all control, and grabs my hand so I can help him outside 

&gt;we escape with Korn Dog hot on our trail, fuming like big sweaty stack of pancakes

&gt;she stops at the stairs

&gt;her desire to preserve those curves is greater than the need for immediate vengeance

&gt;me and Jan step outside and laugh so hard I almost throw up from the pain my sides are in

Last Sunday, me and Jan rolled up the the company picnic with two objectives: 1) eat as much watermelon as physically possible and 2) acquire Hamthrax stories. Both of our goals were satisfied beyond belief. I have enough stories to last a lifetime, so obviously I have to share them. Virtually EVERYONE in that office has their own horror story about the thieving meatpile.

Our first story comes from L, a mid-30's coworker in payroll who had a baby about a year ago. L is very tall, pale, and absolutely the nicest human  being in that office. 

&gt;be L

&gt;almost 6'0, pre-baby was very slim

&gt;come back to work after having baby

&gt;feeling self conscious about weight, eating to lose it at a good pace

&gt;packing healthy lunches, tons of water, trying to cut down on all carbs

&gt;first day back in the office

&gt;everyone congratulating her on baby, getting compliments left and right

&gt;everyone but fatmau5, that is

&gt;clearly L is getting too much attention for pushing a human being out of herself

&gt;where is Bacon-Turner Overeater's recognition?!??!?!

&gt;tells L that woman are supposed to gain *at least a 100lbs during pregancy* 

&gt;L tries to tell her that actually you should be gaining a 1/4th of that

&gt;begin Afrosnack's tirade about how L will be the worst, most-fatshaming mother of them all

&gt;""I BET YOU'D EVEN PUT YOUR KID ON A *DIET*""

&gt;L tells her she would, if her kid was overweight

&gt; is immediately hit with accusations of child abuse

&gt;L rolls her eyes and turns to put her tuna salad in the fridge

&gt;""ARE YOU GOING TO EAT JUST TUNA FISH??! WITH NO BREAD?""

&gt; Cheap Thick looks at L like she just committed murder

&gt;""I'm trying to lose weight, so no bread""

&gt;Swedish Meatball Mafia  ~~runs~~ waddles from the room screaming to the hamburger heavens

&gt;wat.sws

&gt;L doesn't give a shit, goes back to desk to actually do work

&gt;gotta make $$ for that baby

&gt; when lunch time rolls around, L is excited for her tuna

&gt;gets to the fridge…

&gt;her vision becomes tunneled

&gt;the music builds

&gt;the tuna… it's not there

&gt;but… she had left it, right on the second shelf

&gt;L looks around the fridge

&gt;no, it's just not there

&gt;her tuna is gone

&gt;hungry, hormonal, and already dealing with one baby sucking nutrients from her body, the beta switch is off

&gt;there is a loaf of bread on the counter, open and laying out

&gt;logically, L grabs a fork from the break room, and walks out to the floor

&gt;approaches Misfats, who is shamelessly chomping into a sandwich and reading US Weekly

&gt;""Hey Hamthrax.""

&gt;""WHUT""

&gt;""Is that a tuna salad sandwich?""

&gt;Meatload looks up 

&gt; ""YEAH"" and takes another bite

&gt;L, who is kinder than most people, looks Fat Company dead in the eye

&gt;knocks the sandwich out of her hands onto the floor

&gt;points at those bewildered beady eyes with a fork

&gt;""Listen you fat pig, I'm sore, hungry, and haven't slept in a month. How about you go and eat yourself into a food coma with your own tuna""

&gt; Major Lazy looks at her, jowls quaking

&gt;""And if you even *try* to accuse me of bullying or take my food again, I'll make sure that every month your pay will be docked 3.50, and I'll go out and by tuna fish with it, and eat it in front of you, you giant waste of space""

""And she never even dared to look me in the eye after that"". Me and Jan stared at her in awe as she casually finished wiping her son's hands with a napkin. 

""Thank God too, or I would have started throwing open packets of tuna fish into her purse! You gotta put those wild boars in their place or they'll just trample you.""

These are their stories.*

**doinkdoink**

Open on a typical municipal office break room, with a kitchenette and a few places to sit.

An average-looking fellow in a button-down shirt and slacks is putting food into the shared refrigerator.  He swings the door shut, revealing the magnificent woman who was standing behind it.

From the front, her dimensions are roughly those of the refrigerator door: just under 5' tall, and perhaps 3' wide.  The hem of her ruffled skirt has made it half way to her deeply-dimpled knees before giving up.  Her glorious bosom is emphasized by her extremely flimsy sleeveless top, which is about 3 popped seams away from violating public decency laws. 

Gloria Bosom is holding a bright green plastic bucket, with a yellow plastic handle that looks like a chain of daisies.  The sort of thing a child would bring to the shore. 

Button-down Fellow steps back with a mumbled polite greeting, making room for her in front of the fridge.

Gloria Bosom leans over to place the bucket on the bottom shelf of the fridge.  As she does, the bucket's contents become visible.  The young man's face registers surprise and disbelief.

The bucket contains something which at first appears to be a mass of wet muddy sand.  

On closer inspection, this is cake.  

Off-white cake, mixed with yellowish frosting, filling the bucket about 3/4th of the way up in matted clumps.   

The handle of a cheerful little yellow shovel is sticking up from the pile of bucket-cake.

The door of the fridge swings closed.  

Gloria Bosom leaves without comment. 

**doinkdoink**

Later that day. 

The Button-down Fellow is now enjoying a break outside.  He is describing the bucket-of-cake scene to one of his coworkers, an average-sized gal, who shares his disbelief and amusement.  

Suddenly they are interrupted:

""You know, it was probably a novelty cake.""

Another coworker has overheard the conversation.  Enter Ralph, a very large man, so named for his Ralph Lauren polo shirt which has stains down the front.  

""I've seen cakes like that on Food Network.  You make a cake in a pail and frost it to look like a beach with some waves, and put candy shells and beach toys on it as decorations,"" says Ralph.

Oo...kay.  I mean sure.  Not everyone could win Cake Wars, so let's give Gloria Bosom the benefit of the doubt and assume that's what she was going for.  Fair enough.

""Why is it your business anyhow?"" Ralph wants to know. ""Why would you need to shame someone for their food choices?""  

It's a bucket of cake, Ralph, you have to admit that's kinda funny.  But okay, we're sorry for gossipping.

""Everyone at this office is so anorexic, it's disgusting.  Everyone is a fat-hating health fanatic.""

This office features free donuts in the break room and has pizza parties for ""team building and morale"" about twice a month. 

""Yes, but everyone polices what you eat!  If you try to take more than a few slices of pizza everyone glares at you!""

They're probably just making sure everyone gets to have a slice or two before anybody goes back for seconds.

""No, they just can't stand to see someone enjoy food because they're all dupes of the diet industry.  They don't realize that our bodies are supposed to carry lots of fat, because that's how we evolved.""

evolutiondoesnotworkthatway.goodnight

Seriously Ralph, people aren't like that here.  Even the office vegan has jar of peanut butter cups on her desk.  

""Skinny people like you guys wouldn't know anything about the discrimination faced by persons of size, like myself and Gloria.""

(Persons Of Unusual Size? Is this the Fire Swamp?  Let's not say that out loud.)

Button-down Fellow attempts empathy, by sharing that he is queer and he understands how rough it can be to face prejudice.  

It's not effective.

""Being gay is totally different,"" lectures Ralph. ""Being gay is popular and fashionable now.""

Words fail.

""Persons of size still have to fight for fairness against all the bigotry.""

(In actuality, Gloria probably would already have gotten in trouble for her inappropriate outfits if she were average size, but since she is fat nobody wants to be the one to criticize her appearance for fear of a blowup.  Meanwhile, it is open knowledge that Ralph got special dispensation from the dress code because he insisted it was too expensive to buy dress shirts and sport coats tailored to his size.)

""Have you heard of NAAFA?"" Ralph is really getting into gear now.

Oh would you look at the time?  We better get back to work!  

ifyoucantsaysomethingnicedontsayanythingatall.mom

See you around, Ralph! 

**doinkdoink**

Afternoon at the office.  Time for one more cup of caffeine to help get through these last few hours.  To the break room!

Gloria Bosom is already there, sitting at a table with her back to the door.  Hi, Gloria.

Gloria turns to return the greeting, revealing the infamous bucket sitting on the table in front of her.

She is eating the cake/frosting mess with the yellow plastic shovel.

She is eating cake with a shovel.

Shoveling cake.

From a bucket.

1370204568.0	1fjc27	Hamplanet angry I'm in a handicap spot at the gym.	Tim8080	1314	198	146	"It's been forever since my first post here, for those of you that are new or don't remember me. http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1awv99/excuse_making_hambeast_in_class_shut_down/. 

 
This happened yesterday when I was going to the gym. I get there and pull into the last open handicap spot, I'm a paraplegic and in a wheelchair. I decide to take a few minutes and finish listening to the roosterteeth podcast I had on on the way there. A few moments later there is a blonde hamplanet taping on my window. She was about 5,6 and I'm guessing right around 300lbs and 30 years old. "" why are you parked in this spot, its meant for handicapped people like me""! I'm trying to explain that I am handicapped and show the wheelchair in the front seat. She's still upset and says"" your arms look strong and not everyone has a fancy wheelchair to get around in, you should be more considerate to others. At the point I tell her to fuck off and surprisingly she does and heads into the gym. A few minutes later I do as well.


I notice her staring daggers at me as soon as I start lifting. About 10-15 minutes into my workout she comes over to me and continues to bother  me, fat logic and fat excuses abound. I'm trying to focus and completely ignore her. This makes her mad, as I'm wheeling away to put a dumbbell back she actually grabs my shoulder causing me to drop a 50lb dumbbell making a large crash. 


At that point I've had enough, with everyone watching the commotion I yell what the fuck and wheel away to the front desk and explain everything to the GM. She of course follows and keeps interrupting and generally making a ass of herself. Unfortunately for her I'm well known by the staff/ trainers and was even given a free membership GM revokes her membership and asks her to leave. Hamplanet is furious at that point and continues to make a scene, only leaves when GM threatens to call the police. "	t5_2vzax	True

**For part 1 of my delicious saga, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1idygp/tales_from_it_pt1_please_do_not_lick_the_keyboard/)**

I never expected my retribution to come so quick for laughing at this woman's response to me telling her that she was prohibited from receiving anymore equipment from IT unless she proved that she would treat it correctly, instead of turning it into the cesspool I found it in. 

After my poor underling came back (He never broke anything again) and told me of the barrage of insults he received against him and his manhood from this female worker, I became enraged. How dare she think she can make sexual remarks in the workplace! Being a female in a higher IT position, I know that there is a difference between the jokes, and the downright nasty remarks, and calling a 16 year old boy a ""Small dicked hazard to society"" is stepping over the line. I don't care if you mention boobies and dicks, just don't mention anyone's specific boobies or dicks in the workplace, easy kind of thing to follow.

It was quitting time (of the same day that my last story occurred) and I decide to give up on trying to help this woman any further until I had a few stiff drinks and an 8 hour sleep. Before I leave, however, I immediately deal with this sexual harassment by telling my department head, her department head, and HR. The poor boy was mortified, so I was trying to keep it on the down low as possible, to see if we can get it sorted without the usual 'office gossip'. 

LOLNOPE

&gt;Sort out the right forms and send them off

&gt;Homeward bound!

&gt;Why didn't I turn my phone off tonight?

&gt;Oh that's right, I had my sister in the hospital and my other phone was on the bink (that damn S3 firmware problem)

&gt;Oh god, my sister has something wrong with her!

In a panic, I try and blindly answer my phone as the light burns my retinas

&gt;Haha, it's just a few emails

&gt;Just a few emails...

&gt;Just a few...

15 emails. All from *her*.

&gt;""I SAW THE ACCUSATIONS YOU MADE AGAINST ME YOU BITCH. HOW DARE YOU BELIEVE ONE OF YOUR STUPID INTERNS AS OPPOSED TO THE WORD OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HERE FOR 8 YEARS?! I HAVE POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THIS COMPANY, AND NOW I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR INSOLENCE""

Translators note: deciphered from whale to human. Despite the keyboard being replaced on her computer, she probably still wasn't hitting keys properly. A+ for eloquence though.

&gt;Wait... she didn't get a copy of that email

&gt;Oh fuck

&gt;Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck

&gt;Send off sneeky email to my intern, tell him to take a paid day off tomorrow. I don't want him to feel uncomfortable with what I feel looming in the distance

&gt;Poor kid, very shy, doesn't need to have sexual harassment thrown in his face while trying to make it in this world without a highschool certificate

At the time, as I was drifting off into a drunken slumber, I realized what had happened. This 'real lady' had infiltrated one of the HR managers, an introverted man with close to no people skills (rather a strange job for him to be in, but he got the job done), and had absolutely no luck with the ladies. After recalling memories of him bragging about a 'larger' woman that he had been enjoying his nights with, I found the inescapable conclusion as to how the fuck she knew about this complaint... he was sleeping with the manager to keep her job and gather information.

This is where the Zeus analogy kicks in, because not even the great and mighty swan fucker would touch this thing with a 10m pole. It takes a certain type of person, deprived of human contact for so long, to even consider such desperate actions as an option.

&gt;Oh, just entering my office building

&gt;Oh quiet office, how I love yo-

&gt;Wait, who is in here?

And low and behold, the lard monster had managed to barge her way through my department head and seat herself directly on my spare chair, which probably to her surprise, was not covered in litter.

&gt;""YOU GOTTA GET SOME BIGGER CHAIRS DOWN HERE SO WE CAN ALL BE ACCOMMODATED. ANOTHER THING I'LL BE TELLING YOUR DEPT. HEAD""

&gt;""Oh, well good morning to you as well. Why are you in here?""

&gt;politeness.exe has failed, would you like to sent a report to Microsoft?

&gt;""I saw the little 'accusation' you've made against MY good name, and I've come to demand you retract those claims, and demote you""

&gt;""DEMOTE me...""

&gt;""Yes, you've clearly swindled your way into a nice office you don't deserve, so I'll be giving your Dept. Head another reason to kick you back out into a cubicle with all the other interns""

&gt;Other interns

&gt;Interns

&gt;She thinks I'm an intern

&gt;Actually begin to laugh

&gt;""THIS ISN'T AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO LAUGH IF YOU WANT YOUR CAREER TO EVEN BEGIN IN THIS COMPANY""

&gt;Laugh harder

&gt;""Well, this will make it all the more easier to have you FIRED, you bloody interns have no respect""

&gt;Gasp for breath

&gt;""So you've come here to make all these claims, without actually checking who I am?""

&gt;""Well, if you were not an intern, you would have actually been able to HELP me instead of sending that lovely man to replace my equipment""

&gt;""The lovely boy you called a hazard to society?""

&gt;""It was hardly a bad comment, I wanted to tease him!""

Then it kind of hit me. She thought my intern was above me. She made the sexual remarks offhand to try and garner his... attention. Social nuance had jumped out the window to commit suicide. I was tempted to follow.

&gt;""That man is one of our 16 year old interns. The only reason I ever came to your office in the first place was because you said it was an advanced PC issue. I only deal with the IT issues that are actually issues, and not self inflicted by lack of basic hygiene""

&gt;""Well, he clearly has more experience than you!""

&gt;""Oh, well I'll guess I'll take my 7 years of experience and 4 years in university and leave then! I'm sure Rio Tinto are still looking for an SQL server admin""

After realizing my terminology had flown over her head, I planned to subtly text my Dept. head to lend a hand, as I had no idea where on earth this discussion was leading, and I had some computers to actually bother with, but as though he had read my mind, he peeked his head in my door.

&gt;""So you're the one whom our intern has made an accusation against. Well, considering you've violated our 'anonymous reporting' policy regarding sexual harassment, I'm going to ignore the policy of being polite and tell you to get the hell out""

In a huff, our lard lover leaves, not before struggling to get out of the normal sized chair, and breaking one of the arm rests in the process, signing off with a literal 

&gt;""Teehee, sorry!""

I felt like the rage inside me was going to erupt like Mt Vesuvius

&gt;""How the hell are we going to tell our intern that he is safe at this company anymore?! He is a shy lad, can barely talk to any woman, let alone deal with the barrages from her. And she clearly doesn't respect me""

My Dept. Head looked at me, shook his head, and told me to notify someone in HR that was not our Mr DeseperateRomantic that not only had she maid threats against my position, but attempted to justify sexual harassment in the workplace.

Apparently my Dept. Head had been doing a little digging, and found out Lard Lover's boss was doing all she could to fire her ass, but HR had insisted that she was a ""valuable member"" of our office team, and to ensure that her office was kept just as she liked it.

&gt;Oh sweet chocolate jesus, she had HR wrapped around her finger

&gt;Still manage to send off sexual harassment forms to another manager, and ask them to keep quiet

&gt;Tea time!

&gt;dat chai

&gt;*bzzz*

&gt;Huh... lets see what fuckery has bestowed itself upon me this time

&gt;""We have received a complaint of bullying from Lard Lover regarding your actions while performing basic IT duties on her computer""

&gt;""Basic IT duties""

&gt;""Basic""

&gt;Feel a small 'snap' in my brain

I storm into my Dept. Head's office, who had been cc'd in on the email. He knew exactly what my reaction would be.

&gt;""You. Me. HR's floor. Now.""

And off we went, my little blubberbuts, to my third installment of ""How to train a whale; basic etiquette for the larger woman who really needs to clue in"". I'm almost angry just writing this out, but don't you worry, there is sweet, sweet justice involved later. Sweet, disgusting justice. 

Oh, and for those wondering how she managed to send emails when everything was caked in sauce, she was using her iPhone."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;we'll call them Jennifer hamiston (5'3"" 250lbs) and hamgelina jolie (5'5'"" 350lbs)

&gt;super hot day for Canada (32• C or 98•F)

&gt;decided to get my self a softcone from McDick's

&gt;eating it at my desk

&gt;hamiston and hamgelina turn around and immediately start scoffing and sighing

&gt;Hamiston: ""You know, you really shouldn't be eating that in front us! That's extremely rude""

&gt;Me: ""What?....""

&gt;Hamgelina: ""You can eat whatever you want and it doesn't affect you. We both have thyroid issues so we can't just eat ice cream anytime we want...be considerate"" 

&gt;Me: *licks ice cream and gets back to work. Haven't spoken to either of them since.

TL;DR: fat people think I'm mean for eating ice cream.

1373202121.0	1hsth3	Sandwich artistry at its finest.	Dna87	1336	240	207	"May the beetus be with you fellow planets.
My last post was more depressing than funny so I've decided to tell you about my experience in a UK Subway a few months ago that even to this day leaves my jimmies rustled.

This takes place at a Subway 5 minutes walk from a city university. Pretty well frequented by the local student and staffed almost exclusively with students right to the management level.

&gt;Ordering my sandwich.

&gt;Ham and turkey flatbread, salad and sweet onion sauce.

&gt;Aw yis.

&gt;Suddenly the lights start to flicker, the drinks machine start spraying beetus juice all over the floor without anyone touching it, the microwaves scream in anticipation.

&gt;A gothopotamus has seperated from it's herd and entered Subway looking for shelter and sustenance.

&gt;We shall call him Nine Inch Moobs, NIM for short.

&gt;NIM queues behind me and begins his order.

&gt;Foot long BBQ rib on herb and cheese bread, double meat, double cheese, double pepper cheese. Extra grated cheese on top.

&gt;I sit down and start eating my flatbread. Genuinely fascinated. The beast was a fine specimen. 5'6 at most and must be well over 400 pounds.

&gt;NIM sheepishly approaches the salad section. Eyes it as though it wishes to do him serious harm.

&gt;""No salad, nothing green, when making this sandwich I want you to think of anything green as an enemy"".

&gt;Nearly choke on a piece of gherkin while stifling a laugh. Can barely breath. The beast might be onto something.

&gt;Finally, the sauces.

&gt;Double bbq sauce, double mayo, double ketchup.

&gt;Time to pay.

&gt;NIM puts his card in the reader, enters his pin. Payment not accepted. Tries again. Not accepted.

&gt;""Well I've got the money in the account so obviously your chip and pin machines broken, so what are we going to do here?""

&gt;I used that machine 5 minutes ago. It's working fine.

&gt;Fine gentleman behind the desk tells him the location of the nearest cash machine. 2 minute walk away. They'd be happy to keep the sandwich warm until he gets back.

&gt;NIM is not having it. Demands his sandwich for free. 

&gt;Is told no. If he doesn't want to pay they'll throw the sandwich out and he gets nothing.

&gt;NIM storms out. Stops at the door and yells how he shouldn't have to take this crap from a fucking sandwich maker.

&gt;Student bro behind the counter bursting with pure alphaness, points at NIM and yells one of the finest responses I've ever heard.

&gt;""BITCH, I AM A SANDWICH ARTIST!"".

And so our story ends. 

I still live the same city and eat at that subway when I have the chance, hoping that my sandwich will be topped with some of the alpha that the artist exhibited that day.

She's always been a big girl - by the time we were 17, she was 5'6, 230 lbs. She complained about her weight sometimes, but she never blamed it on thyroid or injuries. She knew why she was fat; she was open about her overeating. She just never had the motivation to change herself.
Until. . . 

&gt; be at county fair with Star

&gt; goodtimesarehad.jpg

&gt; ""lets go on that ride!"" 

&gt; point to super-awesome, kick-ass, swinging pendulum ride

It should be noted that we had gone to the fair before, and had ridden most of the rides there. The one we were about to ride had just been acquired by the fair so, fuck yeah, we were gonna ride it!

&gt; get to front of line

&gt; previous ride ends and we head on to seat ourselves

&gt; I sit and pull down harness until it clicks in place

&gt; look over to Star

&gt; her harness doesn't go down all the way

&gt; ride conductor comes over to help her

&gt; still doesn't go down all the way

&gt; she's too big

&gt; ""I'm sorry, ma'am, you won't be able to ride. It's not safe.""

&gt; Star gets a look of utter devastation and embarrassment

&gt; I ask to be taken off too, because that's my best friend and I don't want to ride without her

&gt; leave fair, on the way home now

&gt; Star confesses to me that she's never been that embarrassed in her life, cries, and asks if I have any advice on how to become healthier/lose weight

&gt; She starts to go on walks with me

&gt; and bike rides

&gt; starts eating salads and ordering water whenever we go out to lunch

&gt; so proud of her

It's been four years now since that fair incident and so far Star has lost 105 lbs and gained a bunch of confidence. She even started going on dates (which she had never gone on before), and has a steady boyfriend now. She looks amazing and I am so proud of my best friend. 

Epilogue: We went back to the fair last year and finally rode that ride! It was awesome."	t5_2vzax	True
1375229090.0	1jdx0v	Tales from IT: An update with a REAL Lawyer	ohgodwhydoineedthis	1378	298	142	"Oh my little diabetes monsters, your patience serves you well. I am now here to tell you most recent update on my most delightful co-worker, Mr Desperate Romantic, and his squeeze, LardLover.

&gt;Getting into work

&gt;Australian winters making it just cold enough to need a scarf

&gt;Nargh, give me tea NOW

For those of you who don't want to bother reading through my saga full of disgusting descriptions of the most fatlogic proportions, I currently work as a senior manager in IT, am a female (from previous misgivings with LardLover and women in the office, this detail is needed), and have been dealing with the repercussions of LardLover's original call to me for ""advanced IT support help"". This eventually resulted in one of my interns being sexually harassed by her, me finding McDonalds in a freshly disheveled bathroom stall from her rumpus, and Mr DesperateRomantic being audited in his job in HR, because he kept LardLover there, claiming 'disability' benefits without proof. He was the poor chap who was on the receiving end of her McDonald's fueled 'rumpus'

Oh, and turns out LardLover didn't actually do any work at all!

&gt;Walk into office this morning

&gt;Finally have tea inside of muh tummy

&gt;Dept. Head comes in for a morning chat

&gt;Oh how nice it is to be able to relax before checking tickets

We got to chatting, this morning, about how he was contacted by a real lawyer this time! A real one! None of this 'brother' business! He didn't want to update me, or anyone else in the workforce until he had cleared up any legal repercussions. Apparently the whole fiasco went something like this....

&gt;Be IT Dept head, trying to delegate some new projects out

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;This had better be something damn important

&gt;""Hello, I'm [Lawyer from fancy company] calling on behalf of LardLover. Am I to understand you are the superior of [ohgodwhydoineedthis]?""

&gt;""I suggest you call our legal department""

&gt;Hangs up, suspecting 'brotherly' mischief

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;""I don't think you're taking this very seriously. There are thousands of dollars at stake""

&gt;""Call the legal department""

&gt;Hangs up again

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;""I hope you know I will take you people for all you have! This is a serious matter and I dou-""

&gt;Hangs up

&gt;Two hours pass

&gt;*boop boop boop*

&gt;""Hey, its Bob from legal. I think you should get up here. I'm not sure if I should be taking this seriously""

&gt;Realizes LardLover isn't shitting around anymore

&gt;Goes up to legal, trying to push the ideas of possibly settling with this beast for made up charges

&gt;Goes into Bob's office

&gt;""Look. This lawyer is claiming all sorts of discrimination and even abuse. They want to try and settle out of court, but they're demanding that they will only do that if [ohgodwhydoineedthis] and ShyIntern are fired.""

&gt;""Why the hell are you thinking about settling then?""

&gt;""Because they've made a pretty good case against us. I just am incredulous about firing people with the settlement pay out""

My beautiful Dept Head then very thoroughly laid out all the evidence that LardLover had been stealing from the company through claiming disability benefits without proof, destruction of property she caused, sexual abuse she committed and knowingly using a fake lawyer to try and threaten the company.

Apparently no one told Bob.

&gt;Back in my office, this morning

&gt;Dept Head just received a phone call from the really real lawyer!

&gt;He is dropping the case and called to apologize for being so rude before

&gt;Apparently LardLover had made him do the phone calls in front of her, to make sure he was 'sufficiently demanding enough'

&gt;Legal professionalism? What legal professionalism? 

We chortle along, amusing ourselves over the claims she had made against us in the company. Everything from disability discrimination to sexism and even some shit about the women in the company being 'double crossers'. 

And then we come to news about Mr DesperateRomantic, whom had literally been hiding the progress reports that detailed how *little* work she had been submitting. By little, I mean constant complaints about all the nothing she was doing, all the time. Not a single report, not a single finished project. All complaints were kept under wraps, any higher complaints out of Mr DesperateRomantic's hands were leveled under the guise of 'disabilities'. 

&gt;Dept Head almost giggles his head off

&gt;Apparently he was fired last week Friday, and LardLover came in to help him 'clear out his desk'

&gt;Security isn't what is used to be around here

&gt;So glad I was unawares

&gt;LardLover goes through the fridges in the lunch rooms, clearing anything out of them that she thinks won't be noticed

&gt;All office bought coffee and tea, gone

&gt;Pens, rulers, paper, subtly stowed away in boxes that are being moved away on behalf of Mr DesperateRomantic

&gt;Managed to get all the boxes loaded

&gt;Security only stopped them when they tried to take away his super comfy leather chair

&gt;Facilities now sending them the bill for all the stolen supplies they recorded that day

&gt;If they don't pay it, they're going to be sending in the police

Considering she still hasn't paid for the refurbishment of her destroyed office, I doubt she will be paying for the things she stole. I'm damn glad I bring my own tea to the office.

So yes, a morsel of an update for you lot. I may have more as the day progresses... there are a lot of jaded colleagues who had to deal with her."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; find it continually amusing that since Starbeetus has changed its Fupaccino recipe, the public now believes them to be “healthy.” Healthy my ass.

&gt; it will give you an ass.

&gt; “Two VENTI Fupaccinos with extra curmulz.”

&gt; “Okay, and would you both like whipped cream on--”

&gt; “Those are for ME.” 

&gt; stare for a nanosecond in utter confusion before realizing Lady Fupa intends to down not one but TWO Fupaccions on her own. 

&gt; recover

&gt; “Of course, no problem, sorry--”

&gt; “WHADDYA MEAN ‘OF COURSE,’ MISSY? JUST BECAUSE I’VE GOT SOME EXTRA MEAT ON MY BONES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUDGE ME LIKE THAT? MAYBE I JUST WANT SOME ICED TEA.”

&gt; “...do you?”

&gt; Mistake: Located

&gt; “NO, I DON’T. I JUST TOLD YOU I WANTED TWO FUPACCINOS.”

&gt; “R-right, I’m so sorry. So just two venti extra curmulz fupaccinos?”

&gt; “I don’t want any of the WATERy milk.”

To save you twenty lines of dialogue: usually people who like 2% or whole milk consider nonfat/skim milk too watery. THIS Hamplanet, though, had a much more refined palate than most and considered WHOLE milk to be the “watery milk.” Her dairy of choice was straight up heavy whipping cream.

Her final order was essentially 12 ounces of heavy whipping cream, 3 ounces of syrup (that’s 12 pumps for your smarticles out there), ice, and a quarter inch of caramel drizzled all over the inside of the cup AND on top of the whipped cream. I think this motherfucker was around 1,000 calories easily and she got two.

&gt; second Land Whale approaches register to order.

&gt; asks if I would be willing to blend a brownie into her fupaccino.

&gt; hesitantly agree because I’ve done it before and... at this point, what the fuck, right? What’s a 480-calorie brownie in the dietary scheme of things?

&gt; the beast opens its mouth.

&gt; “I shouldn’t have to pay for two brownies, two drinks, AND all those extra charges, you know. It isn’t fair to ask so much more money from me than you do from everyone ELSE.”

&gt; customers behind her are gaping in shock and awe. neverseenthismuchstupid.wut

&gt; also, they want these two to move the fuck outta the way so everyone else can order.

&gt; I move to monitor my baby baristas as they are carrying out the delicate Fupaccino operation. 

&gt; we only haz 2 browniez, guyz.

&gt; no mess ups.

&gt; blend enough creamy, sugary, frozen death to feed four people for the day and hand it over.

&gt; Go go gadget winning smile. “Here you are, ladies. I have your Fupaccinos. Would you like a carrying tray?”

&gt; “Naw, they won’t last long.”

&gt; my ponytail wiggles like their nine chins.

&gt; final gem on the way out:

&gt; Fupa Queen 1: “How many points is this in Weight Watchers points?”

&gt; Fupa Queen 2: “Coffee doesn’t count. It has no calories.”

**tl;dr Remembering the most calorie-laden beverages I ever had the pleasure of serving while working at Starbeetus.**


**Edit:** So I went back to the company's products' nutrition labels and worked out the actual, magical quantities of calories and nutrients ingested since it was pointed out that my thought process at the time--assuming the drinks were 1,000 calories--was flawed. Most likely because I couldn't wrap my brain around numbers that high.

**Base Fupaccino:** 560 calories / 24 g fat / 76 g sugar

**Brownie:** 480 calories / 24 g fat / 30 g sugar

**Additional Quantities introduced by upgrading from Whole to Heavy Cream:** 750 calories / 106 g fat / 0.5 g sugar (must be healthier!)

**Added Syrups and Toppings:** 240 calories / N/A fat / 60 g sugar

**Whopping Grand Total:** 2,030 calories / 154 g fat / 166.5 g sugar

&gt;she has a pool

&gt;we decide to go, to enjoy some free food, cool water, and a giant helping of whale blubber

&gt;take my car because Nine Inch Sandwich lives out in bumfuck nowhere

&gt;I have a pretty small car, can fit 5 normal to 3 hamplanet-in-training sized people in it with some squeezing. 

&gt;We swing by store to grab a sixpack, some wine, and veggie burgers

&gt;arrive to what is a small, normal looking house with a small front yard, hear music and people inside the backyard

&gt;find street parking about 3 blocks away, pretty good find

&gt;knock at door

&gt;suddenly the wine begins to ripple like crazy

&gt;flock of animals run out of the surrounding area for higher ground

&gt;the smell hits us full force; sweat, mold, an animal or two that had long since resigned itself to burial amongst the folds

&gt;Rage against the Diet Machine zeroes in on bf and me

&gt;trundles up to us

&gt;""hey JAN want to play chicken?""

&gt;run to grill to eat

&gt;should have known this was the worst place to hide

&gt;we turn away to get food

&gt;grill man quickly tells us to stay away from the potato salad as Hamastodon made it

&gt;find the creation he is describing in a giant tub, has bacon and more mayonaise in it than I have seen in my life.

&gt;steer clear, grab salad and some corn-on-the-cob, ask grill man to throw on the veggie burgers, see people have been eating them

&gt;slams next to bf, grabbing corn cob off table

&gt;asks for two patties and a sausage

&gt;watch Children of Bacon assemble a genocide of a burger

&gt;hand goes towards mayo, and chokes that bottle like it killed her hamplanet family

&gt;Ziggy Bacondust and the Hamplanets like Mars chows down at a disgusting speed, and all we can do is watch

&gt;bf asks me if i want to go soon, this is turning into Stalker Fest 3000

&gt;Deathrace Burger King starts whining about how we can't go yet, they're going to have a wet shirt contest soon

&gt;jesustakethewheel.flac

&gt;we want to leave, but Hamthrax guards aggressively, so we take a beer and go sit down by the pool praying she won't follow

&gt;thankfully she doesn't, instead we watch her scuttle over to the iPod dock

&gt;starts playing Beyonce's Crazy In Love and dancing

&gt;by dancing i mean gyrating so hard that several chairs gravitate over and join her orbit

&gt;Nopenopenope Smarshmellow Mouth has gone too far.

Okay I am so sorry this is unbearably long. At this point, i was seriously tired of her shit, and wanted to book it out of there. But one of my bf's friends needed a ride, and was trying to get a female coworker to hang out at his place /me and bf wingmaning it up/. so we decide to stay for MAX 1 hour.

&gt;while watching in the jelly wobbling show in horro someone approaches us and asks us if it's true we have a car

&gt;apparently Beheamamoth didn't think to buy any beer for everyone, and the party is getting soberer by the second.

&gt;we volunteer to drive over to somewhere to grab some with the guy who asked, and make our way out to the car

&gt;Meatsled Zepplin sees us leaving, and immediately runs at us, demanding to come (has no idea where we're going)

&gt;soaking wet Fat Benetar says she HAS to go get beers, shes really knowledgeable about that stuff

&gt;alrightythen.mp4

&gt;we make Snack Sabbath put on a shirt and and grab towels to accommodate her sopping wet tundra of an ass

&gt;there are four of us and bf calls shotgun with the vigilance of a man knowing the fate that will await him if he dares sit within two feet of her

&gt;then the most beautiful thing happened

&gt;Chin Lizzy couldn't get into the Prius

&gt;SHE COULD NOT FIT INTO THE CAR

&gt;it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen

&gt;she followed it up by kicking the car and saying it was a bullshit piece of trash that probably wasn't safe to drive

&gt;ALLOFMYSIDES.HALP

Jesus this is a novel. She stalked back home humiliated, and self righteous. We got beer, got back and grabbed our two friends. Managed to dip out when she was in the bathroom doing god knows what. Later bf got angry text about leaving before giving her a hug. Yup.

Stay tuned for more tales of Hamthrax!!! Boyfriend will come home in evening and hopefully help me out with the next one!

Be a 27 year old cripple. Gimping around on my spiffy cane and going to school on the GI Bill. [Feelsgoodman.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W44FPOk.jpg)

Finishing up my Psych minor with a couple of summer classes. One was a 4000 level cognitive psychology course. It's balls out tough, but we have an insanely smart professor and we're all [gung ho](http://imgur.com/gallery/Kz0su) for it. 

The professor starts in with the intro and lets us know what's expected of us. The dude was actually really cool. He started off by saying the first day was the easy day and he wanted to get to know us and for us to get to know each other, because we'd need to help each other to get through the material. And he reiterated that it was going to be three months of material packed into three weeks. Hurt me good, Sir. 

Five minutes late, enter [Tries To Top You, or T3Y](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-4022-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0#.UcOVKpxcvIZ) for short. The professor says to her ""Look, today is a freebie, but you need to be on time for this class. We're going to be moving fast and you can't afford to miss anything"". ""I have four kids. I'm doin' my best here!"" she replied in a waaay too loud voice. 

Unlike a lot of college kids, who sit in the back and try to blend in to the crowd, I've learned that if you sit up front and answer questions, that goes a long way come grading time. So I have the front four seater table to myself. I'm a grade whore(Honestly, you're paying for me to be there with taxes, so I kind of owe it to you to try and do well).

So four empty seats in a row. Where does she sit? Right the fuck next to me. Fucking hell. So we start meeting each other and the professor comes to each group to talk to us. My first conversation with T3Y set the tone for the course. 

""So what happened to your leg there?""

""It was a parachuting accident in the army""

""Oh cool""(Seriously... Cool?)

""Um. Yeah. So anyway, tell me about yours-"" She interrupts.

""My brother is with Delta Force at Ft.Sill""

""...""

""He's a bad ass""

""That's not where Delta is based out of""

""Pff, that's what they tell you""

For the record. I was in Ranger recon. I kinda knew for a fact that she was full of shit, but I let it slide. I couldn't tell if she was lying or if she was being lied to, but it didn't cost me anything to humor her.

Till later that week. 

I was in the hall before class and studying with a very sweet girl. I brought a breakfast of mixed fruit to eat before class and I had made her a plate out of the top of the container. I heard the handicap elevator open and out strolls T3Y. Mind you, this is the handicap elevator. I don't even use it because I need the exercise. 

She strolls on over and seriously looked at the fruit and looked at Sweet Girl and said ""Eeeww. Why do you eat that stuff? You don't need to get any skinnier."" then looked at me and said ""Honey, if you want real food, you should get with me. I ain't gonna make you eat that stuff. That's why she can't keep a man"". Sweet Girl was speechless. She just stood up and muttered ""I have to go"" and left like she was going to cry. 

Blinding rage. Sweet Girl was actually having problems with her boyfriend who was active duty in the army and suffering from PTSD. He was drifting away from her and she was worried about him. She told this to her friend after class and T3Y butted in and got all of the info. I had only recently heard about it because she asked me about my experience with PTSD in relationships.

Oh, I was pissed. 

""I can't fucking believe you.""

""What?""

""She's going through some tough shit right now and you decide that you can just fuck with her head? For what? I'm not getting with her. I'm **damn** sure not getting with you! What the fuck would make you think that's ok?!""

She just shrugged ""I'm just sayin, you outta get with a real girl with curves instead of that skinny bitch"".

If that had been a guy, I might be writing this from a jail cell. 

Class started and she tried to sit next to me and I said, in my best NCO voice ""Don't fucking sit by me. Find an empty seat on the far side of the table. I'm done with your shit."".

So the professor just starts in with class. Fast paced and all. The tubby fuck pulls out a ""breakfast"". I don't know how a bag of Doritos qualifies but that's my best guess given the time of day. 

The professor started getting sidetracked by the crunching and straight up said ""Alright, either put it away, or leave and take an absence. I'm not talking over that"". 

""I have a thyroid condition. I have to eat. You can't tell me I can't or I'll make a complaint""

My time to shine motherfucker

""If she does have a medical condition, it needs to be registered with Disabled Services to allow a rule exemption and be confirmed by an MD. Like that form I gave you about my leg if I'm ever late to class. Speaking as a person with a medical background. If her condition was that bad, she'd be in a hospital right now."" To her ""I bet your Delta Force brother didn't tell you that Special Operation medics are only a few credit hours away from being PAs"".

[Awww Yeah](http://imgur.com/gnuSg)

Fatty tries to tell me ""Well my cousin's a doctor and-""

Professor ""and he doesn't work here. Put it away or leave."" 

She left. She was absent for three days of material for a bag of Doritos.

Later in the course, we were discussing trauma, specifically how trauma hinders cognitive ability. We were using Phineas Gage as an example. In the middle of part of the lecture, I mean, mid-sentence, T3Y piped up ""Why don't they just get over it? Things ain't that bad"" 

Even the professor was like ""What the he... um, what do you mean?""

""People just need to get over it. I watch this show, were people talk about their problems. And they just need to get over it"". 

Sweet Girl spoke up ""Sir, she thinks we're talking about psychological trauma."" mimicking T3Y ""Honey, we're talking about a guy who had a railroad spike blown through his brain. That's hard to just get over.""

Fist Bump

To ease this pain, she left for an hour. In class mind you and came back with a Burger King cup. Captain Obvious: If you don't want to eat comfort food all the time, don't be a bitch to everyone.

And for the grand finale. On the day of the final. T3Y actually saw all of us in the hallway and asked if we would give witness statements against the professor. She was failing the course and she (I'm not making this up) said it was because he discriminates against fat people. Everyone basically told her to fuck off. I actually loved a fellow classmate, fat black girl, who said ""Bitch, I'm bigger than you and I've never had less than a B on an exam"". Fat Black Girl actually raised her hand and told the professor what T3Y was planning before the final. 

So, SG and her boyfriend are still going strong. She called both of us and asked if it was ok for us to talk to each other. I gave him a call and convinced him to go see a shrink about his PTSD. It's an ongoing process. Fat black girl is cool as hell. She's my partner in an education class I'm taking this month. And T3Y failed the course. 

**Edit:** Thank you guys for giving me positive feedback. I tend to keep to myself most of the time. But getting well wishes here does help me keep moving out there. Thanks again.

Edit2: My room mate's mother died this weekend. So, I'm going to be busy with him for a bit. I'll try to answer questions for a bit, but I might not get to you. sorry.

Usually what I did was tutoring and occupational therapy. I had one child who had down syndrome who was ten at the time, I'll call her C, where this story takes place. 

&gt;be me, young Britta in college. 5'2, ~125 lbs. 

&gt;be sweet little C, very tiny 11 year old. ~40 lbs.

Before you think ""oh boy, that's extremely underweight for a ten year old, I must defend C's parents, who did absolutely everything in their power to help C gain weight. The problem with people who have down syndrome though, is that sometimes swallowing can be a huge issue for them, which C had and caused her to be underweight. 

&gt;love C dearly, very defensive of people who stare or act rude to her. 

&gt;enjoy work days with her, playing and learning math and reading books together. 

&gt;one day C's mom asks me to take C to her school's science fair, C had a booth there. 

&gt;C and i go to science fair, C's booth was something abut nutrition that her school aides clearly made for her. 

&gt;have fun talking to kids, most are more or less nice to C.

&gt;[mfw](http://media.tumblr.com/9e3f811a4b9a4319f825a3546200ae26/tumblr_inline_mnu89al3U41qz4rgp.gif) C and i get to have fun teaching her peers about nutrition and science.

&gt;but alas, nothing is perfect.

&gt;ground begins to shake, lights flicker, jimmies are set to rumbled. 

&gt;in walks ham family into gym. 

&gt;don't see them at first, merely *feel* their quaking steps. 

&gt;greasy gluttonous mom (GGM), and dead weight dad (DWD) each weight at least 350 lbs. 

&gt;(not so small) piglet son waddles in behind them carrying a bag of mcdicks.

&gt;beady eyes scanning projects done by fifth graders. 

&gt;piglet sees hammy brother's set up (something about tornadoes or some shit) and huffs and puffs over to him.

&gt;focus back on C who is talking to a peer, who is telling her she has the same name as her.

&gt;awhsweet.

&gt;look over back at ham family, they're gone.

&gt;[magic.jpeg](http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Wicca%20&amp;%20Witchcraft/criss_angel-satanism.jpg)

&gt;look back over at C, see a disturbance in the force.

&gt;see ham family slowly making their way through the set ups of each child.

&gt;looking more and more unimpressed with each project.

&gt;shoulda done tornadoes, i suppose.

&gt;am not too concerned, most people aren't horrible enough to be openly rude to C, even if she has a booth actively oppressing fatties with her thin privilege. 

&gt;they arrive.

&gt;[theyrehere.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb9a0b4MUF1qgcra2o1_500.gif)

&gt;piglet looks through C's project, then looks C up and down. 

&gt;C sort of shrugs him off, not able to tell hammie's gonna blow. 

At this point I'm picking up and rethinking my previous thought that no one i this horrible and shit might get ugly. My hackles are up.

&gt;i will protect you, C. 

&gt;""ah think this food pyramid is stupid."" slurs piglet.

&gt;C doesn't have much to say about that. Looks at me, fearful. 

&gt;""well why is that?"" I say to him, afraid of the logically invalid response.

&gt;""ah eat way more than that and i'm healthy.""

&gt;oh no. what do i do. can't tell a kid they are fat.

&gt;""oh really?""

&gt;""yep, ma mom says ah am perfectly normal for my age range.""

&gt;kid must have been 140lbs at 8 years old.

&gt;oh god what do i do.

&gt;stare.

&gt;C stares. 

&gt;""why are you giving ma son that nasty look?""

&gt;wat.

&gt;GGM is staring at me arms cross, grease rolling down her forehead.

&gt;""i'm sorry ma'am, i guess that's just the way my face is.""

&gt;""ah saw you, glaring at him and judging him. you probably think he's fat. well he's healthier than your child. she's wasting away, clearly starving.""

&gt;404 reaction not found.

&gt;mfw this woman thinks a ten year old kid is mine, even though I am clearly no older than 20. 

&gt;mfw she is implying i am a bad ""parent"" for having a child with obvious developmental issues.

&gt;mfw she's insulting the appearance of C.

&gt;""excuse me ma'am, i don't think it is appropriate to comment on another child's weight.""

&gt;""it's not like she understand wat i'm sayin anyways.""

&gt;mfw

&gt;mfw

&gt;mfw i have no face.

&gt;""ma'am, as the current aide of this child i'm going to have you to leave this booth.""

&gt;""wat, because i called you out? it's okay for you to call my child fat but as soon as i say a skinny disabled kid is unhealthy it's to far?""

&gt;no. nope. no. neit. 

&gt;""excuse me ma'am, that is highly offensive. this is a child, and i know for a fact she understands what you are saying. please leave.""

&gt;at this point C is crying, because no shit someone is insulting how she looks. 

&gt;i'm fuming but i can't make a scene in from of a bunch of ten year olds and soccer moms. 

&gt;""wateva, you fat shamer. you and your skinny child can keep on starving yourselves.""

&gt;wait for it.

&gt;""i bet you're single anyways. men like curves, bones are for dogs.""

&gt;[picard.facepalm](http://geek-news.mtv.com//wp-content/uploads/geek/2012/11/picard-facepalm2.jpg)

&gt;""GET AWAY FROM THIS CHILD."" 

&gt;slightly louder, not enough to make a scene. 

&gt;fat bitch waddles away, flips me off.

&gt;in front of a gym of children.

&gt;in the direction of a disabled child. 

&gt;all of my wats.

&gt;tell C she is beautiful, and compliment her pretty features like her nice lips and shiny hair. tell her she's more beautiful on the inside and out and that's why that woman insulted her. 

&gt;C doesn't understand too terribly well, but stops crying.

&gt;fair ends. 

&gt;take C to a frozen yogurt place. 

&gt;weep for humanity.

1366331799.0	1cn9jl	Navigating the Hamplanetary-System.	OneTwoSkinny	1195	153	103	"&gt;Be me. Be m/25/6'4""/170lbs, lean but fit. Not a gym-goer but I live in the city and ride my bike everywhere.  

&gt;I'm impatient as fuck so bike rides are always full on sprints. No leisure. All business. Got places to be. 

&gt;At work I'm the resident IT guy, as well as wearing many other hats. Office moves to new location. 3 more miles from home. 5 miles each way now. 10 miles of hard cycling every day. Cycling on the weekends too because LOL oil. 

&gt;Move causes round of hiring as we're getting busier. 

&gt;Office is now inhabited by a multi-person hamplanetary-system, with several hambeast satellites. I am the only thin person. Be an asteroid trying to bolt through without getting caught in gravitational pulls. 

&gt;Celestial fatties orbiting their star, the company's owner, 50/f/5'3""/350-375 - nearly a perfect sphere.  The overall office fatness causes a putrid smell constantly. 

&gt;And since the weight of themselves fighting their own gravity was so great, they most certainly had molten cores and required the office temperature to be around 65 degrees to efficiently cool the tectonic sweat mechanics. I was always freezing, and they were STILL sweating. 

&gt;The office kitchen she had stocked was always full of typical fatty-construction-materials. The basic building blocks that form hamplanets. Gallon jug of mayo, two whole shelves of soda, several pounds of butter, etc. Also, lots of noble gas in that area and the bathrooms at all times. 

&gt;Fatties begin to hate themselves and decide to have weightloss contest. 

&gt;[thisgonbgood](http://i.imgur.com/SzpOIQC.gif)

&gt;I'm genuinely excited to see them all wanting to better themselves. So with more tears than you would believe if I described them, they went through the kitchen and threw out all foods.

&gt;They start a chart with everyone's current weight, which causes more tears.  Not a single number under 240lbs...except mine... 

&gt;This is where my struggles truly begin. As they get to my name, I say I will not be participating.  Sure, with work I could maybe safely shave off a couple of pounds.  I'm all muscles and bones for the most part. 

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/yZVgO8S.gif) Hamplanets realize how much smaller I am than everyone else. 

&gt;I feel sudden gravitational shift. The orbits have changed.  I'm singled out suddenly, because I have practically no weight to lose.  I relent and have them weigh me in. The low number displeases the beasts. 

&gt;Suddenly, sneering and commentary about my health begin. I find it all largely benign and move on.  This type of stuff doesn't usually phase me. 

&gt;two weeks pass. 

&gt;Second weigh-in.  Numbers are climbing. Fatties have been cheating. I climb on the scale, and my weight has dropped a pound and a half from the six extra miles of cycling a day.

&gt;angryplanets.gif

&gt;This kicks it off truly.  I'm not yet aware the extent to which the bullying will be taken. 

&gt;Bring my lunch to work every day, usually a sammich and baby carrots. Sometimes a beet salad with balsamic vinegar and tuna. Various fruit because cheap. Shit is delicious. 

&gt;Not aware that in the two weeks the office fridge had filled back up with exactly the same products, just in fatty-logic variety. Gallon of lite mayo, diet coke by the cubic meter, and still butter, because fatties. Low-calorie cookies, candies, and treats.

&gt;I notice because I'm bringing in more salads lately. Getting creative with them. Place one in fridge with my name on it. Get my ass to work. 

&gt;I start to observe office snacking habits. I suppose fatty logic is the Newtonian physics for this solar system. Because low calorie, hamplanets are eating bigger portions, and eating more often. 

&gt;I have some internal lulz, and head to the kitchen for my salad. 

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/7KIPIad.jpg) I walk to the fridge and see my salad tub is empty.

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/hmOVst7.gif) I find the carcass of my lunch in the trash can. 

&gt;Fury doesn't describe it.

&gt;For the next 4 days, someone keeps disposing of my lunch. I'm furious. I ask everyone what's the fucking deal. Every fat maw parts to give me the same rhetoric about how they don't see the problem, I probably don't know how to eat anyway. 

&gt;I fail at finding the fat cunt who's doing this. Celestial wastebanded boss doesn't care. She's actually my prime suspect. 

&gt;Verbal abuse accelerates as days pass.  My girlfriend f/24/5'3""/125 comes in for lunch with me a few days. They berate her. 

&gt;She's not rail thin or anything, got some lovely little jiggly bits in all the right places, but also slim and firm in all the right places.  She has actual curves, not fatty logic curves. Just plain Sexy. 

&gt;The sight of her causes hamplanetary misalignment. They can't handle seeing a girl who's actually ""curvy"", and not fat.  It upsets the fatty physics governing their stable orbits. 

&gt;This gets to her quickly as she'd only recently finally started to feel good about her body after losing some weight.  We start eating at a place we know the fatties will never go, a vegan joint up the road. 

&gt;One night I'm working on a coworker's computer after she had left. I was minimizing windows of food porn, and glanced at her email. 

&gt;The whole office was talking about me behind my back. Talking about how obnoxious I was, how I was cheating in the weight loss contest to stay thin (I wasn't in the fucking contest) 

&gt;And how they should start locking the bathrooms to make sure I wasn't going in their to throw up the snacks the office paid for. 

&gt;Un...Fucking...Believable.

&gt;Stars align. Get email shortly after from a company I used to work for wanting me to come back. More money. Fewer hours. Fewer hambeasts. 

&gt;I decide it's time to get real revenge. I'm always the first one in the office, and I'm always the last one out. 

&gt;Bring superglue on Friday. 

&gt;Wait til everyone leaves. 

&gt;Open fridge and turn temperature up to non food safe levels. Same for freezer. 

&gt;Superglue doors shut.

&gt;Superglue snack cabinet shut. 

&gt;Done with the kitchen. 

&gt;Next, the email server. New rule set up. Any email sent from a company email account to another internal email address gets a server-appended signature line:

&gt;""I'm unhappy because I eat, and I eat because I'm unhappy. If only I could learn self control."" 

&gt;Wait for Monday.

&gt;First one in office. 

&gt;First hamplanet gets to work, and reaches orbit around the kitchen.  

&gt;Pulls fridge door. Nothing. Freezer door. Nothing. Snack cabinet, nothing. 

&gt;Engage freakout. Calls boss. Everything's broken. No snacks. From the tone of the squeeling, you'd assume the building was on fire and she was trapped inside, when the truth is her precious fat cells were burning while her snacks were trapped inside. 

&gt;More hamplanets reach orbit. Boss waddles in. Has had enough. Needs her mahfuckin snacks. She wraps the nebulous fat of her hand around the fridge handle, and uses all the strength she's gained from pulling her bulk up from seated positions, and in one move pulls the handle off of the fridge door. Clean. 

&gt;Orbit lost. Hamplanets start careening in to each other. physics are gone. Their universe is collapsing around them. They begin slingshotting around each other's gravities to gain momentum. 

&gt;The sounds of wheezing and labored breathing are so loud they'd be audible in the vacuum of space.

&gt;One ham colossus kicks the snack cabinet in fury. The momentum of her pendulous mercury-filled foot shatters the door. 

&gt;[mrw](http://i.imgur.com/8VI4riF.gif) I see this happen. 

&gt;[trw](http://i.imgur.com/tQFUWYY.gif) They see something at all to eat. 

&gt;After that, I decided it was time to leave before they realized who had separated them from their fix. I didn't leave soon enough. They ganged up on me with labored insults stealing the precious remains of their breath. 

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/Uh41GN2.gif) I'm trying to push through all of the insulted celestial bodies. 

&gt;I drop off my resignation letter and bolt. None of them can catch me. So angry. 

&gt;be me today, at my new job, no hamplanets, just peace and carrots. 

&gt;be happy. 


There are many, many more stories from my acidic time at that office, if anyone is interested. 

EDIT: turns out ya'll is interested. I'll write a follow up about the aftermath of the fridge and the email server.  I also have NUMEROUS stories from this office.

Quick synopsis: thin Belgian boyfriend (accent and everything) works with death metal mountain Hamthrax. She's got a thing for him; I am visibly shaking in my human sized clothes for fear of losing him to this pile of flesh. 

&gt;Boyfriend usually walks over to the office where I work; it's closer to the subway, so it makes more sense to meet me there

&gt;one day after work, waiting for BF on the sidewalk outside

&gt;ground starts rumbling

&gt;small children shrieks can be heard in distance

&gt;see my boyfriend being followed by what appears to be a mobile building

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/2veRWzA.gif) its Hamthrax

&gt;she's put in her piercings and is wearing a tent with Guns'and'Roses logo painted on. 

&gt;axl rose should pay her billboard royalties

&gt;Chunky lips bulging against lip rings

&gt;wearing skirt that shows of majestic sea of cellulite 

&gt;both see me, bf has instant relief on face that he doesn't have to wait outside this building with the Blob

&gt;Annihileater is not excited to see my ""bony ass"" (most definitely not, got those good slavic hips and a pretty round behind) 

&gt;not a huge fan of PDA usually, but with Hamthrax there, sure why not a mini-makeout sesh with the BF

&gt;when we break apart, Hamthrax has dat hunger/malice in her beady little eyes

&gt;can't tell which

&gt;ohshitnigger.jpg

&gt;makes gagging sound, i am worried undigested food might tumble out of her gullet.

&gt;""you guys are SO gross, totally just lost my appetite""

&gt;jenniferlawrenceyeahokay.gif

&gt;have to walk about a block and a half to the subway

&gt; is sweating like she's in carrying a ammo pack through rice fields in 'Nam

&gt;stench is unbearable, waves of sweat roll off her as if she was the mighty pacific 

&gt;talks ad nauseum about her ""causal lover""

&gt;phrasing.exe

&gt;walks next to bf, tries to make sure he's paying attention to her

&gt;grabs his hand, he pulls it back

&gt;oh my god Jan (pronounces it as the shortening for Janet, not ""Yan"") you're so unaffectionate

&gt;wut...

&gt;continues to call him pussy whipped by me

&gt;""I don't know roomsonrooms, it's probably good you have such a tight leash, our offices is full of real women."" *pats stomach rolls struggling to escape the fabric of her tarp*

&gt;dying on the inside, bf looks like he's about to vomit

&gt;""yeah I'll keep an eye out"" i mutter trying not to melt into a pile of laughter

&gt;walk past whole foods, I ask bf if we need to stop by to get food for dinner

&gt;bf says he wants to pick up a couple things, hoping we can get away from our elephant companion

&gt;Testameat is having none of it, decides she *also* needs to go 

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/MGfIF5n.jpg) 

&gt;sliding doors almost catch on her ""curves""

So like i said in the first story, me and BF are ~~vegetarian~~ pescetarian (sorry guys!) (OMG DAE SMUG?). I don't eat meat just because it makes me feel sick, and I have a digestive issue, he's just to lazy to cook meat, also doesn't care too much for it. Nothing ideological, just a dietary preference for us.

&gt;me and bf try to talk about what we need

&gt;Hamthrax is not excited about being ignored, keeps shouting over us, deriding my suggestions for food

&gt;I want to get quinoa. Hamthrax is puzzled by this food name, as she racks her fat encrusted brain trying to remember if its cake

&gt;head around WFs, all the while Buns n' Roses moans about the ""hipsterness"" of the staff and the products, in the faces of terrified stockboys as she rumbles past

&gt;loading every carbohydrate into her cart

&gt;I grab the quinoa 

&gt;Leg of Lamb of God is immediately upset that this is not cream-filled delicacy of her thoughts

&gt;tells me that real woman need fats to help make us more fertile

&gt;ughtechinicallytruebutfuckthisbitch.avi

&gt;BF says as a joke ""we don't need to worry about that""

&gt;Panpizzatera takes this as a cue to talk about all the boys that want in on her jiggles

&gt;apparently there are many who want to fuck those fat folds. yup.

&gt;we continue walking, her feet shuffling as her cart starts to become a carb mountain

&gt;we come up to the meat/cheese section, bf gets a small pack of brie, Hamthrax dumps several blocks of chedder into her cart

&gt;Hamthrax bellows in a prehistory mammoth cry and grabs us, enveloping our wrists in her fists of fat

&gt;pulls us to meat counter

&gt;tells/flirts deli counter guy that we are vegies and second class citizens. ""tell these guys that *you need meat*""

&gt;man looks like he'd rather swallow bleach than keep making eye contact with her moonface

&gt;shrugs and asks her what she wants

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/4vf9t5v.gif) she orders 3 roasted chicken

&gt;Squishknot lives alone, we can guess whose convex sinkhole will be those chickens' resting place

&gt;""Chicken is really good for you""

&gt;I have never felt more sorry for the dead carcass of an animal 

&gt;ask boyfriend if he wants salmon

&gt;Marilyn Munchkin interjects that fish are gross and unhealthy

&gt;ughwut.flac

&gt;buy salmon, and make our way to check out. 

&gt;Hamthrax is knocking over shit

&gt;you know how in WFs theres a refrigerator full of prepared sandwiches, dishes, and desserts?

&gt;Well Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Gastric Band sees the carrot cake, which is cut into chunks and in tubs

&gt;says maybe she will treat herself

&gt;one tin of that can fill two people with a decent amount of carrot cake

&gt;loads in four tins into her cart

&gt;we get in line, the dividers stretch to accomodate this luscious woman

&gt;Fatty Osbourne starts point out the ""unrealistic body image"" perpetrated by SHAPE magazine

&gt;it's all photoshopped, don't we know, they could make System of a Mound look that way if they wanted

&gt;mysides.jpeg

&gt;boyfriend looks as if his face might implode from not laughing

&gt;he tells me I would look good in the bikini on the cover of another magazine, suggests we go swimsuit shopping for summer

&gt;glances over at Hamthrax's puffy, pissed face

&gt;Cream Theater interjects ""Really? SHE'S SO FLAT THOUGH. That kind of suit needs curves"" 

Once again, I have those, but keep silent. Sorry this is so long, almost done. Stay tuned for Hamthrax's BBQ party we are forced to attend, will write it up later today or tomorrow. 

&gt;get to checkout, it takes her cashier 10 minutes to ring up all food.

&gt;bill must be monstrous, just like her

&gt;Queen of the 30 Stone Age huffs over with about 10 bags, her fists gripping the handles so hard moisture is leaking out of them

&gt;asks BF if he can take ""a couple""

&gt;BF and I are too beta to say no, since we have 2 bags in total

&gt;he takes 6, 3 in each hand

&gt;lookofpain.jpeg

&gt;thankfully only a couple steps to train

&gt;she's going opposite direction, different side of platform

&gt;We drop the bags on the floor of the train terminal, and book it 

&gt;Hamthrax lashes out a mountainous arm and grabs BF by the shirt and pulls him into a hug

&gt;legitimately concerned she will try to eat him

&gt;i can see his life flashing before his eyes

&gt;Avenged Seven-Folds gives me a smug look

&gt;bf grabs me by my existent waist and I put my head on his shoulder

&gt;we walk down to the station

&gt;can see landplanet on the other side, struggling with purchase

&gt;tries to wave to us, we pretend to not notice

&gt;last thing we see as we get on our train is several people next to her looking on in horror as they realize this drifting continent will be on the same train as them

1370347855.0	1fnaoq	The Joys of Being a Taxi Driver 2	d4w50n	1201	177	94	"Yeah, so I'm not going to greentext this one, and will try to keep it as brief as possible.

As mentioned in my last post, I am a taxi driver in the UK, in a pretty small town.

So anyway, it's 2AM, and I get a job from a house on the main road through town, it's travelling to the next town over. No big deal. So I pull up outside this house, and a fairly large female come out the house, gets into my car. Not full hamplanet size, but definitely above the 250lbs mark at about 5'8"".

As I drive, she seems pretty pleasant, jovial conversations abound.

She happens to mention she is single, and has problems meeting the ""right guy"". So I ask her, what is the right guy for you. She tells me it's someone who can see past her size, she knows she's overweight, but makes up for it with a personality that is larger than life.

So I ask, ""so the guys you've been dealing with have generally been quite shallow?""

""yeah"" she replies, ""I'm starting to think all men are obsessed with appearances!""

The conversation goes on about her failed love life, and she asks if I know any guys that are single and nice. I wonder if it's time to rustle some jimmies, so I mention, yeah I know this one guy, he's lovely. She asks me to describe him.

""He's really fun, he's into his music, plays guitar, life of the party""

""No no no"" she stops me ""what does he look like?""

""What does that matter?"" I ask

""Well, I want to at least be attracted to someone if I get involved with them""

""Well,"" I say ""he's about 6 foot, 300lbs, short hair, clean shaven""

""No, that's too big for me""

""What?!"" I exclaim

""300lbs is too big for me, I won't find that attractive""

I'm now pretty stunned by her hypocrisy ""could you not see past his weight, and get to know him for his personality?""

She comes back with ""No, I shouldn't have to settle for an unattractive guy just because I'm a bit big""

So I ask ""so what's your perfect guy look like then?""

""Oh you know (tee hee) slender, maybe a bit muscley on the shoulders, short hair, bit of stubble""

I ask ""so you won't settle for a bigger guy even if he has a good personality, but you expect guys who are in shape to settle for a bigger woman because she has a good personality?"" (this response was inspired by a FPS I read a while back)

She says ""no, it's different for women than it is for men""

I say ""no it's not, it should be a level playing field""

""No, men have the advantage all over the world, but women are just objectified based on their appearances""

""The same way your ""perfect man"" has to fit into your idea of what he should look like?""

She had no response.

Later in the ride, she told me her weight was a mystery, and it's not her fault she's bigger, which is why people should see past her weight.

1375891740.0	1jw2io	Hamplanets On A Plane	ScramblesTD	1303	282	263	"Long time lurker first time poster, but god damn if I didn't have my first FPS worthy of this board a few days ago.


I had recently returned home to the US after being away on business, and my trip included a connecting flight from LA to Miami. The initial flight was wholly unremarkable aside from the excellent service from ANA. (Like srsly if you need to go to Japan, they're the ones to take you) It was the flight home that was equal parts hysterical and horrifying. 

I got lucky and scored myself a window seat as well scoring myself some friendly traveling companions in the form of a dude in his late teens, seated next to me and a talkative gentlemen across the isle who's only distinguishing characteristic was that he was wearing a Calgary Flames hat. They shall be known as BlackBro and CalgaryBro, or BB and CB. Suddenly the windows on the plane darken, small children begin to cry and I'm sure the pilot's altimeter dropped a few feet as lo and behold Jabba the fuckin' Hutt and that little rat alien boarded the plane. Jabba stood around 6'  and she must have weighed, easily, 500-600lbs, and the smaller - I use that term lightly - creature looked no older than 10 but was nearly as big around has her mother's massive legs. Not to pick on a child like a jackass, but this kid was basically the brat you see in movies involving plane flights. In the event of a crash she could have been a flotation device for all I cared, but this is Fat People Stories, not Obnoxious Kid Stories, so that's a tale for another day. 

Anyways, Jabba lumbered over to the seats directly in front of us which nearly buckled under its massive girth. Acknowledging that the seats, or perhaps the landing gear, wasn't in *nearly* enough pain for her liking, Jabba requested beer and snacks. She was politely informed by the stewardess that perhaps it would be best if she waited until the plane were airborne before ordering any drinks. Jabba grew frustrated and almost summed up enough energy to fully get up from her seat and **demanded** that she be fed and consume drinks due to her beetus. As someone with type 2 diabetes as well as basic common sense, I can confirm that alcohol is probably not the greatest choice when you're worried about things like blood sugar. Regardless Jabba gets what Jabba wants, be it Han Solo or Heineken. As we waited to take off, Jabba and Jabba Jr became more and more assertive and straight up fucking rude to the girl serving them. During one of Jabba's rants, CB makes a comment along the lines of getting on another plane if the service on this one wasn't up to the Enormous One's standards. Jabba, quick to anger, rose from the carcass of what used to be a proper chair and stepped into the isle; pushing away the stewardess with a sweep of her flabby arm to berate CB for not respecting her disability.  He actually called her The Enormous One, that wasn't any poetic embellishment on my part. The stewardess lightly touches Jabba's arm and instructs her to remain seated and asks CB to not further antagonize her. Jabba flies into a fury of rage shouting ""Don't you lay a fucking hand on me you dirty bitch"" or something to that effect. It's worth mentioning at this point the stewardess in question was black, and BB was visbly irked by the implications of the comment. At this point the pilots announce that we will begin takeoff shortly and the stewardesses began going through the motions of instructing people how to properly put on the seatbelts. 

Well fatty fatty boombalatty is having a difficult time, as her belt requires an extension. Unfortunately Jabba's large spherical midsection and stubby arm-flabs mean that putting the extension in place is...difficult to say the least. Additionally, her spawn required assistance from the beast to put on her own normal people sized belt. Which was nearly to small. Eventually Jabba was the only person to my knowledge in our section who wasn't safely secured by her belt. The stewardess attempts to help, and just her reaching for the belt sent Jabba flying off the handle. She roared with the voices of legion and jumped to her feet with surprising and terrifying agility swatting the poor girl in the face with one arm and grabbing her with the other. Her watch nicked the stewardess in the face and caused a pretty gnarly nose bleed. CB stands and demands, with a surprising amount of calm authority that Jabba let the girl go. Jabba responds by dropping the n-bomb and delivering another blow. At this point people began to stand up, and a few men further up were getting ready to come back here and put a whooping on Jabba. It should be noted that the smaller beast was clapping and cheering during all of this. Just as BB and I begin to stand, CB jumps up and grabs Jabba by the throat while working his way behind her, attempting to pulling her backwards. Jabba backpeddles into a seat, catching CBs hip on painfully on the plastic arm rest. BB stands up and, I shit you not, nails Jabba in the side of the head with his closed laptop. I start to work my way around BB and just as this looks like it's about to turn into a full on riot, CB produces a collapsible baton. Jabba immediately drops the girl who is attended to by her coworkers, as CB ties her wrists with one of those plastic zip ties. ""United States Air Marshal"" he shouts. LAPD and what looked like airport security boarded the plane a few minutes later and removed Jabba and her inconsolable offspring. It took 4 grown men a backbreaking amount of work to get her off the flight. I imagine assault and battery charges were filled, and BB and I both speculated that there was enough evidence for it to probably be considered a hate crime as well. 


I don't understand the logic behind behaving this way, hamplanet logic or not. Nobody walked away from this any better, CB left the flight and probably had to do an ungodly amount of followup work, a girl just trying to do her job got attacked, and our flight got delayed, *again*. "	t5_2vzax	True

I'm 21 y/o chick, not fit by any means, 5'6 140lbs, working my way down. Boyfriend is from Belgium, 25, works in IT. He's 5'10 and super thin due to being a nerd all the time. I love him anyways. So he tells me that theres a hamplanet at his job who's really into metal music, referred to henceforth as  Hamthrax. Hamthrax has a really hard time keeping away from my bf, apparently very into his accent. Boy is like meatwagon bait for some reason. Greentext activated.


&gt;Over break (estoy college student)start interning at a firm really near BF's place of work

&gt;Move shit around in my schedule to go over and have lunch with him, good girlfriend style

&gt;BF really excited to show me the majesty that is Hamthrax

&gt;Sit down with him in large cafeteria on the main floor of the office building. By large, i mean enough walking room between tables.

&gt;could probably ride a horse through some of those gaps

&gt;Eating with BF(we're both ~~vegetarians~~ pescetarians) when suddenly there is a terrifying rumble

&gt;earth shakes

&gt;birds fly from trees

&gt;dark clouds approach

&gt;A mountain of flesh starts charging at us

&gt;boyfriend has unconventional name (kind of)

&gt;spelled Jan, but pronounced ""Yan""

&gt;Hamthrax emits loud shriek and mewls ""Jaaaaaaaaaan"" like brady bunch Jan

&gt;Nearly explode with laughter

&gt;wobbles towards us, pushing tables aside with her enormous mountain sized fat rolls

&gt;greasy black hair, cake layered make up, wearing all black dresspants and giant blouse that looks like she robbed a sailboat mast.

&gt;i'd guess 5'4, 350-400 lbs 

&gt;monstrous.jpeg

At this point, my boyfriend introduces me to Hamthrax. Boyfriend explains I am uni student, and working around here. Instahate in Megagirth's eyes, ignores me even though I offer her a hand. She plops down onto the seat to the side of us and throws what I assume is the worlds largest deli sandwich on the table. Neither of us had invited her to sit with us but looks like she took it upon her massive self to join us.

&gt;Hamthrax unwraps sandwich to reveal the destruction of an entire deli counter

&gt;more meat and cheese then I've ever seen between two pieces of bread

&gt;mayonaise dripping from the edges, not a vegetable in sight

&gt;jesustakethewheel.exe

&gt;Cream Theater immediately crams it into her mouth and starts talking with her mouth full and her chins quaking.

&gt;tells us she had to take out all her piercings for work *again* (works as a receptionist)

&gt;keeps talking about death metal concert coming up

&gt;eyes my salad with disgust

&gt;asks me what music i'm into

&gt;barely have time to utter ""mostly rock and some indie and trance""

&gt;Meatallica cuts me off and starts berating me , explaining my poor choice in music to me

&gt;bf is huge trance fan, starts to come to the rescue

&gt;Hamthrax immediately back tracks 

&gt;""Lol well trance is pretty good JAN""

&gt;isthisthereallife.gif

&gt;mayonaise and cheese rolling off her face and onto the table

&gt;close my tupper ware with my salad, feeling nauseated

&gt;Hamthrax, guzzling liter coke, zeros in on my food

&gt;""is that all you gonna eat""

&gt;tell her I feel full

&gt;""Omg JAN your girlfriends such a anorexic how can she satisfy you. Watch out roomsgotrooms or he might just upgrade *teehee*""

&gt;mfw uncomfortable glances

&gt;continues to talk about ""MUH CURVES"" and about how you NEED to eat meat or you're not healthy.

&gt;spend next twenty minutes listening to diatribes of Slayer Cake while she flirts with BF

&gt;BF's eyes have become glazed over in boredom

&gt;I become worried Hamthrax might think they're doughnuts and chow down

Eventually the nightmare ended, and we got up (she flailed around and crashed into shit) and made to leave, but not before she gave him a long hug, crushing the life force from his frail bones. She smirks and waves bye to me, winking at BF. Many stories following!

&gt;Be me, trumpet player in college marching band.


&gt;Know TubaGirl. Not anywhere near fat, not super thin either. I'd guess 5'5 and 140 pounds mostly muscle from sports and shit.


&gt;Props given cause tuba is heavy as shit.


Our story begins in March after marching band season is over


&gt; See TubaGirl around campus.


&gt;Lost quite a bit of weight, looking pale, sickly with dark circles under her eyes.


&gt;feelsbad.man


&gt; never really does anything about it. Part ways with TubaGirl and return to my native homeland of New York.


&gt;Journey back to college for Band Camp week in the middle of summer. 


&gt;Dat week is mandatory for basically everyone who doesn't require a plane ride to make it back to campus.



&gt;See TubaGirl. She lost a significant amount of weight. Now about 5'5 and 110 pounds.


&gt;Looks not sick though. Tell her how much healthier she looks.


&gt;Turns out she had Celiac Disease and gluten was making her sick. No gluten = no sickness.


&gt; Enter FlagHam. 5'2 and 350 pounds. All concentrated on her hips and ass. Practically a shelf. Would be ok, if she wasn't a total bitch. Thinks shes hot and in shape because she's on colorgaurd.


&gt;no girl no.


&gt; Sits with us at lunch. Total Beta, don't tell her to go away.


&gt;TubaGirl gets gluten-free pizza made special by the cafeteria workers.


&gt;FlagHam comments on the pizza looks gross and not like pizza.


&gt;Duh. It's made from rice. 


&gt;FlagHam is clearly not pleased.


&gt;Carry on with Lunch as usual.


&gt; On the way out, FlagHam stops me, giggling like a idiot and says ""I put a bunch of my sandwich crumbs on her pizza. A little bit of real food will be good for her. Celiac isn't a real thing.""


&gt;face meet palm.


&gt;TubaGirl gets sick from FlagHam's ""help"". Goes home early.


TL;DR: Band girl gets sick from eating gluten, and colorgaurd fatty hides wheat in her food because she doesn't believe Celiac Disease is a real thing.

EDIT: TubaGirl is not filing criminal charges atm, but decided to bring it to the University Judicial Court, meaning she'll face charges within the university. FlagHam's court date is set for this Wednesday and I'll let you know what happens."	t5_2vzax	True

1369508480.0	1f1iqj	Beating a Hammie at Her Own Game.	12DancingPrincesses	1211	211	121	"A few years I took a temporary job in a Call Center. I had just gotten divorced, was deeply in debt because of it and desperately needed to save up enough money to move far, far away from my idiot ex-husband.


I lived in California at the time and understood why they called it the land of the beautiful people... until I got to the Call Center. Apparently that was where all the obese Cali people were hiding.


Out of our team of 9 people I was the only one in shape. The others were all Large and In Charge, with the exception of Hammie. 


I say Large and In Charge because although they were over-weight none of them really had what I would call fat-logic. 2 of them hiked together on weekends, then went to a Chinese Buffet.


They knew they were fat but didn't care, didn't expect special treatment, or consider themselves victims. Their fatness was all their own fault. They even made jokes about.


""An hour on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.""


""Hour?! Dude, I saw you eat a meatball footlong in 4 minutes.""


Again, with the exception of Hammie.


Hammie stole other peoples lunches and, when called on it by Management, would throw tantrums about fat discrimination and threaten to sue, or file sexual harassment claims against the person who complained. (Hammie and I were the only females in our team.)


My new co-workers warned me about this my very first day.


It wasn't that I didn't believe them, I just didn't think that someone of that nature would be interested in my dressing free salad, orange slices and mayo-less tuna sandwich. (Dem dairy allergies /cry)


I was wrong.


I hadn't even worked there a full day before Hammie ate my lunch and, when confronted with it had the nerve to imply it was my fault for having a similar lunch container to hers. (mine was purple, hers was blue)



I requested compensation so that I could purchase another lunch.
Hammie, who had commented earlier how unlucky I was to have food allergies and knew full well I can't eat dairy, offered me a slice of her cheese pizza to compensate for having eaten my lunch.


I declined and again requested compensation only to be told that she had given me a solution and it was my own fault for not accepting it.


This did not sit well with me so I went to HR and requested assistance in resolving this issue.


Hammie was called in and I explained, again, very clearly, about my allergies and the fact that I was several thousand dollars in debt. I could not afford another lunch that day, nor could I afford to have this happen again.


Hammie had eaten my allergen free lunch, therefore it was on her to replace it with something I could eat.


Hammie refused and HR, who I learned from this incident was the wimpiest most useless waste of oxygen in the world, offered me a $10 voucher to get something from the company cafeteria.


I accepted, thanked him but insisted that did not resolve the issue of Hammie never doing this again. She had stolen from me. What she did was theft and I saw no reason why she should be left unpunished.


Hammie exploded. Tears, accusing me of fat hate and faking my allergies. It was a mistake. She shouldn't have to pay for a mistake.


HR asked me to drop it and just let it go.


I refused. Told him Hammie was no better than a High School Bully who had stolen my lunch money and I am too old to put up with that sort of behavior.


Hammie continued to yell. Threatened to sue the company for discrimination against fat people if she was punished. Would take to Facebook and Twitter (it was the pre-Tumblr days) and drum up a social media backlash. 


I told her she was welcome to and if she did, I would sue her personally for discrimination against an immigrant.


I then took my green card out of my wallet and calmly laid it on the table in front of her, looked her dead in her beady little eyes and asked.


""Did you assume I was American simply because I'm fair skinned? That is a little racist, don't you think? Who do you suppose is going to look worse in the court of public opinion? A thin, poor, struggling immigrant with food allergies who is doing her best to dig herself out from a pile of debt or a fat, racist, discriminatory bully?""


Californians just love to get behind the cause of a minority being victimized.


Hammie was silent as she realised she had no recourse. Prop 8 was big in the news right at that moment so she couldn't even pull her usual sexual harassment bullshit. If she did she'd be cast as the wicked Hetero trying to set up a hard working bi-sexual who just wanted to be left alone.


HR, that useless idiot, asked me what I wanted done. I told him I wanted him to do his job and, according to the employee handbook I had just read, all incidences of theft would result in instant termination unless she wanted to repay me for my lunch, at which point I would consider the matter a loan rather than a theft.


Hammie pulled a slightly damp and musky smelling $10 from her pants pocket (ew!) and gave it to me.


I thanked her and left the office.


I'd like to say she never stole another persons lunch but I'd be lying if I did. She never stole MY lunch again, however and I quit to move to the East Coast 6 months later and never saw her again. 


TL:DR: When it comes to being a victimized minority in California being an Immigrant beats being Fat."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Keeps inhaling

&gt;Holy shit is she ordering in the form of an operetta?

&gt;Orders Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo with ""EXTRA SAUCE I WANT IT CREAMY. IF THERE ISNT EXTRA SAUCE I *WILL* SEND IT BACK"" 

Other two order pasta dishes, non eventful. They order salad, but with ranch with EXTRA ranch AND extra ranch on the side. Tell them will be back, turn to kitchen-

&gt;""Server!!"" 

&gt;Remind Gigante that my name is blackshirt.

&gt;She scowls. ""Breadsticks. A LOT.""

I finally get to the kitchen to put in their order, hitting the extra button on the computer about 6 times on the alfredo, and once each on the other two dishes for good sport. Go to the back to make salad, dump on as much ranch as possible and bring three sides of it as well. Internally laughing at the policy on bread, I load up a basket with about 9 pieces. 

&gt;be bread basket

&gt;be excited for important job of carrying bread

&gt;See table

&gt;Oh god no

&gt;This is it

&gt;Hands, hands just everywhere. From ever angle I am violated again and again.

The bread is divvied up before I even get the salad down, literally, each of them have snatched a few for themselves and Gigante #2 sets the basket on my tray. 

&gt;""We said A LOT""

&gt;Solemnnod.exe

&gt;I retrieve 9 more breadsticks. Go check on other tables. Lady left me $10 on a $15 dollar tab fuck yeah

&gt;Set breadsticks down

&gt;All bread is gone, repeat of last scene. Gigante #2 wordlessly hands me basket with a fierce look.

I run to the back to grab more, but get distracted for 4-5 minutes running food out for another table. Luckily, when I return to the kitchen, theres more bread. Grab 9 more pieces and head out.

&gt;Gigantes all look angry. Gigante 1 begins her inhalation process as I draw closer.

&gt;""WE HAVE BEEN OUT OF SALAD AND BREAD FOR TEN MINUTES NOW, OUR DRINKS ARE GONE AND WE ALL SUFFER FROM LOW BLOOD SUGAR, IF I DONT GET FOOD IN ME MY BEETUS IS GOING TO FLARE UP AND HER THYROID AND MY HYPOGLYSEEMIA AND YOU HAD BETTER NOT LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN""

&gt; Desperately trying to clear old dishes away, quickly reassuring beasts of my imminent return with more salad and another round or frozen sugar alcohol concoctions and three more cokes.

&gt;Return with more drinks, another ranch with a side of lettuce, and 6 more breadsticks this time. 

&gt;Mistake that will come back to haunt me.

&gt;Check on other tables apologize for wait, fuck yeah, ten more dollars

&gt;Gigantes food is ready!

Oh sweet jesus I must have pissed off the line with all the [EXTRA]s I hit. There must have been a full 4 cups of sauce on this womans pasta. It was like a soup. I almost considered it an insult to take this out to anyone. Still, I loaded up the tray and began to walk out to their table.

&gt;This is where shit gets real.

&gt;Hear loud, obnoxious smacking sound.

&gt;OH you have to be joking

&gt;Gigante #1 is holding the empty breadstick basket, staring at me, and SMACKING IT AGAINST THE TABLE REPEATEDLY. She does not stop this until I arrive at the table. Smack Smack Smack Smack Smack Smack Smack Smack.

&gt;Look at table, salad is empty all cokes are gone. 

&gt;I'm fucked

&gt;Set down food, Gigante #2 Wants to see a manager ""But bring us some bread FIRST. NOW.""

&gt;Go to front, explain to manager, probably 5 minutes later we arrive at table with bread.

All of their food is gone. Gone. Entire dinner portions of food, probably 2000 calorie entrees, just wiped from existence. They begin to complain between mouthfulls of bread how inattentive I was, how they had to beg for refills, how they sat hungry the majority of the time and how

&gt;wait for it

There wasnt enough sauce on the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.

&gt;thiscantbehappening

I told manager I had delivered no less than 30 breadsticks, literally. How much sauce there had been. How I had done refills. Didn't matter, manager comped their whole meal and apologized for the ""standard of service"". Also got free tiramsu.

&gt;Pick up jimmies from general vicinity, seethe until I get home to my beloved FPS.

&gt;A little chubby, still working off the pounds, but making good progress

&gt;Go to deli as special treat on the weekend, since I usually pack lunch to bring to work

&gt;datsoup.mpeg

&gt;Deli serves free ice cream, soft serve machine right next to soda machine with tiny cones and plastic bowls that hold about 3 ounces

&gt;Decide to have tiny 3 ounce bowl of ice cream since I haven't had it in many weeks

&gt;Approach ice cream machine

&gt;Tell me your secrets, oh frosty one, and I shall make sweet, sweet love to you

&gt;Woman and little boy come up right as I do; woman insists I go ahead and tells her son that it's nice to let others go ahead of you

&gt;Suddenly child goes quiet and hides behind his mother

&gt;Realize that there is an enormous hambeast next to me

&gt;Not really hammy; greasy sheen, terrible odor, stringy hair

&gt;More of a cheesebeast

&gt;Mental note: plan funeral ceremony for ears; they have to be dead if I couldn't hear her approaching

&gt;Might have to make it a triple funeral for ears and nose, she stinks like a litter box full of cottage cheese

&gt;Same height as me, but I'm sure I could fit into one of the legs of her greasy, stretchy pants

&gt;The cheesebeast opens its food hole, makes a slapping sound

&gt;Realize that the slapping sound is her chins and wattle smacking together, she's actually saying ""Scuze me!"" 

&gt;Because cheesebeast is holding a soda cup, I assume she is requesting access to the 'beetus juice machine; I move aside to let her through

&gt;Lolnope

&gt;She takes my moving aside as permission to cut in line at the ice cream machine

&gt;Oh sweet Jesus no

&gt;Places 32 ounce soda cup under ice cream spigot

&gt;Woman, child and I stare at her in shock

&gt;Cheesebeast doesn't notice, keeps pouring ice cream into cup, wheezing because the thought of an enormous cup of ice cream probably arouses her

&gt;Finally soda cup is filled to the brim with soft serve ice cream

&gt;Cheesebeast looks at us, we hurriedly try to pick our jaws up off the floor

&gt;""They don't make milkshakes here, so I guess this will just have to do!""

&gt;Was fully expecting a teehee after this, but instead got a horrible gurgling sound, like she had just thrown up in her mouth

&gt;Cheesebeast waddles away, to add insult to injury, we all get to see that her pants are wedged deep into her huge ass

&gt;We have no faces

&gt;Finally place my tiny cup under spigot

&gt;Machine groans and creaks, but no ice cream comes out

&gt;He's dead, Jim

&gt;Woman sighs and says, ""It's gone, isn't it?"" 

&gt;I nod. ""Sorry, I think she took it all."" 

&gt;Doesn't matter, lost my appetite for ice cream when I heard that gurgle, but feel bad for the child

&gt;Walking back to my table when I hear him utter the most heartbreaking statement imaginable:

In which you learn about Maggie's patriotism.

My friends and I wanted to throw a nice, big barbecue since we had more money than ever, a dope backyard, and a literal cash cow parked in our living room. Unfortunately, due to a family crisis of Sasha's, we had to push our Fourth of July party to the the fourth of August, but that way more people were free, anyhow. We let Maggie know as soon as we started planning, and told her to invite her friends. The actual quote was ""I don't really celebrate bougie holidays like that; I've got *too much to do*."" Hilarious. So we asked her if she wanted to chip in for the barbecue, and it was like we had said the magic word. Me and John left for the store with about 200 extra bucks to spend on food. To all of you who've been wondering, yeah this is why we kept her around.

We bought more food than any sane person should. But we knew we had to clog Maggie's mouth hole to have any left for ourselves. We stocked up on sausage, burgers, ribs, veggies, various buns, snacks on snacks on snacks, and tons, tons of booze. A couple of my coworkers, and my boss from my bar/restaurant were coming and bringing shitty beer for the masses. But me and John weren't taking any chances. Our last stop was a giant, supermarket layer cake, with some thematic icing. We were waiting to check out, and John suddenly yelled ""WAIT!"" and ran back into the store. He came back with a smaller cake, with the same icing. I nearly died laughing when he ran up screaming ""DECOY CAKE"". We dropped off the real cake at a friends who was going to come over later in the party.

We had invited about 20, 30 people, and most of them said they would come. Sasha had spent the next day cleaning the house, and wiping down yard furniture while me, John, and Andy prepped food. Maggie spent the ~~morning~~ afternoon watching Doctor Who and making comments about how we were all people pleasers. For having a party. We were all just fooling around, and playing our ""White Girl Wasted"" playlist (sorrynotsorry) around the house. This did not please the most high Maggie. The highlight of that playlist was John's emphatic and soulful  sing along performance of [Birthday Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y34jC4I1m70).  It's accompanied by a lot of stupid dancing and general shenanigans. The best line in this song is arguably ""Bad bitch contest, you in first place"". John shimmed over to Maggie and dedicated those lines to her. Maggie got so mad that she actually left the room, and came back with her speakers. She proceeded to blast ""Rubber Soul"". We just stared at her. Immediate wet blanket, could not take a joke if it was covered in frosting. She tromped back into her room after a minute of glaring. The White Girl Wasted playlist was resumed. 

When people started arriving, we started grilling. We were playing chill music in the backyard, and Maggie didn't want to come out of her room. Until she smelled the food. Then she was full steam ahead. No one dressed up super fancy, but most people were in some form of summer clothing. We had a crappy inflatable kiddie pool and a slip'n'slide, so a bunch of people were in bathing suits, not everyone though. When the smells of food starting wafting, Maggie came out. She was in shorts. This was the first time I'd ever seen her thighs. Cottage cheese could not even describe it. She was still wearing her giant t-shirts, so it wasn't *awful*. I don't think anyone else made comments or anything. But she stalked around the party, glaring at all of our friends. We couldn't even introduce her to anyone, because she had an awful bitch face on for the entire day. 

When the food was ready, she was first in line. Kept telling people HER money payed for all the food. She preceded to eat almost all of it. She had three burgers, five sausages, a rack of ribs, three cobs of corn drenched in butter, and a bag and a half of potato chips. She was concentrating on drinking as much beer as humanly possible. I don't think anyone was counting, but my boss came up to me and said ""If she wasn't a … *big girl*, I'd be trying to get her to the ER"". The party carried on, there was plenty of alcohol. I wasn't too sober myself, so I stumbled into the kitchen for a glass of water to find a crying, cake smeared Maggie, the empty tin of Decoy Cake, and a red faced, cake smeared John. Maggie threw the tin at me, screaming ""YOU BITCH"" and ran into her room. 

What. I helped John wipe the cake off his face and shirt and he told me that he'd come into the kitchen to find Maggie taking the Decoy bait, face first. He wasn't sober, and started laughing really hard that his prediction came true. She got offended and started screaming at John, calling him a fat shamer. John tried to play it off, telling her he was laughing because there was cake on her nose. Maggie was pretty well stocked on liquid courage, and said something like ""well, you can come clean it off."" John immediately said no, no thank you, I don't want any cake. Her response was to run at him and smash her face into his. She attempted to kiss him, as he tried to shove her away. He finally got her away with a good push, and she started crying about how she thought they were meant for each other, because he was always ""being mean and flirty to her"". John looked shocked and told her he liked someone else, not her, never her. Like a mature, 21 year old well-read rhinoceros, she charged at him, throwing punches while simultaneously eating cake. John couldn't defend himself too well because his sides were aching with laughter. 

After he finished telling me the story, I lay slumped against his chest, laughing so hard my eye sight was starting to blur. I sounded like I was choking on air, it was the funniest thing I had ever heard. John tried had to hold me up, but we were laughing so hard,we kind of collapsed onto the kitchen floor. Our late-coming, cake bearing friend opened the door around that time, screaming ""The CAKE IS HERE"". Maggie was out of her room in a flash, momentarily fine at the mention of more dessert. This made me and John laugh harder than ever, and she saw us, tangled on the kitchen floor, in drunk laughter tears. She tried to make a grab for the cake, but somehow missed as the 6 foot firefighter who was holding it ducked out of her way. She then ran back to her room after calling me a skinny slut. 

The rest of the party was so much fun, especially because we all had a nice piece of cake, and plenty of food left. Maggie didn't come out of her room for an entire day afterwards (and missed clean-up, oh wow good job). She then pretended she blacked out that night, which would have been plausible if she didn't turn bright red when John walked into the room. It was even more obvious when he sat on the armrest of my chair, and she threw her empty plate into the sink, and left the room.

FPS, you complete me.

I didn't think I would write another part tonight, but after the first two parts seemed to get rave reviews by the FPS Community, I figured one more part would be great for jimmies getting maximum rustling tonight!

When we last picked up our story, we got the first real glimpse of Daisy's lack of cleanliness and proof that a valley girl comes from the same type of attitude (as well as cluelessness).

About three weeks passed and there weren't many incidents.  Alicia and I were locked into summer classes and working.  Outside of an occasional hour here or there, we would see Alex.  He was around more on the weekends, but he was taking two classes during summer (Thankfully for him, one class was on Monday and Wednesday, the other was Tuesday and Thursday, giving him Friday-Sunday away from classes) and still working two part time jobs.  I honestly don't know how he did it, and he managed to spend time with us when he could.  The good thing, though, was that the summer session was almost over and we had a nice break until Fall session began.

Daisy, however, had nothing to do.  Valley Mom and her poor Father were basically paying for everything.  She would sleep until Noon and usually got up when Alex did to attempt poor mating calls to Alex, who brushed them off very well.  After Alex left for class, she usually went to the kitchen and gorged herself before parking herself in the living room and using the awesome setup we had for her own amusement.  Alicia and I didn't say anything about it because we were too busy studying, but when classes were over, we were going to want to use it too.  Finals week was now upon us and the Sunday after, Alex decided to take everyone out for dinner for the first real roommate dinner.

&gt;Me, finally rested from finals

&gt;Did pretty well.  A and B in my classes.  Happy!

&gt;Alex got two As.  The guy is a machine.  Has to be.

&gt;Alicia got two As.  Not as surprising.

&gt;Daisy...well, Daisy got Stouffers.

&gt;Dressed up for awesome night out.

&gt;Alex said to.  Love dressing up!

&gt;Choose black one piece.  Showing off dem sexy curves!

&gt;Alicia chooses similar outfit.  Also a sexy bitch!

&gt;Both come downstairs together

Alex gave a hearty whistle and growl when he saw us.  He opted for a dark blue dress shirt and black pants.  He was attractive, there was no denying.  I wondered how he didn't have a girlfriend, but then remembered his schedule.  I don't know if any girl could handle that.

&gt;Three of us ready

&gt;Hear rumbling from far away

&gt;Well, not so far away.

&gt;Jurassic Park ain't got nothing on this

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/5544-you-have-to-spoon-me-first) Daisy comes into view

Daisy's idea of getting dressed up was to throw this obnoxiously loud flowered shirt on that showed a disgusting amount of fat cleavage and black stretch pants.  Alex coughed to stifle what he saw and turned away.

&gt;that which has been seen....

&gt;Bellowing commences

&gt;""ALLLLEEEXXXXX DAMN YOU LOOK HOT!""

&gt;charging like a rhino

&gt;Alex puts his hand up

&gt;rhino can't stop momentum

&gt;Manages to slow down and just flail a hug at him

&gt;""Daisy, thanks...but you don't have to hug me every time you see me.  We're roomies, not dating.""

&gt;Hooooo boy.

&gt;Blubbering starts to commence.

&gt;""BUT YOU ARE SO NICE TO ME!! I THINK YOU ARE JUST PLAYING HARD TO GET!!""

&gt;gag.gif

&gt;No way Alex would do that.

&gt;""Daisy, let's just go.  I'm sure Alex doesn't want us to be late for dinner.""

&gt;Alicia showing initiative and awesomeness

&gt;I agree quickly.

&gt;Alex nods quickly.

&gt;Blubbering avoided.

Alex had followed through with buying his new car, getting a two year old Ford Fusion.  Nothing flashy, but he got a great deal on it.  He had made sure, very politely, that the car was his baby.  He had traded in an old Civic that still looked pretty good, even though it was like seven years old.  He loved his car.

&gt;Called shotgun, bitches!

&gt;Blubbering starts yet again

&gt;""BUT I WANTED THE FRONT SEAT I WANTED TO SIT NEXT TO ALEX!!!""

&gt;sigh....

&gt;Alex chimes in before anything starts

&gt;""Shotgun rule, Daisy.  Call it when you see it.""

&gt;Awesome roomie is awesome

&gt;Alicia kinda upset, has to deal with blubbering in the back

&gt;""FINE! YOU'RE JUST LIKE JEALOUS OF ME AND ALEX ANYWAYS!""

&gt;...did you blackout about two minutes ago?

&gt;Never mind, fatlogic

&gt;Alex starts laughing in the front as we pull out.

&gt;Daisy oblivious to what's so funny.

I said in the last chapter that Alex spoiled us, even though he didn't have to.  With this being a bit of a special occasion with it being our first roommate dinner, he insisted that he cover it all because he knew Alicia and I were thin on money and figured he would be nice and invite Daisy as well, after all, I was convinced he didn't have a mean bone in his body.  He took us to this beautiful restaurant that was a rather fine dining fitted for seafood.  Fresh lobster, crab, shrimp, you name it.  Alicia and I had heard of it but couldn't afford it.  It was about 30 bucks a plate on average.  Alicia and I half-heartedly protested because we knew it was expensive.  Alex simply shook his head and said he insisted.  Daisy, of course, didn't care.

&gt;""OH MY GOD I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO EAT HERE!  LET'S GO!""

&gt;I do too...but have to at least be concerned for roomie paying for everything

&gt;Alicia happy as hell.  Bitch loves seafood.

&gt;I love seafood.

&gt;Protests subsided.

&gt;Alex looks glad everyone is happy

We walk in and it appears that Alex is friends with the hostess, offering a hug and introduces us to whom we will call Michelle, because she comes up later in the stories.  Michelle was much taller than Alicia and I, but was very nice.  Alex explained that he knew her from high school and they were good friends that had just lost touch a bit during college.  She shows us to our table.  At least, she showed three of us...

&gt;This place is soooo nice

&gt;Can't wait to taste the food

&gt;There's our table

&gt;Wait...

&gt;Where's Daisy

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/5436-loose-seal) I see her at the lobster tank

Daisy was putting her face against the lobster tank, literally pointing out that she was going to eat each lobster one by one.  People were already staring at her from her attire of choice, and now she was doing this.  Michelle does us the favor of going to get her and bringing her to the table while Alex just shakes his head.  Daisy eventually calms herself from her excitement and takes her seat at the table.  There was no way we were going to get a booth because Daisy simply couldn't fit with another person in it.

&gt;Looking at the menu

&gt;Place is expensive

&gt;Everything looks so good

&gt;Alicia's smile hasn't gone down

&gt;Best friend looks absolutely giddy

&gt;Daisy is...

&gt;Holy shit

&gt;Daisy looks like she's going to eat the menu

&gt;Alex glances at Daisy

&gt;Fear in his eye just a moment.

&gt;""Ladies, it's on me tonight, but I do ask that you don't go too nuts.  That's all.""

&gt;Thank you for being a bit Alpha, Alex

&gt;Worried Daisy didn't hear

&gt;Waiter shows up

It started innocent enough.  Drinks were ordered.  Alex opted for a cocktail while Alicia and I went with virgin daiquiris (I was three weeks away from 21.  Alicia was five weeks.  Daisy wouldn't be 21 until next year.) and Daisy ordered, and I quote, ""THE BIGGEST DIET COKE YOU CAN GIVE ME!""  The waiter wiped his face and walked away to get our drinks.  There wasn't much small talk yet because we were still looking at the menu.  When the drinks came back is when the problems really kicked up.

&gt;Can't wait to be 21

&gt;This thing is still damn tasty.

&gt;""Can I get anyone some appetizers?""

&gt;Wind picks up

&gt;Oh shit

&gt;""OH YES I WANT THIS AND THIS AND THAT!""

&gt;blank stare

&gt;Alex says nothing, figuring we can share

&gt;""Um, okay.  I'll get those in.  Is everyone ready to order their entree?""

Alicia and I both let our guilt wash away and ordered combo plates with different types.  It was like $40 and Alex didn't bat an eye.  He ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and scallops, which actually ended up being the cheapest entree ordered.  Daisy, however, kicked the tension up.  You see, this place was running a 3-course special that had a soup, choice of entree, and dessert.

&gt;Daisy looks possessed

&gt;At least she found something she liked

&gt;""CAN I LIKE GET TWO OF THESE?""

&gt;Waiter looks confused.

&gt;Alex looks worried.

&gt;""Ma'am, one is a three course dinner. You get one of each of those.""

&gt;Bellowing in 3, 2, 1...

&gt;""I'M A FULL FIGURED WOMAN WITH A THYROID CUNDISHUN! I NEED MORE THAN JUST THAT""

&gt;Look at menu

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;Each 3-course is $40

&gt;Alex cringes

The waiter looks at Alex, who has said it will be one check, for approval.  Alex lets out a pained sigh and just nods.  Waiter takes her order and disappears.  Because of this, small talk was absolutely nil.  Alex kicked up his drinking a bit and finished his first cocktail before appetizers even came.  Once those came, we realized that Daisy had no intention of sharing.  Alex showed his first sign of his incredibly long patience running thin.

&gt;""Daisy...appetizers are meant for all of us.""

&gt;LOLFATLOGIC

&gt;Silly Alex, you're just paying!

&gt;""I NEED ALL OF THESE TO TIDE ME OVER!  DON'T YOU TAKE ANY OF THEM!""

&gt;Holy shit, really?

&gt;Can see Alex's fist clench up by his leg

&gt;Reach over and pat on thigh

&gt;Alex calms down

&gt;Please don't snap

&gt;Death glare to Daisy as she destroys appetizers

Alicia chimes in with small talk about our classes to break the tension, thankfully.  Daisy doesn't even partake in the conversation, which was probably for the best.  Alex gets another cocktail but drinks a little slower.  I was actually a little worried at first because it was the first time I had seen him show signs of anger, but he recovered and enjoyed the conversation.  Daisy, meanwhile, destroys the appetizers and then starts in on her two first courses, which are both clam chowder.  The rest of us are enjoying some salad, which gets a look of disdain from our hamplanet, telling us ""SALAD IS SO BAD FOR YOU!""  Whatever.  Michelle swings by to see how things are going and looks absolutely horrified by Daisy's assault on the food.  Alex looks at her as if he is trying to tell her they can talk later and she seems to get the idea, quickly getting away.  Daisy decides she has to speak up.

&gt;""SHE IS SUCH A SCRAWNY GIRL, ALEX!  YOU NEED A REAL WOMAN!""

&gt;Oh no.

&gt;Bitch, you didn't.

&gt;Alex looks calm.

&gt;""Daisy, she is just my friend.  We've known each other for about six years.""

&gt;Daisy bellows

&gt;Cocktail sauce comes out of her mouth

&gt;fuckinggross.mp3

&gt;""WELL THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M ALL THE WOMAN YOU NEED!""

&gt;She doesn't get it, does she?

Alex let it go, thankfully, especially since the entrees finally came.  The food was amazing, as Alex said it would be.  You know how they say when there is good food, no one says a word?  It's true.  Daisy, however, made a complete fool out of the entire table with her next request.  You see, her entrees were basically two full lobsters, which is more than enough for one person.  They brought out the normal size little sides of butter.

&gt;Food looks incredible

&gt;Can't wait to dig in.

&gt;Hear bellowing building up

&gt;""I NEED MORE BUTTER!""

&gt;You have two cups...

&gt;Waiter already looks pained

&gt;""Well, I can bring you out a cup of...""

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;FATLOGIC KICKS IN

&gt;""I NEED MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE I HAVE TO KEEP MY FIGURE!  BRING ME A BOWL OF IT!""

&gt;........a bowl?

&gt;A bowl of butter?

&gt;""Ma'am....are you sure?""

&gt;""YES I'M SURE NOW LIKE GET BACK THERE AND GET IT!""

I have never been more embarrassed in my life.  Sure enough, the waiter brings out this gigantic bowl of nothing but melted butter.  Daisy looks content, but not before one parting shot.

&gt;""TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH!  MY LOBSTER IS GETTING COLD!""

&gt;Bitch you are impossible

&gt;greedybitch.com

The rest of dinner went pretty well, to be honest.  Daisy was so busy killing two lobsters and drowning them in butter that it gave the rest of us time to talk again.  Dessert round was much of the same, and then the check came.  I couldn't help but be nosy as the waiter set it down.

$235 for the whole thing.  Daisy's share of it was half.  He said nothing and put his credit card.  He tipped the waiter $50 for the trouble he had to deal with.  Daisy saw the tip as we were getting up to leave.

&gt;""HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT MUCH!  HE WAS A TERRIBLE WAITER!""

&gt;Alex, just ignore her, please.

&gt;isn't worth arguing.

&gt;nope.

&gt;""He had to deal with a lot, Daisy.  He earned it.""

&gt;MOAR BELLOWING!

&gt;""OH MY GOD NO HE DIDN'T ALEX YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TIP PROPERLY!""

&gt;sigh...

Alex hugged Michelle goodbye and said goodbye to Alicia and I.  Daisy was already out the door and headed for the car.  We apologized to Michelle, who must have come from the same background as Alex and just brushed it off.  Whatever they put in their water, I want some.

The ride home was pretty silent, except for Daisy, who was still lecturing Alex on tipping.  Alex somehow ignored it all the way home.  When we got into the house, Daisy went straight into the small freezer and started heating up food!  It blew all of us away!  Alex went into the living room after grabbing a glass of whiskey and sat down to watch TV.  Alicia and I joined him while Daisy went into her bedroom with another TV dinner.

&gt;""Girls...I hope you enjoyed things tonight.""

&gt;Poor guy looks defeated

Alicia and I squealed like stupid little school girls.  The three of us dove straight into that shit and had a blast that night.  We knew we had at least made one awesome choice with a roommate, while the other would only fuck things up further from here.

1375451111.0	1jkaap	The short tale of how a hamplanet stole donuts from a little girl	Tired0wl	1195	217	89	"I work in a grocery's bakery. Today I was the donut lady. I got up at four, came in at six, and started making magic happen with those beautiful dough snacks.

I make two trays of decorated donuts every morning. One long johns, one rings. This morning I tried out my new sprinkles and made those donuts look BEAUTIFUL. three was icing and colors and sprinkles all over that shit. I carefully made one longjohn into a sprinkle rainbow. It was no small feat.

Enter Mama and Little Girl. I'm making coffee as they look at the donuts. Little girl is pointing at each and every one, saying ""That one's cool! And that one's cool! And that one's cool!"" and then finally, ""I want the rainbow one!""

Mama and little Girl discuss how many they should get and what ones, deciding on the rainbow one for her. Before they can take their pick, a Hamplanet, who has been standing behind Mama and Little Girl and must have heard their entire conversation, squeezes her way between them and the donut case, and proceeds to *pick and choose every donut Little Girl had wanted*. And then she leaves without a word.

Mama looks at her daughter and says, ""Let's just go to he donut store."" They leave too.

1371831456.0	1gsv4z	The Human Blob and the Local Grocery.	cantthinkofgoodname	1191	214	198	"&gt;be me

&gt;enter local grocery store

&gt;get a buggy

&gt;out the large windows at the front of the store, see a small red sedan pull up

&gt;notice it seems to be leaning heavily towards the drivers side, thought maybe they had a flat tire

&gt;windows tinted, couldn't see who was inside

&gt;walk outside, preparing myself to help fix flat or two

&gt;what i saw on that drivers side was something no man, woman or child

&gt;a gelatinous amalgamation of human flesh trying in vain to exit the vehicle

&gt;try and play it off like i left something in my car

&gt;spend the next 6 minutes watching the grease filter's attempt at getting out of the car

&gt;eventually it happens.  she begins walking towards the store at a rate so slow that no measurement of speed could register.

&gt;after what seemed like an hour, she makes it inside.  obviously she goes straight for the mobility scooter.

&gt;notice that as she's going towards it, an old man who came in the opposite door is heading towards it as well.

&gt;if you've never seen an old man and a moving couch race, you haven't lived.

&gt;old man wins race.  sits down on scooter.  the fun begins.

&gt;exasperated and exhausted, the human bowl of jello will not go down easily.  She exalts her issue in between heaving gasps for beautiful oxygen.

&gt;""UHM.. EXCUSE ME, SIR... I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION..AND REQUIRE THE SCOOTER... TO GET AROUND THE STORE.""

&gt;old man glares at her with a look of fury and contempt that takes decades worth of sickening loss and pain to even display.

&gt;""Well I'm sorry, my wife has cancer, can hardly walk at all, and is waiting for me in the car.  This is one of her only opportunities she has to ever get out of the house, and when you get to this age, every time could be the last time.""

&gt;Fatty McDonald is rendered speechless, still attempting to catch her breath.  Old man drives off to his car outside.

&gt;What happens next is beyond all explanation.

&gt;The mammalian washing machine goes to the customer service desk and asks for the head manager.

&gt;Informs him that one mobility scooter is not enough for an entire store for whatever reason.

&gt;keep in mind this is a small, local grocery.

&gt;Manager is the exact opposite of the walking food pit: fit, tall, tan. asks politely ""ma'am, I saw you walk in here fine, what exactly is your condition?  you seemed to walk inside just fine?""

&gt;as if she was reliving the closing of Hostess all over again, her face goes red hot, grease exfoliating itself from her pores in place of sweat.

&gt;""I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE OWNER, RIGHT NOW!""  at this point everyone at the front of the store is staring.  Partially in shock that something that large has mobility at all, and partially in wonder that something so embarrassing to the human race would call attention to itself.

&gt;""I'm actually the owner's son, and in his absence, I take over for him.  You are speaking to the head authority that is here right now.""

&gt;at this point, the old couple who needed the scooter are scooting right behind the aggro-crag to get to the produce section.  she turns to them.

&gt;literally says ""do they look like they need the scooter as much as I do?""

&gt;at this point I'm just standing their laughing.  I've never felt less empathy towards another living creature.  The only thing I cared about now was how utterly embarrassed this breathing dresser drawer could get.

&gt;based old man over hears her rambling and is notably offended.  turns to her ""perhaps if you went on a fucking jog once in a while you wouldn't need this goddamn scooter"" before turning around and continuing on with his wife.  myself and a few other customers are audibly laughing at the fatfuck at this point.

&gt;""MUH CONDITION IS GENETIC SIR!!!11"" she proclaims.  ""I CAN'T HELP MY SIZE!!""

&gt;all the commotion has turned the front of the store into a full on scene.  

&gt;turns back to the manager who's trying his best to keep it together and keep the fatass calm.  

&gt;looked into his eyes and could tell a dastardly, yet hilarious, calculation was churning in his head.

&gt;""Ma'am, if you just want to wait here, I will go and collect a few items for you completely on the house.""   walks off and grabs a grocery basket.

&gt;""MAKE SURE... TO GET MUH DEBBIE SNACKS.. AND CEREAL!!"" the genetic victim told him.

&gt;man walks towards the snack aisle. at that point, everyone has stopped paying attention and moved on. but not me.  I'm standing there at the front of the store, catching glances myself due to my undying observation of the blob incarnate.  

&gt;see manager approaching.  places grocery basket on the counter.  ""here you go ma'am, i picked out some items which i felt we could all benefit from.""

&gt;the basket is filled with a cantaloupe, grapes, a few apples and bananas, an orange, and 6 pack of Aquafina.

&gt;my sides lifted off into elliptical orbit.

&gt;""OH I GET IT, I'M FAT I NEED VEGETABLES AND WATER, WELL KEEP YOUR STUPID FRUITS, YOU COULDN'T EVEN HANDLE A WOMAN LIKE ME!"" - exact words.  The manager as well as a few other patrons put on a look of pure befuddlement.

&gt;the wall woman attempts to storm out, but it takes her at least 6 minutes to get from the counter to the door.

&gt;once she's gone, literally every customer and employee break out in raucous laughter.  a few, including myself, applaud the manager and his antics.

1368632999.0	1edzek	Even in the military, I can't escape the fat logic...	attredies	1147	187	194	"First off, I'm writing this on my phone, so no green text and there may be a typo or two, so please bear with me. 



Before we start, a little background: I'm in the marine corps, serving on a joint army/navy air base. I've seen some bigger guys/gals in uniform, but never too bad. Also, the marines have a stricter weight policy than other branches, so I'm not used to seeing people using two-man military tents as fatigues. 



Be me, 5'9"", 155lb. I don't work out religiously but I do stay fit. This morning I woke up a little early and decided to go to the chow hall before going into my section. I got in line, and had an omelette made for me (Ham, turkey, and some veggies). 


As my plate is handed to me, I feel the tides surge and my plate breaks free of my hand to enter this new mass's orbit. 


Thatsnomoon.fatstar

I turn around and see quite possibly the biggest army soldier I've ever seen. This guy must have enlisted as a tank, because there was room on him for two other soldiers to ride. He eyes my omelet and mutters something under his breath, which I ignore. I pull my plate out of his orbit and walk to my seat, to eat in peace. 


Apparently even a few veggies are too much for Tank, because after loading up his omelette with extra everything fat, hold the lettuce, he picks the table right next to mine and sits down. Whatever, constantly pulling my plate out of his orbit will give me a workout while I eat.. Think rowing machine. 


As I finished my meal, I got up to leave and that's when he decides to pipe up. 


&gt;""Hey Sgt, why'd you pick the marines over a real branch?""



I try to stay out of the inter-branch arguments over who's better, so I simply replied ""because I like the color of their cammies, and they offered me the job I wanted."" 


&gt;Tank: You shouldn't be supporting a branch that forces eating disorders on it's people


Me: I'm sorry?


&gt;Tank: The marines force you all to look so thin, they don't let you be healthy. This is why you're the smallest branch, all the self-respecting people join the army or others, where we can be healthy.


At this point. I realize that I've finally entered an FPS, and time seemed to slow.


Me, trying to be diplomatic one more time: they don't force eating disorders in anyone, they just require us to stay in shape so that we can survive combat. The fitter you are, the better chance you have when you have to run for a mile in 100lbs of gear. 


&gt;Tank: I tried to join the marines, but they said I would have to lose 70 pounds to join, and I wasn't going to. They discriminate against healthy-sized people just to make their people look good. You people make me sick. 


At this point a couple sailors from another table were looking at us. 


Me: soldier, if you had a problem joining my corps, that's your issue, not mine. I personally wouldn't want you anywhere near my squad, and if you want to stay your ""healthy weight"", then by all means, join a branch that allows it. Just remember, you're a much, MUCH larger target than I am, and if you get shot, you would have to rely on me to carry/drag you to safety. Get over your entitlement mentality and grow up. You're in the military. Your job is to protect people, and not just as a body shield.  


As I turned away and walked away from him, I could hear him trying to get the sailors to agree with him, but I didn't pay attention to them, I need to prep my marines for our yearly physical fitness test. 



Tldr: apparently joining the marines is thin privilege

A break here, there are 3 things you get, normal food, minus pork or vegan/vegetarian, you only get special shit if you are allergic to normal food.

&gt;This absolutely doesn't fucking happen in Sweden, assume it's foreign exchange student. Listen more carefully.

&gt;She starts saying how I should be with her, because I would love a woman with real curves.^^TeeHee

&gt;Asks me out to dinner.

&gt;MFW no face when I have never seen her before today in hallway.

We will be right back after these messages:

""Tired of being bitched at by whales? I have, so I decided to buy this bran new harpoon from Harpoon Co, for only $10. Now I don't have to worry about any whales complaining to me, or arguing with me! It's a win-win!""

&gt;openly laugh

&gt;Police fed up with this bullshit, leave

&gt;Beluga suspended pending investigation,

&gt;Her mother(our parents were there whole time) starts yelling about how this is fat discrimination and she shouldn't be punished because ""we"" love each other and because she is overweight

&gt;This wouldn't happen if her daughter was skinny

&gt;Too much fat in her ears I think, maybe brain, she is slightly larger than her daughter.

&gt;Waddle off in a furious grease rage

&gt;Everyone too dumbfounded to say anything, or even move.

Be out to dinner with some friends, boyfriend, and Mini Hamlet. Order myself a burger, no bun, with side salad instead of fries. Boyfriend also orders a burger, no bun.  Mini Hamlet orders chicken wing appetizers, double bacon cheeseburger with fries, and a milkshake. 

Mini Hamlet starts telling me the usual fat logic spiel about how I need to eat real food and nourish myself.  Lecturing me on needing to eat carbs and not just vegetables.   

Mini Hamlet says ""Tunzie, You really need to eat properly.  All food has important nutrients.  Not just salad."", as she shovels an entire chicken wing into her mouth at once. ""see, I eat a variety of foods so I get all the nutrients I need.  Thats why I'm in shape without working out""

Me, politely explain that I am trying to maintain my figure and that I don't have a fantastic metabolism, so I have to watch what I eat. 

Mini Hamlet:""Tunzie, I really don't know why you're so worried.  I eat whatever I want, and never exercise, and we look exactly the same.  We're the same size.""



Boyfriend and I just stare. Open mouthed.  Utterly speechless.  


EDIT: Many of you seem concerned at my lack of burger bun. To clarify, I have recently developed a mild gluten intolerance, thus I cannot be eating burger buns lest I want to suffer some unpleasant side effects.  Do not worry!

At this point, he assumed that based on what she had told him, I was legitimately in the wrong and had accidentally oversprayed a car.  It happens, that's why I have insurance.  As soon as he said ""water buffalo"" I knew who he was referring too - water buffalo are notorious for their ill tempers, poor eyesight and quick rage.  
  
I told him the story, laughed and hung up.  He politely told her she wasn't getting a respray and this was final.  I didn't witness what happened, but she apparently disagreed in such a way as to bring out the great white hunter in BSB.  She was shown from the premises and once again, I thought that was it.  
  
Two weeks later, I was personally served with a demand letter.  D. Beetus &amp; Partners, Attorneys at Lard, formally demanded compensation in the amount of $24,990 plus legal fees on behalf of their client.  $6000 of this was direct costs relating to a bare metal re-spray of a black (and arctic white) mini cooper and the remainder was compensation for pain &amp; suffering, insult to dignity and infliction of duress due to physical threats.  
  
Yes, you math-sleuths are correct, the humiliation, pain, suffering and indignity inflicted on this poor women demanded no less than $18,000 cash to make her whole again.  Plus her legal fees.  
  
Whelp, this was a bit of a surprise.  I put in a call to legal-bro, my lawyer.  I faxed him the demand letter, he read it out loud to me over the phone, and many lulz were had.  
  
""In all seriousness though, I'm a real estate lawyer so if you did any of this, you should hire a litigator.  But, if you did get permits then pull a copy of them, and get your employees to provide written, notarized statements of what they witnessed and you should be okay if she actually sues you.""  
  
Two weeks later, another fat (lol) envelope arrives by process server.  Yup, I'm getting sued.  
  
Another call to legal-bro.  ""Seriously man, get a litigator if you are worried.  But, they made a point to sue you for the maximum amount allowed in small claims so it's most likely bullshit.""  
  
Alpha as fuck, don't need no litigator.  The first step is a settlement conference, we'll see how serious they are.  If it looks bad, I'll lawyer up then counter-sue. What a waste of time though...  
  
I mentioned to BSB that she had in fact sued me.  He just laughed.  
Two days later, another package arrived.  Fuck.  Jimmies are already rustled, what next?  It's a DVD.  How mysterious!    
Throw it on the laptop, it's a surveillance tape from BSBs body shop.  The camera is aimed at his fenced in parking lot, but in one corner you can see the street.  The beautiful 720p footage shows pretty much exactly what I described in part 1.  The camera really does add 10 or 100 lbs, or maybe it was just because she was standing next to a Mini.  
  
The boy scout thing to do would be to copy this DVD and courier one to D. Beetus &amp; Partners so they could skip the settlement conference and just write up the final bill for their client.  
  
But, I've been to small claims court before albeit as the plaintiff (6 for 6 bitches, yes I can law) and it's an old building.  The small conference rooms are on the third floor, there are no elevators.  Court rooms and info desk etc etc are on the main floor to accomodate disabled people..  The real question is, did the plaintiff's lawyer consider his client's condishun and request a disabled access conference room on the first floor?  
Not according to the notice I was served.  See you Room 304, bitch.  
  
Settlement hearing day arrives.  My Bentley is back from BSBs shop and looking sharp.  Today the old leather and wool smell like justice.  I am optimistic and wearing my favourite three button suit, british cut for a slender build.  I feel thin and privileged.  
Also slender is my leather binder.  It contains naught but three things - a DVD, a copy of the traffic control permit and 8 notarized witness statements.  
  
I run up the three flights of stairs to room 304.  It is empty.  At 10am, precisely on time, a knock on the door.  It is the adjudicator.  Thank God I got a normal sized one today - my whole case could hinge on it!  
We sit down and wait.  5 minutes.  10 minutes.  At 15 minutes the adjudicator anounces that the hearing will begin at 10:20 regardless of attendance.  
At 10:20 the door is thrown open.  The water buffalo and her lawyer enter.  
  
Does the plaintiff wish to go first?  Yes, you better believe she does.  She is still panting loudly from the excruciating ascent.  But, sweet, delicious, insulin rich justice is about to be served, so she proceeds.  
I'm not going to recount her version of the events because honestly, I don't really remember.  Jimmies were rustled, blood pressure spiked, but I do remember practicing breathing techniques to calm myself in the face of her rambling, incoherent but mostly inaccurate account.  
  
Her lawyer cut her off after about 20 minutes, and, as pleasantly as possible, volunteered that we were all tired, it was a hot day, and let's do what we can to avoid court, okay?  For $15,000 we can settle this and go home.  
  
Does he want to hear my counter offer?  Of course he does!  The Water Buffalo perks up out her stupor - climbing stairs, then talking emotionally for 20 minutes is more exercise than her enlarged heart gets in a week.  But, when I mention counter offer, she is refreshed.  
  
Ah, but first allow me to make use of the A/V equipment.  It won't take long, I promise, then I'll get back to the counter offer.  I pull out the DVD.  Brows furrow, jimmies begin rustling in concerned anticipation.  What is this?  Why was it not mentioned?  How could this man allow me to dream of muh settlement when he has a trick up his sleeve?  Curse those devious thin people....  
  
Right there, on the 40"" LCD screen, the saga unfolds.  We watch it for about 10 minutes in silence.  
I turn it off, and collect the DVD.  
 
The adjudicator turns to the now deflated bean bag chair, whose dreams of compunsayshun had evaporated.  
""Ma'am, is that your car?""  
""yes""
""Is that you in the video?""
""yes""
Turns to me - ""Can I see a copy of your traffic control permit?""
The adjudicator reads it several times, glancing between the demand letter back and forth, checking dates and times.  
  
The adjudicator speaks.  
""Ma'am, it is my recomendation that you do not proceed with this action.""  
  
The lawyer agrees.  The adjudicator offers a settlement form, indicating no settlement.  We all sign.  Photocopies are made.  
I jump up, ""Whelp, I'm out of here""
Grab my copy of the form, and as I pass her, slide the copy of the DVD in front of her.  
  
Skip down the three flights of stairs, knowing this will add insult to her injury...  
7/7 in small claims.  
  
TL:DR  She sues me, case gets ""tossed"" after BSB provides HD security cam footage.  Has to walk up and down three flights of stairs as punishment for being a naughty buffalo.  Probably also has to pay her lawyer a couple thousand for drawing up the suit and attending the conference.

Hello my BBWs, I'm back and i've dragged my bf (/u/notbelgianbutdutch) in front the computer and we're doing this one together! Prepare for some good old fashions Hamthrax action. Thank you everyone who contributed puns, its just getting better and better. All your comments have us rolling on the ground like Hamthrax after a chair malfunction.

&gt;So after a good month of having our lunches interrupted by the seismograph wobbling Hamthrax, it's decided we need a more covert lunch spot

&gt;figured any place near a salad bar would good.

&gt;decide on a park, grass might confuse Tank Zappa into staying away

&gt;is also on a hill, no way the lettuce dodger could make it up there without her gale force breathing alerting us to the oncoming fructose storm

&gt;first day, all good

&gt;Alice in Fast Food Chains doesn't spot us

&gt;ninja.exe

&gt;shocking lack of Beached Whale Boys for a week, we start feeling pretty safe

&gt;Monday rolls around like Whitecake fighting her sleep apnea 

&gt;in the park, eating lunch, having good time

&gt;cuteshit.mpeg

&gt;feel disturbance in the gravitational force

&gt;birds leave nearby trees

&gt;somewhere a mountain goat brays warning

&gt;either Odin is coming down to smite the unworthy or we're about to have our romantic spot nuked in spam. 

&gt;Sure enough, deep labored breathing starts creeping over the hills

&gt;a fog of Cheeto dust rolls in, and we are instantly immobilized

&gt;the voices comes from the orange mist that so thick it usually only inhabits jersey shore.

&gt;JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/fI87NoZ.gif) we realize we have been compromised

&gt;Jimi Hamdrix appears, lugging what is sure to be a deli lunch with more mayo than the Dutch population consumes annually (WOO Belgian SLAM)

&gt;She spots us and trundles over, struggling as most cows do when their hooves are jammed into four inch heels

&gt;whatthefuckisshewearing.xls

&gt;apparently Ham Halen has forgotten she is planet and is wearing a skirt shorter than her impulse control

&gt;blazer button is holding on for dear life as she jiggles over to our park bench, can practically hear the fabric screaming

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/Ag5QTSJ.gif) we realize she must have found the only clothing store that sells suits in ""tent-size""

&gt;bf instinctively flinches as she nears, knowing its only a matter of time before he will be forcibly parted from his air supply by a lard coated hug

&gt;nothing about this girl is pretty, least of all her insides

&gt;eat in silence though

&gt;bf looks close to homicide/intestinal distress

&gt;poor man has had his fill of Hamthrax

&gt;holds eye contact as Iron Mayo swallows an entire sandwich

&gt;man has the strength of 1000 suns (similar to Hamthrax's BMI)

&gt;Hamthrax invites us (i.e. Jan) to metal concert

&gt;some noname band who apparently all had a shot at her deep fried spring rolls

&gt;(ofw)[http://i.minus.com/itiYDIPtyZwbh.gif] she starts describing their dicks

&gt;we cheerfully decline saying we have things to do

&gt;Trans Siberian Porkestra immediately attacks me for being a ""boy-hogger"" 

&gt;""Listen roomsgotrooms, it's not good to be so controlling""

&gt;yup.amzn

&gt;tell her i think it's weird that she would invite Jan to a concert in front of me without assuming he'd take his long-term gf.

&gt;""I don't know you like i know JAN""

&gt;still pronounces his name like a drooling American trashbin

&gt;Red Hot Pockets is now bubbling over with rage staring at me

&gt;mascara starts to run down her mayo streaked face

&gt;direct sunlight *is* the best disinfectant

&gt;take this time to calmly stand up and throw away the rest of my food

&gt;think bf will follow, unaware he is caught in Skid Roll's orbit.

&gt;bits of snack food encircle her middle in a graceful dance of gravitational attraction

&gt;look back to see bf paler than Red Velvet Cheesecake Revolver's pillow arms

&gt;suggest we head back

&gt;Hamthrax is not finished with her lunch

&gt;Is faced with the ulitimate Fat Logic dilema:

&gt;Eat food, or keep stalking prey in hopes of sexual conquest

&gt;we see the chocolate covered gears churning under her shaggy, greasy threads of hair

&gt;makes the only decision a Hambeast can, and keeps feasting as we walk away, powerless against the magic of Doritos

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/uoWQv.png) she gurgles ""bye babe""

We have had way too much fun, will definetly write another one. Stay tuned!!!!!!!

EDIT: We know, she's a parasite who needs to fuck off. We're pretty amused by it, and when we want to get away, we get away (not that hard). Just sharing some funny stories, no need for concern. These are also in the span of a year not a daily occurrence. She doesn't follow us home or anything...

1375644046.0	1jp032	Incredibly short FPS	Murielli	1188	253	137	"Boyfriend, roommate and I were sitting in a local restaurant, let's call it Applebees for shits and giggles. Excitedly eyeing dat steak at the next table and planning my night of gluttony and drunken debauchery. 

There was a hamplanet girl sitting at the next table by herself. I only noticed this because she seemed to order exactly the same thing as my table did. Fried cheesesticks for an appetizer to share, steaks, baked potatoes, and beers all around. (We all go there every Friday and order the exact same thing.) Also because Fatgirl was pointedly staring at our table the entire time, and making all of us uncomfortable. 

Drunk boyfriend texts me a dare to finish my food before HamGirl does. I feebly attempt this incredible feat, fail immediately as HamGirl finishes her meal before I'm a quarter of the way through with mine. Hamgirl calls waitress, requests check, pays, and goes to stand awkwardly by the door. About five minutes later, a Hammy couple comes in, and they all exchange hugs and greetings.

Hamgirl walks with them back to the table that she had just left, exclaiming ""I'm so glad you guys invited me, I haven't eaten ALL DAY!"" The last two words she emphasized while glaring at our table. Boyfriend, roommate and I just kind of exchange looks of confusion that quickly turn into giggles when Hamgirl orders, once again, cheesesticks, a steak, potatoes, and beer. 

The Hamily spends the next half hour discussing how Hamgirl is starving herself because her bulimic roommate eats all her food, and she just isn't mean enough to call her out on it. Hamgirl has asked repeatedly to move rooms, but her college has it out for her and refuses to let her move. HamDad wants to talk to bulimic roommate, but Hamgirl says that she's in college now and none of the people in her dorms would let her forget it if she needed her dad to solve her problems. HamParents eventually decide to just double Hamgirls allowance for food, so she can eat out instead of buying groceries.

MFW the college they're talking about is a local community college that doesn't offer housing of any kind.

**TL;DR** HamGirl buys herself large dinner, eats large dinner, meets parents moments later and has them buy her another large dinner, announces to entire world that she hasn't eaten all day while eating her second dinner. Glares scarily at my friends and I, presumably for being able to fit in a booth. Makes up story about her dorm that doesn't exist to get more food money from parents."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; I grumble and quickly ask where smf is. “Oh, she’s at a DR appointment. She’ll be in around 10.”

&gt; “Great” I think to myself. I won’t have to put up with her through this meeting.

&gt; Walk into the meeting with a few of my co-workers and surprise! obg is there. Hmmm, he’s not on my team so I wonder why he’s in my meeting. I think nothing of it.

&gt; bossman chimes in and starts his talk “we all know why were here. smf has taken it one step further. She claims she was verbally assaulted. I need both you and obg to testify in a written statement that nothing of the sort took place”

unbelievable. whatever, we did the statements

&gt; all of a sudden, the door flies open and in sideways-walks jumbotron herself; smf.

&gt;”sorry I'm late. I was at the hospital” we look at each other puzzled “the stress from yesterday gave me anxiety and I nearly had a heart attack”

&gt; YES! The logic shines through on this one. I’m so sure the stress gave you a heart attack. No way could it have been the three deep fried chickens you ate while trying to bathe yourself. This bitch is starting to piss me off. Glad I had my Tim Horton’s! (I’m in Canada. Timmy’s is la cafe de choix ici.)

&gt; HR advisor says “Can I get you a chair?”

&gt; obg and myself roll our eyes. we’ve had enough. we let out a laugh of frustration and utter disbelief. we are laughing at what everyone else in the room is thinking.

&gt; smf gets a snarled look on her face but doesn’t say anything.

&gt; boss says “smf, obg, idgygdi… we’ve determined what happened yesterday and by the consistency of your stories, obg and idgygdi, and we’ve decided in the favour of you two. smf, stay here and the two of you can leave.”

&gt; what now? justice is SERVED? thanks, universe.

we decide to hang back outside the door and eavesdrop. best. decision. ever.

&gt; smf “why did they get sent out of the office?”

&gt; boss “smf, you were belligerent, racist, rude, and you wasted almost 50 man hours trying to get this bloody thing resolved. do you know how expensive your little drama-queen episode was? 50 man hours for a wasted complaint that was useless and unneeded. we will be holding back 50hrs worth of pay (1 week/5days is 37.5hrs) and that works out to 7 days total.”

&gt; smf raised started to raise some stink but boss cut her off quickly

&gt; “to add to the 50 hours, you will be reprimanded and sent to sensitivity training, at your own expense, for a minimum of 10 hours. this sensitivity training is dependant on your future with this company” (In other words, if she doesn’t do the training, she doesn’t get to keep the job)

&gt; “I can see that the weight is an issue for you, so we will set you up with a credit for 2 free sessions of medically supervised weight-loss, but after that it’s up to you to keep it up if you want to lose the weight. Any questions?”

&gt; smf starts to comment and before she can even sputter a word, boss chimes in and says “no? good. have a nice day”

boss leaves the room

&gt; HR advisor and smf continue their convo. “I suggest you take his deal and let it go. the more you fight this, the more trouble it will get you in.”

But today, he returned from a trip to Walmart. A minor personal emergency had necessitated that he spend his grocery money the previous week, and he'd had to cut out some of his favorite snacks. A number of these snacks include Sunny-D, Hawaiian Punch, Kool-Aid Bursts, and other sweet, sugary juices. This week he got paid, and he went and splurged on his favorite foods. 

He burst in the door with his bags falling from each arm, and shouted, ""YES! I have my juice!""

""That's good, dude,"" I said, pouring a mug of coffee in the kitchen as he placed the juices in the fridge.

""I didn't have them all last week,"" he said, cracking open a Kool-Aid. ""It was terrible. You know what I had to drink? Water! Who drinks water?""

I was about to answer with '...most people?' when he answered himself, crying, ""Beasts! BEASTS, I TELL YOU!""

* * *

I moved out of the house when I was 16 and in with my very good friend and her family. 
Her dad was a truck driver and was gone for a week or so at a time and was only home for a day or two in between. 
She had an 8 year old little brother who would get super bored during the day and didn't really have a male role model while his dad was gone, so I kind of filled the role of ""big brother"" (the kid is awesome so I didn't mind).


We played airsoft, Call of Duty, freezetag, and a bunch of other games with each other and his friends when I wasn't working or hanging out with my friends. 
This kid LOVED the military almost to the point where it was creepy. 
I had extra cash at the time so I figured, ""Why not take him to the military surplus store? They've got tons of shit there he'll love"". 
I didn't have a car at the time so I asked his sister to take us and she agreed, but we had to pick up her friend on the way.




I suppose this is where I should describe her friend.
She was 17 years old, about 5'3"", and at least 300lbs.
To give you an idea of her proportions she had actually insisted on driving after we picked her up because she didn't want to sit in the back seat, and she used her belly/FUPA to hold the steering wheel in place.




&gt;Dem curves.





We get to the surplus store and she immediately starts complaining about being there. 
I always thought they were cool - gas masks, guns, knives, WWII-era uniforms, targets, novelty stuff like hand grenade paperweights, etc.
The kid and I go upstairs and find the MRE's (pre-made complete meals in sealed pouches that can be heated up). These usually have an insanely high calorie count since they're made for people in the military/survival situations.
The best part? They were on sale. I think it was something like 2 for $5.00 which was a bargain since they're usually $4.00/each depending on the type. I think we got like 12 of them - mostly the lunch/dinner ones but a few breakfast types. Omelets, pasta, pop tarts, etc.





The hamplanet is bitching still, going off on a tirade about how I'm wasting my money by buying a $20 Israeli gas mask for a kid and telling me I need a girlfriend to spend that money on. I kind of brush it off since I don't know her well and pay for the stuff while the kid is literally jumping up and down because he's so happy.



We get back to the house and show his mom our spoils of war - leaving the MRE's out in the car with the hamplanet since we were going to go to the store after dropping the kid off.





My friend gets a text from hamplanet saying, ""I need to borrow your car to get something from my house. I'll brb."", and we hear the car leaving the driveway. No big deal, she'll be back with the stuff so we can look through it and plan out meals for our ""missions"".




I'm sure some of you already know what happened. The bitch ate **SEVEN** of the MRE's in the time span of ~30 minutes. **THIRTY FUCKING MINUTES**. Each one of them has ~1,200 calories. What's fucked up is she didn't have time to go to her house and back since she lived out in the country. She legit had to have left, parked somewhere, and feasted on them.





We didn't even notice them missing when she got back since she put the wrappers back in the bag on the bottom. When we *did* notice and called her out on it she didn't even try defending herself or even apologizing. She just stared.

* * *



**TL;DR;**: hamplanet has bad attitude, steals 14,400 calories worth of MRE's, and eats half of them. Doesn't apologize when called out, just stares."	t5_2vzax	True

I was able to eat an entire large pizza, drink two 2 liters of soda, and a whole bag of chips in a sitting. Taco Bell was my Mecca and every other day, I'd get a crunch wrap supreme combo with double the meat, two volcano burritos, and the largest soda that they could offer.

I started to feel like utter shit all of the time, I was depressed, and food was my only form of comfort. I couldn't walk a mile without feeling like pure death. 


In October, I realized that I was sick of being a complete fatass and started my journey toward being as healthy as possible. I started getting more exercise and I altered my diet. I didn't believe in myself at all and thought I was going to fail. 

Weight started to fall off and I decided I'd keep with it for a while and see how far I could get with my recent lifestyle changes. When I saw that I was actually making progress, I decided to amp it up and work as hard as possible. 

Now, I am the healthiest I have ever been in my life. I've lost 80+ pounds and I'm losing more every week! I'm only 22% body fat now and I can run 8 miles without feeling remotely tired and I am training for my first triathlon! 

I feel certain that I will never be fat again. I no longer crave shitty food, I know how to cook healthily, and I find joy in exercising and pushing as hard as I can. I have also changed my major to health and wellness so I can help other people make the decision that I did and become healthier.

After spewing a few more obscenities, the evil hambeast leaves empty handed. I hug my manager and sob sweet pubescent tears.

When I relayed this experience later that night to my dad, he told me about this study he read when he was getting his master's. Scientists damaged the hypothalamus (hunger regulation part of the brain) of lab rats. Apparently this resulted in the rats aggressively and compulsively eating food to the point of immobility. They also began attacking any other rats that came near. The scientists dubbed them ""fat angry rats"".

1371347598.0	1gfjqc	Momma Ham and Tween Ham are offended by my thin body at the pool.	laura__laurent	1095	193	176	"So, I've been lurking this subreddit for a while now, so I've decided to create this account to share some of my own encounters with fat logic, for I have experienced many in my career as a pharmacy intern (and soon to be licensed pharmacist). However, this first story I'm going to share with you is unrelated to my job. It just happened today. First time greentexin', jimmies, fasten your seatbelts. 

&gt;Be me, 5'4"" 99lbs, thin 23 year old female. It's my day off, and I have nothing to do, so I decide to head down to my apartment complex's pool, as it is a lovely, hot day and I'm hoping to soak up some summer sun. Put on my bikini and head out! 


&gt;Stake out a seat, slather on the SPF, put my headphones in, and proceed to zone out. Ahh, relaxation. 


&gt;Been relaxing for approx. half an hour when suddenly, the water in the pool begins to slosh back and forth.


&gt;Sky goes black; has the sun disappeared behind a lunar eclipse? 


&gt;No, it's just a hamplanet, approaching me with her mini-ham daughter in tow. 


&gt;Momma Ham is a bit taller than me, maybe 5'6"" and I'd say about 350 lbs. Ham Tween looks to be about 13 or 14, and is about 5'0"" and at least 180, maybe 200. 


&gt;Although there are many lounge chairs available, the Hams decide to plop down on the two chairs right beside me. We make awkward eye contact. Being born and raised in the Midwest, I smile at them automatically, out of polite acknowledgement. Momma Ham side-eyes me and grunts. Notice tween Ham whisper something to Momma.


&gt;whatever.jpeg, go back to listening to Jake Bugg and close my eyes again.


&gt;Moments later, I am disturbed out of my cat nap by an irritable voice, grubmling, ""Excuse me, Miss?"" 


&gt;Hmm. Can't be talking to me. I'm just gonna ignore that...


&gt;""Excuse me?!?"" 


&gt;Please, no...please don't let that be...


&gt;""Hello! Excuse muhh!"" 


&gt;Take my headphones out and sit up. It's Momma Ham, and she looks pissed. Her beady eyes are sunken so far deeply into her flabby face that I can barely make out her expression, but I can only assume she's glaring at me. 


&gt;""Uh, yes ma'am?"" I ask.


&gt;Momma Ham: ""I would appreciate if you would cover yourself up. The way you're dressed is not appropriate."" 


&gt;Quickly glance down, make sure no wardrobe malfunctions have occurred (at this point I'm assuming one of my tits is hanging out of my top or something). Nope, bikini top and bottom are safely where they should be! So be me, rather confused. 


&gt;Me:""Sorry, I...I'm not sure I know what you mean. This is the pool, and I'm wearing a bathing suit, just like everyone else here..."" 


Here I'll add, Momma Ham was wearing one of those frumpy swim dress things, like a one-piece swim suit with a little skirt on the bottom, but tween Ham was wearing a comparable bikini to mine. In fact, I would argue that hers was more ""revealing"" than mine, being that her boobs were spilling out of her top, and I have none to speak of.


&gt;Momma Ham: ""Ain't no one else here wearing a bikini like that! You skinny girls, think just cuz you got a body like that, you can just show off all your bits, it ain't right!"" 


&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, I really don't know what you're talking about...I'd say all my 'bits' are fully covered. Your daughter's suit is about the same as mine, out of all the ladies here in bikinis, why are you asking me to cover up and not them?"" 


&gt;Momma Ham sighs indignantly. ""You're hurting my daughter's feelings! Because she has to sit here and look at *you*, she's reminded of all the people in this world who tell her she's not good enough just because she's not some skinny little twig!""


&gt;Tween ham starts giggling. Clearly, she's very upset. /s ""Yeah, so just put a t-shirt on, will ya?"" *chugs a can of Sprite* 


&gt;I'm not too confrontational, but I just couldn't let this bitch be so rude to me, so I say, ""You know, it's not very nice to call me a skinny twig. What if I told you I actually had an illness that makes me this small?"" Which I do, chronic migraines, and the medication I take to prevent them doesn't help. 


&gt;Tween ham pipes up, ""Oh yeah, like anorexia?"" 


&gt;At this point, I'm expecting that I'm on the TV show ""What Would You Do?"" and that John Quinones and crew are gonna come out and tell them this was all an elaborate rouse. Sadly, I'm just part of a real life FPS. 


&gt;Me: ""Look, I'm here to get a tan and enjoy my afternoon. If you don't like to look at me, there are plenty of other chairs on the other side of the pool deck, why don't you go sit over there?"" 


Note that I didn't feel I should have to move, I was there first, dammit, and they were the ones causing a scene. At this point, several other people who were near us were glancing over to discern what was occurring.


&gt;Momma Ham gets up to bitch to the pool monitor. Pool monitor is not a lifeguard. He's just a guy who sits at the pool all day to make sure that everyone who comes in is actually an apartment resident, isn't bringing alcohol, and is over 18 (can't be under 18 without a parent). 


&gt;I hear her all the way across the pool deck, yelling about how scantily clad I am, how I'm arguing with her, and how I'm hurting her daughter's precious feelings (by existing?). I worry for second; Pool monitor is a big guy himself. But it appears her fat logic isn't working on him! They both walk over to where our chairs are located (Momma Ham huffing and puffing the whole way.)


&gt;Pool Monitor, to me: ""Dear, are these ladies bothering you?"" 


&gt;Me: ""Yes sir."" 


&gt;Pool Monitor: ""I thought so."" He directs his attention back to Momma Ham: ""Look, I heard your whole conversation with this lady, you started the whole thing. She's clearly within pool dress code, doing nothing wrong. She gave you the option to move, and you refused, so I'm going to ask you to leave for the day."" 


&gt;Momma Ham is furious. Starts blathering about ""You can't kick me outta here! I pay my rent just like her! She's the one causing a disturbance! You just took her side cuz she's skinny! Imma take this up with management, you'll be sorry!"" She continues to whine as she packs up her cooler of snacks. she and Tween ham both shake their turkey gobbler necks at me as they are forced out by cool Pool Monitor, my new BFF. 

**tl;dr I offend Momma Ham and her tween Ham daughter at the pool just by existing in a thin, bikini-clad body.**

You back? Let's rock. 

So. I've suddenly become the nastiest roomie ever. Now do you recall in the last story when I said I trotted off to the leasing office? 

I went there to explain this situation, fleas spiders filth no money keeps stealing my food very hungry place is flithy etc to them. The whole office gathered round to hear it. They called in the maintenance guys and I had to retell it. In the end, what won them over was my saying, ""Look. Either you give me my own place and I promptly pay rent, or you leave me there, and I can't anymore. I need to eat, and I cannot possibly continue like this."" They said, ""Okay, your credit rating's okay, we'll trust you""  and offered me a bagel, which I devoured on the spot. Fuck toasting it. I was *that* hungry. I probably looked like a ravening wolf. 

Walked out of there with a new lease; they let me out of the one with Flabby and set me up with a new place, all by myself, on the other side of the complex. 

Flabby had no idea, just went about her usual day, messing up the kitchen and wrecking my shit that wasn't in the bedroom (meaning, the kitchen stuff; *everything* else I owned had been stuffed into my room when she moved in. Rather crowded, I have a lot of books). 

You're supposed to give notice when you bail on a roomie, but fuck that shit. She'd already cost me a couple grand in broken stuff, bills she ran up and didn't pay, and the food I bought that I never saw again because she fucking ate it. Oh, and now and then she'd splort out of her lair and demand to go with me on my dinner date because she's hungry and I'm selfish and how can I leave her to just starve. I was exquisitely polite, which might have tipped off someone that wasn't so food-centered, because god knows I was not shy for the last few weeks before I got the new lease. Nope. Then it was nonstop yelling at her from the time I got home till the time I went to bed and nonstop death metal at max volume behind a locked door when I was at work. This chick redefined oblivious. I'm terrible at this shit, even I would've twigged. Her? Nope. Just ""I wanna go too, I'm hungryyyyyy!"" Cry me a river. I kept up the deathmetal thing, although it seems it just trained her to sleep through anything. 

Stuck out the final two weeks. Got home the night before my move, she was mysteriously missing. Must be a bill coming due.... YEP there it is, sitting on the kitchen counter with a note swearing she'll pay and chastising me for being mean. Mmmhm. I'm mean for asking you to pay the last one, Flabby? Which you never have? 

Now-husband came over and we packed all my shit up and then went to new place with my mattress and couch. Stuck in a flea bomb and ran like hell. Wonderful thing! I washed down all the exposed areas the next day. Nobody got sick, and I saw not ONE insect in my place for the year I was there. A blissfully bug-free year... and a blissfully fatlogic-free year too. I could finally cook without some dipshit manifesting in the kitchen and whining when's it gonna be ready and that's not enough and ARGH. 

I was free. And someone did gift me with a secondhand set of pots and pans; mine were a total loss thanks to Flabby. I just left them there. 

Flea-bathed the cats the night before MoveOut. They did not enjoy this. Cats have about 157 ways of letting you know they're unhappy. Ow. Packed the cats over to his place, where I stayed the night as well. 

Next morning. Already hot as Satan's asshole, at 7 in the fucking morning. Texas, man. Flabby still missing; expected that, she never comes home for three days when she knows I'm gonna ream her out for bill money. Excellent. 2 of my then-current 3 boyfriends turned up; the last one had to work. 

More friends turned up, and we moved all my shit, sweating our butts off, across the complex and out of that shithole. Now-husband went and fetched my kittens when we were done, and I ordered pizza and beer for everyone. AS YOU SHOULD. People bust their asses for you, it's on you to reward them properly. We had a grand evening. Net wasn't on yet, and I didn't even bother with cable, so we just shot the shit and got tanked. 

The shitfest from old apartment was amazing. The people in the complex office loved me, so I got a play by play. WELL. Flabby called in a fucking complaint about my bailing without notice. They blew her some shine and hung up. Month goes by. She calls in saying the AC isn't working. They sent over a maintenance guy. He came back and told them, then they told me, that he has never in his life seen such filth. He refused to go in. Think about that. A maintenance guy refused to step foot in her place.

Little while later, I'm going to work and I see a familiar car parked outside of my place. It's Flabby's! What the fuck is it doing over here? That chick won't walk 50 feet if she can help it. Something's up. 

Run back upstairs. Inform Bitch Squad. They gleefully investigate. Run back down and jog to work.

Get home and.... 

Turns out, the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles is looking for her car because she hasn't bothered to have it inspected for over a year. Or registered. I went and looked. Both her registration and her inspection stickers were Photoshopped. Badly, I might add. I took some pics. 

..... oh my. Shall I do this? Very evil. Surely, Alice, you're better than that... 

No, I'm not. Civic duty and unholy amounts of glee compel me. FUCK YEAH I'M GONNA FUCK THIS BITCH UP. No, let's call it civic duty. No; let's call it what it is. Be honest with yourself. She fucked you over, and now you've got this one precious unbelievable chance to fuck her back. 

Yep. It was pure revenge.

Welp. Hour later, cops hauled that lazy sneaking foodthief out of her house in cuffs and towed her car. I watched the whole thing. She had no idea she'd parked her car in front of my place. 

I tell you all, it was magnificent. 

Won't surprise you to know that she was online later that week whining about oppression and being picked on and police brutality (total bullshit, saw it all, she was crying and struggling and flailing about, trying to use her weight, and they just kept marching her into the car). 

Then the apartment complex finally got their eviction cleared and BOOM goes the dynamite. We had a little party at my place, drinking beers and watching this shithead haul her own shit downstairs - it would seem nobody wanted to help. Such a mystery, ha, can't imagine why. 

Now I hope that's enough for all of your jimmies to come to rest. I am not a fan of beating the fuck out of someone, but I am a fan of getting them busted for their egregious shit, and that's exactly what I did. Hope that's alpha enough for all of you. 

TL;DR: Lardass fatlogical roomie fucked me over; got her a police record and evicted.

&gt; Lies down on linoleum floor

&gt; Starts crying

&gt; Coworker and I are dumbstruck

&gt; What

&gt; Try to make him get up

&gt; Cries more and struggles weakly on the floor

&gt; Calls us evil bitches

&gt; Must. Stifle. Laughter.

&gt; Consider whaling on him with the oars in the back room

&gt; Decide not to

&gt; Instantly regret decision when he gets up and tackles me

&gt; WHAT THE FUCK

&gt; NOPE

&gt; Throw Mike off me

&gt; FUCK THAT

&gt; Throw L suit at him

&gt; Tell him to put it on or else

&gt; He puts it on

&gt; Barely fits

&gt; It's way to tall and narrow

&gt; Oh fucking well

&gt; Chuck a life jacket at him

&gt; Lets get shit moving

&gt; Herd Mike towards the door

&gt; He remains silent

&gt; Tell him to grab a piece of equipment to bring down to the dock

&gt; Give him a bag of sails

&gt; Super light

&gt; Mike looks at it like it's a bundle of veggies

&gt; ""I'm not carrying that""

&gt; Coworker has had enough of his shit

&gt; Chucks the bag at him

&gt; Says if he doesn't take it we're calling his mom

&gt; See fear in his eyes

&gt; He picks up the bag

&gt; Finally get to the dock after waiting for Mike to waddle down

&gt; He doesn't stop complaining once the whole way

&gt; MY FEET HURT

&gt; I'M TIRED

&gt; THIS IS TOO FAR

&gt; Dock is 40 feet from the Yacht club

&gt; Coworker is livid

&gt; I'm about ready to murder Mike

&gt; Aaaaaaand apparently everyone has left, and taken the sailboats

&gt; Check the time

&gt; We're 2 hours behind them

&gt; Put Mike in the instructor skiff

&gt; Coworker winces when Mike gets in and it tips heavily to his side

&gt; Notice boat is almost out of gas

&gt; Fucking fantastic

&gt; End up dropping Mike off in boss's boat to make a fuel run

&gt; Come back and find out boss put Mike in one of the other kid's boats

&gt; Sweet release

&gt; A full hour of Mike-free relaxing on the safety skiff

&gt; Lunch time!

&gt; No wind so we tow all the sail boats back to the dock

&gt; Get all the students into the classroom

&gt; Everyone unpacks their lunches

&gt; Fucking Mike brought enough to feed a small family

&gt; Has fucking pizza in his backpack

&gt; A whole fucking pizza

&gt; FOR LUNCH

&gt; Proceeds to mow down the whole thing in under 10 minutes

&gt; I don't even

&gt; Apparently Mike is still hungry

&gt; HOW

&gt; Starts scoping out the other kids lunches

&gt; Locks on a target

&gt; Tiny girl, probably only 50 or 60 lbs

&gt; Has a brownie

&gt; Mike lumbers over

&gt; GIMME THAT

&gt; Swipes brownie, downs it in one bite

&gt; Sweet jesus

&gt; Coworker and I confront him

&gt; Immediately starts crying

&gt; Says we're picking on him for being different

&gt; Says it's not fair

&gt; Says it's not his fault he was still hungry

&gt; Must suppress rage

&gt; Tell him to apologize

&gt; Starts crying more

&gt; Boss looks on helplessly

&gt; Nothing he can do

&gt; We decide to let it slide

&gt; Nothing we can do either

&gt; Then he says he needs help out of his drysuit

&gt; Ask why

&gt; Says he has to go to the bathroom

&gt; Fair enough

&gt; Help him out

&gt; He has deep rings around his neck, ankles, and wrists from the drysuit seals

&gt; Show him the bathroom

&gt; Go back to classroom

&gt; Moments after closing double doors, hear an earsplitting shriek

&gt; Rush back to bathroom, knock on door

&gt; You okay in there buddy?

&gt; Hear crying

&gt; Check doorknob

&gt; It's locked

&gt; Ask again what's wrong

&gt; Even more crying

&gt; Other kids are suiting up to go out again

&gt; Start banging on door

&gt; Shit is something seriously wrong

&gt; Finally crying stops and I hear Mike whimper something

&gt; What's that? I couldn't hear you, could you repeat it?

&gt; He needs help wiping

&gt; NOPENOPENOPE

&gt; Tell boss

&gt; Boss immediately calls the contact number for Mike's mom

&gt; No answer

&gt; Tries again

&gt; Still no answer

&gt; Mike still locked in bathroom

&gt; Starting to smell something rancid from under the door

&gt; Boss says to stay with Mike and keep calling his mom

&gt; I hit redial until she picks up

&gt; WURT DUR YEH WANT

&gt; Excuse me ma'm, you need to pick up your son

&gt; ERHM BUSY

&gt; He's having trouble wiping himself, and frankly this isn't something we're prepared for

&gt; YER MEAN YER AFRED OF A LITTLE MESS? WERT KIRND OF SAILING INSTRUCTAH ARE YER

&gt; Please just come pick up your son, ma'm. You will be fully refunded for the class

&gt; FINE FINE

&gt; Hangs up

&gt; Mike still in the bathroom

&gt; How could this get any worse

&gt; At least he's getting picked up

&gt; OH WAIT

&gt; NOPE

&gt; Greasemonster doesn't show up for another 2 fucking hours

&gt; Mike is still in the bathroom

&gt; Everything is starting to smell like ass

&gt; Finally the mother arrives

&gt; Tells Mike to open the door

&gt; More crying

&gt; He won't

&gt; She starts shrieking at him

&gt; Eventually he opens the door

&gt; THAT SMELL

&gt; IT HAUNTS ME STILL

&gt; DIDN'T FLUSH

&gt; DIDN'T PULL UP PANTS

&gt; THERE WAS SHIT ON THE TOILET SEAT

&gt; Almost just left right then

&gt; I'M OUT BITCHES

&gt; But nope

&gt; Help greasemonster get Mike out of the bathroom and into her car

&gt; It's full of wrappers and pizza boxes

&gt; Finally Mike stops crying

&gt; STARTS FUCKING EATING LEFTOVER FOOD IN THE CAR

&gt; I look at greasemonster

&gt; No words

&gt; HUR HE WERS PROBABLY JURST HUNGREY

&gt; No. Fucking. WORDS.

&gt; Tell her to please not bring him back to class

&gt; This was the wrong thing to do

&gt; Greasemonster proceeds to bitch me out for discrimination

&gt; Says her son shouldn't be around negative people like me

&gt; Says my coworkers and I are assholes

&gt; Says it's not his fault he's ""big boned like his mama""

&gt; Stuffs herself into her car and drives off in a huff

&gt; Fucking Mike in the back is still eating

&gt; What the fuck

TL;DR: Greasemonster forces her disgusting pizzabeast son to go sailing, we can barely get him in a drysuit, I end up sending him home when he can't wipe himself at lunch. "	t5_2vzax	True

Guys... seriously guys! IT'S THE END!

**SATURDAY**

So Miranda and I were hanging out, ~~mowing the lawn~~ talking late at night and eventually I in my infinite smoothness say ""Hey listen, you wanna do something sometime? Like a date you know?"" As soon as these words leave my lips this becomes my internal [MFW](http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/a/image/1334/32/1334329164853.jpg), you know because I thought it sounded so stupid. But Mirandas face lights up and says ""I thought you'd never ask!"" and kisses me. After she asks ""We should do something now!"" I in my smoothness say ""Like what? It's kinda late"" After thinking for a few moments she jumps up and suggests skinny dipping in the woodland lake nearby and before I get a chance to say anything she is dragging me along with her. As we walk she holds my hand and puts her head on my shoulder, I'm thinking ""this is going great!""

We fast forward to the lake

We go to a more secluded spot as there is a camping site on one side of the lake and strip, we jump in and are having fun and we end up kissing again. That is when we hear the call of the Manatee! ""PLOGGY HOW COULD YOU! I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME!"" We in a confused state break apart and tries to go for our clothes, but she is already upon them! We stop dead in the water, trying to reason with her. She says shes calling the police on me for being a pedo, we're both 18, retard I explain, she then says shes going to call the police because I was RAPING Miranda! I, angry get out of the water to get our clothes so we can leave before the campers gather round for a sea show. I get out of the water, she makes a comment about my size. Guys really I'm average, guys come on, I swear! That was the last straw, I push her off our clothes, get them and we quickly get dressed. In the meanwhile the Manatee was calling the police saying ""there's some guy who was raping a girl and when I found them he attacked me!"" Police show up quickly, and gets we quickly explain how the Manatee has been harassing me and any girl I know. The police wants to call her father, he quickly comes down with this really embarrassed look on his face. He apologizes to me for her daughter being cray cray and to the officers for wasting their time. He then adds if that he doesn't want his daughter to go to jail so if we promise not to press the issue he would get a psychiatrists or a psychologist or whoever deals with this shit to help and move to leave us alone. Just as I'm about to agree she yells

&gt;DADDY! NO! IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME! I SWEAR! WE DON'T NEED TO MOVE AGAIN! HE DOES LOVE ME! Go ahead Ploggy! Tell him, tell him you love me and not this whore!

Miranda scoffs and snuggle into me, with my arms around her. I say ""You're fucking delusional!"" and agree with the dad, she has a mental breakdown and falls to the ground saying she'll kill herself, the police takes this very seriously and calls for an ambulance to take her to the hospital. They come to take her away but the dad does not fit and he hurries home to drive to the hospital. But before he goes he swears hes going to make her take regular counseling sessions and to tell everyone near where they move again about his daughters instability.


**SUNDAY**

I saw some moving trucks by their house loading stuff, it seems like they really are moving, didn't go talk to them though."	t5_2vzax	True
1373246732.0	1hu2rc	Righto- This one has to be said	SpiffySpacemanSpiff	1095	227	360	"Sorry in advance for the lack of green text, I'm surprised I'm computer savvy enough to type right now as
this just happened:

Preface: I am an adult male, pretty healthy, 6' and 180. I like to go longboarding. Shit, it's like the only hobby someone as busy as me can have. 

I like my longboard. To be honest, I love my longboards, but I love one in particular: I love my Hobbes deck. For those of you who enjoy the boarding culture, it's custom, gorgeous, Arbor board which, after I had the piece commissioned in 2009, I spent ages wood burning a long mural of Hobbes from the Watterson cartoon. I take this thing out like once a month because 1. it's old and 2. it's more of a work of art.

Whelp. I was doing my sunday morning ritual cruise, which entails going from williamsburg, to manhattan, down the east side parkway, around the battery, and up into riverside park. For those of you that are unfamiliar, it means I go a long ass way, in some nice sunshine, and hope to be left the fuck alone long enough to recuperate from a long-ass week. 

As I was approaching the end of my run, I got a text from a friend who said ""Spiffyspacemanspiff, wanna join up for some brunch."" Being that I wasnt too far away, I said sure, and went upon my way.

I'll mention that I'm shirtless, as it's like 99 million degrees out, and thusly m carrying my shirt in my fanny pack (So I use a fanny pack, wanna fight about it?)

I get to the restaurant, and who do I see, but not just my friend, but her annoying as fuck HP of a friend who, in addition to being gay, seems fucking unable to understand that some people fucking hate being touched all the time. 

Seriously, this HP does not get the picture, and in the past, I've made it explicit that I really hat the constant touching. BUT NO, THIS FAT FUCK CANNOT KEEP THE GREASE OUT OF HIS EARS!

So When I arrive, disgustingly sweaty, heaving manly breaths of strength and physical exertion, this flabby fuck decides that now would be a great time to ""Bring it on in for a hug.""

I know what you're thinking; ""Spiffyspacemanspiff, whats so wrong about a hug?"" 

I'l tell you: It's wrong when you have asked politely many times to not be hugged, and the fucker still does it. Oh, and one more thing, not that it really matters, but this HP is, ostensively, a male, self confessed bi-sexual, and has said, on a few times, that he'd like to fuck me. (if you're not enraged by now, try harder.)

So like fuckign fat ass clockwork, this piggly prick comes up to give me a hug, and being that I am physically exhausted, out of breath, and overall sick of his shit, I say: ""Dude, no. I'm tired of all the touching. I've asked you to stop and, you wont seem to take the hints, so please: Stop.""

He makes some piggly movement back, and for a brief moment I feel bad for potentially hurting his feelings. I shirt up, and go inside the resturant (Sunburnt Cow on the Upper West if anyone's curious) and proceed to have a hearty, and well earned brunch.

As is the typical fashion, I checked my board with the waitress, who put it in the coat closet. 

HP spends the meal giving me dirty looks, in between his double order of eggs benedict, but I dont give a fuck. I'm hungry, and pretty tired of what is basically sexual harassment. 

As we're getting the check, HP tries to get everyone to go dutch, but I say, Naw: Ive only got enough cash for my meal. No one takes offense, but HP apparently did. 

We go outside, do the good byes, and I put my deck on the ground. Gotta put on my gloves and sunglasses (Fannypack FTW).

Whelp.

Then HP decides that his 400 pound lard ass is now fit to go for a magical whirl on my pride and joy. Despite never having ridden one in his life, nor having any idea the weight limitations for such a nobel piece of pressed bamboo, this Fat Fuck decided to take a long stride, and jump on my glorious steed. 

CRACK.


Mother Fucking CRACK.

anyone wanna guess what happened? Hmm? HMM????? This fucker's moon sized weigh not only broke my board once, but TWICE, snapping both ends with wheels clean the fuck off. On closer inspection, it was such a force that the assholce actually *snapped the little plastic spindles in the wheels!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

I lost it. 

I rarely loose it, hell, my job is *not* to loose it in stressful situations.

But this fat fucking lard-pile of shit was standing across the corpse of my best friend. He tried to sheepishly grin and, when he saw the insurmountable rage in my eyes, started to say ""jesus this thing is unsafe! Good thing you werent moving when it broke.""

Guys. I want you to know I try to be a nice person. But this was inexcusable. This was dastardly. This was murder.

So I looked at his beady, already sweaty eyes, and I said to him: ""Unsafe? UN-FUCKING-SAFE? I've ridden this thing for 6 fucking years you lard ridden cunt! Who in the name of fuck do you think you are? Huh?!!"" 

The above is what I remember before I simply broke into a fife minute long barrage of the most eloquent and vicious collection of words imaginable. 

Fucker told me he'd pay to have it fixed... You cant just buy another custom. You cant replace those years.

I walked home carrying three pieces of my glorious steed from the Upper West side to brooklyn.

I'm also really sunburnt. 

I think I'm gonna cry.

1375166802.0	1jc1nf	Hamplanets and yoga pants: the first	vampire-weekday	1016	156	126	"So, I work at a high end athletic apparel store, known for yoga pants that may or may not be see through. Our women's sizes only go up to a *small* size 12, so we rarely see bigger people in our shops. When we do, they're usually either shopping for someone else, or buying head bands, yoga mats, etc. and are just as pleasant as everyone else. Unfortunately, every so often a hamplanet wanders in and makes my job hell. And so begins our story...  
&gt;&gt;working morning shift on a really busy day at the mall  

&gt;&gt;already unhappy to be there  

&gt;&gt;line for fitting rooms is huge, customers are angry  

&gt;&gt;I think I've seen the worst of retail  

&gt;&gt;WRONG  

&gt;&gt;in comes a woman that is clearly too large for our clothes, at around my height (5'3) but around 400 pounds  

&gt;&gt;whatever, she's probably just shopping for her kid or something  

&gt;&gt;head over to see what she needs  

&gt;&gt;""I WANT YOUR PANTS.""  

&gt;&gt;not sure why she's angry, but okay  

&gt;&gt;I show her to where we keep our yoga pants, ask her what size and style she wants  

&gt;&gt;""YOU ONLY HAVE UP TO A 12. WHERE ARE THE OTHER ONES?""  

&gt;&gt;""Sorry ma'am, that's the highest size we make. If you're looking for plus size athletic wear I can recommend some other stores in the mall.""  

&gt;&gt;mistake  

&gt;&gt;""Are you saying I'm too fat for these? I want THESE ones. I want to try them on. I'm sure I'll fit.""  

&gt;&gt;no chance in hell  

&gt;&gt;I start to mumble something about our sizes running small, but the look of fire in her eyes makes this seem dangerous  

At this point I just gave up and showed her to the fitting rooms, figuring that she'd try to put them on, realize it wasn't going to happen, and leave. This was a *huge* mistake.  

&gt;&gt;about 20 minutes later I feel an aggressive tapping on my shoulder  

&gt;&gt;it's Hammy, holding the pants  

&gt;&gt;the pants look sadder than the puppies in ASPCA commercials  

&gt;&gt;Hammy is upset    

&gt;&gt;""Something's wrong with these pants.""  

&gt;&gt;she holds them up. they are ripped in several places, where she clearly tried to squeeze herself in.  

&gt;&gt;""Did this happen while you were trying them on?""  

&gt;&gt;obviously, but I have to ask  

&gt;&gt;this makes Hammy furious  

&gt;&gt;""They came this way!!! Are you saying I ripped these? I told you I could fit.""  

&gt;&gt;I quickly get my manager, sensing disaster.  

&gt;&gt;Manager explains that they were definitely not ripped before she tried them on, and because she ripped them, she has to pay for them.  

&gt;&gt;Hammy flips out, refuses to pay  

&gt;&gt;""YOU CAN'T STEAL MY MONEY. IT'S YOUR FAULT THESE RIPPED. YOU DIDN'T MAKE THEM WELL.""  

&gt;&gt;Manager threatens to call mall security  

&gt;&gt;Hammy reluctantly pays for the ruined pants, muttering expletives the whole time, leaves in a huff  

&gt;&gt;half an hour later a mall cop comes in, says a woman claimed she was robbed and harassed in our store  

&gt;&gt;apparently Hammy filed a report saying that our manager called her a fat bitch and ""stole"" her money  

&gt;&gt;Hammy is now banned from our store  

I hope this didn't suck. I have plenty of stories about working here, so if you guys like this I can post more. :)

Once again, I come bearing tales of delightful Hamthraxian shenanigans. I can't even begin to describe the level of mastery of fat band puns I have witnesses in these four comment threads. I wish I could credit each and every one of you, but alas there are too many, and I am paralyzed with laughter/ time constraints. Sorry for the hiatus, we’ve both gotten bogged down with work. Also, thank you all for your concern, but just keep holding, we promise there is satisfying end to this. Ya just got to savor the calorie-laden cringe. As always, bf is /u/notbelgianbutdutch

&gt;a few people huddled around punch bowl

&gt;walk up to them, say hello

&gt;coworkers greet us and try to fill us in on what had just happened

&gt;they can only utter the creatures wretched name before the air becomes dense 

&gt;the smell, oh god the smell permeates every pore of our bodies

&gt;is this what Beijing in the summertime smells like?

&gt;stale fries, week old warm mayonnaise, undigested matter 

&gt;writing utensils roll off the cubicles, somewhere in the distance a chair snaps under the *possibility* of encountering what is current thudding for us

&gt;""do you have something to say, roomsgotrooms?"" the anger and constipation is evident in Rage Against the Vending Machine's ""asthma"" ladden voice.

&gt;they share ""teehees"" and now everyone else's main activity is fighting back the bile that is stirring in our tracheas like the loch ness monster 

Okay at this point I am angry and frustrated. Not because they were making some half-assed attempt to ""steal"" my long term, committed boyfriend (who i live with... I mean come on). That's just fucking stupid. But they're putting me and the countless hours i spent on the track giving myself shin splints in the name of health and strength, down, and acting like they are superior for being ""real women"" which i am *clearly* not. But I'm a fucking adult, and I'm riding high on willpower and Jan's constant side glances of rage/anger/poorly concealed giggling. TL;DR IMANADULT.groundcake.

&gt;Deep breath

&gt;walk away from The Cankles

&gt;see cupcakes on table, guarded by one of bf's closer office friends

&gt;go over to help myself to a sugary pile of calories

&gt;ask bro what's up

&gt;bro gives me sad look and recounts the horrors of the hours past

&gt;some sweet office drone had made enough cupcakes so that everyone could have two.

&gt;this poor broad had made decent sized, expertly frosted, delicious cupcakes and all she asked in return as a fair rationing of the goods.

&gt;fuckin' decent human being, even frosted people names on them

&gt;while everyone was appreciating the efforts of this woman, Def Lap-band was just eye-fucking the shit out of the delicate innocent pastries

&gt;nativeamericantearshed.gif

&gt;everyone takes their time with eating them, and complimenting the woman's baking

&gt;Blob Dylan just shoves the whole thing in her mouth, chews unceremoniously and pops the second one into her dump truck of a gullet

&gt;obviously demands more

&gt;baker responds she only made enough for two servings

&gt;resident office straight-talker suggests she should have eaten them slower

&gt;Mayohem is in rage mode now, and screams at the woman that they weren't good anyway, and who even MAKES cupcakes that small?!?

&gt;[mfw]( http://i.imgur.com/jbiJap2.gif) i notice the cupcakes are larger than my fist

&gt;baker is incredibly upset, and runs into bathroom

In which we stock our cupboards.

My entire house had a very busy schedule. Maggie was the busiest of all. Between reblogging pictures of John Lennon, defending her fat-kin on the message boards, and eating entire bags of goldfish crackers in cream cheese, she had barely enough time to shower, piss, and sullenly pine for John. But the one thing besides cake that could get her up was a good shopping trip. For food, obviously.  Every ~~two~~ one week we would have an empty refrigerator. Most of the pantry would be gone, and absolutely the entire breadbox laid bare. Me and John did shopping, and we'd go around to Sasha and Andy's room to ask for their lists and money. Then we'd always look each other in the eye, say a fond farewell, and walk down to Maggies room to ask for her list. 

Why would we do this? On the very first grocery run, we didn't say a word. We just snuck off and came back with food. Maggie got so offended and asked why we didn't tell her. We said we assumed she would go fend for herself. ""Without a car?!?!"" The store was, again, a bit of a walk. But for one girl and *one persons worth of grocery* we assumed she'd figure it out. We only took John's truck because we were hauling food for four. We laughed her off, and left to enjoy our lives. We came back to a massacred kitchen, and a sloppily dressed Maggie grinning, telling us she was ""ready to go to the store"". We started telling her we didn't need to go, but then we check the cupboards. Not a single item of food besides the brown rice we'd bought. John forced every cent out of her, BEFORE we went shopping with her. 

To avoid pointless double shopping, she was now included on runs. The most memorable one was sometime in late August. We piled into the truck, and after  Maggie squeezed into the back, she announced she was going to shop with more care. 

""What does that mean, Maggie?""

""I'm going to start reading the labels now. I'm worried I'm eating too much iron. I just, I looked up the symptoms and I think that's what's making me gain so much weight recently.""

""Iron? Does carrot cake have a lot of iron?"" John ruminated, ""no wait, wait, it's in the cream cheese frosting, you're right.""

Maggie didn't speak for the rest of the ride. We got to the store, and got two carts: one for the groceries for four of us, and one for Maggie's haul. We could have easily split up and done the shopping separately, but Maggie would tag along with us, complaining about the people, the air conditioning, and of course, our food choices. 

John and I hit the produce aisle first, while Maggie went to conquer the processed meat case. Mountains of hot dogs, bacon, ham with a plastic-like consistency. It was hard to understand how she could eat all of that and not rupture her colon. After she started following us around, John and I flipped over our grocery lists, and started playing Maggie Grocery Store Lingo Bingo (obviously John's idea). Every time Maggie finds a food "" ""absolutely ridiculous"", comments on the size of a customer, put a item of food in the cart that was at least 50% sugar, told us our food choice was stupid/unhealthy, or the king move of picking up magazines and describing how they were the downfall of America and realistic body image, we'd smile and mark it down. To give you an idea of how easy that game was, here are the things Maggie found ""absolutely ridiculously"":

1. Skim/Reduced Fat milk

2. *Light* versions of ice, whipped and sour cream (""It's CREAM?!?)

3. Whole grain, 9 Grain, Sunflower Seed, Rye or Non-White Bread

4. Tofu

5. Olive oil

6.""Diet"" drinks

7. Baby vegetables (""Do they think making them cuter will make me eat them? Goddamn big corporations messing with genetics!!!"")

There was more, but that's all I wrote down on the ""bingo"" sheet. We move around the supermarket, watching Maggie conquer the aisles of chips, cookies, and processed breads. There is one, exactly one pack of entenmann's cinnamon buns. I personally dislike them, because they taste like sponge cake frosted in glue, but Maggie LOVES them. She can eat three and call it ""a bite to eat"". Sometimes she'll eat a whole box, for a ""light dessert"". They're up on a higher shelf, and there is a little kid trying to reach them. Maggie gets there, looks at the kid, looks at the box, looks around, drops her gaze and grabs the box. The child starts saying thank you, reaching his arms up to accept the treat he was trying to reach. Maggie looks at him for two seconds, and throws it in her cart. 

We stare at her. ""Maggie?""

""Yeah, guys?""

""I think the little dude was trying to get those.""

""Well, I got them first. And I need them more. These are my FAVORITE""

The little kid looks  at Maggie with eyes that could stop a mugging. I can see tears in the corners, and know this little kid will cry. In fairness, so will Maggie, but I want the little kid to be happier anyway. John and I glance at each other, then John steps toward the now cart-pushing Maggie.

""Hey, Mags?"" he says sweetly. She almost drops to her knees and starts blowing him right there. She LOVES when he uses a nickname. He started walking slowly away from her, dropping his voice so she'd follow him. As soon as she got away from her cart, I grabbed the cinnamon rolls, threw them to the little kid, and told him to run like hell. He did, just as Maggie's jowls began to vibrate. I was worried for a second that her cries would alert an army of motorized planets, but no, he leapt away. Maggie called us ""animals"". For preventing the theft of dessert from a child. Okay Maggie. 

Maggie stopped to pick up at least five liters of Dr. Pepper, when she noticed someone had left an US Weekly on the shelf near the sodas. On the cover was some blonde celebrity with the stereotypical ""Magical Weight Loss Transformation"". Magic? Or jogging? Who knows! Maggie sure does it. She turns to us, and frowns. 

""I bet she looks just as big as me or you, WakeUpMaggie. They just use computer equipment to trim her down. This is ridiculous, full bodies need to be on *display* more."" She stops to yank up her leggings, valiant black spandex falling down from the effort of encasing her ""full body"". She tosses the magazine on the floor, and tries to leave. John stands in front of her cart, holding it and says ""pick it up"". 

""I CAN'T!""

""Then you shouldn't have thrown it, Maggie. Now POWER SQUAT"" John proceeds to holler ""POWER SQUAT"" until she wibble-wobbles her way down to the floor to get the magazine.

We continue on, and approach the deli counter. There is a woman, maybe 30, 35 waiting for an order. She's pretty fit and toned, tall, and very attractive. John immediately zeros in, and gives me the sign, he's going in for some good old fashioned flirting. I know my role is to keep Maggie away. I ask her if she'd grab a box of matches from the aisle opposite the counter. Maggie almost agrees before she realizes she's nowhere near that amount of helpful. Instead, she shoots John a look, sees the woman, and sets her thighs on a course for the counter. When she got mad, she would stomp her feet, but because she waddled, the movement looked kind of like a baby elephant trying to avoid a mud puddle. The woman turns around, looks Maggie in the eye, and can't stop her face from making a grimace. She tries to move out of range of the flying hippo, but is too stunned by the look of hatred on a stranger's face. 

""HEY. HEY, ARE YOU DONE ORDERING?"" Oh, thank god. It wasn't John, Maggie was after the meats &amp; cheeses behind the glass. Oh thank go-

""BECAUSE IF YOU COULD MOVE YOUR WHORE ASS OUT OF THIS SPACE, AND STOP BOTHERING RANDOM MEN, THAT WOULD BE GREAT""

The woman shakes her head in confusion, and then starts to say something when Maggie can't help but cut her off again.

""THIS GUY ISN'T INTERESTED IN PAYING FOR SEX, MOVE ON, THANK YOU, BUH-BYE."" Maggie flips her hand up in the woman's face.

The woman turns red, sticks her hand out in front of Maggie, giving John her phone number. Maggie looks down, sees the paper, and turns to yell at the woman, who is already gone. Maggie attempts to stop after, and then falls into a cracker display on the floor. Boxes and boxes of crackers go flying as she hits the floor with a huge THUMP. She's screaming hysterically, kicking on the floor as her leggings start slipping off her folds. Neither John or I could help her because we were in tears. Maggie was asked to pay for her things and leave, as quick as possible. The two of us finished our shopping in piece, and abandoned our Maggie Bingo sheets, assuming we were both winners."	t5_2vzax	True

Many moons ago, in the days when the Supersize menu still shone like bacon...err—a *beacon* of hope, I found myself in an internship I had never dreamed I would one day have. Of course, this was not because of the prestige that went along with it, but rather due to it being absolutely nothing like what I imagined it would be.   
  

  

In the third year of my bachelor’s degree in linguistics I fell upon hard times financially. Since I was jobless and had been funding myself through grants and scholarships thus far, I had to venture into the proverbial deep-end to find a job—lest I find myself behind the counter of a gas station again. As I had vowed to myself to never let such a fate befall me ever again, I tried alternate means. This, of course boiled down to me eventually guilt-tripping a professor friend of mine to help me get an internship.

My search finally ended when I got accepted at the local job center in my university’s city. For those of you who do not know, a job center is essentially at its most basic level, a place where jobless and often uneducated or disabled folks go to seek employment opportunities through the state—think a government sponsored temp agency.

As an intern, my job was simple—or so they said. I would call out the next name on the sign-in list we had, call them back into my make-shift ‘office,’ and interview them to see if they qualified for any work programs or job opportunities we currently had available.

This interview process was ultimately a series of yes/no questions and questions regarding their job history and skill (or lack thereof) in certain areas. Also on this list were questions regarding their physical abilities and disabilities (I’m sure you can see where this is going). 

Of course, being the not-so-jaded younger me that I was, I figured this would be a walk in the park—I mean getting paid to ask questions…what could go wrong? Right?

**Wrong.**

I found out quickly that there was a very real and valid reason they gave the intern this job—and it wasn’t because it was the ‘simplest’ job, as they had advertised it to me on my first day. And, after the first few that I was walked through by a coworker, I was on my own.

At this point, I will apologize for the length of the introduction—but I felt without proper context that these stories would largely lose their weight.

However, I will further preface this with a rough estimation of my being at this point in my life. During my time at the center I was on my university’s track team and was working out 6~ days a week, and was visibly ‘in-shape’ (6’0’’, ~185lbs). 

Of the literal thousands of people that I interviewed there during my 2 ½ year tenure at the center, only a few stick out in my memory—these are their tales.



It was a cool September day, the type of day that sucks energy out of you faster than a double-wide straw on a fatty’s cola. I had overslept and thus missed class that morning, so being the studious me that I was I showed up at work a few hours early—little did I know the landmine I had just stepped on as I opened the doors and stepped inside.

I took my things to my ‘office,’ and went about setting up for the day. Some ten or so minutes later, I went up front to call my first ‘client’ back for the day. A short man who had fallen on hard times when the factory he worked at his entire life had fallen under—a sad story, but business as usual.

After clearing a few more people through my queue, I went back for the last one I would take before I planned on taking my lunch break (It was almost noon by this point). As I peered down at the list of names, my peripheral vision alerted me to a mass of flesh gyrating off to the far left of the waiting room. My eyes, as if mesmerized by the waves of the sirens of lore, were drawn to (what I would soon find out was a) her. She was sitting with her bottom strewn across the groaning supports of 3 fold out chairs—a feat which I had never seen accomplished before this.

Now we, like any other social service, see all types of people—slim, fat, tall, short, black, white, etc., etc. But, this was different—I had never seen such a monster with my own eyes. After a few seconds, I managed to return my focus to the paper in front of me and stared at the name whilst whispering a silent prayer that she wasn’t the person I was about to call.

Many times, like any other time strangers are forced to pronounce another stranger’s name from a sheet, I butchered names. Normally, I would just laugh it off with the person and it wouldn’t matter—this time was different.

“Sorry, I’m probably going to butcher this but, Shady-nasty.” (I tried my best to pronounce it, but honestly I’m bad with ‘modern’ names). 

“BOY YUH BEH TRIPPUN’ IT’S SHA-DYNASTY (highly different split in word order).”

I realized at this point what I had said, due to the distraction of her size I had managed to not only mispronounce her name, but totally masticate it in the process—she wasn’t impressed. However, the rest of the room exploded in stifled laughter and hysterics.

The lumbering beast raised her mass with what can only be described as a mastery of the principles of physics, propulsion and inertia. The cheaply made fold-chairs were cast to the ground like fallen soldiers in her wake, and with extremely labored breathing she made her way towards me. 

After what seemed like an eternity, she finally found herself upon the threshold of my pseudo-office.

“YUR DOOR SIZE AIN’T UP TUH CODE, I’M DISABLED AN NEED BIG DOORS, I THOUGHT DIS WUZ A GOVERNMENT BUILDIN.”

“Well mam, I have no control over the door size, but if you can’t fit we can always do the interview back out in the lobby…”

Her beady eyes burned with the heat of a thousand McDonald’s deep-fryers as she spat out, “YUH SAYIN I’M FAT!?”

“No, I was just attempting to accommodate your special needs, here at the job center we attempt to make it useful and accessible to everyone.”

Instantly relief washed over what I still to this day assume was her face, “OH, GUD—BUT I CAN FIT!”

Crisis averted—or so I thought. She proceeded to ram herself sideways through the doorway; I could feel the pressure in the room changing as her fat sealed a vacuum with the walls—breathing was getting harder.

Finally, she managed to leverage herself through and cast her entire weight upon MY chair—I watched in horror as she contorted her fat more impressively than the contortions of the Cirque du Soleil people. 

Oh well—I took the seat designated for her, and took out my clipboard. But before I had even had a chance to look up she had already opened the black hole storage system of her purse and dumped out a half-eaten bucket of KFC onto her lap (I wish I were kidding). 

I politely cleared my throat and said, “Um mam….could you please refrain from eating during the interview…it won’t take but 10-15 minutes at most.”

Beetus meltdown in T-minus 3……….2………….1

“YUH SKINNEH PEOPLE ER ALL DUH SAME! I GOT NEEDS YUH KNO, IT’S MUH DISABILITY” she howled.

At this point, I was getting rather hungry myself (it was well past noon by now) and I could tell this was going nowhere fast, so I decided to go on the offensive.

“Well, if you really are disabled then that severely limits the possibility of us being able to place you in a job—and as you don’t have a visible handicap may I see your doctor’s verification of your disability please?” 

We had had so many people attempt to scam us by saying they were ‘disabled’ and then demand the easy ‘handicapped accessible’ jobs (which we had VERY few slots for) so they didn’t have to do real work that we required a signed document from a doctor verifying their ‘disability.’

Needless to say, Shadynasty had no such paper, and I had been banking on this.

“YUH CAN SEE MURH DISABILITY THOUGH!” she moaned, between bites of KFC drumstick. 

This is what I had been waiting for.

“I’m sorry, I really can’t” I said as I was fighting back the urge to grin impishly, “Unless of course you are trying to make the case that your size **is** your disability, mam.”

Her face immediately contorted into an expression that I could only infer meant the two remaining neurons in her beetus addled brain were desperately attempting to find one another to create a cohesive thought. 

They failed.

“MUH SIZE AIN’T NO DISABILITY, I’M A REEL WOMYNZ—YUH ER JUST TOO DUMB TO APPRECIATE MUH VOLUTUOUSNESS,” she spit at me with an air of utter triumph—she thought she had told me.

“Well you are a real woman, but you also just admitted your size isn’t a handicap—thus I can only offer you a few physical jobs that we have openings for at the moment. I would be more than happy to recommend you to any of them,” I said as calmly as I could.

“NO, I CAN’T WORK MUH DISABILITY I CANT SIT HURTS LEGS YUH ANOREXIC FAT SHAMER!” (of course this line of obscenities went on much longer, but I’ll spare you all the misery of trying to make sense out of her inane ramblings). 

At this point, she had gotten up and was shaking a chicken wing at me like a flail and was threatening me to give her a disabled job.

“IF YUH DUN’T RECOMMEND MEH, I GOT FRIENDS WHO WILL KILL UR ANOREXIC ASS, YOU BETTER NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT I GOT PEOPLE!” she howled, in the true song of her people.

Finally, a chance to use the panic button—I had been waiting for so long. The office has a button under the desk that allows you to call in the police security officers from the front of the building where the metal detector is. As this is a government facility offering help to many unstable people, the guards take their job seriously.

As I pressed the button, a rush of satisfaction washed over my being…I now knew what it must have felt like to launch a nuclear warhead.

“DON’T YUH TURN UR BACK ON MEH, I’M TALKIN TO UR DUMBASS, YOU STUP—“

Two guards had bust in and one had tackled her before she (or I) even knew what was happening. To this day, I have never seen such a beautiful sight pass before my eyes. In almost real-life slow-motion her many layers of jiggle and girth wrapped around the officer as he drove her frame to the ground with strength Hercules himself would have ‘mired. Perhaps the best part was the chicken—as she was flying towards the ground, her bucket of chicken and its contents were flying around the room as if they no longer had weight now that they had escaped her gravitational field.

As she fought and wriggled on the ground, like a bloated earth worm about to be squished the officer put her in handcuffs and arrested her on the spot and walked her out of the room as I thanked them for helping me.

As I went about tiding up the ‘office,’ I noticed that it was only half past noon—I still had 30 minutes for lunch left. So I got in my car and headed towards the KFC down the road—I had worked up quite the appetite for some of the Colonel’s finest.



Once again, sorry about the length—but I really wanted to get the full girth of the story across. I hope you enjoyed the read and I will be putting a few of my other experiences up in the days to come!

**TL;DR – The Colonel’s finest original recipe chicken reaches escape velocity when landwhale is taken down after becoming enraged that she was outsmarted by an “anorexic” man.**

I don't know what I did to deserve it, but thank you! I'm trying to post a story every day this week because I need to get in the habit of sitting down and writing even when I don't feel like it. Hopefully writing these out will help me get my butt in gear when it comes to essay writing time.

This story is from my grocery store days, and after my encounter with [the cheeseplanets](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1di0h8/my_first_experience_with_hamlogic/) I thought I had seen all fatlogic possible with them, but no, I was clearly young and very naïve to think that.

Be me, 17, stuck working on a lovely sunny Saturday while all my friends are at the beach. I'm sulking a bit behind a display near the registers when I feel a disturbance in the force; I smell said disturbance before I see it. I turn to see a profusely sweating hamplanet (about 5'5”, at least 300 lbs) leaning against the service counter, trying to catch her breath from the strenuous walk from her car to just inside the front of our store. Let's call her Porkcilla. When she has caught her breath, I notice she is still leaning against the counter, so I make myself visible and ask her if she needs any help.

Porkcilla: “YEAH, I need one of yer electric carts fer doin muh shopping.”

Me: “I'm sorry, both of our electric carts are in use right now. If you would like, I can grab you a chair so you can sit down until a cart becomes available.”

P: “I need a cart RIGHT NOW, I dun have time to sit around all day, I have things to do!”

Me: “Ma'am, I'm very sorry, but there isn't anything I can do. Other customers are using the carts right now.”

P: “I want to speak to a manager!”

I give out a low sigh and go hunt down a manager. I could have paged one, but I wanted to give a warning before one of them got up front and had to deal with Porkcilla. I find a manager and tell him what is going on, and he just shakes his head a bit and heads up front. Let me take a second to tell you that one electric cart was taken by an old man who I had overheard telling a couple of my coworkers he just had hip replacement surgery, and the other was taken by a young (25-year-old) ex-army guy who had ¾ of his left leg blown off in Afghanistan and is permanently on crutches. Guess which one Porkcilla saw first. That's right, army guy (who we're going to call AG because I unfortunately can't think of a cool name for him). Now, AG is a super nice guy who has been shopping in our store for about 6 months as that is how long he has been discharged from the army. He is always in a good mood, super polite, and never gives anyone any crap even if they are rude to him. Back to the story.

Manager (M for short) gets up front and asks Porkcilla what he can do for her. She states what has already been stated, but also adds that I was very rude to her. M gives me a “dafuq is she on?” look and I just shake my head. M asks how exactly I was rude, and Porkcilla says that I refused to get an electric cart for her.

M: “Ma'am, None4GretchenWieners can't give you a cart if they're both in use. She can't just go kick someone off a cart so someone else can use it.”

P: “But I have bad knees! I need to sit down while I shop acuz it's hard for me walk through such a big store!”

AG, who is now up front and using one of the self-checkout terminals, pipes up, “Ma'am, I am almost done, you can have this cart once I get my groceries to the car.”

Porkcilla flips out when she sees that a young person is using her precious precious shopping scooter. She goes on and on about how he doesn't need it, and how he's just “some young little shit” that could walk, but is refusing to, etc. AG just sits there ringing up the rest of his groceries and looking amused while this bitch is calling him all sorts of names and cursing at him. After AG is done paying for his food, he drives the cart over to an old man that just walked into the store (who is hunched over and using a cane), gets up, and lets the old man on the cart. Porkcilla has been rendered speechless by the sight of AG having only one leg and using crutches to walk. AG goes back to grab his bags, but I stop him and tell him I will take the bags for him. I am loading his bags up on my arms when we hear a loud “Go away you fat cunt!”

We turn and see Porkcilla trying to get on the cart with the old man STILL SITTING ON IT. He's using his cane to keep her from completely squishing him. Porkcilla is very red in the face and says “I need to do my shopping!”

The old man says “Then start walking! Lord knows you could use the exercise.”

What happened next is really, truly unbelievable. If the part where she tried to sit on him seemed like a stretch, I warn you, this is even worse. I had to check the cameras the next day to make sure this actually happened. Hell, I watched the tape ten times to make sure it wasn't a dream. Porkcilla took hold of the metal basket on the front of the cart and began trying to tip it to one side so that the old man would fall off. The old man grips the side of the seat with one hand and uses his cane to jab Porkcilla in the knee. AG and I are just standing there, in a state of complete shock, staring. Porkcilla howls in pain and lets go of the cart. Old man takes this opportunity to drive as far away from Porkcilla as the cart will take him. Porkcilla is standing there howling and I snap out of my daze, nudge AG, and motion towards the door. I get his groceries out to the car where his sister is waiting for him (AG didn't want help with his everyday activities because he still wanted to be independent as much as he could). We must look like we've seen some shit, because she asks, “What's wrong?” Neither of us can answer though, we just shake our heads, I get the groceries in the trunk, give AG a hollow “See you later bro”, and go back inside where Porkcilla is on the phone with the police. I don't know what ever happened with that, but obviously the old man never got in any trouble as I still saw him in the store from time to time.

TL;DR Army vets and old people are awesome, hamplanets are not.

&gt;I drove to her house and drove her to Beetus Hut

&gt;we go inside and sit down

&gt;I explain to her that we are splitting the bill

&gt;she agrees

&gt;says: ""Don't worry DMF, I'm only gettin' something basic.""

&gt;ok

&gt;orders food, I order a veggie pizza with no cheese

(See my flair for why.)

&gt;I actually like veggie pizza, not for the fake 'health value'

&gt;Be StormChaserRetard.

&gt;Living in suburb of very large city.

&gt;Frequent this nice dive bar-esque place.

&gt;Food is quite dece (place is owned by the chef), so people come to munch as well as drink.  

&gt;Waste a fair amount of time and money here, so know who the ""regulars"" are.

&gt;Be a random Friday evening, late enough for most people to be boozed up, but still early enough for it not to feel late, and i'm chowing down on some tasty vittles with some buds.

&gt;Group of five dudes walk in.  Pay no attention to them except that they are dressed in athletic gear of some kind like they came from rec league of some sport or something, and two of them are next level fat.

&gt;My guess is the smaller of the two, sixfootfat, is somewhere around 300 at around 6'4, and the other guy is some gross looking orca thing at around 5'7 and 350.   He is dressed in the biggest nike shorts I have ever seen (go down past his knees and look like a dress), a hoody, and a backward ballcap.

&gt;Looking at him is enough to inspire confusion and rage.

&gt;Call this creature Globulus Prime. He appears to know doorman.

&gt;Time passes.  Their food arrives.  The three normal dudes get biggish but regular orders. Fourth dude gets similar amount. But Globulus. . .

&gt;Globulus gets an order of thai nachos that feed three, and a burger and fries, AND sweet potato fries, and a coke to go along with his beer.

&gt;Hours pass.  I am quite inebriated.  So is everyone else. Especially table of dudes, who have loaded up on beer.
  
&gt;Sixfootfat is verging on being asleep.  Globulus Prime is totally hammered and being very loud, and has started to aggressively hit on the waitress. Rest of the bros all somewhere in between those two.


&gt;Turn to face sudden noise.

&gt;Globulus and regular, let's call him The Bean Machine, staring at each other.

&gt;TBM is a blond guy, about 5'11, and he is wearing one of those stupid anime shirts that is far, far too large.  Makes him look waif like. Combine this with pale skin and a bad choice of glasses frames, and he looks like a stereotypical geek minus ginger hair and freckles. He is in his late 20s.

&gt;GP and TBM getting into it now.  I am like fifteen feet away so can hear everything.

&gt;Turns out TBM was sitting at bar eating chicken wings and GP just came over and helped himself to some.

&gt;TBM flips out, says what the fuck. GP responds something to the effect of ""you weren't going to eat them anyway you skinny fuck."" Alphadouchefatlogic.

&gt;TBM responds with tirade of swearing.

&gt;GP justifies actions by saying TBM doesn't need the calories, since the gay community is all about skinny. ""Go scarf down a salad you faggot. Leave real food for real men.""

&gt;Further accusations that The Bean Machine's lack of ~~fatness~~ size means that he is gay, and therefore an inferior human being, etc.  Lots of smacktalk about yoga and other ""gay"" sports.

&gt;Continue beaking each other.  Both getting angrier and angrier.  GP makes reference to the fact that he is more muscular (more like corpuscular) and is this close to beating the shit out of ""his skinny ass.""

&gt;Doorman comes over.  Tells GP and TBM to cool it.  They call each other one last round of names and then TBM turns back to the bar and bartender promises him free chicken wings.

&gt;GP is back down at his table, and fuming.  Talking to his buddies about what a piece of shit TBM is for making fun of his weight (lolwut? you implied he was skinny and therefore ""a yoga dancing faggot"").  

&gt;Paying close attention now, since while big talk happens at bars, this is very irregular for this place. Would not come here otherwise.

&gt;Makeup order of TBMs chickenwings arrive.

&gt;All five get up, go over, and grab the basket of wings right off the bar in front of his face.

&gt;TBM has had enough.  He slaps the chicken wing basket up into GPs face.

&gt;Doorman looks very concerned.

&gt;Begins to walk over.

&gt;GP, now covered in hotsauce, grabs TBMs shirt, and mashes him in the face, totally destroying his glasses, tearing his shirt, and  causing him to fall off of his stool and onto the floor.

&gt;Everyone, including GP's buddies, are stunned.

&gt;Doorman is panicking.

&gt;TBMs shirt is totally destroyed.  Underneath it, it is clear that he is not, in fact, as scrawny as initially thought.

&gt;No, kind of the opposite.

&gt;I haven't been completely honest with you about TBM.

&gt;TBM does not really stand for The Bean Machine.

&gt;Doorman is panicking because his friend is about to get his fucking ass kicked.

&gt;TBM is The Boogey Man.


&gt;TBM picks himself up.  

&gt;He is so angry he is sputtering.  

&gt;His face is beet red and it looks like he already has a black eye.  Doorman gets in the way and puts his hands on his chest.  TBM grabs his shoulders and moves him out of the way in a fashion that is calculated not to send him careening into a table but to GTFO so he can begin to claim souls. 

&gt;GP throws another punch, catches TBM straight in the cheek.  

&gt;Does not seem to have any effect.

&gt;TBM then reaches over behind the GPs head, cool as you like, and all of a sudden GPs head is catapulted forwards towards TBM like the framerate in real life skipped.  He headbutts him so hard he knocks him out standing up.

&gt;TBM is now covered in (someone else's) blood and has shirt torn to shreds. Looks like modern day conan.

&gt;Melee breaks out.

&gt;Sixfootfat then throws a few punches.  TBM grabs his ear to haul his head down into punching range (all the while he is being punched from all directions btw), and throws a single punch into Sixfootfat's cheek.

&gt;Sixfootfat is not knocked unconscious, but it is clear from his reaction that he is happy to end the fight there, and that he doesn't need that tough guy stuff anyway, and he howls in pain and hops off in the other direction holding his face.

&gt;The Boogeyman then two hands one of the other guys so hard he sails through the air, and it dawns on the other two that their death is impending since they start to back up and keep their hands up.

&gt;All of this has taken under 15 seconds. And now the doorman has got back up and they break up the fight.  They basically pile on TBM and restrain him until he has calmed down.  It takes the four of them tremendous effort.

&gt;The cops arrive about 2 minutes later, and though I have no idea what happened since I didn't stay to see the resolution (everyone's meals were free), I saw TBM there a week later watching hockey and sporting some nice shiners.

TL;DR: It is not a good idea to steal peoples chicken wings, because even if you get away with it nine out of ten times, there is going to be that guy who LOOKS like a pushover, but is actually related to The Terminator."	t5_2vzax	True

[Pt.6](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1izk9n/my_year_with_ginger_pt_6_one_leaves_the_nest/)

Soon after spring semester began, (shocker!) Luke and I broke up for the fourth and final time. He'd become more and more controlling in the last few weeks, coming into our house unannounced when I didn't answer his calls right away, checking my phone calls and text messages, and threatening Eric to leave me alone when Yuri moved out. When I ended it with him, Luke naturally assumed it was just going to be a short break. A few weeks went by, and he realizes that I didn't want to get back together with him. He tried chocolate (Ginger ate those), Chinese takeout (Ginger ate those), and sweet talking. When that didn't work, Luke resorted to having his friends spy on me while I was at school and calling me a slut and a cheater. My, did my heart beat in want when he called me a two-timing whore! Yuri and I were still pretty frosty then, so he tried to score some brownie points by challenging Luke to a fight to defend my honor. I had to talk him out of it.

Ginger's birthday is in January, so she asked Eric and I for permission to throw herself a party. She said it in a way that implied she was going to have the party no matter what we said, but fine. Ginger could celebrate her birth, as long as it ended before 2am and that she cleaned up after everyone had left. We particularly stressed the last part. Ginger asked us to join in on the fun- and contribute towards food, as if either one of us had the money to feed Ginger's appetite- but Eric and I had no plans to join in the festivities. He had work, and I was gonna stay the night at a friend's.

I had a major economics research paper that was due the Monday after Ginger's party (the party was on a Saturday). I'd been working on it for weeks and carried it around on a mini portable hard drive in my book bag since I mostly worked on it at the school library. I was going to finish it before I went off to my friend's house, but that Saturday morning the hard drive had vanished from my book bag. I proceed to panic and search all through my room and the house. Nothing. I didn't suspect any wrongdoing yet. A lot of people warned me about carrying my schoolwork on portable hard drives, and I always dismissed them. I just accepted that I'd misplaced it, in school, the library, at work, or something. The paper was almost done on my hard drive, but I had a copy that was about 60% done on my home computer. If I stayed awake the whole weekend, I could still finish it. So I called up my friend to let her know I wasn't going to make it, brewed a pot of coffee, and started working.

Five hours later, Ginger's party began. Ginger's friends were... interesting. Anime freaks and Twilight fan girls with some normal people mixed in. Part of the reason why I didn't mind Ginger having a party was that I didn't think a party with her kind of crowd was going to get rowdy. Yeah, I was wrong. Ginger just turned nineteen, but she got some of her older friends to bring the booze. Ginger looked so happy to be the center of attention.  And guess who was also invited? My ex and his friends. I went downstairs once to refill my coffee, and noticed them. Luke tried to talk to me, but I was able to avoid him.

About 12am, there was a knock on my door. Party's still going on, my head is getting fuzzy from staring at a computer screen for so long but I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I was about to yell at whoever it was to come in, but Ginger just pops in, smiling like a creepy Cheshire cat.

&gt;""Lulu, I know that you and Luke just broke up but he's been flirting with me since he came in!""

Doubtful, but okay? I'm wondering what any of that has to do with me. Does Ginger feel like she has to adhere to the rules of girl code or something and ask for my permission. Yeah, okay Luke. You two deserve each other. I mumble something about not caring, not looking away from my screen, so Ginger goes with another method.

&gt;""He is so sweet and cute and I don't know why you would ever break up with him, Lulu!""

Typing and refraining from mentioning how he's a slut-shaming, controlling, bastard.

&gt;""I guess you just couldn't keep him since you've wasted away since school started and now he's looking for something real. If he hadn't met you first, we probably would have dated. He's been checking out my CURVES behind your back for months ^tee ^hee.""

I'm still calm, more tired than annoyed. Ginger got bored of my lack of response, so she waddles out of my bedroom. I finish at around 1am and promptly fall asleep.

I wake up Sunday to chaos. I have a bunch of missed calls and text messages on my phone, most of them from my parents and old friends from high school. They all basically said the same thing: CHECK YOUR FACEBOOK. I'm not so sleepy anymore when I see what they mean. Luke, or someone who'd used Luke's facebook page had posted an intimate picture of me and a shirtless torso lying on a bed. No one's actually fully naked, but who cares? My Evangelical Christian parents, their friends, and everyone I knew in high school just saw a picture of me in bed with a boy. I ran out of my bedroom, ready to murder Luke, and goddamn. The whole house is a mess. Ginger didn't fucking clean anything. There was a bunch of trash on the floor, stains on the wall, what the hell?

I had a choice to make. Go after Ginger, or go after Luke. I decide to go next door first. No answer. I bang on the door and nothing. So I go back home and run up to Ginger's room. What do I find there? Not Ginger's virginity. Because Luke was right there in Ginger's bed, buck naked. In case anyone is wondering, Ginger was the big spoon.

I scream bloody murder, and my mind only comes up with one word.

&gt;""HER!?!""

Luke looks embarrassed, regretful, and still drunk. Ginger just seems smug, and is casually naked. Freckles everywhere. It's an image I can't quite get rid of. Yes, I now know that the curtains match the drapes.

&gt;""Lulu, don't be mad at me 'cause you can't keep your man.""

I can't handle this shit. At that moment, I seriously felt like I was about to have a mental breakdown. It was all too much, and only on about four hours of sleep. I felt like I was going to cry. Or vomit. Or both.

Eric must have been woken up by me yelling. I didn't even notice him standing behind me until he walked past me and started throwing Luke's clothes at him, saying, ""Dude, get the fuck out of here."" Ginger started protesting.

&gt;""Eric, don't be jealous because Luke got me before you could!""

Luke, looking slightly green, leaves. Eric rounds on Ginger next, tells her to get the fuck up and start cleaning. Ginger complains that she's sick and can't get up. Averting his eyes from the two freckly mounds of milkbags on her chest, Eric demands that she pick up after her guests or that he'll call her parents and tell her what happened. Still complaining, Ginger gets up. No modesty in dressing in front of me and Eric. While she's getting dressed, she takes something out of her jewelry box and throws it at my feet. It's my portable hard drive.

&gt;""Too bad you were too busy to join the party.""

I'll end that part right here. I don't know if I made everything clear enough, so yes, Ginger did steal my hard drive. And though I hadn't found out yet, she'd looked through Luke's phone when he'd passed out after their romp, found the private picture of us together, and posted it on his Facebook.

1375725590.0	1jr4xc	Thin Privilege is not sustaining an eating-related injury	Biriuk	1048	230	75	"So there I was, a wee lad of 16, celebrating the birth of 'Murica with our most honored of traditions: a neighborhood feast. This wasn't just any feast, however. This was a barbeque like none other. The old ladies who lived nearby were pulled pork savants, and they only knew how to cook entirely too much food. One of them joked that she never cooked normally because she only knew how to cook for an army. It turns out, for those of you who struggle with HAES units, one army is the equivalent of one hamplanet(1 Army = 100 Men = 1 HP). The conversion was easy enough so we'll refer to this as the Fatric System.

So there I was, veins full of American pride, stomach full of American cheeseburgers. My friends and I were sitting in the cool, damp evening grass, waiting for fireworks and talking about video games. Recalling this moment even now brings back a rush of nostalgia. Right as we were launching into a discussion about why Halo 2 was the best game ever, the fireworks began.


BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! I looked up for the source of the noise, but something was wrong. Where were the fireworks? I had heard them, I was sure.


BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Does anyone else hear this? I looked at my friends, whose eyes were wide with fear. Oh God, the Russians are attacking. It's Cold War II! I stood up and turned around, ready to kick some Commie ass, or at the very least face my death like a true Murican.

My first thought when I turned around was ""oh that's why I couldn't see the fireworks."" Even with my 16 year old understanding of physics, I knew light couldn't escape a strong enough gravitational pull. My second thought was ""holy shit she's eating all the barbecue."" 


""Hi guysh,"" it mumbled through a mouth of food. ""Whatsh umph?"" 
We all mumbled vague greetings. 
She gulped. ""Can I join you?"" As fellow marine biologists, you will no doubt know that this wasn't really a request.


""It's a free country,"" I shrugged. Because America. My not quite so patriotic friends were not amused. 


""Thanksh,"" she said, mouth full again. ""My feets are killing me.""
She plopped down and there was another BANG. My eyes narrowed as I realized I'd been tricked. There never were any fireworks. Disappointed, I turned to the beast.


""That sure is, uh, sure is a lot of barbecue,"" I said.


""Yesh but they said to take as much as I wanted because they didn't want leftovers tee hee.""


No one expects the fatness imposition!


""Plus barbecue is really healthy because it has so much protein. Protein builds muscle.""


""Wow! You must be reallllly strong,"" my friend said sarcastically. The snark was lost on the girl. I was having a hard time containing my laughter, and what happened next was too much.


""My mom says that's why boys don't try to date me, because they're intimi-"" She had interrupted herself with a bite of barbecue. However, her freakish, protein fueled strength had left her unable to control her jaws. I heard a very audible crunch as she chewed. After a few seconds she swallowed and it was then that I saw her fork.


Let me interject into the narrative here: we were using little plastic forks here, as you do at cookouts. These things are cheap and hands down the best way to serve dozens of people food. They also can break, and as with most plastics, tend to break into the most dagger like shape possible. You can see where this is going.


Following my gaze, the girl noticed that she had just bitten her fork in half. It took her a second or so longer to register the pain.
In her haste to devour a Fatric Fuckton of barbecue, the girl had accidentally given herself a shiny new tongue piercing. Holding her mouth, the girl labored to her feet and waddled off into the night, presumably to seek medical attention. 


Her barbecue sat forgotten in the grass and the fireworks began, for real this time. I shed an American tear and Enjoyed my night.

Her name was Lardantuan, and this was our first encounter.



TL;DR: There once was a woman from York

Who had a great weakness for pork

She loved BBQ

1373832820.0	1iakhl	Jolly Roommate: The Carrot Revelations	NotableNobody	1005	194	132	"I mentioned my roommate quite some time ago in ""Who Drinks Water?"", and made it perfectly clear that he's not a bad guy. He was raised in an impoverished reservation, and pretty much grew up eating only processed food. Drinks a bit too much, eats mostly pizza and microwave burritos, but eats his own food and doesn't throw his weight around. Even admits that he has occasional problems due to his weight - about 300lbs at 5'7.

My boyfriend's family manages a small business that utilizes commission-based, labor-intensive outdoor work. It's difficult, especially when the temperatures reach 90+F, but it pays well if you stick to it. My roommate gave it a shot a while ago, and did pretty well, but suffered mild heat exhaustion after he didn't drink as much water as we suggested. Second time around was coming up, and he was chugging water down (good guy learns from his mistakes!).

My boyfriend gets inside and is helping roommate prepare for the trip. He asks, ""Have you eaten anything?""

""No..."" roommate realizes. Looks over at the counter. There's a big box of donuts that was gifted to us a day or so ago. He reaches over to grab a couple of them.

ohnoface.jpeg

I rush to the fridge and grab a couple carrots. The roommate is adamant. ""No, I don't want a carrot, the donuts will be fine.""

I ignore him and quickly peel them and hand them over. ""Even if you don't want them, if you get overheated again, they might help cool you off. They're full of water and stay cool naturally.""

Boyfriend told me later that while they were driving there, the roommate took a couple bites of donut and then just sort of stared at them. He asked, ""You feeling okay, dude?""

""Yeah,"" said roommate. ""I just... realized I don't want these."" Then he lifted up a carrot, almost reverently, and said, ""I kind of want the carrot."" He then wolfed both carrots and exclaimed loudly his desire for more. He came back munching on a bag of baby carrots and talking about how crazy it was how delicious they were, he never knew!

Maybe... just maybe, one day... he'll make it."	t5_2vzax	True
1376119927.0	1k2vb9	(mildly NSFW) Bathtub Troubles for My Family of Fatties.	fatthrowingaways	992	183	124	"Hey all, I'm so glad to have found this sub, I am excited to vent years of FPS. I'll be referring to myself as Aways, feel free to skip the intro.


**Intro TL;DR: my family is fat, I am not.**

---
To preface, my entire family is fat except for the youngest, me.  I developed an eating order in middle school when a classmate made fun of me for being too fat to hula hoop.  When I started crying and yelling that it's not my fault because my family is fat, he pointed out how it was because I ate so many cheetos (my mom sent me to school with a large bag of cheetos everyday for lunch) and started calling me fat cheeto.

From then on I started giving away my cheetos and just stopped eating at school because I didn't want to be called fat burger or something.  At home I still ate the food because otherwise my sister would yell out ""AWAYS IS NOT EATING!!""  Inspired by the music video for Pink's ""Stupid Girls"" I made myself throw up.

---

Fast forward to freshman year of highschool, my family hates me because I'm thin.  My brother, TheCosmos, is 19, and my sister, Wandamelon, is 18.  Both live at home.


I had started to explore my body like most teens do.  It's about 3am and thinking that my family is sleeping, I decide to masturbate in the shower.  I am on my back and have been in there for about half an hour.


I reiterate, it is 3am and all of us have to wake up before 7am.  I use the time as an excuse for dismissing the sounds of the floorboards capsizing due to Wandamelon stomping towards the bathroom as the house just getting old and resting a bit.


Wandamelon then throws the door open and THEN decides to declare ""AWAYS, I'M COMING IN TO PEE, YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE FOR FOREVER.""  I assume that she noticed my shadow missing from the thin shower curtain so she proceeds to throw is open to reveal me looking guilty, still in the standing up motion, with the detachable showerhead detached.


She then gives me a pie-eating grin and proceeds to tumble out as fast as she can, almost as eager as when my mom comes back from work with the family dinner for titans, towards TheCosmo's room.  I then hear her shriek, ""AWAYS IS MASTUUURRBAATTIINNGGG!!!!!""  The news spreads amongst my family.  And extended family.  When my aunt visited three days later I heard my mom telling her about it, followed by an ""EWWWWWWW.""   They still hold it against me.


Fast forward to about a week after the incident.  My mom comes home from work, with dinner sized for us plus 30, but it's actually a dinner for a small family of persons sized 30 plus. Something is amiss though.  Wandamelon has not tumbled down to the sty to chow down.  Instead there are faint sounds of a porker in agony being emitted from the bathroom.  You know where this is going. 


I go into the bathroom to check it out and only see a dome where a person should be standing through the curtain.  I pull back the curtain.  The dome shadow was my sister's stomach portruding from the bathtub.  She was on her back, with detached showerhead detached.  And she was fucking stuck in the bathtub.  Sobbing and stuck in the bathtub.  I try to yank her out but it's no use.  I squirt conditioner on her to grease her up, but I'm just not strong enough.  I throw her towel over her.


You may be thinking that she was crying because she was caught masturbating or because she was stuck in the bathtub, or both.
I did too until she squeals ""I WANT TO EAT DINNER.  TELL MOMMY TO COME HERE, I'M SO HUNGRY.""  At this point my mom and brother pause their feeding and rump over to examine the damage.  My brother, being the mature 19 year old, squeals ""EW GROSS"" and my mom screams ""LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID.""


At me.  She continues, ""IF YOU HADN'T GOTTEN THE IDEA IN HER HEAD, THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.  JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THIN YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD BECOME SOME SEX ADDICTED SLUT? LOOK AT HOW THAT AFFECTED YOUR SISTER.""  I sit on the toilet and start sobbing too.  My mom calls my brother in and they try to pull her out.  Imagine three beanbag chairs on top of each other.


My sister then snorts at them to stop and she says that she is soooooo hungry.  My mom sympathizes and gets her some chicken wings and my brother goes back to eating his portion.  The three of them took a food break while my sister was stuck in the tub, barely covered by a towel.  My sister was eating chicken wings while stuck in the tub almost naked.  And it was my fault.


After another 20 minutes of greasing and pulling at her arms, Wandawings got to an upright position and proceeded to get out of the bathtub by rolling over the edge on leg at a time.  My mom lectured me on being mean to my sister, and my didn't tell a soul about what happened with my sister.  No one holds it against her."	t5_2vzax	True

When this took place, I was 15. I had been sick for quite a few months due to which I ate very little and was mostly on fluids (juices, mainly). So, I had gone from a chub to skin and bones.

So after I started feeling better (and wasn't vomiting at the drop of a hat), I went to meet up with a few friends.

The two main people here are Hamplanet (5'1, 70-80kgs easily. Maybe more) and StonerBoy (5'11, pretty lean)

&gt;HP: Ew. You look disgusting.

Yes, that's how she greeted me

&gt;Me: Thanks..? -.-

&gt;SB: Are you okay? You look unwell.

&gt;Me: Yeah. The heat doesn't suit me well and I guess I caught a random stomach bug, so havent really been able to eat probably. But Im better now, thanks.

&gt;HP: I bet you're just lying. You're a puker aren't you?

&gt;Me: Wut?

&gt;HP: Pandamail, only dogs like bones. Real men like curves.

Me and SB are confused now. And I was honestly offended.

&gt;Me: Uh...

EATthrowaway	963	156	127	"So, I've recently been allowed to re-join my gym, as long as I promise to not lose any weight (YAY!) and, as of Monday, I became a fully fledged CardioBunny(TM) again. This happened this morning, and it just made me kinda sad. I live in a pretty poor area; hamplanetry, McDicks and poverty frolic hand in hand through the town. I frequent the gym when it opens, with my dad, cause I get a lift there and I only have to share the Ladies room with a couple of little old women (who I love, and frankly, who love me). Gonna green text for ease of reading

&gt;head to changing rooms to shower etc and leave. I have a hot date with a library book and an americano

&gt;Be ready to go, just putting face on, in the mirrors.

&gt;Hamplanet comes waddling out of cubicle, makes her way to my mirror.

Side note, I love hamplanets at the gym, I really do, we're all gonna make it etc, but this lady had already pissed me off by sitting in the little Ladies Gym weight section when I wanted to be squatting my arse off. She sat on the floor and chatted to her mate for 25 minutes, during which she did a grand total of 2 sit ups. If I'm a gym bunny, she's a gym rhino. 

&gt;Gym Rhino is now squeezed into a swimming costume. Don't want to go into detail (brain bleach has been utilised) but the most amazing this was how she got her tits to STAY IN it, I thought something was going to snap.

&gt;Never felt sorry for clothing before.

&gt;I step to the side, so she can look in the mirror at the same time as me, and so I can finish putting my face on

&gt;""YOU DON'T NEED TO MOVE OUT MAH WAY, I COULD SEE JUST FINE AS IT WERE""

&gt;""Oh, I'm sorry, I was just being polite""

&gt;""DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SO POLITE ABOUT SUGGESTING I'M FAT""

&gt;I'm speechless. 

&gt;""I never suggested that, I apologise that I have somehow offended you, but seriously, I would have stepped aside for anyone, as I believe it to be good manners.""

&gt;*scoffs* ""WELL MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU'LL HAVE SOME THOUGHT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TO LOSE WEIGHT, NOT JUST STARE AT THEIR SKINNY ARSES IN THE MIRROR""

&gt;I'm getting upset; I find confrontations really difficult and this woman is pushing my buttons.

&gt;Little Old Lady pipes in from the other mirror, 

&gt;""It's all-right love, don't let her drag you down, she's just jealous that you can look in a mirror without it cracking""

What follows is a transcript, to the best of my memory, of Eric and my conversation with Ginger's parents the early morning after her birthday party. 

&gt;Mrs. Ginger: ""Hello?""

Me: ""Mrs. Ginger, this is Lulu and Eric, Ginger's roommates.""

&gt;Mrs. Ginger: ""Oh no, what's wrong? Did something happen to my baby? Is she okay?""

Me: ""Ginger is more than fine. We're calling you because we're having some problems with her.""

&gt; Mr. Ginger: (angry) ""Why are you calling us so early if it's not an emergency?""

Me: ""It's not an emergency Mr. Ginger, but it's important.""

Eric: ""We're going to ask your daughter to stop living with us. We can't force her to break the lease or move out of the apartment, so we want you to do it.""

&gt;Mr. Ginger: (more angry) ""AND WHY THE HELL WOULD WE DO THAT?""

Me: ""In the past 24 hours, your daughter has drank alcohol, posted an intimate photo of me on Facebook, stolen my homework, and had sex with my ex-boyfriend.""

Eric: ""In the whole time we've all been living together, she's stolen our food, repeatedly clogs the toilet, and repeatedly sexually harassed me. She also drove away one of our roommates.""

&gt;Mr./Mrs. Ginger: ""WHAT?""

At this point, Ginger's parents stopped talking to us and started arguing with each other. Here are some highlights from what we could hear:
&gt;""MY BABY'S NOT A VIRGIN?""
&gt;""YOUR DAUGHTER'S A WHORE!""
&gt;""I SENT HER FIBER SUPPLEMENTS!""
&gt;""SHE DRINKS?!""
&gt;""SHE'S SO FAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW BOYS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HER!""
&gt;""IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE HER LESS FOOD MONEY, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE LOST WEIGHT AND THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED!""

One of them must have realized they never ended the call, and just hung up. Not sure if the call did anything or not, but Eric drives to the store and changes the lock on the front door while I clean up after Ginger's party. There's dtill no sign of Ginger when we've finished and we're both exhausted, so we decide to go to sleep. A few hours later, we hear a banging on the door.

&gt;""ERIC! ERIC! MY KEY'S NOT WORKING! OPEN UP!""

The new lock was completely different in color and style from the old one, by the way. But Ginger continued to holler about her key not working. Eric and I exchanged long suffering glances and open it. Ginger is armed with a huge bag of Chinese take out in one hand and a bucket of fried chicken on the other. She seats herself in front of the TV, starts up a season of Gossip Girl, and starts eating, acting like nothing is out of the ordinary. 
Eric calmly turns off the TV, to her yell and we sit across from her. ""Ginger, we want you to leave,"" he said. Mid-chew, Ginger says, ""What?"" I repeat that we don't want to live with her anymore. We tell her that we want her to move out, as soon as possible. Ginger starts sobbing, but doesn't stop shoveling down Mongolian beef and chicken wings.

&gt;""IS THIS BECAUSE OF LUKE? I WARNED YOU THAT HE WAS GOING TO FIND A REAL WOMAN SOONER OR LATER LULU YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THAT!""

I say it's not because of Luke, it's because she's a selfish, thieving, bitch and that I know that she put the photo of me up on Facebook. Ginger tried to deny it and say it was Luke who did it, then she starts crying harder (but not hard enough to stop eating, her tears mixed in with the Kung Pao chicken but I guess there was no taste difference?) and says she only took my hard drive because she wanted me to have fun and go to her party and that we were mean for not wanting to celebrate her birthday.

&gt;""LULU YOU'RE SO JEALOUS OF ME THAT YOU EXCLUDE ME FROM EVERYTHING AND YOU AND ERIC AND YURI CELEBRATED EACH OTHER'S BIRTHDAYS AND GAVE GIFTS TO EACH OTHER! NONE OF YOU GAVE ME ANYTHING! YOU'RE SO MEAN!""

Technically, true. ""We didn't give you anything because we don't like you,"" Eric said to her and we both start listing how awful she's been since the day we moved in. Ginger looks outraged, says we're selfish for not sharing our food with her, that she shouldn't be punished for her ""condition,"" and she would have given me back my homework the next day and that I shouldn't have freaked out about it, among other delusions. We just cut her off, and repeat our demands. She had to move out at once.

&gt;""YOU CAN'T MAKE ME DO ANYTHING, YOU FAT SHAMERS!""

But then mercy arrives, in the form of Ginger's parents. They point at Ginger, and tell her to leave with them right now. Ginger looks at me furiously. Her face matched her hair by now.

&gt;""YOU JEALOUS FUCKING BITCH! YOU TOLD ON ME TO MY PARENTS?""

Eric and I go outside, but we hear everything. Ginger's parents yell at her for her ""wantonness"" and her lack of decency. They make her pack, and take her home with them. But alas, Ginger is not gone forever.

Dramagirl is gone, and I am alone in unfamiliar territory.  

I had learned much under her tutelage, but I was still the lvl. 22 Ratatta to Saggy's proverbial lvl. 56 Dragonite.  Without Dramagirl at my back, I converted back to my weak, beta self and Saggy knew it.  She started to make aweful comments to me at every opportunity, and I still wasn't good at defending myself in a way that didn't make me sound stupid.  I'd always think of what to say hours later, or when I did say something, it was lame and uninspired.

My back was broken.

Saggy was born of the darkness.

**Much, much later**

After about a week, Dramagirl returned home because the police had zero evidence for anything and they probably thought the whole situation was infantile.  

However, Dramagirl was pretty much fed up with Saggy's shit and decided to pretty much move into her boyfriend's apartment.  She spent most of her time there anyways.

&gt; I was alone in the jungle, and Saggy was eying my room full of groceries that only a tiny lock protected.

&gt; Found out after a few days that she'd figured out how to swipe a credit card or something to get into my room.  My cereal disappeared one day, I called Dramagirl, and she explained how Saggy did it.  She'd done it to Saggy to steal back her stuff sometimes.  I started leaving my laptop on, open, and had skype recording.  I moved all my food to the area next to my bed where Skype was recording.  The food was a tiny sacrifice for what was to come.

&gt; Saggy started to make horrible comments to me anytime she came in contact with me.

&gt; ""Skinny bitch.""

&gt; ""Whore face.""

&gt; ""Got a boyfriend yet?  Don't bring him around or he'll be mine too.""

&gt; I was miserable.  For Christmas I asked for knives and swords.  I think deep down I wanted to stab that flabby bitch in the fupa.

&gt; Sometime early the next semester, Dramagirl broke up with her boyfriend, and was forced to return to the beetuscave.

&gt; She found me there, broken, alone, and whipped by Saggy.

&gt; I had lost all hope and therefore had nothing to lose in this hell-hole of an apartment.  I had no friends, no boyfriend, had lost my religion (a terrible experience, though a necessary one), and had lost a very unhealthy amount of weight from my depression.

&gt; So I had been gathering my data, and had been talking to the Dean of Students.  She had noted my loss of weight and pep (I'm naturally very happy, it's easy to tell when I'm feeling low...and I was in the Marianas Trench) and was becoming more and more concerned.  She was getting very pushy to get the name of my roommate so she could get her moved to another apartment.

&gt; But I didn't want her ""moved.""

&gt; I wanted her destroyed.

&gt; I knew she had been skipping a lot of classes.  She fucking bragged about it.  She would've had to stop stuffing her face full of chicken nuggets for an entire hour and a half to attend a class.  That was just unrealistic guys!  So she was on the verge of failing out of school.  She did that bit for me.

&gt; She was smoking more and more, and she was doing it in the living room constantly now.

&gt; She would sometimes break into my room and steal bits and pieces of my groceries.  I had the videos cut and put into a nice little file hidden away on my computer.

&gt; It was the middle of March when I struck.

&gt; Saggy had just had a huge party the night before (ugh, no sleep for me...) and was lazing around smoking some herb.  She hadn't cleaned the cat box in her room for weeks, so there were feces everywhere again, and Missy was howling because she was still in heat.

&gt; She was there, sitting on the couch, eating her Country Fuckin Crock Butter - 

&gt; When I called the police.

&gt; ""My roommate is smoking pot in our living room, she does it all the time and I'm sick of it and very uncomfortable.  Just send some cops, I'm in apartment ### on the ground floor.""

&gt; I finished the call and tippy-toed to the hallway.  

&gt; There I waited (like a creeper, admittedly) watching Saggy smoke and watch tv and stuff her fat face.

&gt; Suddenly the door opened.  I'd told them it was open and they were allowed in.

&gt; Saggy looked at the two police men in the doorway, froze, and then hastily tried to snuff out her roach in an ashtray like a fool.

&gt; ""Oh no honey, it's too late for that,"" said one of them.  I will never forget it.  He had this huge shit-eating grin on his face.

&gt; Saggy started to wail, tears streaming down her face and make-up running everywhere.

&gt; ""I can't get arrested!  I'll get kicked out of school!  I'll get kicked out!""

&gt; ""You should've thought about that before you were a conniving bitch Saggy,"" I said from the shadows.

&gt; She whirled around, seeing me in the hallway for the first time.  Her makeup was running down her face.  She had a glob of butter on the side of her lips and her chin was greasy from it.

&gt; She immediately started screaming ""SHE SMOKES TOO!  SHE HAS POT IN HER ROOM I'VE SEEN HER SMOKE!!!""

&gt; Police find pot in my room.  The bitch had fucking put pot in there.

&gt; I tell them they can check my urine or whatever all they wanted, and to go talk to the Dean of Students, I had been informing her of my situation for months.  Those drugs were put there, and I can prove she had been breaking into my room and stealing my stuff.

&gt; Saggy starts thrashing around like a rabid squirrel, literally kicking her legs and swinging her arms while lying on the couch as one of the cops tried to get her out the door and in cuffs.  

&gt; Unfortunately I was escorted back to my room to present the skype recordings I'd made while she continued to scream in the front room.  I did not see the carnage that unfolded, but she was screaming and crying pretty much the entire time.

&gt; I quickly zipped through my video file for the cop, and it only took about ten seconds for him to nod and say ""ok, I'll talk to the Dean at the U.""

&gt; Saggy was upright and standing next to the wall crying as I came back to the living room with the other cop.

&gt; I say nothing, and just raise my middle finger as she is escorted out the door.

&gt; Hear the whalecall from all the way outside.

&gt; Immediately call Dramagirl and tell her to get her dad, that Saggy was going to get everything that was coming to her.

Dramagirl and her dad were very close, and he probably knew every detail of what was happening with Saggy, but could do nothing because he lived far away or something and Dramagirl told him she could handle it.  

We got the Dean of Students to corroborate my story with the police, gave the police the videos, talked to the apartment complex and told them everything that was happening (Dramagirl's dad came down and talked to them with Dramagirl), and I went to the police department to give an official statement and such.  It was all super stressful, so I've kinda blocked it from my memory.  

&gt; ""Do you want to press charges?""

&gt; ""Oh my god yes.""

&gt; Saggy got kicked out, needless to say, was arrested, and served some amount of time for various things like possession, theft, harassment, false testimony and all that crap.  She made a plea-bargain or something and was let off easier than Dramagirl or I would've liked, and I actually think Dramagirl got some kind of compensation.  I didn't press for details.  Saggy was out out out, and we were free.  

&gt; We celebrated by filling the fridge with fruits and veggies.

**TL;DR: POLICE AND JUSTICE.**

Sorry if this is rushed, I'm so exhausted from my trip, and I'm really surprised at how much writing this part stressed me out.  All the other parts were an absolute joy to write, but this one seemed painful.  I'm actually glad it's over with now so I can return to writing the fun, fat-logic filled stories.  Next up is the Halloween Slut! Voted on by /u/Mikarevur.

&gt; Usually pissed off that stores do not have my sizes, and I am forced to shop in the girls' departments in various stores around my neighborhood.

&gt; Super pissed off that the shop near my university doesn't even carry size small. The smallest they carry are mediums that could fit my overweight relatives (in reality, they are probably a L or XL.) 

&gt; Order all my clothes online, can't even tell if they'll look decent on me. They usually don't.

&gt; Bitching about this maybe an hour prior on my break to my fiance.

Suddenly:
&gt; I go out to the sales-floor and a whale flops her way into the building. 

&gt; Mfw I am currently taking a biology class so I am intrigued. 

&gt; Upon further inspection, the customer seems to be a lost basilosaurid, noting the fat, stubby, and useless limbs. Fascinating. You can see that it has a complete ankle and several toe bones, even though it can't walk. 

&gt; She acquires a scooter.

&gt; Clever gal.

&gt; She scoots her way over to me.

&gt; ""Child, I'mma need a 5x or a 6x sweatshirt or sweatpants. Do you have any in stock?""

&gt; Now, I totally know we don't carry anything tarp-sized. The smallest we have is maybe a 3x, or maybe a 4x here and there. I'm trying my best to politely inform said whale that we only go up to that size, without making her feel awkward. Eventually, the words make it out and she rolls her eyes.

&gt; ""Ugh. This store must be for you young kids. You don't carry any sizes that AREN'T JUNIORS?""

&gt; We carry a wide variety of clothes. I'm super embarrassed and we are standing in the middle of a literal sea of plus-sized women's clothing, under a sign that says ""Plus-Sizes."" I am in the process of folding pants that would easily fit three people. I just nod and smile.

&gt; She scoots away, frustrated.

&gt; I sigh.

A few minutes pass.

&gt; An old lady comes up to me, about my size and stature.

&gt; ""Honey, when you get off work today, buy a sewing machine and learn. By the time you are my age,  you are going to have to sew your own clothing because of sows like that. I'll be damned if I can find any normal sized clothing around town.""

So Hamela has sadly been taken from us, quite suddenly. 2 men in blue came and took the whale in red away. Let us have a moment of silence (tee-hee) and now for the story...

The date is June 1st, yesterday in fact. My pool is cooling off in the back, and I am cruising Reddit, watching some Arrested Development, drinking a beer, and looking at some legal options. It is about 3pm and the sun is sinking lower into the sky, but it it still bright.

The lovely silence is broken by a rapping at my front door. I answer the door and I'm greeted by a man, about 5 foot 6 and 330 lbs. 

""Hey!"" he says gruffly, ""You live here""

This man is Hamela's husband, known forever more as Hambert Downey Jr. He had a beach towel and swim trunks on.

Back to the story...

""You bet he lives ere!"", a voice says from the car parked in the street in front of the house.

Hamela is sitting sideways in the passenger seat with the door open. She's wearing a huge floppy hat, and giant sunglasses. She also has a giant blue blanket covering the rest of her body.

""Dont you stare at me like that! I'm married! Gotta keep mah *skin* outta the sun, cause ya poisned me!""

Her husband is quite angry, which is quite comical because he's overflowing into my doorway, and I'm literally looking down at him because of the height difference.

""Are you tryin to start somethin?"" he says, ""If you ever try to get with my wife I swear I will-""

""I don't f-find your wife attractive"", I said, I didn't stutter because I'm afraid, I stuttered because I was feeling kind of awkward.

Hambert saw this and started patting his gunt like he had gun in there. I couldn't really see anything under his gut though.

""Yah owe us a swim"", he said, ""the doctur said it wood be good fur Hamela's skin to soak in some water"".

""I don't owe you anything"", I said, I was amazed these people were so entitled, that they thought that I was going to let them swim in my pool.

Hambert is yelling now, ""Mah wife told meh all bout you, she told meh that you werent lettin her swim cause she was fat!""

Hamela is still sitting in the car, echoing her husband's words.

""Yea, he also said he wanted tuh get with meh"" she said.

""It's people like you who make this world a horrible place to live! he said"". Hambert was exerting a lot of energy and was getting quite sweaty and red.

""We have **connections**"", he threatened, ""We could get yur pool closed up cause its unhealthy"".

I was done, so I said ""Get off my porch before you break it!"", and I slammed the door in their faces.

I went back to my laptop and checked the camera.

Before they had confronted me, Hamela and Hambert had attempted to get in the gate.

Fatties gonna use Fat Logic, it was NOT very effective.

I am currently pressing charges on at least Hamela. I need to meet with a lawyer to see if I can/should do anything with Hambert. Regardless, I hope to obtain restraining orders against both, and maybe get reimbursed for the chemicals Hamela absorbed in  the water...

1367900234.0	1dud23	Hamelia Wants to Ride Me	Snooves	945	154	179	"&gt;Be me, about 15 years old

&gt;Religious parents make me go to a Jesus camp to try to make me stop being an Atheist

&gt;feels bad man

&gt;9 hours of church a day, outside in rural Oklahoma, on a cement structure with no air conditioning in July

&gt;hotterthanhell.jpg

&gt;Sleep constantly interrupted for middle of the night Jesus candle praying bullshit

&gt;brainwashing101.avi

&gt;Only thing keeping me sane is my friend Taylor, who got sent there because her mom found a condom wrapper 
in her trash can.

&gt;Taylor is 17, like 4'11 and probably weighs 80lbs - 100lbs.

&gt;Every day we have to walk up a steep ass hill to get to this stupid pre-church, church thing we have to go to 
before main church. It's the only time when we aren't directly chaperoned.

&gt;When I say ""steep ass hill"", I mean that it is practically vertical. If it was any straighter, it'd be reclassified as a cliff face.

&gt;Taylor and I have some inside joke. I don't remember what it is, since this was like 8 years ago, but the end result is that I carry her up the steep ass hill every day. Taylor weighs about as much as a heavy backpack, so it's not that hard to do. Plus, I'm 15 and I think she's insanely hot, so any excuse for her to touch me is golden.

&gt;Enter Hamelia

&gt;Hamelia is about 5'5, and looks like she weighs somewhere between 250 and 300 lbs.

&gt;Hamelia is at the camp, because her parents run one of the groups. She seems to be the only person who enjoys being there.

&gt;On a good day, Hamelia smells like fluid that sometimes leaks out of a hole in a bag of old garbage.

&gt;Between the like 10 miles we have to walk every day, and the triple digit heat, Hamelia is always drenched in sweat which makes her smell worse even worse.

&gt;One day, approaching steep ass hill I offer Taylor a ride, she jumps on my back. We begin making juvenile jokes about how she's riding me, when suddenly, in the whiniest voice imaginable ""Hey, I don't want to walk up the hill either, when do I get a ride?!?""

&gt;Hamelia wants a ride up the hill.

&gt;bonerisgonenow.jpg

&gt;I try to decline nicely

&gt;""Umm, it's always Taylor's turn Hamelia, she's my fuzz buddy""

&gt;Proceed to carry Taylor up the hill like I always do

&gt;NEXT DAY

&gt;Approach steep ass hill

&gt;Hamelia approaches ""So, do I get to ride you today?""

&gt;""No Hamelia, only Taylor gets a ride.""

&gt;Taylor hops on, proceed with the juvenile jokes and thinly veiled sexual innuendo

&gt;About half way up the hill

&gt;Hamelia spews ""Fine but I'm riding you tomorrow!!!""

&gt;bonerdeflated.gif

&gt;NEXT DAY

&gt;Approach steep ass hill

&gt;Before Taylor jumps on Hamelia pushes her out of the way to get between us.

&gt;""IT'S MY TURN TODAY!""

&gt;Sick of being nice, and more than a little pissed that she literally shoved Taylor, I try truth

&gt;""Hamelia. I honestly can't carry you up the hill.""

&gt;Tears form in the corner of the hambeast's eyes. Tears made of theater popcorn butter.

&gt;""YOU CAN TOO!!!""

&gt;""No, I can't Hamelia."".

&gt;Truth is not very effective. 

&gt;Instead of realizing that I'm not Superman, she starts wailing about fat oppression and about how mean I am

&gt;""WHY DO GUYS ALWAYS WANT GIRLS WHO LOOK LIKE HER?!?""

&gt;Hamelia points a bratwurst of a finger at Taylor

&gt;""SHE DOESN'T HAVE BOOBS OR AN ASS""

&gt;At this point, loads of people are looking at us. Wailing fatty is making a huge scene.

&gt;""SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY CURVES, SHE LOOKS LIKE A GUY""

&gt;Shit's not true. Like most of them women I've been attracted to in my life, Taylor has a small waist and really 
wide hips, you know, actual curvy as opposed to bowling ball, hamplanet curvy.

&gt;Hamelia turns back to me

&gt;""YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ME, JUST BECAUSE THE FASHION INDUSTRY HAS CONVINCED YOU THAT WOMEN HAVE TO HAVE EATING DISORDERS TO BE PRETTY!!! THOSE WOMEN AREN'T REAL!!! REAL WOMEN DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT, THEY LOOK LIKE ME!!! REAL WOMEN ARE CURVY AND HAVE LOTS OF BOOBS AND ASS TO PLAY WITH!!!""

&gt;All jaws are on the floor. Everyone in a 5 mile radius is watching.

&gt;""Taylor is real, she's standing over there.""

&gt;Hamelia turns a deep shade of purple and leaves. 

&gt;Taylor doesn't ride me up the hill that day, she's embarrassed from all the people that looked then the hambeast was roaring.

&gt;nobonertoday.jpg

&gt;Hamelia doesn't show up at pre-church church, or main-church church. It's a relief not to be stuck in the garbage smell cloud.

&gt;NEXT DAY

&gt;Approach steep ass hill, Hamelia says nothing, Taylor jumps on my back. The magical fountain of juvenile jokes and thinly veiled sexual innuendo flows again. All is well in the universe.

&gt;Sit through boring pre-church church. Some shit about abortion. Preacher keeps saying crazy things like how abortion has ""roots in the occult"" and is actually the worship of a god named Moloch.

&gt;idgaf.jpg

&gt;Pre-church church ends, must go down steep ass hill to get to main-church church.

&gt;The astute reader, will note that I haven't spoken about the boner inspiring experience of carrying Taylor down the steep ass hill. That's because we tried it once on the first day, and determined that it was a really, really bad idea. It's just too hard to balance, going down something that steep with someone on you. We made it like 1/2 way down the first time, before giving up, because we nearly tumbled to our certain deaths at the bottom of the steep ass hill.

&gt;As I'm approaching the top of the hill I hear ""I GET A RIDE NOW"", I start to turn, just in time to see Hamelia in mid air, about to land on me.

&gt;Hamelia slams into me with meteor force and wraps her fat, flappy arms around my neck and her ham legs around my thighs. The momentum causes me to take two big steps down the hill, then I fall forward.

&gt;I landed face down, and it happened pretty quick, so I was unaware of what happened. Taylor tells me later that it looked like she rode me about 5 feet like a sled before being bounced off.

&gt;My pants have gaping holes where the knees are, most of the skin on my knees was shredded by the pavement. My pants are quickly soaking through with blood. My face and the side of my head hit the pavement with enough force that my glasses are completely unsalvageable. I've got a gash on my forehead, and the side of my face is skinned. There is so much blood that I can't see out of my right eye. My t-shirt is shredded, my chest and stomach are skinned and bleeding, though not badly compared to everything else that's bleeding. My left ankle is sprained, my elbows and forearms are badly skinned and bleeding everywhere. Everything which is skinned is also conveniently full of little black pavement rocks and dirt. Wind is knocked out of me so badly that I can't breathe and while gasping for air, I see stars and pass out briefly Luckily, nothing is broken.

&gt;youshouldaseentheotherguy.jpg

&gt;Hamelia's left leg is shattered, and she breaks her right wrist, several fingers, somehow her tailbone and gets a concussion. She's also pretty skint up.

&gt;Ambulances come. Takes like 45 minutes for them to get there. Hamelia is out cold the whole time, I scream every obscenity I know at the top of my lungs, because I feel like I'm being attacked by fourty billion fire ants.

&gt;Through all my pain I notice that it's taking like 8 EMTs to get Hamelia onto a stretcher.

whenever i want which happens to be all the time

&gt; a regular appointment with a personal trainer `steve brule; for your health`

&gt; feeling great and being noticed by all the people; confidence through the roof
! sunny days always

&gt; best shape of my life

now, i have a gym membership which i use to be even more active. unfortunately,
so does hammy whalemore, which he uses to dawdle around in the presence of healthy and fit people

enter the logic:

&gt; be
 hammy whalemore (HW) 5'11 350lb. Unhealthy, not athletic, inactive, drives whenever he can, get outside whenever he wants which happens to be never

&gt; be me, following his progress for two weeks. a gym buddy for a random person in the gym. Great i think, good karma coming my way

&gt; start talking to him about what he's accomplished so far, says he's lost 40lbs over the past 2 months (20lbs a month is a solid loss).

&gt; his habits (sleep, food, the basics) seemed to be on the right path

hope starting to form...

&gt; next few gym days, i see HW and make my way over to him. He's sweating and wheezing loudly. Says he's been at it for an hour so far. Odd i think to myself, of the times ive told him id be there at a certain time, he always says “ive been at it for an hour”. Sweat + wheeze make me believe him.

&gt; few weeks pass and always with the “been at it for an hour”. Tell HW that I'll be there at 3pm today but secretly show up @1 and his the bikes at the back of the gym. Don't see HW walk in until 2:55.

&gt; come out of the back, only to hear the same thing... “i've been at it for about an hour” with the sweats and the wheezes

&gt;”Great! He's been lying to me.” i think #nohope

&gt; I say “what have you eaten today?” he replies “for breakfast, I had three eggs, one strip of bacon, coffee, water. Then a snack around 11, and a chicken breast at 2”

&gt; i acknowledge... even though his stories are intersecting and you arent allowed to eat at the gym. #mentalnote

whatever

&gt; we continue until it's time to go and then hit the scales at the back of the gym

&gt; he steps on and he has actually gained 3 lbs.  He insists that it's muscle. I get annoyed and call him on it. The shame is apparent but i figure, calling him on his malarkey will stop this bullshit.

&gt; “HW, I was here at 1 this afternoon. I saw you walk in at 2:55.”

&gt; as he stumbles over his words, i say w/e, just dont lie to me. You're only hurting yourself.

&gt; he agrees and goes about his way

&gt; two days pass and i'm out for breakfast with a friend whom i havent seen in a while. Catching up is always fun.

&gt; i see out of the corner of my eye, HW on the other side of the resto. His breakfast came and my jaw opened wide...

&gt; 3 eggs covered in hollandaise, 6 bacon, 6 sausages, seperate plate of homefries cooked in grease and butter... i shudder. There is about 3000 calories on one plate and about 1500 on the other. I snap a picture from my table.

&gt; i see him in the gym later in the day. Told him we were meeting at three and i show up at 2. no sign of HW till 2:55 again. Ask him what time he got there, he says 2... lie #1. ask him what he's eaten today, he says “the usual” three eggs, one bacon... only healthy stuff... lie #2. “hey HW, did you make your meals yourself today?” sure did, idgygdi. So much cheaper eating at home now! Lie #3

&gt; Literally toss him a towel and say “im out. Good luck but i doubt it”

&gt; “what are you talking about?” he says with such conviction that i would have believed him had i not seen him at the resto that morning. I show him the picture i took of him at the table with his calorie laden meal. Mention that ive been in the gym since 2pm. “I said don't lie to me. You lied to me just now. I'm done. Going home. You're a hopeless cause. Get yourself right and then call me.”

&gt; ham-defenses up, like the force field that surrounds the death star, engaged! “thats not me! pig snort thats my twin brother!” (not in the month of conversation has he mentioned a brother) I call bullshit and he gets ENRAGED...

&gt; “WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T EAT!? I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.” he shouts loudly enough that the store next to the gym can hear what he's saying. (for reference, the next store over is seperated by about 500feet of parking lot)

&gt; i pick up my things and make my way to the change room. He doesn't stop. He is yelling and screaming and it kinda of reminds me of fat bastard in austin powers “get in my belly”. I grab my shit from the changeroom and take off... dont even bother changing.

&gt; He calls me a bunch of times and i send his call to voicemail each time. I listened to the messages later that night and they started out pleasant “sorry” got angry, almost ended in him crying into the phone “im sorry igdydgy” and then the very last message after i didnt call him back was this... 

&gt; i shit you not, this was it word for word... “Idgygdi, I had a DR appointment and he said that I'm overweight and I need to lose a pretty large chunk of that weight. I also called my lawyer and he said that because of your unsolicited training, you owe me money. He said that it was illegal the moves that you were making me do and that you and I should talk and come to a settlement out of court. Call me back!”

&gt; I have never laughed so hard... legal issues now? Right. I wasn't giving him any advice on how to work out, or what to work out on, just keeping him company and telling him what I ate/worked on. Smooth move, exlax.

&gt; about a week later, i get a call from his “lawyer”. Says exactly what HW said in the vm, that because of the training that i was providing, he is entitled to a few thousand dollars worth of therapy to correct errors in his knees, back, chest, and lower abdomen.

&gt; i explain my side of things, back it up by the manager of the gym's word, back it up by all of the witnesses i have at the gym, back it up by the logic of it all and ask that the lawyer never contact me again with any thing related to this supposed “case”.

&gt; turns out the “lawyer” was HW's mom calling and pretending that she was a lawyer and trying to get some financial gain from the call. I could not believe it when I found out. I went to the gym and told them the story and they immediately took HW's membership away from him and barred him from that gym. Their reasoning for barring him was “So that our regular gym goers don't have their regular workouts affected by someone else's fat logic.”

oh, reddit. This was the best day ive had in a long time...

&gt; be everyone else at the gym watching the on-goings with HW at the desk when he tried to get in...

Be today, worked 8 hours doing retail and ~~heading~~ limping off to catch the bus home.
 First bus is no problem, enough seats for everyone and I can rest my knee comfortable.

The next bus I take is always packed, especially at 5-6pm. 
Just gonna grit my teeth and maybe someone will take pity on me, maybe. 
Bus is PACKED like, not picking up anyone anymore, the passengers are mimicking sardines pack. 
The woman in front of me is...uh...a whole lot of woman. I'm guessing 5'5"" and 250 or 275.

None of the men in eyesight aren't offering their seats to any of the 
older women or me. But a few of the younger women give up their 
seats to the older women. I refused one offer in order to let a little 
old lady in a maids outfit sit down. 
I would of been ashamed to sit down while she stood.

This whole time this large woman is talking about how no one has 
offered her a seat and what's the world coming to and how her knees 
hurt(THIS IS IMPORTANT) and how she can't stand for too long, ya'll 
know the drill. Then, this teenage blonde girl who's sitting in front of 
this ""real woman"" notices my knee. She immediately asks if I would 
like to sit down since I'm pretty obviously broken and in pain. 

Lets just guess who tries to sit down when she gets up.
I'll give you a second to talk among your selves.
..
...
....
If you guess that this Hammy lady let me sit down you're delusional. 
No, the Ham Woman tries to sit down. Now, Blondie and I aren't about to let this happen. 
Blondie interjects and tells Ms. Ham that she was offering the seat to me, not her. 

Obviously, this is unacceptable. 

Hammy starts to whine about how she has bad knees and she can't stand for this long and how her knees are acting up. 
I stare her dead in the eye and tell her to look at my knee.

""Oh. well you've been standing all this time right? It wouldn't hurt you to stand for much longer would it? I just really can't stand because of my knees""

""I'm sorry Miss, but I tore my meniscus and I'm sitting down. If you have a problem with this then feel free to complain to the bus driver.""

[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/wtf/what-Alison-Brie-.gif) she does, in fact complain to the bus driver that I'm ""discriminating"" against people with ""disabilities"".

[HFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/kanye-smh-no.gif) he sees my robo-knee brace.

Yeah, I didn't have to get up and she spent the rest of my ride complaining to whoever would listen about the injustices in the world.

1363109544.0	1a5ots	Running is bad for you. 	SometimesIArt	927	148	164	"So this happened last night.

Going for my 10k run, enjoying the fact that the snow is melting and I can actually run at a fast pace without slipping and sliding on ice everywhere. There's only a thin path worn in the ice on the sidewalk in which the pavement shows through. Pedestrians can see me coming and move onto the ice for a few seconds to let me run by so I don't have to run on ice. 

So I'm on km 8, and suddenly have a panic attack because there's a freaking polar bear walking down the sidewalk towards me. Except it was just a 400+ lady in a white coat, swaying along (waddling might be too quick for her walk). 

She sees me, I see her... and she just doesn't move. And at this point, if I want to get around her I need to go to the far edge of the ice just beside the snow drift that piled up from the road. The ice is thin and wet there, but she is refusing to step aside so I hop onto the ice and keep going. I'm getting ice water flooding my shoes and ankles because ice is too thin that far off the path. If she had slightly moved over it would have been okay. 

As I approach her she starts flailing and yelling and clearly trying to get my attention so I slow a tiny bit and pull my headphone out. ""What's up?""

She's yelling ""stop stop stop stop!!!"" 

So I do because I think I'm on fire or something. I look down and around and see nothing and am standing ankle-deep in gritty ice water in those super fashionable toe-shoes. ""What? What's wrong?"" 

""Stop that, it's DANGEROUS."" 

I think she means running on ice. ""Oh, no, I've been doing it all winter, no worries! Thanks, though!"" (I'm Canadian). I start to go on but she stops me by grabbing my arm. 

""And look what it's done to you!"" Here, she points at my knees. I wear funky-looking braces on both of my knees most times I run because I was in an accident 10 years ago that destroyed a lot of my ligaments. And then two years ago it happened again when I was hit by a car when biking. I don't mind them, they make me look part robot and if they really bother me I can afford a run or two without them. 

""What... wait, what? What do you mean?"" 

""Running is destroying your body."" 

""... oh! No, I have to wear these because I was in an accident."" 

""Oh, and I'm sure running is *really* helping them. And I suppose you're one of those girls who hates her body, too."" 

(I am 170lbs 5'6"" down from 250lbs, losing 20 more) ""Er... I don't..."" 

""Ugh, this is what I hate about society today. You girls destroying yourselves and wrecking your bodies, putting yourselves through HELL because the media is brainwashing you. Embrace your body!"" 

""... Look. I actually love running. I do it because I enjoy it and it makes me feel good."" 

""Oh, that's bullshit. I guess whatever you need to tell yourself to force yourself to *destroy* yourself. Listen to you! Huffing and puffing --"" Read: deep breathing... also, she was breathing heavier than I was, and sweating more. ""-- it's dangerous!

""... okay... well... thanks for the warning... but I have to go."" 

""Stop. I'm not done. Just because you *can* run doesn't mean you *have* to! It's inconsiderate!"" 

""... inconsiderate."" 

""Judging everyone you pass by just because you're thinner than them!"" 

""... *judging*?!"" (I'm still technically overweight, too!)

""You don't know why I look the way I do!"" 

""... I never assumed anything, ma'am..."" at this point I just don't even know. This conversation has made no sense, and I need to keep moving. 

""I look the way I do because I. Have. Bad. Knees."" She says this while jabbing her finger in the direction of *my* knees, as if it proved her point. IMHO it did the opposite and I was actually pretty offended. And wraps it up with, ""and therefore I can't exercise."" 

I just shake my head, fed up, and hop out of the water and start running again. She's screaming after me about me being an inconsiderate bitch, to not walk away when she's speaking to me, telling me she'll be watching the papers for my obituary, really dumb shit.

I don't know what happened, guys. I went to bed confused and woke up confused. I'm still confused. *She* stopped *me* to judge and ridicule me, and then at breakneck speed whipped it around to make it about me judging her. Wtf is wrong with fat people. I never did that when I was a planet. 

Sorry for the wall of text. If there's enough interest, I have a planet-parent that has loaded me up with lots of FPS, some hilarious and some depressing.

Hello! No need to put down the supersized lard, friends, we're going to jump straight into this one. This is a little collection of the ways, believe it or not, Hamthrax made the office a healthier place. Indirectly, of course. God knows she hasn't tried to help anyone besides saving that cookie from drowning in coffee.

1) Someburger to Love

&gt;be assorted coworkers

&gt;ordering out for lunch

&gt;as always, The Diabeatles has to have the first order

&gt;would knock a small child into a river if need be

&gt;forces two chairs to go swiveling across the office

&gt;"" GET ME THE LARGEST DIET COKE THEY HAVE AND A HOOGIE WITH EXTRA MAYO, EXTRA PROVALONE, EXTRA ROAST BEEF, AND NO LETTUCE""

&gt;""...oh, oka-""

&gt;""I'M SERIOUS, NO LETTUCE OR I'LL FUCKIN SUE THEM FOR DISCRIMINATION""

&gt;""...Hamthrax, what are you talking about?""

&gt;""THEY ALWAYS TRY TO GIVE ME VEGETABLES BECAUSE OF MY SIZE""

&gt;""I don't-""

&gt;""DESCHRIMINAZATIONNN""

&gt;everyone turns look at Blobscura

&gt;tromps back to desk, a couple letter trays fall to the floor

&gt;""Okay, anyone else?""

&gt;Salads all around

2) Good Old Fashioned Lovehandled Boy

&gt;be N

&gt;27 and gaining weight slowly

&gt;carrying extra 10lbs

&gt;be making coffee in the break room

&gt;Blue Oyster Malt trundles in behind him

&gt;pinches N's sides

&gt;""LOOK AT ALL DAT MAN""

&gt;N looks at Fattleaxe

&gt;looks down at his waist

&gt;looks at coffee with full fat milk and 2 sugars

&gt;pours it down the drain, grabs water bottle

&gt; 25lbs down now


3)Winded Bicycle Races

&gt;be R

&gt;45 y/o, FAT

&gt;we're talking 220lbs at 5'8

&gt;R isn't happy, not one (not so) little bit

&gt;be divorced

&gt;have 6 y/o daughter on the weekends

&gt;kid wants play tag and go biking

&gt;R is too fat to do this

&gt;kid tells R it's okay, she'll just do ""the fun stuff"" with mommy

&gt;feels.mpeg

&gt;not enough feels to stop R from stuffing his face with office doughnuts

&gt;but the fates were not going to let R keep fattening

&gt;they struck down the office elevator one rainy monday

&gt;now imagine the grey lobby, the large steel elevator doors

&gt;R stands in front of them, eyes focused on the ""Out of Order"" sign

&gt;never had three words formed such a desperation within this mans chest

&gt; he keeps staring at the paper

&gt;hoping the note would melt away and the doors would open, bathing him in cool, filtered air and soothing jazz music

&gt;no luck

&gt;a shadow forms over him

&gt;Deep Fried Purple has rolled her way over to him

&gt;it takes her a couple minutes to processes those words

&gt;face starts transitioning from confusion/constipation into anger/constipation

&gt; Sonic Girth's jowls start wobbling in the wind

&gt;R's jowls join in

&gt;Cobeef and Hambria looks at R

&gt;""THIS IS BULLSHIT""

&gt;""well... It's not good but-

&gt;"" WE'RE DISABLED THEY CANT DO THIS""

&gt; R looks back in shock

&gt;""THEY HAVE TO GET US UP TO THE OFFICE, WE CAN'T TAKE THE STAIRS, ITS NOT POSSIBLE""

&gt;R's mind cracks

&gt;Tells this story with tears in his eyes

&gt;""It was just like the bullshit movie breakthroughs. She was so fucking lazy. She wasn't disabled, she was FAT. And I was almost as fat as her. Like, if I didn't change, that could be my little girl, in 20 years. It scared me so fucking much. I took those fucking stairs, and ate a fucking salad for lunch. Starting biking with my kid, stopped stuffing my face like the world was ending. And now I'm down 40lbs, and all it took was that fuckin tub of lard.""

&gt; planet proceeds to stare at the girls. bear in mind these girls are uncomfortable being watched and it makes them feel guiltier about eating.

1373910647.0	1icpoy	**¿Donde Esta the seating for Los Whalepeople?**	thefukizamatterwithu	967	199	125	"All inclusive in Mexico:


So I just got back from a week in the Mayan Riviera - had a weeks paid vacation that I needed to use up ASAP or I was going to lose it - and there are always cheap deals from Toronto to meheeco so I figured I could do with a week's worth of floating my liver, stuffing my whore mouth and bungling the half a chance at a sexual encounter that would probably never present itself at some shitty, Hepatitis A trap of an all inclusive down south. At the very least I would get some sun on these hairy, pasty white tits of mine and maybe get drunk and catch a few lizards. I was also looking forward to doing some landwhale watching while I was down there. The myriad of different introduced American species, not to mention the endemic Mexican Ballenas Terrestriales - Mexico having recently surpassed the United States as the ""Fattest Country in the World"" (Thanks Coca Cola and and Coca Cola products!) was enticing. So, with that being said, I stuffed a bunch of arbitary clothing into my suitcase that is currently doubling as my laundry basket, grabbed my passport, told no one where I was going, and made my way to the aeropuerto. 


I don't know how to greentext (although I can dougie like a motherfucker), so if that is the format that you like best, you will just have to eat the biggest pile of shit you can find and die. In the mean time and in between time: This is the story all about how, my life got shit fucked upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I came across the most annoying pod of baileen whales this side of the Aleutian Islands. 

The subject in this story is an entire family, herein refered to as (""Fat Fuckin Family,"" ""FFF"" or ""Triple F""). FFF would make several appearances throughout my entire weeklong adventure. From the bus at the airport in Cancun, to the hotel buffet, to the beach, to my snorkeling trip, these assholes were omnipresent, being loud and racist and obnoxious and fat in as many places as they could muster up the breath to be in. First and foremost, let me just preface eveything by saying, I was more of a David Attenborough type ""observer"" during this whole mess, and less of a Steve Irwin, getting-my-finger-up-their-butholes-part-of-the-action type character. These people weren't so much being fat TO me, as being fat Arouuund me. But I'm a sensitive boy, and I felt like Michael Clark Duncan in the Green Mile,  internalizing and experiencing the unpleasant interactions with Triple F by all those around me as if they were my own. 


This is part one: ""¿Donde Esta the seating for Los Whalepeople?""


I'd just gotten off the plane, through customs, out into the muy sensual Mexican night and I was eager to start my binge drinking. I noticed a few vendors selling this and that and I figured I could squeeze in a 40 of Sol before my complimentary bus service showed up, get a nice buzz going and hopefully pass out on the hourlong ride to the hotel. I had just cracked the cap on my luke-warm 40, when [enter left] Fat Fuckin Family. They looked like a sweaty, greasy Francisco Botero painting. 4 of the shortest, fattest, most dishoveled looking human beings I have ever seen. A breeding pair and their 2 male fledgelings (aged maybe 13 and 16). The dad must have tipped the scale at over 500 pounds. The mother, probably slightly less (subtract her massive orangutan tits that probably, when lactating, produced a delishious crème brule, probably 100 lbs less) and their 2 little piolet whales, probably each 5'4 max, and 200+ pounds definitely. 

""Where is this fucking bus?"" oinked the mumu-clad matriarch ""typical fucking spics, never on time for anything!"" Now, you might feel safe yelling out racial epithets and berating Mexicans openly in the suburbs of Dallas-Fortworth, but remember, you are now in THEIR fucking country, a country where people routinely find themselves in a mass grave with their dick in their mouth for minor infractions. You think visitors would be on their best behaviour??? 


""Dad I'm starving, when are we going to eat"" sonar-ed the youngest member of the pod. Bat's scattered out of a hole in a nearby roof thinking they were being called home to roost. 

""The hotel is an hour away, and the bust isn't here!"" The news devistated the young cetacea as he wandered over to his mother's ample side. Another few minutes of humming and hawing ensued, cell phones were produced, texts were sent, fat-facebook statuses updated (""jus got to MexiCANT. No Food. Hate beeners. Fukkin hot! Want to eat then die…) and I tuned them out so I could get back to being the best alcoholic I could be. 


The next sequence of events I am still, over a week later, trying to process:


So the bus eventually pulls up 10 minutes later. We are apologized to for the late arrival by a very nice, young Mexican man that worked for the hotel, letting us know that apparently a motorcyclist had crashed head-on with a mac truck on the highway and died and there were police cars and an ambulance holding up traffic, obsviously. Everyone pretty much accepted this, including Triple F, much to my disappointment, because I was already looking for reasons to hate on them. So we finally load everyone onto the bus, when it's FFF's turn to get on. I can see their listless, beady eyes are scanning around for seats. In their haste and laziness, they take the seats at the very front of the bus. I did also (not the very front), but hey…thin privilege is being able to sit at the front of the bus and not have people think you are too tired to walk to the back. The 2 kids are ""small"" enough to fit (barely) in 2 normal human-being sized seats. Los Papas…they know their bodies. They know there is no way they are fitting into a normal person seat, so they have to take the handicapp seating at the front of the bus. Everyone is finally on and ready to go, when the driver comes over the PA and annouces that we are waiting for 2 more guests who are just getting through security. 

Cue gasps of indignation from our resident fat fuckin family. 

""Dad I'm starving"" reiterates the youngest of the little near earth objects. ""yeah Jim, we're all starving, can you please tell this guy to get this show on the road"" says the sea hag.  

""hey can we get going please, we just got off a very long, uncomfortable flight, my kids need to eat, let's go buddy"" The chief fatass says, dutifully placating his hamwarrior wife. 

""I'm sorry sir"" the little mexican man driving the bus says, I was told to wait for the last 2 guests, they'll be here shortly. 

Hungry and too tired to protest, Sir-Eats-A-Lot mutters something incoherent but probably racist under his bologna sandwich breath to DJ Nasty Wife and they both sit there grimacing at the thought of 1.X More hours of not adding to their developing joint coronary embolisms. 

10 more minutes go by and enter our late guests. The bus driver again comes over the PA to let us know that the 2 remaining guests have arrived and departure is eminent. The relieft in the air is palpable. Next thing I know, the beep beep beeping of a wheelchair ramp being lowered can be heard. The remaining guests have a wheelchair. But Chow Yung Fatass and his wife the ghost of Rita MacNeil reincarnated into a slightly less fat person are taking up the only 2 handicapable spots on the bus?

In rolls the most adorable and pathetic sight I had seen in a long while: a couple, the wife in a wheelchair, the loyal husband behind her pushing said wheelchair. It had taken them a few extra minutes to get through security with the wheelchair I guess. Understandable. 

""Sir, we are going to need you to move further back in the bus to let the couple with the wheelchair sit here"" the driver curtiously advises. 

""I can't move"" shouts Mr. John Q Fatfuck. ""the other seats are too small"". 

The bus driver then calmly proceeds to tell him that the other seats are all they have and that they have not been an issue for guests in the past. 


""I don't give a shit about OTHER guests"" yeah we know, ""it is YOUR job to make sure that you have seating for all body types"" you mean giant whale-lords like yourself?

Again, the gentle and respectful driver advises the Mr. FFF that these are the only spaces available and reserved for people in wheelchairs, the couple with the wheelchair, meanwhile, giving undeserved apologetic and empathetic looks to Mr. and Mrs. Triple O Sauce. 


Finally, after holding up the bus for another 10 minutes arguing with the driver and then over the phone with the driver's manager, Mr. FFF agrees to make a concession: his wife will move to another seat at the back of the now full buss, and allow the handicapped woman to wheel her chair into the seat beside him, and the lady's husband can go and sit somewhere else. 


Fat Privlege is telling loyal, caring handicapped couples to go fuck themselves on bussses in Mexico. 



They pulled a lot more shit during the rest of the week I was fortunate enough to be able to report for you guys. Will post soon.

So I'm just going to skip the intro and get right to it. ~~So I was mowing the lawn~~ I was walking home with this girl, Miranda (168cm 54kg) after swimming and having fun in this woodland lake that is less than 5 minutes walking distance from where I live. We're talking and laughing. We go to the backyard to sit in the sun and have some Swedish Fika™ It was getting late and the sun had gone down, I start hearing a whale song, but I soon realized it was just The Manatee saying ""Hey baby, I'm here now! Why did you want me to wear this?^Teehee"" As she said that she was coming around the corner in a ~~tarp~~ bathrobe and in what you and I would call a tent, but what she would call ""lingerie"". She then goes full retard, which you never do, and yells for Miranda to stop molesting me. Now in The Manatees defense, I would probably do the same thing if I saw a guy having his hand on my imaginary girlfriend which is only my girlfriend in my delusions, leg. Now before I could react Miranda shoots up gets in The Manatees face and yells very loudly ""HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU, YOU FAT CUNT! YOU NEED TO FUCKING LEAVE!"" and gives her a slight push. She starts blubbering and waddles off.

A few minutes later the cops roll up asking if we are the ones who called about a boy being molested. I knew exactly what happened, but before I could speak The Manatee comes up behind them and says that Miranda was molesting me and when she was caught by the Manatee, she pushed and threatened the poor little sea creature if she ever told anyone. I quickly say this is not true and that I have reported the sea cow to the police for harassing me and a neighbor. And how she had come over planning on harassing me again when she saw I was with Miranda and stormed off and must have called you. They check out my story and see that I have indeed filed a report against her and they believe me instead. The Manatee waddles home quickly with the police in a tiring pursuit. An hour later the police left, by this time Miranda had also left and I was home alone. It was maybe another 20 minutes before I heard a knock on the door. I know I should have expected this, but I didn't. It was the Manatees mother, again.

She goes on about how the police are making things up again and that I need to set things straight and tell the truth without being manipulated by skinny whores. She says I must have been manipulated so much that I dont know which way is up anymore and invites me over for a *snack* to help me. I say no, please leave. She asks me why I would be afraid our relationship and why if I'm not being manipulated, would I cheat on her precious little Manatee. I say again we have never been in a relationship and that I've not even kissed one of these ""whores"". And this is where the Manatee went full retard^2. Siv tells me that she knows I am lying now as her precious sea cow told her I was grinding all over Miranda and kissing her like I was trying to suck out her soul. I just bertstare her and close the door, she yells ""Just tell the truth for once!"" and leaves."	t5_2vzax	True

Eric and I met with our landlady to ask if there was any way to have Ginger kicked out after Eric's birthday. Our landlady, a little old religious seventy year old woman who seemed way nicer when I first met her, listens to our story with disbelief, says there's nothing she can do and we should all just try to make amends. ""That sweet girl?"" she said, when we told her how Ginger was sexually harassing Eric and eating all our food. Our landlady didn't believe us as she and Ginger were church buddies, and that forever endeared Ginger to her. She laughed when we said Ginger had been sneaking to Eric's bedroom and said: ""Girls can't rape boys, honey."" Well, fuck you. We pretty much knew there was no hope after that. Ginger had also let it slip to our landlady that Eric was an atheist, and I suspect she was less sympathetic towards Eric because of it.

Ginger fact: Ginger didn't like facial hair on her men. Eric, a very hairy Swede, seemed to be the exception. He shaved every morning, and would have a blond five o'clock shadow by noon. Hearing about her aversion to a non-baby smooth face Eric starts to grow a badass mountain beard. It works to repel Ginger until Eric is forced to shave by his boss.

Luke and I get back together a week after the birthday dinner, once he calmed down enough to let me explain what Ginger omitted about my sleepovers in Eric's room. Luke still wasn't crazy about it. He was no longer friendly with Eric after that and I had to promise I wouldn't sleep in Eric's room anymore. The good thing was, we could start keeping groceries in Luke's kitchen again. It was really awkward to ask your ex if he could keep stashing your deli meats in his refrigerator.

Don't think I'd forgotten about Ginger though. I was plotting my revenge. Yuri, Eric, and I avoided her like the plague, refused to speak with her, and just glare at her whenever we made any eye contact. Ginger acted like the whole birthday dinner and her unsuccessful seduction never happened. When she learned that Yuri told a friend at school what Ginger did, she yelled at him, furious that he was ""spreading lies about her."" Yuri, at this point, was spending more and more nights at Scott's because he was tired of dealing with her.

Around Thanksgiving, the opportunity to get back at Ginger presented itself. Everyone was leaving for the weekend. Yuri and I were going to be driving home to our parents in Texas. Eric didn't keep contact with his family, but Scott had invited him to spend Thanksgiving at his place. Ginger was being picked up by her parents.

Yuri and I were the last to leave. I'd planted the evidence, and now I wanted to watch it all unfold. Listening to them talking, I find out that Ginger's parents think Ginger and Eric are dating. ""It's such a shame that we missed your boyfriend. You should have invited him home with us,"" I heard Ginger's mother saying to Ginger. Ginger was about to walk out the door with her parents, when I yelled at them to wait. This was the first time I initiated a conversation with Ginger in weeks, so she stopped. Her and her parents turned to look at me as I held out the negligee that Ginger had worn the night of Eric's birthday. ""I didn't want you to forget this, Ginger."" I found it in the trash ^tee ^hee.

Ginger's reaction was amazing. She gasped, her milky white face turning into a deep shade of pink. She was dressed demurely to go home, a collared shirt and long skirt. No slutty clothes in front of her parents. Her Daddy looked outraged. ""That's not my daughter's!"" he said. Ginger's father is a male, older, fatter version of his daughter. It was like a vision into the future. Ginger always called him about her roommate problems, so he did not like me or Yuri. Especially Yuri. Ginger's mother just laughed, saying ""It was clearly a joke."" Ginger agreed to this really quickly and insisted that the lingerie was mine, until I spread out the negligee, showing how it was about 10x my size and just the right fit for their daughter.

Furthermore, Yuri ""accidentally"" opened one of Ginger's bags and let a DVD and a few adult mangas fall out in full-view of Ginger's parents. The anime porn belonged to Ginger, but no she did not pack it in her bag. That courtesy was all mine. Ginger began to stutter while her parents looked at her, horrified. Her Daddy looked like he was going to pop a vein in his forehead. Pointing at me, Ginger started crying hysterically. ""Lulu makes fun of me all the time, Daddy! She says I'm fat and no one's ever going to love me! She's jealous that I have so many friends and she's a loser! She's having sex with different boys every night and trying to seduce my boyfriend! That stuff's not mine, it's hers! Lulu's sick and a pervert!"" Bullshit after bullshit. Ginger's parents look like they want to believe their sweet, virginal daughter, but also as if they knew she was capable of having such atrocities. Yuri and I decide to leave because it was getting pretty late, to the sounds of Ginger's crying and her parents yelling at her. It was the happiest we'd been in weeks. On the drive to our parents, Yuri and I texted Eric about what happened. He said the beauty of it brought a tear to his eye. 

Coming up next: Ginger's parents tighten the purse strings, confiscate all her anime porn and slutty new wardrobe, just in time for Christmas. [Pt. 6](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1izk9n/my_year_with_ginger_pt_6_one_leaves_the_nest/)"	t5_2vzax	True
1375924482.0	1jxbbw	An ex-Navy Seal, a Hamnebula and a gas station attendant.	luker_mostly	936	172	146	"Hello fellow beetuses (beeti?). This will be a brief story of an encounter last night that made a minimum wage job near-bearable. No jimmies need rustle today. 

I am a gas station attendant in oregon, meaning I pump people's gas for them. It's law here. 

Last night, an old man rolls into the gas station with a 40 foot+ giant toyhauler/trailer, hops out and just starts lighting up the joint with loud, infectious, almost belligerent happiness. The guy is full of energy and sporting a greystache worth 'mirin. I ask him where he's headed, and this elicits a 2-minute soliloquy about his life:

""I was a navy seal, Son, then I got blowed up, and now I'm headin' out to drive dune buggies with mah buddies up near Caynadah. Only drugs keep me movin nawdays boyah!"" 

[This Guy](http://popcultureasylum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fixit.jpg)

Already he's made my night with his infectious, probably opiate-painkiller-infused charm. I go to pump his gas, and open the door... 

only to find her, waiting, in the dark. 

Too large to fit through the door normally, she's positioned 90 degrees to it, cane in hand, mumu-dress-bedsheet draped over a fupa that sticks out a good 3 feet. She rasps at me as she passes, ""BATHROOM?"" 

I point, then quickly run to pump the ex-Seal's fuel as he tells me that the shit he pulled in Mogadishu is classified and the movie got it all wrong.

As I'm pumping his gas, manateewoman belugas back out of the store *screaming* about our lack of a handicap rail, that our toilets are *too small*. I've told mr. ex-Seal that I have to pump his gas slowly, our pumps suck and it'll overflow otherwise, so I might have to leave and get other customers started. 

Ex-Seal: ""SON, your'e doin' yer JAWB, you leave t'other ones ta ME!"" 

[Godfuckyes](http://www.prnewsonline.com/water-cooler/2013/05/16/leadership-enhancement-a-mind-meld-with-captain-kirk/attachment/captain-kirk-in-rurnabout-intruder-james-t-kirk-8614095-700-530-2/)

As we continue to bullshit about motorsports, assassinations and other Seal-stuff, Hamplanet begins bellowing for... something? Neither of us can make it out. The minivan is creaking as she rocks back and forth in angry agitation. Her poor husband sits dejected, grayfaced, staring at the asphalt. The ex-seal inhales the last half of his cigarette in one breath, transfixed at the rocking van. He flicks it to the ground and begins marching her way. 

From behind the trailer, all I hear is the seal's deep growl. 

""How can I hep ya mem?!?

...

He's over there, DOIN 'IS JOB, PUMPIN MAH GAS, Mem!

...

D'ya need something? Or are ya just gun bitch cuz yer can't fit on the shitter?!""

Engine revs

Minivan scrapes into the distance, sparks spraying with every high spot in the road

Ex-navy man marches up again, tells me to ""keep up the good work, sahn, and don't believe jack shit ya read bout Mogadishu,"" 

Jumps into giant diesel truck and swerves out of station

1371930675.0	1gvcyh	Hamplanet Roomie: The Nightmare Waddles	GoAskAlice	952	185	131	"Alright, you lovely people. First of all, I have to say that you've definitely gotten me to eat better. Another week of reading this, and I'll be out riding my broke-ass bike with my broke-ass back. It's gonna hurt but fuck it. I'm not a hamplanet, but I was heading that way, and y'all stopped me. I swear some of these stories put me off greasy/fatty foods forever. 

So I had this situation. I was living with a guy who beat up my dog. Red flags went up everywhere. Gotta get the fuck out NOW. Couldn't take the dog - he was a greyhound that I rescued from the track, and I could only afford tiny places and worked too much - so I placed him at a farm with a bunch of other greyhounds. He gets to run; he's happy.

Okay. Dog's happily rehomed. And now? Need to get the fuck out of here myself before this twit takes it into his head to attack me. Some chick I knew also wanted to move. K. Let's get a place. 

Terrible mistake. I moved in with a hamplanet full of fatlogic. She was about 5'5"" and about 350 pounds. Everyone exaggerates here, I am making an effort not to do so. This chick looked like she'd melted or something. 

Walkthrough, checking out new digs: she wants the big bedroom with balcony access. Told her no. I'm a smoker; I need balcony access. Also I have like a dozen plants. Also, your credit sucks, Abby, they're only letting us in here based on mine. Also, I'm the one with an actual job. Besides, Abby, your room has the private bathroom. 

She sulkily conceded. WTF, man, the big bedroom only had like 4 square more feet. Didn't matter, she complained about it for*ever*. 

Move in: got all my shit in within 3 hours. Took one pickup. Couple of trips. Traded my smoker grill for the help. Still miss that thing. Another 2 hours, it's all set up; pics on the walls, everything. I can be extremely efficient. 

Her move in: apparently, she's got an entire goddamn warehouse stuffed in some rent-a-space. Biggest fucking U-Haul truck possible pulled up. And here's where the fatlogic starts to shine, O my brothers. 

She took one tiny box in, then hid in the kitchen. 

&gt;teehee gotta arrange things! 

 - meaning, she took my coffeemaker and stuffed it in the closet. When I asked her why:

&gt; I need the space on the counter for my electric can opener!

Do you not know how to open a can or something?! Look here, I have a manual can opener. 

&gt; it's too harrrrrd!

&gt; *bitch, you cannot be serious.*

She was serious.  

Mind you, this whale was on unemployment. I wasn't. And I wanted my goddamn coffee. I had to go to work in the morning and *I want my fucking coffee!* 

So there we all were, sweating our asses off in the Texas summer sun, unloading a huge truck full of her shit, and she's hiding in the kitchen. Arranging stuff. Uh huh. 

YO ABBY get down here and pick up a box!

&gt; tee hee, I can't, I have a condition

Bitch, I have a broken back, and here I am hauling your heavy-ass shit up two flights of stairs. What possible condition could stop you from helping us haul your shit? 

&gt; I have low blood sugar, I might faint! 

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN MIND?!

&gt; I'll order us some pizza! 

disbetterbegud.jpg

Then she made us all chip in. This is not how these things work. If people are moving your shit, you feed and water them, not the other way around. We were tired and hungry and just threw money in her general direction, fuck it. Just have some pizza and soda here when we're done.

Thirty minutes later, see pizza guy stagger upstairs with a ton of stuff. 

somethingtolookforwardto.mov

Two hours later, six of us collapse, sweaty, dehydrated, exhausted, and starving, on the living room floor, of which there is very little left because this bitch apparently owned half the fucking world. Boxes boxes everywhere; I am not exaggerating when I say that there were walkways between towering piles of boxes. What the fuck. All in the living room, of course, because for some odd reason having to do with her specialness, we couldn't pile anything in her bedroom. Except her piece of shit mattress. So. I can no longer use my living room until she gets all this shit out. *Spectacular.*

We hollered for our pizza and drinks, because if you're going to hide in the goddamn kitchen all day while we slave away for you, then you'd best be making with the waitressing -  and

she brought out HALF of a medium cheese pizza. That's 3 slices. She also brought out glasses of water. 

What the actual fuck, Abby. Was this the most expensive pizza in all of history? 

Drag myself up, go look. Nope. Three other pizza boxes and several 2L bottles of soda piled on the balcony, leaning on my plants. All the damn soda was gone. 

&gt; tee hee, I got hungry and thirsty! It's hard work setting up a kitchen! 

&gt; the kitchen was already set up. That's all MY shit. Which I washed and put away yesterday. Kitchen looks no different except my coffeemaker's been replaced by a motherfucking electric canopener. 

&gt; well, I had to make sure! teehee

isthisbitchforreal.png

We just stared at her. Then, too tired to argue, we started to eat. And I am not lying: she took one of the three pieces. Everyone was so stunned by this and by being heatsick and exhausted, nobody said a word. We shared out our 2 pieces among the six of us and everyone bailed the fuck out to go find some food, leaving me with this selfish cunt. They asked me to go and I said, ""nah, it's cool, I have some stuff"" - was also broke and too proud to admit it. Costs a lot to get a new place, especially when new roomie's credit is so shot that the apartment complex and every utility refuses to deal with her, so I had to shell out. Dem deposits. No money for two weeks. But fuck it. I bought groceries. 

Checked the fridge after she waddled off to bed with a smug smirk on her beady-eyed doughy face. 

All my stuff was gone. Nothing. Left. I had stocked that sucker to the point where my half was packed. I was amazed that even the veggies were gone. She didn't even leave me a fucking single radish. I stood there in shock. There was only my Brita pitcher of water, which she'd used to give water to everyone and had maybe a centimeter left. You've gotta be fucking kidding me, you can't even refill a Brita pitcher?! Was that toooo harrrrd too? Jesus H Lazybitch Christ. 

Looked at the sink. Did she cook? Welp. Apparently she did. There are all my pans, all with horrific scratches in them. And filthy. Didn't even rinse them. HOW THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE. HOW DO YOU COOK ALL MY FOOD WITHOUT US SMELLING OR SEEING? AND DESTROY MY BRAND-NEW COOKWARE?! HOWWWWW?! 

HOW IN THE LIVING HELL DO YOU TAKE ALL OF OUR MONEY FOR FOOD WHILE WE'RE WORKING OUR ASSES OFF FOR YOU, EAT THREE AND A HALF PIZZAS, DRINK 5 2L BOTTLES OF SODA, EMPTY THE MOTHERFUCKING FRIDGE, NONE OF WHICH BELONGED TO YOU, AND THEN TAKE 1/3 OF THE LAST REMAINING PIZZA, AND THEN LEAVE ALL YOUR SHIT IN A FUCKING CORNER AND **THEN** NOT EVEN FUCKING REFILL THE WATER PITCHER, THE SINK IS *RIGHT THERE NEXT TO THE FRIDGE* HOLY CHRIST. 

I showered off and went to bed hungry, already knowing that this was a huge mistake. 

&gt;whatthefuckamIgonnadonow.txt

Before you call me beta, wait till you hear the rest. There's a happy ending. Eventually. This is long enough already. This bitch made my life a living hell for 3 months; there's plenty more, trust me. I lump all her laziness in with fatlogic, because honestly? That's what I see fatlogic as, convoluted mental exercise taking the place of actual work. Not all of the Abby stories will be fatlogical, unless you take it in the context that her fatlogic permeated her entire miserable ""it's too harrrd"" life. This cunt was the epitome of fatlogic. Heaven forbid she ever stir her ass to do anything harder than waddle over to the motherfucking fridge and eat an entire tub of ice cream. Which I saw happen. Could not believe my eyes. 

This was only the first day....

Today I share the mystery of the normal-size fatty.  Prepare a nice snack, and settle in . . .

&gt;Be me, middle aged, single woman, looking for Mr. Right on okcupid.

&gt;Get messaged by a bigger guy, maybe 250 lbs, but cute face and funny profile, decide to go for it.  We'll call him PieGuy. 

&gt;We agree to meet for pie. Yummy, delicious pie. (former fatty myself)

&gt;MFW I see him in person and he's not a fatty at all. He explains hadn't got around to taking pics recently- as in, since he got normal-sized. 

&gt;PieGuy is cute and funny in person. We talk. He had weight loss surgery about 6 months before.  Thatexplainsit.jpg

&gt;We split a slice of pie. This is great, I think, I can have a a nice taste without overdoing it.

&gt;MFW he explains what happens when he eats more than a few bites of fatty food. (google ""dumping syndrome"" if you have a strong stomach). Next date, he explains that half slice was too much, had horrible consequences. Orders same thing again. 

&gt;But hey, surgery worked, drastic times call for drastic measures, etc

&gt; a few dates later, sexytiems acomin'

&gt;go to his place. Offers me something to drink. Opens fridge. A ketchup bottle, Bud Light (yuck!) and a case of Ensure. 

&gt; his doctor says he needs more protein, but he can't handle digesting meat, and besides, cooking is a pain. So he drinks Ensure a few times a day. 

&gt;but he's so happy, the surgery made his alcohol tolerance so low he's drunk and giddy from a single light beer!

&gt;in fact, he says, his counselor has already warned him about how he's just substituting his food addiction for alcoholism -.-

&gt;but enough, time for the sexyness. He puts his arms around me, begins thrashing them around my body like there's a spider in my clothes and he's gonna crush it.

Ok, a little over-eager, but I'm damn good looking, it is understandable, right? Wait, I'm not actually that good looking.  :/

&gt;He squeezes a boob like /r/popping squeezes zits. Luckily, it doesn't pop

Umm, ok . . .

&gt;I decide to take control a minute, let him calm down. Lick penis. He immediately comes. 

Whaaaattt. 

&gt;He gives his shame-faced back story. PieGuy married his high school sweetheart. She didn't like sex. Also, they were both over 350 lbs, there wasn't much they could do together without their bellies getting in the way.   He's never been with another girl. He  hated her for years, but couldn't leave her when he was fat because what other woman would have him?

&gt;I'm the  2nd woman he's done anything sexual with.  He's fumbling like a teenager because that's the last time he tried this. 

Thin privilege is hitting 40 with more than one sexual partner under your belt. 
 
&gt;We eventually get to penetration. He's amazed at what positions are possible when there aren't two refridgerator-sized stomachs in the way. Also, ""wow, I don't have the fat pad at the base of my penis anymore, I basically just gained an inch of length on my dick!""

Thin privilege is having the base of your penis accessible, instead of guarded by rolls of pubic fat. 

&gt;next date, proudly shows fridge has been filled. Is he learning how to eat healthy? No, it's all junk- frozen corn dogs, Capri Suns, Hot Pockets, ice cream and candy. But still, better than living on Ensure, right? Nope, he explains the food is for his kids. 

I had friended him on fb at this point, so I saw pics of the kids. They  are gigantic. Cute faces barely visible through rolls and rolls of blubber. 

&gt;I gently suggest that the nutrition classes he was required to take for the surgery could point him toward making better food choices for the kids at least, even it was too much work for him. 

&gt;MFW he explained that the kids don't like healthy food, if he doesn't buy them junk and plenty of snacks they whine. 

&gt;MFW he hasn't even tried to discuss nutrition with them. I think his plan is to have their stomachs stapled too. 

When last I saw him, he had still learned nothing about eating properly, had decided exercise wasn't necessary since he was skinny, and was getting a good portion of his calories from alcohol. He's not gonna make it.

So I live in Florida and this week it was quite hot. I live in a house with an in ground pool in the back. I had a half day of work today because my boss had a funeral to go to. [MFW](http://replygif.net/i/203.gif) half day of work!

Now on to the story...

&gt; Be me, 165 pound guy, not at all fat, just tall with a (little) bit of muscle

&gt; Do not be: Fat

&gt; Get home from work. It is hot as hell so I suit up and decide to go swimming

&gt; Walk into backyard and freeze

&gt; Had only been home for 5 minutes, first time I'm seeing the pool

&gt; My personal pool is currently occupied

&gt; This *woman* is about 5'5 and quite rotund, I'd say about 280 lbs.

&gt; Wearing a tiny winy black and green bikini

&gt; It is NOT working for her.

&gt; What are yu doin here? she drawls

&gt; I ignore the question

&gt; Excuse me? Get the fuck out of my pool, this isn't fuckin Disney World, This is my house

&gt; But Its hooot...

&gt; At this point I'm ready to strangle this woman, I don't give a flying fuck if it's hot. If the pavement had been melting I still wouldn't of let her in the water

&gt; Get OUT of my pool! I scream at her

&gt; Excuse meh! she bellows, But this aint fare, why do you get t'have a pool to yurself. At (local public pool), theyr turnin people away because theres no more space. I have a disbility, and my legs need to take a load off

&gt; I paid for this pool! I said, get the fuck out fatass, and lose some weight, blubber is quite insulating!

&gt; You cant just discrmiate against meh, Just cause Im bigger dont mean you can kick meh out. If I wer skinny youd be fine with me swimmen here

&gt; Excuse me but this isn't about your rolls! I say. Go lay in your bathtub, or turn on the AC and stay off my property

&gt; She's yelling now ""YOU FATHATER, I'M GONNA TELL SO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT YOU

&gt; I pick up her large tent like articles of clothing and soak them in pool water before wrapping them in a rock andthrowing them over my fence. She'll either have to climb the fence or walk *all* the way around it to get them. The gate is padlocked

&gt; This gets her out of the water

&gt; She waddles to the end of the fence and looks at her stuff, then runs to the gate, of course it is padlocked.

&gt; You have to get mah stuff! She bellows

&gt; You stealer! You are gunna have to pay fer this.

&gt; I start to walk away as she badgers me.

&gt; I walk out the open gate and begin to walk around, she follows to make sure I don't set anything on fire I guess.

&gt; As she leaves the gate I sprint back and close it behind me

&gt; She waddles back up and grabs at the latch.

&gt; [MFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljh4hdXcnY1qixleeo1_500.gif) I don't have a padlock for this gate (Thats how she got in) and she could eat my fingers)

Well, as I said in previous posts, I would post some of the most horrific stories I heard from the colleagues that worked with Lard lover. Today, I've picked out the two most plump, juicy stories for your reading pleasure. There's five years of pent up frustration from 50+ people to get out, so stop your salivating and eat it up.

Well, lets begin then!

First is the tale of Lard Lover when she was first hired into her position that, as far as I can tell, had something to do with book keeping. No one could really tell me exactly what she *did*, and her personal file didn't specify a position beyond ""Finance"".

**This quip will be told from the position of GuitarLover, a musician accountant who worked in her department.**

&gt;Sittin' down, thinking about guitars

&gt;Damn, should actually do some work

&gt;Hey, the new hire is coming in today. Should be able to help finish these projects. Always good to have extra hands on the team

&gt;Oh innocence was so sweet...

&gt;""Wait... I ONLY get some shitty CUBICLE? And this chair is DEFINITELY not made for people with MY disability""

Authors note: apparently she had been claiming her disability was real ever since she walked in the damn office, unbeknownst to HR, or myself, until this story was relayed to me.

&gt;Don't look up... 

&gt;Don't look up...

&gt;Don't look up...

&gt;""Even HE gets to have a nicer cubicle than mine! Why on EARTH is this office so DISCRIMINATORY?""

&gt;First impressions made on the entire office are just *great*

&gt;Have a nice cubicle because of hard work, and keeping equipment well

&gt;""I DEMAND to speak with the Dept. Head""

&gt;10min shouting match with her new Dept. Head, as the HR lady who brought her through scampers for her sanity, in the calmness of the lift

&gt;Over hear words like ""Discrimination"", 'Women's rights"" and ""Disability""

&gt;She waddles proudly to her new office, an empty space meant for the next person to be promoted

&gt;Welp, no one will be putting in over time to get a 1.5% pay rise and no office anymore

So, that explained why on earth she managed to get the office. She was had swindled that Dept. Head into thinking she was disabled for some unknown reason, and made sure no one ever fucked with her position there, with vague threats of legal action... which brings us to our next story...

**This one will be told from the perspective of CardioBunny, another accountant who was on her floor, but thankfully a little further away.**

&gt;Be talking to Dept. Head about some project

&gt;Gotta stay on target

&gt;Flaunting that thin privilege with well fitting business clothes and some nice, new pumps

&gt;loomingdoom.jpg

&gt;Door slams open, causing the door handle to smash through the wall

&gt;""I'M HERE TO TALK TO [DEPT. HEAD] REGARDING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN THIS WORKPLACE""

&gt;Turns out Lard Lover had been sending her brother through to the bosses as a 'lawyer' to threaten them every time her work ethic was mildly criticized

&gt;Hell, she didn't even work at this point

&gt;""There have been some MAJOR infringements against my client, in regards to work practices here. Do you know how much it will cost you in court when I reveal to them you're discriminating against Lard Lover""

&gt;CardioBunny still in the room, trying to leave as subtly as possible

&gt;Manage to make it to safety

&gt;Pass Lard Lover's office, who is standing at her door, smiling smugly

&gt;""Oh CardioBunny, I think the office would appreciate it if you stopped wearing such revealing clothing. And those shoes can not be good for you! They don't match your outfit at all""

&gt;""I'll take that on board, Lard Lover. While we're at it, why don't you clean the junk out of your office? And actually hit those work targets we've all been set?""

&gt;After having two kids, CardioBunny is not easily swayed, nor fucked with

&gt;Get to desk with some coffee, actually get down to work for a while

&gt;Dept. Head grumbles in

&gt;""Damn it. CardioBunny, that lawyer did a double take through my office. He has made a formal complaint about your conduct towards Lard Lover, and now we're probably going to have to change the office dress policy""

&gt;Banter away about how to deal with the situation, not yet knowing that the 'lawyer' is fake

&gt;No one bothers to check his information for 8 bloody years

&gt;Finally get back to work, go home, and have a lovely sleep

&gt;Get to work the next day

&gt;Whole company memo about dress standards

&gt;Shirts must only have one button from the neck undone, no more

&gt;No shirts showing cleavage, must have sleeves coming past the elbows

&gt;No skirts above the knee

&gt;Foundation only as make up

&gt;No high heals above 6cm

&gt;No more Casual Fridays

Apparently CardioBunny, after her years of service, and never having any complaints made against her, was bested by a fake lawyer trying to fake sue a real company for discrimination against a fake disability. I found this story out by asking why on earth our dress standards were so strict compared to most companies I had worked for previously. 

So, now I'm off to have some dinner and get ready to go back to work tomorrow. Hopefully I'll coax some more stories out of people over the week to feed you on my lazy afternoons. I do know she has had a few people fired, and the amount of justice she felt due to my hands was definitely not enough to make up for the things she fucked up. But I do hope you enjoy these little quips.

Ginger's parents stay in town for two nights after Thanksgiving weekend. Their reason? To go through Ginger's bedroom and see how far their little princess had derailed from the path of moral righteousness. Ginger's new wardrobe of see-through tops, mini-skirts, and fishnet stockings were given to charity, and her adult books and movies were trashed. I was nice enough to volunteer to place those depraved, sinful objects in the dumpster for them. Or so Ginger's parents thought. Wearing gloves, Yuri and I went through the pornography- Ginger had amassed herself quite the collection. Most of it was hentai, but there were some pretty hot titles in there. (I, of course, did not keep any of this vile pornography for my own personal use. And if I did, I washed my hands and the DVD case profusely.) Our favorite pastime turned into quoting the titles of said pornography to Ginger if she bitched about something to one of us.

&gt;""Lulu, why didn't you cook dinner for me like you did for Eric and Yuri?""
&gt;""Sorry Ginger, I was too consumed by *Island Fever* for tuna fish to leave you any.""

&gt;""Yuri, what happened to the leftover cake from Lulu's birthday? I was going to finish it tonight.""
&gt;""Scott and I used it last night to recreate *All Star Cream Pies*."" 

The fun didn't end there. Ginger's mother tasked Eric and I the duty of becoming Ginger's moral guardians. If Ginger behaved or said anything that was in any way unChristian, we had to call her or Ginger's Daddy ASAP. We tried to refuse, but she kept insisting until we said yes, although we had no intentions of following up on that plan. By that time, they already found out that Ginger was lying to them about Eric being her boyfriend, but Ginger's mother insinuated that if Eric had any interest at all in their daughter, they wouldn't mind it one bit. 

&gt;""My, aren't you a handsome, hard-working young man! It's no wonder our Ginger likes you so much! You feel free to come over with Ginger for Christmas so we can introduce you to the rest of the family!"" 

Ginger's mother looked a little insulted that her daughter's future husband turned her down without any hesitation whatsoever and fled the room in fear. 

But, the good times had to end. The end of the semester and finals were coming up, so we were all getting a bit frantic. Yuri and I shut ourselves in our bedroom and spent all our spare time cramming. Eric almost drove himself to exhaustion studying and working. Ginger wasn't spared either. For all her laziness, malice, and casual disregard for anyone but herself, she actually made decent grades. But her parents were watching her bank statement like hawks and they'd significantly reduced her grocery budget. Ginger always bought all the expensive frozen meals and name-brand Oreos before, now she'd taken to stress-eating generic mallomars and whatever frozen pizza was on sale. Stress-eating Ginger and normal eating Ginger were apparently very different things. Normal eating Ginger had four meals a day (each a nutritious blend of frozen fried chicken, pasta alfredo trays, Kids Cuisines) and snacks in between those meals. Stress-eating Ginger did not stop shoveling food in her mouth. Her post-finals shit was really special. That was when Eric stopped sharing a bathroom with her and using mine and Yuri's.

The atmosphere in the house got better after finals had gone by. Everyone had passed their exams, and the holidays always cheered me up. None of us were talking to Ginger, but we were almost polite to her by mid-December. When everyone started leaving for winter break, Yuri even told her to have a safe drive home. Mistakenly, I thought that this was progress. Yuri had invited Scott to spend Christmas day with us in our hometown. Eric was invited too, but had to stay in town for work. I spent a week with my boyfriend's family upstate before going home and joining them. That was when Yuri dropped a bombshell on me. He was moving out of our apartment. He'd talked to the landlady, and when we went back to school in January he was moving in with Scott.

""I can't handle living with that monster anymore. I'm sick of smelling crap everyday and hiding my food,"" he said. ""I don't want to be arrested for maiming that bitch if she tries something again."" Yuri had been planning his leaving for a while. He waited for me to find out if financial aid was going to come through for my spring semester tuition before he made his final decision, because I would not have been able to handle both tuition and our share of the rent on my own. I should have seen it coming, but I felt blindsided and betrayed. I didn't talk to Yuri again until after school started, and only after he bribed me with mint Milanos and Starbucks. Eric was shocked too, but more forgiving. He even joked that Yuri was smarter than both of us because he'd figured a way out of our home sweet home. Boy, was Eric right.

Ginger was just biding her time. I thought exposing her in front of her parents would bring her to submission. It turns out, the beast was lying in wait. Ginger had been humiliated and was now forced to wear long-sleeved sweaters and calico skirts again. I should have known that all those times she was smiling at me, pretending not to be a heinous bitch, she was waiting for her moment to strike. But I'll get to that later.

1373656495.0	1i67m6	Thin Privilege is not getting your car spray-painted when you park in a construction site...	correctbutuseless	941	196	76	"So no green text, not at that level yet.    
Backstory:  
I used to be a painting/renovations contractor before I got into real estate, and I occasionally take up jobs for friends/business partners when I have time.  
One of my friends owns a high end autobody shop, I'll call him BSB for Body Shop Brew (he's South African).  Since I do enjoy my high end autobodies, I proposed that he do a 200 hour restoration and paint job on my classic Bentley (it's worth about the same as new Toyota Corolla so don't get your 1% jimmies rustled, it's more of a top 25% car).  Instead of me paying him $20,000 or so for the work, I would rain screen and paint the exterior of his bodyshop.  Everyone wins, except the tax-bro.  
  
Side-note:  His shop is on a busy street, and I was only able to get a traffic control permit valid for one day from 9am to 5pm.  This allows me to block the parking lane in front of his shop plus 100' in each direction and control the outer lane of traffic.  This is important for the paint stage of the job, since application is by airless sprayer which essentially creates clouds of vapor and overspray, and will leave a light sugary dusting on a 100 foot radius, especially noticeable on parked cars....  Hence the blocked parking lane and traffic control.  
  
To get this job done in the allotted time, I had lined up the following:  
- A crew of 4 painters
- Two 60' boom lifts.  Like these:http://www.rent1.net/CMSuploads/product_images/210_2_image1.jpg  
  
I should note that the rental cost for these machines is around $1000 a day.  Each.  
- two large airless paint sprayers with a two hoses/guns each  
- four traffic control persons (flagmen for you social justice shamers)  
Each flagman costs around $30/hr all in.  Employment insurance is huge for these guys, since they get hit by cars a lot.  
  
So, everyone arrives at 7am and starts to get setup so we can start spraying at 9am exactly.  City bylaw WILL be there at 5pm sharp to shut us down, so no room for error.  
  
The flag-men set up cones every 5 feet with visibility tape between them, no stopping signs on street posts and large orange cans at each end.  The flag men stand one at each end of each lane just to be safe.  The booms sometimes need to enter the parking lane to turn, and I don't need to explain the consequences of a car ""tapping"" one with two guys 60' in the air.  
  
At 9am I sound the horn (I bought an air horn just for this, because I like loud noises) and the boys start spraying.  
  
The architect has spec'd out elastomeric, which is like paint on steroids.  It's very thick and is like covering your walls with tire rubber.  For this project, it's arctic white.  
  
About 11:30am, things are going well.  
But what's this?  Over the roar of two diesel engines and two gasoline sprayers I hear the sound of a car in its death throes.  The groan of fatigued metal, the squeak of high strength steel welds slowly being pulled apart, the drum of tires squeezed many times their load limit.  Is it an unlicensed contractor with 1000 lbs of drywall on the roof of his minivan?  Is an ambitious homeowner bringing home a bundle of re-bar in his station wagon?  
No.  
It is a black Mini Cooper leaning dangerously towards the drivers side - the camber impossibly out like it's been stanced.    Example:  
http://scrapedcrusaders.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mini1920.jpg  
  
As it approaches, I realized there is only one occupant.  The car slows down and stops in front of the row of pylons and begins honking the horn.  I approach cautiously - something is amiss.    
I recoil in horror as I look in the window.  A large portion of the car is taken up by the driver - the mass is centered over the driver's seat, but also covers the center armrest entirely.  Masses of flesh surround the steering wheel and god knows there was no air space in the footwell.    
  
In short, it's a very large woman.  I had a ""is this photoshopped?  But it's real life... Can't be"" moment.  She motions to the cones.  
""Move that stuff out of the way so I can park""  

""Sorry, the lanes are closed, we're working here""  

""You can't close the parking, the sign says I can park!  Now MOVE IT""  
  
""No, you need to park somewhere else, it's closed.  Call the city if you want to check my permit""  
&lt;Window closes&gt;  A minute goes past as she calls.  
  
""Whatever, that's bullshit.  Tell your guys to get out of the way.""  
  
To my amazement, she drives OVER the rubber cones, through the tape and parks in front of...the starbucks one lot over from the body shop.  
My flagman rushes up to her, trying to process this ""Ma'am, you can't park here, move it NOW""  
""FUCK OFF"" as she exits the car, heading for the store.  
She won't make eye contact with anyone.  Flagman loses it, hates unruly drivers.  
""Get your fatass back here""
Lady enters starbucks.  
My whole crew has stopped, watching this scene.  
It will take about 20 minutes for the tow truck to arrive, she might be gone by then.  
I'm not waiting for her.  Time is money.  
""Back to work everyone!""  Sprayers fire back up.  50 gallons per hour of thick, fast drying rubberized coating swirling everywhere.    
Thicker than usual.  Someone has turned up the pressure on the gun, which causes more over-spray.  The air is thick like a hot Beijing morning.  
  
The tow-truck is quick today, 15 minutes.  We shut off the machines for him, and he backs up to the car.  The door of the starbucks flys open, and the 300lb lady moves with unimaginable speed.  
""GET AWAY FROM MUH CURR""  The tow truck driver is a big, bearded pipe-swinging country boy but even he knows you don't mess around with wounded wild-life.  He backs off -   
As quick as she is getting to the car, even the cocktail of adrenaline and the 30oz of mocha frappucino coursing through her veins can't get her into the car with any great speed.  One leg up, huff, puff.  Second leg up, rest.  Move one leg over, rest.  Second leg over.  Drink from mocha frappucino.  Adjust thighs.  One buttock in position, then the other.  Shimmy around as the mass conforms to its vessel.  Door closed.  Engine start, metal creaks and tires sigh, she tears off as quickly as her mass will allow the overtaxed drivetrain.  She leaves, pulling about 300 feet of yellow tape behind and two cones under the car.    
  
And, the coupe de grace, conservatively 2 or 3 quarts of white elastomeric spread evenly over the black paint like confectionary sugar.  It's not coming of with polish or even sand paper.  We're talking bare metal re-spray boys...  

GTG, I'll post a part 2 and edit this later.

[Part two](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gvq3o/the_nightmare_waddles_part_ii/)

Okay! So here we are, in a flea and spider infested apartment that reeks of fat, unwashed slob on unemployment. 

Now, as condition of her continuing to receive said unemployment, she must weekly fax in proof of at least three jobs she's applied for. This was the only time she lived up to her agreement to drive my ass to work, since she needed the fax machine. She also would demand 20 bucks for gas money when she did, as per our agreement: she drives, I put gas in the car. Apparently, a single 2-mile drive per week constituted her end of the deal. I put up with it under the illusion that she'd use the gas to look for a job. 

Comes a week when she suddenly doesn't need to use my work's fax. Ask her about this.

&gt; the leasing office has a fax machine I can use

Um, okay. Welp. No gas money for you then. 

A bit more time goes by. 

Arrive home in my usual state of sweaty exhaustion from trudging two miles in 100+ heat, find her in kitchen with a ton of what I'm forced to call ""groceries"" although much of what she ate, I do not consider food. I do not have the world's most perfect diet, but I do at least try to stick with stuff that doesn't come out of a can, box, or bag. Odd, though, this sudden explosion of groceries. Enough food to last a normal person 2 months. Will prob be gone within a week. Whatever. 

Shower, get online, emails from friends in varying states of agitation. Turns out dear roommate had been using my computer all day to post shit, the Bitch Squad (myself and 4 other friends) discovered that today was her last unemployment check. Because this clueless dipshit saw fit to post about it and how she ran right out and spent it all on groceries because she knew I'd be asking for money for bills. 

What. 

Back to kitchen. Time to confront the landwhale in her natural habitat. 

&gt; yo. Electric bill's due, I need money from you. 

Considerable stammering and obfuscation and general dodge-and-weave on her part. None of that irritating ""tee hee"" shit this time. I know many of you think that ""tee hee"" is a sign of a fake story. I assure you, it is not. ""Tee hee"" appears to be some kind of lardass defense mechanism. Like if they use it, you have no choice but to think ""aw how cute"" and give them a pass on whatever egregious bullshit they're pulling or are about to pull. That cutesy little giggle drove me right up the fucking wall. 

Eventually: 

&gt; well, I don't have any money. I just spent it all on food. I HAD to, you never share! 

&gt; I never share? How can I? You eat all my food. Anything I buy is gone before sundown. Money. Now. 

&gt; I just TOLD you I don't have any! *said in whiny voice, like a goddamn toddler* 

&gt; When's your next check then? Next week, right? 

Finally she admits that she has no more unemployment. At which point I ever so testily inquired how that is possible, as I know for a fact it was supposed to run until the end of the lease.

I had her cornered in our tiny-ass kitchen, none of that ""storm off in high dudgeon"" crap she usually pulls when I confront her about something. Same damn thing happened every time. ""Yo, you gonna wash all these dishes you left? They've been here for two weeks."" ""QUIT HOUNDING ME!"" *ragequit the room, slam bedroom door*

WELL. It will surprise nobody in this sub to hear that she hadn't bothered to apply for any jobs, therefore there was no job-application proof to fax to the unemployment office, therefore she has managed to lose her unemployment. 

Something in my expression at this point scared the living shit out of her. 

&gt; SO. This means you've got a job then, right? 

&gt; ....no

&gt; so who's paying rent and bills then? 

&gt; you SAID when we moved in that you make enough to cover that! 

&gt; I...wait... what?! That's my general rule, never live someplace you can't afford on your own. That's in case of disaster, you selfish bitch, it was NOT meant to tell you that it's perfectly cool for you to quit doing anything whatsoever and let me support your fat ass! GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR.  

Hauled her fat ass off to the nearest big box store, and stood over her while she did a job application on their little computer thingy. She was told to come back the next day for an interview. She'll get the fucking job, they hire everybody, and she'll get a check three weeks down the line.

Come home next day. 

&gt; How'd the interview go?

&gt; oh *tee hee* I didn't go

*stormclouds begin to form over my head, lightning flickers*

&gt; .... explain this to me

&gt; I got distracted chatting online

&gt; say again?

&gt; I got distracted chatting online

&gt; You. Blew off the interview. Because you were fucking around online. On MY computer. Using the Net access I pay for. 

At this point I completely lost it. She was sitting in front of said computer at the time.

Kicked her the fuck out. Put a BIOS password on my machine. Fuck you, apparently you don't need to get online anymore, you're not using it to look for a fucking job are you? 

Taped a sign over the thermostat, which as usual, she'd set to 72. Because she has to be comfy, sitting in here all day, and it's not like SHE pays for it! This sign contained considerable cussing about people who don't pay bills or rent and who are not allowed to touch the thermostat, which I set back to 85.  

Trotted my ass over to the leasing office to have a chat. 

Come home to more emails from Bitch Squad. They found Flabby's LiveJournal, and guess what she had to say today? Apparently she's sunk in a pit of despair and it's all MY fault for hounding her to get a job and it's soooo harrrd to be unemployed. Three paragraphs of this shit. Also talked about suicide and said it'd be my fault if she did. I somehow doubted she'd do it. Would involve too much effort. Also, I have some experience with suicidal people and she was exhibiting exactly none of the usual behaviors. 

She posted this using MY computer and MY Net connection, mind you, instead of going to her goddamn interview. Bitch is so lazy, she couldn't even be bothered to use a shift key. 

If I knew I had no money coming in, personally I'd have been out the door and not come home till I found a job. ANY job. Not this precious angel! Noooo. She'd told me multiple times she couldn't possibly work a ""soul-sucking"" job. Like mine (data entry). ALL RIGHTY THEN. THAT'S PERFECTLY COOL, FLABBY, I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY, WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT, OF COURSE I WILL PAY FOR EVERYTHING. NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO YOUR HALF OF THE HOUSEWORK EITHER! THAT WOULD BE A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. PLEASE, EAT ALL MY FOOD TOO, IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED IT. I SHALL LIVE ON AIR AND EMPTY PROMISES. YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN YOUR MOUNTAIN OF FLAB AFTER ALL. WOULDN'T WANT YOUR BLOOD SUGAR TO GET LOW. (I heard this excuse more times than I could count, usually when inquiring what happened to my food) &lt;--- there's your goddamn fatlogic right there. She was ENTITLED to my food. She had a CONDITION! 

Fuck that shit. 

Meanwhile, back on the home front: 

I set out to make her life in that apartment as miserable as she'd made it for me. No you cannot has computer or thermostat. Or cable, called the cable company and got it canceled because fuck paying for her to sit her fat ass around watching TV all day. I don't watch it, so I don't give a happy fuck. Not a snob thing, it's just that most of it bores me. Dunno why.

Hounded her mercilessly for hours upon hours about bills, rent, and why the fuck do you have an entire raw chicken just sitting in the goddamn fridge for two weeks and have I mentioned the goddamn fleas and spiders this hour? Let's talk about the fucking fleas and spiders some more, shall we? You don't have a job, you don't even bother looking for one, so *certainly* you have plenty of time to do something about the motherfucking fleas, spiders, raw chicken, all these motherfucking boxes everywhere, the giant pile of filthy dishes in the sink - none of which are mine, seeing as I have no food because a certain fatfuck roommate kept eating it all so I quit buying any - the trash bags sitting by the front door (I seriously could not believe it... just to get the hell away from me, she took the trash out. To her car. And drove it to the dumpster in front of the next building over, less than 50 yards away. WHO DOES THAT.) and on and on and on and on. All the shit I'd been so politely requesting her to take care of. We are talking endless diatribe here, and I can yell at people for hours when so inclined. Believe me, I was inclined. Nothing in my life was as interesting just then besides yelling at her every second I was home. GOT A JOB YET, FLABBY? 

We are now 2 1/2 months into this mess. Two weeks to go!

Come Monday, parked my stereo right by my bedroom door. Put it on a death metal station, her least favorite music in the entire world. Cranked it as loud as it would go. Shut and locked my door and went off to work. Sleep till 2 in the afternoon now, bitch. 

I have been condensing the hell out of this, and I think I have one more to go. Wherein complete revenge is enacted and law enforcement gets involved. Will post that once I've gotten enough wine down the hatch; just typing this up has sent me into a nice little fit of rage and now I've gotta go punch the heavy bag in the garage a while and calm the fuck down.

Living in a fairly active city there are lots of bike trials for cyclists to enjoy just outside of town.

On my daily ride I began to notice the same man (~25 years old) riding the same trial as I do (not too advanced but still a nice workout) , I exchange a simple head nod and smile then continue on my way. 

This man will now be know as Bikebro, I couldn't guest his weight but lets just say he is a big guy, clearly unhealthy. 

I begin to notice Bikebro EVERY time I go riding, Bikebro never misses a day and goes full on everytime, no slacking. It brings a smile on every time I see his sweaty red face, he always smiles back and is friendly.

One day I am riding along the trial when I see Bikebro pushing his bike with a flat, not enough air and the stem had ripped (unpatchable) and we are quite a work from the exit/entry of the trials. 

Now I like Bikebro, he is not the typical feel sorry for me fatty and he is clearly dedicated trying to turn his health around. So I stop to help, being a long time cyclist I always carry a spare tube and a hand pump. 

While I am fixing Bikebros tire he begins to share basically his life story with me, how he has been a mess all his life and that he has been riding during his lunch breaks and to/from work to try and lose weight (Also along with a healthier diet). 

We talk from a bit and I tell him how I did similar to what he is doing and he seems to find motivation with my story. I think he just needed someone to talk to and I was happy to help. 

I finish with his tire and Bikebro thanks me like 20 times along with wanting to pay me for the tube, but I refuse since Im happy to help in his weight lose journey. Bikebro says he has to leave since he will be late to return to work and we continue on our ways. 

I still continue to see Bikebro when I ride and I am not worried about having to buy a new spare or spending 15 mintues helping the guy because I know that Bikebro and his sweaty red face are going to make it. 

* edit * since people are saying this doesn't fit the structure of a normal fat logic story let me add this, Bikebro told me he gained the weight when he was a kid and spent his teenage/collage (College, tee hee thanks /u/somethingpretentious) years in a mess of fat logic, beliving that being big meant he was tough and therefore didn't care what people thought of him, but now relizes he is just fat and scared of change. 

I like to think that just talking to him for those 15 with someone who was like him help him, probably would have liked to have the same talk when I first started.

In which we learn about some family history.

In early September, I had begun ""going steady"" with the guy I mentioned in the story previous to this. His name was Steve, and he was always kind of a smooth talker and consistently not good at answering my texts. And I don't text very often. I let him know after about two months  of on-and-off hooking up that I was finally done with my LSATs, and looking for a more long term, non-booty call based relationship. I said I'd be really interested in seeing him more often, but if that wasn't what he wanted, it was time to part ways. He pulled a really big show about wanting to be with me, and said he ""wanted to commit to being the best boyfriend possible."" 

Who's ready for a shocker; he turned out to be even more of an ass then I thought he was. About a month in, during which he answered my texts and had been, generally a good boyfriend, I got a message on Facebook from an ex of his, who he had been trying to sleep with recently. She sent me a screen shot of Steve Facebook-messaging her the day before asking if she was down to ""be fuck buddies again…and then some"". I was so upset; I felt humiliated for developing real feelings for him just to be bulldozed by some high school grade bullshit. I called him immediately, fought with him on the phone for two hours, then hung up when he told me to ""get over my daddy issues"". I went to work, shed not a single tear, got home, completely done. The next morning, after crying the whole night, I stayed in bed. I put on some Bon Iver like the dirty piece of hipster indie shit I am, and cried some more.  It was only Maggie and me and Andrew in the apartment. He had walked in before to awkwardly pat my head and offer me weed. Sasha was at out of town at her sister's, and John had slept over at his current girlfriend's house (which reminds me I need to tell you guys that story, too) 

Maggie knocked on my door somewhere halfway through my second run of ""For Emma, Forever Ago. She wanted to know if I got her emails. I told her I wasn't going to turn down the music. She looked me dead in the eye and told me Justin Vernon was a big ol' fatshamer, citing ""Skinny Love"" as a song PROVING he only liked ""skinny bitches"". It was so absurd I actually started laughing. She looked really offended, until she threw me an ugly glance, and realized I was upset. ""Are you crying? Does this have anything to do with you screaming on the phone last night?"" I ended up spilling the whole story to her, probably because it was the first in-person conversation I had about it with anyone. She was surprisingly sweet about it, asking questions and expressing SYMPATHY. I suspected this was great for her because she finally got to use those 3 classes in relationship psychology on me. I didn't even mind. I ended by  telling her about his ""daddy issue"" comment, which I had to explain, which led to a full fledge bonding moment. 

My biological dad died when I was in the fourth grade, and my mom took it really badly. He was killed by a drunk driver, so it was incredibly sudden. My mom had never been alone, or really *entered* the workforce. She married my dad at 19, had me at 20, and been a stay at home mom ever since. John's mom, Betty, who was our neighbor, started taking more and more care of me, because my mom wouldn't get out of bed on most days. John's dad left when he was a little kid, and his mom had to get a job and support three boys by herself.  Betty helped my mom get back on her feet, and gave her a job in her store until my mom got a more permanent job. John's mom is a big part of why my mom got better after being so depressed, and eventually met my stepdad, who is a great man. She's also the reason me and John are so close, and why i didn't fail the fourth grade. 

Maggie shared with me that her mom, who is a divorce attorney, divorced her cheating husband, and taught her little Maggie that all men are cheating scum, no exceptions. She took mine and John's family stories as more proof that her mom was right. First off, I told her my dad got killed by a drunk driver, but nope, she launched into a diatribe about men. Men this, men that. She told me that it was better to just be HAPPY for yourself. ""That's what I eat what I want. Did you know that your body actually retains weight if you are sad?""

""No. I didn't know that Maggie. Did you read that on Tumblr?""

""No, my mom told me. She knows what she's talking about. It's why me and her are so heavy, we just have heavy souls.""

""Okay, Maggie."" I curled up into a ball on my bed. 

"" Here's the thing, OP, Steve's a dick, so you just eat and be happy. It's like me and John.""

I sat up in my bed. ""Like… you and John?""

""Yeah. Sometimes he acts so into me, and other times, he's like… all over you and talking to you and things like that.""

""Maggie… I think you're making too big a deal of it. He's got a girlfriend. We are his friends.""

""That's your problem, OP, people like me and John can't *be friends*. It's too passionate. Love, hate, lust, power. Can't fight it.""

""Did you read that on Tumblr, Maggie?""

""Yeah. I'm going to get ice cream."" She hopped off my bed, galloped to the door, and then stopped. She turned around and stared at me.

""Yeah?""

""…Do you want some ice cream?""

""No, thanks Maggie.""

""Okay good, I was going to finish off that carton.""

""…Yeah, okay.""

I just bought that carton two days ago.

(That reminds me, I also have to tell you guys about grocery shopping. That'll be the next one)

I work in a pub and last weekend, due to a horse fair in my area there was a large traveller community there. For anyone who doesn't know who travellers are, they are groups of people who *traditionally* travel around without any fixed home. The Irish travellers who come to the horse fair bring their horses with them and a few came to our pub with them and tied up outside.

Cue a huge lady, 5""4 maybe 300lb, I'm not great at guessing weight but very very big, who I think due to her nationality maybe didn't understand exactly why the horses were there, begin attempting to climb onto one of the horses. Just casually walked over and tried to get on someone else's horse. I should also add that these horses weren't saddled in any way, they were tied to a carriage [this](http://www.elvincountry.com/travel-images/13208521.jpg), despite everyone telling her that 1, that wasn't a ""public horse"" if there even is such a thing, and 2 that she was far too heavy for him anyway. The lady decided to scream that she was ""trying to enjoy her holiday"" and that everyone was ""discriminating against her because of her weight."" Eventually her husband managed to pull her away and they left. Everyone sat in the beer garden spent about ten minutes staring in the direction they'd pulled off with no idea what to do.

Sorry this isn't particularly emotive, got a lot to do today, just thought I'd share quickly.


Edit: Decided not to put it in the story, but since you're all debating it the lady sounded North American. No idea whether US or Canada. Having said that I definitely don't think all Americans behave like this. There are dickheads in every country."	t5_2vzax	True

This tale occurs my first summer of being a 'true' teen( at least I thought o was) 
So, on with the stats! 

be me, f 13 yrs old, 5'5, around 105-110lbs. 
Don't be, Cousin Hammy, 15yrs old, 5'9 and I would guess 350lbs.  
My Aunt, on my mothers side, had asked my mon to keep an eye on her lovely son for a week while she went on vacation with some gal pals of her, and my mom, being convinced that I and said hammy needed to spend some time together, agreed.  The first few days went by without incident, and cousin hammy was content taking up my TV all day playing video games and generally adding to his already bovine figure. 
Then came the day that caused my mother to snap. 
For the past 3 days, cousin ham had been crashing on the couch, and after day one, there was an odd stench originating from it, which no matter how much cleaning my mother did, she could not rid the air of the putrid smell. 
This day, she decided to pull out the sofa bed(which she hadn't done cause Hammy had told her 'he took care of it, and changed the bedding') BIG MISTAKE. As she starts to unfold the bed, the smell grows to such a stench, my mother gags, runs as fast as I've ever seen that tiny woman run, grabs a towel, and gloves. 
After she wrapped the towel around her head as a mask, and snapped on the gloves, she unfolded the pullout the rest of the way. 
Low and behold the vile aroma doubled ten fold. 
Let. Me preface this by saying, I've seen some gross shit in my time, but this is still the top. 
The pullout mattress was filled with old nasty urine and shit stains, with numerous wipe marks on the blankets and sheets and even the damned pillowcases were dotted with feces. 
As I helped my mother peel the coverings off, removing the fitted sheet, we discovered hammy had dug out holes in the mattress, and shit into them, there were maybe three total, and the feces was brimming the holes. 
My mom twirled to my room where cousin ham was currently plopped in front of my TV gorging himself on god knows what. I follow her, excited to see what is about to unfold. 
She walks in front of the TV, clicks it off, and very calmly for hamsack to explain himself. He says that his legs were 'giving him troubles', needed help getting to the bathroom and apparently we didn't hear him yelling for help( note, my mom and I are very light sleepers) and since our hearing failed us, we deserved it. 
My mother lost it. She hit pitches that I never even thought possible. She somehow got his bulbous form off of the floor to a standing position, and drug his wailing body to the living-room, and watched as she made him drag the soiled mattress out the door. 
Afterwords she called my Aunt, screaming that she pick up her disgusting son.  
I sat in my room while my mom and Aunt had a yelling match over why my hamplanet cousin was in the right for what he had done. After maybe twenty minutes of this, they left, and my mother never spoke to either of them again.

1372116563.0	1h031l	Waterslide weight limits are discrimination	nuclearhell	870	148	89	"When I was 16, I worked as a lifeguard at a waterpark (not as fun as I thought it would be).

Parts of the park are around 30 years old, a time, apparently, when the hambeasts were less numerous, so the slides were not designed with them in mind.

One slide in particular, the ""Blaster"", is notoriously dangerous. It's fast, filled with sharp turns and has a feature where the slide attendant can press and release a foot pedal to let loose an ""blast"" of water to push the rider down the slide. Bruises are relatively common on this slide, and in a given season there are usually several people who get concussions. Because of physics, larger people are at a greater risk, so there are large signs posted on the stairs. 

DANGER
MAXIMUM WEIGHT ON BLASTER: 250 LBS

Most people either head the warning on the sign or respond politely to the slide atteandent's mildly worded ""recommendation"".

Enter the behemoth. 300+ lbs of bacon grease in a bathing suit, breathing and sweating furiously from the stairs.  She glared at me with a soul-sucking scowl. 

I couldn't lie and say that the slide is temporarily closed because a kid just went down.

""Excuse me, you might want to reconsider riding this slide. It can be dangerous for people with larger frames"" (I figured ""larger frame"" would get me a better response than a more accurate term)
""ARE YOU CALLING ME FAT?""
""No. It's just... the slide is mostly for kids, so it's unsafe larger adults."" 
""FUCK OFF, YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE BASED ON SOCIETY'S STANDARDS""
""It's for your own safety. You could strain your back or hit your head be seriously injured.""
""BULLSHIT! YOU'VE LET PEOPLE BIGGER THAN ME DOWN! (nope) I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR DISCRIMINATION!!""

I'm skinny, 5'6', 125 lbs, It's not like I can stop her. Despite my pleading, and threatening her with expulsion from the park, she pushed me out of the way, lumbered past and plopped onto the slide. Her rolls clogged the entire flume, not unlike the cholesterol in her arteries 

""GIVE ME A BIG BLAST!""
""What you're doing is extremely dangerous. a blast would make it worse. You have to stop""
Then she looked at me like she was trying to be cute, and moaned in a tone of voice that was threatening, but somehow also whiny and almost flirtatious: 
""I WANT A GODDAMN BLAST, PRETTY PLEASE, I KNOW YOU WANNA""

I told her that she wasn't getting a blast, and continued telling her to get off the slide. She didn't listen and pushed herself down. 
I radioed down to guard at the bottom and my supervisor to explain the situation and warn them about a possible injury.

The whale shot down the slide faster than I have ever seen (teenage lifeguards are dumb, when the park was closed, we would see how fast we could shoot people down). The tower shook every time she slammed around a turn. Oh shit....is she going to break the slide? She didn't scream once though, even after all that yelling. Maybe that's because screaming is kind of like exercising. 

She hit the water with a loud smack. I expected that she would be unconscious, and/or we would have to treat her for a spinal injury. (I don't think the straps on the spinal board are long enough, and I have no idea how we would have lifted her). But thankfully, she started flailing her stumpy limbs. The guard jumped in and helped her out of the pool (she could float, but apparently couldn't swim).

She was clearly banged up and a bit disoriented and unsteady, but she refused any kind of first aid. The guard told me later that she went on and on crying ""discrimination"" because I wouldn't give her a blast. 

She was kicked out of the park soon after. It was something about belligerence and ice cream in the lazy river.

TLDR: Hamplanet cries discrimination over waterside weight limit and forces her way on. She (suprisingly) survives with her fatlogic faculties intact. "	t5_2vzax	True

Hello again, FPS!  I have returned from my weekend of fun and, while I should be looking at my work e-mail and dreading my morning, I came back to a pretty full inbox on Reddit and figured I would treat you all to Part Six of the story!  Priorities, right?

If you are just clicking on this to see what this story is about, I would highly recommend starting at the beginning and building up to this.

In this chapter, there will be talk of sexytimes!  Green text to come later on!  It seems that a nice mixture of both black and green text has been a positive, so I will stick to it.

Daisy practically disappeared into her room for the next couple of weeks after *Apocalypse Now* occurred, and none of us really cared.  Remarkably, she was actually not leaving messes in the kitchen, which was a miracle in of itself.  Alex was back in regular hellish schedule mode while Alicia and I were focusing on our studies.  However, within just a few days of one another, Alicia, Alex, and myself, all ended up dating people.

Alicia had ended up going on a couple of dates with a guy from one of her classes.  We shall call him ""Brian"" for the story's sake, though both will not be around for this chapter.  After the couple of dates, she started spending the night over at his place for sexytimes.

The weekend after *Apocalypse Now*, Alex brought one of the waitresses from the strip club, whom we will call ""Erica,"" home with him because she was going through some drama and didn't want to deal with a psychotic ex-boyfriend (I'll have a footnote to this story at the end that doesn't really deal with this tale itself, but it's pretty crazy) and ended up being more than just a shoulder to cry on.

As for me, I decided to call one of the guys I had met on my celebration, who we will call ""Steve.""  Steve was the only guy in that night that did more than just stare at my cleavage, make lewd comments, and buy me a drink.  Guys, pay attention:  We notice.  Steve and I met up for lunch and hit it off right away.

Daisy, of course, had no sexytimes and a lot of jealousy, creating the central theme (SHOCKING!) for this chapter.

Sundays were basically recovery days for all of us, though this day in question had a lot of ridiculousness to it thanks to our hamplanet.  Alicia had spent the night at Brian's and was nowhere to be found.  Steve and I had woken up after a rather long night (wink wink nudge nudge) and were relaxing on the couch in the living room, enjoying some Netflix.  Sometime after Noon, Alex and Erica came out of his bedroom and joined us.  We had all met each other before this, but hadn't really spent any time since all of our schedules were vastly different.  We were enjoying our lounging until the thundering began.

&gt;be me, relaxing

&gt;sexytimes can be hard work!

&gt;Steve and I snuggled up.

&gt;Alex and Erica the same

&gt;awesome day is awesome

&gt;glass of water starts to ripple

&gt;games start to shake on rack

&gt;dare I spy the sound of a rhino?

&gt;A wild hamplanet appears from orbit!

&gt;Daisy dressed in just a long t-shirt

&gt;gag.gif

&gt;cottage cheese visible

&gt;""WHO ARE YOU GUYS?  I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN HERE!""

&gt;Ugh

&gt;To be honest, I've wanted to keep Steve away from you as long as possible

&gt;Probably double for Alex

&gt;""Daisy, quiet.  We're watching a movie.""

It bears noting, obviously, that this would be the first interaction that Daisy would have with our significant others.  Daisy had this strange infatuation with Alex that came and went, mainly because of the couple of nuclear explosions he had.  Still, she would eventually act like nothing had happened after time passed and erased it from her memory.  When this happened, Daisy would endlessly flirt with Alex in the short time he was around, even though he would just disregard it or tell her to knock it off every time.  The girl didn't understand that he wasn't into her at all, and also disregarded the fact that we agreed there would be no roommate relations.

&gt;Alex not in mood

&gt;None of us are

&gt;Steve is in a trance

&gt;Erica looks....disturbed

&gt;I sigh

&gt;""Daisy...this is Steve and Erica, my boyfriend and Alex's girlfriend.""

&gt;Loading....loading....loading....

&gt;Whale brains move slow, apparently

&gt;""WHERE DID YOU MEET ALEX AT, ERICA?  HE PROBABLY JUST PICKED YOU UP AT THE BAR FOR A FLING!""

&gt;blank stare from all

&gt;Alex takes it in stride

&gt;""Erica works at the strip club with me, Daisy.""

&gt;Daisy doesn't hear last part

&gt;selective hearing sucks to deal with

&gt;""OH I SEE HOW IT IS!  HAVE TO BRING HOME A STRIPPER TO TRY AND MAKE ME JEALOUS???""

&gt;....dafuq?

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/5210-facepalm.jpg) she bellows that

&gt;Alex:  eyeroll.gif

&gt;""Daisy, it's none of your business, but she's a waitress there, not a stripper.""

&gt;The whale laughs loudly

&gt;""NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO GET UP ON STAGE, HONEY?  I CAN DO THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE THERE WITH THESE CURVES!""

&gt;Daisy poses and runs her hands up her body

&gt;Steve gags

&gt;Erica has the 1,000 yard stare

&gt;Alex not breaking chill mode

&gt;""Daisy, no one cares.  We are trying to watch a movie.""

&gt;queue up blubbering

&gt;""YOU ARE JUST TOYING WITH ME BY BRINGING THIS SKINNY LITTLE FLOOZY HOME!""

&gt;Yes, she used the word floozy

&gt;Bitch, you are making NO sense

&gt;Erica being very quiet

&gt;Alex shaking his head

&gt;Knows it won't help

At this point, Daisy realized that Alex was basically ignoring her shit and was getting no rise out of Erica, who either adopted or just had the same chill attitude that he did.  Needless to say, they were pretty good for each other.  I had to explain the shit that happened to Steve later on just so he understood what it was all about.  He just wanted to know if this shit happened all the time, to which I basically just shrugged.

Later on in the day, though, is when the real crazy (see: gross and hilarious) shit happened.

Erica had left since she had to work at the strip club that night and Steve took off to do some studying.  Alex and I opted to do some shopping and, upon return, found a rather unexpected scene.

&gt;finish bringing in groceries

&gt;hear noises from living room

&gt;maybe Alicia is home?

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;What the...

&gt;Did mating season start?

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/4620-oh-god.gif) I walk into the living room

Daisy was in the process of ""making out"" with a random guy (see:  eating the face of) on the couch.  The guy seemed normal enough, sans the fact that he was probably trying to struggle for air.  Alex comes walking in not long after and basically freezes, mesmerized by what he saw just as much as I was.

&gt;Daisy sees us

&gt;Pulls away from her cannibalistic make-out session

&gt;""SEE?  I CAN MAKE YOU JUST AS JEALOUS AS YOU MAKE ME, ALEX!  I CAN GET A GUY TOO!""

&gt;[In my head](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/4667-nobody-cares.jpg)

&gt;eyeroll.gif from both of us

&gt;Guy on couch looks really confused

&gt;""Is this guy your.....""

&gt;""SHUT UP AND MAKE OUT WITH ME AGAIN!""

&gt;cannibalism resumes!

&gt;gross.jpeg

&gt;Alex leaves room, trying not to throw up

&gt;staring for a few seconds before leaving

&gt;putting groceries away

&gt;disgusting sounds coming from living room still

&gt;Alex not happy it's happening on the couch

&gt;thunderous sounds happening

&gt;Daisy is storming to her bedroom

&gt;Alex and I back into the living room

&gt;Guy on couch still there

&gt;""This isn't at all what I was expecting.""

&gt;Random guy not making sense

&gt;I have to ask

&gt;""What do you mean?""

&gt;Guy on couch sighs

&gt;""Well, I wasn't supposed to tell you this, but this is too crazy.""

Turns out that this guy wasn't a new boyfriend at all for our missing planet in the Solar System.  He was a guy in the club that just hadn't come over the night of the assault on Alex's car and was trying to be nice to Daisy.  She had apparently called him while we were gone and started crying about Alex toying with her feelings (lolwut) and wanted to ""get back at him.""

&gt;Story seems plausible

&gt;This guy just had no clue

&gt;Alex just as curious

&gt;""So, you came over to plot with her or something?""

&gt;Guy shakes his head

&gt;""No....she paid me to come over to make out with her when you guys got back.""

&gt;[inside my head](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz5ia86DVz1qdeocv.gif)

&gt;both of us stifle laughter

&gt;guy doesn't seem insulted

&gt;hear thundering coming

&gt;oh god no

&gt;we're out of time

&gt;WTFISTHAT???

&gt;OHGODITBURNSTHEEYES

Daisy had now come into the living room wearing....well, we'll call it lingerie, though it was tough because she didn't exactly fit into the outfit and her cuuuuuurves (see: folds) were kind of eating the material in some spots.  That was the breaking point for the guy on the couch.

&gt;like a train wreck

&gt;can't look away

&gt;I might go blind

&gt;""Oh hell no!  That's my limit!""

&gt;Guy on couch agrees!

&gt;Alex bursts out laughing

&gt;I join in

&gt;BELLOWING!!!

&gt;""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  YOU CAME OVER FOR MAH CUUUURVES BABY, RIGHT!?!""

&gt;Guy looks like he just threw up in his mouth

&gt;""No, you bribed me to come over.  I'm leaving.""

&gt;Guy heads for the door

&gt;Alpha-bitch moment for me!

&gt;""Hope you got your money up front!""

&gt;Blubbering hits all time high

&gt;new lake may form in our house

&gt;""WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM YOU SKINNY BITCH!?!""

&gt;youheardme.mp3

&gt;Alex still laughing

&gt;Finally chimes in

&gt;""You paid him to try and make me jealous?  That is hilarious!""

&gt;Tears coming down his face

&gt;Resume laughter from me

&gt;thar she goes!  Whale escaping!

&gt;Doorslam.mp3

Yes, our hamplanet decided that she could make Alex jealous by paying this poor guy to come over, but obviously he did not sign up for the ridiculous sexytimes she had in mind.  Alex and I had a hard time stopping ourselves from laughing at random points the rest of the day and shared the story with Alicia when she returned that night, who had a hard time controlling her laughter as well.

**TL;DR - Awesome roomies and I get dates and sexytimes!  Hamplanet gets jealous of Alex's new girl and pays random guy to try and make Alex jealous.  Hilarity had by all when real story comes out!**

*Footnote:  I said I would come back to the quick note about Erica.  One of the reasons she was very quiet around us at first was that she was dealing with an ex-boyfriend who would routinely call her and text her, demanding to know where she was and why she wasn't at home, as well as follow her when she left the strip club.  By the time Alex had started dating her, she was getting a restraining order against him and had been staying with various friends.  Alex admitted to me a few weeks after that he kind of felt bad that they ended up sleeping together so soon, but it seemed that she genuinely cared for him and it wasn't just a ""white knight"" situation.  The ex never became any bigger issue, though.  He ended up in jail for possession of some type of drug (never found out what) and Erica was much more open after that.*

TL;DR I encounter the largest human being I have ever seen, I describe her in agonizing detail to Reddit for maximum revulsion. Mostly a setup for parts 2 &amp; 3.

This will be a three parter, with additional epilogue describing police reports and after-the-fact knowledge if people want it. Here goes:

I promised this story a while back and finally have a slow day at work to type so… here it is. Just so you all know, every other story I’ve put up is a side note to the hamgalaxy that is the main offender in this story, and this story is the reason I joined FPS.

The setting here is the same as the one in [Lardquisha and the Moons]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d4s3e/part_1_lardquisha_and_the_moons/), but about 2 months afterwards. Spring is in the air, school will be over in a few weeks, and I’m loving this job. T, GHB, and I are all working tonight, so I’m pleased as punch. I’ve been at class all day, so I pull into the parking lot to take a nap in my car, seeing a huge thunderhead in the distance. Love the rain, puts me to sleep, this will be a restful 2 hours. Thunder booms in the distance, a sign that something ominous, something despicable, something unimaginably large is drawing near:


&gt;Be me, waking up from a nap to my Razor cell phone alarm clock, the time is 10:30pm, my shift starts at 11pm


&gt;Tired, don’t wanna move. It’s raining like crazy but I see Mexibro and Mexiplanet, my two favorite janitors waving me over from the overhang outside the doors


&gt;They always got a couple of spliffs (cigarettes rerolled with weed and tobacco) to share, so I hurry over


&gt;Take a couple mellowing draws, feelsgoodman, chat about the day. Mexibro comments that it’s so dark out, so ominous. I have to agree


Neither of these two spoke much English, but I knew enough Spanish that I was designated as the person that communicates with them when there were spills, etc. and was called on to translate on occasion, naturally we became friends. They were the best, but I have a FPS about Mexiplanet—turned out he was kind of an asshole. Language barriers don’t dampen fatlogic.

&gt;Get my typical wake-up dinner, an entire box of breakfast pastries and a Rockstar—the only thing that could keep me up for 8 hours after a full day of class (easily 2500+ calories)


&gt;Sitting in the food court, I glance across the produce to the doors and hear a faint thud


&gt;The hairs on the back of my neck stand up as oranges fall from their displays and begin rolling towards the door as an object with a massive gravitational force draws near


&gt;But still I see nothing. I can only hear the sound that could be likened to a blacksmith pumping a bellow, and every minute or so (no exaggeration) thumps almost of too low a frequency to hear


&gt;After about 10 minutes and 20 or so thumps, I see a fleshy mass moving one step at a time through the doors, it comes to a halt—it’s stuck


&gt;It twists, turns, grabs the frame and pushes. Something in the doorframe cracks, and with a final growled “Muhdder *FUCKER*” it emerges into the store proper and I get a look


Prepare your imagination Reddit, we’re going on an adventure!!
&gt;This woman was a certified hamgalaxy. I estimate her weight to be just under 700 lbs, and how I know that will be explained shortly. These are the types of fat people that you just don’t see in the wild because they are typically confined to a couch/bed


&gt;She was wearing a massive purple T-shirt that at one point had a Looney Toons character on it, but ~4 rolls fell below said T-shirt


&gt;Lowest roll could be classified as a pannis, fell almost to her knees. Upper arms had their own folds that fell past elbows, forearms had small rolls that fell and covered part of each hand


&gt;Sweatpants adorned the legs (a matching purple, clearly a regular fashionista!) that were cut up the sides to the knee to accommodate her massive treetrunk calves, the left one so swollen and purple that it hurt to just look at. Literally larger around than my waist


&gt;The calves (for the sake of consistency) also had a 360 roll that fell on her disgusting feet like she was wearing a perverse pair of fleshy pants, feet adorned with dirty pink flip flops


&gt;Sores… so many sores. Several inches of asscrack, filled partially with luxurious locks that fell from her head in a scraggly, greasy ponytail


&gt;The ghosts of bad dye jobs past could be seen up and down the ponytail, the true tragedy in this story. But I digress…


&gt;As a bonus, it was raining like crazy and her clothes were plastered to what bits of flesh they did manage to cover, rendering every fold and every dimple (of which there were many) in stunning detail


&gt;I’ll let you all guess whether she was wearing a bra or any kind of undergarment. Not that she needed a bra, her tits were more slabs of ham—the smallest curves on her whole body


&gt;Oh, god! What horrifying detail those slabs were allowed in her rain soaked outfit


&gt;To my surprise, there came a daughtermoon shortly after, perfectly round with dirty blond ringlets carrying a massive cloth purse/tote with a cracked cat vinyl on the side. The purse looked to be containing an anvil


&gt;In the child’s arms was a dirty pile of blankets


During these observations my slightly high mind comprehended that I was now late for my shift, but I couldn’t look away. Nothing seemed as important at this moment, than this absurdity of nature. I had to see what she was going to do next, what was she doing here?! I realized I had moved closer and was now practically crouching behind a display of oranges, hadn’t even noticed that I’d moved.


&gt;Daughtermoon speaks to the galaxy, “I think we should go home now! You aren’t supposed to leave the house daddy is gonna be mad!”


&gt;Galaxy is huffing, jaw hanging open, eyes roll back, she wavers… holy shit she’s gonna pass out


&gt;Galaxy closes her eyes, and speaks: “MUH MUH…” *wheeze wheeze*


&gt;”Muh muh?” thinks I, what could this mean? Galaxy cannot catch her breath, she doesn’t look good, her head rolls back eyes still closed, but lo! It speaks again


&gt;”MUH MUH…” *wheeze wheeze* “…MUH MUH JUS’ NEEDS UH GET HER MEDICUN…”  *wheeze* “…DEN WE CUN GO…” *wheeze wheeze*


&gt;Ah, referring to herself in the third person: Muh muh = mama


&gt;”HALP MUH MUH GIT A SCOOTUR MUH MUH TOO TI-YARD TUH WALK” says Muh Muh to daughtermoon


&gt;Ah, she needs medicine! That explains why she left the house, must be important, insulin probably 


&gt;Daughtermoon is familiar with this ritual it appears, she walks to the galaxy’s side and stands erect, Muh Muh braces one hand on daughter moon and takes a few lumbering steps towards the scooters by the door


&gt;I note her steps have an undertone of clinking, as the carbon atoms in the foam rubber of her flip flops under such heat and pressure are spontaneously reorganizing into sheets of diamond


&gt;Daughtermoon is a human cane, apparently. I admire her strength 


&gt;In this fashion, it takes 5 minutes for Muh Muh to get to the scooters parked by the door. It took 5 minutes to take ~15 steps and travel ~10 feet


A note about the scooters: we had been having a recurring problem of having people so large they either couldn’t fit in the scooters or the scooters wouldn’t move because their weight limit was exceeded. Then we had a faulty one that ran even though the weight limit was exceeded, the motor burned out, huge liability. Therefore, corporate sent up 4 industrial, extrawide titanium-reinforced carts that had a weight limit of 700lbs (if I recall). I remember silly teenage girls piling onto those,  3 sitting comfortably in the seat… These things were MASSIVE.


&gt;Muh Muh finally reaches one of the said carts, she pivots and practically falls into the seat half sideways


&gt;As her ample bottom reaches the seat, I hear air squeal out of the seat cushion like a shriek of agony, the cart groans


&gt;She grabs and picks up her giant left leg (it hardly bends) onto the floor of the scooter, then the other, but Muh Muh isn’t comfortable


&gt;She tries to wiggle straight into the seat, but is unsuccessful at moving at all. Her folds move in tandem back and forth from this wiggling in a hypnotic motion


&gt;Enraged, she braces her disgusting leg against the steering column and with another “Muhdder *FUCKER*” she pushes with all her might


&gt;Something in the back support breaks, it leans back farther than it was meant to go but holds by an act of god


&gt;Since she entered the seat sideways, one side has a number of folds under the arm rest, so she proceeds to grab her folds, lean the opposite way and pull the folds above the arm rest


&gt;This process is repeated until all folds on both sides are above arm rest, her T-shirt at this point is hardly covering anything. Many folds are visible, riddled with stretch marks wider than my hand the color of uncooked sausage


&gt;Muh Muh is ready to go; I genuinely wonder whether the cart will move—it does! Slowly…


&gt;Daughtermoon places blankets and purse in basket and jumps on the back


&gt;The back tires are now rubbing against the tire guards


&gt;The poor electric motor struggles, letting out a low pitched “rrrrrrERRRRRRrrrrrrrERRRRR”


&gt;Muh Muh is on her way to meet destiny


&gt;I know in the pit of my stomach that a life-changing event is coming, but nothing could prepare me for what would happen in the next few minutes

Sorry, this was more of a setup than a story and I dunno how these things get so long! Do we want to hear more, my little curvy dumplings?

[PART 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fj2bn/the_time_i_oppressed_a_hamplanet_pool_hopper_part/)

So having read that, very little background is needed. I am very fortunate to have two cameras outside of my house. One is on the porch pointed towards the front door. The other one is pointed along the side of my house. 

There is a little paved path that is visible on the 2nd camera. This path leads to the fabled unlocked gate that Hamela Anderson herself had been using.

The night of the first incident, I check the cameras. I've actually never really had to check them before. I installed them because the neighborhood UPS man had been showing up with a lot of broken packages... 2nd camera was free and I got lucky with placement.

So I'm checking the camera and I see something that makes me want to punch my laptop screen. I caught Hamela on May 28th, a Tuesday. She had been in my pool on Monday through Friday the previous week, and this Monday and Tuesday. I just know she's going to comeback, so I do something kind of evil.

I decide to do two things actually. The 2nd one will be calling the police.

I go to the shed and look at all the pool stuff. I take the algecide and powdered chlorine, and this light blue powdery stuff to bleach the concrete white when you open the pool after winter. I pour in an estimated $120 of chemicals into this thing and vow not to swim for at least a week.  Standing over the pool, the fumes make my eyes tear up. *It's beautiful*

The camera I have is an IP camera, I'll be able to see the first day she comes back after being caught, straight from work.

Hamela Anderson comes back, but not on Wednesday, but Thursday. Confident with her trickery, (teehee) she lounges in my backyard for about 3 hours. Since I don't have any cameras pointed at the pool I can't see how long she swam for. She leaves, but I can't see much on her condition because the camera is quite Black and White.

Friday I take a half-day off of work. I come home and check out one of the 2nd floor windows facing the pool. I can see her, and she looks rather *sunburned*. I call the cops this time, and they say they will be there right away. I burn a bunch of time stamped evidence from the camera to DVD and go out to talk to Hamela.

Oh your back! I say

Yea! And ya can't take mah clothes I hid em real good so ya can't harass meh no more.

She looks pleased with herself, and seems to think that despite the fact she is clearly trespassing, I can't do anything to her because anything of value is hidden in my yard

[How this will turn out for her](http://24.media.tumblr.com/1c50914b0a66b0a4c3da74bea7c43db1/tumblr_mlocs8QKEX1s917bwo1_400.gif)

""You really shouldn't be swimming"", I say, holding my nose and backing away slowly for effect

""I chemically shocked the pool to clean it, the Ph of the water is off the charts.""

Hamela looks at her skin, which looks like a really bad sunburn and then back at me.

""Yu posoind yur water? Yu can't do that, thats tempted murdur""

I can do whatever I want, *It is my water*

""Im gunna sue, you damaged mah skin, and yur gonna have tuh pay for that""

Not really sure what to say after that, I'm not *that* smooth and I wasn't sure where to take this.

""Shut the fuck up, lardo"", I say. I felt kind of bad saying that, even though I was mad, those words seemed especially hurtful.

She literally starting talking about the word lard and than about lard vs fat, and then about how she was very healthy, and then some HAES stuff.

The police came through the side gate and Hamela absolutely flipped her lid

She started screaming about how I threw acid on her and how I was about to rape her, and how I stole from her the other day.

Cops starting to eye me so I give them the DVD and start talking about what happened.

""I really needed to shock my pool, I didn't plan on swimming in it for a week or so, but this lady trespassed and swam without knowing, she got chemically burned"".

Cops order her out of the water, I'm guessing they don't want an acid bath. 

They handcuff her and start to take her to the gate.  mirandarights.jpg

""NO wait! I need mah clothes! They're hidden so he wont steal em!"" 

The cops want to stop being cops as soon as possible, so they ignore her requests.

I begin the laborious task of balancing the pool water

Hamela does return, in another story, more on that later."	t5_2vzax	True

As some of you may have read from a previous comment, Jessica and her parents is on vacation and we are having a neighborhood BBQ, everyone is invited, except one family because their invitation got lost in the mail.^teehee So if they weren't on vacation this might not have happened. I blame you FPS for wanting more!

&gt;Time to green this bitch up!

On second thought, no. So Friday, having BBQ, setting up, preparing, so far so good. No sign of The Manatee yet, I doubt she will show, right guys? ^guys?^right?please...^help^me. It's later and people start showing up, no Manatee yay! All the kids show up in swimwear as we could use Jessica's pool for tonight, some adults show up in swimwear as well. Miranda show up as well as I invited her even though she does not live in the neighborhood, wearing a bikini looking all sorts of fine. We talk, take a dip in the pool, eat some and talk some more. Starts getting loud outside so we go inside to talk and before I know(20min maybe) it some guy who lives at the ass end of the street shows up looking for ""ice"" yeah right guy.. He says ""What the fuck man! You shouldn't cheat on your girlfriend when shes right outside!"" Whoa there guy, lets not get carried away here. There may or may not have been some giggling and over the clothes butt touching so lets not go to cheating okay! Wait cheating? Who am I^cheating^on..^fuck^my^life

**SPECULATION BEGINS**

Hello I'm the Manatee and I'm a fucking delusional fuck who thinks someone likes me and I will go over to a party I'm not invited to and cause trouble. So, there I am ~~walking~~ waddling over, I find the boys parents, chat them up, introduce myself as their childs new girlfriend and then chat everyone up telling them I'm the girlfriend of the boy who lives here. I'm also going to eat a lot of food, drink tons of beetus juice and be a general nuisance.

**SPECULATION ENDS**

I immediately understand what happened and I walk outside, Miranda grabs my hand and walks with me to confront the beast.

&gt;Me ""WHAT THE FUCK!? YOU NEED TO FUCKING LEAVE BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE!""

&gt;Manatee ""Yeah you fucking slut, you need to leave my boyfriend alone! Stop harassing him!""

&gt;Me ""I WASN'T TALKING TO HER YOU FUCKING COW! I WAS TALKING TO YOU! IT'S YOU WHOSE BEEN HARASSING ME!""

&gt;Manatee ""No I haven't, I'm your girlfriend! What has this slut been saying to you? Come here, I introduced myself to everyone, let's kick her out and talk.""

&gt;Me ""NO! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND JUST FUCKING LEAVE!""

&gt;Random person ""Hey, you shouldn't treat your girlfriend like that!""

&gt;Me ""SHES NOT MY FUCKING GIRLFRIEND, SHE HAS BEEN HARASSING AND STALKING ME EVER SINCE SHE MOVED HERE!""

Now during this I had been squeezing Mirandas hand pretty hard because of all this fucking rage, she puts her other hand on my arm and I notice and let go a bit.

&gt;Miranda ""He doesn't like you, just leave before there is more trouble""

&gt;Manatee ""YOU! YOU'VE BEEN STEALING **MY** BOYFRIEND! AND YOU ASSAULTED ME YOU SHOULD BE IN JAIL!""

&gt;Me ""Remember you called the police that day, and they have a report of it. In it there is no evidence of assault""

The Manatee walks up to me and tries to grab my arm and pull me away from Miranda. I in my infinite rage wisdom readies to punch her but Miranda squeezes my hand and I realize what I'm about to do and stop myself

I sidestep and make her miss, she didn't fall though :( At this point several of our women guests grabs a hold of the Manatee and hauls her outside while she is crying and screaming incoherently. I let go of Miranda walk inside fuming, Miranda quickly follows. I get in my room close my door and lies down on the bed to cool off, Miranda enters and closes the door behind her and sits next to me. I just starts ranting and she is agreeing with everything. I must have dozed off with her shortly after because when I woke up she was still there.

Later the Manatees father came over and had no idea about what had happened since they moved in because he had been gone for work. He told me his daughter has been acting unreasonably and been out of line and she wont bother me again. If she does I should tell him or call the police depending on the severity. I then told him if she ever speaks to me again I will get a restraining order and this will become a criminal matter.

So lets see if I'm going to be left alone, here's hoping guys!"	t5_2vzax	True

I was going to wait until tomorrow to post up the next installment, but after writing out the first part, I've been so eager to keep writing that I'm going to dive into the second part right away.  By now, you've read up on the awesome house and deciding to live with Alicia, Alex, and Daisy, our hamplanet.

Alicia and I were both taking summer courses for the sole reason that we got to stay in the dorm until we could move into the house.  It was so hard to do so because we were eager to not be living in a room.  Alex was still living in a dorm as well, though he was lucky enough to have his roommate move out since he wasn't taking summer courses, so he was by himself until move-in.  It didn't really matter, though, since he worked so much.  His room, in his own words, was simply a place to pass out most of the times. I would really understand just how hellacious his schedule was after just a couple of weeks.

Daisy was not on campus after the semester ended and she lived a couple of hours away, so she didn't get to take part in any of our bonding meet ups, which ended up being for the better.  Alex fit right in with the two of us and was glad that we were both turning 21 early on in our lease so we could go out to bars when he did end up having free time.  Until then, we had to settle for places that let in under 21 people and Alex, even though he was a year older than us (he took a year off after high school before going to college) had no issue with it.  He was all about good company, and we all had pretty similar tastes.

Anyways, let's fast forward to the good stuff!

&gt;Move-in day is finally here!

&gt;Alicia and I couldn't even sleep, we were so excited.

&gt;8am, head over to realtor!

&gt;Meet up with other awesome roomie Alex.

&gt;Alex looks dead tired.

&gt;Says he worked until 5am and got maybe an hour of sleep.

&gt;Feel bad for the guy

&gt;Open up house for first time!  Totally awesome feeling!

&gt;Bzzzzz

&gt;Text from Daisy

&gt;Says she'll be there this afternoon.

&gt;Works for me!  Gives us the chance to get our stuff in!

Sure enough, the three of us all helped get our stuff moved in.  My dad made the hour drive in to help me out and also bring some things that they didn't need in the house. Alicia's brother came by (Army guy, totally hot and incredibly nice) to help out as well.  Alex's Mother made a two hour drive in a u-haul to help him out as well, though he needed to go back to his dorm to get that taken care of first.

Hours pass by and the three of us with our helpers are getting everything set up.  We come to find out that Alex had more than just ""a few things for the living room"" like he told us.  He literally furnished the entire huge living space.  I asked him if he was a drug dealer on the side jokingly, which he laughed and took in stride.  He said that he actually had hit $25,000 on a scratch off lottery ticket on his 19th birthday.  His mother confirmed it and said she was really glad because their family did alright for themselves, but it would be tough to help him out in times of need.  He did the smart thing and deposited almost all of it, buying things as he needed them.  As an awesome guy, I had no doubt that his parents were awesome people too.

With his two jobs, he was able to buy a lot of nice things and was very proud of himself, as was his mother, even though she felt he went a bit overboard.  Our living room was now furnished with a huge LED television, beautiful glass entertainment center, gaming stuff, a gigantic couch, couple of recliners, and a coffee table and end tables.  He had kept the bulk of his stuff at his parents place and took the entertainment stuff with him.  I only bring this up because you can probably see impending disaster as I describe this stuff.  Keep your jimmies in tow, because we will get to all of this later on.

At about 2pm, all of our help took off and we spent the next hour setting our stuff up.

&gt;Almost finished with my bedroom

&gt;So many more boxes to go

&gt;Damn do I need a shower

&gt;Mirror starts to shake on the door

&gt;Earthquake in the midwest?

&gt;Bed shifts over

&gt;Oh, nevermind.  Daisy is inside the house now.

Daisy came in at around 3pm that afternoon after the rest of us had gotten all of our stuff inside, though most of us still needed to set up our bedrooms.  Daisy was there with her mother and father.  Dad was pretty normal sized, mother was a hamplanet much like dear old daughter.  Her father seemed nice enough, though he didn't say much.  Her mother, however, talked almost exactly like Daisy did.

&gt;Head downstairs

&gt;Daisy and family are here

&gt;""ALLLLLEEEEXXXXX!!!  I MISSED YOU!!!""

&gt;Alex is laughing a bit

&gt;Oh god, she's charging

&gt;Lamp shakes on endtable

&gt;Alex braces for impact

&gt;Daisy gives Alex a gigantic hug and big wet kiss, which really made Alex uneasy just from the look on his face

&gt;Poor guy

&gt;He may need mouthwash now

&gt;...what is mom holding?

Her mother was holding two gigantic white bags.  They were unmarked and I couldn't tell what was in them, but it did smell delicious.  Daisy's mother decided to stop and get a lot of food as part of the move in.  Alex politely declined because he had to head out for the day.  He was looking at buying a new car and had an appointment to see one, then had to work from 6pm until 5am at the strip club.  Daisy's father quietly asked why such hellish hours.  When he mentioned that it was a strip club that he worked at, the bellowing began from the mother....and holy shit, was it crazy.

&gt;""Oh so you work at a strip club?  I can see that!  You are good looking!""

&gt;Alex looks mortified.

&gt;""Oh, no ma'am...I just run the audio.  It's a gentlemen's club.""

&gt;Momma whale looks disappointed

&gt;Doesn't seem to care

&gt;""Oh you should get up on stage yourself!  You could knock ladies like me dead and earn you some real money!""

&gt;vomit.gif

&gt;isthisthereallife.jpg

&gt;""MOMMA LEAVE ALEX ALONE!  HE IS MORE INTO GIRLS MY AGE!  AIN'T THAT RIGHT ALEX???""

&gt;Alex may drop dead right here

&gt;Don't want to replace awesome roommate

&gt;Please stop with this

Alex, once again, showed restraint that I didn't think was possible and politely excused himself, saying he would see everyone tomorrow afternoon.  As he headed out the door, Daisy and her mother proved just how airheaded they really were.

&gt;""Tomorrow afternoon?  But he works tonight?""

&gt;Really Daisy?

&gt;""I know, honey!  That doesn't make sense either!""

&gt;.....

&gt;areyouserious.mp3

&gt;Father facepalms.

&gt;Looks like he understands it.

&gt;Dad has to explain

&gt;""He works third shift.  He'll get home late and sleep until the afternoon.""

&gt;Dark lightbulbs over their heads.

&gt;Oh look, they came on!

&gt;valleygirls.org

&gt;""WELL CAN WE EAT NOW???  I'M SO HUNGRY!!""

&gt;Daisy obviously hasn't eaten enough, according to her.

&gt;Mom quickly agrees.

&gt;They go to kitchen.

&gt;Father looks rather disgusted.

&gt;Seems like this is not rare behavior for them.

&gt;shocking.mp3

While I decided not to watch this destruction in the kitchen, I saw the aftermath of two store-bought pre-cooked chickens (The little six dollar ones in the pouches that are tasty), two gigantic sides of mashed potatoes, and two two-liter bottles of diet coke.  This would be considered a small meal for both of them, I would realize.  Did I mention they had done not one bit of moving yet?  Daisy's dad is not happy with them immediately and starts moving some stuff in while they devour their food.  Daisy apparently didn't have too much stuff, mainly just for her bedroom and then, of course, food.

Lots, and lots, of food.

&gt;Decide to help out frustrated father

&gt;Valley girl and mom are too busy destroying their food

&gt;Alicia decides to help out as well.

&gt;Probably disgusted like I am

&gt;What have we done to ourselves?

&gt;All this stuff looks brand new...

&gt;Wonder if hamplanets will even help out with the moving?

&gt;LOLNOPE

Daisy's father, myself, and Alicia, did all of their moving.  Her father talked a bit more after we started helping, explaining that things at her last place had gone really wrong.  According to him, she lived in one of the nicest dorms on campus with two other girls and none of them got along.  He didn't really elaborate because he said he traveled a lot for business (found out later he was an executive for a large telecommunications company, though we never asked which one just out of privacy) and that the mother dealt with all the problems herself.  Either way, he said he was hoping for a better outcome with this situation since it was a huge house and he was glad that we seemed to be decent people.  After moving all of the things into the house, including what had to be $500 in food, we ran into the first problem.

&gt;There is no room in the fridge and freezer for all of this

&gt;Why so much damned food?

&gt;Guess the fridge is kind of small

&gt;Just mine and Alicia's stuff.

&gt;What in the hell are we going to do&gt;

&gt;fuckmylife.com

&gt;wind starts to pick up

&gt;we're indoors...?

&gt;Bellowing begins

&gt;""OH MY GOD THERE IS NO ROOM FOR MY STUFF IN THIS FRIDGE!  I TOLD YOU IT WAS TOO SMALL!""

&gt;Calm down Daisy, for fuck's sake

&gt;Almost everything is frozen

&gt;jesustakethewheel.gif

&gt;more bellowing from mom incoming

&gt;Where is my umbrella?

&gt;The spitstorm is ridiculous

&gt;""OH MY GOD YOU'RE RIGHT!  YOUR STUFF IS GOING TO GET SPOILED!  WE CAN'T HAVE THIS!!!""

&gt;...dafuq are you two doing?

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/6101-wtf) they start taking the stuff Alicia and I have in the freezer.

&gt;OhHELLno.mp3

&gt;""Um, Alicia and I already went shopping.  We need space in there too.""

&gt;Don't reason with whales - Lesson one

&gt;fatlogic queued up!

&gt;""MY DAUGHTER HAS A CUNDISHUN AND NEEDS FOOD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!""

&gt;blink blink

&gt;Am I being lectured by a whale?

&gt;Father stepping in

&gt;""Honey, your roommates need their stuff frozen too.  You'll just have to make do for now.""

&gt;At least one member of their family has sense.

&gt;I like her dad.

&gt;Mom can jump in the ocean to return to her pod

&gt;Pod = Group of whales.  Fun fact for the day, FPS!

&gt;Also gam, school, or herd.

&gt;Class is over!

Much bellowing occurred between the three of them, but Alicia and I didn't even have that much in the freezer.  The problem was that so damn much of hamplanet's stuff was frozen that it was really the only thing she needed to use besides cabinets for snacks.  I don't really know how they got all of it into the freezer, but they managed to do so.  It was obvious, though, that the average-sized fridge and freezer was not going to cut it.

&gt;Get phone out

&gt;text Alex about problem with fridge and freezer space

&gt;responds with ""don't worry, I'll take care of it.""

&gt;Had no idea what he meant

&gt;Trust awesome roomie

&gt;Get out of way of hamplanet for time being.

Alex would save the day that weekend by buying an industrial sized freezer for the basement.  He said when he actually had the time, he loved cooking steaks and ribs and needed the extra space to store them.  I won't lie:  He really did spoil Alicia and I when he could.  He did for Daisy as well early on, but as with most hamplanets, they get greedy.

Moving on from that sidenote, it was time to get the bedrooms situated.  Alicia and I were upstairs in our bedrooms and getting everything situated while Daisy and her parents got her bedroom in order.  And by Daisy and her parents I really just mean her dad because the other two were moaning about CUNDISHUNS and shit like that.  I really felt bad for him, considering he probably put up with this every day of his life when he was home.  I was hoping this would just pass over and things would be okay.  After a few more hours, I was happy with my layout as well as Alicia.  We were so glad we got the house and figured that having the awesome place would offset the problems that would happen.

Again, we were dead wrong.

We were going to cook but figured we could go out since Daisy and her parents were still around and we hadn't gone out to a restaurant in awhile.  We head downstairs, stopping briefly at Daisy's bedroom, which wasn't set up completely yet, and tell them we'll be back and we're going out for awhile, making sure Daisy has her key for the place.

&gt;Can't wait to eat.

&gt;Restaurant just a couple blocks away is awesome

&gt;Can't wait until 21 and can get beer there as well

&gt;Wind picking up

&gt;""ARE YOU GOING OUT TO DINNER, CASSIE?""

&gt;Ugh

&gt;Yes, but didn't you just eat?

&gt;Don't be beta, Cass....

&gt;""We have a couple of other things to do but we're going to stop by somewhere, yes.""

&gt;Little white lies don't hurt.

&gt;Bellowing starts

&gt;""CAN I GO TOO???  I'M SO HUNGRY!""

&gt;...you have a freezer full of shit, valley girl.

&gt;fatlogic.com

&gt;Dad saves the day again

&gt;""Daisy, you have things to do here.  Let them go out.  Not like you won't see them again.""

&gt;Learning that her dad is really cool

&gt;Guy looks exhausted

&gt;""I NEED BONDING TIME WITH MY ROOMMATES YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!  I NEED TO EAT TOO BECAUSE OF MY CUNDISHUN DADDY!""

&gt;Dad facepalms again

&gt;""You are staying here and helping with the setup.  What have I told you about acting like this?""

&gt;OH SNAP!

&gt;Dad just put his foot down!

&gt;""Yeah, you should get your bedroom all setup!  See you later!""

&gt;Escape quickly out back

&gt;Hear bellowing in distance

&gt;Thanks higher deity that she can't run

&gt;Alicia laughing in car

&gt;Fuck you bitch, you stranded me!

We took off and went to dinner, finding out that this restaurant just a few blocks away would become a regular joint for us.  Chill place, good music, cool people.  This was our safehaven.  We were gone for about two hours and returned to what resembled destruction.

&gt;Awesome dinner

&gt;Open back door

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/5858-freak-out) I see ""dinner"" has been served

Daisy was in her bedroom and her parents were gone.  She had destroyed six frozen dinners already and had left the trash out on the table.  Alicia was getting angry but I sent her upstairs so I could try and be civil.

&gt;rage.gif

&gt;""Daisy, you are going to clean up the kitchen right?""

&gt;Seems oddly content

&gt;That poor bed looks unstable

&gt;""OF COURSE I WILL CASSIE!  I JUST NEEDED TO REST AFTER EATING!  I GET LIGHT HEADED!""

&gt;Don't want to deal with this

&gt;Nod and walk away.

Needless to say, they didn't get cleaned by her.  Alicia and I went to bed early and didn't even go downstairs for anything the rest of the night.  Alex ended up cleaning them up at 6am when he got back from work.  He didn't care, but wasn't happy.  This was just the start of the problems...

**TL;DR - Move-in time!  Three out of the four of us get set up right away!  Daisy's mom is just as valley girl as her!  FUCKING TIME, HOW DOES IT WORK?  And the foreshadowing of not cleaning up after herself.**

&gt;be me, 4th grade or so

&gt;pokemon is popular

&gt;as kids do, get totally obsessed, pokemon is love, pokemon is life

&gt;buy pokemon everything

&gt;wear yellow all the time because pikachu

&gt;pokemon stickers, pokemon shirts

&gt;I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved pokemon with my little child heart

&gt;begged parents for months to get gameboy and pokemon game

&gt;don't own any other consoles or games, this would be the only one, so it's a pretty big deal for me

&gt;many tears, chores, some of my own saved money and high grades later, parents relent, reward with pokemon (red, fuck yeah)

&gt;play constantly

&gt;take it everywhere with me

&gt;it's my baby

&gt;gonna be the very best

&gt;like no one ever was

&gt;parents bring to the House of the Bear for dinner

&gt;if you've seen my previous stories, tensions between our families are pretty high now, but they were okay back then

&gt;have dinner

&gt;typical fatties gon fat talk

&gt;typical 6x normal serving sizes

&gt;typical saying I'm too thin and unhealthy and vain

&gt;it's okay, I keep thinking about my pokemon

&gt;ignore them

&gt;hope is the greatest weapon

&gt;they praise that I am finally mature enough to accept their criticism without talking back

&gt;nah just pretending pokemon are real and I'm dining with snorlaxes

&gt;dinner's over, adults talk in one room, the children (me and Ursa Minor who is 5, 6 years older than me) meant to play together

&gt;we go to a different room

&gt;take out gameboy

&gt;gonna beat the elite four, fuck yes

&gt;so excited

&gt;this is what my whole existence has been for

&gt;The beast notices

&gt;""Whatcha got there, throwing_pies?""

&gt;It's Pokemon I fucking love pokemon let me tell you about pokemon

&gt;""Can I play?""

&gt;No because it's mine and I need to beat the elite four, maybe later?

&gt;""But I want to play, I'm bigger than you so you have to give it to me.""

&gt;Well maybe physically, but this is my game and I want to play it now.

&gt;""What? What did you say to me? You can't talk back to me, give it to me!""

&gt;No, it's mine!

&gt;""No, give it to me! You can play it any time, and I can't! Let me play it now!""

&gt;mfw this is the only game/console I own, while she has a nintendo 64 and tons of games for it, and tons of pc games 

&gt;But I can't play whenever I want, Ursa Minor! My parents don't let me play whenever I want!

&gt;""But at least you HAVE the game! So give it to me!""

&gt;No! It's mine! I worked really hard for this!

&gt;then the unthinkable happens

&gt;she grabs the game out of my hands

&gt;*throws it* to the ground


&gt;""IF I CAN'T PLAY, YOU CAN'T PLAY!""

&gt;I see the screen flicker and go dark

&gt;and then

&gt;she stomps on it

&gt;all 300+lbs of her

&gt;and then

&gt;she sits on it

&gt;earsplitting shriek

&gt;parents run into room, Ursa Major following behind

&gt;""Throwing_pies, why are you screaming?""

&gt;""SHE SAT ON MY GAME! SHE BROKE IT! SHE BROKE MY GAME!!! IT'S DEAD NOW, SHE'S FAT AND SHE KILLED IT AND AND AND""

&gt;am in hysterics

&gt;Dad is very angry, knows I worked hard to earn it

&gt;""Is this true? Ursa Minor, get up.""

&gt;Ursa Minor starts crying even harder than me

&gt;let me take this opportunity to remind you that I am about 9 and she is 15

&gt;Says I was being mean, wouldn't let her play

&gt;Says she was just trying to teach me to listen to people bigger than me

&gt;Says I'd have to learn eventually

&gt;Can't take it

&gt;Shriek, ""YOU'RE BIGGER THAN ME SO YOU BROKE IT WITH YOUR BUTT?!?!?!""

&gt;She cries harder

&gt;Says I don't appreciate her lessons

&gt;Says I'm lying and she just asked nicely, and I dropped it myself and she fell trying to pick it up for me

&gt;Says I'm just a kid, I wasn't careful and now I'm blaming her

&gt;Ursa Major agrees

&gt;Says I must be lying because her sweet child could never do something like break someone else's things intentionally

&gt;Shriek, ""NONE OF YOU WERE EVEN HERE, I WOULD NEVER DROP MY GAMEBOY, SHE WAS SITTING ON IT, SHE THREW IT, DIDN'T 
YOU HEAR IT""

&gt;Dad says he did hear something slam into the ground

&gt;Mother did too

&gt;So did uncle

&gt;Ursa Major having none of it

&gt;""Well then she should've just given it to Ursa Minor anyway! It doesn't matter!""

&gt;Still shrieking, ""SO IT'S OKAY FOR HER TO BREAK IT!!??!""

&gt;""Then you should've listened to her.""

&gt;""IT WAS OVER $100, ARE YOU GOING TO BUY ME A NEW ONE?!?!""

&gt;""No, it's your fault you didn't listen. You're probably lying anyway.""

&gt;Dad can't take it

&gt;""No, it's NOT throwing_pies' fault. It's her game and she can do whatever she wants with it, and it's *not* okay for your fat child 
to break her things because she's physically bigger, and don't you ever call my daughter a liar.""

&gt;""YOU'RE CALLING MY DAUGHTER A LIAR THEN.""

&gt;""You're calling my daughter, who worked hard for weeks to earn a gameboy and never lets it out of her sight, a liar instead? 
When your obese kid was clearly sitting on top of her gameboy?""

&gt;""SHE NEEDS TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL AND SHARE HER THINGS. Tell her to apologize for making Ursa Minor cry! See, 
throwing_pies isn't even crying! Only Ursa Minor is crying! If she were really upset, she'd be crying too!""

&gt;""*YOU BROKE HER MOST EXPENSIVE, FAVORITE TOY AND WON'T EVEN APOLOGIZE, NO WONDER SHE DOESN'T RESPECT YOU*""

&gt;Ursa Minor still crying

&gt;I have been incoherently screaming and hyperventilating trying to save my gameboy turning it on and off

&gt;it won't turn on it won't turn on it won't turn on

&gt;scream of child anguish

&gt;hurl gameboy at Ursa Minor

&gt;""YOU BROKE IT, YOU CAN KEEP IT, I DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE, YOU ALL THINK I'M LYING ANYWAY""

&gt;it fucking bounces off her

&gt;she cries more

&gt;run out of house tears forming in eyes, lock self into car

&gt;last things heard while exiting the cave of the beast:

&gt;""Look, she attacked her! She was clearly feeling guilty!""

&gt;""IT BOUNCED OFF OF HER, HOW FAT CAN YOUR KID GET""

&gt;parents follow maybe half an hour later, with my gameboy

&gt;do their best at driving while consoling a hysteric, violent child all the way home

&gt;thanks parents, you tried

&gt;it eventually turned on but was glitchy as fuck and would turn off at random times, buttons didn't work right anymore, etc.

&gt;dad was very sorry but couldn't justify the expense of buying me an entirely new one

&gt;tells me to never bring anything valuable to me near her again, and hopes I've learned a lesson about reasoning with emotionally unstable people

&gt;he tells mom that Ursa Minor/Major should be forced to pay for a new one for me, and that we shouldn't see them until they make up for it somehow

&gt;she agrees but hamplanets gon' hamplanet and they don't do it.

&gt;never did beat the elite 4 till pokemon g/s and gba came out

&gt;guarded that shit like a hamplanet guards their curves


The only apology I got was something to the effect of, ""Sorry your game is broken,"" and then they lectured me more (""be more thankful!"") after I threw a fit that that wasn't an apology at all. They maintain to this day that I was lying, too. Unfortunately, my mom's (overly) forgiving-of-family nature won out, and a few weeks (months? I have no idea) later, we went back and played Mario Kart when we suddenly had to go somewhere, so I very lightly tossed the controlled into a box of pillows next to the TV. Ursa Minor and Major started screaming that I had broken the controller and had to pay them back for it, even when I calmly showed them that it was clearly still in working condition, and my dad looked and them and went, ""So, are you going to pay for her gameboy and game? You can take the cost for a controller out of it."" They shut the fuck up after that.

&gt;  Not naturally skinny, just super anorexic

Back story: I got bullied like all good children, also saw some shit, developed depression, stopped eating, avalanched into anorexia and suicidal thoughts, sought help, found it, happy ending

&gt; Be me in Eating Disorders Clinic waiting room. Reading magazines that smell like hand sanitizer. Love it.

Note: this clinic treats teenagers suffering from ANY ED's - anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, you name it. So the waiting room is full of emotionally distraught teens ranging from size 00 to size XXL. No weight judgement, we all have problems.

&gt; Be pissed as fuck because I hated going to the clinic but whatever

&gt; Suddenly, a disturbance

&gt; Hear whale noises coming from exam room, put down Oprah (shit was real) and observe

&gt; Sounds of a struggle, when Hamplanet emerges from exam room, sweaty and red faced, screaming like crazy, drawing all sorts of attention

&gt; Hamplanet seems my height and age, 'cept 200+ pounds and raging

&gt; lol wut. Search for bones, see none

&gt; ""LOSE WEIGHT? ARE YOU CRAZY! RAGE RAGE RAGE!""

&gt; Doctors try so hard to explain, fat folds cover hamplanets ears, lost cause.

&gt; ""WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU WANT US TO BE SKINNY LIKE YOU, YOU'RE JUST BONES! WE'RE REAL WOMEN BLAH BLAH BLAH""

&gt; I loved being called skinny, was not bothered, however, Rule #1 about anorexia club, you do not insult the members of anorexia club

&gt; I listen to them as they leave, mama planet soothing baby planet promising McShit's to make her feel better

I am a long time lurker and, after reading so many stories and finding many people that have gone through situations like mine, I think it's time I start sharing my saga with everyone.  Before I dive into this multi-part story that may double as my dissertation (kidding, kidding), I'll give you a little background before diving into the good stuff.

I'm currently 23.  I finished up college last year (hurray me!) with a degree in marketing.  I probably took the easy way out in school with that major, but it has landed me a great job that I love, and that's all that matters, right?  

The story I'm about to share with you is a collection of the craziest shit that happened in the house that I lived with two people who are now a couple of my best friends....and our hamplanet in the story, who we will refer to now as Daisy.  Let's start things off!  I won't dive into green text just yet, even though I have a friend helping me out with the formatting.  The story takes place three years ago.

I will apologize, the first entry of this will be a little dull while I give you the backstory!  It's worth it, though!

I had spent two years on campus living in the dorms of the university, both with the same person.  We'll call her Alicia.  Alicia was the yin to my yang almost immediately.  We had similar tastes in music, games, food, men, everything.  It worked out so well, and we wondered why so many people had issues with roommates while we rarely, if ever, had an issue.

Towards the end of our second year, we decide that we're going to get a place off campus.  The issue was that we had started our search late and a lot of places were already booked up, especially since we were looking for just two bedroom places.  We decided to expand our search and look at larger places, figuring we knew enough people that we could scrounge up one or two roommates to fill in the extra spots.  After a couple of days with little luck, we found a place we both fell in love with.

We had found a recently renovated house about seven blocks from campus.  Everything had been redone and it was amazingly huge.  The living space was gigantic, there was a huge kitchen, a half-finished basement with a non-finished portion with washer/dryer hookups, and there were four bedrooms:  Two downstairs and two upstairs.  The cost was a little high, but with two more roommates, we could make it work.  Alicia and I had fallen in love and were already picturing decorating it.  Alicia had extra money from her work and was able to cover the difference for the security deposit.  

But, we had to have all the roommates available to sign.  The security deposit was accepted to hold the place, but we had two weeks to find two more people to sign or they would refund us and let someone else sign the place.

Thankfully, we had a friend of ours who said he knew of a guy that was looking for roommates and arranged a meeting.  We will call him Alex.

Alex was a great guy.  Tall, slender, and a workout warrior.  He was studying audio communications (his official major name was really long and that's what he usually told people) because he wanted to be an audio producer.  He had a hectic schedule, so he said that he was pretty easy to deal with because he was almost never home.  We hit it off with him and he agreed to join in with us, especially after we showed him the place.  He, too, fell in love with the house and was just as excited as we were.

That left one more spot.

We spent a week talking with people we knew, but no luck.  Eventually, we put up an advertisement on the University's housing page that allowed others to look for roommates and also put up an ad on Craigslist.

We received one response:  That came from our hamplanet, Daisy.

Daisy seemed nice enough when talking online.  She said she had some roommate issues the previous year because they didn't respect her privacy (We found out that would be a lie later on, shocker) so she was wanting to move out.  Something did seem a bit off about it, but with us under a time crunch, we agreed to meet up with her at the student union on campus.  Alex could only stay for a little bit because of his insane schedule, but we found a time that worked.

Me, Alicia, and Alex all met up and waited.

And waited.

And waited.

Alex couldn't wait any longer and said he had to get going or he was going to be late for class and then had to work immediately after.  We said we would text him when she showed up.

About five minutes after Alex left, Daisy *finally* came in.  Or, rather, waddled in.

To put this in perspective, Alicia and I are both the same height, about 5'4"".  We were both crazy thin because we worked out a lot, so we were around 120-125.  Daisy was the same height as us, yet was over 300 pounds.  I felt so bad for the chair that she sat on.

""Are you guys Alicia and Cassie?""  Daisy said, obviously excited to meet us.  We both said yes and she sat down, taking a drink from her extra large Wendy's cup that I would assume was full of Diet Coke, but didn't bother asking.

We chatted it up for about twenty minutes and there were no real red flags at the time, until we mentioned Alex.  Daisy suddenly got excited.

*""Oooooo we're going to have a guy live with us?  Is he hot?  I have such a hard time keeping guys off of me because they want my curves so bad!""*

Gag unto me with a spoon, please.  To be fair, Alex was definitely attractive, but that wasn't important for the conversation.

Alicia decided to take over the conversation since I was having issues keeping my recent lunch in my stomach.

""Yes, we will have a guy living with us.  He said he isn't home much because of his schedule but he is very nice!""

Daisy didn't hear the important part and re-iterated what she wanted to know.

*""But is he hot?  I don't know if I can live with a hot guy because he might just live in my room instead tee-hee""*

That was the first time I heard her laugh, and it would become the most annoying sound in my entire life.  I still hear it at night in nightmares.  I sighed and just nodded my head.

""Yes, Alex is a good looking guy, but we are going to be roommates.  We'll work out those details.  We need X dollars from you for the security deposit if you are ready.""

To be honest, Alicia and I after this meeting considered giving the money back and searching until the last day, but she had been our only hit and we did not want to lose the place.

*""Oh!  Yes I have the money!""*

That helped things out, but instead of getting a check, she was calling someone.  We would find out that our hamplanet was basically still living off of her mom and dad.  It didn't bother us, but I wanted to make sure Alicia got her money back as soon as possible.  Alex managed to give her the money after our first meeting right at an ATM.

*""Hi Mommy!  Yes I'm sitting here with my new roommates and I just need X dollars from you for the security deposit! ......But I spent that money already!  I told you I was robbed!""*

The red flag went right over my head as I was trying to tune out her somewhat annoying tone.

*""THANK YOU MOMMY!  I SWEAR I'LL DO BETTER!""*

We texted Alex to tell him that we were bringing her in with some warning that she was a little loud.  Alex didn't care and said as long as she pays rent, he was fine.  He has since said that was the dumbest thing he has said in his life, the poor guy.  We took Daisy over to the place and she loved it, as we all did.  We agreed that we would take care of the lease tomorrow.

The money was wired to her the next day and we arranged to all head to the realty place to sign the lease.  Alex was running just a little late from class, but texted us to let us know he was on his way.  Daisy, however, was running late and we didn't hear from her.  We had texted Alex after our meetup and explained who was living with us.  Alex seemed to attribute it to nerves because he said he was even nervous meeting with two people he didn't know, so we all shrugged it off.

Alicia and I were at the realtor's office at the agreed time.  Alex showed up about ten minutes after that....with Daisy right behind him, Quarter Pounder in one hand and gigantic soft drink in the other, already smitten for Alex and saying that she couldn't wait to live with him.

*""Oh my god I can't believe I'm going to be living with you!  You are so hot!  We are going to get to be so close, you don't even know it!""*

Alex just laughed and smiled, trying to play it off as just excitement.  His eyes were rather wide and his face was red when they walked in, leading to both Alicia and I laughing hysterically.  We signed the lease pretty quickly and were told that even though the lease started on August 1st, they allowed people to move in a couple of weeks sooner if they paid the first month's rent well before move in day.  Alicia had a little money and I was somewhat broke.  Daisy had trouble just getting her mother to send her money, so she was out.  Alex then surprised us by saying he would cover the first month on his own and that the rest of us could pay him back at any time until our lease actually started.  We said we had no problem and he wrote the check to the realtor.  They said we could pick up the keys on July 15th and that was it!

Our first signs of trouble with Daisy started not long after we signed the lease.  

They had given us the keys to go looking through the house and to pick bedrooms.  Daisy, on the way over to the house, stopped at McDonald's again to get yet another QP w/cheese and another drink.  I was blown away, but in retrospect, this was nothing compared to the upcoming disaster that was living with her.  None of us said nothing, but we were all thinking that she probably ate too much and she shouldn't be bringing food and drink into our brand new place before we even moved in.

We split up and started looking at the place up and down, looking for issues with it and seeing who liked what bedroom the most.  Alex said he didn't have too much stuff in his bedroom but had plenty of stuff for the living room, so he was alright with taking a smaller bedroom, which the smallest one was still pretty large.  Daisy didn't say a word until she found out which bedroom Alex wanted, which was one of the bedrooms downstairs, before she decided she wanted the one across from him.

*""Oh Alex and I have to be on the same floor together because we are going to be so close so we might as well be right near each other!""*

I have to give credit to Alex.  He knew what she was insinuating and he took it all in stride.  It worked out, though, because Alicia and I wanted the bedrooms upstairs.  Plus, there was no way any of us pictured our new hamplanet of a roommate to waddle up the steps.  She was winded just going up the front three to get into the house!

After this, we're walking around the house.  Alex had gone downstairs to check out the basement while Alicia went back upstairs to see the bathroom and closet space.  Daisy was in the kitchen, bitching about the size of the fridge and freezer, though she did have a point:  That refrigerator was damned small for four people.  I then watched as Daisy set her trash from McDonalds on the counter and just wandered off.

""Daisy, you're taking that with you to throw out, right?""

*""I'm done with it, though!  I'm not going to carry around an empty bag!""*

""We haven't even moved in yet!  They still have to paint this place and I don't want them thinking we don't care about the place before we move in!""

Scoffing rather loudly, she came back in.

*""Well, fine!  I didn't think it was that big of a deal!  GOSH!  ALLLLLEEEEXXXX!""*

I didn't think I would ever meet a fat valley girl.  I was wrong.  She was worse than any valley girl I had ever met.  Still, we were committed now.

Alex came upstairs again, wondering why he was being called up.

""What's up?""

*""ALLLLEEEXXXX, WILL YOU BE A DEAR AND THROW OUT MY STUFF FOR ME?  I NEED TO SIT DOWN FOR A BIT!""*

Alex raised an eyebrow, but shrugged and walked into the kitchen to grab her trash.  There was a dumpster out back, so he headed out there and threw it away.  While he was gone, Daisy took that as him liking her.

*""See, Cassie?  When you have curves like I do, men do things for you!  You should really stop being so skinny and put on curves!  Men will do whatever you want!""*

I'm 5'4, 120, with a great body, thank you.  I'm also not a heartless bitch and like doing things for myself.

A little angered, I went back upstairs to find Alicia, who was literally stepping off the space to figure out how to layout her room.

""Alicia, do you think we were too hasty with our roommate decision?""

She looked at me a bit odd and shrugged.

""I hope not, but I figure it's just that we haven't all really bonded.  I think it will work itself out.""

""Yeah, I think so.""


We were so wrong, we had no clue.  We all left after that and agreed to keep in touch with each other until move-in day.  Alex warned us he would be tough to meet up with, but agreed that we should have a couple of nights out between now and then, especially after school finished up.

That will be all for this installment, gang!  The next chapter will be much better as we get to move-in day and realize just how wrong we were about our dear hamplanet and her social skills!


**TL;DR - Roomie and I bring in two new roomies for awesome house!  Guy roommate is amazing!  Hamplanet gives us red flags we ignore and sign lease with everyone!**

1375533112.0	1jmgfc	404: Face not found	verbosegf	871	166	55	"I live with my fiance's family. Last night, after dinner, Uncle Mega-Ham (about 400 or 500 lbs) and Aunt Ultra-Planet (400 or 500 lbs as well) along with their granddaughter Twister showed up to visit. We always visit out in the garage because there's enough space out there for all of us.

I have been losing weight since April and have lost 32 lbs. They don't see us very often, so when they see me, Uncle usually makes comment about the weight I have lost. Always good comments, though. He's an awesome person.

This time, when they saw me, Uncle says, ""Verbosegf! You keep losing weight and you'll be a skinny Minnie!""

I smiled and said, ""And I'm not even to my halfway goal yet!""

Aunt scoffed.

It was awkward for a few seconds until someone else changed the conversation.

Later on, we heard the ice cream truck. Twister was super excited. She's a tiny little ball of energy, about 3 or 4 years of age. My fiance's sister went and got her an ice cream sandwich. Twister ran around nibbling on her ice cream until she forgot about it and ended up dropping it on the dirty, oily garage floor. 

""Twister!"" Aunt yelled, furious. ""You're wasting that, bring it here now!""

Twister picked it up and ran it over to her grandmother, who snatched it away from her and scolded her for wasting such a delicious treat. She sent Twister to go away to play, and then... bit into the ice cream.

Without even dusting it off.

Even after it had been dropped on a garage floor that has seen all kinds of vehicular juices.

She ate it. Well, more like inhaled because that thing was gone in two bites.

I felt sick."	t5_2vzax	True
1375978548.0	1jyon1	[X-post] How I left my first job...	ZshadeZ	842	140	96	"**Preface:** This is the story of how I left my first job in retail. It doesn't include a lot of fatlogic, so I posted to /r/talesfromretail but received several PMs and replies telling me to post it here. I understand if it's taken down because it has no mention of condishuns or disabilities. For a bit I had considered embellishing it to make it more FPSable, but I'd decided to just post what actually went down to TFR.

At 16 I was finally able to get a job and start making me some monies. Applied at a few local places and ended up taking a job at Fat Krispy Chicken (FKC). For the few weeks there were no issues. I was a computer nerd already, so learning the register and procedures was a cinch. I only worked 12 hours per week still being in highschool.

My manager was a 25 year-old bitch, at this point. She'd been thin and pretty but not-so-bright when she started working there and had gained quite a bit of weight due to her free manager meals of complete grease. She hated that I packed a lunch from home instead of eating the slop we served. Topping it off, I'd caught on to things way quicker than she had and people talked about it and it caused her to hate me.

In my third week I'm up front manning the register when a couple walks in... a very large couple. 350lb+ each. The man wheezes up to the counter and makes their to-go order of a 14 piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes. I'm thinking this is a big order, but their big people, and I don't know how many people they're going to be feeding anyway.

I ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells: ""I'm eating too!"" ... wut? She orders 24 hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies. Seriously. She then follows that up with ""And I need a large diet Coke."" at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet Coke as well.

I'm laughing internally at this point, but it is a to-go order and they probably have a few kids or another family coming over... something. Right? It has to be.

Their order comes up and they take the gargantuan bags of food... to the dine-in tables.

Me: I'm sorry folks, I thought you'd ordered that for take-out, I could get you some trays if you'd like.""

Man: Don't need trays. We always order take-out because I'm not paying tax to eat here!

Cheap fucks. They just spent nearly $40 on food but can't pay the tax? Eh. Whatever. I go about my day and start cleaning the lobby. I'm mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up. I figured something must be wrong so I look to see and.... the food's all gone. In roughly 7 minutes. Nearly 17,000 calories of extra krispy, wings, and potatoes.

Stunned silence. I'm staring at the trays covered in bones and destruction that these customers kindly left for us to clean instead of throwing their trash out.

Woman notices me staring and and gets pissed. Calls for manager. Manager comes up and listens to how badly I treated them by acting like she wouldn't be eating too and then making fun of them for eating a healthy (wut?) meal.

She told me in front of the customers that I had two choices. 1. Apologize to the customers for my rudeness and take a write up or 2. Termination. Fat lady customer was smiling and pleased with herself.

I laughed and told her if working there was going to turn me into a fat angry slob like her and our wonderful customers then leaving this job would be a blessing. Took my apron off and put it on the counter, clocked out and headed for the door. The whole time the fatties are bitching at me and manager both: ""Come back here! Are you going to let him...!"" and manager is trying to calm them down and yell at me: ""Come back here! You can't do..."" and it's all just background noise, because it suddenly feels like all weight and stress has been removed from my shoulders.

Still one of my best retail/food memories.

Wherein I prank Ginger, and she retaliates.

About two weeks pass without any major incident between Ginger and Eric. To this day, Eric maintains that he only gave Ginger a friendly warning after the disaster dinner between him, Ginger, and Cheryl. But whatever he said, it made the Post-its, the flirting, and Ginger prancing around Eric in a mini-skirt stop... for a while, at least.

It was around the end of September by then, and it was at that time Cheryl and Eric broke up. Everyone could kind of sense it was coming, but Eric was still pretty bummed. His birthday was coming up, which kind of made it worse. So Yuri and I decided to come up with an early birthday present for him.

Ginger fact: She does not drink anything but pop. Not even juice. Ginger's favorite is Dr. Pepper. Yuri has the brilliant idea of replacing the Dr. Pepper with prune juice. It works, brilliantly, and Eric cheers up a bit when he sees Ginger start to chug what she thinks will be a two-liter of Dr. Pepper, starts gagging, and spits prune juice all over the carpet. She guesses, correctly, that Yuri and I did it. But mostly that I did it. Because I was so jealous of her because she was ""popular and beautiful and she doesn't have to starve herself to make people like her.""

Ginger's been enjoying her freedom from her parents. She's bought a new wardrobe (push-up bras, mini-skirts, booby tops), started going out to clubs, learned to drive, and has actually made a bunch of friends at school so suddenly she thinks she's hot stuff. Ginger still calls Mama and Daddy when her roommates are being mean to her, but aside from reciting some snippets of religious hypocrisy she's cooled. Just like a dormant volcano. And boy, did it erupt.

So, Eric's birthday. We convince him to take the night off, and make a reservation for dinner at this fancy restaurant. It was Eric, Yuri and his boyfriend Scott, me and my boyfriend Luke, and fucking Ginger. Ginger gives Eric an iPod touch for his birthday. Eric grew up very poor, he's not used to expensive presents, and he's delighted by the gift. In return for her generosity Eric decides to invite her to dinner. Keep in mind that it was Cheryl that was supposed to go in Ginger's place. Ginger thinks this is finally her chance to get with Eric. And to get back at me.

I should mention that Luke and I were not doing so great at the time. We didn't break off permanently yet, but we were on and off a lot. Ah, college. Luke's jealously was the biggest problem. He didn't like it when I would hang out with my male friends without him there. On Eric's birthday, we were doing okay. By the end of the night, though...

Like I mentioned before it was a nice restaurants, and everyone's dressed to impress. The boys are wearing ties and sports coats and I'm wearing a sexy little black dress. Everyone looks fantastic, except for Ginger. She really outdid herself this time. She wore very heavy make-up and this strapless hot pink tulle dress that only reached halfway to her knees. Holy stretch marks. But aside from that, she wasn't being as loud as her usual self so we didn't bring up how horrible she looked.

We get to the restaurant- we agreed that we'd all pay for ourselves separately except for Eric, who we'd all pay a share for so no one bats an eye when Ginger orders four entrees. I actually wish I'd gotten another order too, because those portions were tiny. We make it to dessert with no problems. Then, I leave to use the restroom. When I get back, that's when I notice something's different in the air. Luke, Eric, and Yuri looked pissed. Ginger looked at me so smugly and I got worried. Luke was ice cold. We have to wait for Ginger to finish her desserts- she ordered more than one, of course, and we all leave separately. Outside in the parking lot, Luke completely ignores me while I try to ask him what's going on and just drives off.

I'd ridden with Luke on the way to the restaurant, but I had to ride back home with Yuri, Eric, and Scott. They tell me what happened while I was in the restroom. Supposedly, Ginger was upset to notice that Eric was checking me out as I was walking away (Eric denied this) and let it slip to Luke that I was crashing in Eric's room whenever Scott stayed over. She neglected to mention that I was sleeping on the floor and Eric was on the bed. Luke, Yuri says, went deathly quiet. Yuri tried to explain that Ginger was usually in the living room until 2am most nights and I was in a sleeping bag, but Luke wouldn't listen. He wouldn't talk to me for days.

I was shaking with anger by this point. When Ginger got home, I went into her room and started yelling at her for what she said to Luke. Ginger had the audacity to deny implying to Luke that Eric and I were sleeping together at first- ""Everyone was just running out of stories to tell and I thought Luke would already know ^tee ^hee."" ""Fuck you, you're lying out of your ass, you deluded fucking bitch!""- Me. That got her to admit it, and she said that I deserved it for being such an attention-seeking whore. ""You know that I'd bought a new dress just for Eric's birthday and you had to show me up!"" she yelled at me. I'm not proud of this, but I started grabbing the stuff on her table, make-up and DVDs and mangas, and started throwing them at the wall behind her. Ginger started screeching in terror and saying she was going to call the police on me for trying to kill her. The boys forced us apart and convinced me to sleep it off, but only after I cried about Luke for an hour.

We woke up two hours later to the sounds of Eric screaming at Ginger. Yuri and I run to his room, and find the grossest thing we've ever seen. Ginger crying, and wearing goddamned lingerie. She ran to her room in tears. Eric had been almost asleep when Ginger came into his room and sat on his bed, saying ""I have a second birthday present for you."" Eric turned on his desk lamp, saw Ginger in her lingerie, and freaked out. He screamed at her to get out of his room, and she started crying from rejection. I was already too exhausted to have another match with Ginger, so we all just went back to sleep on the lullaby of Ginger's sobs. The next morning, Eric gave Ginger back the Ipod touch and said, ""No, thank you."" Then he went and bought a lock for his door.

All my kids are a healthy weight, but high cholesterol is crazy in our family, and 2 of them were high at one point despite eating healthy and being in sports.  Spend a few months tweaking the already healthy diet a little more to get their cholesterol down, and succeed.  *feels good man* 


&gt;&gt;Do not be my ex's live in massive ham planet diabetic girlfriend who brags about living off gummy bears, jelly beans, krispy kreme, pork rinds, McDonald's, and Red Robin.  Weighs in at least 400 pounds-largest cankles I have ever seen in my life.  


&gt;&gt;Send kids for visit to dad's house.


&gt;&gt;Now, be my 9 year old.


&gt;&gt;Used to eating fruits, veggies, lean meats, unprocessed foods.


&gt;&gt;You are being fed a mess of chips, fried chicken, packaged cakes, and other junk food for days on end.


&gt;&gt;Make comment about how you think eating all this unhealthy food can make you fat, ask about eating healthy food instead.


&gt;&gt;ENTER THE WHALE


&gt;&gt;""It doesn't matter if you're fat-there is nothing bad about being fat!""

&gt;&gt;9 year old makes comment about heart health (we had an overweight relative die last year of heart failure, so to my kid, healthy food is about being healthy, not skinny)


&gt;&gt;Shamu takes a different approach ""YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR HEALTH AND WHAT YOU EAT.  YOU CAN EAT ANYTHING YOU WANT.  YOUR MOM JUST DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THESE FOODS BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LIKE THEM.""


&gt;&gt;*EXCUSE ME?*  


&gt;&gt;Be me again.


&gt;&gt;Kids come back, all is good (with the exception of the youngest being constipated).


&gt;&gt;*THE EMAILS BEGIN*


&gt;&gt;Lard mouth uses my ex's email to send me messages that I am fat shaming the kids, teaching them to hate their bodies and be self conscious.


&gt;&gt;Talk to kids, actually get nauseated hearing what they ate that week.  9 year old tells me what happened-says he got yelled at for asking for fucking *brussel sprouts.*


&gt;&gt;Call ex to discuss the issue.


&gt;&gt;*He has no idea what emails I am referring to-says fatzilla must have sent them* (not the first time she's done this)


&gt;&gt;Knowing the great white whale will read it, send an email explaining that there is a difference between fat shaming and teaching good eating habits, since I value my children's health and wouldn't want to see my kids grow up to be obese adults with diabetes and health complications.


&gt;&gt;Get email saying I am trying to justify ""emotionally abusing"" my children.
 

&gt;&gt;*SERIOUSLY FAT LOGIC, ARE YOU SERIOUS?  TEACHING MY KIDS TO EAT HEALTHY IS EMOTIONAL ABUSE TO YOU?*


I wish this ended better, but instead it ended with me calling the ex and telling him if she kept harassing me with his email, I would take it to court (since he's the only one allowed to contact me about them per court orders and she was emailing me while he was at work all day).


Last week, the queen of the fries drove with the ex to drop off the kids.  She didn't get out of the car like she usually does to stare me down under her forehead folds-she stayed in the car instead.


&gt;&gt;Not sure if she doesn't want to be confronted, or if she is trapped in the car...

&gt;Used to be dangerously close to having own gravitational field, but lost the weight and got all fit and sexy (6'3 195 lbs)

&gt;Was raised by single mother

&gt;Mother was loving but brainwashed us kids with her fatlogic and fed us on a diet of garbage

&gt;Family Pictures looked like a Hamplanet being orbited by several Ham-moons

&gt;Twin sister was positively planet-sized too (5'9 270lbs)

&gt;Reacted to my weight loss with the jealousy and fatlogic you would expect

&gt;Said that since we were different genders we must have got other different genes too

&gt;Said I shouldn't shove my thin-gene privilege in her (big fat) face

&gt;I was too polite to tell her I must have got the intelligence gene she missed out on too

&gt;Wanted the fat bitch to get better, I knew how hard it was being a bloated landwhale and mired in fatlogic

&gt;Kept encouraging her, didn't even call her a fat bitch out loud

&gt;Goodbrother.jpeg

&gt;Her boyfriend (finally) dumps her for all her weight gain and associated personality issues

&gt;After weeks of blaming everyone else she finally accepts responsibility

&gt;Declares that she is going on a calorie-restricted diet

&gt;I am living away from her now, but give her all the encouragement I can

&gt;Offer to make her up an eating and exercise plan, but she says she has researched it and has it covered

&gt;Says that she has decided to restrict herself to 75% of her daily calorie intake needs to start with

&gt;Soundsgood.gif

&gt;Weeks go by, sister is sticking to her diet, but complaining that she is hungry all the time and feels weak and like she might faint from hunger

&gt;Says 75% daily intake is not enough, she is literally STARVING on this diet

&gt;I ignore her bullshit, reassure her that it is safe, and give more encouragement

&gt;To her credit she sticks with it, even though she never stops her complaints about being STARVING all the time and feeling faint

&gt;After a few weeks of her diet I return home and see her for the first time

&gt;Am disappointed to see that she is just as fat as I remember, maybe even fatter

&gt;Bitchmusthavebeenlying.jpg

&gt;When I walk in the door I see her stuffing her face with a whole loaf of bread slathered in butter

&gt;Get angry with her, can't help it. Don't like being lied to

&gt;I had been so happy for her

&gt;Fat bitch then gets all indignant that I am yelling at her

&gt;She has done the math and the bread and butter is only 2,000 calories

&gt;That's a whole day's worth of food, I tell the bloated beast

&gt;No it's not, she replies, I've researched this and the daily requirement for a woman maintaining her weight is almost 9,000 calories

&gt;She tells me she can eat 4,000 more calories today and still be losing a significant amount of weight

&gt;Words fail me, my vision clouds, all I see is the fuzzy outline of a mountain of lard smeared in bread crumbs and butter

&gt;The planet had mistaken calories for kilojoules

&gt;Had been eating three times her daily needs and had thought she was on a diet

&gt;And had kept saying her ""diet"" was leaving her feeling weak and STARVING

&gt;When speech returned I told her the news

&gt;At first came denial

&gt;Then abuse

&gt;Then a stream of fatlogic

&gt;Then she started crying

&gt;I tried to put her on a real diet after this, but she never lasted more than a couple of days and would lie through her teeth

&gt;Eventually had to give up

&gt;She is now even fatter than ever

1370486721.0	1frl08	Weight loss shaming doctor	Cognac76	809	116	117	"Having worked as a Personal Trainer for many years, I have seen my share of overweight people. I am always proud of the ones I see, as they have taken control of their weight, and accepted responsibility for it by contacting me, and asking for my help. I understand how easy it is for people to put on weight, as they get caught up with work, family, etc, the time to exercise or play sport decreases, snacks increase, that occasional bad meal becomes more and more common, and before they know it, they are a lot bigger than they realise. But this story is about Rachel, a client who had tried just about everything before calling me. She had tried Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, those places who deliver 'calorie controlled' meals to your door, even had mutliple consultations with her doctor (who was herself overweight) in an effort to get her weight under control. But obviously, none of that had worked. 
When I met Rachel, she was 5'1, 270lb. I worked on her diet, and actually increased the amount she was eating (but got rid of the rubbish, and increased the good stuff), and got her moving. The weight started dropping off. Three months in, and she had lost 54lb, was fitter, and feeling 100 times better about herself. She still had a long way to go, but she was definitely heading in the right direction. 
At this point, I had her visit her doctor again (I always get obese clients to visit doctors regularly, to check BP, cholesterol, etc). What I heard afterwards was this - As she walked in to her appointment, the Doctor said ""Oh my god, what have you been doing? You have lost so much weight"". Feeling proud that the Doc had noticed, Rachel said ""Yes, I have, isnt it great? I have been seeing a Personal Trainer"" The Doctor replied ""You must have been starving yourself"" ""No, I have actually been eating more than I used to. I am having to make myself eat my meals"" ""Well he must be working you into the ground each day, that isnt healthy for you, you will have to slow down"" ""Actually, we only do three sessions a week, and whilst I am always tired after, I feel good for doing it"" ""I dont believe it, you must be doing something else. Does he have you taking any drugs"" ""No, just eating well and exercising"" ""Rubbish, nobody can lose weight like that. You are lying to me. Why wont you tell me the truth?""  At this point, Rachel became so upset, she left and started crying. Her doctor was not only unsupportive, but downright insulting, that someone else could lose weight so easily, when she, a health professional, had no idea how to lose weight herself, and was still obese.
This really disgusted me, but I was so proud of Rachel, as she told me that she wasnt going to let this woman get her down, and she had already made an appointment to see a new doctor."	t5_2vzax	True
1367960981.0	1dvy85	"Eventual Planet wants a ""summer body."""	SometimesIArt	868	172	262	"Alright, guys. People are asking me for updates on my growing roommate (who knew you all love fat people novellas so much...). If you haven't heard from me before, take a learnin' or refresher [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1c8dqy/my_roommate_the_eventual_planet/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1cbd4h/my_roommate_the_eventual_planet_no_one_else_gets/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1crj67/when_worlds_collide_moon_somehow_ends_up_at_my/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1cxjo2/its_5am_here_and_im_probably_going_to_fight/). 

Or, if you don't want to, the basic backstory is that I moved in with a normal-sized person and she has been rapidly expanding over the past year. Along with her I live with a tiny girl who is trying to gain weight and a British guy who is also tiny but doesn't give a fuck. Expanding roommate (Eventual Planet) is, despite my best efforts, diving deeper into the realm of fatlogic and likes to judge others openly/be a general passive-agressive jerk.

Alright, here we go!

*** 

Last week Eventual Planet realized that summer is near and that means summer clothing. Upon trying on summer clothes I think she realized how much she's actually gained and came to me upset about how ""ugly"" she looks. 

I actually felt really really bad for her and offered to help her out with health (for the millionth time, though). 

""No, I know how to take care of myself, thanks."" Alright, whatever.

A couple of days go by. 

Some days I take Tiny Roommate along for a 3k loop of my run because she's trying to get into running. As the two of us were getting back from one such run we find Eventual Planet in the living room in workout gear, stretching. 

""I'm going on a run!"" 

Awesome! I am so happy for her, I give her a high five and tell her that's awesome. She asks where my running route is and I tell her of 1, 3, and 5k routes depending on how far she wants to go. She takes off. 

15 minutes later she's back. I'm a little confused but whatever, she's just starting out and it's good to not push too hard. 

""Man, that was hard! I did the 3k route though!"" 

... I can barely do 3k (1.8 miles) in 15 minutes. And I run a lot. I ask her if she's sure that's the loop she did and she said ""yep! But I had to walk a bunch, I'm no good at running yet."" 

""Eventual Planet, I don't think you did 3k in 15 minutes, especially if you walked."" 

""15 minutes! I did at least half an hour!"" 

... no. Okay. Whatever. 

Next day rolls around. She's actually going out again! YEAH! Beforehand she asks me about healthy workouts and healthy eating, and I give her a run down on strength training, healthy foods, and slow buildups. I offer to get her started and to let her borrow my P90X dvds. I offer to help her go food shopping, she actually agrees. I tell her about baby steps and cheat days. Finally, as she's ready to leave, I give her the route directions again just to be sure she knows where she's going distance-wise, and suddenly she brushes me off and leaves. 20 minutes later, this time, she comes back and happily announces she did the 5k loop. 

What? No. *My* 5k time, if I push it, is ~24 minutes. There's no way she did it in 20. I'm starting to get suspicious. I ask her again if she's sure and she gets angry. 

""Maybe I'm just really good at running, SometimesIart!"" Well fuck, okay, sorry for helping. Didn't realize anyone could pull off a 20 minute 5k after not once running for over a year. 

That night, she's making dinner. Steak. Lots of steak. With mushroom and cheese sauce. With fries on the side. Oh, and veggies! ... fried in butter then covered in cheese and salt. Big scoop of ice cream for dessert. 

""Eventual Planet, remember earlier when we talked about healthy eating? That's NOT it."" 

""Oh but I've done so well working out and you did say you need to take cheat days!"" 

""Not on day one of your diet!"" 

""Well I ran off all of these calories this morning anyways, so it's not going to hurt."" 

Huge steak ~450cal

Cheese sauce ~250cal

Butter, with how much she used (~2 servings if I give her the benefit of the doubt) ~140cal 

French fries, ~250cal

Ice cream, about a cup, ~290cal

~1380 calories. You did not ""run"" off 1380 calories in 20 minutes.

""OP, you know I don't count calories, that doesn't matter as long as I'm healthy. It's just one meal, calm down."" 

Alright, whatever, leave it be. She's right, it is just one meal.

Next morning. 

3-egg omelette with cheese (and veggies, so yay?), 6 strips of bacon, 2 pieces of white toast with butter, all fried in grease or butter, with large Starbucks frap with whipped cream. 

""Eventual Planet, what the fuck?!"" 

""It's healthy because it's well-rounded and has veggies!"" 

Give her another health food speech to try and convince her otherwise. She gets angry and storms off, breakfast in hand. Comes back an hour later as I'm working (one of my jobs I work from home) and is crying. Can't fit into her shorts and it's 35C (95F) outside. I feel bad again and try to confort her, she tells me it's not fair she's gotten fat. I tell her she can change if she actually works for it. She wants to lose weight in time for summer to be in full swing. 

Okay, assuming we mean by the time July hits, that's two months, ~8 weeks, ~16lbs. 

""But OP, I want a summer body! I need to lose more than that!"" 

... I explain why 2lbs a week is a pretty good goal and leave it at that when she gets really angry/starts raising her voice again. 

Lunch time! 

Grilled cheese sandwich. White bread, grilled using butter on the pan.

FUCKING DAMMIT EVENTUAL PLANET, NO! 

""It's okay, it's only one sandwich! That's a smaller meal that what you're eating!"" 

I look down at my huge bowl of salad, sigh.

Next day, run time with Tiny Roommate. Eventual Planet wants to come, yay! What I usually do is run an 8k loop, come back for TR, and do a 3k run with her. I come around and we take off, and after about 2 blocks we have to stop and take a walking break... because Eventual Planet. 

By the time we've done 2k, it's been 20 minutes (20min 5k my ass) and Eventual Planet sounds like she's dying. It takes us a full 28 minutes to do a 3k loop, and when we get back Eventual Planet goes full rage. 

""You can't just go stupidly fast when you have a new runner with you! I know you run a lot but taking off like that was just rude! You told me you'd take it easy! I'm trying to get in shape, and you and Tiny Roommate just couldn't care less about helping me!"" 

... we ran at maybe 4.5mph, a slow jog, because we were scared EP was going to drop dead. Also what the fuck have I been doing for the past week?!

So anyways, she hasn't run since then, and that was on Friday. I made her one healthy meal (Salad with balsamic vinegar dressing, nuts and berries added in) to give her an idea of a healthy lunch, and she actually took it and used it as a side dish. She took a full meal salad and ate it with a chicken burger with cheese and bacon on a white bread bun. She's been bitchy and nasty to me for a week straight, and has even gone so far as to say she can't help out with housework because she's ""too sore from working out."" I shit you not. She hasn't even done anything other than the three runs.

She's just impossible to deal with right now, is on a daily basis bitching about how unhappy she is with her body, and then turns around and bites the head off of anyone who tries to help her. However, if I just ignore her bitching, she actually starts crying and yelling about how no one cares that she's unhappy. I have taken to working in the back yard where she can't find me. 

Because she's not fucking leaving the house. 

I don't think she's gonna make it.

**TL;DR**: Roommate finally realizes how much weight she's gained, asks advice on how to lose weight. Ignores all diet advice and is unnecessarily mean and nasty to everyone trying to help her. 

***

**bonus**, this just happened 30 seconds ago: 

She walks in on me making lunch/typing out this story (activate ninja window-switching), starts complaining about how sluggish she feels today and how she has a headache. 

I tell her if she downs some water and goes for a run she'll feel way better. She glares at me and comes back with, 

""Or I could just take a nap like a fucking normal person."" and walks out.

1372883251.0	1hl908	How I oppressed some poor big boned lady with a condition and her husband and almost killed them at a amusement park.	Ploggy	902	211	194	"[The beluga whale who cried rape and fat shaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1cyn0s/the_best_way_to_tell_someone_you_just_met_that/)

This is a tale about me 172cm(I know the other story says 175, but new measurement puts me at 172) at 70kg, FemaleSun at approx 150cm and 200kg and MaleSun at 180cm and 230kg

So I was in America on vacation at some fairly large amusement park, can't remember name and none of our pictures got a hold of the name that I can see. We got there maybe two hours before the ""incident"" I was in some shop looking at things while one of my brothers has my backpack with our snacks and drinks in it. I finish browsing and not buying anything I come outside and what I can only imagine happening was my brother was snacking on some nuts out of a bag and this ""lady"" comes up and just snatches it out of his hands. The look on my brother face tell me it wasn't a voluntary offering of nuts. I yell at my brother in Swedish to the effect of

&gt;ME: What the fuck is she doing with our nuts?!

My brother responds with

&gt;BROTHER: I was eating and she came up and just grabbed them and starting munching them down!

Now this is word for word as I can remember it I'm coming out of the store about 5 meters from my brother and her I yell

&gt;ME: OI! What the fuck are you doing you cunt!?

Her response and taken aback at the harsh word

&gt;FEMALE SUN: I needed a snack, my blood sugar was low! He didn't seem to need the nuts OR mind me eating them. Also you can't call a lady that word!

I responded with 

&gt;ME: Listen to me you fat disgusting cunt! You can't just grab stuff, especially food out of people you don't even know hands! And I'll call you whatever the fuck I like! Give them back and fucking apologize!

She was astonished and angry that I talked to her that way. At the same time her husband rolled around on a scooter screaming

&gt;MALE SUN: You cant talk to my wife that way! Apologize now!

She nodding in agreement

&gt;MALE SUN: Apologize or I'll call the cops on you!

I literally couldn't believe that they could be so stupid as to think that would work

&gt;ME: The cops won't do shit retard, if anything they will arrest your wife for theft! She stole our snack!

&gt;MALE SUN: She needed that for her blood sugar, they could arrest you for attempted murder because you wanted her to die of low blood sugar!

She tries to give her husband the bag of nuts, as she reaches out with her stubby little arms I grab the bag from her and throws it in a trash bin.

She yells

&gt;FEMALE SUN: HEY!

At this point several people had stopped what they were doing and just watching, and I hate when people watch so I get madder.

&gt;ME: Are you fucking stupid? That's not how laws work. Your disgusting fat piece of shit wife stole our snack, you need to pay and apologize.

&gt;MALE SUN: NO!

A security guard comes along to see what the yelling is about, we give our versions to the guard, me and my brother telling how it actually went down and them fabricating this massive story.

&gt;MALE SUN: My wife was eating *our* snack and these two came up and started yelling, that we needed to pay them or they would beat us or even kill us! We are scared for our lives. He also threw our nuts in the garbage can!

His wife chimes in

&gt;FEMALE SUN: He was fat-shaming me, calling me fat, and disgusting! I have a condition, I can't help that I'm big boned and have TWO! Diseases!

She actually literally truthfully said that. The guard asks if this was true, I tell him 

&gt;ME: No, it is not true one bit. Except the name calling and me throwing the nuts in the trash bin after she tried to give them to her husband.

He gets this look on his face, like I was in the wrong and a bystander chimes in saying our story was the correct one and that she has proof on her video camera. The couple of stars get flustered. The guard takes my side and asks them to apologize. I chime in

&gt;ME: They need to pay for our nuts, we don't know what her disgusting hands have touched, we don't want to risk being sick, that's why I threw them away!

The guard agrees, and ask how much it was. They protest. Tell him it was about 30 dollars and show him a receipt

The male sun says.

&gt;MALE SUN: We're not paying for that!

The guard says if you are not paying for it, he is going to call the police and have them arrested for theft, I get a smug look on my face. They looked distressed at the idea of being arrested and not being able to eat however much they want. They pay up. Just as we are about to leave to find our parents I spit on the ground and say.

&gt;ME: Pathetic that you let yourself get that fat, incredibly disgusting!

I just turn around and walk off, I hear the gasps of both of them and the guard saying that they need to leave now. They yell.

&gt;FEMALE SUN: You can't do this! This is discrimination against bigger people, we have a condition!

And

&gt;MALE SUN: We just got here, we paid good money for this! You can't do this! We'll sue!

I get a smile on my face and turn around to see her getting on a scooter as well. Amazed she could stand that long with her condition.

I have spoken mostly of RW's mother in my comments, but not very much in my stories. Here, I will tell you of my only meeting with her mother. She's about 5'4, a little bent over, in her 80s and not very healthy. I'd say she's probably about 120-130ish lbs. Thin old lady look.

She has two doctors appointments every week, which RW has to drive her to. Usually RW comes herself to pick up prescriptions, but one day her mother came in with her.

We will refer to her as Mother.

&gt; Workin' like a boss on a long shift

&gt; RW thunders her way into the store

&gt; Thirty seconds later she is trailed by an elderly woman with a cane

&gt; Do not associate the two as old woman is not a whale

&gt; RW waddles over to the pharmacy

&gt; Elderly woman stops by Customer Service

&gt; Being Customer Service, I ask her ""Can I help you with anything, ma'am?""

&gt; Sweet southern lady accent ""Oh, no darlin'. I'm just waitin' for my daughter to get my medicine. I'll be outta your way here shortly.""

&gt; Smile (nice people are rare enough) ""You're not in the way, dear. Would you like to sit down and wait? We've got a bench over by the pharmacy if you're not feeling well.""

&gt; Mother ""Oh, don't worry your heart about me. I'm stronger than I look.""

&gt; She winks.

&gt; I chuckle.

&gt; Start conversing so she doesn't feel awkward (slow time of the day, no customers at my station)

&gt; ""So have you lived in the area long?""

&gt; Mother ""Oh my whole life, sweetheart. I've gone a few places, but never too far from home. I love it here.""

This is fairly typical of people in this area. Those who are born and raised here, very rarely break away. Most of them have never been farther than 100 miles away.

&gt; ""I just moved here less than a year ago, but I love it to. The mountains are just lovely.""

&gt; RW reappears with all her thunder.

&gt; RW ""OKAY MOM. It's time to go. I told you not to talk to that woman, she's a sinner.""

&gt; Mother looks RW in the face ""We're all sinners in our time. You shouldn't judge her so, she's a sweet thing.""

&gt; RW makes a song of disgust ""I've told you, mom, you don't *know* what these young girls are *like*. This isn't your time anymore. She's an anorexic floozy.""

&gt; Mother looks cross, ""She was sweet to me. You won't speak ill of her in front of me.""

&gt; RW ""I can't believe you're taking her side! Just because you can't gain weight doesn't mean you have to side with skinny people all the time!""

&gt; Mother ""I might gain weight if you didn't eat everything in the house for dinner.""

&gt; Haaaaaaaaahahaha oh shit.

&gt; Stay silent, because holy hell. I love this woman.

&gt; RW ""I eat healthy amounts of food! You never have an appetite and it would go to waste if I didn't eat it! I'm doing you a *favor.*""

&gt; Mother ""You're living in my home, you're not payin' bills. We don't need to have this conversation in public in front of strangers. You're embarrassing yourself.""

&gt; RW ""I take you to all your appointments! I feed you! *I take care of you.*""

&gt; Mother ""The only thing you do is bring home food, which is mostly for you. You don't clean, you don't do laundry, you don't put money toward bills. Darlin', your whole life I've taken care of you. Even if your momma didn't want you and your daddy split, that doesn't mean you can pay me any less respect. I raised you, I *am* your mother.""

&gt; RW explodes ""WE ARE GOING HOME *NOW*. HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THIS AT WORK!""

&gt; So happy it's a slow time at work so I can listen to all the madness.

&gt; Interjection! ""To be fair, she did try to make you stop, but you kept going on. It's not her fault that you don't know when to be quiet.""

&gt; RW gets red in the face, but doesn't speak.

&gt; Mother ""I thought I'd raised her better than this. I did my best by her, and this is what I have now.""

&gt; RW ""We're leaving NOW. My order is ready across the street."" (Italian tiiiime!)

&gt; RW storms off to get her sustenance.

&gt; Mother ""I'm sorry, darlin'. I wouldn't say anything, but she doesn't need to treat you so. She's a good girl most of the time. I tried to raise her right, but I could only do so much on my own.""

&gt; Smile ""It's alright. I'm used to her by now. I just wish she didn't talk to you that way.""

&gt; Mother chuckles ""She only does it in public because of her pride. She'll cry and apologize as soon as we get home. She always does.""

&gt; Mother hobbles out.

TL;DR - RW gets into an argument with her mother at Customer Service, find out her mom and dad ditched her. RW blames mother for wasting food.

This was the only interaction I've had with her mother. She was a very sweet old lady, but she didn't take shit off her daughter (legally adopted) when she was being a bitch in public."	t5_2vzax	True
1371487507.0	1givvq	fat logic hard at work… side order of racism, too (pt2)	idgygdi	878	187	75	"read this first [part 1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gijn4/fat_logic_hard_at_work_side_order_of_racism_too/) and then come back to this story. There *may* be more later; depends on whether or not she brings this issue any farther.

&gt; so I get off a phone call with HR lady and not to my surprise, sweaty mcfatty (smf) has complained about a few things that my HR advisor passed onto the two of us. myself and offendedblackguy (obg)

&gt; In an email to obg and I, smf claims that this man, was more racist than she was. I rebutted “there is a severe difference between blunt racism, and racism muttered at an inaudible tone that is in retaliation to said initial racism”

&gt; “no excuses” says the HR lady.

&gt; obg apologizes immediately. that was his very first thought after he found out that she heard him.

&gt; thinking that’s done, HR lady moves onto the next topic

&gt; “smf claims that you both were making fun of A) her weight, B) the amount of food she brought onto the elevator, and C) the smell wafting from her presence.”

I like how she used the word “wafting”. For the record (ftr), these are copy and pasted excerpts from the emails I have been exchanging for the past hour. names obviously changed.

&gt; I explained my interaction with smf and my simply saying “no it doesn’t” to her comment “it smells better in here doesn’t it?”

&gt; I go through my entire exchange 3x over with my HR lady, as does obg. once over email and twice over the phone.

&gt; my story and obg’s story match up, obviously. smf’s story does not, however.

fast forward 20-30 minutes

&gt; the phone at my desk rings. I pick it up and it’s smf. she SCREAMS into my phone and asks me what I’ve been telling ‘my boss’ and why I’ve been lying to him.

&gt; I hang up because I was told not to talk to her. apparently she had been upset and was very angry with her people on the phone.

&gt; I called my HR person and told her that she called me, etc etc

&gt; just around noon, my boss comes into my office and asks me what is going on. I tell him, lay it out for him and he just laughs and says “shit happens. people are crazy” I agree and go get lunch… 

that’s it for pt2. I’m torn. I want it to keep going because this is making my day FLY by but I want it to end because I’m annoyed with smf… only time will tell! Thanks for tuning in.

1372776976.0	1hhzw6	Submitted to the approval of the Midnight society, I call this story “Tale of a Ghastly Fatass” pt3	idgygdi	848	164	158	"Just as a quick recap, read [pt1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1h8tjh/submitted_to_the_approval_of_the_midnight_society/) then [pt2]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1h8xwz/submitted_to_the_approval_of_the_midnight_society/) and finally, come back here to enjoy restitution and shame!

This happened last year, July 2012, and I decided to write about it now. She got wind of it and was reading pt1 and pt2 then confronted me. I shit you not; this is how it went down:

&gt; “IDGYGDI, how dare you write those things about me? That’s completely not true. I asked for those tarps.”

&gt; “No, GhasFa, you didn’t. You just took them and ruined everything in the car. You toasted my laptop. How the hell did I get it wrong?”

&gt; Something incoherent was mumbled under her breath and as she waddled off waving her hands in the air, she reminded me of [Zoidberg]( http://mooselicker.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/zoidberg.jpg)

&gt; “You know it’s true! That’s exactly how it happened!” I shout.

&gt; A few hours later, her mom calls me. “GhasFa has been crying for over two hours and she says it’s all your fault. What happened?” Keep in mind that her brother and I are good friends so I’ve been over to their place a million times.

&gt; “Here, GhasMom, check out reddit. There’s a subreddit of fatpeoplestories and you can read all about it. I’m surprised GhasBro hasn’t told you about it.”

&gt; She calls me back about 30 minutes later and is laughing on the phone. Apologizes for her daughters behaviour a year ago, offers to pay for the detailing, etc and anything else I lost in the storm. I refuse and say that I just wanted to clear up any hard feelings we might have had now that GhasFa hath exploded.

&gt; FF a day. I’m out of range up in the country on a friend’s property in Quebec. Deadzone; beautiful spot of country land where no reception can be had. It’s amazing what a wonder the world is without technology to distract us. We were working away when we all get hungry and head into town, a town with cell reception. 

&gt; My phone starts going nuts. Buzzing, chirping, alerting me that I am receiving message after message.

&gt; GhasFa has broken her silence and filled up my voicemail limit. (I have a 30 minute message limit before it won’t allow another message.) Along with voicemail, she spammed my texts too. I got about 50 from her over the span of a day.

&gt; The voicemails range from “IDGYGDI, we need to talk” to “Why aren’t you answering my messages” to “WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?” all with heavy breathing and panic in her voice. I put it on speakerphone and scare the table next to us and leave my friends in stitches from laughing so hard. I read some of the texts and they range from “You fucker, call me back now. My mother is pissed at you. Call me NOW” to “IDGYGDI, I’m worried about you. Please call me back” to something that resembled death metal.

&gt; I put the phone away and enjoyed my dinner. Just as I’m leaving, my mom calls me. Tells me that GhasFa has been calling every hour on the hour asking if I’m home yet. My mom got to the point of telling her off. I don’t even live with my mom anymore and haven’t for a few years now. FTW!

Sidenote: When she confronted me the other day, she said “I’ll be watching reddit for another one of your posts and if I see another one, you’ll be sorry” So with that said, HI GHASFA!

&gt; She went nuts. I forwarded a few of these messages to GhasBro and a couple to GhasMom and tell them both that I’m posting on reddit. They give me the green light so here we are.

&gt; When I got back to town yesterday afternoon, it didn’t stop. She knew that I was getting back around noon and she just kept it going. It was CANADA DAY yesterday so nothing fazed me.

&gt; I woke up this morning to another slew of messages. Her trying to berate me, using expletives, etc. GhasBro told me to ignore her so I did.

&gt; Rogers to the rescue, you can block a number from texting and calling you if you wish. I do wish I had known this ahead of time but my problem has been solved! And GhasFa, if you’re reading this; you brought it on yourself. You’re insane and I’m pretty sure you need help.

I think it was pretty unfair of me to give FPS such a great fourth chapter and then leave you all on a cliffhanger, begging to find out why your jimmies went back to getting rustled and what Daisy could do to make things worse.  Well, prepare yourselves, FPS.  You are about to find out.

Alicia and I finally turned 21 and it was time to celebrate.  Thankfully, this meant being able to escape Daisy and go into places that she couldn't for at least awhile until she was of age.  Her general lack of fucks to give in the house was wearing us down, especially after leaving the kitchen almost every day as if a bomb had gone off.  Still, Alex going alpha on her had scared her, at least for a bit.  It wasn't long before she acted like the entire thing hadn't happened.

Now that the three of us were all of age, though, the bars sounded much better than before.  We were in the living room, just one day removed from Alicia becoming 21 but we were all in the middle of some projects for our classes and opted to wait until the weekend.  Alex took a day off from the strip club to take us bar hopping since we had a few in our immediate area and would not need a DD.  It was early Saturday evening and we were about to get ready.  Daisy had decided not to go home that weekend, much to our surprise, and that would end up being a very bad thing.  Green text, activate!

&gt;be me, in the living room

&gt;can't wait to go out with my roomies tonight

&gt;Alex going through the plan of attack

&gt;Several great places to go to!

&gt;fuckyeah.jpg

&gt;floor starts to shake

&gt;xbox controller rattling on coffee table

&gt;maybe Daisy is just getting food

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;Getting louder and closer!

&gt;A wild hamplanet appears!

&gt;Blubbering has already started

&gt;""OH MY GOD WHY ARE YOU GUYS GOING OUT TO THE BARS!?!  I CAN'T GO TO THEM YET!""

&gt;that's the point...

&gt;too beta to say that, too excited for tonight

&gt;Alex shakes his head

&gt;""Daisy, the whole point of turning 21 is to go to those places that you couldn't get into yet.  You'll turn 21 at some point too.""

&gt;Sense:  Alex makes it!

&gt;MOAR BLUBBERING THOUGH!

&gt;""BUT I WANT TO COME OUT FOR A ROOMIE NIGHT!!!  IT'S NOT FAIR!!!""

&gt;footstomp.gif

&gt;[Thoughts going through my head](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/4228-upset.gif)

&gt;Did she literally just do a 12-year-old tantrum?

&gt;Alex sighs

&gt;""Daisy, you aren't coming with.  I don't care that you think it's unfair.  We've all been there.""

Daisy starts to cry like crazy at that point, bitching up and down about how we don't include her in plans anymore.  Considering her track record, Alex was being more than civil when explaining it to her.  He was still angry over the loss of his weekend grill food, especially since he never got an apology from her, but at least got the money.  This time, though, she was ramping up her blubbering to an entirely new level.

&gt;""DAMMIT I WANT TO GO!  I'LL JUST HAVE SOMEONE SNEAK ME IN!""

&gt;sigh.gif

&gt;Alicia gets a little alpha

&gt;""No you won't, Daisy.  We are going out because we finally can.  Go hang out with your club friends if you want to go out.""

Daisy had caught on with a group of people who had a club that were into board games like Dungeons and Dragons.  She was coming home later from classes, not that we minded.  Alicia figured it would be good for her since it was turning out she didn't have anything in common with the rest of us, though the idea of a valley girl trying to play those games was pretty amusing.

&gt;""BUT I WANT TO GO TO THE BAR!""

&gt;getting irritated

&gt;We are not babysitters

&gt;Ignore mode, activated!

Daisy eventually waddled off to her room when she realized she wasn't going to get her wish.  A little bit after that, we started to get ready.  Alicia and I got dressed up for the night, maybe even going a little slutty (Don't judge!  We have our moments!) than expected.  Of course, this got the attention of the beluga when we assembled for the night out.

&gt;back in living room

&gt;Alicia and I looking hot!

&gt;Alex joins us

&gt;""You girls ready?""

&gt;floor shakes again

&gt;god dammit...

Daisy comes around the corner in an entirely different mood, leaving the three of us confused.

&gt;""ALLEXXX YOU LOOK HOT!""

&gt;Alex gets his hand up before the charging even starts

&gt;""Thanks, Daisy.""

&gt;Nicer than I would have been

&gt;At least he didn't get trampled

&gt;""GUYS SINCE YOU ARE LIKE GOING OUT TONIGHT, CAN I INVITE OVER MY CLUB FRIENDS?""

&gt;shrug

&gt;Sounds safe enough

&gt;Alex nods to us

&gt;""Sure, it's your house too.  Just clean up after yourselves, please.""

&gt;Daisy looks happy, at least

&gt;No bellowing necessary

&gt;""OKAY!  NIGHT GUIZ!""

&gt;That seemed....painless

The three of us head out for the night while Daisy ran off to her room to do....whatever she needed to in order to get ready.  Our thoughts were not on her having her friends over.  We were going out to have a good time.  Alicia and I found that being newly 21 and dressed to kill netted us bar tabs of exactly zero dollars, while Alex basically made sure that we didn't go overboard and no crazies were trying to get with us.  All in all, we had a blast, but we ended up pretty drunk quickly, not even making it to Midnight and only to two bars after going out at around 9pm.  We ended up getting a bite to eat on the way back to the house, fully content with how the night went.  Alicia ended up with a couple of phones numbers, as did I.  Alex got hit on and got numbers as well, but it ended up being moot for him (He would end up dating a waitress at the strip club not long after this, more on that to come later).

When we got back to the house, the fun had ended and the nightmare began.

The living room looked like Fat Man AND Little Boy had exploded in it.  Pizza boxes, cups, trash, board games, it was just terrible.  However, there was no Daisy or said friends she mentioned to be found.  Worse yet, the front door was unlocked.  Alex and Alicia surveyed the damage and, thankfully, it was just trash everywhere in the living room and nothing of his was broken.  That was when we heard shit happening out back.  Whatever it was, it was loud.

&gt;dafuq is going on out back?

&gt;*CLANG*....*CLANG*....*CLANG*

&gt;is someone breaking something?

&gt;Sounds like metal hitting together

I head out back to find Daisy and an entire galactic system of hamplanets out back, six people total, having a sword fight with a couple of long metal poles.  Our backyard was fenced off on the sides and to the alley out back, but it wasn't so much as grass as it was a place to park cars, though there was only room for two to fit comfortably.  Mine and Alex's cars were back there, and these two idiots were swinging these long pipes at each other along side of Alex's car.  Daisy was sitting on the steps of the small patio we had out back, laughing at these two guys.

&gt;Pretty mad about the living room

&gt;Tap Daisy on shoulder

&gt;""OH HAI CASSIE!  I FIGURED YOU'D BE GONE LONGER GETTING DRUNK AND SLUTTY!""

&gt;Bitch, don't act alpha because you're in front of friends

&gt;Still kinda drunk, beside the point

&gt;""You need to clean up the living room.  It's a mess.""

&gt;Not really alpha...or beta...

&gt;Okay, maybe beta

&gt;Alex coming up behind me, pissed

&gt;Clanging still going on while the others watch

&gt;""OH MY GOD I WILL GET TO IT WHEN THEY LEAVE!  WE DON'T NEED TO DRINK TO HAVE A GOOD TIME, SEE???  THEY'RE HAVING A STAR WARS FIGHT!""

&gt;[My reaction to anti-drinking PSA from hamplanet](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/5907-barney-kill-me-now.gif)

&gt;Alex looking at idiots

&gt;""Tell them to get away from my car doing that, Daisy.""

&gt;Daisy too busy laughing at her statement to me to hear

&gt;*CLANG* *CLANG* *CRASH*

&gt;......

It was like terrible foreshadowing on Alex's part.  Luke Hamwalker decided to jump back from a side swipe from Darth Beluga instead of blocking it as they had been.  The result?  Darth Beluga's ""lightsaber"" smashes Alex's window.  Everyone freezes.  Alex hits nuclear level explosion.

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;[Alex's reaction](http://24.media.tumblr.com/771567b9ef0a0b5bf203eb5f6893dfbb/tumblr_mpjz7vUQDF1s14cmno1_500.gif)

&gt;Darth Beluga is going to die

Alex storms down the steps and immediately begins yelling at these two asshats.  The rest of the galaxy runs back into the house, knowing shit is about to get real.  Alex's tirade involved grabbing the guy who did the damage, pressing him against his car, and screaming at him.  The kid apologized profusely, realizing he was possibly about to get murdered.  Alex didn't swing, but he calmed down quite a bit when the guy said he would pay for the window (Well...fucking DUH!) over and over again.  SOMEHOW, out of all of this, Daisy uses fatlogic to start screaming at Alex.

&gt;""OMG ALEX DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE AND HURT MAH FRIEND!  HE CAN'T HANDLE THIS BECAUSE OF HIS CUNDISHUN!""

&gt;....

&gt;[ofw](http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/misc-are-you-fucking-kidding-me-l.png) Daisy says that

&gt;Alex might kill both of them

&gt;Turns back to the guy

&gt;Running down to stop him from committing murder

I managed to get him to let go of the guy, who smelled just as bad as any hamplanet.  Alex was calming down while the guy caught his breath, obviously holding it in fear.  He apologized for probably the 20th time before Alex gets his number and information so he can reimburse him.  And, just to get it out of the way now, he did pay Alex.  It wasn't cheap, but he had the money not long after the repairs. 

After that was settled, all of Daisy's friends bolted.  Alex obviously wasn't in the mood for anyone to be hanging out, especially after having such a good night out.  Daisy begged them to stay, even after all of the shit that occurred, but they weren't about to face Alex's wrath if anything else went wrong.  Daisy turned this around using FATLOGIC!

&gt;What a mess

&gt;Alex's car damaged...living room a mess

&gt;Bellowing can be heard

&gt;Not now...

&gt;""OMG YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING DICKS!  I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER!  YOU SAID I COULD!""

&gt;Alex not in the mood, goes back to kitchen

&gt;Looks absolutely exhausted from the entire thing

&gt;Be alpha, Cass.  Be alpha, Cass.

&gt;""Daisy, Alex's car was damaged because of your fucking friends!""

&gt;MOAR BELLOWING!

&gt;""OMG JUST BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS WITHOUT GETTING DRUNK DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE JEALOUS OF ME!""

&gt;....did that make any sense?

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/6092-wahwaah-.gif) that attempts to register.

&gt;Alex comes walking back in

&gt;Glass of whiskey in one hand

&gt;Trash bag in the other

&gt;Looks somewhat calm.

&gt;Alpha Alex, calm form

&gt;""Daisy, you are going to clean this mess up.  They are not coming back over.  Get this place straight.""

&gt;THE WALRUS IS NOT DONE!

&gt;""FUCK YOU GUYS I'M GOING WITH MY FRIENDS!""

&gt;omg stampede!

&gt;~~runs~~ waddles out of front door

Blubbering as she ran out the door, Alex didn't bother to even yell at her, obviously still trying to take in what happened.  Alicia was drunker than either of us thought and had actually passed out in one of the recliners in the living room, oblivious to what had been going on.  Alex sighed and shook his head, putting his glass down and just idly picking up the trash.  I helped him out, knowing that it would never get done if we didn't.  It didn't take us too terribly long to get it organized, but that wasn't the point, obviously.  When we were done cleaning, Alex and I sat on the couch and opted for a movie until passing out.

**TL;DR - HURRAY TURNING 21!!  Night goes so well....until Daisy's friends smash out a window in Alex's car.  Alex goes alpha again.  Daisy uses fatlogic and blubbers away from cleaning!**

**Blog posts, news pages, Tumblr, etc** 

*Screenshot, do not direct link.* This is a bit ironic because I just mentioned reading the sidebar, and this is in it, but it's still a common problem. Just don't link to places if you can help it.

**[Meta] posts**

There's been a sharp increase of them lately. Just make sure they're contributing to the conversations and not small nit-picky story suggestions. If you have suggestions for the writers… well, I will get to that in a moment.

**TP Thursday and F2F Friday** 

I mention this every time, but they exist - once again, please read the sidebar. We just want to keep you all on topic, if that's alright with you!

**Constructive criticism builds better stories** 

If you have something you don't like seeing in a story, give some civil feedback in the comments. It's pretty well-received usually and can do a lot for quality control.

**Past suggestions** 

Here's the top suggestions from the last two mod posts!

From /u/lilahking 
&gt; If i may suggest for new writers, please don't say something like ""this is my first time, be gentle, etc""
&gt; By asking not be to be judged harshly, you're kinda priming the reader to judge you anyways.

Expanding on this/supporting it is /u/SovreignTripod 
&gt; Something I'd like to see less of in posts- people prefacing their stories with a little paragraph about how this is their first post and greentext is hard so please be gentle. Just tell the story and don't worry about how hard the greentext is; it's literally just a &gt; before each line.

From /u/makesufeelbadinside 
&gt; Can we also ban meta posts complaining about how the stories seem exaggerated or fake?

Real popular one from /u/Zachel
&gt; My only real complaint, aside from new users who dosen't read the sidebar, is having letters represent people.

Expanding on this is /u/laskuraska 
&gt; […] a stylistic choice, could i ask that we name all our lovely characters something, even if it's a generic hamplanet analogue and similar labels for other characters so i've not got any more confusing stories to read about j,k,l, and m fighting with n because n eats too much? It's much easier to follow a story about Jaques, Katie, Laura, and Mike getting harassed by Nadine.

And lastly, an excellent point from /u/edichez 
&gt; A limit to the amount of gifs that can be in a story. Sure some are good to get the message across but sone stories have one every 2 lines.

*****
**Suggestion box time!**

Perfect, you've gotten this far! So now this is the time where I tell you to comment and give feedback, your own suggestions, comments, etc, whatever you like, so people can see what others' opinions are and vote on them and so we the mods can see what's up with our readers. I, for sure, will be reading through all of these and replying to what I can and I know the other mods will be popping in as well, so feel free to ask questions and give all the feedback you like.

1372638358.0	1he8ax	Maggie, My Ham Housemate: The Beginning	WakeUpMaggie_FPS	931	258	76	"This is the story of living with the fat-logic-laden Maggie and the chaos that ensued as she clashed with me and my alpha roommates.

I'm from the Northwest, and didn't really encounter a lot of Hamplanets there. When I moved to upstate NY to go to school, there were definitely more overweight people, but all reasonable and nice.I made the decision to stay in the town I went to school in after i graduated, to work and study for the exam I needed for grad school. I had three friends who were also staying in the area: John, my best friend since 4th grade who moved out to NY with me, Sasha, my freshman year roommate and her boyfriend of two years, Andrew. At the beginning of this story, we're all 21. Me and Sasha are about 5'4 and both weigh somewhere between 115- 125lbs. John is 6'4, and Andrew is 6'0, and they're both thin, muscular, and active.

Before we even graduated, we shopped around for a nice place to live and Sasha found a four bedroom house in an okay area of town. It was relatively cheaper because it required a good amount of walking (or a car) to get to the stores. We're all involved in sports, and pretty fit to this day, so this, if anything, was a bonus exercise opportunity. The only issue was we needed another roommate. So I wrote out a flyer. The only real requirements I put on there were 1. MUST be able to pay ""x"" amount of money for rent/utilities, and 2. no cigarette smokers (the lease prohibited it). 
	
I get a call from some chick named Maggie, not two days after I stuck up flyers. I don't know the person at all - weird. This was during senior week, so basically I didn't investigate to far into it, and just invited her for a coffee so we could talk. We said 10:30 am (her suggestion), and she walked into the student lounge around 12 pm. Obviously the girl had JUST woken up. She was about 5'10, and I would say around 300lbs. Dirty college sweatshirt, pajama bottoms, and hair dyed almost blue-black, tied up in what I assume was supposed to be a ponytail, but looked like wet spaghetti.  I waved her down, even though every fiber of my lacrosse playing body told me not too. She plopped down on the seat next to me, and apologized for being late; her alarm was broken. She seemed really tired and moody, so I assumed senior week was hitting her kind of hard. 
	
Our conversation was super normal: she told me she was a non-smoking, and in her words ""vegetarian clean freak"" and didn't mind the location. When I asked her if she had a steady job/ plans for regular income, she was a little vague, which did not fly with me *at all*. I basically pinned her down with my eyes and asked her how she was going to pay for the apartment, and she admitted ""Mommy's going to help me out with rent for a couple months"". I understood how that would be kind of embarrassing to admit to, but that was alright once she told me she had job plans for afterwards. She sounded well-read, generally polite, and I didn't really care how big she was, as long as she paid. The only other off thing about her was the fact that when I asked her if the distance from the town was a problem, she responded kind of aggressively that ""despite my looks, I can manage it"". She laughed it off as soon as I did a double take. 
	
We kept in contact by text, Maggie visited the house once, met Sasha and Andrew, and after graduation, we had about two days to move stuff in. Everyone but Maggie moved in on the first day, and settled bedrooms. Maggie was ""super busy"" and I called her to tell her that her room was smaller, but had its own bathroom. She said she was fine with it if we helped her bring her stuff over. On the last possible day she could stay at the dorms, she texted me that she was ready to move her stuff. Me and John hop in his truck, get down there, and find a not a single (filled) box. Yup, she hadn't packed anything. After I introduced John, I asked her what was up with the empty stacked boxes. 

""Oh I thought you guys could help me do that, I've been having a rough week.""

""…. Okay…"" We toss her stuff into boxes, and get them out to the car, while she deals with her clothes (and eats four english muffins slathered in peanut butter). She has so many books. Just, I mean, this girl has never thrown away a book in her life. It was actually kind of impressive. We have to make two trips to get her shit up to the house; she has even more clothes than books. John said ""at least we know Mommy has enough money to buy her shit tons of sweatshirts"". I counted about 25. When we finally get her into the car (on our third trip back), she sits in the front seat without a moments hesitation. I throw her last box of books into the hatch, and at this point, it's already 4pm, and I'm too exhausted to fight for stupid things like the front seat. John drops us off and unloads the boxes onto the street, then I run upstairs to change into work clothes. John drives me to work, and I turn off my phone and start pouring drinks. When I get off my shit, and turn it back on, there's a text from John telling me not to take the bus, he's gonna pick me up because we need to talk. 

I was really, really hoping this wasn't about Maggie, because she'd JUST moved in and I didn't want to deal with that. Too bad, because, *of course* it was. As soon as I got in the truck, John started listing Maggie's crimes. She had tried to get all three of them to move the boxes upstairs for her while she was on the phone with her mom. They brought up at least two boxes each before they realized she was sitting on the couch, eating Andrew's chips, telling her mom she was finished moving in. What. John slammed down a box right then and there and told her he wasn't moving another box until she did her share. Maggie went wide-eyed and hung up the phone. She looked incredibly offended, and stalked downstairs to grab a box. Andrew picked up his bag of chips to find crumbs. 

After they had helped her move fifteen boxes of stuff (of which she moved two) upstairs, they decided to order Chinese. Our house had a strict ""seperate check"" policy, you pay for ALL of your food. If you borrow money, you really have to pay it back as soon as possible. Maggie orders two large servings of beef dishes, extra white rice, and two egg rolls.

 Wait, wait, WakeUpMaggie, you said this girl was a vegetarian!?! After John raised this concern with her (""You know Beef with Broccoli has... beef in it?""), she said ""Oh, yeah. I'm not *really* vegetarian. That's just something I identify with. I cave so often though. I need the protein."" 

WAT. She's then short $20 on her side of the bill. Everyone else had gotten one dish, and maybe an egg roll. She preceeded to beg them to help her out, and John threw her the cash after making her promise to return it the next day. John payed for my food with money I had given him before, but Maggie didn't know that. After they ate, and she left her empty dishes out on the table (I guess ""clean freak"" is also something she just identifies with), she went up to Johns room, and asked if she could talk to him. He thought she was having issues with the house or something, so he said sure.

She then sat on his bed and lectured him like a five year old. About how he treated her like a common criminal just because she was 20 short (after we explained the food policy). Then she starts accusing him of buying ME food just because he wanted to sleep with me, and about how he shouldn't treat ""bigger"" girls lesser than ""skinny"" girls, just because he was a ""jock looking to hook up with everything in sight"". John then sat in shock as she asked him to apologize. He asked her to please bite him and leave the room immediately. He was so angry that while he was telling me this he nearly punched a hole in the steering wheel. We got home and found Maggie eating a giant bar of chocolate in the kitchen. She looked at us and asked how our ""date"" was. She teehee'd and snort giggled ""just kidding"". My chinese food was gone. I asked her if she'd seen it. Maybe somewhere around the vicinity of her mouth. She looked at me as if I had suggested she blended a baby into a smoothie. John tells me he'll treat me to tacos at the local dive instead. As we leave she yells ""get me a couple, please! I'll pay you back in the morning"". Yeah okay. 

This was just the first day. 

Sorry, this is so long! I'll continue soon!

1370746560.0	1fyn16	BUFFET IS CLOSED	Orykath	809	131	97	"I was telling my mom about the wonders of reddit when this sub came up. I read her a couple of the stories and told her of some of my favourite ones that I came across, including the one that inspired this story (which I would link to but I cannot for the life of me find it), about a guy who was starting to lose weight and then goes in for a $5 buffet only to be continually foiled by a Hamplanet couple. 

My mom goes on to say how most of these stories are probably made up for points, but she believes the buffet one because of something that happened to her and my dad before I was born (~25 years ago). 

My mom and dad were extremely fit and healthy people in their youth, but would occasionally go to an $8 Chinese Food buffet because my dad really liked the dry ribs and my mom really liked the wontons.

One day they went to the Chinese food buffet later in the evening so there was only one other family there. The other family was a group of four, Big Dad, Big Mom, Teenage Daughter, and Teenage Son, all of whom were exceptionally obese. No weight estimates, but my mom said the four people took up a booth that was made for 8. 

As my parents were sitting down, the Big family was making their way back to their own table. BD and BM had their plates heaped to the sky, TD had a only a moderately heaping plate, and TS had only a small heaping plate, because that's all that was left, according to my dad. 

My parents went up to the buffet and saw that there were no ribs left and notified the staff (a Chinese lady), and told her that they normally came to the restaurant for the ribs. The Chinese lady stared at the buffet table in shock for a moment then shot the Hamfamily the dirtiest look my mom has ever seen, apparently, and retreated into the kitchen for more ribs.

My parents made the mistake of going back to their table. The fat family continued to make frequent trips up to the buffet counter, ensuring that there was absolutely no food for anyone else.

The Chinese lady brought out some more ribs and no sooner had the ribs hit the table, than BD was racing over to the buffet as fast as he could go. My dad reached the buffet shortly after. 

[HFW](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18j2bwor6ki2ggif/ku-medium.gif) BD had taken ALL of the ribs. 

My dad went up to the Chinese lady to tell her that, again, he didn't get any of the ribs. She was unimpressed. 

She walked right up to the fat family and started yelling with in a thick Chinese accent, ""YOU FOUR CANNOT GO UP NO MORE I AM BRINGING OUT RIBS FOR THIS MAN AND YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY OF THEM YOU EAT TOO MUCH YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY OF THEM BECAUSE YOU EAT TOO MUCH I MAKE NO MONEY TODAY YOU TOO FAT YOU GO HOME NOW"".

The Chinese lady then apologized to my dad and delivered some ribs directly to my parents' table. She wasn't taking any chances. As soon as my parents finished eating and paid, the Chinese lady shut down the buffet and turned the lights off. 

[My parents' faces when](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3mw9eDcac1r6p48c.gif) the fat family was still eating. 

BM said, ""I thought the buffet was open until 9!"". The Chinese lady responded with, ""BUFFET IS CLOSED NO MORE FOOD"". 

TL;DR My parents go to a Chinese buffet. A Fat family eats up all the food. The Chinese lady working there tells the family what's up. "	t5_2vzax	True

Here it is, my darling gorgers. The fat that broke the whale's back.

&gt; Second day back at work, doin' great cuz I'm me

&gt; RW shows up to take over so I can go home

&gt; As she's preparing to start her day, she starts talking to me about her most recent lady-doctor visit (gynecologist, bros)

&gt; This is the saddest whale song I have ever heard from this woman

&gt; RW ""My doctor said that because of my weight I'm borderline diabetic.""

(YES. AGAIN.)

&gt; RW ""She put me on a diet aid and told me that because of all the medical issues I've had that I'll never have children. She's not even sure my uterus is functioning anymore. I haven't had a period since I was 20 years old.""

&gt; dat personal information that I do not neeeed, oh wait here's some more

&gt; RW ""I've had abnormal pap smears ever since I started going to the gyno, I've been on hormones since I was 30. She says it's all a product of my weight. I got mad at her at first, but then I realized that maybe she was right... Viza what do you do to stay so slim?""

&gt; I lost all function and thought at this point

&gt; Was this horrendous fat-loving woman actually asking me for *advice?*

&gt; There's no fucking way. What world would we be living in if that were a thing.

&gt; Clearly not the same ocean as RW!

&gt; But there it was, my friends, RW asking how to lose weight and stay slim

&gt; I gave her very basic, very simple advice to start out with

&gt; Take a walk in the morning or night, start out easy then gradually increase the distance, the speed, etc

&gt; Stop eating take out, learning portion control, etc etc

&gt; She nodded along and WROTE DOWN WHAT I WAS SAYING

&gt; RW ""I've never really worried about my weight since I'm so tall, because I carry it really well (lol)... but I've just been so tired and with all the hormones they have me on... and now these diet pills and a diuretic on top of that. I'm just realizing that I can't stay this size and be happy.""

&gt; It was like light was shining down from heaven

&gt; The angels were singing

&gt; This whale had finally seen the light!

In a way, I'm really, really happy for her, but in a more selfish way, I don't know how many more stories I will get if she actually betters herself.

I suppose I can keep you updated on her progress, but that will probably not be as amusing (though it may be inspiring!)

So whenever the police are called, there are generally two reports of the call: Code Ones and Code Twos. Code Ones are just 911 calls where the police are called out and the officer personally decides a report doesn't need to be made, and it's left at that. Code Twos, AKA Case Reports, are when enough shit has gone down to require the need for a documented report of the incident, like vehicle theft, assault, etc.

One fine morning a LardTard wobbled into the lobby. It was a Thursday, AKA VIN Check days, when people come in to get the VIN checks for their salvaged cars. This just means it's a super fucking busy time for us because a lot of people come in at a small amount of time. By the time LardTard has heaved himself at the counter, a line of people had already formed behind him like a clogged artery. I can tell by the look in his opposite-facing eyes that this is not going to be an easy time for me. I subtly make sure the bullet-proof glass barrier is locked.

""I need uh copy of a police report,"" the LardTard chokes out, and I nearly choke to because his voice sounds [remarkably similar to a Patton Oswalt joke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgAQApJdUOE).

Okay, no big deal, people generally mean they want a car accident report. I ask him if this is what he meant, and he shakes his chins vehemently, insisting he needs a poLEESE rePORT. Still, no big deal. I ask him if he has a case report number for it, and he shakes his chins again. He's getting even more agitated than when he was when he came in, and the line is increasing behind him.

All right, here's when I need to employ some detective skills to figure out what the fuck this guy wants, because people never know what the fuck they *actually* want. I ask him what kind of an incident it was, and he stares at me blankly. At least I think he was staring at me. Dat lazy eye.

I ask him for the date, time and location of whatever it is he's trying to get information on, and he gives me the address of a local McDonald's I'm very familiar with. Nothing comes up in the Incident Reports which means there is no Code Two. I have to look his shit up in the Code Ones then to see if there even is a case report number for whatever went down. At this point he is leaning his full weight on the counter, glaring in at me and trying to look at my computer screen. The uncomfortable seconds tick by and the people behind him are trying to see past him to figure out what the hold-up is. My co-workers are too preoccupied with checking Facebook to help me out.

I find a Code One for the info he gave me- a Cit Ass (lol), a Citizen Assist. I ask him if this sounds correct and he heaves in a deep breath, ready for story time, and like so many of these people do, decide to give me their life stories when all I need is a simple answer from them.

Sir LardTard was dining at aforementioned McDonald's on the infamous date he provided. Like I said, I'm familiar with this McDonald's and I know it has mildly janky bathrooms in that it has one handicap stall and two normal stalls, but the normal stall closest to the wall is smaller than the other one. Supposedly LardTard had chosen to use the bathroom in a normal stall instead of a handicap stall and found himself stuck when he tried to wiggle in. He finally freed himself independently and without help. He was the one who called 911 and made a huge stink to the employees and the responding officers about unsafe restaurant conditions for someone of his size. He demanded a report be made of the incident but he declined medical attention.

When he finished wheezing through his story I read the Code One. It only had two brief sentences about LardTard getting stuck and refusing medical attention. I apologize to LardTard that no case report was actually made about the incident despite his demands and I can't legally give out copies of Code Ones without approval from the legal department. I offer for him to fill out a public records access request but he'd rather yell at me instead. He starts to dive into his story again but I go alpha and cut him off telling him there's nothing else I can do for him. 

He mumbles something about suing the city and waddles off into the sunset. "	t5_2vzax	True

FPS, I hope you're ready for your jimmies to make a return.  I'm glad that everyone has taken such a liking to my story/tale/nightmare and I'm happy to provide you with entertainment/beetus-feeding in return.  Looking through the comments, it seems that everyone is waiting for Alex's patience to run out and prove that he is, indeed, human.  Let me tell you a bit more about Alex before getting into this chapter.

As I've said before, Alex's schedule was nothing short of hell.  He was one of the most chill people I've ever encountered and managed to finish school on time with honors, but he did not get to have much of a social life.  The times that he did, he usually spent it with Alicia and I watching TV, gaming, having a couple of drinks, or with a few of his friends from his previous years of school.  Every couple of months, he would decide he just needed a break from everything and tell both of his jobs that he needed to catch up on school for a few days.  Both employers were cool enough to let this happen, and he would regain his bearings.  For the first few weeks, I thought nothing would get under his skin to the point where he would erupt.  He took it in stride, even the restaurant incident, and just shrugged it off.

Today I give you the first showing that Alex is truly human...and very VERY Alpha when he needed to be.  The incident takes place a couple of weeks into the Fall Semester.  I will apologize for lack of green text in this, but there will be a little bit later on.

I mentioned in our second chapter that Alex had bought a freezer for the basement.  You know the ones I'm talking about:  flip up top, used for long storage of meats and such.  He basically wanted it for his steaks and ribs (This man's ribs were out of this world) but said that it could be used for other things if our tiny freezer upstairs got full.  This was a regular basis as Daisy had pretty much claimed it for herself and, even then, still would waddle her ballooned ass downstairs to the freezer to use some space there.

Our school had a decent football team and Alex loved cooking stuff up for games, even though he never went to them due to the work schedule.  So, the day before he would cook these awesome meals, he would transfer his frozen meat to the fridge so it could thaw and was ready the next day.  The first time he did this, Daisy didn't seem to understand the concept since she only cooked frozen, microwavable foods.  He actually had to explain to her that you can't just throw frozen ribs onto a grill and cook them.  It had to be thawed out properly and that there were a couple different ways to do it, but this was the best way since it only took a day and still kept the meat properly stored.

Daisy usually went home for the weekends immediately after class was over on Friday, which was paradise for the rest of us.  We weren't two months into living together and some things had really started to bother us.  It was the standard hamplanet situations:  Not cleaning up after destroying food, not bathing herself, an odor coming from her room which really was a drag on Alex since his room was across from hers.

Alpha Alex emerged when Daisy's grocery shopping got completely out of control.  Daisy would make two trips a week to the grocery store and basically clean out the frozen foods section.  I'm sure the stockers in that store quaked with fear when they saw/heard/felt her coming into the store.  Much bellowing would occur when the freezer would already be semi-full of her stuff and have a couple of things from the rest of us, so she would head downstairs, much to her chagrin, and store the rest down there, which she had a tendency to forget about and would just go shopping more instead of making the trip down the stairs to transfer food to feed her beetus upstairs.  Oh, and obviously, Alex's ribs and steaks were down there.  

You can see where this is going, FPS.

Friday rolls around in this week, middle of the day.  Alex does not have class on Fridays but still works at the strip club until 5am on Thursday night/Friday morning, so he usually gets up around Noon after getting home...

&gt;be me, sitting in the living room

&gt;playing Zelda:LTTP on Wii Classic Console.  Fuck yeah, Zelda

&gt;Fuck you, Agahnim.

&gt;Alex stumbles into living room

&gt;Looks dead to the world

&gt;""Zelda, huh?""

&gt;I nod, smiling at my love for killing shit with the Master Sword

&gt;""Yeah, no class for me today.""

&gt;Alex doesn't sit down, but is amused

&gt;""be prepared for karting in a bit.""

&gt;I laugh

&gt;""Bring it!""

&gt;Alex leaves, hear him go downstairs

&gt;Damn you, Agahnim!  I hit that shit!

&gt;""CASSIE!!!!""

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;*pause that shit*

&gt;""ALEX?""

&gt;Something's not right.

I get up and head downstairs into the basement, making my way to where Alex was now standing in front of the freezer....and a small pile of thawed meat that was now well on its way to being rotten.

&gt;Oh fuck

&gt;That's a lot of meat

&gt;Look in freezer

&gt;Stockpiled with frozen dinners.

&gt;Alex looks really pissed

&gt;calms down a bit

&gt;""I'm going to guess these aren't yours or Alicia's, right?""

&gt;I shake my head.

&gt;Can't even that frozen shit

&gt;""Only one person here that eats frozen dinners all the time.""

&gt;Alex nods, standing over the remains of his saved food

I did him the favor of at least getting the garbage bag so he could clean it up.  He didn't say anything beyond that, but I could tell he was frustrated beyond the level he was at when dealing with the restaurant.  I wasn't sure how he was going to handle this, but Daisy was about to get reamed.

Sure enough, about thirty minutes later, Daisy comes back from her classes that day and seemed to be pretty eager to get her stuff to leave for home, but Alex wasn't about to let her get to her bedroom before he had his moment.

&gt;""Daisy!  Hold up!""

&gt;stomping getting closer

&gt;Daisy comes into view, looks giddy that Alex called for her

&gt;""Yesssss Alllleeexxx?  Do you want to come home with me for the 
weekend?""

&gt;gag.gif

&gt;Alex shakes his head

&gt;""Did you stock the freezer downstairs with your food?""

&gt;Daisy seems confused.

&gt;""Well, yeah, like I didn't have any room up here and I didn't want them to go bad!""

&gt;fucking valley girl...

&gt;Hooo boy...

&gt;Alpha Alex is coming out to play!

&gt;""Not spoil?  Then why in the fuck did you just leave my meat out to do just that!?!""

&gt;Wow.

&gt;Didn't realize he was capable of yelling

&gt;popcorn.gif

&gt;""WELL YOU SAID THAT YOU NEEDED TO THAW YOUR FOOD OUT SO I FIGURED I WAS HELPING!  TEEHEE""

&gt;Can see Alex's fist clenching

&gt;Not stopping him this time

&gt;He has every right to be pissed

&gt;""....when did you take them out!?!""

&gt;Daisy doesn't seem to understand that he might kill her

&gt;""Oh, like, Tuesday!  That was when I went shopping last!""

&gt;holy shit

&gt;Three days, that stuff had been sitting out

&gt;""DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE JUST WASTED CLOSE TO $100 OF MY FOOD!?!  YOU CAN'T LEAVE THAT SHIT OUT FOR THREE DAYS!""

&gt;Not quite nuclear...but Alpha as fuck!

&gt;Daisy is quivering

&gt;Blubbering about to commence

&gt;""I SWEAR I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING I JUST HAVE TO HAVE ALL THIS FOOD READY BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP IT BECAUSE OF MY CUNDISHUN!""

&gt;I have to step in.

&gt;fuckingridiculous.mp3

&gt;""What fucking condition is that, Daisy?  You keep saying that!  What condition made you think leaving food out for over three days was a good idea?""

&gt;Alex doesn't budge

&gt;Waiting for answer

&gt;Tears coming down Daisy's face

&gt;""YOU GUYS JUST CAN'T APPRECIATE THAT I WAS TRYING TO HELP AND DO YOU A FAVOR BUT YOU JUST WANT TO BE ASSHOLES!""

&gt;sidestep.gif

&gt;wtf.org

&gt;Alex approaching nuclear levels

&gt;""I will make this perfectly clear to you:  You will pay me back for the food that has spoiled.  You will also get me the money you still owe me from fronting the cash for our first month so we could move in early.  You will also never move my things in the fridge or freezer again.  GET IT?""

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;She still hasn't paid him?

&gt;DAFUQ?

At this point, Daisy was a blubbering mess.  She didn't say anything further except incoherent moans and cries and just ran off to her room and slammed the door.  I had to ask about the money at that point.

&gt;""She still hasn't paid you for that?""

&gt;Alex shook his head

&gt;Calming down

&gt;""I asked her about it the day after we moved in.  She said she needed some time for it and I said no problem.  Gave her the benefit of the doubt.""

&gt;Obviously she didn't care.

&gt;Learning that Daisy only cares about herself.

&gt;Shocking.

I was definitely glad to see that Alex had a breaking point, and I told him that later on which got a laugh out of him.  He and I ended up going back to the store to get ribs for Saturday and he was back to his usual self.

Daisy made her exit pretty quickly after Alpha Alex showed up, and she didn't come back until Monday afternoon, missing all of her classes that day in the process.  To her credit, she had enough money to pay him back and cover what he had fronted.  We didn't see her come out of her room except for classes and food for the next couple of weeks, so the house was pretty quiet.  This, however, was the calm before a huge shitstorm.

1370278301.0	1fl92f	"Being fat is ""extra"" disability"	ItsMuhBeetus	809	145	255	"One morning after a heavy night on the drink, I decided to go for a walk to the local McBeetus because I was craving unhealthy and greasy food and I feel better after eating such food on hangover day.

It's not far, about a 15 min leisurely pace walk, although in hungover mode it feels twice as long but I don't care, the reward is McBeetus for ""muh cuurves"" and to appease the hangover demon.

I get my order and sit outside on the seat in the sun and slowly munch on my food just in case the hangover demon decides to reject its offering.

A mini-van pulls up into the handicap spot and the occupant sits there for some amount of time, I figure waiting for someone and I think not much more of it.

A short amount of time passes and some family sedan rolls in, looking really lowered and I guess it's just one of those guys that love to lower cars to stupid heights for stance and that nonsense

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif) the car is *leaning* to one side more and a near morbidly obese woman steps out of the passenger side.

The car itself was lowered moderately but the extra weight of this landwhale pushed it down even more. Height was probably no more than 5'6"" and at least 200kg/440lb

The car is parked next to the disabled spot, this disabled spot is close to the exit of the car park and the car park itself near the entrance from the road isn't that big, about 8-10 spots before the parking opens up as it's infront of the store. A few spots down would get you closer to the entrance but whatever, logic need not apply to whoever designed the carpark.

Landwhale knocks on the window of the car in disabled parking and the window rolls down.

""UH SCUSE ME, THIS IS FOR DISABLED PEOPLES ONLY"" she yells.

There's a moment of silence and then the occupant shows her the disabled windshield hanger, his hand out the window.

""AH DUN SEE NO DISABLED PEOPLE HURR"" again yelling, even though she's next to the person.

""This hanger isn't for show lady and a matter of fact I am disabled"" the man (after speaking is evident) in the car replies, obviously knowing more about his disability than she does and something that she isn't seeing

""WELL WHATEVER IT IS, YOU MUST BE FAKING IT. YOU GOTS DUMB DOCTORS!"" again yelling.

The door of disabled guy opens and he turns his body to the open door, revealing the fact that he has no legs (I assume he has a wheelchair in the car) and he has a smug look on his face.

&gt;Landwhale goes into Beetusragemode.exe

I just see her arms flailing about and just jiggle flying about and something about ""FAT IS EXTRA DISABILITY, IT'S HARD FOR US TO GO PLACES"" but mostly unintelligible speech caught in the fat of her face, lips moving slower than she can talk so words become melded together.

She waddlestorms her way to the door of McBeetus entrance and I watch through the window. She orders a big mac meal and takes it to the car. I think to myself ""Is that all?""

No it wasn't. It was for the driver. She goes back in, seems to order at least 5 different burgers all in large meals and I can just see the drink fountain girl doing the drinks.

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nicolas-Cage-Laugh.gif) they're all diet coke.

She's somewhat calmed down, although seems to be ranting about her order taking so long or something, as its just jiggly body parts waving about the place.

Landwhale gets two employees to take out her order as she cannot carry them all at once. All that walking to and from the car must be sapping her of her curves *teehee*

They hand them through the driver's side window while Landwhale waddles slowly back to the car. 

Disabled guy says something along the lines of ""It must be hard with your disability, having to eat so much""

""AH HAVE BEETUS AND MAH THYROID FLARES UP SO I GOTTA EAT OR I DIE! AND AH DUN NEED NO DOCTUH TO TELL THAT. IT'S GENETIC!"" landwhale yells at him through his window.

All I hear is just disabled guy laughing his ass off from his car and landwhale having beetusragemode engage once again, this time no actual words form, it's just ""WARBLABEETIGJHSTHYROAAOAGOAGG""  for the most part. She squeezes herself back into the car and it putters off, trying to not fall apart while towing 3/4 of capacity in one seat.

The hangover demon appeased, i finish my meal and laugh on the walk back home at the events that unfolded."	t5_2vzax	True
1368488343.0	1ea1rs	Sorbitol rains vengeance upon Mt. Roommate	RaceHorseGurl	783	111	86	"Thought I would share my funniest FPS.

Background: I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago, and after that I decided to cut all processed sugar out of my diet in order to avoid eventual 'beetus. I lost about 20 pounds, blood sugar looks fantastic, I look fantastic, errbody be mirin'. 

I got assigned a random roommate at my university. Let's call her Mt. Roommate, because that's what I call her and that's what she looked like. Maybe 5'5"", 200+ lbs. Never found out for sure, since she threw out my bathroom scale the day she moved in.

She honestly wasn't horrible to live with. She made me drive her around a lot, since she didn't have a car, but mostly we ignored each other and got along OK. I never bought or ate sugary food or junk food, and since that is all she ever ate, there were no food stealing issues. She did like to complain about my eating habits and how I must be anorexic, but I never listened much. She didn't shower, and I never saw her change her sheets once. By the end of the semester there was a blob-shaped grease stain on her sheets. Ew.

It was finals week. My mom sent me a care package with some of my favorite sugar-free cookies; delicious but expensive, so I never bought any for myself. Glee! I was rushing out the door to a review session when I got the package, so I made a huge mistake and left the cookies on the counter.

Well, apparently Mt. Roommate saw those cookies and thought that I had finally found Sugar Jesus. If you aren't familiar with sugar-free cookies, then let me tell you that they are made with a sweetener called sorbitol. If you eat a lot of sorbitol, especially if your body is not used to it, it can cause significant gastro-intestinal upset. That is a nice way to say that if you OD on sorbitol, liquid will be erupting from your various orifices in a most unpleasant manner.

I got home. Mt. Roommate was nowhere to be seen. Neither were the cookies. I heard a low moaning coming from the bathroom. ""Mt Roommate?"" I called apprehensively. A pitiable moan was the only answer. As I approached I started to smell it. Oh sweet Sugar Jesus. I opened the bathroom door.

She was curled up in a puddle of shit and vomit next to the empty cookie package. Mt. Roommate had become Mt. Vesuvius, with lava just as deadly but considerably smellier. 

I lost it. I laughed so hard. Maybe that makes me a bad person. I don't  care. I shut the bathroom door again and went to sleep in the library.

I bet she never stole cookies again."	t5_2vzax	True

1372653130.0	1heonc	Maggie, My Ham Housemate: The Routine	WakeUpMaggie_FPS	931	270	127	"In which you learn about [Maggie's](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1he8ax/maggie_my_ham_housemate_the_beginning/) day-to-day life as the Queen of Sheba. 

Everyone in the house worked part or full time jobs. Everyone but Maggie. And on top of our work, 4/5 of us were studying for grad school exams (guess who wasn't). Sasha had a clerical job at a dinky office nearby, 9 to 5, and would then lock herself in her room for two hours or so and prep for her exam. Andrew worked part time at a grocery store, and then had a shitty internship at doctor's office, so he studied whenever he had a moment.   Me and John were studying for the same exam. Because I worked most afternoons/nights bartending, and John worked security almost every night till about 2, we would study from midmorning till whenever we finished. 

It's kind of obvious we had a pretty rigid schedule. If you interrupted Sasha for anything less then an anthrax outbreak during ""locked door, book open time"", you would be shived. Same went for me and John. Our test was in October, and as soon as June hit, we went full out. We knew if we could get good scores the first time, we could live the rest of our year as care-free, underemployed young people with years of crushing grad school ahead. 

Maggie would wake up somewhere between 2 and 3 pm. She'd move from her bedroom into the kitchen, microwave some atrocity, and roll into the living room and almost immediately park her ass on the couch. Every. Day. You'd know when she'd gotten up because her bed would croak like a man being beaten with a crowbar under the brooklyn bridge. She'd bought the worst spring mattress, and it added to the noise.Then you'd hear the moan of  a couple floor boards, a door slam, then the shower running. Not long after came the violent belting out of several Beatles songs I can't bear to listen to anymore. She absolutely, positively, LOVED the beatles. I'm talking giant posters and general distain for all other music. Now i'm a fan of them, they're great. But I also like other music, god damn it. If I played anything different, I'd get a passive aggressive email (EMAIL) from the other room asking me to wear headphones. If she heard the Beatles, that was an immediate invitation to your room to her. (She also fucked up our Rock Band 2 sessions something awful. She would insist on playing with us, DEMAND to be on vocals, but then quit halfway through a song. Who fucking DOES that?). Sorry, sidetracked. 

All she did was watch television, bitch and moan about the heat, and tumblr the day away on the sofa. She made her mommy buy an air conditioner for the living room that we couldn't afford the electrical payments on. Her mom gave her money for that too. It was great, i guess, but I mean we couldn't use the living room anyway because Maggie was ALWAYS there. Three weeks in, we realized we needed to reclaim it. We didn't spend a lot of time watching tv, so we pushed her favorite couch, dubbed the ""recliner of sweat stain"" into the corner , moved the tv all the way down, then positioned the beat up love seat and big chairs around the coffee table. We could still hear her watching Tru Blood, but… whatever.

There were two things she got up for. Food, obviously,was the first. She would eat constantly. I'll explain our food situation in the next story, it's a long deal. She would just eat left overs from horrible take out food and SO MUCH CAKE. She would buy it or make it herself, whatever she had to do. Her mom put so much money into her account. I went to the ATM for her once (lol, once. a million times), she would give me $20 to do it(I honestly don't think she left the house more then 3 times a week, on DIRE necessities), and there was well over 2,000 dollars in that account for FOOD. JUST FOOD. As a broke bitch, I nearly fainted. Despite that shit, she would routinely eat our leftovers, snacks, drinks, whatever wasn't green, or healthy for you in the least.

Her second hobby was harassing us. She was first and foremost obsessed with John and I's friendship. We'd been friends since I hit the guy who was trying to steal his pokemon cards, over the head with my lunchbox in the fourth grade. We were tight. We also might be the same person, in two different bodies. It took her a while to figure out we weren't actually dating then. And when that happened… that's also another story for a different time. But in the beginning, she'd like to drop by John's room while we were both trying to study and ask us asinine questions. Maggie was, would always be, HAD to be the smartest. This extended to looking over our shoulders at practice tests, and trying to ""help us"". She would ""help us"" until John or I would stare at her in fury until she left

Maggie was also fascinated and mock disgusted by mine and Sasha's habit of maintaining basic hygiene. She called us ""barbies"" and other things that were clearly defensive answers to the fact she only ever wore sweatshirts, big shirts, and pajama pants. Obviously self conscious. Sasha and I invited her shopping, to workouts, to shows, but the only invitations she would accept would be the ones with food and no shoe requirements. John and Andrew had guy friends over all the time, and she behaved so rudely to them, like she just knew in their heads they were fat shaming. She was, and I bet in my bones, a TiTP subscriber, as well as a feminist when it came to brushing her hair. She didn't need to look good for some ""scummy jock dude"". I don't think she'd actually ever had a functional, reciprocated relationship. When she did ""go for it"", ugh….I'll tell you more stories about that later. We would of felt bad if she hadn't acted like she owned the place.

There was one awful fight when Sasha and I were going to bachelorette party, and the theme was something stupid and slutty (as you do). We got all sleazed up presented to a living room of friends, and one large sweat lump in the corner. We looked about as good as two athletic 21 year old chicks look, and everyone was wolf whistling and acting a fool. This was about a month after we'd moved in, and I'd been seeing a guy, on and off (mostly off), who made some silly joke about ""cleaning up good"" and grabbed my ass. We heard a snort from the greasy side of the room followed by silence as we stared. Maggie looked up and says ""Well, when looking like a doll is all you do all day, you better be good at it"". Fucking WHAT? John asked her how her Ph D in Big Bang Theory reruns was going and she shut up. 

That was always her sore spot. She was Ms. Lit Major, and she knew fucking EVERYTHING about books. I'm pretty sure she thought owning them was about as good as reading them. Every other field of study was ""soul-less"". But when we tried to put her on the spot, she got ugly. More ugly than usual. I got into a discussion about F. Scott Fitzgerald with her, which ended in her screaming i knew nothing about literature because I asked her what other book she liked by her ""favorite author"", besides fucking The Great Gatsby. Classic. 

She was always in bed by 3 or 4 am, then blasting various audiobooks until one of us banged on her door so loud she woke up, and turned it off. Did she think  those work in her sleep? Who knows, it's a mystery.

1369646193.0	1f4of0	Fatman vs Superman: Or Why You Should Never Work At Amusement Parks.	Drunken_Black_Belt	772	110	85	"Ok, so just discovered this subreddit the other day. Slowly falling in love with it.  I figured I'd contribue a story I have.  This is a story about love and loss. About Cheeseburgers and tears.  A tale of stupid youth wasted working in a minimum wage hell. This is the story of Fatman vs Superman.

So at the time I'm 21. In college, and working during the summer. I had just quit my job working for an electronics retailer, and acquired a summer job working for a chain amusement park.  I get to work security at an amusement park for a summer. Plenty of sun and easy walking. How much can go wrong at an amusement park?  Right?

I still hate myself for ever being so dumb and naive.

So this park had a roller coaster.  It was insanely popular. It was a Superman coaster, and was voted world's best coaster like 5 years in a row.  So naturally it was the selling point of the park.  It was also the most hellish part of the park.  Now a little break down of how security worked in the park ( we will get to E-Honda challenging me to a fight in a bit I promise).

So if you were under  18, or a really shitty guard, you worked the entrance gates. If you were a senior guard, or a favorite of the staff, you got patrols.  This meant you got to walk around all day, and essentially do nothing unless something big went down.  The middle guards, which I ended up being, got ride duties.  All the major rides had a guard assigned to them for their shift. You patrolled that ride's line, and that line only.  So you were the one who dealt with every single problem at these rides.  

So, this particular day I was doing a double shift.  All day stuck at Superman.  Fuck me.  Add to that it's pushing 100 degrees, and it's a Saturday, so our busiest day.  The wait time for Superman is well over 3 hours.  So I'm spending my day telling people they can't leave the line to go pee then go back to their spot. Arguing with parents who think I'm an asshole for not accepting a bribe, in front of everyone else, to get to the front of the line.  Dealing with numerous bee stings because why not put bushes all along this giant line.  Not like Bees like nature or anything.

And that's when the fateful call came in.  10-35 at Superman.  Officer Drunken_Black_Belt please respond to the ride platform.  10-35 is the code for unruly person.  When I ascended up to the ride platfrom, I can see a gentleman yelling at the staff.   I quickly ascertain that perhaps 1035 could also be this gentelman's weight.  Khaki shorts screaming at the seams.  A sweat soaked black t shirt, featuring 4 st bernard dogs dressed as the South Park kids.  A face so red and flustered, it's hard to tell if it's sun burn or from the yelling.  

If you asked this gentleman to do the truffle shuffle on the platform, the vibrations would be enough to bring the ride crumbling to the ground I fear.  

So this gentleman is standing in the front most car of the ride train, yelling at the visibly frightened 16 year olds controlling the ride.  I can see him attemp to squeeze into the seat, and it's apparent it's not happening.  Even Ms Cleo could see where this was going.

So I approach and ask what the problem is, before the girl operating the ride can speak, Hamplanet is in my face, screaming about how they won't let him ride the ride.  How we are discriminating against him. How he's going to sue.  

Now for the record at the time I was 6'4 and 190.  I had just lost over 80 lbs since the previous summer. I have had weight issues all my life, and can be very sympathetic to embarrassing situations in public when it comes to weight.  So I try to play the nice guy card.

DBB: Sir, I understand your frustration.  And believe me we aren't trying to embarass you.  But it's a safety issue.  You have to be able to fit in the seat with the lap bar down and seatbelt on.

HP: No! I can go with just the seatbelt it's fine. Im studying engineering.

DBB: No sir it's not. Another park did that earlier this year because the lap bar wouldn't fit, and the gentleman died when he exited the car.

HP: Bullshit. This is discrimination.  

DBB: No it's not.

HP: I just waited three hours in the sun in order for you to humiliate me.  

DBB: Sir we provide a car in the front of the line for people to make sure they fit inside.  Did you try it out?

HP: I don't need to I know I fit!  I'm gonna sue, Im gonna sue everyone here!  I want my money back I came here just to get on this ride.

DBB: Well I can bring you to the ticket office, but I doubt they will refund your money sir.  But we can see what they can do.

HP: FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE!  JUST CUZ I'M BIGGER I HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST! THIS PLACE IS BULLSHIT.

Ok, time for some tough love.  

DBB: Listen. You know how big you are.

HP:.....What?

DBB: You're an adult. You know how big you are. This is no shock to you.  I can't imagine this is the first time you've run into an issue like this.  It sucks, I know.  I have a size 16 foot.  Think I can play hockey like I'd love to?  Nope.  Wanna go water skiing or snowboarding? Can't.  It sucks, but I'm aware of my limitations.  At least you have an option to change this man.  But right now this rides not happening, and you're keeping everyone else from getting on here.  

Suddenly, this gentleman's friend, who was also pushing 350lbs, starts screaming at me.

A NEW CHALLENGER APPEARS!!!

This guy starts yelling that we can't talk to his friend like that.  I'm a bigot. ETC ETC.  He actually squares off and says he's a green belt.

Ok E-Honda.  We can do this.

I'd love to say it was some sort of epic clash between us then.  But in reality I just stood there waiting and eventually he backed down.  I then escorted them to the ticket office to complain.  We had to stop TWICE for HP to catch his breath.  The whole time he's yelling about discrimination. How he's going to sue the park.  How he's going to get me fired. Eventually he gave up when the ticket office wouldn't refund his money and went back into the park. A short while later I saw him in a food area, a plate of cheeseburgers stacked in front of him, and he was visibly crying as he ate them.  

Fuck. Right in the feels.  So I approached, apologized if I added to his stress.  He apologized for acting out.  I told him about my weight loss, and we talked diet and excersize a bit.  He said he was gonna start eating better and walk every day.  I'd like to say I saw him down the road and he was fit and happy, but I never saw him again.  Wherever you are dude, I hope you're doing better.

I hope you enjoy. 

*Main Cast*

*Numbers: Yours truly. At the start of this story, I was but a wee' eighth Grade. I had been in air cadets for about a year at this point and was real big on the Survival and Camping stuff. As such, I dressed like a survivalist for most of my first year of high school. The 'Hulk' of my circle of friends.
*Ray: One of my best friends and still currently holds the position. We met at third grade and shared a lot of common interests. At eighth grade, he was actually fairly well muscled but short due to his Filipino blood. He was quiet and a bit of a beta at this point.
*Gerald: My other bro for life. He was fat. Like, he was 152cm at thirteen and easily weighed seventy kilos. He wasn't a ham though, just fat. Has a great sense of humor and was/is an all around awesome guy to be around to this day. He got picked on quite a bit throughout elementary and high school and my first meeting with him involved me forcing a few bullies to back off.

**Story Start**
Now, this tale takes place many summers ago. My friends and I had just transitioned from the bright and upbeat world of elementary school to the more grounded and dreary world of High School. Now, my friends and I were a tight group so we deemed to eat our first high school lunch together at the cafeteria which we later learned to avoid as if the place were a plague town.
Now, we had gotten our seats and had taken out our lunches. I don't quite recall specifically what we all had but I do recall that one of the items in Gerald's lunch was a personal bag of chips and that his lunch was larger than my lunch and Ray's lunch combined. We were eating quite peacefully when something happened. 
&gt;The fluorescent lights above our table and in the area surrounding began to flicker erratically. 

No problem, those lights do that all the time. Probably just need replacing again.
&gt;Around us, the noise of a busy high school cafeteria just died as if a pillow had been stuffed into each person's mouth. 

My freshman mind comprehended it as people just finally starting to eat and wrote it off as not being a sign of something horrifying. 
&gt;Finally, the light began to bend around a spot in the cafeteria and slowly, a crack in the hole of reality formed. Slowly but surely, an unspeakable horror from beyond the cusp of our understanding ~~walked~~ ~~waddled~~ oozed towards our table. It was 160cm tall, 130cm wide, apparently male, and had to have at least been 125 kilos. Grasped in it's hand was at least **two** bags of food from Wendys.

Now this, I noticed. Judging by the hushed whispers, everyone was expecting something to occur around this monster. I prayed to every deity I could think of to deliver us from this horror and have it walk away. Several moments later, I lost my faith in every deity to ever be worshiped as the beast stopped next to our table, eyeing Gerald's lunch with it's shrunken, dark, beady eyes. My friends and I stared back, wondering what we have done to summon Ham-Sothoth and why it would stop at our table. 
For a second nothing happened, our staring contest at a stale mate. Then, slowly at first, it opened it's mouth to speak. The stench of a thousand lost souls and untold number of burgers devoured hit us like a physical wall, sending Ray sliding down the bench a bit. His voice was loud but oddly high pitched.
&gt;""Hey there *pals*. I couldn't help but notice your fat friend""

At this, he waved one of his fat hands at Gerald. I couldn't help but notice the way his arm jiggled at the motion, a memory that really stuck with me. Needless to say, at this motion Gerald shrunk slightly as his bully senses started to blare louder than the Air Raid sirens of London.
&gt;""has a chip pack. He's fat enough as is and he has plenty of food. So I'll be taking it, I need the food more than *him* anyways.""

With that, the ham reached over and snatched Gerald's personal bag of chips and started to ooze back to whatever dimensional recess it came from. Meanwhile, Gerald stared at the spot where his chip pack was, eyes watering at what just happened while Ray attempted to process what exactly had occurred.
Being the first to compose myself, I *immediately* went 'aw hell no' and got out of my seat. With quick haste, I made my way to Ham-Sothoth's table of beasts and bullies where he had already began to devour one of his bag of foods. For the record, that bag had a large fries, two cheeseburgers, and a frosty. The beast noticed my approach and managed to divert filling his gullet for one moment to address me as [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkLeNuojfA) began to play.
&gt;""What do you want *pal*?""

I bristled at his constant use of pal, the notion that anyone would want to be friends with such a fat PoS filled my grade eight mind with rage.
&gt;""Look, I just want you to give my friend's chips back. You had no right to take it from him.""

At my demand, he laughed a laugh that was as every bit as annoying as his voice. It was nasally and high pitched, the laugh a Hyena would make.
&gt;""He **gave** these chips to me. Why don't you try opening your eyes a bit, huh?""

Now, I've yet to mention this, but I am Asian. Now, I say Asian because I'm of mixed descent being part Chinese and part Japanese. However, I was a fourth generation kid so there was a chance my family has been around as long as this fat asshole's family. Nearing the end of my fuse, it took every bit of my self control to not just floor the fatty right there and then.
&gt;""Look you fat fuck. I don't care what you fucking say to defend yourself. I *saw* you take those chips. Now give them back or I will **make** you give them back.""

With a twinkle in his eye, Ham-Sothoth nodded as if understanding my point. With his right, he stuffed what was left of a cheeseburger into his mouth while picking up Gerald's untouched chip pack with his left. He spoke, taking the effort to spit pieces of cheeseburger at me as he did.
&gt;""Well~ If your fat friend wants it back so much...""

He paused, looking contemplative for a moment. Then, without warning, he closed his hand and crushed the bag of chips. The sound of the poor bag popping under the pressure was audible by all as a small spray of chip fragments were sent flying through his knuckles. Opening his hand, he presented me the defiled and broken bag of chips.
&gt;""Then he can have them back like this.""

Now, the next part of this story I really don't have much personal memory of. I can only reconstruct what happened from what people have told me. 
Now, my friends were watching this entire confrontation. According to Ray, he could actually see something snap inside of me when Ham-Sothoth presented me the destroyed bag of chips. Consumed with the rage of a hundred thousand angry gods, I snatched Ham-Sothoth's second bag of Wendys faster then he could stop me and with all the might packed into my thirteen year old strength, I smashed the bag into the floor. To ensure the job was really done, I proceeded to jump on the food twice and grind it underneath the hell of my boots while the beast looked on, shocked. As the last of the burger and fries were rendered unidentifiable stains in the floor, I stared into his eyes and growled a single sentence back at him.
&gt;""Then I guess you wouldn't mind eating your food like this.""

Now, this set the beast off. He lunged at me and in a flash we began to trade blows. While he tried to hit me, he continued to scream about how he needed that food, how I didn't understand he needed to eat or he would die, and how his diabetes would kill him because of the food that he had failed to consume. Meanwhile, I was shouting back retorts for everything he said and giving him a few good blows of my own. This lasted all of ten seconds before a teacher and the school's cop stepped in and separated the two of us. Right there and then, we were asked what was happening.
Trying to break free of the cop's grip, the beast roared and proceeded to tell the most *bullshit lie* my friends had **ever** seen someone try to pull off. According to Ray and Gerald, he tried to paint himself as being the victim of an unprovoked bully who was out to take his food. Nobody bought that and when I was questioned, I shouted something about how he was an asshole bully who picked on freshmen because he was too pathetic to do anything else. With a few shouts of confirmation from those around, the fatty was vanquished to the office for further questioning and sentencing/suspension while I returned to my table victorious and with a teacher's help, we managed to acquire another bag of chips for Gerald.

Oh a few days later I got jumped by Ham-Sothoth's friends and they tried to beat the hell out of me on his command. By the time the cop got there, two dudes were on the ground grasping their groins in pain from taking kicks to the family jewels while I laid on the ground beat to hell and with a concussion and two fractured ribs. From what witnesses say, I went down cursing, screaming, and using my backpack like a flail before being taken down by five unharmed guys. That landed me a few weeks in a hospital and got Ham-Sothoth and his friends expelled.


**TL;DR:** First day of school and fat bully takes friend's chips. I make it to his table and demanded it back. He crushes it out of spite so I take his food and destroy it out of spite. An epic duel between titans ensures while he acts as if I had denied him some life saving drug that would cause him to die were he to go without it. After being caught, Fatty proceeds to blame me for fight which nobody believes and gets his ass suspended. Still upset by having his food taken, he proceeds to order his group of friends to beat me up an act they manage to accomplish at the cost of two of their members being crippled and rendered sterile. They get expelled, I get hospitalized."	t5_2vzax	True

Here it is folks, the resolution to the saga that has rustled so many jimmies.  This happen a week or so ago.

&gt;Be 2ish weeks before finals

&gt;Be about halfway through class period

&gt;Hamgar has polished off most of a family sized bag of cheetos and is 1/4 the way through his 2nd 2 liter of Mountain Dew

&gt;Kind of impressed that Hamgar has dropped down to 2 liters and hasn't increased the number of bottles consumed to compensate, still disgusting though

&gt;Also glad I don't drink soda anymore as Mountain Dew was my favorite and seeing Hamgar suck down a 2 liter has killed any craving for the stuff I have left

&gt;Professor begins to lecture on basic nutrition, talks about obesity and type 2 diabetes and how both can be controlled with diet and exercise

&gt;""BAH!"" from the back of the room, a haze of cheeto dust fills the air

&gt;Has Hamgar finally popped?

&gt;Nope he is just vocalizing his objection around a mouthful of orange beetus sticks

&gt;""Something to say, Hamgar?"" Professor asks

&gt;""Everyone knows it isn't as simple of diet and exercise, some people just can't loose weight and some people are just naturally skinny.  It's genetic.""

&gt;""There's actually not any studies that support that hypothesis, besides a small group of people a simple calorie deficient will cause weight loss."" 

&gt;Professor has clearly never seen fat logic the likes of this before

&gt;""Well I tried to diet and exercise for months and I never lost any weight, it doesn't work.""

&gt;Dafuq

&gt;I decided to speak up ""It worked for me.""

&gt;Hamgar glares Mcdeath at me ""Well you loosing a few pounds and me loosing a lot of weight is different.""

&gt;""Actually I lost more than a few pounds, I'm down 125 pounds from 310.  It was all just diet and exercise.""

&gt;""I don't believe you."" Says Hamgar, ""You just trying to prove me wrong.""

&gt;Could pull up my shirt and show him stretch marks

&gt;Decide driver's license will suffice, picture was taken 3ish years ago when I was at my heaviest, weight is very visible in my face

&gt;Walk up steps and set driver's license in front of Hamgar

&gt;""Believe me now?""

&gt;I can feel the hatred as Hamgar glares at me, he hates me even more than he hates lines at a buffet

&gt;Professor is smiling wide ""I'm happy to hear you were able to loose weight, Bringerofthenachos.  Would you care to share with the class how you did it.""

&gt;Go on to talk a bit about the low carb diet I went on and some of the exercise advice I found useful, done in a couple minutes

&gt;Hamgar quiet for rest of class

&gt;Later, as class be over, I'm filing out of the room along with everyone else when I hear a walrus behind me

&gt;""Hey!""

&gt;I turn to see a raging walrus coming at me

&gt;Wait its Hamgar

&gt;My god he has no food in his hand, his hunger is overwhelming him

&gt;See my life flash before my eyes as I'm sure I'm about to be eaten

&gt;[mfw](http://imgur.com/JGvXLpO)

&gt;Hamgar opens his mouth and a tide of stench assaults me along with his words

&gt;""I don't appreciate you calling me out like that in class.""

&gt;""Sorry man, but you were wrong on that one.  You were giving out false facts."" I reply trying to calm the rutting boar 

&gt;""You were just trying to fat shame me.  Its hard for me to loose weight, I bet it was easy for you.""

&gt;That pissed me off a bit, I remember all the shin splints form running, the sore muscles from weight lifting, gritting my teeth and ignoring shitty food cravings

&gt;Also this dude was talking loud, almost at a yell, people were looking

&gt;""No it wasn't easy, I just wanted to make a change and worked hard at it.""

&gt;""You don't think I work hard?"" the elephant trumpeted, ""I work really hard to watch what I eat.""

&gt;Wut.jpeg

&gt;""Are you serious?  Have you even paid attention to how much shit you have eaten this semester in this class alone?""

&gt;His pig eyes were seething

&gt;""I didn't eat that much.""

&gt;I can see the looks of shocked disbelief on everyone's faces, they couldn't believe this land whale would utter those words anymore than I could

&gt;""You ate bags of chips and drank liters of soda within the 3 hour span of this class.  Every time I saw you in this class you were eating enough calories to feed a family of 3 for a day.""

&gt;He goes into his thyroid-beetus rant

&gt;Normally I would just smile and nod like a beta, but this guy clearly wanted to make a scene and my hatred for him had grown as hot as 1000 suns, alpha mode engage

&gt;""If you can seriously say that you think you have a significant thyroid problem and that the solution of diabetes is to eat lots of crap, then you clearly didn't take anything from this semester at all.""

&gt;Hamgar looks around but his actions over the past 14 weeks have not won him any friends, he is with out allies

&gt;""I bet I'm doing better in the class than you are.""  Hamgar sounded strangely like a 5th grade kid arguing over who the better super hero is 

&gt;Wat mode level 2

&gt;The professor had read out the names of the people with the tops grades after every test, my name was read every time, I don't remember hearing Hamgar's once

&gt;""You know that's bullshit, the professor read the top test grades, he never said your name.""

&gt;Hamgar shot back ""He never read yours either.""

&gt;The girl who Hamgar took an interest in in part 3 speaks up, ""Yes he did, Bringerofthenachos got one of the highest scores on every test.""

&gt;Been working dat studying hard all semester

&gt;Hamgar begins to fall back on his flimsiest logic

&gt;""Well at least I'm happy.  Depriving yourself and starving all day is no way to live your life.""

&gt;Decide to speak the truth ""Keep eating the way you have been and you won't have a very long life to enjoy.""

&gt;People burst out into laughter

&gt;I didn't mean it to be funny, just wanted to tell Hamgar how it really is

&gt;Bacon grease runs from Hamgar's eyes and he goes waddling off as fast at his lard-weighted legs can carry him

&gt;Receive several pats on the back and ""He had it coming""s

&gt;See professor standing at end of hall, he smiles and gives me a thumbs up

&gt;Don't feel bad about causing the beast some emotional pain, but I don't feel the satisfaction I was expecting either

&gt;Hamgar didn't show up the next day, or the day after, nor for the final

&gt;Guess the predictions in the comments were right, he didn't pass the class


Thus ends the Hamgar saga.  Let us take a moment to mourn all the foods that died so bravely to give Hamgar his precious calories so that he did not turn his voracious appetite on his fellow man.  I still have a handful or incidents with Hamgar from the semester that don't warrant a full story themselves, so will post up a compilation of smaller stories at some point when I can catch another break between studying for finals.  I hope you have enjoyed these stories as much as seeing Hamgar's gross over consumption and blatant fat logic has disgusted me.

By the time school started, three out of four of us in the house were dating other people. (Can you guess which one was single?) I was dating Luke, Shirtless Hottie from next door. Yuri was dating Luke's friend, ""Scott"" who was in a band. Eric was seeing ""Cheryl."" Cheryl is a pretty, petite redhead who worked at the same bar with Eric. 

Ginger, of course, decides that Eric being with a redhead means he's secretly pining for her. Just for fun, here's a comparison. Cheryl is petite, under five feet, maybe 110 pounds at the most. Long auburn hair, tan skin, no luscious curves to speak of. Ginger is about the same height, but weighed two hundred pounds more. Cheryl is sweet, shy, and soft-spoken. Ginger is obnoxious, judgmental, and loud. Two sides of the same coin, I think not. But upon meeting her, Ginger is outraged. They are practically the same person, she says. Ginger loved to complain about her and saying how she and Eric were incompatible and looked ridiculous together. ""How could Eric choose her over me? She looks anorexic!"" 

One night, Scott comes over for sexytimes with Yuri, meaning I was kicked out of our room. Since Ginger was parked in the living room with a bucket of chicken and three volumes of Rurouni Kenshin, I decided to bunk with Eric. We were watching a movie on his computer, when I see a pink heart-shaped Post-it on Eric's pillow. Curious, I decide to read it. I remember the words exactly.

""Roses are red. Violets are blue. You don't know it, but I love you too.""

Sappy as fuck. I cringe and make fun of Eric for it, thinking it was from Cheryl. Eric turns beet red, and throws it away. ""Way harsh bro,"" I say to him, and ask if he and Cheryl are having problems. Then Eric confesses that it's not from Cheryl. The spots of grease and the scent of deep-fried chicken skin on Eric's bed suddenly made sense. Eric reveals that ever since he started dating Cheryl, these ""love notes"" had started appearing all over his room. They were on his pillow, under his keyboard, on his shoes, in the bathroom mirror, etc. Whenever he found them, he'd just throw them away. It was easy for Eric to avoid Ginger anyways, because of his two jobs and school he only ever came home at night most of the time. I was outraged that Ginger came into his bedroom while he wasn't there, but Eric didn't want to confront her about it. Tensions were already running high in the house, since the first day. Yes, Ginger was the cause of it all.

The biggest point of contention was probably food. Remember the ""you pay for your own food"" rule? Ginger would go to to the grocery store every few days, and buy about half the frozen the frozen food aisle. Girl could not cook if her life depended on it. All she ate was microwaved food- frozen pizza, frozen deep-fried chicken, frozen roast beef. If it wasn't that, it was fast food, pizza, or Chinese. It meant that she took about 98% of the freezer, and if you complained to Ginger about it she'd just argue that the refrigerator was too small. Yuri and I ate like a normal human being, meaning some vegetables, rice and meat. Eric only kept a box of cereal, bread and some lunch meat because he got free meals at the bar where he worked. If the rest of us ate someone's food, which we usually avoided, we'd either replace it or pay the other person. Ginger didn't. She felt that she had a right to all the food in the house and help herself to whatever was there. I learned quickly to not ever bring any chips or chocolate home, because they would vanish. I'd even keep some groceries over at Luke's.

Ginger would always deny having taken any of our food or refuse to pay us back and claim to be constantly broke even though I assumed she spent at least a hundred dollars a week on her microwave foods. Mama and Daddy were still paying for everything. Ginger and Yuri would have screaming matches every week because of the stolen food, and also about Yuri's boyfriend coming over. The first time Scott visited our house, Ginger predictably hit on him. She changed into a spaghetti-strap top and a mini skirt and pranced around him while the rest of us tried not to vomit. Yuri fanned the flames by making out with Scott in front of her. Ginger wigs the fuck out and calls her parents and actually demands that ""You stop that right now!"" I was rolling on the floor laughing. Then while she was on the phone with her Daddy, she tries to pass the phone to Yuri ""because Daddy wants to talk to you about this!"" Yuri laughs in her face, and he and Scott go upstairs for you-know-what. I escaped to Luke's next door while Yuri and Scott bumped uglies very loudly and Ginger cried on the phone to her father.

But back to Eric and Cheryl. She and Eric didn't date for very long- less than a month, I think, and unlike Scott she only came to our apartment once. She was so traumatized by Ginger's behavior towards her that she never wanted to go to our house again. Now I wasn't there, but Yuri was and he relayed me the story. Eric rarely had a day off, and since that was a special occasion Cheryl decided that she wanted to make a home-cooked dinner for him. Yuri decided to read in our room to give them some privacy. Ginger is not as inclined. She's so jealous and she doesn't hide it. Yuri said that when she saw Eric and Cheryl cuddling on the couch, she waddled straight to her room, changed into this low-cut red dress, and jumped into the couch right next to them. Cheryl's too nice for her own good and doesn't object and Eric doesn't want to yell at her because he's trying to bang Cheryl and yelling at Ginger would probably not lead to sexytimes. Ginger refuses to leave them alone and even cuts into their dinner even though Cheryl only cooked two steaks for her and Eric. Ginger gets a steak, and Cheryl and Eric share the other. All through the dinner, Ginger insinuates that Cheryl is too thin and that she has an eating disorder. Eric tried to intervene, but saintly Cheryl just keeps interrupting him and tells him to be nice to Ginger. Meanwhile, Ginger is bullying her to her face and rubbing her tits at Eric's face.

I have to stop here because I have to leave for work now, but Ginger's advances on Eric do get stronger. That will be next.

&gt;TL;DR at bottom.

Fuck guys, why does this happen to me and not you? So it was a lovely summers day when I heard we are getting new neighbors, ""sweet!"" you would think right? WRONG!! The first week was uneventful but I want to tell how they moved in anyway even though it is not really FPS material.  
So nice summers day afternoon when a moving truck and a minivan comes up to this house that was recently sold, out of the moving truck comes out 2 larges dudes who looks like they lift and out of the minivan comes out a man(?) 168cm, 150kg and a woman(?) 152cm, 120kg I guesstimate it at. They have the movers take out two chairs set one up by the door to the house and one inside I assume because the man sat down outside the house directing them where to put stuff, and I can only assume the woman did the same.

So after that is done everyone says hello and all that, they seem like nice, jolly people. They mention they have a daughter who is around my age (18) who will be coming shortly as she's staying with her grandmother at the moment because of the move. I think ""Nice, I hope she's hot!"" but we all know the odds here, right. ""She"" The Manatee (unoriginal I know) is about 150cm at 110kg and I couldn't be any less attracted to her even if she was literally Jabba the Hut which is important to this story.

So there I am mowing dat lawn on another nice summers day and The Manatee comes over and introduces herself and tells me that her mom said that there were a cute boy living next door. She tells me what she likes, which comes as a big surprise to me. She likes food, sitting around watching TV or sitting doing stuff on the computer and CUTE BOYS! As he said it she winked at me and I basically respond with ""That's nice... I have to get back to mowing the lawn. Could you move please?"" She waves goodbye and ~~walks~~ waddles back to her house. I get back to mowing and another neighbor ""Jessica"" (155cm 50kg) who comes over sometimes to ask me to open unopenable jars and battle giant vicious spiders that have claimed their house as her parents aren't home much now that she can take care of herself. This time she asked me to battle said giant vicious spider, she waits outside as I go into her house and kill and loot the creature, I go outside on the porch and get a thank you hug and I go back to mowing the lawn. Now you fully expect me to write about how The Manatee came over furious about how I would cheat on her, but no. As I ride my bike 20 minutes (each way) to my grandmother to say hello and mow their lawn I see her waving at me from a window. Mowing their lawn which takes about an hour and half, when I get back I've been gone 2 hours 10 minutes give or take. When I got to my house I see here there in a window winking and waving at me. She was waiting for me in that window for over 2 hours, I just cringe and go inside.

The next day Jessica who has an in ground pool was having a get-together or a party as you might call it. Practically anyone was invited, about 30-40 people show up including The Manatee. Everyone is having a good time, talking, drinking, eating, swimming, other stuff and The Manatee shows up in a bikini. I ask Thor why he would do such a thing to me as I continue talking to Jessica and one of her female friends. The Manatee goes straight for the beetus juice and snacks. An hour passes and and everyone has been in the pool at least once, except The Manatee. Over the course of that hour The Manatee gives every girl I talk to the evil eye and eye rapes me several time. I was once a again talking to Jessica as we walk at the edge of the pool and she slips, I somehow catch her and that is when The Manatee makes her move. The Manatee walks up to me asks me if I'd like to go somewhere more ""private"" as I'm literally holding Jessica from when she fell, I say ""no thanks, I'm kinda busy"" she gives me and Jessica the eye and she waddles off to the table with food and drinks.

By now someone had notices that The Manatee a creature of the sea has not been in the water at all and asks her why. She tells this brave person that she has a bad knee, elbows, that she gets very tired if she does some exercise and that her beetus acts up if she does something strenuous, while gulping down that 1,5L beetus juice. A few more hours pass and the party dies down and everyone left. I stay behind to help Jessica to clean up as I just live next door, we find that someone has been stuffing the mattress box with candy wrappers and empty bottles. I know who did it but decided not to tell Jessica as she was blissfully unaware. We finish up and I get a peck on the cheek and a hug as thanks for the help and I got back to my house for some downtime.

Around noon the next day I go outside for some fresh air and hear a crying sound coming from Jessicas house. I go over to see what it's about. I see Jessica there sitting on the porch crying, I go over to see what had happened but she says nothing, I try to comfort her but it's no use. When I see The Manatee waddling at an incredible pace looking furious and snacking on a snickers bar I know what happened. Jessica sees the creature and runs inside and locks the door for me to confront the beast. The Manatee waddles past me up to the door and screams 

&gt;""I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND YOU SKINNY WHORE! HE LIKES REAL WOMEN NOT STICKS LIKE YOU!""

After that she walks up to me tries to put her hands on me that, that whore wont be bothering me anymore and that we should go back to her house to cuddle. I push her away and tell I'm not her boyfriend and that I think she is disgusting and way too fat for me to find her attractive in anyway. I also tell her she has a shitty personality. She cries saying she has a condition and she can't help that she's ""big boned"" and ""gains weight for no reason at all"" and that I'm fat-shaming her. She waddles off in quite the hurry crying.

After an hour Jessica had calmed down and told me that The Manatee came up to her, pushed her and told her that if she ever even spoke or looked at Ploggy again that she would kill her. That Ploggy is MY boyfriend not hers and that Ploggy likes real women with curves and that'd we'd had sex like 5 times already and said that Ploggy loved every second of it. Well, I'm a kissless virgin so I think I'd remember having sex at least once not to mention five times. I try to cheer her up but Jessica is easily frightened and I can only imagine how scary it must have been to pushed by someone at least twice your weight.


&gt;TL;DR New neighbors with a ham daughter who creeps at the window for me, gives the evil eye to any girl I talk to and eye rapes me several times at a party. Threatens a friend of mine tells the friend that I'm her boyfriend and that we'd have sex even though we haven't. Blames conditions and fat-shaming for all her lies.

If you've manage to read this far without making a comment about how Jessica wants the ""D"", don't, I've known her all my life and she considers me a brother and she already have a boyfriend.

This happened quite recently and I don't know if there will be more parts, I will update you all if there are. I know how you crave it for you beetus and conditions. Stay fit my friends!"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; behold her in all her glory: [6' 2"", 365 pounds](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-15012-body-shape.htm?StartAt=32#.UbUClfaDQeM), stringy hair (naturally blonde) dyed a horrific black of some sort. 

&gt; notice she is wearing all black and carrying a green apron.

&gt; [mrw](http://i.imgur.com/1CLfizu.jpg)

&gt; land whale lumbers to the registers and orders her favorite concoction. ""Just make me a latte with a pump of each syrup. We call it a graveyard at my store!""

Note: This grates my nerves for several reasons. Firstly, ""her store"" is no longer that godforsaken place she refers to because she has officially transferred to this new one. Secondly, THAT'S FUCKING GROSS. A pump of everything meant a pump (.25-.33 oz each depending on type of syrup) of: hazelnut, sugarfree hazelnut, vanilla, sugarfree vanilla, toffee nut, peppermint, raspberry, caramel, sugarfree caramel, dark cherry (promo flavor at the time), classic syrup, chai, white mocha, mocha, cinnamon dolce, and sugarfree cinnamon dolce.

&gt; nod to my bewildered register barista who asks how to ring it up while I begin making the concoction. 

&gt; be good barista trainer/future supervisor and ask Land Whale Coworker about herself.

&gt; ""I just came from Alaaaska. It's sooo hot here.""

&gt; contain thought that Oregon is pretty much never hot and it might be the excess insulation on her body that is creating the heat.

&gt; Land Whale Coworker continues. ""I came down here to get promoted. I'm gonna be the next supervisor at this store and then assistant manager!""

&gt; do not react.

&gt; ""Who's my trainer, anyway? Just tell them I don't need training. I already learned everything at *my store*.""

&gt; ""That would be me.""

&gt; awkwardsilence.exe

&gt; finish drink and hand it over. ""Here's your nasty latte. Once you clock on, go ahead and come back here and meet me in the back zone.""

&gt; spend first thirty minutes of training shift explaining operations at this particular store, giving Land Whale Coworker a tour, and subtly checking her policy and procedure knowledge.

&gt; Land Whale Coworker don't know nothin'.

&gt; give Land Whale Coworker a chance to be on the espresso bar during the slow period to watch her drink making skills.

&gt; big mistake

&gt; Land Whale Coworker's fat rolls knock an open gallon of milk onto the floor where she stares dumbly as it glug-glug-glugs out of the jug. Mmm, cow juice.

&gt; ""Who put that there? Heehee."" 

&gt; noownership.moron

&gt; ""You."" Ephemeralcynosure is in no mood for Land Whale Coworker's bullshit, even on day one. ""You hit it.""

&gt; ""I was reaching over here for a cup, not over there!""

&gt; ""Tell that to your stomach.""

&gt; “Are you gonna clean it up for me?”

&gt; “Uhh... no.”

&gt; “But I have bad hips! I can’t do it.”

&gt; spend another thirty or so minutes correcting nearly every part of Land Whale Coworker's technique. Customers unhappy.

&gt; ""You shouldn't treat me like this."" Oh yeah? ""I'm gonna be your boss really soon and then you'll behave.""

&gt; ""Mmhm."" 

&gt; ""Also, just because this store was designed for skinny people doesn't mean I am not good at this job. People love me!"" Land Whale Coworker shimmies for effect. The ripples continue for several minutes after core movement has ceased.

&gt; ""They also love to get the actual thing they ordered, made correctly.""

&gt; Land Whale Coworker also complains about: (1) how the aprons are waaay too small; (2) that the preparation zone of the store (only about 5 feet wide which is not much when multiple people are back there) is a TP trap; (3) customers not complimenting her red lipstick.

&gt; five minutes later, Land Whale Coworker dumps an entire pitcher of milk to the floor instead of safely shelved on the espresso machine’s shelf. ""It isn't my fault my hand doesn't fit into the pitcher handles!""

&gt; ""It isn't the pitcher's fault that your hand doesn't fit into its handles, either.""

&gt; ""You're a bitch. I can't wait to be your boss.""

&gt; [I'm not liiistening.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/032340c0f2b6c4825bedc0715f75e6e7/tumblr_mimkgh5DyB1rm76xwo1_500.gif)

&gt; ""That's just like a skinny person, you know. Just ignoring me when I'm being mean. You think you can just hold your head up high because you're better than me? You're not!"" Land Whale Coworker gestures emphatically and the back of her hamhand perfectly hits the center of gravity of a ~~venti~~ large latte, sending it careening across the handoff counter.

&gt; ""Look what you made me do!""

&gt; no response because I'm staring, mesmerized, as I realize the milk and espresso has shot across the thin storefront, hit the meeting place of the floor and wall, and splattered four feet up the wall a good ten feet away.

&gt; customers’ eyebrows have shot up to the ceiling and now adorn the tile like fuzzy caterpillars.

&gt; ""I'm gonna tell the manager!"" Land Whale Coworker turns huffily and bellyslams another coworker, about 5' 4"" and 110 pounds. The smaller coworker is completely knocked off balance and flies backwards, dumping the FULL urn of coffee (roughly 160oz) on the ground. “You were in my way!”

&gt; “Listen, Whaley, *everyone’s* in your way. You take up the whole way. Go get the mop and clean up your mess.” I’m pretty peeved at this point.

&gt; useless manager sticks his head out of the back room, seeing the store awash in beverage-making liquids. “What is going on?!”

&gt; my reply: “Spatial awareness training.”

&gt; Land Whale Coworker: “I hate you.”

1370086111.0	1fgkg6	"She ""lost the genetic lottery"""	Fidubuda	787	136	111	"So a few months back I landed a new job at a big amusement park. Sounds cool, but it's pretty much just another shitty job, just in slightly less shitty surrounds than your local dirt mall. 

The story that follows is rather long, sorry.

Company policy says all new employees have to take a first aid course. Not the most appealing way to spend 10 hours on a Saturday, but at least I'm getting paid for it.

Rock up on the day of the training course and meet a bunch of my fellow new employees. About 10 of us. Pretty much your average mix of young people working a shitty job to pay the bills - cute jock guy, goofy hipster, shy bookworm, miscellaneous non-descripts, etc.

Oh, and one giant landwhale. I'm guessing 25, 5'3, 320lbs. 

The course gets started. The first session is all about medical emergencies - heart attack, stroke, beetus coma, etc. Based on my observations of the high volume of manatees that wallow in our pools whilst eating a never ending smorgasbord of fried or frozen fat and drinking bottomless cups of liquid sugar, this is the type of first aid they want us to learn the most.  

Our instructor is one of those guys who likes to use personal examples to illustrate his lessons. He asks us all to share our stories. We start the day learning about what to do if someone's having a heart attack.

""Has anyone here been present when somebody's had a heart attack?""

A couple of people share their stories. Shy book nerd's dad had a heart attack last year. Cute jock guy visited his gran-ma in hospital a few hours after she had a heart attack. Landwhale pipes up.

""I once had a small blockage near my heart. Not quite a heart attack, but sort of the same.""

Please. I read my course material. A heart blockage is a heart attack. You're 25 and you've had a heart attack. 

A heart attack.

At 25.

The instructor looks a bit shocked and doesn't really know what to say. He quickly moves on.

An hour or so later we get to learning all about the beetus. The instructor goes down his usual path of seeking personal stories. I'm sure you know the personal story that appeared, so I won't bother elaborating.

The morning session finishes with us practicing what to do if someone is unconscious - basically you check that they're breathing and roll them onto their sides. I end up in a group of 3 with landwhale and cute jock guy. 

We take it in turns to be the unconscious patient and to be the person who puts the unconscious patient on their side. It's my job to roll landwhale onto her side. I literally can't. I'm F/21/5'5/140lbs - landwhale isn't going anywhere with me pushing. What's worst is that I have nothing solid to push. My hands just get sucked into these soft  jello-like vortexes where the hip and shoulder bones should be. 

Cute jock guy is clearly a lifter, so he helps me roll the landwhale over. We share a look. We know how those guys from Greenpeace feel when they save the seawhales that get lost and turn up on our beaches. 

Lunch time. I'm having tuna on rye crackers, an apple and carrot sticks with cottage cheese. Landwhale is having an 8oz Hershey's bar with a side of Fanta. I kid you not. We both catch each other looking at each other's lunch in disgust. I can tell she thinks I have an eating disorder. I think she has an eating disorder. 

The afternoon session is all about injuries. We quickly arrive at the topic of dislocations and fractures.

Instructor: ""Dislocations and fractures can be very painful. Has anyone here ever had one of these injuries?""

The war stories start.

Me: ""I dislocated my finger once when I was playing lacrosse and got smacked hard by an opponent's stick.""

Landwhale shakes her head like she pities me. 

Cute jock guy: ""Fractured my arm playing football.""

Another shake of the landwhale's head. And a heffalump sigh. Then it's her turn.

""I dislocated both of my knees recently.""

Instructor: ""Oh, how did that happen?""

Landwhale (laughing) : ""I don't know. I was just walking up some stairs and they went. It was really weird.""

Wut?

You dislocated your knees because you were walking up stairs?

I have had a striker kick me **hard** in the knee while I was goalkeeping in soccer and my knee didn't dislocate.

Dislocated knee.

Walking.

Up stairs.

Instructor: ""Wow. You've really been in the wars haven't you?""

Landwhale: (Laughing) ""I know. I guess I just lost the genetic lottery. Mom and dad have real bad knees, so it runs in the family. Same with the beetus.""

Yeah. That's what caused your heart attack, beetus and dislocated knees. Genetics. Not that giant block of chocolate you had for lunch. Or the equally giant bottle of Fanta you washed it down with. It's genetics' fault. I'm gonna make a wild guess and say mom and dad don't mind the occasional tub of salted fat either. 

Goofy Hipster decides to break the shocked silence that has enveloped the room.

""I broke my wrist when I was cycling to college the winter before last and slid on some ice."" 

Instructor: ""Wow. Exact same thing happened to me about 5 years ago. riding my bike to work, hit some ice and down I went. Stuck my hand out and broke my wrist.""

Landwhale shakes her head again. Decides to say something.

""Wow. Two broken wrists, a broken arm and a dislocated finger all from playing sports. It's such a dangerous activity. Why would you put yourself in harm's way like that.""

I'm speechless. I am without speech. So is everyone else in the room. 

I thought people like this only existed on places like /r/fatpeoplestories. But they're real and they work at an amusement park near you.

**TLDR:** 25 y/o landwhale reveals that she has had a heart attack, has the beetus and has dislocated both knees whilst walking up stairs. Goes on to berate sports players for participating in dangerous activities.

1375169691.0	1jc3qd	Hamplanets Drive An Anorexic Girl To Tears	dadoodad	776	123	148	"Hello fellow beetus sufferers &amp; condishun lovers! 

My last tale involved me vomiting due to the eldritch stench of a hamplanet while at work (I'm an RMT). This one will be about a young woman trying to STOP vomiting at all. What do I mean? Read on &amp; prepare to gorge on a double helping of fat logic.

Note: Formatting will be crap as I'm writing this from my phone so please bare with me until my desktop is back up &amp; running. And apologies for the length. Always with the length.

This tale occurs in May of this year. I'm a very skinny fat 30 year old male (only fat on me is on my stomach but theres quite a bit) just beginning my journey into lifting and as such I'm very VERY beta and too self conscious to lift amongst groups of people. So I do most of my work at a 24 hour gym very late/very early where there may only be 5 people in the whole place, staff included. 

First, some back story. During my time there I noticed there was a young girl, 18 years old, very tiny (lets call her ""Powergirl"" or PG...she likes DC comics) and struggling to perform certain lifts properly. I may not be strong, but I do know proper form. Hoping I wouldn't come off as a creepy old guy in an almost empty gym with minimal staff, I ask her if she wouldn't mind some help with her form. Luckily for me, she didn't hurl the dumbells at me &amp; accepted my offer. Up close she was far smaller than I thought, almost emaciated but she did have a healthy glow &amp; energy to spare. 

Over the following days &amp; weeks we'd see each other very late or early &amp; chat. After a few weeks she felt comfy enough to tell me why she's working out at this ungodly hour. She's a recovering anorexic. She didn't go into details but she had a rough childhood filled with physical, mental &amp; emotional abuse at the hands of boyfriends &amp; her family which led her to becoming sick. She had left a recovery centre about a month before we ran into each other and had just recieved the go ahead from her therapists &amp; physicians to very slowly begin trying to gain weight &amp; exercise. She's been through a lot for someone so young &amp; is still recovering in every aspect. She doesn't do well in crowds so the best time for her is to exercise in an almost empty gym. 

Now that the back story has been dealt with, allow me to introduce the villains of our tale: Yog &amp; Shub (Yog Sothoth &amp; Shub Niggurath for those unfamiliar with the Cthulhu Mythos). These two Horrors From Beyond were very good at fooling mortals into thinking they were there to lose weight &amp; not to destroy the sanity of humanity with their fat logic. No overly revealing gym clothes, no food for their beetus, no soul destroying stench wafting from foul nether regions of existence...they looked like they were there to work. 

""Good for them!"" I think with a slight nod &amp; smile towards them. 

 No smile nor nod back, but whatever. Lo &amp; behold, my tiny informal gym buddy is here! I'm not sure how much weight she's put on over the last few weeks but she's looking healthier! Fuller face, bit of a bottom &amp; hips (I'm still a guy, I can't help but notice) and a noticeable bounce in her step. Knowing what she told me about her life, seeing her look happier plucked at my heart strings a bit. And for today, she wanted me to spot her during her attempt at her first bench press doing more than the bar! 

Lets do this!!

She only had 10 pounds total added to the bar (5 a side) but its a start! Shub &amp; Yog are about 10 feet away sitting at the leg extension machines with a direct sightline of the bench press station. They can see us &amp; we can see them. PG banged out a set of 5 reps without a wobble, down to the chest &amp; full extension!  

Color me impressed!! 

I give her a high five, a short rest &amp; set her up for the next set. I have yet to see any movement from Yog &amp; Shub nor hear any movement from the machines but I do hear tee hees, snorts and ""tsking"". 

They seem oddly interested in something over here...oh god...please don't let my minimal gains attract these two entities...I left my copy of the Necronomicon at home!! I'm helpless!! 

Trying not to run screaming, I help PG finish her last rep &amp; rack it for her. Soon she'll be able to bench press me! Poor little PG starts to notice the attention those two Shoggoths are paying towards us and she's visibly becoming agitated. Before I can usher her away, the weight room rattles...the bench press bar is bouncing in the rack...the Smith machines are bouncing along the floor!! CTHULHU HAS RISEN!!! IA! IA!! IA!!!! Wait...no...its Shub &amp; Yog. 

""Scuse me (they may be horrible beasts but they still have Canadian manners) but me &amp; ma friend here thinks you shouldn't be here any more. Ya see, we can't do our exercises lookin ats you like dis.""

....wut....

""I'm sorry, what are you talking about ?"" I chuckle. That bit of confused laughter earned me a stare of evil from Shub while Yogs terrifying gaze never left PG. 

""We needs ta be here, she don't. You like showin off yur skinny bitch body? Yuh like makin us feel bad? Yuh think guys are gonna want a bag of skin &amp; bone? Go eat a donut, go have a steak, just get outta here ya twig"". 

Urge to kill....rising....

I can feel PG starting to tremble on the bench beside me &amp; hear her starting to breathe faster &amp; shorter...she's panicking. 

Shubs powers of darkness overwhelm my retort and it utters the words of darkness that no one who has been through what PG has been through should ever hear: ""Who ya kidding, she looks like she's a puker. You're a puker aren't ya? She can't eat shit, she just pukes it all up. Don't you be puking near me, I gots a weak stomach &amp; can't see dat shit. It'll make me sick! You'd like dat huh? Den you can keep showin off your bones. Get rid of us curvy girls eh?"" 

PG is sobbing now &amp; trembling worse than I thought humanly possible.  

Shubs horrible assault continues: ""Oh crap, lookit her, she's gunna puke. Bitch get away, you gunna make us sick, I can't get sick!!"" 

Poor PG has had enough &amp; with a speed that took me by surprise she darts across the weight room crying &amp; mumbling to herself heading towards the lockr rooms. 

""Ha!!! See?!?! I knew dat bitch was a puker! Why the hell is a guy like you with her? You gonna be gettin poked when you fuck her, guys need cushions, guys loooooove ma cushions! "" 

That's fucking it!!!

I'm beyond furious by then.  The shock is gone, and now I'm tempted to use the kettle bells in the corner as a bludgeon. But no, it won't work. As with all mighty Cthulhu (insanity and gore be upon him) when he was rammed by the ship in ""Call of Cthulhu"", these two..things..would merely reform under my blows &amp; continue their horrendous mocking. 

""Look, you fat whore CUNTS!! I don't know what your fucking problem is or if you even care what you've just done but you've just fucked up that kids progress from the last while! You may have just made her sick again! You don't have curves, you've got fucking rolls! You (Shub) look like the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man &amp; you Michelin Man (Yog) need to go change clothes before someone mistakes you for a fucking pile of walking tires!"" 

Its hard to think of good insults when you're a furious geek. 

At this point I think I just let loose a very long string of barely comprehensible insults. Hell I almost passed out from screaming at those two elders of evil. I don't have a condishun,  I swear!  

Some of my words seems to have stunned Shub &amp; Yog into silence (am I a wizard?). The two night shift staff are now here with jaws on the floor as well. I run towards the locker rooms to check on PG while flipping off Shub &amp; Yog only stopping at the door way to call her name. No response. Oh fuck. 

I pretty much yank the female staff member to the locker room &amp; tell her to look for PG. No sign of her. I demand that they check the security cameras to see if she's anywhere on the property. No sign. But according to the electronic sign in/out she had apparently left during my tirade against the gruesome twosome. 

To cut this short, I got Shub &amp; Yog booted &amp; banned from the gym after a fellow early exerciser who was hidden from our view backed me up when I filed a complaint with the owner. No refunds on the expensive personal training lessons &amp; yoga classes either. 
Now onto the sad part. I don't know what happened to PG. I haven't seen her at our ""usual"" time and neither has the night staff. Its been a couple months and I'll admit, not running right after her weighs on me.  I just hope that event didn't cause a relapse.

TL; DR: Yog Sothoth &amp; Shub Niggurath drive a recovering anorexic girl to near hysterics &amp; possibly caused a relapse.

EDIT: As per several peoples suggestions, today I'll be asking the gym to contact PowerGirl to see if she's ok or at the very least what has resulted from Shub &amp; Yogs abuse. Keep your fingers crossed for good news everyone! "	t5_2vzax	True

This story took place at the beginning of April. My husband and I got married in a small, private ceremony with just our immediate families there with us. We kept our plans extremely quiet, because gossip here spreads faster than butter on a hot waffle.

I had taken a few weeks off of work to spend time with my mother and sister, as well as get hitched. I didn't tell anyone at work. At this point, RW is taking about her wedding nearly *every fucking day* about how stressful the planning is and the cost and blah blah blah.

Our story picks up when I get back to work.

&gt; Workin' a long shift, boo

&gt; Lots of congrats thrown around by coworkers and regulars

&gt; Glowing like a fucking newlywed

&gt; Promise to bring in pictures, cuz bitches love pictures

&gt; RW appears to take over for me

Now, RW for all of her infuriating tendencies does tend to be a pretty jovial coworker. She's especially happy when she's giving someone shit, but that's besides the point.

&gt; Strange expression on the whale's face

&gt; Looks similar to the face she makes when she doesn't get free food from restaurants

&gt; Probably anger

&gt; Prepare for incoming rant about how some fast food calorie buffet didn't sate her feminine needs

&gt; RW ""How *dare you*!""

&gt; wat?

&gt; RW ""You KNEW I was getting married at the end of May and you just *had* to go and ruin it by getting married behind my back! You are such a *bitch*. I swear, skinny people only think of themselves. I can't believe how *selfish* you are!""

&gt; Still not sure if this is actually happening

&gt;lol of course it is, RW is irrational as a mother fucker

&gt; ""I don't need to run my life plans by you, just for the record. I've been planning this for about a month, I just didn't want to make a fuss out of it.""

&gt; RW ""So you ADMIT IT!""

&gt; ""Admit *what* exactly? That I got married? Yeah. Totally did. Super happy about it. Thanks for your concern.""

&gt; RW ""You admit that you're a backstabbing little sneak! You absolutely have *ruined my wedding*.""

&gt; ""How exactly did I ruin *anything* by marrying my boyfriend? Other than the fact that you can't give me shit about living in sin anymore, I guess. That's kind of ruined now.""

&gt; RW ""You always make EVERYTHING about *you!*. No one else is allowed to be happy, because you always have to lord over everyone about how skinny and perfect you are! So of course when you found out that *I* was getting married you just had to sabotage it by taking all the attention away!""

&gt; ""My marriage to my husband has absolutely nothing to do with you. Or your plans. I rarely ever get to see my mother, so I wanted to seize the opportunity while she was in town. If you're expecting an apology you won't be getting one, because I've done nothing wrong.""

&gt; At this point she starts blubbering (haaaaaaa puns) and runs back to talk to our manager

&gt; She's gone maybe 10 minutes, looking triumphant with some half devoured snack cake.

&gt; RW ""P needs to see you before you leave.""

P being one of our managers.

&gt; w/e no shits given, pack up my shit go talk to manager

&gt; Knock on the door, cuz fuckin' manners ""You wanted to talk to me?""

&gt; P sighs, ""Sit down and close the door.""

&gt; P ""RW says that you just yelled at her in front of customers and coworkers, saying that fat people don't deserve to be happy and that she needs to lose weight.""

&gt; P is overweight, for the record

&gt; ""When have you ever known me to comment about anyone else's weight? She's lying to you and if you call G in here, she'll corroborate my side.""

G had been standing nearby growing more and more red in the face during our exchange. Mofo has my back.

&gt; G comes in to the office, face still red

&gt; P asks G what happened up front

&gt; G ""That stupid bitch just will not leave Viza alone. Everyday she comes in here - Every. Damn. Day. She makes some comment about her weight, her man, her life. Today was fuckin' ridiculous. She comes in yellin' at Viza for getting married and pushin' her fat ass out of the spotlight for a fuckin' day. I swear if you don't do something about her, she's gonna get jumped in the parking lot.""

Yes. That is how G talks to our managers. Yes. They are fine with it.

&gt;P just shakes her head ""You can go on home, Viza. I'll talk to her later this evening when it slows down.""

&gt; G walks with me back up to the front, still steaming at the ears

&gt; RW smirks as I walk past, tell G goodbye

&gt; Hugs cuz bitch is awesome

&gt; As I walk toward the door, I hear G start yelling again

&gt;Naturally I slow down

&gt;Cuz dis gon' be gud

&gt; G ""Now listen here, RW, I need you to know that if I ever hear you talking to Viza like that again, I have a bat and a shotgun in my car with your name on it. And I know where ya live. Keep your fat ass mouth closed, you hear me? Don't make me call ya momma, either.""

&gt; RW pouts, but nods

&gt; Ain't no one messin' with G.

Now, it's only been a month, but she hasn't said anything else to me at this point. I don't believe G would actually be violent toward her, but it was a damn good threat because RW is still scared.

There are still old stories I will tell you guys, so please do not panic and get your beetus more riled up than your jimmies.

1375399832.0	1jj2ic	UPDATE: Two Hamplanets Drive An Anorexic Girl To Tears	dadoodad	785	148	107	"Desktop is still down, still writing this from my phone but will properly format when I can.

The last time I was on here I told the story of how I had an informal gym buddy who was a young recovering anorexia sufferer who was driven out of the gym by a oair of evil hamplanets that I have dubbed Shub &amp; Yog (Shub Niggurath &amp; Yog Sothoth of Lovecraftian fame). Not only do those names sound hamplanet worthy, but is also an accurate description of their evil nature.

Here's a quick recap:
- meet young female anorexia sufferer very late/very early at gym, just getting back on her feet
- help her with lifts, become friends
- one day two blobs ridicule her to the point she runs out, I go atomic on them, no word on her until now.

Thanks very much to the Redditors who suggested I ask the gym to contact her to check on her. I'm still smacking myself for not thinking of it sooner. 

They managed to get ahold of a family member who has been caring for her and sadly things didn't go well after the gym event. :(

PG (PowerGirl) relapsed. Hard. From what I was told she began purging and began hurting herself in more overt ways. I wasn't given much information (neither was the gym) but it was severe enough to require emergency hospitalization. 

But, there is some good news. She is back in treatment and receiving the mental, physical &amp; emotional support she desperately needs. She has been in treatment for just over a month now after spending a few weeks in a downward spiral. 

The gym owner has offered their sincere apologies and support and they were kind enough to relay a message of support &amp; encouragement from me. 

Its infuriating to know that those two acolytes of the Great Old One Shum-Adipose drove a young kid back into hell for no reason whatsoever! PG didn't even look in their direction that morning and yet...well...read the story. 
All you beetus sufferers &amp; victims of thin privilege, keep PG in your thoughts and if anyone is a gym goer, do me a favor: if you happen to see an unusually small person (male or female) within 20 feet of a hamplanet PLEASE keep an on them. People on both ends of the weight spectrum deserve support if they're trying to gain or lose weight, but it seems the smaller people are particularly vulnerable. Especially when they're trying to stay out of a sentient gravity well. 

It remains to be seen if PG will return to this gym once she's no longer deemed a danger to herself or if she'll return to a gym at all. But I'll keep FPS posted if she does. 

She's safe now &amp; that's a relief. From what I saw of her she's a tough one &amp; she WILL make it, it'll just be a longer, rougher road than it should have been.

Fucking blobs eh?

1373910107.0	1icovx	Chinese Buffet: No, you can not eat all the food!	Press_Start_Level_Up	792	150	191	"TL;DR: Fat man tries to eat EVERYTHING at a Chinese buffet, owners say NO!



This story takes place a few years back when I was dating my now ex-boyfriend. While dating this guy, I worked really hard to get into shape; biking approximately 40 miles a day to visit him because neither of us had a car. I was feeling really good about myself; however, he managed to gain 30lbs, all the while calling me fat. For the record I was 18F 5’ 11” and 177lbs. He was 5’10” and 210lbs. His family was far worse though. His mother (Porkus Rotundus) was a swelling planet of about 340lbs at 5’4”. His father (Ham Mountain), a mountain of a man, approximately 6’6” and a staggering 500lbs+ Their idea of a fun day out was going to eat at a Chinese Barffet (see what I did there?). This is where our story takes place . . .


As we approach the double doors of the Chinese Barffet, I can visibly see the terror in the eyes of the poor servers who would be faced with this solar system of grease and blubber. I had already been sucked into the orbit of these two massive planets and their moon. The servers must have feared they would be next. 


Without a word to the hostess, Ham Mountain waddles right up to a table nearest the food; an act he must have taken a hundred times before.  

&gt;“I want ta sit close ta the food so’s I dun have ta walk as far.” 

With actions I did not believe possible from a man of his size, HM lurches forward with lightning speed towards the buffet and shovesl food onto his plate. Porkus Rotundus follows swiftly behind her ham mate and begins piling the food on. 


I watch in disgust as PR’s arm fat, draping several times over itself, slides into the food trough in front of her as she reaches for something further back. Her arm is now slick with a creamy cheese sauce that slowly runs down her arm and into her shirt sleeve. I nearly gag as I watch her giggle and grab her arm fat. 

&gt;No! Don’t do it! For the love of God why?!

She begins licking the sauce off her arm folds! I nearly lose it then and there. My appetite has vanished and has been replaced with a churning feeling of nausea. 


My ex returns to the table with a heaping plate of food, his parents return with a plate in each hand, literally spilling over with various foods all covered in sauces, grease, and deep fried. I sip my water and watch as the family goes into beast mode. No forks, no spoons, nothing. They are scooping their food into their mouths, which are so close to the table, it was hard to tell if they were bringing the food to their mouths or if they had just decided to give up and stick their faces directly in it. 


After they finish, they each lean back, eyes glazed over, and begin to wheeze. They had actually stopped breathing in order to consume the food faster. There was no room for air as they choked down their meals. After a few minutes of labored breathing, they scooted out of their chairs and stumbled up to the buffet for seconds. This time, they had their eyes set on the crab legs. 


As a herd, they moved as one towards the crab, shoving people out of their way as they went. They divided the legs amongst themselves, leaving nothing for the other customers. Again they ate as though they need not breathe; cracking and slurping the meat from the legs. I manage to share a few legs from my ex’s plate. 


Once finished, the family stands up as one and returns to the buffet for more crab legs. To their surprise the servers have not put any more crab legs out. So you know what they do? They stand there and wait, and wait, and wait. I must admit, for hamplanets, they were surprisingly patient. After about 10 minutes of standing there, picking food from the buffet and eating it while they watched the kitchen door for any signs of movement, a server approaches them. 

&gt;“We will not bring anymore crab. You are done! Go!”


Do my ears deceive me? Was this heap of heaving hippos just told to stop eating? While this is an all you can eat buffet, I do not believe they expected ALL of their food to be eaten from just three customers. It was then that the shouting match commenced.

&gt;“HOW DARE YEW! MAH FAMILY PAID TO EAT HERE! THIS IS A BUFFET AND WE CAN EAT AS MUCH AS WE WANT! “

&gt;“You eat all of the crab legs! No other customers can get any!”

&gt;“THEY JIST ERN’T FAST ENOUGH. THEY CAN HAVE WHAT WE DON’T TAKE. YEW CAN’T TELL US WHAT WE CAN EAT!”

&gt;“Go now! You don’t get any more food.”

&gt;“WELL, I’M GUNNA SUE! THIS IS DISCRIMINATION! JUST BECAUSE WE CAN EAT MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE DOESN’T MEAN YEW CAN TELL US NOT TO. THE NEWSPAPERS WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS. I AM GOING TO SINK YER BUISNESS INTO THE GROUND. ”


At this point I can only watch, unblinking at this man who has eaten enough for 5 or so people is trying to argue that he needs more food. I also begin to think that this may not be the family I want to be involved with in the future. With a final “HARUMPH!” we leave, HM doing his best to storm out of the restaurant and PR giving everyone in the restaurant dirty looks.

&gt;Be at college not too long ago

&gt;Decide to go to a get together with a few buddies to watch Game of Thrones. Host tells me to feel free to bring anyone along

&gt;Remember that my good friend and love interest, Carol, is a huge GoT junkie. Naturally, I ask if she’d like to come along.
 
doesabearshitinthewoods.jpg

&gt;Carol’s around 5ft. and weighs no more than 100lbs. soaking wet. She’s got amazing boobies, a tiny waist, a stunning personality despite having a few… aggression issues. She’s also one of the most athletic people I’ve ever met

&gt;We arrive somewhat late and the hair immediately stands up on the back of my neck when we reach the door. My stomach tells me to run 

&gt;It’s here 

&gt;Plopped on the couch like a dead whale chillin’ on the beach, is Paula. 

&gt;Somehow she got the idea that we were her best friends till death do we part after she was shown kindness once. 

Bigmistake.jpg

&gt;Now, she was tolerated only because we’re a bunch of ninny betas and we pitied her for having no friends. 

&gt;The well of kindness was running dry because we found out why she had no friends- she was cunt. A big fat cunt.

&gt;This behemoth stands around 5ft. 7in. and weighs about as much as a small grizzly bear (around 400lbs). Think of Honeyboo boo’s mom covered in Hot Topic crap. That’ll give you an idea of what we’re working with. Along with her girth, the bitch smelled faintly like a diaper and had a personality to match. 

&gt;Has no idea why it’s allowed on the couch

&gt;Her beady little eyes immediately lock on me like I'm a fresh extra-large pizza with all the works. I can see her eyes glaze over.

&gt;Then she sees Carol. Tons of fun here has the hots for me since the beginning and is very displeased that I brought beautiful eye candy that can hold a conversation that doesn’t involve food or about how fat she is. 
Ohgod.jpg

&gt;‘Who the hell she?’ Jabba asks in the shittiest tone possible. 

&gt;Head exploding glares are exchanged between Carol and Paula

&gt;‘This is Carol’ I reply calmly but the beast can smell my fear like it’s a new bakery 10 miles away

&gt; ‘Who said you could bring her?’  

&gt; ‘I did’ announces the host. This rustles her enormous jimmies even farther into oblivion

&gt;Whatever and just watch GoT

&gt;All is well in the Land of Oz until about half way through the second episode

&gt;The Omnomnomasaurus begins her whale calls about the same generic fat-shit blabber: “men heart mah curves! (despite never having a boyfriend) The female characters are anorexic! Fat mean healthy! Blah blah blah blah”.

yougettheidea.jpg

&gt;I was surprised she managed to keep it in that long

&gt;The beast tries to make it seem like the comments aren’t directed at Carol but we’re not stupid. If you’re going to talk shit about someone and you don’t want them to think you’re taking about them, don’t make smug little faces at them while you do it, dumbass

&gt;When she finally finishes whining about this, she finds something else. It’s time for her hourly feeding. 

&gt;It’s cool. Everyone else is hungry too

&gt;Everyone chips on for three large pizzas and even the colossus gives a contribution which was rare

&gt;We wait for the food to arrive and she complains the entire time about them not being fast enough. She started in right after the Host made the call 

&gt;She’s going to faint if they don’t hurry! 

mahbeetus.jpg

&gt;False Alarm. She brought a fucking keg’s worth of coke for herself and a filthy backpack filled to the brim with candy and junk. 

&gt;Never offered anything to anyone… no one was man enough to eat anything that came out of that backpack anyway

&gt;Despite her precious warchest, she soon tells the host he should demand the pizza to be free because it’s taking so long

&gt;Bitch, it’s been less than 20 minutes and the pizza is coming from across town. Patience motherfucker, get some

&gt;Pizza finally arrives and the beast inhales a whole one by itself before setting in on another. One slice was a bite and this is after eating nearly half her bag of “emergency goodies” as she called them. teehee

&gt;GoT stream fucks up so we take a break from watching to chit chat as we feast

&gt; Being the only hottie gal in the room, the guys immediately set in and give her the attention

&gt;Because Carol’s a badass, she keeps this attention

&gt;This angers the Giant to the breaking point. 

&gt;“Why the hell aren’t these guys being pulled into my field of gravity?!” she ponders to herself

&gt; “Do you have a boyfriend?” one asks 

&gt;“Nope” Carol replies. She’s a hot catlady and prefers singledom 

&gt;“No wonder! You’re soooo anorexic/don’t have curves/etc. Couldn’t even finish more than three slices! men want real women ” the beached whale announces. It’d finally been given a reason to attack Carol directly

&gt;“The fuck did you say to me!?” Carol roars like a mighty tiger 

&gt;Most people brush off her comments 

&gt;Everyone is visibly startled, especially Shamu

&gt;It takes her a few moments to calculate what happened before spitting out “I didn’t stutter you skinny little bitch!” 

&gt;Carol’s face is reddest I’ve ever seen on a human

&gt;No one had the balls to stand up to the beast before today

&gt;The colossal squid makes a few more shitty comments before a yelling match ensues between the two

&gt;The rest of us are just sitting in the background, unsure of what to do

&gt;Do we break it up? Do we watch? Let’s find out

&gt;The beast eventually maneuvers itself into a standing positions and the clash of the titans begins

&gt;Fat as Fatass waddles over to Carol like some creeping crud and backhands her hard enough to nearly knock her down

&gt;Ursula (sea witch from the little mermaid) then gets a shitty grin since she’s not expecting any retaliation. This kind of thing had happened before 

&gt;Carol. fucking. loses it

ohyoudunitnow.jpg

&gt;Before anyone knew it, Carol had that fat turd pinned to the floor and was wailing on the beast’s face like there was no fucking tomorrow. It was kind of like the scene when The Narrator beat the shit out of Angel Face in Fight Club

&gt;Carol does P90X so I know she’s doing damage 

&gt;We eventually snapback to reality and pull her off the bloodied creature. It took three of us to peel a 100lb girl out of this lard pile

&gt;She got what she finally deserved but we still felt sort of sorry for her

&gt;The dough girl sits up and is distraught but apparently didn’t learn anything. She immediately begins running her mouth again

&gt;Sympathy gone

&gt;At this point, holding Carol back was like holding back a rabid dire wolf and we were half tempted to let her go

&gt; “Get out and don’t come back” the host says to her. “or we’ll let her go at you again and we won’t pull her off this time”

&gt;Carol had become the ultimate weapon

&gt; Without protest, the beast left to lick her wounds in shame 

&gt;We never spoke to King Size again. I still see her occasionally on campus and it seems she managed to find a herd of her own kind 

&gt;Viva la freedom!

**TL;DR- fat bitch runs her mouth and gets the shit kicked out of her by someone not even half her size**

&gt; be me on my way to work this morning.

&gt; 6’4, 190lbs… healthy weight. when I'm not at work, I’m active and I eat right as well as drink lots of water

&gt; be 7:45 am and go through security at work, proceed to the elevators. get on as does one other guy, push my floor button and hear a shrill screeeeeeech… “hold them elevators” she says

&gt; I oblige but shouldn’t have *facepalm*

&gt; fast forward 30 seconds and she finally shuffles on with our grocery-store breakfast buffet “to-go” package in her hand.^(for the record, we have a lunch place open in our lobby as part of our building)

now, 30 seconds to walk from the end of the lobby to the other side of the building, OK… 30 seconds to move 13 feet to the damn elevator? you’ve got to be kidding me.

&gt; “whew! thanks for holding the elevator!”

&gt; as soon as the doors close, I smell it. a stink from a weekend of stewing in your own filth mixed with the sweat produced from building an entire cottage out of 8x8 [timberframing.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_framing) 

&gt; a rank look appears on my face and she pipes up… “woooo! who let one rip?” there are only three of us in the elevator and it sure as hell wasn’t me.

&gt; “I’m pretty sure that’s all you, ma’am.” I say as the black guy next to me snickers

&gt; the ride up 7 floors takes an eternity. each floor passes at an alarmingly slow speed, almost as if the elevator cars are actually being pulled up by one [Clydesdale]( http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/clydesdale/mare.jpg) with a broken back.

&gt; in the span of 7 floors, this white she-hulk managed to obliterate my senses, make me question humanity, and send the race war in the elevator car back to 1893 in southern Louisiana. 

&gt; “no, I’m pretty sure it was the black guy” as she points over her shoulder and does the whole directional head nod in his direction. “they all stink anyway”

&gt; dumbfounded me and the guy exchange looks as he shouts out “what the f**k did you just say?”

&gt; he pressed the button for the third floor so it dings and he gets off while mumbling under his breath something along the lines of “you stupid white c***” mixed with “fat white b**ch”

&gt; she turns to me and says “whats his problem? smells a whole lot better in here doesn’t it?”

&gt; I turn to her and simply say “no. no it doesn’t”

enter the beast

&gt; “are you saying that I SMELL? I am gonna file a complaint because you said I smell so bad. how DARE you?^devil-horns-appear

Fast forward about an hour…

&gt; as I'm writing the start to this FPS, I'm amazed at the *luck* I have with being fed these stories. then, I shit you not, I get an email from my HR person asking me what happened this morning.

&gt; fed up, I go off. tell her the whole story, CC the guy she racially offended in the elevator, clear it all up and now I play the waiting game… I will continue this story once it resolves itself.

Quell your russling jimmies, folks, I bring you a tale of thin privilege at it's finest. But bring some snacks we all have to keep our blood sugars up! This is the tale of Billyum Beetus a former flatmate, and hamplanet extraordinaire.

**Dramatis Personae**

The Spousatron - Muh husband in training - 6'0 170lbs maybe, ex ballet dancer

Moi - 5'8 - 137lbs - also trying not to be a hamplanets

The landlady - actually my best friend. Large woman, has actually lost genetic lottery with quite a few SERIOUS health complaints that make exercise difficult. She does what she can and is super awesome.

Billyum Beetus - 6'4 of solid 300lb+ beetus. A flatmate.

**The Story**


I know The Spouse-a-tron and Billyum Beetus from years ago. We were all members of my university's tabletop gaming society. But back when I first met them, Spouse-a-tron was actually maybe 30lbs lighter, and BB (Billyum Beetus) was maybe a 150lb rail.

Spouse-a-tron and I were looking for a flat and Landlady's parents who are property buyers had just finished fixing up a 3 bedroom number and were offering it at a super low rent price to us me being besties with Landlady, so we took it. But we wanted a flatmate to make rent extra super low.  So when Beetus mentioned he was looking for a new flat, we were excited because we knew Beetus, and we thought he was a pretty cool guy.

&gt;note: as will be discussed later, we know Beetus's former flatmates and they are super awesome people

&gt;be slightly confused why Beetus kept saying it was terrible to live there

&gt;should have been warning sign but benefit of the doubts, you don't really know someone until you live with them.

Beetus took forever sorting out a move out/in date, but we all finally moved in and all was great while we unpacked, ordered pizza, had some beers, set up the xbox on our big tv along one wall of the living room for the Netflix and a gaming night. Beetus had gone to the toilet while we got all this set up and had a strange look on his face when he saw we'd set up the tv with the sofa facing it. We ignore it, maybe post loo bowels were still settling.

&gt;Pizza arrives

&gt; had ordered 2 medium pizzas, thought this was enough for 3 people.

&gt;apparently not.

The Spouse-a-tron and I managed about 2/3 of a pizza between us, and think we'll leave the rest for leftovers for lunch tomorrow or something.

&gt;LAWLNOPE.jpeg

Beetus eats his whole pizza, and the rest of ours. And declares he's still hungry, he's heading to the chippie around the corner.

&gt;Fair enough, maybe he really wants the chips

&gt;we've both had days like that.

[[Side note, the Spouse-a-tron and I weren't engaged at this point, but we were pretty serious to the point that most people just assumed it was a matter of time and had trouble imagining one without the other]]

Ok back to Beetus. Beetus returns some 15 minutes later with chips, and a pizza crunch from the chippie.

Let me explain the Glaswegian concept of Pizza Crunch to you.

&gt;Be a whole 10-12"" Pizza

&gt;be deep fried in batter

&gt;be doused in vinegar and salt

&gt;be fucking delicious

&gt;be something in the vicinity of 2000 calories a slice.

&gt;be hangover food of the gods.

Love me some Pizza crunch, but I can usually only manage a quarter to a half of one.

&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/StjzO.gif) he devours a whole one, and a large portion of chips, And still scarfs down a whole Ben N Jerries tub of baked Alaska.

&gt;Be not judging. 

Well we put on the Netflix, watch some terribad movies, head to bed.

Next morning I woke up at 6 to the sound of roaring. I head downstairs to find Beetus had moved our couch to face the other wall, where he set up his equally massive tv and attached PC/PS3/Xbox.

&gt;Landlady and us had discussed we keep as few electronics in the front room as possible.

&gt;Live in ground floor condo in neighbourhood immediately next to council housing apartment blocks.

&gt;Council housing is given to people in need, also scummy neds.

&gt;We have the kind with scummy [NEDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_\(Scottish\))

&gt; our tv is fucking massive, it's difficult to manouvre through our windows or anything.

&gt;Backdoor is kept perpetually locked and curtains kept shut to obscure.

&gt;laptops hidden upstairs at night, etc.

Beetus is ignoring this memo because he wants HIS gaming set up downstairs. His tv moniter is also massive so it's kind of distracting when it's pretty much perpendicular to the big tv.

&gt;we have skybox set up to our tv fyi

I also discover Beetus has come down to cram as many gaming hours as possible, and is playing JRPGs at 6am because GOTTA GET THOSE GAMINGS IN. He's eating bacon rashers off a plate with nothing else, and dipping them in brown sauce.

&gt;Brown sauce is made of brown, tomatoes and vinegar.

&gt;delicious brown sauce.

My half asleep brain finally processes that he's sitting in a bathrobe that goes to his mid thigh, and sitting with his legs apart. 

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/CRACRU2.gif) I realise that's not just leg fat

""Beetus, I thought we discussed not having your tv etc in the front room""

**""I REDECIDED. YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE MY STUFF DOWN HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF MY GAMING RIG.""**

""No, You can have it all upstairs, I don't care, not even my xbox is going to stay down here because I was going to keep it upstairs attached to our bedroom TV. We are literally just going to have the skybox and the tv down here.""

**""Just because the landlady is your friend doesn't mean you get to make the rules""**

&gt;actually part of our rent agreement is that I am landlady's representative in the house

&gt;I make sure guidelines and rules in tenancy agreement get followed.

&gt;It's why our rent is so fucking cheap

&gt;distracting because when Beetus talks, his meat and veg jiggle like jello. Impossible not to see.

I don't want a fight I head upstairs. Asking could he please just turn it down as it is 6 am.

&gt;Get back in bed

&gt;Tell the Spouse-a-tron what transpired

&gt;resume half asleep cuddles

At a more reasonable hour we go to the shops and get groceries for the place. Spouse-a-tron and I are on budget so we get healthy foods.

Beetus says he will get his food at his work because he gets a discount. Beetus brings home a month's worth of frozen family platters.

&gt;eats 3 a night

&gt;still has room to eat all of our ice cream and drink all of our pepsi.

&gt;drinks all my special lactose free ""derp milk""

&gt;Derp milk is expensive yo.

Every morning was the same. At 6am or earlier, he'd be up, stomping about and playing really bad JRPGs.

&gt;&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/SVeiptk.jpg) every damn morning.

And every damn evening he'd eat all our food.

One day I'm making dinner for everyone.

&gt;healthy pork stir fry

&gt;homemade marinade

&gt;lots of veggies

&gt;rice noodles

&gt;I am a fucking boss when it comes to stir fry.

Beetus is watching Spouse-a-tron play Bioshock in other room. I hear their converstion.

**""Ugh I feel so overweight. How do you deal with being overweight?""**

&gt;Spouse-a-tron is maybe 170lbs at max.

&gt;Also has way more patience, lets comment slide.

""If I feel too pudgy, I go running a few times a week, I've also got my pull up bar, and I try to cut back on portion sizes. I'm going running tomorrow morning, want to come with?""

**""Oh I can't run. I have bad knees and asthma.""**

""You should ask chesZilla about the asthma and knees, she's got it pretty bad and has some tips and tricks to make exercising easier.""

**""Like I would ask her, have you seen the size of her lately?""**

&gt;[MFW](http://replygif.net/i/101.gif)

&gt;I know I've gained a bit of weight since being out of work,

&gt;be really self conscious about it.

&gt;be 150lbs max, not hamplanet status.

""No really, it's worth asking, you know she used to do ballet and swim, maybe she'll take you swimming with her sometime?""

**""Nah man, chicks don't understand my exercise needs. I have *conditions* and they don't get it. *She* can't help.""**

&gt;jesustakethewheel.exe

That weekend we text Beetus saying ""we're going to have couple movie night, feel free to join us for movies.""

&gt;Couple -&gt; implying we'd be makin out on couch.

Beetus doesn't respond.

&gt;make small roast lamb for dinner.

&gt;it's delicious.

&gt;planned so leftovers are our lunch tomorrow.

&gt;Beetus gets home from work about 15 minutes into the movie.

&gt;It's Treasure Planet, we've seen it before. Love this movie.

&gt; hadn't put leftovers away yet because romantic cuddle times

&gt;Beetus's first action is to take a plate out of the cupboard and scoop all the leftovers onto it and inhale it.

&gt;without even asking.

&gt;[OFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/I_has_a_sad.gif) it was enough for us to have lunch for the next 2 days.

&gt;Beetus sits down on the couch next to us still inhaling food.

&gt;Takes up 1/2 the couch on his own.

&gt;Still wearing sweaty work clothes.

&gt;Reeks like he hasn't bathed in weeks.

**""OH HEY TREASURE PLANET? YEAH I SUPPOSE IT'S AN OK MOVIE, IT'S JUST SO IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH.""**

&gt;starts pointing out all the flaws in it.

&gt;gets bored of pointing out flaws, isn't getting laughs like he feels he should.

&gt;Turns on his TV next to us, and starts playing PS3 while we're watching the movie, had the lights out and everything.

&gt;doesn't even use headphones.

Spouse-a-tron being way more patient than I, gives me a look that says ""calm down, I'll handle this.""

""Hey, Beetus, we're watching the movie, can you please use headphones?""

Beetus don't care.

**""But it's such a shitty movie, besides I am almost done beating this game.""**

""Beetus, we've been told you earlier about this movie night, if you want to play your games, can you please take it upstairs? You're being kind of disruptive""

**""But I want to watch the movie too.""**

&gt;captainPicard.facepalm

&gt;Pause the movie and just stare at him.

**""Hey Put it back on, I was watching that.""**

We pack up the DVD and take it upstairs to continue the movie night uninterrupted in our room. Beetus is unhappy. Spouse-a-tron goes to put away leftovers, sees path of destruction Beetus has left.

""Dude not cool, that was our lunch for the next two days.""

**""Well it didn't have your name on it, you can't invite me to your movie night and not feed me, I have a blood sugar problem you know. My asthma means it's super low and I have to keep eating to keep it up.""**

&gt;I don't even

&gt;jackiechan.mindblown

Beetus throws a huge hissy fit about how we're so insensitive to his medical needs. Doesn't replace food, keeps telling us we OWE him.

Part duex to follow as this is a long one.

**TL;DR**

Fatty moves in, turns out to be total dickhead, eats all our food without asking, costs us a bundle in groceries, doesn't bathe, blames it on ASTHMA, calls me a fatty and because I'm female I apparently know nothing about anything.

1376172465.0	1k40r0	Thin Privilege is having your coworkers actually believe you're pregnant.	rbs14k	818	186	90	"While reading a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1k2786/women_and_burgers_first/cbkpjmr) in another [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1k2786/women_and_burgers_first/) I remembered this crappy little tale (I apologize in advance for my ramblings) from a few years ago when I worked with an aspiring hamplanet. No greentext for you since I suck at it and the story isn't very good anyway so let's not make it worse.

I worked with a woman years ago that on top of being a compulsive liar was also 5'4 and in the neighborhood of 280 lbs (163 cm, 127 kg) and a self proclaimed food addict (always said with a ^teehee as if that infantile giggle made a 3,000+ calorie per day diet acceptable). 

This idiot managed to find another, far more stupid hamplanet (6'2"", ~350 lbs/188 cm, 158 kg) to not only marry her but impregnate her as well.

She couldn't be anymore elated at the prospect of being married to a 30-something year old waiter, nearly 10 years her senior, earning less than $20k a year; Who's only saving graces were the kind of dopey love usually ~~pr~~offered only by labrador puppies and children with an extra chromosome, as well as a generous discount from his employer who if memory serves was McCallister's, Panera or some other faux-artisanal sandwich shop.

The plodding gentle giant had but 2 loves in life – his hamplanet princess and stuffing said planet's gullet (amongst other things^teehee ).

So after several months of this woman's constant 'white lies' including:

- ""My grandmother is German and used to take me back to germany with her for Oktoberfest"" - She had never been out of the country, didn't have a passport and IIRC her grandmother had died a few years after she was born.

- ""I used to be fluent in Spanish but I lost it"" - Her father was a 2nd or 3rd generation Mexican-American that was far from fluent and didn't use the language at home. She would constantly 'flaunt"" her ""Mexicanness"" around the office and attempt to badger our customers with butchered Spanish, often resulting in offended Spanish speakers yelling at her in English.

- ""All of the male and lesbian customers keep staring at my breasts"" - Bitch, you're 5'4"" tall and you have a **42F** bust - Everyone has to look down to speak to you therefore everyone is unintentionally looking in the general direction of your cleavage. It's not on purpose and it damn sure isn't lust. It's because you eat Peanut M&amp;M's and drink Dr. Beetus like they're going out of style and you're easily 20% [titty](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gxt5e/series_curvasaur_and_anthroplodicus_shop_for/).

- ""My parents gave me the middle name _____ because ^blahbahblahblah ..."" - Her parents didn't giver her a middle name so she made one up when she took her husbands name. She then made up an ever changing backstory about the historical significance and how it had been passed down from generation to generation of malfunctioning thyroid ridden Aztec warrior queen.

But I digress.

*Ahem.* So after several months of her white lies, she pops up with a new plan to get attention. She proceeds to visit the desk of every single employee left unattended and announces to them that she's pregnant and scared to tell anyone (Why? You're married. That's generally the socially accepted time to have babies), and then promptly swears them to secrecy. She pulls a similar feat with our customers and vendors. Real professional, this one.

But alas, she was completely unaware that the dozen or so of us coworkers all hated her and she was frequently the subject of water cooler talk (read: ridicule) whenever she was out of earshot and sometimes, not even then. It took a whopping 30 minutes for everyone to figure out that she'd done this to all of us.

We of course figured that this was another attention grab and excuse to eat all of the things.

At this point she was already chewing^teehee through at least $15 in food a day just for lunch on top of the meals her planetmate dropped off every so often. Once she found out she was pregnant that figure no less than tripled. God only knows what she was eating for dinner and snacks at home.

She would show up with a bag of McBeetus or Beetus-Fil-A in hand in the morning and then promptly duck out an hour or 2 later to run to the gas station for snacks. Then would come lunch, typically dinner portions from Pei Weigh, Applebeetus, Outfat Steakhouse, etc. Then would come a delivery from her beau, typically some sort of large sandwich smothered in gravy with chips and a side of something that had at one point been a vegetable but was now drowning in processed cheese and the hopes and dreams of some forlorn cardiologist. The rest of the workday would be spent discussing what she was going to pick up for dinner on the way home.

It didn't help that her roly poly figure was already so engulfed with adipose tissue that even after she was well into her 2nd trimester half of the office still thought she was faking it. There was even a betting pool circulating as to whether or not she would actually give birth or fake a miscarriage for even more attention.

This resulted in frequent temper tantrums not unlike those of a 2 year old whenever we failed to accommodate the pregnant swamp rhino in our midst. Things like failure to offer her one of the few breakroom seats the minute she entered, or not asking if she wanted something from the nearby restaurants, Target or Starbeetus while taking a break, were taken as personal slights. We were often accused of what could be called ""pregnant shaming"" in retrospect and being disrespectful of her 'conditions'.

But of course any attempts at having her grab you a Monster from the gas station or pick up a second lunch order were met with huffs of contempt and a hurried waddle to leave before a retort could be shouted.

As luck would have it though *she actually was pregnant*. Some eight and a half months of drama later she gave birth to a 10 lb son and gave him some super androgynous yet super feminine name that combined with his impending childhood obesity, was *virtually guaranteed* to get his ass beaten on a daily basis through the entirety of junior high and high school. I believe it was something like ""Ainsley Adaire [LAST NAME]"" or the like. Apparently 'Steven' or 'Christopher' or 'Michael' weren't good enough for her precious bundle of beetus.

She proceeded to disappear on 2 months of maternity leave, frequently popping up to do that always (un)pleasant ""HOLD MY BABY"" awkward thrust into some unsuspecting male coworkers hand. She came back to work only to start constantly complaining that she no longer had any money (I'm sure a $50/day fast food habit had nothing to do with that). Her poor husband had valiantly reduced his already meager hours to become a partial stay at home dad so that she could continue work and school full time. Her way of paying him back was to come to work and bad mouth him for not being able to buy her the new car he'd promised when they first married. You married a waiter. At a sandwich shop. What were you expecting?

Eventually we got a new General Manager who spent a whole 2 weeks in the office before deciding he wanted her gone. He began looking for another branch office to unload her and luckily for him, it was around the time she and her husband decided to move in with his parents to help raise babyham an hour away. He could start working full time again, they'd save on rent and grandma could provide live-in care for piglet.

That gave them both a legitimate reason to dump her and just like that she was gone forever.

**TL;DR:** Hamplanet coworker is so fat we couldn't tell she was pregnant until she actually brought the little bastard into work.

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention the cast! The first 2 months I was there she was wearing a cast on one leg. Due to her general clumsiness she fell in the parking lot and fractured her foot. Rumor had it it was taking abnormally long to heal because her weight had caused pre-existing stress fractures, her diet wasn't providing the proper nutrients and she had poor circulation in her feet."	t5_2vzax	True

FPS, we need to have a serious talk, one that's going to either save this subreddit from plunging into an abyss of shallow shit or let it slip in. We need to come together as a community and fix the issues we face swiftly, with or without mods.

This subreddit was designed to house Fat People Stories, both in 4chan and text post form. But lately, I've been noticing more and more karma whores jump in and post some random fat shaming that literally has nothing to do with the purpose of this subreddit other than the victim is fat. 

Look at the front page right now. We've got a post about a comedian making fun of fatties, a newsstory of a fatty, and some tumblr bullshit that belongs in /r/TumblrInAction and most certainly not here, because it is **not** a story, it's just some random junk about fatties. And you guys are upvoting this!

Please, by all means, hate fatty. But stop encouraging posts that are **not** an FPS. The sidebar strictly says we aren't trying to single out fatties, but instead share our hilarious tales of fatties bein' fat.

1372615136.0	1hdi42	Melted ice cream with Oreos in it? That's a snack.	spoontwo	757	133	142	"BACKSTORY

In my first year of University, I chose to live in student halls. These are basic apartments, 5 bedrooms, 1 small kitchen and bathroom between us. Students are assigned rooms at random, so there's a good chance of being put with at least one awesome person.


I was put with three nice, normal people and Fat Oreo. Fat Oreo was around 5' 10"" and the wrong side of 250lbs with a dollop of fat logic on the side. From the outset, he was an obnoxious, arrogant sod. He rarely showered too.


When we moved in, his mother was with him too. Fairly normal, most students got their parents to help with their cars. However, he stood in the middle of his room eating an entire packet of Custard Creams ordering his mother where he wanted stuff. Weird huh...


On the first night out to get to know each other, he appeared from his room in filthy jogging bottoms and a grease-stained T-shirt 3 sizes too big. The sort of thing most people sleep in...no, this is what he was going out in. He then brought along a Rubik's Cube to ""attract women with his superior intellect"", in his words. Needless to say, the smell of unwashed armpit and rotting food did the opposite. On the way home, he claimed he could lift 300lbs and was stronger than any of us. We sort of laughed it off in a polite British sort of way...


Snacks. Oh god did he snack. Frequently he would leave out a 2 litre tub of ice cream to melt in the kitchen and empty 2 packets of crushed Oreos into it. He'd then smother the lot in chocolate sauce and chow down, saying it was a healthy low-carb snack. Despite his claims that he used to work in a restaurant as head chef, his meals were epic in terms of calories and size. I'm talking half a bag of oven chips covered in 1lb of cheese, served with a heap of chicken nuggets mixed with mayonaisse. Another creation was a large pizza, topped with chips, cheese, and kebab meat, smothered in mayo.


Of course, what goes in comes out the other end. Violently, in this case. The apartment walls were thin, and his excretions sounded like a Harley starting up in a mud puddle. Not only did he use a roll of paper per poop and refuse to buy any more, he shat all up the toilet seat and on the tank. We confronted him but he refused to do it...until one day I caught him using a kitchen dishcloth to scrub his pebble-dashed leavings off.


After the first couple of months of the rest of us drinking and eating more than usual, we'd gained a couple of pounds. Fat Oreo had gained enough that he broke the wooden frame of our sofa. We were drunkenly giving each other shit for it, as guys do, when Fat Oreo butted in:

ME: fat shit...etc...etc...

FO: Yeah, you guys have got fat! You've got to eat right. (bear in mind he's topless and holding a tub of oreocream on his gut)

...

ME, trying to joke: You've put on a few too, must be all that ice cream!

FO: NO NO NO! (wagging his finger at me)

FO: I've been eating to gain muscle. In fact, I've put on 40lb in the past two months. It's that protein you see.

Awesome Stoner: Nah man. Pretty sure it's fat.

FO: I could have any of you in a fight.

AS (who's pretty scrawny): Not doubting that. Just saying I think you've got fat.

FO: Fuck you all. *stomps off to his room*


Since we were all pretty drunk and giving each other shit for putting on weight, it was a bit surreal.


He didn't appear much until room inspections. Ours all passed without a problem, but when the inspector opened Fat Oreo's door...oh god, oh god. Piles of pizza boxes in the corner, shit stained underwear stuck to the floor, rotting unwashedness wherever you could see. The piece de resistance was a wet shart...*against the wall* by his bed. He had obviously slept next to this and not bothered to clean it off.


After that, he was evicted. Mommy came in and cleaned his room so he'd get the deposit back while he sat on the remains of the sofa, eating."	t5_2vzax	True

I'd like to say that I killed Ginger right at that moment. I'd like to say that I beat the shit out of her, kicked her out of the apartment while she was half-naked, and set all her things on fire while laughing maniacally. But this was real life, and real life was not so exciting or gratifying. Also, Ginger weighed two hundred pounds more than me, and she could have pummeled me in a fight if I ever tried to deck her.

Eric did have to physically hold me back from hurling myself at Ginger after she'd thrown the USB flash drive (a little 4GB stick, just to clarify) at me. He kept saying, ""I don't want you to get arrested. I don't want you to get arrested."" I'm not a petite girl by any means, but just like I'm not match for the alabaster pale, redheaded 400 pounds of terror standing in her Hello Kitty underwear in front of me, I was also easily held back by the 6 foot Nord. He dragged me away from Ginger- who I don't think was aware of how capable she was of annihilating me and was screaming in fear about how I was going to kill her- dragged me downstairs, and forced me into his car. Eric drove me to a nearby diner, trying to calm me down. It was only a little past 5am on a Sunday morning, so the diner was basically empty. I'd only slept four hours, and Eric had barely come home from his shift stocking overnight at a department store so he hadn't slept at all. But he let me rant to him about all the ways I fantasized about killing Ginger and cry on his shoulder a bit while he force-fed me bacon and eggs. Eric probably saved me from going to jail that day, and I'll forever owe him for it.

We went over my more realistic options. We could have called the police, but both Eric and I doubted that it would do any good to tell them that, ""Hey, my roommate stole something from me, but she gave it back in a really bitchy manner."" My paper was done already. I wouldn't have been taken seriously if I tried to report it.

I reckoned that Facebook would take it down if I reported it. Eric didn't know anything about the bed picture of me and Luke being seen by all my family and friends, so I had to explain it to him. I told him that Luke had uploaded the picture of me and him because that was what I thought happened at the time. It wasn't Luke, but I didn't know that yet. I have to give Eric props for this. He reacted with the proper amount of outrage for my behalf, waited for me to finish eating, and we drove home. I was only going to pick up stop just long enough to pick up some clothes and yell at Ginger at some more. I didn't want to stay home, so I was just going to go stay with a friend for a few days to cool down and regroup.

Ginger is nowhere to be seen when we get home, which is a relief, but then again the house was still a fucking mess. I just grit my teeth, report the photo to Facebook real fast, and start packing. When I finish I go to find Eric to say goodbye and good luck staying here with just Ginger and him home, but I can't find him. Eric is not in the house. I didn't hear the garage door opening, so he can't have gone far... After a moment, I realize where he went. I run next door and sure enough, Eric and Luke are engaged in fisticuffs in Luke's living room. Ginger is sitting on the couch watching, happy as a clam. She's actually fucking eating a pie there. Not a slice of pie, not one of those Wal-mart 30 cent mini-pies, a full-sized apple crumble pie right out of the pan. She was leaving crumbs all over Luke's couch. Ginger cheerfully informs me that Eric just came over, her pure valiant knight, to defend her honor.

&gt;""Eric came over and punched Luke in the face because of me!""

She thinks they're fighting over her. The delusion actually hurts, but there's more important things to do here. Me and one of Luke's friends who stayed the night managed to pull them apart. Luke is raging, but weirdly it wasn't directed at Eric. He's howling at Ginger to get the fuck out of his house.

&gt;""We're not dating! You were just a drunk fuck, you stupid fat cunt!""

Ginger cries at first. Then she gets angry and says Luke was a dick and a manwhore and she gave him her precious virginity, HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO HER? She cries again and storms out. Luke turns to Eric then and they nearly start fighting again. Eric and I confront him about the Facebook photo, but Luke doesn't know anything. He's not lying, he genuinely does not know what the hell we're talking about. Luke then says he remembers Ginger playing around with his phone before he passed out. So it was Ginger who uploaded the photo.

Eric muttered a half-hearted apology to Luke. Luke told him to go fuck himself. Then he started begging us and his friend who was there to not tell anyone what happened. Because he didn't want to be known as a guy who banged fat chicks. I'm not even listening, I'm so angry. A little before seven o'clock in the morning now. When we leave Luke's house, Eric helps me find where he'd stashed Ginger's parents phone number. I was going to wait until it was later in the day to call them about it, but now? Bitch was going down.

Last night, I got to do the close shift. This is from 5pm until 2.30pm the next day. It's a bit of a shitter up until 10pm when we kick the customers out from upstairs and get some peace and quiet. 

We see a lot of people, and a wide range of customer. Usually, it runs like this:
5pm to about 8pm: Families with kids. It's the school holidays up here in Scotland and the UK as a whole, so man, there's a lot of them.
8pm til 11pm: Teenagers. Lots of screaming, annoying, bratty teens.
11pm til 2am: Drunk people. Drunk people everywhere.

So, I was working downstairs, herding customers into lines (yes, it's a thing, customers are generally too stupid to queue and will just merge into one long line like a bunch of idiots, then complain it's taking a while to get served).

I see a woman come in with one of those oversized strollers for children that can't walk. In it is a young boy, about 10, with what I guess is cerebral palsy. He's aware of his surroundings and verbal though (and quite the chatterbox too - chatting away to his Mum, and other customers. In short, a sweet kid).

In follows what I guess is his sister. Older I'd say. About 4 feet tall and the same round. She's out of breath, red in the face, and waddles rather than walks. 

The Mum looks harassed as hell, so I find her a seat (two lovely people move so they can sit on the ground floor) take her money and place her order, return her change with a receipt and ask if I can do anything to help.

She replies that she just needs to pop outside, so could I keep an eye on the kids for her. I reply that it's no trouble at all, as someone from front will bring over her food, and I'm at a loose end anyways.

Off she goes out the store for some quiet to talk. The daughter goes to the bathroom.

I grab a seat and chat to the wee boy. He's adorable - making jokes, asking why I work there, do I like it, what I do. I chat with him about school - turns out he's super smart and is doing science classes above his age. He tells me he likes the red-head from Mythbusters and we have a giggle over that.

His sister comes back and starts to slap him. Like, sitting next to him and slapping him on the face and legs. I'm shocked, I don't know what to say. The daughter sees the look on my face, and says ""you can tell my Mum if you like. She won't believe you"".

Mum comes back as the food arrives, so I leave them to it.  Her phone rings again, and she goes outside to answer it. As she does so, I see mini-porklets pudgy wee paw shoot out and steal *all the food* of her brother's tray.

She wolfs it down in a few seconds. The Mum comes back, notices and asks what happened. The boy tells her, so the Mum sighs and buys him some more food. No telling her daughter off, nothing like that, just replaces the food and buys the daughter a dessert.

Bear in mind that the daughter is sitting there with an XL EVM (an *adult sized meal* and a large frappe), *plus* her brothers food...

They finish eating, so Mum and daughter go to the bathroom. As I'm cleaning their stuff away, the boy says ""it's okay, it's part of my plan"". I ask what that plan is.

He replies ""that she'll carry on eating like this and die in the next 5 years or so"". I'm genuinely shocked, and I guess it shows, but I tell him that he's a sweet kid and obviously smart, and that I'm sorry he has to feel that way.


They leave, the daughter waddling behind them. 

I'm not sure what it was about this that so rustled my jimmies. Maybe you needed to see it,so I apologise if it's not up the the usual standard of stuff found on here. I think it was the Mums attitude towards the daughter stealing food? That she just put up with it and allowed it *and* bought her kid more food as well.

It's locally owned; my boss is the owner and she's a very nice lady, having helped my through some hard times with emotionally support. She is just an awesome lady.

Said card shop sells Christmas ornaments. We had the premiere today and it goes on tomorrow as well.

My boss, being a nice lady, generous to customers, went out per premiere tradition and bought all sorts of snacks for the customers coming today to get their ornaments: mini-muffins, mini-brownies, little cookies, triscuts, wheat thins, mini nilla wafers, etc. Then she made up a few of the Wind and Willow dips that we sell, four kinds in all: key lime, bacon &amp;amp; cheese, cucumber, and spicy pepper-something or other. My boss set up enough snacks for around 200 people, the amount we were expecting to go through before 3pm. We opened at 8am today. This story takes place at around 2:45pm.

We at the store are enjoying the bountiful business, especially since we make around ten times the normal income as we would on a regular weekend. Between restocking ornaments, cards and the snacks, it's a good day to be working.

Suddenly, we hear the distinctive wheezing, huffing and puffing sound that separates a hamplant from the rest of the easy-breathing, stress-free walking humans at the store.

The fatpack consisted of four women: an older lady (herein called Grandmother), ~60, her daughter (named Mother), 40 or so, and what must have been her two daughters (referred to henceforth as Granddaughters 1 &amp;amp; 2), around ages 10 and 14, I guessed.

They came clomping into the store, moving in that waddling, side-to-side gait that we all wince upon seeing. Granddaughter#2, spots the snack table, and with an inarticulate cry of delight, oozes over to grab a plate. Granddaughter #1 tugs at Mother's sleeve and says she's going over to the snacks. 

Mother's head turns so fast it was shocking to see that her head did not dangle limply from her body as she collapsed like a puppet, neck broken. I suppose her protective layer of fat spared her that mercy.

Mother trundles over to the table, leaving Grandmother at the register to pick up her pre-ordered bag of ornaments. Once Grandmother paid for her ornaments, she joined her offspring at the snack table. 

The fatpack then wandered around the store for around half an hour, circulating back to the snack table every minute or so to load up their plates with snacks. I swear I saw a little old lady (our normal cliental) drop dead from being denied the sustenance that the snack table would have provided.

Eventually, Mother and Grandmother decide it's time to leave.

""Well,"" Mother says, ""it's time to get out of here. I'm going to have to stop snacking or ill ruin my appetite for lunch!""

Grandmother laughs and Granddaughters 1 &amp; 2 roll themselves to the table to gather the last of the snacks onto their plates before they waddle after Mother and Grandmother.
Boss heads to the table to straighten the snacks up. You see, my job for later in the night (around 9 o'clock pm) was to pack up the snack table and put all the leftover food in bags and boxes that Boss left under the table. 

It would seem I was able to do this task around six hours earlier than expected. Boss comes back to where I am standing by the register counter and beckons me over to her. I head over, thinking she wants me to refill the coffee or lemonade.

""That family that just left ate *all* the refreshments,"" she says in a low voice.

I gape at her. ""What? All of it?""

She nods and I walk over to the table. Sure enough, the dip bowls are scraped clean, the contents of the baskets of crackers reduced to crumbs, plates of mini-treats empty but for one little mini-muffin all by itself, spared by some divine intervention.

I am dumbfounded, having helped prepare and set up the food the night before (leaving it in packages, of course; we just put it all on the table where it was supposed to go). Boss asks me to clean up the table, still wearing a shocked expression.

With a resigned sigh, I begin to clean up the knives, spreaders, spoons, plates, baskets, bowls and plastic utensils. I am just stacking it all onto this shitty cart thing we have so I can take it to the back room and wash it all when I hear it.

The distinct wheezing, huffing and puffing, grunting and groaning sound of an obese human pulling air into its tortured lungs is approaching. The table is set up right by the door. I look up to see Mother, alone, beady eyes swiveling around shiftily, perhaps for signs of Grandmother or Granddaughters 1 &amp; 2. She approaches the table and gasps.

""Oh no!"" She says. ""What happened to all the food?!""

My jaw drops. It hits the floor, smashed through the carpeted linoleum, through the cinderblock, through the crust of the earth, through its asthenosphere, into the mantle, where it promptly is burned to a crisp (I am currently seeking a jaw donor). 

This woman and her fatty kids demolished the food table ad now she's actually asking *where it all went?*

Boss steps in and saves me from putting my stupid foot in my stupid mouth, which would get my stupid ass fired. 

""We've had such a busy day,"" she says, ""and so many people have come in for the premiere, I guess that we didn't have enough food to last the whole day.""

It's a reasonable excuse, I think as I wheel the piece-of-shit cart to the back room, wheeling wavering wildly and squeaking like a mattress in a brothel. On my way to the back room, however, Mother decides that I am simply headed to get more food, since I am obviously the bringer of nourishment for the XXXXL denomination of shoppers.
She catches me, huffing and puffing, just as I am about to go into the back room.

""Do you keep the extra food back here, then?""she asks me.

I try to stay calm, I really do, but fatties irritate me to no end. I don't doubt that this is due to two things: one, that most of my family members are partial hammies (not quite hamplanets yet, but most certainly not fit), and two, that I myself am, in fact, a former hamplanet.

""Ma'am,"" I say, deciding to stick to the story that Boss told, ""we don't have any extra food. We had a rush of customers this morning and they ate up all the food.""

Mother looks so depressed for a second that I almost feel bad for her. *Almost.*

""Oh, all right,"" she says, giving up surprisingly easily. ""I mean, if you're sure there aren't any extras...""

And then, with both of my hands on the Holy Bible, I swear to you that she reached over my, onto the cart, and snatched up that one solo mini-muffin. She stuffed it into her mouth like she was Christian Bale with those worms in *Rescue Dawn.* 

""See?"" Mother says, crumbs spraying from her mouth, ""there's always more if you know where to look!""

I bid her good day, and take the cart into the back. And that, friends, is the story of how four people at enough food for 200 people in just under half an hour. 

TL;DR Fatpack eats food meant for 200 people at a shop's event, and then ask for more."	t5_2vzax	True
1371971566.0	1gwd8g	Porky Princess gets a job	Governer_Marley	735	111	112	"So I have a hundred shitty stories about this ambling land mammal I used to live with. She came rolling from the US into my country after meeting her stoner boyfriend over WoW. Plan was for her to find a job and lose weight - she actually had us all convinced that she was on this life improvement journey. I guess no one told her you have to apply for jobs before you get one, and make changes to your lifestyle before you lose weight. Bitch spent 24 hours a day stinking up the house with her whale musk and pot odour. Didn't lift a goddamn finger to help around the house, perhaps the thought of burning a calorie was too new and terrifying. But I digress. 

Her bf who was not fat, just a sucker with no self esteem, worked in a factory full time to keep her weed supply, WoW subscription and bacon stash from expiring. One day his boss is approaching tax time and asks him ""is your gf switched on, can she do admin stuff?"" And suddenly pork princess has a short-term job sitting at a desk picking up papers and scanning them (in the same room).

She comes home after one day writhing and wailing about her ""back"" and her ""carpel tunnel"" and is convinced that if she just had a better chair - not just any chair but the boss' chair - she wouldn't be under so much torture. Pork Princess is used to everyone around her enabling her shitty behaviour, lapping up her lies and excuses, and having daddy come to the rescue. She's genuinely convinced that if she asks boss to swap chairs, he will gladly do it.

I'm listening to this laughing my tits off. Fucking can't wait to see how the real world deals with her delusions.

Next day she asks the boss if she can have his executive chair because he ""doesn't use it that much"" and ""walking to the scanner is giving me carpel tunnel AIDS and IBS"" - naturally the bizarre, entitled request is refused. Boss probably starting to regret taking an employee's word in hiring this American grease lump. 

She doesn't take the rejection well and retaliates by going to the toilet with ""back pain"" and lying on the floor for a few hours until someone notices. She's hoping it'll demonstrate how badly she needs the chair. Boss looks down at pressed floor ham and says ""um, can you work? OK no, um you'd better go home"" 

And that's the story of how an American heifer got fired after two days from the easiest job in Australian factory history because she was jealous of a chair"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;be sitting in with spinal surgeon.

&gt;be disgusted by every fat whale that squeezes sideways through the door.

&gt;we laugh at them when they leave the room to make ourselves feel better, but in reality we are both pretty upset by just how fucked their health is.

&gt;last patient of the morning arrives and we walk in to the consulting room.

&gt;both stop in awe.

&gt;plankton nemesis sitting before us.

&gt;largest person i've ever seen.

&gt;somehow chair sustaining her bodyweight.

&gt;her forehead is fat.

&gt;her forehead is literally hanging down over her brow because of the fat deposits in the skin of her forehead.

&gt;not physically possible.

&gt;deathly silence for a few seconds.

&gt;doctor asks her how much she weighs - she doesn't know.

&gt;doctor asks how tall she is - she doesn't know.

&gt;doctor asks her to stand up so we can measure her height - she can't stand up.

&gt;doctor asks how she got into the room and onto the chair - she doesn't know.

&gt;how the fuck DID she get into the room and on the chair?! i can't see a scooter or walking frame or anything in the room - we don't know.

&gt;accept magic is real and move on.

&gt;after a couple of questions she stops answering and breathing becomes a real issue.

&gt;don't know what her problem is. don't know why she's here. don't know how we can help/if we can help. don't know how she levitated onto the chair. don't know her BMI. don't know if she will fit/break the MRI machine. just don't know.

&gt;she motions towards her side.

&gt;""i think she's trying to communicate with us...""

&gt;see pocket wedged under her boob, she can't reach it with her own hand.

&gt;doctor tells me to reach into her pocket and see what is inside.

&gt;reach into moomoo pocket - greasy cavern of filth inside.

&gt;retract hand.

&gt;she gurgles at me and motions to pocket again.

&gt;slowly put hand back inside her pocket and find small piece of paper.

&gt;phone number scrawled on it.

&gt;""geoooorrrblurghblurghblurghge"" she gurgles.

&gt;call number.

&gt;george answers.

&gt;george is her husband.

&gt;george is outside in the van.

&gt;george tells us he drove her in the back of a work van because she can't fit in seats.

&gt;tell george to come up and help explain what is happening.

&gt;george says he wants to talk over the phone.

&gt;tell george it would be easier if he just came up in person.

&gt;george says no.

&gt;ask george why he won't come up.

&gt;george mumbles a reply.

&gt;ask george to repeat himself.

&gt;silence

&gt;george?

&gt;george says he is still in the van.

&gt;tell george to get out of the van and come up to speak with us.

&gt;george says he can't.

&gt;ask george why he can't get out of the van.

&gt;george admits he is stuck in the van and can't get out.

...

&gt;fucking george...

&gt;listen to george explain what is happening (she has a sore back).

&gt;tell george and woman that we need to weigh her first, because in the unlikely event she is fit for surgery the anaesthetist will need to know how much shit to give her.

&gt;tell george we also need to do an MRI because the x-ray wasn't conclusive.

&gt;go outside room. consultant worried about MRI machine. Costs millions. Doesn't think she will fit.

&gt;i go back inside room to weigh lady.

&gt;she's not there.

&gt;where da fuck?! she truly is a magician!

&gt;find her outside room lying on floor.

&gt;nurses about to code blue.

&gt;try to get her up, but can't.

&gt;consultant says go to lunch.

So I went to lunch. Then...

&gt;when i get back: hamplanet is missing. no longer on floor.

&gt;ask doctor.

&gt;doctor says they tried to weigh her, but the scale only went up to 300kg (660 pounds) so they contacted a horse stud 30 minutes out of town and were going to weigh her there.

&gt;can't fit in ambulance. huge issues. finally squeeze her in a special ambulance.

&gt;finally arrive.

&gt;can't get onto horse scales so they borrow a forklift from local business.

&gt;forklift her onto scales.

&gt;360kg (800pounds) http://i.imgur.com/GoI705d.gif

&gt;back to hospital.

&gt;MRI machine one of largest in the southern hemisphere.

&gt;try to wedge her into MRI machine.

&gt;won't fit.

&gt;lube her up - still won't fit.

&gt;get a rope.

&gt;tie rope around her belly.

&gt;tie her onto the plate that retracts into the MRI machine.

&gt;spend 45 minutes getting more ropes and bundling her together into a roughly spherical shape.

&gt;lube her up with over a litre of lube.

&gt;try to fit her into machine.

&gt;still won't fit.

&gt;call in more doctors.

&gt;doctors try to engineer a better solution.

&gt;one doctor has smart idea of making her shaped more like a semi-circle so some of the fat rolls can fit underneath the patient plate.

&gt;also makes ropes in middle very tight to push fat towards her legs/head.

&gt;patient begins to have breathing problems.

&gt;stop.

&gt;push all fat towards legs and away from chest.

&gt;try to fit her in MRI one last time.

&gt;she fits with some of her belly fat resting inferior to her shoes.

&gt;do MRI.

&gt;look at clock - it's home time already! hi-5 the doctor and walk outside.

&gt;see white van parked in handicapped space.

&gt;see gigantic man wedged up against steering wheel.

Near where I live there’s a wetland bird conservation area with a little café, footpath, and nature trail. The story takes place outside the café. 

I'm sitting on a bench with my dog, over looking the calming scenery of lake and birds, eating some [good old-fashioned-British chips](http://www.rnw.nl/data/files/imagecache/must_carry/images/lead/british-chips-650.jpg) ^(truly the food of the gods).
Dog thinks chips are rubbish and I should have got a steak.
Never mind dog it’s your dinnertime when we get home.

.

Hear screams in the distance

Insects fly away

Birds fly away

Delicious chips fly away

You know what time it is!

.

“YUH NOT FEEDING YUH DOG ENOUGH!”

The ham had a spherical appearance ^(ofc), was wearing a matching fleece grey track suit ^(Chav-tastic), short grey hair, and, most weirdly, grey skin. The overall effect was that the moon had come to earth on a day trip.

Slightly terrified but ever hopeful, I take the tact that since they’re so loud, round and grey chances are the women is not all there and just doesn’t understand.

“Oh no, don’t worry, you see-”

“I CAN SEE ITS RIBS”

“Yes, because-“

“IT’S SHAMEFUL. YEH OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED. IT’S DOG ABUSE!”

“No she’s supposed to look like that because-”

“YEH I BET YUH GOT IT ON ONE OF THEM DIETS YOU SKINNY PEOPLE LIKE. THEY DON’T WORK YOU KNOW!”

“She eats a lot but she doesn’t-“

“DON’T MAKE EXCUSES YOU’RE A DOG ABUSER AND SHOULDN’T HAVE A DOG- LOOK IT’S AFRAID!”

At this point dog was cowering under the bench ^(because loud noises) as would I be if I thought it would do any good- the fear of being eaten and simultaneously crushed in the gravity well was causing a seriously beta response from me

“She’s afraid of you!”

“DON’T BE SILLY”

It was at this point the moon made the fatal error which allowed our escape- she reached down to a terrified dog.

Dog went crazy, with a fury of a thousand suns leapt out from under the bench, snarling, barking, growling, teeth bared- the moon toppled backwards but caught itself on it’s stubs ^(I think they were once legs) and I pulled back on the leash with all my weight to prevent a law suit

“LOOK! IT’S SO HUNGRY IT TRIED TO EAT ME!”

All of my what

There's no reasoning with this

Dog and me stomp off home- leaving the moon to do whatever moons do on holiday.

I noticed [this](http://redd.it/1ffhl2) post yesterday and have seen a number of comments looking for a collection of stories and figured that it might be a good idea to consolidate a large number of them into one place. Below I have created a list of many of the series that we have seen over the past few months for your convenience.

Each series has a minimum of two stories regarding the same person / circumstance. If you notice any spelling mistakes, broken links, or if you find a popular series that I missed, please let me know. Each title is either the exact same or a close equivalent of the author’s original title. I waded through over 500 submissions so if I missed any then they were beyond that.

Each series is in descending chronological order. In no particular order, please enjoy!

I'm not a cruel mistress.  I would not leave my poor piglets alone too long after the last terrible story of jimmie-rustling sour pudding.  Here is part 5, where Feeder returns and tries his very best to get revenge upon me.

&gt; Been about a week.

&gt; Saggy knows Feeder and I broke up because of her.

&gt; Triumphant grease rains down from the ceiling. 

&gt; I am in physical pain I am so annoyed.

&gt; Eating dinner in my room and doing some math homework when I hear her syrupy TEE-HEEs from the living room. 

&gt; She's being purposefully loud.

&gt; Somethin's up.

&gt; I'm not takin the bait.

Honestly in the back of my mind I was pretty sure I knew what was about to happen.

&gt; Avoid the front room as long as possible.

&gt; Run to put up dishes and grab water.

&gt; Yup, Feeder is there, glaring at me.

&gt; Saggy is there, and the moment she sees me she glomps onto Feeder and starts making out with him.

&gt; Notsurprised.gif

&gt; You can have him.  Not interested in rapists.

&gt; Show zero emotion because I honestly didn't care.  They were both being pathetic and immature.

&gt; Place my dishes in the washer and grab my water.

&gt; After I'd gotten back to my room, I hear a knocking on the door.

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks, can we talk?"" says Feeder from the other side.

&gt; I lock my door.

&gt; ""Nope, not interested in talking Feeder.  You're a creep and I don't want anything to do with you.""

&gt; Saggy is whining on the other side of the door for him to come back to her room for some drinks and *loooooove*.

&gt; **VOMIT.MP3**

**A Few Hours Later**

&gt; Yea, I got to hear the kiddie-pool paddle slapping again.

&gt; They were definitely drunk.

&gt; Ignore.exe

&gt; Doing my maths while they're in the kitchen.

&gt; Suddenly I can hear them fighting.  

&gt; [DIS GON BE GUD](http://i.imgur.com/Yk3iJvn.gif)

&gt; Straining to hear all the yelling and what's being said.  Catch my name, whore, slut, skinny, faggot.

&gt; All of a sudden I hear Saggy yell ""Ow stop,"" and ""you're hurting me!""

Now FPS, I may have hated Saggy, but I hate men who hurt wemenz even more.  From now you've probably gathered that I was an art student.  Well art students are required to have certain materials for their classes. [Like a 36 inch metal ruler](http://www.hardwarestore.com/irwin-aluminum-straight-edge-131527.aspx).  

&gt; I grab that thing FPS.

&gt; I grab it and stomp down that hall.

&gt; I see Feeder yelling at Saggy and he's grabbing her arm flab and shaking her arm.  She's crying and trying to pull away.

&gt; Dis boy is clearly drunk and deranged.

&gt; I unleash the power of Odin with my metal ruler, smacking him all over, beating him on the back, arms, face, and yelling all the new profanities I'd learned over the past two months.

&gt; **""YOU DON'T FUCKING HIT WOMEN YOU FUCKING PISS GUZZLING PERVERTED TURD!  GET OUT OF MY HOUSE GET OUT GET OUT GET THE FUCK OUT I WILL KILL YOU IF YOU EVER COME BACK YOU FUCKING ANIMAL GET OUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""**

&gt; Swinging at him the entire time, I back him into the front door, open it, and shove him out.  

If he hadn't been wasted that scene probably would have turned out VERY differently.

&gt; Turn back to Saggy.

&gt; Her mascara is running all over her face.

&gt; ""YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT SAGGY-SUCKS!  I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!  JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF MY BODY AND UPSET THAT YOUR TREE-BRANCH BODY CAN'T HOLD ONTO A MAN DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN BEAT MINE UP ONCE HE CHOOSES ME!""

&gt; She lumbers away and slams her door.

&gt; I grab the bottle of vodka on the table, mix it with ~~some~~ a gratuitous amount of juice (because I was still a noob at life), and start to chug.

**TL;DR: FEEDER GETS HIS ASS WHOOPED BY YOURS TRUELY.  PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE POLICE INSTEAD.**

1367187150.0	1dap6v	Retail Whale: The Average Lunch	VizaMotherFucker	817	204	194	"[The Training: Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d45so/retail_whale_the_training_part_1/)

[The Training: Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d6l4z/retail_whale_the_training_part_2/)

The store I work at provides you with an hour lunch anytime you work longer than 7 hours. I generally finish my lunch about 10-15 minutes through the hour and just relax. I take what I consider to be normal lunch-y things, such as leftovers or a sandwich and some sides (fruit, yogurt, etc).

RW and I rarely have lunch at the same time, as we both work in the same position in the store. There have, however, been a few occasions when I have seen her grazing on more than just swarms of krill.


The lunches she ""brings"" from home usually consists of frozen dinners. Two Hungry Man meals, three cups of microwave mac and cheese, two family size bags of potato chips, and two boxes of Little Debbies.

She generally will have another bag of chips and box of Little Debbies for her snack during the course of the day, and generally uses one of her breaks to go and buy more food from the Italian place across the street.

Sometimes I have an issue where I speak before my brain realizes it's a bad idea, generally in situations where I feel shocked or scared.

The lunches where she eats out are the worst. 


&gt; Walkin' into work, mentally prepped to face the day

&gt; Enter break room to put up coat and purse

&gt; Whale song from the break room, ohgodwhy

&gt; RW ""Haaaaaaaaaay Viza! You coming into work?""

&gt; ""Hey RW. Yeah. How's it going?""

&gt; ""Oh just on lunch break! I wish restaurants would make bigger portions. I never feel I'm getting enough food for my money.""

&gt; Until this point I had just been trying to get my shit put away and GTFO, but curiosity got the better of me

&gt; Two large empty pizza boxes

&gt; Two large calzone boxes

&gt; Two giant ass hamburger boxes

&gt; Large order of cheese fries currently being snacked upon (nearly done though, teehee)

&gt; This is where my brain decided to take a vacation

&gt; Blurt out ""Oh my god, did you really eat all of that? How are you still hungry?!""

&gt; Immediately realize what I said and feel like a dick

&gt; Get ready to apologize, but RW just laughs

&gt; RW ""I told you, I've always been big! It takes a lot of food to keep a figure like this looking so good!""

&gt; The lip-smacky noises of her sucking the last globules of cheese off her fingers is enough to make me feel sick

&gt; RW ""What did you bring for lunch today?!""

&gt; ""Oh... nothing special. Sandwich, yogurt, an apple and a little bit of salad we had left over.""

&gt; RW ""You can't survive off that! Your body is going to start eating your muscles! Not eating enough is *really* bad for you. Especially working at a job where you have to stand up 99% of the time on concrete floors, you've got to have good muscles!""

By this point, I had worked with this woman for perhaps four months. Every time the subject of food came up, I got a lecture to eat more. Nothing I said deterred her from this, and eventually I just gave the fuck up.

I had also learned, at this point, that there is not a single, solitary employee in the entire store that enjoys this woman's company. *Everyone* hates her.

&gt; ""I eat enough to feel full, I don't need to eat more than that.""

&gt; RW ""Oh no, honey! You're doing it WRONG. Just because your body THINKS it's full doesn't mean it is! You need to eat so much you feel like you're in pain. That's your stomach growing! Then the next time you eat a big meal, it won't hurt so bad!""

&gt; I'm pretty sure she's trying to talk me into becoming morbidly obese

&gt; There are no words that she will understand

&gt; I speak people, not whale

&gt; Effort long since abandoned, close locker

&gt; ""I gotta go clock in. See ya later.""

About 2 hours into my shift, RW lets me know she's going on break.

&gt;RW returns with two 12 inch subs

&gt; RW sings one of her favorite songs

&gt; RW ""I looooooooove chicken bacon ranch subs. They even gave me extra ranch on the side for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee""

She has them fill up one of the soup cups with ranch. I'm pretty sure they give them to her for free because she's the reason the store is still open. She's paying your salary, give that bitch as much ranch as she wants!

Later on toward the end of her shift, she disappeared for about twenty minutes (not using the bathroom, shockingly). She came back up to the desk and loaded up the counter with cookies, chips, and candy. Piles and piles of it.

Ring up all this shit.

&gt; ""Stocking up the pantry, eh?""

&gt; RW ""Oh, no. This is just snacks before dinner.""

I honestly don't know why I asked her that. I should've expected it. I have long since given up on trying to speak to this woman about anything - including things that are work related (because she never does them anyway).

I've been reading stories like a fiend ever since I started reading a week ago! I've got a brand-spankin-new throwaway just so I can tell the hilarious story of my former hamplanet roommate: Saggy. If I get any formatting wrong or do something wrong let me know, I'm still kinda a FPS noob.

&gt; be me 5 years ago about to be a Freshman in college, 5'8, 135 lbs, 18 years. I've always been a curvy girl, even when I was thinner. 

&gt; don't be my university, who doesn't have nearly enough room for all the freshman in the dorms and must shove them into sketchy apartment buildings around campus.

&gt; I'm super excited, never been so independent. Went to a private high school with a graduating class of 38 kids.

&gt; IMGONNAMEETSOMANYPEOPLE!

&gt; IMGONNAHAVEALLTHEFRIENDS!

&gt; I get my roommate assignments. 

&gt; find both girls on FB. 

&gt; Dramagirl (named thus because she had the hilarious tendency to be super dramatic about everything) seems cool and looks a lot like my little sis, tells me she smokes pot. I'm still a naiive girly with no experience with drugs, so I tell her to please will you smoke it outside or away from our apartment? Cause I don't want to get arrested and kicked out of school lol. She agrees, says she already talked to other roommie and she smokes too.

&gt; Oh lordy these heathens! What shall I do??? 

&gt; Find other roommie on FB, she looks cute as well, and says she's an interior designer. 

&gt; ""Hey! We have common ground!"" I say. ""My mom just happens to be a very successful interior designer and just happens to own her own business!""

&gt; Other girly seems impressed and can't wait to meet my mom on move-in day, because she's already started furnishing the apartment and making everything look amazing! I bring up the pot rules, she agrees.

**Fast-forward to move-in day**

&gt; I let myself into my new ground floor apartment, excited to meet my new roomies and see what's been done to the place to make it homey.

&gt; I am greeted with a horrible sight.

I won't go into all the things she did wrong, but let's just say this: my nine year old sister could design an interior better than she could. Neon colors everywhere...clashing and awful, cheap coverlets over broken couches and chairs, fake flowers over her tv and in the kitchen with horrendous Hawaiian colors that did NOT match the neon color pallete she chose and paintings of neon colors in ""straight"" lines that looked like a four year old painted them in her pre-K class. Guys, I am exaggerating VERY slightly. It was god-fucking-aweful.

&gt; Mom and I observe the room in horror.

&gt; thisisasinagainstnature.gif

&gt; Look down at the rickety old couch and beheld the horror

&gt; a boulder of Pilsbury Doughboys had decided to merge into their ultimate form

&gt; the boulder turned

&gt; mother weeps, knowing her child is lost and will almost certainly be eaten

&gt; a baby in the next apartment over starts to cry as this otherworldly mound of halitosis and pig slop turns to us and locks eyes with me.

&gt; look away in terror and notice a large tub of country crock butter in her lap

&gt; WITH A LARGE SPOON IN IT

&gt; I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

&gt; SHE WAS FUCKING EATING THE FAKE BUTTER STRAIGHT

&gt; my mother and I snap out of our terror coma and greet the blob. 

&gt; with enormous effort, she stands up to hug us

&gt; she was about 350 lbs and 5'5""

&gt; her boobs just kinda...swing down

&gt; and fall

&gt; and fall

&gt; they reach her belly button

&gt; I am glomped

&gt; her finger nails are bright, sequined, and about three inches long

&gt; they tear into my flesh and I start to bleed out

&gt; Saggy asks us if we like what she's done with the place

&gt; we mumble non-commitedly

&gt; ~~little~~ big miss doesn't like not getting the slew of compliments she was expecting

&gt; fishing for compliments engaged

&gt; mom does not give compliments if they are not deserved

&gt; Saggy uses pout

&gt; returns to her butter and watching her cartoons

&gt; I escape to the back of the apartment where I meet my other roommate and we immediately give each other a look that says ""oh God what is that thing sitting on the couch do we have to live with it???"" 

&gt; didwejustbecomebestfriends.gif

I move my stuff in, parents leave, tears were shed

Next day

First dinner in my new apartment! I'm such a grown-up, yay! I'm gonna cook some of the fancy stuff mom bought me at the grocery store to celebrate.

Nuthinlikeparent-boughtgroceries.allthegoodstuff

I knew I was on a strict budget from now on, so I was gonna make the nice stuff mom had gotten me last as long as possible. One of the few perishable things I got was some salmon fillets. I figured cooking a meal for me and the roomies would be a good way to bond.

&gt; I knock on both my roommates' doors and tell them my plan. Both are exited about home-cooked salmon!

&gt; Go to the freezer to pull out the salmon.

&gt; Saggy had basically stuffed the entire freezer with frozen chicken nuggets, fries, frozen dinners, and frozen pizzas until there was barely enough room to shove my salmon and some chicken breasts I'd gotten.

&gt; Open the freezer

&gt; Almost half the stuff that had been in the freezer yesterday was gone.

&gt; holycrapwherediditallgo?

&gt; did she already eat ALL OF THAT FOOD? 

&gt; naiive little me could not compute

&gt; shake off the shock and look around for the salmon

&gt; salmon.404 NOT FOUND

&gt; chicken is also missing

&gt; Where'd my stuff go?

&gt; Go to Saggy and ask where most of the food in the freezer went and where's the salmon and chicken I had in there?

&gt; Saggy looks smug

&gt; ""You must've put it in my side of the freezer. I probably ate it on accident when I cooked dinner last night because I thought it was mine. Tee-Hee! Whoops! Hope you learned your lesson!""

&gt; I am flabbergasted

&gt; the injustice!!!!

&gt; ERROR ERROR, CANNOT COMPUTE

&gt; ""Saggy, you had the entire freezer full of stuff, you can't take every square inch and claim all the food within it!"" I say, not understanding that reason is beyond this creature. If she had been reasonable, she wouldn't have stolen my food.

&gt; There's PLENTY of room in the freezer Saggy-Sucks, just look! We discussed this yesterday, I get the middle shelves in the cabinet so I don't have to bend down, and I get the bottom two shelves in the freezer since most of my stuff is frozen. I got to the apartment first so I get pick!

&gt; I literally had no idea how to react to this. I had never been so shocked and appalled in my life. I yelled about now no one gets dinner because she ate all of it and to next time ask me to make sure it wasn't her food, then stomped back to my room. 

Dramagirl was pissed at the lost salmon dinner and yelled ""Thanks a lot fat-ass!"" 

&gt; We hear a Tee-Hee from the living room.

&gt;Bus is full of people commuting, lots of people standing already and only halfway through route. Friend and I managed to get those tiny fold-down seats at the front. 

&gt;Suddenly... Bus sinks several inches closer to the ground. Suspension groans! 

&gt;Potholes? 

&gt;Be a small planet climbing onto bus. 

&gt;Be an *impatient* small planet, shoving other boarders and people standing in aisle aside and out of her way. Gets to first row of seats. Stands easily, not struggling to stay upright. Other passengers try to lean out of way because the Planet *is* struggling to deodorize. 

&gt;Bus pulls away. Passengers holding their breath. Strained silence. 

&gt;Tutting noise. 

&gt;Being Britain, everyone politely looks aside. Windows be interesting. 

&gt;TUT TUT noise. 

&gt;Few eyes flick upwards. Friend and I look up to see that Planet is trying to make eye contact with us. 

&gt;oshit.

&gt;Planet announces to bus ""You know, you're the most *horrible* girls. It's so *rude* not to give up your seat to people who *need* it."" She smiles greasily round the bus. No approval is forthcoming. She nods like someone was cheering her on. ""Your mums must not have brought you up properly. You should know better. I want to sit down."" 

&gt;Friend and I glance at each other. 

&gt;Friend looks up and smiles at a sweet looking old lady who, up until now, had been hidden and shoved back towards the luggage holders by the Planet's gravity. 

&gt;""Oh, I'm so sorry."" Friend says in a genuine voice. Planet looks victorious until friend gestures for old lady to take her seat. ""I didn't see you there. Would you like to sit down?"" 

&gt;Smattering of giggles. 

&gt;Planet goes bright red. 

&gt;Planet gets off at next stop. 

TL/DR: Woman insults us on a bus to tell us we were rude for not giving her our seats, my awesome friend hits back by giving the seat to someone who genuinely needs it. "	t5_2vzax	True

I got so many people saying they like the stories and I have nothing to do on the Fourth because of all the rain, so I'm feeding you guys some more sugary FPS since it's a holiday and calories don't count on holidays!!!

&gt; Been in school for about a month and a half at this point.

&gt; Starting to meet people in classes.

&gt; One guy always sits behind me in Biology class, chatting with me and looking at what I'm doing on my computer.

&gt; He starts taking a liking to me.

&gt; Just had bad breakup with 3 year high school sweetheart, so I'm a bit vulnerable.

&gt; After about 2 weeks of school, We start to date.

&gt; Can anyone say **REBOUND???**

&gt; Cause that's what this was.

&gt; He was really sweet, always taking me out to his favorite restaurants (he grew up in the area), bringing me treats and sweets, and studying for Bio with me.

&gt; Start to notice he's encouraging me to eat more than I want.

&gt; One might even say he's *pushy* about it.

&gt; Tell him I don't want to eat at **Insert Fried Food Restaurant Name Here** anymore because I don't want to gain weight.

&gt; He says that's exactly why he takes me to these restaurants, and he would be really attracted to me if I gained more weight.

&gt; Me confused

&gt; Don't all guys like girls who are normal-sized and/or skinnier?  I do not lack in the boobs/butt department

&gt; He shows me the type of porn he likes

&gt; It's a chubster in just a bra and panties rubbing her stomach and eating a chocolate bar

&gt; **[EXCUSE ME WHAT](http://i.imgur.com/CZqzV.gif)**

&gt; Trying to be supportive and accepting, I tell him I don't want to gain any weight, I'm happy how I am, but I'll still try to make him happy however I can.

&gt; His name is now Feeder

&gt; Because that's what he was.

&gt; You can see where this is going.

&gt; Eventually get around to bringing him home for dinner.

&gt; Dem homecookedmeals

&gt; He had come over before for some night time rendezvous, but had missed Saggy.  Had told him briefly that she was a terror and being her roommate was a constant stress.  Did not go into any detail about her appearance.

&gt; Cooking dinner like a champ

&gt; In walks Saggy

&gt; ""Well well Saggy-Sucks, is this the boy you keep talkin about?""  Saggy says, throwing her stuff all over the living room as she parades through the front door.

&gt; ""He's got some purty eyes!"" she says, winking at him.

&gt; I wish I could say my boyfriend stayed true to me and could not look at any woman that wasn't his.

&gt; I wish I could tell you he was disgusted by this grotesque sin against all things beautiful and charming.

&gt; I wish I could tell you he didn't [stare at her with his mouth open and drooling](http://i.imgur.com/sdLxH4l.gif).

&gt; I wish I could tell you Saggy didn't shoot me the most gloriously triumphant look I'd ever seen as she ~~sauntered~~ waddled into her room.

&gt; But I can't.  Because dis shit happened.

&gt; [Ya'll's faces after reading this.](http://i.imgur.com/JkOzKst.gif)

&gt; **Glare at boyfriend mode engaged**

&gt; Boyfriend finally notices once Saggy is in her room.

&gt; Knows he's in trouble when he sees my face.

&gt; ""NO,"" is all I say, turning back to my cooking.  ""Anyone but her.""

**Fast-forward twenty minutes**

&gt; Saggy pops out of her room right as I'm dishing up our plates of delicious nutritious.

&gt; She's wearing booty shorts, a lime-green bra, a tank top that covers one covalent-bond's worth of her body, and a flaming red thong that has been pulled UP UP UP into the largest wedgie ever.

&gt; Satan himself would be proud.

&gt; ""What're ya'll cooookin?"" she says, putting her ginormous arms on the counter and squishing her boobs together right in front of my boyfriend's face.

&gt; ""It's healthy Saggy, you wouldn't like it,"" I say, shoving peas into my angry face.

&gt; Feeder is transfixed.

&gt; Saggy grabs the chicken I'd cooked for him, stares him down, and slowly starts to shove the entire fucking chicken breast into her mouth, chewing it as it slowly enters her face-cavern.

&gt; Feeder cannot look away.

&gt; [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/eBtrEVp.gif)

&gt; Take my plate to my room.

&gt; About 30 seconds or so later, Feeder comes into my room, looking apologetic.

&gt; ""Sorry,"" is all he can say.

&gt; ""We've been dating for a month.  I'm not that attached to you.  Get out and don't come back.  Don't talk or sit next to me in Biology.""

&gt; Wha wha WHAAAA?

&gt; Where did that come from self?  I think.

&gt; Boyfriend uses cry!

&gt; It's - *sigh* - super effective...

&gt; We have a picnic dinner in my bedroom followed by sexytimes.

**The Next Day**

&gt; Wake up, Feeder goes home, Saggy is looking mighty full of herself.

&gt; ""Seeeeeeee Saggy-Sucks?  I told you what men like.  I TRIED to tell you you were just a skinny bitch and people only fuck you to help your self-esteem, but would you listen to sweet ole' Saggy?  Noope.  Do you know how many guys I've attracted with these sweet thighs?""

&gt; Me pissed

&gt; ""Yes Saggy, the entire apartment complex.  In a month and a half.  Because you're the champion of whores.""

&gt; Stomp away as Saggy screeches after me about Feeder and that he's going to leave me for her because she's a real woman who knows how to please a man and won't stab him with her bones when they make love.

&gt; Don't really think this guy is worth this.

&gt; Break up with him the next day.

&gt; He cries again, tells me he's sorry and he shouldn't have let her get under his skin like that, and that it was disrespectful to me.  Yadda yadda yadda, I don't need a boyfriend this bad.  

&gt; He gets obstinate.

&gt; Uh oh....

&gt; Starts raging out.  Glad we're in a public place.

&gt; Whispers he's going to rape me so I realize what I'm trying to give up.

&gt; **OH HELL NOPE.**

&gt; Tell him he just crossed the line and that I don't ever want to see him ever again or I would call the cops.  

&gt; Literally run out of whatever food place we were at.

&gt; Go home and tell Dramagirl all the things.

&gt; She thinks I should've caused a scene so that he'd get beat up.

&gt; Hindsight is 20/20.

&gt; Saggy wins for now.

&gt; No more rebounds for me.

**TL;DR: I GET A FEEDER BOYFRIEND AND SAGGY IS TRIUMPHANT.**

My supervisor reported the story to the director, who found it hilarious, and the entire staff proceeded to make cracks at me for weeks. The story still is told to new hires.

Saggy got more money from her mommy, and soon the freezer was full once again.

We found out she got money because she paraded into the living room one day in a barely-there tank top (breast meat sagging to her belly button despite the valiant efforts of the straps) flashing her back folds at us.

&gt; ""Saggy how did you get a tattoo if you can barely afford all the food you eat?"" Dramagirl said, trying her best not to puke from the folded horror that was Saggy's half-finished rose with stars.

&gt; Saggy jiggled her rose around in glee.

&gt; ""I just wanted something for me since I never really treat myself to anything! I'll just make momma give me more money when I need food. She can't let me starve!""

&gt; Dramagirl and I are at a loss.

&gt; This selfish bitch is for real.

&gt; See later that day she has new acrylic nails with sparkles and neon colors.

&gt; ""Saggy those things are disgusting, how do you function?"" Dramagirl asked.

&gt; Saggy huffs and brandishes her claws, ""you're just ignorant about fashion Dramagirl, you wouldn't understand the sacrifices real ladies go through to be beautiful. Beauty is pain.""

&gt; ""I must be pretty fucking beautiful then, because the sight of those monster claws and your sag-tastic boob-flaps is pretty painful,"" Dramagirl said with an eye roll.

&gt; Saggy started screaming and thrashing about in anger, but I honestly have no idea what she was saying, because I was too horror struck with what she was doing with her nails: she was taking them across her chest, arms, and face, making little scratches (and her arm even bled a tiny bit).

&gt; She glared at Dramagirl with a conniving, triumphant look.

&gt; ""Look at all the scratches you left on me Dramagirl! I've been letting the apartment know about how insulting, cruel, manipulative, and VIOLENT you've been to me over the past few months. I told them you threw out my food and you've been threatening to hurt me constantly. Now I have proof that you did! I'm gonna go call the cops now. You better run for your fucking life, because it's over you bitch.

&gt; Oh my fucking God you have to be kidding me.

&gt; That conniving sphere beat us at our own game.

&gt; For once Dramagirl didn't have a quip as Saggy stomped to her room to call the police. She started shaking and crying and asking me ""what am I gonna do Saggy-Sucks?! I didn't do anything but insult her but she has scratches all over her and they're gonna believe her because she's been talking to the apartment people WHATAMIGONNADO????""

&gt; I grab her by the shoulders and shake her a little. ""Calm down, if you freak out they'll probably believe her more. Go get rid of all the pot in your room. RIGHT NOW,"" I say in a whisper.

&gt; Her eyes get wide. She hadn't even thought about the pot. 

&gt; She runs to her room and I wait for the police. Saggy joins me after a while, looking triumphant and disgusting.

&gt; After a while we hear a knock.

&gt; Saggy waddles forward, pushing me out of the way and answers the door.

&gt; ""We got a call about a domestic dispute?"" The two cops say, stepping in.

&gt; One of them asks me where Dramagirl is, the other stays and talks to Saggy.

&gt; Saggy puts on an act. Honestly if she wasn't so over-dramatic and obviously exaggerating, I think things would have gone much worse. 

She starts getting upset, her lip quivers, and she explains all the pain and trauma she's been through over the past few weeks. She starts to cry hysterically as she recounts all the sleepless nights she's had because Dramagirl's threats on her life have kept her ""so afraid for so long..."" She talks about how we both make fun of her for being fat and trying to give her an eating disorder through our abuse. How we've eaten all her food on multiple occasions and were always trying to fat-shame her. 

&gt; I'm just standing there, glaring and shaking my head.

&gt; The officer asks me if it's true, you can see he thinks Saggy is full of shit.

&gt; I calmly told him no, Dramagirl never made threats, never touched Saggy, we only make fun of her because pretty much everything she's accusing Dramagirl and me of is stuff SHE ACTUALLY DID, and she scratched herself. There was probably still skin underneath her talons (tee-hee, I actually said talons to the officer) and he should probably check so he realizes what a lier Saggy is.

&gt; Saggy looks smug and I swear to God there were little demons behind her shoulder mountains trumpeting a triumphant song for her.

&gt; She thrusts her claws into the po-po's face with a grin and says ""check if you like, my hands are clean.""

&gt; The bitch cleaned the evidence from underneath her fingernails.

&gt; I forgot all she did was watch TV all day, of course she probably watched tons of cop shows and knew to cover her tracks.

&gt; The second police officer and Dramagirl walk into the living room. Cop number two says he's got Dramagirl's statement, they would both be returning to sort things out and talking with the apartment complex, but for now is there somewhere Dramagirl can stay because they think it would be better if the two girls separated.

&gt; I panic.

&gt; ""Dramagirl can't stay here? That's not fair! Saggy's lying! I don't want to be here alone with her, SHE'S the one making all the threats!"" I plead.

&gt; They genuinely looked sorry...

&gt; ""Ma'am, this ~~landwhale~~ lady has testimony from the apartment complex that she's talked to them about these issues. We'll look into all of your testimonies, but for now our hands are tied.

&gt; Saggy is practically oozing joy as Dramagirl packs a bag really quick so she can stay with her boyfriend.

&gt; As Dramagirl is escorted out with the cops, Saggy locks eyes with her.

&gt; ""Take that you skinny twat,"" she says with butter foaming at her mouth.

&gt; Dramagirl could only hang her tear-streaked face in shame as the apartment door closed behind her.

**TL;DR: SAGGY WINS FOR NOW BY CALLING THE POLICE AND BEING A LYING SACK OF SHIT.""**

1366930109.0	1d45so	Retail Whale: The Training Part 1	VizaMotherFucker	801	202	97	"I have more stories of this woman than I care to admit to myself. I'll make them separate posts so I don't overload you with fury all at once.

Over a year ago, after being woefully unemployed for two years, I got a shitty retail Mart job. No fucks given, because holy shit, not working made me crazy and fat. Got up to at least 170+ lbs at 5'4. I tend to gain weight fairly evenly, so I really didn't look terrible.

My fifth day on the job was training for my Customer Service position (ie - Get yelled at by fatties all day erryday). Enter my trainer: The Retail Whale (RW for short).

This woman is about 5'11 and 450 lbs (For my other country people that's 180 cm, 205 kg, or 32 stone. Did I miss any? I can add more!) and absolutely unattractive. She has the worst teeth I have ever seen in person - Brown, gnarled with constant food bits stuck in them. Her hair is always a greasy, stringy mess. And I swear to any god you believe in she has a fucking beard.

She wears makeup that is more well suited to a clown than a human being and constantly has lipstick on her brown, nasty teeth. She also has the personality of a wet bag of leaves. She's pretty much just losing at life.

Onwards and upwards, friends.

&gt; New job fuck yeah!

&gt; Not sitting on my ass playing WoW all day fuck yeah!

&gt; Gonna train so fuckin' hard and be awesome at everything!

&gt; Habitually early for everything, at work 20 mins early, waiting for trainer to show up

&gt; Earthquake, birds silent, sun gone, etc. You know the drill.

&gt; Out of breath from the 50 ft walk to the parking lot

&gt; *Wheeze* ""Hey, I'm RW. You must be Viza!""

&gt; Slap on that fake smile and let's do this

&gt; ""Yeah! Nice to meet you. I look forward to working together.""

&gt; RW is sucking down a McD's sweet tea that is nearly the size of her head

&gt; RW: ""Just let me put my things up and I'll be right back.""

&gt; THIRTY FUCKING MINUTES LATER She finally shows up.

&gt; The woman we were to be relieving has been chatting with me during the interim

&gt; ""You're really going to have to keep RW in line tonight. Just try not to get too frustrated with her. She means well.""

&gt; New employee keeping 20+ year veteran in line? All my wat.

&gt; No time to explain as RW reemerges from the depths

The first hour or so was extremely uneventful. Went over basic computer functions, how to count money (lol), and various other tasks that we were to get done over the course of the day. Got dis shiz eyes closed!

&gt; Customer comes in for refund

&gt; No receipt, need ID

&gt; Typin' that shit in like a girl who has been on the computer for too many years

&gt; RW ""You type too fast because your fingers are too skinny.""

&gt; Try to laugh it off ""Haha, I took some typing classes in high school.""

&gt; RW ""Women don't need to learn how to type or do computer things. We just need to be pretty for our men.""

&gt; SOUTHERN LOGIC, not quite fat logic? Fuckin' close.

(Short aside - I am extremely nontraditional and I curse like a fucking sailor when not at work. That whole women in the kitchen thing is a bunch of bullshit. My husband cooks because he enjoys it. I burn everything and it upsets me to waste food. Continuing on!)

&gt; Finishing up transaction, smiley happy face, thank customer

&gt; ""Yeah, I don't cook. I'm not good at it. My boyfriend cooks for us because he enjoys it.""

&gt; RW looks startled

&gt; I glance around to see if there is a larger whale encroaching her territory or bag of doughnuts

&gt; All clear!

&gt; ""Oh honey, you'll never keep a man if you don't feed him! No wonder you're so skinny. You need to learn how to cook and keep your man satisfied. You'll never do that when you're all skin and bones. Men like it when women are soft and feminine!""

&gt; Before I could even respond she fucking pinched my side fat

&gt; You ever seen a really pissed off cat with its ears laid back? MFW

&gt; ""I don't like being touched. Please don't touch me.""

&gt; RW let's out a boisterous whaley laugh, ""You'll have to get over that if you want to keep a man, too!""

&gt; Straight up eye tics at this point

&gt; ""I don't mind it when people I like touch me, but I just met you and it makes me uncomfortable. Also, I'm trying to lose weight at this point so if you could stop telling me I need to put on some pounds it would be appreciated.""

&gt; RW looks like I just stole the last piece of her favorite cake

&gt; RW ""I need to go finish working on the schedule. You'll be okay by yourself for a little bit, right?""

&gt; ""Sure, I'll just call you if I need anything.""

At this point I do feel a little bad for being snappy at her. Just a little. That ended within the two hours that she left me alone. She was sitting (I shit you not) 10 ft away and could not be bothered to get up to come help me. ""Just call a manager."" The ""Schedule"" she was working on was a bag of powdered doughnuts that she bought before her shift.

In the two hour span that she was sitting on her fat ass, she ate the whole bag of doughnuts, finished her sweet tea, bought a two liter of Dr Pepper, finished that, bought TWO BOXES of Little Debbie cakes and finished those as well.

TL:DR - Grabby fatty all up in my business and weight. Hurt her feelings so she gorges herself on food for two hours.

Part Two will likely be posted tomorrow.

(Upon reflection, I can't tell if this is fat logic or southern logic. Or fat-southern-logic. It's all blurry line at this point. :( )

**For reference (or a key if you will);**

&gt;""AS"" - Housemate. Intolerant of PorkPlanet. Bad-ass. 

&gt;""KK"" - Housemate. Health &amp; Fitness goddess. Quiet and thoughtful. Also a redditor, told me to post stuff on here to begin with. 

&gt;""Cuteguy"" - Boyfriend. Hillarious. Bit of a Jackass to PorkPlanet for reasons. Here for the lelz. 


**There are other characters (other housemates, parents, Uni friends) but these feature heavily so these will be the only ones introduced for now in each chapter.** 

---------------------------


This story is from a couple of days ago when I returned home from being at my parents for a week with cuteguy, following surgery on my hand. I came home to find everyone was sick. PorkPlanet, KK, other housemates, everyone! They all had some kind of flu virus  and feeling a bit rundown. Since AS was the only one who managed to avoid it for whatever reason we decided one evening that we would cook a meal for ourselves, KK, and two other housemates. PorkPlanet is automatically never included in house meals because she never eats it anyway and always makes her own (gross) food, or orders takeaway. 

&gt; Be cooking food with AS

&gt; Yum yum, dat chicken, dat roast vegetables, dat couscous, dat salad.

&gt; Disgoinbeafeast.jpeg

&gt; Suddenly, pans on the cooker start to jump, utensils hanging from the cealing swaying side to side. 

&gt; isthisanearthquake.gif

&gt; No guys, it's Porkplanet entering the Kitchen! 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHUT CHU COOKENNNNNNN IT SMELLS DELICIOUS?!!1""

&gt; Me: ""Some chicken and veg in the oven, some couscous"".

&gt; Porkplanet scrunches her face up 

&gt; AS: ""Healthy food. Stuff that will make you feel better"".

&gt;  Porkplanet: ""So can I have some?"" 

&gt; [Our face when.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z9wj1i9MtOg/UXb7zlppUhI/AAAAAAAAuX0/4sBGsYMYR_Q/w500/Confused_Mr._shue.gif) 

&gt; AS: ""Thought you told me earlier you were going to get some Chinese food?""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I just don't feel well to drive.""

&gt; Me: ""Of course you can have some. I was gonna use the leftover chicken breast for my lunch tomorrow but you can have it. We'll let you know when it's ready"".

&gt; Porkplanet exits. 

&gt; AS: ""I don't think I've ever seen her eat a healthy meal like this in three years I've known her"". 

&gt; Me: ""Perhaps she's turning a corner?"" 

&gt; AS: (scoffs) ""She's just too lazy to get her own food. Or she's broke."".

&gt; Me: ""Let's just ignore and not make a big deal out of it and maybe she'll enjoy it. She'll put on a scene if she thinks we're making a big deal out of her eating healthy food"". 

20 minutes later. 

&gt; KK enters kitchen. Counts plates served up. 

&gt; KK: ""Ooooh, who else is eating with us?"" 

&gt; Me: ""Porkplanet!""

&gt; AS: ""Yeah, she's *turning a corner* according to imgonnamakeit"" 

&gt; KK: ""Fuck me. If she turns a corner too quickly and changes her eating habits, every Indian and Chinese takeaway in the area is going to go out of business"". 

&gt; [OFW KK](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsi8yhGVqG1qjwst6.gif) comes out with the funniest shit sometimes. 

Porkplanet and other housemates eventually enter. We all sit and eat. Everyone must be real sick still because we mostly eat in peace and quiet for 15 minutes. 

&gt; [AS's face when](http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l594/xCeeh/tumblr_llufhjpJSq1qf7rph.gif) PorkPlanet puts Regae Regae sauce with her chicken, Mayo and some Ketchup on her plate. 

&gt; Me: whispering to AS ""Just forget about the sauces. She's eating the food!""

&gt; We all finish. Clean up. Put our plates in the dishwasher. 

&gt; Porkplanet fishes £2 out of her purse. Puts it in the house food jar.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""That was very lovely. I'm full. Thank you"". She exits to her room. 

&gt; [OFW](http://images.wikia.com/glee/images/9/94/Oprah_shocked.gif) we're still in shock she ate healthy food without complaint or protest. 

*Sidenote: The food jar is where everyone pays/chips in for house meals. Usually about £1.50 each for whoever eats.*

Two hours later. 

&gt; Go to bathroom, exit and walk past porkplanets room. 

&gt; Hear giggling and rustling. 

&gt; Knock and pop my head in to see what she's up to. 

&gt; She's sat on the bed watching The Big Bang Theory. 

&gt; Me: ""Hey, did you enjoy dinner?""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Yes the chicken was lovely. I'm full!"". 

&gt; Me: ""Cool. We're probably gonna have something again tomorrow night. Maybe Salmon or Tuna Pasta.""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Ok I'll eat with you I'll pop some more money in the Jar tomorrow and help cook"". 

&gt; Go to sit on her bed. 

&gt; Me: ""You've changed your tune with food then?"" 

&gt; Porkplanet: Sigh ""Yeah. I'm just not feeling like takeaways and all the crap at the moment"". 

&gt; trynottopanicimgonnamakeit.rar

&gt; sheschangingherways.gif 

&gt; Me: ""That's good. I lost so much weight eating that stuff. It can become boring sometimes if you eat the same stuff so I try and change it up and cook different things with AS, but when you eat properly every night the takeaways once or twice a month become so much more enjoyable"". 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Yeah I can see how it would be, I think I'll give it a try for a little while. I can't afford all the shit food at the moment"". 

&gt; Me: ""Yeah, eating and cooking at home is soo much cheaper, too, and not buying crap to snack on. I eat crab sticks plain popcorn if I want a snack, I've saved so much money"". 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Really? I'll have to try it"".

&gt; omgshesfuckinggonnadoiticantwaittocomeandtellreddit.exe

&gt; Move up on her bed. Feel rustling under covers. 

&gt; Pull cover back.

&gt; The horror.

&gt; Find 3 chocolate wrapper bags, empty toffee popcorn bag, and empty bag of share-size crisps. 

&gt; Me: ""PORKPLANET!!!""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHUT I WAS HUNGRY AFTER DINNER"".

&gt; Me: ""YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE FULL"".

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WELL I AM NOW!!!"". 

She's never gonna make it.

So as the days went by, Dramagirl and I realized that Saggy was pretty much the biggest piece of white trash that ever oozed her way across the planet. She was loud, obnoxious, entitled, cussed at everyone for no reason, and was an ENORMOUS slut. Her man of choice? Scummy black guys - who happened to be in abundance at this particular apartment complex. Over the next year we were roommates, she apparently slept with every single black guy and almost every single other guy in our ENTIRE APARTMENT COMPLEX. Read: anyone that would have her. The girls in our apartment fucking hated her because she would sleep with their boyfriends. But this will all be expounded upon soon enough. For now, I shall tell you about her breaking the pot rule and my first run-in with one of her ""boyfriends.""

&gt; Be biking back from class (didn't have a car so I biked everywhere).

&gt; Roll up to my front door (ground floor like a boss)

&gt; Open front door

&gt; Confronted with pot funk and all the smog from Shanghai

&gt; **COUGH HACK WHEEZE MY POOR VIRGIN LUNGS I AM TOO INNOCENT FOR THIS**

&gt; Yellowstone National Park has erupted in my livingroom

&gt; Oh no wait, it's Saggy breaking yet another rule of common courtesy

&gt; ""Saggy! *cough* What are you doing smoking in the house? *hack* This is so not cool! You said you would smoke outside! *is that part of my lung?*

&gt; Notice she has a visitor. Hey, isn't that the 16 year old brother of the drugdealernextdoorohgodyesitis**PANIC**

&gt; ""Oh...hi...uhhhhhh......what's your name? I'm Saggy-Sucks."" *timid wave*

&gt; ""Dis is Dashante, he here chillin,"" Saggy said...suddenly with a ghetto voice.

&gt; ""Saggy, can I talk to you in the hall?""

&gt; ""I ain't movin,"" Saggy says and looks at me defiantly.

&gt; **GLARE ACTIVATED**

&gt; ""Saggy GET THIS SHIT OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFORE I GO TO THE DEAN. I don't care what you do as long as you don't do it in the same house as me. Jesus, it's FOGGY in here! This is ridiculous!""

&gt; I start swishing my hands around, opening the porch doors and trying to fan out the smoke while yelling all this.

&gt; ""Hey white girl, you need to chill the fuck out or we gonna have a problem,"" says Dashante.

&gt; White girl freezes.

&gt; There was only one black guy in her entire HIGH SCHOOL and he was a sweetheart.

&gt; White girl has no idea how to deal with thug drug-dealer brothers

&gt; White girl doesn't want to get shot, so she slinks back into her room to finish a project.

**THE NEXT DAY**

&gt; Saggy-Sucks is not liking this turn of events. She recognizes a power-play when she sees one. Time for some advice from the good ole' DEAN OF STUDENTS. Yes I am lame and I actually went to see the dean and tattle-tale.

&gt; Dean was actually a boss lady.

&gt; Told her my situation, how I didn't want to ruin my roomie's college career, but I wanted an authority figure to know my situation and to get some advice. 

&gt; Deanlady understands, tells me she's glad I came to see her and if it happens again I should come see her and/or call the po-po. She says I could be in a dangerous situation if what I said was true.

&gt; Take her advice to heart

&gt; I play the waiting game

**THAT NIGHT**

&gt; Ugh, Dashante is still here. Why can't he go watch Alladin somewhere else?

&gt; Wait

&gt; Wait

&gt; Is Saggy's hand on his crotch?

&gt; 0__________________0 ^yesitis

&gt; The beast strikes again

&gt; No thug be safe

&gt; Hear the sounds of their sweet sweet love-making that night

&gt; Either that or there was a kiddie pool on her bed and they were slapping the water with a paddle over and over while Dashante screamed **FUCK** over and over

&gt; Dramagirl and I are eating breakfast the next morning. We both got that farawaystare

&gt; The things we have seen...the noises we have heard...

&gt; Dramagirl: ""So Saggy fucked a 16 year old last night.""

&gt; Me: ""Yup. Heard every bit of it.""

&gt; She pats me on the shoulder

&gt; Dramagirl: ""You realize if you make a beef about this they're gonna shoot your fucking face?

&gt; Me: ""Yea probably. I'm just gonna ignore it. It's not like it affects me more than my sleep^andmysanity .""

&gt; Dramagirl: ""Sorry hun, you're getting the short end of the stick. I don't think I could do it. How does he even...find the right hole?""

&gt; I proceed to vomit until I die.

&gt; the end.

**YEA RIGHT I STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH SAGGY**

&gt; I may not say anything about her new boytoy^she'llprobablyjustmoveontoanewonenextweekanyways but I couldn't not talk about the pot inside the house.

&gt; Approach the beetuscave

This is a good time to tell you that I have a VERY poor sense of smell. I usually can only smell very distinct and vivid things like cinnamon, mint, pot, Axe, etc. Usually body odor is something I can't smell. I commonly can't tell the difference between a ""bad"" smell and a ""good"" smell. If Saggy had a funk, I couldn't tell ya. 

&gt; But oh lord jesus when I opened that door...

&gt; It was like a tsunami of sensation

&gt; My poor, inexperienced nose was confused for a few moments

&gt; What are these smells? Do not understand.

&gt; *loading.......loading......loading*

&gt; Ok brain does not like.....brain REALLY DOES NOT LIKE

&gt; While all this nose weirdness was going on, I'm observing the carnage that was her room...it was like she'd taken trash from every dirty place she'd ever visited, put it in 100 pinatas, and smashed all the pinatas in her room. There was garbage EVERYWHERE and - wait, are those my plates? And that's definitely one of my mom's nice cups she gave me with her company logo on it. Why is her room covered with my dishes? And HEY. THAT'S WHERE MY CEREAL WENT. Nope - empty. And those are the poptarts I never opened...forgot I even bought those. And the chips...and the nice crackers mom got me at the beginning of the year.....

&gt; I just kept looking. Every corner I looked in had something that belonged to me in it. Food, silverware, plates, and even some of the acrylic paint I had had to replace because I'd thought a fellow classmate had stolen it. I'd complained to the teacher and everything.

&gt; I gather my dishes and paints and bring them into the kitchen. Just a minute later, Saggy comes into the apartment.

&gt; You're cornered bitch

&gt; ""Saggy what the fuck is all of this?"" I say, gesturing to the things I'd spread out on the counter.

&gt; It looks like your dirty dishes. Don't fucking leave them in the sink for me to clean again, you're so dirty Saggy-Sucks.""

&gt; ""Saggy, ALL OF THIS WAS IN YOUR ROOM. YOU TOOK MY FOOD, MY DISHES, AND MY PAINT. I NEEDED THAT FOR A PROJECT AND YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE PEOPLE'S THINGS WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU FREAKING CLEAN **ANYTHING**???""

&gt; I take one of my kitchen knifes and lunge at Saggy as she's about to make an excuse about how she needs my food for her beetus and blood sugah. I scream my battle cry ""YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE YOU CRETINOUS CREAM PUFF"" and stab her multiple times in her saggy boobs as she cries and wails ""OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH MY LIFE I DESERVE THIS JUST PUNISHMENT."" She falls, bloody and ripped to the floor. The baby next door giggles because sweet justice has been served and all can now live in peace and harmony. A million whalesongs across the planet echo as the hamplanets of the earth disintegrate into dust and blow away, never to be seen or heard from again...

&gt; Yea right this is real life not our fantasies.

&gt; Saggy slams her keys down onto the table.

&gt; ""WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM?? I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING YOU SKINNY TWAT! DON'T YOU EVER TOUCH MY THINGS OR EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING INTO MY ROOM AGAIN OR I'LL HAVE YOU KICKED OUT OF THIS APARTMENT SO FAST IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN!""

&gt; I scream at her to keep her fat face away from my food as she stomps to her room, slams the door, and I hear the door lock with a tiny *click*. 

&gt; I open all of the cabinets with my things in them and move everything to my room: dishes, cups, cutlery, pots, pans, and of course, all my food. There was only healthy stuff in the fridge at the moment, so I left it there until I could get a fridge cage. I washed everything she had sullied and brought that back to my room as well.

&gt; Texted Dramagirl and told her what had happened and that I was gonna move her stuff to her room for her. 

&gt; Dramagirl agrees and thanks me whilst demanding the full story when she got home.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*I haven't written a FPS yet, so I'll write a little diddy right here.*

&gt;Be me 24 y.o woman, 5'8 130lbs on the train.

&gt;Sitting on a three seater next to the door. I'm at the outer edge. There's a guy on the other side, leaving the middle seat open.

&gt;Reading articles on my phone, generally looking unavailable to deter the crazies on the train.

&gt;The train stops at a station.

&gt;^boom.

&gt;Lights flicker and the train goes silent.

&gt;My confused gaze connects with the woman standing in front of me, carrying a yoga mat and a water bottle. Her eyebrows furrow and she looks around.

&gt;boom.

&gt;[Ripples in her water bottle.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lunt92GhbX1r6984go1_400.gif)

&gt; I clutch onto my bag and sink into my seat. 
&gt;[I don't want to die.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m62sa2wObN1rr9hor.gif)

&gt;**BOOM**

&gt;Large Fatron Collider stomps onto the train

&gt;A man on the other side of the train with a wheelie suitcase grabs his suitcase before it starts rolling towards the LFC due to the new slope created.

&gt; LFC looks in my direction. 
&gt;Sees open middle seat

&gt;Walks up and immediately lets his megaton ass fall down without looking.

&gt;Brace for impact.

&gt; Lands on me and and the guy on the other side. Sits on our laps and takes up half of our seats. LFC doesn't feel a thing.

&gt;[MFW](http://www.dvdizzy.com/images/l-o/127hours-07.jpg)

&gt; I try to free my leg to no avail. I try to come to terms with the fact that I may have to lose my leg. I'll tell people I lost it in the war.

&gt;**NO!** I can't give up the fight.

&gt;I struggle a little more.

&gt;At last, I free my leg and scooch over to the remaining space on my seat that is safe from the blubberslide.

&gt;LFC sees me shift over in my seat and shoots daggers at me. 

&gt;He scoffs and yells ""*FINE*, I'll move, OK?!"". 

&gt;Everyone on the train looks over as he takes a few tries to get up.

&gt;He mumbles under his breath as he walks to find another seat. Jimmies, they be rustlin'

&gt; mybodyisready.avi

Look, I live in what I would consider a pretty healthy city. In an otherwise obesity-ridden southern state, the place where I live is an oasis of health, moderation, and self-consciousness. Honestly I rarely see what this sub would consider a Hamplanet. I have been on teams with and am friends with plenty of overweight men and women who are substantially fitter than me both in terms of cardiovasular and general muscular health and, if they ate to do so, could lose weight (but if you're a prop you obviously don't wanna drop too much, and if you are in a higher weight class in competitive PL same thing goes). 

&gt; Schnitzel tells me that what I am doing is ridiculous, dieting is evil, and we should love our bodies as they are, despite how they look. 

&gt; S: ""Have you ever heard of Health At Every Size?""

&gt; tells me how she can run, swim, and dance. she says she eats well and probably less than me and will never be thin like me or my friend and listening to me talk about dieting and dehydration makes her feel sad for me because..

&gt; *until now i am listening with straight face because we're in college and we can have discussions and shit*

&gt; tell her that i see the point of HAES but think it negates largely (heh) the dangers of excess weight and overconsumption. tell her HAES has been used an excuse for not recognizing overeating and under-moving. tell her there is no way that she is eating less than me or moving more than me and not losing weight.

&gt; S: ARE YOU TRYING TO SHAME ME?

&gt; proceeds to tell me that i have a rotten attitude and that it's true than men don't like skinny women, citing [ancient artwork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines) and that women who have excess fat are a sign of the wealthy and thus more attractive and desirable.

&gt; finishes her rant by telling me that i am too bulky for any man to love anyways, why don't i get out of the gym and work on getting some curves, lifting weights are for the bros

1373917360.0	1iczh7	Nutrition advice from the office whale	Astraeus47	714	123	99	"These stories are a constant source of motivation. I've lost 97 pounds since February; and these stories keep me motivated to actually make it. Started out 6'3'' 372, now down to 275. Hard work and smart diet. Lift them weights. Run 'dat track. 

Anyway, I don't know how to green text, but there is this office land whale who insists on giving me food advice. She even had the audacity to stage an intervention one day. This is that tale.

So, Landwhale is 5'3, about 290. Her fat rolls are an undulating mass that pulses with each beat of her overtaxed heart. She has many CONDISHUNS that she insists on telling the office about. Look, I've had a little success, but I'm not going to go out giving unsolicited advice. If someone asks, sure! I'll tell them what's worked for me, but I'm not going to be that dude who is saying, ""Well, what you need to do..."" because it's not my life, it's theirs.

So, anyway, I'm coming back from the copier and Landwhale grunts out, ""Astraeus47 *huff, wheeze* what are you doin' for lunch?""

I wince inwardly and reply, ""I'm going on a jog and having some carrot juice.""

She screws up her doughy, splotched face into an approximation of a smirk, ""Heh, well, some of us in the office would like to take you to lunch. You should go.""

In her hands is a plate of three (3!) lean pockets. It's 10:15 in the morning. ""Well, I don't know, Landwhale. It looks like you're already eating lunch. I don't want to be a drag!"" I smile and try to duck out of the way, but she's filling the hallway. I'm trapped.

""Huh, oh, this is just a snack. The doctor's say I have to have a snack every 4 hours because of my gestational 'beetus. These are good for you because they are Lean Pockets. NOT hot pockets teehee!"" Her kid is 4 years old. I get that gestational diabetes is a Real Thing (tm) but I can't help but think the 2 McBeetus breakfast burritos every morning, combined with the 4 liters of soda a day, are exacerbating the situation.

I decide to give in just to get away from the sweaty beast. There is no winning this battle. I can only hope that they choose someplace with decent options. Regardless, I'll sit with water if I have to.

Lunch rolls around, and the herd of office buffalo decide on O'Charley's; a shitty chain restaurant. Most people order the fried chicken salad (it's healthy because it's salad!) and Landwhale gets the fried chicken wrap with a double order of fries, large coke (diet coke is bad for you) and a thing of friend mozzarella sticks as an app. I decide on water and a house salad with no dressing, no meat, no eggs. 

We are waiting on food to arrive when Landwhale pipes up: ""Astraeus47, we've asked you here today because we are worried about you. You've lost so much weight in the past few months. It's unhealthy. You are putting yourself at serious risk.""

I blink. Areyoufuckingkiddingme.xlsx

I reply, ""Well, I admit the change has been quick, but I'm-""

She holds up her catcher's mitt like hand, and reaches for her 2nd dinner roll covered in butter.

""No, let me finish. I know what I'm talking about here. I have gestational 'beetus... You need a balanced diet and all I see you drinking is juice and eating salad and stuff. You disappear for 90 minutes at lunch and come back drenched in sweat. You're pushing yourself way too hard."" Bros and Ladybros, she shoves the *entire* roll into her maw and talks around it. ""You need a balanced diet like me. I'm eating grains, will have dairy that has calcium, protein with my lunch. Balanced. You're anorexic. You have an eating disorder! We're here to help you."" The herd of buffalo brays in agreement while they demolish a 3rd bread basket. 

I sit quietly and listen to the smacking of mouths as they feed, patiently waiting. No one is talking. I fold my hands in front of me and take a deep breath.

""Are you finished? I certainly hope so. While I am thankful that you all care about my well being, I have to say that this is by far, hands down, the most inappropriate conversation someone has had with me in my career.-""

Her chins, glistining in the soft interior lighting waddle around as she tries to speak. I cut her off.

""No, I'm going to finish what I have to say. The decisions I make are just that. My decisions. You don't get to judge me because I've made a choice to be healthy. I don't walk around giving advice on diets unwarranted because, much like this fucking fiasco you've drug the office into, it is highly inappropriate. I have been fat my entire life, and for the first time since I can remember, I am finally getting to a point where I can *see* who I was meant to be. I can *see* the man that I always was. My wife looks at me in ways I've never seen before. I can walk up stairs without getting winded. I can buy clothes off the rack from a place without 'Big and Tall' in the name. That is a feeling unlike any other, and I will not let you berate me for that. I would normally wait until we got behind closed doors for this next part, but since you've seen fit to bring half the office in on it, I figure we might as well go whole hog while we're here... Although I may not have been here for very long, I still am technically your superior. I don't ever pull rank on anybody in my team, but this seems like the one time I'm going to have to. Don't make comments about my weight or fitness levels again. Or if you want to, at least make an effort to do it privately. I'm not disciplining you here, or anyone else okay? I mean it, too... I'm touched that you all care so much about my health, but there are about a million better ways you could have done this. If anyone wants to talk, my door is always open.""

I stood up, left a 20 for lunch, and walked out. I wish there was an awesome ending like, ""And then a few people wanted advice!"" but... nothing. I still workout at lunch, and none of the herd really talks to me much about anything other than work. And you know, that's fine. If it means that I can go about my business without defending it, then it was worth it. Landwhale is still there; still eating Lean Pockets by the pallet full.

Anyway, sorry about the wall of text. That was grating on me for a while.

1374353115.0	1ipp5k	My Year with Ginger, Pt. 2: Quest for a Plunger	tallula	874	286	109	"[Pt. 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ioqhz/my_year_with_ginger_pt1/)

I had a lot of fun typing that up last night, so here's the conclusion of our first day with Ginger!

To recap, Yuri and I were trying to get the house in order, Eric had left for work, and Ginger's family was bringing in all of her things for her while Ginger sat in the living room, snacking on several Hershey bars and playing the Sims on her laptop. In an unrelated note, Ginger really got me into the Sims. I wasted hours on that shit.

I was putting up liners in the kitchen cabinets when Ginger's family left. They'd brought in her bed, her TV, her bookshelves, most of the heavier stuff while Ginger had sat on her colossal ass, but aside from that they left most of the boxes for Ginger to unpack. I could hear Ginger complaining about this to her parents. ""You can't leave! There's still a lot to be done! Mama, you know how tired I get when I don't lay down!"" Good grief. Ginger's mother tells her that they have a long drive back home and that they'd done the most of the grunt work. ""Maybe you could get your nice roommates to help you."" Fat (see what I did there?) fucking chance.

Ginger comes into the kitchen of course, requesting my help and saying ""I have so many books and my boxes are so heavy!"" I don't want to help her and say that I have to finish organizing pots and dishes. Ginger pouts, says ""Wow, you're not a very Christian person,"" whatever the fuck that means, and goes upstairs and pleads with Yuri. Yuri, who is exponentially more outspoken than I am, tells her to deal with it and that maybe she'll burn off some calories if she does some actual work. Ginger immediately gets irate. ""You don't know what I go through! My condition makes me extremely tired! This is just the treatment I'd expect from someone like you!"" Ugh. This was only the first day.

Ginger waddles back downstairs- apparently walking up the stairs has made her ravenous, and she starts microwaving some frozen meals her mother had left for her. I carry on with my work, but stop when I realize what Ginger is doing. Ginger is microwaving one frozen meal after another. When one would finish heating, she would place another one into the microwave. In the three minutes it took for each frozen monstrosity to cook, Ginger would eat and lick clean whatever she'd just taken out. I counted seven of these microwave trays. I was horrified, and yet too fascinated to look away.

Not surprisingly, after finishing her light lunch, Ginger gets this ""Uh-oh!"" look on her face and gallops to the bathroom. I shake my head, already feeling for the poor toilet. A few minutes pass. The walls are relatively thin in our new apartment. Then I grimace, hearing grunting sounds. Good God. I could could feel bile rising up my throat. Ginger was not even trying to muffle the sounds she was making. ""Ah! Ah-ah-ah! Ah!"" It was one of the worst things I ever heard, and no this was not a one-time thing. Ginger, we'd soon find out, was regularly constipated. Yuri texted me from upstairs. ""Is this really happening?""

Ginger finally stops grunting, and starts panting as if she just gone through a marathon. Then, she does the thing that most of us do after something like that- she flushes the toilet. Then she flushes it again. And again. No, it does not go down. Ginger does not take the hint and flushes again and again. This is apparently a very exhausting experience for Ginger. Ginger comes out of the bathroom, not looking concerned in the least. The smell of feces hung in the air. She goes back to the living room and goes back to her laptop. Believe you me, I was listening, and I did not hear any hands being washed in the sink.

""Hey Ginger?"" I have to ask. ""What did you do?"" Ginger sighs like I'm being difficult, and says the toilet's clogged. ""Don't worry about it though. Just leave it alone, it'll go down by itself!"" she insists. NO IT WON'T! Taking a deep breath, I ask her to fix it. She's not the only one who's going to be using that bathroom, I remind her. She's sharing it with Eric, and Eric won't be happy to come home from work and find a clogged toilet. Ginger rolls her eyes. ""Always thinking about Eric, right? You're so obvious."" It's about being a decent human being, you cunt! I did not say this, though I wish I did. I get Yuri to talk to her though. And by talk to her, I mean he screamed at her. He yells at her that's she's a disgusting pig, and demands that she fix the toilet and clean the bathroom. Ginger looks like she wants to cry. She frantically calls her mother, who I'm guessing is the person who usually deals with Ginger's literal shit, and her mother advises her to get a plunger and some hot water. Kids, take this as a hard-earned lesson: ALWAYS HAVE A FUCKING PLUNGER.

We take some pity on Ginger and Yuri and I walk to the store to buy a plunger and air freshener while she boils a pot of hot water. Part of the reason we wanted to get away was also the smell. It had spread throughout the house. Yuri and I take our time walking back and grab some lunch. When we got back to the apartment, someone was waiting for us. Our nextdoor neighbor, who Yuri had given the nickname of ""Shirtless Hottie,"" was wondering what that godawful smell was. Yuri and I are embarassed, show him the plunger, and explained our situation with Ginger. Shirtless Hottie expresses his sympathies and asks us to hang out. After dropping the toilet plunger off with Ginger, Yuri and I say fuck it to unpacking for the day, escape next door and play video games with Shirtless Hottie, who actually does wear a shirt sometimes and will now be known as ""Luke."" Luke is a student like us. We actually started dating not long after, but that's a story for another time.  

Then, a knock on Luke's door. It's Ginger. She's holding up the- I could see little bits of shit on it I can't believe she was carrying it around- cheap toilet plunger we'd gotten her and she says she broke it and please will we come back and just do it for her she was so tired and hungry and she was out of food and her blood sugar! Oh hell, no. Yuri looks like he's going to explode. We can't believe her. She was going to someone else's house with a broken toilet plunger encrusted with her shit. Luke offers her his superior toilet plunger. ""You guys can keep it."" I can tell it's love at first sight for Ginger. She runs and hugs Luke gratefully, still holding that fucking plunger in one hand. If Luke wasn't built like a football player, I really think Ginger would have taken him down. Luke is taken aback and grossed out. He coughs a bit from the smell of her and the smell from the plunger. Ginger then leaves to get back with the plunging, but promises Luke that she'll be back for him. She winks several times at him. Luke looks like he regrets everything.

Mercifully, Ginger does get the toilet unclogged, and after spraying the house with several cans of Febreze the smell is gone by nightfall when Yuri and I come back into the house. We just want to get some dinner and call it a night, but what do we find when get back? Chips all over the carpet. Candy wrappers. Three empty pizza boxes. What the hell? We find Ginger in her room. She's laying down on her mattress. Her laptop is on her stomach. Her boxes are still not unpacked. What the hell? ""I was just really tired after all I fixed that toilet for you guys. You're welcome, by the way"" EXCUSE ME? Eyeballs are about to explode. Yuri doesn't even want to look at her, and just goes to hide in our bedroom. He's so angry he's shaking. We've all had enough of this girl. Trying to still be nice, I ask her to pick up after herself. Ginger does not get it. ""I've been working all day, can't you people do something for once?"" I want to strangle this girl.

When Eric gets home, I rant to him about everything. Eric laughs his ass off, and promises to treat Yuri and I for lunch the day after for not making him deal with a shitty toilet. Guess who was listening? ""Oh, lunch sounds fun!"" Ginger says, coming out from behind us. She starts listing the restaurants nearby, which is weird because she just moved here and shouldn't already know the names and specialties of these places by heart. Ginger nudges Eric a few times while mentioning the more ""romantic"" ones. We'd all actually planned for a roommate dinner, but after everything we'd gone through today with Ginger none of us were in the mood to eat. Except for Ginger, of course.

Eric says something about saving a cat stuck in a tree and goes to hide in his room. Ginger turns to me, not smiling anymore. ""You know Lulu, you don't have to go after every guy you meet."" Very carefully, I ask her to repeat herself. ""Lulu, you're such a tryhard. You're losing all this weight and chasing after Eric and Luke. It's so sad. You don't have to act like a whore just because you're skinny. Men like that will always want a real woman, no matter how much you throw yourselves at them. If you'd just try to change the way you looked and didn't worry so much about dieting, you could probably get a man in a real respectable manner."" Then she added. ""Yuri's probably so used to women looking like you, and that's why he doesn't think he can be attracted to girls.""

I grew up in a conservative Republican household. My parents are gun-toting, Bible-thumping, George W. Bush-voting, card-carrying NRA members from East Texas. They were not as small-minded as this frizzy mess of white trash blubber in front of me. I alpha up, just for a bit.

""Ginger, you're deluded as fuck if that's what you think. Even if Yuri weren't gay, he sure as hell would never consider being with someone who looked like you.""

Obviously, I didn't go to RW's wedding, as i was explicitly not invited. However, she did come into the store later in the day.

Some of my fellow employees went. No huge drama or anything like that (boo), they said she looked happy, looked pretty, he cried, she didn't.

I also found out that this marks Jonah's FOURTH wife. RW's FIRST boyfriend. I'm expecting some epic shit to go down in the next few months, but please be patient as I can only update that bit when it gets hilarious.

RW has thin-shamed me many times previously, but this one was pretty amazing.

&gt; Closing shift, boo

&gt; That distinct rumble announcing RW's approach shakes my station

&gt; She approaches, arm-in-arm with new hubby, Jonah

&gt; Trailed by two of his children (approximate ages 8 female and 21 male)

&gt; RW ""Look at our rings!"" ""Do you like my hair!"" ""My wedding was soooo amazing.""

&gt; Me ""I'm glad that you're happy!"" while contemplating the glorious fallout that is to come

&gt; Because I'm a terrible person

&gt; RW ""It was so much nicer than yours. I can't believe you just got married in a *house*. It would've been classier if you went to Vegas and got married in front of Elvis.""

My wedding was nice, simple and inexpensive, which is exactly what I wanted.

&gt; RW ""I wore a *white* dress, unlike that trashy orange thing that you wore.""

&gt; Heard this shit so many times that I don't even care anymore, water and ducks

&gt; RW ""And we had *all* my family there, and *all* my friends.""

&gt; Me ""That's nice, RW.""

&gt; Realizing she isn't going to get a rise out of me, she goes off with Jonah-husband to do her shopping.

&gt; Laugh to myself about her wearing white because of her previously expounded upon sexcapades

Is expounded a pun in FPS? It fucking should be.

&gt; About 30 minutes later, RW, Jonah-husband and his two children show up, and of course they have to check out with me

&gt; RW ""Why are you wearing long sleeves in May! You have to be roasting in here!""

&gt; Me ""It was 47 when I came in at 2pm, so I figure it'll be pretty cold when I leave tonight.""

&gt; RW gives a mighty chuckle, ""Oh, I doubt that. It's because you're anorexic. If you learned to eat properly instead of starving yourself, you'd have some meat on your bones and wouldn't feel chilled all the time.""

Yep. Finally told me I have an eating disorder. 130lbs at 5'4 and I have an eating disorder. I normally feel warm or uncomfortably hot in any environment (which is why I *love* winter, cuz omg snow), and because it's unseasonably cold, I'm anorexic.

Bitch please.

Before I can state my thoughts, Jonah's child pipes up

&gt; 21m, ""She doesn't look that skinny. It's obvious that she eats, look how big her legs are.""

&gt; RW ""She's a stick! If she turned sideways she'd disappear!""

&gt; 21m ""And you can see her gut when she moves a certain way. And she has a big butt. She wouldn't be that fat if she was anorexic.""

&gt; Me ""Your total is 89.95.""

&gt; Jonah-husband pays the total, RW and 21m argue about whether I'm skinny or fat

&gt; I give absolutely no shits because I would rather see their marriage explode than I lose my job

&gt; Quietly shake my head as I'm being fat and thin shamed at the *same fucking time*

I can't wait to see what happens after the honeymoon! Whee...

**Side note**: I've gotten a few PMs from people telling me that I'm being too passive and a pushover when RW says shit like this to me. I have worked with this woman for nearly a year and a half now. Saying things to her does no good. Saying things to my managers does no good. I can't get her fired, I can't ever be right with her, why the hell would I put effort into calling her out?

I work at this shitty store to make a paycheck. At this point, that's all it is. Her commentary is just gluttony for you!

1365617808.0	1c2tmh	Moving a stinking hambeast to her new lair.	fw190d	674	90	65	"I was a mover once, moving people across state lines. Often times there was stuff in the truck that belonged to two or more different individuals. We did this to fill the truck up and cut down cost. The stuff was separated. I had an almost full truck and was instructed to go to an apartment and pick up more stuff from another customer. Little did I know the horrors my eyes were to see. 

My crew gets there and we knock. Door opens and I start to cry a little from how terrible the stench is. Like ammonia from cat piss, shit, and rotting food and human rancidness. And I'm still standing outside. 

The woman lets me in. I find out she is the mother of the Beast that has a lair upstairs. It's the Beast's apartment, mother is helping.  I start coughing. 

First of all, there are these dark clumps all over the carpet. Upon further inspection, I realize they are cat turds. I could tell because I stepped on one that was hardened outside, but still nice a creamy on the inside. Cat shit is for me a particularly revolting oder so I started to gag while smearing cat shit around the living room. There was so much it was unavoidable. 

I go outside to finish dry heaving and radio my boss. I tell him this one is a no-go, describe it to him. He says I have to do it. I must do it. Adding those items to the haul would make the haul profitable, and we were on a timetable. Fuck me, after trying hard to get out of it, I reluctantly follow his orders but I tell him he has to send an extra crew to make the job go by faster. 

So I continue with my walk through and must go upstairs. It was like I was entering a different climate, a climate of shit and piss. It was worse than downstairs. I could actually feel getting punched in the face by this ungodly anthropomorphized terror-stench. 

Get upstairs and The Beast is laying in her bed. Easily 450 pounds. The bed had long since succumbed to her fat ass and there was a large depression where she laid. There were fast food bags and pizza boxes all over the place. I could taste the room in the back of my throat. 

Nothing was packed and everything had a shiny glistening coat of grease or whatever had accumulated for who knows how long. I got the fuck out of there and waited for the second crew to show up. I'm the driver but all the crews are brothas. They were revolted too but laughing when the 2nd crew came, telling them they are going to see some shit soon. They were cracking up harder when the 2nd crew went in and ran out like 10 seconds later. I was laughing too because I was just so fucked. I had already cried. 

Anyway, these brothas usually take every job, and they took this one too because they get paid daily and needed the cash at the end of the day to get drunk/stoned. Thank god for drugs and booze. 

I just have them start bringing me shit. Everything stinks. I start loading it. The brothas come back sicker and sicker every time. The bed comes out and there are shit and blood stains all over it. I throw up. Brothas laughing at me as they throw up too. 
Under the bed they found used tampons, chicken bones, rotting food, filthy plates. 
The bathroom was a fucking door to hell. Shit all over the toilet. There was no fucking way the Beast could wipe her own ass. I know because most of the shit was on the seat and floor. 

When it comes time to deliver in a different state, her shit is at the back so it gets off first. I open the back doors and the whole damn truck smells like her apartment. What's worse, is the other people that have stuff on my truck now have furniture and household goods that are infected with the stench. All my moving blankets are ruined. 

We start unloading her shit into a trailer. There is no where to sit and she starts complaining that she needs a chair to kill. She says she can't sit on the floor because she won't be able to get up and god knows even me and my co-worker can't get her up.

As some kind of payback, I tell her sorry, the chairs are farther back but I'll get her one soon. I unload the chairs last. Sorry chairs. She is almost at tears because her legs cannot hold such mass. Fuck you Beast, you ruined my trip. Boss had a lot of explaining to do to the other customers. I got no tip for that whole haul. Fuck you Beast for living in your own refuse. 

Medical personnel aren't the only ones that have to go above and beyond. Sometimes, lowly movers do too.

**DISCLAIMER:** Yes, I'm beta in these stories.  This all happened 5 years ago when I was first popping into the real world and had literally no idea how to react to such a catastrophic person.  I eventually lose my beta near the end of the saga, but unless you want me to outright lie in these stories, stop complaining, because I can't re-write history.  The best I can do is paraphrase, throw in some extra fat-logic, and exaggeration in the scenes.

In this part of the Saggy-Sucks saga, Dramagirl and I bring a mutual friend I'd met in my 2-D class to our apartment for an experiment.  Enter Eddie:  about 6'3"", handsome of face, chiseled of body, skin of chocolate, manner of a gentleman.  He was studying to be an architect, the guy had it going on!  Dramagirl and I had been telling him all the shit that had been going on at the apartment with Saggy, and we both constantly teased him that we were gonna throw him into the lion's den.  One day we actually make this happen (with Eddie's full cooperation of course).  

&gt; Be the day after I take all of Dramagirl's and my dishes/groceries/kitchenware from the kitchen and keep it locked in our rooms.  I'm pretty sure it was the weekend, because I was usually up before everyone on the weekdays.  This morning I was snoozing away in sugar-plum valley when I'm woken up by the sound of cabinets being slammed shut over and over and someone getting aggravated in the kitchen.

&gt; Oh boy it's happening.  She's realizing all our stuff is not available for her use anymore.  

&gt; Brace for impact!

&gt; I get a text from Dramagirl: ""are you awake??""

&gt; I text back ""oh yea, I hear it.""

&gt; she slinks into my room, giggling as we hear Saggy stomping down the hall towards our rooms

&gt; We hear a pounding on my door 

&gt; ""This is really immature guys, I need a bowl and spoon for my cereal.  I need to eat breakfast or I'll be sick and weak all day.""

&gt; ""Then why don't you use one of your own bowls and spoon Saggy?"" I say through the door.

&gt; There's a pause

&gt; ""You bitches know I can't afford to buy dishes I have barely enough from student aid for food!""  Saggy whines.  ""Those cheap assholes don't give us enough money, right Dramagirl?"" (Dramagirl also got student aid from the school through grants or something, I don't know how it worked) ""Not everyone has a mommy and daddy who pays for all their shit!""

&gt; Lol, my parents don't pay for my stuff.  I had to work during the summers to save for college so I didn't have to work during school.  All the money I had earned was budgeted to buy all my groceries and art supplies for my classes for the year.  My parents were not the type to just provide what I needed, which was good parenting, it taught me to plan for unforeseen circumstances (like Saggy stealing my food) and how to budget like a normal adult.  Saggy got money from her mom and student aid every month and Dramagirl and I quickly found out she would spend almost all of it the first week.

&gt; ""My parents don't pay for my stuff Saggy, and if I remember correctly, doesn't your mom give you money for food?""

&gt; ""Mind your own DAMN business you fucking whore!"" Saggy shouts and starts pounding on the door again.

&gt; GIVE ME A GOD-DAMN BOWL I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ALL NIGHT AND MY BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE LAST NIGHT YOU SKANKS ARE GOING TO SEND ME INTO A COMA!""

&gt; She continues to shout and whine, beg and plead but we're not budging.  Dramagirl continues to shout back how ""maybe if Saggy hadn't eaten $500 worth of food in a week she would have money for dishes"" and ""maybe eating less would be good for her.""  Dramagirl was such a bitch!  I loved it.

&gt; Saggy eventually stomps off, defeated.  Not sure how she fed herself, but she was slamming doors and stomping around like a brat all day.  About a week later she got one or two plastic dishes from wal-mart.

**A WEEK OR TWO LATER**

I'd introduced Dramagirl to Eddie at this point so she could corroborate my stories about Saggie, and we all got along just fine. We'd teased him about locking him in a room with her and how when we opened the door she'd be picking her teeth with his bones.  Eddie really wanted to see if we were exaggerating or not about this girl, so we invite him over for some vidyas (Dramagirl liked halo and was trying to teach me, I liked Orange Box and she was playing those with me) and some Saggy-watching.

&gt; So we're at the apartment chilling and throwing grenades at each other.  Eddie was on my team and we were still getting our tooshies whooped by Dramagirl.  She was a beast!

&gt; Then the tv goes all static-y, and Dramagirl pouts about how she was about to snipe my bitch-ass.

&gt; Dramagirl's complaints were cut short when we feel a rumble from the other side of the wall (where Saggy's room was).

&gt; **STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP**

&gt; After a few moments of earthquake rumbles, Saggy emerges in the booty shorts she always slept in and a way-too-tight hoodie.  As always, she was braless and pantiless, with her massive cracks attacking our faces.

 &gt; She yawns, then notices Eddie sitting there with us.

&gt; Our game is forgotten, we sit there with bated breath.

&gt; Saggy's face lights up and she bobs her mountain of a hip to the side.

&gt; ""Well heyyyyyy boyyyyy, watchu doin heeeere?"" she says with her ghetto voice activated.  Dramagirl and I roll our eyes.  Eddie has a shit-eating grin on his face.

&gt; ""Just playing halo with Saggy-Sucks and Dramagirl!"" he says in a polite tone. ""My name is Edward, but my friends call me Eddie, it's nice to meet you,"" he gets up and offers his hand for a shake.  Saggy looks taken aback but grabs his hand with her fake-nailed claw.

&gt; ""Oh you're mr. manners aren't ya?"" she said, taking in Eddie's collared shirt and nice pants.  Eddie dressed pretty well (yes he was straight even though he was an art student...he was just metro I guess).

&gt; She pulls out one of her huge boxes of chicken nuggets, her powder mashed potatoes box, a big tub of country crock, bacon, eggs, grits, and cheese.

&gt; ""I'm makin breakfast **Edward** you want momma to feed you?"" she said, raking a fake nail against her tongue.  

&gt; Eddie's composure was made of diamond, while Dramagirl and I were snorting back laughter.  

&gt; ""No thank you, I already ate before I came over,"" he said.

&gt; ""Honey you gotta let women feed you!  It's only polite!  I'm gonna show you how a real lady treats her man,"" and started to cook the entire kitchen's worth of food.

&gt; We all played halo, while sneaking looks to each other

&gt; After a while, Saggy plopped this HUGE platter (she'd used the top of her big Tupperware bowl as a plate since a normal plate couldn't hold enough beetus to satisfy her man) of bacon, grits with cheese, eggs, 5 pieces of toast, a glomp of mashed potatoes and a bowl of cocoa puffs cereal next to it.  She had a two plates for herself and a bowl of cereal since she gave the ""platter"" to him.

&gt; ""Now that's a providin' woman!"" she says, gesturing to the feast.

&gt; Eddie said thanks, ate a piece or two of the bacon, and said he was done.  She makes a fuss of course, talking about how he would ""never keep all dem muscles if he didn't eat big!"" *then ate pretty much everything that he'd left over as well as her two plates and bowl of cereal.*

Over the course of the next hour, she continues to try to flirt with him, pushing up her boobs, trying to ""sexy talk"", and making hints that her bedroom was RIGHT THERE and she was ""a master at pleasing the males in her life.""  *vomit*

Eddie was calm and polite, never breaking character once. Saggy got progressively more and more annoyed with him as she found he was going to school, had a part time job, yes, he dressed like this everyday, and no, he was not the LEAST bit gangster. She was trying to tell him his clothes didn't really work for him and even went so far as to plop her gigantic bottom in his lap.  This was the only time he lost his cool.

&gt; ""OW!!!  Hey, sorry, you're just too big - "" 

&gt; Oooooops

&gt; **volcanic eruption impending**

&gt; **EVACUATE**

&gt; ""EXCUUUUUSE ME?  TOO BIG?  HONEY I'M THE PERFECT SIZE, I'VE GOT ALL THE MEN I WANT IN MY LIFE AND THEY ALL WANT A PIECE OF THIS LUCIOUS"" she said, running her hand down her convex side.  ""ARE YOU A FAGGOT OR SOMETHING?  YOU AIN'T SHOWN ME NO RESPECT SINCE YOU FUCKING GOT HERE!  I BET YOU JUST WANT THESE SKINNY HOS BECAUSE THEY REMIND YOU OF THE LITTLE BOYS IN THOSE PICTURES YOU KEEP HIDDEN UNDER YO BED! YOU DA MOST PATHETIC NIGGA I EVA MET.  MY BOYZ WOULD BUST A CAP IN YO HEAD SO FAST YOU AIN'T GOT TIME TA JERK IT TO THESE FLAT-CHESTED WHORES!""  

&gt; Dramagirl and I are outright rolling on the floor laughing at this point, and Eddie has been loosing his cool throughout the entire rant, trying OH SO HARD to not laugh.  By the end of her tirade he was failing pretty bad at stifling his laughter.

&gt; Saggy HATES that she's not being taken seriously, literally just screams for about three seconds

&gt; Our faces are like [0__________0](http://imgur.com/WapLIRo)

&gt; She stomps away and slams her door.

&gt; ""I don't think she likes you Eddie,"" Dramagirl says once the door is closed.

&gt; We all laugh.

&gt; Saggy only likes thuggy blacks

&gt; Eddie is immune to the whalesong

There was much rejoicing.

Until we realized she'd left her dishes all over the living room again.

TL;DR Muh Muh returns, berating everyone in sight and finally getting her medicun--with spectacular results!

Sorry my dearest hammies, I’ve decided to do something about my own slowly expanding mass and have been frequenting r/keto and it’s been working wonders! But, I’m taking a break from cooking metric fucktons of bacon to continue the odyssey of Muh Muh.
When we last left [Muh Muh in Part I]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3diw/the_long_awaited_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_i_muh_muhs/) (read for reference, or you might not know what’s going on), she was on her way to git her medicine a la a super massive cart in a grocery store I used to work at on third shift. We left off on one fateful stormy night, a night that was dark and full of terrors:

&gt;Be me, entranced by the largest human being I had ever seen


&gt;Be crouching behind a display of oranges, watching the agonizingly slow advance of Muh Muh and her Daughtermoon (clinging to the back of her muh muh’s massive cart)


&gt;The cart (dubbed by the store employees as a big amigo, [if you don’t understand the reference]( http://powerchairr.blogspot.com/2012/10/amigo-power-chairs.html) is whining in agony as it is forced to move 900+ pounds of flesh through the supermarket


&gt;The cart begins stopping and starting, jerking Muh Muh from her slumber/coma


&gt;Daughtermoon is leaning on the seat, tripping the weight sensor on and off, and eventually all the way off


&gt;Muh muh, sensing Daughtermoon is the cause of her ceased advance towards her medicun, begins bellowing unintelligibly and flailing her elbows backwards


&gt;Daughtermoon is unfazed, since Muh Muh’s backfat prevents her elbows from achieving much backwards reach


&gt;Daughtermoon whines that her legs are tired, she can’t walk, but after a tirade of curses she hops off the back of big amigo


&gt;Muh muh is wheezing again, jaw slack, jowls aquiver, her eyes looking opposite ways and towards the ground


&gt;Muh muh looks like a crazy person, a bit of drool has collected on her lower lip


&gt;”GIT MUH MUH A DRINK MUH MUH’S THURSTY” she says to Daughtermoon, who procures a 1 liter of diet pop from the cloth tote in the basket


&gt;Muh muh chugs the liquid, and makes another demand: “GIT MUH MUH’S STICKER MUH MUH DON’ FEEL GUD”


&gt;”HURRY UHP!” shouts Muh Muh as Daughtermoon fumbles in the massive tote


&gt;Daughtermoon procures as “sticker” (a vial of insulin with a needle attached), pops the cap and with deft, practiced hangs plunges the needle into Muh Muh’s ample thigh, injecting the entire vial

I knew this was insulin, and I knew what it was for. What I didn’t know then was that insulin needs to be given in correct dosage after taking a blood sugar measurement. I didn’t know what it was a thing then, but this likely introduced some form of insulin shock on top of whatever the hell else was wrong with Muh Muh—probably quite a list, actually.


&gt;Muh muh takes a breather—riding all of 20 feet in the cart, screaming, and getting a drink and some insulin has exhausted her, but she recovers after a time


&gt;45 minutes has elapsed, Muh Muh has managed to move a total of about 50 feet—from car, to scooter to her present location


&gt;Ignoring her mother’s warning, Daughtermoon hops back on the back end of the cart


&gt;The back tires are scraping the wheel well, but the cart makes a slow advance, and turns into the first aisle containing pop of all varieties on the right and wine and craft beers on the left


&gt;I move behind an end cap to continue my observation, riveted to the developments ufolding in front of me


&gt;Late night shoppers, with far more sense than I, begin scurrying from 
the aisle, shooting dirty looks at the obscenely loud volume of her voice (you might’ve noticed, but Muh Muh was always set to one volume—somewhere between maim and kill)


&gt;The expressions turn from disbelief to disgust as they take in all that is Muh Muh, but they flee nonetheless—their flight response overcoming their curiosity


&gt;Once again irritated with the slowness of her movement, Muh Muh begins a second expletive-laden rant, berating Daughtermoon for hanging on


&gt;I hear the cry of a young baby coming from the bundle of dirty blankets in big amigo’s basket


&gt;”DAUGHTERMOON GIT OFF’IN MY GAWDDAMN CART UHND GIT DAT BABY OUT DERR TOO DAT CRY BE WURKIN’ ON MUH NERVES UH 
SWURR TUH FUCKIN GAWD!”


&gt;Daughtermoon begrudgingly obeys, clearly immune to this ritual vulgarity


&gt;Muh Muh gives her a sharp rap on the back of her head as Daughtermoon walks away with the baby and obscenely heavy tote (filled with several more liters of pop, I conjecture), and goes and sits on the floor on the other side of the aisle


&gt;My mind, still buzzed by the earlier toke, struggles with the possibility that that could be Muh Muh’s child. There is simply no way, I reason, that that thing came out of that disgusting, beetus-crusted vageen


&gt;But, alas, my musings are cut short, for, unbeknownst to me, the stars were in a perfect alignment that dark, stormy night


&gt;Muh Muh senses her goal is now attainable, and floors it


&gt;Without Daughtermoon, the cart can finally move at relatively normal speed but—behold!—Muh Muh is once again struggling to remain conscious


&gt;Her head rolls to the side, but her hand is not taken off the accelerator and she begins veering to the left


&gt;The cart, sensing an opportunity to slay its oppressor, lets out a grinding whirr and accelerates further


&gt;I know what’s about to happen, I lean forward in anticipation and dread, all the while beseeching the gods o’ beetus to prevent the catastrophe that was surely to follow

In order to understand what happens next, I have to describe the aisle. As I mentioned, the right side of this aisle is pop (soda, for you Southerners) while the lefts is wine and craft beers. The opposite side of the left unit is all hard liquor. Unlike the rest of the aisles in the store, which continue maybe 50ish feet in a solid line, the left side with the booze is split halfway through and there is a gap that splits the double sided shelf units into two sections. Since that likely made no sense, [I painted a diagram for you all](http://i.imgur.com/tlpiPg2.jpg). Yes, I am an artist.

Inside this split are two displays of wine, facing each other, maybe ten feet apart (dark purple squares in diagram 1). The displays consist of rustic, decorative wooden crates made out of flimsy wood. These crates were stacked on their sides with the wine displayed within. They are stacked three wide, and about five high—the highest at about to eye level for the average person. You might see where this is going…

&gt;It all happened so fast, with a catastrophic noise Muh Muh grazed the wine display facing away from her approach but arced perfectly into the display facing her approach


&gt;Momentum = mass x velocity, in this case the velocity was perhaps 3 mph but the mass was incalculable


&gt;With such unfathomable momentum, the cases never stood a chance


&gt;The cheap wood was splintered without discrimination, the cases crumpled like so many matchsticks


&gt;Upon impact, Muh Muh pitched forward helplessly, her underbosom folds engulfing the big amigo’s handlebars


&gt;My vision was filled by a cascade of red wine bottles falling everywhere, and shattering spectacularly on the industrial tile floor


&gt;They bounced off Muh Muh, they broke on impact with the cart, half a dozen were crushed between the front of the cart and end of the aisle creating an explosion on impact


&gt;Droplets of wine floated through the air, and some were caught in the orbit of Muh Muh’s head


&gt;They sparkled under the fluorescent lights, like a purple halo, and for one glorious moment Muh Muh *was* the god o’ beetus


&gt;After a minute, there was deafening silence throughout the store


&gt;The clamor temporarily snapped Muh Muh into consciousness once again, and upon observing ground zero and the fact that a few unbroken bottles of wine had fallen into her basket (Medicun: Obtained, Mission: Complete), she decided it was time to hightail it out of there


&gt;Dropping big amigo into reverse, she floors it once more


&gt;With a mechanical roar of frustration at his unsuccessful initial attempt at killing the beast, big amigo lurches backwards with astonishing speed whereupon impact #2 occurs


&gt;The second display of wine is thereupon obliterated similarly to its counterpart


&gt;Wine bottles showered the floor once again, this time raining upon Muh Muh’s head as well as the floor


&gt;I see from all angles, my coworkers are rushing to the source of the cacophony as the spectacular explosions of wine continue


&gt;The few wine bottles somehow surviving the fall roll along the floor, as if for comedic affect


&gt;My manager (Ms. Bitchy Blonde) suddenly skids into sight at the opposite end of the aisle


&gt;”What—I… how?!” she stammers to no one in particular


&gt;As the entire grocery department is now clustered at either end of the liquor/pop aisle the greasy gears start turning in Muh Muh’s beetus-infused, alcohol-soaked, insulin-abused mind


&gt;At long last she comes to the inescapable truth that she just demolished hundreds of dollars’ worth of wine and--*gasp*--she might have to pay for them!


&gt;Without an accusatory word being said, she inhales and begins a tirade at my manager (all 115lbs of her):


&gt;”UH DIN’ DO NUTHIN’ THESE BOTTLES WERE BROKUN WHEN AH GOT HURR AND IMMA SUE YERR ASSUS CUZ DIS IS GODDAMN BULLSHIT *blah bluh* CONDISHUN BEETUS *blugh blargh* AN MUH HUSBIND IS GUNNO WHOOP YERR SKINNY BLONDE ASS!”


&gt;I feel a giggle escape my lips, then as the tirade continues I struggle to keep myself from passing out due to struggling not to laugh out loud


&gt;”So… you’re saying you had nothing to do with this mess?” Bitchy Blonde asks with raised eyebrows


&gt;”NO I DID NAWT MUH SCOOTER SLIPPED ON THIS SHIT AN I HIT MUH KNEE AND NOW UH THINK IT’S BROKE AND IMMA SUE YERR ASS”


&gt;”I SWURR TO FUCKIN’ GAWD I DON’ EVEN DRINK”

At this point, my sides are leaving orbit due to the hilarity of the situation (and maybe I was still under the influence a tad). Here sits this massive woman, drunk and out of her mind, screaming at the top of her lungs while helpless to even get up. Muh Muh is veritably *covered* in wine, it has literally soaked and splattered her entire outfit, staining an even darker purple. There are droplets on her face even, her disgusting feet and ankles are soaked. A massive pool of red wine is steadily spreading through the aisle, creeping under the shelves even and covering a huge amount of floor and Muh Muh sits in the center of the pool. The blinding irony was she would not have been made to pay for it, as per the policy of the store. If she would have stopped bellowing like a wounded wildebeest, she would have heard Bitchy Blonde say so. 
 
But it didn't matter because, guise… she had *nothing* to do with it. 

&gt;Muh Muh is once again wheezing in between riffs of profanity when she begins to execute a 23 point turn to work her way out of gap in the aisle


&gt;Crunching can be heard from big amigo running over bits of wood and glass on the floor


&gt;Muh Muh bumps into the aisles on either side each and every time she changes direction, adding to the hilarity and the pathetic nature of the scene


&gt;With each small collision she pitches like a massive, grotesque rag doll backwards and forwards in her seat, as if her abdomen muscles cannot even hold her straight up


&gt;This goes on for several minutes, whereupon Muh Muh alternates between screaming, muttering and grasping for air


&gt;I’m curled on the floor at this point, dying from trying to silence my laughter


&gt;Just as Muh Muh had finally straightened out and was successfully exiting the aisle, Big Amigo let out a final, quiet death throe and stopped—his life given in valiant service to Muh Muh’s fattassery


&gt;From far away, on the other end of the store, Mexibro and Mexiplanet let out a wail of grief for their fallen brother


&gt;But that was where the hilarity ended, for just then Muh Muh inhaled to berate the world at large for the fact that her amigo had stopped but nothing came out


&gt;Nothing, that is, except for a tiny, quiet belch/hiccup


&gt;And then another and another


&gt;Her right hand went to her heart, as each new burp convulsed her body ever so slightly—the effect these movements had on her rolls/waves of blubber were positively breathtaking


&gt;Then the burps began to sound… different somehow


&gt;In fact they sounded… wetter

So, two days ago my parents went out of town for a birthday party of a friend and then right after going to a funeral, so they were going to be away for 3-4 days. I didn't know these people so I didn't come along. And yesterday Miranda comes over to hang out, but has a bag with her. I ask whats in the bag and she says some clothes because she wanted to spend the night. I try to stay calm and say ""Cool"" After a day of watching a movie, introducing her to /r/fatpeoplestories, which induced many laughs and much talking. It starts to get late and she wants to take a shower. She does and I go to the living room to watch some tv. I can only speculate as to what happened now as I think she can't teleport. The Manatee snuck through the backyard in through an open porch door and into my room. Now I hear something strange, it sounded like it was fabric ripping and some fat giggles. I go to investigate, only to find the Manatee in my room, Mirandas bag open and ton of clothes on the floor, and something that would cause PTSD in lesser non-viking genetic men.

She was trying on something Miranda had brought and it was probably 40 sizes too small for the Manatee, it was ripped and stretched beyond belief. I yell ""WHAT THE FUCK!"" and just stand dumbfounded as this majestic sea creature tries to do sexy poses and blow kisses. I don't know how long this took place, but before I know it, Miranda was there and almost in tears. I snap out of it when the Manatee says ""Teehee, why did you invite me over to try this on when this slut is here?teeheeeee"" I say ""I didn't invite you over you fucking cunt! Miranda call the police"" Miranda goes to the house phone to call the police, and the Manatee says ""Don't you fucking dare you whore!"" and starts to walk out of the room, I am standing in the door way and realize she would have to go through me. When she gets close I push her and she falls down. She starts flailing around and after a minute she just gives up and lays there. The only thing I could think at the time was, ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" So the police arrives, Miranda is up front explaining what had happened and after the two officers have to work together to get her up and then arrest her. While on the way out she's yelling ""WHY ARE YOU ARRESTING ME, THAT WHORE BROKE INTO MY BOYFRIENDS HOUSE!"" while motioning for Miranda. They just ignore her and drive off.

And today I got a letter saying I've been granted a restraining order, and I fully expect I, Miranda, Jessica and others to be summoned as witnesses later.

1375887552.0	1jvx65	The Dark Future of Hamerica	Biriuk	780	200	75	"The year was 2056. America lay in shambles, her last vestiges of civilization devoured by the forces of nature. I wandered alone through the urban jungle, cautiously creeping over the debris left behind by the swarm.

The swarm. That's what we called them. The roving bands of beasts that slowly prowled the streets in search of food. The resources of our once-great nation had been steadily declining for years but once the swarm began their rounds, our fate was sealed.

I crept carefully through an alleyway beside my old place of employment. Looking around for signs of the swarm, I turned my key in the employee side door and said a quick prayer. Luck was with me, and the door swung open.

I hadn't been inside since the incident. The building was in shambles, absolutely ransacked by the swarm. The soda machine had been ripped from the wall. Old fast food wrappers littered the floor, and I carefully stepped around them with my tattered red shoes. The crinkling of a fast food wrapper was often enough to draw the swarm, and once that happened you needed to be prepared to move quick. Alone, a member of the swarm was easily dealt with. In large numbers however, it was a different story.

I made my way back to the walk-in freezer. The padlock was still intact, and I pulled out my keys again. With a soft click, the padlock swung open and I stepped inside.

The freezer, and the power, still worked to my surprise. I hadn't expected much, but I was desperate. Out of food and in need of nourishment to make the journey out of the city, I needed calories and I needed them fast. Who knows how long it would be before the swarm ran out of food and turned to hunting the ""privileged?"" I couldn't take that risk.

The privileged. That's what they called us, even before the incident. The term had started on the Internet before slowly gaining traction in reality, and before long it was what the swarm used as a galvanizing point against us. It seemed non-threatening enough back then, but if anyone could have predicted how it would end, we would have been more prepared.

I was in luck. The freezer was nearly fully stocked. I slung the backpack off of my shoulder and brushed my red hair out of my eyes. Time to get to work.

I grabbed as many of the frozen meat patties as I could carry. The idea of eating them raw made me retch a bit, and if the swarm happened upon me after they thawed I would be sniffed out quickly, but they had protein. I knew I would need my strength for the journey, so I filled the backpack as best I could. Hidden in the back corner, behind a sack of frozen French fries, I found an unexpected treasure: a pint of Haagen-Daazs chocolate ice cream, perhaps left behind by my old manager, Darlene. Ice cream had been a rare treat at best even before the incident, but a pint of it now was worth its weight in gold.

I knew the ice cream wouldn't last long in the summer heat, but I grabbed it anyway, just in case. Stepping out of the freezer, I turned and snapped the padlock shut behind me. I carefully dodged the wrappers covering the floor and opened the door into the alleyway.

It was bright outside and it took my eyes a few seconds to adjust. I blinked a few times and began to move south towards the main highway leading out of town. I had heard tales of a colony out there, in the wild, with plenty of food and water. It seemed too good to be true, but at the very least I knew the swarm couldn't follow me there and that was enough. That was their weakness: they had to stick to the roads and other handicap-accessible areas, lest they become stuck.

I moved at a slow jog in order to make better time, but this turned out to be a mistake. The noise of my physical exertion had alerted the swarm to my position, and before long I heard the familiar mechanical whirring of their faithful electronic mounts.

I tried to speed up, to out run them, bu it was no use. They had made great strides in scooter technology in the years leading up to the incident, and they now topped out fully loaded at 35 miles per hour. It was a shame, with the energy required to propel that weight at those speeds, we could have conquered the stars. But now the planets would conquer us.

Back in 2028, a scientist by the name of Chow-Yun Xiao was studying the human genome in regards to obesity. His findings were nothing special at first, certainly nothing new. However, he became fascinated with Type-II diabetes after his wife, a leader of the fat acceptance movement, was diagnosed.

Xiao worked hard night after night, desperate to find a cure for his wife's condishun. And then, one day, he found... something. An injection that would alleviate the symptoms of Type-II diabetes and, while unable to cure obesity, could abate the symptoms.

Xiao, however, was not able resist his wife's fatlogic. Instead of putting the vaccine through clinical trials, he gave it to his wife. The vaccine worked. Too well, in fact. By improving the insulin response and the body's glucose tolerance, Xiao had effectively cured diabetes. What he had also done was increase the grehlin levels of his patients while reducing leptin. The vaccine's net result was someone who was always hungry, but suffered fewer health drawbacks from extreme obesity. The swarm was one step closer to truly being Healthy At Every Size.

As the swarm began to surround me with their carts, I couldn't escape. My mind began to race. I was fucked. Here I was, carrying a backpack full of meat, wearing my tattered old work uniform, surrounded by the swarm. Was this the end for me? Please God, not like this. 

""Well lookee what we got here, girls!"" exclaimed the lead beast in a southern drawl. ""One of them there thin privileged bastards.""

""Th- this is oppression,"" I mumbled submissively, stalling for time.

""YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT OPPRESSION?!"" the leader screeched. She launched into a tirade about thin privilege and curves while my mind desperately groped for a solution. I scanned the surroundings. The highway was 3 miles ahead, no way I could beat them there. 

""Hey, he looks kinda familiar..."" one of the swarm began, only to have her comment drowned out by the leader's blustering.

My mind was in overdrive now. I had to think of something or I would be eaten or worse, injected. I didn't have any weapons. If I ran they could run me down with their scooters. F=MA, I would be splattered. Desperate, I thought about bargaining. But the moment I gave them what they wanted, they would turn on me. THINK!

""No he really does look like I know him..."" another member of the swarm began. Oh shit. If they figure out who I am I'm getting injected for sure. My mind begins to take stock of what I'm carrying and a smile creeps across my face. I know what I must do.

Quickly, I take off my backpack and unzip it. The Haagen-Daazs is a runny mess but perfect for what I needed it to do.

""I know who he is! He's RON-""

I interrupted the fatty by speedballing the pint of now-melted ice cream at her.

""LOOK GIRLS! ICE CREAM!"" I shouted. For a moment they sat, unwavering, and I was worried my plan had failed. Then, slowly, the words I had said began to sink in. The member I had coated with the melted remains of the Haagen-Daasz lifted a chocolate covered chin roll up and gently tongued it.

""He's not lying! It's really is ice cream!"" she said. With those words, she had sealed her fate. In a flash, the scooters revved and surrounded her, fat little fingers tearing at her flesh. Her screams rang heavy in my ears as I sprinted away with my bag full of meat. A few twists and turns later and I found myself holing up inside a second floor apartment long-deserted. 

I hadn't had a shower in weeks, not since the day they had descended on my workplace and gotten Darlene. Had it really been weeks? Funny how we normalize things so quickly.

I walked into the bathroom and studied myself in the mirror while running a shower. I was a mess. I slowly peeled off my old work uniform, hoping the apartment would have something I could wear instead. I untied my shoes and stepped into the shower. The water felt good on my skin, as it swirled down the drain stained white and red. I ran my hands through my hair as the water washed away the paint and grime and smiled to myself.

Many of you hated the last story, and I expected that, but I didn't expect so many people to feel such strong sadness over it (I think I expected anger more). I'm sorry for not just putting the justice out immediately after! I figured since this was such a juicy episode I'd separate it into its own part. I've learned a FPS lesson: eat more calories first so I have enough energy to un-rustle those jimmies! And boy will your jimmies be in a Hawaiian paradise after this.

Onward. We now know Saggy is a terrible babysitter and her baby momma friend is probably even worse. Saggy also got a cat. BEGIN.

&gt; Sometime later, after begging, fighting, and passive-aggressiving, Saggy still has not gotten the kitty what it needs, and it's just pooping and peeing up a storm.

&gt; Dramagirl finally gets a litter box and teaches kitty (whom we figured out was a girl) how to poop like a proper lady cat.

&gt; Saggy tries to take credit because there's OBVIOUSLY a lack of feces on the floor now, but Dramagirl puts an end to that pretty quickly.

&gt; Saggy tells us that quiet baby is coming over to stay for a while and do we mind?

&gt; Holy crap of course we don't, even Saggy is better than that mom, plus we can help keep her reined in.

&gt; We both agree a baby wouldn't be a problem and wow, thanks for actually asking first instead of just doing whatever you want.

&gt; Saggy says ""yea, baby's momma got arrested, and probably won't be out soon. Baby's momma's other friend had been taking care of baby, but she's tired of it and baby's daddy has to get money to come get baby.

&gt; Dramagirl and I share a look I have no gif for because I'm on a phone.

&gt; How much worse is this daddy going to be? 

**A few days and a few baby giggles^yayprogress! later**

&gt; ""Baby daddy is coming today!"" Saggy says through tears.

&gt; Says she ""wants a black baby so bad"" through sobs and shoveling ice cream down her throat.

&gt; Priorities bitch, you're at college and can hardly feed yourself.

&gt; Lol that's a lie. She feeds herself better than three college guys feed themselves.

&gt; ""I'm gonna eat nothing but ice cream for the next week to deal with this,"" she says, not even paying attention to the baby she's gonna ""miss so much"" because food &gt; baby.

&gt; ""Did you know there are hormones in ice cream that make women feel better if they're sad?"" Saggy says through spoon fulls. ""That's why women always eat it on television when they're sad! It makes total sense!""

&gt; bitchwhat.gif

&gt; Daddy gets there. 

&gt; Dramagirl and I get the surprise of our lifetimes.

&gt; Baby daddy is EXCITED to have the baby! Loves the little tyke, and made even better baby faces than all three of us silly women.

&gt; Saggy is instantly in love.

&gt; Baby daddy says baby momma moves to college towns, traps guys getting an education with pregnancies, then milks them for child support for forever. 

&gt; The laws suck in the southern USA, so the woman wins full custody every time.

&gt; She's already had another baby taken away while she's been here (before Saggy met her) that she had with another college guy before baby daddy.

&gt; Doesn't know why she was arrested, but just got his degree that summer and will do his best to take care of baby and undo the damage she did.

&gt; He hates her with the burning hot passion of a thousand suns.

&gt; Will spend his lifeblood keeping baby away from baby momma.

&gt; Saggy is practically having a conniption because there are to many witnesses around for her to absorb baby daddy into her love-struck ~~heart~~ tummy.

&gt; Immediately tells baby daddy she didn't trust baby momma and tried to get baby away from her as much as possible. Apparently she also felt like a mother to baby after just a few days of babysitting and would he like some pie?

&gt; Look at the pie Saggy made that she's been eating for the past hour bit by bit. It's already over half-gone. 

&gt; She must be on a diet - she's exercising restraint today.

&gt; Saw how much sugar and country crock butter she put in that pie.

&gt; Baby daddy's life is forfeit if he accepts. No mortal could consume that much sugar in one sitting.

&gt; [hfw](http://i.qkme.me/3v7oc7.jpg) and escapes with his life (Thanks /u/pizzatacos!!!).

&gt; Saggy asks if baby would like another piece?

&gt; Another?

&gt; Pretty sure babies shouldn't be eating that much sugar. Baby daddy agrees and says so.

&gt; Saggy knows for a fact that sugar and butter are the healthiest things a growing baby boy can eat and insists the pie was a wonderful idea and she made it all for baby.

&gt; Yea, your food baby you have growing in your abdomen.

&gt; ""My mother raised me on sugar and butter and I'm probably the healthiest person in this room,"" Saggy says proudly.

&gt; Look at baby daddy.

&gt; He's about 6 feet and not even a little chubby.

&gt; Look at myself.

&gt; 5'8"", still probably at 145 lbs.

&gt; Look at Saggy.

&gt; Pretty sure she's eaten so much country crock her flesh is mimicking its creamy, droopy consistency.

&gt; Baby daddy nopes the fuck out of there with baby in tow, hope and proper nurture billowing behind them like a sparkly rainbow.

&gt; [An approximate representation](http://i.imgur.com/bpAPHnw.jpg), provided by /u/doyouknowhowmany

&gt; [and another](http://i.imgur.com/iGrIHwy.jpg) from /u/thatgirlnoonetalksto

&gt; Saggy returns to her ice cream and pie. 

&gt; Consumes all of it that morning while I did a project in the living room.

&gt; Notices I haven't eaten my slice she gave me a while ago.

&gt; Saggy is in no mood for my anorexic shenanigans.

&gt; Demands I eat my pie and stop being ungrateful.

&gt; ""I'm on a diet Saggy, I told you no thank you but you gave me one anyway. I'm not going to eat it.""

&gt; Bitch I'm working with exacto knives today, I dare you to mess with me.

&gt; Saggy dares.

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks can't you see I'm an emotional wreck right now? Can't you be at least a little considerate of my loss? You're hurting my feelings right now because I know you're starving but you still won't eat the pie I made you!"" she says in near hysterics, causing tectonic activity with her jiggly flab waves.

&gt; I'm tired of Saggy's drama, I have a project that was due yesterday to finish, and I don't want her God damn pie OR another three hour whining session.

&gt; ""You had baby for a few days, you're being ridiculous, I don't want your stupid pie because I'm trying to stay away from sweets, I'm not starving I had breakfast, and you didn't make it for me OR baby like you told baby daddy you made it for yourself because you apparently need to eat an entire pie for breakfast and a tub of ice cream to cope with your non-existent problems.

&gt; My only regret is that Dramagirl was not there to witness her good teaching at work.

&gt; Saggy starts screaming profanities so thick it made me gain five pounds.

&gt; ""YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE TWAT I'LL CUT YOU FOR BEING SO DISRESPECTFUL TO ME! HOW DARE YOU TREAT MY DEPRESSION SO HARSHLY I'M SUFFERING FROM POST-PARTUM AND I NEED THE ICE CREAM TO BALANCE MY HORMONES! NOT THAT YOU'D UNDERSTAND YOU PRIVILEGED LITTLE TRUST FUND BABY, YOUR PARENTS PROBABLY FED YOU LAXATIVES IN A SILVER SPOON YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL PEOPLE LIKE ME GO THROUGH EVERY DAY!

&gt; ""I'd say at least one pie and a tub of ice cream.""

&gt; There was a nuclear explosion guys.

I had to pack up my stuff and finish my project in my room cause she started grabbing my stuff and throwing it. I couldn't stop laughing and I'm bad at hiding it, which made her even more mad. She screamed at me on and off (mostly on) for about three or four hours. So much thin shaming you wouldn't believe. She threw all my food (thank God I hadn't gone grocery shopping in a while and didn't really have anything left) in the garbage after ripping it all to shreds.

When Dramagirl got home, SHE then went nuclear on Saggy for the unreal mess that Saggy made in the kitchen. 

The cycle started all over again, with Dramagirl and Saggy screaming at each other the worst names they could think of for a good long while.

I was eating it up like Saggy eats sweets.

I didn't finish my project that day. 

**TL;DR: Saggy has to give up baby to someone who actually knows how to parent, focuses her emotional distress on me when I wouldn't eat her pie. I fucking hate key-lime.**

So I'm currently driving back to Colorado after a short visit to Texas. It's a long haul without much in the way of pit stops once you get past Amarillo, so you take fuel ups when you can. We decided to stop at a Love's in bum fuck nowhere New Mexico. After taking care of the animals, I scampered off to pee. Upon entering the surprisingly clean bathroom, I notice that the air *reaks* of shit/period and shitty gas station fried food. This should have been an omen, as Love's are notorious for not sucking. There are only 2 stalls. One had an out of order sign, but the handicapped stall door was open a crack, so I assumed it was unoccupied. I'm sure you can see where this is going. As I opened the door wider, I was hit with a wave of shit/period stench. 
HolyStereotypesBatman.jpg
As it turns out,  the stall was occupied by a woman(?) That was 5' ish (she was seated) and around 275-300 pounds. Nasty sweat pants down to her ankles, accompanied by stained granny panties, too tight camo tshirt barely containing dem curves, ratty hair, infected looking piercings, shitty tattoos, disgusting toenails crammed in old, dirty flip flops, the whole nine yards. I could see her FUPA and the surrounding area clearly. Much more so than I would ever want to see. It was all splattered/smeared with shit and blood. And this woman was -eating- inhaling a corn dog or something.

I stood there dumbfounded for what seemed an eternity, but was only seconds; Just long enough for her to finish her snack, and grab a bag of chips OFF THE FUCKING FLOOR next to the toilet. Suddenly she spotted me, and screamed ""WHAT DA FUCK, YOU PERV?!"". I beat a hasty retreat, and was trying to to apologize for walking in on her, but she started yelling again, something along the lines of "" GET DA FUCK OUTA HUR SKINNY BITCH. DIS BE DA STALL FOR FOLKS WIT *insert huge belch here, I shit you fucking not* DISBILTIES!!!"" Etc. I peed in the nasty clogged toilet and then noped the fuck out. I could still here her shitting, groaning, mumbling to herself, and stuffing her face when I left. I may be scared for life. It was awful."	t5_2vzax	True
1371479333.0	1gim3i	Flight attendant vs. fatties	JesusSwallows	667	84	93	"Here are a collection of fat people anecdotes from my mom. She's been a flight attendant for 35 years now, but only recently has her job description included whale management. My mom is an unfathomably nice woman and would never criticize someone for their weight, and she realizes that flying can be very uncomfortable (physically and emotionally) for obese people, so she gives everyone the same great service regardless.

* For a while (like 2002-2008), the seat belt extensions the airline supplied had a random acronym ""F.A.T."" on them from the manufacturer. It became a running joke among her and her flight attendant friends to point this out exaggeratedly from the rear galley while the head FA used a seatbelt extension during the safety demonstration.

* Up until the 90's, there were maybe two seat belt extensions on each plane. Now they have at least 15, and often run out. According to her friends who fly for Atlanta-based Delta and Dallas-based American, those airlines' flights require twice as many.

* At least a week somebody will try to pull the ADA card to the gate agent and demand a first class seat on account of their obesity. It never works, never will work, but they keep trying.

* My mom's good friend almost got fired for giving a (thin) diabetic kid a free airline meal because the Buick-sized asschunk sitting next to her complained to the airline. A 13 year old girl flying alone hadn't realized that the meals weren't free (this was around 2005, back when most airlines has just switched to meals-for-purchase) and didn't have a credit card to purchase a meal. The flight attendant comped her a meal, and the fatass sitting next to her barked that it wasn't fair. He later complained to the airline and lied his ass off about how the flight attendant refused to give him a meal because of his weight. Corporate was PISSED, almost fired her, but they let her go with a warning when they realized how unlikely fatass's story was (the flight attendant was known among frequent fliers for her excellent service).

* **Also:** Obese people (qualified as anyone who needs a seat belt extension) aren't allowed to sit in the exit row, supposedly because ""seat belt extensions would dangle and trip people trying to exit through the over-wing exits."" The truth is actually that they probably wouldn't fit through those exits and would literally clog the arteries of evacuation. It's up to the discretion of the ticket agent who sits in the exit row (I luckily am always asked if I'd like an exit row seat because the agents see I'm the son of an FA; pretty awesome).

My mom once almost had to report a terror threat because of someone's obesity. I'm not kidding. This was in early 2002, when terror alerts were still very high. My mom hasn't flown a Phoenix trip since this.

An old fat turd of a woman (OFT) had been rude and needy the entire flight, but during the descent is when she took the cake (and ate the entire thing). Right after 9/11, there were stringent rules about remaining in your seat for the entirety of the descent, *no exceptions*. You sit there and shit your pants if need be; you do not get out of your seat. Also, the first class lavatory is *only* for first-class passengers; nobody from coach is allowed past the divider between the two cabins.

But clearly these rules don't apply to OFT, because she has a disability. They're 10 minutes from landing when she decides she has to pee. And she's in the bulkhead (fatties always request the bulkhead), so lord knows she's not going to squeeze down to the rear lavatory. My mom can hear her getting up (it takes her several tries, gripping the first class divider like her life depended on it) and gets up off the jump seat to let her know that she's breaking federal law and needs to plant her ass back in her seat.

When my mom starts to tell her she has to get back in her seat immediately, OFT goes batshit about discrimination and how she has a right to use the bathroom, SHOVES my mom out of the way, and waddle-runs-oozes up the first class aisle as fast as she can until THWOMP she falls on her face in front of the cockpit door and commences screaming that she can't get up. It's clear she's not injured, however, and has sat up.

My mom and the rest of the crew couldn't care less about the woman's well being. They have a passenger who has gotten up during descent, forced her way to the cockpit door, and is refusing to move. No matter what the circumstance, this is a potential terrorist situation and she could lose her job if she doesn't treat it as such. Another flight attendant goes to the rear galley and radios the captain to let him know what's going on right outside the cockpit door.

Tired of her shit and not exactly following protocol, my mom tells the woman bluntly that she has broken federal law and that if she didn't get back to her seat immediately they were planning to arrest her upon landing. She shrieks, scrambles, and is now magically able to get herself up. She struggles to her seat, fuming. The pilot don't have her arrested, even though he absolutely could have.

Best part: she had to wait for a wheelchair to deplane, so she had to endure the entire cabin walking past her and giving her disgusted looks once they landed.

**TL:DR:** Entitled chunkums almost gets arrested for attempted terrorism.

**Edit:** Fun fact: flight attendants are not afraid to straight crop-dust you in the face. Don't be a dick if you're sitting in the aisle.

**Edit 2:** Sorry I didn't greentext; I'm new. I read the sidebar and will *not* say ""let me know if you want to hear more"" but I'll be home this weekend so I'll get a fresh retelling of her other stories. Also, damn y'all, this sub is some good motivation. I went to the gym over lunch and had lentil soup. Don't nobody like a chunkleberg."	t5_2vzax	True

TL;DR Muh Muh’s medicun run has finally come to an end.

Not sure how many laughs you’ll get outta this one, this is kind of a set-up for the final act of Muh Muh’s Odyssey and where shit really starts hitting the fan. This is also begins the part of the story where you might begin to see why this is the ~~mother~~ muh muh of all FPS’s. As I write this, I realize that another reason this story gets so great is there are so many hammy characters all interacting at once, and all of their absurdity and laziness kind of coalesces into something… greater.

First off, read the first two parts if you haven’t already, they’re linked above.

When we last left Muh Muh in part 2, her super massive scooter (RIP, big amigo) had just died after she singlehandedly destroyed the profit margin of the store I worked at by trying to get some wine (medicun). Many thanks to [/u/Edward-Teach]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Edward-Teach) for pointing out to my fat-shaming self that being able to get a bottle of wine *without* singlehandedly destroying the profit margin of a grocery store is, in fact, thin privilege.

This all takes place at one of the larger chain ‘Marts in a mystical area situated in Midwest Michigan, which, if you haven’t learned by now from my stories, is a veritable hammy cesspool of beetusy proportions. Since Muh Muh needs no introduction at this point, let’s ~~jump~~ bite right into it shall we?


&gt;Be me, staring into the eyes of the first, true hamgalaxy I had ever 
encountered in my life


&gt;Massive be her girth, Muh Muh be her name, terrifying be her visage


&gt;The massive cart which had recently tried to slay Muh Muh, its oppressor, sat lifeless beneath her titanic, cottage cheesey ass cheeks and colossal thunder thighs


&gt;Hark, even now, the metallic groans as big amigo becomes flatter and flatter, his lifeless frame on the way to being a titanium-reinforced pancake by Muh Muh’s incomprehensible 700ish lbs


&gt;But I paid less attention to big amigo’s corpse just then than fatties to a Chinese restaurant without a buffet


&gt;For at that moment, in extreme agitation and drunkenness, Muh Muh was having a convulsion


&gt;I acknowledge to myself that this is likely the end for Muh Muh, her heart gave all it had to give—but vital organs can only take so much abuse


&gt;Muh Muh flopped lifelessly forward, the already dim look in her eyes 
fading to obscurity


&gt;Karma must surely be real; the universe had meted out to Muh Muh what she had deserved


&gt;Ah, vengeance was had at last


&gt;Vengeance for her poor daughter, to whom she had been mercilessly cruel


&gt;Vengeance for the poorer big amigo, destroyed, humiliated, soaked with Sutter Home, and ultimately flattened in a most undignified death


&gt;Vengeance to all the people over the years that she had so mercilessly berated and treated so shittily, maybe—just maybe!—there is a god and he is indeed just


&gt;The ambulance pulled up, Muh Muh was pronounced dead


&gt;With some effort, they moved her away to wherever she may lay


&gt;You see my thighroid-challenged Redditors, there are two morals to this story


&gt;Firstly, one’s body can only take so much abuse, so treat it well


&gt;And secondly, and most importantly—don’t trust anyone


&gt;Because, guise seriously…


&gt;Do you think I’m George R. R. Fucking Martin? Do you think I’d bother to tell a story where the main character died right in the middle!?


&gt;No, if you’re looking for justice, I suggest you frequent [/r/KarmaCourt]( http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/), for you’ll find none in this FPS


&gt;Muh Muh’s heart may have endured years of abuse, of course!


&gt;Muh Muh’s arteries were more clogged than the toilets at The Old Country buffet, naturally!


&gt;But Muh Muh remained alive; indeed, the convulsions were, in fact, a 
sign of something even more horrifying than death


&gt;With a sickening sound, and what appeared to be massive tectonic shifts of her fleshy flab folds, Muh Muh… well, there’s no way to put it nicely: Muh Muh blew chunks. And then she blew some more chunks

&gt;For an uncannily accurate illustration, courtesy of [/u/siplux](http://www.reddit.com/user/siplux), click [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aczPDGC3f8U) (somewhat NSF, skip to 0:20)


&gt;Well, not exactly—turns out there are no chunks to be found 


&gt;In fact the substance that was currently being expelled from Muh Muh’s grease hole was an almost-black shade of red, highly viscous, and reminiscent of the fire-rrhea one often experiences after a Taco Beetus binge


&gt;For a moment it seemed the bouts would never end, Bitchy Blonde was frantically paging the night shift store manager, someone was yelling to call an ambulance


&gt;The sheer volume being ejected from her distended stomach was staggering, and Muh Muh was sweatin’ like a whore in church as this was likely the biggest workout of her life


&gt;Muh Muh unceremoniously coughed and spit some loose phlegm onto the floor, missed, and the giant red lugi ended up splattering all over a sixer of craft beer


&gt;Muh Muh jerked her head up, shit running down her chin, eye’s no longer attempting to focus in on anything in particular until she spotted my manager


&gt;And just like that Muh Muh was shouting again, just as bold as you please and without missing a beat, as if she wasn’t covered in wine and her own oral excrement


&gt;“BITCH DON’ YOU CALL NO FUCKIN’ ABURLANCE I AIN’ GOT HEALTH INSURINS! IMMA SUE YERR AYUSS IF YOU CALL—“


&gt;Her screaming was cut short by another convulsion and another wave, which, by the way, was mixing with the *still* expanding pool of red wine to create a goop that was currently opening a portal to the 13th dimension of hell right on the floor


&gt;As the this scene continued, I noted the phlemvomit was sizzling and eating through the glass bottles of beer on which it had landed

Now, something you should know about me, I don’t have a weak stomach—I was studying premedicine/biochem at that point, cadavers didn’t touch my gag reflex. But the one thing that makes me throw up instantly is the sight, smell, or even the sound of someone else vomiting.

Oh, did I mention the oral diarrhea had psychedelic swirls of brighter red in it? The nurses and doctors in the audience will know the general black color was older blood (and dark purple wine too, most likely) while the bright red patterns are made up of ~~a decadent strawberry swirl~~ newer blood that had likely just seeped into her stomach via a large number of lesions/ulcers that probably littered her stomach lining. Needless to say I went from trying to hold laughter from escaping my mouth to trying to hold in something different altogether.


&gt;I panic and run to the cooler with fresh veggies in it to breath in the cool air, to my right still sitting on the floor pretending as if nothing is happening is Daughtermoon, cooing to the baby resting on the floor next to her and playing with a naked, dirt-crusted Barbie doll


&gt;[MFW]( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/126/314/3cd8a33a.png?1306264975)


&gt;Muh Muh must’ve had another break in her vomiting because I can once again hear her bleats coming from the aisle next to me


&gt;As the vomiting seems to have stopped, and my stomach seems more or less settled, I step out into the center aisle to see the fatass night shift store manager coming towards me in another mobility scooter (which he kept in the back right next to his office “in case any customers needed one when after they got to the back of the store”)


This night shift manager, dubbed Flabby Patty, can be a mini series of FPS by himself (I have such a massive, no pun intended, lineup). He was a lazy piece of shit who had the most rancid body odor ever, with a face similar to [The Penguin as played by Danny DeVito]( http://images.ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny-devito_penguin_batman.jpg) but standing at 6'4 380 lbs. He was a most pathetic creature, who shame-ate constantly and had a fuse shorter than his dick, with the worst case of PowerTrip-itis I have ever seen. His default mode, however, was a quiet, over sincere, wheedling blither.


&gt;The store is in chaos at this point, Flabby Patty and Bitchy Blonde are trying to have a conversation about what to do, Muh Muh is out of control


&gt;Her screams are no longer intelligible; her lazy eyes are wandering and twitching aimlessly


&gt;[HFW]( http://derek.broox.com/photo/don-vitos-back-to-school-tour/full/2836/don-vito.jpg)


&gt;I’m struck with a sudden idea. I crouch next to Daughtermoon, feel bad for blanching at her smell, and kindly inquire:


&gt;”Hey, sweetie, do you know to get ahold of your daddy or someone 
else in your family?”


&gt;Daughtermoon brightens instantly, and surprises me by saying she has her daddy’s number on her muh muh’s cell phone, which she produces from the tote


&gt;She begins to express concern for her muh muh, warns me not to call an ambulance because every time muh muh goes to the hospital “daddy gets real mad and muh muh falls a lot buh-cuz the doctors can’t hold muh muh uhp”


&gt;Her heartbreaking sincerity and the brief glimpse of her life almost make me tear up, but alas, I go around the other side of the aisle to report to Bitchy Blonde and Flabby Patty


&gt;Flabby Patty is still seated of course (never know when a rogue disabled customer might come walking down aisle 1 needing that cart that he so thoughtfully and selflessly moved all the way up to the front of the store)


&gt;Bitchy Blonde agrees, but Patty wants to call the hospital still as he is *concerned* about the *valued customer* (aka covering his ass for potential liability, not that I blame him)


&gt;Muh Muh doesn’t seem to be in any immediate danger or harm, in fact she’s confined to a nonmoving scooter, Bitchy Blonde (BB from now on) argues—let her husband decide what to do (translation: BB don’ give a shit)


&gt;Alright, we’re agreed—the three of us walk back around to Daughtermoon, BB barking at the employees standing around to get back to work, they disperse


&gt;Muh Muh is mumbling and making gurgling noises from the other side of aisle, the pool of ~~wine and vomit~~ the devil’s titty milk has seeped under the produce aisle like a demonic miasma


&gt;The smell collapses my nasal openings; I say a silent prayer of thanks for this small blessing


&gt;BB orders me to “call the fuckin’ Mexicans” (her exact words) to clean up the mess


&gt;I page Mexibro and Mexiplanet: “Clean up in aisle 1,” I say in my most supermarkety voice


&gt;I can’t help but suppress another giggle, since “clean up” is the understatement of the millennium


&gt;I remember who I’m trying to get ahold of and repeat the phrase in terrible Spanish, adding several obscene phrases (this was typical behavior, the Mexi’s thought it was hilarious since none of my coworkers knew Spanish and I was swearing at them over the loudspeaker) and a cryptic warning about what they had in store for the rest of evening into the page for good measure


&gt;Hopefully none of the few night shoppers knew Spanish, I think as I walk back to my managers


JW if you all have picked up on the fact that we were an extremely professional lot of workers who gave many fucks about life in general, cared deeply about our jobs, and had the utmost respect for our superiors and the company.


&gt;BB’s face is pale white, as she is listening on the company handheld to an offensively loud male voice on the other end that I can hear from 5 feet away


&gt;”O-OK, thank you,” she stutters and hangs up


&gt;”Don’t worry,” she says to the clearly distressed Daughtermoon, “you’re daddy says he’ll be here in 3 minutes!”


&gt;Expecting relief from Daughtermoon, BB is stunned when Daughtermoon begins an earsplitting wail, scoops up the baby, and bolts away to hide, screaming about how “her daddy is gonna be so mad!”


&gt;BB presses her fingers to her temples, “Can this night get any fuckin’ worse?” she mutters


&gt;Just then I turn to see Mexibro and Mexiplanet reach the end of aisle one, the look on their faces when they have no faces nearly sends me into hysterics once again


&gt;”At least you aren’t them!” I tell BB in an obnoxiously cheery voice 
(yes, irritating her was a hobby of mine and I did it often—but, she was a nasty, racist, man-hating human being)


&gt;BB gives me the most intense “fuck off” look I have ever seen, and I do just that


&gt;That is, until *he* arrives


&gt;Yes, I feel it in my loins; the Bringer of the Red Beetus is fast approaching, the hour of reckoning grows nigh


Guess there’s going to be a part 4 before the epilogue, I literally add more and more detail to every story these are getting inordinately long, I know! I can’t help it, I have a kundishun! I originally wanted to end the story in part III, but guess you all are getting a bonus installment.

That is, if you waaaaaaaant me to write it? Teehee!

I was on vacation in Cyprus, in an all-inclusive resort with two of my closest friends. It was awesome, we ate and drank and swam and had a general awesome time in the sun (I'm from Sweden originally and the weatcher suuuuuucks).

Most of the people at the all inclusive resort were families as it is easier for them because they don't have to find food for their children as soon as they get hungry.

I remember this one russian couple. they were huge, really huge. The man stod at 175cm and approximately 200kgs and the wife at 150cm and maybe 100kgs. What broke my heart was their child.

There was this little child, maybe 7 years old. The cuuuutest child I had ever seen, she was walking around with a beautiful smile on her face almost 24/7. She was super active and running around and playing with all the other kids and having a general awesome time.

However, as her parents, she was huge. She looked like a little meatball (literally round). She and her parents ate almost every second hour and they ate as much as me and my friends (3 full grown, active men).

My heart sunk as I could only see in front of me how she would face so many problems in the future, how she would be shunned by society for being so obese. This, only because her parents kept overfeeding her, now she is facing a hard life with constant struggle because her parents didnt take care of her.

This is my reason for fat-hatred. Because an innocent childs life is ruined because her parents had fat-logics.

No puns or jokes. Sorry."	t5_2vzax	True

Sorry it's been so long since I gave you all your latest fix of hamlogic and beetus. Work has been in the way, and I haven't had the time (or the willpower) to once more enter the repressed memories that are Turboham.

That time has come. I must once more face the beast.

By the time this story happened, she was 5'2 and definitely clocking in at over 3 bills.

&gt;Be me

&gt;Going to work

&gt;Same shift as Turboham again

&gt;I need a new job

&gt;Get to work

&gt;Turboham isn't there yet

&gt;Start work

&gt;Annie tells me that DM is coming in today

&gt;Do DM things

&gt;Check up on the store

&gt;Make sure we are all working

&gt;Good times will be had by all

&gt;Almost 45 minutes after I started, it begins

&gt;Hear all cows begin to wail in unison or their fallen brethren

&gt;All pigs in North America keel over in a show of solidarity

&gt;A cataclysmic event has just struck the meat trade

&gt;The Event will henceforth be known as ""Turboham's Afternoon Snack.""

&gt;She waddles in, clutching two Wendy's bags

&gt;She extracts not one, not two, but three triple Baconators

&gt;These sandwiches are so unhealthy, Wendy's scoffs at the idea of putting veggies on them

&gt;Literally just beef, bacon, ketchup, and mayo

&gt;Over 1000 Calories a pop

&gt;x3

&gt;Turboham unhinges her jaw, crams the first one down her throat

&gt;mfw she doesn't even chew

&gt;I can't bear witness to the feeding

&gt;I go to reorganize shelf

&gt;A few minutes later, the DM walks in.

Now, the DM is objectively a very good-looking guy. He looks a bit like Ryan Gosling, if he were about 5-10 years older. We shall call him Ryan.

&gt;DM walks in

&gt;Annie is in the back

&gt;I give him a curt nod, which he returns

&gt;I'm surrounded by game cases with an empty shelf in front of me

&gt;I'm not really in a position to help

&gt;heunderstands.goodguydm

&gt;This leaves Turboham

&gt;Turboham doesn't know who Ryan in

&gt;She momentarily stops feeding to gawk at the new arrival

&gt;Hunger and primal attraction juxtaposed and both engaged

&gt;See the internal conflict

&gt;Compromise

&gt;She rushes out to offer help to Ryan, clutching a brand new triple Baconator

&gt;By rushes, I mean ""quickly"" waddling over

&gt;Stands in front of DM, asking him if he needs help with *anything. Really, ANYTHING AT ALL*

&gt; ^^teehee

&gt;Twirling her greasy hair

&gt;Playfully toeing the ground

&gt;That part of the floor is now permanently warped

&gt;Trying to take seductive, dainty bites out of her baconator

&gt;Pinky raised and all

&gt;mfw

&gt;Ryan looks stunned

&gt;He has only heard tales of the Turboham

&gt;He thought they were being exaggerated

&gt;Nope

&gt;He decides to roll with it

&gt;R: ""Yeah, I'm looking for a good RPG game for my nephew. What do you recommend?""

&gt;TH: ""I know the new Call of Duty game has RPGs in it""

&gt;I don't know what's in a worse state; my jimmies or my sides

&gt;Ryan stares blankly

&gt;Turboham continues

&gt;TH: ""You could always come over to my place and I could show you how to, you know, *play.*""

&gt;Ryan has gone pale

&gt;Turboham strokes his upper arm confectionately

&gt;He's beyond pale

&gt;He's looking a little green around the gills

&gt;Poor guy

&gt;I could intervene, but nature must run it's course

&gt;R: ""Do you treat all your customers like this?""

&gt;TH: ""Only the yummy ones.""

&gt;Ryan visibly chokes back fear vomit

&gt;He's afraid he will be eaten

&gt;We've all been there, my friend

&gt;You're now one of us

&gt;One of us

&gt;One of us

&gt;R: ""Is Annie in?""

&gt;TH: ""Why do you need to see *her*?""

&gt;Her voice dripping with malice

&gt;Or mayo, not sure

&gt;I chime in ""Yeah Ryan, she's in the back.""

&gt;Ryan walks past Turboham, punches in a code to unlock the back door

&gt;Takes one last, sad look at Turboham

&gt;Closes the door

&gt;Turboham looks confused

&gt;She asks who the hell that hunk of man meat was*

&gt;*Her words, not mine

&gt;That was the DM, Turboham

&gt;She is now a little pale as well

&gt;Mutters something about being stressed

&gt;Needs stress-relieving calories

&gt;Walks out door

&gt;A few minutes later, Ryan and Annie come out

&gt;A: ""Where's Turboham""

&gt;Me: ""I think she went for food again.""

&gt;Annie facepalms so hard it causes an earthquake in Japan

&gt;Ryan simply looks bemused

&gt;R: ""I'll wait,if you don't mind.""

&gt;Annie and I lock eyes

&gt;ofw

&gt;We hang out with Ryan for almost half an hour before Turboham returns clutching a McBeetus bag

&gt;As soon as she walks in, Ryan speaks

&gt;R: ""Can I see you in the back, Turboham?""

&gt;TH takes a long slurp of her milkshake and nods

&gt;They go to the back

&gt;All is quiet

&gt;10 minutes later, we hear a long ~~wail~~ whale from the back

&gt;Turboham runs out crying, still holding her milkshake.

&gt;No beetus bag in sight

&gt;Right out the front door

&gt;Ryan emerges from the back

&gt;He looks like he just fought a war

&gt;Hollow, sunken eyes

&gt;Poor man

&gt;He briefs us on what happened

&gt;As he went over the long list of grievances against Turboham, she argued every one

&gt;While she was eating

&gt;He basically told her that we weren't going to continue employing her because of her appalling conduct

&gt;She threw the last half of her burger at him

&gt;Then picked it back up and **ATE IT**

&gt;Then she asked if she could have another chance

&gt;He told her no. Get your things and leave

&gt;That's when she wailed and ran out crying

That was the last I saw of Turboham at that job, but I saw her on one or two other occasions at social functions (her boyfriend is good friends with Annie) More stories on that to come in later days

&gt;A week later dad brings mum back from the aiport.

&gt; [Mum gathers the children around and begins to tell her tale.] ( http://thefundraisingcoach.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/indian-storyteller.gif?w=450&amp;h=291)

&gt;She tells of the great white airplane she sat on in an aisle seat on her way home.

&gt;She tells of a great thunderous sound coming closer and closer, getting louder and louder, as it the heavens themselves were sounding.

&gt;We children huddle close.

&gt;Mum talks of how the lights darken and people begin to shudder.

&gt;The airplane suddenly begins to sit a little lower.

&gt;Enter one of the largest women my mother has ever seen, 5'4"" and 350+ pounds.

&gt;Just as she waddles on, the plane still gets lower.

&gt;Her husband of 6' and easily 400 pounds gets on as well.

&gt;The couple move past mum, and she breathes a sigh of relief.

&gt;Oops, only kidding.  They overshot.  They are in her row.

&gt;Father, why hath thou forsaken me?

&gt;With a few ""teehees"" they inform my mum that they will need to slide into her row.

&gt;After holding up the entire rest of the passengers for boarding, and after much heavy breathing and squeezing, the two landwhales seek to do what no landwhale has done before, cheat gravity.

&gt;This is one big squeeze for ham, one humongous squish for hamkind.

&gt;Both fatties had somehow managed to squish into the aisle and middle seat, effectively pinning my dear mum to the window.

And sleep she does, until....

&gt;Announcement comes over the PA, telling people to return to their seats due to turbulence.

&gt;Not really a problem for my mum, as she can't move. 

&gt;Mum realizes she is hungry.

&gt;Looks down at airplane food tray, ready to eat.

&gt;It is empty.

&gt;The hammy woman chimes in.

None4GretchenWieners	730	154	135	"Good afternoon my fellow thin privileged shitlords, I know it has been forever since I have posted, ~~I have been very busy lately~~ I HAVE A KUNDISHUN! I read a couple stories on here about fatties thinking they can fit into thinner girls' clothes, and that reminded me of the time my fatass cousin tried to squeeze into my brand-new jeans.

Bit of info: My cousin, Des, is 4 or 5 years older than me has always been at least 50-100lbs heavier than me at any given time. She is deep into the fatlogic, there is absolutely no hope for her. Her mother (my aunt), Ani, has always been a very large lady herself, but she is very nice and never blames her weight on anything but her own bad habits. My grandma, who has a small appearance in this story, has always been very petite. Her size has nothing to do with this story, just thought I'd pop that in. Now, Ani is my dad's sister-in-law, and my grandma is my mother's mother, so there is zero relation between the two.

Be me, 17, 5'8"", about 160lbs of athletic build, just came home from buying new clothes for school. It's almost the start of my senior year of high school so I've been shopping with my grandma all day for clothes and supplies. Don't be Des, ~21-22, 5'4ish, about 260lbs at the time because ""summertime is for eating whatever you want teehee"" who was already there when I got home. Des springs up and demands to see what I bought. I show her, and she immediately demands I let her try on one of the pairs of jeans.

hahahanope.jpg

I tell her no, she cannot try them on, because first of all I don't ever let *anyone* wear my clothes, and second of all, they wouldn't fit her. She starts whaling about how I'm being mean, but her mom shuts her up and tells her to sit down. I go put my bags in my closet then come back out to make coffee for everyone. After a few minutes, Des excuses herself to the restroom. A few minutes after that, we hear a sound that is quite undescribable. Ani and I rush down the hallway to find Des in *my bedroom* instead of the bathroom, and you already know where this is going. She has attempted to put on a pair of my brand-new skinny jeans, and she is so stuck that the circulation in her legs has been cut off and she can't get the jeans off. My mom has come inside at this point (she was in her little garden before) to see what was going on. Now, at this point I was so mad I blacked out, but worry not, my mom and grandma told me what happened.

According to those two, I flew at Des and punched her square in the jaw while calling her a ""fat fucking cow"". Ani pulled me back and my mom had to get some scissors to cut Des out of the jeans because she was too stuck to get them off. The whole time I was screaming about how I told Des they wouldn't fit, and why couldn't she just leave my shit alone?

When I came to, Ani and Des had left, my mom was telling me she'd take me to get new pants and Ani had left some money to pay for them. My grandma was putting a cold washcloth on my head because apparently I passed out for a minute.

Now, that was the first and only time I reacted that badly to someone trying to put on my clothes. A long history of my cousin being a massive cunt just made my tolerance for her lower than it should have been.

So remember that fridge cage I said I was gonna buy earlier? I eventually got a nice, white plastic one. I agreed to share it with Dramagirl since she usually ate at her boyfriend's or used her meal plan and didn't take up a lot of room.

I put my milk, eggs, cheese, meats, etc. in there. Veggies were safe outside the cage. It was a little annoying because there wasn't TONS of room in there, and I had to bike to the grocery store a lot.

It was necessary FPS, because Saggy gave no shits about taking your food if you left it unprotected. What were we gonna do to stop her? Yell at her? She was immune. The apartment complex wasn't gonna kick her out just because we said she took our eggs without asking. They had gun fights in the parking lot to worry about.

Anyways, for about two months, the fridge cage worked like a charm. Nothing was stolen, it had a 5 number code on it that we obviously weren't gonna tell Saggy, and we got to giggle at her getting furious when she found out it was there.

&gt; ""Yea we wish you weren't a food clepto either Saggy,"" Dramagirl quipped when Saggy first discovered the cage.

Ohhh boy did Saggy hate that cage. It not only prevented her from gorging herself on our food after she'd eaten her month's worth in a week, but it represented the fact that *she couldn't be trusted around ANY food and had zero control* in physical form.

She tried desperately to look over our shoulders while we opened the lock, but she and her 350 lbs. of kneaded pastry dough weren't exactly inconspicuous. We quickly learned to block her view and/or stare her down when we opened the lock. We also changed the combination almost every week. Zip-ties kept that motherfucker in its rightful place.

**THE BEAST WAS DEFEATED**

**AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING**

Until one day...

&gt; Just got back from lovely weekend back in my hometown.

&gt; It's early in the morning, I have 8 o'clocks and usually the other girls get up around 9 or 10.

&gt; Gonna make myself some cereal before I head to class.

&gt; Open fridge.

&gt; Cage is there, but the door has been TORN OFF.

&gt; It is also completely empty.

&gt; I don't make a sound, I just stare for a few moments, then close the fridge door. There was nothing in there anyways.

&gt; Open the freezer.

&gt; Full to the brim with Saggy's freezer junk. 

&gt; Quickly but quietly start to place everything in a new trash bag.

&gt; I empty that entire freezer.

&gt; Go to the cabinet.

&gt; There's not much, just a bunch of chips, oreos, and a jar of peanut butter.

&gt; Stick the peanut butter in my bag cause I'm still hungry.

&gt; Put everything else in the garbage bag.

&gt; Grab bookbag and garbage bag and go to class, chucking the freezer monstrosities in the dumpster on the way.

**LATER THAT AFTERNOON**

&gt; Quietly trying to enter the apartment undetected.

&gt; Nope, she's lying in ~~weight~~ wait. Dramagirl is there too, looking beside herself with glee. There has obviously already been some fighting, because random thrown things are scattered on the floor.

&gt; ""SAGGY-SUCKS DID YOU TAKE MY FOOD I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT DRAMAGIRL JUST GOT HOME FROM HER TRIP THIRTY MINUTES AGO SO IT WASN'T FUCKING HER IT HAD TO BE YOU I'M GONNA GET YOU KICKED OUT OF THIS APARTMENT DON'T YOU FUCKING FALL ASLEEP TONIGHT OR YOU'LL BE DEAD!""

&gt; I feign confusion like a sweet innocent girl and ask what she's talking about.

&gt; She swings open the freezer door and the glorious cavern is revealed.

&gt; Seeing that frosty void next to Saggy's puffy, red, furious face was priceless.

&gt; I gasp in surprise!

&gt; Run to the fridge and swing the door open.

&gt; There the cage sits, white and defiled.

&gt; I gasp again.

&gt; ""Holy crap some fat lunatic stole my food too! What the heck is going on???""

&gt; Saggy wasn't expecting this turn of events. Her chins quiver as her brain tries to find a way to keep yelling at me about the food I obviously dumped without outing herself.

&gt; ""You probably ate everything before you left and don't remember Saggy-Sucks, God, what a fatas-""

&gt; ""-and she ripped the cage door off? Don't be an idiot Saggy, you tore that thing apart like an animal and gobbled up all of Saggy-Suck's food like a greedy whore,"" Dramagirl piped in.

&gt; ""You probably went into a food coma from eating 15000 calories in one sitting and YOU don't remember because you're a huge mound of fat who doesn't know how to do anything but eat!"" Dramagirl yelled.

&gt; ""I'M NOT FAT I'M PERFECT YOU'RE JUST A STUPID SLUT WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING AND DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO KEEP HER WHORE-MOUTH SHUT!""

&gt; She turns her livid gaze to me.

&gt; ""And YOU. You're going to be so sorry you messed with my freezer! I'll get you arrested for theft! I know you took my food!""

&gt; I look her dead in the eye.

&gt; ""Prove it.""

&gt; I walk to my room, followed by Dramagirl's cackles of pure delight and Saggy's stunned silence.

&gt; Almost to my room when I hear her pitiful whine from down the hall:

&gt; ""But what will I eat for the rest of the month???"" she says in near hysterics.

&gt; Dramagirl starts marching down the hall, but calls back:

&gt; ""You could always try hibernating.""

**TL;DR: My fridge cage was no match against Saggy's boundless hunger, I'm starting to learn how to fight back, and Dramagirl is transcending boss level into full-blown alpha goddess.**

Heads up, the next one will be a jimmie rustler. There will eventually be justice but she gets the better of us somewhat in the next episode...

1364491512.0	1b6s0f	My sister...unfortunately 	MooseRidingRoosevelt	663	87	137	"This is short and sweet and will be more of a frustrated rant than anything. (Also typed on iPhone so forgive spelling and formatting errors please)

Tl;dr: my sister fakes getting sick or injured to get attention and justification for her ham planet status and screws me over in the process.

My sister is well on her way to ham planet status. She is 5 foot 6 and almost 270 pounds. She drinks smokes and complains endlessly about the various made up diseases and conditions that plague her on a daily basis.

 She has been like this since age 12 when she started faking sick to get out of school. At age 16 she dropped out to be homeschooled and then never finished that. She complains about her bad knees and her stomach that needs such attention that she can't do anything hard or strenuous. But when it came time for something fun all of the sudden she got 100% better! Able to leap tall buildings and crush innocent bystanders on the other side. Her actions aggravate me to no end. 

Ever since my parents kicked her of the house one year ago, retired and left to go live in an awesome mountain home half way across the country she has lived with her 32 year old beta boyfriend who works as a mechanic and his mom. She treats him like shit and lords over him like Jabba the Hutt. 

Flash forward to last weekend. I am getting ready for awesome spring break of rock climbing hiking and camping with my friends when I get a call from my parents. They ask me to take my sister to the ER because the ambulance companies in her area won't take her anymore. Apparently too many fake calls about heart attacks to get attention gets you blacklisted by 4 ambulance companies. They tell me that her back hurts and that her stomach hurts and that I need to go pick her up pronto. 

I try and tell them that I am literally 20 minutes from leaving and that she's probably fine but my mom tells me to just go pick her up so she'll stop calling her. Fine. I drive over and I go to the door. My sister is walking around in a robe carrying a bucket of KFC and chatting on the phone with one of her friends. I am appalled. She is now easily 300+ pounds and very obviously not in pain. She ends her call and claps her meatpaws together and says 'ready to go?!' Like we're about to go on a fucking adventure. I just stare at her and then walk out. 

She waddles after me and tells me that she's calling mom to make me take her (good god she's 23 I'm 25 what the hell) and I go to get in my car when my phone rings. It's my mom and if course she tells me to do it or I'm cut off (I'm borrowing money from them as a loan to get through jc so I can use my GiBill to get through upper division once I transfer). Fine. Ill just drop her off then. Nope that's not good enough because I have to stay with her. Why, you ask? Because according to my parents I have to stay with her. Or I'm cut off. Wtf. 

We drive to the hospital (unfortunately the one I work at) and as we pull up she cues the most pitiful whale call she can and we walk(waddle) in. She can't fit into the wheel chairs else she'd probably require that. She walks up to the counter of the ER and the nurse just stares at her. Everybody knows her here and knows her antics. 5 hours later, many complaints by the ham sister and after calling mom to make me go on a McDonalds run for her we get called into a room. 

The doc is one of my bosses (I'm an ER scribe, basically an ER docs personal assistant. Kickass job) and he looks at me and asks me why I'm here and not out like I said I was going to be. I just waved my hand towards my sister and said that's why. He just stares at me for a moment with pity in his eyes and then starts talking to my sister. 

She's been here 20 times in the past 2 months and almost every time for something just vague enough to be considered possible in the realms of medicine. He goes through the spiel of you're too fat and too sedentary and that's why she's like this. My sister explodes. Tells this doc he's stupid for not seeing how sick she obviously is (no shit?) and that she's going to sue him for not helping her. 

Cue the montage music as we see my sister being told by many people with various high degrees of medicine and public health that its all in her head. She screams rants raves and tells everybody within shouting distance that she's not fat she's just sick and that she can't lose weight and her medical history proves that. 

They send her home the following morning and on the way home she asks me, with a smile on her face, to stop by Pizza Hut if it isn't too much trouble. 

Oh, and since it took me 14 hours to get out of the ER my friends ended up leaving without me and I'm stuck at home for the week. Thank you fatass.

Unfortunate mature women complained she had a sore in her left thigh. She was morbidly obese with multiple medical issues. I had a nurse assist me in uncovering her left thigh and rotate it to view the complaint. Just prior to my visualization, the nurse collapsed from horror. I viewed a hole in her thigh equivalent to both my hands together. The appearance was a live and perfect view of each muscle group with tendons, nerves, arteries with no necrotic tissue. **The reason for no rotten flesh or fat was because there were the biggest maggots marching back and forth.**


Thin privilege is not having maggots eat the dying flesh that your fat cavities have hidden from you.  Or something.

1375818709.0	1jtzro	Traveling Fats: How two women ruined a good time for dozens of strangers.	PhantomoftheMummy	699	124	103	"This happened a few years ago. 

A neighborhood block party is usually a pretty dull affair.  Neighbors you don’t know and some you actively try to avoid get together to try to learn one another’s names.  I had never attended our neighborhood party, much less acknowledged it, but this year’s was different.  I was dating a woman who was inclined to go to things like this, so we took advantage of the nice weather and the offer of free barbecue and we walked over to see what it was all about.

There were only about ten or twelve people there at 1:00, and the thing had been going on since before noon.  All of the food was gone, as evidenced by the empty bowls, platters and cooler.  We were too late, but it was only one!  What could have happened? I noticed that there were three bags of charcoal sitting near the now cool charcoal grills, and that only one had been opened.  It was still half full.  

Then a neighbor I knew- let’s call him Doug- saw me.  He bugged his eyes in the internationally recognized expression to communicate “I KNOW” and gestured to a pair of flesh mountains seated at a picnic table the city had loaned the block party for the day.

Each one of these women took up almost all of the bench they sat on. I’m not kidding when I say that each of these ladies could have weighed as much as five hundred pounds.  Both were slick with perspiration. One had her hair pulled into a greasy side ponytail and the other had her hair shaved on one side of her head and dyed the other side pink. Both wore sleeveless dresses over filth blue jeans.  Neither wore shoes.

In front of them were bones and paper plates stacked and piled, covering the table.  They were still eating, but from what Doug told me, they hadn’t said much to anyone and no one knew who they were.  If I’d seen them before, I would have remembered them. They were very unfriendly toward everyone, cursing another woman out for picking up a stack of their paper plates that had blown off the table and onto the grass.  Her words were nearly unintelligible, as she had a mouth packed full of rib meat at the time, but basically, she told the stranger to, “Keep the fuck away from me while I’m eatin’, skinny ass bitch!”  It was like a line from a movie.  I started to hate these women.  

Turns out these two had commandeered the food table from the start, and began to issue hostile demands for more food.  They’d eaten four dozen ears of corn, a large bowl of potato salad, several bags of chips, God knows how much Pepsi, and countless baby back ribs and hamburgers. What they didn’t actually finish eating they “claimed” by stacking it on a plate and crushing it down with their filthy, greasy hands. From what I was told, the remaining food was being served directly from the grill to the other people that showed up but one of these women had claimed that they were “first in line” for everything, since they weren’t done yet.  They ignored her that time. Other neighbors would arrive with food and just leave again, taking their food with them.  They were working as natural appetite suppressants.

The biggest of them (but not by much) belched and softly sang to herself as she ate.  Both laughed quite a bit too.  They mumbled to one another, but as I said, they never talked to anyone else, other than to demand more food.  The neighborhood block captain came by with his family and told a group of us that these women were not residents of this block or any other place he knew of in the larger neighborhood.  
As he was talking to us, I looked over to see the smaller of the two hold her hand up to let a greasy napkin blow off her fingers and across the park.  She just kept eating.

I asked them how this could have happened, and the block captain said that no one wanted to confront them.  They were dependent on everyone being more generous and civilized than they were.  Eventually, he stepped up and started to ask them where they lived, and such.  The big one rolled her eyes at him, looked at her partner-in-fat and said, “That’s it, let’s go.  

They stood up together, wiped their greasy hands on themselves and waddled away, mocking the questions asked of them and shaking their heads as if we were out of our minds.  They piled into a filthy old van they’d parked at the corner (how did they both sit up front?) and as they drove by, the passenger threw a bunch of trash out into the street in front of the party site.  It was amazing.  They had Colorado plates on their van.  We live in Seattle. 

We came to realize that they were probably just driving by and decided to stop and eat all of our food for free, act like assholes and leave, and that’s just what they did.

TLDR: Super obese monsters ate all of the food set out for a neighborhood barbecue.

Before our beloved RW started working in customer service (lol), she worked in our jewelry department. It's pretty easy work. Open a case, show a bitch what they want to see, if they don't buy it, put a shit back, close a case. Even a fatty mcfattington should be able to do that with no problem!

Of course, if you have been following my stories, you will realize that RW's main problem is her atrocious attitude toward work and life in general.

These stories were told to me by the head of our Jewelry department, we'll call her K for ease. K is about 5'6 (167.64 cm) and 180 lbs (81.64 kg) and around 65 years old but looks like she just hit 40. She carries her weight well. She had a hysterectomy when she was in her 30s, apparently the lack of hormones made her gain weight. She does not have fatlogic and eats well, so I'm assuming she's telling the truth.

I'm just going to retell it as K told me, some details flushed out for effect because I wasn't there, but I know how this bitch acts.

&gt; RW ""I would just loooooooove it if a man bought this for me. I think the sparkles really bring out my eyes, don't you?""

&gt; Customer ""...Yeah. Sure. Do you have anything more simple? She's not really into gaudy jewelry.""

&gt; RW ""Ugh! I'll never understand how good men could settle for women with no taste in jewelry...""

&gt; Customer laughs (I DON'T KNOW WHY) ""I don't know anything about jewelry, so having simple taste makes it easier for me.""

&gt; RW ""Hahaw, that's because you're a man honey!"" RW touches his hand, ""Men don't need to know about things like jewelry. Just trust me, she'll *love* this ring.""

&gt; Customer considers ""And it's gold, right?""

&gt; RW ""Oh yeah! Absolutely!""

&gt; Customer ""I guess she can always bring it back if she doesn't like it...""

&gt; RW ""What size does she wear?""

&gt; Customer ""Size 6, I think.""

For those unaware, size 6 is about average ring size for womens in Amurica.

&gt; RW ""She has to be tiny! How can you be with a woman so small?! Wouldn't you rather be with a real, *full figured* woman?""

&gt; RW leans over the counter more (glass cracking can be heard), showcasing her wares

&gt; Customer ""I've always dated small women. They're delicate.""

&gt; RW ""Big women are delicate too! We just need *more love*.""

&gt; Customer ""Yeah, so can I just get this ring then?""

&gt; RW rolls her eyes and bags up his purchase

&gt; THREE WEEKS LATER!

&gt; Skinny angry woman approaches the jewelry counter!

&gt; Previous customer trailing behind her, looking like a scolded puppy

&gt; RW is working again that day!

We'll use FC for Female Customer and MC for Male Customer.

&gt; FC ""Did you sell my husband this ring?""

&gt; Aloof RW ""Oh, I can't remember every pretty face I see. I might have, we do have a lot of girls who work in this department.""

&gt; MC ""It was her.""

&gt; FC looks fit to explode and holds up her hand

&gt; Instead of smacking RW across the face, she points at one of her fingers where a nasty green / black ring has formed

&gt; FC ""My husband *told you* that I have allergies and you still sold him a ring that I cannot wear! I should sue your ass into the ground!""

&gt; RW ""He never told me you were allergic to anything. Maybe it slipped his mind with a natural looking woman in front of him.""

To recap, RW wears hideous clown make up. ""Natural"" haaaaaaaaaaah!

&gt; FC ""As if he would ever be tempted like a lump like you when he has me to come home to. More like you got so distracted by a dick in front of your counter that you were more interested in flirting with him than selling him a proper product!""

&gt; RW ""Maybe if you ate properly, you wouldn't be allergic to everything.""

HAHA WHAT?

&gt; FC ""I want to speak to a manager *NOW*.""

How this woman did not get FIRED FOR THIS, I have no fucking clue. One of the managers refunded the ring and gave her another of her choosing for 90% off plus a free replacement plan for 2 years.

Shortly after this, RW was removed from jewelry and put at customer service.

TL;DR - RW flirts with customer, sells ring his wife is allergic to, wife comes in to complain, RW blames her being skinny for her allergies

1374309893.0	1ioqhz	My Year with Ginger, Pt.1	tallula	841	272	78	"This story begins a few years ago, during my third year at university. After a bad experience with my sophomore roomate, I decide to live off-campus along with three other friends. We find an affordable three bedroom, two-story apartment walking distance to school and make plans to move in two weeks before the beginning of fall semester. Four of us initially agree to rent the apartment: me ""Lulu,"" my best friend ""Yuri,"" and two other girls who bailed on us in the summer and chose to move in with their boyfriends instead.

With less than twenty days left to find two other people, Yuri put up an ad seeking roommates on Craigslist. It was the best and worst decision he ever made. We waded through the responses, and found two possible candidates. The first was ""Eric,"" a third year like us who Yuri recognized from one of his classes. We looked him up on Facebook and decided that he seemed rather normal. The other was ""Ginger,"" who neither of us knew. Her Facebook was more vague- there were no pictures of her, the only friends she had had names like ""DarkAngel4353,"" and most of her status updates were about FarmVille or the Sims. Not really assuring. We were desperate though, and put up a time and destination for all of us to meet.

Yuri and I get to the coffee place ten minutes before we're supposed to be there. We're delighted to find Eric already waiting for us, and I take it as a good sign. I'm a female, 5'5 and about 130 at the time. Yuri is 5'9, around 140. Eric is a 6'0 and athletic slightly scruffy Swede. We take a liking to him right away. Eric is nice, funny, and has two jobs so he's sure to be able to pay rent every month. Eric is good people. About 30-40 minutes pass while we drink coffee, get to know each other, and wait for our final roommate. We get rather restless waiting, but hey nobody's perfect. Maybe she's just running late.

Finally, we see someone heading towards us. But wait, no, it's just two middle aged, fat women. They probably just want to grab the table next to us- no, they're stopping in front of us. One of them is about 5'9, looked to be in her thirties, plump but attractive for an older woman. She points to me. ""Are you Lulu?"" I confirm. She smiles, and says, ""Hi, I'm Ginger's mother."" The milky-white, freckled, flame-haired, morbidly obese tub of lard next to her was Ginger herself. Picture a female, fatter, more squinty-eyed Henry VIII in a flower patterned sundress.

None of us wanting to seem rude, we all introduce ourselves and try not to stare. Ginger, I'd soon find out, was 4'11 and nearing 350 pounds. We were all wearing light clothing as it was summer in the Midwest, but the sundress Ginger wore was to say the least, not very flattering. Ginger's mother explains she just came to make sure we weren't all serial killers, and politely excused herself. Before she leaves though, Ginger stopped her, and asked her for $20. Since they'd entered the cafe, I'd noticed that Ginger's eyes had been on the menu. Ginger's mother seems exasperated already by this, but just hands over the bill.

As soon as her mother leaves, Ginger rushes to the counter to place her order. Keep in mind that she had not said anything yet to the three of us- it was her mother who shook our hands and introduced her- nor apologized for not being on time. She cuts ahead of one person, an older gentleman who did not seem to mind. Ginger orders a large blended iced chocolate coffee drink, two brownies, two cake pops, and a banana muffin. Yuri, Eric, and I were eyeing each other throughout all of this, wondering what we had all just gotten ourselves into.

Ginger returned to our table with her tray. It took some time before we were able to coax some info from her. Ginger claimed she was ""starving,"" and had to eat because of her blood sugar. She inhaled the contents of the tray within fifteen minutes while watched with perverse wonder. After slurping the last of her frappe, she told us she was a freshman, an art major, and her parents would be paying for her. We start going over the apartment, the lease, and some general rules. It was the usual stuff: you have to come up with your share of the rent on time, you cleaned up after yourself, no loud music late at night, you pay for your own food, etc. Yuri and I were to share the master bedroom and bathroom, Ginger got the second, and Eric the third. Ginger and Eric would share the only other bathroom. Ginger lookes positively happy about this, she'd been eyeing Eric as if he were a box of twenty piece nuggets. Eric looked uncomfortable.

""Isn't this going to be awesome?"" Ginger says to Eric, batting her nonexistent eyelashes at him. Looking at Yuri and I, Ginger remarks that we looked like a really cute couple. Haha, no. Yuri and I explain that were are simply best friends. Sharing a room would save both of us money. Furthermore, Yuri is very much gay. Ginger looks taken aback, and says she's never met a gay person before. Not surprising, since were in the middle of the Bible Belt. She says something like, ""I go to church a lot. I don't think my Daddy would be okay with me living with gay people. I went to Baptist school."" I wanted to tell her to fuck off by then. No one was forcing her to move in with us. Eric didn't have a problem with Yuri being gay. But Ginger stayed, we set up a meeting with the landlord to sign the lease, an official moving day, and that was it.

Yuri, Eric, and I meet up a few more times before we all move in together. We text each other regularly, meet up for dinner/drinks, go to see Eric's friend's band play, and by moving day we'd gotten pretty close. Eric even introduces Yuri to Yuri's soon-to-be boyfriend. We know we're assholes for excluding Ginger, but she'd put off Yuri by her religiousness, Eric by her flirtatiousness, and me by... well, I wasn't exactly eager for her to move in with us. I justified it by thinking that since Ginger was under twenty-one, she couldn't get into the places we went to.

About three weeks had passed since we saw Ginger by moving day. Eric had gotten to the apartment very early morning, and was finished with his belongings by the time Yuri and I arrived. Eric helped us with our stuff, and we were almost done by the time Ginger and her family arrived. Ginger was the only one out of all of us who came with a U-Haul. Ginger's mother, father, and brothers carried everything to her room. Like Ginger's mother, they were very nice and polite, not at all huge gaping wastes of space. Yuri and I were giggling about how it looked as if everything Ginger owned was bought from Hot Topic. Goth Hello Kitty, Edward from Twilight bedspreads, and a cut-out of Taylor Lautner. I'm not even kidding. Shortly after, Eric had to leave for work. Ginger and I were downstairs when he headed off. Eric hugged and playfully pecked me on the cheek, and politely said goodbye to Ginger. Ginger did not look pleased.

Ginger snacked on baked Lays chips as her family brought in her stuff. She said she was trying to get healthier. That explains why she ate only two family size bags of the stuff. I'd also been on kind of a health kick that summer and cut out rice and bread, so I'd lost some weight and it showed. Ginger apparently noticed. Very snootily, she asked why I felt like I had to lose weight. I replied that I weighed more than I did last year, and I wanted to shed those pounds. Ginger rolled her eyes. “You know Lulu, don't have to lose weight to get noticed by a guy,” she said to me. “Guys like curvy girls. You're a girl, you should embrace what God gave you.” You think God gave you all that? I laughed it off and said I wasn't doing it to attract a man. Ginger looked like she didn't believe me. “Please. As if you're not doing all of this for Eric. That's really misogynistic of you.” I don't think that word means what you think it means, I thought, but I didn't say that to her. Ginger added, “Besides, I don't think Eric thinks of you like that.” Eric, who you've barely talked to? I just laughed and walked away.

This was the beginning of our year with Ginger. Yes, it got worse from there. It was barely noon. The day was not yet over.

1376243160.0	1k5jhv	Scooter Beast taken down at Wal Mart	boin-loins	682	109	86	"As a healthcare worker, I get to interact with a lot of hamplanets and get to hear a lot of fatlogic and I'm sure I will be able to come up with some stories to post here later.  However, this is a quick story about what I consider to be the best trip I ever made to Wal Mart:

My son and I were loading our mostly healthy, trying-not-to-catch-the-beetus foods into our car after we were done shopping and I noticed that there was a station wagon pulled up to the front door of the store because, you know, walking to your car to unload just isn't a thing for some people.  

So, while blocking the doors, I see two extra-large adults loading two carts' worth of no doubt beetus-coma-inducing foods into the back and a young child climbing into the back seat of the car (this is important).  While this is happening, a guy I'll call Scooter Beast (think 350 to 400 lbs)  has decided to entertain himself by driving said scooter rapidly around the crosswalk area in circles, nearly mowing down several people attempting to enter and exit the store, all the while, laughing and just generally having a grand old time.  

Anyone see where this is going?  Anyone remember the kid in the backseat?

Now, I'd like to think the kid did this on purpose, but I really think that maybe just once the (non-ham) planets aligned and cosmic justice was dished out, even if it was just a small helping.  For suddenly, with the perfect timing of a well-orchestrated ballet, the rear door of the car flung open just as Scooter Beast was rounding the corner and --WHAM!-- he slammed into the inside of the car door, causing the scooter to come to a very unexpected, very abrupt halt.  This, in turn, caused an upset in the Beast's equilibrium, which then caused him to slide, slowly at first, and then with an impressive speed, off the left side of the scooter and down onto the pavement, where he lay jiggling and quaking, still looking surprised.  

When I drove out of the parking lot, the two other adults were helping Scooter Beast dust himself off, or at least I think that's what was going on, since my eyes were still filled with tears from laughing. 

TL;DR:  Fatty is being obnoxious and nearly running people over on scooter.  Wrecks scooter and falls on ground.

1367946803.0	1dvev0	"""People hate me because I'm fat!"""	None4GretchenWieners	731	162	182	"Happy Tuesday fatties! This story is more from my days in the coffee shop mentioned in my [last story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dt1cj/lardzilla_needs_her_beetusjuice/), except this one is about the aforementioned A, my hammy coworker and queen of entitlement and fatlogic. This is the time I went full-on bitch mode on A because she pushed me over the edge and there wasn't a single other person in the place. This ended up being way longer than I intended, but hey, more calories for you fatties. And here we go...

Still be me, 18, 5'8”, ~170 lbs, about a month into my employment at the coffee shop. I gained a bit of weight my last semester of high school because stress-eating and not enough exercise. At this point I was working two jobs (was still working at the grocery store) in order to save some money to get a laptop so I could be on the internet in peace at home (my parents apparently had nothing better to do than hover over my shoulder if I went on the family computer, so I never did unless they weren't home), fill out job applications in private, and have it for college when I decided to go. Don't be A, 5'2”, 220 lbs of fatlogic.

In the first week of working with A, I quickly learned that she was quite disliked by the customers as she never, ever spoke one word to them, and she was very disliked by others who had to work with her because the only thing she ever did was make the espresso drinks, eat, complain about how her life is soooooo hard, and text. Now, we were allowed certain foods for free like the muffins, assorted croissants, donuts, cookies, etc. but we had to pay for the special kinds of cookies and anything that required heating before eating such as the bagel dogs and quiches. Over the course of the first hour or two of working (depending on how busy it was), A would eat one of almost every cold item in our case. That's roughly 4 muffins, 5 croissants, 2 donuts, and 4 cookies. She would also drink some super large and fatty milkshake-like concoction to wash it all down. I think it was something like milk, ice cream, chocolate syrup, caramel syrup, a single shot of espresso, and more ice cream, and it was all put into a 24oz cup. Gross. To top it off, her stepdad always brought in McBeetus for her around 9am every morning, her brother always brought in Gag in the Bag around noon, and just as she's getting off at 3pm her best friend (who was of small moon status) brought in a metric fuckton of chili dogs and fries from Weinersnitchel. And did I mention she always drank diet soda with these meals? Tee motha fuckin hee.
 
Back to the story. The customers of the shop quickly take a liking to me as I am generally friendly and talkative, and I am also good at reading body language and facial expressions so I know who wants to be talked to more and who doesn't. This results in some nice personal tips, which we were allowed to accept, so I'm happy especially since it helps a lot with affording a laptop. I can see A getting grumpier by the day, she see me as a threat since I'm technically making more money than her, and our boss didn't make us report personal tips. Let me take a second here to mention that the tip jar never ever had more than a couple dollars in it while A worked. People don't tip rudeness. Every time I talk with a customer, A audibly huffs and sulks. By this time, I am more than sick of A's constant complaining, she is always bitching about “hard” her life is, how much her mother is a bitch and how is was just so awful living with her (her mom didn't even make her do chores, wtf) so she moved out. A's mom isn't a bitch, she is a really nice lady and she pays for half (if not more) of A's rent, she buys A food for her fridge and cupboards, and she even takes A's dirty clothes to the laundromat and does her laundry for her. A is also always bitching about having to buy new clothes because the ones she has get too small for her within 6 or so months, and she blames it on her mom shrinking her clothes in the wash to try to make her lose weight when in reality she is just getting visibly fatter by the month. Porkplanets gonna pork.

On this particular day, A looks like she's ready to just break down and cry. I don't ask, I know I'm going to hear about it anyway. Once I'm clocked in and doing the normal first shift stuff such as brewing coffee, filling the condiment bars, and taking the chairs off the tables, A starts in with me.

A: “I can't believe how shallow people are. They make me so mad, but I just can't do anything about it.”

MFW it's 6:15am aka too damn early for this shit so I just keep quiet and continue getting shit done before any customers come in. A of course isn't helping because she's just too damn special.

A: “I SAID--”

“I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID,” I cut her off, “it's too damn early A and you aren't doing jack shit to help get this place open for business, so either help out or shut up.”

A keeps talking of course. “I personally don't see why people like you so much, you're such a skinny privileged bitch. I can tell they like you but they don't like me. They obviously like you because you are skinny and quite obviously bulimic. Society doesn't like big, healthy, curvy girls. They even give you money for being so skinny and unhealthy! It just isn't fair. I shouldn't have to have an eating disorder like you just so people will like me!”

By this time I am done setting up the place for business but I don't unlock the doors yet. There isn't anyone outside and I don't want anyone walking in hearing this shit anyway. I am so sick of fatties telling me I am anorexic or bulimic. I mean seriously, what the actual fuck, I'm not even skinny, but even if I was, it's not their place to comment on someone else's weight.

Me: “Look, A, people don't dislike you because you're big, they dislike you because you don't ever talk to them. You just make their drink, hand it to them, and turn away. You could at least smile a bit or even say 'Have a good day!' Even if you don't mean it, pretend like you do, they just want to feel like you appreciate their business. Instead, I can see in their eyes they're thinking 'Wow, sorry I'm bothering you with MY MONEY.' The other employees don't like you because you don't do jack shit aside from working the espresso machine. No one cares about your personal life, I sure as hell know way too much about you and I've only been here a month. Does your mom even know how you talk about her? Do you think she would still pay half your rent, buy you food, and do your laundry if she could her the shit that comes out of your mouth? Also, here you are preaching some 'body acceptance' shit and yet you're shaming me about my weight, and I'm not even skinny. Fuck logic. You really think you're healthy? Don't even get me started on your so-called 'health'.”

A: “I'm just not a morning person! And--”

Me: “Then why are you working the morning shift? There is a night shift position available, ask for that instead.”

A: “I can't work that late because (insert lame crappy excuse here), and what do you mean, my 'so-called health'?”

Me: “I mean that you don't eat healthy in any sense of the word. Pastries and milkshakes for breakfast, pink slime for mid-morning 'snack' and lunch, and more pink slime for mid-afternoon 'snack'. I don't even want to know what you eat when you go home for the day. You can't call yourself healthy when you eat like that and don't exercise at all.”

A: “But I have hypothyroidism! I need to eat throughout the day so my thighroid doesn't flare up and I pass out!”

Oh you dumb bitch, that is not even close to how hypothyroidism works. But I decide to not go there.

Me: “Look, I don't care what your excuse is, there are much healthier food options such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts that don't require any cooking. You could bring those in tupperware containers and keep them under the counter or in the employee mini fridge for when you're hungry. The grocery stores even sell stuff that's pre-cut so you don't even have to spend any time preparing your food. Look, the bottom line here is that people don't care if you're fat, if you were nice they would like you. But you aren't nice and you live in your own little world of entitlement, so of course people aren't going to like you. And don't claim to be healthy around me when all you eat is sugar, cream, and processed junk. You have no room to be calling anyone out on unhealthy eating habits.”

At this point A doesn't even know how to respond, so she just leaves, without even having touched any food yet. MFW she really just left me to run this bitch by myself. Oh well. I'm actually happy and relieved that she left, one less day of hearing her bitch and coming insanely close to shoving her out of my path because she just stands in the way while glued to her phone. I open up for business (no customers had even walked by yet, which is pretty typical as we usually didn't get our first customer until about 8:30am), work my shift, earn tips like a baus, and when my boss comes to take over so I can go home, I give him a quick explanation of why A isn't there and he just laughs, tells me he'll pay me double time for the day (which he did), lets me take all the tips from the tip jar (which was actually a lot that day), and gives me some free [Russian tea cakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_tea_cake) which I then take over to my grandma's house for our afternoon tea before I have to go to my other job. A was suspended for job abandonment and tried claiming discrimination against me in a weak attempt to get me fired but my boss said others before me had told him of her thin-shaming them so he just told her to suck it up and quit starting shit if she couldn't take it.

TL;DR Whah! My feels!

Hello my friends! I'm sorry for my absence, but I was out of commission for a little while because of a surgery (no big deal! I'm okay and back at work now!).

My first day back I was greeted with a lovely chorus of ""I missed you!"" ""I'm so glad your back!"", followed by ""YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.""

Story as follows!

&gt; Back at work after two gloriously sore and lazy weeks off

&gt; Bit slower than my old peppy self, but still all smiles and niceties

&gt; Boss catches me up on issues that have been happening since I've been gone

&gt; RW has had THIRTEEN COMPLAINTS from customers within my two week absence

&gt; And nearly DOUBLE that number of complaints from coworkers

&gt; It eventually got too much for my poor boss to handle and she ended up losing her temper

&gt; Boss has been blowing up on RW all day, trying to correct all of the bad behaviors she practices at work

&gt; Constantly on the phone with personal calls

&gt; Constantly eating

&gt; Ignoring employees that need her help

&gt; Ignoring customers that need her help

&gt; Ignoring all of the other responsibilities we're tasked with as supervisors

&gt; RW slips up *again* right in front of our boss

&gt; ""RW we JUST went over this! I don't understand how you can be so absolutely incompetent or forgetful or whatever excuse you want to give when we literally just had this conversation FIVE MINUTES AGO.""

&gt; RW pouts and pretends that she's going to cry, ""When my blood sugar gets low, it's really hard for me to concentrate! I *need* to eat properly to be able to do my job. It's because I'm *starving myself* up here that I can't remember everything!""

&gt; Boss ain't fuckin' havin' it. Not today.

&gt; ""Everyone has personal issues they have to deal with RW. You seem to be the only one special enough to think that you can use your medical condition as an excuse to be lazy. JUST DO YOUR DAMN JOB.""

Now the part I find unacceptable is that this was done in front of the entire store, coworkers and customers alike. I've been in that position (because of RW) so I still find it unacceptable but because of the recipient I also find it hilarious.

I've got another bit to post, I wanted to seperate them because the next one is ABSOLUTELY UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE. You're gonna love it.

TL;DR - See title.

&gt;[TryNotToLookLikeATerrorist.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2AmrTnT.gif)

&gt;Get to the conveyor belts.

&gt;Wait for couple to bend down and take their shoes off.

&gt;Woman behind me [physically recoils from the smell.](http://i.imgur.com/SEpCU.gif)

&gt;Waiting in line to go into the body scanner.

&gt;Pack of wildobese in front of me. Momma wildobese approaches the scanner.

&gt;TSA says, ""Ma'am if you have any metallic objects on your person please remove them before entering the scanner.""

&gt;Female wildobese checks every pocket she has. Can barely hit her hands into the pockets of her denim booty-shorts.

&gt;Shake my head and look around. Over 100 people are [watching this woman](http://i.imgur.com/8TlB213.gif) waste their time waiting in a security line.

&gt;[People all around us are muttering](http://i.imgur.com/gaTSDI4.gif) but she has no clue. She walks up to the scanner.

&gt;Can't fit.

&gt;[Facepalm.png](http://i.imgur.com/yVVFM.jpg)

&gt;Tries again and again. Literally cannot fit into the TSA scanner.

&gt;TSA woman starts to smirk. Says, ""Ma'am, I can preform a manual search. Step this way.""

&gt;Wildobese starts to scream.

&gt;""I hava right, as a 'Murican ci'zen, to be treated like ever'one else!""

&gt;TSA agent [shakes her head.](http://i.imgur.com/xcMGu1a.gif) She probably doesn't get paid enough to put up with this.

&gt;""Ma'am, I won't ask you again. Please step this way.""

&gt;Wildobese stands still. She glaces around and sees a thousand glaring eyes on her. She looks at the TSA agent and stays put.

&gt;""Ma'am step this way. Now."" 

&gt;There is no quavering in the TSA woman's voice. She is about 6'1"", probably 170lbs and very muscular, and African American (this is important soon).

&gt;[Popcorn.gif](http://zeroshift.imgur.com/popcorn_gifs#17)

&gt; TSA woman grabs wildobese and tries to lead her to the manual search station.

&gt;Suddenly everything explodes.

&gt;Wildobese male screams, ""Get your hands off my wife you ghetto trash!"" and charges at the agent.

&gt;Entire room recoils but wants to know what happens next.

&gt;TSA agent pulls out his radio and screams, ""We have a situation at the security checkpoint. Requesting backup now.""

(I honestly don't remember what he said. It was something along those lines, but I'm completely paraphrasing.)

&gt;TSA woman pulls out her baton, and yells, ""Back the fuck up."" Very loud, but commanding and almost calmly.

&gt;2 Additional TSA agents run up and subdue the man while the TSA woman tends to the female.

&gt;More TSA show up. They form a temporary perimeter around the scene and the two wildobeses are lead away.

&gt;After everything was over the security line returned to normal. People in the line clap and I get to go through the security scanner.

&gt;[MFW I had spare change in my pocket and had to exit and reenter the scanner/metal detector thing.](http://i.imgur.com/goGeYP9.gif)


**TL;DR**

TSA woman throws down with a wildobese and I have funny faces so you should just read the post.

EDIT: Removed that it was my first story. I just read the rules it's strongly not recommended. Now it's at the bottom so it's more okay!

And thank you so much to /u/Ayn_Rand_Was_Right for giving me ""wildobese"" instead of ""O-wilda-beese"". If you thought that was funny, upvote [their comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jt49p/i_never_thought_i_would_say_this_i_feel_terrible/cbi2635).

Hope your jimmies have eased since reading [part two](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f2gb2/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_part_2/). 

I was going to post this later on in the series. Because they come up to the present day (May) but I'll post it now since people are desperate to know how my broken fingers came to be, and how Porkplanet is to blame. 

&gt; Be a sunny but chilly late afternoon. Myself, AS, KK, Two other housemates, Cuteguy, his friend (who is interestred in KK) and Porkplanet at home. 

&gt; Let's go and chill down the beach and get some fresh air. 

&gt; coolok.jpeg

&gt; We all drive down in our cars. Cuteguy and two housemates all contribute £2 each for Diesal for my car since it's a 30min drive there and back. 

&gt; Porkplanet does not contribute. 

&gt; Suggests we stop on the way to get McFatty Ice Cream at McDicks. I say no. 

&gt; alreadynothappywithher.zip 

&gt; Get to beach. Tide is coming in. People are sat on rocks nearby. Ok cool. 

&gt; We find a nice patch of rock to sit on. I nestle down. 

&gt; As I am still nestling down on the rock and place my hand near the crease of the next rock to rest. 

YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

&gt; Porkplanet comes from behind. Balances on a wobbly rock. Somehow dislodges several smaller rocks  behind her. Probably due to her 300lb+ mass. Her weight is literally interfearing the entropy of rocks that have been on this coast for millions of years. Changing the landscape one step at a time. 

&gt; One rock comes hurtling towards me from behind. I can't see it. 

&gt; It has the shape and size of a Rugby ball. 

&gt; The weight of a thousand suns. 

&gt; It crashes and lands directly on top of my pinky and ring finger on my right hand. 

&gt; Feel a crack.

&gt; [MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m58jqbOihk1rxckzmo1_500.gif).

&gt; I let out a scream akin to a dog whistle. 

&gt; Cannot move hand this rock is heavy. 

&gt; Blind panic. Tears within 5 seconds.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""HOLD ON DON'T MOVE YOUR HAND ILL PICK UP THE ROCK""

&gt; Me: ""HURRY I THINK SOMETHING BROKE""

&gt; She bends over. 

&gt; Her mass is not used to this unusual exercise. Weight shifts.

&gt; For milliseconds before she is able to get a full grasp on the rock to pick it up. She is leaning HER WHOLE FUCKING BODY WEIGHT ON IT.

&gt; Feel another crack. 

&gt; She's actually broken my hand.

&gt; Another dog whistle scream. 

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnbvm8FoXm1qhafj6.gif) my two fingers are visibly broken.

&gt; [MF](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2pjb7hXN91r9dhud.gif) all the way to the hospital. 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.katesullivanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr-gif-shocked-i7.gif) I'm sat in the hospital an hour later and Porkplanet, completely uncaring to  the fact she just broke my fingers, asks if we can stop at McDicks on the way home. 

&gt; Telling the nurse ""I HAVEN'T EEEEEATEN ALL DAY I FEEL WEAK"".

&gt;  Nurse: I'm sure you'll survive another hour our two. 

&gt; [OFW.](http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3623/nnmdd0jpg.gif) 

&gt; FIN. 

So there you have it. The story of how my fingers broke and how Porkplanet is to blame. Hope it rustled your jimmies. Though  it was a harmless accident and she didn't mean it, her not really caring afterwards didn't help the situation at all. 

**TLDR; Porkplanet comes to beach with us. Walking over rocks. Dislodges a rock 'cause she's a supernova. Rock lands on my hand. She proceeds to crush fingers further. We go to hospital. She doesn't care. Wants a McDicks.**

Oooooooh my rustling jimmies, how they quiver and jiggle! I can hardly contain them! But let me assure you, in the aftermath of the Fatmate, our jimmies were still a rustling. I needed my jimmies soothed, and this came in the form of my friend TechGuy. TG is a dude, builds custom console and desktop cases etc. He is legendary. He moved into Beetus's old room at his old apartment.

The people in that apartment are B, awesome, partially blind, health problems, but sound individual. And TG. Let me take you all the way back to just before Beetus moved in with us.

&gt;Be Beetus.

&gt;Be a total douche canoe

&gt;be announcing you're moving out. Give move out day of March 1st.

Landlady was still having the place renovated, and due to some construction delays, we postponed move in date until April 1st officially, but we'd have access to the flat to move in from the week prior. We tell Beetus this so he can pass the information along to his soon to be former flatmates.

&gt;Beetus doesn't.

Beetus just keeps on staying in the flat, does't move out.

B is all like ""Beetus, what's going on? You said you were moving out on March 1st."" This is because TG has shown up at the flat with all his belongings and is wondering why he doesn't have a bedroom. Beetus just mutters something about ""delays"" and goes and locks himself in his room.

Now one might think, ok, if Beetus is uncooperative and hasn't packed his shit up, eventually you wait until he's out of the house, binbag everything and put it in the hallway so the person who's paying rent for that room can move in. But Beetus's beady eyes were narrowed and suspicious. He takes time off work so he doesn't have to leave his room so he can stop them doing this. He orders his groceries in, so he doesn't have to leave the flat.

Finally, move in day happens, we have the keys, Spouse-a-tron sent me away because apparently he had a 'system' for packing and he didn't want me in the way, also the dust and grit from moving would have played up my asthma something awful, and he didn't want to jeopardize my health or risk a hospital trip. So I went off to hang with friends for a couple of days to avoid the grit. (Trust me I tried to stay, but firmly got told no.)

Our friend with a car lends us his boot space to start hefting things across, Spouse-a-tron and Car Guy (CG) head to Beetus's flat to pick up him and his stuff.

&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/vgnkT.gif) Beetus hasn't even packed.

&gt;[TG and B's](http://i.imgur.com/WsPEw.gif) faces when he's still in his room playing games.

&gt;Beetus isn't even worried that he hasn't packed.

&gt;Like a boss, Spouse-a-tron organizes everything into pack up mode.

&gt;TG and B join in to get Beetus out as quickly as possible.

&gt;B and TG even phones up friends to make it go faster.

&gt;Beetus does nothing, says **""It's muh asthma...it's muh *condition*""**

Everything is binbagged and boxed and finally loaded into car.

Beetus demands car comes back to pick him up even though new apartment is 15 minutes walk from the old one.

&gt;[TG and B's farewell to Beetus](http://i.imgur.com/SWRps.gif)

Back to Afterfat. Beetus has been effectively kicked out of our house. I hang out with TG and B at their flat. TG is showing me custom Iron Man helmet he's making.

&gt;Impressed

&gt;It's amazing.

&gt;Conversation moves to telling TG how Beetus left our abode last week.

&gt;TG gives me a hug

&gt;says ""I'm so glad you guys twigged on, I don't know you lasted that long!""

&gt;[wut](http://i.imgur.com/vqzVz.gif)

&gt;TG points to walls of his room.

&gt;""I had to replaster everything after Beetus moved out. Sure it's an old building, but the walls had holes in them that weren't there when he moved in. And rotten. Mouldy. Things growing in them. I had to gut the whole room and redo it all out of my own pocket. The bed was even broken.""

&gt;Beetus had industrial sized super hefty wooden bed frame.

""The mattress was pretty much rotted through too. B said it was brand new when Beetus moved in.""

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/8aKqa.gif)

&gt;NOPENOPENOPE.

TG shows me the pantry and kitchen cupboards, very obviously replastered and some doors and backboards replaced.

""Those were his food cupboards, had perishable food with expiration dates months old in them. Full of rats, we had to get pest control in.""

Brand new freezer.

""Beetus would bring home all these frozen dinners from work, say he was eating healthy and it was all vegetarian weight watchers stuff. He'd put it in the freezer and forget about it. The freezer eventually conked out because it was a solid frozen block of ice that froze the door shut, and destroyed the interior plastic lining.""

&gt;Another thing they had to replace out of their own pocket.

""What did he eat then?""

""He'd order takeout while he thought we were asleep thinking we wouldn't notice or hear, and claim that it was a 'cheat' day for his health diet. Or work was just so hard that day that he didn't have the energy to cook. lived on takeaway pizzas and chips.""

&gt;Anyone wonder why Beetus was 300lbs+?

&gt;I DON'T.

TG showed me the carpet on the floor of the living room. There was a stained rectangle where a sofa had been. Apparently this wasn't colour fade, it was an impenetrable grease stain from the greasy pizza boxes he'd just just shove under the sofa. Sometimes with bits of pizza crust he hadn't inhaled still in it. It rotted and moulded and stained the carpet right down to the floorboards. Pulling the carpet up, there was this ugly black stain to the wood. They'd bleached and scrubbed but it wouldn't come out. They were waiting to hear back from the landlord about getting the carpet replaced.

Back to the kitchen.

&gt;Be B

&gt;Be Hypoglycemic

&gt;be gluten allergic

&gt;be partially blind

&gt;be still a sound dude

&gt;be having separate toasters and bread and toastie makers for gluten free things.

Beetus used to eat my special dairy free cheese, and replace it with regular mozzarella in the wrapper. I love mozzarella, but I am hella lactose intolerant. It took me a while to figure out why I was reacting to the non dairy cheese like it was really dairy. Turns out Beetus did this with B's gluten free stuff. Eat the gluten free bagels, put regular bagels in the packet. Use the gluten free toaster to toast his regular gluten sammiches.

&gt;B has had allergic reactions to this.

&gt;No hospital visits AFAIK, but still some pretty bad attacks.

When asked what the hell, the Gluten Free toaster has ""GLUTEN FREE ONLY"" on the side in big sharpie letters, Beetus would shrug and say *""TEEHEE, I DIDN'T REALIZE. I AM BLIND YOU KNOW.""**

&gt;Beetus has glasses, and is a bit short sighted.

&gt;B is actually legally blind and wears an eyepatch over one eye because no sight.

&gt;B often upset by insensitive comments like this.

I mention the consoles being on all the time and our electrical bills

&gt;TG rolls his eyes.

&gt;When Beetus first moved in, he made the electrical bill in his name.

&gt;fairenough.jpeg

&gt;When Beetus moved out they asked him to switch the account over to their names.

&gt;Beetus to my knowledge, still hasn't done it at time of posting.

&gt;Beetus ran up bills of 300 quid and refused to pay any more than 50 quid because when he moved in they estimated electricity would be around 100 quid a month, and it was ""unfair"".

&gt;Nobody else in the flat had a console

&gt;as B has trouble seeing, his laptop is rarely on.

**Side note, this is a 2 bedroom flat that only Beetus and B lived in until the last month before Beetus moved out and TG was sleeping on the couch because Beetus wouldn't pack up and move out.

&gt;TG and B have had to open up a new account in their names, and Electrical company is now basically double monitering their flat, and racking up a bill in Beetus's name that they're chasing him down for, and the account that TG and B have is up to date and super hunky dory.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/5SX0z.gif)

&gt;allofmynope.avi

Beetus apparently took a bunch of TG's games ""by accident"" when he moved out, and conveniently forgot to give them back. TG ain't mad, he got free replacements somewhere.

Two weeks later Beetus rang Spouse-a-tron at work and said he forgot some things in the house. Spouse-a-tron told him he'd have to ring me because he was at work and I was the only one home.

Beetus would apparently rather lose his stuff than speak to me so he never got in contact.

We ebayed it.

No fucks given.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR**

Beetus caused around a thousand quid in damage to his old apartment, fucked over his flatmates, engaged in dick behaviour, and purposely fucked with his flatmate's dietary allergies because ""TEEHEE OOPSIE"""	t5_2vzax	True

1369543754.0	1f2gb2	Porkplanet Housemate: Chapter One, Part 2: Porkplanet cries, breaks stuff in the nightclub and pukes all over herself.	imgonnamakeit	771	209	162	"Thank you all for the lovely comments on [part one](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f267s/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_pt1_the_night_out/). I was going to wait till tomorrow to post part two, because it's hard to type at the moment two fingers down (broke fingers, blame Porkplanet partly, story coming soon) but I couldn't resist.

Part 2

&gt; Porkplanet has just rolled (literally) into the kitchen and into the party wearing the same exact outfit as me I bought that day. 

&gt; Ex boyfriend comes up from behind and whispers in my ear that we should come home together tonight. Ew.

&gt; iseriouslydontneedallofthisfuckeryhappeningtonight.rar

&gt;  AS: Don't let it bother you. This is what she wants. Let it go. You look fabulous and she looks horrendous. Fuck knows what she was thinking. 

So for about an hour, I did let it go. At 11.30pm, Porkplanet howls like a bitch in heat that the taxis have arrived to take us to the club we were heading to. Since there was about 20 of us, we (the housemates) let everyone else leave first in cabs and get the last cab. In the last cab, it's me, AS, KK and Porkplanet, a long with another friend. Up until this point, she's ignored me the whole night. 

&gt; Porkplanet (squeezing her ginormous arse into the cab) ""I can't wait to daaaaance!""

&gt; Me (drunken slip): ""Nice fucking dress, Porkplanet"". 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I didn't know you had the same outfit as me"". 

&gt; Me: ""Yes you fucking did.  You were there when I bought the whole outfit.  You went back and bought the same. 

&gt; AS: ""SHE'S FUCKING JEALOUS!!""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""NO I'M NOT. ME AND IMGONNAMAKEIT ARE BASICALLY THE SAME SIZE ANYWAY.""

&gt; AS: ""WHAT?!""

&gt; She doesn't know that there's a 50lb (3 stone, 22kg) difference between us at least, as she is gaining daily and I am losing. 

&gt; Taxi driver: ""STOP SHOUTING.""

We sat there in silence for the whole cab drive. After five minutes, Porkplanet starts quietly sobbing. I feel like crying, too, because of exboyfriend and her little act but I decide to suck it in. I'm no longer feeling fabulous and want to go home. We pay the cab and get out and join the line for the club. It's a 20 minute weight and it's almost 12 at night in January but luckily Porkplanet and I have our LOVELY AND MATCHING leather jackets to keep us warm.

&gt; Porkplanet (still sobbing, drunk and snorting to herself): ""I'm sorry."" 

&gt; Me: ""If you wanted this dress you should of said""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I just wanted to look pretty like you do tonight"". 

&gt; Me (lying) ""You do look pretty"" (I'm going to hell) ""but it wasn't cool of you to invite exboyfriend"". 

&gt; Porkplanet (perking up) ""I miss you and exboyfriend. You two were a cute couple. I thought since mutualfriend was coming, he could come too.""

&gt; ummmok.org

So there we have it. From sobbing in the back of a cab to making up outside the club in 10 minutes. *Best friends, best friends, never ever break friends*. We finally get into the club. I see friends at bar. We walk over. Porkplanet spots pole dancing pole on platform near the dancefloor. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Look a pole! We're getting on that later"". 

&gt; No fucking chance babe. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""We'll see"". 

We all dance and stay near the bar for the next hour. Porkplanet is getting drunker and drunker, making a complete ass of herself and grinding against exboyfriend. I'm getting a bit of attention myself from cuteguy friend who's on my course, who I've been flirting with for a while. He's buying me drinks and we're chatting and the butterflies are fluttering. He says how good I look and asks about my workout routine. Says he'll join me at the Gym next week since he hasn't worked out in a while. 

&gt;  idratherwegohomeandworkoutrightnowrawr.exe 

Suddenly, a wild (and drunken) KK appears and pulls me aside. 
&gt; KK: ""Porkplanet is wrecked. AS is puking up in the loo. We need to go home. It's crap here""

&gt; Me: Agreed. 

&gt; KK: ""I'll round up AS and the other girls, they're outside. You try and persuade Porkplanet since I've just told her we should head home and she doesn't want to"". 

&gt; Me: challengeaccepted.rar 

I turn around. Pork planet is gone. So is exboyfriend, cuteguy and two other friends we were stood nearby. I look over the sea of heads on the dancefloor. And it doesn't take me long until I realize where Porkplanet is. 

&gt; She's climbing the platform and she's about to get on the pole dancing pole. 

&gt; Me (after sprinting over to the platform): ""Porkplanet, we're going home, the girls are bored here and AS is drunk. We'll get food on the way"". (easy tactic: food) 

&gt; Porkplant: ""But I'm showing the boys my pole dancing moves teeheee"". 

&gt; Me: ""You're embarassing yourself. We're going"". 

&gt; Cuteguy (approaching): ""Are we all going back to yours for more drinks and some food?""

&gt; Me: ""Well it wasn't the plan, but you can come"" 

&gt; everythingisturningoutgreatafterall.gif

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I love this song"" (swings around on pole with one arm) 

&gt; Me: ""We're going!"" 

&gt; Porkplanet falls swinging to the other side of the pole and almost launches herself off the platform

&gt; I come closer and realize she's BENT THE POLE IN THE MIDDLE. 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""OH MY GOD""

&gt; Me (to Porkplanet): ""You've bent the fucking pole. Quickly come on and let's  go before anyone notices it and you get into trouble""

The crowd around the platform on the dance floor notice what she's done. Visibly laughing at her. 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""It's screwed into the platform and the ceiling. How the fuck did you manage that? did you bend the ceiling  down too?!""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Shut the fuck up cuteguy it was already brokeennnnnn!"".
 
We all manage to get outside. Finally, after about  10 minutes of trying to waddle Porkplanet through the jam packed club. We make it outside and Porkplanet immediately heads towards the kebab and burger van parked about 20ft away from the club entrance. She's visibly hammered. AS is sat on the curb and hammered. KK is hammered. Exboyfriend who I don't even know why  is still hanging around us is still hammered. Friends and other housemates are hammered. Porkplanet is screaming drunkingly from the kebab van that she's got me cheese on chips. I then feel sick to my stomach and realize that I'm partially hammered too. 

I realize cuteguy is also hammered but holding me by my side whilst we wait for Porkplanet. Whispers he'll share the cheesy chips with me and kisses me on the neck. 

&gt; weneedtogethomerightfuckingnow.raw

Porkplanet waddles back. Everyone is flagging down cabs. We're the last to get in one. Me, KK, Porkplanet and Cuteguy are in. There are extra seats as it's an 8-seater cab.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Ex boyfriend. Get in"". 

Exboyfriend grins and gets in. Grinning at me. I don't think he realizes cuteguy who is sat between KK and I is going home with me, he thinks he's going home with KK. Oh god this is horrible.

Porkplanet hands me my tray of cheesy chips and opens up her food. The smell fills the cab immediately. She has a donor kebab in pita bread, salad (the irony) and it's absolutely drenched in garlic mayonnaise and chilli sauce. I feel sick. But she's plowing it in. 

&gt; KK: ""Slow down eating that, jesus christ"" (Still visibly annoyed with Porkplanet over the outfit saga) 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I'm STAAAAAAAARVING I NEED TO EAT""

The inevitable happens. The taxi driver speeds up. And she starts coughing. 

&gt; Me: ""Breathe porkplanet. Take a breather and stop shoving it all in"". 

She's coughing harder. Garlic mayo is spitting everywhere. Exboyfriend is sat next to her so is slapping her back folds. KK is not even helping she's laughing. Cuteguy is just sat there eating my cheesy chips. I don't  even know what's happening anymore.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I'm dying"". 
&gt; Me: ""You're fine. You just inhaled garlic mayo Porkplanet.""

She suddenly starts wretching because she's coughed so much. Porkplanet is a 20 a day smoker (like I was) and doesn't have the pipes to cough up the mayo that's lining her wind pipe. 

I know she's gonna blow. 

She wretches so hard she throws up into her food, all over her hands, her dress (haha bitch) and the floor. 

&gt; Taxi Driver: ""That's gonna be £20 extra if you don't clean that up when we get to your house"".
 
&gt; I am done and this is the worst night ever. 

We eventually get home. I pay the cab driver. Everyone embarks on the house. I have to go back out with paper towels and kitchen cleaner and clean the back of the cab because Porkplanet is too drunk and still spewing everywhere in the house and being a mess. Exboyfriend has causally let himself into the house. So has cuteguy. I'm screaming a cursing in the street cleaning this cab because Porkplanet managed to get some puke all over the back of my leather jacket when waddling out of the cab. 

I go inside. Spend 30 minutes helping AS, Porkplanet and other drunk roommate get into PJ's and stop puking long enough to get into bed and sleep. Go downstairs and. KK is sleeping in my bed, cuteguy has fallen asleep on our couch and exboyfriend has fallen asleep in the kitchen on a chair. 

Porkplanet wakes up next morning hangover-free, pretending like she doesn't remember anything and that she didn't ruin everyone's night.

FIN. 

**TLDR; Porkplanet is called out for wearing exact same outfit as me. Cries. We make up. She makes fool of herself in club. Bends a pole dancing pole. Invites ex boyfirend home. Vomits on herself in cab and basically cock-blocks me.**** 

Thank you everyone for being so encouraging in Part 1! 

I hope Part 2 delivered.

1369346906.0	1exkis	Fatties Love to Talk About Boobs	A_fat_day	668	106	177	"For some reason, most of my friends last year were overweight. I dealt with fatlogic all the time. I am female, 5'4'', 120 lbs, and played varsity soccer. This is a tale of how I finally broke free of hamplanets' criticism on my (perfectly healthy) body.

I had to endure the endless teasing that this group of women directed towards me just to remain friends with them. One example of this happened when I was walking with one Hammy downtown, going to buy dresses for a dance we were both attending.

""I like the dress you're wearing now,"" Hammy told me. I thought she was being nice, until she added, ""Except it is really obvious you don't have any boobs!""

""Um, I do have boobs,"" I replied, jimmies definitely rustled. I wore between a 32b and 32c.

""No you don't, you're tiny and you don't have boobs. Stop getting so offended. I'm just stating the truth.""

I had a bad temper, and these girls tested it everyday.

Finally during the summer, a few of us got together to go clubbing, and something happened. Clubbing is not my favorite activity, but my friends would buy me drinks, so I didn't complain. I wore a pink minidress and heels, and I felt great. Leave it to MamaHam (we actually called her Mama), the second largest and the oldest one, to try to ruin the night for me.

A girl with us sighed dramatically as we all did makeup and hair in the same bathroom.

""Ugh, this shirt compresses my boobs so much.""

""Don't worry,"" MamaHam assured her. ""A_fat_day has no boobs...And guys still like her!""

The girl looked surprised but comforted. ""Yeah,"" she said, ""I used to be a B cup. But I couldn't stand having no boobs, so I got implants.""

""I like having small boobs,"" I said, a little angrily. I was drinking beer, so I couldn't be too upset. My jimmies were intoxicated.

When we finally set out to the club, my confidence was a little shot. Things completely turned around once we filed onto the dance floor, however. Amongst the loud music, beer sloshing everywhere, sweat dripping, makeup running, and screaming, I was approached by a ton of guys. I danced victoriously the entire night, for hours. And MamaHam? Who was she approached by?

One guy. One guy that she was appalled by. And why was she appalled? Because he was fat.

I was finally victorious that day, and the girls backed off the criticism momentarily.

Not for long, though, not for long. MamaHam came up with many excuses for that night's lack of guys for herself:

* It was a bad club
* I danced more provocatively than she did
* It was just because I was a redhead

I have since transferred schools. I don't have any hamplanet friends there, and as a result, no one publicly discusses my breasts."	t5_2vzax	True
1376393360.0	1k9sny	Living With Jacob Prt 3: Learning on what he believes is an ideal lifestlye	matt78whoop	718	155	192	"Lot's of you said it would be better if i typed it out on this format so here is is and I gave a quick recount on what the situation was for those who missed it
Here's [part 1](http://redd.it/1k79gq) and [Part 2](http://redd.it/1k79gq) if you would like to read my other stoires
This is the story of my fat roommate Jacob and the daily occurrences the happened when I lived with him during my first year in University

&gt;Jacob was a 400lb 5’8 planet of a person. Constantly had Acne and believed showers were an optional occurrence . He had appetite that would put hippos to shame


&gt;He blocked the toilet the first day he moved in and on the second day ate 1kg of beacon and 10 eggs before consuming all the food I had brought believing we were sharing food


&gt;Also he out Brony  posters and Anime posters in our hallway and threaten to kick me out if I said anything about it to the University 


&gt;This is the story of what he did all day and how he believed that he was in fact good shape despite being unable to climb one flight of stairs without  losing his breathe and needing to eat a packet of chips for energy to carry on


&gt;Wake up on the third day of being in my new living arrangement


&gt;Layed back aussie bro so almost any shit couldn’t bother me in the slightest 


&gt;Jacob on the other hand was the biggest bitch you could ever imagine 


&gt;Claimed the apartment  was always to hot and it was making him sweat 


&gt;Insisted that we needed to keep the apartment  at a maximum of 18°C which for Aussies is colder than most winter days 


&gt;Don’tgiveafuck.gif


&gt;I just got a new job at the local supermarket so I wouldn’t even be using the place much


&gt;The one plus about Jacob was though he did bring a 50inch Tv to the apartment 


&gt;great I thought  AFL will be great to watch on this


&gt;oh how wrong I was 


&gt;This guy would probably watch Tv 24/7 if he didn’t need to sleep 10 hours of day 


&gt;Every day it was one of two things fucking My Little Pony or Anime where the characters have huge eyes and always over react to littlest thing to the point where it was unbearable to watch


&gt;Jacob pretty much became stuck to the couch


&gt;notevenjoking.pdf


&gt;The combination of him sweating more than a greasy wog at Bondi, the fact it was a leather couch and he insisted on wearing shirts with either Pony’s on them or catchphrases like “you mad bro ur gf is mirin” that were a size or 4 to small made him stick to the couch. 


&gt;When he got up it was like ripping duct tape off a wall 


&gt;I like to think of myself as a moderately fit person who likes to lift and exercise 


&gt;So I ask him “why don’t you come to the gym with me or do some exercise instead of watching TV it’ll be good for you man”


&gt;”I don’t need to exercise, I’ve been told I have a high metabolism so I don’t need to and anyway I don’t want to get skinny like you girls won’t find me attractive 


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/wAS8FDG)


&gt;He believe his excuse for eating 24/7 and never doing anything is that he has a high metabolism despite having diabetes at 19 and not being able to walk to the fridge without panting 


&gt;”Umm are you sure man I don’t think it works that way you need to do an equal amount of exercise to burn the calories you eat”


&gt;”What would you know mum and dad have told me and they know best that I’m healthy and have a high metabolism that’s why I’m able to eat hat ever I want and never get fat


&gt;At this point I walk out of the room try to contain myself from pissing my pants 


&gt;hear the rustle of him opening another packet of chips to consume while I decide there and then I need to go for a run to ensure his fucktard logic doesn’t infect me 

There is my Story for today /fatpeoplestories I'll post more if I have time

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spouse-a-tron and I are going away for the weekend for a LRP event. We'll be spending the weekend at a scout camp running through mucky forests and fields, rolling in mud and beating each other with special latex weapons. (Different from what you'd normally picture as Boffa weapons, which are rolls of dryer foam wrapped around dowel rods and duct tapes. Not so safe. Our weapons look much more realistic.)

&gt;Beetus has decided he is going with mumsy dearest and his three sisters to the Lake District for the week

&gt;we've had the house to ourselves since Monday

&gt;It's now Friday and we're packed up and ready to go.

I make a last check through the house and that smell is emanating through the house from Beetus's room. It's the smell of nope and despair. A sad pathetic smell that says ""I have no girlfriend and I never will."" We almost feel bad for him. Almost. He's not scheduled to be back until Monday, we'll be back Sunday night.

&gt;executive decision made

Let's give his room an airing. I carefully jump in and have to climb over the bed to reach the window so I can raise the blind and open it just a crack. We have someone house sitting, they'll be able to keep an eye on the place so noone breaks in through our upstairs window. Immediately there's a huge difference in the air quality.  As I will myself not to pass out, I notice the mattress doesn't even have a protector on it. What horrors has it seen the poor thing? The mould on the walls starts retracting down the walls shying away from the light. Beetus has also left his computers, ps3 and xbox on again.

&gt;&gt;Lookit there

&gt;&gt;must have been a power outtage.

&gt;&gt;TEEHEE.MOTHERFUCKER

We leave, arrive on site. All goes well, killing me some orcs and zombies and dragons, enjoying rousing games of ""knock the pint off the giant's head"" and trying Goblin Brave Juice (Super chilli vodka).  I get a subtle ""COME HERE"" gesture from Spouse-a-tron, to come to our room. He's holding his phone at a distance, and even over the noise and rumble in the other room, I can hear screaming on the phone.

""Who is it?""

&gt;3 guesses.

&gt;it's not the Queen telling me I'm a lost member of the Royal Family.

&gt;Nor is it the President awarding me a Medal of Honour for having to endure Beetus.

&gt;It's Beetus.

Beetus is screaming and has been so for the past 25 minutes about how I have invaded his privacy and gone through his stuff. Seems he came home early from the Lake District, kicked out the house sitter (who was a down on their luck friend we were letting stay with us until they got arranged a new apartment.) Apparently I broke things and rummaged through everything.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/rHzXM.gif) he's threatening lawsuit

&gt;Yeah right. Bitchplease.asianguy

Landlady, as previously mentioned is a boss. Total fucking class A winning lady. She's totally 100% quick on the uptake, aware of what Beetus is like. In fact, he's made some classic sexist comments to her such as when she invited us over for dinner, she told us she was making beef curry and we got excited because she makes excellent curry. His reaction? **""Big fucking whoop, some chick making food, it's not like that doesn't ever happen.""** muttered under his breath so loud I'm pretty sure the house next door heard it.

So she's been itching for an excuse to give him the official boot for some time.

We quell his russling jimmies and say we'll talk about it when we get home, say we let our friend house sit for us, and they're meant to be staying at least until we get back, if Beetus kicks him out again, we're having serious discussions about flatmate status.

His jimmies are only briefly restrained. We hurried home the next afternoon. Beetus is squealing that we didn't clear anything with him.

&gt;I texted him about it. Asked him if he had any objections

&gt;No response

&gt;He blocked my number

&gt;I showed him text as proof.

&gt;Claims it's faked.

&gt;HOW THE FUCK DO YOU FAKE A DATE AND TIME STAMP ON MY SHITTY HTC?

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/vZ0Nv.gif)

As I try to explain this concept to Beetus, Spouse-a-tron leaves the room and subtly makes a call to Landlady to come over.

Beetus is mid rant, jimmies a quiver saying I'm just getting upset because I'm on my period and I'm a girl and emotional because I'm fat and trying to cause fuss because my fatness is making Spouse-a-tron look at other women.

&gt;I had started work again

&gt;weight was dropping

&gt;145lbs

&gt;Had just spent a weekend running through rough terrain and sword fighting. 

&gt;Beetus had sat in a 5 star hotel, pigging out on food, drinking fine ales and taking tour buses to scenic lakes with his mother and sisters, who dote on him

&gt;doubt he so much as lifted a finger by himself all weekend.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/vqzVz.gif)

Landlady arrives mid rant. Spouse-a-tron is confused how he suddenly got sexist. He'd never seen or heard Beetus make any overly sexist comments to me. Beetus was careful to never say them in front of Spouse-a-tron.

Beetus is telling us how I'm just some little slut-trumpet (This is actually one of my favourite names now) who was so insecure about my weight and my fat ugly ass that I was taking it out on people with *REAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS* to make myself feel better. Landlady doesn't even blink, just pulls a piece of paper out of her bag and holds it out to him.

It says **30 Days Notice to Vacate** on the top in bold, and then a lot of legalese. Signed by Landlady and her Husband and some witnesses. 

Beetus is gobsmacked. He sputters, his face beet red, as he tries to come up with a scathing response.

&gt;404 Response Not Found

Beetus flails madly, wobbling like a jelly. **""FUCK YOU ALL I DON'T NEED THIS PRIVACY INVASION, SCREW YOU NOT UNDERSTANDING MY *KUNDISHINZ* IT'S DESCRIMINASHUN. SCREW YEW I AM MOVIN OUT FRIDAY. I DON'T NEED YOUR HATIN WAYS.""**

&gt;[WUT](http://i.imgur.com/SpVoNhy.gif)

&gt;hurrah.gif

&gt;I think?

Beetus tells Spouse-a-tron **""I don't know what you see in that slut, I hope you come around and realise what a bitch she is. She's just going to ruin your life and get you fat to bring you up to her level so she feels better about her ugly ass. It's what women do when they get married man, they trap you and get fat and ugly and ruin your life. I'm getting out now before she makes me fat. I hope you can see that too.""**

As previously mentioned, Landlady is larger lady.

&gt;5'4, 200lbs, but not a ham planet  because she's not an entitled asshole who blames everyone else for her weight.

&gt;dresses really well and manages to look a LOT smaller than she is.

&gt;moves gracefully, doesn't knock things over with her booty

&gt;Eats healthy, makes me eat healthy too.

&gt;Is an utter and complete boss.

*""Beetus, you have noone but yourself to blame for your childish behaviour and your weight. I've known you since you first moved to Glasgow, all you eat is shit, all you do is sit around and play video games, and I know for a fact you don't bathe. You are at fault in this situation and you are lucky we haven't sought legal action for your conduct with the break in.""*

Beetus don't give a fuck.

**""FUCKING LOSERS, I'M OUT.""**

Locks himself in his room. Moves out that Friday.

&gt;good riddance

We inspected his room ""officially"" with Landlady. Before we moved in house was newly renovated. New plaster on walls, new fixtures, new paint, new carpet, new everything. Four months of Beetus, and we had to deep clean the walls, which were sweating, had mould growing in the corners from where he'd left bin bags of rubbish and rotting food to just grow. Mattress had to get deep cleaned and sterilized, and the carpet had to be totally shampoo'd and cleaned. The door also had to be rehung because his fatass broke it.

We found that out of spite, he tore up the expensive special light blocking blinds in his room, and stomped on my kindle so the screen was a crunch mess of black.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Next Time on The Fatmate**

We hear further stories of Fattitude from his previous flatmates.

Your Jimmies will russle like NEVER before!

Tl;DR: Fat flatmate gets inordinately enraged at me for opening a window to air out his room and ""touching his stuff"". Moves out ASAP in order to avoid being kicked out."	t5_2vzax	True

I don't think this will be particularly funny. It's also not as good of a story as others, but I will probably post more in the future. This is from when we first moved in together about a year ago.

I met Hamtaro off Craigslist when I moved to a new city. When we met, she seemed really cool. She is pretty cool, she just has her moments. Those moments have turned into daily occurrences. We are both in college, and I have a budget of about $300-400 a month for food, going out, etc, after paying rent.

Fast forward to a few months after moving in.

We started noticing a smell coming from Beetus's room. Not just a little musty, but full on NOPE. While Beetus is out one day, I crack the door to investigate. I expect a little mess, untidy is one thing, filth is another thing completely.

&gt;[sweating walls.](http://i.imgur.com/JFfLfAn.gif)

&gt;piles of unwashed clothes

&gt;Beetus never washed them ever

&gt;about 2/3s of our cultery, cups, mugs, bowls and dishes are all in his room caked with nope.

&gt;Bin bags full of nope.

&gt;I'm pretty sure they moved.

&gt;[NOPE NOPE NOPE.](http://i.imgur.com/fMiwV8h.gif)

Shortly after movie night there was The Battle of the Xbox, where he behaved like a three year old wouldn't let anyone else use the tv or his xbox (mine was fair game apparently though) and we eventually convinced him to move his gaming rig up to his room.

&gt;Xbox, PS3, PC are all on. screen is just turned off. I plug each one into the tv. He's paused in the middle of games on all 3.

I think back on our electrical bill, which has been pretty high these past few months. We have a metre which we have to top up. Pay As You Go Electricity. It's a thing in Britain. We top it up about 20 quid each, but I notice Spouse-a-Tron and I are also topping it up TWICE as much and as often as he is.

&gt;This is so not even funny.

&gt;save each game, turn everything off.

&gt;Beetus gets home eventually and notices all his stuff is off.

&gt;throws massive hissy fit at me

&gt;Says I'm a chick, I need to learn to respect a man's privacy.

**""YOU MAY THINK IT'S OK TO DO THIS TO PEOPLE, BUT GODDAMN I HOPE SPOUSE-A-TRON PUTS YOU IN YOUR PLACE. DON'T THINK I WON'T TELL HIM WHAT YOUR LITTLE SLUT FACE DID. WHAT DOES HE EVEN SEE IN A FATASS LITTLE BITCH LIKE YOU.""**

&gt;[CANT. NOT. REACT.](http://i.imgur.com/AJJj01S.gif)

""Beetus, we've been paying a ridiculous amount in electricity. We asked you not to keep all your stuff on because it's making the meter run down REALLY fast. I've been keeping track of who's been topping up, and you've only topped up twice since you moved in, as apposed to us, who have topped up nearly 200 quid. This isn't fair on any of us. You don't see us leaving all the lights on and the tv etc. We turn off everything but the fridge! It's really uncool that you'd keep everything running and not pay your fair share. Also, mate, you've been eating all our food, we can't afford to keep buying groceries. Now we don't mind you using stuff as long as you replace it, but you aren't replacing it, and we can't afford to do that. We don't want to have to write our names on all our food.""

**""WHATEVER, JUST BECAUSE YOU SUCK SPOUSE-A-TRON'S DICK, DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY RIGHT TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO, I DO WHAT I WANT, FUCK YOU, I HAVE *ASTHMA* AND I NEED TO KEEP MY BLOOD SUGAR UP SO I DON'T HAVE AN ATTACK. DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?""**

Note: I have severe asthma. While each case is different, this kind of trigger is *extremely* unlikely. 

&gt;Don't push it

&gt;so pissed off.

I go to a friend's house to hang out because I can't even handle the crazy. While there, we're chilling, nomming and just generally having a few drinks, and I get a call from Landlady.

""WHAT HAPPEND TO THE HOUSE?""

""Um, I don't know, I'm not at home, what's going on?""

""BEETUS JUST POSTED ON FACEBOOK THAT SOMEONE BROKE IN.""

**""*WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK?*""**

I check facebook, Beetus has blocked me. I can't see shit. I call Spouse-a-tron. ""Woah what the hell?! I'm at work, won't be home till tomorrow, I can't get off work.""

&gt;works as overnight support for disabled folk.

I tell my friends what's happened and I have to rush off. They all give me money for cab, I race home. Beetus is just sitting in his room playing xbox. ""WHAT THE FUCK MAN, WHAT HAPPENED?""

&gt;drunk lady came in via back door and rattled around the shelves eating food, saying ""KELLY SAID I COULD STAY HERE"", left when she realised Beetus was in the house.

""Ok what did the police say?""

**""Oh, should I have called the police?""**

&gt;[No no we should just let this go like nothing happened.](http://i.imgur.com/aSlzdoF.jpg)

""Fucking yes we should call the police! did they take anything?""

**""Nothing important seems missing""**

I make a quick rundown of the flat. My brand new ipod classic (a month old) is missing, my $200 headphones, my backup phone which was hidden away on the shelf, a few of my DVDs and an old broken phone belonging to Spouse-a-tron. Make this list. Call police.

**""I don't know why you're so upset, it's not like they took anything important.""** Beetus says with a sneer.

&gt;[nothing important](http://i.imgur.com/29zDOC5.gif)

&gt;you mean none of your stuff

That look on his face. It's slightly off.

Police come round, take statements, I give them serial numbers for everything because I am prepared like that. Police radio around, after some time they get message showing that the security cameras around the area show her going in the back door.

""Someone must have left a door unlocked, be careful guys. This can be a shady area right next to council housing.""

Beetus is already establishing how SECURITY CONSCIOUS he is.

**""I KNOW OFFICER, I HAVE A CONDITION, I WAS SO SCARED. I make sure to keep all doors locked because I could die with my condition, if I get too scared. I don't want anyone stealing my food.""**

&gt;I left that door locked when I left. I double checked both doors and all the windows. I was on the phone with Landlady while I did it. She heard me and everything.

Police leave, telling us to be careful.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/29zDOC5.gif) I realise Beetus left the back door open on purpose.

Total value of items stolen: $650

Spouse-a-tron gives him benefit of doubt, it's an ""honest mistake"".

Landlady spring $150 on new locks and keys because we briefly had a theory that the woman had keys from the previous owners, and we hadn't gotten all the keys from the Bank.  Apparently previous tenants were evicted due to not paying rent for forever. Later proved wrong by security camera footage in the area.

**TL;DR**

Beetus gets mad because I try to conserve electricity while I find out about his horrific nuclear fallout zone of a room, as revenge, he leaves backdoor unlocked so drunk lowlife comes in and steals $650 worth of stuff, causes landlady's insurance on house to go up.

Oh and when we ""discussed"" this with him he was like ""Oh you've got your stuff insured, you can just claim it all back"".  We can't because he did it. Each item it is inexpensive enough that we could replace it ourselves, and making a claim would drive up our monthly rates. Insurance is for our big stuff like laptops, tv, etc.

&gt; Be me, 5'11 ~250lb.; a fatty for sure, but without the gross entitlement and fatlogic.

&gt; Be a new employee. firstjobfuckyeah.jpg

&gt; Be ringing up hotchicks, MILFS, and sweetoldladies.

&gt; Getting comfortable with the job, being genuinely friendly to customers, etc. lifeaintbad.jpg

&gt; Gorgeous [Kat Denning](http://www.hqwall.com/Hollywood/kat-denning/Wallpapers/BigImg/kat-denning-hqwall.com-888832.jpg) look-alike with a cane hobbles up to my register. 5'7 ~160lbs., curvy, busty, perfection 

&gt; Be awkward, beta guy. 

&gt; Greet and shysmile.jpg

&gt; While ringing up her stuff, gather the courage to ask what happened to her leg. 

&gt; katdennings starts to answer but her breath is taken away by a the stench emanating from the feed-hole of the mobile lard tub behind her. 

&gt; ""Stopp hittin' on that gurl and gett to werk""

&gt; Be me, speechless, turning red. 

&gt; katdennings takes it in stride and says ""I think he is just being nice ma'am""

&gt; Be glad she was able to discern the lard tubs gender. misterysolved.jpg

&gt; Lard tub makes facial expression, ""whateva, jus' hurry up"".

&gt; Theres one other person in line, and she arrived 15 seconds ago.

&gt; Awkward silence follows in which the only sound is me scanning 
groceries at lightspeed. 

&gt; katdennings gives me wary smile and leaves

&gt; farewell and shysmile.jpg

&gt; lard tub Lacey waddles up, 5'6 320+lb, late twenties.

&gt; Her cart is full of absolute garbage.

&gt; As I start ringing her up she says:

&gt; ""yur new here aren't you?""

&gt; ""Yeah, I've be-""

&gt; ""If we wanted ta get hit on bah people like you we would go to walmart, i mean seriously, da u think you have a chance wit girls like me and her""

&gt; stunnedsilence.jpg

&gt; ""Ma'am I was jus-""

&gt; ""I mean, maybah i was a tad harsh before but its jus one of those things that bother me, ya kno? We are here to shop, not to be harassed by the employees""

&gt; Be me, standing there, mouth agape, at a loss for words.

&gt; After a few seconds I decide the best course of action is to apologize, for what I don't know.

&gt; ""I'm sorry ma'am, it won't happen again""

&gt; She made another facial expression, conveying, I believe, annoyance. canttellthroughfatrolls.jpg 

&gt; the lard tub rotates seeking moral support from the customer behind it.

Enter, fitsoccermom and fitsoccerson, stage right:

&gt; ""I mean, dis lady has children, this is suppose to be ah safe place, I jus don't think ur a good fit here at my TJ's, you look like a cashier at walmart""

&gt; whattheactualfuck.jpg

&gt; fitsoccermom, who has heard most of this, is done playing nice.

&gt; ""excuse me? what is your problem lady?!""

&gt; ""u sah what he was doin, starin that gurl down""

&gt; ""No, I saw a fat sow picking on some poor kid""

&gt; alphaasfuck.jpg

&gt; awesomemomineverhad.jpg

&gt; Lard tub Lacey turns red, makes a gurgling sound 

&gt; ""Bitch, I bet ur husband feels like he is banging a Holocaust survivor""

&gt;ohshitshewentthere.jpb 

&gt; Be me, done with ringing this lady up.

&gt; fitsoccermom decides to be the better person: 
""I think its time for you to go""

&gt; Lard tub Lacey picks up her things and waddles out. 

TL;DR Hamplanet gives me shit for trying to chat with a customer, alpha soccer mom flips out.

I have another really good one, so assuming all goes well, i'll be throwing that one up soon. We don't get many hamplanets at ""TJ's"" but when we do, they tend to be the incredibly entitled, upper-middle class kind.

Life, as it has a habit of doing, goes on.

Porcina, in the course of keeping her promise to seek help, would be diagnosed with a brain tumor. It was both benign and easily operable, and her recovery was very swift. Although the growth had not been to blame for her unhealthy weight – a topic of much discussion by her doctor –  it had been a partial cause of her antisocial behavior (though not the only culprit). Follow-up visits to a psychologist would provide her with further improvements, one step of which – as she herself explained – was to take responsibility for herself. She was also given the relieving news that she did not, in fact, suffer from herpes, nor any other evident infection. When asking about the self-appraised abdominal blisters she had noticed on herself, Porcina was advised to discontinue use of a certain hair-removal product. She remains a ""bigger girl,"" as she came to call herself, but adopted healthier habits and has dropped down several sizes. More importantly than that, however, is that she continued to improve in other ways. Today, she is a much more likable and very pleasant person.

Jeff and I are still very close friends, and likely always will be. He would, in the months that followed, have an adventure of his own, and it would be my turn to offer sage advice.

Aaron and Porcina drifted apart, though there was no official breakup. He went on to marry a model from Japan, thus forever lending credence to the phrase, ""Stranger things have happened."" His job with a well-known software company has him traveling across the globe, but when back at home, he moonlights as an amateur musician. 

He's still weird.

Lauren and I dated for several months after that. We ended things amicably, without ever so much as a single fight, after mutually deciding – for no concrete reason other than how we both felt – that we just weren't right for each other. Also, there was the tiny issue of time. Spring classes resumed with a vengeance that year, and Lauren took on a second job so that she could keep saving for the future and still pay the rent for her solitary apartment. She did, obviously, end up moving out, though she and Porcina stayed close. Their matching tattoo, for anyone who is interested, is an icosahedron – a twenty-sided, three-dimensional figure – set between each of their shoulder blades. Lauren showed me hers a few weeks after our first date. It is *not*, she insisted, a twenty-sided die. She graduated with a degree in economics, and found a job analyzing market trends. She hopes to one day open her own bookstore.

As for me, I kept living. I made more stupid decisions and got into more trouble... but I became a better person, too. I settled down into a series of long-term, committed relationships, until I met a girl who left Lauren in the dust. 

I eventually came to understand that anything negative about us – whether it's a temper, selfishness, or even something about our appearances – doesn't have to define us. It's the choices that we make and the actions that we take which really matter. There will always be people in the world with whom we don't see eye-to-eye, but after everything is said and done, we can only worry about being the best that *we* can be, and letting other folks have the same freedom. We're all just people, living out our lives and hoping for the best.

I find that it helps to keep in mind: Even the worst experiences end.

And so, dear friends, does my story.

1373121817.0	1hqzxk	One Night with Hamela Anderson (semi-NSFW)	and_idancedancedance	726	174	102	"After reading a lot of stories where female hams try to conquer them some unsuspecting lean man meat, I knew I had to tell the story of my roommate and Hamela Anderson.

Hamela Anderson went to college with us, was in our year, our major, and more or less in the same social circle. Her face looked like [Bev Bighead from Rocko's Modern Life](http://images.wikia.com/rockosmodernlife/images/7/77/Thumb-bev.jpg) and she was very...rotund (like seriously, 300 pounds). For some reason, since day one Hamela did NOT like me. Probably because I'm a skinny anorexic bitch, but whatever. 

This story happened my senior year of college. Roommate is a very skinny, overall small male. We lived with two other people that rarely emerged from their ~~caves~~ rooms, so they will not be mentioned. On this particular evening, Roommate and I decided to stay in and do our own thing. 

He eventually wanders into my room. ""So...Hamela Anderson has been texting me all night."" My response? ""Ew."" ""Yeah, I guess she's pretty drunk at this party."" We make a few jokes along the lines of beached whales, yelling timber when she falls, etc. Roommate goes back to his room. I go back to doing whatever the heck I was doing.

Roommate comes back in. ""Hey, Hamela Anderson just told me that she's the one who drove to the party. I think she's gonna try to drive herself home. I'm gonna go get her and bring her back to her apartment."" Roommate is a real nice guy. He tries to hide this behind a layer of sarcasm, but those that know him know that they can count on him. I wish him the best of luck on his endeavor. 

About an hour or so later, I decide I'm hungry and want a midnight snack. (Skinny anorexic bitches gotta eat too!) Right as I'm about to open my bedroom door, I hear the front door open, and the sounds of that terrible TEE HEE giggling fill the apartment. Hamela Anderson is in my apartment. I sneak a peak to see Roommate corralling her towards his bathroom.

Not wanting to start World War III, I text him about his seemingly poor life decision. Apparently, Hamela Anderson vommed all over the back seat of his car and rather than drive the remaining fifteen minutes to her apartment and fifteen minutes back with a car filled with steaming puke, he drove the five minutes to our apartment. Knowing that Hamela Anderson hates me and that I hate vomit, he said that she was going to crash on his futon. I make some joke about not getting her pregnant, he tells me to go fuck myself, we both drift off peacefully into dreamland.

The next morning I hear giggling coming from Roommate's room. I quickly GTFO...I don't need to be here for this. 

When I returned to the apartment later that afternoon, Roommate was sitting in the living room, looking like he had lived through the horrors of a hundred wars. ""Roommate, I heard some sexytime noises coming from your room this morning!"" ""SHUT UP I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!""

I bribed him with beer and food and he eventually opened up. Roommate had been having a good dream...a REAL GOOD DREAM (if ya know what I mean). But then he woke up. To find Hamela Anderson giving him a blow job. He sat up, screaming. She lifted her head just in time for him to blow it IN HER EYE. She then started running around the room making wounded whale noises. That is all of the story I heard because at this point I was laughing so hard that I had to run to my bathroom. 

After I finished laughing about it (sorry Roommate) I realized that what Hamela Anderson did was actually really wrong and that he should probably report it. He just sat there, shaking his head, and saying he never wanted to speak of the incident again.

**TL;DR - Drunk Hamela Anderson barfs in my roommates car, winds up sleeping over and treating herself to breakfast in bed.**"	t5_2vzax	True

TL;DR former coworker is fat as fuck and ordered 2 massive pieces of cake before her date arrived. Her date expected the girl in the dating site photo, which was from 1992.

This morning I arrived to my workplace to learn that when the check arrived, which after drinks and all would have been 60$, the guy questioned the server about the two pieces of cake, extra beer, and soda, stating that their tab must have gotten mixed up with another table's. 
The server explains that those items were consumed by my ex-coworker prior to his arrival. Immediatly she starts denning that she ever had the cake and states that the server is simply trying to embarass her because ""she didn't have a man like her"". After she disputes the charges for 20 min threatening with ""bad yelp reviews"" the server told her that if she didn't pay for it that the server herself would have to pay for it and that that wasn't going to happen because if she didn't pay for the cake the police would be called. After this epic battle the guy finally chimes in sternly saying: we will split the bill, thank you. He walked away looking very embarassed and quite furious."	t5_2vzax	True
1373018131.0	1homp7	An Open Letter	_9a_	706	157	79	"Dear Daddy,

Don't you love us anymore? You are killing yourself by inches and every time I see you I remember the wonderfully fun person you used to be; all the fun I had growing up with you; all the lessons you taught me about growing up and coping with other people. But now, so many of the qualities I admired in you are causing you to die.

I remember playing video games with you. We'd sit down together with the console, you'd completely school me (not hard to do to a 7-year old), we'd laugh and you'd tickle me, then go outside and you taught me how to ride my bike. Now your fingers are too swollen to get around a game controller. They're purple at the tips, and you literally cannot feel the buttons on the keyboard. Clicking a mouse is a slow and painful process for you. I taught my sister how to ride a bike, because you couldn't keep up chasing after her.

I remember you've always been a champion snorer. You'd saw logs and shake the walls - very very helpful for a teenager sneaking out of bed at 1 in the morning. Mom slept with earplugs. Now when I visit you, you still shake the walls... but then you stop. I count the silences, 10... 20... 30. Then a rattling gasp of breath, gulping for air. Mom sleeps in a different room now. She still wears the earplugs, but I hear her praying during the silences, hoping you'll start breathing again.

I remember you walking me down the aisle to give me away on my wedding day. Your face was red by the time we got to the alter. I knew you weren't crying. You sat gratefully down in the front pew and wiped the sweat from your brow with the handkerchief in your breast pocket. Are you going to be there for my sister's wedding? Or the birth of your first grandchild?

I remember eating breakfast with you before school every morning. You'd wink at me as you put a couple extra spoonfuls of sugar on your Frosting-Coated Made-Of-Corn-Flakes. Now I see you check your blood sugar at breakfast. 350. I count four tablespoons of sugar going onto half a box of cereal. You're still eating Sugar-Frosting Made-of-Corn-Flakes, now supplemented with your insulin shot. Y'know, when Mom reminds you to take it.

I remember going to your brother's funeral. He was forty-three when he died from a massive heart attack. You got kidney stones the night of the wake and went to the hospital. You ended up getting emergency double bypass surgery because you couldn't even walk down the hall to get the ultrasound. I thought we were going to have a double funeral that weekend.

We've tried so hard to help you. Mom is a great cook, and she can do wonderful things with the vegetables she grows in her garden. You eat around them. I packed you a lunch to take to work - low sodium turkey, whole wheat bread, fresh fruit. You left them in the refrigerator. So I put them in your briefcase. You made me take out the trash, and I see the piles of brown bag lunches in the garbage can, still full. You try to hide them under the McBeetus bags, the wrappers from candy bars, the packages of beef jerkey.

Yesterday, I helped put the compression stocking-socks on your legs. Your feet and ankles are swollen, the size of my upper thighs. Your toes are purple and cold to the touch. Your legs have shiny patches of taut, cracking skin. You stumbled over the gravel driveway, your insensate feet plodding and waddling to a bench in the shade. My sisters went tubing down the river. I stayed with you, talking. Catching up. Fetching your glasses of water to try and beat the heat. I want to get the time in now, while I still can.

You taught me to be strong, to not let the bullies in school make me feel worthless because of my appearance. You're right - appearance dosn't matter. But you're dying.

You taught me to be stubborn, to not back down from the convictions I held that I knew to be right. You're right - convictions are important. But you're dying.

You taught me to love life, to not let neither the past nor the future suck the pleasure of the present away. You're right - the best way to enjoy life is to savor each moment. But you're dying.

And I can't do anything about it."	t5_2vzax	True
1372147734.0	1h0yv9	That's no moon... (Jabba the Cunt: No Hope pt I)	ausgebombt-	693	141	77	"So the start of this year I moved into a new place ready for the new year of university starting up.
I had trouble filling all the rooms in the place I found with people I knew, so I had to settle with filling the final room with an unknown person. This was my first mistake.

It was late February, the first semester was about to start, me and two friends (I'll call them Ben and Max) had already moved in and we were awaiting our final roommate.

It was about 3 pm, Ben, Max and myself were about halfway through Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back when we hear a knock on the door. I went up and opened the door and was greeted by Jabba the Cunt, the 350 pound 5'6"" beefcake who we would be spending the year with. Now, I don't hate fat people at all and was perfectly friendly and eager to get to know my new flatmate, as were Ben and Max. The first inkling any of us had that this was going to be a trying year for us all was when Jabba looked at the TV during the battle of Hoth and said ""What are you guys watching?"".

Anyway, aside from having never seen Star Wars (someone I consider a cardinal sin) for the first week Jabba seemed ok, mainly kept to himself.

First week of semester, we all drag our asses to class aside from Jabba, who was looking for work, so he sat at home turning our couch cushions concave.

I'm very much into cooking and try and lead a healthy lifestyle. I have a couple of expensive cooking knives (Shun, for those wondering) that I keep in my room because the steel can be damaged easily.

One day, I grab my knife from my shelf and take it out of it's sheath and notice a very distinct chip out of the top. I'm pretty pissed at this stage as the knife was a gift for my 21st birthday present from my parents and I look after it very carefully. I wasn't 100% sure I hadn't unknowingly caused the chip at this stage, so I put any accusations aside for the time being.

Fast forward a week and I come home from class early with Max and see my knife in Jabba's greasy hands cutting apart a big hunk of meat with the bone in. I immediately ask him what he is doing and he replies nonchalantly ""Just cooking lunch"". So I ask him what he is doing with my knife that was in my room and he tells me it was just on the bench and there were no other clean knives, this was totally bullshit, I clean the knife after every use and place it back in my room. I grab it off him and tell him not to go into my room and use my stuff.

This is when Jabba loses his shit he bellows with the power of an old church organ covered in a slick film of greasy cheeto sweat ""YOU CAN'T FUCKING ACCUSE ME OF TAKING YOUR SHIT. HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR SHIT LYING AROUND, GIVE ME THE KNIFE I NEED TO FINISH COOKING""

This is when shit gets messy, he reaches out to try and grab the handle of my knife, but his co-ordination is a bit off from years of ham and butter abuse. His hand catches the edge of the blade, and a 2.5 inch cut opens up quickly and deeply. He freaks out and starts shouting that I stabbed him and he goes off to the bathroom screaming about how he is calling the cops.

Meanwhile, Max is observing the entire situation in state of awe (or horror, it was hard to tell).

The cops show up about 15 minutes later see Jabba's very fleshy wound and I get arrested before I manage to plead my case and placed in the back seat of the cop car, Max manages to speak to the police and the confirm his story with mine and they uncuffed me and give me a warning and tell me to be careful next time.

Jabba goes and gets his wound stitched and upon returning says I owe him for the bill and he is moving out, however things don't end quite that easily...

I'll post pt II if this gets any interest

tl;dr: living with michelin man, tries to take a very sharp blade out of my hand, gets cut, calls police, I get arrested

1374068188.0	1ihg8z	Wherein a pod of Hamwhales try to deny me a handicapped parking spot.	LeLeThrowawayLe	641	92	87	"Gather ye-selves some cupcakes, my condishun-laden friends. I don't want your blood sugah to get dangerously low, teehee. Buckle up your thighroids. Rev your mobility scooters. Set your jimmies to maximum rustle. And prepare yourself for a fatscinating tale of hamtrigue.

A little background story. I am a brain cancer survivor. I had 6 brain surgeries last year, including a craniotomy - the one where they remove a piece of your skull, make an incision to the middle of your brain (where my tumor was; smack dab in the bloody middle), take out the tumor, replace the piece of skull, and anchor the skull flap in place with multiple titanium plates. Not surprisingly, all of that left me with several complications. Among them are:

-I have seizures if I overexert myself.

-One side of my body is partially paralyzed (like that of a stroke survivor). The medical term for this is hemiparesis.

-That same side of my body is constantly in excruciating pain. My pain doctor told me that my particular flavor of chronic pain ranks up there with bone cancer pain. Basically, I have phantom limb pain on one side of my body. The only way to treat it is to be on a whopping dose of narcotic painkillers. Exertion makes the pain worse.

-I am EXTREMELY fatigued most of the time. Most of my fatigue stems from my recovery from those brain surgeries, not from the narcotics. In fact, I have LESS energy when I don't take the painkillers.

Because of this staggering list of condishuns, I have a handicapped parking pass. Handicapped passes were made for such circumstances.



With that in mind, it is greentext time:

&gt;Be me, a 6'0"" tall 185 pound man who by most external features appears to be relatively fit and healthy.

&gt;Be going to the grocery store because my refrigerator is nearly empty and I need to eat food on a daily basis (teehee).

&gt;I spot an open handicapped spot near the entrance! This is rare where I live - and surprisingly rare in many places around the country - for reasons that will become clear.

&gt;I pull my car into the handicapped spot, satisfied that this trip will be less of a pain in my ass than the last one.

&gt;WTF, a solar eclipse, at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely in front of my car.simpsonsreference.

&gt;Get out of car.

&gt;Solar eclipse starts yelling at me. ""Whadder you doin in that parkin spot. You aren't no handicap. Yer a healthy young man. Yer kind are the reason why I can't find meh a handicap spot.""

&gt;Realize the solar eclipse is actually a hamwhale. Hamwhales in adjacent handicapped spots are glaring at me as well.

&gt;""Uhh, well let's see. Actually I AM handicapped. I am a brain cancer survivor. I have numerous complications from the SIX BRAIN OPERATIONS I had to go through. So I'll be going on now. What exactly is YOUR ~~handicap~~ problem."" (notice the clever use of double entendre).

&gt;Snort. ""What kind of excuse is that. I have a REAL condishun. My blood sugar gets low and I can't move good. At least you can walk. There are people who need this spot more than you!""

&gt;Containingallofmyrage.pdf

&gt;The Hamwhale continues. ""Because of people like you, sometimes I have to walk to mah mobility scooter! Do you know what that is LIKE with a bum knee?!?"" (the scooter is literally 15 feet away, or roughly 5 meters for you non 'Muricans). ""You're obviously okay!!!"" *looks me up and down*

&gt;Areyoufuckingkiddingme.jpeg. You fatties have NO idea what real pain and suffering is like.

&gt;""Wait... so you are saying that you would trade your condishun for MY BRAIN CANCER? Is that right? Ok, let's trade. I'll trade right here and now. At least your disability can be cured by diet and exercise.""

&gt;Blank stares all around. I can't tell what is going on between those squinty, beady eyes... probably because her eyes are smashed into a permanent squint by rolls of face fat.

&gt;The remainder of the pod of Hamwhales have slumped/flopped out of their cars by now. They are clearly on the side of the other Hamwhale. They appear to be communicating on some subsonic frequency that allows them to stealthily move in packs.

&gt;The Hamwhale has no response. She just lets out a ""Hrrummph"" and waddles off, mumbling god knows what. The other Hamwhales fart/amble their way behind the other Hamwhale, mumbling and wheezing at the same time (what an accomplisment!).

&gt;Urge to kill rising, RISING.simpsonsreference

&gt;I still beat them to the mobility scooters. Yes, even with hemiparesis, I am faster than them. 

&gt;Should I take one of the scooters? Hmm. HMMMMM.

&gt;Nah. I just get a large grocery cart and start walking veeery... veeery slooowly... in front.... of them... completely.... blooocking.... their way.... with my body and my swerving cart. The pod of Hamwhales is annoyed.

&gt;I do this through the entire produce section before I realize this gambit is foolish. Their kind does not consume produce.

&gt;Rush as fast as I can to the display of colossal donuts (yes, that is what they are called, and yes the donuts are HUGE). The donut display is nestled within the produce section, not next to the bakery (WTF?). 

&gt;I block the entire donut section with my cart, leaning on the cart with a smirk on my face. The fatties are approaching, their arms stretched out in a feeble attempt to grasp for donuts. They will never get them. Yesssssss.mrburns.

1376093311.0	1k2786	Women and burgers first!	buffetladon	636	96	58	"Hello again all, taking a break from my sister series to throw you a morsel from my job. 

I work in a mostly female office. The women there who are not too old to be pregnant are in general, always pregnant or gone on pregnancy leave. The heroine of our tale today is 7 months along, let's call her Cheesebun. Now Cheesebun is a frequent preacher of fat -logic, from the ""eating for two"" myth (moar like eating for 10 right?), to ""anything you eat in the first half of the day does not count, because you burn it all before you go to sleep at night. (WTF?) 

So today we are in our office, doing office things, and the fire alarm goes off. The fire alarm NEVER goes off, we never have drills, it never accidentally goes, I have never heard it in all my time there. Our office is also inside a larger building and does not have quick or easy access to the outside. 

So everyone starts to speedwalk to the exit, helping other pregnant ladies and the elderly get up and out. Cheesebun is getting some help because 400 lbs of pregnancy weight does not move fast nor easily. We get to the exit and she stops, turns around, and heads BACK INTO THE DAMN OFFICE! ""Cheddarbun what is wrong?!"" I go back in to make sure she gets back out while everyone heads outside to see what is on fire. I come across her at her cubicle pulling a bag of arby's out. This was at 10am, and she had eaten a bag of mcdonald's when she got to the office, as she does every morning.

She ran back into the building...pregnant....during a fire alarm...to grab her bag of Arby's.

Oh my god! Why did you come back for this crap?!!  ""We don't know how long we will have to wait outside and i'm getting hungry.""

I walked her back out and told my co-workers what had happened, the office in general is fat-logic central, but even they were shocked to watch her down the pile of roast beef sandwiches that she had potentially risked her and her unborn child's life for.

TL;DR Prego fatty risks life and limb to avoid having to go more than an hour without sustenance."	t5_2vzax	True
1375198975.0	1jcr04	Ares vs Mother and Sister Hambulas Part I	PraytoAres	687	140	93	"Link to [Part II](http://redd.it/1jfde8) [Part III](http://redd.it/1ji8yb)

I am 19; I have a mom a dad and an older sister (20 years old). When we were young my parents got a divorce. My mother took care of my sister and I lived with my father. 
My father was a military man, as a result from a young he molded me into a disciplined man (and fit). My mother on the other hand was quite the opposite; she lived off the government (said she was disabled from car accident) and alimony payments. My mother’s laziness, was picked up by my older sister as well, neither woman did anything and were both obese. 
Now this story begins after I receive an acceptance letter to a prestigious school. Unfortunately, it was out of state, lucky for me though, it was about a thirty minute drive from my mom’s house. My mom offered me residence in her home so I could commute (saved a lot of money). 
**Start**
&gt;Arrive at mom’s house during the summer, one month till school starts

&gt;Haven’t seen mom and sister since last year

&gt;Mom picks me up from the airport

&gt;Drive home is a bit awkward, mom replies to all my questions with one word answers.

&gt;We arrive, I notice the yard is unkempt weed are growing everywhere

&gt;I unload my luggage no one helps

&gt;I move my luggage to the guest room
 
&gt;Mom: Ares what do you think you are doing!

&gt;Me: I am unpacking my clothes, is there a problem?

&gt;Mom: You aren’t supposed to stay in the guest room. It’s in case someone comes over, didn’t your dad teach you manners? Move your belongings to your sister’s room

&gt;Me: Sure thing, sorry about the trouble

&gt;She leaves and mutters under her breath
I move into my sister’s room she is pissed that she has to share it with me but w/e.  

&gt;Comes dinner time

&gt;I go downstairs to see what is cooking

&gt;Shocked, I see packs of empty “[Pasta Sides]( http://i.imgur.com/HtxpvGo.jpg)” littering the floor

&gt;Mom is cooking what appears to be a Giant’s Cauldron

&gt;On the counter are sticks of butter that are being thrown one by one into the pot
Eris: you are going to love mom’s cooking, mom adds vegetables so it is good for you

&gt;MFW only vegetable that was added was a pinch of dried oregano

**FAT LOGIC Weight loss tip** Vegetables of any kind magically negate calories

&gt;I don’t want to be rude so I take a generous amount of food and start eating.

&gt; I watch Mom and Eris devour down their portions 

&gt;They get more and more and compete with each other to eat as much as possible 

[Artist’s depiction of the event]( http://i.imgur.com/JDmj0n8.jpg)

 They ate their food so quickly that they would sometimes have to stop to catch their breath 

&gt;I finish my food and leave the dinner table

&gt;Eris: Are you trying to lose weight Ares?

&gt;Me: No I had more than my fair share. Thank you mom the food was delicious.


&gt;Mom: you can have more Hunny its good for you, you are a man you want to become big and strong don’t you?

&gt;Me: okay I’ll have a bit more

&gt;Finish eating, God I want to throw up so hard

&gt;Go upstairs start working on cover letter for an internship/job at the University

&gt;Eris starts watching her favorite show, Game of Thrones, with the volume at 200% on her laptop. 

&gt;W/e I ignore and do my best to work

&gt;Eris and I get called down about 2 hours after dinner 

&gt;Mom hands me a plate of chicken strips, bacon, cheese, and a piece of lettuce 

&gt;Me: Mom what is this?

&gt;Mom: Night time salad, if you eat salad it helps you lose weight

&gt;Me: it just adds more calories to what we already ate, plus I am not hungry


&gt;Mom: I know you think you know everything, but google anywhere, is salad healthy

&gt;Me: I know salad is good for you but that’s only if you use it in place of your other meals, plus I am not that hungry and the salad is filled with meat

&gt;Mom: Look I just add some meat so you can get your protein, that’s all, and trust me it works; I saw it on the Dr. Oz show.

&gt;Me: I don’t really believe that guy, every episode he just uses his show as a platform to sell stuff

&gt;I look at Eris and Mom’s face… I done goofed …these guys worship the [Great Oz]( http://i.imgur.com/iSZcBqP.jpg). 

&gt;I look around they have every fish oil, dog urine extract, snake semen, that this man sells.

&gt;Mom: when you become a doctor you can tell people how to eat, now are you going to eat it or do I have to throw it away.

&gt;Me: I really don’t have any room

&gt;Mom snatches the plate from me and throws it into the sink and starts cursing

&gt; I run upstairs oh shit what have I done

&gt;I stay a bit upstairs then later go downstairs to apologize to mom 

&gt;Eris starts talking to me while she eats her ‘salad’ with a fuck ton of dressing

&gt;Me: you guys are pretty serious on the dieting

&gt;Eris: not everyone can be born with a body like yours; some people have to work for it

&gt;Eris: just because you are skinny doesn’t mean you know what is best for dieting

&gt;Me: I don’t think I do, I go by the basic principle that as long as you burn more calories than you eat then you lose weight

&gt;Eris: Where did you hear that?

&gt;Me: It’s a fundamental law of physics

&gt;Eris: Look just because you go to __________ doesn’t mean you are some fancy physicist

&gt;I give up and just continue working

&gt;I fall asleep

&gt;However I wake up in the middle of the night to loud noises

&gt;Fucking Eris, she has her sound so loud I can hear her interracial porn through her head set. (I heard, “fudge me harder with that ‘African-American’ Dick”)

&gt;This is some ridiculous shit, I make it obvious that I am awake yet Eris continues to watch her porn.

&gt;I dare not interrupt a behemoth that is aroused 

&gt;Try my hardest and eventually fall asleep

First days were rough, luckily I got the job I applied for and I start working there during the day and hang out with a coworker after work. I usually come home so exhausted that I can fall asleep easily through Eris’s porn and Game of Thrones. 

&gt;Come back and fall straight asleep one night

&gt;Wake up middle of the night to loud moaning

&gt;Holy shit she is fapping so loud it’s as if she wants me to wakeup

&gt;Upon closer inspection she is using my laptop WTF!!

&gt;Turn on the lights

&gt;Me: what are you doing with my laptop? 

&gt;She slams my laptop shut

&gt;Eris: sorry ‘Tee-hee’ my computer was being really slow so I used your computer, Just watching youtube, I hope you don’t mind.

&gt;Me: Look I have a lot of important documents on that, I can help you fix your computer tomorrow but please don’t use mine

&gt;She agrees I go back to sleep but she continues with her fapping.

&gt;Next morning I get supplies to clean her laptop (compressed air, wipes etc).

&gt;Computer is loaded with dust, melted chocolate, and oil

&gt;Start clearing the 2000 tool bars, stop seeding her thousands of torrents, run virus scan

&gt;Start checking her internet history… I lost it

&gt;Here are some of the notable searches…daddy daughter; brother sister; how to give a blow job; Shane Diesel; Simpsons porn; Mexican cartel beheading video; Game of Thrones Incest; Blondes on Blacks.

&gt;I was disgusted, but did not want to have the awkward conversation with her so I just warn her on going on ‘unsafe sites’ 

&gt;She says she will be more careful

&gt;World goes on I start spending more and more time away from home as I get settled into the area. 

&gt;I come home purely to sleep and a lot of nights I spend at friends’ houses.

&gt;Mom and sister aren’t too happy about this and they think that I am acting arrogant because I have a job. To be fair I was but it wasn’t so much that I thought of myself highly, but I viewed them as parasitic pieces of shit.

&gt;Mom demands that Eris and I have some brother and sister bonding.

&gt;I reluctantly agree…

**End**
Thank you FPS for lending me your ears, I hope you enjoyed, feel free to ask for any clarification.
**TLDR**
Move into with mom and older sister for college. They are fat worthless pieces of shit and are jealous of me.

So after my glorious introduction to her drugged up fiance, word started to spread around the store. Now, these are southern women, so word spreads faster than RW's ever-expanding waistline.

By this point in my interaction with RW, I pretty much constantly look like a pissed off cat (ears back and growling). I'm fully aware that I'm a bitch, but this woman pushes me to the limits of my sanity in every possible case.

This is actually a sad story, if you have a heart and aren't a giant bitch, as I tend to be. Schadenfreude like a mother fucker.

&gt; At work (do I really need to keep saying that? That's the only time I interact with this whale)

&gt; RW isn't working today! The whole store feels lighter from the lack of her gravitational pull

&gt; Feel a lurch in the force! Earthquake?!

&gt; lol bitch, we don't have earthquakes here, it's just a fatty walkin'

&gt; RW rolls up in the store, looks like she's been crying

To note, my position is extremely busy. I am constantly on the phone, helping cashiers, counting various monies, as well as assisting customers. I don't have a lot of down time.

&gt; RW ""Viza I don't know what to do-ooo-oooo-oooooo.""

&gt; The breaks are for her sobs. She's not crying, but she's making crying sounds.

&gt; Trying to do my job bitch, the fuck do you want?

&gt; Don't want to be rude in front of customers, cuz them bitches love me

&gt; ""What's wrong RW? You look like someone died."" Or threw away the rest of your pizza (as if there are leftovers)

&gt; ""Jonah just asked me to let his friend move in with us! I'm just really not comfortable with it. I don't know this guy and I think he's on *drugs*.""

&gt; HAHA, FUCKING REALLY?

&gt; ""You said no, right? Your mother lives in that house with you. You have to keep her safety in mind.""

&gt; RW ""Of *course* I said no. But Jonah is insistent that he moves in. He said we need to get our own house so that we won't have to worry about mom anymore.""

&gt; ""...RW your mom *needs* your help. You can't just abandon her and buy a house so your fiance's druggie friend can move in.""

&gt; RW ""I *know* that. Can you even imagine the food bills for feeding another person? And having to pay mortgage? I don't make enough to cover that!""

&gt; You don't make enough to cover your own food bill plus mortgage.

&gt; ""So just tell him no. I don't see why it's a problem.""

&gt; RW ""It's a problem because Jonah and I NEVER FIGHT. We discuss things sometimes, but usually he sees my way and then it's over. I don't know how to deal with this!""

My then boyfriend, now husband, and I have amazing fights. We yell and scream and say horrible things. I'm pretty sure the neighbors don't talk to us because of it. But we get our feelings out there without bottling them up to an explosive point (plus make up sex, don't tell him I said that). Not fighting seems absolutely foreign to me. You're two different people. You have different opinions. You are *going to fight*.

&gt; G ""If you let him move in, Jonah's problem is just going to get worse.""

&gt; RW ""Jonah doesn't *have a problem* except for bad choices in friends.""

&gt; And women.

&gt; G ""Whether you want to see it or not, he's on drugs. You can go ask S about it. She'll tell you.""

S being our pharmacy tech.

&gt; RW ""He's NOT on DRUGS. He's just worn down because he hasn't had proper food because of his ex-wife starving him! He'll be fine once he starts gaining weight!""

&gt; G ""Gaining weight ain't gonna help his problem. And you adding food addiction on top of drug addiction will just make things worse.""

&gt; RW actually laughs at this point

&gt; How can you laugh during a conversation like this?

&gt; RW ""There's no such thing as food addiction. We need food to live and to be healthy.""

&gt; G ""We do, but with the way I figure you're making him eat, he's not getting what he *needs*, he's getting what you force into his skeleton face.""

&gt; I love you, G. You have no idea all of the loves I have.

&gt; RW ""I am so TIRED of everyone giving me hell because I know how to eat properly! G you look like you haven't had a proper meal since 1945, and Viza looks like she's never had a proper meal in her life. You obviously have no idea how to be healthy with your eating habits!""

&gt; Just shoot me now, please

&gt; We live in the country, where are all the gun wielding customers?

&gt; Anybody?

&gt; Sigh. ""Getting back on topic here, you can't afford a house, your mother needs you, and no one needs a drug addict friend living with them. Just put your foot down"" (try not to break the floor) ""and tell him no.""

&gt; RW ""Ugh, that's easy for you to say. You're obviously manipulating your man into staying with you, but I won't do that with mine.""

&gt; all of my wat

&gt; How do you even make that statement after what I said?

&gt; Whale logic, how does it work?

&gt; G ""You leave Viza alone, RW. She's just trying to help you. Just because you don't want to listen to good advice, doesn't mean she's the bad guy in this.""

&gt; RW starts leaking salt water from her pores

&gt; Or crying, hard to tell

&gt; RW ""Skinny people always gang up on me! I don't even know why I came in here! I'm going to talk to my *real friends* about this because they'll understand without backstabbing me!""

&gt; RW makes a hasty (haha) exit

&gt; G shakes her head ""I know exactly why that man is with her.""

&gt; omgtellmemoar

&gt; G ""He thinks her momma has money, and he's just waiting for her to die so that RW gets her inheritance. Once she has it, he'll take half and split. Likely blow it on drugs and kill himself, but who gives a shit about that. That girl is going to be devastated and eat herself into a coma.""

&gt; ""Are you just speculating, G?""

&gt; G shakes her head ""I know everyone in this town. I've heard talk.""

&gt; Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayum...

&gt; G ""I tried to warn her about him before. About how strange his divorce was and how fast they were moving. But you know she won't hear it.""

&gt; ""Yeah, I tried to do the same.""

&gt; G ""Does she talk to you like that often? About your weight and your man?""

&gt; ""Pretty much everyday.""

&gt; G ""Next time it happens, you let me know.""

&gt; G winks and goes back to work

END PART 3

TL;DR - Fiance's drug addicted friend wants to move in, confirm drug addict fiance, fiance using RW for inheritance pending mommy's death, me and G are bitches because we're not huge cows

No part four, I managed to squeeze it all into one calorie filled episode. There are still more RW stories. Don't fret.

&gt;&gt; Be me, doing nursin' stuff at the old folks home again

&gt;&gt; Be just fucking now.  

&gt;&gt; Day 3 of 16 hour shifts

&gt;&gt; Have a little old lady, doesn't eat too much.

&gt;&gt; just likes to smile and wave at everyone- HappyGranny

&gt;&gt; have to work extra hard to keep her weight up- offer snacks all the time

&gt;&gt; noproblem.gif

&gt;&gt; suddenly, ground starts to quake

&gt;&gt; lights flicker

&gt;&gt; little old men start to scoot for cover from charlie's bombing raid

&gt;&gt; nope, just HappyGranny's grandson

&gt;&gt; 300 lbs, plaid shorts, a tarp masqerades as the classy gentleman's wifebeater...

&gt;&gt; bare feet? 

&gt;&gt; tell Llardvark he must wear shoes here, (where CAN you go without shoes?)

&gt;&gt; **""AH....** *puff...hnnnngh* **CAN'T GO BACK OUT THERE!!** *lungs make a sound vaugely like a squirrel being sat upon* **TOO HOT OUT DER!!**""

&gt;&gt; allofmywat

&gt;&gt; it's 45 degrees out

&gt;&gt; go get your shoes. 

&gt;&gt; fatty fails at trying to convince me to go get his shoes, vows to complain to administration tomorrow, but ultimately leaves and returns in a desperately suicidal pair of crocs. 

&gt;&gt; can see footfat muffintopping out of each little hole in the crocs

&gt;&gt; demands a lunch tray, so he can feed his HappyGranny

&gt;&gt; Think nothing of it- families do this all the time, and get Happy a tray from the kitchen. Her diet is pureed due to a swallowing issue, and everything is the consistancy of baby food.

&gt;&gt; Not terribly appetizing

&gt;&gt; Return to HappyGrannies room with the tray

&gt;&gt; find Llardvark sprawled out across Grannie's bed, A/C on high, drinking a 2L of Mountain Dew while flat on his back. 

&gt;&gt; *if I hang Mountain Dew in a hummingbird feeder, will I attract wild hammingbirds to my yard?* 

&gt;&gt; Set granny up, confirm that Llardvark will feed her, and give instructions- fatty agrees. 


&gt;&gt; backtowork.gif

&gt;&gt; Minutes later, an aide comes and gets me

&gt;&gt; apparently, HappyGranny has gone through 5 trays of food

&gt;&gt; aides brought tray after tray of puree'd meat and beans to her room upon Llardvark's request, just happy that Granny finally had an appetite 

&gt;&gt; highly fucking suspicious

&gt;&gt; if FPS has taught me anything, fatties gonna fat.

&gt;&gt; throw open door to HappyGrannie's room

&gt;&gt; Llardvark sitting on the bed still, bowl to his mouth, in the process of sucking down an entire serving of pureed beans in one motion

&gt;&gt; Granny still sitting there

&gt;&gt; Her silverware is untouched

&gt;&gt; She seems to have caught on to what is happening, and is glaring over her glasses at her greasy whale of a grandson in a brief moment of lucidity. 

&gt;&gt; **""AY BRING ME SOME TORTILLERS, AND GRAVY WOULD YA SUGARTITS?""**

&gt;&gt; Sugartits? Even his sexual harrassment must be glazed. 

&gt;&gt; Sudden realization- fattass has ALSO taken all of HappyGranny's roommate's food in the next bed- I spot her meal ticket on the floor next to his filthy crocs

&gt;&gt; forget all of manditory customer service training

&gt;&gt; Kick fatty out of nursing home- threaten to call cops for stealing from little old ladies

&gt;&gt; Fatass curses the entire way out the door

&gt;&gt; **WELL HELL BITCH, SHE ABOUT TO DIE SOON ANYWAY, WHAT THE FUCK'S THE POINT? I'M YOUNG, I GOTTA EAT!""**

&gt;&gt; What the actual fuck is this monster?

&gt;&gt; management horrified until I tell them what he pulled.

Shitwassocash.exe

Anyway, without further ado, this is the story of the Not So Little Drummer Boy.

&gt;Be me, 14, freshman in high school

&gt;Show up to marching band practice the week before school starts

&gt;NSLDB waddles in with a bag of McDonald's in his hand and a large bottle of diet (tee hee!) coke.

&gt;Sets his monstrous amount of food in the corner and proceeds to attempt to socialize

&gt;[&gt;MFW](http://replygif.net/i/111.gif) there is a film of...something...starting to collect on his skin already

&gt;Notsureifgreaseorsweat.fryfromfuturama.jpg

&gt;Hear him start spouting off about how nice this week is going to be because it will help him lose some weight 

&gt;[&gt;MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/laughing.gif) he thinks he's going to lose weight by eating McDonald's

&gt;NSLDB proceeds to stay inside in the air conditioned school while the rest of the band went outside and actually marched around and did marching band type stuff

&gt;NSLDB and the rest of the drum line used Rest!

&gt;It was super effective!

&gt;Come inside and find the entire drum line sitting around inside by the snack table

&gt;NSLDB is feasting on what was once a great table of goodies

&gt;Cookies, juice, freez-e pops, and grapes (gotta stay healthy, tee hee!) are all strewn about as his gaping maw devours everything that approaches it

&gt;Rest of the drum line looks visibly embarassed

&gt;NSLDB turns from the table, his appetite satiated for now

&gt;Starts talking with group of people about how hard marching in the cool, air conditioned room was

&gt;Pity Error 404; Pity Not Found

&gt;[&gt;MFW](http://i53.tinypic.com/1zv4via.gif) NSLDB is already sweating harder than some people who were outside in the heat

&gt;[&gt;MFW](http://i.imgur.com/efzcyID.jpg) NSLDB ate all of the blue icy pops

&gt;Fucking

&gt;All of them

&gt;FAST FORWARD exactly one year later

&gt;NSLDB is crying big buttery tears because he didn't get promoted to snare drum and has to spend additional year playing cymbals

&gt;""Band director must hate fat people""

&gt;NSLDB spends additional year wallowing in self-pity and complaining about how cymbals are ""too heavy"" or ""for stupid freshmen""

&gt;Year later, NSLDB gets snare drum part, needs special harness for drum kit, complains more about how heavy things are 

&gt;bitchplaythefuckingtrumpetthen.mp3

&gt;Few years later, NSLDB gets fed up with being a huge fatass.  Starts working out, dieting, all that shit

&gt;Goes on Reddit and finds a wonderful subreddit to express how he feels

&gt;Write story about how much of an obnoxious cunt he used to be

&gt;[&gt;MFW](http://i.imgur.com/2bOFFsr.gif) I've been NSLDB the whole time

&gt;[&gt;YFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mind-blown.gif) I'm the NSLDB


Hope you guys enjoyed my FPS, brought to you by M. Night Shyamalan.  This is really a more F2F than anything, as I'm down to 259 from 294 and I have no intention of stopping.  You guys have motivated me to stop treating my fatness like a handicap and take responsibility for my actions.  It's incredible to think about how much food I used to eat and then wonder why I was getting so much fatter than my friends.  If you guys want to hear what it's like going from being a huge fatass to being a slightly smaller fatass with more confidence, just let me know haha.  Less than three."	t5_2vzax	True
1376151310.0	1k3e9d	Hershey Park Hammy.	Starships876	651	107	96	"*Insert Obligatory First Post introduction*

My Aunt is a walking FPS. 5'8 and at least 400 pounds of womyn she is mired in all that is fatlogic. She beat the odds and doesn't actually have the beetus (she should probably play the lotto). Without further ado, let us begin the tale.

&gt;Be me, 5'1 petite girl going to chocolate themed amusement park with father, sister, aunt and cousins. 


&gt; First adult sized/real ride in the park is ""The Comet"", one of the original wooden roller-coasters from the park's founding.


&gt;Stand on hour long line waiting for this ride. Aunt complains that her knees hurt, that the line is too long and there is no where to sit. 


&gt;yea..... don't care. 


&gt;Finally reach the ride, the seats look a bit.... small. They were obviously built in an era before women were real. Aunt proceeds to wedge herself into the single person seat in the row, and we're off!


&gt;Roller-coaster returns to station and we are all climbing out of the car, heading for the exit. 


&gt;Wait, nope. Fat Aunt is stuck, and small cousin is in the car still trying to help her out. Nope. not happening.


&gt;""I guess we're going again, and don't have to wait in line like dem people, right cousin."" My aunt says as she tries to resecure my cousin into the car. 


&gt;""No mom, you're going alone."" She answers and nopes the fuck out of the car. 


&gt;Ride operators not sure what to do. Just sends the ride off again with new people, and just leaves my ham aunt in the car. Calls someone on the phone, talking in real hushed tones.


&gt;10 minutes later two burley guys from first aid come down with a can of grease, and start lubing her up. They attempt to pull her out themselves. Not happening


&gt; This is becoming a team operation as more people are joining in the cause. It took 6 people to free her from seat. ( 2 first aid guys, ride operator, my sister, my father, and me).


&gt; Half a can of grease, and a half hour later she emerges from the car, greasy and pissed off.


&gt;Silently apologize to the next group of people who have to sit in the greased up seat. 


Now that we've all been publicly humiliated watching them squeeze a greased up pig out of a too tight seat, let's go do something else.

&gt;Aunt forces us all to go to customer service and complain with her.

&gt;She storms into the customer service office. Pretty sure the poor woman behind the counter shit herself when she saw a greased up monster approach.

&gt;""I HAS A CUMPLAINT. DIS PARK IS DISCRIMINATIN AGAINST ME. FAT SHAMING UR CUSTOMERS IS NOT OK. IT'S 2013, DIS PARK SHOULD BE FITTED FOR PEOPLE OF ALL SIZES. I HAS A DISABILITAH AND YOU HAVETAH MAKE THE RIDES ACCESSABLE.""


&gt;She continues yelling at the poor lady, telling her how horrible the park is (it isn't) and how we're never coming back (we are). Lady offers us a refund and apologizes.

&gt;Aunt storms out of park with a smug look on her face.


&gt;ofc we have to go on the chocolate making tour before we leave. Can't pass up free chocolate to fill out dem luscious cuuuurves.


TL;DR: Visit amusement park with fat aunt who gets stuck in ride. Cries discrimination and we all leave, but not before she goes on the free chocolate ride.

We are going to refer to RW boyfriend as Jonah (courtesy of /u/ChesterHiggenbothum, formerly DWO - Death Warmed Over, courtesy of one of my fellow employees).

&gt; Workin' dat mornin' shift

&gt; Gettin' off at noon, best shift ever

&gt; Rocking out to tunes on the overhead radio, cleaning shit, helping customers, whole 9 yards

&gt; 11:30 in rolls our beloved RW

&gt; What is this? Is there a new release on the satellite radio?

&gt; Nope. It's a new whale song never before heard in the depths of all the oceans!

&gt; RW ""Viiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiza! Guess what!""

&gt; ""Is there a buy one get one free sub sale at Subway?""

&gt; RW ""Haha! I wish! Better than that! I got a boooooooooyfriend! Tee hee!""

Quick aside, she is more of a guffawing whale than a teeheeing whale, so this caught me off guard. Deep booming voice and all... tee hee.

&gt; Look around to see if I'm on some kind of prank TV show

&gt; No cameras, all clear

&gt; ""Oh? Good for you.""

&gt; Don't bother asking questions at this point because she will tell me everyth...

&gt; ""His name is Jonah, he's 65, and he's just soooooo sweet. We've been talking for *months* and we're just absolutely in love! I'm going to go meet him this weekend! Can you work my shifts?""

&gt; I like money. I will work any shifts. I like shifts!

&gt; ""You guys haven't met?""

&gt; RW ""Oh no, we met online on a Christian dating site! He's such a wonderful person, I don't know why his last wife left him! She obviously doesn't know what she's missing out on, tee hee!""

&gt; First thought: Does he know how large she is?

&gt; Second thought: Christians and divorce lol

&gt; Third thought: Figures the only place she'd find someone to date is on the internet

I DO NOT MEAN THIS AS A SLIGHT TOWARD INTERNET DATING, ONLY TO HER, SWEARS

&gt; ""Yeah, I'll work your shifts. No problem. So he's divorced then?""

&gt; RW ""Oh, well no. He's *separated* right now. His divorce will be final in six months.""

&gt; ""You do know you only have to be separated six months to qualify for divorce, right?""

&gt; RW ""Yeah, his wife just moved out last week. He told me they'd been separated for two years, but because they were cohabiting they couldn't get a divorce yet.""

&gt; Things smell fishier than usual in this retail ocean!

We'll fast forward here to after they've met, because the rest of that conversation was just how AWESOME her newly separated internet Christian boyfriend was.

Fade into Monday after the meet up!

&gt; Dat morning shift! etc

&gt; Rollie pollie RW in at 11:30 like clockwork (she is at least punctual for her shifts)

&gt; RW ""OH MY GOOOOOOOSH VIZA I HAD THE BEST WEEKEND!""

&gt; ""Oh? That's nice. I guess he was everything you thought he could be.""

&gt; RW ""Everything and more! WE'RE ENGAGED!"" *ring flash*

&gt; Deer in the headlights like a mofo

&gt; Maybe if I don't say anything she'll just keep talking

&gt; GREAT SUCCESS

&gt; RW ""You wouldn't believe how tiny he is! I told him that his last wife obviously didn't feed him properly and he needed a woman who could put some meat on his bones, tee hee.""

&gt; ""Yeah, I bet you'd have no trouble with that.""

&gt; RW ""I think she starved him out of spite because their relationship failed. I'll get him eating proper meals in NO TIME. He's going to move in with me and mom next month!""

&gt; ""...Don't you think you're moving a little fast?""

&gt; RW violently explodes like I have never seen before, fire from the fucking blowhole

&gt; RW ""You have NO ROOM to lecture me on what to do in my own personal LIFE! You're living in SIN with your boyfriend! You don't know anything about Jonah, how DARE you judge our love based on your shallow relationships!""

&gt; ""If he's moving in with you, you'll be living in sin, too.""

&gt; RW ""Hah, shows what you know. We're *engaged* and my mother will be there with us so it's perfectly *fine*.""

&gt; ""Yeah, whatever. Congrats I guess.""

&gt; RW ""Unlike *some* people, I know how to keep a man, too, since I know how to cook. He also couldn't keep his hands off me, so he obviously has good taste in delicate, feminine woman.""

&gt; Delicate as a fucking cactus

&gt; ""RW, if you don't want me to butt in on your life, maybe you should consider taking your own advice and staying out of mine? It's pretty rude.""

&gt; RW ""It's not rude! Everything I'm saying is absolutely correct! You *need* to know how to cook to keep your man happy. And *you* need to put on weight, because I'm *sure* your boyfriend doesn't like touching all those nasty bones sticking out of you. I don't even see how he could ever have sex with you without bruising himself!""

&gt; TOO FAR, MOTHER FUCKER

&gt; ""If you don't shut up right now, I'm going take this to HR as harassment. You have no right to discuss my sex life in front of customers and fellow coworkers. It's embarrassing and improper for such a *delicate, feminine woman*.""

&gt; RW smirks ""I guess you can't handle the fire and that's why you stay out of the kitchen.""

RW saunters off to put her shit away and take over for me so I can go home.

1374182346.0	1il5ht	Chubs McNasty: The Roommate from Hamplanet Hell Part 2	gunpowdergelatine	678	139	118	"Thanks to a comment, Chubs McNasty will now be known as Barfield for her egregious mistreatment of lasagna. 

For the intro to the horror, check out [Part 1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ikg16/chubs_mcnasty_the_roommate_from_hamplanet_hell/)

This is a long one about the further suffering of our couch, our eyes, our sensibilities, and our car, but it sets up for the grand finale. 

Last time, we left off with the Skinny, Cranky, and I making the fateful decision to allow this she-beast into our precious living space. In all fairness, we thought it would work out for the first week or so. She brought a new table for the kitchen (red flag 1) and about $500 worth of groceries (red flag 2). At this time, she had also declared herself a full-fledged vegetarian (other than the occasional accidentally-inhaled rodent, I assume). 

At this point, Skinny, Cranky, and I could go a month on about $500 worth of groceries. We weren’t eating like kings, but we weren’t starving either. Barfield (thanks, dear reader, for that brilliant nickname) came with this cornucopia and told us we were welcome to share it all. We were surprised, as this is uncommon for hamplanets, but pleasantly so. We extended her the same courtesy. 

The following events happened the first day Barfield moved in. 

I’ll admit, I checked out her food to see if there was anything I wanted to eat. There wasn’t. It was all Dr. Carotid’s Deep-Fried Broccoli Product Patties and Breaded Fried Pizza-Wrapped Oreos with Mayonnaise and it was all pre-frozen. I suppose it was all technically meat-free, but Barfield had apparently fallen prey to the fallacy that vegetarian food is automatically healthy food. Our freezer had become a food farce. Oh well. So I stuck to my own groceries. Until I realized that my own groceries were going missing. 

&gt; Hearing noises from the other room, I yell, 

&gt; “Barfield, do you know what happened to the produce I brought home yesterday?”

&gt; “Mmmmghghcmcmmmmmmmhhmmmph”

&gt; “I beg your pardon?” 

&gt; Barfield takes a moment to swallow her momentous bite. 

&gt; “Oh, I thought we were sharing our food!” 

I knew I wasn’t going to like what I saw when I went into the living room, but I went anyway. I had to do it. I had to know. 

&gt; “Are you eating whole heads of broccoli?” 

&gt; “Well yeah, if I’m going to eat the whole thing it seems stupid to cut it up…”

&gt; “Did you finish that bottle of dressing?” 

&gt; “Yeah, why did you guys buy the small bottle?” 

There was Barfield, sitting in my living room on the couch that she still didn’t accept had given up the ghost under her enormous weight, with an empty bottle of ranch dressing in one hand, an empty grocery bag on her lap, and one last stalk of broccoli in her giant, meaty fist. I had just bought that stuff (a pile of broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, and some turkey, roast beef, and cheese for sandwiches) and it should have lasted me for a week. Instead, it didn’t make it even 24 hours. The bottle of dressing was brand new. She had consumed this entire feast… in one sitting. Are we seeing a theme here? 

&gt; “Listen, I know we agreed to share food, but would you mind not finishing everything at once like that? I was planning on that lasting me for a while (poor starving student that I am) and I didn’t get any of it.” 

&gt; “God, I knew you didn’t want to share. If you were going to have a problem with it, you should have just said so. There’s no need to be so passive-aggressive about it. I know *skinny* people don’t eat like normal people, so I figured you wouldn’t mind. Besides, I’m just trying to be *healthy*.” 

I have never heard anyone say the word “skinny” with such utter disdain. As if being thin is a disease. I just stood there, dumbfounded. And eating “healthy” is fine, but a whole bottle of dressing negates any positive health effects you might get from eating vegetables. Also, your eating habits are not my responsibility and I don't care if you're trying to be healthy or not.  

&gt; In disgust, Barfield drops her half-eaten broccoli stalk on the couch along with the empty bottle of dressing and starts to heave herself back and forth to work up to standing upright. 

&gt; Watching in horror as the couch groans

&gt; Step back as the floor groans, too, and I realize that this building is super old and the floors actually might not hold

&gt; Barfield walks past me with a sniff, just to be sure I know how miffed she is at me

&gt; the mangled broccoli stem and slimy dressing bottle are sitting on the couch

&gt; no plate, no napkin, just sitting on the couch

&gt; she ate a week’s worth of food with her hands

&gt; beta move, clean it up, tell myself it’s just this once

Skinny, in the spirit of roommate bonding, decides we should all go out to eat together. She’s a local and she has a car, so we all pile in to go to our favorite Chinese food joint. For the record, this is a *full-sized* sedan. We’ve put four people in the back seat with no problems. We park in our usual spot in the alley nearby and everyone started to get out… except Barfield. 

&gt; “Why is your car so small?”

&gt; “Ummmmm….”

&gt; “I mean seriously, how are people even supposed to get in and out of it?”

The door was open all the way. It couldn’t go any wider, and she was straining to get out. We didn’t even know what to say and were still trying to be peaceful at this point, so we just waited around until she worked it out and we could go into the restaurant. 

We ate at this place all the time, and it was a classic Chinese food joint. Cranky’s Chinese, so he would order for us. It was also extremely cheap - for $30, we’d have four or five meals’ worth of food (we’re big on leftovers). So we sit down, order the usual (beef with broccoli, pork fried rice, fried noodles with shrimp, fried pork chops, and some grilled fish), and order not one, not two, but THREE extra plates of vegetarian fare for our lard-o-licious guest. I realize our choices weren’t particularly healthy, but going to that place was a treat and we ate very moderate amounts. 

&gt; Waiters start to bring food to the table

&gt; Barfield’s eyes get wide

&gt; Before they can even finish setting down these big, family-style dishes, she snags the fried rice and drags it over in front of her

&gt; She starts eating out of it… with the serving spoon

&gt; None of us know how to politely point out that she was using a serving spoon, so we let it go and quietly start eating 

&gt; Needless to say, none of us got any of that rice

&gt; Barfield starts in on her vegetarian dishes, still using the serving spoon

&gt; “This isn’t that great, guys, I don’t know why you like this place so much.”

&gt; Ok, rude. You know this is our little hole-in-the-wall Chinese joint and if you don’t like it, you don’t have to eat it. We’re trying to bond here. 

&gt; Barfield then decides that the problem is with the vegetarian dishes, so she starts in on what we had ordered for ourselves

&gt; Again, none of us quite knows what to say. Credit to our mothers, I guess, for the ironclad manners we were exhibiting in the face of this outrage. 

&gt; Just like with the lasagna, we all eat our fill and are contentedly sitting around chatting while Barfield keeps eating. And eating. And eating. She finishes everything we had left and then decides the vegetarian dishes aren’t so bad after all. The waiters are staring at us. She keeps eating. It’s been two or three hours, but she hasn’t slowed down. 

&gt; She only stops when the table is empty. I mean marrow-sucked-out-of-the-pork-bones empty. She had yet again eaten more than enough food to feed the three of us for a week in just one sitting. 

&gt; The check comes, and we had already decided that it was our treat because we were welcoming her into our house, so we pay. For twice the food we wanted and for no leftovers, we pay. 

At this point, Cranky had passed final judgment. He’s not easy to please in the first place, and Barfield was pushing all the wrong buttons. When we got back into the car (again with the wheezing and whining about how goddamn small full-sized sedans are), he asked her about her meal. 

&gt; “I thought you were a vegetarian, Barfield.”

&gt; “Oh I am, but sometimes I like to give myself a little treat.” 

&gt; “A little treat? Of a pile of meat? Which you ate with a serving spoon?”

&gt; Barfield’s feelings are clearly hurt and she looks to Skinny and me for help

&gt; We look at Cranky, not wanting a battle in this car with this Chinese-food-filled monster in the backseat, and he demurs… for now. 

So for the second time, Barfield has eaten a week’s worth of food for three people in one sitting. She is baffled at the thought that vegetarians can’t eat meat sometimes for a treat. We are baffled that she can maintain so much mass without eating meat all the time. We are also through feeding the beast. We put an end to the food-sharing then and there. 

&gt; get back to the apartment

&gt; retreat to our own rooms to avoid confrontation

&gt; suddenly, a noise

&gt; a noise like thunder and the end of the world

&gt; Barfield is in the shower

&gt; and I imagine parts of the shower must have been in Barfield

&gt; it’s a stall shower, and we can hear her flapping against the sides and…  I shudder to remember… squeaking

&gt; yes, the fit was so tight that she was actually squeaking against the shower walls

&gt; how well is that marble attached to the wall? 

&gt; she gets out and knocks on my door

&gt; “I want the other bathroom.” 

Skinny and I shared a bathroom with a full-sized shower and Cranky had shared the other bathroom with our departed fourth roommate. When Barfield moved in, it just made sense for her to take the fourth’s spot. 

&gt; “Why?”

&gt; I know perfectly well why. 

&gt; I know your gigantic circumference is greater than the perimeter of that shower stall.  

&gt; “Because I’m bigger than either of you, so I should have the bigger bathroom.” 

&gt; Wrong. Not giving up my bathroom. Not for fatlogic, not for anything. 

&gt; “Well, you knew which bathroom you would be using. This one is mine and Skinny’s.”

&gt; “You’re just being a bitch because you’re so tiny.”

&gt; What? Science: bitchiness is directly correlated with small size

&gt; “Either way, you can’t have that bathroom. Make it work.” 

&gt; Cranky is watching from the door to his room, sniggering. 

&gt; Barfield stomps off; pictures jump off the walls. 

&gt; It has been one day, and I know the fight has only just begun.

1372423621.0	1h8tjh	Submitted to the approval of the Midnight society, I call this story “Tale of a Ghastly Fatass” pt1	idgygdi	675	142	95	"&gt; High-five if you got that reference there. Yes, I’m Canadian.

This story takes place one summer night in July 2012.

&gt; Be me, 6’4 190lbs. Healthy, fit, take care of myself, watch what I eat and how much I eat.

&gt; Don’t Be GhasFa, 5’5 320lbs. Everything I’m not.

&gt; Camping at Sandbanks with some friends from school. (Sandbanks is a Provincial Park in Ontario. White sandy beaches, lot of sun and water nearby. Great time to be had by all.)

&gt; Setting up our tents, the music, the tarps (what Canadian goes camping without tarps? Provisions for rain.), the coolers, the beer, the campfire, the food.

&gt; I’ve done this camping thing before and I brought along an extra tarp to put under and over my tent, and a big one at that so I could park my car underneath it and leave the windows open for music and power, etc

&gt; Sweet! All set up and ready to roll. Start cooking the pre-marinated steaks over the open fire, boiling the potatoes and the asparagus. Going to be a sweet campfire meal by the fire with my beers.

&gt; Some of the late comers to our party show up around 8pm. It’s starting to get dark but they have at least 30 minutes to set up their sites with daylight quickly disappearing.

&gt; Enter GhasFa; the definition of Rolly Polly. As she gets out of her car the tires breathe a sigh of relief, the shocks take a load off and the air-ride suspension sounds like it’s ready to be re-born again.

&gt; “Hi Guys! What’s going on?” she says as another friend chimes in and says “We’re just getting ready for the night. Setting up our tents and whatnot, then we’re going to start cooking our food.”

&gt; “OHHHH, What you guys bring? I have cold cuts, a TURKEY, cheese bread, candy, and cheese.”

Here we are thinking that she brought the turkey to share with everyone. We were all looking at each other impressed because she did this.

&gt; “Thanks for bringing a turkey, GhasFa. That was pretty thoughtful.” I say

&gt; “Sorry guys, if I had known you wanted some, I would have brought two. I haven’t eaten all day!”

&gt; “Ohh, OK GhasFa.”

Anyway, she goes and sets her tent up behind the line of cars at the front of the site. Struggling, she calls out for help.

&gt; I walk around the cars only to see she has taken the tarp over my tent. Great, I think to myself. I’m already half in the bag so I don’t care much. It’s only one tarp and we still have the huge tarp over head. I pipe up and say “Who took me tarp?” I get more Irish the more I drink

&gt; She announces proudly “I did. You already have enough tarps and I forgot mine. I didn’t think you’d mind.” (Notice the lack of apology)

&gt; I get a little miffed but whatever, it’s not going to put a damper on my weekend. I came here to sleep, drink, eat, swim, and drink some more. Maybe combinations of them all, too.

&gt; I help her put up her tent, get her shit all settled and before we’re done, she starts cooking leaving me to finish with the poles. I gave her shit for leaving me alone setting up HER tent immediately and barked at her to come back. “The food isn’t going anywhere.” I say. She snarls and waddles back over my way.

&gt; We finish and then she goes off and gets her food all prepared. I decide to go for a dip sneak off with my girlfriend for some dippin-skinny. My gf was 5’11 and maybe 155lbs. I never asked, you’re not supposed to, right? Healthy, none-the-less.

&gt; It starts to rain and so we make our way out of the water, get dressed, head back to the campsite and join the party. Fire is huge, we’re covered by trees and it’s turning out to be a wicked night. Little spurts of rain here and there but it’s a sticky 28degrees Celsius at 11pm. (About 82F) Pretty humid too.

&gt; At about 3am, the humidity breaks and the site gets DUMPED on. I mean, desecrated by rain. Raining solid until we all wake up at around 9:30/10am. Beautiful day at that point, so I lay in my nice dry sleeping bag with my girlfriend next to me. Beauty night, great sleep. I get up to go make eggs and bacon for everybody.

&gt; My car is uncovered with the driver’s window STILL WIDE OPEN. The tarp covering it is missing. I shout out a very loud “FUCK” and people start to gather around to see what’s up. The inside of my car is soaked. Everything in it? Soaked. My laptop? Soaked. My clothes? Soaked. EVERYTHING is drenched and still dripping.

&gt; GhasFa makes her way around the line of cars and says “What’s up everybody? Why does everyone look so panicked?”

At this point, I’m steaming. Someone stole my tarp, ruined my car and everything in it.

&gt; “Someone took my tarp last night and left my car window open. They keys are right there IN THE IGNITION and whoever took it, didn’t bother to roll the windows up.”

&gt; “Shitty.” She says. “I’m starving. Did someone mention breakfast?”

I brush it off; I’ll deal with it later. I’m too livid right now to be so stressed with nothing in my system. Go back behind my buddies car to grab the bacon, eggs, etc.

&gt; I look up at GhasFa’s tent and notice a second tarp over her tent. It took a while to register but when it did – I exploded.

&gt; “GhasFa! Did you take the tarp off my car? Why the fuck would you do that without closing my goddamn window? You ruined EVERYTHING INSIDE.”

&gt; She says “Well it started to rain and then I noticed my cooler (plastic, protected from the elements if it’s closed properly) getting wet and I figured you wouldn’t mind if I borrowed a second one too.”

&gt; “We were listening to music all night, out of my car stereo. You how do you think the music got out of the car? Didn’t you notice that my window was open?”

&gt; “Well, yeah but we have that big tarp over everything so I thought that would stop the rain!”

FTR, the big tarp over everyone’s tents was only over everyone’s tent... not the car. This was obvious and apparent by the addition of the second tarp.

&gt; “I had the second tarp over the car to protect the inside from the rain so we could keep the window open and listen to music!”

&gt; “Well you shouldn’t have left your window open then. Not my fault!” then she jaunts off to go make her own breakfast.

Now, when I say everything was ruined I mean EVERYTHING. The seats were sponges full of water. The whole car had that musty smell from something being left in the rain all night.

&gt; My gf goes off and confronts her. “GhasFa, why did you take our tarp? All of our things were in that car. You didn’t even ASK if you could take it. You know Idgygdy is a nice guy and would have given it to you if you had asked and if he had a chance to roll up his windows. Why do you have to be such a selfish bitch?”

&gt; She defends herself and says only “MY FOOD!” 

&gt; We all go off and start drying out the damaged goods from the car and salvage what is salvageable... which turns out to be about 10% of the stuff in my car and just happened to be the 10% that I didn’t care about.

&gt; GhasFa waddles over and by noon, I’m fuming. She sits down and asks “Hey Guys, what’s for lunch?” My gf asks, “Didn’t you bring a TURKEY?” GhasFa says “Well yeah but I got hungry last night...”

&gt; Everyone in almost perfect unison shouts “You’re on your own!” then walks away shaking their heads.

&gt; We all go swimming and leave GhasFa to herself. We actually had a pretty enjoyable day at the beach. Got a nice tan, my shit was all drying out in the sun, things were on the up-and-up.

&gt; Sun starts to set and we get hungry. We headed back to the campsite and GhasFa was missing. As was her tent, car, and two of my tarps. Great, she packed up and left with MY shit.

&gt; My buddy pipes up and says “HEY! Where the hell did my food go?” Everyone scrambles to their coolers to find them pretty much empty. We all had enough food for the weekend and there was a party of 10 of us. 12 if you count GhasFa, who was now gone.

As the girls offered to go off and do a bit of grocery shopping, the guys stayed back and all but plotted an assassination.

To tie up this story, we all had a good day/night after she was gone. Still livid from the stolen food, tarp and wet everything, but we managed to make it an alright rest of the weekend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry that I have been unable to update with more stories as of late, I had intended to post three more since the last one. Unfortunately I have been in hospital. On Monday morning (3/6/13) I was walking out of my house to leave for the day and tripped down our front door step and tumbled down the other three steps. I put my broken hand out to break the fall and it turns out casts are not indestructible who knew guys!!! Haha. I damaged the cast and re-broke my fingers and mangled it up pretty badly. I went to the hospital at 10am and was told I'd need surgery,  had surgery at 2pm and was out of hospital at 10am the next morning. God bless the NHS. I'm doing fine I just need to take it easy and not fall over my feet for the next two months and I should be good. Also, I'm never going to the beach with Porkplanet ever again, since that is what got me into the mess to begin with. 

So now I bare the (physical) scars from the surgery as well as the emotional and will forever have a reminder of Porkplanets infliction upon me for the rest of my life.... I can't say this has done well to bond our already failing friendship further... She has been a pain for a while now, and although she didn't intend to break my fingers to begin with, still has yet to acknowledge she played some part in it. Whatever, I can handle it, perhaps this whole thing has been the shock I needed to realize she's a risk to be around and friends with. 

Here is a little story of when PorkPlanet visited me in the hospital Monday evening, and it also portrays the general  idea of how fucking awful she is in public places and makes everything about her.


&gt; 8pm Monday evening.

&gt; Be in hospital. Two hours out of surgery. 

&gt; Feeling awful. 

&gt; Parents couldn't make it in time (2 hours away) because Cuteguy couldn't get a hold of them till late in the afternoon. So they promise to come take me home in the morning instead. 

&gt; iwantmymummy.gif 

&gt; Whatever, housemates are visiting. Bringing food because I missed mealtime and all the hospital could offer was a sandwhich. It will be ok. 

&gt; Suddenly, vinyl on hospital floor is splitting. 

&gt; Lights flickering. Power cuts out. 

&gt; Generators fail. Patients die. 

&gt; JK Porkplanet is just visiting you guys!!!

&gt; Porkplanet dramatically whips the curtain back 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""OH ME GERDDDD IMGONNAMAKEIT ARE YOU OHKAY?""

&gt; Me: ""Yes I'm alright I'm just knackered"".

&gt; AS, KK and Two other housemates appear. 

&gt; KK: ""We brought you the Chicken Pasta in the fridge you wanted from home"". 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I WANTED TO GET YOU A DOMINO PIZZAAAAA THEY HAVE A HOT DOG STUFFED CRUST NOW!!111""

&gt; AS: ""Shut the fuck up, you're loud and the last thing she wants to eat is a big greasy pizza, Porkplanet""

&gt; Me: ""She's right PorkPlanet, plus I can't afford to be eating shitty food all the time now that I'm not able to go to the gym or anything""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH"".

&gt; Me: ""I get my strength from eating good food, I'll be fine""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""YOU LOOK TERRIBLE"".

&gt; AS: ""SHE LOOKS TERRIBLE BECAUSE SHE JUST HAD SURGERY UNDER GENERAL ANESTHETIC A FEW HOURS AGO. SHE'S TIRED CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP"".

&gt; Cuteguy, who was already here, is sat next to me sniggering. The patient in the bed next to me is laughing out loud. She was in her 80's. 


Sidenote: I have gained 3lb since I broke my hand. Considering I have lost 80lb+, it's only a small gain... but the weight loss crew here will know how awful any gain feels. Oh, and tensions between AS and PorkPlanet are thick and mounting daily if you haven't already noticed. They get along, because we're all housemates and have to, but since the Outfit saga (see Chapter One) at the start of the year, AS has nothing but disdain for PorkPlanet. Cuteguy and Porkplanet are at war with one another at the moment, too, basically because Porkplanet is hugely jealous of our relationship and thinks he's ""taking me away"" from him. According to her, we were ""the best of friends"" before he came along, yeah right...

&gt; Two minutes later. Porkplanet sits on edge of my bed. She obviously can't stand and hold her weight up any longer, and there are no chairs left around. 

&gt; Edge of bed visibly bows to about half a foot lower than it was a second previous. 

&gt; AS cringing. Other housemates cringing. I decide to leave it. The thing didn't break straight away after all. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME THIS MORNING I WOULD OF COME WITH YOU.""

&gt; KK: ""Stop being so loud. There are patients sleeping all around us""

&gt; Me: ""Cuteguy was there, he came with me"". 

&gt; Porkplanet (visibly flustered): ""You needed someone close with you"". 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""The hospital only let family or partners to stay. Plus, I had to keep in touch with her family"" and his cheeky grin showing Porkplanet who's boss. 

&gt; Porkplanets can't even hide her jealousy. 

&gt; AS: ""Why do you even care so much Porkplanet""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I'm her BEST friend. We're basically family"". 

&gt; WHAT

Suddenly, a wild Senior Nurse appears. The kind who doesn't take any shit from anyone, the best kind. 

&gt; Nurse: ""You there, can you get off that bed please"". 

&gt; Porkplanet acts like she didn't hear her. 

&gt; AS: ""She's talking to you Porkplanet"". 

&gt; Nurse: ""There is a weight limit of up to 150kg per bed. One patient only. Plus it's infection control""

&gt; Porkplanets is visibly flusted,  utter the word ""weight"" at her direction and she gets upset even if it's not intended to insult her. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""There are no chairs left anywhere"". 

&gt; Nurse: ""Then stand. But GET.OFF.THE.BED"".

&gt; Patient in next bed still laughing out loud to herself. 

She got off the bed, the damn thing jostled back up into it's original form when she got off it. She's now standing. Arms crossed. The Nurse hangs around in my bay for the rest of the visit dealing with other patients and giving some drugs. Also, she's probably keeping an eye on the disruptive PorkPlanet. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""IM GOIN TAKE CURR OF YOU WHEN YOUR HOME. I HAVE THE WEEK OFF!!!""

&gt; Cuteguy: ""imgonnamakeit is going home though to her parents, they're picking her up tomorrow morning when she's discharged""

&gt;  Porkplanet: ""BRILL IDEA. I'LL COME WITH  YOU. THAT WAY I CAN LOOK OUT FOR YOU""

&gt; Porkplanet thinks since she spent the weekend with us and everyone else over the bank holiday weekend a few weekends ago at my parents house, she's now part of the family. 

&gt; Me: ""Actually, cuteguy is coming with me to my parents. He has the week off as well"". 

&gt; Porkplanet goes red in the face. Her jimmies are rustled.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHY IS **HE** GOING HOME WITH YOU?""

&gt; AS: ""Uh, probably because HE is her boyfriend, Porkplanet"". 

&gt; Nurse appears again from behind curtain. 

&gt; Nurse: ""Can **YOU** keep quiet please. There are 24 patients on this ward and a lot of them elderly and sleeping already"". She directs this at Porkplanet. 

&gt; Porkplanet just goes ""ugh"" not even a sorry, nothing. Ignores her again.

&gt; Nurse looking increasingly pissed off. Leaves curtain open this time and goes back to drug trolly. 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""We're going to have a lovely week. Once she's feeling better, we're gonna drive to Cardiff for the day and visit Cardiff Bay. I am excited"" he's grinning, just rubbing the salt in Porkplanets gaping, fleshy wounds.

&gt; AS: ""Awh take lots of pictures you guys!!!"" she's also joining in the rubbing salt game, and grinning. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WELL CAN'T I COME?""

&gt; Me: ""Well, it's probably best we just go. I don't want to overcrowd my parents, they're working all week.""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""FINE IM GONNA BE SO BORED ALL WEEK I CAN'T BELIEEVE CUTEGUY TAKES PRIORITY, AGAIN.""

&gt; I'm too tired and barely keeping my eyes open to even argue that.

Suddenly, the Nurse slams the lid down on her drug cart and stomps over. 

&gt; Nurse: ""You have one more warning about being loud. And then I'm going to ask you to leave.""

&gt; AS: ""Seriously Porkplanet. You're so fucking embarrassing. You caused all this to begin with too."" 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AS"".

&gt; AS: ""Meaning you broke her hand at the beach and now it's lead to surgery. You know what I mean"". 

Porkplanet squared up to AS at this point, and the Nurse was stood roughly between them at the open curtain. I had never seen the two of them look so angry at one another. It was so intense, and embarrassing. The whole time too, AS and everyone were talking in hush tones and Porkplanet was being loud. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""YOU'RE BEING A FUCKING BITCH AND RUINING THE VISIT, AS"".

&gt; Cuteguy: ""No YOU are being the bitch, and ruining the whole visit and making things awkward, Porkplanet"". 

&gt; Nurse: ""Right that's it. YOU are leaving"" directed at Porkplanet. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""NOT FAIRRRRRRR"" she storms out, not even so much as a goodbye, she was here for 10 minutes and exhausted me further. AS, KK and other housemates leave soon after. Cuteguy stayed another hour. I was so upset and apologized to staff profusely all night. 

So there we have it. When the girls got home, AS and Porkplanet had a screaming fight for nearly 20 minutes. KK has a clip of it on her phone. I can't physically wait to hear it Monday when I get back. 

Hope jimmies have been rustled and you enjoyed!

Alright, this is how it all ends. Thanks for sticking with me this far, fps. Cranky was moving out of the apartment at the end of the year and decided to take Skinny, her family, and me out to dinner. Note that Barfield was not on that list. Terrific. We were going to a nice Chinese restaurant that we had been looking forward to trying. So, we all get dressed up and head out the door to meet Skinny’s family.

&gt; casually walking down the stairs, excited for dinner 

&gt; thud

&gt; thump thump

&gt; wobble wobble crash!!!

&gt; “Guys!”

&gt; we’re confused; we’re looking around for the source of this racket

&gt; then she comes lumbering down the stairs

&gt; “Guys! You started to leave without me!”

&gt; yes. and we will continue to leave without you, because this is not your party.

&gt; “Ummm, we didn’t know you were planning on coming…”

&gt; Skinny is trying to be diplomatic.

&gt; Cranky is looking apoplectic; this meal is on his dime.

&gt; “Of course I’m coming! It’s a roommate dinner!”

&gt; “Well no, it’s not. It’s a dinner with Skinny’s family. I’m going because Skinny and I are effectively family.” 

&gt; please get the hint

&gt; you are not welcome here

&gt; “Well we all live together, so we’re all practically family.”

&gt; no

&gt; we are not

&gt; Cranky can’t handle this

&gt; “You’re not invited.”

&gt; he announces this flat out, because obviously subtlety was lost on the hambeast

&gt; “Hahaha, very funny. Let’s go!”

&gt; seriously? we don’t even know what to do

&gt; “Barfield, this is a private thing.”

&gt; apparently I was still hoping that tact would get through to her

&gt; “Well…”

&gt; we walk toward the car 

&gt; she follows

&gt; then she stops at the curb

&gt; “Why don’t you guys just swing around and pick me up?”

&gt; “Nope.”

&gt; the three of us, in unison

&gt; so she follows us to the car

&gt; “What the hell guys? You know my knee is hurt.”

&gt; we didn’t know

&gt; and we don’t care

&gt; and if we get to the car without you, we will leave you here

Nothing spurred Barfield like the thought of a meal, so she put on a tremendous burst of speed, matched our walking pace, and got to the car. I think she could sense that we were trying to leave her behind. No one knew how to put her off. 

&gt; “Seriously, dude. Go away.”

&gt; Cranky, for whom tact is blessedly no issue

&gt; “You’re so funny! I can’t wait to go to this restaurant!”

&gt; “Which restaurant are we going to again?”

&gt; I asked because I had the feeling she didn’t know

&gt; and she didn’t

&gt; “Stop asking stupid questions heeheehee”

&gt; and she gets in the car

&gt; “Get out of the car.”

&gt; Cranky appears to be evaluating his odds of physically forcing her out of the car

&gt; they weren’t good

&gt; “Come on, we’ll be late.” 

This girl didn’t even know where we were going. She did know that none of us liked her and that none of us had spoken to her all year. Apparently she was planning on pretending the past six months or so hadn’t happened at all. The rest of us were not so keen; Cranky tried to tell her not to come. He tried to tell her she wasn’t welcome. She wouldn’t listen. So off we went. 

&gt; roll into the restaurant

&gt; swanky new Chinese joint

&gt; never feed a hambeast Chinese food 

&gt; Skinny’s parents know the saga and are obviously surprised to see Barfield

&gt; she acts like nothing is wrong and hugs them

&gt; visible disgust

&gt; cringe in sympathy; her odor is truly stunning 

&gt; everyone sits and orders

&gt; Skinny, Cranky, her parents, and I order two apps and three entrees 

&gt; “Well, guys, I have to order my own food because I’m a vegetarian.”

&gt; two of the dishes we ordered were vegetarian

&gt; all were family-style

&gt; we point this out

&gt; “Yeah, but they’re not *real* vegetarian.”

&gt; please, lardmonster, enlighten us as to what a real vegetarian dish contains

&gt;we're stunned and confused

&gt; this is what she was hoping for 

&gt; she turns to the waiter and orders three more entrees

&gt; let me repeat that, so we’re clear

&gt; three. more. family. style. entrees. 

Now as I mentioned, Skinny’s parents had heard of our plight. They had not, however, had to witness Barfield in action. It was sort of majestic, really, like the first transcontinental railroad or the migration of a blue whale. So vast and unstoppable, you just couldn’t quite fathom it. We finished most of our food and waited while she continued to eat. And eat. And order four or five virgin tropical drinks (we were not yet of age). And eat some more. She wasn’t fast, but she was thorough. And Skinny’s parents got to witness the carnage firsthand. 

&gt; “It’s getting a little late, we should probably be going.” 

&gt; Skinny’s mom likes to go to bed early

&gt; “Oh, no worries, you guys go ahead.”

&gt; this meal was to thank them

&gt; and you want them to just leave so you can finish your gluttonous feast?

&gt; they’re too polite for that, so they sit and wait it out

&gt; she finishes everything

&gt; the bill comes

&gt; Cranky takes it 

&gt; looks at it for a minute

&gt; I can tell he’s not a happy camper 

&gt; he pays, then carefully folds up the receipt and keeps it 

&gt; say our goodbyes, head back to the apartment

&gt; go inside

&gt; “Alright, Barfield. That’ll be $200.”

&gt; Cranky’s pissed.

&gt; “What?!?! If I had known you were going to try to make me pay for myself, I wouldn’t have come!”

&gt; “I tried to tell you to stay. I told you that you weren’t welcome. You insisted on coming.” 

&gt; “Well there’s no way it cost you $200. That’s just ridiculous.” 

&gt; out comes the receipt

&gt; he’s right

&gt; she just ate and drank $200

&gt; her meal alone cost more than feeding the other five of us

&gt; “Well I’m not paying that. You told me I wouldn’t have to pay.”

&gt; “I never said that. I never said anything like that. I just said you weren’t invited. I told you to get the fuck out of the car. This wasn’t for you and I can’t afford to feed you.  I don’t know how *you* afford to feed you.”

&gt; Cranky’s looking at us for backup

&gt; “Barfield, pay him. He said you weren’t invited and you more than doubled the tab. That’s ridiculous.”

&gt; Cranky’s right and Barfield’s a bitch. 

A word on Cranky and Barfield: he had long ago decided she was subhuman. He simply referred to her as “the whale” or “lardbucket.” He had no qualms about demonstrating his disgust for her both to her face and in public. 

&gt; “Fuck you guys. I don’t have to take this and I don’t have to pay for that.”

&gt; she thunders into her own room

&gt; he and I look at each other, trying to decide the best way to deal with this

&gt; but then she comes back

&gt; without clothes

&gt; “Holy shit where the fuck are your clothes are you fucking crazy?!?!”

&gt; Cranky’s eyes are bleeding

&gt; from the look of things, her clothes were actually doing a pretty good job of holding her in

&gt; take a second look, she’s wearing underwear… or something

&gt; at least, something seems to be cutting into her boob sacks and her ass flab

&gt; “What? I’m just going to take a shower?”

&gt; nope

&gt; Cranky’s done

&gt; I start laughing; I can see him go red in the face and I can’t even look at her and I know he’s about to blow

&gt; “You think it’s fucking cute to roll out like that? Nobody wants to see that! What the fuck are you thinking?”

&gt; she just looks sort of smug 

&gt; “You fat bitch…”

&gt; he starts

&gt; and she reaches out and slaps him in the face

&gt; “Don’t you *ever* call me fat!”

&gt; oh shit

&gt; it’s on now

&gt; Cranky doesn’t even pause to rub the gigantic red welt that’s coming up on his face

&gt; he steps right up and slaps her back. hard. 

&gt; shock

&gt; jaw gaping open

&gt; “I’m going to say this one time, you are going to give me the $200 you owe me, and we will never speak to each other again.”

&gt; Skinny has fled for cover

&gt; watching, can’t wait to see what he has to say

&gt; “You. Fat. Bitch.”

&gt; careful enunciation

&gt; “You moved into our house and you made a fucking mess out of everything. You live like a fucking animal and I am embarrassed to know you. I’m embarrassed *for* you. The sight of you makes me sick, the smell of you makes me sick, and just knowing you’re in my house makes me lose my appetite. You’re fucking fat and the fact that you’re a vegetarian just confuses people.”

&gt; oh shit

&gt; I can’t help it

&gt; I laugh

&gt; I laugh hard

&gt; “What the fuck is so funny, bitch?”

&gt; tears streaming down my face

&gt; “You’re a vegetarian!”

&gt; collapse into uncontrollable laughter

&gt; Barfield is dumbfounded

&gt; she turns around and goes back to her room

&gt; door slams

&gt; a check for $200 slips out from under her door

&gt; Cranky goes out and cashes it right that second, for spite

&gt; the next morning, he leaves

&gt; Barfield’s door stays closed

Since this incident, none of us have spoken to Barfield. When it was time for her to leave, her family came and picked her and her stuff up and that was the end of it. Well… almost the end… 

Epilogue

When Barfield moved out, we stayed out of the way. Skinny and I had found two roommates we really liked and were looking forward to the next year. While the furniture was out of those two rooms, we figured we’d give everything a good cleaning. 

&gt; Barfield’s room…

&gt; didn’t she move out already?

&gt; what is all this…

&gt; good god

&gt; it’s trash

&gt; a mountain of trash

&gt; and she left it here as one final jab

&gt; pizza boxes

&gt; boxes from frozen food

&gt; holy shit there’s a microwave in here; have no idea when that happened

&gt; use brooms to clear this trash into bags; it takes five or six to hold everything

&gt; floor is covered in filth

&gt; spilled sauce

&gt; spilled soda

&gt; crumbs

&gt; pure grease, I assume

&gt; smell is almost worse with the covering layer of trash gone

&gt; and is that…?

&gt; oh hell no

&gt; that’s a mouse

&gt; and it’s not even afraid of us

&gt; and it’s a hamplanet of a mouse

&gt; you’ve got to be kidding me

That’s right, folks. Mice. And that first one wasn’t the only one. It took us days to get that room clean. We used soap, vinegar, pine sol, and everything else we could think of to get that scum off of the floor. There was even filth splashed on the walls where her bed had been, presumably from eating lying down in bed. She left assorted bits and pieces of furniture, all covered in muck; we tossed them immediately. It took weeks and an appalling number of mousetraps, but we finally had our apartment back. Except for the couch, of course. The couch suffered the most of all of us and there was just no recovering from that kind of abuse. 

TL;DR: Barfield and Cranky have a battle royale.

1372815749.0	1hjeb3	I will never play The Sims again...	WingardiumLevios	666	135	110	"I work at GameStop and get to see all sorts of hamplanets on a daily basis, but this one in particular took the cake, sat on it, rolled around in it, and ate it out of her fat folds. I was in the middle of cleaning up after the entire soccer team that I was apparently responsible for babysitting when the door opened and the store got dark. VERY DARK. I thought a random storm might have dropped on our city, or maybe a solar eclipse was occurring. I was wrong. Very wrong. 

What was eclipsing the sun was an older woman about 50 years old and about 350-375 lbs. She was wearing short shorts so the entire populous of our metropolis could see her legs that could only be described as a mixture of cottage cheese [large curd mind you] and Berber carpet. My coworker was trapped behind the counter and gave me the ""You've got this boss"" look. I timidly approached the beast, terrified of being engulfed in its growing mass. I asked if I could help her find something. The Curd of the Cosmos wheezed that she needed PC games, so I quickly walked across the store to show her where they were. I realized that I had walked too hastily for in my dust there was a large domesticated walrus still standing by the door attempting to practically slide her way to where I was at. It took nearly 5 minutes for her to get to where I was at. Keep in mind my store is only about 38 feet deep. 

Then it hit me. It hit me like a bus. The stench. I quickly did the ole ""well there you are, I'll be over here"" routine and got back to what I was doing before my world began crumbling around me. I heard a loud thud, much like an excited 6 year old shutting a truck door with a sledgehammer. Legitimately thought that something had broken. Look back over to see her sprawled across the floor, short shorts hiked up to nearly the point of me seeing how many lips she had. 

It was about this time that I started trying to figure out a way to sneak out of the store to take my lunch. Giant rush of people. Temporarily forget about the giant floor ornament. Then it happened.

The smell.

It cometh.

The beast approached the counter with about 7 Sims 3 games in her sausage like hands. How she got back up off the floor without a construction crew and a crane was beyond me. Grabbed the game cases and started trying to get the transaction with as quickly as possible. I heard a yordle. The creature was attempting to communicate in its native tongue. 

I look back. There is a massive green/yellow trail of snot going from her nose to her upper lip. This wasn't your average booger. This was a slug paving a path from one orifice to another. Begin scanning the games, trying to avoid looking at it. She begins wheezing and hacking. It grew. She tries to start a conversation about how she has like 200 computer games. Something about how she needs something to keep her busy when her boyfriend isn't.

Insert dry-heave here

Starts trying to have a conversation with my coworker asking if he wants to be in her Sims game. She gives him a wink and goes to lick her lips. The wild snorlax's snot trail gets caught by her tongue. It starts getting sucked up into her gaping hole of a face. She realizes that something is on her tongue, and decides slurping at it like she's reenacting the infamous spaghetti and meatball scene from Lady &amp; The Tramp will win my coworkers heart. I saw his face. He wanted to die. 

The Planet Terror starts to leave, the kids in the store begin to fall out of her orbit, but right as she's about to leave, she decides to shout/grunt out ""I wrote my number down for you, if you get lonely and want a REAL woman. My boyfriend doesn't have to know"" to my coworker.  

Neither of us said a word to each other for the next hour...

Finally had to break the silence. 

""So InsertCoworkersNameHere, you think you can handle all that woman?"" He glared at me, ran into the bathroom, puked, then asked to go home early so he could reevaluate his career.

TL;DR: Human katamari slurps up sinister snot slug while making propositions to my terrified coworker. "	t5_2vzax	True

Hope you enjoy!

&gt; Be a weekend end of March 

&gt; My (Foster) Mum is visiting. We will call her ""MotherMadeIt"".

&gt; I fucking love it when my Mum visits. 

&gt; She's funny and cute and I miss her and well - free meals all weekend, and possibility of shopping always.

&gt; Mum arrives at my house.

&gt; As expected, is barking and howling like a wolf over my transformation in the hallway of my house for nearly 5 minutes. [Her face when](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/271878/cat-surprised-face-o.gif). 
 
&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""Let's  go shopping for some new clothes for you!""

&gt; Suddenly the walls are tilting, the door hinges have bowed, the earth is splitting and trying to suck us into the core. The cat is climbing the walls.

&gt; Porkplanet is running down the stairs. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""Omg MotherMadeIt!!!"" 

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""Porkplanet how lovely to see you!!""

&gt;  They embrace. 

&gt;  [MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmnvifuquE1qfxo5oo1_500.gif) I realize nobody embraces PorkPlanet anymore except for my foster mother. Not even her own mother hugs her when she comes to visit. Make mental note to hug PorkPlanet more since I'm not a horrible human being and being hugged is nice.

&gt; quicklysnapoutofit.rar

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""We are gonna pop into town for a bit of clothes shopping. Do you want to come with us?"" 

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8u55dTeLx1qhc6la.gif) 

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""SHUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE""

MotherMadeIt is too nice. It's gonna be a long, long day. 

&gt; Be in the shopping centre about an hour later. 

&gt; Me and MotherMadeIt decide to enter one shop that does regular and plus sized clothes. I'm still plus sized. But not for long if I have my own way.
 
&gt; Porkplanet: ""Ughhh! But they never do MY plus size here!""

&gt; Me (I snap): ""We're here to buy clothes for ME PorkPlanet!"" 

&gt; [HFW](http://www.katesullivanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr-gif-shocked-i7.gif)

20 minutes later. I am in the dressing room trying on several pairs of jeans, jackets, a few dresses and regular clothes for Uni like tshirts and leggings. MotherMadeIt is going to town, but this store is pretty cheap anyway. Plus student discount!

&gt; PorkPlanet out on the shop floor looking for clothes in my size.
 
&gt; She brings back two pairs of jeans that are three sizes too big for me now. 

&gt; Me: ""Porkplanet, these aren't gonna fit."" 

&gt; PorkPlanet (acting dumb): ""What do you mean?""

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""She's three sizes smaller than that now, silly...""
 
&gt; PorkPlanet (still acting dumb): ""Oh, I didn't think she'd lost THAT much weight"".

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m80038347y1qe6l0z.gif) she knows I've lost about 45-something lb by then and she knows it because I tell her.

Side note; Porkplanet and I used to be twinnie hamplanets before I lost a tonne of weight, though there was still a huge 50-70lb difference between us. She has been in denial about my weight loss since my journey began. 

&gt; Me: ""Can you go and get one of the pairs you have in my actual size please?"" 

&gt; PorkPlanet huffs and obliges, goes back out. Comes back two 
minutes later with jeans in an actual size that fit me. Her jimmies look rustled. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""Let me know if you need a bigger size"" and a cheesy grin. 

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8grlb0z151qbelaf.gif) these jeans must fit even if I have to stay behind this curtain and starve myself for 10 days until they fit just to prove a point to this bitch. Praying in the dressing room.

&gt; Slide them up my legs. Moment of truth. 

&gt; THEY FIT. GOD LISTENED!

&gt; Suddenly, a wild idea appears.

&gt; I'm gonna show this blatent bitch who's boss. 

&gt; Start putting on a  tshirt and jacket I've also picked out in my new and improved clothes size! Feeling fabulous, this 'gun be good. 

&gt; Can hear PorkPlanet bumping her gums down the end of the dressing room to my mother.

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""She just.... is at the gym all the time you know? It's unhealthy. Plus, she doesn't eat enough.""

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""What do you mean she doesn't eat enough?"" (My mother knows I don't starve myself, not in the least. I eat HEALTHILY. She's just curious about the fatlogic).

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""Well last night we were all eating Pizza enjoying ourselves and her and AS (housemate) walk into the living room with chicken and some couscous stuff and it just didn't look enough and I'm worried for her if I'm honest"". 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/head_shake.gif) it didn't look enough for PorkPlanet because her stomach is the size of a rugby ball and mine has shrunk back down to it's normal size. 

&gt; Fuck you bitch that couscous was delicious and I was stuffed after that meal. 

&gt; I'll show you. 

&gt; Swan out of dressing room and down to the end where PorkPlanet and MotherMadeIt are sat chatting. 

&gt; [MotherMadeIt's face](http://kicksandcrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Excited-Gif.gif) when her golden child is looking good in amazing new clothes.

So having read the stories of the girl who's boyfriend got savaged by a hamplanet, it reminded me of something similar in my past, but I was the boy who had to deal with it. 

So I was 15, and my (still) girlfriend and I had started going out. She's of Sri Lankan descent, and 5'2 and about 45kg (I don't know what she is in pounds, I had to work mine out in pounds for you muricans). Anyway, there was a serious hamplanet who sat next to me in one or two of my classes, and she had a painful, painful crush on me. She looked as if the King of the Polar bears had broken a dog's face, pumped the blubber of a seal he'd recently clubbed to death into it and then injected it with smallpox to give it a suitably cratered appearence, and then put it on a human body. The body, by the way, was like a white rhino's without the grace or thick skin- she combined being stocky and being a corpulent human ball of grease in one. She was about 5' 6 and I'd say at least 220 pounds. She was also oddly confident, which I would normally embrace, but not on a personality like that. She really was monstrous, in PE we had to do basic cardio and muscle exercises- pull ups, press ups and jogging etc. She couldn't do a single pull up, press nor jog more than 200 metres without loudly and melodramatically claiming that she 'needed to throw up' to escape PE. She was so much worse in her irritating fat logic than most other big people I know, and so LOUD about it. She was always trying to flirt with all the boys, but especially me, as I actually gave her the time of day on occasions. I'm a polite guy, so I talked to her casually when I had to, but she was seriously annoying, especially about her weight, constantly talking about how she was going to start exercising for her special man (whenever she said 'special man' she'd kind of turn and give me a little wink. In her delusional fat dimension that counts as being flirty idk)

Anyway, one maths lesson I casually told her that I was going to town with my girlfriend on Saturday- her face as the sounds of 'girl' and 'friend' came out adjacent to one another was a thing to behold indeed. Apparently she hadn't heard the news. She didn't talk for the rest of the lesson and looked incredibly sulky- I hadn't quite realised the extent of her crush on me at that point. 

Anyway, it gets to Saturday and I'm walking around town with my girlfriend having a great time, when out of the corner of my eye I see something that I wish to never see again in my life...hamplanet trying to look sexy in skinny girl clothes. I honestly believe bigger women can look fantastic when they wear clothes that suit them, but this was just a tragedy against mankind. Short shorts that strained against her leg blubber, which sagged slightly due to gravity, her club-like feet squeezed into dainty dolly shoes which had already burst a few seams, a top that was far too small and showed far too much, her belly strained against the thin material. She was approaching- well waddling really- rapidly, and I tried to ignore her, but she had me in her sights. 
'Heeeey LordCreamCheese, didn't expect to see you here!'
I pretended not to hear.
'LordCreamCheese, why are you with her? I thought you said you were meeting me?'

Will be continued, it gets much better, can't be bothered to do the rest just now, it's quite the saga!

______________________________________________________________________________________________

PART II!

So we're in the middle of town in front of ~200 people, and I'm mortified. My girlfriend is very shy, and is practically trembling at the sight of the towering beast that approaches, snorting like a wildebetusbeast chomping down on McFood for her thyroid 'n' sugars. 

'Who's this then?' she roars in a faux-jovial manner, and shoves her way past me to confront my girlfriend, who has never met her before. 'Do you mind if we just go for a walk, just need to talk your *boyfriend* ' she manages to sneer between her thick fatty lips, before planting another bite of a McDonalds burger into her maw. My girlfriend basically shrinks and dies, as any sensible person would when approached with this nightmarish sight. Lardjungle, being her obnoxious self, takes this as a yes and pulls me by my HAND- my delicate, innocent hand clasped between her clammy, sausage-like appendages in front of an increasingly large crowd. I try to signal to my girlfriend to intervene and save me, but she can't even move having been confronted by such a beast. 

I soon manage to pull my hand free, and she turns around and gives me a hurt look 'Why did you stop holding my hand? You know how you feel about me! All those looks in maths lessons...' and tries to do puppy eyes- looking more like a rhuematic pug that needs to be put down. 

'Look, Hamplanet, I value your friendship (first lie) but I really don't think of us like that!' 

She flips, big time.

'You ignorant, obnoxious, male pig! Just because she's skinny and I'm big, but look at her stick insect arms- wouldn't you rather have someone like me?' (To be honest, I can't quite remember this conversation, but this is the brunt of what she said). She actually *twirled* and winked at me, incidentally showing the sweat patches that have developed on the tight linen of her shirt. I really haven't been able to describe how unattractive this woman is, even if she wasn't the size of a small car she wouldn't be pretty. 

'I'll win you over, you know in your heart you love me!' and with this she stormed off, the first of many public embarrassments she would cause me. 

I return to my girlfriend, and she gives me a massive hug- unaware that this is merely the start of the ordeal.

Next the internet stalking stage...

PART III (the dangers of the internet)

So I go home that evening to find myself the recipient of not one, not two, not five, but FIFTEEN messages from the Queen of Lard. Starting, gratifyingly, with a cringeworthy apology and descending into angry messages asking why I 'betrayed' her, attachments of her dressed in cosplay costumes that are meant for skinny girls (Misty doesn't suit bulges...it was worse than [THIS](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fat+misty+cosplay&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45175338,d.d2k&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=YC5oUbamA4XS0QXF8YHgBA#imgrc=6BWqGz2ZaMYWUM%3A%3BIm0XFwWF0VTgqM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fimg3.joyreactor.com%252Fpics%252Fpost%252Fgeek-cosplay-anime-erotic-355333.jpeg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fjoyreactor.com%252Ftag%252Fmisty%3B735%3B980)) and eventually turning into her making up rumours about my girlfriend and even starting to be racist. She had liked all my facebook pictures and written on my wall a couple of times too. The last message offered me some naked pictures to 'persuade you that my curves are better than her twigs ;)'. This is when, for me, it stopped being funny and got really, really scary. My girlfriend then rang me to tell me she was being bombarded with hate on her tumblr from my chubby stalkers account and emails from a throwaway account giving her death threats and attacking her body size...her tumblr was full of emotional self posts about how hurt she was and how she was comfort eating because her special man didn't really love her back, even some suicidal posts. 


After this, some more stalkerish things happened. She started posting pictures of me on her tumblr, talking about how pretty I was (she thought it was private, but our entire school had the password thanks^to^me )and how she wanted to 'eat me up' like a McDonalds. One time I tweeted saying I was going to the cinema with my girlfriend, and half way through, through the darkness a hand protruded offering me some popcorn and it was LardJesus herself, taking up two seats and shoving two handfuls of toffee coated popcorn from an XXL bag into her remorseless gob. She then spent the rest of the film putting her head in between our heads whenever we got close to give me her stupid, asinine thoughts on how the plot was advancing and once just to whisper 'I miss you', spurting crumbs of popcorn into my ear canal.

PART 4 (le party- a cautionary tale; whales shouldn't drink)

So this girl has been stalking me and trying to ruin my relationship for a solid 3 or 4 months by now, but my relationship is going very well despite her attempts to break me. A friend of my best friend was having a party, and she also happened to be acquainted with the Lord of the Greasy Seas i.e. my stalker.

So myself and my girlfriend arrive at the party, and it's pretty decent. I'm staying sober because I hadn't really started drinking at that point, and I don't really mind not drinking. However, it all went to complete shit as soon as the beast squeezed her way through the door. She'd been gaining weight steadily through her obsession with me, and I'd say she'd definitely gained a stone or two in the 3 or 4 months, and resembled a constipated seal even more now. Once again, she had gone down the 'slutty' clothes road, with a skimpy black dress that made her look like a pork leg that hadn't had it's string taken off yet, and her belly was genuinely overhanging. Her make up looked like it had been applied by a seven year old, and all seemed to disappear into crevices in her face. Her seven chins were a different colour to her face due to her unfortunate use of foundation.

'LordCreamCheese, your plus one is here mate!' said the friend of my best friend. The general look on the populous of the party was [this](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=wtf+face&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45175338,d.d2k&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=uDNoUZ2yE8mN0wX8o4DwBg#imgrc=ZtD4HZfBcyp7JM%3A%3BsNt81MXEkuGaKM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fphraseturner.files.wordpress.com%252F2011%252F04%252Frachels-wtf-face.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fphraseturner.wordpress.com%252F2011%252F04%252F05%252Fgleewind-2-03-grilled-cheesus%252F%3B816%3B768) as she waddled her way into the dancefloor, throwing an empty wine bottle and her purse on the floor as she quaked through the hallway and into the party. It was deadly quiet except from the WEEPING of my girlfriend- yes she was so sick of the stalking that it actually made her cry.
Next part coming soon- bitch smackdowns!

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Part 5- proof whales shouldn't drink.

The fudgehoarder is well and truly plastered, tripping over people's feet, giggling inanely and fiddling with her bra every 2 or 3 seconds. She sidles up to me and says 'Hiiiii HONEY!' and starts giggling and feeling my butt. My girlfriend is freaking out and has gone upstairs with a friend, leaving me on my own to deal with this flabby equivalent of relationship nuclear waste. 

A brief summary of the conversation- if you couldn't tell, I finally fucking flipped. 

&gt;What the FUCKING FUCK are you doing here, you shit faced BADGER CUNT?

&gt;Honey, I pretended to *hic* be your *hic* plus one so we could be together

&gt;NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE WITH YOUR FLABBERY, BAD BREATH, ANNOYING HABITS, CLEAR ALCOHOLISM, LONELINESS AND FUCKING CUNTERY. YOU'VE MADE MY GIRLFRIEND CRY

&gt;That bitch? *hic* *giggles* What a joke, let's go upstairs!

She grabs my hand again and tries to pull me upstairs, falling over and pulling me down. 

Coming up- the final resolution with extra POLICE INTERVENTION :D

______________________________________________________________________________________________

The FINALE (or why whales who don't think they're whales need to sit the fuck down)

So, she's pulled me down and now I'm seriously, seriously angry. This self-loathing lardy beast has been basically trying to ruin my life in the name of her own selfish interests for 3-4 months. She's lying there giggling, her sausagey fingers running their way up and down my jumper, probably leaving snail trails of grease and forlorn flab that are irremovable on it. And then, after all of this shit, she puts her arms around my neck, the rolls pushing against my delicate neck flesh, and tries to pull me in for a kiss after snidely remarking 'I've got you just where I want you'. I recoil from the flabby, fishy lips, the stench of pizza and cheap wine, her piggy eyes screwed shut as she tries to steal a first kiss. Then my girlfriend storms in, yells 'THAT'S MY MAN' and kicks the bitch in the head with her high heels, allowing me to break away. I'm glad she snapped after 3 or 4 months of this shit, we had tried to be very accomodating but this was just the end. The house walrus starts bawling her eyes out, and for the first time I felt a tiny twinge of sympathy for her, but then she screams 'IT'S JUST BECAUSE I'M FAT ISN'T IT. I'VE GOT A FUCKING THYROID PROBLEM (when her parents had to get involved, I asked. She doesn't.)' and we are forced, with many expletives, to explain that it's because she has been stalking me and trying to break my relationship apart. Everyone wants to beat the crap into her to teach her a lesson, but once we calm down we decide to call the police because frankly we are done with her bullshit and it constitutes stalking. The general consensus is also that she is in need of therapy to help her. 

So we've completely drama-stomped this guys party, and I feel pretty bad for it. The music has stopped and everyone is just awkwardly standing around whilst we have a shouting match with a psychotic fat bitch. The cops turn up about half an hour after. For once fatso isn't a deluded bitch and tells the police the entire truth, and admits she needs help because 'when I get sad, the thought of LordCreamCheese and food are the only thing that get me through...I'd have killed myself otherwise'. The police takes statements from everyone at the party, and take her away. 

That is pretty much the end of the story, but because I'm a monster, I'll leave the epilogue for a while, I'll tie all the knots together then. Frankly there's a whole lot of other crazy that she did, a lot of that is entertainingly also to do with her body, so I might add some other stuff later. Bitches be crazy. But after that, I was no longer staked by a fat psycho. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

TL;DR Got stalked by a crazy fat girl, showing many fat people stereotypes on the way. She tried to break up my girlfriend and I, and eventually went full crazy. Now go and read the rest, you fat fuck. "	t5_2vzax	True
1375294707.0	1jfq7z	Water is bad for you! My teacher told me so!	Ihaveavaginasothere	620	91	116	"Stopped at the dollar store yesterday to grab some laundry soap. One of the cashiers from the store who must have been on break was in line behind me with some sugar-laden energy/ sports drink. She was a small moon of a woman, testing the seams of her uniform polo shirt. As I was checking out, her and the cashier who was working had this conversation:

Cashier: ""Why do you drink that stuff all the time? Does it actually give you energy?""

Moon: ""Nope, just keeps me hydrated!""

Cashier: ""You know, water will do that too.""

Moon: ""I DON'T DRINK PLAIN WATER THAT STUFF IS NASTY MY EARTH SCIENCE TEACHER TOLD ME THAT ALL WATER IS RECYCLED AND THEY USE FILTERED WATER TO MAKE BOTTLED WATER SO IT HAS FECES IN IT AND YOU COULD GET SICK, THIS IS MUCH HEALTHIER!!!""

Cashier (stunned): ""What do you think they use to make your energy drink? How about the water you shower in?""

I was walking out the door at this point so I'm not sure how the rest went, but I walked out with 2 thoughts:

1 - Holy shit, someone tried to teach you about the water cycle and your takeaway from it was ""drink energy drinks, not water"". 

2 - That cashier just gave that moon a reason not to shower. I hope she knows what she did.

1369532509.0	1f267s	Porkplanet Housemate: Chapter One, Pt1: The Night Out	imgonnamakeit	748	218	132	"LONG STORY, you've been warned.

&gt; Be Me, 5""10, over 120lb overweight (8.5 stone / 54g 'cause Britfag) because I'm a lazy cow and have been all my life.

&gt; I have lived for 24 winters.

&gt; Dawned on me late last year I needed to lose weight

&gt; The fat logic is strong in me

&gt; Find out boyfriend of 4 years at the time has been looking at porn of 18 year old skinny girls in catholic school girl outfits (his actual search query was that) 

&gt;  Also find out he's been sexting a yoga instructor he met at the gym

&gt; Confront him about it 

&gt; Get into a huge argument

&gt; Says he isn't attracted to me anymore

&gt; ouch.rage and part of me was ishouldntbesosurprised.jpeg 

&gt; Dump him on Halloween 

&gt; thatwasverybrave.exe

&gt;  I'm gonna lose weight, for real this time. 


Side note, it's the end of May now I have dropped nearly 40kg (88lb). Weight loss to begin with was really tough because I found out quickly that the only way I was going to do it, was not just through dieting, but going to the gym. I don't know if any of you recovering Hamplanets are former smokers, but I am (I still occasionally smoke when I drink) but being overweight and smoking is deadly, and makes for an even worse recovery when you finally decide to change your lifestyle. All through November and December when I finally started hitting the gym, every session was TOUGH. I was out of breath within minutes and it was only till Christmas I started getting into the swing of things. The weight is flowing off my now like melted cheese. 

So here is the real story. 

&gt; Be living at University with course mates (and friends) 

&gt; There are six of us. Three I'll only introduce because they are significant. The first two are KK (5""2, 125lb, total gym nerd) and AS (5""6, 130lb, healthy food nerd)

&gt; Then there is Porkplanet. 5""8 and about 300lb. Was once my best friend in the house at one point, but we have slowly drifted apart. Regardless, we love her, just not some of her bitchy qualities. Have tried over and over to move her away from supernova status, but the fat logic is strong in this one. She dates online and has a fetish for pulling bony nerdy betas. Thinks she's gods gift to men. 

&gt; It is Christmas. We say our goodbyes. We are off school for a month. Promise AS and KK that I will continue gym and dieting over Christmas with brother, and will meet periodically with AS as we come from the same county and we'll go swimming. We even did a Christmas Day swim (in the freezing cold OCEAN!) on Christmas Morning. The start of a beautiful tradition for us both that we will continue next year. Plus, made me hella hungry for food on Christmas day.  

&gt; Before we left for Christmas, Porkplanet makes snarky comment in the living room about how ""imgonnamakeit will totally gain the lost weight over Christmas, she loves food just like me""

&gt; Whatever bitch, I'll show you.

&gt; Lose 3kg over the Christmas period (6lb) - success! And I managed not to miss out on all the lovely food (in moderation). Since I started working out and dieting early November, I had lost nearly 30lb up to Christmas. Still a mini-moon but looking good and HEALTHY, and arms are toning up. Have a spring in my step. Determined and disciplined. 

&gt; Coming back from home to University, mid-January.

&gt; Feeling good, looking good, dropping weight.

&gt; everythingisgoingbetterthaniexpected.png

&gt; Arrive back at my house. AS, KK and other housemates are there. Porkplanet not arrived yet.

&gt; Feeling self conscious because they are showering me with compliments, ""oh imgonnamakeit, I can't believe how good you look"" and ""I can't believe you managed to lose weight over Christmas"" and AS is gushing and telling the rest of the girls how she couldn't even keep up with me when we went swimming a handful of times over Christmas. 

&gt; Not used to this, feels weird, but I'm so happy. 

&gt; Oddly excited to see Porkplanet, I've missed her, our friendship was tense before the break because she found it hard to adapt that I spent my evenings at the gym, and not on the couch with her eating food. Usually a break does us all good. 

&gt; Door shuts. 

&gt; Omg it's Porkplanet! We've missed her so much. 

&gt; And suddenly, the walls are shaking. 

&gt; Tiles are falling off the roof of our house and falling to the ground outside our living room window. 

&gt; Floor boards in hallway are screaming in agony instead of creaking. 

&gt; Porkplanet bursts into living room. About 20lb bigger than before she left in December. Everyone rejoices anyway.

&gt; She goes straight for KK and AS with hugs, and other housemates, not before giving me a look of utter disbelief. Finally hugs me. 

&gt; AS: ""Porkplanet, how good does imgonnamakeit look?, we're in shock!""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Yeah real cool. I'm starving I'm gonna make food"". 

&gt; Okay whatever, she text us beforehand to say she was gonna be late coming home because she was stopping at McDicks. It's 10pm at night and we're heading to bed because KK and I are heading to the gym in the morning before we all go to the library to revise for upcoming exams. I wasn't expecting compliments at all, but I was hoping she'd come back from break in better spirits and over her obvious issues with me. I was wrong. 

&gt; 11.30pm that night, knock on the door. It's AS. I'm still awake. She runs in, jumps on my bed. 

&gt; Shows me whatsapp messages her and Porkplanet have been sending back and forth to one another for the last hour from both of their bedrooms. 

&gt; I scroll. One message says ""It looks like imgonnamakeit hasn't really lost any weight over Christmas, I knew she'd lapse. Soon she'll stop going to the gym. She just can't handle the diet, she loves food too much"". 

&gt; youfuckingbitchwhyareyoubeinlikethis.rage

&gt; Quietly ignore her for the rest of the week. Easy to do since we spent 8 hours a day in the library completing essays and revising for exams. The rest of the time we are at the gym or pool while porkplanet is at home baking brownies and eating pizza every night.

&gt; Be Friday the following week. We're in the library trying to finish our essay. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Screw this let's go shopping and go out tonight clubbing"". 

&gt; We're all on board. We finished our exams and we can finish this essay on Sunday and Monday, since it's due Tuesday. Let's have Friday and Saturday off. 

What I didn't expect next was actually the perfect day. We all went out shopping, ate food out (I had a delicious chicken cesar salad, Porkplanet had a large pizza to herself) and acted all like friends again. I went to a store that does normal and plus size clothes, and still being plus size bought a skater dress (in red), some new shoes and a leather jacket to wear out. The only difference this time shopping for plus size clothes was that I was two sizes smaller! I'm feeling good, looking good. Myself, KK, AS and other housemate leave the mall early as we are all going to go swimming for an hour before we get ready and go out tonight. Porkplanet, and other housemate remain at the mall. We didn't see them again until that night and oh boy. 

&gt;  Be 8pm. Finally home from swimming. Get hair done, makeup on, dress on, feeling sexy. 9pm. Land-speed record for getting ready for a girl. But I want to party 'cause I'm feeling good and happy and free for once in my entire sorry existence. 

&gt; Approaching Kitchen. Can hear lots of voices. We told Porkplanet to text around and invite our friends. Guess a few people came. 

&gt; Enter kitchen. Cheers. Yay my friends are here! Everyone is like ""oh my god you look amazing"" feeling incredibly shy and nervous but at the same time fuckit.jpeg 'cause I feel good tonight even if I still am a mini-moon. 

&gt; Giving kisses and hugs. Catching up with people properly. 

&gt; Turn a corner in our kitchen and see my ex boyfrend. Not sure why he is here but he's with his friend who is a mutual friend of ours, and on our course. whythefuckareyouhere.rage 

&gt; Ex: ""Porkplanet invited me and friend. Didn't think it would be an issue"". 

&gt; Me: ""Wow that was rude of her. But fine no point you going anywhere now."" 

&gt; For the next hour, ex boyfriend is giving me the eye while I make my way around the room chatting and entertaining. He finally pulls me aside. 

&gt; Ex: ""You look good. I'm really pleased for you"". Touched my neck and thinks it's gonna drive me nuts because it usually used to. For some reason, it repulsed me. 

&gt; Feel like crying. Suddenly my confidence is slipping. AS and KK can read my face across the room. 

&gt; Pull me away. Give me a drink. Boost me up. I look amazing and ex boyfriend isn't going to make me feel all the feels again. Not this day. Not tonight. 

&gt; Moment of realization. Where's porkplanet? We're all stumped. She must still be getting ready in her room. 

&gt; Before we finish speculating. Kitchen is shaking. Pans are chattering in the cupboards. Ice is popping out of ice trays. Lights fixtures are swinging side to side. 

&gt; Porkplanet bursts through door. 

&gt; [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/Dk1AL4a.gif) she bought the same dress as me (but in blue) 

&gt; [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/zT5xujY.jpg) she bought the same jacket as me

&gt; [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/7m5DhGo.gif) she bought the same shoes as me

&gt; [Our face when](http://i.imgur.com/lJPe2at.gif) we all realize at the same time what she's done.

&gt; TO BE CONTINUED BECAUSE MY HANDS HURTS.

**TLDR; My ex boyfriend is a prick, shames me into realizing I'm an unattractive whale. Dump him. Lose lots of weight being a gym-bitch and eating healthy. Porkplanet housemate cannot deal. Hilarity ensues.**

I'll probably write up the next part either tonight or tomorrow morning depending on if my hand stops hurting (broke two of my fingers, another Porkplanet-related story coming soon in another chapter)."	t5_2vzax	True

Ok so this story will be really short and won't really contain any fatlogic but it does contain crazy. I understand if the mods want to remove it, but I would ask them not to because it would be very relevant if there are any more to come. Which come one guys seriously, when you read this who wont think there will be more?

So yesterday Jessicas parents came over and said they were taking the matter to the police and asked me to come along and give my side of the story, I agreed and off we went. We talked to the police gave our stories, and they said they couldn't do much since it's a he said she said right now and they weren't sure if talking to her would make it better as it might make her escalate. But Jessicas parents insisted on it and the police told them they would do it later today.

The day passes and morning is here, I got a love letter that said that we will be together and nothing will get in our way when Jessica is out of the picture and we can freely admit our love for each other. After I showed this letter to my parents I went over to Jessicas house before her parents left for work to show them, apparently some one took a shit in their pool last night. I wonder who it could be?

They were kind enough to drive me to the police taking Jessica with us, (as seriously who would want to leave their daughter home alone when some psycho basically made death threats to her in a letter to a neighbor boy?) as someone took a shit in their pool after they made a report about someone and the police would talk to them that day. I told them about the letter and how I don't want this. They said it was good I brought it and reported it as it could be used as evidence proving otherwise if she were to claim sexual harassment or assault against me, or if she were to claim something against Jessica.

Jessicas parents drop me and Jessica off at the entry to our street and drive off to work, guess who's at a certain window waiting blowing kisses and waving and fucking winking again? When she noticed Jessica walking with me The Manatee got a strange look on her face, like there was a famine going on and she couldn't eat as much as she wanted or like someone stole all her food and ate it in front of her and ridiculed her for not having enough curves. It made Jessica scared and asked me to stay with her until her parents came home."	t5_2vzax	True

Alright my sugar coated friends, after nearly 50 messages the past few days I guess you NEED your jimmies rustled so bad that I can’t object. This story may be shorter than the others, I feel like crap. Ya know, low blood sugar. Okay, when we left off slowbro was being super beta, and jigglybitch tried to suck Ash, my boyfriend into her rolls. That was the jist of nearly every encounter, until this one. 

Alright, a little more background. Remember the Honda? The poor car put through the torture of carrying jigglybitch and slowbro around? Well, it was Ash’s old car. He was selling it to Slowbro, who was supposed to be making payments. Fast forward, it had been 5 or 6 months, and they had yet to make a payment.  We found out they has also not changed the registration on the car, and had even wrecked it. Ash was pissed. Ash had been trying to be nice, and give them the benefit of the doubt, until he saw the damage.

&gt;Driving around town, killing time until we had to leave for the movie. Decide to stop at Walmart, because there was literally nothing to do. 

&gt;Ash sees a Honda that looks suspiciously like his.. 

&gt;Oh look, it still has his plate on it. 

&gt;HFW [he sees this] (http://imgur.com/QuM6qda)

&gt; “Call your brother.”

&gt; I use Ashes phone, Jigglybitch answers, “Oh HAI ASH! teehee WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? DID YOU MISS ME?”

&gt; Not Ash. Her tone changes.

&gt; “WHAT DO YOU WANT.”

&gt; “Where are you guys? Ash wants to talk to you about the car” I ask, as sweetly as possible.

&gt; pause… “WE'RE UH, IN NEXTTOWNOVER, WE WONT BE BACK TIL LATE TONIGHT”

&gt; “Oh, okay, no problem. So, what did you need at Walmart?”

&gt; “OH WE'RE JUST PICKING UP SOME GROCERIES.. OH FUCK.” (hangs up)

&gt; I call back, Slowbro answers “Why do you have Ash’s phone?”

&gt; “He asked me to call you. He wants to talk about the car.”

&gt; “Well, you obviously know where we are, tell him to come in and talk to us.”

&gt; Whatever. I went in with him, because I wanted him to survive this encounter with the fatrolls, plus he hates confrontation and I am a bitch. 

&gt; Enter walmart, they’re not where they said they were. Circle around, they’re nowhere to be found. 

&gt; That bastard. I knew he had bolted. 

&gt; Cars gone. 

&gt; Oh well, we know where they live. 

&gt; We were nearly to their trailer when we saw them leaving, we let them pass us (back roads in the foothills, we kinda had to) and 
follow. 

&gt; Jigglybitch calls Ash, I answer. Partially because he was driving, and partially because I hate her. 

&gt; “teehee ASH, CAN’T WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER? I HAVE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR LATER, BECAUSE MY CONDISHUN AND WE 
NEED THE CAR! 

&gt; Not Ash, tone changes. “WHY CAN’T YOU JUST LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE? ASH GAVE US THIS CAR NOW HE’S ONLY TAKING IT BACK BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM TO YOU STUPID BITCH. YOU ONLY WANT THE CAR FOR YOURSELF SO YOU CAN GO AROUND AND BANG EVERYONE LIKE I KNOW YOU DO. I KNOW A HUNDRED GUYS WHO SAID THEY FUCKED YOU… blah blah blah” I stopped listening. 

For the record, I don’t even KNOW a hundred guys. Not denying I had been around a bit, but we lived in the middle of nowhere and there was nothing else to do. lol 

&gt; “Okay, Jigglybitch, name one.”

&gt; Silence. (Hangs up.)

&gt; Suddenly Ash’s phone starts blowing up with text messages. First pleading with him, then insults about me being a slut, and when 
he didn’t answer fast enough comments on his sexuality. 

&gt; Ash is getting pissed. 

&gt; We’re still following them. 

&gt; They pull up into this little trailer compound in the middle of nowhere. 
Have I mentioned that we live in the county they based “Deliverance” out of? Not even kidding.

&gt;doyouhearbanjos.jpeg

&gt;Slowbro gets out of the car, and stands next to it. Beckons for Ash to come talk.

&gt;Jigglybitch bursts out of the car with speed I have never seen her reach. One arm full of fatcakes, the other busy stuffing them 
into her mouth. 

&gt;She approaches the most run down trailer and starts hollering for her paw paw. 

&gt; Ash is hesitant to get out of the car.

&gt; Paw paw comes out, he is about 6 inches shorter than Jigglebitch, and even more round. 

&gt; Jigglybitch starts this big drawn out story about how we’re stealing her car, and I’ve been out to get her. 

&gt; Moves with such emphasis that the cellulite in her cankles is jiggling with her. 

&gt; I push Ash to get out of the car, he goes and talks to Slowbro. 

&gt;Paw paw goes over to investigate. 

&gt;Jigglybitch, now feeling secure knowing Paw paw would protect her, starts running her mouth about me. While continuing to stuff her face, which is quite a feat.. she could be a skilled ventriloquist. 

&gt; I’m a slut, yeah okay. I’m jealous of her curves, haha of course. I’m both anorexic, and fat.. whatever.

&gt; Then she brought up something so low, even I was surprised she would be that awful. 

&gt; YOU ONLY STAY WITH ASH BECAUSE HE’S THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL TAKE YOU AFTER doesntevendeserveanickname USED YOU 
UP. 

Just over a year prior, I had been raped. Because this was a ridiculously small town, everyone knew about it. Even her, apparently. 

&gt;That’s it, I’m so done. 

&gt; Jigglybitch, you have no fucking idea what you are talking about. You are fucking disgusting. All you do is eat, throw yourself at 
unsuspecting guys, and insult people. Slowbro only stays with you so he doesn’t have to get a damn job. If you have any brain cells left that weren’t choked to death by fat, you would shut the hell up because I have wanted to kick your ass for a LONG time now. 

&gt;Jigglybitch calls for paw paw with a smug look on her face. Once again makes some comment about doesntevendeserveanickname.

&gt; I’m out of the car, less than a foot between us. She tells me I need to back off, Paw paw has a gun and he will go get it. 

&gt; I quickly estimate that I have at least 10 minutes; the trailer has 3 or 4 stairs. 

&gt; She takes that as me backing down and starts laughing. 

&gt; I punch her directly in the face. She stumbles backwards and lands on her giant ass. 

&gt; ohshit.thatfeltgood. 

&gt; She starts crying for her paw paw, and talking about her condition, and low blub sugar, and I only hated her because she was bigger than me. 

&gt; She flops around a bit, and starts to get up. 

&gt; I punch her again, for good measure. 

&gt; I hear Ash yell my name, and see him and Slowbro jump in to their cars. (well, Ash’s cars)

&gt; oh shit, paw paw went for his gun. 

&gt; I sprint back to the car, jump in, and keep my head down as Ash throws his car in reverse and speeds the fuck out of there. 

&gt; Ash – “I can’t believe you finally hit her.”

&gt; Feelsgoodbro.jpeg

In a moment of clarity, I called the police, and reported Ash’s car as stolen. Since it was still in his name, and still had his plates on it. I figured it wouldn’t be long until Jigglybitch realized I assaulted her, and that she would call the cops too. What she didn’t realize was that I was friends with nearly every cop in the town. I worked for two restaurants, and gave them free food all the time. Most of them were hamplanets themselves, and the quickest way to their hearts was with free greasy beetus inducing burgers. 

Both Slowbro and Jigglybitch were arrested. Slowbros charges were dropped, because Ash got his car back and made a deal with him. Jigglybitch however apparently already had a warrant out for her arrest. Guess that’s why she didn’t report my assault. Last I heard she had a minimum of 2 years in county jail. 


The end.

P.S. No, SB and JB are no longer together. I don't really know the details of the break up, because soon after this I moved to another state. From what I gathered, mixed with a few assumptions, once Jigglybitch was sentenced Slowbro went off to find someone else to mooch off of. I don't know anything else about what happened to Jigglybitch. It's a few years later now, and my brother is engaged, and still unemployed. "	t5_2vzax	True

...so I'm taking the liberty of copy pastaing because you all have  conditions and need more stories:

Baked goods. Everyone loves baked goods. My sister, she probably loves them more then anyone. So on the day she was down and depressed after breaking up with her boyfriend, my brother and I swore to bring her cheer with a delicious chocolate cake.

We venture out the front door and hop into his Jeep and set on down the road to the local grocer. We arrive and as we are looking to park this women, who we will call the Blob, cuts us off and steals the parking spot we were waiting for. We shrugged it off as we are pretty relaxed fellows and parked in another spot. We make way into the grocery store, head directly to the baked goods counter, and wait in line to be served. The Blob pulls up behind us chattering away obnoxiously on her cell phone and completely oblivious to what was around her. 

Our turn to be served comes up, we select the last remaining chocolate cake, and ask the baker to out a message on our cake. She said it would take about ten minutes, as there was a line, and we told her we would be back to pick up our order. As we were walking away The Blob asks for a chocolate cake and is told there is none left and that we got the last one. She begins freaking out in a very entitled tone and demands that she receive said cake since we cut her off in the bakery line. However, the baker assures her we were here first and she would have to pick a different cake. At this point we could no longer hear what was happening but we didnt care as the Blob stole our parking spot, and got her just desserts as we took the last chocolate cake. However, our dealing with the Blob were far from over.

We headed to the frozen aisle to grab some pizza pockets, fries, chicken fingers, and other delectable snack foods as we were pretty starved. We headed back to the bakery counter only to find a different person behind the counter. We ask her for our cake and are told our sister picked it up. She then points down the bread aisle to the Blob with our cake in her motherfucking cart. Now most people would walk away and let this bitch eat her cake, but we were not backing down.


We followed her for some time through the grocery store. We decided to wait for an opportune moment and steal our cake back. The second she turned to grab something from the dairy fridge we gallopped over, grabbed the cake and ran headlong to the checkout. Looking back we saw she was distracted on her phone again and did not notice the cake was missing. We paid for our groceries and headed out to the truck.

As we were leaving we realized that maybe we could get a little extra revenge on her. So we wrote up a note, indicating how delicious the cake was, and that she should thank us for saving her the calories. We tucked this under the wiper of her car and drove off just as she was walking out. Her face was red and puffed with air, we could tell she was angry as hell that we got our cake back.

TL:DR FAT BLOB STEALS CAKE, WE STEAL IT BACK

1372535181.0	1hbq8u	Tales of hamplanetry and fatlogic through the eyes of a cardiologist (I)	iidank	660	135	34	"Finally got around to ask my mom about her encounters with whales and other indistinguishable rolls of lard throughout her career in medicine. There are too many stories so I shall try to post the better ones up here. 

Forgive me for not green texting but I don't want to fuck shit up and then spend an hour fixing it...teehee?

Please strap in your jimmies and your thyroids as we're expecting turbulence 

Story 1: The world is my oyster and some bastard ate it all

This story begins right after med school where my mom (5'6-167cm, 120lbs-54kg-8.5stone) just got out of med school, hopeful and so eager to help other people and make their lives better.

Now my mom is a very cheerful person back then so she did everything to make other people happy, so she sat down with patients and tried to know more about them. One of those patients was Lardzilla (5'9-175 and  450lbs/204kg/32 stone) Lardzilla was very grumpy because all the interns would look in awe at his massive frame and wonder how does a human heart support a beast like himself. One fateful day my mom had to refill lardzilla's prescription for his cundishion, OH GLORIOUS BEETUS. 

Seeing this as her only time to eat during her shift, she grabbed a sandwich from the cafeteria and brought both to lardzilla. Upon setting his gaze upon the luscious sandwich lardzilla instantly became hungry (no shit) and wanted my mom to get him one as well. Kepp in mind that he ate just 20 fucking minutes ago! so my mom tells him no as he already had it.

Being gullible little being that she was, she left it on the sidetable along with his prescription to check on his chart. 

Temperature - Check
Vitals - Check
Sandwich - What the fu...

Now my mom is very confrontational as she doesn't allow people to step over, in this case roll over her so she told lardzilla to ""DROP THE FUCKING SANDWICH, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO IT"" 

whoathere.jpeg

Lardzilla having being in these situations before tells my mom ""You don't need it, you're getting way too chubby""

tryingtofindface.exe....facenotfound

She had tried her best to cope with people calling her fat before (former chubbs but took tennis to lose all that fat) so she ran outside to cry while lardzilla devoured her sandwich (it was an egg salad sandwich for those who where wondering)

TL;DR Lardzilla steals sandwich from an intern and makes her cry by telling her to loose weight

1370045265.0	1ffqxf	Hamarella vs. Big Momma	Anemoi523	630	104	58	"Obligatory first post.  First, some backstory

I've recently started a new construction job.  Long hours but the pay's worth it.  The site I'm at right now is next door to a Starbucks.  (What isn't these days).  One of the barristas there is a middle-aged black woman.  She's a little on the chunky side, but nowhere near fatlogic.  

One day when we went in there, my co-worker who will be reffered to as CableBro, starts asking for "" 'em Dunkin Donuts prices.""  He gets into a fake argument with her and accidentally calls her Big Momma.  She pretends to throw a fit, demanding to know if she called her that ""Because of my skin, or because of my weight.""  At the end, she thanked him for being a good sport and said to come back at any time.  

Now for the story.  

&gt;Be me, with CableBro and Foreman going in for a post-lunch coffee.  

&gt;Not actually get coffee, because I don't do that shit.  Buy water instead.  

&gt;Watch Big Momma and CableBro get into their usual argument.  Entertaining as fuck.  

&gt;Notice water rippling in bottle.  

&gt;Check my flank, cuz that's how they got that guy in Jurassic Park.  

&gt;Watch as front door begins to fold in on itself.  

&gt;Witness Hamarella squeeze in through the door.  She was probably somewhere around 400 lbs.  Fat rolls down her ankles, thick sleeves of cellulose around her forearms, and at least three chins on her face.  

&gt;Watch as Hamarella stomps her way to the counter.  

&gt;Considering jumping on young children to shield them from falling ceiling tiles.  

&gt;Hamarella stomps up to CableBro, who was currently making friendly digs at Big Momma

""Ex-CUSE ME!  Check your privilege.  Do you know you're being racist right now?  Being fat is a way of life.  You're no better than the nazis.  They killed people for the way they looked.  So why don't you shut the fuck up you steroid-munching ass.""

&gt;Watch CableBro attempt to calculate just what Hamarella told him.  

&gt;Be me, realizing that Hamarella thought CableBro was LEGIT 'fatshaming' Big Momma.  

&gt;Witness the greatest comeback of all time.  

""Why don't you excuse yo'self Ms.  Jabba the Hutt.  I'd tell you to get off yo' hi-horse, but you prolly ate it already.  If you wuzn't so dayum busy stuffin' yo' face, you'da seen me and this boy here were playin' around.""

&gt;Big Momma steps from behind the counter.  

""And you need to shut yo' goddamn mouth about that racism bullshit.  You don't know racism 'till you been sprayed wit' a firehose just fo' sittin on the wrong bus seat.  No one here woulda said a THING about yo' weight.  You just had to open that giant hole in yo' head and pretend to be important.""

&gt;Entire store is shocked silent as Hamarella turns around and shuffles out the door.  

It turns out that Hamarella's a practitioner of HAES, (Healthy At Every Size) and has been trying to turn that particular Starbucks into her own personal soap box.  Big Momma admits she's been looking for an opening to shut her down for weeks.  

&gt;Score free cookie for witnessing the shutout of the year. 

EDIT:  It was Size, not Weight as my commenters pointed out"	t5_2vzax	True

So after sitting around for two hours stuffing her face (this is about 4 hours through 6 hour shift, mind), my manager finally gets fed up with her and tells her to get back to actually training me instead of eating.

For the record, I was doing fine without her, some things just can't be done without another person, be it a manager or another supervisor.

&gt; Grumpy Retail Whale returns from a glorious feeding

&gt; Stands at the desk as I assist customers for about five minutes

&gt; RW: ""Hey, would you mind of I go ahead and take my break?""

&gt; Blank stare

&gt; ""Didn't you just get back from sitting around for two hours eating?""

&gt; RW: ""I was working on the schedule! I have to regulate my blood sugar so if I don't have something to eat every 15 minutes I could pass out!""

&gt; Guess that explains why she's so fucking large

&gt; Sigh, resigned to my fate

&gt; ""Would you mind if I take my break first? I haven't had a chance to sit down all shift.""

&gt; RW: ""I NEED to take my break NOW. The Italian restaurant across the street closes in fifteen minutes and I need to go pick up my order!""

&gt; FUCKING REALLY?

&gt; Yarly

&gt; ""Whatever, go ahead. I'd like to take mine when you get back, though.""

&gt; RW: ""Oh no problem! I'll be quick!""

&gt; As quick as a 450 lbs woman (205 kg or 32 stone) can be

&gt; That's not very fast if you were wondering

&gt; Thirty minutes later!

&gt; RW returns with a large pizza box, and three styrofoam containers of mystery Italian food.

&gt; RW sits down to gorge again!

&gt; ""RW, it's been thirty minutes. Breaks are only fifteen and I still need to take mine.""

&gt; RW: ""Oh, I know! Just let me finish my food and you can go!""

&gt; Half the pizza is already gone. Eaten on the walk back to keep up dat energy

&gt; Second half consumed in 5 minutes

&gt; First mystery container - Large calzone with extra meat sauce! ~ 5 minutes

&gt; Second mystery container - Chili cheese fries ~ 3 minutes

&gt; Third mystery container - FUCKING CHEESEBURGER ~ 3 minutes

Quick aside, these burgers are fucking MASSIVE. I eat lunch out maybe once every three months and treated myself to a burger and onion rings and felt that I had eaten so much I would vomit.

&gt; 16 minutes later after food has been devoured, RW returns to the desk

&gt; RW ""Okay! Remember to be back in fifteen minutes!""

&gt; ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

&gt; Totally fucking serious.

I'm a smoker (please don't hurt me). I'm fully aware that it's a bad habit, I generally only smoke at work which is at most one cigarette a day, so I don't feel too terrible about it. The nicotine really helps in stressful situations and this fat ass motherfucker is most definitely stressing me out at this point.

&gt; Head outside, smokin' mah smoke

&gt; About 7 minutes

&gt; Text boyfriend explaining the fucking HORRORS of this woman

&gt; He's all lolz sucks to be you, at least you have a job

&gt; True enough, sigh, head back inside

&gt; As soon as I walk through the door, RW starts singing

&gt; RW: ""Are you back yet? I neeeeeeeeeeed to go to the bathroom!""

&gt; ""I have five more minutes. Can you wait?""

&gt; RW: ""Nooooooooo! I need to go NOW!""

In retrospect I should've let the bitch soil herself. It really wouldn't be anymore embarrassing than her normal appearance.

&gt; Whatevs, go take a shit or whatever whales do in the bathroom

&gt; THIRTY MINUTES LATER she shows back up

&gt; Starts harping on me because I had a cigarette

&gt; RW: ""Smoking is soooooooo bad for you. I don't know how you can do that to yourself! That's probably why you're so skinny, because you don't eat, you just smoke cigarettes instead!""

&gt; Commence launch count down. T minus 3, 2, 1

&gt; ""Look - first off, I'm overweight for my height, so I definitely eat enough food. For two, I ONLY smoke at work because it helps me deal with stress. Third, after the heart attack of a meal plus snacks that you've had over the course of a six hour shift, you have NO room to lecture me about anything related to health.""

While I do have a short temper, I generally try to AVOID DRAMA. But I refuse to stand around and let some fat cow lecture me about my life when she just fucking met me 5 and a half hours earlier that day.

&gt; RW: ""But you're so skinny! You're not overweight! How much do you weigh?!""

&gt; No shame. ""170. At 5'4, that's overweight. I am trying to LOSE weight.""

&gt; RW: ""Oh that's tiny. Guess how much I weigh!""

&gt; In the back of my head Admiral Ackbar is yelling ""IT'S A TRAP!""

&gt; Best thing to do is underestimate!

&gt; Bad at guessing weight to begin with, so we'll undercut that too!

&gt; ""Oh, maybe about 250?""

&gt; Smuggest Retail Whaley smile

&gt; RW: ""Nope! I weigh 450 lbs! I just carry it really well so no one can ever tell!""

&gt; There is no my face for my face

&gt; My face at this point is trying to run away and hide because it so confused

&gt; RW luckily continues her whale song so I don't have to embarrass the shit out of myself

&gt; RW: ""I've ALWAYS been big. Some people are just built big. I don't mind it, because men like women who are soft and feminine. No self respecting man would want to be with a bag of bones!""

&gt; Can't hold it in

&gt; Gotta go for it

&gt; ""So, do you have a boyfriend then?""

&gt; RW ""Oh, no. I've never had a boyfriend. I'm saving myself for someone special. I won't be a floozy and date all these men because we all know what men want. I honestly can't believe you're living with your boyfriend before you're married. You know that's a sin.""

&gt; Mutter under my breath, ""So is gluttony.""

&gt; MAGICALLY FUCKING SAVED when the manager comes up to close for the night!

&gt; The madness is over!

&gt; I survived the day without murdering her!

&gt; Success baby all up IN THIS PIECE

And that is the end of the saga of a six hour shift with a gluttonous Retail Whale.

TL;DR: RW eats enough Italian food for a family of four, berates me for my life choices and sinning

(Goddamn, that was way longer than I expected. SORRY FOR ALL DEM WORDS.)

Players: 

Me, M/19/5'9""/220lbs
Bf, M20/6'1/175lbs

This weekend I got to spend some time with my mother and my boyfriend. Yay.

We spent the day in a small Texas tourist trap town. The bf and I find a tea shop in town. Us, being massive tea snobs decide to have a sip of hot tea in the scorching Texas summer. 

Bf ordered black ice tea flavored with plum and I ordered hot oolong tea with pomagranete. It was am^m^m^azing. Bf had almost finished his glass when an eldritch horror plodded into the shoppe. 

My best guess. F/5'6""/350ish. Soaked with sweat and had a bottle of beetus in hand. 

Luck wasn't on our side as she was seated next to us. 

We are both fairly attractive bisexual men but the sight and smell of this woman almost made us renounce women altogether. She proceeded to move her mouthflaps in our general direction. 

""What yalll two guud luukin men doin hur without any guuurls?""

Both of us ignored her and focused on our tea. 

She ordered a basic bland green hot tea. Once it arrived she took one sip and spit it out over her table. ""Dis disgustin, aint got no sugaaaa"" No duh, dumb fuck. Thats why, if you are ao inclined, they bring honey. 

But alas FPS, she had a solution. She emptied her remaining soda INTO HER TEA and drank it.

Then she ordered to see the manager. She demanded that her three dollar tea be comp'ed because it was disgusting. The older gentleman was having none of this shit and told her no.

At this point I couldn't watch anymore because I could hear that poor tea begging for death. So I grabbed bf's hand and we made for the door. But teawhale saw us and decided to voice her displeasure with our life choice. 

""Yahll two faggets get back here. I knew yall were hellbound when I sahhh yuuuu"" 

Bf comes from a fumdamentalist home and still takes stuff like that pretty bad. And he starts crying. 

The whale pipes up again ""thats right fag, cry. Yuu gotta stay with a man. Couldn't handle a woman like me""

I lost my shit ""you fucking cow"" I bellowed ""considering you probably dont have long for this world, ill make it quick. You are a slob of a human being and a bigot at that. With the way you have presented yourself today, you have no right to talk about how anyone lives their life."" 

Bf stood up and I planted a firm kiss on his lips dead infront of her and walked out. Bf and I hands locked. 

Fuck that felt good. Maybe not a pure FPS, but a person ruining tea and being a repugnant human being. 

Tl;dr. Hambitch ruins tea, makes bf cry. And I get to be alpha.

I just got back from riding in a show jumping tournament with my barn and about 6 horses. I was out there for a few days competing and checking out professional courses and meeting/riding alongside Olympic riders, so it was AMAZING… but the problem was, there were ridiculously RUDE fat women everywhere this week. I can/will talk about some of the other incidents, but this was the craziest one.

***

So I am standing outside of a warmup ring, hanging out with one of my horses. It'd been a long two days of constant showing, and I was far from done so I was taking advantage of the hour-long break to spend some time with my youngest gelding. All of a sudden, someone yells, ""Hey! YOU!"" 

I look up to see a 5'5"", 300lb wonder storming towards me with a 5'6"", 250lb girl swinging her arms wildly trying to keep up. Meekly walking beside them is Laura, one of my apprentice trainers and students. My horse sees this mass storming towards him and gets a bit antsy. He's young and very energetic, so it doesn't take much to excite him. He's also worth $35 000 so I try to keep him pretty far away from the public.

""Are you this girl's manager?"" 

""Yes, and please, keep a distance. Horse is flighty."" 

She stops, thankfully, but sneers. ""Maybe you should keep him in better control then.""

""Just preventing an incident before it happens, ma'am. What's the problem? 

""Your stupid rider called my daughter --"" she points at the girl -- ""fat! She was incredibly insulting and I want *you* to do something about it!"" 

So, Laura is a very tiny girl. She is 5'2"" and 105lbs at last weigh-in, and she has a personality that fits it. She is very quiet and friendly and just adorable all-round. She is super hard working and my favourite student by far, so this really shocked me.

I kinda just looked at her and went ""… *really*?"" 

She looked like she was going to cry and shook her head. ""I didn't, or… I didn't mean to!"" 

Mama moon freaks out immediately. ""Oh yes she did! She was making fun of my daughter and her riding and then she mocked her and called her fat! She said she'd never amount to anything and told her to give up!"" At this point the daughter is smirking at Laura, who looks absolutely crushed. I could not see her in a *million* years saying something like that, so I motion her over to talk to me at least slightly away from the planets. 

Mama moon makes to follow her, and the horse starts to back up, afraid of the arm-flailing, shouting, obnoxious, HUGE human, and I have to remind her *again* to keep a distance. She looks enraged that someone is telling her what to do, but listens. I ask Laura to tell me exactly what she said. She managed to make it through with the woman or the daughter interrupting every few words and me having to shush them and remind them I am trying to get both sides of the story. 

""She came over to the waiting area all upset about her ride. She asked me if I saw the ride and how stupid the horse was being (daughter yells ""it was the horse, you bitch!""). We started talking about training and I told her what I would fix and she just got angry and changed the subject. Asked where I worked and such. Then she just suddenly wanted to know if she could get a job here and I told her she'd probably need lessons we have a skills test and there's also fitness regulations. Then she started yelling about how I can't comment on her fitness (lady and daughter are yelling ""that's not what happened!"") and when I tried to explain my reasoning she wanted to know about the test. So I explained it and the weight limit and she got mad and said I was making it up!""

Basically, if you know horse people - this is pretty regular drama. Young horse people quite often get into nit-picky fights and act like they're better/smarter. I was a bit that way too when I was a teen, most of them smarten up when they get serious jobs. You kinda just learn to let them cry about it and try to teach them better next time. So what came out of my mouth was, ""Probably best to just not engage in an argument, right?"" 

She looks a bit sheepish and replies, ""right."" 

I confront the mother. ""Now, you should probably clear off. I don't think you need to be bringing me the product of a cat fight between two teenagers. They're big girls, they can figure out little problems themselves. I also would appreciate if you would refrain from insulting my riders."" 

""That's it? That's all you're going to do?! She should be pulled from competition! I don't want her anywhere near my daughter!"" 

""I am not going to pull her from competition for engaging in a conversation with someone."" 

""I guess I shouldn't expect any less from the bitch who runs a farm that's so stuck up you hire people based on *looks*. You all ought to be ashamed."" 

""That's a bit unfair. We operate at a very high level of competition, so our riders need to be fit enough to handle it."" 

""Oh, yeah, because you have to be skinny to be fit. My daughter competes just *fine* and look at her! She is healthy as can be, looks like *your* riders starve themselves to meet your stupid standards."" Note: our standards are 95lbs *heavier* than Laura's weight. She is just a tiny person, but super fit. 

I spend so much time in this sub, I almost started laughing right then and there because I can't believe it's coming out of her mouth. However, I am a professional, therefore I have to not make an ass of myself. ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" 

""I bet she can out-ride any of you. "" 

""That's nice.""

""Bitch!"" And with that, she walked away, dragging her daughter along. 

Random side note, I asked Laura about her actual riding after I cheered her up and got her laughing about the situation (poor girl takes everything so seriously) and she said she came out of an 11-fence course with 20 jumping faults (knocked 5 fences down - she didn't even MAKE IT OVER HALF OF THE FENCES!) and 3 time faults (10-12 seconds over the time allowed…). Yeah man, she can out ride everyone.  Anyways. 

So later that day, same horse I was chilling with, riding in a big competition (1.45meter/4'10"" fences). Super intense, young horse, it's his first big competition at that height so I'm being very careful with him because he has a history of refusing when he gets too nervous (stopping dead right before a fence, often sending the rider over his head). All is going well, we're riding along the fence where the spectators are, have a 3-jump combination… 

Suddenly RIGHT before the third fence, someone screams, ""STUPID BITCH!"" Horse panics, tries to stop, I had to give him a smack with my whip just so he wouldn't stop in the middle of the combo. Which I felt bad for because this one wasn't his fault. Finished up, not too bad for his first class at that height. I was happy with it. 

Ride out of the ring to see the woman sitting there with her smirking daughter. ""STUPID BODY-SHAMING BITCH! CAN'T RIDE WORTH SHIT!"" 

… fucking people. I just ignored her and dismounted/gave the horse to my groom who suddenly pointed back to the ring and burst out laughing uncontrollably. 

Security confronted her for shouting, she was freaking out at them. We stood there and watched as they entered a yelling match, stalling the next rider, and the lady started shoving at the security guards. So they cuffed her and forced her off the grounds while her daughter screamed and whaled about how unfair everything was. 

I was so happy. 

The end.

1370574688.0	1fu7oa	'Disabled' guy vs. disabled guy at a theme park	ledhead423	607	84	94	"I work at a major theme park. The first job I had there was nighttime crowd control. Most insane job ever, but one story really stands out.

So it's a normal night, lot of guests, just before the first nighttime parade. I'm working the disability viewing area. It's a reserved section along the parade route for guests in wheelchairs and up to 4 companions. The companions must stay in the back to ensure that the disabled guests have viewing. This hillbilly hamplanet on an electric wheelchair scoots over to me with about 50 other toothless rednecks.

'HAY. IS THIS YALLZ SEATING FOR DISABLED FOLKS?!'

I say yes it is, and I explain that he may only bring four other people in with him and that they must stay along the back. He huffs and puffs and complains but eventually, he picks four of his favorite backwoods buddies and they enter the disability area, giving me death states all the while. 

About 20 minutes before showtime, a woman approaches me. She explains that her son is recovering from a nearly fatal motorcycle accident and has lost both of his legs, confining him to a wheelchair. They want to watch the parade together because it's a family tradition (they visit this theme park every year) but at this point there's no way he'll be able to see over everyone from his chair. She says she heard that they're only allowed four guests in the area but she wants to know if I'll make an exception as there are six of them. Because I have a heart, I say of course, and I allow them all in. 

This poor kid is no more than 22 and you can tell he's not handling this transition well. He looks mad and embarrassed, but his family seems hopeful. I'm chatting with them for a while when lo and behold, here comes hamplanet hillbilly from about an hour earlier.

'HE GOT SIX'

Excuse me? 

'HE GOT SIX PEOPLE WITH HIM. AH ONLY GOT FOUR. THAT AIN'T FAIR'

I don't even know what to say. This kid has NO LEGS. Before I can even say anything though, the kid speaks up.

'I'm actually disabled. You're just fat.'

I'm speechless. Everyone else in the section (this includes small children with cancer and their families, paraplegics, etc) are speechless. There are a few cheers. 

Hamplanet is not happy. He wobbles out of his chair and over to the kid.

'THE HELL'D YOU JUST SAY TO ME BOAH?!'

'I'm disabled, you're f--'

Before he can even get it out, hamplanet hillbilly PUNCHES HIM RIGHT IN THE JAW.

A huge fight breaks out, police are called, HH goes to jail (possibly prison). Even though HH got what he deserved, I'm always going to have a vendetta against fat people in electric wheelchairs for what he did to that kid."	t5_2vzax	True
1368753001.0	1ehmii	Shoving beliefs down other peoples' throats... Literally	kiarta	632	106	102	"Sorry in advance if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes, I'm typing this on my phone. Anyhow, let's begin. 

For the past several months, I have been dieting and exercising regularly. I have lost about 25 pounds so far. I still have maybe 10 more to go, but my weight loss is very noticeable. (I am female, by the way.)

Today at a small get together I was greeted by an overweight woman... Let us call her X. Although she was definitely pushing 350+ pounds, X seemed nice enough; we chatted for a bit about current affairs and other small talk. Everybody was having a nice time and soon there are snacks brought out. A tub of chocolate chip cookies, warm, aoft, and gooey. 

Everybody gravitates towards the cookies, each grabbing a few. X then notices I'm not taking any. She offers to get a cookie for me. I politely decline. She scoffs, telling me it is fine, one cookie won't hurt me, I'm skinny enough, etc etc. She is beginning to attract the attention of other people as I continue to tell her I am all set and I don't want a cookie. I'm starting to get embarrassed from all this attention as I politely decline once again. 

My words, however, fell on deaf ears; X fetched me a cookie and tried to hand it to me. I repeat myself for the 10th time, telling her I don't want a cookie. By now others are beginning to chime in. 

""One cookie won't hurt"" 
""C'mon kiarta, you're skinny enough!""
""Don't starve yourself!""
""Just have a cookie!""

I am now feeling very uncomfortable. I don't like attention and with everybody in the room berating me, I just want to leave. Then, X, hell-bent on making my life more uncomfortable, takes the cookie and tries to SHOVE IT IN MY MOUTH. 

Yep. She forcibly shoved this cookie into my face, trying with all her might to  open my jaws with her cookie pliers. She gets crumbs all over my face and shirt. I grab the cookie to cease the assault and take a step back, appalled. 

""Did you just try and shove a cookie down my throat?!"" 

She doesn't look the least bit ashamed. 

""Well, if you would just eat maybe I wouldn't have to force you to! You have to enjoy yourself."" 

I shit you not... These were the exact words this hambeast told me. I didn't even know how to respond for a moment; I was flabbergasted she assumed it was acceptable to stuff food in other people's faces. Even more so, the other people in the room didn't seem particularly fazed. They seemed set on the fact I needed to eat a cookie. One of them even had the nerve to pipe up once again, 

""Just eat the cookie, for Christs sake.""

I'm usually a pretty non confrontational person, but this put me over the edge. I went into full bitch mode (well, talking louder than normal with a dissatisfied expression). 

""Do I look like I'm enjoying myself now that you have attacked me with a cookie? I was perfectly fine before everybody started berating me. How about you learn some manners and stop shoving your own fat beast ideals down other people's throats! Some of us like to exhibit a little bit of self control... Which I think you could use a little more of!"" 

I then proceeded to storm off, leaving X with her mouth agape, chins jiggling in shock. How does one find it acceptable to literally shove food in someone else's face? I don't understand FPL.

1374165119.0	1ikg16	Chubs McNasty: The Roommate from Hamplanet Hell Part 1	gunpowdergelatine	668	147	80	"I loved my college apartment. I mean, LOVED IT. Lived there for three years. Year 1 was me and three close friends – awesome. Year 2, one friend had to take a year off for… reasons. Of course, he didn’t find out until right at the end of the lease, so if we wanted to stay in the apartment (which we definitely did), we had to find someone FAST. We call everyone we know trying to find a replacement and, lo and behold, a friend-of-a-friend is looking for a place. Terrific. We invite this prospective new roommate over for dinner and cards (we’re big on cards) and spend half a day cooking and cleaning in preparation. 

&gt; be me, 5’6”, 120 lbs and my best friends, Skinny, 5’9”, 110 lbs and Cranky, 5’11”, 160 lbs. 

&gt; knock knock

&gt; open door 

&gt; holyshitjesusmaryandjosephstalinwhatisthisnightmare?!?!?!?!

&gt; it’s definitely in the 400 lb range

&gt; and over 6 ft tall

&gt; “Hey guys. I’m Chubs McNasty.”

&gt; our hearts and floorboards are breaking

&gt; this is our last chance to keep our apartment but she’s (oh yes, it was a “she”)… she’s just… will she even fit in here?

&gt; pokerface, welcome her in, seat her at the table

&gt; never have I heard such an unhappy sound come from furniture. 

&gt; it was like the chair was dying

&gt; we’re trying to make the best of this… maybe she’s cool?

Skinny and I had made a gigantic lasagna with the intention of eating leftovers for the rest of the week. I mean, there were two or three pounds of beef in there, several pounds of cheese, and a corresponding amount of sauce and pasta. This would easily have been dinner for the three human roommates for a week, maybe more. But alas, it was not to be. 


&gt; So, what are we having?

&gt; Well we made a salad and some lasagna. Help yourself!

&gt; first mistake… never let her help herself

&gt; scoops a full half of this lasagna onto her plate

&gt; this portion of lasagna is bigger than her plate, so she just double layers it

&gt; we look on in awe

The three of us took reasonable portions of lasagna and plenty of salad. Chubs never even gave the greens a second look. She just plowed through that plate. Then, she went for seconds.


&gt; This lasagna is so good, guys!

&gt; Ummmmm…. Thanks! 

&gt; as if we couldn’t tell 

&gt; since you just ate the entire fucking pan

&gt; a whole pan of lasagna

&gt; and then you wanted to know where dessert was

Lucky for Chubs, Skinny and I were big cake people. We loved an excuse to bake a cake. One cake would last us ages; we usually had people over to make sure it got eaten before it went stale. Meeting a prospective new roommate qualified as an occasion, so we had made a cake, which we brought out with some pride. 

&gt; Oh, cake! Thanks, guys!

&gt; Skinny and I start cutting cake.

&gt; get three pieces down onto  plates

&gt; wait where is the cake?

&gt; it’s gone!

&gt; it was just here!

&gt; then we hear a horrible, slobbering, slavering maelstrom and look to the living room…

&gt; Chubs has seated herself smack in the middle of our couch and is INHALING THE REST OF THE CAKE!!!

&gt; holyshit

&gt; that’s a whole cake

A word on our couch: it’s big. Four or five people could sit comfortably on this thing without intruding on each other’s space. We know this because we did it regularly when we had friends over. Chubs sat, and she took up the entire couch. Literally no one could sit next to her on either side. Not that you’d want to, from the cake crumbs flying around. 

&gt; awkwardly drag dining room chairs over and sit in living room

&gt; she is somehow talking through this mountain of cake while shoveling it into her gaping maw

&gt; we learn  she is planning on becoming vegetarian

&gt; I’m sure the four pounds of beef you just ate will help that. 

&gt; we had been planning on playing cards

&gt; nope

&gt; she finishes this cake and then apologizes for moving to the couch – she can’t sit in an upright chair like that 
because it hurts her back

&gt; not a word about the army’s worth of food she just consumed

&gt; we sit for ten minutes, watching whatever was on TV

&gt; So… do you guys have anything to snack on? 

&gt; WHAT?!?!?!?

&gt; ummm… no… 

&gt; when she determines that there is no more food to be had, she decides to roll (literally) out

&gt; we stand around looking at each other for a minute, unsure of what just happened

&gt; we retreat to the couch to recover and find…

&gt; the couch is broken

&gt; it just sags right down in the middle 

&gt; it looks like a Dali clock

&gt; we sit on it and the three of us slide down to the middle, where the bottom of the couch is now resting on the floor 

You’d think we’d shut the door with relief, pack up, and move to another place. No apartment could be worth that, right? Listen. We seriously loved this place. LOVED IT. So we did the unthinkable. After she ate an entire pan of lasagna and an entire cake and then broke our couch, we let Chubs sign on to the lease. We didn’t think it could be that bad; she had been nice enough, right? Tune in next time to find out how wrong we were.

Fleas, bitch. Where'd they come from.

&gt; tee hee. Forgot to tell you! My cats have fleas! No big deal tee hee

gonna kill this fat fuck

am allergic to spiders

Might actually fucking die

tee fucking hee

This happened two times, okay: 

Cornered that fat lazy slob bitch who keeps eating allllll my food

Said ""we've got to bathe all the cats and fleabomb this place, which means a lot of cleaning, but it'll get rid of all the bugs, and I am sick of being bitten to death and blowing up like a fuckng balloon when a spider bites me. We're doing it two days from now""

Her: ""tee hee"" and toddles off to make some disgusting thing where she opens a can of refried beans, empties it on a tortilla, nukes it, and calls that a snack

Stand over her and snarl. ""I fucking mean it. Wednesday. I need your help and we need to get all the cats out of here or they will DIE. I have a place to park them all for free but I need you to help me""

Her:

&gt; tee hee sure

Wednesday comes by: she is missing. First time this bitch left the apartment ever. She doesn't leave for job interviews. She doesn't leave to talk to the apartment manager. She doesn't leave to even take out the trash, which we had agreed we'd split the duty on... her idea of her half is leaving it by the front door to rot, apparently forever. She never left for anything she didn't deem important enough for her exalted self to deal with. But having to clean? Didn't come home for days. 

Next time: same damn thing happens. If you don't know, fleabombing WILL kill every bug in your place, but takes a lot of work after (every dish, every pot, every surface in your house that you or your pets might eat off HAS to be cleaned). Worth it, though. If you've never dealt with fleas... I cannot believe this thunderthigh cunt just brought fleas into my life and they proliferated like mad. They were fucking *everywhere*. And she literally 'teehee'd at me. I wanted to kill her. 

She returns. I ask where she's been and she says she was hungry. 

For two fucking days? How much did you eat? For real? You lazy, no-good, worthless piece of fat fucktardary. 

I yelled at her and she vanished back into her Cheeto lair, yelling that I just didn't understand. 

I'm standing here with 57 fucking flea bites on my legs alone because of YOU, I have swellings all over my body because of YOU and your motherfucking spiders. You're right. I so do not understand how anyone could be this goddamn lazy. 

Also, I'm fucking hungry too. Wanna know why? Because whenever someone takes me to the grocery store, you eat EVERY GODDAMN THING IN THE HOUSE BEFORE I EVEN GET BACK FROM WORK. Two weeks of groceries in one day, how on earth, how the FUCK do you do that?!  

And now I'm living on the charity of friends, which to me is absolutely mortifying, but I have to fucking eat. 


At this point, I got pissed off. Things got interesting after that. Also, they accelerated.

I got an update today, or rather just a humorous... thing... that happened.

So of course I told bf what happened in the first one, and being the chill guy he is he pretty much just laughed it off/joked about it, all was well and right in the world. 

This morning I was on my way home from job #1 (4:30am-9:30am shift... whooo) and decided to swing by the uni and drop off a coffee for T like a good gf because he was having a bad morning. Get to the music department, coffees in hand, get to one of the student lounge/study areas immediately by the entrance. T is sitting at one of the tables editing sheet music for his class, but something is terribly wrong. 

In the next chair over, M is sitting facing him, big mac in hand with a (Canada-sized) bucket of pop in front of her. She's doing that thing where fat girls try to cross their legs to look feminine but really just end up jamming ankle over their knee and twisting their crossed leg at weird angles/heights. Just chowing down and watching T's screen and giggling at something or other. 

My evil side is a little bit happy she's there, dis gun b good and such. 

Walk over, ""surprise coffee!"" M just glares at me, says nothing, T gives me a desperate/haunted look and says ""you... are a life-saver."" Glances at M and back, meaningfully. 

I ask if he wants to take a lap (the uni has a long hallway that wraps around the entire floor. When I talk to people I like to ""take a lap,"" which is to walk along that hallway. Good way to stretch your legs/keep away from planet status). ""M can watch your stuff, I'm sure."" 

She's glaring daggers. ""T... can I talk to you?""

He's already out of his chair and to the doorway. ""Yeah sure, but it'll have to wait until I get back. Give me five minutes."" 

She's turning red. She's gun blow... 

We hightail it out of there, take the lap while I am brought up to speed. M has been stalking T for the past few days. Always just happens to be in the places he is in, sits next to him, touches him when they talk, hugs him at every opportunity, dropping hint after hint about how they should date.

""You're so funny! I need a guy *exactly* like you, teehee."" 

Apparently has also decided to give him a ""cutesy nickname."" It is, in his words, so very very clever. It's ""British."" Yeah. That's her nickname for him. Like ""Ohhh British, you're so cute!"" wtf. I can't make this shit up. 

We finish the lap and M is waiting expectantly. All traces of food have miraculously disappeared and she has clearly been fussing with her hair and such. I felt awful, but I had to get going because I had my second job to get to (freelance work, but just a LOT of it, had to get started) and announced to bf that I was taking off. She brightened noticeably and, right in front of me, asked: 

""Hey *British*, teehee..."" (man, he wasn't joking) ""-- do you want to go and get lunch *with me* so we can... talk?""

""What the hell M, you *just* ate McDick's! And it's not even lunch time."" 

...

Silence. 

I don't know if he meant for that to come out. 

She's gone red again. I'm paralyzed. I think we're about to be eaten. Tears are welling in her eyes. 

""That was the first thing I've had today --"" (it's 10:30am-ish) ""-- and I need to make sure I get enough food energy to get me through today! I don't have a break again until 5pm. Do you know what starvation mode is? If I don't get enough calories it won't go over well with my body."" 

I cut in. ""You just ate about 1500 calories, M."" 

""Yeah, and in order to be healthy I need about 2500 a day."" 

... 

'kay. 

Can't handle fat logic. Been up since ungodly hours of the morning wrestling with 1600lb animals. Don't need to repeat the process if she decides to rage. Have to abandon bf to his fate. I am awful gf. 

Sorry, have to go. 

Goodbye hug. Goodbye peck on cheek. I think she's turning purple. 

""Thanks for the coffee, babe."" 

Audible squeak of rage from purple planet's direction. 

""Ohhhh look at the time, time for class, 'kaybye M, bye SometimesIart!"" 

We bolt in opposite directions. We survived this round. 

**TL;DR**: Surprise boyfriend with coffee, learn that the girl who called me a thin-obsessed slut is continually hitting on him, also witnessed a 2000+cal intake from her before noon. "	t5_2vzax	True

Somehow this monstrosity has mustered up the momentum to flip his ass out of the bed, (breaking it in the process). He's wedged himself in between his bed, and the air conditioner. He tries to attack all staff who come near him, and never stops screaming abuse at everyone.

Had to call 911 for help, EMTs came, and in turn called the fire department. 

EMTs look pissed again.

Took 1 hour, 8 people, and our people-crane to get him out the door and headed to the hospital.

Last I heard, the mother didn't want him to come back because she felt we weren't feeding him enough.

[The White Girl Wasted Playlist](http://imgur.com/a/yWaVL), if you wanted to get sloshed and sloppy.

To be clear, a lot of this story is about John's girlfriend Hannah, and while it isn't FAT logic, its definitely bitch logic, and it's part of the story. 

John started dating Hannah in early September. She was about 5'10, and very thin. She did amateur modeling, and was mainly some kind of catalog girl. She was at the start of her career, and apparently was also trying to pursue a degree in fashion. She and John come into the bar one night during my shift. As soon as I see them, I smile and wave, and am met with the coldest stare I've ever gotten. This girl was pulling the ugliest face, it made her look like a cat in heat. As soon as John brought her over to me, she looks at him, then back at me and flashes me this big fake smile and does a high pitched ""hello"". When John introduced me as his ""best friend"", she does a double take and says something like ""I though [coworker] was your best friend!"" Nope, it's me, ya cunt. I didn't lose my shit once that night. Even though she sat at the bar (John wanted a booth) loudly talking about her job and making out with him every time I was within ear shot. And this is not a big bar. We had this regular, Frank, who was really nice but also middle aged and balding, asked me out for the 300th time and Hannah laughed and said ""Just your type, huh?"" I turn around and look at her. ""Yup.""

I got home that night (John had went back to Hannah's place with her), and told Sasha that this girl clearly had a problem with me. Sasha didn't believe me, mostly because John usually had better taste in women then this. Whatever. We were talking in the kitchen, and even though we were trying to use hushed voices, our living room troll hurtled out of it's couch and crash landed at the counters. Maggie wanted to know what we were saying about John. Amazing hearing for a person who doesn't seem to register I want her to toss out her own trash. We tried to ignore her, because she had tried to ""borrow a couple things"" from our closets over the past week, tearing two work blouses of mine, a club dress Sasha had just bought, and my college sweat pants (because Maggie doesn't have enough sweatpants). It was incredibly frustrating, especially because we had just come back from a hike, to find the kitchen barren, the living room completely buried in wrappers, and a giant cut in the kitchen table because Maggie was ""trying to kill a spider"". Her answer to our mutilated clothes was ""I've been losing A LOT of weight recently, so I thought I could try some anorexic clothing."" 

""Maggie, you've been doing nothing but eating in front of the TV""

""I've been blogging a lot though, and typing burns like 300 calories an hour. I have to keep up my caloric intake!!!""

What?. We started locking our rooms after that. Sasha almost punched Maggie in the face because she spent a lot of money on her clothes, and expected them to last her for a long time. She actually jumped on top of a sleeping Maggie one night and DEMANDED money for our ripped clothes. Maggie is very scared of Sasha. 

Anyway, she kept pestering us to find out what we were saying about John, and I blurted out ""HE HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND, OKAY?""

She started crying and ran to her room. The entire night she threw books against the walls and wailed about ""CHEATING SCUM"". Sasha, Andrew, and I were legitimately worried she was going to hurt herself(or the walls), so around 3 in the morning, it was decided to perform an extraction. This was a huge mistake. As soon as I walked into the room, I met about half our kitchenware. Bowls with spoiled, cereal dyed milk. Plates with giant streaks of crusty sauce and oil. Almost all of our spoons caked with nutella. I couldn't even begin to describe the smell. We pulled her out, sat her down and told her to calm the fuck down before she hurt herself. This was the attention that Maggie had been looking for, and Sasha and I  then had to sit and listen to hours of ""I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING"". We kept listening while Andrew performed the second mission that night: Operation Cutlery Freedom. No amount of logic would suffice. So I just got fed up and told her ""yeah, well she's a little bit mean, so maybe it won't last long."" I instantly regretted that, for two reasons:

 1) because I really didn't know her, and my  judgements were colored from that horrendous bar experience.

 2) Maggie's face lit up like a sweaty, red traffic light. ""Ugh, that stupid skinny bitch is going to see what a REAL WOMAN looks like."" 

Shit. 

Fast forward to Andrew's birthday dinner, which is set in our backyard. It's mid-October, really nice fall weather, and we decided we'd do steak, fries, apple cider and maybe a couple pies, as they're Andy's favorite. Maggie invites herself at word one, and Andy said ""whatever, just buy more steak."" We got some money from Maggie, ""THATS MY PRESENT TO ANDY-CANDY"" (yup).  We had about 10 people coming, the five of us from the house, four of Andy's friends, and of course, Hannah. 

Earlier in the day, we were prepping the food, swatting Maggie away from pie, 

""I DONT EVEN LIKE FRUIT"" 

""Then why are you inching over to the window sill every five seconds?""

We had Cherry, Pumpkin, Apple, and Banana Cream. Maggie actually snuck up and cartoon-style stole the Banana Cream (my favorite). I found her in the backyard when I went to clean out the grill, face-first in the tin. Shoulda' decoy-pied. I grabbed the fly swatter, and swatted her on her tundra of an ass. She let out a yelp like I'd whipped her with a cat o nine tails. She proceeded to lecture me about keeping her blood sugar up, and I told her to go chug the sugar bowl, not eat the birthday pies. We had John play pie goalie after that, which was great because every time she made an approach (teeheeing) he'd start screeching ""PIE PERIMETER HAS BEEN BREACHED, LAND TANK MAKING AN APPROACH"". She thought it was HILARIOUS, and we had to cut potatoes to this lovely sound.

Hannah came over two hours early. That was okay, it's not like we had to entertain her or anything. Dressed in a really nice white dress, high heels, and lovely jewelry. She walked into the kitchen as Maggie was playing peek-a-boo with the pies, John guarding. Hannah's eye widened. John had said she REALLY didn't like fat people, logic or not. Maggie took one look at Hannah and made the exact same facial expression. The battle had begun.

Hannah tries to get a kiss from John, instead gets met with a whole lot of ham. Sweaty ham. Playing Pie-Peek-a-Boo with John may have been the most exercise Maggie's gotten since mandated gym class. Hannah immediately pulls away, says ""'Scuse me honey"" and mean-girl laughs her way into John's arms. She waves half-heartedly at me and Sasha, and says "" HI BIRTHDAY BOY"" as loud as she can. John told me to be nice to her because ""she doesn't have a lot of girl friends"". Wow. I wonder why. 

Hannah asks Sasha, who is black, if she is making ""soul food"". Sasha starts laughing, before Hannah looks at her, insulted, and says "" I was just asking!"" ...Sasha gives me a look. Yeah, bitch, I was exaggerating. Maggie picks that moment to scream ""RACIST"". Hannah stalks off to the backyard, dragging John behind her. Ugh.

We're now just drinking beer in the kitchen. Andy comes into the kitchen, pulls me aside, and tells me his friend Todd is *really* looking forward to spending some time me. ...Okay. Apparently Todd thinks I'm just his type. We've hung out before, and he seemed, just little….pushy. This dinner was turning into a giant shitstorm. And I didn't even have Banana Cream Pie. 

Andy's bros arrive. Besides Todd, they are pretty inconsequential to the story. Lets say, Glenn, Gary, and Ross. So Todd is about 5'9 and very muscular. Biceps like mountains. As soon as he sees me, he's like glue. Keeps touching my hair, my waist. Showing off his ""physique"", lifting up his shirt to ""fan himself"". I'm getting really really uncomfortable, and just keep trying to avoid him by making excuses to be away from the backyard/kitchen. I've just surfaced from my twentieth bathroom trip, and am making my way out to the kitchen when I hear a shriek. We've just started grilling, and I'm really hoping Maggie didn't try to liberate the steaks from their fiery resting place. But no. There, in the doorway from the kitchen to the backyard, is Hannah, holding the cherry pie above her head, while Maggie body slams into her. I run over and tackle Maggie, trying to hold  mountain of pasty flesh back. She is unbelievably greasy. 

""WHAT YOU BITCH??! FIRST MY MAN, NOW MY PIE?!?!?!?"" Maggie screams. Hannah starts laughing and dangling the pie. 

""Want the pie, you piggy slut??"" I try to tell Hannah to go into the yard, NOW, before Maggie exhausts my strength. Too late. One hammy foot is making a break for the pie, catches it as Hannah is at a downswing. Artificial cherry filling goes flying onto Hannah's beautiful, white as paper dress. Maggie can not (obviously) keep her fat foot so high in the air, so she does the only logical thing: fall backwards onto the soft, pillowy mattress that is my body. 

I don't really remember too much of this. It happened so fast. I managed to push myself back, so the cabinets broke my fall. Maggie lies splayed across the kitchen floor, wailing. Hannah is screaming bloody murder, pie filling rolling off her dress. Carrie, the dessert years. The guys enter, and for a split second, I'm sure they all thought Maggie had shot Hannah, with the way they were both blubbering. I was just registering the sheer pain in my back and head, and let out a groan as I felt a nice big lump forming on my head. John and (oh joy) Todd ran to see if I was bleeding; they thought I had fallen onto the countertop and hit my head. The rest of the guys tried to hoist up Maggie. It was not good. She cried and cried and DEMANDED an ambulance. We thought she had broken a bone. Nope. We called the ambulance, just as Hannah screamed ""FUCK THIS HOUSE"" and ran out, cherry goo trailing behind her. When the ambulance gets there, the EMTs take one look at Maggie, and then sigh deeply. We have to help ROLL her onto a stretcher, after we tell the EMT  guys that she's definitely not paralyzed, and that my now bruised and aching lower body helped break her fall. They don't look so concerned. They get her out of there, and Andy sighs deeply and says something like ""it's weird she didn't bounce"". 

the rest of the birthday was kind of awkward. John tried to call Hannah back, and she returned, one hour later, still cherry sauced. She borrowed one of my dresses, and made a point of calling me ""well-rounded"". We didn't have enough pie.

&gt;AA says he needs a place for ""just a couple of weeks"" until he gets his new place straightened out. We have spare room, so I agree.

&gt;Ohtobeyoungagain.exe

&gt;Regret looms immediately after seeing his laundry.

&gt;Fast Forward three weeks. AA is still there. New species of fungus has evolved from the room we lent him. Creepy smell that HNCE and I won't go near. This is how ""The Last of Us"" must have started, in hindsight.

&gt;Notice that our food stores depleting rapidly. What once lasted us a month now got us barely through the week. AA claimed he would buy his own food when he moved in. Tried to blame HNCE, who barely eats enough for half a person. Blatantly denies food thievery.

&gt;HNCE and I hatch plan to use hidden camera plant (which we previously used for taping us having sex) to catch AA in the act. Take the poor camera into the kitchen, point at fridge, and wait. We figured his fatlogic wouldn't stand up to hard evidence once it was presented.

GodModeNaive.bat

&gt;HNCE and I leave for weekend. Come back and watch film. We thought we were clever, but we were wrong. So, So wrong.

&gt;Repulsed when we started hearing sounds of porn in the living room, along with the desperate rhythmic cries of a couch suffering beyond measure. All in all, the wretched noises lasted less than five minutes. Cringed in further disgust at the sounds of AA's orgasm peeling through the living room. It was kind of like a cross between a pig getting slaughtered and that thing that haunts you in your nightmares.

&gt;Seconds after sounds end, hear the sounds of a manatee flopping about in the living room. Nope, it's AA getting of the couch.

&gt;Is that thunder?

&gt;The camera literally shakes at the footfalls of AA's lumbering frame. The camera then taped the evidence of AA reaching into the fridge, and eating our food right out of it...reaching into bags of lunchmeat and other goodies.

&gt;Taken aback with unmitigated horror when we realize that we had not heard the sounds of a sink or other handwashing device.

&gt;He denied eating our food. Showed AA the video. Claimed it was his, then recanted, claiming beetusthighroid.

&gt;Kicked him out that day. Spent the next month detoxing the room he stayed in, and trying to convince ourselves that we never actually ate his beetus jizz.

More from AA later!

No greentext because im on my phone.

Be me, slightly athletic, nothing special male.

Visiting my gf's home home (not her uni house) to meet the family and see her.

She tells me that some of her friends are meeting up in a bar to catch up, and that we're invited to join. I agree because i've not met these people before and would like to do so, plus i had a uni friend in the area who i thought i could drag out too (he couldn't make it but thats irrelevant).

Be that evening, we go to the bar. Place seems more upmarket than my ""normal"" kind of watering hole and there's live music on in an hour or so. Score!

Meet her friends, nice bunch of people, girls vary from model looks to a bit podgy, guys also in a variety of sizes. All really friendly and quite intelligent. I let my gf go catch up while i play pool with some of the guys.

Halfway through the game, i notice the balls trembling. My beer is rippling. 

An earthquake? In ruddy old blighty? Highly unlikely.

The culprit appears from round the corner. Roughly 5'6, 150kg (ish). Wearing a striped yellow and black top, makes her look suspiciously like a bumblebee.

She waddles around the pool table, with no apparent goal. I see her making eyes at some of the guys. She then dissapears (somehow)

Whatever, carry on playing pool. I ask if anyone knew who she is. Turns out to be someone 2 years below my gf's year (so while my gf is in second year of uni, she's just finishing sixth form). Noone really knew her apart from that.

Game ends, i go to the bar to get drinks before the music starts. Good ol' beer for me and some vodka mixer for the gf. 

As i'm done paying, i get tapped on the shoulder. I turn around with drinks in hand.

Its the bumblelard. Before i get to say anything, she reaches for the mixer and squeaks ""is that for me? Aren't you a sweetie!"" and goes to KISS ME.

I nope out, a little shellshocked. Then i realise she still has her grimy paw on the mixer. 

Now, when i have a couple of drinks, i get brutally honest. Not mean, just honest.

I stammer out ""i'm sorry, what are you doing?""

BL: ""i thought you were buying me a drink, i saw you make eyes at me earlier!""

Me: ""Why would i buy a complete stranger a drink? And why would you think i want to kiss you?!""

By this time, the argument is causing a small commotion. 

BL: ""because you obviously find me attractive! I saw the way you looked at me earlier! And you should feel lucky that i've picked you, i had every guy in here looking at me!""

Me: ""I'm sorry, what? I'm not interested in you, i don't want anything to do with you, and if you will excuse me i need to get back to my girlfriend""

BL: "" How can you not like this?! (She waved her free hand over her body) And who's your girlfriend? That skinny thing? (She pointed at one of my gf's friends who was walking past and smiled at me). I'm taking this drink anyway!""

By this point, a bouncer rolled up to spectate what was happening. I nodded to him, to make sure he knew i was aware of him.

Me: ""If you take that drink, it would be theft. I'm sure the bouncers would not take kindly to that. And it's none of your business who i'm dating.  I will give you one last chance to let go before i ask the bouncers to intervene.""

BL, shrieking at this point: ""How dare you insult me like that! It's because i'm larger isn't it?! I'm taking this drink because you insulted me!""

I signal to the bouncer that she's getting too much to handle, and he moves closer.

Me: ""No, it's not because of your size. It's because your ego and sense of entitlement MATCHES your size.""

I could see her boiling at that point. I let go of the mixer so that the bouncer could pull her away if needed.

What happens next is somewhat crazier. Instead of just taking the drink and waddling off (which is what i expected), she throws the mixer contents at me. 

I dodge, using drunkenmonkeyreflexes.exe, and the drink hits the poor unsuspecting bar girl standing behind me.

At that point, the bouncer grabs BL by (what i assume is) her waist, and hauls her out of the bar. 

Another bouncer shows up, apologises to me what happens, and gets the bargirls to make me another mixer.

I left an extra tip because of it, and wandered back to my gf like nothing happened.

Tl;dr: fatty tries to steal drink, fails, gets chucked out

I get temporarily assigned to working in a clinic until the army can figure out what to do with me. My doctor that I'm assigned to is a drunk and I have to run my section of the clinic on my own. **All of my rage**. A good benefit was that I was forced to learn my craft much faster and more fully than most medics at clinics. I see mostly soldiers, but occasionally we'd see military dependents(families) for minor issues. This comes into play later.

One day, I had just set the land speed record of treating soldiers for the clap and was looking forward to a break, when the ground started to shake. That's not a joke, nor an exaggeration. My main exam room was close to the admin area, and I can usually feel a slight vibration when people walk by. [This was different](http://i.imgur.com/2k23GGA.gif).

I get a knock on my door and it's admitting nurse Smiley. ""Hey Squirrel, Cpt. Drunky said that you'd see a couple of patients. They're military dependents"". 

Fuck. I pulled up the file on the computer and stopped nurse smiley. ""Hey, who did the vitals?""

""I did.""

""Is the machine broken? The patient is 13 and has a higher BP than I do. And mine is so bad that I'm walking the borderline of needing medication.""

""Wait till you see him. I'll walk them back.""

I start prepping to redo the vitals manually when my water bottle starts doing the Jurassic Park shuffle again. I had the briefest feeling of ""Oh no"" when nurse Smiley opened the door and led Jupiter and Ganymede into my room. 

Fuck.

I told Ganymede to hop up on the exam table while feeling deep concern that I'd have to drag it out to the artillery range later. The smell was horrendous. 

For the sake of privacy, I'm not going to post everything, but the symptoms all pointed a bright a shining light to the beetus. However that wasn't the most worrying thing.

I asked Jupiter what Ganymede's diet consisted of. ""Well, he likes McDonalds""

""No, I mean what do you feed him regularly""

""Well McDonalds. He gets angry if I don't give it to him"". 

At this point, I know the army isn't going to let me stay in. It was how seriously I took my oath that kept me coming in and doing my job through the astronomical pain of a shattered leg and damaged nerves. 

Something broke in me when she said that. A little voice said ""Fuck this, what are they going to do? Kick you out of the army?""

""Ma'am, check this out.""

I took a set of vitals off the kid. And then I took a set of vitals off me. 

""You see this, my heart rate and bp are better than your sons, and I'm a chronic pain sufferer. See the heart rate, this kid's heart is actually struggling to keep up with his mass. Frankly, I've never seen anything like it.""

""Ma'am, with all due respect, by which I mean none at all, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard from a parent. If you weren't such a tub of fat, I'd ask you how it feels knowing you're going to bury your son, but you look like you probably won't make it past fifty."" 

I had just set fire to Jupiter's atmosphere.

She was shrieking like a banshee at me and calling me every name in the book. Promising up and down that my career was over. No shit, notice the cane? I hobbled out to admitting and grabbed a formal complaint information sheet. The whole time she was screaming, I was filling out my Name, Rank, and Unit. Because I'm all about helping and I didn't want another medic with a similar name to get in trouble in my place. 

Then I heard the clapping. No, my friends, this wasn't a Disney movie slow clap moment. Her dangling arm flab was actually hitting her side as she flailed her arms in rage and was clapping against her side. 

She noticed it about the same time I did and I starting chuckling and handed her the information sheet. That's when it happened. She straight up slapped me as hard as she could. Tubs of fun had an arm on her, I'll give her that. Fifteen minutes later, she's in the back of an MP squad car while they were waiting on the husband to come over from his unit to pick up Ganymede.

I did clinic duty another month before being transferred to an on-post combat oriented medic school as an instructor. AWWWW YEEEAAAHH!

**TLDR: I got a hamplanet so pissed at me that she got herself arrested and I got myself transferred to a new job** 

A PS to all this, I've wanted to post this story for a while, but my leg is in a lot of pain tonight, so I'm home bound. Forgive any spelling mistakes in my replies because I am going to be drinking tonight.

Part one links to my 1st 2 encounters with Kirby

So First of all, well can call GAB, FAB now, because SHE SAID YES!! YAY ARMY BRO!!!!

Second, SO SORRY!!! I was planning on writing the follow up that happened on the 3rd/4th, the night Kirby found out about Army Bro's engagement. But alas, my cousin's wife went into labor for 20 hours, then had a c-section, then I had to mow my grandma's lawn, got sunburned doing so, ya know, life happened, and I got busy. Please secure all jimmies, this will be worse than the last follow up. If you lose them, i hold no responsibility.

&gt;Be waiting to take chair I re-covered for Kirby's mom down to them when they get home.

&gt;So, waiting on the porch, PM &amp; PD get back from their trip, PM gets out, waves, yells for me to come down ASAP

&gt;she's pissed, wants to know what the heck happened while they were gone

&gt;tell her everything, start to finish, they're both pissed

&gt;Kirby comes waddling out like nothing happened, says ""heeeey LeadFoot, why haven't you guys called to hang out again?!""

&gt;[mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/m6VJh.gif) bitch are you SERIOUS?!

&gt;I kind of just ignore her and hand the chair to PM (it was a small kitchen chair, turned out great)

&gt;PM unleashes a tirade of insults and reprimands at Kirby

&gt;Kirby freezes in shock, realizes I have told them

&gt;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?! WHY WOULD YOU TELL THEM ABOUT THAT AWFUL NIGHT THAT EVERYONE BULLIED ME?!?! AND NOW THEY'RE YELLING AT MEEEEE?!?! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!

&gt;[my literal face when she says we bullied her] (http://i.imgur.com/LSkTs.gif)

&gt;calmly tell her a laundry list of reasons that no one wants her back in our group, ever, and that I think she needs help for her problems, PM and PD agree

&gt;without thinking, I say, you really need to leave my brother and his fiance' alone

&gt;Kirby's face literally turns red 

&gt;YELLS at me that I encouraged army bro to pick FAB and calls me a backstabbing cunt

&gt;she turns, and stomps back into the house

&gt;PM apologizes profusely, I change topics, ask about their trip

&gt;I talk with PM and PD for about 30 mins about their trip and my phone starts going crazy

&gt;army bro says to come home NOOOOOWWW

&gt;go home, army bro turns his laptop towards me, and says ""what.the.fuck."".....this is what i see on his facebook

Here are the messages copy/pasted, except for name changes:

&gt;she sent [this] (http://youtu.be/AcmNX4llujc) song to him first, then these are the messages copy/pasted from Army Bro's facebook page, they were sent all within the 30 mins Kirby stomped back in, and I talked to PM &amp; PD

&gt;Army Bro responded to the first message with the video in it, said that she was on thin ice and he was going to call the cops for harassment:

2nd Message to Army bro:
Army Bro,
Why??? I KNOW U have 2 feel sumthing for me, I can tell by the way U look at me, and all the shit U say in front of FAB is just to save your ass so she won't know that you really want me. I'm a 4giving person n this is an open ended invite to come over. We can get n the hot tub and mess around, mom and dad won't ever know. I just cant except that U wud want to MERRY a girl that wud dump water in sum1's lap n call them names. U have my #, text me when U R comin over. I can cook U dinner 2.""

This was FAB response from army bro's account:
""Listen Kirby,
We REALLY don't know why you have this delusion that army bro is in to you. He has made it clear from the very start that he and I are together, and have been for some time. He is my FIANCE' now. This is the last time I am going to tell you to PLEASE for the love of all that is good in the world, BACK.OFF. He himself has already told you to not contact him. Sending him creepy songs doesn't help your case either, Kirby. I will also never apologize for the water incident or the names that I called you because you pushed and pushed and pushed, until I couldn't take any more of your delusional bullshit, and your jabs at myself and my relationship. And for acting EXTREMELY insane. WE WILL CALL THE POLICE IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE US ALONE. We have more than enough proof that you have been harassing us, and witnesses to boot. I FULLY EXPECT this to be the last time we ever talk, and that you ever contact army bro again. GOOD.BYE.""

The response that finally made Army Bro call the police and press charges:
""LISTEN YOU SKINNY BITCH, YOU WON'T DO SHIT, YOU NEED TO GIVE ARMY BRO A CHANCE TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO ISN'T SUCH A FUCKING ASSHOLE, TWIG SHAPED SLUT. I may have anger issues I admit, but it's only cuz ppl won't except the FACT, yeah, F-A-C-T, that big is beautiful, n always try to shame me into being tha thin bitch that society wants me 2 B. I will never B that, I am AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL, 480 POUND FUCKING AMAZING catch. Army bro deserves a real woman, with a shape, n actual fuckin real boobs. U got like, what, c cups? I got fuckin' DDD's bitch, n U think he wudnt like that, HAHAHA, U R the delusional one tot hink he aint N to me, I know it by the way he looks at me, and he only says to back off in front of U cuz he dont want U 2 know that he wants this. U wait and C, he's gonna leave you so fast when he finaly has some of this 480 pound white chocolate. BYE BITCH, and expect army bro to hear frum me as much as I wanna message him. He only threatening that shit cuz of U, U wont do SHIT, hahahaha, what a fuckin' joke U are, U whore. That ring will be mine one day, JUST WATCH, WHORE.""

&gt;at this point army bro is in full rage mode, has had enough, looks at me, says....""fuck it. I'm calling the police""

&gt;police arrive, army bro shows them all of the facebook messages, letters, and tells them about the crotch grab.

&gt;cop asks where she lives

&gt;we all look at each other and say...""three houses down""

&gt;one of the deputies goes outside and pulls around and parks in Kirby's driveway

&gt;The blinds are open and the window is open because it was a cool breeze kind of night, so we see and hear everything that goes down

&gt;we see Kirby being hauled out in handcuffs, cuffed in the front, because her arms wouldnt fit behind her back, SCREAMING at the top of her lungs to please not take her, she will really leave him alone now

&gt;then the freaking unthinkable happens

&gt;Kirby. RUNS. Just takes off down the street. Not very fast, but she gave it an A+ effort

&gt;Trips in the ditch and rolls, coming to rest on her back, kinda like a turtle or some shit, ya know

&gt;Cop 1 that had followed cop 2 out of the door, helps cop 1 pick her up

&gt;she starts twisting around, calling them every name in the book, cussing at us once she spots us through the window

&gt;They finally have to wrestle her into the back seat

&gt;Cop 2 stays in cruiser, doing cop stuff

&gt;cop 1 comes back and informs us that she has a prior record of harassment and a restraining order against her from someone else.

&gt;thatactuallydoesntsurpriseus.jpg

&gt;Kirby is charged with harassment and resisting arrest (we know this for sure now) and army bro fully intends on the protection order being filed

&gt;PM comes down and apologizes to army bro, says for NO ONE to bail her out, that she will sit in jail until they release her.

&gt;GO PM!

&gt;says she is having her evaluated once she is released because she honestly thinks she is a danger and is bonafide CRAZY

&gt;we all hug PM and tell her we know she has tried to help in the past. Kirby is just nuts.

&gt;I get a text from Kirby today saying she is so sorry, to please forgive her, she just got hurt when army bro ""cheated on her"" and she just snapped

&gt;yathink?!.mpeg

&gt;i tell her to lose all of our numbers, to never text me again, all future events PM &amp; PD are invited to, EXCLUDES her crazy ass.

&gt;The end?????? We shall see. 

I may pick up a few stories here and there still being friends with PM. I'll post them if she does any more crazy ass stuff.

&gt;&gt;run around the melbourne botanical garden (the tan track) a few times every week

&gt;&gt;saturday morning, no homework, beautiful weather, flowers blooming around the track, bird sounds, greeted by fellow runners

&gt;&gt;feelgood.jpg

&gt;&gt;my third time around the track (one lap = 3.8km), jogging as slow as i could, huffing and puffing a bit

&gt;&gt;suddenly hear rumble, feel vibration

&gt;&gt;mehprobablyanotherearthquake.gif

&gt;&gt;suddenly weather darken, birds fly away, flowers wilt, young kids running start crying

&gt;&gt;on the road around the track a wild landwhale appears, at least 150 kg +, appears to have no neck, nearly spherical, her folds of fat ripple like waves in the aegean sea as she waddle

&gt;&gt;try to look away but fail

context: even though Australia is statistically fatter than America, we don't normally see morbidly obese people around. not sure why.

&gt;&gt;keep jogging

&gt;&gt;landwhale obviously glaring at me, waddling on the road

&gt;&gt;used ignore

&gt;&gt;was not very effective

&gt;&gt;landwhale shouts at me in a bellowing bogan voice ""KEEP RUNNING FATTY""

&gt;&gt;i ignore her and keep jogging

&gt;&gt;this obviously displeases jabba, she angrily follows me

&gt;&gt;got near the end of the track, about to go on pretty steep hill

&gt;&gt;landwhale keeps following and shouting racists insults at me, but obviously having trouble keeping up after two minutes

&gt;&gt;run up hill

&gt;&gt;she tries to follow

&gt;&gt;fails

&gt;&gt;trips and tumbles down the hill

&gt;&gt;her spherical shape is perfect for rolling

&gt;&gt;run past her and give her the finger

I should be happy right now, but I feel kind of upset for some reason. Oh well. Sorry for bad greentext, first timer.


EDIT: Wrote this last night, checked this morning and WOAH. Thanks everyone. I by ""upset"" I meant that I was kind of worried that she was seriously hurt, but I saw some other runners try and rescue the beached whale so she should be fine. Again, THANKS EVERYONE."	t5_2vzax	True
1367172409.0	1da7ds	Mr. Shuga Needs an Operation.	Krackstirnt	595	84	79	"Long time lurker, first time poster.  Forgive my formatting errors and all that.

I'm a nurse at a hospital, so I've got a lot of morbesity stories.  This one seems the most appropriate for this sub.

&gt;Be me, working as a nurse at the hospital.

&gt;Be getting patients ready for surgery first thing in the morning.

&gt;Notice Mr. Shuga lumbering up the 3 stairs to the registration desk.

&gt;Mr. Shuga is typical sized fatty, we get them all day erryday at the pre-surgery department.

&gt;No worries, building is structurally sound and we got top of the line hambeast wrangling gear.

&gt;Mr. Shuga is registered, time to take his height and weight.

&gt;Disgonabegood.pdf

&gt;Mr Shuga is exactly 5ft 10in, 374 lbs or 177.8 cm, 170KG.  BMI is 53.7.

&gt;Put Mr. Shuga in private pre-op room, start asking him the usual questions.

&gt;Are you allergic to any medications, Mr. Shuga?

&gt;I don’t know, doesn’t it say in my chart?

&gt;Typical…moving on.

&gt;What are you having done today, Mr. Shuga?

&gt;I’m getting mah foot removed (or whatever diabeetus  related surgery, I can’t remember exactly).

&gt;Okay, that’s what I have down here on your paperwork as well.

&gt;Have you had anything to eat or drink this morning, Mr. Shuga?

&gt;Yes I had a coffee.

&gt;Mkay…you had instructions to only have sips of clear liquid after midnight.  Was there anything in the coffee?  (Black coffee is still considered a clear liquid).

&gt;Yeah, I had it with cream and (wait for it) SHUGA.

&gt;Thinking to myself, oh well he blew it!  This type of shit gets surgeries cancelled.

&gt;But Mr. Shuga, you were given specific instructions.  Why didn’t you follow them?

&gt;Because I got DA SHUGA, and I needed SHUGA to keep mah SHUGA up.

&gt;Yes, Mr. Shuga, we know you are diabetic.  That’s why you were booked for FIRST THING IN THE FUCKING MORNING!

&gt;Ahem, Mr. Shuga, I have to go call the doctor now and let him know about the coffee.  Have you had anything else this morning?

&gt;Yeah, I had a donut with the coffee.

&gt;Patrickstewartfacepalm.jpg

&gt;Pardon me, Mr. Shuga, did you say you ATE A DONUT ON THE WAY TO SURGERY?

&gt;Yeah, I needed to…

&gt;Yes, I know, keep your shuga up.  Okay, I’ll be right back.  I have to call the doctor.

&gt;Disgonabebad.frownyface

&gt;Hi Doc, you know Mr. Shuga who is here to have his whatever amputated due to DA SHUGA?

&gt;Well, he had a donut this morning as well as coffee with cream and sugar.

&gt;Cue irate surgeon with a pre-existing attitude.

&gt;WHAT?!?  Why did Mr. Shuga eat a fucking donut?!?  Was he not told about being NPO after midnight?!?

&gt;I don’t know, Doc, cuz fatties gonna fat?  He was given the same instructions as everyone else.

&gt;See Doc storming down the corridor, get the fuck out of the way.

&gt;Doc goes into Mr. Shuga’s room, presumably to have a stern yet professional talk.

&gt;Doc comes out several minutes later.  Yeah, he mad.

&gt;So Mr. Shuga has to wait 8 hours to have his surgery now, which fucks my schedule all up, pisses me off, makes me late, wastes operating room time, snort, bark, bitch, complain.  Call in my next patient, STAT!

&gt;Yes, Doc, I realize that.  We’ll go ahead and call in your next patient, try to get them here right away.

&gt;Get things sorted out for the surgeon.  Highfive.gif

&gt;But this takes us back to Mr. Shuga, who was supposed to start his operation at 7am.  Lolnope!

&gt;Mr. Shuga has to wait around my department for 8 fucking hours for his stomach to empty prior to surgery.

&gt;Guess what?  Mr. Shuga spends the day complaining about how he is soooo hungry, needs something to eat, gotta feed his beetus cuz he’s got DA SHUGA and he’s starving.

&gt;No fucking shit, that’s why you were scheduled to go first!  Your stupid fat logic screwed that all up, now didn’t it, Mr.  Shuga?  Next time trust us, we are the professionals.

TL:DR; Fatty pays no attention to his pre-op instructions, eats donut right before surgery because beetus, has to wait 8 hours until he can get his surgery done, royally pisses his surgeon off, proceeds to complain about being hungry and his shuga all day, royally pisses me off.

&gt;Doing the late shift because why not, more money to be made at night

&gt;It's about 1AM

&gt;Next call is to our main office

&gt;There is a queue of people waiting to be taken home

&gt;At the front of the queue is a woman, gotta be 5'6"" tops, 300lbs minimum

&gt;ShesTheNextCustomer.ham

&gt;Really don't wanna pick her up, I've just had my suspension fixed

&gt;Ah well, a job's a job, I guess

&gt;Pull up, and she gets into the front passenger seat, her 2 (normal sized) friends get in the back

&gt;She's that wide, that her rolls literally spill over to the centre console between the drivers seat and the passenger seat (the bit that has the parking brake and the gear stick - yes, it's a stick shift)

&gt;I had a can of energy drink in the centre console

Inb4 diabeetus accusations - it was a sugar free Relentless btw, no calories, but lots of caffeine to keep me awake in the small hours

Anyway,

&gt;As mentioned, her bulk spills over into the centre console, and there is an audible sound of a can being crushed

&gt;The can was nearly empty, so it's not the end of the world but still, WTF

&gt;About to set off

&gt;Realise I can't get the car into first gear because passengers fat is blocking the gear stick (I'm a BritFag^TM so driver sits on the right, and first gear is top left of the gears)

&gt;Pushing pretty hard to get the car into gear

&gt;Hamplanet notices I'm pushing against her fat to get the car into first

&gt;""Are my legs in the way?""

&gt;I reply ""yes, just a bit""

&gt;""Well, just work around them, they're the legs god gave me, I can't help it if they're a bit plumpy""

&gt;Give it a final push, manage to push the stick into first

&gt;As soon as I build up to third, I'm not changing gear again, even if it means running a red light

&gt;Find out where the customers want to go, it's a good 40 minute drive away

&gt;My poor car's suspension

&gt;Before I can start conversation with them, the hamplanet pipes up again

&gt;""You know, my size wouldn't be an issue if you had a normal sized car""

&gt;It's a 2010 Skoda Octavia (basically a VW Jetta). It's a good sized car

[Like this but mine has a nicer stereo](http://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2009/03/15/13/13/2008_skoda_octavia-pic-43062.jpeg)

&gt;""This car is plenty big enough for every other job I've done since I bought it""

&gt;She replies ""No, this front seat is much too small""

&gt;""So why not sit in the back, it's big enough for 3 adults?""

&gt;I see the rage building, let's rustle her jimmies

&gt;She snaps back ""What are you trying to say? that I'm fat?""

&gt;""That's not my judgement to make, but if you think a seat is too small, then choose a bigger seat, it's simple""

&gt;She comes back with ""No! I should be able to sit in whatever seat I like, it's not my fault you haven't got a car good enough to handle a real woman""

&gt;""Real woman? How do you figure?""

&gt;She says, ""real as in, I'm happy with my size, I'm not changing for anyone""

&gt;Ohright.mp3

FatLogic^TM

&gt;Conversation is relatively uneventful until we get to the destination

&gt;She pays, gives me a tip because it was a smooth ride apparently

&gt;She gets out, goes to her house

&gt;I go to drive off, and notice the centre console

&gt;The energy drink has gone

WTF

Did it get trapped in her bulk?

hahahaha^ha you guys thought it was really over this time?^ha So did I, again.^haha


So this morning I was checking the mail and there were a letter to me, I go inside and open it, what do I find? Another love letter, the gist of it is, ""please take me back, I'll do anything! I know I've acted a bit crazy, but that was because I love you, and I know you love me. But those whores Miranda and Jessica have filled your head with lies and been manipulating you! I know you love me, and to prove it I've included some sexy pictures of me""

It wasn't that short, it was both sides of an A4 long

Anyway, you're probably wonder about the pictures? Yeah I wouldn't if I were you. I've been scarred people, you wouldn't believe the shit I've seen, there were about 40 of them. The next more disturbing than any of the others I pulled out.

[One was like this](http://www.scenicreflections.com/ithumbs/Sexy%20Pose%20Wallpaper__yvt2.jpg) but think reaaaallyy fat and unattractive

[One looked a lot like this](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/002/a/4/juicy_in_sexy_pose_by_xxxxd_fxxxx-d5q4mbz.jpg)

In a few, she was eating some food in a ""sexy"" way. Room was really filthy, it had like candy wrappers everywhere, donken bags, MAX bags, sibylla bags, and one Burger King bag. [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhl8iZMzK1qanohb.jpg) I saw the BK bag, the closest BK is like 2-3 hours away.

Anyway, I went straight over to their house, everything in hand. The mother opened, she sighed under her breath ""you fucking liar"" Guess that means the mother is as crazy as the daughter eh? So I demand to speak with everyone present, luckily everyone was home. We gather in the kitchen, the rest of the house was really clean in comparison to the room she took the pictures in. I pull the envelope from my pocket and smirk comes across the mothers face and the daughter practically yells ""DID YOU LIKE THEM! I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE THEM!""

I throw them at the father yelling ""THIS SHIT IS FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE! THE ONLY FUCKING REASON THESE ARE NOT WITH THE FUCKING POLICE IS BECAUSE YOU ARE FUCKING MOVING AND GETTING A PSYCHIATRIST FOR THE LOONY!"" The mother gasps and say ""DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO US LIKE THAT!"" The father picks up the pictures and looks defeated as fuck and shows them to the mother, she says ""It was my idea, I thought it would get this liar to confess!"" The father stunned by this revelation screams out ""WHAT!?"" Before anything else could say, I yell ""IF SHE SENDS ME ANYTHING OR TALKS TO ME OR ANYONE I FUCKING KNOW I'M GOING TO THE FUCKING POLICE, I DON'T FUCKING CARE ANYMORE!""

The father then says ""I'm so sorry, I didn't know about this, we'll stay at an hotel until we can finish moving. She wont bother you again."" The daughter reacts ""Daddy! No! Please!!"" I just fucking storm out of there, slam the door in a fury and go home. Later that night I saw them put suitcases in their cars and drive off.

&gt;Be me, 18yo, 172cm, 70kg of blonde, blue-eyed swedish man

&gt;Be done mowing dat lawn for Jessica 18yo 165cm, 54kg of blonde, blue-eyed swedish girl

&gt;Actually mowing a real grass lawn, not what you guys are thinking. I know what you guys are thinking

&gt;Jessicas mom, Karin 164cm, 60kg, comes home just as I was done and insists I take some money for this invaluable service

&gt;Just as I were leaving The Manatees mom, Siv, 152cm 120kg comes over with her daughter ""The Manatee"" at 150cm and 110kg of beautiful aquatic creature also known as ""sea cows""

&gt;Siv insists I stay as she wants me to hear this as well

&gt;Thinking The Manatee told some awful tale of fake goodness I brace myself

&gt;Siv says The Manatee wants to apologize for yelling and calling Jessica names and for pushing her

&gt;Karin asks if this is true, Jessica lets out a measly ""yea""

&gt;What

&gt;She told the truth? Has Thor blessed our lives yet again?

&gt;lol nope

&gt;The Manatee looks really embarassed but don't say anything after a minute Siv chimes in

&gt;""Shes sorry that she yelled and called you names. And for pushing you""

&gt;""Isn't that right sweetie?"" The Manatee responds with ""yeah""

&gt;Siv continues, ""But you kinda were asking for it, touching my daughters boyfriend (while looking at me) inappropriately and trying to steal him away""

&gt;""You should try to get your own boyfriend""

&gt;lol wat

&gt;[Jessicas and Karins FW](http://bc.images.trb.com/media/photo/2009-01/44614688.jpg)

&gt;""Now come on Ploggy, I made lunch, you and The Manatee can talk about setting boundries to other girls when it comes to touching""

&gt;The Manatee goes in to grab my arm and drag me away to Niflheim

&gt;I pull back, saying I'm not The Manatees boyfriend, never were, never will be, not even if she was the last female on the planet

&gt;""Don't be silly, The Manatee have already told me that you've had sex and have been chatting all week on the internets""

&gt;She says something that can only be translated to ""the internets"", also why would tell your mother you've had sex with anyone let alone me

&gt;At this point Jessica chimes in saying ""That's not how it happened""

&gt;Jessica says ""The Manatee did yell, call me names and push me. But she also threatened to kill me if I ever looked at Ploggy again, I was just being friendly and your daughter had a psychotic break. And I know for a a fact that Ploggy is not her boyfriend as when your daughter had her psychotic break and threatened me he told her to leave and never talk to either of us again""

&gt;Siv yells ""Are you calling my daughter a liar!? ~~I'll have you know that both my daughter and I graduated at the top of our class in eating school with over 300 confirmed curves....~~""

&gt;Jessica whimpers out a ""No"" and looks ready to cry

&gt;""Didn't think so! All you skinny sluts do is lie to get a man you otherwise couldn't get! You dont have to lie just because Ploggy likes woman with some meat on her and not your boney ass!""

&gt;I see tears ready to form in Jessica eyes and a smirk on The Manatees fat face

&gt;I step in saying ""What Jessica said is how it happened. And yes I am calling your daughter a liar""

&gt;The Manatee in shock says ""But baby that's not how it happaned what kind of lies has she filled in your head? Lets go home have a *snack* and talk about this.""

&gt;I say ""No, now leave!""

&gt;The Manatee roars out ""WHAT KIND OF LIES DID YOU TELL HIM YOU WHORE!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO TURN HIM AGAINST ME!?

&gt;And she lets out a desperate plea ""Come on Ploggy, lets go. Maybe you'll get lucky later too. *wink* *wink*""

&gt;I say again no and point to their house and yet again say leave.

&gt;This time The Manatee roars out ""YOU FUCKING WHORE!"" And ~~lunges~~ waddles at quicker pace than normal at Jessica

&gt;I push The Manatee which can best be described by this [gif](http://i.imgur.com/QxIY8.gif)

&gt;Siv as a look of shock on her face and quickly ~~rushes~~ waddles over to help her daughter

&gt;They quickly leave and say we should expect to hear from their lawyers

&gt;I look over at Jessica and she seems really frightend and I look at Karin who has this face that can only be described with ""Is this really happening? Is this real life?""

&gt;I say I'm sorry and quickly retreat to my house

Later when Karins husband came home they invited my parents over for their house for a drink. Don't know if they told my parents about this and when they came back they said nothing to me about it.

Haha! You thought this story was over didn't you? So did fucking I....

&gt;Be me later that evening

1373414666.0	1hz02p	There is always hope	Threecheers4me	622	114	31	"So I live in a fairly quiet suburban neighborhood, and often times there are runners going up and down the sidewalks. Your average group is a mix of hardcore cardio nuts, the speed walking stay at home moms, and shirtless 20 somethings. One day however, that changed. 

Among the ranks there was a new face, a face that was flabby, sweaty and tired. He was a middle aged man who was probably in the upper-middle end of the 200 pound range. There was nothing spectacular about his size, but what was spectacular was his persistence. Every time I went out, there he would be, marching forward with gritted teeth and a soaked shirt. Never skipping days, never taking breaks, never slowing down. He always had the same look on his face, a determined stare that would make the Buckingham Palace Guards back down. Every step was a battle, and he was winning all the time.

 As he walked and walked, he began to shrink, and he even gathered company. He was soon accompanied by overweight his wife and son on these nightly walks, both of whom shrunk along with him. He saved himself and his family from a short life of obstacles, sickness and sadness. He made it, they made it."	t5_2vzax	True
1371411568.0	1ggxif	Hamplanet Brother fakes doing things at the gym.	UlyssesTheSloth	607	99	96	"A couple things about my brother; two hundred and sixty four pounds at the ripe age of seventeen, can not run to save his god damn life, and has this superiority complex revolving around personal achievement. He has no drive or motivation to lose weight or build muscle, he would rather spend his time sitting on his bed and play on his phone. He likes to constantly make fun of the fact that I weigh literally a little more than half his weight, and the fact that I am thinner than everyone in my family. Let's begin, shall we? Here is the time my brother tried to go to the gym, but failed.

&gt;Just saw Man of Steel, moderately motivated me to work harder at the gym, run faster and longer.

&gt;Decide to hit the gym after movie.

&gt;Brother decides that he wants to tag along with me

Here's where his 'superiority' kicks in. He must try to physically be better than everyone, in every way. This is the same guy who's said that he could ""TOTALLY TAKE ON A MALE TIGER.""

&gt;We get down to the gym, I get to the treadmills and get a moderate pace of six miles per hour.

&gt;My brother, trying to be better than me at running, decides to kick it in eight miles per hour, complaining about ""it's so easy.""

&gt;Decide enough is enough, put it on eight point five and jog the rest of the half hour.

&gt;Brother has to stop at a quarter mile, getting on and off ever minute to catch his breath, not before he makes several excuses on why he can't run; ""My shorts kept falling down!"" ""I ate before I came here!"" And i shit you not: ""the treadmill is broken.""

A thing about the gym. It's literally right in my apartment complex, it's a short two minute walk to get to it.

&gt;Anyways, after finally being able to run a mile, he gets off, stating that he just MUST have water. So for literally nine minutes, he stays in the bathroom getting 'water.'

&gt;Decide to head home after running for thirty minutes, jog the rest of the short walk home.



&gt;Get back to my house, rinsed off and changed within four minutes.

&gt;He comes in just as i'm putting my shirt on, drenched in 'sweat.' 

&gt;Truth was, he was in the bathroom pouring water on his shirt to make it look like he did something. There's literally no fucking way the entirety of three minutes after I left the gym that he could have possibly ran so fast that he was drowning in sweat. Despite the fact that he had no foul smell, and his shirt had no distinctive mark. It felt and smelt like fabric with water poured upon it.

&gt;He then proceeds to gloat about how he ran four miles in the time I was heading home and showering.

&gt;my parents congratulate him for his 'hardwork,' to which they then proceed to make fun of me because 'I don't even nearly workout as much as him.'

That comment really rustled my jimmies. My entire life, I was made fun of because of my stature and build. I am working out everyday, running several miles and doing several sets of bodyweight workouts JUST to show them that I was sick of their shit, that I was the one that made a major change with my life, I work really hard every day just to push myself forward, because I didn't ever wanna be the kid that was weak, small and slow ever again. I was tired of myself, so I did something about it, lost thirty pounds without the help of anyone. I got no 'Hey Ulysses, I'm proud of you' from my father. But fuck-all, my brother gets congratulated for some bullshit achievement that he barely did jack shit for. Just because he's fat.

&gt;Brother brags about how he was 'faster,' 'more endurable,' and 'physically fit' than I was.

&gt;All I could do is nod and say 'yeah. Sure. Okay'

&gt;my progress still goes unnoticed.

He does this shit every time we visit a gym, for an added note

1375928011.0	1jxfp3	The time I learned Wicca was a religion for hamplanets, and that Aphrodite is obese. Prepare to be religiously educated, FPS.	pipluppop	628	124	214	"So the last story I gave you was really sad and awful, and the cancer thing pissed me off hard, so I'm writing a funny (but still kinda annoying, come on, its fps)  one for you all :3

This one needs a little introduction for the story to make sense, so please bear with me. 

I have literally no opinions on the religion anyone chooses to have (or not have in the case of atheism) if you're keeping it mainly to yourself and you extend the same courtesy to me, it matters as much to me as the colour of your hair. I have an extremely complex ""religion"" (its not really a religion but idk the word in english, please give me one in comments x.x) that I have been raised with, that has been in my family for generations. 

It's pretty much a mixture of shamanism, spirituality and a belief that all gods may exist. It's a kind of paganism, but more like Buddhism in that it's more a ""way of life"" kinda thing than a dogma thing. I've been to various ""schools"" where I have been taught about shamanistic healing, witch doctoring and all sorts of things. It's far less interesting than it sounds, its pretty much making crazy teas and pounding up herbs with a big rock. I love it, it's what I believe, and I'm always prepared to answer questions. With me so far? 

Sadly my beliefs attract the spiritual equivalent of weaboos, who think it's dark and mysterious, that it's the same as doing harry potter style spells or wicca (it isn't) and it makes them uber gawfik if they say it's their religion too. Yay. 

ANYWAY I KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS CRAZY but it's central to the story. Which is starting now. Thanks for your patience! 

This takes place about 3 months after the last story was set. 

&gt;Be me. Piplup, little Spaniard, 16, still in the UK. small, have eating disorder. 

&gt; NotBe Hammah. BFF at the time, loud, extremely slutty, mega goth. Really fat, probably about 270 but kinda looks more. 

Her fashion style consists of tank tops in EXTREMELY TOO SMALL sizes, so the fupa hangs out below, and black skinny jeans that fit below her fupa, so half her ass is always on show. Basically because she shops at ""goth stores"" (like hot topic i guess) and she wants to be small and teeny and cute. 

&gt;be at my house trying to finish group project

&gt;Hamma bouncing up and down on my bed while I try to work.

&gt; ""PIPLUP I'M BOOOOOORED""

I know how to handle this. 

&gt;""Go look in the fridge for something to eat"" 

The fridge had beetus juices and candy I had prepared earlier. I am becoming quite the ham wrangler. 

Hammah comes back, and my bed (ikea quality) groans sadly as she throws herself down on it, and proceeds to LIE DOWN and drink from a 2l bottle of coke. Wat. 

&gt;""PIPLUUUUUP are there any guys you like at school teehee"" 

&gt;""No."" 

&gt;""But &gt;Insert underage victim one&lt; totally thinks I'm hot and he's so emoooo"" 

Hammah had previously gotten in to shit for having sex with a 14 year old. This guy was 13. 

&gt;""He's too young for you.

&gt;""Piplup you're STUPID, girls can't be pedophiles""

wat

&gt;""and ANYWAY piplup men can't resist me, they look at my boobs and well, men like boobs""

&gt;""I know men like boobs Hammah"" 

Do I really need to tell you how this continued? HAES bullshit, how she's irresistable, how she's had sex with a 27 year old (who actually turned out to be a real pedophile, he's now on some pedophile hunting site) how older men know ""what they're doing"". How I need to eat more, how my undereating ""makes her feel fat"". UGH. 

She starts rifiling through my books and various god statues. 

&gt;""I didn't know you believed in GODS Piplup, you're just like a Catholic"" 

wat2. 

She sees my statue of Sakhmet. She has a lion's head and it's made to look ancient Egyptian. 

&gt;""WELL OF COURSE YOU LIKE THIS ONE, IS SHE THE GODDESS OF ANOREXIA?"" 

Literally throws my statue to the floor. That disrespect. PleaseThorStrikeHerDown. Bitch I will spit in your eyes. I manage to keep my cool however. 

&gt;""she's actually more like a war goddess"" 

AND THE GODDESS OF VENGEANCE YOU FAT BITCH. 

Hamplanet not listening, hamplanet has chance to talk about how fat people are superior in every way. 

&gt;""THAT STATUE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. ANCIENT PEOPLE THOUGHT FAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. SKINNY PEOPLE LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE JUST DIED"" 

Idon'teven. 

&gt;""DON'T YOU HAVE ANY REAAAAL WOMEN TO WORSHIP"" 

Bitch this is my religion not a fat activism party. 

Hammah finally gets her fucking laptop out, now I've finished all the work. Is she busy finalizing it? Oh no, she's opened google. Is she really searching for that? What the? 

So I don't remember it word for word but she literally searched for ""goddesses for fat women"" or some shit. What the everliving fuck. But ok, I love religious debate and opinion, so slightly interested as to what the search will yield. First site. 

""Artists interpretations of Aphrodite show her as a plus size, beautiful woman. She is a symbol of beauty and real women"" 

&gt;""OHHH MYYY GODDD PIPLUP SEE. SEE. PLUS SIZE MEANS OBESE. YOU HAVE TO TEACH ME MORE ABOUT YOUR RELIGION BECAUSE FAT WORSHIP IS IMPORTANT"" 

Yeah guys [the very picture of obesity](http://www.theoi.com/image/S10.1Aphrodite.jpg)

&gt;""That's not really what it's about Hammah"" 

&gt;YOU'RE SO SELFISH. ITS NOT MY FAULT MY FAMILY GAVE ME A FAT HATING RELIGION"" 

Apparently Christianity is ""fat hating"" I have no idea so I had no argument. 

She actually looks like she might cry. Sigh. Why do I care. 

&gt;""No Hammah, I didn't mean that... I just.. want you to understand it better. Here borrow this""

I hand her a book which has a detailed description of a few of the more ""popular"" gods. And some notebooks and stuff I have from the school. I pretty much am morally and spiritually obligated to share what I know if people ask, so I did. 

A few days later, I receive a facebook message from Hammah. I can boil it down to this. 

""Omg piplup, I did some research and you should know that your religion is called WICCA. It's a religion for fat beautiful women. Its all about praising what nature gave me, the goddess GAIA has blessed me with a beautiful body, and I can FINALLY be confident. Maybe if you REALLY believe in your religion, you should stop trying to starve yourself and stop wearing so much makeup. NATURAL is better. 

Anyway I found some spells I want to try in this wicca bible i found online, so we have to hang out this weekend""

So at that point the blood vessel in my temple exploded and I died. 

I wish. 

To you non religious people, I will now attempt to explain how fucking annoying that was. Imagine that one thing you've loved since you were a kid. A game, a movie, a TV show, that you freaking loved, and knew all the ins and outs of. It meant something to you, and to this day it still hits you with that beautiful, all consuming rush of warm nostalgia. 

Ok now imagine that a fat beast has taken it, thrown it on the ground and tells you that you have NEVER understood it, they know how good it REALLY is and how you'll never be able to love it, or be as much of a fan of it as they are, and they've only known about it for a whole weekend! Teehee! Oh and also NOTHING YOU CAN EVER SAY WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND. 


So. Obviously I have loads of stories about Hammah's new found religion, but I will draw this tale to a close with one of the most extreme. 

There's a hippy/alt/green faire held round here. I always go because I know people who do, and shamans go through a lot of incense. Because Hammah is a devout wiccan now, she comes along too. 

(oh did i mention that she bought a magic wand and a pentagram necklace? cos she did, and she brought the wand with her).

At the incense store, I bump in to a friendly asian guy and spill my Nag Champa on him. 

&gt;""sorry but at least you smell nice!"" 

socialfailure.exe

Nice guy actually laughs (call him Orange from now on cos thats the colour he was wearing). I SEE HE HAS AN ANUBIS TATTOO. I LOVE THAT GOD. 

&gt;strike up awesome conversation about Kemetic gods. Shit is cash. 

&gt;decide to get some food, 

&gt;have lost Hammah because she's trying to envelop random men in her folds. 

Oh no wait here she is. I forgot that food was involved. 

It dawns on me that Orange is ""alternative"" AND Asian. He is now prime meat in Hammah's eyes. 

I'm so sorry Orange what have I done to you. :( 

So yeah, Hammah sits on his lap and starts eating out of his food carton. 

""HEY I'M PIPLUPS BEST FRIEND, WAS SHE TELLING YOU ABOUT OUR RELIGION"" 

nooooooo :( 

&gt;Orange ""oh! yeah *gasping for breath* I'm interested in some of the gods myself"" 

&gt;""HOW ABOUT APHRODITE DO YOU LIKE HER"" 

&gt;orange -""Oh, I don't know much about greek gods....""

&gt;""WELL I'M EXACTLY LIKE APHRODITE, I COULD EDUCATE YOU teehee"" 

It's so cringeworthy at this point that I kinda want to just bail and leave Orange to fend for himself, but I can't do that. While I formulate a plan, Orange is trying to politely deflect Hammah. But she's like, kissing his shoulder, telling him how she LOOOVES tattoos, and asking him if he would like to see her naked so he could tell her the best place for a tattoo. 

I sort of regret doing this, because it was pretty mean but it was the only way I could think of to defend orange at the time. I call her out.

&gt;""Oh Hammah stop it, you've only known about this religion for a week, so don't try to lecture people on it yet. You look nothing like Aphrodite, for a start, Aphrodite didn't have a muffin top."" 

This was a huge shock for her. I have never stepped in or ""cockblocked"" her before. But I was getting pretty tired. Guys, she just seemed kinda hurt by my words, but then looked me dead in the eye and said. 

""You're just jealous"". 

Up to this point Orange had been silent. And what he said was so simple, but freaking awesome. 

""I bet if Piplup was sat on my lap I could still feel my legs though"". 

3. 2. 1.

MELTDOWN. 

""I BET YOU'D LOVE THAT WOULDN'T YOU. WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER, I JUST NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD HATES ME BECAUSE I'M FAT. I CAN'T EVEN GIVE A GUY WHAT HE WANTS WITHOUT SOME SKINNY BITCH GETTING IN THE WAY"" 

She bent down, I feared what would happen next. I heard a ripping sound. 

Guys she threw grass in my face. It was hilarious, the grass sort of hit the wind and fell on my legs. And I laughed. And I couldn't stop laughing. And she stormed away. I didn't hear anything from her for a few weeks and then I got another message about how her wolf spirit had come to see her in her dreams and I needed to explain that to her. 

tl;dr fatty creates her own HAES religion and throws grass in my eyes while i save an asian from giving her tattoo advice.

Shamalan) [Kinda NSFL]	ConfectionAffection	621	116	108	"[Part I]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3diw/the_long_awaited_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_i_muh_muhs/)  [Part II]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1h57yk/the_much_anticipated_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_ii_muh/)  [Part III]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1h96p8/muh_muhs_odyssey_part_iii_from_beetus_to_worse/)  [Part IV]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i5u5g/muh_muhs_odyssey_part_iv_enter_the_wildebeetus/)

I spelled Shyamalan wrong, sorry!

Warning: even for my standards, this is absurdly long and it’s not going to be funny, it’s not meant to be.

FPS, we have a few things to discuss in this epilogue. I’ve been wanting to write this for some time, in order to clarify a few things and get a few things off my chest. Just so you know, only one section of this epilogue is NSFL and it is a compendium of sorts of the details about Muh Muh that I left out because this isn’t [r/WTF](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/), but a few people requested so I will deliver. If you are looking for inspiration to get healthy, this might be a good read. First read the other parts linked above so you know who I’m talking about, if you haven't already. 

There are also two plot twists in this epilogue, and if you like the Muh Muh story just as it was and don’t want to know more about Muh Muh beyond the caricature I created of her in the previous installments, this epilogue is not for you.

**What Happened to the Kids**

Since I didn’t spell it out in the story, the answer is, yes, they left the kids. Daughtermoon was hiding, and we the employees forgot about her too in the commotion. Something I didn’t mention in the story is that although the Wildebeetus was crazy and mean and vulgar, it became apparent by his body language and the constant reddening of his face (which I didn’t put in the story) that he was embarrassed by this situation.

When you think about, how could he not be? Here are all these young, college kids looking at his disgusting whale of a wife who’s made an ass of herself. I would’ve been embarrassed too. Suffice it to say, he was in a big hurry to leave that store.

So, immediately after we realized they left the kids, we three (Tiff , GHB, and myself) went and found Daughtermoon and the baby and took them to Flabby Patty’s disgusting, litter-filled cave (to make them feel at home), whereupon the Wildebeest was redialed. He yelled at my manager again, saying his step daughter would there to pick up Daughtermoon and *the step daughter’s baby.* He couldn’t come get them because he had to take Muh Muh to the hospital directly after they left. Plot twist #1 is that the baby was not, in fact, Muh Muh’s baby, it was her grandchild.

As my coworkers conjectured on what kind of hambeast would appear to collect her (half) sister and child, a small knot of anxiety began building in my chest, not so much in fear as in dread. I knew beforehand that the older daughter was not a hambeast, she was a nice, quiet, and only slightly overweight woman. I didn’t tell my coworkers that I knew this or how I knew this, and never did. Sure enough, she walked in and we locked eyes, any trace of doubt was erased from my mind at that point. She turned away, and didn’t look in my direction again clearly dying with embarrassment. I knew her. 

One bright spot is that Daughtermoon was ecstatic to see her half-sister, who was quite loving to Daughtermoon and cooed over the baby as a mother should. I felt slightly better knowing that those kids at least had one person in their lives who would take care of them and show them love.

**Musings on Muh Muh**

Let’s first discuss Muh Muh’s entrance, and preface with [a picture for reference]( http://www.yourblackworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/826bpauline-potter.jpeg.jpg). This is an approximation of Muh Muh, but she had more weight in her arms and her face. From the pictures online, I would estimate her weight to be between 600-650lbs, slightly less than what I originally estimated in Part I. The difference is Muh Muh was older than this woman, and also smoked like a chimney so she did not have this woman’s skin tone. Muh Muh’s fat was more rolls and layers. However, the woman in the picture has legs that were very similar in shape to Muh Muh’s, and with that image let me list a few things not mentioned in the story. Engage NSFL.

I mentioned Muh Muh had sores. She had many, in fact, and more on one leg and foot than the other. For you non medically inclined folks who’ve never had the privilege to see a diabetic sore, [here’s the closest approximation]( http://archive.ispub.com/journal/the-internet-journal-of-dermatology/volume-1-number-2/diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers.article-g05.ns.jpg) I could find to the leg sores Muh Muh had. And [don’t forget the feet]( http://archive.ispub.com/journal/the-internet-journal-of-dermatology/volume-1-number-2/diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers.article-g06.ns.jpg), which were worse. Muh Muh’s sores were glistening too, actively oozing interstitial fluids and pus, as diabeetus sores are wont to do. 

If you don’t know, uncontrolled diabeetus and excess weight are a double whammy of blood vessel destruction, which causes the sores, but when this lack of circulation gets bad enough, whole bits of tissue begin to die completely and necrose. Muh Muh had a grand total of one toenail (the big one on her “good” foot), and the two of her toes on the bad foot were nearly black. Google it if you’re curious, I don’t even want to see the pictures of dead toes—one real life experience was enough for me.

Another observation that was revolting beyond belief and one that I noticed upon her entrance was the spots. I’m not gonna pussyfoot around this, there were brown spots on the rear end of her faded purple sweatpants of varying sizes and locations. They overlapped like some kind of perverse venn diagram of all the overlapping traits of the bad decisions Muh Muh had ever made. When Muh Muh was hoisted from the cart, there was a new spot—one spot to ~~rule~~ overlap them all. Likely during her puking episode, Muh Muh had shit herself. No one wanted to touch that cart, as it had a big wet spot in the middle that smelled… well, you know.

Speaking of, you might be wondering about this woman’s smell. Reddit, it was indescribable. Shit and vomit are unpleasant smells, mix in BO and unpleasant odors wafting from her luscious curves and you get a truly horrendous smell. But those smells were practically perfume compared to the distinct olfactory affronts of gangrenous tissue (dead, rotting tissue aka tissue with gangrene). Don’t ask me how I already knew how that smelled already, but I did. It is a smell you don’t forget, disgusting beyond belief but with a perverse sweetness to it. I’m gagging, I have to stop. End NSFL.

I know definitively that Muh Muh would not have made it out of the house *without* her extreme state of inebriation. A combination of an extreme alcohol addiction and “drunk strength” apparently allowed her to make it into the car from her house, and from the car to the scooter.

**The Damages**

Ms. BB was fired almost immediately after the police report and internal incident report were filed. Yes, a customer had called the police upon hearing the shouting and seeing the disaster zone. No charges were pressed on any front, and the police left. BB was fired because it was company policy that she had to call 911 in the presence of an obviously sick customer regardless of their requests, which she chose not to do, likely from extreme apathy. She also demanded the “fucking Mexicans” clean up the mess (which they began to do) despite warnings that it was a biohazard mess. Flabby Patty eventually put his foot down, and the janitors put some absorbent material over the mess, roped it off and left it until the wee hours the next day when a biohazard disposal team came and finished the job. Her insistence that they clean it up, however, was witnessed by many and this was another big no-no. 

One the biohazard cleanup was finished, there was a huge stain left over. The wine/vomit mixture had eaten away the waxy material on the floor tiles, making it textured and absorbent. The wax had to be sanded off and replaced. Furthermore, in an extreme effort to make it look like we were biohazard safe, every bit of merchandise that had even a speck of red on it was to be thrown away. Much of this liquor (some was quite expensive) and craft beer really had little to no stains on it, and much of it ended up in GHB’s and my cars via “operation drunken eagle.” 

The wine splatter went up to the top shelves even, this amounted to well over a thousand dollars in written off merchandise.

After all was said and done, the smell still lingered. It’s got so bad customers started to complain, and we all knew where it was coming from. That shit got under the shelving units. So about a week later, we moved all the merchandise off about a total of six, 20ft sections of shelf that were unbolted from the floor, cleaned again using biohazard procedures, sanded, rewaxed, etc.

The cleanup (including sanding and resealing), the write offs, the replacement cart, the teams hired to move the shelves, a second cleanup with sanding etc., and employee labor all coalesced onto an incident report for a figure well over $15 thousand (the cart alone was over $3,000). I know this because I took Ms. BB’s place after she got fired, and had access to all the info. Granted, these reports were sometimes bloated for tax purposes or some shit, but still. It was pricey.

**My Big Secret**

I tried to make it as non-obvious as possible because I fuckin’ love a plot twist, but I’ve been nearly exploding with this secret. I alluded above that I knew Muh Muh’s child, in fact I knew her quite well. I wonder if any of you can surmise how?

The truth is I thought Muh Muh looked familiar when she lumbered in, but I thought no, it couldn’t be her. Then I spotted Daughtermoon and her blond ringlets and I knew it right there, but I didn’t let myself believe it. I had to get a closer look, no small part of why I was observing her (wasn’t just random curiosity). 

I counted on my fingers how many years it had been since I’d seen her last, I guessed at least 4. And I had been hearing rumors of her exponential expansion and health problems. If you aren’t guessing it by now, I’ll give you a hint. When I was a kid, I played with the older daughter that came in to pick up Daughtermoon and the baby, in fact I wrote about it in a previous story. I dubbed her Side O’ Ham. That’s right Reddit, on that fateful, stormy night, I witnessed by dearest Auntie Ham walk into my ‘Mart—about 250 lbs heavier than when last I saw her in [Auntie Ham’s Brush with Death]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dvoo0/auntie_hams_brush_with_death/). She never realized it was me.

**What Happened to Muh Muh**

The last thing I will inform you all about, in case your curiosity is piqued, is what happened to the now-dubbed Auntie Hamuh Muh. Her sociopath, weird-ass sister speaks to my granny on a regular basis, and is a terrible gossip. Plus my granny was a nurse still at that point, and regularly went to visit Auntie Hamuh Muh, and granny filled me and my family in on all the details as they happened.

My Auntie went to the hospital that night, complaining of extreme pain in her stomach. Initial diagnoses spotted she was anemic (because she was bleeding out of her stomach and intestines), was in insulin shock with extremely *low* blood shugar, and had a number of nutrient deficiencies (the irony!) That was all they could determine and it was from blood work, because they had no machines to handle her girth—no ultrasound would go deep enough to view her organs, the various machines would not fit her (small, local hospitals don’t have much). 

She was taken immediately to a larger hospital in a larger town about an hour away, and was diagnosed in quick order with a massive infection in her bad foot. She had sepsis (bacteria and bacterial toxins in the blood), which was causing her “dementia” aka her crazy bitch syndrome. It was determined the leg would likely have to go, but first medication was given to heal the ulcers in her stomach and was put on a liquid diet. Massive amounts of blood were transfused, along with massive doses of extremely powerful antibiotics. At the same time, she was also going into a double whammy of withdrawals from no alcohol or cigarettes, and to hear her sister tell it “it was a good thing she couldn’t get outta bed or she would’ve murdered all the hospital workers!”

She lost something like 40 lbs in the next week, but the infection persisted as the antibiotics could not penetrate her leg due to lack of circulation. Her bad toes were removed in short order, but it was soon determined that the leg had to go and it was removed above her knee. The infection was still in her thigh, so a few days later, most of her thigh was removed. I cannot imagine the logistics of such an operation, and we all knew that her chances of making it through these procedures alive were slim, but it seemed there was no choice. Somehow, the tough old bitch made it through, though, thanks Medicaid!

Eventually Auntie Hamuh Muh left the hospital with a prosthetic leg and about 250 lbs lighter (including the lost leg). In the absence of cigarettes and alcohol, and with an actual brush with death came a bout of depression, and she lost another hundred or so pounds over the next year. I actually saw her walking outside on her prosthetic leg to get the mail once, she walked better with that than she did with her actual leg that night I saw her in the ‘Mart. Then she was forgotten after a time, as she remained a recluse when she was no longer an interesting source of gossip for her sister. I haven’t seen her other than from a distance since that incident at the ‘Mart 5 years ago. 

I would like to tell you she somehow made it. That she continued to lose weight, became a better parent, began exercising, and got a job. But I can’t, because none of those things happened. The only silver lining is that the mentally unstable, abusive Wildebeetus left her just before she was released from the hospital. I have two more stories at least about Auntie Hamuh Muh told from the perspective of my granny and my mom that happened recently, so the good news is you fatties get more Muh Muh, just in an altered form. I said it when I first started writing here, I joined FPS to tell you about this creature. All my other stories are fluff pieces to this train wreck of a woman. She is the quintessential hamplanet, and if you all are still interested and if you’ve managed to read this far, then let me assure you that you will get moar Auntie Hamuh Muh.

Final thought: Healthy at Every Size my ass.

1373073167.0	1hq385	Cool Whip is healthy! Part 3	Ishityounotman	629	129	152	"Hello! Did you all miss me? This story may rattle and soothe your jimmies at the same time. I will post a TL;DR at the end.

So I talked to the little girl's mother, the one who got her cookies stolen. I tried to keep it casual. She was the to pick up her daughter early that day, during lunch time.

Me 'Hey! You're Sarah's mom right?'

SM (Sarah's mom. She's one of those soccer moms. Pretty, but she means business) 'Yes. Has Sarah been behaving?'

Me 'Yes she's been wonderful! But I wanted to ask you, did you send Sarah cookies on Monday?'

SM'Yes. She mentioned she didn't get them though. Did another child take them? If they did it's not big deal, they're just cookies.'

Me 'Well, no. I actually witnessed the teacher assistant take them and eat them when your daughter was not looking.'

SM 'What the hell? Pardon my language but what the hell is wrong with her? Is she eating Cool Whip? Did you report her?'

Me 'Yes and yes. The director accused me of lying. The director is actually related to the teacher assistant.'

SM turned and stalked down the hall, with Sarah running behind. She wrenched open the director's door and proceeded to give the director a piece of her mind. After a few minutes, she left the office and walked off down the hall. I had no idea where she was going, but I shrugged it off.

The director called me to her office, where she was still shell-shocked. She told me to not speak to any of the parents anymore. I asked her why and she told be to shut up and get back to work. I told her 'Ma'am, I intend to act in the best interest of the children since you don't seem to be.'

'Excuse me?!' She gaped at me.

'I didn't stutter.'

At this point, I don't really care about getting fired because it's a minimum wage job.

So I went back to class, where SM is standing in front of FAT.

'Did you take my daughter's cookies?'

'N-n-no.'

'Did. You. Take. My. Daughter's. Cookies.'

'Well, I uh. Um well.... Did Ishityounotman tell you that?'

'That's irrelevant. Just like you. But DID YOU TAKE THE COOKIES?'

She's crying at this point. 'Yes. Okay? YES! Leave me alone! She didn't need them! I need the sugar! I didn't have lunch!'

'No, you had two tubs of Cool Whip to keep you company.' I piped up.

'If you touch my daughter's food again, I'm going to do everything in my power to get you fired. Do you understand me? I said DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!'

She nodded, tears of Sprite and burger grease dripping down her face.

I smiled at her very sweetly as SM walked away. 

But the war is not over, only a battle won, for she said to me, and exactly this

'You will regret this. So much.'


TL;DR : A soccer mom stands up to FAT, yells at director, and avenges the death of her daughter's cookies. FAT is not done with me though...

1371212371.0	1gc0oh	Fat2Fit: Moon falls in love with ballerina, decides to become human	sgjkbd	599	97	34	"First off, 79 on my first-ever posting? If you guys keep spoiling me like this, I'm gunna develop dat beetus^teehee. 

Yesterday's post was a mere 2000 calorie appetizer to today's 10-course meal of how I narrowly avoided becoming a hamplanet myself.

This is the story of how I disenrolled myself from self-imposed hamplanet training for the sake of love. If you want to know how it ends, skip to the tl;dr. 

It's a long-un, so make sure you have your 2-liters of soft drinks (you know, to make sure your blood sugar doesn't get too high). 

Here goes:

&gt;Be me in middle school. 

&gt;I wasn't a hamplanet, but I'm pretty sure NASA sent me a letter saying they were considering officially having me be Earth's second moon.

&gt;No fatlogic with me. Dad was paramedic and even tested my blood sugar before and after a big meal, and there was BARELY any change.

&gt;No beetus, thighroid, or other excuses. Just a lot of food, no exercise, and a complete lack of motivation to do... anything.

&gt;Wherever I went, people hid their children for fear I might eat them (I might have). Compasses and GPSs failed in my general proximity because a north pole was starting to form underneath my naval.

&gt;You don't want to know where the south pole was. 

&gt;Go to church one evening for reasons I forget. 

&gt;See an octopus on the church floor.

&gt;""That's odd, why would someone put an octopus on the floor like this?""

&gt;Octopus slowly untangles itself to reveal its true form.

Here's where it takes the opposite tone of your typical FPS.

&gt;All of a sudden, birds start chirping.

&gt;Rays of sunshine start shining despite the fact that we were indoors.

&gt;I hear a heavenly choir singing.

&gt;Octopus reveals its true form to be O, a beautiful young ballerina who was stretching before a rehearsal. 

&gt;Blonde, pale, skinny, more beautiful than Nina Sayers.

&gt;I get hit in the face with her beauty without any chance to prepare myself.

&gt;My jimmies were not ready for this. 

&gt;loveatfirstsight.exe

&gt;THERE'S THAT MOTIVATION I WAS LOOKING FOR

&gt;Resolve to change.

&gt;Join middle school track team to throw (alwayslast.weak)

&gt;Need more than that to undo years of hamplanet training

&gt;Resolve to join high school's wrestling team when that time rolls (teehee) around. 

&gt;That fall

&gt;Get weighed

&gt;199 pounds

&gt;Ouch.shame

&gt;Get sports physical

&gt;Look at BMI chart

&gt;Find myself on the ""obese"" area of the chart

&gt;sadness.jpg

&gt;moarmotivation.letsdothis

&gt;Do off-season wrestling weight-lifting workouts

&gt;Basically, a four-day-a-week crappy bodybuilding routine, but it was the best I had at the time. 

&gt;Decide to run on top of that.

&gt;Can't run (read: barely jog) more than 100m at a time.

&gt;Feelsbadman.jpg

&gt;Run with backpack, because I was afraid football team would steal it, because I was afraid they were dicks.

&gt;Football team assumes I am putting rocks in my backpack to train harder, because they are actually super-awesome.

&gt;Every week, slowly increase the amount I run.

&gt;Skip ahead to homecoming

&gt;Run a mile every day

&gt;Feelsgoodman.fuckyeah

&gt;Wrestling season rolls around

&gt;Quit.

&gt;Not because of fatlogic, but because I simply enjoyed the running and weight training almost as much as the hamspanic enjoys pizza and didn't want distractions 

&gt;Keep it up every day. 

&gt;Eventually increase running to 30 minutes

&gt;Track season rolls around

&gt;Join track team again, this time running the 2 mile.

&gt;Weigh 150 pounds.

&gt;1 mile time decreased from 11:45 to sub seven minutes during this time

&gt;cantstopme.motherfucker

&gt;Fast forward to now.

&gt;Never got to date ballerina. :\

&gt;Weigh 191 pounds, most of the gained being muscle

&gt;Wouldntchangeathing.awesome

&gt;Gonna make it you guys

tl;dr: I decide to change my life from being a future hamplanet to getting in shape out of love. Never get that love, but got something better.

1368177296.0	1e25zc	Hamburglar Ruins Dinner For Everyone	Sycamori	603	103	70	"So after an overwhelming success and many positive comments on my [Previous story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dzo6w/hamburglar_makes_a_16_hour_greyhound_bus_ride_hell/) involving Hamburglar, I've decided to continue the horror story that this choir trip held for me.

EDIT: [Final Part Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e47cz/hamburglar_eats_us_out_of_house_and_home_sweet/)

*Our story left off with poor OP getting off the bus and realizing she is billeted in the same house as Hamburglar*

&gt;Get off bus and receive billets, turns out 7 girls (including Hamburglar and I) will be living in our small house

&gt;Only 3 beds

&gt;Ohlawdy.jpg

&gt;Despite being all girls, these women will be known as Smilebro: one of my best friends and hard to upset, Talentbro: Quiet girl, absolute amazing singer, Sportybro: Really athletic Asian girl, Arabro: Arabic girl who is your stereotypical teenage girl, and Koreandramabro: Melodramatic Asian girl in the worst way possible

&gt;Nobody in the house is the least bit fat except for Hamburglar, I'm literally second fattest girl at 5'0'' 115 lbs

&gt;Everyone has to get on the Greyhound again and go out of town for groceries to last us 2 weeks, barely any grocery stores in town and none we can go to by ourselves (being 13-14 year olds)

&gt;Everyone splits up to buy what they want

&gt;We all pick out a mixture of healthy food and total crap, pastas, fruit, pizzas, pretty decent haul

&gt;Everyone going to give me $20 and I'll pay for everyone's groceries on my card, we're all sharing anyways

&gt;Hamburglar laborously waddles over to us with her haul, either out of breath from the leisurely stroll down the aisles or having a panic attack about being in a grocery store full of FOODZ

&gt;Nothing but mountains of crap, literally jars of nutella, pudding, mayo, Munchies, Doritos, Cheesies, soda, a little microwave food, at least $70 worth of pure shit

&gt;""Oh most of this stuff is on sale anyways, I need it for my low blood sugar!""

&gt;throws it all onto the conveyor belt and hands me $20, begins waddling back to the bus

&gt;Fuckingwhatever.mov

&gt;Get home, put stuff away and get ready for bed

&gt;Everyone brushing teeth, Hamburglar in kitchen already drinking the 2L bottles of soda literally from the bottle and feasting on her beloved Cheetos but everyone is too tired to give any fucks

&gt;Tackle the 3 bed, 7 girls problem: 2 beds in the same room upstairs, 1 bed downstairs

&gt;Smilebro and Sportybro share room/bed with Talentbro and Arabro in the other bed, I share bed with Koreandramabro and we cast thy fatty to the Isle of Couchland to repent for her sins

&gt;Hamburglar doesn't even fit on the couch, you can see the many back flaps contorting into positions not meant for humans to achieve in an effort to sleep comfortably

&gt;Koreandramabro doesn't let me get a wink of sleep, we're obviously totally best buds now that we're sharing a bed and discloses personal intimate details of her 14 year old sex life

&gt;Hamburglar's Shamu-Quality sonar hearing picks up on Koreandramabro and comes into the room to discuss her non-existent sexcapades with Wailord

&gt;Actual quote: ""Some days I have dreams of Wailord and I cuddling... I'm in trouble and he just saves me and holds me close to his heart. I know he loves me but I'm waiting until we're married to have sex, I'm worth *so* much.""

&gt;WhyGod.Nope

&gt;Have nightmares that night about rule 34 on Koreandramabro and Hamburglar with Wailord watching from the corner and masturbating

&gt;Worst dream ever

&gt;Morning comes and we all wake up to a messy kitchen. Wrappers everywhere, nutella on the chairs, cheetos crushed into the floor, ugh

&gt;Turns out Hamburglar is the opposite of a Gremlin and must eat as much as possible at night

&gt;Smilebro is making her famous grilled cheese sandwiches for us for breakfast, so heavenly and delicious

&gt;Awyisss.mp3

&gt;Day of choir shit goes by, night time again

&gt;I volunteer to sleep on the Isle of Couchland for the night so I can actually get some sleep, immediately regret this decision after pungent odor reminiscent of microwaved pig snouts rises from the couch, obviously Hamburglar's fat rolls ruined the sanctity of the Isle of Couchland

&gt;Wake up in the middle of the night to Hamburglar feasting again, get up and tell her to get the fuck back to bed

&gt;Runs back into her room faster than Usain Bolt on cocaine, bag of pretzels in tow

&gt;Next 4 days or so uneventful, save for the fat swine not pulling her weight (As if she could pull half her fucking weight) in chores, namely dishwashing

&gt;That night we force Hamburglar to wash all the dishes for the evening, we've all helped wash/dry/put away dishes every night except Hammy so we all agreed that she can do it by herself

&gt;Hamburglar very slow at washing, obviously has never had to lift a sausage finger in her entire life. Tries to skip out on drying the dishes and thinks she can just put them away while they're wet

&gt;Takes literally ALL our plates, tries to reach up and put heavy, wet dishes in a cupboard with soapy hands

&gt;SURPRISE.MOV

&gt;With a thunderous crash louder than her thighs slapping together when she walks, ALL our plates come crashing down on to the floor around Hamburglar

&gt;No survivors

&gt;Unfortunately she is unharmed, likely due to the fact that the layers of fat resembling cottage cheese under her skin absorbing any kind of damage those plates could have inflicted

&gt;""IT'S NOT MY FAULT, YOU GUYS ARE MEAN AND I'M LIKE YOUR SLAVE. I HAVE LOW BLOOD SUGAR I SHOULD BE RESTING RIGHT NOW BUT YOU'RE WORKING ME INTO THE GROUND""

&gt;Dramatically runs into bathroom to cry, leave us to clean up this huge fucking mess

&gt;Have to eat from bowls from now on, no matter what meal it is

&gt;Everyone in the house beginning to hate Hamburglar, has now permanently been cast away to the Isle of Couchland for the rest of the trip, everybody locks their room doors at night so she can't come in and socialize with any of us

&gt;Probably cried bacon grease tears that night

**tl;dr: Baby baluga Hamburglar is housed with my friends and I, buys only cookies and candy to last her 2 weeks without grocery shopping, discloses creepy sexual/romantic dreams to me, then when we ask her to wash the dishes ONCE, she fucks it up and manages to break all the dishes in the house then locks herself in the bathroom to avoid cleaning up her own mess.**


Third and final part of the tyranny that is Hamburglar will arrive either tomorrow or in a few hours, depending on the feedback on this one. She's not done fucking up our trip, far from done."	t5_2vzax	True
1374614530.0	1iwtsp	Some FPSs are Really Sad	FakeCakeShake	581	82	156	"I have a short story about a family of hamplanets that I saw while eating at a restaurant one night.

My daughter went to CeCe's Pizza one night with one of her friends, and since then, she's BEGGED to go back. She loves pizza, and they have games, so it's a win-win for her.

Unfortunately, CeCe's Pizza also tastes terrible and is the hamplanet mothership, especially here in the Southern US.

Normally, I resist her begging, but one night, I decided to indulge her. She's a smart girl, who doesn't overeat and really loves video games. So, here we go for $5 all-you-can-eat pizza.

We got there just after the lunch rush and before supper. We gathered some lukewarm rubbery pizza and sat down at a table across from ahamplanet family. There was a mother hamplanet, probably in the 300 lb range. There was an aunt or older sister hamplanet creeping up on 250. And there was a young hamplanet.

The young hamplanet was one of the saddest sights I've ever seen. The mom and aunt were bringing him plates stacked high with pizza and desserts, and he appeared to be eating in a coma. His eyes were half-closed, and his jaw was just going through these rhythmic chewing motions. He was huge, too. He filled out the booth bench. He was even larger than the other members of his family.

The saddest part was that he was young. Probably 8 or 9. He looked very sick and pale. My daughter kept watching him, even though I kept trying to engage her otherwise. The young hamplanet didn't seem to have any awareness of anything other than the rhythm of his jaw.

My heart was broken for him because his mom had gotten him three plates full of pizza, they were 8 inch stacks. I looked from my healthy, active daughter who was just a few years younger to this kid who has been given food to the point of illness. I wanted to cry. I wanted to vomit. I wanted that mother to be dragged out and put in the stocks for the crimes of ignorance and child abuse.

Last time we saw Saggy, she was sobbing and drunk, telling me not to hit ~~my~~ her ex-boyfriend even though he was abusing her. What an ungrateful bag! But you know what FPS? Despite what all of you may think, there is something far worse than Saggy being ungrateful for my help: 

Her being grateful for it.

You see, after she sobered up a bit the next morning and had started digesting half the freezer’s worth of food, she realized that I had actually ~helped~ her and therefore, *must* be her best friend. This is where the majority of the fatlogic starts to show up. 

Engage BEST FRIEND GREENTEXT

&gt; be me, Saggy-Sucks, contemplating life and my bowl of oatmeal, when I feel a large, amoeboid boulder attempt osmosis with my body.

&gt; Oops, no…it’s Saggy giving me a hug.

&gt; Wait, what? Saggy doesn't like me.

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks, I'm sorry I yelled at you last night, I was drunk. I really appreciate you helping me with Feeder, he's such a creep! I don't want him coming over to the apartment anymore, ok?""

&gt; I nod my head, too confused to speak.

&gt; Her cheek muscles do their best, and I am rewarded with a sloppy grin. 

&gt; ""Oh I'm so glad we're friends now! I'm gonna cook you dinner like you cook for Dramagirl and me."" 

&gt; I've never cooked for her, only Dramagirl, Saggy just always eats the leftovers before I can put them up.

&gt; Nod my head again.

&gt; Whale squeals are too terrible to put into words.

&gt; I flee to higher ground

**LATER THAT EVENING**

&gt; Doing homework, Algebra homework is due online at 12:00am.

&gt; Hear a series of loud thuds down the hallway, then a banging on my door.

&gt; ""SAGGY-SUCKS! DINNER'S READY!""

&gt; Oh god...this is gonna be aweful.

&gt; Drag myself to living room because she IS trying to be nice.

&gt; She had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, a frozen Red Baron pizza for the both of us, ~waffles?~, and there were a bunch of cupcakes on a plate from the platter she had made that morning. 

&gt; Insert gif with a super tired and/or frustrated person in it, cause that would be my face.

&gt; Sit down and Saggy brings me ma plate/trough 

&gt; Eat the green beans, a waffle, and a few bites of pizza and I am defeated.

&gt; I did my best Saggy I swear!

&gt; Not good enough for Lady Humps.

&gt; ""Eat Saggy-Sucks! I made all this food, you gotta do better than that! How are you ever gonna get to your ideal weight?""

Note: had been talking about getting to my ideal weight with Dramagirl. That ideal weight was 10lbs lighter than my (now because of Feeder) 145.

&gt; Why does everyone want me to be fat???

&gt; ""My ideal weight is 10lbs down, not 20 up Saggy.""

&gt; Saggy rolls her eyes like I was some small, misguided child.

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks that's not an ideal weight, you're already too skinny! I honestly don't why girls keep trying to be skinnier and skinnier, it never helps them get a guy. And if it does, it's just because the guy is a douchebag and he wants to hit em and quit em.""

&gt; Sooooooo....all your ""boyfriends"" ever? Don't say anything though, still trying to be nice.

&gt; ""Well I already ate dinner (lie), so why don't you just finish it for me?""

&gt; It worked, because everyone knows other peoples' food doesn't have calories! Saggy could no longer berate my need for added love-fluff while food was available. 

&gt; Oh wait yes she could.

&gt; She continues to tell me all of my problems stem from being a ""fence-post"" and I looked malnourished. She said she gets any guy she wants and she eats anything she likes. Her life is perfect.

&gt; Those last four words were barely out of her mouth before she did a complete 180 and started to describe how her life was actually the most horrible thing ever, she was depressed and wanted to kill herself because she just couldn't be happy.

I've been around actually suicidal people, and I've been around people who just want attention.

Saggy was most certainly the latter.

&gt; Saggy stuffin her face with my portion of friend chicken, followed closely by a waffle.

&gt; Wow I just figured out where the inspiration for those crazy chips came from.

&gt; Continued to talk for *HOURS* about how she was super depressed, her doctors didn't understand her and wouldn't listen when she told them why she couldn't loose weight (yes, she was describing her health to her doctors), her mom wouldn't give her any money for this tattoo she ~~wanted~~ needed, and none of her friends in the apartment complex wanted to talk to her anymore because their boyfriends just ""couldn't stay away from her luscious body.""

&gt; vomit.exe

&gt; Well at least now I know why Saggy has latched on to me: she has no more friends left because she's slept or has tried to sleep with all of their boyfriends. She probably bragged about it to all of them and was surprised when they reacted with anger.

&gt; She would not stop talking/whining/complaining.

&gt; I kept trying to tell her I had to do my math homework, that I had an assignment due.

&gt; Saggy has no time for your mortal concerns, she must vent her frustrations, and must therefore ignore your comments completely.

&gt; I finally just say ""Look Saggy, you should talk to a councilor if you're really feeling suicidal, but I need to finish my math homework."" 

&gt; Started to stand up and go back to my room.

&gt; ""Are you fucking **SERIOUS**? Saggy screams.

&gt; I turn around, because holy-overreaction!

&gt; She looks at me, aghast.

&gt; ""I just cooked you an entire meal, and you're going to leave me with ALL OF THESE DISHES???""

Guys, the kitchen looked like an atomic bomb had gone off. It was a massachre of pots, pans, grease, and butter. Disaster movies could have used it as a set for an airplane crash, a tornado aftermath, a Godzilla rampage, or all three combined. Whenever I cooked for Dramagirl and/or myself, I always cleaned as I went, so that the only dishes left to clean up at the end were the ones we used for eating. Then I cleaned those too.

&gt; ""Saggy I always clean up when I cook.""

&gt; Didn't even bother listening to her yelling and screaming about me being an ungrateful bitch, I just hurried back to my computer.

&gt; 11:58pm

&gt; Are you fucking kidding me?

&gt; She had complained about her horrible first-world problems to me for over THREE HOURS.

&gt; Sent an email to my math teacher begging for mercy and explaining what happened.

**THE NEXT DAY**

Talked to my math teacher and she said if what I said was true I needed to talk to a councellor about Saggy's suicidal attitude. She extended my homework because she was a wonderful woman.

Then I called up Dramagirl.

&gt; set up a date with a girl.  she picks mexican restaurant near my house

&gt; ""i eat there ALL the time"" she says.  

&gt; this should have been a red flag.  mexican food is all the things you dont want to eat

&gt; hindsightis2020.gif

&gt; arrive for date.  ground begins to shake.  a meteor it hurtling towards me.   ""aetheist!"" oh god no.

&gt; face looks like my date, but has more rolls than entenmann's.  [5'5' 220](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-12067-body-shape.htm#img) i count at least 4 rolls on her sides. 

&gt; modern nightmare beast human-inchworm chimera 

&gt; fuck it. it's rude to run.  havnt eaten all day.  why punish her for my mistake of not demanding a pic?  decide to buy her a quick dinner and bolt.

&gt; oh, ok, whatever

&gt; plates are typical mexican fare.  enough carbs for all of africa covered with enough cheese to make wisconsin proud

1375604079.0	1jo7ik	Tales from IT: What's this, an emotional update?	ohgodwhydoineedthis	627	132	107	"Oh sweet release. I'm finally home from doing a weekend round at work, and my god, I need to get some shit off my chest.

So being a senior manager does have it's downsides. I had to spend my entire Sunday monitoring the set up of 100 or so upgraded computers. All fun and games when no one is noticing me becoming slowly more and more shitfaced as the day wears on. Hip flasks are amazing.

&gt;Only myself and about 4 underlings helping me out

&gt;Goddamn budgets

&gt;Better this than the dole line

&gt;Ha, lunch time!

&gt;Get that pub meal into me... $7 with a pint!

We begin to gather ourselves to go down. As we hit the entrance foyer, I notice the security (the only other people in the building on a Sunday) are scurrying about, trying to rectify what could have been mistaken for a bomb plot.

lolnope. It's just LardLover, more shit faced than I am, flailing around and throwing garbage at the building. She had *really* let herself go. Her hair was matted (and still just as greasy), her makeup smeared over her face, dark circles surrounding her eyes. Hell, I still feel sorry for her in a way, but all my sympathy is over taken by how she treated all of us, and the security.

*(Translators note: The following has been translated from drunk whale into Australian English. Obscenities have been left in)*

&gt;""THIS FUCKING COMPANY RUINED ME. SEE, THESE MANAGERS ARE JUST CUNTS. FUCKING DISCRIMINATION, THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. NO ONE CARES ABOUT ME.""

&gt;She grabs more trash from the public bin

&gt;Olympic shot-put throw manages to get about 2m high on the 20 story building

&gt;Drunk me has lost all inhibitions

&gt;Giggles uncontrollably still inside the foyer

&gt;LardLover manages to see this over her drunken blur

&gt;""YOU FUCKING BITCH. YOU'RE THE REASON WHY I'M HERE NOW. I COULD HAVE HAD IT ALL. YOU RUINED MY ENTIRE SET UP. WHY THE FUCK DID YOU RUIN IT?! YOU JEALOUS BITCH""

&gt;""YOU PROBABLY WANTED MR DESPERATEROMANTIC""

&gt;Laugh even harder, having had a partner of my own for quite a while now

&gt;She begins to try and charge through the automatic doors

&gt;Security shuts them off, locking her out, and us in

&gt;Nooo, my pub meal!

Security motion for her to leave, and yell through the slight gap in the glass that they'll be calling the police if she doesn't leave immediately. Eventually she saunters off down the street, with tears in her eyes. I may have been laughing then, but sober me later felt fucking terrible. I know she was a horrible person to us, but seeing her so... destroyed was horrific. 

&gt;Finally leave, get to the local Irish pub

&gt;Beer battered chips and gravy, to feed the drunk urges

&gt;Get ready to leave, and who should stumble in?

&gt;LardLover trips past us to the bar, demanding a long island ice tea

&gt;Australian liquor laws mean she is escorted from the bar to a stable seat by a bouncer, with a bottle of water for her in hand, and no alcohol in sight

&gt;""I DON'T WANT NONE OF YOUR STUPID WATER. I WANT A REAL DRINK. WATER ISN'T EVEN YUMMY""

&gt;Drunk me giggles harder, with my interns beginning to punch me to be quiet

*3 of my interns were over 18, and sitting in the eating area meant ShyIntern could sit with us*

&gt;Her senses zone into us

&gt;""YOU FUCKING WHORE. YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME TO RUIN MY LIFE, AREN'T YOU? HOLY SHIT, I WILL FUCKING STAB YOU. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO RUIN IN MY LIFE, YOU CUNT?""

&gt;Actually burst into full laughter

&gt;Can not breath, tears in my eyes laughter

&gt;Bouncer escorts her out as she throws the free water on him with more accuracy than she threw trash on the building

&gt;Regain my sensibilities and order another drink and prepare to hit the bottle-o for more hip flask juice

We return to work, and I snuggle up over in my office, laughing to myself as my interns finish up, and finish some paper work to save time tomorrow. Not being completely inebriated, I get everything done before quitting time, and release myself and my interns early to go home and get some goddamn sleep.

&gt;Begin to head home, too sober for comfort. Scheduled day off Monday, yay!

&gt;Be the last one out, say goodbye to security

&gt;Round the corner to the bus

&gt;See LardLover sitting in the alley behind the building, a paper bag in her hand and tears coming down her face

&gt;A Mcdonalds bag lay sprawled before her

&gt;Empathy kicks in

&gt;""Hey... LardLover... are you alright?""

&gt;""FUCK YOU, CUNT! You only give a shit now I'm fucked over""

&gt;""Well, fuck you too then. It's not my fault you set up an illegal rouse""

&gt;""I just wanted to be compensated for my suffering. Every fucking day is the same. Get up, eat, work, eat, work, eat, work eat...""

&gt;She partially dozes off

&gt;""LARDLOVER, stay with me. Are you alright?""

&gt;""FUCK YOU"" she screams as she lifts her head in and out of consciousness

&gt;I can't just leave her here. Fuck.

&gt;""Can I get Mr DesperateRomantic to come and get you?""

&gt;""That bag of dicks left me when I couldn't get his chair out of this goddamn building""

&gt;Things begin to come together

&gt;No sympathy, just a need to make sure she is safe

&gt;Begin to call an ambulance

&gt;""Look, I'm calling an ambulance""

&gt;Making sure they are aware of her weight, they send out an appropriate vehicle

At that point, I figured that her being a complete cunt didn't matter... I could be up for manslaughter charges if I just left her there. Besides, no one deserves to be in such a situation. I had no sympathy for her, but I knew how bad it was to have no where else but an alley with a bottle as a friend.

The ambulance came about half an hour later, and between her screaming obscenities at me about how I ruined her ruse, and how I was discriminating against her, and was a gender traitor (lol), I heard about how Mr DesperateRomantic was the only human who wanted to talk to her at all for the past few years, and she was using sex to control the relationship. He took the first out he could, leaving her emotionally crippled. Her redundancy payment only covered about one quarter of her credit card debts, not even touching her mortgage. She was being pounced on by creditors and was isolated from any family who never wanted to talk to her... so far as I could make out, it was because they 'never helped her enough'.

They took her off, and I gave them her personal effects to keep safe. She vomited and passed out before the doors closed, and I waved away the poor EMT who had to deal with that blubber butt.

So yes, I have no idea what to fucking feel. Well, I feel drunk. That's a plus. I have no sympathy for her, because she put herself into the situation, but I empathized with her current situation, because I have been down in the dumps with no where to go. But fuck... she isn't going anywhere but court at this point. Assaulting a bouncer, stealing from our company, public disturbances... all these charges could be laid against her.

Sorry about the jimmy's.

And sorry about the drunk writing. There may be mistakes in spelling. I decided to drown myself after becoming far too sober on the way home.

**EDIT:** One of the main reasons why I helped this heffalump, was not nessecerally because I cared too much about her, but that I know healthcare in this country is easily accessible, and it would not put her or myself out to send her off there. Also, if a person dies, they try and find the person who most recently contacted them. There was CCTV everywhere and the security and interns saw me laughing at her a few times yesterday. You can be charged with negligence to a certain degree, specially if you know of the person and see they are in trouble. 

And yes, I do drink a lot. Is it a problem? Maybe. Does it affect my work quality or home life? No. I'm not going to justify it... I drink a lot and it's bad. But I'm not going to kid myself by saying that I'll just stop, and everything will be fine. Ether way, I just make sure I have more sober days than drunk days. "	t5_2vzax	True
1373393640.0	1hy71t	Fat People Gym	herograw	591	96	66	"Long time reader, first time submitter. 

I've never really run into an FPS long enough or good enough to bother posting it here, but there have been a couple times when I've encountered what was unmistakably the aftermath of one. This story depicts one such aftermath, and the accompanying FPS-ripe vibe that I encounter every day at my gym.

I live in an apartment complex with a small on-site gym and every time I go there it seems like an FPS might break out or has just happened. 

&gt;Be me, male, 5'8"", 230lbs, tired of being overweight and on a mission to drop the excess lbs

&gt;Head to gym, mentally preparing for whatever typical bullshit is going on today

&gt;Gym is PACKED but only one person (let's call her ""Recovering Planet"") actually doing anything. 

&gt;Everyone else (at least 5 people) doing basically dick. One guy doing sets of one rep on whatever machine he can drop the weights on, i.e. all the machines. Soon to be hamplanet mother on 1st treadmill walking sideways while talking on cell phone and yelling at her two fat kids.

&gt;Bike machine? Taken, someone sitting, not actually using it. 

&gt;Legs? same. Arms? same. 

&gt;Machine thing with the cords? Previously mentioned dude busy grunting out single rep and dropping weights. 

&gt;Elliptical? Recovering Planet using it, actually excercising.

&gt;Observe only open machine in the room, 2nd treadmill.

&gt;MFW ripped open bag of chocolate chips sitting in drink holder.

&gt;MFW chocolate chips on treadmill and all over floor.

&gt;""Anyone using this treadmill?"" Silence. Someone *left it this way*

&gt;Gather up and throw away dozens of chocolate chips. Some stuck in treadmill, guess they will stay there.

&gt;Start running. Almost lose footing due to thunderous roar of slammed weight after another single rep.

&gt;Want to leave. Not worth it.

&gt;Look down at own flabby stomach.

&gt;Keep running. Decide not to stop until every single person leaves that gym.

&gt;45 minutes and 3.5 miles later, exhausted. Everyone gone.

&gt;Wait, no. Recovering Planet still there, doing core now. Awesome.

&gt;Wind down, clean up, both leave.

This is a *typical* day at my gym. Every day I come in and refuse to leave before they do. They might not even notice, and that's okay. Still gives me the motivation to do a little extra each time.

ALSO: two days later, chocolate chips still wedged into cracks of treadmill

EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks for the support and suggestions! I'm also delighted that this could be used by others as a motivational tool and wish the best to those in similar situations who are fighting the good fight."	t5_2vzax	True
1373372013.0	1hxi0a	Online dating horror story...	idgygdi	682	188	198	"So I live in Ontario, Canada. Pretty nice spot, sweet and honest people for the most part, lots of opportunities to meet people. I’m getting bored with my social circle and decide to expand it by trying my hand at online dating.

&gt; Enter POF, Plenty of Fish (For the record, free online dating sites usually lead to disaster.)

&gt; Talking to a few girls when one set of pictures makes me click. She’s cute, 5’10 and looks to be a very healthy weight in a soccer uniform. Great, an athletic girl!

&gt; Add her to my favourites and decide to write her the next day. She beats me to the punch and messages me within a few hours, this great and well thought out message that hit on just about every point in my profile. Awesome.

&gt; Our schedules don’t match up right away so about a week later she and I decide we should meet in person. Even better.

&gt; Comes the day, a few days later, and we decide to meet up at a local bar. In relative Idgygdi fashion, I show up a few minutes early. Better safe than sorry. Order a drink and take a seat. I was excited!

&gt; In walks this girl, at least 150lbs heavier than her picture, and I’m hoping it’s not the girl I’m here to meet. Sure enough, it is.

&gt; “Hi, Idgygdi! Great to meet you!”

Here’s where I turn from charming nice guy to complete ass. I was having a tough week and was looking forward to this date very much. My fuse was already short and this tipped me over the edge.

&gt; “What the hell do you expect me to do in this situation?” I pull out my phone and pull up her profile. “THIS is who I was expecting to meet with” while showing her the phone “and this is who I get?” while pointing to her. “You’ve had a week to tell me that you’ve gained weight and you may not be the girl you pictured. I would have been cool with that, but this? You’ve been lying to me. Not a good start.”

&gt; I took out a $10 bill, threw it on the table and walked out without even looking back.

&gt; All of this occurred in the span of about a minute.

I don’t give a shit if I hurt the poor girl; she had a week to fess up to her lie. The way I see it, if you can’t be honest with yourself or me and you just met me, I don’t want you in my life. Basing the “relationship” on a lie would have been a bad move, too."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;HamCliff spots an elderly man shuffling towards my checkout

&gt;she contemplates the sign saying 'TEN ITEMS OR LESS'

&gt;HamCliff used *Rollout!*

&gt;nearly kills elderly gent in order to get herself and her cart into the checkout before him

&gt;starts to pile her stuff up

&gt;say, 'Sorry miss, this is 10 items or less, wheelchairs and handbaskets only.'

&gt;realize she probably wouldn't physically fit through the other lanes

&gt;Elderly Gent is leaning on the checkout looking like he's about to kick off there and then

&gt;say, 'Scuse me sir, would you like to come in front? I'll just quickly scan your newspaper.'

&gt;spoke the fatty, ""I WAZ HURR FURST!""

&gt;say, 'I'll be very quick. I've already punched the paper's cost in.' and point to the screen.

&gt;oh look, the ceiling, how interesting

&gt;such a marvelous ceiling to be uncomfortably staring at

&gt;it would make a good alternative to staring at someone rudely

&gt;hear a phlegm-laden cough

&gt;look back down just in time to see HamCliff produce a wrinkled, *soggy* $100 note from her bra

&gt;thrusts it towards me

&gt;watch with startling clarity as a tiny bead of sweat gathers on the corner of the note and catches the light

&gt;HamPlanet uses whalesong

&gt;""THE FUCK YOU JUST SAY? YOU CALLING ME *FAT*?""

&gt;say, 'I'm sorry, I'm not accepting that. It is unhygienic. I am refusing to serve you.'

Side note: in Australian retail you can refuse to serve a customer based on their behaviour towards you. 'I am refusing to serve you' is the magic phrase. Management might decide to process the transaction once you've removed yourself or another staff member can step in, but if an employee feels they are uncomfortable serving a customer for various reasons (including unsanitary/unhygienic behaviour) you can step back and give them a big ol' nope.

&gt;the next five minutes is a 6'2 skinny gay guy slowly steering a raging, homophobic landwhale towards the entrance by stepping close to her and forcing her to step back, saying 'get out' in a perfectly calm voice over and over as she continues to wail and whine

1365200463.0	1brh75	I think... maybe I just got thin-shamed? wtf.	SometimesIArt	598	106	70	"So... honestly, I haven't had a whole lot of fat people be rude to me because of my body. There was the one lady I posted about a ways back who stopped me out on a run, but other than that and the odd tiny remark from my becoming-a-planet roommate, I haven't had a lot of experience in it. 

But this just happened about 20 mins ago, so here goes...

So there's me, 5'6"", 163lbs, still losing weight, living in Canada, graduated uni with degree in music last year (this is relevant, I promise). Just scored 9/10 British boyfriend, been on a few dates, nothing super intense but officially relationship time. 

I'm visiting my old uni today because tomorrow I am drumming for someone who still goes there in their year-end, major recital that basically decides whether or not you've failed the entire program, and today is her final rehearsal. 

Bf (T) is currently getting same degree, is also playing in her recital. So we hang out in some downtime before he has to go to another rehearsal (I came early to visit with old friends), and I have some time to wander/say hi to everyone. 

Before I can go very far, friend that I made last year approaches me. 

5'7""ish, not *too* fat, probably 225lbs-ish? Still obese at any rate. Let's call her ""M"". I get excited/do the girl thing and give her a hello/hug which M half-heartedly returns which I chalk up to her being exhausted which really does happen this time of year for everyone in the program. 

Instead of entering into the usual conversation of ""how are you, I haven't seen you in forever,"" she breaks out with ""hey... do you have a crush on T?""

""I guess you can say that? We're actually...""

""Because if you do, I need you to back off. We're this close to a relationship --"" (holds her fingers up an inch apart) ""-- and it's important to me. I've liked him for months."" 

I kinda stare her down a little bit. Thisissupercrazyawkward.png. 

""M, T and I are dating. We're in a relationship. I'm not sure what to tell you."" 

She starts crying on the spot. ""What? How can you do this to me?!"" 

I feel legitimately awful, having been on the side of liking a guy and having him go out with someone else. I start to give her a hug and apologize (despite not knowing she liked him, ever), but she swats my hand away. 

""No, I don't want to hear it. You're such a bitch, you know that? You think you're hot shit just because you've lost a few pounds. Now you'll just throw yourself at any guy and think you can have him because you're skinny?"" (I'm not skinny.) ""I didn't want to believe it at the end of last year, but you really did just turn into one of those thin-obsessed, mindless women who only care about looks."" (Where is she getting all of this from?) ""Good luck being better than the rest of us you slut."" 

And she stormed off. 

whatthefuckjusthappened. 

Everyone is staring. I'm not sure what to do. I go and take refuge in a practice room and type out FPS in order to wait for T to get out of rehearsal. I'll update if his reaction is as funny as I think it's going to be. Needless to say I think I just killed an apparently shallow friendship. "	t5_2vzax	True

Aaaaaaand we're back! Here we go:

&gt;be me, team captain at the end of swim season

&gt;not be Bertha, bane of my existence, devourer of hope, a whole 250lbs and 5'7"" of nasty fattie

&gt;put up all season with her dumb shit

&gt;been to the principals office more times than I could count on both hands

&gt;be in chemistry class

&gt;napping because I can

&gt;hear name called on intercom, along with Skinnybro, Hairbro, and Fishman

&gt;godfuckingdammit

&gt;be in principals office once again

&gt;fucking Bertha is there

&gt;slowly absorbing the chair she managed to stuff herself into

&gt;huge shit eating grin

&gt;her asshole brother and sister are there too, flanking

&gt;papa whale lounging on a bench nearby (couldn't fit in office..?)

&gt;principal seats us

&gt;So, you all must know why you're here

&gt;exchange glanced with bros, we all shrug

&gt;principal glares

&gt;Don't play dumb, we're only trying to figure out what happened so everyone can walk away happy

&gt;ohfuckingreally

&gt;we sit, dumbfounded, no idea what's happening

&gt;So you won't admit to it?

&gt;admit to... What?

&gt;Bertha gurgles

&gt;everyone turns and looks at her, waiting

&gt;AH SAWH THEHM PUT MEAN NOTES IN MAH LOCKEH

&gt;SAHYIN THEH HATE MEH

&gt;MAKIN FUN UH MEH WEIGHT

&gt;principal turns to us, stares

&gt;we all explain we never did anything of the sort

&gt;THEHR LIAHS AH SAW THEM DO EET

&gt;pulls out a handful of crumpled papers

&gt;all of them scribbled on in shitty ass handwriting

&gt;all the same handwriting

&gt;....Bertha's.

&gt;bros and I sit in shock

&gt;this has gone waaaaay too far

&gt;tell principal there's no proof we did anything, refuse to apologize, the whole deal

&gt;Bertha gurgles once more

&gt;THEH MEHD FUN UH MEH DURSLEXIA

Never mentioned this in other Bertha tales because it wasn't directly related to anything or contingent on her fatness, but Bertha has often claimed we made fun of her for being dyslexic. We have no proof she was actually dyslexic, probably just an idiot who used it as a crutch. The diver Bertha destroyed on the ferry is actually dyslexic and never used it as an excuse to bully people, had straight A's, never mentioned it really except to say Bertha was bullshitting
ANYWAY
BACK INTO THE FRAY

&gt;everyone looks back and forth at each other, dumbstruck

&gt;principal tells us it could be a serious offense to make fun of someone for having a disability

&gt;says this kind of behavior could get us expelled

&gt;pulls out some forms

&gt;says they're for an anti-bullying initiative

&gt;says before anyone can leave bros and I have to sign them, promising to not be bullies

&gt;says they're just a formality but insists we sign

&gt;jesusfuckingchristwhat

&gt;bros start to comply

&gt;they pick up forms

&gt;Bertha gurgles with pleasure

&gt;oh fucking hell no

&gt;have a moment of madness, snatch forms away

&gt;tell principal we'll sign if Bertha and her siblings sign some first

&gt;because they're a formality, riiiiiight?

&gt;they refuse

&gt;make up a bunch of shit about how the forms aren't for them, they've had perfect behavior, bros and I are the real bullies

&gt;my vision starts to cloud

&gt;everything is red

&gt;ragemode: activated

&gt;glaring at Bertha, low voice

&gt;Bertha, we never did any of this and you know it. Stop lying.

&gt;YUH ACCUSING MEH OF LYIN? YUHR THEH LIAH

&gt;her face gets red and jowls wobble dangerously

&gt;siblings and papa whale readying themselves for attack

&gt;I set down the forms

Probably relevant to add that I'm not an angry person. I'm pretty internal about being upset, and let stuff slide a lot more than I should, but once I hit my tipping point- I do regrettable things. Up until then there are usually no warning signs, and since it's rare people never expect it.

&gt;no fucks left to give

&gt;slide out of chair, lunge towards Bertha at lightning speed

&gt;she flinches so hard her whole body jiggles

&gt;siblings are on the edge of their seats, ready to pounce

&gt;papa whale and principal watching silently, unsure

&gt;I HAVE NO FUCKS TO GIVE

&gt;put my hands on both of Berthas armrests

&gt;lean in real close

&gt;stare right into the black, fat encircled pits I assume her eyes were hidden in

&gt;can feel her avoiding my gaze, getting uncomfortable, shrinking into the seat

&gt;STOP TELLING LIES. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. NO ONE CARES YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR ALLEGED DYSLEXIA. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU. SO JUST STOP.

&gt;walk back to seat

&gt;put hands behind head, lean back, and keep glaring

&gt;Bertha sits in shock for a bit

&gt;probably the first time anyone's actually gotten in her face

&gt;starts wobbling

&gt;making weird rodent noises

&gt;like rats being stepped on in a trash bag

&gt;is....is it crying?

&gt;oh

&gt;oh shit

&gt;look back and forth at bros, they have no idea what to do either

&gt;whatdidido.ohgod

&gt;fuck it

&gt;stand my ground

&gt;pretend to be cool, inside freaking out

&gt;look directly at principal

&gt;Are we done here? Because I am.

&gt;bros look on in shock

&gt;ohgodohgodohgodwhatdidijustsayohgodohgod

&gt;JUSTGOWITHIT

&gt;stand up out of chair

&gt;give crying Bertha the most evil, withering look I can manage

&gt;she's still visibly shaken and whimpering

&gt;manage to keep rage under wraps just enough for a semblance of civil speech

&gt;Don't ever talk to me again. I'm done with you.

&gt;bros tentatively get up with me

&gt;leave

And that's the end. The principal couldn't get me in trouble because technically I hadn't done anything wrong. Bertha and her family were furious, but couldn't do shit either. They pretty much left my friends and I alone after that. 
Of course I have dozens of other stories about Bertha and her shittiness- but most of them are just her being a bad person, not fatlogic, or at least minimal fatlogic. Her family moved shortly after the events of this story. 

Epilogue:

&gt;be me a year later

&gt;all is well

&gt;Skinnybro says he saw Bertha at school

&gt;whole nasty family visiting old friends I guess

&gt;spot her in cafeteria

&gt;no friends

&gt;probably gained like 30lbs since I saw her last

&gt;sitting alone eating mcbeetus

&gt;sees me looking at her, face flushes red

&gt;struggles to get out of chair

&gt;waddles away at top speed

&gt;too scared to even grab her food

**The Hamspanic Part I**


Medical background here. I will try to keep it simple, but if there are terms you don’t get letmegooglethatforyou.com

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Be me. 20 M. Be working in Intensive Care Unit as a nurse tech (body fluid cleanup specialist/nurses bitch).

On my first day I found out that typically out of the 20 beds in the [ICU](http://i.imgur.com/UXvcIiS.gif), 3/4 were always victims of the WhenThyroidsAttack.mov

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Be working shitty late night shift. Actually tonight is not too bad since most coworkers are chill bro-nurses who are freaking awesome! Turning out to be a slow night, uneventful. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Suddenly the channel 4 super-doppler weather radar picks up a high blood pressure system approaching the area.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The US Geological Survey picks up an undiscovered tectonic plate moving across the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The hospital has just entered...""The Adipocyte Zone.""

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since it was a slow night the bro-nurses pulled the tv out of the break room and had it in the nurses station watching the Mavericks game.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Senses a disturbance in the force. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dirk Nowitzki shoots a free throw but for some reason it pulls wildly 90 degrees before hitting the basket. WTF?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Overhear chatter on radio of paramedics driving a moving truck to the hospital. Lolwut? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imgur_9CUtI.gif) Silly paramedics...you’re supposed to use an ambulance. Amiright?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Announcement over the PA system for all able bodied medical staff to descend into the depths of the ER. I had to stay and man the desk while all of the male nurses ran downstairs. The air began to get thick and greasy with the smell of fetid fermented fungal fecal cheese. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In rolls a Hispanic planet we'll call Hamspanic on a [bariatricbed.jpg](http://imgur.com/BZG7rEu) being transported by a dozen burly paramedics and bro-nurses who are red in the face and breathing heavily from pushing Hispanic Planet up to the ICU. Doctor asks which nurse will be taking care of the patient. Look of [nope](http://imgur.com/NLhLtYI) on everyones face. The unlucky nurse was one of my favorite bros, an older guy we will call Don always seemed to get stuck with the absolute worst patients. [HFW](http://imgur.com/ESILMxV)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to the paramedic report, Hamspanic has to wear a machine called a [CPAP](http://www.soundoxygen.com/wp-content/uploads/full-face.jpg) to breathe at ALL TIMES (remember this, it’s important) which is basically one step down from a full intubation (breathing tube) in that it is strapped tightly and sealed across your nose and mouth and actually forces pressurized air down your throat in instances where people can’t breathe.

Her problem she was admitted to the ER for? (aside from the plethora of obesity related disease).... [drumroll](http://i.imgur.com/6BlEqRv) 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Low oxygen levels and organ damage...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because she won’t wear her CPAP mask...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because it interferes with her constant eating...

Quick and dirty medical rundown:

Low oxygen levels=high blood pressure+high heart rate+highly acidic blood+decreased blood oxygen=damages and enlarges the heart which can lead to congestive heart failure = brain damage from lack of oxygen+damages the kidneys which can lead to total renal failure+5-10 years max on constant hemodialysis before you die (or transplant).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[All our faces](http://imgur.com/0VlmXLv) when we realize patient being admitted because eating is more important than breathing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Heart/lungs/kidneys failing due to lack of oxygen.
Impacted colon because...fuck a fiber rich diet! Etc...

(Another fps coming soon just how much a lack of fiber can fuck...you...up. Google diverticulitis if you can't wait)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go with Don to do the initial patient assessment. Hamspanic is PISSED that she has to wear her CPAP because she is hungry. But thankfully she just sounds  like a muffled Jabba underneath the mask.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beds have built in scales. Push button to weigh patient. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After flashing ""Kill Me Please"" across the screen a few times, the display sputters to life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;957 lbs (435 k)

43 lbs short of the weight limit for the biggest hospital beds in existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Leave room. I look at Don. [HFW again](http://imgur.com/ESILMxV)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All of a sudden we hear “Oh booooooyyyyyyyzzzzzz! Come scratch muh kittay!!” 

[Wat](http://imgur.com/zm1nctA)?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go into her room and she had shit herself. Earlier the Doctor had given her elephant laxatives because she was so impacted (colon packed full of tons and tons of dried out hardened shit from fast food) and hadn’t crapped in months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Helped nurse clean her up. It took 4 people to roll her over and hold her legs up to clean the greasy green goodness from each fold. Each time it took 45 minutes because you had to clean out all of the folds. She would giggle the entire time and make sexual passes at all of the male staff, teehee-ing through her oxygen mask. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One hour later over the intercom “Come skratch muh kittay boyz!” she had done it again. She was supposed to call us and we would put a bedpan under her to help contain it. She loved being cleaned up. After the 5th time while the nurse was cleaning out her cavernous shit filled vag we heard her say “That’s it, right there, I like it when you scratch muh kittay!” we realize what she meant by that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[OFW](http://imgur.com/8Ij5YO6) we found out she would mess herself so that the male nurses would have to...clean...out...the...[kitty](http://imgur.com/CkegT6s) (SFW).

I then proceeded to go home that night and cry in the shower with all of the bleach I could find.

1374259693.0	1incr4	Chubs McNasty: The Roommate from Hamplanet Hell Part 3	gunpowdergelatine	619	125	91	"The Nacho  Incident, or How to Eat Lying Down 

Don't forget to check out [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ikg16/chubs_mcnasty_the_roommate_from_hamplanet_hell/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1il5ht/chubs_mcnasty_the_roommate_from_hamplanet_hell/) 

So after the first few days of living with the Barfield monstrosity, certain… things… started to happen around the apartment. Mostly, food disappeared. Then little traces of it reappeared on the floor or on the couch. Sometimes, strange things went missing, like entire bottles of chocolate syrup or jars of mayonnaise. Plates and cups followed the condiments; it was like everything we had left in our kitchen was growing legs and walking away. 

We had already learned that nothing edible was safe in our house, so we had abandoned cooking meals (like lasagna) entirely. I had a mini fridge left over from my dorm room days, so I put it in my room and the three of us kept whatever we could in there. We kept dry goods in our own rooms and we all locked our doors. Occasionally we made the mistake of leaving something in the kitchen. Those things were lost. 

Ok, so we knew where everything was going. We just couldn’t catch her in the act. Skinny, Cranky, and I were students with jobs, so we were almost never home. We got up early, packed lunches, and didn’t get home until late. Barfield would still be asleep when we left in the morning and when we got home, she’d be sitting on her couch (it would never be our couch again), sagging all the way to the floor, with nothing but maybe a few crumbs around her. 

Since we had abandoned the kitchen for storage, Barfield took it over. Even with four people living there the year before, I had never seen our fridge so full. Things were stacked on top of each other, bulging out all over the place, and I have no idea how she tetris-ed everything in there. I assume it’s the same way she fit into the shower… some sort of whale magic. It was from this endless stash that she fed her ravening hunger, refilling it two or three times a week. She would take a cab for the 15 minute walk to the grocery store. 

A few weeks into the school year, I caught swine flu. Yeah, seriously. The irony still burns. And it was awful. It also meant I couldn’t leave the house for a while. This gave me an opportunity to keep an eye on Barfield. How did she maintain such terrific mass without meat? Cows do it, but they have four stomachs. I’m pretty sure she just had one, although it was certainly industrial-size. 

The first day I stayed home, I was planning on doing a little homework and then chilling in front of the TV for a while. I managed some reading for class and ran out of motivation, so I headed for the living room to sweat out the ham-virus with some cartoons and Gatorade. 

&gt; stumble out with blanket wrapped around me and Gatorade from my secure room fridge

&gt; stop 

&gt; blink repeatedly

&gt; am I hallucinating?

&gt; no, this is really happening

&gt; she is lying on the couch

&gt; eating some sort of shepherd’s pie

&gt; but she’s lying down

&gt; the microwave container is sitting on the ground

&gt; she’s lying on her side on the couch with her face at the edge

&gt; spooning food from the dish to her mouth

&gt; this is the laziest thing  I have ever seen, ever

That’s right. That hamplanet was so lazy, she couldn’t even be bothered to sit upright to eat. I retreated to my room in horror – I was too sick to deal with this shit. 

&gt; hear Barfield head for the bathroom

&gt; she’ll be in there for at least half an hour

&gt; I go out to survey the damage 

&gt; dish is still on the floor

&gt; spoon is also on the floor, although she has at least licked it clean

&gt; trail of gravy up the side of the couch

&gt; like the trail of slime a snail might leave after it had become escargot

&gt; and she just left it there 

&gt; I don’t… I can’t… you poor couch. You poor, poor couch. I never meant for it to be like this. 

&gt; retreat to my room again, unsure of how I will ever be able to clean that greasy, dripping, goo off the couch

&gt; fall asleep

&gt; wake up, hear Barfield in the living room

&gt; ok, hamplanet, this is too disgusting for words

&gt; walk out to confront her

&gt; and stop again… she’s doing it again

&gt; she has another shepherd’s pie and she’s eating it off the ground

&gt; reevaluate my plan

&gt; nope, something has to be said

&gt; “Barfield, why are you eating off the floor? Don’t you have to go to class or something?”

&gt; “I don’t really feel like going today. I’m pretty tired.”

&gt; “And that’s why you’re eating off the floor?”

&gt; “Yeah, I’m hungry and I just don’t feel like moving.”

&gt; as if this is somehow different from every moment of every day

&gt; “Ok, well you need to stop. You don’t clean. I clean. And you’ve managed to spill that shit all over the couch and the floor. Don’t you have a mother?”

&gt; “Stop being such a bitch. You’re home sick, too. Don’t criticize me. I’m not doing anything wrong and I’ll clean it up.”

&gt; “Yeah. I have swine flu. Swine flu is a disease. Being swine is not. You’d better clean that shit up, I swear, or I will lose it.”

&gt; “I said I’d clean it up and I will. God. Go back to bed.” 

And I did. I went to bed and fell asleep and didn’t wake up until the middle of the night. I wandered out to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and learned what Barfield mean by “cleaning up.” She meant that she would dump it all in the sink. Trash and all. Nothing was rinsed, nothing was cleaned, and she’d eaten far more than just those two pies. There was a pizza box and a dozen other bowls, pots, and pans, all caked in grime and piled in the sink. It reeked. I know that I had done dishes just a couple of days before and Skinny and Cranky were just as diligent about keeping the kitchen clean as I was. That was, at most, two days’ worth of dishes. I couldn’t even get to the tap. 

&gt; wake up the next day, still sick, still staying home

&gt; walk out to the living room, the she-beast is back in position, lying on the couch and shoveling food into her mouth

&gt; “Go clean the dishes.”

&gt; no preamble, no windup, I’m tired and sick and my kitchen is a mess

&gt; “I’ll get to them.” 

&gt; “Yes, you will, now, before you go to class.”

&gt; “I’m not going to class, I’ll do it later.”

&gt; “Again? Didn’t you stay home yesterday?”

&gt; “I’m still just really tired.”

&gt; “Ok, here’s the deal. You clean the dishes, or I’m going to move everything you dirtied, as is, and put it in your bed.”

&gt; “If you fucking touch my bed I will throw you out the window.” 

This actually stopped me for a minute. She might have been capable of doing that. Either way, I turned around and went back to my room. Needless to say, the dishes weren’t clean the next time I looked. Or the next time. Then Skinny’s mother was coming over, so we just cleaned up the mess. The swine flu eventually passed (after Skinny caught it) and normal schedules resumed, so none of us were ever home. 

I can hear everyone cringing at our beta-ness; I don’t know why we put up with this for as long as we did. Every time, I threatened to put the dishes in her bed. Every time, she swore she’d do them. Every time, someone else had to. I don’t know if we were just too busy to deal with it or if none of us wanted a fight, but we kept cleaning up. 

While my roommates coped by spending less and less time at home and locking themselves in their rooms when they had to be there, I got angrier and angrier. The whole point was for us to keep our apartment and this heifer had pushed us out of it with her disgusting habits. 

After a particularly nasty incident involving some milk and other things that really can’t be left out, I finally snapped. I gave her one last warning. I told her I was going to put that shit in her bed and she was welcome to try to throw me out the window if she pleased. When I got home from class, the mess was still there. 

&gt; calmly drop my bag in my room

&gt; Barfield is in the living room; how can I get past her without her stopping me?

&gt; I know

&gt; grab a trash bag

&gt; push the mountain of shit from our sink into the trashbag

&gt; it’s wet and rotten and soggy and it smells appalling
&gt; casually stroll past the living room with this steaming bag of putrid filth

&gt; duck into her room

&gt; upend the bag on her bed

&gt; look around and realize she might actually not be able to tell that anything had happened…

Everyone here knows about the strong correlation between hamplanets and sloppiness and Barfield was no exception. For every container, dish, and piece of trash she had left in the sink, there were two or three more in her room. It was EVERYWHERE. I can’t believe she could sleep in there – I had to fight not to lose my lunch. 

I fled back to the safety of my room where I stripped off all of my tainted clothing, bundled it all into another trash bag to deal with at another time, and ran to the shower. I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and kept scrubbing even after I was probably clean, because in my head that beast wouldn’t come after me in the shower. Finally, the hot water gave out and I had step back out and face what I had done. 

But the warpig sat there, quietly watching TV and eating (lying down, of course). She said nothing to me. I said nothing to her. We both acted like nothing had ever happened. Trash and dishes stopped appearing in the sink. 

I thought that perhaps I had won. 

The next weekend, I thoroughly cleaned the house. When I got to the kitchen, I gave everyone a heads-up to grab whatever they might want from the kitchen because I was going to mop the floor and everyone would have to stay out until it dried. Skinny and Cranky had already eaten lunch, so no problems there. Then I got to Barfield. 

&gt; “What do you mean, I won’t be able to go in the kitchen?”

&gt; “The floor will be wet. If you walk on it, you’ll get it dirty again. So get whatever you want now.”

&gt; “But what if I get hungry?”

&gt; ha. if.

&gt; “That’s why I’m warning you now. Grab what you want and get out of my way so I can clean up the train wreck you’ve made of our kitchen.”

&gt; “Listen, I’m not the only one who uses that kitchen. But I don’t even care. Just let me grab a few things.”

By a few things, she meant another week’s worth of food. She threw a frozen pizza in the oven. Just in case she got hungry during the half an hour it would take for the floor to dry. I waited for this goddamn pizza to cook because I knew better than to get between her and something she wanted to eat. Then while it was in the oven, she started pulling down other things from the shelves. She made TWO peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She put them on paper towels and lovingly transported them to her room. Of course, she left all the dishes and trash she used to make them. Oh, and did I mention I’m extremely allergic to peanuts?

&gt; oven beeps

&gt; pizza’s done

&gt; thunderous crashing 

&gt; she’s coming for her pizza

&gt; Barfield waddles in, glaring

&gt; “Did you mess with my pizza?”

&gt; “Why the fuck would I touch your pizza? Take it and get out.”

&gt; Barfield puts on an oven mitt, grabs the pizza, and walks straight back to her room

&gt; cooling is for anorexics

Thankfully, Skinny was willing to clean up the peanut butter and within an hour or two, my kitchen was sparkling like new. I bleached everything until it felt clean and then bleached it all again. It was all very therapeutic. Cleaning complete, I decided I was going to bake a pie in my beautiful clean kitchen. So I headed off to the grocery store (about a 15 minute walk each way) to get what I needed. About an hour later, I came home with the makings of a glorious pie. 

&gt; walk into kitchen

&gt; whatthefuckisthat

&gt; seriously

&gt; what is that

&gt; on my floor

&gt; it looks like… beans? Sour cream? Cheese? Salsa?

&gt; somebody made nachos

&gt; from the number of cans and jars sitting around, a lot of nachos

&gt; it looks like she just grabbed a fistful and chucked it at the floor that I’ve just cleaned

&gt; it looked purposeful

&gt; but why would she waste food like that? 

&gt; head for my room to stash my groceries in there until I can deal with this travesty

&gt; what. the. fuck. 

&gt; my room is open

&gt; my lock is broken

&gt; my fridge is… empty

&gt; all my food is gone – she turned it into nachos

&gt; bitch

Apparently Barfield had been waiting for her moment to strike. I should have known she would never let the dishes in her bed go. She juggernauted through my door like a gorilla and gobbled up my food. I imagine that’s why she didn’t mind wasting some by throwing it on the floor. Then she went and hid in her room to wait for me to find her little surprise. 

&gt; storm back to the kitchen

&gt; grab a paper towel

&gt; scoop up as much of this crap as I can hold

&gt; storm to Barfield’s lair

&gt; knock knock

&gt; Barfield doesn’t lock her door because no one ever wants to go in there

&gt; I open it and she’s sitting on her bed, eating nachos out of a mixing bowl

&gt; that’s right, a mixing bowl full of nachos

&gt; “You broke into my room.”

&gt; “I’m starving and you said I couldn’t go in the kitchen.”

&gt; “It’s pretty obvious that you were in the kitchen, too. And I doubt that you’re starving.”

&gt; show her the paper towel full of floor nacho

&gt; “That’s not mine.”

&gt; “Fuck you.”

&gt; sitting there eating a bowl full of what I just found on the floor

&gt; I know perfectly well that it’s yours

&gt; and I know that it was deliberate

&gt; so I’m over trying to be friendly and make this work

&gt; I wind up 

&gt; and I hurl the nacho grenade

&gt; full force, point blank, I wing this paper towel full of her mess right into her face

&gt; it’s all over her, her pillows, her hair, everywhere

&gt; and she’s bellowing with rage

&gt; “I will fucking sue you. I will make sure you go to fucking jail.”

&gt; “Terrific. You testify to the courtroom about that time you were eating a fucking mixing bowl full of nachos after you already killed a couple of sandwiches and a frozen pizza. They’ll have a lot of sympathy for you.” 

&gt; “Don’t you ever come near me again.” 

&gt; “Don’t you ever leave a mess like that again. If you don’t clean up after your filthy, appalling self I swear I will murder you in your sleep.” 

I went back to the kitchen, calmly cleaned up the rest of the mess, and made my pie. It was the best pie I’ve ever made. And you know what? Barfield stayed out of my way for a while. I think I might have actually scared her a little. I actually scared myself a little. But boy, did she have it coming. I’ve never been so angry. I had never threatened to hurt anyone before and I never have since, but she was just so overwhelmingly and aggressively foul. I couldn’t take it. And apparently, she was just worried enough that I might actually act on my baser impulses. 

Stay tuned for the Barfield Adventures finale! 

TL;DR: Barfield achieves new lows and I lose my cool.

My roommate, A, has a new girlfriend, K, 5'2"", 190ish. I've known A for years, he's a good guy, but as I've learned hanging out with and then living with him, he's definitely a chubby chaser.  
Normally I don't give a shit, but K is a Stage 5 clinger. Whenever he's out of the room, she gushes about him and tells me how many days they've been official now (note: yesterday was 2 weeks). Shes constantly cleaning and rearranging our shit. K is also very rude to our other roommates friends, all of whom are 7+/10, many of whom dance for a living (and look the part). When I wear a bathing suit *in my own yard* she suggests I cover up a little.  
Enough backstory: yesterday I'm hanging with A and K while I make dinner. I mention I gotta start eating better, only had X calories today. 
K laughs and says, ""Who the fuck still counts calories?""  
I'm taken aback. Wut? ""I do, K.""  
I'm sure you know what's coming. ""But diets don't work, Little0Lost! Counting calories *blah blah* starvation mode *blah blah* set weight!"" 
""I'm actually trying to gain weight, K. It's just hard for me unless I know how much I'm eating and burning."" I receive a look of pure loathing.

1375027229.0	1j7wyv	Standing at the takeout counter is Thin Privilege	CheekyScamp	596	104	84	"Last Friday was tough for me, I had two 2-hour meetings in the morning, and although we have a casual Friday dress code, I still thought I should dress up a bit since one of the meetings was with state officials.  I wore a nice pair of jeans, bone colored wedge sandals, a purple tank top with some ruffles at the hem and a nice tailored navy blazer.  I'd been working a lot that week, so my boss gave me the afternoon off.  It was a hot day and after my last meeting I took my jacket off and put it in my car.  I love having a few extra hours during the work week to myself and I used that time to run some errands, go thrift-store shopping, etc.  

I was tired and hungry after skipping lunch and a full day of walking/standing in my high heels.  I really didn't look forward to cooking, so I took the opportunity to try takeout from a little locally owned Thai restaurant..  

I walk in the restaurant and it's tiny!  There are only about 15 tables and the only other features are a door to the kitchen and an ordering counter.  This restaurant is the kind where it's all either takeout or eat from takeout containers at the provided tables, not a full-service restaurant.  There is a woman already standing at the counter, so I queue up behind her.  She's chatting with two other women who are seated at the table nearest the counter.  The woman ordering and one of the other women are slightly overweight, but the third was extremely large.  The large lady was sitting in a chair with her legs splayed wide to accommodate her belly/fupa.  Her thighs had a greater circumference than the largest part of my body, and I'm not a skinny-Minney.  Since she was sitting, I couldn't really gauge her stats, but think [this but more pear shaped](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-29064-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0#.UfU42W3lfms).

I assume that the lady at the counter is ordering for the whole table as they're talking about their orders and she keeps turning to discuss the menu.  The lady ordering keeps looking at me and smirking, I'm not not sure why, I don't look weird and although I'm wearing just a tank top it isn't really revealing.  I begin to realize that all of them are smirking and whispering about me.  Whatever, I find those types annoying but they aren't going to ruin my day or make me feel self-conscious.

The lady who was ordering finally pays (seriously, does it take 5 minutes to order Thai food?)  I order a noodle bowl, pay and sit down to wait for my food (yeah, 90 seconds for the whole transaction and I had never even been to this place before).  I start playing on my phone to pass the time, but since it's a very small restaurant I realize that those women have become even louder.  I look up to see what all the fuss is about, and it's the really fat woman practically shouting her order to the cashier while still seated at the table.  I realize that they've been snickering because *they think I cut in line*.  The lady sitting in a chair 8 feet from the counter thinks she was the next in line...  And, I realize that the 5 minutes of ordering that I suffered through wasn't food for the whole table, but food for one [not so large but probably will be soon] person.  I ended up eating half my food that night and half the next because they were very generous portions.

**Thin Privilege** is knowing how a queue at a food counter works, being able to order whilst standing up at a takeout counter queue, and making one entree last for two meals."	t5_2vzax	True
1372233773.0	1h3hcf	Hammy on holiday needs a scooter!	BaconEggSanga	579	92	112	"This is my first fat person story i have ever posted, in fact it is my first post ever on reddit and the reason i created myself a reddit account, i have been a loyal reader for quite some time but up until this afternoon i have never once experienced a fat person story first hand.


Background: i live in Australia, Adelaide area to be more precise, we have stores imaginatively called Foodland (bet you can't guess what they sell there!). This story happens in one of said stores.


&gt;Be me, 195cm's, 90 kg's (fuck yeah metric!)

&gt;not be Hamplanet American Tourist (HAT), Can't really guess at weight and height since im useless at that but she kind of looked like a slightly bigger Gina Rinehart

&gt;walk into Foodland to purchase ingredients for delicious burritos

&gt;happen to walk in just behind HAT and her 2 planetoid children 

&gt;just inside the door they stop suddenly

&gt;not paying too much attention i accidentally slam (i walk really fast) into one of her children

&gt;its like hitting a greasy soft unmoveable wall

&gt;i stumble back

&gt;get a glare and a ""Watch it!"" from planetoid child

&gt;but i digress thats not what this story is about 

&gt;HAT shrieks loudly ""where are the disability scooters!


Sorry for the break in the story but i am assuming these are the scooters everyone talks about in FPS's about Walmart and other stores in America and a few other countries, i have never in my life seen one in an Adelaide store.


&gt;I stop trying to get in to the store and start listening because i realise one of these fat person stories i read about everyday might actually be happening in front of my eyes

&gt;HAT storms (slowly waddles angrily) to the customer service desk

&gt;13 year old kid fresh from the end of school manning the desk

&gt;""Excuse me but where do you keep your mobility scooters?""

&gt;His face is all kinds of wat

&gt;""i need one for my bad knees so if they are all being used you need to call one back for me right now!""

&gt;his face is still wat

&gt;finally registers what she is saying

&gt;""sorry ma'am i dont think we have mobility scooters""

&gt;WHAT! WHAT KIND OF STORE DOES NOT HAVE ANY SCOOTERS!?!? I JUST CAME OFF A PLANE ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA WITH MY 2 KIDS EXPECTING A NICE RELAXING HOLIDAY AND THE FIRST TIME I TRY TO BUY SOME FOOD THE STORE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SCOOTERS!

&gt;at this point a manager has come to save the poor kid from this ordeal

&gt;says something to her which i dont catch but it seemed to calm her down abit

&gt;""so you really dont have any scooters?""

&gt;""no sorry Ma'am""

&gt;""you know you really ought to look into getting some, it is good for people with bad health like me to be able to get around the store easier, now you have lost yourself a customer because i cant walk around your store due to my bad knees, i will have to go to the place i saw down the street i bet they have scooters.""

&gt;she waddles out of the store, 2 kids in tow.

&gt;i get ingredients, pay, and start walking home

&gt;about 10 minutes after she left the store i pass her on the other side of the street

&gt;i realise she doesnt have a car

&gt;she is walking (very slowly) to the other place down the street

&gt;the other place is a good 2kms away from the first store

&gt;I realise she will walk 2kms from one store to another but not walk around a store buying groceries without a scooter

&gt;I have no face

&gt;laugh quietly to myself because i know the other store wont have any scooters either

&gt;hurry home excitedly to post my first (and hopefully last) ever fat person story

&gt; Enter Holy Moley and Porkboy

&gt; Neither has showered since the birth of Christ and they don't care to hide it

&gt; Both talking loudly about wedding plans

&gt; Seems HM's wedding dress doesn't fit as well as it used to and she can't figure out why

&gt; Could it be because she's gained 100 lbs since they got engaged 6 months ago?

&gt; [Of fucking course not, it must be the shitty tailoring](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/nope1.gif)

&gt; Whatever, it's Ramadan, I don't judge

&gt; Keep reading Qur'an and trying to block out the musk of their sweet sweet love

&gt; Lunch is prepared, they sit down right across from me

&gt; ""HEY BMG!! Whatcha reading?""

&gt; Shit, I hoped she wouldn't see me

&gt; ""Hey HM.  I'm reading the Qur'an.""

&gt; ""Isn't that the Moozlem book?""

&gt;Porkboy asks ""Don't Moozlems blow shit up?  Are you going to blow up the store?!""

&gt; ""......no Porky, I'm not going to bomb the store.""

&gt; This confuses them, and they take a break to begin snarfing their lunch down

&gt; They're attacking those hotdogs like they insulted their mamas

&gt; [mfw a piece of hotdog flies out of their feast and hits me in the face](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yuck.gif)

&gt; Porky's done with his hotdogs and working on his chips, Holy Moley is still working on her disgusting meattubes

&gt; HM asks if I'd like a hotdog 

&gt; They may be gross, but they're sweet I guess

&gt; [tfw NO FOOD??!!?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/huh.gif)

&gt; Porky says ""You don't eat ALL DAY?  How do you do that?  Don't you get sick?""

&gt;""Nope, I'm fine.  I'm pretty hungry, but I'm doing okay.  Besides, I get to eat at sundown so it's not that bad.""

&gt; HM interjects, ""No, that's not healthy!  You really need to eat!  Here, have one of my hot dogs!""

&gt;""No thank you, HM.  I appreciate it, but I'm fasting for religious reasons.""

&gt;""YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT!!  You Moozlems are gonna kill yourselves with not eating!  It's so bad for you!  You should just embrace your lord and savior Jesus Christ and you can eat whatever you want!""

&gt; ""Really, no thank you.  Muslims do embrace Jesus as a Prophet, but that still means I'm not eating for Ramadan.""

&gt; Porkboy joins in, ""You really should eat something.  Not eating will give you diabetes.  That's how I got it, but mine's all better now that I eat whatever I want!""

This is a short one folks, sorry! But I thought you'd like it anyway.

As I've stated previously, I fucking love all of my fellow employees with the exception of RW. This week I was speaking with a lady who's been with our store nearly since it opened, and she regaled me with stories about RW when she first came to the store.

We shall call this employee S. She's an older lady, one of the grumpy kinds, and I fucking love her.

&gt; Normal sized woman, future RW is hired by the store

&gt; Assigned to jewelry department

&gt; Generally good with customers, generally nice person

&gt; Gradually starts gaining weight

&gt; Started out at about 150lbs 5'11 (about 68 kg, 180 cm)

&gt; Within a year, up to 250 lbs (about 113 kg)

&gt; Coworkers show concern

&gt; Future RW blows them off ""I'm just eating better because I can afford it now that I have a job.""

&gt; RW comes to work one day crying

&gt; Coworkers show concern

&gt; RW ""My doctor says I might be diabetic because of my size! I just don't know what to do!""

&gt; She also goes into detail about her lady cycle and uterus and possibly needing a hysterectomy

&gt; For the next month, RW does her best to eat well and exercise, in hopes to turn her life around from dat beetus

&gt; Loses about 30 lbs, complimented by coworkers on her hardwork

&gt; Tests come back from the doctor

&gt; No signs of diabetes, uterus is fine

&gt; RW ""I'm so glad I don't need to watch my diet anymore. That was so hard!""

&gt; In the next ten years RW balloons to 450 lbs (about 204 kg) and turns into a fucking monster that is deemed eligible for customer service.

&gt;Be 22 year old, 6'4, 200lb man married to a 5'5, 120lb, 24 year old woman.

&gt;At our newly opened cupcake shop. Wife is running the front end, I'm assembling some new fixtures new employee girl is in the back decorating cupcakes.

&gt;Second week of running new business, still don't have card machines of any kind

&gt;Still buying fixtures, front end of the shop is bare bones, huge ""CASH ONLY"" sign on front door.

&gt;Be standing in a corner, bolting a tabletop to a wall for some seating.

&gt;Suddenly my bolts and screws start vibrating off the tabletop. 

&gt;Entire store shudders. I assume a storm is starting, because it's been dark and cloudy all day.

&gt;Enter the hamily

&gt;Mommy ham comes in first. Easily 350lbs+ wearing denim short shorts, a pink tank top and aviator sunglasses. She has one of those [stupid multi-colored short razor haircuts](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cn8FzdNuCmY/TVzXBURwZcI/AAAAAAAAAEU/bnx1_9ZohYU/s1600/short+emo+hairstyle+%25283%2529.jpg) that you only really see on emo high school girls and southern hams.

&gt;Ham Daddy comes in, he's not as big as Ham Mommy, but that's like saying Mars isn't that big compared to Jupiter. He's wearing slacks and a button up shirt. I assume he's just gotten off work, because it's like 5:30pm. He's wheezing like a malfunctioning chainsaw. His face is red, pockmarked and dripping with sweat.

&gt;Ham son (henceforth referred to as fatty ding dongs, or FDD for short) comes in. He's dressed like Batman. Literally, it looks like he's wearing a Batman Halloween costume, except instead of being a human shaped Batman, he's a bowling ball shaped one. He's probably about 7 years old.

&gt;StickSon comes in. He's maybe 12 years old. He's dressed in generic kid clothes. Pikachu shirt, cargo shorts. He's super skinny, and wears thick glasses. He's playing with a magnifying glass, and as soon as he gets in, he uses it to start examining a decoration on the shop's wallpaper.

&gt;Ham daughter comes in. She's 16 and gunning for Ham Mommy's position as largest thing in the solar system. She looks like a younger clone of ham mommy.

&gt;Ham mommy asks questions about each of the 18 kinds of cupcakes the store offers. Most of the questions are ""What kind is this?"", which is irritating, because everything is clearly labeled, but my wife handles it nicely, because honestly answering the same question over and over, even when the info is clearly displayed is just part of this industry.

&gt;Ham Mommy picks two dozen cupcakes. My wife pulls them out of the display and boxes them. Turns out that these cupcakes are JUST for Ham Mommy.

&gt;Ham Daddy steps up the the plate and asks EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTIONS about everything, plus some extras he's thought up. Finally starts picking cupcakes, gets two dozen. Wife takes them out of the case, boxes them and rings them up. He wants specific ones of each kind, so like 15 minutes is spent just in him deciding stuff like that he wants the 3rd Strawberry Mojito cupcake from the top.

&gt;Ham Daughter picks a dozen without asking any questions. All she wants is plain chocolate. Wife takes them out of the case and boxes them.

&gt;FDD starts on his arduous journey to pick a dozen cupcakes, by delegating to Ham Mommy what he wants. I swear he has the Downs or something, because it takes him like an 30 minutes to pick 3 cupcakes. His mom then picks the rest at random while he sits on the floor crying and shouting incomprehensibly.

&gt;Ham Mommy calls out to StickSon ""Whaddayawawnt?"". StickSon replies ""Do they have Chocolate milk?"" I start ""Sure do you..."" Ham mommy interrupts ""doya have chocolate melk?"". ""Sure, do you want the premade bottled kind, or do you want me to make you some with chocolate syrup and [insert name of locally famous dairy here] milk?"". ""Bottled is fine"".

&gt;Wife rings up their bill. Cupcakes are $4 ea, and they got six dozen, plus a drink. With tax, that's like $300. Wife and I are the happiest Jews in Jew town.

&gt;Ham mommy digs around in her purse and then whips out an EBT card. Ham offers it to wife.

&gt;""Ma'am, we can't take that. We're cash only at the moment,"". The world stands still, so does time and space. 

&gt; Then came the ham war-cry, louder than a a thousand trains

&gt;""YOU HAFTA TAKE IT THAT'S THE LAW!!""

&gt;""No ma'am, businesses can decide to accept EBT or not, and we don't have any card machines at all right now.""

&gt;""YOU HAFTA TAKE IT IT'S ILLEGAL NOT TO!!!""

&gt;""Ma'am, stop shouting please. Even of we did take EBT, we can't right now. We have no card readers at all""

&gt;"" DON'T FUCKING TELL ME NOT TO YELL!! IF YOU DON'T TAKE EBT YOU CAN'T SELL FOOD IT'S ILLEGAL NOTTA TAKE EBT!! I'M CALLIN' THE COPS""

&gt;HamDaddy tries to talk HamMommy into just leaving, but she refuses to let the injustice of not getting taxpayer funded cupcakes go unanswered. HamMommy whips out an iPhone and calls the cops. Says we threatened her and called her fat.

&gt;""THEY'RE ON THE WAY""..... good.

&gt;Police cruiser actually shows up. Cop comes in and wants to know what's going on. I explain situation to the cops. HamMommy goes on another rant about how not accepting EBT is illegal. Cop pretty much laughs at her and tells her to GTFO

&gt;On the way out the door HamMommy shrieks ""FUCK YOU WE'RE NEVER COMING BACK""..... good!

&gt;Wife spends the next 30 minutes unboxing and putting cupcakes back in the display."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; Sunday was the most beautiful day of the weekend. It’s around 30c (86f) in the shade, light breeze, little humidity but not noticeable, not a cloud in the sky.

&gt; I walk over to my car to see everything drying pretty well. The girls had picked up a huge bowl and some [rice for my laptop]( http://lifehacker.com/5435480/testimonial-rice-resurrects-even-the-most-soaked-of-gadgets) so it was drying in that.

&gt; We had our phones turned off because this was the agreement, no communication with the outside world during the weekend. It was one item still in my car that didn’t get soaked because I had put it in the center console and forgotten about it. *score*

&gt; Go about the rest of our day. Cleaning up our site and restoring it back to the condition we found it in. Cooking lunch, swimming, enjoying each other’s company; the initial idea for this weekend. Success!

&gt; It’s around 6pm and we all start making our way back home. It’s about a 2.5 hr drive from Sandbanks to home. My car is still drenched and will need a shit tonne of detailing and cleaning to get this musty smell out. My gf and I open our windows and hit the road. She offered to drive so I sat back in my seat and took my shoes off. Ready for my bed.

&gt; I decide to turn my phone on when we’re on the highway. Mistake. Should have thrown it into the river.

&gt; GhasFa had called a bunch of times and left me a bucket load of messages. She had called EVERYONE and done the same.

&gt; “HEY IDGYGDI, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?” and “Why won’t any of you answer my calls? Why does it keep going straight to voicemail?”

She was damn well aware of the rule. Phones OFF all weekend.

&gt; We get home to see her car in the driveway. Her car is there but she isn’t and my front door is open. Remembering that a few friends know where I hide my spare key *for emergencies only* I figure this must be it and switch into rage-mode.

&gt; “GhasFa, hello?” I say as she comes around the corner with a popsicle in her hand. “What the fuck are you doing here? How did you get in?”

There will be no tee-hees in this story. Only snort-laughs which she actually does.

&gt; “none of you were answering my calls so I came home to make sure you got home. Oh, and I helped myself to a bit of food. I hope you don’t mind.” Enter the snort-laugh.

&gt; “How did you know where the key was hidden?” to which she replied “The door was open, I thought you were home.”

My door is never open. I lock it as soon as I get home and it locks after I leave. It’s magic! (It’s actually one of those dead-bolts that lock as soon as you close it. Tumbler for a handle on the inside, key on the outside. You have to literally unlock it as you open the door or it will not open.)

&gt; “Bullshit. Get the fuck out of my house!”

&gt; After kicking her out, I go to grab a beer from the fridge. She has eaten ALL OF THE FOOD that I had in there. Left all of the veggies, but has cleaned me out of everything else. What the hell?

&gt; I check outside my house and she was still in my driveway... I run out and stop her from leaving. I ask her how long she was at the house for. She answers “Oh, only a couple minutes”. My blood is starting to boil at this point.

&gt; “Are you kidding me? My fridge is EMPTY. It WAS full but it isn’t anymore. What the fuck? You want to tell me again how long you were here for?”

&gt; “I came here yesterday after camping and was waiting for you. I wanted to apologize for leaving your window open.”

&gt; “So you come over here, eat all my food and had I not noticed, you would have just left and never apologized or paid me back for ANYTHING?”

&gt; “Well....” This is where she stuttered, tripped over her words, fumbled for about 5 seconds before I cut her off. “I never want to see you around here again. You are not welcome here. Get the fuck out of my sight”

When someone pisses me off as bad as she did or does a completely illogical thing, I give them a chance to redeem themselves and then they are on my bad list forever.

&gt; I go back in the house and that’s the end of my weekend.

&gt; I take my car to get it detailed on Monday and it ends up costing me over $300 bones. That plus food on the weekend and food from my house, I sent her a bill for nearly $600 bucks.

&gt; A week goes by and my lovely gf calls her up and asks her if she got it. GhasFa says “No”. I’ve sent it to her three email accounts; she should have gotten it by now. Obviously has. Whatever. I’m good friends with her brother so I send it to him, explain our situation and ask him a favour. He complies and goes after her.

&gt; Fast forward yet another week. Haven’t heard anything. I talk to her brother about it again and ask him why it’s taking her so long to even talk to one of us about it. He says that she said she did. I tell him that she hasn’t yet and HE goes into rage-mode and spills everything:

&gt; Over the past week, her brother has been fighting with her. Saying “Why would you do that to IDGYGDI? I introduced you to him so don’t make shit awkward for me. You fucked up, pay the guy back!”

Back-story, her brother and I went to school together. Him and I are very good friends. He introduced GhasFa to me and I introduced her to the group.

&gt; FF two more weeks and I finally get a cheque in the mail. We still make fun of it a year later. GhasFa is still around but avoids all eye-contact with me because she knows I’ll eye-stab her or make her spontaneously combust.

FUCK, I’m done.

[Retail Whale: The Mating Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dimcd/retail_whale_the_mating_part_1/)

So the Whale and Jonah have been dating at this point for perhaps two weeks. I haven't caught sight of this elusive boyfriend in the flesh yet, but some of my coworkers have. To start, I shall provide you with some of their commentary.

G is an older woman, in her 70s. She's worked her entire life and is a complete bad ass.

&gt; ""He looks like death warmed over.""

L is a woman in her 50s who holds down two jobs and is just a sweetheart in general.

&gt; ""He has the personality of a broom stick with worse teeth.""

B is a younger guy in his 20s, who is generally pissed off at life.

&gt; ""I saw them making out one day and I just couldn't look away. It was like a train wreck. At first I couldn't tell if they were kissing or she was trying to eat his face.""

A is another older lady, who like G, tells it like it is.

&gt; ""They seem like the perfect couple to me. Anyone who can put up with RW's bullshit is either a saint or on drugs. Let's just hope his prescription doesn't run out.""

(I really, really, really love most of my coworkers)

The day finally comes when I see this hunk of man meat in the flesh. He's maybe 6 ft (about 182 cm) and skinny as a fucking rail. I can't even begin to guess his weight. He's so skinny that his skin is sagging on his face and arms. He looks like he might've been a previous fatty with how loose his skin is.

&gt;A wild Jonah approaches!

&gt;Not sure how to treat him, might as well be nice

&gt; Dat retail smile

&gt; ""Hi, you must be Jonah!""

&gt; Dude looks right at me and doesn't respond

&gt; Completely expressionless with dead eyes

&gt; Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeirdo

&gt; Hear a great splashing in the distance!

&gt; lol no, that's just RW's gut

&gt; RW ""JOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAH!""

You know that classic cheesy romantic scene of two people in love running at each other in slow motion through a field of flowers? This was exactly like that except only one of them was running. The other is standing still, dead to the world.

&gt; RW takes him in her might fins and mashes her face into his

&gt; I guess that's how whale's kiss?

Please keep in mind that this is a busy store with customers all around and she's still in uniform.

&gt; Eventually she surfaces for air only to begin spewing love for her fiance

&gt; He is still not responding

&gt; Think he might be in a coma but somehow still capable of walking

&gt; RW ""We need to go get some food in you, Jonah! And I wouldn't mind a little something in me, teehee...""

&gt; OH GOD NO

&gt; DID SHE JUST INSINUATE WHAT I THINK SHE DID?

&gt; RW ""I've never known how... electric love can be before last night. It was my first time and you were just so gentle and loving, tee hee.""

&gt; OH GOD SHE DID

&gt; VOMIT PLZ

&gt; RW ""I've been telling Viza that she needs to eat more or else she'll never keep her man happy. Isn't that right, Jonah.""

&gt; Jonah mumbles something. Maybe he's a zombie. A zombie that eats fat instead of brains.

&gt; RW chortles, ""See? I told you, Viza. *Real* men want a woman they can grab on to. You're just so masculine and bony. You really need to fill out your curves so you can get a better man than your boyfriend. He's obviously just with you because he has self esteem issues.""

&gt; ""RW, I have customers. Can you take your tonsil hockey somewhere else? You're scaring the children.""

&gt; RW glowers a bit

&gt; ""Please don't make me call a manager. Again.""

I had called the manager earlier that day to tell them that she had taken an hour and a half long break after her hour lunch, so they were already pretty pissed at her.

&gt; RW ""Ugh! Fine. Come on Jonah, let's go eat and then go... *play*.""

&gt; Must not vomit in front of customers, must not vomit in front of customers

&gt; Jonah mumbles something

&gt; RW as she's leaving ""Tee hee, I know. She's such a bossy little bitch, isn't she? She thinks she can just run everyone's life!""

Now, A was with me through most of this interaction. She already made a joke about the fucker being on drugs. We converse quietly in between customers.

&gt; A ""Holy shit, that man is stoned out of his head. I don't even think he realizes what he's gotten into.""

&gt; ""He might when he's crushed to death in bed.""

&gt; A ""I do not need that mental image repeated, Viza. I prefer to keep my food in my stomach, thank you.""

&gt;
&gt;Decide to take my little sister (LS) to Mcderps

&gt;
&gt;Sister is only 12, tiny lil' girl, no more than 70 pounds

&gt;
&gt;Get to fast food place, awesomecuteguy tags along (ACG)

&gt;
&gt;Wowitsprettypacked 

&gt;
&gt;Order, sit down at a booth

&gt;pretty close to the line

&gt;
&gt;ACG goes on the 
playground with LS while I wait for our food

&gt;
&gt;What was that

&gt;
&gt;Ground starts shaking, light fixtures flickering, little kids hiding in the playground

&gt;
&gt;Earthquake??

&gt;
&gt;Nope just Fat Makeup Lady (FML) (see what I did there)

&gt;
&gt;Smells of shit and cat piss

&gt;
&gt;looks like a clown with all her makeup, upon closer inspection looks like she just layers it on eachother instead of washing face eachtime

&gt;
&gt;Probably weighs 350+

&gt;
&gt;She waddles into line, out of breath

&gt;
&gt;orders 3 bigmacs, a milkshake, 2 large fries and 20 mccnuggets

&gt;
&gt;astonished.gif

&gt;
&gt;at this point LS and ACG are back at booth

&gt;
&gt;ACG leaves to go to restroom

&gt;
&gt;I'm on my phone, little sister playing DS

&gt;
&gt;When FML waddles over

&gt;FML: ""THAT'S TOO FAH, I GOYTA SIT CLOWSE CUZ AIH GAWT

&gt;

&gt;wait for it

&gt;

&gt;A CINDISHION""

&gt;

At this point I'm getting pretty fed up, then LS pipes up.

&gt;

&gt;LS: ""We're not moving""

&gt;
&gt;FML flips out, starts screaming about respecting your elders, how we need to get up, called her a brat repeatedly.

&gt;
&gt;Could of easily walked to other booth multiple times by now

&gt;
&gt;""Hey, calm down. And don't talk to my sister like that.""

&gt;
&gt;""I CAN DOO WHAT I WANT..HGRG....YOU SKINNY SLUTS...GRRLGH...THINK YOU CAN BOSS EVERYONE ROUND""

&gt;
&gt;mfw she's forcing us to move so she doesn't have to walk 12 feet

&gt;
&gt;Our number is called

&gt;
&gt;ACG comes back, I explain situation

&gt;
&gt;Me: ""Can you watch the booth while I get our food?""

&gt;
ACG: ""Yeah no problem""

&gt;
&gt;As soon as I get up FML sits in my spot

&gt;
&gt;Me: ""WHAT THE HELL""

&gt;
&gt;""WAS DIS SEAT TAKEN? TEEHEE, MY BAD""

&gt;

I'm beyond pissed now, I leave to get our food. ACG filled me in on this part.

&gt;

&gt;I come back with food

&gt;
&gt;wut

&gt;

LS is visibly uncomfortable with FML sitting across from her, she says this:

&gt;LS: ""No he doesn't. You're fat and you smell. My sister is pretty and the fact you call yourself a woman is funny. Get out of the booth before I start screaming""

&gt;
&gt;""WHAT HOW CAN YOU SAY DAT YOU NASTY BRAT""

&gt;Me: ""THAT IS IT. I'M DONE. I'M GETTING MANAGMENT.""

Taking the monsters to flag football. GoTeamGo! After practice I take my monsters plus two friends for ice cream. A sweetheart little black girl that is in love with my oldest (they’re 6) and her brother who plays soccer (he’s 9). Love these kids, awesome friends. 
  

 McBeetus it is! Get 4 cones, send the kids to sit. Angel Monsters with excellent listening skills. Wait for my coffee.   


The door flies open. A wave of sweat, cigarettes defeat and shame slinks in. STFU! A wild Koffing appears!   


She’s huge. In her 20’s. Must be upper 200’s/lower 300’s range. Bleached blond hair with dark greasy roots, bad skin and a pair of pajama shorts that are begging for mercy over her lumpy hips and ass. 
  AvertYourEyesKids.   
A way too small once-white tank top barely contains her huge sagging breasts. Her gut has escaped and covers the front of her pajama shorts.   


As she whips her greasy hair around, sending stray fake blond strands all over, she PUTS HER GUT ON THE COUNTER. I make a choking sound and she gives me a sneer. Proceeds to order 2 double quarter pounder meals with a vanilla and chocolate shake. Hurry too, my blood sugar is low she snarks.  
  

Momma Ze is not skinny by any means. I’m 5’3 and pretty heavy. Dat Xbox and beers. But I’ve certainly never decided to set my gut on something, let alone set it free in public.
  

“Excuse me” I said assertively, “Can you please take your stomach off the counter. Food goes on there.”  She turns to eye me up.  



“Fuck off trailer trash” she garbbles at me. She pulls a phone out of the crevice of cleavage and glares at me. Crumbs fall everywhere. YUCK. I glance back at the kids. They’ve grown quiet. They sense a disturbance in suburbia.   


“Excuse me” I say again sweetly. “Please take your gut off the counter” my eyes narrowing. The tiny cashier tries to speak. I smile a fake smile and begin to wonder where the fuck my iced coffee is. 

“NO!” she turns to me, her enormous gut slithering off the counter.
“JUST CUZ I AM A WOMAN WHO IS PROUD OF MAH BODY YU AIN’T DUN MEAN YU TELL MEH HOW TA ACT~!~!~!~!” she whips her nasty hair around again.   

I hold my ground and my temper firmly. Not only are my kids there, my kids’ friends are there. The worker who has finally completed putting coffee in a cup with ice and a pump of caramel syrup reluctantly places it on the counter for me. I begin to walk away as my youngest kiddo looks scared. As I turn she snarls “Fucking nigger lover”.  

Rage consumes me. My sons’ friends have heard this woman. The girl begins to cry. Her brother looks like a mix between rage and sadness.  

PIKACHU USES QUICK ATTACK!  

“You’re pitiful” I say evenly to the beast. She has her phone out and claims to be recording me and how I’m ashamed of my body and taking it out on her. WUT.   

I herd the kids towards my 2010 Ford Explorer. Hop in kids, let’s watch a movie I say, comforting the little girl. I give her and her brother a hug. Tell them I’m sorry for how rude people are. Hug and love everywhere. Thanks Momma Ze! Uh oh kids, I forgot something inside. Stay here and watch SpongeBob.   

Stalk back inside. Find the gassy blob in a booth, skin spilling on, under and over the table. She’s on her phone talking about how she told some fat bitch off. Apparently I'm trashy too. yeahokwhatever.  


PIKACHU USED THUNDER!!!    


I throw my caramel iced coffee as hard as I can at her. 
“You ignorant fucking cunt” I start, getting closer to her. Soon I am inched away from her fat pasty face. Beady black eyes look like raisins in rising bread dough. Mouth quivers. Phone drops. My finger is now pointed directly against her greasy head.
“I fucking hope you get hit by a bus you stupid slob” I snap, jabbing her forehead with each word, “You racist stupid bitch. Don’t you EVER *jab jab* say another goddamn thing to me or my friends or I’ll ruin you. HEAR ME???? RUIN YOU”. I grab my empty cup and throw it in the trash as I walk away. The rage slowly subsides. Tears burn my eyes. I squeak out an apology to the McBeetus workers who will have to clean up my mess.   
 

Get in the car. Kids have seen the whole thing. I’m ashamed. I begin to apologize for acting like that. Hold in the tears. The 9 year old says very matter of factly “Miss Ze, some white folk be crazy. It’s ok. Don’t let ‘em getcha down.” I smile and thank him.  


We get home and swim in the pool. Tons of fun being had. Eat grilled chicken for dinner. It’s gonna be ok.

I work at a medium size (about 60 people) company, and everyone here is pretty much awesome people. Nice, smart, gets along and believes in our company. I'm the IT guy, and almost always have no complaints. Users are smart, honest about fucking their shit up, and don't bullshit me.

Except Hamthony.

Hamtony is a... I don't really know the specs. I'd say 5'8, and brushes both sides of the doorways when he gets into work. Roughly spherical, but jolly. He's always been constantly nice to me, but nobody on his teams seems to get along with him. I always just chalked it up to the fact that he has the fat person fermenting yeast smell, though his isn't that bad compared to crazy people I've seen on the bus system.

Today when I got into work the Fire Alarm started blaring almost immediately. The hallway was filed with light smoke and a super foul smell, so everyone files out pretty fast. Once outside everyone looks pretty pissed, since it's 10am and several bagels were interrupted. 

Firefighters are just next door and the fire is out in maybe ten minutes. Turned out Hamthony's computer had caught fire, scorching the underside of his desk and surrounding carpet. They said the smell was mostly from that (makes sense) and the...unexpected accelerants present at his desk (asked fire fighter for clarification, his response: ""Someone's been splashing enough grease on that desk that they could have eaten it and thought it was a burger"")

The reason for the fire? Well, for a long time Hamthony had a snack bowl at his desk, for 'sharing', which mostly meant he would buy those ten lb packs of assorted candy on Amazon, fill the bowl, and eat it at about a ten pieces in, one piece shared ratio.

Coworker asked him to hide it for a week since he was trying to watch his weight, and Hamthony complied.

By apparently opening his computer, and hiding it all in there.

It managed to run fine the first day he did this, so he must have figured it was going to be a great hiding place. He left his computer on overnight, and at some point apparently a tootsie roll or other snack managed to melt/fuse with the CPU fan.

Result: FWOOSH.

When Hamthony came in, he was beyond mortified at pretty much every aspect. He massively apologized, replaced the computer himself, and used it as a turning point from what I can tell. I still don't talk to him now, but his candy bowl is now a fruit bowl, and I have seen him biking to and from the gym on his lunch break. 

I think he's going to make it =)"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;nighttime, ~9pm

&gt;walk inside after finding a parking spot

&gt;decide to go lift before I run

&gt;walk upstairs to the weight room which oversees the indoor pool area (it's a big gym)

&gt;see two whales thrashing in the only two hot tubs below

&gt;whale1 looks to be atleast 300lbs, 5' 5""

&gt;whale2 is massive, ~400lbs 5' 0""

&gt;watch from afar as they seem to force out anyone who tries to enter their domain

&gt;this includes 2 little kids who try to get into whale1's hot tub

&gt;the kids are in the hot tub for what appears to be 10 seconds before whale1 starts thrashing

&gt;splashes (more like whailmer used surf) water on kids and appears to be shouting at them (I cannot hear what
 she says as I am only watching in horror from behind a glass wall) 
&gt;cannotbelievemyeyes.pic

&gt;not much later I finally finish lifting after awhile and decide to go for a run around the gym track, which is outside

&gt;go back downstairs, grab a gatorade from a vending machine,  then continue through the male dressing room and out to the indoor pool area as it was the only way to get outside

&gt;hear them talking about the previous incident

&gt;""EH CANNUT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THOSE -wheeze- LITTLE SHITS""

&gt;whale2 agrees saying something along the lines of ""MMMHMMM PARENTS THESE DAYS NEED TO TEACH THEIR KIDS SUM -wheeze- MANNURS""

&gt;sigh and go to the door shaking my head

On a side note: Since it was late, the doors leading outside automatically lock when closed and unless opened from the inside, there is no other way in than through the front.

&gt;knowing this I strategically place my gatorade in such a way that I will be able to get back inside later

&gt;go running for awhile and leave to go back inside as i was tired

1368910139.0	1elfbj	Traveling with Lipid	carboxcylicacid	598	113	108	"I'm back to continue the story of my hammy high school friend, who will now be known as Lipid. Joining us will be Styrene and Ketone.

[Eine](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1c2v7e/hamplanet_needs_electrolytes/)

Lipid and I are both about 5'2. Right now I weight 110 lbs, probably was the same back then. I don't know Lipid's weight, but I do know she is about 4 feet wide when laying down

...I may have measured her after she passed out at a party 

My senior year of high school (2009) we had the chance to experience FREEDOM in DC with millions of other 'Muricans. More importantly we were excused from midterms. 

&gt;Be on the bus

&gt;Too god damn early

&gt;Sitting with Styrene and Ketone, waiting to head to the east coast

&gt;Bus suddenly lurches to the right

&gt;Everyone thrown to the side of the bus

&gt;Lipid heaves herself on

&gt;Has to take a break, can hear her wheezing all the way in the back

&gt;She squeezes her way back to us, mouth breathing the entire way

&gt;""WHOSE READY FOR A ROAD TRIP!!!!!!!!!""

&gt;She must be happy she gets a jump start on today's caloric intake

&gt;She's lugging a body bag behind her

&gt;oh, nope, just a duffle bag

&gt;Styrene begins to move toward the window seat

&gt;We all know better than to give Lipid the window seat

&gt;Lipid slams into Styrene, giving her a concussion against the wall and then suffocating her under mounds of curves

&gt;Her ass is still halfway into the aisle

&gt;She struggles to get the body bag onto her lap

&gt;Styrene tells her she could put that under the bus

&gt;Lipid musters the sassiest tone possible ""Ummm I know, I need this. AND whyyyy do you care?"" 

&gt;We roll our eyes and let it go

&gt;Lipid takes note of Styrene, Ketone and I drinking Ice Capps

&gt;Thank you Canada

&gt;""GUISE, DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD THOSE ARE? THERE'S SO MUCH SUGAR AND FAT IT'S DISGUSTING""

&gt;Technically true, but the three of us are on some kind of sports team, and it's five in the morning so suck my non-existent dick

Now, Lipid tried every diet known to man through high school. Each week is a new one. She would lose 5 pounds, go off the diet because ""It worked!"" and then immediately gain 10 pounds. This week was some diet which requires you to eat each of the food groups in one meal.

&gt;Lipid pulls out her breakfast from her body bag

&gt;A Package of sausage links she cooked, a mountain of scrambled eggs covered in cheese, two bagels with cream cheese and butter, and a kiwi

&gt;She devours her prey in about 5 minutes

&gt;It was both awesome and terrifying

&gt;""Ugh I don't understand how you guys can stay sooooo skinny without dieting. You're so lucky""

&gt;I have no face when I realize that was her restraining herself

The next few hours of driving was uneventful. We all passed out for a while and then it was regular teenage girl boring bullshit. Until we stopped for lunch...

&gt;At a roadside plaza

&gt;I get a kids meal from Beetus King

&gt;I join my group, and fury wells up in Lipid's piggy little eyes

&gt;""OH MUH GAHDNESS, THAT IS SO FREAKING BAD FOR YOU, I CAN'T EVEN. UUUUUGGGGGHHHHH""

&gt;She proceeds to tell me all about the dangers of saturated fats

&gt;Her arguments tended to be stating outrage then making frustrated sounds without providing reasoning or explanation 

&gt;""BESIDES, THAT ISN'T EVEN GOING TO FILL YOU UP, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD IN THERE, NO WONDER YOU'RE SO TINY, YOU STARVE YOURSELF""

&gt;Basically I'm anorexic, but I'm going to get diabetes anyway. Yeah.

&gt;Styrene and Ketone have adult sized burgers and fries and Lipid looses her mind

&gt;""I really want to make you all diet plans. If any of you want it, just let me know""

&gt;Let's take a look at her lunch, shall we?

&gt;Three servings of orange chicken, two servings of fried rice, and a gas station pretzel with two servings of cheese

&gt;Gotta get all food groups in somehow

&gt;mfw she covered her fried rice in the cheese

&gt;and then scooped the cheesey-rice with her pretzel

&gt;She inhales it all before I finish mine and then waddles off to use the bathroom

&gt;The rest of us roll our eyes, finish eating and head back to the bus

&gt;Ketone tells us that while we were asleep, Lipid was inhaling her snacks 

&gt;We look into her bag and she has several boxes of Special K bars, two boxes of cereal, dozens of party sized chip and pretzel bags and 5 liters of diet (lol) soda, two dozen slim fast shakes, and a million packages of gummy candy

We decided to pretend to nap for a half hour after lunch to see if she would keep it up. She drank two slim fast shakes and ate half a box of cereal while reading her romance novel. I don't think she even realized what she was doing, she just mindlessly fed. After we 'woke up' she continued eating but at a slower pace, probably because she was talking so much. When we arrived at our hotel she kept commenting on how she was getting stronger from her workouts because her bag was so much lighter than when she packed it. We witnessed her workout that night in the hotel pool. It was...sad.

&gt;Grumpy after a 12 hour bus ride

&gt;Get changed for hotel pool, stop at Styrene and Lipid's room to get them

&gt;Lipid is wearing a sari for some reason

&gt;""NO GUYS, It's a swim dress. I don't want to seem like I want every guys attention^TeeHee""

&gt;Not sure if all this eye rolling is making our eyes stronger, or putting too much strain on them

&gt;We head down to the pool where Lipid announces she needs a lane to be kept clear so she can exercise

&gt;Give her half the pool, and goof off in the other half

&gt;Suddenly, she floats in between us 

&gt;""GUYS I JUST NEED ONE LANE, COME ON""

&gt;Tell her to stand up and look around

&gt;""Sorry, I'm not used to this pool^TeeHee""

&gt;She goes back into her lane and we get into the hot tub and watch her

&gt;Lipids exercise routine is just her floating aimlessly in the pool, kicking once every few minutes and only using her arms if she gets too close to the side

&gt;She gets out and demands we find an ice cream place to reward her for staying on track during this trip

&gt;Unfortunately for her curves it was 11 pm in February so she had to settle for what was left in her body bag

This is longer than I thought, so I'll continue in a bit with how all hell broke loose in D.C. after Lipid couldn't eat for 5 whole hours.

1370956028.0	1g49gs	Law &amp; Order: FPS, Episode 3	blinkypinkyinky	602	119	76	"*In the American obesity lifestyle, fatlogic is defended by two separate but equally important groups: the lazy fats, who can't be bothered to control their behavior, and the activist fats, who provide justifications and excuses. These are their stories.*

**doinkdoink**

Open on an airport gate area.  

In one row of seats close to the walkway, a group of four college students is chatting companionably, next to a petite woman reading a picture book to her toddler, and a suit-wearing man who is deeply fascinated by something on his Blackberry.

Two new passengers, a man and a woman, approach.  The woman is moderately obese, with a large purse slung over her shoulder and a bag of fast food in one hand. but she would not look out of place at a typical all-you-can-eat buffet line.  

Her husband, however, is extraordinary.  

His slacks are taut and shiny over thighs which are at least twice the diameter of a typical human waist.  These trousers are held up over his ballooning stomach by suspenders that could easily serve for tying down a zeppelin.  His shirt is damp with perspiration, and the number of chins which emerge above the soaked collar could be counted on two hands.  There are even rolls of ankle fat drooping over the tops of his shoes. 

""Can you get up?"" the zeppelin-man asks brusquely. 

The students look up in confusion.  There are many other seats empty in this gate area. 

""Can you get up *please*?"" he repeats, exasperated.

Seeing the man's size, the student on the end decides to get up, probably thinking that this fellow's reddening face does suggest that he needs to sit down before he has a heart attack.

""Good god, why are young people so disrespectful?"" the wife chimes in, glaring at the other students.  ""Are you just going to sit there when people need those seats?"" 

A second student stands, obviously miffed, but also surprised enough by this behavior to go along with it out of polite reflex.

The woman raises her eyebrows at the remaining two students and purses her lips expectantly. 

Oh.  They want *all* the seats. 

""Seriously?"" asks one of the students, incredulous.  ""Forget it, let's just go over there,"" says another.  ""There are plenty more seats,"" she adds pointedly.  

The students get up and move to another row. 

Mr. Zeppelin sits down across two of the seats with satisfaction, dropping his duffle bag onto a third.  Mrs. Zeppelin wedges into the remaining seat, next to the businessman, and produces something greasy from the fast food bag so that they can replenish the calories they expended on this helpful etiquette lesson.

**doinkdoink**

Some time has passed, and the gate area has filled up considerably.  This will be a full flight.  

The businessman's phone rings.  He answers it, but realizes the area is far too loud to hear well, so he gets up and walks to a quieter corner to speak.  Mrs. Zeppelin immediately places her purse on the empty seat.

The businessman returns.  Mrs. Zeppelin pretends not to notice him.  

""Excuse me,"" says the businessman, nodding at the seat.

""Sorry, it's taken,"" says Mrs. Zeppelin, apparently pretending that he hadn't been sitting there two minutes before.

Before the businessman has time to recover from his surprise, the gate agent announces pre-boarding. 

Mr. and Mrs. Zeppelin hastily lurch to their feet and waddle-rush to the gate to demand advance boarding. 

The young mother exchanges a disbelieving look with the businessman, as she gathers up her bag and toddler to go line up with the other families traveling with small children.  

**doinkdoink**

The interior of the plane.  

Mr. and Mrs. Zeppelin could not quite manage to cut the line in front of a passenger in a wheelchair, but they are the second and third passengers to board. 

The Zeppelins make their way about half way down the plane, to the two aisle seats they have reserved across from one another.  Mr. Zeppelin wedges most of the way into his seat, although roughly a third of the aisle space is also occupied by his body, and he must clasp his hands on top of his stomach to hold his arms in enough so that others can get past him to the rear of the aircraft.  

As fortune would have it, the center and window seat next to Mr. Zeppelin are assigned to Little Mama and Tot from the boarding area. 

Mr. Zeppelin brightens when his seatmates arrive. 

""Oh good, you can hold the baby and there will be more room!"" he announces. He immediately moves his duffel bag to fit under the seat in front of the middle seat, since obviously Little Mama and Tot won't be needing their leg room, either. 

Little Mama replies, apologetically, that she cannot hold the energetic 3-year-old on her lap for such a long flight, which is why she booked the tot his own seat.  

Mr. Zeppelin is not pleased.  ""You're small, and he's small, you really don't each need a whole seat!""

Little Mama stands firm, and reminds Mr. Zeppelin that the last thing he wants is to be stuck next to a wailing kid for the whole flight.  

Mr. Zeppelin mutters unhappily but knows that he is beaten...for now.

**doinkdoink**

The flight is in the air, and the captain has turned off the Fasten Seatbelt sign.  

Suddenly, Tot announces proudly, ""I GO POTTY NOW MAMA!""  We have not yet mastered the use of our inside voice.

Little Mama congratulates him for being such a big boy and asks Mr. Zeppelin to let them out so they can visit the bathroom. 

Mr. Zeppelin is annoyed. ""You should really put a diaper on 'em when you're going to be on a flight,"" he informs her as he struggles to stand and move out of the way.

Little Mama bites her tongue and escorts Tot to the lavatory.  She is the parent of a small child, no stranger to tantrums, and she will pick her battles. 

However, when she and her son return from the bathroom, Little Mama makes a critical mistake.  As they slide back into their seats, she fails to notice that Mr. Zeppelin has put up the armrest between his seat and Tot's middle seat.  
 
When Mr. Zeppelin sits back down, his massive body spreads over to crush Tot against the inner armrest.  Tot squirms and complains.

""Sorry sir, can we put the armrest down again?"" Little Mama does not realize she has already lost this battle.

Mr. Zeppelin cannot completely hide a smug smile as he replies, ""You can put it down if you need.""  He already knows what Little Mama is just now discovering: the armrest isn't even visible any more, thanks to Mr. Zeppelin's rolls and the fact that he is no longer clasping his arms to keep them confined within the borders of his original seat.  The gap between the seats is completely hidden behind his spreading body. There is no way the armrest can be pulled down past his enormous bulk. 

Mothers have been known to lift cars off their trapped children, but no amount of adrenaline and parental love can give this poor woman the strength to budge that armrest.  

""Guess it's stuck, oh well!"" Mr. Zeppelin says cheerfully. 

Defeated, Little Mama resignedly puts up her own armrest and lets Tot snuggle against her as best he can.  

Tot is squirming and starting to whine.

Gonna be a long flight.

**doinkdoink**

Baggage claim.  Our passengers are standing around waiting for luggage, and being met by friends and family.

Little Mama and Tot spot a familiar face waiting for them, and Tot breaks into a run toward a slim man in flannel who bears a clear resemblance to the little guy. The happy father swings Tot up into the air.

Kodakmoment.sniff

But Tot has no time for this touching scene.  He has an injustice to report!

""DADDY THE BIG MAN TAKED MY *SEAT* DADDY!"" Twisting in his father's arms, Tot points to Mr. Zeppelin, who has opted to sit on the edge of the baggage claim about a foot or two away from a sign prohibiting sitting on the baggage claim.  ""THAT MAN, DADDY!  HE IS TOO BIG ON THE PLANE, DADDY!""

Daddy is about to shush his Tot, because really we mustn't point and shout, but Little Mama catches his eye.  

She has spent 4 hours crammed into what amounted to a single airplane seat with a fractious toddler who was wriggling and whining the entire trip.

Screw it, her look says.  

Let our son say what all the adults are too polite to say. 

That jerk *is* too big on the goddamn plane.

1370392800.0	1fou1u	500+ lb patient rolls over my goddamn foot in a 250 lb electric wheelchair.	ramen-empire	582	97	143	"I used to be a nurse, and I am not slender by any stretch of the imagination. I worked agency, and occasionally filled it at nursing homes.

At one such home, there was an exceptionally large patient--the kind we had to use a special robotic tool to get out of bed. Essentially, we would roll her, put a large canvas sheet beneath her, and then use the robotic lift to hoist her up and then into her wheel chair.

One morning, getting her up for the day, she got mad at me for not changing her radio station fast enough. A song came on she didn't like while she was in the mechanical lifter thing (the name of the damn thing is on the tip of my tongue...!). Even turning your back on the machine while someone is in it can be potentially lethal, so I got her into her chair first. A 20-second procedure, tops.

Right after I change the radio station for her, she rolls out of the room and swerves, with clear deliberation, to try to clip me. She rolls over my foot and breaks the fuck out of it.

&gt;be 15 year old me

&gt;Sophomore in highschool

&gt;in marching band, live in the library

&gt;be that kid who does math for fun and is in all the advanced classes and enrichment programs

&gt;be about 40lbs overweight and have to wear the worlds thickest glasses

&gt;draw the short stick in life and also be the poor kid. Everything I wear is from Goodwill or some other thrift shop, and this is like 8 years before Macklemore made that cool

&gt;Enter Amanda goddess of etherial beauty the actual embodiment of every single physical trait I find attractive in women somehow compacted into one person.

&gt;long, straight blonde hair, tiny waist, really wide hips (extra points for being *actual curvy* as opposed to *fat curvy*)

&gt;if I was trying to build the perfect woman, just in terms of her body, it'd look just like her.

&gt;waste 6 misguided months of sophomore year, doing everything I can to get Amanda's attention.

&gt;Learn a cruel lesson in the mechanics of the friendzone. Realize that she only wants to talk to me when she wants something (usually some form of support after the 10th not-me guy in a row has dumped her after getting to wrestle naked with her), and that she only wants to hang out with me, when she thinks I'll spend money on her. Even in that situation, she acts like I'm made of terribly stinky, radioactive cheese while I bend over backwards and buy her stuff.

&gt;Decide to stop wasting effort on a relationship where I'll be spending boyfriend levels of money, and doing boyfriend levels of work and providing boyfriend levels of emotional support, without being the boyfriend.

&gt;Next year, end up going to a different school. Get to reinvent myself, drop 40lbs, develop a minor bodybuilding hobby. Everyone at this school lives in the library so that isn't weird anymore. Acquire serious girlfriend, and full ride to college. Be happy.

&gt;Never think about Amanda again....... until

&gt;7 years later

&gt;Be 22

&gt;in the last 7 years, I finished high school, went to college, took an overload amount of classes every semester, summer and intercession to graduate with 2 degrees in 3 years

&gt;As soon as I graduate, score awesome job, start making $62k/year and get married to previously mentioned girlfriend.

&gt;Decide to derp around on facebook one day and see a friend request with Amanda's name on it. Whatever, haven't seen her in a billion years, accept friend request. 

&gt;In the time since I last saw her, she has dropped out of highschool and somehow managed to have 4 kids by 4 different guys. She's also now up to like 300lbs. Solidly in hamplanet territory, and thus I christen her, Hamanda.

&gt;Notice that her entire facebook is full of spam about how men like ""real"" women. ""Bones are for dogs. Meat is for men"" crap like that. Most of it is done in those stupid monochromatic postcard things of an irrelevant stock image. Everything else is just drunkposting, or posts about wanting to get drunk.

&gt;Have a good chuckle to myself over how her life is now, and resume not caring that she exists.

&gt;Next day, phone rings, I answer and hear in an extremely forced attempt at sounding sexy ""Hey, it's Hamanda. I'm alone right now and I've got whiskey. Want to come over and party?"" me, being confused as to how she got my number, and shocked at how she sounds over the phone, I only manage to say ""Nope"". ""Mmmmn okay, we can do this later, yeeeeah"". Sounds like she's masturbating. She hangs up.

&gt;NEXT DAY around the same time, phone rings. Answer it ""Mmmmm, I always though you were hot...."". Seriously. No greeting, just masturbation-y voice announcing that she *always* though I was hot.

&gt;Wat?

&gt;""What?"" ""Wanna party?"" ""Nope"" she is audibly shaken ""O-okay.... Maybe next time...."". I start to say ""Stop calling me"" but she hangs up before I get the full sentence out. I save her number as ""DO NOT ANSWER"", so that if she calls again, I'll recognize it.

&gt;Next day, around the same time ""DO NOT ANSWER"" calls. I blissfully ignore it. Like an hour later I get another call. It's from a number I don't recognize so I answer. 

&gt;""Hey anon. Wanna come party?"". This time it isn't the masturbation-y voice. It's a kind of pissed off, short tone. ""No I don't want to party. Please quit calling me. I'm..."" She cuts me off and in sort of a crying-yelling voice says ""YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME BECAUSE I'M FAT!! I THOUGHT YOU DIFFERENT AND THAT YOU LIKED ME FOR ME!! NOW I SEE THAT YOU'RE LIKE ALL THE OTHER MEN WHO CAN'T HANDLE A REAL WOMAN!!"" 

&gt;""Hamanda, I'm married. Even if I wasn't being fat isn't the only reason I wouldn't be interested in you. You have 4 kids and a drinking problem. We haven't spoken in 7 years, and I'm guessing that the only reason you're contacting me now, is because you've either run out of other options, or you want me to waste money on you again."" 

&gt;""FUCK YOU HOW DARE YOU FUCKING JUDGE ME!! I FUCKING HATE YOU!!!"" click. She hangs up on me.

&gt;Next day she sends a long, rambly facebook message to my wife about how I went to her place and he had sex and that now she's pregnant and is going to sue me for child support.

&gt;Best part of her message? She mentions the exact time she claims I was at her place impregnating her. During that time that day, I was in a theater watching some crappy action movie with my wife.

&gt;I block her on facebook, so does my wife.

&gt;About a week later, she sends a message to one of my friends, and to my sister claiming I raped her and that she's pregnant. It seems to be a modified copy-paste of her message about suing me for child support, except with threats of jail. She leaves in the bit where she claims it happened during a time I was at a movie.

&gt;Everyone ignores her. She fades from existence and then memory. Haven't heard from her since."	t5_2vzax	True

I just wanted to toss out a few reminders here, talk about some updates, and lastly open up for suggestions. As you might know I tend to write novels so I will try and bold the important points for you. 

***

**Reminders/rule stuff, etc...**

* If you are new to this sub, or if you just never got around to it, **read the sidebar.** There's some handy dandy rules up there along with a posting guide that should cut out any confusion. If you have questions or are unsure about something, you can always message the mods too. 

**Thin privilege posts are only for Thin Privilege Thursdays.**

* We've had a huge influx of ""thin privilege""-related posts over the past bit, along with a lot of linking straight to Tumblr. Please restrict yourself to Thursdays for these posts. I know it'll kill all your thyroids to post in moderation, but if we don't limit them the sub will be overrun with these posts. 

Also, **do not link directly to the blogs.** Screen shot the post and upload the image when possible. 

* **Harassing and attacking other members will not be tolerated.** This includes reaming a poster out because they're fat. Our fat posters are aware of themselves and 99% of them are actually using the advice and support of this sub to lose their weight and shreds of logic they may be clinging to. Attacking them isn't going to do any good and is just stupid, needless drama that no one wants to deal with. So *don't freaking do it.* **If you are attacking another member, you will be banned**. 

If you see an asshat in action, report them to the mods. 

*** 

**Update** 

* As you might have noticed, we recently edited the look of this sub. If you find any problems/see something isn't working right, please let me know and I will try to fix it. That's really just it. That, and if you have more ideas for the look and feel of the sub, feel free to suggest them, too.

*** 

**Suggestion box time**

Lastly, I want to open up the comments here for questions, concerns, and a big list of suggestions. We won't be able to make *everyone* happy but it's good to get some feedback. 

This is also where I ask you to **stop making [meta] posts about the formatting of FPSs.** Some people like greentext, some people don't... *most* people don't give a shit and like the switchup. Some people hate MFW, some people love it. Most people don't care (but seriously, don't put a million GIFs in your story, that's annoying to everyone). 

I could go on and on about the little things that have been complained about, but the end result is ALWAYS the same. Most people don't care, some like things, some don't like them. Because of this, **it's literally impossible to enforce a formatting that will make everyone happy.** 

**Use these comments to talk about your preferences**. That way they will be read over, users and new writers can see what the general preference is, and it might help out a little bit. 

**If you have suggestions or concerns you can message the mods.** That way we can deal with it directly instead of having to wade through a million [meta] posts.

Hopefully that's everything, if I've missed something I'll make an edit. 

You all keep being awesome though, eh? Thanks for subbing and all of the crazy contributions. I can't believe how quickly this sub is growing... and on top of it, 90% of you are stupidly civil and have the best discussions and are super supportive and insightful. The amount of help I see people giving each other is just awesome. 

Keep up with being civil, keep up with the awesome advice and help, and keep up with the hamplanet stories because if I don't get my fix my beetus is going to go through the roof. "	t5_2vzax	True

Be me on my way to the bus home, because weekend. 
I be walking through the central bus station making my way to the 6th floor, where the bus home awaits my arrival.
As I approach the escalator I notice a group of three chubby females blocking the entrance to it. We'll call them Lard Herd from now on.
The reason for LH's hold up becomes apparent after a second or two, the escalator seems to be tired from dragging people around all day and has decided to be a staircase instead.
The escalator in question wasn't even long, maybe 12 to 15 agonizing steps.

After a few seconds of scratching their fatlogic filled craniums the LH decided to find salvation in an elevator (crane?), and finally let the line of thin privileged people behind them  go up the esca-stairs.

Basically, there was a horrible fat girl at school. I think I'm going to have to split this up into at least 3 or 4 stories about her - including when I had to touch her, when she was caught stealing food meant for 8 people and how everyone gradually came to hate her because she thought it was hilarious to wipe food on you. I'll tell you the worst story first because it'll put into perspective just how nasty she was. I wouldn't be surprised if you think this was faked. It was so awful. And then if you want, I'll recite the other stories about her. 

This is the story of how I escaped her house, gained a new mental scar, and stopped talking to her. 

&gt; Be me, 15, in high school. I've spent the year recovering from knee surgery and so while I'm still person sized, I've gained about 5-10 kilos. Not being able to walk will do that. 

&gt; One day, at lunch, hamily invited me over. 

&gt; Now she's big. [Like 5'4"", close to 300lbs](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-20836-body-shape.htm#img). 

&gt; She doesn't fit into our school uniform, at a size 18. It looks like she's a human sausage. 

&gt; She invites me round. Try to be polite, OK sure. 

&gt; She's talking about her adorable new puppy, shows pics, it's actually cute. 

&gt; After school, we're waiting for her mum. She's eating a sandwich the entire time. It's like 4pm. Don't say anything because I'm polite. 

&gt; Realise that's her 3rd sandwich of the day. She had 2 at lunch plus other stuff. 

&gt; Her mum picks us up. 

&gt; MFW she's normal sized. 

&gt; Hamily annonces the entire time that she's hungry. Watch as mum has to placate her as if she's a child.

&gt; We get to her house. Hamily heads straight to the kitchen. 

&gt; Pulls out jumbo chips. Eats entire packet over the course of the next hour. 

&gt; Asks if I want any. ""Nothanks"". 

&gt; ""You should eat more, your lunches at school are so small!""

My lunches are not small. Croissant, fruits, nuts or left over salads. I'm gaining weight during this period. I had knee surgery at the start of the year, so lack of exercise means I've put on 10+ lbs. 

&gt; ""I just love food! I can't understand why you don't""

&gt; Stay silent. Seething. I love food, cook once a week, have a family that cooks every day, super healthy with quinoa and shit.

The weirdest thing about this girl is, she has absolutely NO recognition that she's fat. Like none at all. She was normal sized as a kid, and then bam puberty and suddenly she was a fucking planet. In the past, she's called others fat, and I've tried to point out how large she is. She flat out doesn't accept it. She is so large, they're going to have to order in her uniform and she doesn't fucking get it. 

&gt; Hamily's mum and dad come in. ""Oh hi hamily, do you want to come running with us tonight?""

&gt; Hamily ""No. TeeHee""

&gt; Literally laughs at the suggestion of exercise.

&gt; Returns to fridge. Makes another sandwich (her fourth for the day, that I've seen her eat). 

&gt; Turns out her parents training for the marathon. Both fit. Her older sister is a dance teacher. Fit. 

&gt;  Wat.

&gt; Ask what exercise she does. ""OH I do a bit of hockey, but not much because of my knee""

I was in PE with her, she was the laziest person I have ever seen. 

&gt; ""OH knee problems! Me too, what's wrong with yours?""

&gt; ""It hurts sometimes.""

&gt; Wat. ""Can't be that bad. Do you see a physio?""

&gt; ""No it's not bad enough to see someone. Anyway like you'd know about knee pain"" 

&gt; MFW I realise she is too thick to connect that I've had knee surgery. 

This is making me too mad. So much fat logic. Decide to discuss something else.

Walk into her room. It is THE MOST childish room I have ever seen in my life, that doesn't belong to a child. She had special storage for her beanie babies, posters from magazines aged at 8 year olds on the wall (Recent ones too, like last months), everything was pink.

&gt; She spends 20 minutes discussing her beanie babies. TeeHee-ing constantly. 

&gt; Ask her if she doesn't think it's a bit infantile. Doesn't know what the word means. 

&gt; Dog comes in

&gt; It's adorable!! Super sweet, white fluffy bitch (relevant).  Best part of visit.

Or so I thought. 

&gt; Dog rolls over onto back

&gt; Hamily starts TeeHeeing, struggles off the bed to the floor. 

&gt; I think she's going to scratch her tummy. 

&gt; Sowrong.jpeg

&gt; She reaches out her fat pinky.

&gt; And puts it in the dogs vagina. 

VOMIT.mp4

&gt; Starts masturbating off the dog. 

&gt; ""She loves it!"" Tee Hee. 

Yes. ***Actually starts giggling.*** 

I back away. 

&gt; ""Should you really be doing that!?!""

&gt; ""Oh it's totally fine, it's our little game!""

&gt; ""Please stop""

&gt; ""why?""

&gt; ""Just do.""

&gt; ""Fine... Want more food?""

This girls house is an hours drive from mine. Noescape.gif

&gt; Hamily walks back into the kitchen, and without washing her hands eats 4 chocolate biscuits. 

I can't stand it anymore. Call mum to come and pick me up. 

&gt; She invites me to a sleepover. ""We can share a bed! It'll be fun!""

Ohgod.png

&gt; Hamily's mum arrives back from the run. ""oh yes please stay! Hamily has a hard time making friends, and you're so lovely!""

&gt; Bullshit story about little sister being sick.

&gt; Have to wait awkwardly for an hour for my mum to come. 

&gt; See lunch prep for the next morning. So much food - 6 sandwiches with various fillings, 2 containers of pureed fruit, 2 containers of yoghurt, fruit, lollies, chocolate biscuits. Takes 2 lunch boxes to fit it in. She's only at school 6 hours - why does she need so much?!?!

&gt; Finally escape. Never nice to hamily again. Tell almost noone the story for years - don't want to think about it ever again. Just stop talking to her. 

&gt; 2 months later I hear she's spreading rumours about how much of a bitch I am. 

&gt; Just means more people stop talking to her. 

This girl is awful. Just awful. We had a school of 400. In 9 months since she arrived, she narrowed it down to just 5 who would hang out with her at school, and even then it was only because they were the sweetest nicest girls who couldn't say no. Also, all those sandwiches? Yeah, apparently she has one per each of her classes. So glad to be rid of her.  "	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Awsome people. Funny and loaded.

&gt;Every single day/multiple times a day he would give me 10€ to buy stuff like donuts (2€ for donuts, 8€ for me to keep my mouth shut)

&gt;One day Hans took some shitty organic chocolate (taste like dirt) and his wife lost it. You could see the fear in his eyes.

&gt;I was shocked when I walking in McD and see his wife cheating on him!

&gt;She was eating Big Mac! 

&gt;Helga beggs me not to tell owners becouse they will think the food taste like shit or Hans becouse she's a lying to him that she eats 100% healthy.

1372541762.0	1hbx62	Tales of hamplanetry and fatlogic through the eyes of a cardiologist (III)	iidank	611	131	67	"Story 3: MAH CURVES

Jimmies still intact? Thyroid still not acting up? No beetus cravings? 

This story involves a creature that can only be described as a baby of chewbacca and an orca. In the red corner standing at 5'2/157cm and weighing in at 325lbs/147kg/23stone, the one, the only ROLLSONROLLS.
and in the blue corner standing tall at 5'6/167cm and weighing in at 120lbs/54kg/8.5stone, you love to hate her, the skinny twig, MY MOM! 

Round 1:

ROLLSONROLLS was tanned as an orange and closely resembled only what can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean, living off skinny bitches and mcdicks. She came in to the clinic run by the hospital complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath (no shit sherlock) and [oh boy, oh boy, oh boy guess who had her](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/quiz/114000/114118_1230855060628_464_337.jpg)

My mom walks in and sees this creature perching on the bed and flailing her legs.
LordHelpMe.Please
She checks up on her and takes a while to find her heart beneath all that glorious fat and sounds like its just hanging on for dear life. She spots arrhythmia and inquires about what she has done recently
""I went to this party last night where we chugged eggnog, redbull and tequila"" 

I'm out, I give up. Its too much for my thyroid to handle 

My mom tells her that its not healthy and will result in heart damage soon and even a heart attack at her size

""YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF MY CURVES YOU SKINNY BITCH, YOU KNOW NOTHING""

Why do these oafs keep telling my mom she knows nothing?! Anyways, my mom tries to reason with her and calculates her bmi, 59.4! HOLY SHIT! and tells her what that means and it will result in so many complications in her life

""YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS THAT I CAN GET MEN ALL THE TIME WHILE YOU'RE STUCK HERE YOU TWIG"" 
 
My mom shows her the wedding ring and she retaliates with 

""MEN LIKE CURVES YOU ANOREXIC BITCH""

Now as stated before, My mom doesn't take shit from no one so she drew an hourglass and a bowling ball on the chart and showed it to her 

""that's called curvy and that's called being fat, now tell me, which one do you resemble the most?"" 

""FUCK YOU BITCH, YOU'RE JUST DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET A MAN""

oh for fuck sakes

""I'LL SUE THIS HOSPITAL FOR DISCRIMINATION, iMMA GO TO A REAL DOCTOR""

My mom writes her a prescription for the medicine to treat her CUNDISHION and writes down ""run every once in a while""

She tore up the prescription and waddled out of there

TL;DR ROLLSONROLLS gets insulted that her condition is due to her being fat and refuses any medical help and storms out

&gt;go outside and Oversized Kirby is standing by the car smoking a cigarette talking on the phone to a friend

&gt;Army Bros car is on other side of parking lot, his car seats 6, so that leaves me and the hubby and OK in our car

&gt;she has her back turned and doesn't realize we are close enough to hear her

&gt;we hear her say ""i knooooooow, did you get the link to Army Broooooo's instagram I sent you? He's so hot, He will dump that skinny bitch for a real woman like me by the end of tonight, just wait until she gets that message""

&gt;we are about 5 feet behind her and she still hasnt noticed we are there

&gt;says ""He is gonna be in my bed by the end of the night, PM &amp; PD are out of town. That bitch GAB is still getting that Facebook message from the fake account you created, right? Good. Rebound sex is soooooooo fun!""

&gt;I intentionally clear my throat and she jumps, tells her friend she has to go and that she will text her later

&gt;Me and my husband stay quiet and she says ""Heeeey, ready to go get our karaoke on??"" teehheeeee ""Man your Army bro is sooo into me, are you sure GAB is good to him?""

&gt;I tell her yes, and that she should pick someone else to flirt with because they are happy

&gt;she says ""we'll seeeeee, teeheeeee"" and squeezes into the back seat

&gt;of course I text Army Bro and let him in on Kirby's ""genius"" plan and to tell GAB to check her facebook

This is the actual message GAB recieved from an account with 7 friends and a pic of a half naked girl taking a picture of herself in a mirror, this is COPY/PASTED WORD FOR WORD (except GAB's name)the message says:

""Hi GAB, I know U dont kno me, but I kno who U R. I got dis link frum your supbosed ""boyfriends"" profile. I juss want to let U know that he is been cheeting on U wit me for the last month if he really is UR ""bf"".

Bye U whore ass man steelin bitch.""

I WISH I WAS MAKING THIS UP, KIRBY IS NUTS!!

&gt;GAB and Army bro text me back laughing and say they just can't take her seriously even in the slightest anymore

&gt;I wind up having to text them that we will have to meet them at the bar because OK IS.FREAKING.HUNGRY. and is begging us to stop at McDonalds for a cheeseburger

&gt; [mfw we stop and she gets TWO with double cheese and bacon after just eating enough food for 4 people not even 20 minmutes ago] (http://i.imgur.com/hlSbE.gif)

&gt;she snarfs them down in 5 minutes and I can hear my husband supressing a gag

&gt;the smell in the car, oh my goodness, onion ring breath, cheesburger, and she had developed a sheen of sweat at that point and we are pretty sure she didn't put on deodorant

side note, we had the car cleaned professionally the next day, the smell was awful

&gt;so we FINALLY get to karaoke and everyone picks a cluster of tables by the stage and the bar and we immediately start ordering shots

&gt;OK seems to be missing, we figure she's getting her hand stamped because she is underage

&gt;we look over and she is already signing up to sing

&gt; [ofw] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4bI5.gif)

&gt;a few more of the group go to sign up and come back laughing, but won't tell us what song she is going to sing

&gt;it's going to be about 20 minutes before she gets up there, so we order 2-3 pitchers of beer and start to finally relax a little

&gt;Kirby orders something called a pink panther and downs it, burps, and flags down the waitress for a long island iced tea and asks for an order of 20 boneless hot wings

&gt;basically 20 mini chicken tenders with hot sauce on them

&gt;[OFW ARE YOU KIDDING?!?!?!] (http://i.imgur.com/CFCoG.gif)

&gt;the waitress is back in about 3 minutes because they are busy, doesnt notice that Kirbys I.D. is obviously fake, but the wings and the amazing beer choices are a big selling point of the bar, so they have constant batches of wings ready and are always busy

&gt;Kirby eats ALL of them in about 10 minutes

&gt;what.the.fuck.

&gt;our friends at this point have done about 5-6 shots each and are nursing some beers and are taking in this crazy trainwreck of a person

&gt;even me, Army Bro, GAB, and the hubby have never seen this side of her crazy before

&gt;just can't look away

&gt;finally the DJ for the karaoke section calls her name

&gt;she gets up and does that ""sexy waddle"" that I just cant describe as she rolls up to the stage

&gt;she says ""We need a song, so this one goes out to ARMY BROOOOOOO"" and she does that weird wiggle wink and points right at him, the music starts, and she is.attempting.to.dance.

&gt;it is just a bunch of jiggling and her xxxxl muffin top looks like jello trying to escape a pair of pantyhose 

&gt;look of horror on Army Bros face, GAB jaw hits the floor

&gt;all of us staring in disbelief when [this] (http://youtu.be/41i4uCWST_U) starts playing.

&gt;when we say it sounds like a mix between a whale choking and a dog howling, we aren't exaggerating

&gt;[whole bars' fw she starts singing] (http://i.imgur.com/zXWsK.gif)

&gt;people in the bar are actually covering their ears and laughing

&gt;she is really getting into it and starts all out dancing and singing/wheezing

&gt;[DJ's face when he looks over the half wall to make sure she isn't singing again] (http://i.imgur.com/hPB97.gif)

&gt;we stay for about another 2 hours as Kirby found another ""curvy girl"" to talk to about ""muh curves"" ""real women"" and how hot army bro is

&gt;everyone but my husband and Army Bro are feeling good at this point because they are the DD's, but Kirby is plowed. She has been able to pass off the fake I.D. and we hadn't been paying much attention to her so we could enjoy the silence

&gt;she suddenly remembers she has to go to the grocery before we leave the bar

&gt;husband refuses, says we have to get to liquor store for himself and army bro before they close

&gt;she begs to go

&gt;[hfw] (http://i.imgur.com/KEWWu.gif)

&gt;she's too drunk to argue, so we all pile into the cars and we give army bro money to get whatever he and husband wants

&gt;we get to Kirbys house and we realize someone accidentally grabbed her keys and she has to hang out at our house until army bro and the crew get home

&gt;about 20 minutes later, she says she is gonna go through the back gate at her house and get into the hot tub while we are waiting

&gt;we are hanging on the back porch and watch as she waddles down the road and goes through the back gate

&gt;she starts undressing

&gt;NO SHE IS UNDRESSING!!!! AHHHHH!

&gt;Army bro and gang get home just in time to see her stripped to her bra and panties and sit on the side of the hot tub, she tries to turn to swing her feet over and pretty much does a cannon ball sideways into the hot tub

&gt;husband, army bro, and one other strong guy go to help because we don't want her drunk ass to drown in her hot tub

&gt;Army bros friend has her keys and they help her out and run in to get her robe

This is the last thing that happened that night that made Army Bro finally lose it

&gt;All the guys help her to her bathroom so she can change into pajamas

&gt;husband comes back home and looks scarred for life

&gt;Army bro and friend come barrelling out of her house as we hear screaming coming from her bedroom window, followed by a ""FUCK OFF THEN, IM GOING TO SLEEP!!"" from Kirby

&gt;Army bro comes running up to the deck where we have the bonfire going and have the beers set out and tells us what happened

&gt;Kirby came out of the bathroom with one boob hanging out claiming that her top was caught on something

&gt;they stood there not knowing what to do

&gt;she said ""just pull the back down and it will fix itself""

&gt;army bro was desperate for her boob to be covered so he reached around to her back to pull the snagged part down

&gt;before he could grab the snagged part of her shirt, she grabbed his hand and put.it.on.her.boob and bent down and grabbed his crotch with her free hand

&gt;he immediately pulled away and ran into her bathroom and gagged uncontrolably over the toilet

&gt;she turned to our friend and said ""my parents arent home, and i know army bro isnt a one woman man, my friend told me so. So how about you two come to my bedroom and we have a little fun?""

&gt;that was it for army bro

&gt;He ran into the hall, put his finger in her face and proceeded to tell her this..

&gt;If you EVER flirt with me, try to add me on facebook, try to get my number, or so much aS look at me wrong again, I will file a harassment charge and a restraining order, and so will my girlfriend

&gt;If you EVER force me to touch any part of you again I will be forced to file sexual harassment charges on you

&gt;If you even TRY to pull that fake bullshit with that fake facebook account again, I will file cyber stalking charges, and so will GAB

&gt;dont look at me, dont touch me, dont breathe around me

&gt;at this point he ordered her ""drunk ass to get in the bed, and to not step a foot on our property (after that night, i agreed with him, he didnt have to ask)

&gt;thats when he said she barreled towards the bed, got under the covers and they ran out to her yelling ""fuck off""

We will NEVER EVER go out with her again, she isnt allowed at our house, and as far as I'm concerned, she can walk to the grocery or call a cab. her mother called to see how things went and we told her what happened, she is beyond livid at her own daughter.

EDIT 1: gifs seem to be working now, trust me, it makes the feels better and the jimmies rustle harder

EDIT 2: Army bro just checked the mail, and [THIS] (http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag158/yeahokcool/letter_zpsa525be66.jpg) is what he just came in and showed me. We are getting my best friends' husband, who is a cop, to go over in uniform and give her a warning about harassing Army Bro and his girlfriend. [This] (http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-9592-body-shape.htm#img) is a pic of her weight and height, but its not her. I couldn't edit the pic enough. [OFW] (http://i.imgur.com/eocz3.gif) when he got the letter and she sent the pic right after he came in.

Edit 3: BFF husband just texted me and said he went on over, and she was so scared that she begged him not to arrest her and that she would leave Army Bro alone. He told her that if she didn't stop the harassment that Army bro and GAB were going to file a complaint.

Reading all these stories made me realize how I have hidden behind my own brand of fatlogic for years and made me do something that I have been unable to do for years - eat salads instead of the fatty food I eat all the time! You can laugh if you want but this was a **BIG** step for me. I have been trying to actively loose weight for a year but mostly it has been me lying to myself and making plans but not following through. But reading FPS everyday seems to give the push and motivation to maintain my diet now so keep up the good work and let the beetus juice flow!

Now to the main story (I am the protagonist and there are some sad parts to it but I am not going to make any excuses). Also to give more context I was always a academic overachiever (and proud of it) and am good at my job and also I have a pretty above average IQ. (I use these to set higher standards for myself and not to be superior over other people). But below are some stories of how I used these to lie to myself about why I was fat


&gt; Be fat teenager in a third world country (240 lbs/5' 11''/16 years).

&gt; Millions of starving people, stand out like beacon of fatness

&gt; Pilgrims come to my house to admire and worship my generous proportions

&gt; Hide behind academic achievements and high IQ

&gt; Teachers praise my work and ignore my growing gravitational field

&gt; One teacher once asks me point blank - ""why are you so fat?""

&gt; Face burns with shame say THIGH-ROID, GENETICS, BIG-BONED

&gt; Thyroid - normal, family is overweight but not morbidly obese like me, what does big-boned even mean?

&gt; Angry at teacher and get depressed and go into spiral of working harder in school (somehow prove that honest teacher wrong - fatlogic!!!) and eating more junk food

&gt; Teachers continue to praise my work but ignore my weight problem

I realize now that the teacher who actually asked me about my weight was the one I should have listened to instead of hating. But my fatlogic-addled brain could not understand it then.


&gt; Be object approaching hamschild radius in college (280 lb)

&gt; First crush and puppy love (more like full blown slobbering st. bernard's love)

&gt; Continue usual academic over-achievement and convinced girl will fall head-over-heels for me

&gt; Manufacture courage to ask her out - polite no

&gt; Crushed and rail to friends about fat discrimination.

&gt; One honest friend tries to tell me that maybe my weight makes me unattractive

&gt; Stop helping him with college work and stop talking to him

&gt; Only keep ""friends"" who agree to my fatlogicity and just want me to help with college assignments

No need to say what I did wrong there


&gt; Crossed the ham-horizon an reached full-blown ham-hole status (330 lb)

&gt; Be in grad school, meet my academic match, competitive engineering program, everybody is as good or better than me

&gt; Fully immerse myself in grad-work to maintain my overachievement

&gt; Life is sedentary and and grades are good but me depressed

&gt; Try dating to improve social life, alwaysrejected.jpg (I was aiming way out of my league - with my brains still confusing intellect with attractiveness)

&gt; Second year of PhD, full on nervous breakdown. Stop working and basically kicked out of grad school.

&gt; More depressed and brother tries to gently say that there is more to life then studying (physical activity and healthy weight for example)

&gt; Start hating brother and stop talking to him

I made up with my brother soon and he stopped talking about my weight to keep peace. This last One is about how FPS helped


&gt; Working in software development - code-monkeying rules!

&gt; Awesome female (I am a man) coworker who looses a bunch of weight 

&gt; Also have a huge crush on her, ask her out, polite no, handle it better this time

&gt; Try online dating and no responses

&gt; Try meeting strangers using meetup etc no success

&gt; Start thinking hard - the problem is with me

&gt; Trying to loose weight but failing (fat logic strong with binge eats and impossible diet goals)

&gt; Finds FPS, ashamed to see how each story reflects a facet of my lying fat self

&gt; Read FPS everyday and remember hammalicious descriptions, help control impulsive eating

&gt; Avoid fatty foods, eat salads and nuts, avoid emotional eating

&gt; Lost 30 lbs (still at 295 lbs) but working towards a healthier tomorrow!


TL;DR Ham-hole uses academic/professional achievements as excuse for fatlogic. Discovers that FPS is a great motivating tool for keeping himself honest."	t5_2vzax	True
1366730867.0	1cxux7	The Lard Sisters Go On Vacation	pedrandas	606	131	123	"The Lard Sisters Go On Vacation

More stories [here] (http://www.reddit.com/user/pedrandas/submitted/). 

The Lard sisters are my cousins (Jamhampants, Anomnomnom, and Amahamplanet); listed from oldest to youngest. 

This was a few years ago when our families would drive to the beach together: following each other in separate cars, taking breaks together, etc. 

The drive to the beach was about 4 hours. This was the last time we drove with them, my parents got fed up, finally. Here's why..

&gt;  be me: 125/5'5""/athletic. 

&gt;  heading off to the beach with the family

&gt;  we load up our bags and head over to the lard sisters house

&gt;  drive is about 40 minutes away

&gt;  make it to their house

&gt;  they just finished their breakfast

&gt;  the sisters waddle out to sit in their car as their parents bring out all of their luggage

&gt; they each carry a tote bag of monstrous size, sunglasses to match. 

&gt;  parents and I exit the vehicle to ask if they need any help and say 'good morning'

&gt;  I greet their parents and then head over to their car

&gt;  sisters already munching on junk food from their totes

&gt;  it's barely 6am and they just ate...

&gt;  Anomnomnom lifts her shirt to show me her new bikini

&gt;  finish wiping up vomit on the concrete drive way

&gt;  their mom starts the car and dad finished dragging all of their luggage and packed it up

&gt;  Jamhampants's 2 suitcases wouldn't fit...trip is less than a week long

&gt;  her father asks if she can repack whatever she needs and leave stuff she doesn't

&gt;  tantrum ensues with her usual cursing and brattiness

&gt;  her father asks if she can at least hold onto it in the backseat since the trunk is full

&gt;  nope.jpg

&gt;  her mom ends up holding on to the carry on sized roller suitcase in the passenger's seat....

&gt;  mfw I don't have a fucking face

&gt;  everyone is seated, my dad finishing up his smoke and we're getting ready to roll out

&gt;  their dad goes around to double check the house is locked up

&gt;  Anomnomnom screams at her ""daddy"" to ""hurry the fuck up""

&gt;  stayclassy.somethingclever

**And so starts the drive**

&gt;  About 10 minutes later, just before we are about to hit the highway, my dad gets a call

&gt;  the lard sisters want jack in the box

&gt;  pull in to the jack in the crack 

&gt;  my family isn't a lardapalooza so one breakfast was enough for us in an hour

&gt;  we still exit, parents decide they want some coffee for the road

&gt;  stand in line with the lard sisters, chatting

&gt;  ""didn't you guys already eat breakfast?""

&gt;  oh shit...what have I said..

&gt;  J: ""I really didn't eat that much, I wasn't hungry until now, I'm not used to waking up at 6am and blah blah some other excuses""

&gt;  A: ""yea....we don't starve ourselves like you do lol don't fall through the cracks in the sidewalk when we head back outside lol""

At least I can fit through something....

&gt;  hold my tongue

&gt;  they order a shit ton of food and insist we stay at the restaurant until they're done

&gt;  it's almost 7am

&gt;  they finish at 7:45

&gt;  my parents not too pissed, they got their coffee and were talking with their parents

&gt;  I am pissed, however, because they're selfish brats and don't consider the other 6 people waiting on them because we eat like normal humans and not hammies..

&gt;  in the car and on the road at about 8am

&gt;  been out for TWO HOURS already and we're barely leaving their town

&gt;  driving on the highway

&gt;  about an hour later, I get a text from them asking if I'm hungry

&gt;  ""nah, I had a good breakfast and just ate a snack we brought on the drive""

&gt;  J: ""ok well we're stopping by BK and my daddy's phone is charging so he can't call. He asked me to text y'all to take the next exit""

&gt;  motherfucker. Are you serious.. It's about just past 9.

&gt;  tell my dad

&gt;  my mom comments: ""they should have just brought a trough for their girls so we don't have to keep stopping all the damn time""

&gt;   lol mom u so funny

&gt;  J gets a large fry and chicken fingers or something of the like and then a chocolate shake AND a sweet tea. I only remember this because she abused the cashier as she was ordering, pestering her to make the food correctly. 

&gt;  forgot what Anomnomnom got, but it was a whole meal and a shake and soda

&gt;  they ask to stay for them to eat

&gt;  parents say no due to traffic 

&gt;  Anomnomnom starts cursing and calling her mom a bitch. Loudly. Some construction workers eating were staring with disgust as they were eating their breakfasts. So fucking embarrassing..

&gt;  Anomnomnom storms off to the car and the other 2 sisters follow

&gt; ontheroadagain.mp3

So we've been out of the house for 3 hours already and are barely denting in the first hour of the actual 4-5 hour drive. It's about 9:40ish in the morning. 

&gt;  an hour and a half later, the lard sisters want out of the car again

&gt;  they say they need to stretch their legs

&gt;  ok I guess, I could use the bathroom

&gt;  we pull over at the next rest area

&gt;  dads drive off to fill up on gas while we used the facilities 

&gt;  they head straight for the bathroom with me

&gt;  I kinda hurried in because I really had to go so I wasn't socializing with them on the walk over

&gt;  notice they didn't enter the restroom with me

&gt;  step out of the bathroom after I'm done and the motherfuckers are raping the vending machine

&gt;  ""don't you guys have snacks in the car?""

&gt;  evil dagger eyes once again

&gt;  J: "" no our parents ate them all""

&gt; [Yea...sure..] (http://gifrific.com/jennifer-lawrence-sarcastic-ok-thumbs-up/)

&gt;  it's now 11am. Been up since 5am, on the road since 6am and we're barely half way there due to shitty traffic building up since they stopped so many times earlier. 

&gt;  about 2ish hours left in the trip, but will possibly be longer since they stop all the damn time 

&gt;  get back in the car and drive again

&gt;  fucking less than TWENTY MINUTES LATER, my dad gets a call asking to pull over for food

&gt;  all of my wat

&gt;  my family and I have been eating the food we brought and it fit in a medium sized cooler you can carry by hand. Not too big. They have a LARGE cooler filled with just snacks for the trip. We carried our big cooler too but that was for the beach so it was empty..

&gt;  so we end up at a Wendy's 

&gt;  my mom asks if we want anything

&gt;  I guess some fries sound good

&gt;  datnaturalcut

&gt;  Stand in line as the beasts order their XL meals

&gt;  I go after them and order just a large fry for each of my family members, so 4 large fries and my dad wanted a coke. 

&gt;  they have the nerve to make fun of me for eating a lot.............they assumed the fries and coke were all for me. J: "" you should watch what you eat, pedrandas, lol""

*I will kill you*

&gt;  I say they're for everyone in my car and point out their meals could feed Africa twice over. 

&gt;  hammies not happy with me 

&gt;  they insist we stay again. Fuck no. I actually say something this time...""we're almost there...""

Not authoritative, but still, they ask me why ""the fuck"" am I being ""so fucking moody"" and to ""calm down"". 


&gt;  Parents agree. We go to the car. Their parents agree and the hammies get pissed again having to eat in the car. Anomnomnom cries ""child abuse"" as she always does when her parents are ""unfair""

&gt;  we make it to the beach at 3pm. THREE PM. WE LEFT THE HOUSE AT 5am AND IT'S A 4 HOUR DRIVE

&gt; I've spared ye several ""rest stops"" about every 30 minutes to try and cut this story as short as possible

I figured since I included several other stories about the beach vacations we've taken with them, this driving experience would be a nice addition to the collection. 

This Jamhampants and the Lardsisters series will never end. So many stories. Stay tuned.

Also, I'm glad your jimmies have been eased finding out exactly [how my fingers came to be crushed and broken in chapter two](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f3t5e/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_two_the_tale_of_my/). For those who's jimmies were rumbled by that story, take it as a sign of more to come from our favourite PorkPlanet Housemate. 

This is the tale of how PorkPlanet got stoned, broke more shit, then cuteguy screwed up. 

&gt; Be mid-feb.  So before brokenfingergate but nearly a month post outfitgate and poledancinggate. 

&gt; Me and cuteguy have finally hooked up.

&gt; Me, KK (housemate), Cuteguy and PorkPlanet are in my room. 

&gt; We have been smoking dat bud. Rare for us and always fun because we literally laugh for 3 hours straight and then fall asleep into blissful slumber.

&gt; PorkPlanet hogging the joint all evening. As most PorkPlanets do. They be greedy for all the things. She is so high she's contemplating all the things in life, and all the food in our kitchen. 

&gt; Me, KK, Cuteguy sat on my bed. [OFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/7b55d06cdc260f7682a61e4078079e45/tumblr_mkbr5i5qJt1qkjbe6o1_500.gif) we are watching the [fenton clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GRSbr0EYYU) on repeat. 

&gt; PorkPlanet disappears for 10 minutes. Re-appears with Microwave Popcorn and Maryland Cookies. 

&gt; [MFW](http://files.redux.com/images/0ec7cb128e5103c6c9c2d01e72b568f2/raw) the recovering hamplanet that is me, is salivating over the  cookies 'cause MUNCHIES. I resist and drink some diet coke instead. 

&gt; Porkplanet is other side of my room. Munching dat food. 

&gt; She is leaning against the side of  my desk. 

&gt; LOUDCRACK.RAR

&gt; whatthefuckwasthat.jpeg

&gt; Porkplanets jimmies look rustled suddenly. 

&gt; Me and Cuteguy can't figure out what that noise was.
 
&gt; KK is on the bed convulsing. A  silent laugh. She can't  take a breath she's laughing that hard. She's shaking the bed with it.

&gt; Me: ""KK what's so funny""

&gt; KK just points towards Porkplanet and keeps convulsing. 

&gt; Cuteguy see's something. Starts convulsing also. 

&gt; Porkplanet is red in the face. Also, still eating. Stood up at the end of my bed.

&gt; Cuteguy points. ""The desk... the desk"" goes back into hysterics. 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/dwight-no.gif) I look and realize the back-board to the desk is split down the middle. 

&gt; Her mass on the side of my desk shifted the desk  and snapped the backboard in half.

&gt; Me: ""PORKPLANET... YOU.... YOU BROKE MY FUCKING DESK MATE""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""IT WAS ALREADY BROKENNNNNNNN"" 

&gt; [Cuteguys face when](http://couchlocked.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/laughing-hysterically_thumb.gif) he's [already heard that line](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f2gb2/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_part_2/) before. 

&gt; Porkplanet is so stoned she can barely stand. Also, she's drank Vodka and Coke all evening before embarking on the high. She's wasted. 

&gt; Me: ""JUST GO TO BED PORKPLANET, YOU'RE WRECKED.""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""FINE.""

&gt; Me: ""LEAVE THE POPCORN. COMPENSATION FOR THE BROKEN DESK""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I DIDN'T BREAK ETTTTTTTT"" she leaves the popcorn anyway and goes.

&gt; fairtradeoff.jpeg 

&gt; [OFW](http://media.tumblr.com/f7987e4cdc6279b68e1de34471df88f5/tumblr_inline_mgr5zdPcya1ruz8y9.gif) KK is still convulsing over the desk and hasn't spoken even 20 minutes later. We all laugh for the next hour. 

The next part is set two days later. Porkplanets mother visits. Cuteguy and I are sat in the living room. Cuteguy didn't mean what happened next, he just thought it was a funny story that Porkplanets mother would like to hear. He's a guy who finds everything kind of funny. He didn't anticipate Porkplanets mother being more sensitive about her daughters weight than Porkplanet herself. Also, her mother is a GP (Family doctor for Americans) so is especially sensitive about her daughters expanding equator. More on Porkplanets background at a later date. 

&gt; With cuteguy in living room, evening time. 

&gt; We're literally talking about the desk and how I'm going to have to ask Porkplanet to replace it or fix it. Cuteguy is laughing. 

&gt; Suddenly, the satellite signal on the TV goes out, the laminate flooring begins to bow, the lights flicker, cuteguys balls retract up into his stomach. Porkplanet is coming down the hallway. 

&gt; [OFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqtxdwpfJb1qfso9oo1_500.gif) 

&gt; Enters Porkplanet, and her mother, who is visiting for the evening. 

&gt; [Cuteguys face when](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/5671558144/hCE6A6DC3/) he expected her mother to be supernova, when she's in fact a MILF.

&gt; Introductions done, hellos made, Porkplanet exits to make cups of tea laden will half a pound of sugar for all. 

&gt; Porkplanets Mother asks what we've been up to this evening. 

&gt; Cuteguy, giggling: ""We were just talking about how Porkplanet accidentally broke  imgonnamakeit's desk""  

&gt; whythefuckwouldyoutellherthatdoofus.gif

&gt; Porkplanets mother: ""What do you mean she broke your desk?""

&gt; Me (panicking): ""It was nothing. She leaned on it and the back of it broke but it was already old"".

&gt; Porkplanets Mother: ""What else has she broken?!""

&gt; Cuteguy laughs even harder at the question remembering the pole dancing pole but doesn't say anything. 

&gt; Enter porkplanet. ""What's so funny?"" 

&gt; Porkplanets Mother: ""Cuteguy was just telling me how you broke imgonnamakeits desk? How did that happen?"" 

&gt; Porkplanet launches ragemode.exe

&gt; Me: ""It wasn't like that, honestly. Just an accident. We'll get it fixed.

&gt; Porkplanet (fully raged): ""WHY WOULD YOU TELL MY MOTHER SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT? WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU TOLD HER? ARGHHHHHHHHHHH""

&gt; Porkplanet storms out. 

&gt; Her mother is confused. Cuteguy is sorry he said anything. 

&gt;  [MFW](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Judge-Judy-Shake-My-Head-Gif.gif) I deal with tantrums like this every week now. 

Her mother exits. I give cuteguy a big row for mentioning something like that to her mother. He just thought it was funny, didn't understand that it would offend anyone. For 10 minutes, we hear porkplanet and her mother arguing in her room. Her mother then leaves the house. She comes back 10 minutes later and hands me £100 cash and tells me to fix or buy a new desk. 

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljvvxcQGj71qf86qm.gif) I check the inventory for the house and the desk is only valued at £50.

**TLDR; Porkplanet breaks my desk stoned out of her skull. Cuteguy is still laughing two days later. Porkplanet and mother enter room. Cuteguy unintentionally tells mother about desk. Mother is mortified. Porkplanet is enraged. Compensation given. Profit???**

Sidenote; if anyone wants to white knight for Porkplanet, don't bother because she deserves everything she gets. You will not convince me otherwise. She'll never find this (she barely uses the internet for anything other than FB) and posting this causes her NO harm! I however suffer plenty of harm at the brunt of her ""friendship"" all the time. Just enjoy the stories. "	t5_2vzax	True
1367436224.0	1di0h8	My first experience with ham-logic	None4GretchenWieners	625	148	263	"Hey guys, after a couple months of reading these delicious stories, I decided to type up some of the stories I have from years of working in retail. I'm using a throwaway just in case anyone involved reads these and realizes who I am. I'm not going to greentext because I like storytelling, so bear with me. This ended up being quite a bit longer than planned, but that just means more story calories for you fatties.

This story is my first-ever encounter with fatlogic. Buckle up those jimmies, they might go missing.

Be me, 16, F, 5'8”, 160lbs, working at a local chain grocery store. Not skinny but not fat, legitimately curvy in the right places. I was on the track team and I ran at least 5 miles every day so I was in really good shape.  I was the noob in the store at this point as I had only been there one week. These two mini moons, a man and a woman, obviously a couple, came to my checkout lane with enough food to feed an African village. The man was the same height as me and weighed about 100 lbs more, and his wife/girlfriend/whatever was about 5'5” and weighed about the same as him. There were cakes and pies a plenty, processed lunch meat and hot dogs galore. How about 2-liter sodas? They had twenty. But who cares? No big deal. They had more. The one thing that really stood out to me as I was bagging their groceries was the cheese. I shit you not, there was fourteen pounds of American cheese. FOURTEEN POUNDS. Now, being the naïve young girl I was, I thought all this food was for a party. LOLNOPE. When I politely and casually asked if they were planning a party, the woman's face lit up and she said no, they weren't having a party, the cheese was for them for the week. FOR THE WEEK. Meaning they each eat a pound of overly-processed shit cheese per day. She proceeds to tell me that they both put cheese on literally everything they eat. Of course, I thought she was trolling me but I was trying to be polite as I was nervous that I would get in trouble and lose my job if I showed any skepticism and she complained. So I did what any other nervous kid would do, I just smiled and didn't say very much. The lady proceeded to keep ranting about how life is too short to torture yourself by denying yourself “awesome delicious foods” (really? American cheese? GAG) and that she prefers to just eat whatever she wants and not have to worry about being skinny. At this point I really want to say something about the health risks of being obese, but again, I'm nervous as hell, so I keep my mouth shut, bag the rest of their order, and politely tell them to have a nice day.

Over the course of the next three months, this couple comes into my store EVERY Saturday and buys up all the pre-packaged honey ham, oven-roasted turkey, pastrami, and roast beef along with 20 2-liters of soda and fourteen pounds of American cheese. This woman had not lied, they really do go through that much cheese in one week. It takes all of my patience and willpower to not gag/vomit as I bag their groceries and listen to their fatlogic about how I'm “too skinny” (bitch I'm not skinny) and I need to eat more so I can gain some curves because men don't like women who look like 10-year-old boys. Umm, last I checked 10-year-old boys don't have large C-cup boobs and plump butts. Whatever though, I mostly just drown them out before my jimmies get too rustled and I say something that will get me fired.

Cut to another few months later, I am having lunch at the awesome sushi restaurant that is next door to my work. During my employment at said grocery store I ate at this place at least twice a week because I had no car and the only other food options available were shitty fast food places or the janky in-store deli food and I would forget to bring lunch with me sometimes. Enter mini moon couple who are now full-blown moons (they have gained at least 30 lbs each in the past 6 months). As they are being seated I remember the woman saying they put cheese on everything and I chuckle a bit to myself thinking that surely she was exaggerating, because obviously no one would put cheese on their sushi, right? Wrong. As I am eating my food, I see the female moon pull a Ziploc bag of cheese out of her purse and put it on the table, trying to hide it from the waitresses. Keep in mind this is a rather traditional Japanese restaurant in style and menu and everyone working there is from Japan and have thick accents. When the moons get their 4 plates of food each, I stop eating watch in horror as these people each take a piece of sushi, place it in the center of a slice of cheese, wrap the cheese around the piece, and pop it into their gaping maws. Remember, this isn't even good cheese, this is the overly-processed shit they call American cheese. At this point, I am too sick to finish my meal, so I ask my waitress for a to-go box. As she walks away, I notice that everyone else has noticed what these moons are doing to that poor innocent sushi. Every. Single. Piece. Gets wrapped in cheese before being eaten. The waitresses are obviously horrified but also too polite to say anything to them. After I pay, I see the poor owner of this fine establishment looking like he's ready to stab them with his beloved extra sharp “show-off” knives. I give him a look of genuine pity as I walk out of there before he does something I'm obligated to testify against in court.

The next part of the story I didn't witness first-hand, but this was told to me by the owner and a few regular patrons who where there that day. I had gone back to the restaurant later that week (surprising, I know) for lunch and asked Mr. Owner what happened after I left. He told me that after the moon couple had paid, he asked them to please never return to the restaurant as they had completely disrespected him, his employees, his restaurant, and his culture. He and couple of the patrons told me that they had started screaming that he was fat-shaming them and they need their cheese to keep their beetus/thighroids from acting up and all Asian people are skinny pieces of shit that hate white people. I thought they were exaggerating a bit, but no, one guy actually had taken video on his cell phone of the whole ordeal. MFW I have no fucking face. They proceeded to scream that they were going to sue for for discrimination and that they would have “this gook-place” shut down for good. Little did they know one of the sushi chefs had called the police on them. When the police showed, the moons were dragged out kicking and screaming while the waitresses, chefs, owner, and patrons had to give statements about what had happened. I'm really happy I didn't stick around for that, I really didn't want to be involved as I would still have to see these fat fucks every week in my store.

The fat fucks ended up being perma-banned from the restaurant and the owner got a restraining order against them so they couldn't even try to come back without getting arrested.

I wish this story had a happy ending, but it really doesn't. I worked at that store for 5 miserable years and the last time I saw the moon couple they were both full-on Jupiter status, weighing in at 400+ lbs each. I wish I was kidding guys, I really do. I just can't make this stuff up though, I am not that creative in the slightest. If there's enough interest, I'll post more stories of the hamplanets I met while working there.

TL;DR not being fat makes me a 10-year-old boy and Murican cheese is good for the beetus

1375501702.0	1jlx99	"My time working in a busy bakery, or ""The Leaners""."	PhantomoftheMummy	558	83	148	"Forgive the clumsiness of this one, please.  It's less an FPS and more just a collection of memories of serving people their sugary treats. I just banged it out today, inspired by another FPS story about working in a grocery bakery (This one: http://tinyurl.com/msqs8cc).  This post started out to be a comment on that story, but it McBeetused into something too large for a comment.  I took it home, bought it some stretch pants and brought it back here for you.  No green because greentext, like fire, is BAD.

I used to work in the bakery department of an enormous grocery store.  I wanted to learn to bake bread, but unfortunately I was set up to work the bakery sales counter.  Very overweight people accounted for at least a third of our lucrative bakery business, but it came at a price.

We had many regular customers as big as sofas that would come in and lean against the glass of the dessert case.  It was a convex shatterproof glass cover, but several times a customer applied enough weight and pressure and they broke the hinges from the window frame.  They'd actually tear the metal from its moorings.

They kept me busy cleaning down the display case every twenty minutes or so.  There would be streaks of grease and saliva everywhere they touched the glass with their little piggies.  Why did they have to touch the glass?  HWP people never touched the glass.  Fats always - ALWAYS- had to physically touch the display case, and not only just when pointing out their selections.  When they were making up their selections before ordering, they’d often caress the glass with one finger like they were keeping their place reading a book. 

 Also, we had to ring up Fats purchases in the bakery department.  We were supposed to do this for everyone, but security camera footage revealed that we had dozens of Fats who would waddle around the store eating their goodies, then they'd fold up the boxes and stash them around the store, and leave without paying for the baked goods. The store busted one such thief, and she told them in no uncertain terms that she saw the turnovers she ate as being a freebie, and that she'd been doing it for years with no problems.  I guess her point was that she was somehow grandfathered into shoplifting so the store couldn't touch her. (?)

So, even though store policy was that we had to ring up all bakery selections in our department, we were secretly told that the emphasis was on the Glass Leaners.  No HWP shoppers were ever caught gobbling pie while wandering the aisles.  It doesn't sound fair, but you had to see this behavior before you could really judge these unofficial rules.  If there were HWP people in line with the Leaners, we had to ring them all up at the bakery counter.  If no Leaners were present, we could just put a tag on their bakery box and they’d be charged at the register when they paid for their other groceries. Most Leaners would have the cashier throw their empty box away before they rang up their purchases.

On our side of the counter, the grocery had hired a woman who was at least 40 percent ass to help with the evening shift.  She only wanted to close, and no one else wanted to do it, so she was always one of the closers.  It took me one day to realize why she campaigned for the closing shift.

At the end of the day, all unsold food was removed from the case and was destroyed.  They wouldn't donate to the local food shelter (for reasons), and the edict was handed down that all the food had to be ruined with bleach before being taken to the dumpster.  This was the reason for she asked for the closing shift. My large coworker would do her best to eat all of the maple logs (her favorite) and any of the more expensive items rather than throw them away. Maple logs are baked connected to one another in clusters of six.  I once watched her duck behind the counter, kneel down behind the bakery case and stuff a whole six maple logs into her mouth, biting down finally after forcing three quarters of the cluster into her might maw.  

She couldn't talk, and could barely chew.  I tried to get her to drink water, but she made a sour face and waved me away, instead washing the whole thing down with Pepsi.  She was flushed and damp from the effort of chewing and swallowing this mess, but in a moment, she looked at the ceiling and smiled, the maple frosting covering her face and part of her eyeglasses.  ""Good god DAMN thass better'n sex,"" she said.

I decided to quit after a Leaner woman came in and demanded that we give her some peanut butter brownies for free because we were out of the walnut ones she really wanted.  The girl waiting on her laughed, thinking she was joking, but the Leaner starting screaming and cursing her out for not taking her seriously. She grabbed her brownies before they were given a price tag, which was a clear sign she intended to eat them in the store.  The manager had security throw her out. Before the guard showed up to collect her she stuffed all of the brownies in her mouth and refused to admit there had ever BEEN any brownies to begin with.  She had an empty box in her cart, a ring of peanut butter chocolate around her lips and a half dozen witnesses that saw her gobble them down.  She accused us of making fun of her weight and making “lewd and hurtful” remarks.  I put my two weeks in that afternoon.  I’d had enough.

TL/DR: It’s hard to make some fat people happy, even if you’re in the cookie and cake business.

Background - I work at a used music store, we buy, sell and trade musical instruments. Very hands on store and people are encouraged to pull instruments off the wall and play them. Since we only stock used instruments there is no 'back room' where we store more of the same product. What's on the floor is what we got.

&gt;Be me, working the short Sunday shift at music store with bro. 

&gt;Sundays tend to be slow days.

&gt;In walks known customer, cute ~15 year old girl who takes guitar lessons at store. She has been playing for about a year. Getting really good.

&gt;She is upbeat and cheerful, likes to ask questions and learn and very polite. Comes in once at week for lesson.

&gt;Today is not lesson day.

&gt;Tells me her mom used to play guitar and wants to get back into it.

&gt;AWESOME!

&gt;Tells me mom is on her way, parking the car.

&gt;Parking is right outside door in strip mall - 30 foot walk.

&gt;Front door opens.

&gt;Asteroid made out of pork is slamming into earth.

&gt;nope just girls mom.

&gt;Pushing 450lbs, belly so big shirt doesn't cover it.

&gt;Be nice - she has super cool, fit daughter, and got nothing against mom.

&gt;Girl takes mom to acoustic guitar room. 

&gt;Ask if they need assistance.

&gt;NOPE

&gt;Cool, back to working on guitar repair.

&gt;co-worker bro walks in after seeing all the guitars on the floor and not up on wall hangers.

&gt;mom having girl take them all down to play, but doesn't want them put back onto the wall yet.

&gt;Co-worker says not to leave guitars on floor, starts putting them back on wall hangers. 

Keep in mind, some of these are well over $1000 guitars. 

&gt;mom can't get big hamhock arm around guitar to play.

&gt;get's frustrated, drops guitar on ground, asks daughter for another.

MFW when she just flopped down a $2500 guitar, dings and cracks hurt value. plus... really??

&gt;mom flaps noise hole open - ""I need a thin guitar, all of yours are too big to play""

&gt;co-worker grabs thinnest guitar we have, but it has a rounded plastic back instead of a flat wood back.

&gt;mom can't even hold it against her

&gt;keeps slipping off.

&gt;mom yells that we don't have any guitars she can play because all of ours are too big

&gt;daughter can play them all without a problem.

&gt;demands we get thinner guitar from back

&gt;tell her what she sees is what we got.

&gt;starts crying

&gt;mom gets up starts walking out of store.

&gt;tells daughter that she shouldn't play guitar, its only made for men to play.

&gt;MFW

tl:dr - mom is too fat to play guitar.
thin privilege is being able to play a standard size guitar.

EDIT - Update - The girl has still continued to come in for her lesson and bought a pack of strings telling me she is still into playing. Her dad, again, parents are divorced, apologized to the store about her mom's rude behavior and lack of respect for the instruments.

Years later: 

&gt;mom calls me, very upset. Dad dying. Can I come?

&gt;get on plane

Wait for it. 

&gt; spend weeks handling all this, including dad asking me to take him off life support. I did. Also mother had stroke. Lot of shit going on. Where was sister? BUSY. SHE IS A VERY BUSY AND IMPORTANT ACCOUNTANT. She might drive the few miles, IF she can. Maybe.

&gt;took him weeks to die

&gt;mom recovering from stroke

&gt;AND HERE COMES HAMPLANET SISTER. 

&gt;Bitch is easily twice my size. And I am not tiny. Was 5'4"" and 180 by the time I left. I lost weight out of sheer stress, no joke.

&gt;She can't be fucking  bothered to come take care of our mom, 15 minute drive; but I fly in and suddenly it's ""let's go visit mom"" day

&gt;pissed off. Back from hospital putting dad to sleep (taking him off life support). Killed my dad. Not in good mood. 

&gt;had made bunch of healthy stuff for me and mom, next few days will be awful, don't wanna cook

&gt;went outside to sit in rain and feel sorry for self

&gt;sister comes out and explains to me that she's always hated me, because I'm not like her

&gt;everyone should be all about getting money

&gt;also, everyone knows I'm a worthless piece of shit drunk

&gt;? o rly and yet who's here handling all this

&gt;sis huffs and bails back in

&gt;I sit and listen to rain and feel it on me. Still alive. 

about an hour goes by

&gt;come back in. Almost everything gone, dishes and platters fucking everywhere

&gt;sister has eaten *everything*. Three week's worth of food. THREE WEEKS OF FOOD. What the actual fuck.

&gt;picked up some random platter, wandered into living room, mom cut off sound, I held up platter and just gave sis and her fiance the hairiest eyeball ever and started hissing. Not yelling. Hissing. 

&gt; Fatball sister bails in a huff, spewing shit about ""well I make more money!""

&gt;..o rly? How bout flipping some cash my way to make up for all the food you just ate? Which I paid for? Or cleaning up your mess? No? Well, go fuck yourself then.

&gt; dad dies

&gt;sister too busy making money

&gt;only me and mom care

&gt;My dad's last words? I hadn't seen him in ten years; he looked up at me, sighed, and said ""you were always the good one"".

&gt;before I fly back home, spend a few days cooking a bunch of stuff for mom, completely packing her freezer with healthy stuff that she's just got to heat up. mom not being into cooking, will eat garbage otherwise. Told her that if sis comes over and eats it all, I'm flying back and will pound sis into a greasy smear on the floor. Being ex-military and all whereas sis is not. Mom listened, sis never got a crumb of any of it. 

And my sister NEVER visited Dad while he was still able to talk. Prob too busy eating and making money.  

Fuck her. There's more, of course. Like how she was gonna kill my mom's dogs. I'll tell you that one soon. 

My sister is a grade-A superlative asshole. She hides it well; but she's greedy, mean, bitchy, and will stab you in the back in a heartbeat. Who on earth would ever come tell their sister she's a drunk loser after that sister just came home to take care of their half-dead mother, and honored their father's living will? Somehow she saw fit to explain to me what a waste of oxygen loser I am, right after I pulled Dad's plug, and while Mom was still too sick to go to the bathroom by herself. Didn't see Sis around for any of that. She sure let me know what a loser I am a week later though. 

She is cunning enough to know when she can steal all your food, and she will do it. She is too lazy to learn to cook; but will eat or steal anything and everything homecooked. You have NO idea how much this pisses me off. My mom is not a good cook; left to her own devices, will eat garbage, so I cooked enough to fill her freezer, stuf like marinated chicken that I'd grilled and bagged, stuffed the freezer, and then more to fill her fridge. And sister **emptied** both, and left the plates and platters all over the damn house. Because I'm a loser drunk, you see, so it's my job to clean up after her hamplanet self. I wasn't in the mood for this. Shit went south in a hurry. My poor mom. I told her to go upstairs to her room, get out of the blast zone; and she went. 

I'll give Sis credit, though, for never pulling the beetus or thighroid card. No. She's just ""big-boned"". Seriously, THAT is what she says. Her bones, if you circle both of our wrists, are smaller than mine. And my wrist is half the size of hers, but my bones are noticeably bigger. 

I do not weigh 300 pounds. I've altered my diet and have lost 30 pounds in the last year. I know that's not much, but hell, better than nothing. Her? She got fatter. 

Apologies for any typos. I'm drunk. Will post more soon. 

I am so pissed off at her. To this day, she's still trying to make me the bad guy. 

EDIT: the dog story is not a FPS story, , so I'm posting a short version here. There was nothing fatlogic about it, just megabitch. I have noticed that a lot of FPS stories have several common denominators, and one is complete selfishness. Which this one is. So here's the ""killing dogs"" anecdote. 

""mom came to visit me, stayed with us a month, parked her very much loved purebred dogs with sis. Sis had a conniption over some nonsensical bullshit and threatened to kill my mother's dogs. Mom went completely bugfuck hysterical, thought she was gonna have another stroke, she was all ""I gotta get on a plane now! My dogs!"". Somehow my son calmed everyone down, took him hours though.
I don't get why the fuck you'd completely freak out a woman who nearly died of a stroke 6 months ago like that, I really don't. I was ready to get on a plane myself and go beat the snot out of Sis.""

Not much fatlogic, amirite. 

I seriously cannot remember ever being this pissed off in my life. Son had to calm me down too. I was online booking a flight for myself so I could go beat the fuck out of this chick. 

Same chick who insulted me by offering to make me her in-house cook and maid, btw. 

Must piss her off that I did fairly well once I got out of state, and she's overextended. Suck my dick.

Today brings in a story about a matriarch type planet called Paunchpaunch, and how she singlehandedly ruined my evening and possibly a fair bit of tomorrow. Also Im not going to greentext much of this because my thyroid is acting up and the doctor said I should be careful with my exertions because my knees. 

So normally at The Breadstick Garden, theres a maximum of 8 people before grat gets added (18%). I had other tables, so I was not up at the front to see Paunchpaunch and family battling wits with the seventeen year old hostess, but supposedly it goes as follows:

&gt;be seventeen year old hostess

&gt;bright eyed, bushy tailed etc.

&gt;See thin man and children walk in greet.exe

&gt;Uh oh

&gt;Sadly inform man of our no animal policy and tell him his shaved moose will have to wait outside

&gt;World weary man turn his eyes to me, they look as though they have seen a thousand deaths. 

&gt;Informs me this is his wife

&gt;Wonder if we count by heads or by souls

&gt;Decide flesh should be the standard, but where to put them?

&gt;I know

&gt;Blackshirt.


At this moment, all the hair on my neck stood up. A cool shiver ran down my spine and dissipated through my buttcheeks. (Seriously does this happen to other people? My ass tingles when I'm nervous.) I knew something was wrong. Like thousands of breadsticks all cried out at once, and then...silence. The hostess came up to me and informed me I've just been sat at the big party table with 8. No problemo.

&gt;Get to table

&gt;Holy shit 

&gt;Dont stare

&gt;What are you doing

&gt;Shut your mouth

&gt;Jesus say something

&gt;""Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" 

&gt;Something else

This was the fattest woman I have ever seen. And I live in Texas. I cant even guess at the weight. Large enough to be in a scooter, barely. Large enough to have her upper arms droop at least 6"" over her forearms, and her entire gut covered her lap to the knees. This woman had two laps.

&gt;A wild Paunchpaunch appears!

&gt;Blackshirt uses gape!

&gt;Its not very effective!

&gt;""Hi there guys, welcome to Breadstick Garden, would you be interested in-

If theres 8 we gotta pay extra right?

&gt;Uh yes maam, theres gratuity added for 8 people or more. Would you like to-

Ones a baby, he dont count.

&gt;look for baby

&gt;wat

&gt;youngest kid there probably 8

&gt;""Er, there seems to be eight of you here, so uh-

Paunchpaunch demands to see manager. 

&gt;disgonasuck

My manager explained to me that she had already had this conversation with the hostess, and himself and that Paunchpaunch and crew would indeed have to pay the gratuity. He goes to deliver the news. 

&gt;Return suspiciously to table

&gt;Ready to bolt at slightest provocation

&gt;""Okay guys, would you like a sample of our house wine? Or can I get you started with something to drink?""

&gt;Paunchpaunch will not look at me.

&gt;Whole family looking at Paunchpaunch 

&gt;""We aint payin the extra.""

&gt; ""Maam, we have a policy here that states if theres 8 or more people including children, there is an automatic gratuity added. Did my manager come speak with you yet?""

&gt;We AINT payin EXTRA!""

&gt;Go get manager

&gt;Explain situation

&gt;He asks if I'll take table with no grat

&gt;FUCK no. 

&gt;He goes to talk to her, again when the unthinkable happens.

&gt;Husband comes up to me. Stares right through me, his eyes yearning to be in another time, another life. He looks bent somehow, burdened. 

&gt;Explains to me he is going to just wait in the (nearby) mall.

&gt;My heart. 

&gt;He looks like a molested string bean

&gt;Tell him he can have a table right here with me, I will take him separate. 

&gt;He shakes his head and walks away, his fate sealed long ago.

&gt;Return to table.

&gt;Paunchpaunch looking smug as fuck.

The rest of the night was quick and quiet. I didnt speak another word except to the children. I didnt time or hold the food. Salad, food, check, get out. No tip of course. No grat for seven. No peace from this rustling. Her husband was semi attractive too. And they had 6 kids. He mounted that woman six times. (Or more likely, once and she somehow coaxed another five men onto her as well.) 

As I watched her wolf down her meal, I thought sadly of that man, walking around alone in the mall. Licking his lips maybe. Perhaps pretending his life hadnt gone horribly awry and he was waiting for his human sized wife.

TL;DR By the power of Muh Muh’s ~~husband~~ handler, Muh Muh makes it out of the store. Barely.

Before we start, I have to quickly address the subreddit. Judging by the comments and PM’s I’ve been getting, it’s been brought to my attention that I’ve been making a lot of brave FPS warriors sick, and for that I apologize. Prioritizing my job and summer classes ahead of your storybeetus cundishuns is inexcusable, selfish, and shaming. For your instantaneous inhalation, I present Part IV of Muh Muh’s Odyssey.

If your gloopcose-deprived brains can recall, Part III left off after Muh Muh had a rather violent kinetic disagreement with several cases of wine, got worked up, had (literal) diarrhea of the mouth, and demanded that no one call for an ambulance. For a lack of a better option, her husband had been called and was presently on his way.

Let me reintroduce the ‘Mart characters, in case you’ve forgotten them. Read [Lardquisha]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d4s3e/part_1_lardquisha_and_the_moons/) and [Porridge]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3lx1/the_tales_of_porridge_part_i_a_hamplanet_gains/) stories for further refreshments (of your memory, of course), teehee! And, yes, I will be using abbreviations, typing out the names burns too many calories and gets muh beetus in a bundle, so mufuckin’ deal widdit!

Ms. Bitchy Blonde (BB): 4’9 110lbs of platinum-dyed bitchiness. The manager of the 3rd shift grocery department.

Flabby Patty (FP): 6’4 400lbs of useless 3rd shift store manager. 
~~Often~~ Perpetually driving a mobility scooter, the ones meant for the customers I might add.

Guitar Hero Bro (GHB): 5’9 160lbs of beta awesomeness. Unfortunate soul upon whom Porridge feeds.

Tiff: 5’0 120lbs of DD knockers and quiet niceness. Total QTPie. Ohhhhhh muh god, pieeeeeeeeee…

Sorry, my cundishun flared up for a second, had to inhale an emergency dutch apple crumb. I’m living my life with a rare form of Hypoconfectionary Thighrobeetus which causes intense pie cravings and death if I consume less than 3 whole pies a day.

But, being the strong person I am, I will deprive myself of more pie for a minute like a skinny anorexic bitch and risk my health to get this typed out for you fatties. We have an adventure to finish, after all, so without further ado, on to the conclusion of the Odyssey of Muh Muh!


&gt;Finally clocking in, technically now an hour late (yes, I got written up for this)


&gt;Decide to visit GHB in the dairy cooler to discuss the Muh Muh incident as it had unfolded thus far, many LOL’s were had, as I recount all I saw


&gt;Tiff pops her head in and asks if I’d like to help her find Daughtermoon


&gt;Although it tears my soul apart to be on the clock but not actually working, I agree to help. Cuz I’m selfless like that


&gt;In no time, we spot a pudgy thigh and lovehandle, as well as a dirty baby-containing pile of blankets beneath a clothes rack


&gt;We crouch to talk to DM, who has a tearful, pouty look on her perfectly round face


&gt;Upon gentle coaxing by Tiff, however, DM begins a full on temper tantrum complete with wailing and ground kicking, interspersed with bouts of desperate wheezing


&gt;likeMuhMuhlikedaughter.mustbesoproud


&gt;Just as we’re about to give up (“We’re not getting paid enough for the bullshit,” Tiff’s mutters), DM’s wails cease, and she shrinks further back into the clothes rack


&gt;DAUGHTERMOON used HIDE ! It’s not very effective …


&gt;Simultaneously, the baby begins an ominous, unearthly wail


&gt;I see Tiff shudder, I’m suddenly covered in goosebumps


&gt;It approaches


&gt;thudthudthud*thudthudthud*THUDTHUDTHUD


&gt;I stand up and turn in time to see a Wildebeetus charging into the store, just as Ms. BB steps into the center aisle


&gt;The Wildebeetus is moving incredibly fast for its size, so fast I can hardly get a look, and—what’s this?!—he’s headed right towards Ms. BB!


&gt;For one hopeful moment, I thought Ms. BB was about to be done in, trampled to oblivion by the Wildebeetus, but it was not to be


&gt;With an impressive braking mechanism, it huffs to a halt mere inches from my unfortunate manager, whereupon he growls to her face in a dangerously quiet, through-the-teeth tone:


&gt;“Whurr is she? Whurrs muh fuckin’ bitchofa wife?”


&gt;Seeing the Wildebeetus in such close proximity to the tiny Ms. BB puts him into perspective, and I can’t help but feast my eyes


&gt;I note immediately that the Wildebeetus is actually a rare and exquisite specimen of the Globular Trashius Beerguttiae variety of hill giant


&gt;I consider how blessed I am to live in an area of the US where these specimens live so I can bask in their majesty, especially now, considering so many of my FPS comrades have never been lucky enough to have the life changing opportunity to view a live hill giant


&gt;No… no, that analogy isn’t fair to hill giants, now I feel bad


&gt;The Wildebeetus certainly was massive, though. Standing at least 6’5 and soaring easily past 450lbs, poor Ms. BB was dwarfed by this creature that was easily 4x bigger than she was


&gt;Oddly, the creature wasn’t entirely composed of fat, his arms and legs were massive slabs of rage-coiled muscle, underlying a prodigious beer gut and a single, massive underchin sack complete with a patchy stubble neck beard


&gt;Atop the monstrosity was a perfectly round head, covered by a bona fide, board certified mullet and a small round bald spot right on top


&gt;The Wildebeetus wore a cut off Garth Brooks T-shirt, cut off jorts that were entirely too short, dirty white crew socks and work boots


&gt;Be still my beating ~~heart~~ thighroid!


&gt;Ms. BB, to her credit, showed no signs of intimidation. Nor did she make any pretention that she didn’t already know who the “bitchofa wife” was. Instead, she pointed with a jerky motion over her shoulder


&gt;Wildebeetus walks past Ms. BB without another word, and after only a few more steps spots the heap of flesh that is Muh Muh


&gt;Muh Muh is sleeping once again (we just let her sit there, as there was no other alternative and she had stopped yelling), titanic snores sounding like a pig drowning in molasses


&gt;Muh Muh’s incredible number of curves prop her directly upward, and from the look of her increasingly large and now nearly black ankles/tree trunks, she is beginning to feel the effect of sitting for too long without elevating her legs


&gt;The Wildebeetus only takes a second to take in the wine and vomit-soaked Muh Muh, before (you might have seen this coming) beginning an earsplitting tirade starting with “sun*ofa*BITCH!”


&gt;”WHUT THE FUCK YEW DOIN’ OUTTA THE HOUSE YOU FAT PIECEO’SHIT!? I HAD TUH DRIVE ALL THE WAY FROM WORK TO COME PICK UP YERR SORRY ASS LOOK WHUT THE FUCK YOU DID YOU CRAZY BITCH!”


&gt;A lesser woman would’ve cried or at least blanched from such vulgar reprobation from her husband, but as you know by now, there is nothing “lesser” about Muh Muh—she’s a strong, curvy womyn after all!


&gt;Muh Muh counterattacks: “YEW DUN GIT ME MUH MEDICUN SO AH HAD TUH GIT IT MUHSELF! AND I DIN DO NUTHIN, IT WAS LIKE THIS WHEN AH GOT HERE!”


&gt;Note about ten minutes ago she had repeatedly told my manager she doesn't even drink


&gt;Note also Muh Muh is sitting in a pool of wine on a wine-soaked scooter that just died under her


&gt;Hell, there are flecks of wood and glass stuck to the front of the cart where the impact occurred, but she had *nothing* to do with it guise, the mess was there when she got there!


&gt;My sides cannot take this abuse, yet the yelling continues to grow in volume and vulgarity, Muh Muh’s whale call overlaid majestically with the Wildebeetus’s guttural bellows


&gt;The fact that Muh Muh is completely helpless and confined to an unmoving scooter does not deter her in the slightest from throwing every insult she can at the Wildebeetus


&gt;Both decide to take a break to gasp for air, and the store is suddenly quiet—I note that my ears are ringing (and have been ringing ever since)


&gt;FB is sitting on his scooter on the opposite side of center aisle, looking on at this spectacle, occasionally flapping his hands in a helpless manner


&gt;FP is stunned to see another human being that rivals his own size, and frankly, so is the rest of the store


&gt;All at once, one of Muh Muh’s inhales sucks something into the grease pipe, and she suddenly acquires a heaving cough but further inability to breathe means she’s practically gasping for air


&gt;The Wildebeetus takes advantage of this distraction, and wades into the vomit/wine puddle, braces on the back of the cart, gets low, and pushed with a force greater than the gravitational force of a thousand hamplanets, evident because *the cart actually moves*


&gt;Such strength is truly impressive, but the cart only moves a few feet before stopping—even the Wildebeetus cannot move 1/3 of a ton of flesh that is Muh Muh


&gt;The Wildebeetus in extreme frustration, yells directly into Muh Muh’s ear: “STEP ON THE FUCKIN’ GAS!”


&gt;Muh Muh replies, “UH CAYUNT ITS *COUGH COUGH* FUCKIN’ BROKEN *COUGH* GODDAMN STORE CAYUNT GIT CARTS FOR WOMYN LAK ME!”


&gt;”*WOMAN!?* YOU AINT NO WOMAN YOU A MUTHERFUCKIN’ COW! YOU’RE TWO MUTHERFUCKIN COWS PUT TOGETHER! TWO UGLY FUCKIN COWS IS WHAT YEW ARE!


&gt;”FUCK YERR TOO YA HILLBILLY PIECE UH SHIT!” Muh Muh shrieks back, and with a final hack, she works up another prodigious lugi that she attempts to spit upon the Wildebeetus’s boot


&gt;The disgusting ball of acidic, bloody mucus only manages to stick to her chin, and ends up mostly on her T-shirt


&gt;MUH MUH used SLUDGEBOMB ! MUH MUH’s attack missed !


&gt;”*JIST STEP ON THE FUCKIN’ GAS!*” roars the Wildebeetus


&gt;At last Muh Muh does, and I witnessed a miracle that day. Jesus himself comes from heaven and touches big amigo, raising him from the dead, for the electric motor actually kicks into a very low sounding action and the cart moves


&gt;Not before the Wildebeetus goes down on one knee, in the puddle of vomit and wine


&gt;He is undeterred, however, and the cart makes steady progress towards the door. Muh Muh has not ceased her beratement, but the argument is now one-sided as the Wildebeetus is winded and sweating profusely from moving Muh Muh through the store


&gt;Cursing the whole way, Muh Muh is wheeled out of the store to a rusty, brown astrovan-like vehicle


&gt;A triple wide wheelchair is procured from the van, and after a number of threats and more shouting, Muh Muh is convinced to stand up, pivot and fall into the wheelchair—with much assistance by the Wildebeetus, of course


&gt;GHB and I are having a smoke at the other entrance to store watching the developments, dying with laughter. Even the timid Tiff cannot help but giggle and the absurdity of these two


&gt;A hydraulic lift is lowered from the back end of the astrovan, Muh Muh is pushed onto the lift… “No way, she’ll never fit” thinks I


&gt;The motor on the hydraulic lift starts up, getting lower and lower pitched as, instead of Muh Muh moving upwards, *the back end of the van is lowering until the tires are contacting the wheel well* whereupon the motor stops


&gt;Thin privilege is not destroying every electric motor you come into contact with


&gt;This process is ritual to the Wildebeetus, who gets behind Muh Muh and lifts with all his might. With the assistance of the motor, he gets Muh Muh up and essentially shoves her into the van


&gt;MFW I have no face because the Wildebeetus has to tuck parts of Muh Muh in, she looks like a giant fleshy cork stuffed into the van’s trunk


&gt;Without further ado, he hops into the van, starts it and drives off, the back tires scraping the wheel wells at every little bump


&gt;We can hear Muh Muh and the Wildebeetus screaming at each other even with the doors closed, in fact we hear them screaming till they exit the parking lot and drive off


&gt;I say a silent, teary farewell to Muh Muh, who has made this a night to remember


&gt;”Well, back to work” thinks I, abysmal at the prospect of the rest of the mundane night


&gt;GHB comments that Ms. BB insinuated to him that we would be assisting with cleanup duty


&gt;I groan, but Tiff stops in her tracks, and makes the night interesting 
once more with one simple line:


&gt;”Where’s Daughtermoon?”

1373031286.0	1hou99	I Did A Bad Thing Guys Part II!		570	97	48	"It has been several months, but people are still commenting on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dcje6/i_did_a_bad_thing_guys/) story a lot, lately. So I figured I would give an update for those curious. Sorry it took me so long to do so, I figured interest had died out. Apparently not. LOL

EP did attempt to get her no longer beta boyfriend back, and he refused. She showed up at his apartment at all hours of the night, his work, his family's houses (including where we were that night, which was his brother's place), some of his friends. She caused scenes at every single one, and tried these pseudo-intellectual arguments to try and get him to ""see reason"". I don't know what arguments she used, but he said that she treated it like a debate, or a lecture.

For awhile, she tried to blame me. She started off by telling people I had slept with him. When that just pissed him off more for being a blatant lie, she said we hadn't slept together, but I *said* we did that night when we were alone (we never were alone the entire night). Again, people weren't buying her shit, even the people who texted me the next day to ask what was up. 

Eventually, she broke into his apartment in a last ditch effort to get him back. He said she had put candles everywhere, made dinner, had music playing. He had walked through the door and nearly shit himself, thinking some crazed madman was about to rape him in the most romantic way possible. Until EP came walking out of the kitchen looking like Betty Crocker's fatter sister in an apron, telling him that she had done all of that for him, so he had to give her a chance. 

No joke, she said it just like that. So she was 100% aware of the boundary violation she had just committed. He was so fed up at this point (he had nearly lost his job because of her) that he called the cops. She flips the fuck out, screaming at him, then tries to run. Actually falls down the stairs of the building where he lived and hurt her ankle enough that she needed his help to get up. Actually tried to have him *help her to the car* so she could get away from the cops. 

[LOL Nope!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nope.gif)

The cops get there eventually, I have no idea how much time passed between him getting home and their arrival.  They are going to arrest her and she is sobbing and begging the ex not to press charges. The officer pulls him aside tells him that he can press the charges and they can take her in, but that not much is likely to happen since she didn't hurt him or threaten to hurt him at any point, nor was any property destroyed. She had gotten in using a spare key he had forgotten she had. That he would be better off just letting her go, filing an official disturbance report, and then getting a restraining order if she continued. 

At this point the the ex was just like, whatever. So the cop went over to EP, put the fear of God into her psycho stalker brain about how the ex had agreed not to press charges, but that she was walking a thin line. She was promising never to come near him again, and so they let her go. 

Not sure if he has heard from her since, but at the time he was telling this story (this all happened over the course of a couple of weeks after the breakup) he hadn't."	t5_2vzax	True

I have another trough of beetus-filled goodies to spread around. It's been a while because I haven't been around Kirby much so I haven't had anything to really tell. But her mom wanted a set of stools re-covered (I like fixing up furniture in my spare time and re-selling it) So I was forced to see Kirby twice, when I dropped off the stools, this happened...

It starts off slow, but fat rage takes over, give it time, and secure your jimmies, remember Kirby be crazy. But I finally snapped on her FPS, i finally just let her have it.. (btw, if you were wondering about the arrest and everything, she took a deal where she would go to anger management and counseling if Sgt. Tank the Freedom Warrior would drop the charges, with him being deployed, he said forget it and let her get the help, oh and he and FAB are doing awesome!)

&gt;be me

&gt;14 lbs lighter because walking everywhere and doing portion control meals

&gt;Kirbys house is 3 doors down, so I just take the 2 stools and walk to PM and PD house

&gt;door is open, so I just yell ""PM, you home? I have your stools.""

&gt;PM says door is open, come in

&gt;get door open and walk to kitchen to put stools by the counter

&gt;turn corner and Kirby is sitting at the table with a guy that looks like the [gamer meme] (http://digitalterium.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/meme-friki.jpg) cuddled and ""teehee-ing""

&gt;OOH HAI LEADFOOT!! THIS IS (we will call him Kirby Chaser)

&gt;Uh.....hi....so PM, you need to make sure to not use anything but-

&gt;Oversized Kirby cuts me off ""THIS IS OVERSIZED KIRBY CHASER, I MET HIM AT ONE OF MAI CLASSES! TEEHEE!""

&gt;PM gives me a pained, disgusted look

&gt;Uh....hi OKC, so only use leather cleaner on this, and make sure to not-

&gt;Kirby gets up and grabs the mayo covered hoagie she is working on and cuts me off again

&gt;We are on a diet, see!!!! 

&gt;she holds up the sandwich as she tries to scurry around the counter

&gt;her foot catches on the stool leg and she wobbles

&gt;instead of catching herself, her little beady eyes zero in on the sandwich

&gt;OK is too top heavy to balance herself

&gt;her front foot that she is trying to catch herself with gets pushed forward by the mass that is her body

&gt;still gripping dat sandwich

&gt;so much mayo on it, as she slides and tries to not drop it, it squishes it and mayo and some kind of yellow sauce starts dripping out

&gt;front foot slides and kirby goes down

&gt;full splits, one leg front, one leg back

&gt;Kirby falls to the side, sandwich still in hands

&gt;Kirby chaser is up now, trying to help her up

&gt;wtf, he is about 6'0"" and has about 50 lbs on her

&gt;IM OK KC, GIT MAH SANDWICH

&gt;In a feat I've never seen before, Kirby uses walls, the stools, her....boyfriend, and actually gets up

&gt;I look over at the counter as Kirby and KC hobble back over to the table

&gt;Cheesey bread, 5 empty packets of Buddings Turkey deli meat, mayo, honey mustard, bacon bits, and about 8 cheese wrappers are sitting on the counter, lettuce is opened but barely touched, tomato has maybe 2 slices gone off of it

&gt;SEE , we are eating SOOO healthy!!!! KC is helping me with my diet

&gt;I kind of just stare in amazement and give a small nod

&gt;KC and OK share a small kiss

&gt;gag.jpg

&gt;they get up and grab a bag of chips and head back to her room

&gt;PM apologizes, then thanks me for re-doing her bar stools

&gt;I ask her how shes been

&gt;engage small talk about our gardens

&gt;suddenly hear a whale being murdered 

&gt;thats strange, we dont live near the ocean

&gt;oh wait, nope, thats just Kirby

&gt;I used to be in the medical field, so my instinct is that something is wrong, go to see whats wrong

&gt;PM yells for me to stop

&gt;hear a male whale being murdered now

&gt;are they................OH MY BOB THEY ARE HAVING SEX

&gt;PM says ""i cannot wait for that application to go through""

&gt;I choke back a laugh mixed with disgust and ask her what shes talking about

&gt;Kirby apparently has decided to move in with her new ""love""

&gt;PM just wants her out

&gt;I head for the door, PM follows, she doesnt wanna hear the mating of the whales either

&gt;get outside and can still hear them going at it

&gt;keep hearing ""plop, plop, plop, plop, plop"" sounds

&gt;their fat is slapping against.....each other.....itself? I don't wanna know.........

&gt;hear two loud screams at the same time, then a crashing noise

&gt;PM pulls out a joint, lights it up, and walks in the house

&gt;I'm standing there in horror, dunno whether to run home, or satisfy curiosity of crashing noise

&gt;going to go home

&gt;lolnope.jpg

&gt;""KIRBY CHASER!! WHAT THE HELL!??!?!!?!""

&gt;PM yells ""LEADFOOT, I NEED YOUR HELP!!""

&gt;Kirby has thrown on a tarp, that I later decide is one of those plus size ""one size fits most"" dresses

&gt;kirby is panicking

&gt;i walk into the house to PM yelling for help again

&gt;I mentally shut down as I walk into Kirbys room

&gt;Food wrappers EVERYWHERE, fruit flies so bad you can't get away from them

&gt;and Kirby's boyfriend on the floor with his ass stuck in between two bars of the metal bed frame, the bed broken

&gt;he's butt naked, but I cant see anything because his front gut is hanging so low, it covers everything

&gt;me and PM manage to get him up while Kirby is yelling at us to ""hurry the fuck up, he's hurt""

&gt;wannaslapabitchsohard.exe

&gt;manage to pull him up, the bed frame still stuck to his ass, literally looks like the metal bed frame grew a pair of lips

&gt;nope, just his stuck ass-cheeks

&gt;I do the only logical thing I can think of to hurry up and nope the fuck out of there

&gt;I walk around to the front of him and kick the bed frame as hard as I can

&gt;hear the ""sloop"" sound of metal on skin as the bed frame dislodges from the grips of his ass-cheeks and crashes to the floor

&gt;Kirby starts yelling about how this is all PM's fault, she shouldn't have had to ""secretly"" tried to have sex, shes over 18 after all

&gt;eyeroll.avi

&gt;I look at her and say ""secretly? We heard you all the way outside, Kirby""

&gt;Kirby's beady eyes lock in on me and she says ""at least I dont get bruises from my sex life, all your bones probably poke each other during sex""

&gt;""actually, im still overwei-"" i try to say

&gt;""and you know what else, KC loves MUH CURVES, you aint no real woman, you've even lost weight since ive seen you, at least I'm getting some, unlike some of you old, washed up, married, skinny bitches""

&gt;""Kirby you might want to stop right there, I-""

&gt;""NO! I'M NOT GONNA STOP, YOU SKINNY BITCHES HAVE BULLIED ME SO MUCH THAT I HAVE TO GO TO CLASSES NOW"" (WHAT?!?!) ""GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, YOU PSYCHO BULLY""

&gt;thisbitchdonegoneanddoneit

&gt;engage full LeadFoot bitch side

&gt;I snap FPS. I finally let politeness go out the window.

&gt;""Kirby, YOU brought all of that on yourself for being such a shitty human being, you harassed my brother into getting a restraining order on you-""

&gt;I KNOW HE WANTED M-

&gt;""Kirby, shut.the.fuck.up. right now, so help me, i will break a bitches neck that tries to mess with me or my family.""

&gt;her mouth is open in shock

&gt;""You are the most disgusting, sorry excuse for a human I have ever met, your ""curves"" are going to kill you in 5-10 years, and no one can stand to be around someone that treats people like shit on the bottom of their shoe, you are a crazy, selfish bitch with zero self-control, and you need to be committed""

&gt;I turn and walk out

&gt;As I get to the counter, I see a bottle of Dawn on the sink

&gt;I turn to a still shocked kirby and toss it to her and lay my last line out there

&gt;""wash with this, you fucking smell like sweaty gym socks that have been dipped in month old milk, it's Dawn, so it'll take a few layers of grease off too""

&gt;I walk out and hear PM failing to stifle her laughter

&gt;There was a moving truck outside yesterday, Kirby is gone. We will see how long this lasts. 

PM and I actually had a nice convo on the back deck over some tea, and she seemed genuinely non-stressed since the first time we met.

Thin privilege is being able to have sex without your boyfriend breaking the bed and getting his ass stuck in the foot board.

&gt;Living the nightmare, chasing the dream

&gt;Work there for two months

&gt;Really cool coworkers.

&gt;Cool boss lady, who we will call ""Annie."" Still friends with her to this day.

&gt;Assistant boss guy. We'll call him ""David"" (Not in this story, but will be in future stories)

&gt;Other coworker (also will be in future stories) who we will call ""Bree""

&gt;And the star of our sad little show. She has a name, but due to her rapid expansion, we will call her Turboham.

Onto the story.

&gt;At work one day

&gt;6 hour closing shift

&gt;Closing with Turboham

&gt;Never met her before, only know that she's a new hire

&gt;Also the girlfriend of a different store's manager

&gt;Somewhat excited, because new hires are (usually) awesome

&gt;Supposed to start at the same time as me

&gt;Start work alone

&gt;One hour later, still alone

&gt;Then commenced the beginning of the end

&gt;Windows begin to shake

&gt;Ground quaking

&gt;Light outside getting dimmer

&gt;[mfw I think I'm gonna die.](http://h-4.abload.de/img/notlikethis3rxq.gif)

&gt;Door opens

&gt;In trundles a small planet, holding a bag stuffed with McDonalds

&gt;It turns it's head towards me

&gt;Opens it's gaping maw

&gt;It speaks in the human tongue

&gt;TH: ""Hi! I'm Turboham. I'm your new coworker!""

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/1062.gif)

&gt;Me: ""Well, hi. I'm Strange_Bedfellow. Could I ask why you were late?""

&gt;TH: ""Teehee sorry. Dinner with my parents ran late. Mom just can't cook ^^teehee""

&gt;[mfw I realize she ate immediately before going to McDonalds](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/omg/VU7DZ.gif)

&gt;Me: ""Alright. No problem. Let's just show you how to work the till.""

&gt;TH: ""Well, I already know how to use the till.""

&gt;Me: ""I don't follow""

&gt;TH: ""I used to work at this company 3 years ago, and my bf is a manager at -other location-, so I know what I'm doing. That also means I've got seniority. You need to do what I say.""

&gt;[hfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/you-aint-sht.gif)

&gt;Words fail me. I just stare

&gt;Turboham reaches into her McD's bag and proceeds to create a series of small sonic booms with the speed at which her arms travel from food to mouth

&gt;She uses both arms in a highly synchronized alternating fashion

&gt;iseeyouvedonethisbefore.jpg

&gt;She burps

&gt;Me: ""Alright, now that you're done, how about we actually, you know, do some work.""

&gt;TH ""I just need to go for a smoke first.""

&gt;pleasetellmeyourejoking.bmp

&gt;She isn't

&gt;Goes out for a smoke

&gt;See her smoking, chatting on cell phone through glass doors

&gt;10 minutes go by

&gt;15

&gt;20

&gt;30

&gt;She's on her third smoke

&gt;Still on her phone

&gt;Have to deal with customers

&gt;15 minutes later, after customers leave

&gt;Turboham still MIA

&gt;goodriddance.flac

&gt;[mfw the door opens and she walks in carrying a KFC bag](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/omg/robocop.gif)

&gt;She sees mfw

&gt;TH: ""Teehee sorry. Talking to my bf makes me hungry""

&gt;She actually said ""bf.""

&gt;Guise, srsly

&gt;Guise

&gt;srsly

&gt;She goes to the back room to feed

&gt;20 minutes later, she comes out

&gt;TH: ""Okay Bedfellow, I'm going to help some customers.""

&gt;idoubtthatverymuch.thought

&gt;Me: ""Sure thing""

&gt;TH: ""Be a good boy and deal with the receiving.""

&gt;Goes to the one customer in the store, a kid no older than 16

&gt;I turn back to my work (was already doing receiving. As evidenced by the large box I had open next to me.)

&gt;Trying to get shit done, when I hear it

&gt;Teehee

&gt;Look up

&gt;Turboham is twirling her (greasy) hair around her finger, doing that stupid foot thing and giggling

&gt;Teen customer is searching for an exit strategy

&gt;Stammers out something about his mom waiting for him

&gt;Nopes right the fuck out of there

&gt;Turboham looks at me

&gt;TH: ""Well, I think I deserve a break""

&gt;wat

&gt;wat

&gt;wat

&gt;Walks out door while I'm still picking my jaw up off the floor

&gt;See her on cell phone again

&gt;Lights up smoke

&gt;Disappears

&gt;Returns half an hour later with another bag of fast food

&gt;Confront her about it

&gt;Me: ""What the bouncing fuck are you doing?""

&gt;TH ""I told you already, talking to my bf makes me hungry and I really don't want to starve and pass out.""

&gt;[mfw.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbqg5q5V6l1riuh2bo1_400.gif)

&gt;This repeats for the next few hours til we (meaning I) close down

&gt;Go home

&gt;showerbeer

&gt;Still feel unclean

***

&gt;Go to work next day

&gt;Go to talk to Annie about Turboham

&gt;Me: ""I need to talk to you about Turboham

&gt;A: ""And I need to talk to you. Turboham tells me you really didn't make her feel welcome yesterday and made her do all the work.""

&gt;allofmywats

&gt;Me: ""That's as close to the opposite of what happened as it could possibly be.""

&gt;Recap events of last night

&gt;A: ""I sort of figured. That really didn't sound like you. You sure that what you say happened is really what happened?""

&gt;Me: ""100%. Check the cameras.""

&gt;Turboham didn't realize there were cameras. 

&gt;The fat on her eyes probably prevented her from looking up.

&gt;We watch the cameras on FFWD. Turboham was on the floor for all of 15 minutes. In a 6 (really 5) hour shift

&gt;A: ""Welp. She's not too bright, obviously. I'll have a talk with her next time she's in.

&gt;Now Annie doesn't like Turboham.

1371480233.0	1gin2n	Fries before Friends	homehealthgirl	561	89	58	"[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ghrhh/baconators_are_more_important_than_safety/) was your introduction to Beretta and Blondie, and saw me and Blondie being beta. Also want to slap on a warning that I know nothing of fast food protocol.

&gt; Be me, 17, our play is going past districts.

&gt; Another school, another set up day.

&gt; Beretta says she's sick can't come to set up.

&gt; Actually couldn't find a ride with anyone.

&gt; Next day we all have to find ways to the competition because our school is poor and refuse to bus us again.

&gt; insert rant about how if we were a sport we'd get a bus.

&gt; This time, I offer to drive myself and Blondie.

&gt; Everyone meets up at the high school and we get our caravan going.

&gt; In our designated classroom, running lines till we can go watch some of the other performances.

&gt; Director shows up half an hour after the rest of us, Beretta in tow.

&gt; Blondie, myself, and a few of our other friends were hanging out in one corner and Beretta  comes over.

&gt; ""Guys, thanks a lot for waiting for me!""

&gt; Um, what?

&gt; ""I thought you, Blondie, and I were going to ride together like we did laaaaast time! I got to the school and no one was there. I had call Director and make him turn around to pick me up.""

&gt; ""Beretta,"" Blondie steps in ""HHG drove this time. We were all at the school at 5AM, we were supposed to leave at 5:15. We wouldn't have waited for you anyway.""

&gt; Beretta sputters for a minute over excuses before wandering away.

Fast forward through the next couple of hours watching other plays. Now, you have to understand, myself, Beretta, and about five other people are planted audience members for our play. Because we don't want people to know, the minute the shows actually start we all take our designated seats and act like our characters. Luckily Beretta isn't trusted with any major parts so she sits in back.

Everything goes great and we get some awesome review from other schools and the judges. But, alas, it's time to pack up and go home.

&gt; Be me, helping put sound equipment in the trunk of my car when Director comes over.

&gt; ""HHG, can you come with me?""

&gt; ... I guess.

&gt; ""Beretta came with me here but I really think she should ride home with you. You know I don't care for bullying and promising her a ride then leaving her wasn't very nice.""

&gt; Director, we didn't promise her a ride.

&gt; ""She said you did.""

&gt; Don't be stupid, Director.

&gt; ""At any rate, she's really upset can you just give her a ride home? She lives closer to you anyway.""

&gt; dontbebetadon'tbebeta. Be nice. Shrug.

&gt; ""Thank you, HHG. I knew I could count on you.""

Now, you have to understand, I was in student council, president of SADD, a Student conflict resolver, a section leader in band, and a Freshman Mentor. I can't just blow up and refuse to help someone even if they are a jerk or I don't want them in my car. Director, whose wife was the Faculty Advisor for both SADD and Student Conflict Resolution, knew that I'd have to say yes when bullying was involved.

Also, I was a social outcast in middle school and had a teacher try to eat lunch with me. I know the feels of not having friends and being stuck with teachers. Feels bad, man.

&gt; Beretta come on, we're going home.

&gt; ""Really? Well, I guess I can ride with you. Hopefully you're a better driver than Blondie!"" Beretta guffaws and tries to get in the front seat.

&gt; No, Blondie rides up front. This is my car, what I say goes.

&gt; Beretta pouts but gets in the back seat.

The drive home was mostly uneventful. If Beretta tried to bitch I'd just turn the radio on. Blondie was texting back and forth with our friends in other cars and we decided that we'd meet up at Blondie's house for a bit of an after-show party. The other cars had already stopped and eaten places, or made it home to eat. It was going on 10 o'clock by the time we reached home and the only place open was ... Wendy's.

&gt; ""HHG..."" 

&gt; Don't need a crystal ball to know where this was headed.

&gt; Yeah, we're going to stop at Wendy's, Beretta, but the dining room is closed. We're hitting the drive thru.

&gt; Go through the drive thru.

&gt; Two grilled chicken sandwiches, one no mayo, the other no tomato, two small fries, one small frosty, one small ice tea. That's all for the first order.

&gt;Beretta, what would you like to feast on?

&gt; ""I want the double baconator meal, BIGGIE SIZE, a baked potato, frosty, and a large orange pop!""

&gt; Pay for the food. Receive two bags with all of our food mixed up.

&gt; Pull in to parking lot to sort this shit out.

&gt; Blondie had already handed the bigger bag back to Beretta, and was going through ours.

&gt; ""HHG, I think they forgot your chicken sandwich.""

&gt; ""They forgot my french fries!"" whined Beretta in the back seat.

&gt; Okay, we'll go through again.

&gt; Pull up to window explain problem.

&gt; Car that was behind us originally behind us again.

&gt; Huh, their order must have been wrong too.

&gt; Manager comes to window. ""Ladies, I'm sorry for the mix-up we had a similar order after yours. Can I have the chicken nugget meal back, please?""

&gt; I look at Blondie. ""We were only missing food, we didn't have any extras.""

&gt; Manager looks puzzled. ""You didn't accidentally get chicken nuggets and a medium fry in the one bag with a baked potato and Baconator?""

&gt; Blondie and I both turn to look at Beretta. There's an empty chicken nugget box on the seat next to her.

&gt; You've got to be kidding me.

&gt; Beretta, what the fuck?

&gt; ""Well, I was hungry, I figured I could eat 'cos they wouldn't want it back! If you're going to serve it again that's disgusting. I'm going to call the board of health on this restaurant!""

&gt; Manager blinks. ""Ma'am, we weren't going to serve it, we need it back for inventory purposes... but you ate it.""

&gt; Awkward silence when no one know what to do or say.

&gt; Manager sighs, hands me bag with my chicken sandwich and fries.

&gt; drive away.

&gt; Beretta, that was really fucking embarrassing.

&gt; ""How was I suppose to know I couldn't eat it?""

&gt; You didn't fucking pay for it!

&gt; ""Whatever, HHG, you're just jealous I got to ride with Director this morning.""

&gt; Yes, Beretta, I'm jealous that you rode for two hours with a chain smoking, married, 50yr old drama teacher. 

&gt; ""He probably likes me, I've seen how he looks at me. He said he wanted to cast me as the main role but couldn't. He said Blondie's body fit the ideal better.""

&gt; No, Blondie got the role because she's been acting for years in productions and because she, well, does a good job. I doubt very much it was because of her body type.

&gt; ""Nuh-uh, I know what he meant. He meant that the judges wouldn't accept me in the role because of my figure. Those horny old bastards would rather stare at someone with no tits or ass onstage than me.""

&gt; Well, that seems to be a bit of a stretch.

&gt; Blondie is trying hard not to laugh. She looks like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-31614-body-shape.htm?StartAt=14#.Ub8ZqxySmSg) and for the record was playing the role of a forty year old woman.

&gt; keep driving, have option up ahead, turn left for Blondie's house, right to take Beretta home.

&gt; Turn right.

&gt; ""What the fuck, HHG? I thought we were going to Blondie's for a party?""

&gt; You can find your own ride, Beretta, I'm done.

&gt; ""But, HHG!""

&gt; No.

&gt; Take Beretta home, go to Blondie's, most of the cast and crew come over, Beretta doesn't.

Monday, after school practice... Beretta wasn't in school all day.

&gt; Rumbling outside of auditorium.

&gt;The sound of a souped up redneck truck, common in these parts.

&gt; Director is going over judge's notes on improvements and what they liked. 

&gt; Auditorium door opens, person that could only be an evolved form of Beretta enters.

&gt; [The Behemoth](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-33429-body-shape.htm?StartAt=1#.Ub8iVhySmSg) is wearing navy blue and flower print muumuu, and sandals that are old, frayed, and dirty. Thin, dirty hair pulled back in a bun. 

&gt; ""Are you the Director!?"" she shouts from the top of the auditorium, down the stairs at us, sitting on the stage.

&gt; ""Ma'am, I'll be with you in a minute if you'd let me finish.""

&gt; ""Nah, we need to talk NOW."" Beretta sheepishly peeks out from behind the behemoth of a woman.

&gt; Director sighs, realizes she's a parent. Hands notes to student director to go over. 

&gt; ""Ma'am, why don't you come down here and we'll go to my office backstage.""

&gt; ""Ain't walking down those stairs! My knees can't take it!""

&gt; Director, just as beta as the rest of us, walks up the stairs and escorts Behemoth out into the hall to talk. Beretta stands in the doorway just staring at us.

&gt; [Like this](http://media.tumblr.com/676b253721b119f8eecffd76d8d26289/tumblr_inline_mldinaNypy1qz4rgp.gif)

&gt; Hear yelling from the hall. 

&gt; Director storms back in.

&gt; ""I ain't done with you yet!"" Behemoth huffs after him. ""My baby's been bullied and someone is going to pay!""

&gt; ""We are done, get out of my auditorium. I won't tolerate this behavior from children much less adults like yourself.""

&gt; Beretta looks confused. ""Moooooooooooom, what did you do?""

&gt; ""Shuddup, Beretta, we're leaving. You don't need to hang out with these types of people anyway. Buncha queers. You ain't trying for no more of these plays.""

&gt; Director turns around. ""I don't want your daughter in any of my plays if she is going to behave like this.""

&gt; Behemoth grunts ""You just don't want to put women like my daughter on the stage. Queer like yourself don't know a woman when you see it."" Behemoth grunts ""queer"" under her breath one more time before exiting.

&gt; Beretta waddles out after her mother.

&gt; Director hops back on stage. Deep breath, then goes right back to notes like nothing happened.

Next day in school

&gt; ""... And he called me fat, and when my mom tried to reason with him he called her fat. I don't care if he's married, he's a queer. That's why he won't let me be in any good roles, he only picks queers like himself.""

&gt; ""... No, I didn't get kicked out of the play! I dropped out to protest their behavior.""

&gt; ""... All i did was eat some chicken nuggets that were in my bag. If they were in my bag they were mine to eat. That doesn't make me a bad person, right? Totally blown out of proportion.""

TL;DR Beretta bitches her way into my car, eats food that doesn't belong to her, claims her figure isn't the ideal for horny old men, quits drama club when her mom can't convince Director I'm a bully, and calls us a bunch of queers."	t5_2vzax	True

(Doing my best with the formatting, will edit ASAP if I still manage to mess it up!)



&gt; Be me, ~~5'8~~ 5'6 (I like to think/pretend I'm taller). Be former highschool wrestler (only female on team) &amp; still somewhat buff/in shape, considering wrestling was many years prior

&gt; Be 10 years ago. I'm 22, happy &amp; carefree. Had moved to the ""big city"" from a much smaller city a couple of years prior &amp; was enjoying the single life with new and awesome friends

&gt; Meet Hamplanet. Let's call her DS. She is my (now former) roommate. 5'0, 300 lbs. Lives on a diet of french fries and karaoke. See previous posting re: [""I've been eating fries for so long, they don't make me gain weight anymore!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1gkww2/whats_the_most_insane_thing_someone_has_said_to/cal76wo)

&gt; [mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/no-def-not.gif) DS's first words upon deciding to get a place together: ""awwhhhmahgerd! WE CAN SHARE CLOTHES!""

&gt; Meet friend (SN) who is preggers. She's single, and it was an unintentional pregnancy, but she had made the decision to go through with it. Being her friends, we wanted to do what we could to try and cheer her up through a difficult time in her life

&gt; Setting: our 2 bedroom apartment in the city, large enough to accommodate a lady-party

&gt; Meet awesome BFF (CW) who offers to help me organize a baby shower for SN



Some background on DS (roommate): We are all well aware that DS has some pretty serious issues upstairs. No one ever really invites her along when we go out, but she always manages to find us. I was young &amp; naive, did not heed the warnings of friends that DS is a basketcase - hence becoming roomies.  




Couple quick side tidbits for context ...

Her obsession with motherhood:
&gt; **DS discovers SN's impending single motherhood**

&gt; First words out of DS's mouth: ""I can't wait to be a single mother, so that I can live off welfare and child support for the rest of my life""




&gt; **Upon the birth of SN's baby**

&gt; SN frequently had to call the nurses to pry her baby from DS's greasy arms

&gt; Earthquake-inducing temper-tantrum always follows




&gt; **Manipulation by tears**

&gt; At one point during our tenure as roommates, she had a boyfriend

&gt; To date, we have yet to figure out how she brainwashed said boyfriend. He was a MMA fighter with a pretty sweet 6-pack. Studly dude. He has since suggested cellulite-jiggle-hypnosis as the cause

&gt; And while it would have been disturbing to hear her sounds of sexy-time when he stayed over, it was even MORE disturbing to hear her crying non-stop instead

&gt; Found out later that this was because she wanted his baby &amp; he was flat-out refusing to provide




Her fashion sense:
&gt; **First time going to a bar with DS after becoming roomies**

&gt; Don't pay much attention to what DS decided to wear (she has some STRANGE fashion sense, but whatevs. Her choice)

&gt; Step into bar, and 5 minutes later get my ass hauled off to the side by SN and CW

&gt; [mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif) ""WHAT THE HELL?! How could you let DS leave the house dressed like that?""

&gt; Turns out, she was wearing pants SO TIGHT that they had become partially see-through &amp; you could see the cellulite from the other side of the bar

&gt; She had some MAJOR camel-toe going on, and was clearly not wearing underwear

&gt; Coupled with a COMPLETELY sheer top, lace bra, and copious amounts of blubber rolling over the top of her pants

&gt; facepalm




&gt; **Halloween**

&gt; [mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/marilyn-monroe-yuck-.gif) DS asks to borrow my Little Schoolgirl costume ""teeheehee""

&gt; Costume = size 4. DS = size windsail. 

&gt; DS insists. I finally agree for the lulz of it

&gt; Costume explodes in a cloud of dust &amp; blubber tears when she tries to squeeze into it 

&gt; DS goes as a Geisha instead - wears 3-sizes-too-small ""kimono"" &amp; tries to bare her thighs for anyone who can handle staring for more than 2 seconds

&gt; DS frequently mistakes cellulite-jiggle-hypnosis for appreciation of her ""assets"" throughout the night

&gt; She spends the majority of the night convincing anyone who will listen that half of the males in the bar have agreed to go home with her, &amp; one of them will be her baby-daddy




Misc weirdness:
&gt; **BABY**

&gt; DS had been forced by her parents to give up a baby she'd had when she was 14. Yes, a genuinely sad story, and one that I would never dream of making lulz of

&gt; However, ""pregnancy weight"" does not ""stick around"" for 10 years afterwards ""no matter how much exercise &amp; weightloss"" you try *(in DS's case, none, but she liked to try and tell everyone otherwise)*

&gt; You don't ""continue to get pregnancy morning sickness"" 10 years afterwards (*she never actually made herself throw up or anything, but she used this as an excuse for why she had to eat so much ... ""it helps my morning sickness!!"" .. any time of the day*)

&gt; In DS's universe, both of the above are true




Around the time that we started planning the baby shower, DS and I had been roommates for about 2 months, and I was already FED UP &amp; PISSED OFF with her. She didn't work, would go out to the bar EVERY NIGHT, come home at 3am &amp; Hamplanet STOMP into the house, slam doors, turn on all the lights, turn the TV on at max-volume, etc. I did, however, work, and mostly got no sleep during the week. Beta me says nothing.

End of the 2nd month, she texted me at work: ""btw, I'm going to be short on rent next month. kthnx"". My name is the only name on lease. Being late on rent is NOT AN OPTION in my world. In other words, she just expected me to cover her share until she got around to paying me back. Me being a spineless beta, it was 3 months later that I finally worked up the nerve to ask her for the money back.

&gt; All of the above taken into account, CW and I did not include DS in the baby shower planning process




So baby shower approaches &amp; DS is slowly-but-surely becoming more and more neurotic as the day gets closer. 3 days before baby shower ...

&gt; Get home from work, walk in the door, and TIDAL WAVE OF WATER and REEK smacks me upside the head

&gt; Come to my senses a few moments later, hear whale song coming from down the hallway

&gt; Discover DS in her bedroom, every piece of clothing she owns is thrown around her room (along with what suspiciously appears to be a few of my missing - and now ripped - tops. Guess the creeper in the laundry room wasn't stealing my clothes after all)

&gt; Bed on it's side

&gt; Pictures torn from walls, leaving gaping holes *cringe &amp; remember deposit for damages*

&gt; Blubberball sitting on the floor, crying so hard she has sweat her top straight into see-through status

&gt; Try to avoid looking directly at the trainwreck &amp; exclaim ""DS!! WTF?""

&gt; (accompanied by a gigantic sniffle that sucked-up half the sweat &amp; tears off the floor) 

&gt; ""awwhhhmahgerd why didn't you include me in the party plannin?!?! 

&gt; It's because I have IBS and it causes the toilet to clog, isn't it?? *Truth. Getting called at work to run home &amp; stop toilet from overflowing was happening once a week*

&gt; It's because your Halloween costume had the wrong size tag on it &amp; it got ripped, isn't it?? *HUH???*

&gt; It's because I'm still carrying some pregnancy weight, isn't it? *LOLWHUT*

&gt; Why do you discriminate? Why u so mean?""

&gt; Beta me in shock. I say meekly ""DS, it has cost us a small fortune to plan this. Food. Game prizes. etc etc. You couldn't cover rent this month. I assumed you couldn't afford it""

&gt; I couldn't even comment on the accusations. I was speechless.

&gt; The blubber-tearsweats start back up at a fever pitch, and I slowly back away and into my own room. Don't wanna deal.

&gt; Spend remainder of the week tip-toeing around the apartment &amp; eventually fall asleep each night listening to sounds akin to a baby seal being clubbed




WEEKEND!!! PAR-TAY TIME!!!! WOOHOO!!!




&gt; Guests begin arriving. SN so excited. Did not expect this. Starts crying. All girls except DS give her a hug.

&gt; DS starts crying. All girls look at her, chins on floor

&gt; DS: ""SN, I'm so happy for you! I'm so glad that I was able to plan this whole party for you! I LOVE YOU!!!""

&gt; CRASH. BANG. BOOM. We all get pulled into DS orbit as she attempts to ""run"" across the room and into SN's frightened arms

&gt; CW and I freeze in our tracks. Look at each other. Run to intercept blubberball running full-steam-ahead into baby belly. Phew, crisis averted

&gt; CW: ""wait DS .. did you just say party that YOU planned?""

&gt; DS: ""YES! And NO THANKS to YOU or Sare81! I could have used the help. Do you have ANY IDEA how expensive this was? But NO! YOU SKINNY BITCHES DISCRIMINATE BECAUSE I HAVE IBS!""

&gt; speechless

&gt; CW also being spineless beta like me, says nothing. We stare, and then walk away to continue preparing food for guests

&gt; Afternoon/evening progresses. DS behaving as expected.

&gt; Lasagne comes out of the oven. NOMNOMNOM DINNER!

&gt; Leave lasagne on counter to cool to edible temp!

&gt; Come back into kitchen 5 minutes later, discover DS with TWO FORKS, face inches away from lasagne, LITERALLY SHOVELLING THE FOOD INTO HER MOUTH STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PAN

&gt; Beta me switches into alpha mode 

&gt; Alpha me flips a lid

&gt; Alpha me shouts obscenities

&gt; Girls come running and discover DS, sauce dripping onto flabby mounds that stand-in for boobs, fork still clutched in each sausage-like fist

&gt; DS: ""I think I might be pregnant""



She wasn't pregnant. FYI.

&gt; Still reasonably fit-ish, first day doesn't kill me, or make me wish I was dead. Fuck yeah.

&gt; 2 weeks later...

&gt; Dear Mother entertaining two women at home, and neglected to tell me.

&gt; Walked in still breathing harder than usual, soaked with sweat. The heat definitely didn't help either.

&gt; Pudgette, the main speaker in this tale, wrinkles her nose like I was something the cat dropped in the litter box, even though I was well across the room from her.

No serious, you guys, my cat's shits are *atomic*. I know she's just had a shit because I can smell it right on the other side of the *house*. Anyway...

&gt;Being rather pleased with myself, I wasn't going to let someone like Pudgette grease up my parade... or some other metaphor. So I did what I usually do in these situations and completely ignore her for the moment.

&gt; ""Momma, you didn't tell me we were gonna have guests today!"" said brightly, smiling. 

&gt; ""Oh, but Lumpette (Pudgette's daughter) is leaving soon, and we wanted you two to meet."" 

&gt; Judging by the way Pudgette was looking at me, I don't think she wanted her daughter associating with someone this... I don't know, healthy? Conscious? Whatever, I turn, accepting that the long, luxurious getting-clean-under-hot-water time had to be truncated to a quick shower so I can spend time with people I didn't even know existed 'til I walked through the door.

&gt; ""I don't understand why you'd let her do something like that!""

&gt; *Say what?*

That's right, bitch didn't even wait for me to be out of sight, let alone earshot, because she started shit talking. To my mom! Not that my mom would say anything, she's the kind to smile and nod and say confrontations aren't worth it. Not, I though.

&gt; I freeze at the door. Maybe they were going back to whatever they were talking about before I burst in? 

&gt; Optimism is bad, you guys.

&gt; ""I mean, if she wants to lose weight, just put her on a diet!""

&gt; *The fuck?! How old does this bitch think I was?!*

&gt; I turn to watch, still right at the door. Mom's pretending she doesn't know I'm there. Pudgette's still talking like everybody's business was hers. Lumpette was staring at me with wide eyes and looking like she wanted the floor to split open and swallow her up. 

&gt; ""Excuse me."" Pudgette turns to look at me, feigning surprise. ""If you have something to say about me, *say it to my face*."" All the while, keeping a blank, slightly pleasant expression on my face. 

But mom knew what's going to happen, and was signalling me to shut it and just go. I looked at her to establish that I *was* aware of what she wanted, then turned back to Pudgette.

&gt; Pudgette looks surprised, like she didn't expect me to react to her comments. 

Side note: the way my parents and the people they associate with function, they ignore anything that can be construed as ""bad"" and pretend they meant something else entirely.

&gt; ""You don't need to lose weight anyway, dear."" *Dear my shapelier ass*.

&gt; Even though I know that saying this never works, I go, ""I do it to stay healthy, mostly.""

&gt; Her eyes widen, ""But that's not healthy!"" *The fuck?*

&gt; ""You're *sweating*!"" Her tone suggests that sweating is the worst thing that can happen to someone, ever. 

&gt; ""That... kind of means that it's working..."" *Among other things, I know, you guys!*

&gt; ""But that's gross and smelly and *disgusting!* Besides!"" (*here we go!*) ""Men don't want a hard woman! They want soft curves!""

&gt; Mom pales. 

&gt; I lose the last of the pleasantness in my face and voice. ""I'm not doing this for men, or some hypothetical man in my possible future. I'm doing this for *one* person. You know who that person is? *Me*. I'm doing this for me. Because I feel good when I do it. I feel good after I do it. And I feel *amazing* when I see and feel the changes coming about."" I start to turn to leave, but thought I'll get one more word in, ""And as for sweat being gross? We have an invention around here, *dear*, it's called a shower. Maybe you should try it sometime.""

I tell you guys, that shower was the best ever, as short as it was. It felt like victory. Of course, I just had to see how much damage I did to the interaction between Pudgette and my mom, so I dressed up and went back down to the living room.

&gt;turn around

&gt;she's gone

&gt;not answering her cell phone either. I go sailing on a sea of snotty children and poo-scented old people, searching for her.

&gt;after half an hour of searching, I find her. she's at a sample table. waiting. beads of grease roll down her back, pooling just above her cavernous buttcrack. her yoga pants do not provide full coverage. I try not to gag as I approach. 

&gt;looks like they're giving away samples of cheap beef taquitos

&gt;""Hammelina,"" I say. ""What are you doing?""

&gt;""JUST MAKIN' THE ROUNDS, TEE-HEE!""

&gt;I peer behind her mountainous backside. there's a cart behind her. it's full to the brim. two flats of double chocolate chip muffins, a few gallons of ice cream, three industrial-sized bags of chips, some edamame, two bags of bagels, some cream cheese, a metric fuck-ton of trail mix, a flat of full-fat yogurt, and three big containers of sushi. the toddler seat is pulled out and full of empty, greasy sample cups.

&gt;isn't it?



&gt;we get home

&gt;my husband's home, yay! he helps me carry all of Hammelina's stuff

&gt;Hammelina, of course, goes straight up and collapses onto our couch. she's too tired from all the eating she just did.

&gt;I groan at the thought of her salty ham-sweat soaking into our new couch

&gt;""CAN YOU PUT IT ALL AWAY. I'M TOO TIRED.""

&gt;ever the good hostess, I put everything away.

&gt;but wait, something's missing

&gt;her meds!

&gt;""Oh my gosh, Hammelina,"" I say. ""We forgot your medication!""

She never did pay me back.


Worst week of my life. I have moar, if FPS wants it.

My grandma is pretty much my favorite person in the world. She is about 4'10'', under 100 lbs, in her 70s, just got her knee replaced a few months ago, and just over all the coolest grandma ever.

&gt;Be me, slight college chub but working that off every day, getting back to high school weight 

&gt;Staying at grandparents house before summer internship

&gt;Grandma wants to get out of the house

&gt;She loves walking around Walmart, dat people watching

&gt;Grandma has a handicap pass on her car

&gt;Does she use it?

&gt;Nope, its for old people, grandma ain't old

&gt;Walk from back of parking lot to entrance

&gt;Grandma grabs cart to help her walk around the store easier

&gt;Enter the land of the fat neanderthals

&gt;Spend about 30 min walking around, looking at stuff, grandma looks a little tired

&gt;Offer to buy her a snack before we head home

&gt;Grandma normally eats healthy, today she wants Reese's though

&gt;Sure Grandma

&gt;Buy normal pack, walking out the door

&gt;In front of us there are 2 HUGE women on fat-mobiles (Grandma's word choice not mine), lets call them Best Fatties Forever or BFFs for short

&gt;Both around 5'3'' maybe 300 lbs

&gt;Living in Florida, gotta wear tanktops

&gt;So much back-fat

&gt;BFFs get to their car (handicapped spot of course)

&gt;Realize they have to put groceries in car themselves

&gt;nope.jpg 

&gt;See me

&gt;Shit they see me

&gt;Oh darlin will you help two old ladies with their groceries

&gt;They are in their 30's; max

&gt;Gotta get grandma out of this heat

&gt;Grandma won't hear of it, of course WE will

&gt;Try to stop grandma, try to load groceries into car so fast grandma doesn't have time to help

&gt;Grandma working like a champ

&gt;Fatties sittin on their Fat-Mobiles, just sitting

&gt;Finishing up

&gt;BFF #1 spots Reese's in grandma's purse

&gt;Shit

&gt;BFF #1 to BFF #2 ""All this time in the sun is really taking a tole on my blood pressure, I think I need some sugar fast or I might faint""

&gt;Don't fall for it Grandma, DON'T FALL FOR IT

&gt;Grandma instantly takes Reese's out of purse, hands them over

&gt;Fatties get in car, not so much as a thank you

&gt;Leave them Fat-Mobiles right by spot

&gt;Bump into them as they back out

&gt;Grandma wants to take them back to the store

&gt;Hell no Grandma we are going home

&gt;Finally get to car

&gt;Offer to buy grandma a milk shake or something on the way home

&gt;Grandma ain't hearing of it

&gt;Sweet old Grandma says she doesn't want to be a Fat Fuck like that (Again, her words)

&gt;Drive Grandma home

tl;dr Two fatties use college student to unload their groceries, then steal Grandma's Reese's. Grandma is sweet to their face but loathes them too.

Now, I'm not a fat shaming type person, I used to be obese, not planet status, but definitely asteroidal. But this talks to fatlogic and planet type stuff and I'm going to call out a planet for being a planet.

My friend: has a thyroid. One of the few who genuinely does. She has medical conditions AND obesity, not the inverse. She gets with a guy, on the other hand...

I'll call him Porkos, because he actually fucking owned a Ren Faire getup that made him look like a cross between a 3 Musketeers (giant size) and Hamry the Eighth.

Anyway, I watch this guy complain about his knees (supposedly a Special Forces training accident) but it's more likely that he's a giant man-hamchild who barely works. He had a great gig with this local grocery and was literally paid in soda. He was allowed the equivalent of min wage's worth of store credit, and took it on the hour, every hour, in soda. Which he consumed in Mass Quantities. Like Beldar Scone-head.

I declined their cooking, with thanks, because they tended to eat take out pizza with spaghetti. And seeing as how commercial spaghetti sauce isn't carby enough, they'd add a cup of sugar. I ended up un-mangling part of their eating habits, but Porkos wanted none of it. 

Suggestions of drinking DIET soda, at least, or preferably water was met with a petulant ""don't like water."" ""Don't like diet soda."" This guy was WAYYYY too old to be literally acting like a five year old told that donuts was not an acceptable breakfast.

&gt; Anyway one day I'm heading to work, when Porkos started looking a bit ashen. Grabbing the middle of his chest. ""Hey, Saint... what does it mean when it hurts in your chest and down your arm?""

&gt; ""Right arm or left?""

&gt; ""Left arm""

&gt; ""Stabbing pain?""

&gt; ""No. Like heavy, pushing squeezing.""

&gt; heartattack.com

&gt; So I drop everything. I don't even call into work. I get across the road, get a neighbour with a car, nobody's dressed (it's early) but ZOMG everyone drops everything and hustle and we bundle him to the ER. Stat. I'm calling my friend and saying Porkos is in the ER. She freaks and rushes over.

&gt; This stabilized, I start heading in to work. I call enroute- roommate possibly having heart attack, sorry I'm late, etc. Needless to say work wasn't enthused and they took an attitude about it.

&gt; But I'm worried. It's affecting my day. I've got my own grievances about the guy and frankly it'd be kandy karma if he flatlined on us - but he's a human being, right?

&gt; I call friend, who's FIT to SPIT.

&gt; They rushed Porkos, apparently, to the ER. They got him in right away. Well done Saint, yes, this is classic Heart Attack. So they get the beepy machines going and are set up to do tests.

&gt; But the problem happens when he claims to be thirsty. And they bring him water.

&gt; He requests a soda.

&gt; He's told soda isn't a good idea, they're running blood tests and stress tests and he's very probably having a minor heart attack, and they need to figure out what the hell is going on.

&gt; iwantasoda.whine

&gt; Asks another nurse to go grab him a Coke. 

&gt; lolnope.wat

&gt; wantone.jpg

&gt; So he calls in my friend, who's a wreck, and says honey, they're treating me abysmally here, can you go just damn get me a Coke. She's all, Porky dear, they said it would interfere with the tests, it's just for a couple of hours, just have some water.

&gt; coupleofhours.scrm

&gt; whatdoyoumeanhours.exe

&gt; He proceeds to rip the sensors, wires, etc. off himself.

&gt; That's it. He's going HOME.

&gt; If he can't have his sodas on demand, he's LEAVING.

&gt; dudeyourehavingafuckingheartattack.txt

&gt; Don't care. Want soda.

&gt; Nurse proceeds to expain meaning of ""Heart Attack"", ""AMA - Against Medical Advice"", and ""your insurance **won't pay for this if you leave now**. **YOU will be on the hook to pay for this EXTREMELY PRICEY ER VISIT.**""

&gt; getmeasodaandillstay.txt

&gt; TL:DR he shuffles out, grimacing and grabbing his chest, to the nearest corner store and buys a 12 pack of soda, which he half consumes on the spot.

&gt; Friend takes off to work, too angry to even speak

&gt; Honey take me home, I'm sick. The hospital didn't do anything for me

We don't drive except once a month using zipcar, choosing to utilize public transportation and our legs. We've gone from almost completely sedentary to walking 30-40 miles each week. 

Now that summer vacation has begun, I'm even more active. My 2 daughters (6yrs and 19mos) and I take day trips while their dad works often starting by walking him to the office then continuing on to the train station. I put the younger child in the [stroller](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81qUkfUYj%2BL._SY355_.jpg) and the older one keeps up with me. 

&gt; Be first day of summer vacation. 

&gt; Be awesome mom and decide to take kids out for the day. 

&gt; Drop off husband at office and forward ho! we go to the train station. 2.5 miles

&gt; Surprise! We're going to the mall. Two stations on train and the walking begins again.

&gt; End up with some books and clothes for the kids. Stop to eat packed lunch of sandwiches and fruit. Stop in another store to buy sweatbands.

&gt; Yumi Yogurt across the way.... kids be 'mirin. Decide to share a small yogurt between the three of us. 

&gt; Before we leave, it's time for a bathroom break. 

&gt; Bathroom pretty standard. 3 small stalls, 1 large handicapped stall, Baby changing table behind the door. 

&gt; Change the baby while simultaneously convincing the elder child not to lock stall doors and crawl out from underneath. 

&gt;Settle baby back into stroller and bring it with me into largest stall. 

Let me stop here a minute. My baby, while adorable, has the loudest shriek this side of the Mississippi. Nothing brings it out faster than a bathroom stall door separating us. With the elder child in a smaller stall, I did the reasonable thing and brought her in with me. Had I not had the kids, I would have used a smaller stall.

&gt; As soon as I get settled, I hear a shuffling/wheezing/groaning combination. It gets louder.

&gt; Suddenly there is a presence in front of the door. I can see a pair of sandals but nothing alarming. I hear a rustling and then...   BAM BAM BAM!

&gt;Something is violently throwing furniture at the door! No, it's just someone's fist rudely banging on an obviously locked stall. 

&gt; GET THE HAY-ELL OUT OF THUR! WHO IS THAT? I NEED TO GO-OOOO!

&gt; ""I'm not finished yet."" I had no other words. I was shocked into this answer... the only logical answer I could grasp.

&gt; AH SAY-ED AH NEED TO GO! THIS HURRS MAH STALL... AH HAVE TO USE THIS 'UN!

&gt; Brain enters loop: ""I'm not finished yet.""

&gt; Anonymous bitch keeps banging on door and screaming at me for daring to use her stall. 

&gt; Finish up, get the stroller ready to move, and open the door. I was not prepared. I was unprepared.

 5'6 easily over 400 lbs. Her fat rolls were all over... not neat like most fatties but literal blobs of fat just hanging off her from any angle. Sagging because gravity. Her face was red and angry. Stringy black hair half in/out of an elastic. It honestly looked like she tried to put it in a pony tail or bun but got tired somewhere in the middle and gave up. 

&gt; Try to push stroller, hoping she'll move to the side and let me pass. MFW I realize she can't. She'll need to back all the way out to the sinks in order for me to have enough room.

&gt; Fatty sees my baby and my shrinking figure and flips. the. fuck. out. Former octave range must be her ""normal"" voice. I was now getting the sonic boom. 

&gt; ""YOU CAN'T BRING HER IN HERE""

&gt; Try to explain baby isolation screaming theory to no avail. 

&gt; ""THAT AIN'T NO G-DAMN BABY STALL. THAT'S FOR US HANDICAPPED PEOPLES. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIF YOU? THINKING YOU HAS THE RIGHT TO ANYTHING YOU WANTS JUST CUZ YOU SQUEEZED OUT A BABY."" 

&gt; eyebrow.gif

&gt; Faintly hear a ""Mommy?"" from my normally loud 6 year old. Realize this hammy has cut Momma Bear's ability to see and protect both her cubs.

&gt; ""Please move. I need to get out."" 

&gt; Tirade continues at deafening levels. She begins bearing down on me... or actually, the baby.

&gt; The stroller is beginning to dig back into my body as the planet approaches. Her ""curves"" are getting dangerously close to the little one's face. 

&gt; Panic. Don't panic. Panic? No... no panic. One last chance to man up. No one terrorizes your babies.

&gt; I take a deep breath and look the beast square in the eye. 

&gt; ""I can't get out. If you want this stall, MOVE!""

&gt; She opens her piehole to scream more filth, but I cut her off short. ""At this point, you are obstructing my exit as well as keeping me from my child. If you don't move immediately, I will beginning screaming ""RAPE"" and ""FIRE"" until someone responds. 

&gt; Fatty backs away grumbling about anorexic bitches who think they own the world.

&gt;I nod curtly and sweep past with my head held high.

&gt; Resume day fatty-free like a boss.

EDIT: TL;DR - Fatty accosts me in a public bathroom, tried to smother my baby, and only leaves under threat of outside involvement.

&gt;""It's me [real name] from high school!""

&gt;What?  [real name] was a cheerleader and weighed 110 lbs at 18.

&gt;Haven't seen her in 6 years though...

&gt;Fuck, I have no face.

&gt;""You haven't changed, booknerd.""

&gt;Why are you so fucking fat?!  ""You look...different.""

&gt;""I've become curvy over the years, teehee!""

&gt;Not the damn teehee.  Where's my damn coffee so I can leave?

The coffee shop was super crowded, so LW had plenty of time to launch into her life history.  Dropped out of college at 20 to marry a navy sailor.  She couldn't handle his long deployments and found comfort in food.  Gained about 200 lbs in 2 years after marriage.  Fast forward another 2 years, LW was going through a divorce.

&gt;""[Husband's name] didn't like my curvy body.  He just couldn't handle a real woman.""

&gt;Riiiiiight.  

&gt;""Small mocha with whip cream.""

&gt;Thank you god!  My coffee was finally ready.

&gt;LW looks at me in disgust.

&gt;""Did you get whip cream on that?""

&gt;Ignoring her as I happily sip my caffeine in a cup.

&gt;""booknerd.  Whip cream is bad for you.  It will give you fat, not curves.""

&gt;What the...that makes no sense.  My brain is thoroughly confused.

&gt;""Skinny girls like you can get fat super easily from whip cream.  Curvy girls like me can eat it all we want because we can't get fat.""

&gt;...

&gt;...

&gt;Brain is sizzling.

&gt;Fat girls who call themselves curvy can't get fat because they are already curvy???

&gt;Whatever.  

&gt;Say goodbye and make a hasty exit.

&gt;I need to preserve whatever functioning brain cells I have left."	t5_2vzax	True
1375866831.0	1jvfzs	CancerSis Vs TrainPlanet	BahamutWings	579	117	59	"Hey FPS, long time no see, had some devastating news recently:

My 16 year old sister has cancer.

Luckily it is a slow growing cancer, and only soft tissue in her leg is affected, operation scheduled for Friday.

On to the tale:

My Mother and Sister get on the train home after the diagnosis, eyes still red from tears .(The hospital and our home are only 2 minutes walks from Train stations).
It's a commuter train out of London in rush hour so its very busy, but a kind young couple see that they are visibly shaken and offer up some seats so they can sit down.
My mum is in the middle of convincing my younger sister that life will go on, she will get better, and she will get through it (i believe a new cat is promised).

Then it gets on.

The TrainPlanet.

My mother and sister both reliably inform me that it stands at about 5""3 tall and is considerably bigger than my mother (5""7 280lbs - no fatlogic, just loves food and encourages all children to be healthy).

It wheezes upto the nearest seats by the door, the ones my Family are in.

TP - ""Scooze me!"" - Every sentence uttered seemed to have the urgency requiring a !

My mother turns (aisle seat). Sister giving the dead man stare out the window, wrapped in her thought cocoon.

TP - ""Can ah sit down?! Mah knees hurt!""

My mother is still red-eyed, and in shock. Here is a lady only a little larger than herself, demanding a seat for herself.

Mum - ""Well, no, you can stand, my daughter . . .""

TP - ""You both look healthy! My knee is under strain and my Dr says i should sit down!""

Now. My mother is a lovely lady, but she's one protective brood mamma. She's got 5 kids. She can handle whiny bitches.

But whats this? CancerSis is aware of the confrontation?

CancerSis stands, towering over the planet, even from the window seat. (5""9 - freakishly tall viking genetics involved).

""BITCH I HAVE FUCKING CANCER, GET ANOTHER SEAT!"".

TrainPlanets jaw drops. It starts flapping up and down with no sound coming out (maybe she was expecting an emergency burger?).

The carriage is silent.

TP utters under her breath - ""No need to make a scene . . . ""

CancerSis - ""Mum, lets get off at the next stop and go to Chippers office to get coffee."" (Chipper is my older younger sister with Anorexia).

Mum - ""Sure Hun.""

They got up to get off and TrainPlanet immediately flopped across both seats, recieving filthy stares from all in the carriage.

And believe me, a Londoners filthy stare can be horrific.

Much StarBeetus was consumed in the plaec next to Chippers office, and they retired for a girly night involving much cheering up :)

EDIT: Wow guys, I am overwhelmed to see the outpouring of support, it means a lot to me and my sister (yeah, she's seen this, no she has no account). If the mods will allow I will post an update on Friday after surgery to let you know how its gone etc."	t5_2vzax	True
1373121018.0	1hqzbk	Lettuce-Stealing Land Whale Destroys my Garden	contentkaiser	550	84	90	"I live across from a school, not because I'm a sex offender but because I got a great deal on a pretty decent house.  This is my first year here, and so I planted many gardens in a burst of nouveau farmer enthusiasm.  My front yard is fenced in and I use various natural deer and rabbit repellents, so I amateurishly thought that my harvest would be secure.

Fast forward to June of 2013, I'm checking my square foot gardens every day in anticipation of having some fresh veggies to chow down on.  I live alone, and I put a pretty considerable amount of effort into all my gardens, so imagine my horror when I look out my window to see a massive woman elbow deep in my precious lettuce beds.

This woman, WITH her child in tow, had paused on her way back to her car from school to steal vegetables out of my garden.  She was ripping lettuce leaves, radishes, and carrots out of my garden, depositing them in a bag that she had clearly brought for that occasion.  I don't have a car in my driveway, so I guess she thought she wasn't being watched, but I'm definitely not one to shy from confrontation.

I sprint out of my house to engage the death star, firing my initial salvo directly at her big fat ego.  ""Excuse me ma'am, but it sure looks like you are LITERALLY stealing food from me.  You sure aren't setting a good example for your kid!""

The pendulous mammaries with eyes turned around and grunted up at me, still fisting my garden with her swollen grubs, ""OH well I was going to leave you enough for you to have"" as if her kind and thoughtful harvest limitation interested me in the least.

""You need to leave now, and you better leave all of the lettuce you stole.  I'm five seconds away from calling the police and charging you with trespassing and theft, and so help me God if I see you sneaking around my house again I'm just going to shoot you."" [side note: thanks NC for super liberal / hazy laws relating to blasting away at 'intruders']

The land whale huffed and she puffed, but eventually she dumped out her bag of lettuce.  She stormed away, food stealing thwarted temporarily.  

Unfortunately, I'm an Army Reservist, and I'm gone for huge chunks of time from my home.  I came home a week ago to find my garden in ruins.  Every single plant was either uprooted or just torn down, with all the vegetables gone and even the containers overturned.  I'm not 100% sure that it was the land whale, but things sure add up.  

This story will have a happy ending though: I have a great picture of her stealing lettuce, her rapturous and illegal joy plain as day on her smug face, and I've just emailed it to the list-serv of the parents' organization for the elementary school her kid goes to.  Just a little way of saying ""thanks"" to that Moby Prick of a mother.  "	t5_2vzax	True
1372088181.0	1gz1vo	Scootersaurus rides out	EnglishCuckoo	553	89	54	"My first FPS, from the streets of the UK. For context I'll say I was born with a body which, if it were a car, would be called a 'lemon'. I live with limited mobility and a lot of pain, amongst other things, but prefer to live my life in defiance of it, rather than defined by it.

So here's me and my noble twin sticks propping up my far from noble limbs, making slow progress down the pedestrian shopping area of my town on a busy Saturday. Ok, I could have used the electric wheelchair, but today I didn't have to, and I have a fondness for being vertical when I can - changes the view. So I'm going to the hardware shop to buy fuses, slowly. The bustle round me negotiates me and my appendages well. And then the crowd in front parts, actually scatters would be more accurate, and coming towards me is Scootersaurus.

Most occupants of mobility scooters in the UK are elderly women, with vastly swollen legs, no necks and plastic rain hoods. They drive poorly but apologetically, on the whole, so at least you know they'd be very sorry if they ran you over. But Scootersaurus is altogether something else. In his late teens, with a spherical head which boasts many chins which run all the way round its circumference, a greased-down helmet of black hair. And a great big pout.

This much I've taken in by the time the front of his scooter bumps against my leg. You see, I foolishly assumed he would take account of my with-sticks status and drive round me, so I waited for him to change course. Instead, he came straight toward me and slowed to a halt.

""You ought to get out the way,"" he whines through blocked sinuses.

""You could go round me,"" I reply, trying to decide if I'm being mean to someone not quite the full ticket or if I'm arguing with a Precious Self-Entitled Poppet. I have by now taken in the full glory of his hulking bulk and am quite surprised the scooter moves at all. Great hanging slabs of flab flow over the sides of the seat. His gut reaches his knees. Even his ankles have double chins. And his arms, oh no, his arms, like something rancid from a butcher's shop, all that dimpled and pimpled flesh dangling down, swaying, swaying...

So which of us is more stubborn or immobile?

""I have disabilities,"" he informs me grandly, as if this were the trump card in the game. I raise my eyebrows at him and stare, say nothing. ""I have breeving troubles,"" he says, the voice rising half an octave. ""I have a right to ride me scooter here."" Still staring, still saying nothing. ""You ought to move!"" And there's the beginning of frustrated self-righteous reproach, with just a hint of self-pity.

I lift my right stick slowly up to horizontal. Not one atom of it touched him or his scooter, but he suddenly realised he could steer round me really rather easily, and drove off at the poor machine's top speed, while I watched in terror in case he flattened some poor kid. (He managed to avoid hitting anything.)

That was several months ago. I haven't seen him in town before or since that encounter."	t5_2vzax	True
1367988593.0	1dwxdy	Fatty being extremely rude to girl with eating disorder	naadsat	582	119	122	"Hello FPS, I've been a long time lurker here and finally decided to dive in with my first post. I have several hammy stories, if this one is a hit I may post the others. Sorry for no greentext, I'm new at this :L  Also apologies if this turns out kinda long, promise to do a TL;DR.
SO, first some background:

This story is about me, when I was a sophomore in college. I had been diagnosed with bulimia nervosa when I was 15, been struggling with it ever since, but that year I was finally getting serious about recovery. Also, during my senior year of high school, my best friend bitched me out in front of a size-able crowd for vomiting in the bathroom after lunch (bless her), but unfortunately when shit like that happens in high school EVERYONE knows and whatnot. Anyways, on to the story:

Halfway through second year of college, studying for finals. 
Go to cafeteria for nourishment for mah brain to learn.
Grab a plate of food, find an empty table to eat and look over notes.
Large shadow drifts over me, cue sense of impending dread.
HAI I SAW YOU ACROSS THE CAFETERIA AND RECOGNIZED YOU FROM ______HIGH SCHOOL, MIND IF I SIT DOWN

At this point she'd already plopped down in to chair opposite me with several plates of food.
I just try smiling and confirm that I went to ____High School. 
She leaves for a moment (to get more food? Whaa?), and I realize I remember her too, she's just gained a lot of weight.
She was overweight in high school but had to have gained at least 50 pounds since I'd seen her last.
We weren't friends, but she never gave me a reason to dislike her.
Now she was real hambeast status, at least 250 lbs, complete with stringy, greasy hair and foul breath I could smell across the table.
She returns with two bowls of cereal (really?) along with her other plates of food containing several burgers, fries, and pizza, all dripping with various condiments. 
She immediately starts gabbing about her boyfriend,
""HE'S SO HAWT, HE LOVES ME SO MUCH SEXSEXSEX HE THINKS MY FIGURE IS GAWWJUSS AHH""
BUT it isn't til she starts shoving food into her mouth that I start to get uncomfortable. 
It's just plain disgusting to watch someone put away that much food at once, showing no regard to the mayo dripping off her face and smacking loudly with her mouth open.
She realizes I'm just picking at my food, not eating it, because I have lost desire to eat at this point.
As she coats a slice of pizza in ranch she says loudly 
""GUUURL EVERYONE KNOWS YER ONE OF THEM BOOL-EE-MICS, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY ATE A TON AND USED THEIR FINGERS TO PUKE IT UP LATER, WHY YOU PICKIN AT YER FOOD HARHAR""
**ohnoshedidnt.tsk**
The surrounding tables go silent, I feel my face burning, and lose whatever was left of my appetite. 
I quietly explain to her that I am working on recovering, eating too much makes it very hard to avoid another episode, and I do best when I eat small portions at a time.
""GUUUURL YOU SHOULD QUIT WIT DAT, MEN LIKE REAL WOMEN LIKE ME, I EAT WHATEVER I WANT AND MY BOYFRIEND LOVES THE WAY I LOOK. LOOKS LIKE YER JUST AN ANOREXIC NOW HARHARHARR"" she laughs (gurgles?) around bites of cereal.
At this point people are staring, and I have lost my patience. 
I just say bluntly, ""I'M A LESBIAN."" and pick up my tray to leave.
She looks at me shocked/freaked out (what, is she homophobic too?)
and doesn't say another word.

TL;DR  I meet former classmate who's reached hamplanet status, she callously brings up my eating disorder while eating enough to feed a small village and makes other general rude remarks, including my inability to be attractive to the opposite sex. I end up grossing her out with the news that I am gay and have no desire to be curvy for the men-folk. Extremely tactless fatty also appears to be homophobic. Imagine that. 

Thanks for reading y'all, sorry for the text dump.
 
EDIT: words is hard. And a big thank you to everyone who had kind words to offer, recovery is a bitch  enough without bitches bitchin at ya. Stay tuned for other hammalicious tales."	t5_2vzax	True
1367450211.0	1dij6m	The deviled egg massacre	None4GretchenWieners	587	121	228	"Hello again FPS! Since you seemed to like my [first story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1di0h8/my_first_experience_with_hamlogic/), I figured I'll post another one today since I won't have time to post tomorrow.

This story actually isn't from my years in retail, it's from a birthday party I was at just a month after the last story took place. It is my only experience with fat logic outside the retail world. I'm not going to greentext this one either. In fact, I'm not going to grrentext any of my stories, so save the jimmy rustlin for the fat logic.

A bit of back story before we start: in high school, I had a fat as hell friend, who we'll call R, who is a really nice person. At her fattest, she weighed in at 300 lbs. This actually wasn't her fault, her parents are fatlogic royalty and would yell and scream at her when she made any attempt whatsoever to lose weight. Since moving out of her parents' house, she lost 180 lbs and looks amazing. This story is not about R, but it does involve her, so I thought I'd clear things up about her a bit.

Be me, still 16, 5'8”, 160 lbs, curvy in-shape runner. I get invited to my friend L's birthday party. It is her “Sweet 16,” but her parents can't afford to throw a huge party so 30+ of us friends all agree to bring the food as long as her parents provide plates, cups, utensils, and decorations. I make deviled eggs because who the hell doesn't like deviled eggs? For these eggs, I used regular mayo and real bacon that I cooked and crumbled myself because this is a special occasion. It took 3 hours the night before the party because I made 5 dozen deviled eggs (120 egg halves total).

I get to L's place with the eggs on two huge party platters. At this point absolutely zero eggs had been consumed. With the help of my friend J (R's boyfriend), we got them safely into the house and on the kitchen table on top of a couple huge bowls of ice to keep them cool. Cue L's fatasfatfuck cousin C (5'5”, 350+ lbs). No one besides L knows her and no one knew she was invited, but we don't say anything because this is L's party and C is her relative.

L asks if anyone is hungry, and we all say no, so we all go out to the living room to watch a movie. Of course, all 30-something of us are paying attention to the movie, not the fatty. When the movie ends we all head into the kitchen for some snacks and lo and behold, we see one egg plate *completely* empty and C is stuffing the last of the deviled eggs from the other plate into the gaping black hole in her face.

MFW this bitch ate SIXTY eggs complete with a jar and a half of mayo and two pounds of bacon (well, more like half a pound since I had cooked all the fat off, but still, that's a fucking lot).

C: “Oh hey guys, is the movie over already? I got hungry so I decided to have a snack! Teehee!”

At this point I can't control myself. I shout at her, “You ate SIXTY fucking eggs! That's 120 egg halves! Plus I put enough mayo and bacon in those to kill a whole stable of horses.”

C: “Well it's not my fault they're so small teehee you should have made more! Then there would have been enough for everyone!”

My blood is boiling over at this point but it is R who speaks up.

R: “YOU ATE *SIXTY* FUCKING EGGS YOU FAT FUCK! HAVE YOU NO FUCKING SHAME?! THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUR PIECES EACH! WHY IS IT THAT FAT PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO EAT EVERYTHING IN FUCKING SIGHT?”

OFW C just got fat-shamed by another fat person. C starts whaling, saying she has the beetus or some shit. By this time L's parents have come downstairs to see what all the commotion was about. L tells C to leave, she is ruining the party and has to go.

C: “You don't own this place! You can't kick me out! Only your parents can, and they won't!”

L's mom: “C, you need to leave. I'm calling your mom to come get you.”

C whales the whole time she's waiting for her mom about fat-shaming, discrimination, and her beetus. Her mom gets there and everyone is as shocked as I am to see that she's rather thin, but we're even more surprised that she had the physical strength to grab C and force her out to the car. The rest of the party everyone is a little bummed that they were robbed of my delicious eggs. I was bummed too, 3 hours of making the perfect eggs for L's party ruined by some fat fuck that couldn't control herself. What I really want to know though is how the hell did she not die or at least have a heart attack from eating all those eggs? The world may never know."	t5_2vzax	True
1372731805.0	1hgxld	Cool Whip is healthy!	Ishityounotman	595	132	188	"So today was my first day at my new job. I am working at a day-care center with two year olds (they're adorable). 

Be me, 5'11 125 pounds girl who is excited to be working with munchkins. I got there a little early to help set up and meet the teacher and the teacher assistant ( I'm a 'child-care assistant. That means they pay me minimum wage to play with the kids ) 


I walk into the class room and meet the super-chill teacher. She's normal weight and just about the friendliest person ever. Winnie the Pooh ain't got nothin on her. We were chatting when suddenly the door flew open and the walls trembled. I stumbled, feeling the vibrations rack through my body. I looked over at the door, expecting to see a wild hippo. I gasped, it WAS a hippo! But why was a hippo wearing a flowery tablecloth?


It wasn't a hippo.


It was a female, an actual human. She was about 5'5 and in the ballpark of 300 pounds. She was perfectly spherical. It was almost intriguing.


She lumbered over to me and made noises that resembled the English language. 


'Good Morning. I just woke up and haven't had a chance to have me some breakfast yet, so if you don't mind I'll eat real quick.'


Still in shock, I nodded.


FAT ( Fat Assistant Teacher) sucking on a Starbeetus concoction of Carmely-glucose, pulls out 4 breakfast burritos from McDonalds. 


I'm in shock, as I'm much taller than this woman and run around 30 miles a week and can only finish ONE of those suckers. But whatever. Maybe she's a nice person!


How very wrong I was.


She spent the entire morning on her iPhone, took a freaking nap at her desk, and yelled at a kid for asking her to help him go to the bathroom. 

Then, at lunchtime, all the kids went to get their lunch boxes.


Ladies and Gentlemen, hold on to your jimmies because I'm afraid they'll be rustling quite violently after this.


One little girl asks FAT to please put her cheese and crackers together while she washes her hands.
Grumbling, FAT agrees and opens the little girl's lunch and pulls everything out. Inside, there's cheese, crackers, fruit gummies, grapes, and two chocolate chip cookies. 

I'm observing her from across the table when her hand suddenly shoots out, grabs the cookies, and stuffs them in her pocket.


All of my wut.


I said 'Hey, those are *insert small human's name here*.
Fat: Nuh-uh. They fell out of my pocket.


Me: ' Your pocket is under the table.'


FAT: 'Shut your mouth if you know what's good for you missy. I'll march right over to the office and tell them how you're mouthing off to me.'
It's my first day, so I figured they'd take her word over mine. So I went beta and shut up.


The little girl came back. 'Where's my cookies?'


FAT: ' You didn't have any cookies. Ishityounotman is going to sit here and help you with your lunch while I eat.'


I watch her eat the cookies at her desk, my jimmies rustling uncontrollably. Suddenly, she reaches into the mini-fridge and pulls out two tubs of Cool Whip.


Wut.


She pulls out a spoon and proceeds to attack the whip with vigor. She notices me watching and defensively proclaims 'Cool Whip is a good, healthy food. Don't look at me like that. At least I'm not eating chips like you.'


I was eating Sun-Chips. And I'm not exactly overweight.


Me 'Is that your lunch?'


FAT 'Who put a crown on your damn bony head and gave you the power to judge me?' 


Me 'I've just never seen that before, that's all.' 


FAT glares at me and returns to scooping the whip.


A little boy tugs my shirt and asks 'What does Damn mean?' 


I told him not to worry about it. I went up to FAT and said
'Look. I don't care if you have a problem with me, but you can't go cursing in front of toddlers. The camp could get in a lot of trouble.'
Her face turned red, and she had a mouth full of Cool Whip, some of which was leaking out.


I walked away and continued to observe her from the other table.
She ate a foot-long sub, a family sized bag of chips, two Subway cookies, something out of a black bottle, two cookies that were stolen, a sleeve of graham crackers, and two tubs of Cool Whip.
I hope she doesn't report me with some lie that gets me fired."	t5_2vzax	True
1366720521.0	1cxjo2	It's 5am here and I'm probably going to fight EventualPlanet.	SometimesIArt	583	120	166	"Excuse me if I screw this up for you guys, I am on 0 sleep for this night/morning because of reasons I will explain in a second. Sorry in advance. 

Learn some things about Eventual Planet [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1c8dqy/my_roommate_the_eventual_planet/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1cbd4h/my_roommate_the_eventual_planet_no_one_else_gets/) if you haven't already. 

And if you're too lazy to do that/for whatever infallible reason you're on a FPS diet (you WILL lose your curves if you are...), allow me to quickly background for you. 

I live in a house with three people I went to uni with, one of which is a fountain for fat logic and social inadequacy. Can sometimes be a bro, but mostly is inappropriate and kinda... slow. Is steadily gaining planet status, though right now she's more of a huddling mass waiting to explode to full potential. 

5'9"", ~195lbs (175cm, ~88kg). 

Annnnnd onto the story. I greentexted the last ones, going to normal this one. 

Switch that shit up, yo. 

My goodness I am so white. 

So for the past two days I have been *sick*. Like, can't get out of bed, wishing for God to strike me dead sick. I am stubborn and try to tough through these things without hitting the hospital because I spend too much time there already due to physical problems, but I am caving and taking off here as soon as the Medicentre opens because I am not sleeping anymore. 

So I've been curled up on my couch, shaking, coughing, drifting in and out of consciousness, leaking all sorts from my face being generally gross. 

Sorry boys, I'm taken. 

Eventual Planet has a really awesome mom who brought me soup because I am ""an orphan"" as she put it (my dad lives ~3 hours away from where I do and we all know I don't talk to my mom). Eventual planet is angry because her mom bought me a cup of soup from Tim Horton's and I ate it without giving her (the planet) any. 

""You just could have shared,"" she says. 

Yeah okay, go ahead, contract my plague EP. Then I will get to hear you bitch about it for a week. 

I am bitchy when I'm sick. 

Anyways. Obviously if I don't have enough energy to even move from the couch and walk across the room without feeling dizzy, I can't go running. I currently do about 11k/day (6.8 miles for the people not with the cool  Metric kids) 5x/week with one short run or cross training (6x/week cardio w/martial arts on ""off"" day), so being out of breath for walking 10 feet and inactive for a few days straight is really starting to piss me off. I'm frustrated and bitchy and this is CLEARLY the best time for a fatlogic lecture. 

Wouldn't you agree?

Alright kids, buckle in your jimmies. 

So there's pathetic/gross me, piled under 50 blankets and being gross because sweating/chills, catching up on Game of Thrones and Doctor Who because I've been a bad, bad fan and neglected the television due to three jobs. 

Eventual Planet decides to take a break from whatever she was doing and joins me to watch. 

Doesn't watch either show but is pretty obsessed with Matt Smith. I don't get it, the man has no eyebrows... 

Good luck unseeing that. 

Anyways. 

She's interrupting my viewing pleasure with questions about the series until finally I give up and pause the damn thing because clearly she wants to talk. 

I let her complain about being single for a bit and then inevitably it switches to bitching about her ex, which I hear every day. Yay. 

I am being a good friend and listening to her grievances, despite struggling to remain conscious. 

Somehow, and I can't recall clearly how (sorry, I'm all hazy), the topic switches to health. I think she was talking about the HAES (Healthy at Any Size) that Small Moon introduced her to at our LAN party a few days ago. I wrote a story on that. It's somewhere. 

At any rate, bitchy sick me came right out and called it bullshit and listed off the main reasons, mostly having to do with excess fat causing health problems/women carrying fat around their stomach are more susceptible to certain medical problems/strain of extra weight on joints and ligaments. Not what the Eventual Planet wanted to hear. 

She gets mad and defensive and says that I'm wrong. No reason, I'm just wrong. 

Okay, whatever. 

And anyways, what would I know about health? Look at what I've done to myself! 

I'm a little confused at this point and just letting her ramble because talking hurts, but turns out she actually somehow rationalized that I am so sick because ""I starve myself"" and ""work my body too hard,"" and that ""now it's shutting down because I've tortured it too much,"" and ""I'm not getting proper nutrition."" She is ""very very worried about me"" and ""thinks I should seek help."" 

I, kindly as I can (which is not very, unfortunately), inform the Eventual Planet that my sickness has NOTHING to do with my fitness or nutrition, and that if she knew even the first thing about anything medical she would know my symptoms do not coincide with malnutrition or physical over-exertion. 

Incoming! 

It's fat logic, Sir! 

We're doomed. 

&gt;You are not *meant* to be skinny. 

&gt;Everyone's body is different, and your genetics determine what size you are supposed to be. It's society telling you to wreck your body. 

&gt;And look where it's gotten you. 

&gt;Now that you've taken time off exercise, your muscle is going to turn into fat anyways. 

Yeah, after two days of not working out. Yep. 

&gt;And you're not eating so your body is in starvation mode and eating itself because you've burned all of its reserves away. 

&gt;So basically all of the work you've done is being undone. 

&gt;Do you really want to live like that? Work so hard then you can't even take a break for a day because it sets you back so far?

Shut up, EP. Seriously. 

&gt;I hate seeing you like this. 

At this point I might have lost it. I don't remember much other than seeing red. I do remember I told her ""it's a fucking cold, for fuck's sakes!""

It's probably more than a cold, Google told me I have cancer. 

Anyways, whatever I said pissed her off enough to get her to leave so I could continue with my scifi fix of a ridiculous man running around space in a ridiculous outfit. 

Fast forward to about 20 minutes ago. No longer FPS just pissed me off (I always seem to add a little non-FPS at the end of all of these... I have a problem). 

I am clearly up. My bedroom door stays open 90% of the time because I own a cat and he likes to wander in and out of my room. I am on my computer because I can't sleep and there's nothing better to do that involves not moving just in case I pass out. 

Eventual Planet is still writing finals because of some secondary uni whatever thing I don't understand it, I tuned it out after the 3rd time. 

She gets up obscenely early for who knows what reason and lazes around the house for a few hours before leaving every day. I honestly think she thinks it gives her some sort of superiority over the rest of us because both Tiny Roommate and I sleep until 10ish every day (well, whenever I don't need to be at the farm for 4 in the fuck I hate my life) and British Roommate we're lucky if we see before noon, and she always talks about how she's ""the first one up"" as if she deserves some medal for it. 

Usually doesn't notice when I'm gone at 4am. I come home and every time she acts surprised and says she thought I was still sleeping. Whaaaaaatever. 

Today she pokes her head into my room. 

""Wow, you're actually up at an *adult* time. Congratulations on joining the *real* world."" 

Frothing at the mouth. 

All of my rage. 

brb going to go punch a face in then go to the hospital. Lazy/crazy/judgemental/insane twat-wad is going to get it. 

**TL;DR:** Roommate on way to becoming ham planet blames me being sick on eating healthy and exercising. Or as she calls it ""starving and torturing myself."" Also fatlogic's version of genetics."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; Be me, Saggy-Sucks with awesome alpha roommate, Dramagirl

&gt; We're both pretty fed up with Saggy's shit, so we've been having lots of fun brainstorming about how to get her to move out. 

&gt; Can't get her kicked out for weed because Dramagirl smokes as well.

&gt; Being a gigantic^tee-hee slut isn't a violation of the renter's agreement.

&gt; Can't prove she slept with a 16 year old.

&gt; We're super stumped. :( 

&gt; **HOWEVER** 

&gt; One day, we arrive back at the apartment and we have a new addition.

&gt; Saggy has a cute black baby sitting on her ~~tree trunk~~ knee, and she's looking pleased as fuck.

&gt; ""Hey Saggy......uhhhhh.....Where'd you get the baby?"" I say.

&gt; Saggy says her girlfriend is really busy today and Saggy agreed to watch her baby.

&gt; Baby is probably a year and a half, and is cute as all fuck, with big eyes and a chubby cheek face.

&gt; Dramagirl and I coo and make baby talk to him, petting his little curls and letting him grab our hands and stuff.

&gt; BABIES!!!! D'AWWWWWWWW!

&gt; We start to realize pretty quickly though that there's something weird about this baby. It just kinda....stares. And only stares.

&gt; He never giggled.

&gt; He never made any baby talk.

&gt; He never ONCE cried the whole time he was there.

&gt; Night time rolls around and the baby is still with Saggy, sharing her mashed potatoes.

&gt; ""I guess he's spending the night!"" Saggy says excitedly.

&gt; Day three rolls around, still no momma.

&gt; Baby is playing on the ground, Saggy is finishing up some cooking.

&gt; Saggy goes to pick up this baby, and rather than picking him up normally, she just *grabs* him by the wrist and pulls him up to her chest.

&gt; Dramagirl and I both start to freak out. 

&gt; ""SAGGY YOU CAN'T PICK UP A BABY LIKE THAT! YOU'LL PULL HIS ARM OUT OF ITS SOCKET!""

&gt; Saggy is not giving two shits.

&gt; ""I gotta pick him up dat way I can't bend down and get him. Besides, black boys is always picked up dat way and roughed around a bit, it's what makes em strong!""

&gt; [OFW](http://i.imgur.com/0pdI3K9.gif)

&gt; Saggy smacks him a little bit on the cheek.

&gt; Baby still does not make a peep.

""Seeeeeeee!?""

&gt; Dramagirl and I share a look of horror.

&gt; Saggy serves the baby a plate of chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes, and lima beans. Enough for Dramagirl and I to share and covered in ketchup. 

&gt; Gets angry with baby when baby doesn't finish it all.

&gt; Baby still didn't cry.

&gt; Found out a few years later this is an almost sure sign of extreme child abuse.

&gt; Baby's momma shows up after 5 days of being AWOL. Apparently she went to the city with some boyz. Saggy is jelly and sad the little boy is leaving.

&gt; Saggy mopes around the house for the next week saying she has post-partum depression LOL.

&gt; Dramagirl and I start seeing animal turds all over the house.

&gt; Clean them up in confusion.

&gt; A few days later we hear the kitten. 

&gt; Saggy keeps it shut in her room almost 24/7. 

&gt; Dramagirl and I aren't heartless bitches, so we tell Saggy she can keep the cat as long as she lets it roam around (though not in our rooms ever) and she litter box trains it.

&gt; How many of you think she expended the calories to litter train the cat?

&gt; No one?

&gt; Good for you FPS, I'm proud of you.

**TL;DR:** Saggy babysits for a ~~day~~ week, and gets a kitten to cope with the loss after the abused baby returns home.

Finally a redeeming FPS, My mom loves this woman because she proved to her that no matter how hard it gets, you're the captain of your own ship and you can steer the vessel as you please, CARPE DIEM!

HamNoMore was brought to the hospital due to seizures

""IS IT MY BLOOD SUGAR?!""

ohnotagain.sigh

""No honey, you had a seizure, your blood sugar was way off the charts""

""THAT CANT BE TRUE, I WAS FINE""

""Your son said otherwise, you're lucky he called the ambulance in time""

She proceeds to hug her son and thank the my mom for helping her

""you know, you shouldn't really be living like this. your weight is causing complications and resulting in all this""

""YEAH BUT I CANT LOSE IT""

""How come?!""

""I work all day and take care of my babies at night, I deserve to eat food!""

""Yes you do but that much food is harmful, do you even prepare it yourself""

""I DONT KNOW HOW!""

The realization overcomes my mom that this woman is obese because she doesn't know how to cook and has resorted to eating takeout food due to convenience and time restrains

sadtruth.ppt

""I'm going to be completely honest with you, the way you're treating your body, your son over there won't even graduate high school before you're dead and before he even gets into high school, your feet will rot off, do you really want that?""

She started sobbing and told my mom that no way in hell she was going to let that happen to her kids 

""Look, I can tell you care about your son. I have a son as well and I want to be around him long enough to see him grow up. You're literally eating your way out of it""

""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO!""

""For starters, you will start walking daily and make your own food""

""BUT MUH KNEES HURT""

""It'll get better as you start losing weight""

""I DONT KNOW HOW TO COOK""

""I'll sign you up for classes""

Over the course of a year this woman ended up losing a 100lbs/45kg/7stone and learned how to cook and prepare meals for her son. She's still on keto and my mom sees her for a regular check up every couple of months and is incredibly proud of her

&gt; Lite mayo is full of purines

&gt; Manager takes me aside, tells me she's in all the time and just give her as much mayo as she wants or she'll flip the fuck out and call the police

&gt; I get another bottle, keep pouring until mayo is mounded up out of the sandwich

&gt; It's like a lobster roll if you replaced the lobster with mayo and then added extra mayo

A couple of days ago I posted [CancerSis Vs TrainPlanet](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jvfzs/cancersis_vs_trainplanet/).

In the comments there was a great outpour of support and well-wishes. For this I can not thank you enough.

CancerSis had her surgery this morning, and it was fully successful. The Post Surgery Scan confirms it is all completely removed.

The cancer is on its way to a lab for study due to it being a rare form.

CancerSis is at home now (mother and sister are both trained nurses so can change her dressings), with her new little ginger kitten. I'm told its got a white tummy and paws and is ""Fluffy as shit bro"" (LittleBrothers words).

Thank you once again for all your support, and thanks to the great team who looked after her, we should all be thankful for health services where someone can be diagnosed on a Tuesday and be given the all clear on a Friday.

Warning: The content in this story is based on real life events (sadly) and identities of the rolling balls of fat have been changed to protect the viewers from unnecessary stress. (PG-13)

Cut to start of residency training in cardiology (fuckyeah.jpeg) Rolling in that pile of money! just kidding, loans are expensive as shit. My mom is still hanging onto that sweetheart side of her, barely, by a string and hanging onto all hope for humanity

Spolier Alert: That hope will be crushed like a fatty crushes an aged wall 

My mom has had me as a baby! [thank you, thank you very much](http://img3.etsystatic.com/000/0/5198486/il_fullxfull.147798103.jpg) so she's still hanging onto that bay weight and now weighs about 130lbs/59kg/9.2stone. Swollen feet and post birth has really taken a toll on her mental wellbeing and has eroded her usually charmed personality.

Enter Siham and Gagfunkle (I'm not really that original with names) tipping the scales at a teeheeing 950lbs/431kg/61kg, a combined girth larger than the english channel and a combined body odour enough to make birds fall out of the sky. These two REAL people with their cheetos in tow were wobbling their way down to the cardiology department yelling out obscenities for not one nurse offering to help them carry their assess in a chair.

lordhavemercy.pray

It just happens to be my mom's lucky day as she gets to treat them

HURRAAAAYYY.no

She makes her way down to the room and sees these two behemoths in there are the smell triggers her gag reflex and flight response.(ourfatherartthouinheaven.helpme) She throws up a bit in her mouth but being the professional that she is moves on and inquires about their day and checks their chart

""How are you doi...""
""MY STOMACH HURTS""
""Let me check""
so she checked her stomach in between the rolls of skin, fat, something that closely resembled a chicken at one point and couldn't find anything 
""I cant see anything wrong, what have you had to eat recently?""
""THATS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS""
whatthefuck?
""well I can't really tell you what's wrong with you unless I find out a bit more about your situation""
""FIND ANOTHER WAY""
Feeling as though it would be a lost battle, she just shrugged it off and brought out an ultrasound machine 
""this will help us see clearly, now I'm going to need you to lay down on the bed""
OH PLEASE NO, THINK OF THE CHILDREN!
The bed creaked and grunted like it was its last hurrah and would go down fighting (goodonyoubro)
My mom started to check but the ultrasound couldn't really get through the layers of fat no matter how hard my mom tried 

An open letter to Jesus,
WHY ME? WHY!
Sincerely, iidank'smom

""Ma'am, I can't see anything so we..""
""WHADDU MEAN?! THIS THING IS BROKEN! YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, I WANT A REAL DOCTOR""
""I am your doctor, deal with it.""
""HMMPH!""
""I'll schedule an MRI scan and see what's up""

Now for those of you on FPS that don't know, MRI machines have a weight limit of 400 lbs and have a diameter of 3 feet which is enough for 95% of the world. My mom gets a call from the radiologist 

""WHAT WERE YOU THINKING! SHE'S GOING TO BREAK THE MACHINE! I'm not going to risk it""
""I know but its either that or invasive surgery and in her condition that is dangerous"" 

So they both were called upon to the office of the Chief of Medicine and was decided that to protect against any liability we would give the hippo an MRI

Turns out, this woman had swallowed so much fried chicken along with bits of bone that they were stuck in her stomach and resulted in the pain

whatthefuckisgoingonhere

She was sent into surgery and to this day, I tip my hat off to that surgeon who found that woman's intestines and stomach beneath all that fat. He should be given a medal for bravery and fortitude

TL;DR Massive woman complains of stomach pain as a result of eating a shit ton of chicken along with its bones.

&gt;&gt;""You should read these. Being fat is genetic, okay? I eat healthy and exercise *allllllllll* the time, but my genetics make me gain weight. I was born this way. You should be ashamed to work at a fat-oppressing company like this.""   

&gt;&gt;Her speech has left her out of breath.   

&gt;&gt;I try not to roll my eyes.  

&gt;&gt;The papers are typical HAES, fat acceptance stuff, all printed out from various blogs.

&gt;&gt;The family I saw earlier calls her over.  

&gt;&gt;It's her family. The thin, athletic family share genetics with her.  

&gt;&gt;But she was totally born fat, right???  


This probably isn't that funny, but I'm still kind of amazed that a SJW actually made the jump from tumblr to real life. For the record, I have nothing against social justice... I'm just generally more concerned with bigger issues, like, you know, homelessness and stuff like that, than the fact that you can't shop in a certain store. I probably just need to check my privilege, though. :/

**For reference (or a key if you will);**

&gt;""PorkPlanet"" - Name says it all. Housemate. 350+ 1b (estimate) Sociopath. She does not like my new and improved fat2fit life, is trying her hardest to appose it and ruin our already fucked up friendship. There's always one of these in a fat2fit tale I suppose. The series is based on her. 

&gt;""AS"" - Housemate. Intolerant of PorkPlanet. Bad-ass. 

&gt;""KK"" - Housemate. Health &amp; Fitness goddess. Quiet and thoughtful. Also a redditor, told me to post stuff on here to begin with. 

&gt;""Cuteguy"" - Boyfriend. Hillarious. Bit of a Jackass to PorkPlanet for reasons. Here for the lelz. 

**There are other characters (other housemates which I will mark as #1, #2 etc, parents, Uni friends) but the ones above feature heavily so these will be the only ones introduced for now in each chapter.**

------------------------------
***Foreshadowing: This story/transcript isn't really going to make sense unless you've read the series previously and know PorkPlanet.*** 

Ok guys, you asked for this. You're jimmies, at least for some of you, have left the building and formed new lives in different countries. You're all deeply rustled and I can understand perfectly. You need to know about the fight I mentioned at the end of the hospital visit story between ""AS"" and PorkPlanet and the faithful OP I am, I have delivered.

In summary, PorkPlanet &amp; my housemates [visited me in hospital](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fyjfx/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_five_porkplanet/) after I needed surgery for my broken hand, [which Porkplanet originally broke](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f3t5e/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_two_the_tale_of_my/). She eventually got kicked out by Nursing staff after 20 minutes for being loud, disruptive and eventually aggressive towards AS, all while I sat in my hospital bed only a few hours after surgery ""wtf'in"" and trying to keep the peace. 

When KK, AS and two other housemates arrived home, Porkplanet had already been home for five minutes as she left first in her car. She was in the kitchen (go figure) and AS immediately followed to confront her further about her behavior at the hospital and her behavior in general over the last few months, especially towards me. 

Tensions have been rising between the two for a long time, to say the least. KK entered the kitchen but only briefly as it was getting heated and scream-ish, but she was able to place her phone on the kitchen table face-down with the microphone recording. Obviously I am NOT going to post the Audio, for reasons, but I will instead type up a few of the golden statements from the argument. It was nearly 20 minutes in length. 

The caps are there to highlight how shouty it all a bit was. 

For those who love AS, you will love this story the most. This is The Transcript. Enjoy. 

-------------------

&gt; AS: You were such a fucking bitch at the table what IS wrong with you?

&gt; Porkplanet: THE NURSE HAD A PROBLEM WITH ME I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

*lelelel*

-----------
&gt;AS: You OBVIOUSLY have a problem with Cuteguy being with imgonnamakeit, you're just fucking jealous. Why can't you just be fucking nice with him jesus christ?! He's so fucking nice to everyone. Nobody has a bad word to say about him except for you!

&gt; Porkplanet: HE DOESN'T TREAT HER PROPERLY. HE ENCOURAGES HER WITH ALL THIS WEIGHT LOSS STUFF. SHE'S BEEN DIFFERENT SINCE SHE GOT WITH HIM. YOU KNOW THAT. I CAN TELL WHAT HE'S LIKE.

&gt; AS: Are you fucking joking me. He only encourages her because it makes her happy to be doing something constructive with her life. 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

&gt; AS: WHATEVER YOU THINK IT MEANS. YOU SIT ON YOUR ARSE WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM UNI EVERY DAY  AND COMPLAIN THAT WE'RE ALL OUT AT THE GYM OR DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE. 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHATEVER I DON'T WANT TO COME TO  THE GYM WITH YOU.

&gt; AS: GOOD BECAUSE YOU'D FUCKING CAUSE A SCENE THERE AS WELL.

---------
&gt; AS: So you think imgonnamakeit was happier in her relationship with exboyfrend?

&gt; Porkplanet: WELL SHE WAS  DIFFERENT AND HE CERTAINLY NEVER ENCOURAGED HER TO GO AND LOSE WEIGHT AND CHANGE HER OWN LIFE. HE ACCEPTED HER FOR WHO SHE IS.

&gt; AS: Are you fucking nuts? 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHAT?

&gt; AS: All he ever did was make comments about her weight and make her feel like shit. 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHATEVER SHE WAS HAPPY.

&gt; AS: You are so fucking dense. 

*Sidenote; Porkplanet and Exboyfriend have been friends for a long time. Probably why she white knights him so much, and plus - she was happier with how our friendship was when exboyfriend and I were together because I was always at home feeling shit about myself.* 

--------
&gt;  Porkplanet: When we were at imgonnamakeits parents for bank holiday weekend, Cuteguy was looking at housemate #2 innapropriately the WHOLE WEEKEND. 

&gt; AS: NO HE WASN'T. HOUSEMATE #2 WASN'T EVEN THERE THAT FUCKING WEEKEND SHE WAS THERE THE LAST TIME WE WENT. AND CUTEGUY WASN'T THERE THEN. YOU'RE FUCKING LYING ABOUT CUTEGUY LOOKING AT OTHER WOMEN NOW? WOW.

&gt; Porkplanet: *silence*

*Obviously this is the funniest piece of the whole audio to me. I can't believe that if she was going to make a lie up about cuteguy like that she wouldn't get the facts right.** 

------------
&gt;AS: *mumbles*... YOU BROKE HER FUCKING HAND TO BEGIN WITH.

&gt; Porkplanet:  NO I DIDN'T STOP FUCKING SAYING THAT.

&gt; AS: YOU ROLLED THE ROCK ONTO IT. THEN FUCKING CRUSHED THEM.

&gt; Porkplanet: NOT ON PURPOSE WITH THE ROCK. AND I DIDN'T CRUSH THEM.

*lololol*

---------
&gt;Porkplanet: *mumbles about my weight loss* She looks unhealthy. 

&gt; AS: What the fucking hell are you talking about now? She looks AMAZING. Men have turned their heads on the street when we walk past. She's BEAUTIFUL. You're just FUCKING JEALOUS. I can't believe you would even say something so stupid. She's the opposite of unhealthy. She's the healthiest she's ever been.

&gt; Porkplanet: I've never seen that with the men so whatever. STOP SAYING I'M JEALOUS.

----

&gt; AS: EVERYONE fucking talks about how [RIDICULOUS you looked wearing the same outfit](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f267s/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_pt1_the_night_out/) as imgonnamakeit that night. When are you gonna realize? PEOPLE FUCKING KNOW HOW JEALOUS OF HER YOU ARE.

&gt; Porkplanet: I DIDN'T KNOW SHE BOUGHT THAT OUTFIT. 

&gt; AS: YES YOU DID. Everyone fucking knows it. And people laugh [about the fucking pole](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f2gb2/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_part_2/).

&gt; Porkplanet: THE POLE WAS ALREADY BROKEN!!!

*Right, the great huge metal pole was already bent down the middle before you applied over 300lb of pressure to it in that exact spot..... at least the people of reddit believe you, right, reddit? right...?* 

-------
&gt; AS: You are such a burden to live with and be around.... You make us all just not want to hang out with you after Uni. Do you know how fucking hard it is? Do you? 

&gt;  Porkplanet: JUST MOVE OUT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME CAUSE I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

&gt; AS: You better hope WE don't move out. 

&gt; Porkplanet: You guys have a year and a half left on the lease. 

&gt; AS: I'm sure we can arrange for some FUCKING IDIOTS to take over our contracts so you can live with people more suitable. 

*Everybody, after me, we love AS... we love AS!*

-----

&gt; AS: *mumbling* you're a fucking nightmare *mumbling mumbling on the microphone* 

&gt; Porkplanet: I'M GONNA SLAP YOU IN A MINUTE.

&gt; AS: GO ON THEN, I'LL GET A ROCK FROM THE GARDEN AND SMASH YOUR HAND AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT.

*Housemate #2 stepped in at this point, 'cause obviously threatening violence isn't good, but this is by far the funniest part for me.*

---------
&gt; AS: Fuck this, I'm going to bed. There is NO telling you, anything... you'll never change.

&gt; Porkplanet: That's right, fuck off to bed and ring imgonnamakeit and tell her about how I'm such a fucking bitch. 

&gt; AS: What? Is that it? Are you jealous of mine and hers friendship? Cause we spend time together, at the gym and such? 

&gt; Porkplanet: *scoffs* Your friendship doesn't even come close to the friendship she and I have. 

&gt; AS: Oh my god, you're like, totally deluded. Are you mental? 

----
*
So there we have it. Sorry I should post more, but the audio is so shouty/screamy in some parts, and they moved a lot across the kitchen (which is large) so the audio was no good for a lot of it. I hope your jimmies have eased and returned home after seeing AS give Porkplanet a dose of truth syrup on her pancakes. I haven't yet had ""the talk"" with PorkPlanet about her behavior yet as it hasn't been the right time.... but soon....  soon my friends.*

&gt; As public transportation usually is during rush hour, it's packed more than Hamthrax's snack drawer

&gt; Think sardines, but everyone has a backpack so there's at least a little bit of wiggle room within the seething mass of humanity.

&gt; Unsurprisingly, everyone is standing so as many people can fit on as possible

&gt; Train reaches a new stop

&gt; Doors open

&gt; Subway employee sticks his head in to yell at us to 'make way'

&gt; This is fairly routine if someone in a wheelchair is getting on, so everyone on the train sighs and squishes together

&gt; whatcanyoudo.gif

&gt; A bit peeved at having to smell the Axe on the dudebro in front of me, but whatever

&gt; Suddenly, the birds go silent. All is terribly, horrifyingly still

&gt; the calm before the storm

&gt; The music on my iPod switches to the Imperial March out of sheer terror of what's about to go down

&gt; Slowly, horrifically, it mounts the threshold of the subway on a Rascal scooter

&gt; No clue what height it is, but roughly spherical. By my humble estimates over 450 lbs

&gt; Gender: undiscernable

&gt; Scent: inconceivable

&gt; Collective murmuring in disbelief

&gt; Dudebro mutters 'are you fucking *kidding* me'

&gt; We have to squeeze back even more as it lurches towards us. 

&gt; A tiny old woman, who someone had graciously given their seat, is directly in the path of Ceres

&gt; The adipose mound grinds to a halt

&gt; Words echo from its atherosclerosis-coated maw

&gt; 'Get up'

&gt; The collective shock and hate of 30+ people is completely lost on it. 

&gt; 'Get up, I need to get through'

&gt; Someone speaks up from the back 'Maybe you should, but you'd probably get a heart attack'

&gt; Never in my life have I seen a scooter spin so fast

&gt; 'WHO SAID THAT'

&gt; entire train is silent

&gt; At this point the little old lady has gotten to her feet 'Don't worry, I don't want any trouble'

&gt; Bacontinent continues to give everyone the stink eye as it moves down its path of choice

&gt; But the worst is yet to come

&gt; A 'teehee' is all the warning we'll get as a cloud of poisonous gas erupts from its greasy nether regions with all the fury of ten thousand Big Macs

&gt;Lots of grunt work gettin' a little sweaty. I'm getting school credits to work out and listen to the classical music that calms the puppies. Also love classical music


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/Lo6MS.gif)


&gt;Asked to go out to the front to help with a customer


&gt;Ohshit.jpg


&gt;I walk out from the back (where the more advanced pets are kept [Big birds, puppies, etc.])


&gt;How did Jupiter get into our store


&gt;Oh wait, it's a person, not a celestial body


&gt;BEfore R (manager's son/front counter guy) can even say anything, I know 


&gt;Disgonbebad


A little backstory: The pet store I work at is small family owned, and has been in business for 20 years they can *usually* handle themselves. But, they are an Asian family who are not large in stature. I'm only 5'8"", but I became somewhat of an impromptu bouncer for the store. 


&gt;This woman was short, I had at least eight inches on her (once again, I'm only 5'8"", so that's saying something)


&gt;Makes up for lacked height with girth


&gt;Had to be at least 450 pounds


&gt;Think [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-2496-body-shape.htm?StartAt=5#.UcuvvM19G3c), but 7-8 inches shorter


&gt;Let's call her Rotunda, shall we?


&gt;R says to Rotunda, ""Tell Thes what you are requesting?""


&gt;She gurgles about how ""She wants a bird to cuddle""


&gt;[MFW birds are not cuddly, nor easy to take care for (plus they get easily attached to humans... A heart attack would be more traumatizing to them than to you)](http://i.imgur.com/2Se3JOD.gif)


&gt;Waitruserious.jpg


&gt;I say ""Well, we have some beautiful budgies, canaries, and finches! Which type of bird would you-""


&gt;She interrupts me to say ""I don't want none of them. You can't cuddle one of them, I thought you were good at this.""


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/OOSWLFC.gif) no one brought up the fact that I am ""good at this"". Not to toot my own horn, but I am


&gt;She screeches: ""I want a parrot!""


&gt;[MFW parrots live for a long time and she almost died walking the ten feet from the parking lot to the door](http://i.imgur.com/BVzQk.gif)


&gt;""Okay ma'am, we have a gorgeous Senegal Parrot-""


&gt;""Nooooo, those are really just lovebirds, everybody knows that!""

&gt;""Okay, well... We also have a Jardine's Parrot.""


&gt;""Can I have that one?""


&gt;""Do you mean can you hold him?""


&gt;""Yeah, whatever, go get *it*.""


Ruh-roh.jpg, this Jardine's is one *nasty bird*. I've been handling him every day for a month and he still isn't used to me. He bites. Hard.
I really don't want to bring this bird out


&gt;But, suchislife.jpg


&gt;Go get the bird, extra handling glove for for Rotunda


&gt;I warn her: Be gentle, don't move to fast, don't get all up in his grill, he will bite you if you do


&gt;""Yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing! Just go away.""


&gt;Notachanceinhell.jpg


&gt;I watch as the bird makes his regular 'chirping' noises


&gt;She mimics him


&gt;Than she says: ""What was that, birdie?"" ***And she leans down so her face is a centimeter from his***


&gt;Dis bitch gon lose an eye


&gt;She turns her hear to ""hear him better"" and suprise, motherfrickin' suprise, the bird clamps down on dat lobe like a hammie on a cheeseburger


&gt;Resounding shrieks of ""My ear! My ear!""


&gt;She is actually waddling around flailing her arms, leaving the bird to dangle like a morbid earring


&gt;The bird lets go, and glides to the floor, starts bird-walking towards me and the door to the back room


&gt;Reminds me of [this](http://funnyasduck.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/funny-whos-good-boy-not-me-dog-walking-fire-pics.jpg)


&gt;She stops waddlin', screams at me that she'll sue for 'discrimination'


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/YRDDs28.gif)


&gt;""You're gonna sue a *bird*?"" 


&gt;I'm laughing at this point


&gt;""You guys are training them birds to hate fat people! FAT SHAMERS! FAT SHAMERS!""


&gt;She waddles out the door, still screeching ""FAT SHAMERS!"" towards the heavens


&gt; R says: ""That was bad."" in his thick accent


&gt;I can still faintly hear whale calls of ""FAT SHAMERS"" resounding through the parking lot


&gt;Parrot is henceforth known as BirdBro


&gt;R says I did nothing wrong, I can bring BirdBro back to his cage

1374784658.0	1j1vgr	Tale of a Librarian's Anger	shakey_bakey	524	77	117	"I am a 23 year old hamplanet myself, working on getting my *cuuuuurves* under control. I would like to call myself cardio bunny one day. However, today, I only look like I ate a cardio bunny instead of my McBeetus. Teehee!

Today, I went to my school campus. I take online courses mostly, but I needed to do some research for a class. I parked a little way away from the door (which is about 300 feet for you non-Texans, or 100 meters for your non-Muricans), got out of my car, and began to shuffle my booty towards the building. It's fucking hot, I'm wearing all black because of work clothes, and there is no shade. So I'm shufflin' really fast.

&gt;&gt;Datsweetairconditioning.unf

I feel an odd pull on me, but since I am Hamplanet myself, I can fight it. I do notice that the poor birds have trouble staying in the sky. :(

&gt;&gt;Rest in peace, you brave little bastards.

This car comes screeching up to the fire lane. Now, it wasn't going fast. It was about three inches off the ground. It hit every major bump in the road, letting out a deafening *screee-unk-thunk* noise each time. I hurry across the crosswalk. There's no way that the car would be able to stop if I was caught out there.

&gt;&gt;F=ma

&gt;&gt;F=Hamplanet x 30mph (^RustyBrakes )

&gt;&gt;F=NOPE

Two women got out of the car. Lady driver stays in the car. She is a normal sized lady, no fat rolls to be seen from where I'm standing. The passenger, who gets out, is a little tubbier, 5'4 140, but I'm not judgin'. Then I notice that they brought a pet with them. I slow down to make sure they don't leave their elephant in the car. Animal cruelty is bad, mmkay? Then the door opens with a low groan of rusted metal.

I stop when it hits me. It smells like oily fish and cheap car perfume, with a base note of mold and sweat, all amplified by the scorching Texas heat. One doughy, fleshy, well-manicured foot comes out. I see plastic talons glued onto her toes, covered in rhinestones and garish pink polish. I see ashy ankles and pasty white, scaly looking heels.

&gt;&gt;*screeeeeeech*

The *thing* within comes out. I feel a massive tug on my limbs and I go tumbling against a tree for support.

&gt;&gt;Tree shivers in protest

She stands up and I am in awe of her figure. This luscious specimen of Amazonian perfection stands at 6'2 in flip-flops. Her face is small, but the rest of her body extends out in every direction, like a perfect circle that starts immediately at her shoulders and ends at her knees. She looks like a stick of sausage with toothpicks in it. The nubbin at the top is her head, and the toothpicks are her calves. Her thighs are each the size of my hips. Her thighs have fupas of their own, little pouches of fat and skin that droop down over her knee cap. I can't even begin to estimate a weight. 400 lbs, perhaps?

It's obvious that I'm jelly, isn't it? Her thighs are cylinders, tubes of cottage-cheese dimpled flesh, sausages perched upon toothpicks. Her feet can't even come together. Instead of walking, the great Amazonian Beluga does this weird, side-to-side penguin shuffle to kick her legs up off the ground and swing them forward. I can hear the denim between her upper thighs screeching in protest. Because of this, I now know how spontaneous combustion occurs.

All the time, she is complaining about how far the entrance is from the fire lane. It's not even forty feet, I think to myself, and then I immediately reprimand myself for being such a fat-shaming anorexic little bitch.

I shuffle by her and open the door. Since she's so far away, I don't bother holding the door. She's about halfway between the fire lane and the door and I ain't got time for dat.

&gt;&gt;timeforalibrarycardYEAH

I wait patiently in line in the library. It's a long line, it's summer, and I couldn't afford my book this semester. The campus keeps copies of some of the required titles for student use. She finally makes it in, sweat glistening upon her lumpy, luscious lovejugs. I politely look away because I can't handle all dem currrves. She immediately glares at me and stomps over. I grab the counter to steady myself.

&gt;&gt;Poor young Asian girl grasps valiantly at my hand, but her hand slipped out of mine. Girl disappears into the event horizon. You will be missed...and since you're gone, can I have that cookie? Kthx

""SCYUSE ME,"" she bellows. I wince - libraries are meant to be quiet. Can't she read the sign that says ""Please be quiet and courteous""?

""Yes?"" I whisper in response.

""DIS BE DA LINE FO CHECKIN SHIT OUT?""

""Yes.""

The librarian is starting to get upset now. I scoot away another inch or two in the hopes of getting away from her gloriously gigantic gunt. She comes closer and slaps a piece of paper down on the counter, sending a ripple through time, space, and the universe.

&gt;&gt;A Hamplanet can flap her wings in Texas and cause an earthquake in Australia

&gt;&gt;I'm so sorry, Australia

&gt;&gt;so sorry

""AWRIGHT, I WANT THIS BOOK.""

Librarian sees opening.

""Ma'am, this is a library. As such, you will keep your voice down, or you will leave. I will give you your book as soon as you get in line.""

I brace myself for impact.

""WAT CHOO MEAN LINE? DER AIN'T NO LINE HERE!""

I look behind me - there's at least nine people behind me. Librarian gives her look that could freeze hell.

""Lower your voice. I will not ask you again. There is a line, right over there, where it *says end of line*."" She points at it. Beluga looks, the wheels in her mind turning slowly as she reads the words out loud.

""LOOK LADY, I CAN'T STAND IN NO LINE, I GOTS - ""

&gt;&gt;Is this my first RL FPS?

&gt;&gt;I think it is

&gt;&gt;omg

"" - BAD KNEES. I'M HERE ALREADY, GIMME DA BOOK.""

Librarian ignores her while the other people in front of me get their books. Beluga finally gets the hint and goes to the end of the line. People can breathe a little easier now. Blue pallor of small gentleman behind me disappears. Color returns to his cheeks. He looks relieved.

&gt;&gt;Suddenly, a wild idea appears

When it's my turn, I ask for the book that Beluga needed, as well as the one that I need. Librarian grins at me.

""Last book, sweetie. Be sure to return it in three hours.""

I take my books and quickly waddle for the stairs. I hear the explosion half-way up.

""WAT CHOO MEAN DER AIN'T NONE LEFT?! WHO TOOK IT?""

Like one of those bad movies, Beluga looks up at me when I look down at her. She sees the book in my arms.

""HEY, I NEED DAT - ""

I shuffle up the stairs and hide behind a bookshelf. Beluga tries to send Chubby Friend after me, but Chubby friend refuses. Beluga argues and gets kicked out.

tl;dr: Beluga gets loud in the library, I check out the only copy of the book she needs, Beluga goes crazy, Beluga gets escorted out.

1375415305.0	1jjklc	The Epilogue of Porcina - Chapter Eighteen - ALTERNATE ENDING	RamsesThePigeon	663	215	40	"*Okay, folks... what you're about to read didn't actually happen, but after all the concern voiced in the comments, I just couldn't leave you hanging. Hold on to your jimmies, and prepare to be upset.*

**Chapter Eighteen – ALTERNATE ENDING**

Impossible.

*Impossible*.

Lauren, though certainly not the smallest girl I had ever seen, was *tiny*. Not just in stature, but in size. She had once complained to me about needing to shop in the “Junior” section of clothing stores (though, I confess, I'd not had any idea what that meant). Imagining her as being overweight was not just difficult, it was... well, *unimaginable*.

I stood there, at a loss, as Lauren sobbed into her hand. 

Porcina kept her eyes averted. 

Aaron played his game.

“*Ergh*!” Lauren screamed, the sound muffled by her palm. “You... you *heartless*...” she faltered and sobbed again, gasping for air. “*Why*, Porcina? *Just tell me why*!”

In a tiny voice, Porcina asked: “What do you need from me?”

“I –” Lauren stammered, and a strange look came into her eye. “I need about tree fiddy.”

Tree fiddy.

Well, it was *about that time* I noticed that this *petite young woman* was about forty feet tall, and was a *creature* from the paleolithic era! I yelled, “Goddamn it, you Loch Ness monster! Ain't nobody giving you no *tree fiddy*!” Then I tore away from her and ran across the floor (everybody walk the dinosaur!), making my way outside, only to see none other than *Einstein* standing there before me! Suddenly, his head split open and a UFO popped out of it, the force of which shook an enormous wad of spaghetti from his pocket! It was too much for me. So, I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, the license plate said “FRESH” and it had *dice* in the mirror! (If anything, I can say that this cab was rare.) But I thought “Man, forget it! Yo, homes, to [Bel-Air](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)!”

And then everything in the entire history of ever exploded at all once because someone got a Pop-Tart stuck in a toaster.

1373858722.0	1ibegz	Wigglytuff from Elementary School.	Sutoraida	568	120	66	"Hopefully you guys like this one, it tops the Dugong imo. 

Commence story telling.

This creature named Wigglytuff was apparently 10 years old, and suddenly appeared from parts unknown. The wild Wigglytuff came from a city near by. She was an oddity, her exact size is a blur but she was round, so very round. 

Wigglytuff was an obnoxious child, she didn't behave like a normal ten year old. She stole food, and toys from her peers. She was also treated her only friend terribly.

Her classmates were not amused by her antics in the least. They avoided her like the plague and rightfully so. She was greedy, manipulative, and was always hungry.

One incident that was etched her classmates' mind, was when her one and only friend was moving to a neighbouring city. Her friend brought cupcakes and quality chocolates for all! Everything went well, until the beast wasn't appeased with her portion.

She cried for seconds, but ended up going for thirds and fourths. She had no shame! No sense in the fact that the only girl who would tolerated her BS was leaving. Nope she kept eating like a starving animal.

This girl also stole some chocolates the girl was saving for her family. She was a true glutton.

As far as this girl's eating habits went, her mother enabled her bratty and demanding behaviour. Gave her all the food she could ever ask for. Wigglytuff was of East African descent, her culture subtly encourages eating and weight gain.  She would say her mother told her she was a growing girl, and she would grow into her ""meat"". She needed to eat guys!

This kid was an insufferable cunt, I was that cunt. This was ten years ago, and I'm happy to say I'm a completely different person. From an obnoxious bison, to a quiet mouse.

I wish I could find that girl and apologize. I don't know how she put up with me."	t5_2vzax	True
1372258080.0	1h3zan	Lent: Swarm of Whales	LouisaLu	534	84	108	"Hi again fps! Let me regale you with another story from my fast food days at a certain fish restaurant.  This story is not about a particular whale, but a mass congregation of numerous whales.  I don't remember what any of them looked like, only that they were all enormous.

&gt; be me, small Asian teenager

&gt; clueless about Midwest Lent traditions

&gt; only heard cute stories from friends

&gt; ""I gave up soda to experience sacrifice.""  

&gt; oic.jpg, give up something you like, candy/soda/junk.

&gt;Lent nears.  

&gt; Managers at Fish Food Place give a stern warning:

&gt; ""Brace yourself.  Lent is coming.""

&gt; huh? What does fish have to do with Lent? 

&gt; friend who works there explains:

&gt; ""During Lent, Catholics can't eat meat, so they all eat fish on certain fridays. We get lines of people wrapped around the building.  It's utter chaos.""

&gt; heh, can't be that bad, right?  ... right?

Preparing for Lent we were all required to work those Friday nights.  If you wanted to get out of it, you had to ask off for more than a month in advance, and being mostly teens with no sense of planning, none of us had the foresight to ask off.  One of our managers did, and I can still remember that night how she cackled as she was taking off her badge and hat, bidding us farewell with ""see ya, suckers!""

&gt; Anticipate Lent.  Hear low rumbling. jurassicparkwater.gif

&gt; Whales converge on feeding spot.  oh shit, oh shit, oh shit...

&gt; they're already prying at the door-  sweet Lincoln's mullet, it's all true

&gt; Whales form spiral line wrapped around the building twice

So what happens next is the break down of society, basically.  You know how when a natural disaster occurs, people start looting?  Or during Black Friday, crazed shoppers stampede and leave nothing but broken plastic and dust?  That happened, but with grease and fish flying everywhere.

&gt; Whales somehow penetrate the door. Squeeze as many in as possible

&gt; orders fly everywhere.  our flimsy little fryers can't handle this

&gt; Have dining room duty, oh my fucking god.... oh god oh shit.

&gt; piles of trash everywhere, people no longer using trashcans

&gt; disgusting coat of pure grease slime coats the floor

&gt; slide around dining room like skating rink

&gt; HORRORS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK

&gt; Whales shoveling plates of hot fish into their gaping maws

&gt; IT NEVER ENDS

&gt; Whales stealing each others left overs

&gt; Whales battle over whose order is up, since they are all fish

&gt; confusing and cursing and yelling

&gt; One whale wasn't satisfied with our fish.

&gt; decides to come to register and throw fish at my face.

&gt; what. the. fuck.

&gt; no words come out of whale.  

&gt; can't even tell which one it was, the sea is a swarm

&gt; feel like I am drowning in oil.  halp.mov

This goes on for what seems an eternity.  Eventually we run out of fish, even though we ordered extra just for Lent. 

&gt; aching bones... stand in wreckage of Whale feeding

&gt; PTSD.dat

&gt; shell shocked. still need to clean up.  no will to go on.

I ask an older lady manager, Bea, who is a devout something or other, what the deal was.

&gt; ""Isn't fish is meat?""

&gt; ""No, fish is more like...""  Bea struggles to find the right word

&gt; ""Water.  Yeah.  Fish are like water so you can eat it during Lent.""

wat.

These were the kind where you would spend the week before school started tromping around the New England wilderness getting to know some other freshmen (as well as yourself, honestly). They decided to pair myself and a future professional athlete (let's call him CL) to lead a group. The school had put forth a lot of effort to be inclusive, so they had really easy trips for people who weren't in top physical state. 

&gt;Be senior year of college

&gt;pumped to lead some freshies into the wilderness

&gt; assigned easiest level trip

&gt;disappointed, but whatever, time to motherfuckin' hike bitches

&gt;mix of of asthmatics, skinny fats, some lazy kids, and a spoiled hamplanet (SH)

&gt;all have good attitudes, except SH

&gt; about 5'7"" 300lbs

&gt;ruh roh

&gt; gave benefit of doubt, though

&gt;maybe kid wants change (seeing as he picked physically most difficult type of orientation)

&gt;lolnope.jpg  

&gt;starts whining as soon as we start 8-day trip

&gt;whining that his brand new super hi-speed gear wasn't comfy

&gt;whining that he forgot his nalgenes of water

&gt;whining that the food was shit (da fuck did you expect?)

&gt;whining about *walking uphill.*

&gt;jimmiesrustled.jpg

&gt;attempt maturity, since they are fucking kids 

&gt;explain shit patiently

&gt;give SH props when he finished something hard

Fourth day of trip begins

&gt;no improvement is SH behavior or attitude

&gt;always red and tired, the hiking isn't really easy

&gt;CL and I start personality clashing

&gt;shit not great in utopia

&gt;turns out, pairing two type A athletic asshole leaders with a bunch of whiney teens was a poor choice

&gt;discord causes us to read map wrong

&gt;plan for day had been to go up two small hills then camp

&gt;two small hills morph into one steep-as-fuck hill

&gt;inform freshies when we realize (about 4 hrs into hiking day)

&gt; SH loses his fucking mind

&gt;starts screaming into woods Adam Ondra style

&gt;screaming that we are lost

&gt;screaming that CL and I are incompetent

&gt;screaming that we are going to die

""LOOK. JUST BECAUSE IT'S HARD DOESN'T MEAN IT'S WRONG. SOMETIMES SHIT IS JUST HARD. YOU NEED TO LEARN THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SURVIVE THIS TRIP OR LIFE.""

&gt;silence for rest of day

&gt;SH stops complaining so much

last day 

&gt; everyone, including SH, hikes big-ass mountain bottom-to-top and back down in 12 hours

&gt;feels good man

When we get back to civilization, I noped the fuck out of there. Trip was hard one everyone emotionally. I didn't really hang with any of the freshies afterward either (also my senior year, so I was otherwise occupied).

Flashforward to *their* senior year.

&gt;not only that, he had become the coxswain of our varsity crew 8-man boat

Not only did he get his weight under control, he got his attitude to a point where he could effectively act as a *coxswain* to a boat of superathletes. That's basically coaching people through a daily torture chamber. They all seemed to love the guy (from what I could tell).

1376577883.0	1kf5lj	The Whale who Drowned in Soda	WhaleLordStoryteller	544	92	105	"Hi guys. I've been lurking on this subreddit ever since it was born. You see, I have many many MANY MANY stories of whales, pigs, planets, and moons alike. I've had professions dealing with such, people. For now, let me tell you a simple story. This is when I was only thirteen, and I just discovered the amazing species derived from humans: THE WHALES

It happened in a KFC. My friend and I arrived in the bare, desolate restaurant in hopes of getting a cheap filling meal. There were only a couple of people in front of us, no biggie(we can wait). When it was finally our turn to order, we heard a deep disturbing cry.

""MOVE OUT OF THE WAY I WAS HERE FIRST."" A large 6'0 Caucasian man in a too tight leather jacket and shorts pushed us out of the way; he was definitely pushing around 450 pounds of gool ol' fat.

Whatever. We're too fucking passive to say anything. We don't say a word and let him push us out of the way.

He orders this enormous amount of food: Bucket of Original Fried Chicken, Large Popcorn Chicken, Three Biscuits, Cole Slaw, and a regular coke.

Finally he takes his 450 pound self to the elevators to go on the second floor. We watch that monstrosity leave, and then order our food. We got our food first, since we only ordered some fries and cole slaw and share it. Five minutes into eating, we see Mr. Whale go up to the soda machine, and refill his soda. He refills it, ten times. TEN. HOW DOES SOMEONE FILL THEIR SODA CUP TEN TIMES IN THE SPAN OF 15 MINUTES. HOW. 

The staff begins to notice this, and tells him to stop(the limit is only two refills). The whale ignores him. The staff gets frustrated, but leaves the whale alone. Well obviously, all the liquids inside him must be aching to go to the toilet, so a minute later he heads to the restroom. 

While he was gone, me and my friend share quiet conversation. ""Hey did you see how much soda he drank? I was so amazed. Well, more disgusted honestly, but amazed.""

""Yeah dude, anyways, we should finish this before we ne-""

We hear a scream, and then a thud. All this staff start come running upstairs, and I started thinking there was a murder. But no. It wasn't.

It was the whale. The whale.

And the whale got harpooned.

My friend and I start asking around a few minutes later. We go up to one of the staff, a young man who went by the name of Julio. Julio was nice, very kind. And he reveals the most horrific ending. Julio speaks in a shocked voice, ""That hefty man you saw over there a while ago, the one who cut you two in line? Well, he drank so much soda that he started shitting all over the stall. He barely got his pants down before it splattered all across the ceiling and floor. And the worst thing is, he got stuck. He's so fat that when he tried to squeeze in the restroom stalls, he got stuck and he couldn't get out. He's been in there for a couple of minutes. Poor Frank, he's going to have to clean that huge mess."" 

**Tldr**; [Whale is so fat, he can't escape the bathroom stall since it is slowly suffocating him. He also shits all over the place. Frank has to clean the mess. 911 gets called and they have to take apart the stall to get him out.] (/spoiler)

Now, you may know me from my previous 'live update' tale of a lovely encounter with an tantrum chucking, ant eating nebula from my SO's local kebab store. But today, I shall give you a tale of idiocy from my past, in high school. 

&gt; Sitting down, enjoying some delicious lunch under the shade of a gum tree

&gt; No drop bears, this time thankfully

&gt; A large shadow appears above me

&gt; Oh god, I didn't check the tree's properly!

&gt; Prepare for a vicious assault on my face

&gt; Instead, receive a vicious assault on my eyes and nose

&gt; What appears to both look and smell like rotten cottage cheese approaches me

The class idiot (genuine idiot. failed all her classes, even the specially formulated ones for struggling students. She just couldn't.... GET things) has arrived, and in her full 'slutty' glory. She enjoyed being called a 'sexual being', 'slut' and 'whore', at the age of 14. I think she watched too many 90's R&amp;B videos. However, because she bragged about being a virgin when she converted to Catholicism a year later, I shall instead call her Rosie O'[DingDong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Dong). 

&gt; She breaths deeply, as though the air somehow has calories she can utilize for her curves

&gt; Her 'breasts' rise and fall under her 3 sizes too small blouse

&gt; Buttons look like they require counselling and diazepam

&gt; Private school emblem stretched to twice it's size on the pocket

&gt; ""Heeeeey! I couldn't find you eating lunch where you usually sit! This is such a nice spot, but it's too far away from the tuckshop!""

&gt; Always in a goddamn over enthusiastic tone

&gt; O'DingDong has trouble trying to sit on the ground

&gt; Thought that the lack of chairs would dissuade her

&gt; Thousands die from an earthquake in New Zealand as the shock waves from her ungraceful fall cause the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates to collide

&gt; New mountains are formed

Now, I had been attending this school for 3 years at this point, and was still finding my place to really sit and talk with friends. I had only one friend I actually enjoyed talking to often at this point, and she was away, so I tried my hardest to escape O'DingDong's orbit. But as we all know, physics is a bitch.

&gt; Slightly shuffle away, slowly chewing my lunch

&gt; Be a recovering anorexic from a medical issue, thoroughly enjoying being able to eat a decent amount of food

&gt; Good ol' Aussie meat pie

&gt; See O'DingDong eyeing my nutrition source

&gt; ""Ugh, if you keep eating things like that, you're going to loose your physique""

&gt; I half grunt at her, knowing that she liked to think of herself as the school bully. 

&gt; IDGAF about your opinions, bitch

&gt; ""Ya know, some people are meant to be skinny, some are meant to be curvy! This is why I can eat so much and still have boys like me""

&gt; ""Meh. I don't really care too much. I just want to be able to concentrate in next period""

&gt; Continue munching down on my delicious pie, ignoring any attempts by O'DingDong to strike up conversation

&gt; Long silence passes

&gt; I'm talking 15min or so

&gt; ""UGH. I can't believe you didn't even offer me any!""

&gt; ""Any of what?""

&gt; ""That pie""

&gt; ""I bought it, why should have I given you any?""

&gt; ""Because you're meant to be skinny, and I'm meant to be curvy!""

&gt; bertstare.gif

There is still about 30min of lunch left (full lunch hour FTW), and I'm getting sick of sitting near this idiot. A little more back ground on the whole situation. Our school had a no bulling program that all the students knew she abused to such an extent that she could bully anyone, and anyone caught fighting back verbally or physically was suspended. This is why I hadn't released my usually barrage at her.

Even 'social isolation' was classified as bullying, so I made sure teachers saw me sitting with her, so she couldn't accuse me of it as I began to pack my bag and walk away.

&gt; Scoot up off the ground with a slight jump

&gt; Slide down the gully to jump over a creek to go to the library for some air conditioned reading

&gt; I fucking love rural schools

&gt; ""Hey! Wait for me!"" O'DingDong wails

&gt; Genuinely seems upset that I'm leaving

&gt; Good

&gt; Oh shitting dick balls, a teacher is taking notice

&gt; Realize I have to pretend to not want to run in the opposite direction

&gt; Stand there silently, just waiting for her to get up and get to where I am

&gt; Honestly a deep gully, with a steep 5 meter wide bank, covered in rocks

&gt; Longest 10min of my life pass

&gt; End up at the library after a small walk, with her constantly complaining about the school

&gt; ""This place is so backward. I wish I could attend a GOOD school in the city, where it's easier to walk around. Some even have scooters!""

&gt; Beginning of the end...

I managed to make it through the class without fainting, and avoided O'DingDong until the next, depressing day. By this time in my life, I had met my current SO, and had become close friends with him. He had just run away from home and was living in a caravan park, and staying at the private school on a full scholarship. For the purposes of this story, I shall call him Yak.

&gt; Yak at school, along with my other friend who I mentioned earlier. Sitting in the shade of the gum tree over the gully

&gt; Dead certain that O'DingDong wouldn't come over, as it was 38C outside

&gt; Take off our shoes and enjoy the cool creek

&gt; Playing around, when again, our fears of drop bears is piqued

&gt; Turn around, to see O'DingDong, with eyeliner streaming down her face, purely from sweat

&gt; ""Heeeeeeey Yak! I didn't see you yesterday!""

&gt; We kind of look at her, nod, and continue to play

&gt; ""Come up here guizzzzze! I want someone to talk to. You know my thyroid will play up if I become active""

&gt; Never actually heard of a thyroid, so this gem of fatty logic passed me by

&gt; Yak realises he has to go to music practice, gives my friend and I a hug goodbye, and begins to back up his bags

&gt; ""Hey, where is myyyyy hug?""

&gt; He looks mournfully up at her cottage cheese arms

&gt; Told me later he would rather take a shotgun to the face

&gt; Like the cheeky bugger he is, he bolts off to the music block, leaving my friend and I laughing our asses off

&gt; O'DingDong starts to sniffle

&gt; Friend and I rush up to her, to prevent her from claiming bullying against Yak. He would loose his scholarship if she claimed anything to do with bullying

&gt; ""Oh thanks gurrrlz. It's ok. I know he really does like me. I saw him checking out girls with REAL curves""

&gt; Stifle my laughter, know Yak's schooling depends on it

&gt; ""Yeah, he really does like me. He hugged me once. His arms were just sooo strong. I even have him on MSN""

&gt; Once we are sure she is calm, we realise we have to break the news to her

&gt; ""O'Dingdong, I don't meant to be rude, but Yak asked me out recently. We're dating now.""

&gt; jesustakethewheel.help

&gt; ""WHAT?! HOW DARE YOU SEDUCE HIM. YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKING BULLY!! YOU KNEW HE WAS MINE. HE LIKED ME BEFORE HE EVEN LOOKED AT YOU. I DESERVE HIM, NOT YOU. YOU BETTER BREAK UP WITH HIM!""

&gt; ""I'M GOING TO REPORT BOTH OF YOU. I KNOW I CAN GET YAK EXPELLED. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT""

&gt; She runs off, as much as a fatty can run

&gt; Realize I would be the one in trouble

&gt; Don't give a fuck at this point, begin to laugh

&gt; She tries to run faster, and ends up tripping down the gully into the creek

&gt; Don't hear from anyone for the rest of the lunch hour

Now, if you're thinking at this point that I'm the bully, please don't be mistaken. She had abused the system so much that she could get into full on fist fights without being in trouble. I felt I had to end her fatty entitlement there and then (mostly because she used her weight as a 'discrimination' point).

&gt; Next period starts

&gt; Pulled out of class, off to the principle!

&gt; By now, he has caught onto what she is doing, but can't change the policy due to the P&amp;C group

&gt; ""Tangerine, O'DingDong has made some accusations about you. I'm sure you're aware of the situation. Tell me what happened.""

&gt; Recount the story

&gt; Mention Yak felt uncomfortable by her sexual advances

&gt; Mention her remarks on my widely known anorexia

&gt; Ha, bitch, my medical based weight trumps yours!

&gt; Principle actually becomes concerned at this point

&gt; Another girl died two years before from anorexia due to bullying

&gt; Finally recount part of where she demanded I break up with Yak, and the threats of false accusations

&gt; Principle writes down some notes and lets me get back to class

&gt; First person to not be immediately suspended from a bullying claim in 12 months

Epilouge: She ended up having an 'investigation' done on her previous claims of bullying, and the school found them to all be bullshit. She ended up being given a semesters worth of lunch time detentions, as so many kids had been suspended on her account. They figured it would be better to keep her there, than let her stay at home.

Looking back on it now, I am more outraged by her assumptions regarding my underweight now, than I was back then. I think it was just something that passed me by.
Every now and then, I'll still get a message from her, saying that she still deserves Yak, and that I am a terrible person. My most recent one was from 4 months ago. It always makes me giggle, considering we're getting married at the end of the year.

1368132241.0	1e0we5	This fat bitch in my class right now	None4GretchenWieners	618	173	233	"GUISE, seriously guise, HELP. This just happened like 15 minutes ago. Someone come get me out of class... Just come running in screaming “GLENN COCO!” or something, I am seriously pissed off at this bitch.

Be me, chillin in my Abnormal Psych classroom, waiting for class to start. Be sipping on a triple espresso because I'm tired as hell. Teachbro asks what my poison was, and I tell him. He asks if it has any milk or sugar, and I say no, I always drink it plain. [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/XPc58.png) he says he likes plain coffee as well. Cue Hamjonae, a morbidly obese girl in my class who TIL talks like she's from the ghetto.

Hamjonae: “Gurrrrrrrrl yew need sum shuga in dat shiz! How cun yew drink dat bitta azz shiz without sweetenin it up?”

Me: “I really like the taste of espresso, especially when the beans haven't been burnt to hell. The cafe right next to the cafeteria has delicious coffee.”

Hamjonae: “Kay, but yew shud still put some shuga an melk in it so you dun lose weight and become unhealthy! Erryone knows caffeine makes ya lose weight!”

Me: “Why are you so concerned about my weight? Mind your own business.”

Hamjonae: “But yull neva get a boyfrand if you lose weight! Men dun like anorexic bitches!”

Me: “Look, Hamjonae, I am sick of people acting like my weight is their business, so just shut up already. I'm not going to be nice about it anymore. I have never said one single word to you about your weight, so what the fuck gives you the right to talk about mine?”

Hamjonae is now looking like she has been kicked in the teeth and I am sitting here typing this up and shaking from anger.

TL;DR Don't fucking talk about my weight unless you want me to talk about yours.

UPDATE: We took a break in class and I overheard Teachbro telling Hamjonae he's dropping her from the class. Apparently this is the third time she's harassed some poor girl about their weight, and he has warned her to leave people alone about their weight, and three strikes you're out. Hamjonae is now sulking outside the classroom and my jimmies have returned to a calm, peaceful state.

EDIT because some people apparently didn't understand I am taking an Abnormal Psychology class. Fucking have to spell every goddamn thing out for some people."	t5_2vzax	True

Here is another Hamgar story, just the epic finale after this one.  Enjoy.

&gt;Be just over half way through the semester, just had mid terms

&gt;Be about an hour into class

&gt;Hamgar had already gone through 1 container of cookies (for once not family sized though) and had made a large dent in his first 3 liter

&gt;Professor is in the middle of lecturing the spinal chord when the door opens and a guy from the local pizza place walks in

&gt;""Pizza for Hamgar""

&gt;Think this is the first time in my life my jaw has actually dropped

&gt;Mother fucker ordered pizza and had it brought to a class...during the class

&gt;""Right here"" Hamgar shifts in his seat, causing it to moan and creak perilously

&gt;The pizza dude opens the bag and one of the foulest smells that has ever come from food filled the room

&gt;Dear jesus christ and bacon, wtf is on those pizzas?

&gt;In total Hamgar order 4 large pizzas and 2 calzones and an undetermined number of bread sticks

&gt;While he is paying pizza guy asks if we are having a party 

&gt;""Nope"" Hamgar said, no hint of shame in his voice

&gt;Pizza guy looks disturbed, glances around the room and makes eye contact with me

&gt;Just shake my head

&gt;Pizza guy grasps what is about to happen and flees as anything within arms reach of a hamplanet is considered food when they go into hunger mode

&gt;Some people are actually choking on the smell of the pizza

&gt;Smell is so bad professor stops class and asks Hamgar what is on the pizza

&gt;Can't remember exact toppings, but it was pretty much the worst shit you can get, remember anchovies, garlic, onions, sardines being just a few of the things he rattled off

&gt;Some students start to leave the room, gagging and heaving at the smell

&gt;Never knew food could smell so bad, wtf

&gt;Professor tell Hamgar to take the pizza outside,its too distracting for the other students

&gt;Hamgar starts on about his beetus-thyroid-hypoglycemia

&gt;Prof finds some sack somewhere and puts his foot down, says he has been lenient the entire semester, but he won't allow him to eat that shit in his class 

&gt;Hamgar eventually relents (most likely to get back to stuffing his face in a timely manner) and goes outside with his grease feast

&gt;Smell begins to fade but still lingers

&gt;Back to learnin'

&gt;About 10 minutes later the door opens and Hamgar comes walking back in

&gt;He couldn't have finished all that food in that amount of time

&gt;Yes he did, smell of death pizza returns to room along with Hamgar

&gt;Don't know if its on his breathe or if he finally ingested so much food its finally leaking out his pores, but damn it reeked

&gt;While the smell was terrible, at least Hamgar was quiet (as quiet as a hippo can be) when he came back in

&gt;To make up for the courtesy he exhibited, Hamgar opened up a fresh 3 liter and sucked that beetus juice down so quick the bottle looked like it just deflated (cause pizza eating works up a mighty thirst)

&gt;Prof waits till the noise stops before he continues his lecture

&gt;Just as he starts to speak against Hamgar lets out with a burp so loud it puts Krakatoa to shame

&gt;Am glad I was sitting far to the left of Hamgar as I'm fairly sure the people sitting in the rows directly in front of him got a fine misting of soda and saliva from the mouth explosion 

&gt;Can see the rage in prof's eyes, pray for explosion of righteous fury that never comes

&gt;Rest of the class passes with out incident

&gt;Leave room and see pile of pizza boxes sticking out of trash can

&gt;He really did eat all that food in roughly 10 minutes

&gt;May god have mercy on the resources of this planet with people like Hamgar trying to fit as many of them down his gullet as possible

1373594598.0	1i4j6k	"""Your poor child..."""	mommyoffour	523	81	76	"So, I was on the phone with a good friend today (no unread FPS so time to socialize), when I found my own, real life FPS!!!  My best friend called to talk about the craziest conversation that she had with her sister the day before.  As soon as she told me, I knew you lovely people would enjoy... all I could think was green text here we come!

&gt;Be my friend... FitMom... FitMom is in her mid thirties and a single mother.  She exercises and makes sure both her and her son eat healthy foods... pretty normal mom.  She lives on the West Coast with her son.

&gt;Don't be FitMom's sister... HamSis.  HamSis is heavy (she is only 4'9"" so she also doesn't carry it well), and lives in the midwest where, she says, she isn't ""too fat compared to everyone else"".  The sister's don't see each other that often.

This is how the call went according to FitMom.

&gt;HamSis: Your poor child...

&gt;Fitmom: FitKid?  What's wrong with FitKid?

&gt;HamSis: You are messing him up so much.

&gt;Fitmom: How?

&gt;HamSis: Giving him a terrible impression of women.  He sees you and thinks women should be just *so* thin.  When he grows up he is going to be so confused and not realize what *real* women look like.

&gt;Fitmom: Wait?  What?

&gt;HamSis: Well, FitMom, he sees you all the time.  You are his role model.  When he gets older and starts dating he is going to expect other women to be thin like you.  He isn't going to be able to find a *real* woman because he will only be looking at the thin women.  He is going to become judgmental too.

&gt;Fitmom: But he's not at all judgmental!

&gt;HamSis: Well, he will be.  Especially since a lot of your friends are thin too.  You have to consider the impression you are setting for him.  Poor FitKid.

Anyway, my friend was actually speechless at first, but the conversation devolved after that.  

HamSis kept insisting FitMom was setting a terrible impression for her son.  

One of my favorite comments was when HamSis told FitMom that if FitMom was thin, and HamSis wasn't, it must be because FitMom isn't eating right.... after all weight is all about genetics.

**TL;DR** - Poor FitKid isn't going to be able to find a *real* woman because his mother is thin and has given him a terrible impression of what women look like.


**EDIT:** Just wanted to tell you guys I talked to FitMom today and read her some of your comments.  She was pretty happy to get some validation - even if it was from internet strangers!  Thanks for the fun comments.  She appreciated it.  I think it cheered her up a bit.  No one likes her sister calling her a bad mom - even if its a HamSis."	t5_2vzax	True
1371746292.0	1gqhwd	The Battle of Scooter Station	murder_cheeze	509	64	32	"This is Oklahoma, so there are no exaggerations in the quotes.

&gt;Walking into store. 

&gt;See man dropped off at door by woman. Woman drives off.

&gt;This man is Bad Luck Jerome (BLJ). BLJ is maybe 45 years old, about 5' 9"", and all of 180 lbs. 

&gt;BLJ looked well, except for his cane and the leg he was practically dragging.

&gt;We entered as BLJ settled into the last powered scooter and drove into the store a bit. 

&gt;Commence the Battle of Scooter Station.

&gt;Behind us, we hear something. Sounds like lion loudly gutting zebra, making moist smacking and rhythmic grunts.

&gt;I turn to see monstrosity of human going to town on fist-sized wad of gum.

&gt;All 5'2"" and 400 pounds of ""woman"" moved past us at speeds which must have rendered her leg joints to powder. Enter Big APE (ankle-powder enthusiast).

&gt;Big APE waddles directly to BLJ. 

&gt;Big APE who then cuts a huge fart past her brown teeth, which eerily resembled the following phrase: ""YUH WUSN'T GONNA GIT FAR ENNYWEE. GIBB ME DUH SCOOTER."" 

&gt;BLJ: ""Excuse me?"" 

&gt;Big APE: ""AHH KNOW YUH TOOK IT 'CUZ YUH SAWL ME COMIN'. THE GAME IS OVER. GIBB ME DUH SCOOTER.""

&gt;Poor BLJ is puzzled: ""I'm sorry, but I had a stroke. I can't use my right leg anymore."" 

&gt;Big APE: ""I'M GETTIN' A DAMN MENEGER.""

BLJ's nice wife (NW) walks in from parking the car as the big-assed assistant manager (BAAM) approaches with Big APE. BLJ tries to ignore and drive off.

&gt;BAAM: ""Sir! I need you to come back! I just heard the WHOOOLE story, and if you don't get off the scooter, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

&gt;NW: ""What's goin-""

&gt;BLJ: ""I've got this, honey. She doesn't believe I had a st-""

&gt;BAAM: ""I JUST. SAID. SIR. I ALREADY HEARD THE STORY. GET OFF THE SCOOTER OR I'M CALLING SECURITY.""

My awesome sister (AS) and I then stepped up.

&gt;Me: ""Bullshit! We saw the whole thing. Not only was BLJ there first, but what makes a scooter necessary for Big APE? Being fat? He had a stroke, you got fat. Does not compute.""

&gt;Big APE: ""AH HAS A GLANDULAR PROBLEM! BUT YOUSE NOT SMART ENO-""

&gt;Me: ""Then that's the fattest fucking gland I have ever seen!""

AS leaves to get REAL manager (RM). It's awkwardly silent while we wait, except for Big APE and BAAM, who obviously know each other pretty well.

&gt;BAAM: ""BIG APE HERE WA-""

&gt;Me: ""No ma'am, you've bungled this enough.""

I go on to explain what happened. 4-vs-2. Manager openly criticizes BAAM for screwing it up so badly, when I referred to her as an ""assistant manager"" while pointing out that they are obviously friends. RM tells now-crying BAAM, who is actually just a regular worker, to clock out and meet him in the staff lounge.

Awesomeness ensued as we watched Big APE crumple further into her sweat pants. We walked off, but saw her later demolishing the cookie aisle."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Cheetos, gummies, chocolate, basically everything NOT to eat before a meet

&gt;whatevs we have another day before events

&gt;RISKING IT

&gt;coaches decided not to fight this battle

&gt;start a game invented by one of my friends

&gt;basically a shitty teenage version of tarot cards

&gt;of course we love it

&gt;start up first round

&gt;good time had by all

&gt;no one notices approaching mass

&gt;not until its too late

&gt;Bertha lunges over the top of a ferry seat

&gt;gets paunch stuck on rim of seat top

&gt;parkour attempt fails horribly

&gt;everyone watched in horror as she falls into the row

&gt;mass evacuation

&gt;snacks, magazines, cards, and bags all snatched away in the nick of time

&gt;Bertha lands solidly on one of the divers

&gt;diver barely manages to escape

&gt;eats shit on one of the chairs before bolting off in panic

&gt;Bertha gets jammed between the seats

&gt;wailing like a stuck pig

&gt;note that no one has any fucking idea what just happened

&gt;Bertha starts moaning for us to help her

&gt;everyone sitting and staring

&gt;what the actual fuck

&gt;more wailing

&gt;other ferry goers glaring at us intently

&gt;Bertha starts berating us for not helping

&gt;everyone completely stunned and unsure of how to proceed

&gt;start tentatively pulling her stubby limbs

&gt;Coaches storm in ready to murder us all

&gt;boys following sheepishly

&gt;catch sight of Bertha

&gt;what the actual fuck is going on here

&gt;two oldest and biggest boys manage to unstick Bertha with some good ole' elbow grease

&gt;probably helped she was sweaty as fuck by now

&gt;coach faces are bright scarlet

&gt;tell us in low voices to get our asses up to the top deck (solarium)

&gt;we're up there before they finish

&gt;dive coach is talking to diver girl who got smashed, looks like her back got hurt

&gt;dive coach about ready to cut a bitch

&gt;whole team gets rounded up into a big circle

&gt;dead silence

&gt;coach asks what the hell just happened

&gt;everyone stares at me, as captain

&gt;explain that we were just eating and playing games, didn't see it coming

&gt;Bertha interrupts

&gt;says we were... Wait for it..... BULLYING HER

&gt;allofmywhat

&gt;continue talking, say we hadn't seen her and weren't bullying her or anything

&gt;Bertha interrupts again

&gt;says we were purposefully excluding her from games

&gt;says we didn't share our food

&gt;says we purposefully sat so she wouldn't fit anywhere

&gt;all girls confused as fuck

&gt;thought she was in her room with papa whale

&gt;hadn't seen her before the incident

&gt;coaches notice mass confusion

&gt;try to be diplomatic

&gt;Bertha, are you telling the truth?

&gt;YES AH AM THEY'RE AHHLLL LIAHS

&gt;girls shaking their heads, boys giggling discreetly

&gt;Did you ask to sit with them before trying to climb over the seat?

&gt;NUUHHHHH THERE WASN'T ANNEH ROOM

&gt;THEY WANTEHD TO LEAVE MEH OUT

&gt;maybe they would've made room?

&gt;I speak up again

&gt;Bertha never asked us to move, we would've if she had

&gt;coaches stare at Bertha

&gt;other girls nod in assent

&gt;NUH THAT'S A LIIIIIIIIIE

&gt;THEY'RE MEAN CUZ AHM DIFFERUNT

&gt;coaches are totally done with conversation

&gt;tell Bertha she can sit with us

&gt;why the hell won't she just take a seat

&gt;keeps walking up and down row

&gt;starts wailing again

&gt;ofw it turns out she can't fit in the fucking row anyway due to sheer girth

TL;DR: shitty swimmer and certified lardass Bertha gets stuck trying to climb in between ferry seats, berates everyone for bullying her, tells girls to let her sit with us, turns out she can't fit anyway

1367592149.0	1dmd1a	No tale from the Breadstick Garden today. Today I bring you the haunting tale of Biggums, and how I am now obligated to cut off my own face.	blackshirtmartyr	536	95	78	"I'm still in shock fps. I have had a few good days for awhile at BG, still planets of course, but of the jolly or easy going variety. Nothing to report, no fattylogic and no jimmy rustling. I warn you that this story may rustle jimmies, it may not, but you will leave hat in hand mourning for your OP.

&gt;Don't pray for me I'm already dead.

&gt;Be me

&gt;Skinny as fuck (relevant later)

&gt;Distinct lack of curves up top

&gt;But the gods are kind, I got a booty

&gt;Friends want to go to rave

&gt;Check that this isnt 1995

&gt;Nope, but they still want to go

&gt;ok.jpg

So at this point, I will break to describe my friends. First off, we aren't rave people. We are board game people, I'm not sure how this came about. But tonight, my friends were excited to go to a club, so to the club I go. Theres me of course, my roommate and best friend who we will call Blondie, my bf and Blondies older brother Stretch (he's 6'7, hence name) and his friend Chuckles. Not sure if Chuckles is always high, or just generally amused at life, but this guy is always laughing. Anyways.

&gt;Get dressed

&gt;Black sheath dress

&gt;lookingood.png

&gt;Stop at dollar store, but lots of glowing accessories

&gt;We got dis.

 We make it to the club and theres no line outside. Simultaneously awesome and troubling. 

&gt;Struttin inside

&gt;Bros be mirnin

&gt;Stretch always attracts attention to himself, being a fucking giant and all.

&gt;He also has long hair, in a pony tail. Lady love to ask to touch dat tail

&gt;Aint gon drive my car, but you can sit in the front seat 

&gt;We stop at the bar to open a tab

&gt;Hear a barn owl screech over the untss, untss

&gt;Owls dont belong in the clurb

&gt;Wait thats not a barn owl, thats a (loose interpretation of a) girl!

&gt;And shes coming right at us.

&gt;Biggums approaches, bearing God's ire


Breaking from green to describe Biggums, but first the club. Is a pretty nice place, short dresses, high heels, everyone has glow and glitter going on, but overall looks to be a pretty classy place. Music is actually pretty cool, everyone having a good time. 

Now Biggums. Biggums looks like she was dressed by someone trying to do a satire piece on teen rave culture. She's about 5'2, 250, high up short pigtails, now plastered in sweat. Hair is a nasty dishwater blonde fading to box pink. Has on maybe 8 necklaces made of glowing pony beads, probably 20 bracelets of the same. Skirt on her is the width of my hand. But the worst, absolute most revolting piece of her attire was the tanktop. Hello Kitty. White. Probably size medium. Stretched over stomach tight enough so i can see every roll and the cavern of her bellybutton. And the centerpiece of this unholy masterpiece, she had cut down the middle of the collar to reveal her rather large, floppy boobs. Out of place like a vegetable on a fatties plate. Back to reality.

&gt;Oop, there goes gravity

&gt;Biggums approacheth. 

&gt;Calculate her trajectory

&gt;Headed towards Stretch!

&gt;No time to warn him.

""OHHHH MY GODDDD! I LOVE YOUR HAIRRRRRR!!!"" 

&gt;Stretch is a little slut for attention

&gt;He makes the biggest mistake of the night

&gt;wink.exe

&gt;Something registers on her face. 

&gt;eyes droop down into bedroom mode

&gt;sidles up to Stretch

&gt;she asks his name breathily, like seven Jackie Os at once

&gt;situation not lost on Chuckles, who does what he do best.

&gt;Blondie being a true ride or die is now alternating between glaring at her and giving me ""Well?"" eyebrows

&gt;I decide to play it cool.

&gt;Stretch introduces himself, Chuckles, Blondie and myself. 

&gt;As soon as Biggums hears the word ""girlfriend"" her face darkens

&gt;She looks at me, her piggy eyes narrowing

&gt;She otherwise ignores me. For now.

So after that, we all started off to the dance floor, including Biggums. She seemed to be attached to Stretch now, laughing and talking with him and attempting to exclude me out of conversation. A little while passes with everyone sort of dispersing and meeting new people and I grab a dance with Stretch. Shit gets real.

&gt;Biggums begins ""raving""

&gt;wildly flinging arms around with glowsticks, her face contorted in concentration 

&gt;endurance only lasts about 45 seconds before severely out of breath

&gt;Comes up to Stretch, back to me.

""Streeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetch, can you take me to sit down? I'm feeling light headeddddddddd."" 

&gt;Stretch looks at me, alarmed. 

&gt;I dont know what to do either, we are both too socially awkward to outright deny her.

&gt;I make the biggest mistake of the night

&gt;I say go ahead, and go to dance with Chuckles.

&gt;She looks back at me

&gt;Smug.exe

So Stretch takes Biggums to the side area where there couches were at and she sprawls across the couch. He stands awkwardly. I decided I would go dance and not worry, so ladies and gentlemen, Stretch himself will be accounting first hand what I did not experience. 

&gt;I dont understand how to format this

&gt;Black shirt is helping

&gt;Enter enter

&gt;There isnt much to tell yet but pretty much she made pass after pass

&gt;She laid down across the couch and all of a sudden was ""drunk"" lol

&gt;She told me to come sit down and lifted up her legs so i could. I didnt sit down.

&gt;Biggums decided to start a real talk about my girlfriend and how she was so thin and asked if she had an eating disorder or something

&gt;I told her that my girlfriend runs and thats all (Which is true Black shirt eats like a wolverine) 

Excuse me?

&gt;She laughed and said she was bi but she only likes girls with tits and asses and stuff and that Black Shirt had nothing in her dress but bones. She grabbed my hand (I was still standing up) and tried to place it on her girnormo boob to ""feel how fast her heart was beating"" and I decided to nope the fuck out back to my friends. 

Back to me now. Little did Stretch know, she had followed him with surprising swiftness for a planet. She was in full on bitch mode now, and ready for an animal planet style showdown. Stretch joins us at the table and chairs we snagged, with Biggums in tow. He sits by me, and she is left standing. Maybe this will be enough to get her to leave.

&gt;So Blackshirt, Stretch and I were talking about you! teehee I was telling him how I like girls too but only ones with a little figure to them right?

Nope.


&gt;She squeezes my arm and laughs

&gt;ohfuckno.jpg

&gt;Blondie isnt having any of her shit, and tells her so.

&gt;""Stretch likes thin girls, he always has."" 

&gt;He agrees 

&gt;Biggums brushes this off and says that ""men like a girl with a GIRL body, like breasts and thighs and an ass. Men likes (wait for it) curves.""

&gt;Stretch says he likes small boobs because theyre perkier and prettier

&gt;Chuckles chuckles.

&gt;Biggums gets flustered 

&gt;Blondie sippin on rum and coke, on the alert now.

&gt;Biggums turns to Stretch and says ""If youve never been with a REAL woman before, how do you know what its like? Ive been with skinny girls and curvy girls I'm telling you THIS (she mashes her chest hams together) is SO much more fun to play with!"" 

&gt;Stretch appears to be getting queasy.

&gt;She turns to me

&gt;""I bet youve never even gotten to feel big tits""

&gt;Cant say that I have

&gt;She reaches out

&gt;What

&gt;Oh god no

&gt;She puts her chubby hand on the back of my head

&gt;I am now looking at her stretchmarked and pocked under arm dingle dangle 

&gt;Her armpit appears to have heat rash

&gt;Everything happening in slow motion

&gt;""Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeee""

&gt;She pushes

&gt;my face

&gt;into

&gt;Her

&gt;boobs.

They were sweaty. They were cold, somehow. Cold, wet flesh. My face was pushed into her chest and she wiggled her shoulders to get me even deeper between. It smelled like yeast and BO. 

&gt;scream.exe

&gt;scream.exe

&gt;scream.exe

Stretch stands up, has had enough, pulls me out of her. Tells her not to fucking touch me. She begins to get defensive. 

&gt;""WHAT ARE YOU SOME KINDA FUCKIN FAGGOT?""

&gt;Bad move

&gt;Several people turn to look at her

&gt;My face is actually wet and smells like her. 

&gt;I am about to cry, Blondie grabs me and we go to the bathroom.

&gt;I wash my face, trying not to mess up my makeup while also trying to get the death stench off my face.

Stretch is waiting outside the bathroom door and we ride home troubled and disgusted. After Stretch and I got home, we immediately showered, but the sad fact is I have no choice other than to cut off my own face and burn it. So I may not be writing FPS anymore. 


(But somehow I think Ill be back)

[More Tales from the Rat Cellar](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1aokun/more_tales_from_the_rat_cellar/)


And now for the finale:


&gt; be me, back from my first year of college.

&gt; meet up with the old crew, chitchat about our year and such.

&gt; gossip ensues.

&gt; Apparently Beretta had a baby.

&gt; Named it Berettalyn. Seriously.

&gt; No one has seen her, just news through the grapevine.

&gt; Well that's nice for her I guess if she's happy, I'm happy.

&gt; Few days later, at the only grocery store.

&gt; Getting stuff for a BBQ, minding my own business, grabbing whatever I want.

&gt; Suddenly I hear ""Hey, HHG, is that youuuu?""

&gt; Oh hey, it's a Beretta, plus about another 100lbs of what I'm assuming we're going to label 'baby weight'.

&gt; Realize she is now the spitting image of Mama Behemoth a few stories ago.

&gt; Be polite, let her catch up to me with her cart.

&gt; Notice it has nothing but neon colored pre-packaged food and cheap beer.

&gt; I heard you had a baby, Beretta! Congratulations.

&gt; Her face falls. 

&gt; ""Nah, well, yeah. Bo decided to leave after a few months, he got laid off from the boat factory because they said he took lunches that were too long, and he was real upset started drinking, and said he couldn't stay with me anymore.""

&gt; Sorry to hear that. Plenty of fish in the sea and all that.

&gt; ""Yeah, I guess. Then after he moved out, he got mad said I wasn't taken care of Berettalyn. Wasn't the truth, I was feedin her and stuff. After I had the baby it was hard for me to get around and he didn't help me at all. Just sat around and drank all day when he was around. Didn't get any better after he left.""

&gt; Oh where is the conversation going...

&gt; ""I had to have a C-section, the doctor said it was safer because he said I was overweight. Then after the baby it got really infected and I couldn't walk very well. I don't think it ever healed right. My stomach kind of hung over where they cut me, and I think it rubbed the wrong way. I'm sure it happens to everyone. Anyway, I was on bed rest so I never lost any of my baby weight, not that I gained that much. So it was just me and the baby after Bo left.

&gt; .....I've never understood why women insist on sharing their birthing stories.

&gt; ""Family services you know, said my drinking was a problem, said I wasn't feedin her right, said she was dirty. I just took care of her the way my Mom told me how. We aren't city-folk, the lady didn't understand that. A little bit of drinking never hurt anyone, right? She was just a baby, she didn't need to be fed as often as me or you. Those clerks always tried to argue with me when I tried to spend my WIC money on real food instead of formula or whatever that nasty powder was they wanted me to give her.""

&gt; My face is frozen in a permi-smile because I literally have no idea how to react.

&gt; Beretta sighs, leaning against her cart. ""Berettalyn lives with her daddy's parents now. They live upstate, in the city. I can't see her right now, but neither can him. I made sure of that. Said I thought he was touching her.""

&gt; Pauses to wink at me and push the hair out of her eyes.

&gt; ""I can always have more kids, I guess. I just turned 21, I'm still young.""

&gt; I nod hesitantly.

&gt; ""We should go hit a bar up sometime. Get ourselves some men.""

&gt; Sorry Beretta, I'm only 19 I still don't drink.

&gt; ""You were always too uptight. You always were so organized, had routines, ran things. That's no way to live life. I'm spontaneous!""

&gt; It's working out for me, thanks though. It's been nice catching up but I have to go now.

&gt; ""Hey, HHG, can I ask you something?""

&gt; Yes?

&gt; ""Can I have the brownie mix you have in your cart? I really don't want to walk back across the store to the baking section. Ever since I had my baby I get tired out real easily.""

&gt; Beta till the end, I hand over my brownie mix and go back to get another, without seeing Beretta again before I finished shopping.




&gt; be me, 22, haven't heard anything about Beretta or Berettalyn since that day in the grocery store.

&gt; Sadly, not all of us make it.

TL;DR Mildly annoying hamplanet turned vengeful hamplanet, turned Mama Hamplanet loses her baby due to her drinking and not know how to care for her baby, she continues her lifestyle seemingly undisturbed by the loss of her baby. Oh, she also accuses her ex of touching her inappropriately which is something that is reprehensible.

Gather 'round the doughnut box, and get your jimmies ready for a good rustling, because this is going to be goooooooood:

&gt; Me be Land Whale Linda's (not real name) sister and reluctant 
&gt; bridesmaid. 

&gt; Linda be 5'6, 350 lbs LandWhale and bridezilla from hell. 

**Part One - Dress Shopping**
&gt; It be sunny. It be warm. It be Saturday. But instead of enjoying it, I'm &gt; wedding dress shopping with my sister. 

&gt; KillMeNow.waaaaaaav

&gt; Store clerk be...concerned. Trying to find a ""flattering"" dress for Linda.

&gt; Linda's response to all of them: ""Wut? These dresses are too 

&gt; conservative. I wanna show off meh cuuuurves on meh big day!""

&gt; CollectiveCringe.jaypeg

&gt; She starts to get mad. Sweat and grease start beading on her 

&gt; forehead. ""Yeh have no idea what I want! Yeh jus' want meh to be 

&gt; frumpeh on meh big day!"" 

&gt; Pushes past everyone and starts looking at the rack of skimpy XS 
&gt; numbers. 

&gt; OhGod.gif

&gt; ""Dis!"" She waves a dress triumphantly in front of the clerk. ""Dis is da 
&gt; one! I love de purls!""

&gt; AwkwardSilence.wav

&gt; Store clerk: ""Ma'am, that dress...it isn't made in your size. We don't 
&gt; even have one in a suitable size for you to try on...""

&gt; ""DIS IS MY DRESS! I LIKE DE PURLS! MAKE IT HAPPEN!"" 

&gt; eyeroll.png

&gt; Clerk: ""But...I can't let you buy a dress without at least trying it on! 
&gt; Why not pick something from...something...over..."" 

&gt; Clerk gets Linda's killer whale look. 

&gt; ""Meh sisteh will try it on for meh, if that's what it will take! It's meh 
&gt; dress! I like de purls. They're deli-cat and they'll show off meh curves!"" 

&gt; OhHellNo.gif

&gt; LeaveMeOuttaThis.jpg


To fast forward this a bit: I try on the dress and realize why the clerk was trying to steer her towards something else. The dress is strapless, has a low scoop cut in the back (sorry, don't know fashion terms) and strings of pearls lacing back and forth. Linda wants to buy a strapless open-back dress! It will look terrible on her! But it's her day and she's insisting so...I try on the dress in my size, which is the biggest size they have in that style (10). I'm not thin, but my weight isn't crazy either, so the dress looks...meh but not awful.

&gt; Linda: ""OMG! I LURVE IT! MEH DRESS! THIS IS IT! MEH DRESS!!!"" 

&gt; Clerk: ""But I think...""

&gt; Me: ""Linda...You should really consider...""

&gt; Linda: ""FUCK YOU SKINNY BITCHES! I WON'T LET YEH TELL ME WHAT &gt; TEH WEAR! THIS IS *MEH* DAY AND *MEH* CHOICE! I WILL LOOK 
&gt; GORGEOUS! Y'ALL JUS' JEALOUS OF MEH CURVES!"" 

&gt; Clerk and I exchange resigned looks. It is *her* day and *her* choice.

&gt; Clerk: ""Yes ma'am...I'll get the measuring tape.""


Clerk spends forever taking Linda's measurements, consults with the seamstress on duty, induces more yelling from Linda, and finally rings up the bill: $10,000. 
&gt; WTF.GIF

&gt; AreYouOutOfYourMind.wav

&gt; Facepalm.jpg


Linda goes to many fittings, yells at the staff a lot and insists the only problem is that people don't want her to look good. The seamstress and clerk call suppliers, have strategic planning meetings, move mountains and pray multiple times a day. Finally, the ""deli-cat purl dress"" is successfully supersized. Linda is ecstatic. Everyone in the family, including the groom, cringe and walk on eggshells whenever The Dress is brought up in conversation, which is often.

Fast forward to...

**Part 2 - The Wedding**

&gt; Linda be excited! It's her day at last! 

&gt; Family puts aside dress drama. Get excited. 

&gt; ItsAWedding.squee

&gt; The ceremonies be underway. 

&gt; Guests be cringing at the sight of the rolls of fat rippling down Linda's &gt; back, punctuated by rows of poor desperate trapped pearls.

&gt; Ceremony be catholic. Priest gets bride and groom to kneel for 
&gt; communion. 

&gt; Linda kneels on her skirt. The bodice fabric pulls extra taught. Fat 
&gt; bulges out, swallowing the poor pearls whole.

&gt; LookAway.gif

&gt; Focus on prayer instead. Yes, prayer!
&gt; I shut my eyes and then I hear a strange sound:

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; Huh.jpg

&gt; I open my eyes in time to see the third string of pearls give way.

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; The fabric at the front starts to sag. Linda starts hanging on for dear 
&gt; life. 

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; The priest, keeps his eyes glued on the prayer book. Keeps going.

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; WhatTheFuckDoWeDo.help

&gt; There are only a couple of strands left. Linda's situation is...precarious.

&gt; Linda starts crying. Her shoulders quivering, fat a-quaking. 

&gt; Everyone in the room, except the priest and groom, watch on in
&gt; horror. No one dares breathe. No one moves. 

&gt; The priest keeps reading...

&gt; CalmBeforeTheStorm.exe

&gt; Linda gasps for air between sobs. And it is just too much for those 
&gt; pearls.

&gt; Snap! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; Fat rolls free! Boobs go flying!

&gt; Linda: ""Meh dress!!!!!""

&gt; Priest: ""GOOD GOD, WOMAN! COVER YOURSELF UP!!"" 

&gt; Priest turns away quickly. Audience turns away quickly. 

&gt; New hubby, who should be made a saint, whips off his jacket to cover
&gt; his blushing bride. 

&gt; It barely goes over her shoulders.

&gt; Linda: ""Wahwahwahwahwah!""

&gt; She huffs, wheezes and cries her way to the nearest exit, followed by
&gt; the groom and my mom. 

&gt; Everyone else stays rooted to the spot.

&gt; WhatTheHellJustHappened.gif


Normally, one would feel compassion for someone who embarrassed themselves on their wedding day like this. However, Linda had been such a nightmare leading up to the wedding that the schadenfreude ran strong and deep throughout the room. 

Fortunately for Linda and her groom, everyone pulled together, the way people do after a natural disaster. Mom drove home to find another dress. Many reassurances were said to all parties. The priest (also a saint) stayed. Lots of fresh air and deep breaths were had. One hour later, we all reconvened and finished the ceremony. Despite the horror of the dress disaster, and no matter how much she deserved it, it was her wedding and love must prevail. At the end if the ceremony the cheers and applause for the newlyweds nearly shook the stain glass windows loose. 

Despite the happy ending, the disaster had some casualties. On the way out of the church I passed the priest's office. The door was cracked. He sat there looking shell-shocked, knocking back the communion wine. 

**TL;dr** Landwhale insists on wearing an open back, strapless wedding dress, held up only by strings of pearls that criss-crossed the back. During communion, the pearls snapped and landwhale flashes the priest. Pandemonium ensues. Everyone pulls together, save the day. Priest seen later looking shell shocked and trying to get drunk on communion wine. 

**EDIT:** Formatting nightmare! Forgive me, it's my first green text post. I've fixed it the best I could on an iPad. :/

**The Hamspanic Part II**

.


*Enter [Rod Serling](http://i.imgur.com/JTdRanv.gif) to narrate, reeking of both thin privilege and oldschoolcool.*

.

""There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to ham. It is a dimension as vast as ""Hamthrax"" and as timeless as ""The Retail Whale."" It is the middle ground between the pannis and the fupa, between bro-science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's stomach and the summit of his summit. This is the dimension of fatlogic. It is an area which we call **""The Adipocyte Zone"".**


""Witness, if you will the plight of OP u/tardismyspiritanimal. Try to picture in your mind the wretched sights he sees, the horrific odors he smells, and the horrors of end-stage fatlogic as it metastasizes into something much, much more sinister.""

*Camera pans from Rod Serling over to OP. Jimmes begin to rustle*
&gt;&gt;Still be me, working in Intensive Care Unit as a nurse tech (body fluid cleanup specialist/nurses bitch).

&gt;&gt;There were more hospital staff running in and out of Hamspanics room than I have ever seen in my life. Several physicians groups were on consult and Respiratory was in there every 20 minutes. 

&gt;Apparently, one of her sisters had died the year before at that hospital *supposedly* weighing around 1,100-ish lbs and had to be transported to the hospital in a small dump truck (or moving van depending on who you asked). And, *supposedly*, the family had won some really nice settlement from the hospital claiming they were “under-equipped” to handle her. So everyone was trying to not screw this up and get stable enough to be shipped out of there to an acute care or something so they won't get sued if she dies on their watch.

&gt;&gt;When I wasn't helping clean up bodily fluids or holding up legs as the nurses cleaned out the kitty...the other part of my job was sitting at the desk in the ICU and continuously monitoring patient vitals such as heart rhythms, how much oxygen they were getting, pulse, blood pressure, answering patient calls, and relaying commands and orders from doctors to the other departments of the hospital, and dealing with family members.

&gt;&gt;Family comes in to visit. [Enter GramHam, Hamana and Hamsband, and her 12 yr old son](http://i.imgur.com/9FERNti.gif) . All are in the biggest military grade power scooters I have ever seen (they had to have been built by Tony Stark or something). The only one who could walk (using the term loosely) was a 12 yr moonboy 4ft/220 lbs we’ll call Peter Pannis.

BTW child protective services had been notified by the social worker about his weight and were trying to get in an eval in the next few days. I never found out what happened with that.

Apparently it is all because of bad genes...right?


&gt;&gt;Hamspanic gets her food tray. 

[*Only one tray*](http://i.imgur.com/UGQjkKx.gif). 

&gt;&gt;And it's soup. 

[*Not served in an 80 gallon drum* 
](http://i.imgur.com/8Z2ROVs.gif)
&gt;&gt;Proceeds to flip the fuck out. 

&gt;&gt;Doctor put her on a calorie restricted/heart healthy diet. Roughly 1600 calories. Mostly liquids so that she could consume it rapidly without dying from lack of oxygen. Throws a huge hissy fit and the [nurse just walked out.](http://i.imgur.com/hpPj4dQ.gif)


45 minutes go by.


&gt;&gt;Working on physician orders. Begin to smell[ rusty meat.](http://i.imgur.com/L2swI30.gif) 

&gt;&gt;Look up to see a two very confused teenage pizza delivery guys asking for Hamspanics room! I beg your [WAT](http://i.imgur.com/zm1nctA.jpg)? Apparently, she has ordered 12 meatlovers pizzas (and a supreme for the veggies) to her ICU room because the doctor apparently don’t know shit about how to treat beetusthyroiditis patients. 

&gt;&gt;“You dumbasses don’t wsrblhbgbg how much whraagbladaspy me to stay alive warglaboslartibartfast just trying to kill me.” 

&gt;&gt;This was all happening right at shift change so the leaving nurse didn’t really want to deal with this and the arriving nurse especially didn't want to have to deal with the aftermath of the inevitable and [horribly literal shitstorm](http://youtu.be/8geLnpGmQAQ) 
to follow from the pizzas. 

&gt;&gt;Charge nurse comes in HFW and sees the pizza boxes. “You...can’t have these. You know this. You are a calorie restricted diet right now.”

&gt;&gt;Insert CPAP muffled fatlogic rant here. Finally says something to the effect of “These pizzas are for the family not for me, so they are fine!”

12 pizzas for 4 family members.

&gt;&gt;“Ma’am I am going to need them to take this to the cafeteria then. The smell is making some our sicker patients nauseous.”

&gt;&gt;“FAYNE!!!”

&gt;&gt;Family starts picking up the boxes. Charge nurse leaves the room.

&gt;&gt;Be me. Remotely monitoring patient vitals while trying to decipher shitty physician handwriting into life or death orders. Multitasking like a champ!

&gt;&gt;All of a sudden the screen starts going off like a Chinese new year and the expensive machine to my left whose only job is to go “Ping” is loudly going “Ping.”

Of course It’s Hamspanics room.

&gt;&gt;Rush in for a vitals signs check because her oxygen sats are dropping on my monitor that are beyond brain damage levels (30-40% O2 sats) and her heart is throwing PVC’s left and right.

&gt;&gt;She has thrown her CPAP completely across the room and [was trying to eat as many pizzas](http://i.imgur.com/BKPVwze) (not pieces) 
as she could before the lack of oxygen made her blackout. 

&gt;&gt;Family wasn’t helping her and had the pizza boxes open on top of her and were stuffing their own faces...like she was a giant semi sentient slug buffet table. [David Lynch](http://i.imgur.com/J4eNR5o.gif) couldn't have come up with a more surreal scene.

&gt;&gt;She looks like a giant greasy blueberry from the oxygen deprivation and absolutely stank like rusty meat. 

She is [literally starting to die](http://i.imgur.com/l9tL34n.gif) from lack of oxygen. 

&gt;&gt;Rush over to her and [slap the pizza out of her hand](http://i.imgur.com/dnobzwj.gif) and try to put the CPAP over her [head](http://i.imgur.com/3JqqA1W.gif). Her [dark beady little eyes narrow](http://i.imgur.com/kkxcUk1.gif). 


&gt;&gt;Then she starts bitching about the last pizza box that she [HAS to get to](http://i.imgur.com/W3BVVzA). 

For those of you that do that whole math thing, that's 11 of the 12 pizzas gone in just a few minutes.

&gt;&gt;All of this happened in about 45 seconds.

.

(Sorry about all of the gifs, I just found [too](http://i.imgur.com/rxPnPNc.gif) [many](http://i.imgur.com/O7r0kIj.gif) [good](http://i.imgur.com/1mQeYpk.gif) ones searching for [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/zn7hNPB.gif)!)

.

&gt;&gt;Several nurses are in the room at this point trying to figure out WTF is going on here.

&gt;&gt;Dr is called to come in and is PISSED. Increases the calorie amount of her restricted calorie diet up to 1800-2000 to try to appease her. 

&gt;&gt;She starts [yelling](http://i.imgur.com/Ca61dV5.gif) so loud that the other patients have started calling in concerned about it. Tries his hardest to explain the situation using his decades worth of medical experience.
 
&gt;&gt;Dude erases the patient information whiteboard to try to draw diagrams for the family about how she will die if she does this again and will die very, very soon if she doesn't get this under control. He was pathetically pleading like I've never heard a grown man plead before.

No...one...fucking...blinks.

&gt;&gt;Then it dawns on him. They knew. And they just didn’t care. This had already happened once before to her sister.

&gt;&gt;Tells the family to leave immediately. They comply...but only until the next morning.


&gt;&gt;[Dr leaves](http://i.imgur.com/pDwmZBC.gif). 
He has been defeated by the fatlogic.

&gt;&gt;10 minutes later over the intercom I hear the all too familiar [“Yooooooohoooooo! Hay booooooyyyyyyzzzzz.](http://i.imgur.com/65PXmJe.gif) Come scratch muh [kittay](http://i.imgur.com/CkegT6s.gif)!” 

&gt;&gt;The meat lovers pizza must have cleaned her out...[shit](http://i.imgur.com/OGOgfdm.gif).

.


**TL:DR Hamspanic patient was unsatisfied with restricted calorie diet. Almost kills herself trying to eat 12 meatlovers pizzas by taking off her CPAP.**

1371952210.0	1gvxza	The Chronicle of Kuetreece: Tales of a Social Worker Part II	onikakushi	559	113	36	"If you haven’t read the first installment, you can find it [here](http://redd.it/1gthdi)

It had been a few months’ time since I had found myself occupying my ‘office’ at the job center—I had even managed to sneak a few personal items in to liven up the space. Truly, the only thing my ‘office’ needed to complete it was, well—erm…I suppose windows would have been a nice start. But, as beggars cannot be choosers—I attempted to do what I could to keep the place from looking too much like Hannibal’s basement.

Regardless of its soul-crushing bleakness and ice cold concrete flooring, there was at least one upside to it—it was clean. I can hear the dissent from the audience already at the proverbial grasping of silver-straw-linings that I seem to be doing. But, I dare say that had you seen the level of cleanliness within my ‘office,’ you too would have gladly shaved your head bald in true Mr. Clean fashion out of respect.

Cleanliness like this doesn’t just happen out of serendipity—oh no, someone or something had to be blessing my space with this ascendant level of pristine prowess. 

I slowly became increasingly curious as to the force at work behind my office’s spotlessness. “Maybe a dimensional vortex only interested in crumbs and dust opens above my desk each night?” I pondered. 

As I began my quest to unravel the mystery behind the miraculous marvels of cleanliness, I decided to inquire as to the building’s cleaning staff. If I could find the janitor behind such wonders, I would be satisfied—or so I thought.

My search for the janitorial staff had come up empty, and I felt more disappointed than a child who had received nothing but socks on Christmas morning. It turns out that our job center, like almost all other government buildings, outsourced their janitorial needs to a third-party company.

Upon hearing this, during my lunch break I decided I would dig as deeply into this janitorial company as 20 minutes of Googling would allow. A helpful coworker had told me the name of the company was “Omega Cleaning Services,” at least I have a name (as bizarre as it was) to work with I thought.

While I had located their homepage and company information with little to no trouble—the real trouble began when I read their hiring and employment policy. In essence, their homepage advertised the fact that not only did their janitorial staff provide impeccable service at the price point, but they also were the sole employer of the city’s “rehabilitated felon program workers.”

They what?

Now, seeing as I was currently employed at a center which aimed to aid many underprivileged and otherwise unemployable folks, I thought I was open minded. But, a workforce of nothing but ex-felons? This company had taken progressive thinking to a level I thought possible only in the wet dreams of the liberal left’s most seasoned bleeding hearts.

It was all beginning to click…we were a job center that helped those who needed it—thus I reasoned it was a mark of good faith to employ a workforce who likewise needed help.

I knew what must be done; I must thank this unknown soldier of the custodial arts for their continued service and let them know that I appreciated all that they did for me.

Eventually, I decided upon leaving a brief note on my desk—a note which commended the nameless warrior for their godlike cleaning.

Now, as anyone who has ever worked in a government facility will tell you—they don’t give you supplies that aren’t completely necessary to complete your job. This meant that I was given no paper with which to write my note upon and left me with no choice but to write my praises on the back of one of my business cards.

I swear to this day that I had crossed my phone number off the back of that card, I mean hell I would even have been willing to take a polygraph to confirm it (more for myself than for anyone else). 

However, I clearly did not do a good enough job.

At around 10:30PM that damp November evening I awoke from a comfy-couch and history channel induced stupor to the sound of my cell phone’s vibration. I puzzled at the unknown number flashing across the screen, but in my semi-delirious state I took the plunge and flipped my sleek Motorola Razer and said, “Hello…?”

The voice on the other side was like nothing I had ever heard before in my life. The deep vibrations of its gurgling voice pushed the tiny speaker of my phone well beyond its functional limits—miraculously it sputtered out a barely understandable, “WHU DIS?”

I cannot say for sure whether it was curiosity or the instinctual rush of fight or flight adrenaline my body received upon hearing the beast’s hungry grunts that forced me to reply—but nevertheless I choked out a, “who is this?”

The answer to my inquiry was met with, “This Kuetreece.” (I swear this is how she spelled it because I asked her to spell it for me, although she pronounced it like “Kat-Reese” as if her name were some ironic amalgamation of Kit-Kat and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups). 

“Kuetreece who?” I stammered as my hands grew clammy.

“Kuetreece yo janitor Kuetreece,” she stated with no reservation.

Never before in my life had my jaw more desperately fought against my facial muscles in an attempt to hit the floor. The wheel in my head was still spinning furiously, but it was clear that the hamster was most certainly dead. 

Luckily for me, Kuetreece had no problem filling the void that my disbelief had created in our conversation, “You so nice leavin’ me dat note tho, I gots a man tho jus so yah no.” 

What……? Had she mistook my simple thank you as a confession of love!? I immediately began a feeble attempt at backstroking in a struggle to gain a conversational foothold once more.

“I just wanted to thank you, I always appreciate the way you clean my office at the building—so I just thought I would write you a thank you not—“

She didn’t let me finish my sentence and interjected, “Oh you naughty boy, you watch meh cleanin on the camera dontchu?”

Once again my jaw pummeled my knees during its immediate suicide dive towards the ground, but I tried to recover as best as I could. “No, I don’t even know if there is a camera in there, but I certainly wouldn’t be watching you clean even if there was.”

“Oh dats how you want to play this, dat fine,” and with that last remark I heard the click of her phone and breathed a sigh of relief, a relief akin to that of the man who just found out he was not the father on Jerry Springer.

I sat in shocked silence on my couch in a stupor. What had just happened? No matter how many times I re-ran the conversation through in my mind, I still couldn’t make heads or tails of it. All I knew was that I had a sinking feeling in my gut which told me this would not be the last I heard of Kuetreece.

As I entered work the following morning with bags under my eyes, I found myself constantly checking over my shoulder—looking for the faceless monster that had haunted my sleep. But, she couldn’t be here though, she works the night shift—I’m fine.

My eight hour shift passed by slower than a Rascal scooter with a flat tire, and I couldn’t wait to escape and return to hiding in my apartment. As I pulled into the parking lot of my apartment complex, I began to convince myself it had all been a dream.

As fate would have it though, a mere hour into work on the following day my comforting delusion was shattered.

Sitting in my ‘office’ with the door closed between ‘clients’ was my only reprieve during the day, and I treasured those few Zen moments I could enjoy between the frequent episodes of crazy. A knock shook me out of my daydream and suddenly my boss entered the room with a grim expression on his face. 

I immediately sensed something was very wrong—my boss never came to talk to me directly, let alone in my ‘office.’

If I may pause for a second to describe my boss, Vincent. Vincent or Vince as we all called him was usually a rather cheery individual. He was a very heavy set tall man, approaching 6’5’’ and somewhere on the order of 325lbs (my best estimation). He had played semi-professional football in his younger days, but after a disastrous knee injury and a few divorces, he had let the weight catch up with him, but he was still strong enough that no one gave him flak for his size.

“Onikakushi, we need to talk,” he bellowed out (with a man of that size in my tiny office, almost anything he said above a whisper echoed and boomed regardless of intent). 

“What is it Sir? It’s rather rare for you to visit me during the day like this; I could have come to your office…” I stated as politely as I could, sensing the impending slaughter and attempting to diffuse it as much as possible beforehand.

“One of the night-shift janitorial staff is filing a sexual harassment claim against you, she showed us the love letter that you wrote and left for her and told us you watched her on camera tapes.”

The what?

“Sir, I only left her a business card of mine with a thank you written on it, and I’ve most certainly never watched her clean,” my brain had ceased functioning.

“Well, come with me—she’s in my office with the letter you wrote, we need to settle this matter immediately,” he growled as he turned about-face and headed towards his office.

My body felt heavy. It felt as though each of his words had attached a hamplanet to my individual limbs that I was now forced to drag along with me. I can only assume as I made my way to his office that my staggering frame must have resembled a reject from Michael Jackson’s Thriller video.

It wasn’t until I had fully entered his office that I finally saw her—although I take moral offence at being forced to prescribe her a gender. Although my previous encounter with Shadynasty had introduced me to the existence of planetary beings, I had never seen this particular breed. Her face was pasty red and yellow, with blotches that resembled the many storms dotting Jupiter’s surface, indeed she even had the great bulging red storm spot on her left cheek. Her arms and midsection teetered outwards into an elliptical form resembling Saturn’s rings and she covered her immense girth with pieces of clothing that wept harder than the starving children who were forced to sew them. While all these features spoke for themselves and told a story more disturbing than any I’d ever read, her horrible neon blue hair was the last straw—I needed to puke. Now.

Unfortunately, I was forced to immediately defend myself from the turbulent torrent of obscenities which flowed forth from her quaking jowls, “YOU PERVERT, I GOTS A MAN U KNEW DAT WHY YOU LEAVIN ME LOVE NOTES!?”

“But, I only left you a simple thank you note; I think you have misunderstood…” I spat out through clenched teeth in an attempt to hold back the dry heaves I was having as I smelled her breath. 

“OH YES YOU DID, I GOTS IT RIGHT HERE,” she smiled sickeningly as she reached into her pocket and pulled out a full piece of paper with writing all over it and waved it triumphantly in my face and began to read aloud.

“OH BABY YOU SO SEXY WASHING MY DESK, I WATCH YOU ALL DA TIME. WHY DON’T YOU LEAVE THAT JOKE AN GET WITH A REAL MAN LIKE ME, I GOTS A REAL BIG ONE FOR YOU.”

This whale had fabricated a love note and used my business card as a means by which to have my name to sign to it. I didn’t even know what to do—this monster had failed to even use the same size of paper as I had for this falsified note.

But before I had a chance to propose a defense for myself, she sprung to action quicker than a shark smelling blood and jabbed her hand deep into her bra and pulled out her cell phone.

She opened it and showed my boss the call log, “LOOK HE EVEN CALLED ME TO HIT ON ME TWO NIGHTS AGO, HE WONT TAKE A HINT!”

My God. I was done for.

I felt the sensation of falling in my gut, and began to reconcile with the eventual crash I was about to feel—when all of a sudden I realized how I could save myself.

“Sir, she claimed that I was watching the tapes, but if I really did leave that note on my desk instead of my business card like I said it will prove she is lying,” I crossed my fingers and hoped he would go for it.

“Good point, let’s go review the film then—Ms. Kuetreece you can come along as well,” he calmly stated and gestured that we should follow him.

The adrenaline and fury was flowing through my veins at this point, and as such I walked with a spring in my step knowing my innocence would soon come to light.

Between her gasps for breath she attempted to keep pace with the two of us and continued to ramble on about how she was going to sue, etc.

We watched the videos from the night in question and my story was confirmed—it was at this point that she had a meltdown of truly galactic proportions.

“THAT’S FAKE, HE’S LYIN I GOT THIS LETTER RIGHT HERE! LOOK AT IT; IT HAS HIS NAME ON IT! I’M GONNA SUE!” While she screamed she was flailing about and stomping like a buck rutting. I’m only glad that we were on the first floor, or we may have been sent flying through the floor during her tantrum.

My boss was not having it; he called the security guards immediately and had her taken out—forcibly. 

As a brief side note: on her way out she had dropped my ‘love letter,’ which upon further inspection was not only not a size of paper we use in the office, but was in fact written on the back of a Chinese take-out menu.

After she had been jettisoned from the building, he turned to me and said, “Onikakushi, I’ll only tell you once—never thank these fuckers for anything. You give them an inch and they’ll take your life, that’s how they live—on the backs of anyone innocent enough to give them the time of day.”

I began to reply when he continued, “Did you see her though? Do I look like that? I need to get off my ass and get back to the gym—I don’t want to be in the same class as her in ANY way.”

And go to the gym he did—during the next few months he had dropped roughly 50lbs and was in much better shape than he had been for (according to him) since he was playing football.

In the end, I was saved by the wonders of technology—a debt I have never forgotten, as I now treat all the electronics in my life with a newfound respect and love I would have not otherwise had.

Following this incident, my boss reported it to Kuetreece’s supervisors and she was immediately fired as a result. We also later found out through one of my boss’s contacts at the janitorial company that this isn’t the first time that they have had a worker attempt to pull a similar stunt in an attempt to extort money from the blamed party for sexual harassment by threatening legal action unless they paid up.

**TL;DR – An odd obsession with cleanliness leads me on a whaling excursion gone horribly wrong. I nearly drown in the fat sea until my boss uses the spear gun to save me from an early gravy whilst saving himself from planetary status simultaneously.**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A light from the heavens shone down upon me, and the Great Beetus in the sky it spake unto me.

**LISTEN! Can you hear the rustling jimmies?** And I said, yes great Beetus in the Sky, I can hear those jimmies a rustlin'. **LISTEN! Can you see those Planets a feedin?** And I said, YES, O Great Beetus in the sky, I can hear those planets a feedin'.

And so the Great Beetus commandeth unto me, for the sake of all your blood sugars, for the pity of your terrible, awful conditions, TO LAY TO REST the deathly rustlin of Jimmies.

The Great Beetus commanded unto me to tell you of the vengeance that the Great Beetus commanded of me, for the king of the basement dwellers, Billyum Beetus.

Hold on to your insulin, ladies and gentlemen, for this is a tale of denial, of relationships, of intrigue... of TWITCHING, and of beady eyed fat logic.

And so we begin.

&gt;If you wish to read the original text in crazy biblical text, skip ahead.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part of Spouse-a-tron's and my Tenancy Agreement mentions that Landlady gets ultimate veto over our guests. Landlady during college was forced to pay a ridiculous sum of money to pay for damages that crazy dust snorting flatmate caused to flat. This rule is ok with us because we're getting mega cheap rent in exchange for some extra rules in the agreement, such as no smoking.

&gt;did not yet realise that Beetus was a fucking psycho.

Anyway. Spouse-a-tron gets a call from mum saying she's bringing two siblings with her down to the city (from their tiny ass village) to do some stuff and visit. Spouse-a-tron being at work when he gets this, texts me to ask if I can relay this to Beetus as he can't really call and discuss at work. I finally get Beetus to fucking listen for more than two seconds and tell him ""Look Spouse-a-tron's family are coming down to stay for a night. Landlady cleared it, that ok for you? We're going to have a big sit down dinner with them so, I'm happy to make some for you, but some personal family shit is going to get discussed and could you give us some space for a night?""

Beetus doesn't hear that, Beetus hears **""HAAAAY BEETUS WE ARE HAVIN A PARTY AND YER NOT INVITED COS I HATTTTEEEE YOOOOOU.""** Beetus feels he deserves to have a party too. While Spouse-a-tron and I are in town picking up his mum and folks, Beetus calls five ""acquaintances"" of his and invites them over for a party and a gaming sleepover. These folks are coming in from all over Glasgow, and intending to stay past last trains and last bus.

We come home to find the front room is completely invaded, including the dining room table we're supposed to eat dinner at, by six unwashed sweaty geeks playing some fiddly intricate tabletop game. Beetus's friends I will name Pinky, Blinky, Twitch, Hippy and Hippy's beta BF who never says anything. 

&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/6p24o8P.gif)

&gt;We're real sick of this shit

""Oh hey Beetus, having a gaming night? Are you wrapping up soon? I'm about to make dinner, we're going to eat soon.""

Beetus loudly declares that he's a strong independent hamplanet who don't need no man.

&gt;beepbeep.mp3

**""See I can have a party too. I have *friends*.""** Beetus declares loudly. His friends look uncomfortable.

Spouse-a-tron tactfully takes mum and siblings upstairs to settle in.

""Ok, but what party? I still need you guys to make space, I'm making dinner.""

Beetus refuses to leave. His friends are staying all night, and he's promised them that I'd feed them all.

""What the hell dude, we don't have room, where are they going to stay? the spare room is being used by youngest sibling and mum, and other sibling is crashing on the couch.""

Beetus is displeased. **""NO, HIPPY AND HIPPY'S BETA BF ARE STAYING IN THE SPARE ROOM, I PROMISED THEM IT. SPOUSE-A-TRON'S FAMILY WILL JUST HAVE TO GO, MY FRIENZ WERE HERE FIRST.""**

Beetus's friends are looking uncomfortable with this discussion. They all quickly leave with the excuse of ""I..uh...have to shampoo my cat."" And so they rush out the door. Beetus is in a fine rage, and I want to slap the shit out of him now that Spouse-a-tron isn't there to stop me, but like telepathy, he comes down and removes me, wordlessly clears up Beetus's game and puts it carefully away, and then tells him to get out.

Beetus runs away, because Spouse-a-tron never flips it, and he looks like he might flip his lid hard.

I may have been denied revenge then and there, but I exacted petty vengeance in other ways, such as swapping his games in their cases, putting them in places he'd never look (A lot of low drawers because he had trouble bending over with his fat ass stomach) and by carefully removing the spray nozzle and label from his axe body spray onto a canister of fabreze, which actually alleviated the smell until he ran out.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And yea Landlady spake unto Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla, ""For you will be the ones to live in my House, there shall be cheap rentz galore, as long as you follow My rules."" And there was much rejoicing in the House of Landlady, for Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla did get very cheep rentz. Landlady had writ unto the tenancy agreement these three rules, laws of of the House of Landlady, for all those who righteously live in the House of the Landlady to follow.



&gt;Firstly, Be there no smoking in the House of Landlady. And all was merry in the House, for Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla did not smoke anyways. Second, that there be no shoes on in the House of Landlady, for the carpets were new, and besides, slippers are much comfier, yo. And there was much rejoicing, for chesZilla had many pairs of comfy warm slippers with which to protect the new Carpets in the House of Landlady, and her own dainty feets. And Third, Landlady spake most harshly, for this was the most precious of rules in the House of L. Third, Thee snorters of the Dust of Crazy would be forever banhammered from the House of the Landlady. For the Landlady had experienced Crazies, and they did much damage unto the college apartment of Landlady. And much monies were paid for the reparations of damages. Which was not cool.



But there was much rejoicings from Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla, for these rules would be easy to follow. 


&gt;Yeah I know Beetus was a fucking nutjob but we didn't find that out until well after he'd moved in, eh?



And all was well within the House.  But in the House resided the one known as Billyum Beetus. And he sent by the Great Beetus, to spread the tenets of fatlogic and fattitude, began to stink of the Crazy Dust.




&gt;One day the family of Spouse-a-tron, wished to pay a visit to Spouse-a-tron and his soon-to-be-wife, chesZilla, and they did call on the cellular phones, and make arrangements. ChesZilla did seek permission from Landlady, as was writ in the Agreement of the Tenancy,  and Landlady did approve the family of Spouse-a-tron coming to visit and staying in the House. For Spouse-a-tron was at work, chesZilla was tasked with informing Beetus. Beetus, in rare display of actually acknowledging the presence of a mere woman such as misheard everything.




""Just a heads up, Spouse-a-tron's mum and two sisters are coming to visit, if that's alright with you, we'll need the front room for big family dinner."" Was misheard by Beetus, and he thought she had said ""Yea until me, my posh frienz will come over for rollicking good times and a soiree, and I inform you for you are not among the Invited."" Beetus's eyes did narrow into suspicious beady slits, as he contemplated ruining the plans of Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla. This he did for he felt it was divine retribution for not paying homage to his Great Beetusness.



&gt;While Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla met the family from the Bus Station, Beetus invited his five 'acquaintances', Pinky, Blinky, Twitch, Hippy and Hippy's beta BF who never says anything. And Beetus did invite them over from all the corners of Glasgow without permission or even consulting with the other members of the House. In the Front Room, he covered the Dining Table, the only table capable of seating more than one person, with games of intricacy and delicate rules. And he invited his five 'acquaintances' to join with him in a celebration of tabletop games.



Upon returning home, Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla discovered this den of moral turpitude, and were like ""What the fuck man"", making a face such as [this.](http://i.imgur.com/6p24o8P.gif) For they were both real tired of his shit. And Beetus spake unto the House members **""See I can have a party too. I have *friends*.""** Spouse-a-tron tactfully removed his family out of the line of fire, for he could tell chesZilla was about to lose her cool. And chesZilla did spake unto Beetus: ""Oh having a games night? Are you wrapping up soon? I'm about to start dinner for Spouse-a-tron's family, and we need the big table. Perhaps you can move upstairs?""


&gt;Beetus, in his displeasure said unto chesZilla, **""We will not be done anytime soon, because it is a game night, and we wish to play games all night. Because they have come from the farthest corners of Glasgow, they are staying here for the gaming shall run very late indeed.""** And chesZilla was so enraged by these words, that she did 'blow up at him'. ""Beetus, that's really insensitive, for we did tell you we had visitors on this night, and the House is not built to hold so many people."" But Beetus did not care, for he was a douche canoe. **""If You can throw a party, I can throw a party. Just make Spouse-a-tron's parents sleep on the couch, I promised Hippy and Hippy's beta boyfriend who never says anything the spare bed.""** The 'acquaintances' of Beetus were made discomfortable by the discussions, and excused themselves to return home, for they had forgotten to shampoo their cats.

Beetus was enraged, and he did shout and rave so that the walls did rumble in their settings. **""You have done this unto me, for you are a little slut who is insecure at not having friends so you take it out on me and don't want me to do anything fun. You just want me to become fat and lonely and suicidal, so that I will kill myself. That is what you want.""** And chesZilla was mightily confused with his fatlogic.

&gt;And Spouse-a-tron, with the tact of a million awesomes, entered the discussion at just that moment, to remove chesZilla from the room, before she did tear Beetus's fat stupid face off his skull. But chersZilla was not satisfied, for she did switch all of Beetus's games around to different cases, and hid his favourite JRPGs in secret places. Beetus was much irritated by this, for he could not sing his jPRG pop songs anymore. And chesZilla did carefully swap the spray nozzle and label of his axe body spray with a canister of fabreze, and the atrocious smell was alleviated briefly. Until he ran out.

**TL;DR**

Beetus decides ""family visiting"" means PARTAY and that same day invites five people he only kind of knows, without clearing it with us. When we are suggest moving the game he refuses, I get upset, he claims it is because I do not want him to have fun and am trying to control him because I am insecure about not having friends. Petty revenge follows."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;wtf, an earthquake?

1373614813.0	1i52qy	A boy risks it all to lose weight.	El_Hamerino	512	70	78	"Alright. I'm gonna give this green text thing a go so I apologise in advance to all of you if I stuff it up. Here is a story from about a month ago. 

&gt;be me. 80kg ~185cm

&gt;at gym doing some squats

&gt;suddenly, doors open and in ~~walks~~ waddles a huge man (probably 180kg) and what I assume to be his around 11 year old son (I'm guessing he's about 70kg)

&gt;father seem to be extremely mad at son for coming here

&gt;get to the front desk and the son says something about wanting to lose weight and asks about coming here whenever

&gt;receptionist gives him a quote of how much it'll be for that amount of time

&gt;father goes ballistic

&gt;son turns to him and begins pleading to let him do it

&gt;the dad starts shouting

&gt;receptionist calmly says that they get a discount if they don't leave after *x* amount of time

&gt;he gives in and pays 

&gt;receptionist, doing her job, asks if he wants to join his son in losing weight

&gt;well, that was the final straw for the father

&gt;starts yelling at his kid about how it's a waste of time, money, etc. 

&gt;everyone's now looking at him

&gt;finally screams ""If you want to lose weight so much, then you can walk home!"" 

&gt;the child shrugs, looks a bit sad, but not that much

&gt;father leaves

&gt;the boy starts doing his workout, occasionally asking for assistance from other people

&gt;decided to watch him for a while

&gt;saw that he was working extremely hard, and he never gave up. Never


About an hour, I finish my session. Coincidently, the boy finishes at the same time. I decided to try and talk to him


&gt;tell him I saw what his dad said earlier and that if he needed a ride home I'd be happy too 

&gt;smiles and says what his dad said is right and that he should walk home

&gt;informs me that he only lives about a km away

&gt;tell him to be careful when he gets home

&gt;i leave

&gt;he leaves

Fast forward to same day, just the next week. 

&gt;ask receptionist if the boy has been back
&gt;""yeah he has. He came back on Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday night"" 

&gt;holyshit.jpg

&gt;never see him again. He must've stopped doing Friday nights

Important to the story, because racist hamplanets happened.

So I'm walking to the library, as bookworms tend to do on comfortable summer mornings, TPL bag in hand and a spring in my step. When out of nowhere appear the fattest, most disgusting band of teenagers I have ever laid eyes on, ever ever ever. I'll skip past all the ""Buildings shaking, pavement cracking"" bits to get to the juicy part.

""Ramadan doesn't start for another month, paki!"" Yells the Regina George mini-planet. What the fuck? (For those who don't know, Ramadan is a Muslim holiday month of fasting to promote the awareness of the sufferings of the poverty stricken.)

I am Bengali, not Pakistani.
I am not Muslim, I don't hold a steadfast belief in anything.
I am not fasting, dieting, or limiting myself from food in any way.
Even if I was, no stranger is in any position to comment.
Especially not those fucking walking hamballs whose BO could knock an adult bear out from a mile away.

While she's a ""trim"" (for planets) 5'7"" 230, she displays all the telltale signs of fatlogic. We lived together for about 18 months, during which she never payed utilities on time and did drugs and ate kinda-food constantly (worked two fast food jobs, ate 3 of 4 meals a day at work). Eventually evicted her, still FB friends. We'll call her H.  
H was dumped by her last boyfriend about 4 years ago (she's 24 now) and still constantly posts statuses about missing him, dreaming about him, how nobody measures up. And then she makes posts about how it sucks to be single, where are all the good guys at, yada yada. I never call her out on it, because its mostly just pathetic and not actually irritating.  
Lately though, she starts posting all this ""Real women have curves, only dogs like bones"" bullshit. And honestly, that *does* really irritate me, because despite how I feel about landwhales, I would NEVER post something like that. Then she posted [this little number](http://www.rottenecards.com/ecards/Rottenecards_4431822_gm5965xrnt.png). I finally called her out and asked why we couldn't all just love our bodies and not hate on each other.  
Her reply was basically that, because its a joke, its okay, and that its way harder being ""curvy"" like her (I wear a 32D, jus' sayin'), so I should calm down.  
In return, I posted [this puppy here](http://imagemacros.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/no-fat-chicks1.jpg).  Just a joke, right? Can't bunch your granny panties over a joke!    
 **ENGAGE FATTY RAGE MODE**. Bitches me out, then deletes the entire status, then unfriends me. But not before about 15 of her friends backed me up.  
Success.

1369165753.0	1es8oi	The joys of owning a restaurant. In the deep south.	DontWantToAdvertise	516	75	196	"&gt; Be me, own a restaurant in the deep south. 

&gt; Literally the most unhealthy restaurant I've ever been to. I refuse to eat here.

&gt; Few months ago, local college offers to measure calories in our food. Not very accurate because they're using bomb calorimeters, but whatever.

&gt; There's a grand total of 0 meals that are under 1000 calories, 2 that are under 1500. 

&gt; 2 hours ago, enter two 500lb+ women.

&gt; Not an uncommon sight down here.

&gt; My wife - who is about 80lbs - takes them to their table.

&gt; They order drinks.

&gt; ""Sweet tea with a scoop of ice cream init""

&gt; Wife gives them their... drink

&gt; ""Can I get some sugah in this? I said sweet tea, darlin.""

&gt; Wife brings them sugar.

&gt; ""We're tryna diet before summer. Do you have noootritional information?""

&gt; Wife comes and finds me, I dig around looking for nutritional pamphlets no one ever asks for. Find one.

&gt; Wife gives it to them.

&gt; 5 minutes later, they're ready to order.

&gt; ""We each want one of those bahbacue fried plates.""

&gt; mfw that is probably the worst thing on the menu.

&gt; It's like a BBQ plate, but deep fried.

&gt; Deep fried barbecue chicken, deep fried brisket, deep fried ribs, deep fried macaroni balls, deep fried baked bean fritters, deep fried biscuit, and cole slaw. Enough food for at least 2 people.

&gt; Cole slaw isn't deep fried. There's not even that much mayo on it.

&gt; I like a crunchy, vinegary coleslaw.

&gt; Wife brings them their food, they start eating.

&gt; Wife drops by a bit later asking if everything is okay and if they want more sweet tea.

&gt; ""More ice cream init this time darlin""

&gt; They pour sugar in the cole slaw while she's there.

Skip to when they are done eating.

&gt; They order dessert.

&gt; They eat dessert.

&gt; Wife hands them the bill.

&gt; They pay.

&gt; On their way out, one says, ""I can't believe that was only 70 calories! Teehee!""

&gt; ""That must be how the waitress stays so skinny!""

&gt; Confused on how they thought that was only 70 calories.

&gt; Look at nutrition guide I gave them.

&gt; Under sauces: ""Fried Barbecue Sauce - 2oz - 70 calories""

(It's not actually fried. It's just made from fried onions.)

&gt; ""Fried Barbecue Platter - 2460 calories""

And that's neglecting the tea and ice cream. And extra sugar."	t5_2vzax	True

In high school I was on the tennis team, pretty fit 5'2 and about 105 lb. Had a friend who was also 5'2, easily 300 lb. She made attempts to manage her weight, tried to diet and exercise, but you know how thyroids are. 

One day she starts asking why I'm not as wide as I am tall. I tell her about my exercise routine and eating habits. Surprisingly, she actually takes my advice on limiting her consumption of all things fried and try to exercise. She surprises me further by joining the tennis team a week later.  I thought she overcame her fat logic. We're gonna make it!

But no, fatty logic is strong with this one. 

I normally rode my bike 2 miles to tennis practice, but fatty mc fat fat couldn't ride a bike. Her mom drove her and she offered me a ride. I was sucked into the low rider mini van by the gravitational pull of these two celestial bodies.  

Her mother had two bags of BK waiting for her. Count snackula destroyed two burgers, a large fry and an order of nuggets in the 7 minutes it took to drive to practice. 'So she didn't get lightheaded'

At this point I'm amazed she can't realize that this isn't a good first step for loosing weight. I have no words for her, I just stare. 

We get to practice and wait for everyone to show up. The coach provided a water jug and a container of powdered Gatorade. Fatty finishes her toddler size beverage of diet soda to keep her diabeetus in check and pulls out her own gallon of Gatorade. She then proceeds to take the coaches powdered gatorade and add it to her own. This ham beast uses half the container. Her drink is now opaque from all the powder she's added to it. I ask why, and she responds she needs the electrolytes or she will be sick. Because thyroids.

**Electrolytes! It's what cows crave!**

She chugs half of this saturated sugar solution, attempts to do a sprinting drill, and throws up neon purple hamburger chunks all over one of the courts after 30 seconds of strenuous activity.  
She wasn't asked to join the team. "	t5_2vzax	True

Here is something that happened to me awhile back.


Characters:


Me: 24 y.o. Slim, Art Major, 


Hambeast: Age Unknown. Massive girl. Art? Major


------------------------


&gt;I get call to set up an interview with a local advertisment agency. I prepare my portfolio. i have no idea what to bring so I pack a bit of everything. A painting, a sketch, a few photos, a few digital items. (posters, paintings, etc)


&gt;I get dressed in my professional clothing. Work Pants, Button up shirt, fix hair as well.


fuckyesgonnagetjob.avi


&gt;I drive over to building and go inside. 5 people are sitting in there.


&gt;I sit down in chair and wait for my name to be called. Another girl waddles in and sits next to me. 


&gt;I begin looking over at the competition and see two guys, a girl. Guys are both dressed in a t-shirt with ripped jeans. No worries. Girl is wearing a hoodie with short shorts. Not worried.


&gt;The girl that walked in sits next to me, and feel the earth tilt on its axis. She gives out a loud huff and just begins searching her backpack.


&gt;I use a portfolio carrying case (24 by 28 inches) to carry everything. Apperently I'm the only one that has.


&gt;I see girl rip a greasy drawing out of her backpack, and she begins scribbling on it. A note or something I figured?


&gt;She seems me looking and scoffs. She talks under her breath (but I still hear her) 


&gt;""Stupid skinny bitches think they can get a job by just being pretty."" She tries to say silently.


&gt;""Excuse me?"" I Interrupt her and ask her what she meant by that.


&gt;She turns to me with a big smile on her face. ""You see this? I drew this. This is going to gurantee me the job!"" I look down at her drawing and greated by... typical anime weeaboo fanart crap. 


&gt;I just stare and comment on it. Saying the anatomy of the person is messed up, and why is the girl so thin? The girl in the painting looked like a holocaust survivor and had her arm bent in an extremely weird way.


&gt;""Don't you recognize her? ITS ME!"" She says with a smile on her face. I'm a bit flabbergasted at the moment. She is submitting that for a job interview? 


&gt;I look at it again and notice the character is really familiar... ""Isn't that Nana from the manga?""


&gt;She rips the paper from my hand before I can say anymore and scoffs at me. ""Skinny cunt."" She says to me.


&gt;I just ignore her at this part. Be the bigger girl (lol) and try not to reduce myself to her level. I keep hearing a noise though and begin looking for it. As I turn around I see her KICKING my portfolio. 


&gt; I Kept it between the seats to avoid this kind of thing, but she was just casually kicking it and pretending not to notice.


&gt;""Please stop that"" I ask and all she does is smile at me.


&gt;A pretty attractive secratary comes out of the office and begins 
calling people by name. The first guy enters and leaves fairly quickly same with the second, and hoodie girl left quickly. They return to their spots to continue talking or texting.


&gt;I'm next and I go into the office with my portfolio. Boss Guy has a quick look at it and nods, smiles, and shows it to others. He looks over it again and again. He said that the uh painting one was not necessary to bring in so much. The digital art would've been sufficient. They would like to see more and they scheduled a second interview with me.


fuckyes.gif


&gt;Hambeast is called in next and she just waddles in. I didn't notice it before but.. the fuck is she wearing? She is wearing an extremely tight hoodie, a small Sailor Moon backpack, sneakers, and a skirt? What? Her ankles though look swollen as fuck.


&gt;She comes out fairly quickly with a huge ass smile on her face. As she sits next to me she just bends over and says ""See that? The moment they got a look at my curves they knew who to hire. Goodluck in the soup kitchen you anorexic  bitch. 


&gt;I ask her if they asked for another interview. She just smiled and said ""They didn't need to. As soon as they saw me, my art, and all of this. They knew who to hire. She groped herself as she was saying this. I gag a little


&gt;The bossguy comes out with the rest of his crew. ""You all have interesting art, and some better than others"" (Hambeast looked at me and smiled) ""I will read off the list of people who will be attending the next interview. 


&gt;Boss pulls down a piece of paper. Says my name, hoodie girl, and guy B. Guy A walks out without a word.


&gt;Bossguy smiles and says That will be all and will the names I called please follow me.


&gt;Hambeast isn't having any of this. ""Excuse me?"" She shouts at him ""I believe you missed a name."" 


&gt;Boss guy looks over her and just smiles and says ""I believe I haven't."" Didn't even look at the list. Hambeast is furious.


&gt;She shouts at them ""Excuse me? You can't honestly believe that these anorexic cunts deserve it more than I do?"" Bossguy turns again and says ""I believe they do, and your interview is over. Goodbye""


&gt;As he begins walking out she marches over to my portfolio case which I'm carrying and grabs it, and begins jumping up and down on it (The building was shaking) 


&gt;""CALL SECRUITY NOW!"" Bossguy screams at one of his secrartarys. 


&gt;""You are discriminating against me! I'll sue you for everything you have!"" Hambeast is shouting at them as is kicking around my portfolio. 


&gt;i'm stunned by all this, and quite frankly. Scared.


&gt;Hoodie girl is standing there doing nothing. Guy B is just laughing.


&gt;Secruity finally makes it up and grabs Hambeast by her arms and begin dragging her away. I can hear both of them going ""Urgh.."" as they forcefully pull her away.


&gt;She keeps shouting ""Don't you know who I am? I'm going to be bigger than anyone even INSERT JAPANESE NAME HERE"" 


&gt;The boss guy looks a bit flustered and asked to check if my portfolio is ok. I let him take a look and he says looks fine. The bag I use is damn sturdy. 


&gt;We all enter the room and we are scheduled for our next interview and given a job. He says if our work is accepted you will be paid, but only one of us will be accepted.


I never found out what happened to Hambeast, but I heard her scream the whole way down the hall. Some of the shouts being about how we are discrimnating against her, how she is better, and my personal favorite ""FAT ACCEPTANCE WILL WIN"" was the last thing I heard from her.

At this point in the week I'm starting to get in a lazy mode where I don't want to write, so I really want to thank all of you for your awesome responses because that is what is keeping me at my keyboard.

WARNING: Buckle up them jimmies, I will not be responsible if you lose them.

This story comes from my retail days, and unfortunately it is about someone I knew personally.

Back story: There was this girl I knew in high school, who we'll call Sophia because I like the named Sophia, who was on the track &amp; field team with me (hurdles.fuckyeah). Sophia (17, 5'7”, 120lbs) would be in my store a few times a week buying her own food because her lard-beast of a mother, who we'll call Scootercunt, absolutely refused to buy the foods that Sophia wanted. Now, we're going to clear this up right now, Sophia ate like I did at that time, lots and lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, deli meats and cheeses, 12 grain breads, steel-cut oats, organic peanut butter, plain coffee &amp; tea, and water. Also the occasional steak or burger &amp; fries or milkshake, but only after a huge track meet. Scootercunt, (who was 5'0” and when I first met her she was pushing 350lbs), on the other hand, would only pay for sodas, chips, candies, snack cakes &amp; pies, cookies, cans upon cans of that Chef Boyardee crap (no offense to anyone who likes it, it's just not healthy is all I'm saying), and, well, you get the picture. Scootercunt was always riding one of the electric carts in our store despite not actually being disabled (hence the name) and was always giving Sophia shit about what she ate, saying it wasn't healthy to be eating “rabbit food” all the time and that she needed to eat bigger, “healthier” meals (dafuq?) so she could gain weight and attract the boys. Scootercunt was always going on about how important it was for Sophia to gain weight so she would be able to get a boyfriend. Joke was on Scootercunt, Sophia's a lesbian and to this day is still highly desired by both men and women.

Now on to the story...

Be me, 17, still working in crappy grocery store. See Scootercunt coming in the front doors of the store. She has definitely gained weight in the last few months I've been seeing her around my store, and my guess is she was pushing 400lbs at that point. Sophia comes in behind her with a normal cart and sets off to do her shopping. Scootercunt heads toward her motorized throne and plops her ass down on it. She sits there for 5 minutes but doesn't move. I am slightly confused for a second, then remember the carts have a weight limit of like 375lbs. Scootercunt yells to me that the cart isn't working and gets off. I sit down on the cart (it only turned on when someone was sitting on it, the set itself is a scale) and show her that the cart does in fact work. I get off and Scootercunt gets back on, and again, the cart won't move. Scootercunt is now yelling and cursing that the cart isn't working, and of course Sophia, who is nearly done with her shopping at this point, hears and comes over.

Sophia: “Ma, there's a weight limit on those carts.” She points to where the weight limit sign is.

Scooterbeast: “I only weigh 350! This cart must be broken!”

Sophia: “Bullshit Ma, you gained a lot of weight recently. You are at least 400lbs now.”

Scooterbeast starts yelling and cursing again, so Sophia nopes over to the self checkout, pays for her stuff, and leaves. Sophia fucking walked a mile and a half home with her groceries because her mom was making a scene. At this point, a lot of people (both customers and employees) are very annoyed with Scootercunt and my boss calls the police. When the police get there, they tell her to leave because she is creating a huge scene and disrupting the peace. Scootercunt becomes quiet, and looks like she's about to cry. She squeezes back off the cart looks over at me, and asks where Sophia is. I shrug and tell her she walked home. Scootercunt starts yelling again, but stops when a cop pulls out his taser. Scootercunt ends up just leaving, not having been able to ride around the store even though she is still able to walk just fine despite her weight. Gotta protect dem curves somehow I guess...

TL;DR Fruits &amp; veggies are bad, mkay?

Epilogue: Sophia ended up moving out of her mother's place on her 18th birthday. She just couldn't tolerate living in a sea of filth and fatlogic any longer, so she went to go live with her paternal aunt and uncle, who were awesome and very healthy themselves. Sophia's mom still refuses to talk to Sophia because Sophia “abandoned” her; Sophia says that her mom raising her on junk food and not allowing her to eat healthy food until she could afford it herself should have been considered child abuse, and I completely agree with that. I have more fat people stories that involve Sophia, I promise to post those at some point in time.

&gt;Bus is crawling along the road - traffic, roadworks, potholes - all make for a longer-than-average journey time.

&gt;Press the bell on the bus to let the driver know I want to get off the bus. Waiting by the door so I can GTFO (there's naps to be had) and get home as soon as possible.

&gt;Bus speeds up. Like it's being sucked along the road, by some giant, massive force. 

&gt;See larger-than-a-small-family-car Sasquatch-porcine standing at the bus stop, flailing her arm (with her fat bingo wings jiggling backwards and forwards in a rhythmic, hypnotising fashion).

&gt;Bus stops, and the doors open. I thank the driver and make to get off the bus. Porcine pork planet is already on the step of the bus, but is so everfucking wide that I can't get off. 

&gt;See red, and say ""Excuse me, let me off the bus"".

&gt;Fatties face crumples. ""I NEEED to get on the bus and SIT DOWN and EAT. I'm STARVING and NEED TO REST MY FEET"".

&gt;Reply ""I don't care. I need to get off the bus. It's rude to barge on without letting people off first"".

&gt;It opens its maw and replies ""But I'm STARVING. It's BEEN HOURS SINCE I HAD BREAKFAST"".

&gt;""Love, there's no way you're starving"" chimes in the bus driver ""and you're being rude, now let the young lady off"".

&gt;""Why are you being so ABLEIST?!"" cries the blubbermound.

&gt; I start giggling at this (too much time on TiTP, perhaps?) and she shoots me a death stare.

&gt;Tell her ""I'm not giving way to you. At any rate, you're so fat I could not fit past you in the gantry of the bus. Let me off. I can stand here ALL DAY if I have to. Your legs will pack in shortly, so just let me off the bus"".

&gt;Fattie spies a Policeman in the distance. Gets off the bus, telling driver to ""wait the fuck there"". Waddles over the the Policeman, I get off the bus, and he *drives away*. Fattie sees this, and starts crying. Proper massive, my-feels-runneth-over sobbing. 

&gt;Policeman comes over to me to ask what was going on. I explain, and he asks why I didn't just let her have her way. LOL, heartily, and the Policeman joins in.

I find out, she is ALWAYS like that. Hence the reason they are no longer OG’s roommates. 

OG tells me about how when they lived together she would “forget OG was home” and sit on the couch in nothing but her bra/panties. Or, “accidentally” walk into his room at night, naked, claiming she picked the wrong door. She also didn’t pay any bills, her only contribution to the household was her foodstamps, which she got for being on disability. She’s only 17. She has.. yeah, you guessed it, a “condition”. So, on the first of each month, she bought all $200 worth of junk food, and used her disability check to buy however much beer. Which would be okay, except by the next day it’s ALL gone. She eats all the food. $200 worth. In 24 hours. While her and my brother bring other lowlifes into the house for a “party” and they drink all the beer. Including whatever OG had in the fridge for himself. 

The last straw was when Slowbro was “taking up too much bed” so she crawled naked (or nearly naked, it was dark and he couldn’t be sure considering her choice of underwear) into OG’s bed in the middle of the night. He woke up, found her, and moved out that night. (but that’s a story for another time).

Now, we’re still at the lake, Slowbro calmed the savage wailord  and convinced her to come back to the water.

&gt;nooooooooo.mp3

 It’s starting to get dark at the lake, which is a big party spot. People start to arrive, and bring music/food/beer. OG and I are sitting in the shallow water having a discussion about the movie we saw last week or something, enjoying the music. We know most of these people from high school, and end up in a decent size group once everyone migrated towards the water. Slowbro and Jigglybitch were about 10 feet away in the water, she was still running her mouth about me and OG. 

&gt;Slowbro- “Blahblahblah, don’t worry about her, baby. You look great, blahblahblah”

&gt;Pretty sure he’s just trying to avoid getting eaten. 

&gt;Whatever, aintnobodygottimeforthat.jpeg

&gt; One of OG and I’s mutual friends from high school [let’s call her bandgirl] came up and commented on how great I look, and how I’ve lost so much weight. (partially true, partially just politeness). 

&gt;  I tell her it’s just from working and being so busy, but thanks (:

&gt; OG says something about how it’s a miracle I eat ever since I’m so forgetful. Obviously joking. 

&gt; “SNORT. YEAH LOOK AT THAT GUT, YOU CAN TELL SHE *NEVER* EATS. SNORT. MAYBE IF SHE WORKED OUT A LITTLE SHE WOULD HAVE REAL CURRRVES, LIKE ME. teehee”

&gt;Bandgirl looks over at jigglybitch, and gets panicked look in her eyes. Doesn’t know what to say to that. 

&gt; I tell her to ignore the beast, and compliment her on her bathing suit, we begin catching up on the latest small town drama. 

&gt;Jigglybitch doesn’t like to be ignored. Talks shit even louder to Slowbro. 

&gt;At this point most of us had had a few beers. 

&gt;Someone suggested we play chicken. (the version where you get one someones shoulders, and try to knock the person off the other persons shoulders)

&gt;So about 8 of us go out into the water, pair up and proceed to try and knock each other’s drunk asses into the water. 

&gt;My turn, I hop up on OG’s shoulders, and wait for the other team.
 
&gt; “MY TURN MY TURN! I WANNA PLAAAAAAAY!”

&gt;Some random person “Okay, you gotta get on someone’s shoulders.”

&gt; she looks at slowbro.

&gt; he tells her he can’t, he hurt his back earlier. 

&gt;lolok.

&gt;She’s pissed, “FINE! I’LL GET SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT. I’M SURE SOMEONE HERE IS A *REAL* MAN.

&gt;Go figure, nobody volunteers.

&gt;We continue with our game, as she stomps out of the lake. Not even slowbro followed her this time. 

&gt;About 20 minutes later, she comes up and tells us someone’s pizza is here. Apparently one of the groups ordered pizza to the lake, awesome. 

&gt;Drunkguy gets out to pay the pizza man. 

&gt;Pizza man is actually more like pizza kid. Maybe 16. Scrawny.

&gt;JB mysteriously vanished, a pretty amazing feat for someone of her stature. 

&gt;drunkguy ordered 3 large pizza’s.. pizza kid only has 2. 

&gt;Receipt says 3.

&gt;Pizza kid said that Jigglybitch took one when she sent him over. Said it was hers..

&gt;Drunkguy is PISSED.

&gt;Poor pizza kid realizes his mistake, and freaks out apologizing. 

&gt;it’s cool, Drunkguy pays him anyway. He gets the fuck out of there as fast as possible.

&gt;We all look for Jigglybitch. Find empty pizza box on hood of car. 

&gt;She ate a large supreme pizza in under 10 minutes.

&gt;Well, except for anything resembling a vegetable, those of course were picked off and left in the box. 

&gt;Drunkguy, “WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.”

&gt;Someone spots JB sitting on the edge of the lake. She has the last 1/4th of the pizza folded up and is working on stuffing it in her face.

&gt;Drunk guy walks up and slaps the pizza into the lake. She scrambles for it, “HAY THAT’S MIIIIIINE”

&gt; “No bitch, I ordered it. We paid for it. You stole it. A whole fucking pizza. And you’re going to pay us back!”

&gt; “MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS LOW, I HAVEN’T EATEN ALL DAY.""

&gt;Drunkguy doesn’t give a shit.

&gt; “I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR EVERYONE”

&gt;”So you ate a whole pizza?”

&gt; “I HAVE A CONDITION!”

&gt;Enter slowbro, who calms everyone down and pays for the pizza.

&gt; “HMMPH!”

&gt;We all go on with ignoring her.

Remember how Jigglybitch doesn’t like being ignored?

&gt;OG and one of his buddies had swam out to the end of the dock to talk vidya games or something. 

&gt;I am sitting on the beach, enjoying a beer with some friends. 

&gt;Jigglybitch locks on to her target, and races over like he’s the icecream truck. 

&gt;I see it all happening in slow motion.. too far away to stop it.

&gt;It’s dark, OG doesn’t notice her until it’s too late. 

&gt;Jigglybitch launches herself at OG “teehee CARRY ME! teehee” 


Thank god that he had good footing, and that she was lighter in the water, or I’m pretty sure this would be the story of how OG died. 


&gt;Jigglybitch had her flabby limbs wrapped around him. No intention of letting go.

&gt; OG, “What the FUCK JB? You could have drowned me. Get the fuck off. 

&gt; “teehee DON’T BE SILLY OG, IF YOU CAN CARRY wtfitsaries YOU CAN CARRY MEEEE!”

&gt; OG- “She’s like half your fucking size get off.”

&gt; “teehee! YOU’RE CARRYING ME JUST FINE, SEE!”


OG was done. No more playing even remotely nice. Everyone had stopped what they were doing to see what the hell was going on.


&gt; OG- “GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME! I DON’T WANT TO FEEL YOUR SKINFLAPS ON MY BACK, AND IF YOU GROPE ME ONE MORE FUCKING TIME I WILL DROWNED YOU. 

&gt;Everyone’s silent. 

&gt;I laugh. 

&gt;JB looks stunned, lets go, but recovers quickly.

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST ACTING LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOUR BITCH OF A GIRLFRIEND IS HERE. WE BOTH KNOW YOU WANT ME.”


It’s like a trainwreck in slow motion, you can’t look away. 


&gt;OG “I don’t want you. I don’t want anything to fucking do with you. You’re pathetic and disgusting and I don’t see why SlowBro puts up with your shit!

&gt;JB starts crying, flops all the way over to SlowBro. They get out of the water to leave, while she talks loudly about how she always knew OG was a faggot. And I’m just some slut to suck his dick. Blah blahblah

&gt;Car disappears

&gt;Everyone else at the lake is laughing. Tears were shed. 

&gt;Someone shows up with more beer. All is forgotten.

&gt;OG and I sit and enjoy the rest of our evening, while I pick on him for “his other girlfriends” behavior. 


Next time on SlowBro and Jigglybitch: a tree falls on their trailer, and they are forced to vacate for a night. OB is the only person who will take them in, and a night turns into a week. Stay tuned.

1372875243.0	1hky3u	Cool Whip is healthy! Part 2	Ishityounotman	549	117	161	"Welcome back you rotund redditors! If you do not want your jimmies to run away, I would advise you to stop reading now.

Day two of new job begins and I took your advice and reported FAT.

Happily ever after! Right?

No.

As it turns out, FAT is the director's sister (well half sister ). I told the director of the camp all about the cookie thief and the cursing, and she was not amused. She was furious at me. Apparently FAT had told her after camp about 'how I was judging her' and that 'I was going to get her fired by making up some story.'

The director was angry and told me that I have to be nice to FAT or I should start looking for a new job. The director said 'I'm very disappointed in you that you would be so rude to someone, and if front of children! You should be ashamed of yourself. How dare you make up a story about a co-worker just because she's not as small as you. One more infraction and you are out of here.'

Note the director is not a small lady herself, but not planet sized.

After getting chewed out, I was so angry I had to go sit in the bathroom for a minute and calm down. Then I went to class.

I walked in to see FAT engaging in mass consumption (surprise!) 

We had eye contact. She smiled and in that moment, I decided I hated her more than Nicholas Cage, more than local commercials, more than Umbridge from Harry Potter, more than sitting on a cold toilet seat in the middle of winter. I decided to pretend nothing was wrong and that nothing had happened. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing she had gotten me in trouble. So I went about business and watched her eat.

Breakfast was 2 sasuage egg McMuffins, 3 hash browns and a large caramely-glucose concoction from Micky D's. Not as bad as the first day. 

That was yesterday. Today. Oh today. Today takes the cake. 

Today the munchkins were all making little crowns to wear because we were putting on a parade after lunch. They made their crowns, (while FAT was in Instagram) and then it was lunch time! 

Today was a special lunch for the munchkins, the teacher and I had made them grilled cheese, brought fruit and cookies for a little 4th of July celebration. FAT disappeared about an hour before this.

They stared eating, and I had an idea. 

'Hey teacher!'

'Yeah, I shityounotman?'

'I think the kids would *love* Cool Whip on their strawberries!'

'Go for it.' Replied the teacher.

So I did the unthinkable and stole a planets food. Her whip was in the fridge, and I used both damn buckets. Amongst the 50 campers in the age group, the two buckets were distributed. And then...... FAT came back.

She opened the fridge stared in disbelief and then looked up. Comprehension dawned upon her, and her chins began to quake in anger.

She said nothing, she was too shocked. I turned away, feeling victorious. After the kiddies were done, we put them down for their naps. I was feeling hungry, and I knew there was about 10-12 grilled cheese sandwiches left, so I was surprised when I turned around and there were none left.

I looked over to FAT sitting in the corner. She had 8 sandwiched piled in front of her and was going to town. I walked over and tried to grab a sandwich. Her hand shot out and slapped mine away.


FAT 'Oh look, the health freak wants a grilled cheese. You should have thought of that before you used my Cool Whip. (She pronounces it like Stewie from family guy) 

Me 'That cool whip was enough for 50 campers. Don't you think it's a little much to be eaten straight? How do you not feel sick? I'd throw up.'

FAT 'I'm sure you do that anyway.'

That hurt,but I didn't show it. I'd suffered from eating disorders throughout high school, and although I'm over it now, it is still a touchy subject for me. 

So I quickly grabbed half of a sandwich and jumped back before she could grab me again, tasting the gooey-ness that I thought was victory.

That is until later when I walked out and found a couple 2 liter bottles of Coke next to my car. They were empty and had been poured all over my car,which had attracted lots of bugs. My car is very sticky.

I wonder who did it."	t5_2vzax	True

Edit: Muh beetus was acting up when I wrote this. Fixed my bad math.

Will be long for background because there will be more.

I am a waiter and this story will be about the biggest consumption of calories, mystery numbers, and personal phobias.  Now, unlike what the movie *Waiting* will make you believe, wait staff do not mess with food for any rude customers. Our manager takes any recook/make out to the table for us.  We just talk shit in the back, laugh at the way people look at the tables, and yell it out walk-in.

Ready? Then here we go.

&gt; Be me: M 170 lbs 5'10""

&gt;Be doing waiting stuff, whoring out my personality for tips. Usual stuff.

&gt;Last 30 min of the night get sat with a 4 top.

&gt;Gotta make that $$

&gt;3 women averaging 7.5/10 who want waters. 4th is missing.

&gt; Go and get 3 waters, bread, and start apps.

&gt;Return to table to pass out stuffs.

&gt;In the time I was gone, something had managed to squeeze into the booth.

&gt;Female (maybe) with a yellow shirt.

&gt;Table sticking 6 inches into the folds.

&gt;Looked like Pac-Man was eating my table from the side.

&gt;Ask the ball what it wants to drink.

&gt;Mango tea. Unsweet, I'm trying to watch my calories. Tee muthafukin Hee

&gt;&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

&gt;It begins...

Now, I tell every person that our tea IS NOT brewed with mango, peach ect.  We have to add syrup.  This is not because I was trying to help with calorie counting, but making it and refills take a substantially long time.
&gt;""That's fine, it has no calories anyway.""

&gt;What part of 'syrup' didn't you hear?

&gt;Go to make it and head back to the table

&gt;I chat up the women while we wait for the food items. All giggles and shit.

&gt;Pac-Ham tries the cute fast blinking shit, reaches up, touches my arm and says ""Oh DrDeaf, you're hysterical!""

&gt;I visibly flinch and yank my arm back.

&gt;Go to my standard line of: I'm sorry sir/ma'am, but it really freaks me out when people touch me. Abusive figure in my live, ect ect ect.

&gt;Pac-Ham looks as if I slapped her.

&gt;Shrug it off, go and get the food.

&gt; Go back to check on them and everyone is fantastic. Except pac-ham. The first round of complaints has begun.

&gt;Take the food back and let the KM and GM deal with her food.

&gt;Start talking to the ladies again because we are 10 min after close and am finished with closing duties.

&gt;They start asking me about my personal life. Let it slip that I was single at the time and their eyes light up.

&gt;Except for pac-ham.

&gt;If looks could kill, I would have already been eaten.

&gt;Pac-ham's 2nd remake is finally here. Leave while she eats.

&gt;Talking to the table again when pac-ham breaks my no touching rule.

&gt;Me(M)Why did you touch me again/ I told you it makes me uncomfotrable.

&gt;Pac-ham(PH): You are ignoring me.

&gt;M: I'm sorry, I'm deaf in one ear and you are on that side. Can you repeat what you said?

&gt;PH: Bull-shit. I know you can hear me. You just want to talk to my friends.

&gt;M: Ma'am, I am 20 with my life ahead of me. What possible reason would I have to lie?

&gt;PH: You want to flirt with my friends. Now quit lying.

&gt;I pull off my hearing aids and hold them up to her.

&gt;M: See? I'm not lying.

&gt;Restart the conversation like a boss because it was too awkward.

&gt;PH just sitting there pouting.

&gt;Some time later in the flirting I hear: Men like curves, dogs like bones.

&gt;Was going to let it slide but she violated my only rule twice and called me a liar.

&gt;M: I'm sorry ma'am, did you just call me a dog?

&gt;PH: No. I just said dogs like bones.

&gt;M: I am not standing here in an attempt to try to get numbers or dates. This is my job. Because it is a social job, I can talk for however long I want provided I get my stuff done. Am I talking to your friends because I find them attractive? Partially. I like conversing with all my tables because it makes my night enjoyable and go faster.

&gt;Leave to get the checks separated.

&gt;Drop them off and start to wander around waiting.

&gt;See the nice ladies sign their name and write something else.

&gt;There is hope for numbers! 

&gt;Wait... It cant be.

&gt;PH is sticking around messing with all the books.

&gt;After she leaves, I go to check what she did.

&gt;My heart sinks.

&gt;PH ripped off the last 4 numbers of the other girls. I have area code and three more.

&gt;billymays.gif

&gt;There is more.

&gt;PH left her number.

&gt;That's right my fellow planets, she took the other 3 in the hopes I would call her.

On to the calorie count: Using my restaurant's online menu for help.
 She had 7 teas at 300 each, 2 *restaurant specific apps at 2000 each*, 3 Chicken fried steaks at 1,292 each. Not counting the sides or bread. She hit over 7000* calories.

**TL:DR** Planet abuses the system for free food. Calls me a dog. I call her out on it. Leaves her number anyway.

Let me ease your rustling.  One of them came back the next week. She saw me and asked why I didn't text anyone.  Told her what happened and got the original 3 numbers and the one of her friend she brought this time."	t5_2vzax	True

I witnessed all that happened, but the best way to experience this story is through his eyes. Sorry if weirdly written but the lord's work must be done

&gt;be Fishman

&gt;super athletic swimmer, pure muscle, almost no body fat, like 140lbs for being 5'10""

&gt;at school swim meet with other friends

&gt;not be Bertha, perfectly spherical fattie and known for her bad personality, probably around 5'7"" and 250

&gt;don't associate with Bertha much, as she's always in slower lanes

For those who don't know, at practices swim teams split people up by ability so that the fast kids aren't held back. It's all done very diplomatically and people usually aren't offended because they understand the logic behind it.
ANYWAY

&gt;just got to the pool, everyone organizing their stuff

&gt;Bertha up in the bleachers with her lardass dad, papa whale- no idea what she's up to

&gt;say she's no better than a dumb animal

&gt;storm off

&gt;take backpack and go to the benches, hungry as fuck, full of righteous anger

&gt;sit and wait for next race

&gt;10 events away (long enough to be boring but too short to go get food)

&gt;so...uh.... Bertha says you were bullying her

&gt;see Bertha coyly trying to ""hide"" behind coach

&gt;fat exposed on both sides

&gt;has shit eating grin on her porky red face

&gt;THAS RIGHT, FISHMAN WERS YELLIN' AT MEH

&gt;is this true, Fishman?

&gt;I nod

&gt;it was true

&gt;more or less

&gt;Bertha says you were making fun of her weight

&gt;nod again

&gt;you know Fishman, we don't tolerate bullying on this team

&gt;yessir

&gt;now please apologize to Bertha

&gt;shes been standing there this whole time with that stupid smile

&gt;switches to ""oh woe is me"" face as coach turns around

&gt;YEH FISHMAN APOLOGIZE

okay quick break just to clarify, Fishman could've totally apologized and just left it at that. But that's not how Fishman rolls. He demands justice.

&gt;I don't think so, she doesn't deserve one

&gt;coach sighs and rolls eyes

&gt;Why not, Fishman?

&gt;I only yelled at her because she ate all of my food

&gt;coach looks at Bertha. Starting to realize something is up

&gt;bitch is in shock

&gt;people don't usually stand up to her for fear of getting in trouble with the higher ups

&gt;nope

&gt;Wordlessly hand him the backpack full of wrappers

&gt;coach's eyes get wide

&gt;Bertha, did you eat all this?

&gt;AH WAS HUNGREH AND FISHMAN WASN'T EATING IT ANYWAY

&gt;coach looks through backpack with a mixture of amazement and disgust

&gt;looks at me like he's seen a ghost

&gt;a fatass monster of a ghost

&gt;How much did this cost, Fishman?

&gt;Tell him like 70 bucks, give or take

&gt;coach looks back at Bertha

&gt;Confusion and annoyance replaced by fiery anger rivaling that of a hundred fatties denied second breakfast

&gt;you ate 70 bucks worth of Fishmans food without asking?!?

&gt;Berthas lip begins to tremble

&gt;sends shockwaves rippling through her chins

&gt;AH WAS JURST HUNGREH

&gt;STOP PICKEN ON MEH

&gt;coach stares at the backpack

&gt;looks back at Bertha

&gt;visibly shaking

&gt;even I'm a little afraid of coach in a bad mood

&gt;eyes full of fury, voice low and dangerous

&gt;Bertha, what happened to the food you brought?

&gt;AH ATE IT EARLIYAH

&gt;hfw he realizes she was eating before warmups

&gt;Must've been what she was doing in the bleachers

&gt;explains why she was having so much trouble swimming

&gt;coach has no words

&gt;none at all

&gt;tells her I don't have to apologize

&gt;tells her that she has to pay me back

&gt;sweet success

&gt;too sweet, she ate it

&gt;MAH DADDY GONNA HUR ABOUT THIS

&gt;turns away and waddles furiously up to bleachers where papa whale sitting

&gt;fat rolls jiggle as she trundles up steps

&gt;starts crying and gesticulating wildly at papa whale, then at me, then points at the coach

&gt;I watch in horror as papa whale attempts to get up

&gt;bastard must be at least 450 lbs

&gt;barely mobile

&gt;no idea how he even got up there

&gt;takes 10 minutes to get off the bleachers, gotta wait for women and children to evacuate while the menfolk try and help him down

&gt;wish I was kidding

&gt;papa whale yells at the coach to come over to him by the bleachers

&gt;coach refuses, says he has to watch the races from up close to get splits

&gt;Kinda not true but papa whale don't know shit

&gt;papa whale rests for a couple minutes before making his way over

&gt;I dip out

&gt;lolnope I wish, Bertha demands I stay

&gt;fuckmylife

&gt;Bertha repeats her sob story, glaring at me the whole time

&gt;wants me to be kicked off the team

&gt;demands I apologize and grovel at her feet

&gt;coach rolls eyes so much I'm afraid they'll fall out

&gt;everyone else on the team is watching now

&gt;papa whale nods along with everything Bertha says

&gt;interjects occasionally with ""that's right sweetie""

&gt;oh did I mention he took one of the chairs someone had been sitting on, shoved all their stuff off (including homework, food, swim stuff) and onto the wet ground

&gt;everyone else on the team now staring intently

&gt;person whose stuff got thrown on the ground glaring so hard they haven't blinked

&gt;Bertha starts bitching about how I've made a scene

&gt;FISHMAN JURST WANTS TER EMBURUSS MEH

&gt;at this point I'm ready to apologize just to get it over with

&gt;papa whale will have none of it

&gt;tells coach either they kick me off the team or Bertha and her siblings quit

&gt;coach completely silent

&gt;everyone hoping they quit

&gt;papa whale realizes he has no leverage as goes for a different angle

&gt;says he'll call the school get coach in trouble

&gt;coach just doesn't answer, stares at Bertha and papa whale in disbelief

&gt;suddenly comes back to reality, looks at me

&gt;Fishman, do you have any witnesses?

&gt;yeah, Skinnybro and Hairbro

&gt;they've been watching the whole time, stand up and explain to coach what they saw

&gt;other kids on the team back them up, even ones who don't like me

&gt;Bertha goes full on ballistic

&gt;YER ALL JURST BULLIES

&gt;YUH PEOPLE AH MEAN TO ME CAUZ AHM DIFFURNT

&gt;FISHMAN IS JURST MAD BECAZ HE HAS A CRUSH ON ME BUT AHM TOO GOOD FOR HIM

&gt;what

&gt;aw hell no

&gt;everyone shaking their heads

&gt;no words

&gt;did she really just try that

&gt;it's starting to dawn on papa whale that this is a losing battle

&gt;struggles to pull himself off the chair he shanghaied

&gt;poor thing looks like it's been to hell and back

&gt;crumples shortly after he gets up

&gt;goodnight, sweet prince

&gt;papa whale motions for Bertha to follow

&gt;they both eventually make it up to the bleachers

&gt;papa whale gets out a duffle bag,  pulls out candy bars and soda

&gt;oh have I mentioned that's food the coach banned us from eating at meets?

&gt;they both have a post-argument feast

&gt;gotta replenish dem calories burned up from walking 30 feet and talking

&gt;never got refunded on food

&gt;coach gets a call from the school a couple hours later

&gt;say they want to talk to me and are considering disciplinary action

&gt;coach told them he'd deal with it

&gt;says it's under control

&gt;tells me to not talk to Bertha for the rest of the meet

&gt;stay outta trouble

&gt;apologizes that he can't help more

&gt;she and papa whale end up leaving early anyway

&gt;They take the ferry home because papa whale can't do planes

&gt;Mfw it turns out she had no events and was only there because papa whale brought her

TL;DR: disgusting fatty and known instigator Bertha eats all 70 bucks worth of my friends food while he's racing, is completely unrepentant, gets fatass dad involved, ends up leaving and calls the school to get my friend in trouble when they both realize no one's on their side

I have many, many more stories of Bertha and her shittiness, if anyone's interested

1367793710.0	1dr89u	Women make terrible blind-date decisions	wild-tangent	543	109	120	"So I was single for a spell, and hating it. I decided halfway through that it might not be a bad idea for a friend of mine to set me up on a few blind dates.

My criteria was ""attractive, smart, and single."" She said she'd set something up.

**********

Date one: I show up, I'm dressed a bit above casual. 

She, on the other hand, had an enormous belly and arms- the fat literally hung over her elbows, but the rest of her was relatively normal-sized. I said I'd already eaten, so instead of eating food, we went for a walk. She repeatedly kept asking me to slow down in my walk- I wasn't walking fast, I wasn't even walking normal pace. I tried to shoot the shit and just take it easy, but it was apparently too much for her.

She sat down on a park bench. I remained standing. She patted the bench. ""You have to take a break sometimes, relax, take things easy, it won't be good for you, all this moving around.""

Wat.

I left shortly after.

**********

I went back home, hopped online. ""Look, no offense, but I didn't find her attractive.' I hoped that that was hint enough- no more fat chicks, please.

Date 2: Different girl. It was supposed to be a picnic at a park. She was about ten pounds lighter than the previous woman- one of those indeterminable ages, between 18 and 45 that fat women get when they've pulled their hair into a bun so tight it distorts their facial features, and the rest so little resembles anything human that you can't even begin to guess. She was just...shapes. Shapes wearing drapes.

She was the only one at the park. I had called my old friend from grade school, told him to call me back in ten minutes. I sat and chatted briefly- just long enough for her to say ""oh you're so cute I could gobble you up and hold you,"" and for me to begin to sweat bullets that perhaps my friend had forgotten to call me, when my phone went off. I told him I was 'on my way, don't drink anything, I'll bring the mop.'

She looked at me like a kicked puppy. ""I don't have a ride home.""

*Howthefuckdidyougethere.jpg*

""Okay, I'll take you home, hop in, I've gotta go though.""

Her home was two blocks from the park.

**********

Third date, I asked beforehand to see a picture of her. Dear lord, she was *enormous.* I called my friend and asked if/why she thought I'd find her attractive. She finally admitted ""I don't know what you find attractive, okay? You're not some stupid shallow meathead, so I thought you weren't shallow, that you'd look past it, they're great people-"" at that point I just completely tuned her out and went onto OKCupid. Which has its own series of FPS's, of which I've published one already.

There was no Date 3."	t5_2vzax	True

(Long but drama-y)"	pipluppop	557	128	68	"Hey FPS! I just can't get enough of writing stories for you guys.... I have so many, and I did spend a year with [Oiltank](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1je43j/mt_first_fps_in_which_a_scandinavian_whale_fails/)

Ok so the first story I gave you here was about Oiltank, but this one happens before that one (sorry for being confusing) =( .

&gt;Be me, little spaniard, short as shit, slim, but carrying about 10lb cos its just been xmas guise, gimme a break :( 

&gt;Not be oiltank. Huge Scandinavian whale that got past the harpoons. Shitty personality, named oiltank because of resemblance to stacked oildrums. 

&gt;Not be Muffin and Icecube two hawt scandinavian guys who throw arrsum parties. 

&gt;Not be group of beautiful scandinavian women.
(notable three in this story are Whitewhine Toopretty and Zelda)

&gt;Not be assface. My bff's (then) bf. 

At this point, Toopretty is dating Icecube, I have my wonderful bf who is in sweden at this point and Oiltank has been having sex with guys about 4 years her junior, oh and turkish, she sometiems drags them to these parties and has awkward makeout sessions with them. 

&gt;Be at gym with beautiful sexy ladies
&gt;Oh and someone brought their pet elephant

Nawh it's cool, just oiltank, trick of the light there. 

We're all working out because it's just been christmas and we are all pudgy. At least everyone is working out but oiltank. 

&gt;""GUISE WAIT I NEED A SNACK, MY KNEES HURT FROM THE CLIMB"" 

The climb being the three flights of stairs to the gym. 
&gt;""HOW COME I GET SO FAT AFTER CHRISTMAS, NO ONE WILL RECOGNISE ME COS I'M SO FAT""

&gt;implying that she wasn't fat before. 

&gt;""I'M NOT GOING TO DO WEIGHTS BECAUSE THEN I'LL BE ALL FREAKY AND MUSCULAR LIKE YOU, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR BOYFRIEND LIKES MUSCULAR WOMEN"" 

I am not muscular in the slightest. 

Everyone just kinda leaves her anyway and goes to get shit done. Muffin and Icecube have another glorious party planned so we wanna squeeze this workout in before getting beautimus (shut up you watch honey boo boo too, no way you would miss out on that beetus). 

I have to take the cross trainer because my knees are fucked and treadmills are bad for this. Sadly you can easymode on a crosstrainer so I am stuck with oiltank. 

&gt;""PIPLUP THERE ARE GONNA BE SO MANY HOT GUYS THERE TONIGHT WHICH ONE SHALL I CHOOSE"" 

...&gt;implying that options will be open. 

&gt;""I dunno Oiltank, anyone who's willing maybe?""

&gt;""TEEHEE PIPLUP THAT DOESN'T NARROW IT DOWN VERY MUCH""

She gets out a granola bar, omg she's actually got a healthy snack :3 go you oiltank! Oh ok, maybe two is.. is ok. Three? Well that's... that's pushing it a bit. 

She had four. oh well. 

At this point Whitewine walks over. Whitewine has a crush on Muffin. I'm close with Muffin and I know he likes her too. I have been a bit of a harry potter owl between the two, they're both super attractive, super cute and super shy. He's really nervous around girls and she's bubbly and a bit outgoing but not when it comes to him, any show of affection has taken a big while to build up. GUESS WHAT OILTANK WANTS TO RUIN GUYS. 

Whitewine says hey, and asks me to help her with the rowing machine, Oiltank waddles after us saying that she'll sit on the machine next to us because she's tired. Want to talk to Whitewhine about muffin. I HAVE MORE MESSAGES TO DELIVER, but whatevr, no one cares if the hambeast hears, right? 

&gt;""SO WHITEWINE ARE YOU GONNA SLUT ALL OVER MUFFIN LIKE YOU DID LAST PARTY"" 

Whitewine has never been slutty, most she has done is kiss him on the cheek to say goodnight. 

&gt;""oh...um...I hope'd he be there..."" 

&gt;""YEAH ME TOO I'M GONNA BRING HIM HOME TONIGHT"" 

Whitewine looks like she's about to cry. I'm extremely alpha at this stage in my life. 

&gt;""No you won't Oiltank, he's made it clear he likes Whitewine, he's not the kind of gu to scrape the bottom of a barrel at a party""

&gt;""OH MY GOD PIPLUP HE'S A GUY. GUYS LIKE TO HAVE SEX. IF HE WANTED HER HE WOULD HAVE HAD SEX WITH HER"" 

&gt;""he's not like that Oiltank, he's a nice guy""

Toopretty comes over and tells Oiltank to move her ass off the rowing machine cos she needs it. Toopretty is alpha and awesome, and openly loathes Oiltank, Toopretty is a business minded woman who doesn't take shit. Oiltanks tarts whalesong about how machine is the only seat. 

&gt;Toopretty - ""move your huge ass and sit on the floor then, I think these machines have weight limits""

Oiltank is smart, and realises that if she is mean to toopretty then she will lose any possible way of spending time with Muffin, Muffin and Icecube live together and Toopretty would not tolerate her presence. So she's in full kiss ass mode. 

&gt;""OH OF COURSE TOOPRETTY, NOT LIKE YOU NEED TO WORK OUT THOUGH, THESE GIRLS ARE ALL REALLY FAT SINCE CHRISTMAS"" 

Yes, we've all moved from an Xsmall to a small, I guess once you get past XXXXL you stop counting you fat bitch. But before I can say anything, Oiltank has teeheed her way out of the room saying that she's done her workout for the day so she can run off and dress to impress Muffin. 

I'm left with Whitewine.

&gt;""Piplup, what if she gets him so drunk he kisses her or something""
&gt;""Whitewine, you KNOW muffin isn't that kind of guy, he likes you, just give him time, anyway he told me to tell you he can't wait to see you tonight"".


FAST FORWARD TO THE PARTAY. 

I am greeted with snuggles and stuff. I have used the sunny Mediterranean to warm the hearts of these vikings, they greet me with hugs and besos now. &lt;3 plus they're all really tall and i'm probably about the height of a soft toy, they enjoy picking me up. I know how my cat feels. 

I'm early cos I offer to help set up, Toopretty and ice cube tell me that they're hiding the food til Oiltank is distracted or she'll just eat all of it. Last time she literally ATE ALL OF THE ICE IN THE FREEZER. 

I see Muffin, and tell him that Whitewine is definitely coming. He gets all excited (n'awhhh) and forces me to go help him pick a cologne. Squeeing like a little girl. Omg u guise they would be so cute together. 

Unfortunately, with me in his room (he's topless as he's spraying this shit everywhere and is still deciding on clothing) Oiltank walks in, and you have to walk past Muffin's room to get to the main room. Let me just tell you what she chose to wear. A gawf/emo skirt that shoudl probably have been a belt, self ripped fishnet tights and a ""corset"" (hot topic t shirt corset shit things) all in at least 4 sizes too small. Tasty. 

&gt;""OH MY GOD PIPLUP YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, STOP USING AFTERSHAVE TO GET RID OF THE SEX SMELL, GIVE ME YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW I'M TELLING YOUR BOYFRIEND""

&gt;""shut up Oiltank I'm helping him pick cologne"" 

&gt;""IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU KNOW WHITEWINE LIKES HIM HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO HER YOU ARE SO CRUEL, GET OUT OF THE ROOM"" 

Yeah, from the girl who just said she was going to try to fuck Muffin? Yeah, I'm sure you care so much about her. I'm so annoyed though that I stupidly miss Oiltank's plan, the second I get out of his room she SHOVES me aside and slams the door in my face. Think whatever, Muffin is an atheltic guy, he can handle himself if she gets nasty. 

Icecube throws a glowstick at my head and tells me he needs help with the glowsticks. Glowsticks are glowy and they distract me easily. Many people arrive, say hi, get more cuddles, get tossed around more like a baby seal in a pack of attractive orcas, get more glowsticks dangerously close to my eyes, and then whitewine arrives. 

&gt;""hey piplup! is muffin still getting ready?"" 

Ohgodmuffin
oh god no where is he. 

&gt;Run to muffin's room
&gt;throw door open
&gt;why can't I unsee things, why is this not a skill. 

DON'T WORRY GUYS, NOTHING BAD YET. Apart from Muffin had locked himself in his en suite bathroom, and Oiltank was topless and begging him in their language and crying. How do i deal with this situation in a calm, sensible and rational manner. 

LoljkI'mspanish. 

&gt;""OILTANK WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING. WHAT EVEN IS THIS"" 

She spins around and I am faced with two uneven mounds of white flab. The only mercy is that the nipples were pointing so far down I barely even saw them. 

&gt;""PUT SOME FUCKING CLOTHES ON"" 

&gt;""BUT PIPLUP HE TOLD ME HE WANTED ME AND THEN I TRIED TO TOUCH HIM AND HE LOCKED HIMSELF AWAY, HE USED MEEEEEEEEEE"" and she starts crying.

Of course this draws attention and TooPretty storms in. The music must be mercifully loud as she shouts she only heard cos she's walking to the bathroom. She deals with this wailing whale better than I ever could. Without a word she stuffs Oiltanks clothes in to her hand, stares her down and waits for Oiltank to re dress herself, then she knocks sharply on Muffin's bathroom door and tells him to get out because he's going to miss his own party. 

At this point I haven't consumed any fucking alcohol and it's only 10pm. How the fuck did this become my life. 

I get the fine job of talking to Oiltank, telling her that no one believes that she has been used by Muffin. She tells me she's sorry because she's already ""really"" drunk and she fucked up. She says she ""needs takeaway food"" to soak up the alcohol, so to give the party some space from her, I go with her. I think that everyone needs to cool off a bit. 

Through bites of a huge kebab on the way back to the party, we have a great conversation.

&gt;""YOU KNOW IF HE'D RAPED ME NO ONE WOULD CARE BECAUSE I'M FAT"" 

&gt;""Oiltank, yes they would. But you don't know that because it hasn't happened to you"" 

&gt;""I DON'T NEED IT TO, I CAN'T CHANGE WHO I AM, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU WERE RAPED AND NO ONE CARED BECAUSE YOU'RE SPANISH?"" 

That fucking race/fat comparison annoyed me so much, so I just stayed icy and silent, and tried to get back to my friends. 

Muffin is out at this point, smelling and looking fabulous, and sits on the sofa, Whitewine notices and they're sat giggling and sharing a drink, she's kind of half sat on him. I miss my bf. INTERNAL SOBS. But seriously I'm really happy for them. Oiltank is staring daggers at them and notices I'm looking dreamily at them. 

She says to me in a really weird voice ""I'm going to tell him she's a whore, then he'll want a real woman"" honestly I kinda ignore her, we know whitewine is not a whore. What possible way could she make anyone think otherwise? Hambeasts have their ways. 

Massive quantities of alcohol are consumed, everyone is close to wasted, Muffin and Whitewine have exchanged a couple of nervous adorable kisses, I have pillow fought strangers while riding on icecube's shoulders and so far nothing is broken. 

Then some turkish guy comes in. After general wtfing it all becomes blatantly clear. 
&gt;""OH MY GOOOOD TURKISHGUYYYYYYYYY!"" 

She like tongue kisses this random guy in front of everyone and then spends a load of time booty grinding this guy no one knows. She;s like dancing with him in front of Muffin, and grabbs this turkish guy's ass and everything It's kinda awkward even when drunk, and then she drags turkishguy over to muffin and whitewine. 

&gt;""HEEEEEYYYY MUFFIN, I SEE YOU'RE STARING AT BOYFRIEND, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE JEALOUS"" 

Turkish guy mumbles something
&gt;""not boyfriend, just sex"" 

OH BOY this is gonna be good. 

&gt;""JUST IGNORE HIM, HE LIKES TO JOKE, DON'T YOU"" 

Oiltank then reaches down and like.. tickles turkishguy's crotch. Vomit. 

Whitewne must have had a grossed out look on her face because oiltank said this. 
&gt;""OH DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT WHITEWINE, A REAL WOMAN LIKE ME KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A GUY, PLUS, WE ALL KNOW YOUVE BEEN AROUND EVERY GUY IN THIS ROOM, OH SORRY WAS I NOT MEANT TO TELL EVERYONE THAT TEEHEE"" 

Oiltank is told to stfu, and stop being a jealous whale, but guys, she has PROOF that whitewine is a whore, and she pulls out her phone, and shows everyone a load of messages from a contact with whitewine's name, and thrusts it in to some guy's hand.

Whitewine begins to cry as these vulgar, obviously fake messages are passed around. Whitewine mistakes the drunk laughter at Oiltank's stupidity for laughter at her, and runs out of the room, and the house, crying :/ Toopretty goes after her, and tells Muffin to just let her sort it out. Sadly I don't see either again for the rest of the night. Muffin looks devastated and Oiltank looks triumphant. I can't contain myself

&gt;""YOU SPITEFUL FAT BITCH, HOW DARE YOU"" 

&gt;""SHUT UP PIPLUP, WOMEN GOTTA DO WHAT THEY GOTTA DO TO GET WHAT THEY WANT, MUFFIN WANTS ME AND I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM ME""

Hear quiet response. What did you say Muffin?

&gt;""I said I wouldn't have sex with you if you were the last person on earth. Fuck this party"". 

Muffin, looking defeated gets up and walks away. I know Muffin, I know he needs this time alone, but that's not good enough for Oiltank. As Muffin is walking to his room she chases him, I follow, and she's about to grab his arm when.....

We see in to the spare room, and there's two people on the bed. It's Assface, and Zelda. Now before this point, Assface had always been the white knight for Oiltank. He knew things were going bad with my bff and was putting his eggs in other baskets. He would need someone to have sex with when they broke up, so he'd been leading Oiltank on. 

Oiltank drops all caring about Muffin. Assface, in bed, with another woman? 

""ASSFACE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND"" 

Zelda jumps up and screams "" YOU HAVE A FUCKING GIRLFRIEND?"" 

&gt;""YES I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND"" 

Then who the fuck is that turkish guy eating all our pizza. 

Before assface can explain FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS EVENING, a pretty girl is running out of this house in tears. Party not very successful. 

&gt;""I SAID THAT SO SHE WOULD LEAVE, ASSFACE, I NEEEED YOU"" 

Staying true to his backup plan assface is a shoulder to cry on. At this point I'm not fucking leaving them alone. This asshole is dating my best friend, so I sit with them and put up with the fcking whalesong. 

She's crying about how if she were slim Muffin would want her, and how if she were slim no one would treat her badly. She's saying that fat girls have to work so much harder to be loved. She's saying that thin people have so much advantage and she'd never be able to change herself to be like them. She's quietly crying this time, and saying she doesn't know how she got this drunk, and it must be because she doesn't eat and she's so ""small"".

Assface tells her to sleep over. I tell assface I'm gonna ask muffin to sleep on his floor. I don't fucking trust him not to cheat on my bff. 

I then spend the whole night talking to Muffin til we fall asleep. He's really sad and disappointed and angry that he didn't run after Whitewine. It feels really weird to read back over these events and I wonder why we didn't do more to stop it happening. My only excuse is that we were really really drunk :( 

Sorry if this one was too long guys! But do not worry, this is not the end for Muffin and Whitewine. Next installment will be THE PICNIC. "	t5_2vzax	True

**Chapter Fifteen**

We made our way to the restaurant without much incident, though my eardrums will never be the same. Early on, I had made it clear that I was *not* to be distracted while driving, and the threat of an automobile accident seemed enough to keep Porcina largely in line. The conversation – dominated by the portly one – had ranged from manga to pornography, though any time a particularly racy subject had arisen, Porcina would playfully squeak “Oops!” and glance over her shoulder at Lauren.

I suspected that some ground rules had been laid, and I wasn't complaining.

Towards the end of our journey, I had almost managed to tune out Porcina's voice. Even my intense irritation had given way to something rather like serenity (though I doubted if any Zen masters used images of flamethrowers and upbeat mandolin music in their meditation). The time alone inside my head led me to moments of odd reflection. Was this really the same girl who had managed to arouse me with her antics? In the span of a little over a week, I had begun a sublime transformation. Perhaps I had Lauren to thank, or maybe it was Porcina herself, but for whatever reason, the sexual comments and suggestive remarks evoked only apathy in me.

“Why don't you guys get out,” I suggested, pulling up alongside our destination. “Parking is a bit tricky around here, and I don't want to make you guys walk.” If I'm honest, I had planned on Porcina's laziness coming into play, and I wasn't disappointed.

“Don't be *laaaaaaate*,” she simpered, hauling herself from my car. Aaron followed soon after, and to my delight, Lauren decided to stay.

“I'll keep you company,” she offered, moving to the passenger seat. “We'll see you guys in a minute!”

Without waiting for a response, I pulled away from the restaurant. For a brief moment, I considered the idea of driving onwards, past any parking spaces, and finding somewhere else to eat with Lauren.

“I know what you're thinking,” she suddenly said.

The timing took me by surprise. “Really?” I challenged, wondering if she did.

“You're wondering what Aaron sees in Porcina. Or what she sees in him.”

I *had* been wondering that, though not since several minutes before. From what I had been able to gather, Aaron was a boy prepossessed by awkwardness, wholly capable of making conversation, yet almost consciously choosing the wrong things to say. On the rare occasions when he had spoken in complete sentences, they had seemed almost fiendishly insightful... and then, with his next breath, he would mutter something inane, and tug at each of his facial hairs as though reaffirming their existence. I had theorized that he was suffering from Tourette syndrome, but without anyone to confirm – and I wasn't about to ask – I couldn't be certain.

Porcina, on the other hand, had been the same as always, switching back and forth between bouts of affected, childish sweetness and entitled commentary. There had been a point, halfway through the drive, when she'd seemed on the verge of another tantrum, so invoked by her discovery that I didn't care for her taste in comic books.

“You *have* to like them!” she had screamed, slamming her fist into the door. “They're *good*, and you *have* to like them! Manga is the ultimate art! You *have* to like them, you *have* to!” Judging by Lauren's sympathetic smile, offered discreetly via my rear-view mirror, I wagered that she'd heard variations of this tirade before.

“Well,” I said to Lauren, returning to the moment at hand, “they don't seem compatible, but I guess love is blind?”

“They met at Anime Club,” explained Lauren, “after Porcina asked out another member.”

“And they've been together *how* long?”

Lauren counted on her fingers. “Almost three years, if you count this past one.”

I would have loved to converse with her further, but an empty parking space presented itself only seconds later. With some resignation, I pulled into the spot, wishing that the distance between there and the restaurant had been greater. I doubted if I'd get much time alone with Lauren that evening, and I was trying to make the most of the few moments that we had.

The two of us walked at a fairly slow pace, but even so, our time together - with nobody else - was all too short. We made it to our destination and were greeted by our dating duo.

“It's *cooooooold*!” complained Porcina.

“I told you to bring a coat,” Lauren answered. “Why didn't you just go inside?”

“They said we had to *waaaaait* until *you guys* got here.”

“Well, we're now,” I said, perhaps with excessive curtness. I opened the door for Lauren, only to have Porcina rush ahead.

“They're here!” she declared, her tone back to one of aggression. “Give us our table!”

How can one adequately describe an utter calamity? What words can capture the feeling of bearing witness to an explosion, somehow played in slow motion, that consumes the lives of all it reaches? The scene that befell that poor establishment will no doubt live in infamy, repeated in hushed whispers like a legend in the dark.

The restaurant was a buffet.

Stacks of flatbread made their way from silver platters to Porcina's hands. She insisted on sampling every entree, splashing sauce far and wide and she waddled from one side of the restaurant to the other. She was admonished more than once for forgoing the use of serving spoons, leading to unhappy staff members having to replace entire dishes of food. Glares were leveled at our table from every booth and table, and I watched as more than one patron called a waiter to complain. Lauren and I stole what precious seconds we could to converse, though we were always overseen by Aaron's constantly shifting eyes. (He never left his seat. Not once. Granted, Porcina foisted enough food on him to feed a small army, always with cries of “Try this! It's so *creamy*!”) It was indescribable, and when she was finally sated, Porcina wiped her hands on the velvet drapes.

I was mortified. *I* had wrought this horror upon the innocent establishment, and in doing so, had ruined the meal for scores of their guests. There was no way I could pay for all the damage that was done, nor in any way make up for the mental scars inflicted.

Our check came promptly.

Then came another... which was placed before Porcina.

“What's *this*?” she demanded, snatching the offending paper.

“Bill,” the waiter answered, then hurried off.

“I'm not paying this!” she spat, throwing the paper at the floor. I stooped to retrieve it, and marveled at what I saw. Every ruined pan of food was listed, as was a cleaning charge for the curtains. A dozen acronyms followed, each with a monetary value. Some of them, I suspected, had been invented on the fly... but even if they were fictitious, they were well and truly justified.

“You *are* paying this.” Was that *my* voice?

“No!” Porcina pouted.

“*YES*.” It was definitely me, though I wasn't in control. I felt myself standing, my eyes locked on Porcina. “You are getting out your envelope, and you are *leaving* it here. I've seen how much you carry; I know you can afford it. You have made a *travesty* of what *should have been* a pleasant evening, and you are going to *pay for it*.” Who, I wondered, was this man that had taken control of my voice? “You have *thirty seconds*, or I'm going to get *mad*.”

There was silence it the restaurant (though it had started to empty out, so that might not be as impressive as it sounds). With a sense of creeping horror, I realized what I had done. Porcina's previous tantrums would be *nothing* compared to what I had just invoked. I was sure of it. I braced myself for the restaurant's demolition.

Porcina glared at me, her eyes slowly squinting... and then, she looked away. “Psh. Fine. I'll just get *more* money tomorrow.” With disbelief, I watched as she pulled forth her white envelope and slapped it on the table. The total, I would later learn, amounted to over four hundred dollars. Enough to cover the damage, all of our meals, and a healthy tip besides.

“Come on,” I said, fully exiting the booth. “We're leaving.” I took the envelope from the table and handed it to a waiter, along with our bills. “I'm incredibly sorry,” I said to him. Then, I took my own bankroll – a paltry sum of forty, made up of two lone bills – and offered it, as well. “I hope this makes up for some of your trouble.”

He thanked me. I felt terrible.

I drove home, my companions in tow, with my lips pressed firmly shut. Porcina tried to laugh away the spectacle from moments before. Lauren expressed her intense displeasure. Aaron plucked at his chin. Later that night, I would hear that Porcina's behavior that night had been the worst that anyone had ever seen, the theory being that she had been trying to get a rise out of me.

It had worked. It had also, I would discover some months later, resulted in Porcina been banned from that restaurant for life. A picture of her – taken by a quick-thinking chef – still adorns the back of the hostess' podium. 

We arrived at the townhouse not a moment too soon. I didn't bother bidding anyone goodbye... at least, not until Lauren made it known that she would be hanging behind for a moment. She waited for Porcina and her boyfriend to be out of sight, then sat down beside me and took my hand.

“I am so, so sorry,” Lauren said.

“I'm an asshole.”

Lauren tilted her head to one side. “Well, Mister Asshole, you did a decent impression of Porcina's dad back there. He's one of the nicest men I know.” Oddly enough, I mused, it had been a decent impression of *my* father, as well, though only after he had been sufficiently provoked by some legitimate injustice. “Don't worry about the money,” Lauren continued. “She's right: She'll get more as soon as she asks. Her parents mail those envelopes to her at least once a week.”

“That's stupid,” I replied. Everyone, or so I thought, knew better than to send cash by post.

“They can afford it.”

“I didn't mean... forget it.” I exhaled, then took a long breath. “I've lost my temper before. In public, even. This isn't a new behavior for me, Lauren.” Another breath. I felt my insides shaking. “I've yelled at people. Shouted them down. I've caused bigger scenes than the one that you saw.” Granted, I couldn't think of a specific instance, but it felt like an accurate statement. “I'm the one who should apologize. I could have waited two more weeks to take you out, but I was impatient.” I hung my head a little lower. “I guess I ruined any chances of a second date, huh?”

A moment passed in stillness, and then Lauren replied.

“I don't know about that.”

My face shot up so fast, my eyebrows nearly entered orbit. “What?”

Lauren gave me a smile, one that dredged the fathoms of my heart and brought out something wonderful. “Like I said before,” she stated, “you seem like a decent guy.”

“I...” I stuttered, my throat choked with emotion. “I'm trying to be.” I sniffed once, feeling some moisture in my eyes. (Indian food is spicy. Shut up.) “That was pretty lame, wasn't it?”

“Not at all,” said Lauren. “So... I'll see you in two weeks?” She squeezed my hand affectionately.

“I can hardly wait.” I squeezed her hand back.

“Me, neither,” Lauren replied.

It wasn't much, but it was something. Something to remember. Something to hold on to, for my two-week-long wait.

Then, Lauren kissed me... and suddenly the wait didn't seem so long at all.

It took me 2 months to get used to the random back scratches an awesome co-worker does. Almost elbowed her in the face the first time.  I worked hard to allow the occasional hand on shoulder and taps on the back.  What happened today completely destroyed my progress.

This is not the usual tale.  This is a tale about what happens when planets don't get their food.  Forgive any mistakes. This happened 5 hours ago, I am still shaking and drinking to calm my nerves. Thank the Great Beetus for chrome spelling.

&gt;Get sat with a planet family.

&gt;Four of them take 2 of my 3 tables by pushing them together.

&gt;Alpha planet is around 500ish.

&gt;Takes up the 3 feet of space between the table and wall.

&gt;Have to walk 50 feet around to get from one side of the table to the other.

&gt;Or, try to squeeze by and rub my junk against his neck.

Thought about it..... Valued my fingers too much.

&gt;Tell him it will be a 'Warm red center'.
&gt;He says yes

&gt;Make the mistake of asking how his meal was.

&gt;Trip over my tray and fall over.

Clarification: I can handle crowded spaces. Shoulder bumps in a bar, body on body contact.  I don't like people reaching out to touch me. (Bullied as a kid)

&gt;Assistant Manager and Key saw what happened.

&gt;AM handles the planet.

&gt;Key takes me back into the walk-in to calm down.

&gt;Sit on a keg and zone out.

So, from what I was told, I was in the walk-in for about an hour.  In that time, the AM called the police.  The planet was 'removed from the  premises'.  An officer sat with me in the walk-in for about 30 min asking questions and talking about possible charges.  My General Manager (fucking awesome guy) was called in.  He sat with me and just waited.  Ended up giving me Thursday, Friday, and Saturday paid leave to calm down.

TL;DR: Planet gets physically violent. Police are called. I freak the fuck out. Awesome Manager is still fucking awesome. I'm drinking myself to sleep.

Edit: Spelling mistakes. I will press charges.  Should be a really easy case with all the witnesses. Off to get any injuries documented. "	t5_2vzax	True

Everybody was surprised as she wasn't the usual ""attractive-but-not-imposing"" type of associate that my former employer would typically hire. She was a solid 200lbs overweight, with greying unkept hair, yet still in her early 40s. Soon she became known for consuming an entire box of Oreos during every shift and doing so in full view of customers and managers. However, what truely made her infamous was her petulant attitude and her constant mention of her MBA (even though she works an entry level sales associate job). One day at work she relays to me that although she had ""let herself go"" since her previous relationship, she was back on the dating scene. She proceeded to show me a dating site profile with only two photographs, both from her graduation in 1992, when a row boat could suport her weight, and her list of potential suitors. She happily told me that she had a date lined up for that evening. The gentleman in question looked like a normal 30 year old, nerdy enough to be dating online and naive enough to not realize he was about to meet a 350lbs oreo-devouring monster rather than a healthy-sized college girl. I had a good laugh imagining the date.
Fastfoward a couple months and I am working as a hostess at a somewhat upscale restaurant downtown and see her arrive with a huge grin on her face. She greets me and explains that she is here early for a date, that they met on the dating site, and that even if he isn't as cute as she expects him to be, at least she will be getting a free meal. I am watching her table when I see a server bring out two massive slices of cake, each with two scoops of icecream and whipped cream, some soda, and some beer. She wolfs everything down as though she hadn't eaten in years. After the feeding frenzy was over she requested all the dishes be removed from her table promptly. Five minutes later a 30-something year old guy walks right past her table, since the photo she provided was 20 years old, and up to the hostess stand and asks me if ""there is a young lady here waiting to meet somebody"", I immediatly start to shake my head when suddenly I realized the horrible fate that awaited this guy. I state that we do have somebody waiting and escort him to her table. As she loudly greets him she waves her arms in the air shaking her arm fat to and frow. He looks at me with an expression that can only be described as ""KILL ME NOW, PLEASE"", but sits down quietly. 
My shift ended and I left but I can only image his reaction when he got the bill and it included 2 $10 slices of cake a la mode."	t5_2vzax	True

Sorry its been a while since my last Hamgar story, but finals draw nigh and I don't have very much spare time.  However, I am happy to say that shit went down in class at the end of last week and this saga will have a suitably epic ending.  For now though, here is another tale from earlier in the semester.

&gt;Be five or six weeks into semester

&gt;Class is about to start, no sign of Hamgar

&gt;Maybe he ate himself into a coma

&gt;Door bows outward as incredible gravitational force is applied

&gt;Wouldn'tbesolucky.jpeg

&gt;Hamgar enters followed by his usual stench of day old mayo, coagulated grease and the poor, decomposing cat that he sat on and smothered with his fat folds 

&gt;However, he has come late and the back row has filled up

&gt;Hamgar's usual spot is taken by a girl who had recently sprained her ankle, her crtuches are learning against the desk next to her

&gt;Hamgar stops short, aghast that the back row is filled

&gt;Waddles over to the girl and tells he to move, she is in his seat

&gt;No one in class like Hamgar, but the poor girl is pretty shy and was about to move

&gt;Ex-marine sitting in seat next to her tells her to stay, Hamgar can find another seat

&gt;Hamgar informs the marine he can't take the stairs cause of his disability

&gt;Marine stares right into the little flint black pits that serve as Hamgar's food finders and says ""Fat ain't a disability mother fucker.""

&gt;Chorus of laughter, Hamgar turns red but is far to big a pussy to say anything to a man who could break all his limbs with one hand

&gt;Hamgar turns and inches towards the steps like someone with a fear of heights inches towards the edge of a cliff or tall building

&gt;Shooting one last look back at the ex-marine, Hamgar braces himself against the wall with one lard-glove and attempts the first step

&gt;*THUD*

&gt;He makes the first step out of the 5 needed

&gt;I'm not sure the San Andres fault can hold through 4 more vibrations like that

&gt;Hamgar's face is starting to turn red from 1 stair

&gt;Bracing himself even more heavily against the wall he takes the next step

&gt;A smear of mayo is left on the wall behind his hand

&gt;Hamgar takes the next step, actually grunting in exertion

&gt;4th step, his legs are shaking violently

&gt;He waits there catching his breath and staring at the seat 1 step below like it were a ranch dressing filled ham hawk

&gt;With one last grunt and great shudder of effort, he takes the last step and collapses into the chair gasping for breath

&gt;Dude was seriously about as winded as I am after a 5 mile run

&gt;On top of that the dude is sitting 4 chairs away from me and the smell is horrendous

&gt;I feel sorry for the girl who is sitting 2 seats away from him

&gt;Hamgar, still short of breath, reaches into his back pack and pulls out a gallon sized zip lock stuffed almost to bursting with gummy worms

&gt;At least they won't be as loud as chips

&gt;*smack smack smack*

&gt;Fuckmylife.gif

&gt;Hamgar shovels 10 or 12 handfuls of gummies down his bacon-scented gullet then begins getting out his actual school supplies

&gt;His pencil rolls off the desk onto the floor, Hamgar stars at it as if its lost forever a mere 3 feet from him

&gt;Girl sitting near him is far too nice and picks the pencil up for him

&gt;Mistakes, I can see by the look in Hamgar's eyes he took a random act of kindness for some sign of interest on her part

Nothing else happened during class other than the gross over consumption that doesn't surprise me coming from Hamgar anymore.  However, the best part comes after class.

&gt;Exit class room after almost everyone else because I was talking to professor

&gt;When I do get out I see Hamgar talking to the girl he sat next to in class

&gt;Can tell she would rather be anywhere else and wasn't enjoying being hear the wildebeest

&gt;I know her through a mutual friend, we've talked once or twice and she is far to nice a person to say anything

&gt;Decide to play the knight in shining armor for once

&gt;Walk up to her and say ""Hey, (insert mutual friend's name here) was trying to get ahold of you, but said your phone was off.  They're over by the student center waiting for you.""

&gt;She looks really confused for a second then is dawns on her what I'm doing

&gt;Look of gratitude fills her eyes

&gt;""Ohhh well I better go meet her then, bye Hamgar, bye Bringofthenachos.""

&gt;She begins to walk off and Hamgar starts to follow

&gt;Shit

&gt;Step infront of Hamgar and try to make small talk about the latest test

&gt;He just grunts, shoves me aside and continues his pursuit

&gt;Need to think fast

&gt;Remember I have a coupon thing for a free burger from the cafeteria I got from donating blood earlier that day like a boss

&gt;Pull it out of my pocket

&gt;""Hey Hamgar, did you drop this?""

&gt;He turns, ""What is it?"" 

&gt;I look at it like I don't know, ""A coupon for a free burger from the cafeteria.  You donated blood?""

&gt;Can see him being torn between his crazy notion that the girl is interested in him and the prospect of free food

&gt;In the end beetus beats out his sex drive and he walks back and snatches the coupon

&gt;""Yes""

&gt;Waddles off towards the cafeteria to indulge his everything-tooth


There are 2 more Hamgar stories from the semester I think are entertaining enough to be posted here, I'll try to get to them as soon as I can.

**Chapter Twelve**
 
Sleep did not come easily that night. The aftershocks of terror and the thrill of rising hope were each like electrical currents running through my body. Jeff had curled up on my couch in anticipation of his drive home in the morning, and I had adjourned to my room, where I lay on my bed, wide awake.
 
“Sorry about Porcina.”
 
*Lauren* had apologized to *me*! It could only mean she knew that I wasn't to blame! My fears about a ruined reputation seemed almost silly then, and thoughts of living out my days surrounded by concrete walls and bars were practically laughable.
 
“She's done this before.”
 
I reread the message for the several thousandth time, cherishing the warm glow that it brought to my chest. *Of course* Porcina had done this before! Behavior like hers didn't just suddenly manifest itself! No doubt this was the latest in a long line of flare-ups, an event as commonplace to her as being beautiful was to Lauren.
 
“Sleeping now.”
 
As I should have been. As I *wanted* to be. Giving in to slumber would see the next day dawning faster – at least from my perspective – which would bring me minutes closer to a final, glorious outcome. I could scarcely believe that the entire affair had occurred in the span of two days. *Two days*. I'd had *hangovers* that lasted longer, and had been considerably more pleasant.
 
“Talk tomorrow after class.”
 
Well, there went my education. I knew that I'd be unable to focus on anything besides my impending discussion with Lauren. Granted, the actual topic remained a mystery, but in light of her reassuring messages, I was sure that it could only be a good one. Perhaps she would propose an immediate engagement... for dinner, of course... or maybe she'd express desire to spend some time alone.
 
“L.”
 
L for Lauren, L for lovely, L for luscious, L for... well, I shouldn't get ahead of myself. Still, when my eyes finally grew heavy, I was treated to visions of the girl in all of her splendor, clad only in rays of celestial light... or so I hoped I would be. In fact, my dreams were less than pleasant, featuring as they did a bulbous, screaming mass that had me cornered in a prison cell. My legs refused to work, leaving me unable to run, while every wail of fury ripped a scrap from my disheveled clothing.
 
It was a relief to hear my alarm going off.
 
Jeff bid me goodbye before leaving for home, pausing only to remind me not to do anything stupid. I promised I would heed his words, and set off for my own destination, making the brief walk from my apartment to the college. Out of caution, I avoided the place where the school's shuttle stopped, knowing that the location was frequented by Porcina. We didn't share, to the best of my knowledge, any common classes, and I was sure I would have remembered if I had seen her before our date... but still, I was on alert, ready to run at the first sign of her presence.

As I had predicted, my concentration was shot. Every lecture was a buzzing drone, every textbook full of gibberish. The seconds ticked by like... like *very slow things*. Nothing could hold my attention, not even the lurid video that a fellow student had pulled up on his laptop. I waited for the bell to ring, reminded myself that there *were* no bells, and wondered why I had come to class in the first place. It was something to do, I supposed, in the time between getting up and meeting my heavenly angel. Finally, after eons of waiting and ages of impatience, I felt my phone vibrate.

“Done with class,” the message said, sent from Lauren's number. “Where should we meet?”

I knew the college campus well. Outside the administration building, there was a group of stone benches set within a copse of trees. It seemed the perfect place for our conversation, since it was quiet, comfortable, and only *slightly* romantic. I described the place to Lauren, who promised to see me there soon.

Class be damned! I rose from my seat immediately and made directly for the door, practically running towards the place where Lauren would be waiting. I arrived only minutes later, and to my dismay, found that the grove was already populated by an impromptu study group. Well, we'd just have to ignore them. I nervously paced the clearing, checking my phone for any further messages... until at last, from in the distance, I saw a petite woman approaching.

I waved.

She waved.

I restrained myself from rushing forward like a lovestruck sap in a bad movie... but it was a struggle.

“Whoo. Hi!” Lauren said. She was clad in a sweatshirt emblazoned with the university's letters, over which she had slung an impressively sized backpack.

“Hi!” I parroted back. “That looks heavy. Can I carry it for you?”

“It's mostly clothes,” she explained, and she pulled up her sweatshirt to reveal a martial arts uniform. “I'm taking a karate class as an elective.”

I made a mental note to look into such an option for myself. “Well, shall we sit down?” I gestured to one of the nearby benches, the only one unoccupied by an uninvited interloper. Lauren nodded, and we made our way to the stone seat. It was much more comfortable than the ones that were present at the mall, though the change in company likely made more difference than anything.

“So. Yeah.” Lauren spoke, sighing with a smile. “I'm really sorry about Porcina.”

“I'm really sorry that I caused a scene,” I replied. “And that I, uh, woke you up, I assume.”

Lauren's sheepish grin could have melted even the coldest of hearts. “Yeah, that was awkward. I guess you've seen it before, though.”

“I'd prefer,” I said, “if it was by choice, but I'm glad that you're not embarrassed.”

We sat in pensive silence, each possibly waiting for the other to speak. I finally broke the quiet with the question of the year: “What's the real story, anyway?”

Lauren answered with a shrug. “I calmed her down, told her there had been a misunderstanding, said you weren't worth it – sorry – and sent her to bed with a mug of hot chocolate. She was all sunshine and rainbows this morning. Has she tried to contact you?”

“I don't know,” I answered. “And that was comforting, thanks.”

“Sorry!” Lauren said again.

“No, no, I mean it,” I hastened to assure her. “I was worried she was going to report me or something.”

“Hah.”

“Anyway, I actually wanted to know the story about *her*. About Porcina. You said that she'd done this before. Why? What's her problem?”

My choice of words seemed ill-advised, but Lauren took them in stride. “Well, we met in highschool,” she began. “My friends had gone to a different one. They'd gotten kind of cliquey, to be honest. Porcina  noticed me spending a lot of time reading, and before long, we were hanging out a lot.” It all matched what Porcina had told me, though it painted Lauren in a less submissive light. “My mom was concerned about her weight. About Porcina's weight, I mean. She signed us up for a spin class, which Porcina hated. It turned into us hanging out at Porcina's house a lot. I dated her brother for awhile, so I was over there all the time.”

“How was that?” I asked.

“Pretty good!” she brightly answered. “Her parents are really nice people, but they have five kids. Four boys, and Porcina. She has classic 'middle child' syndrome, even though she's the only girl. She never got the attention she wanted, I guess. Any time her parents had to focus on someone else, they'd placate her with food and manga.”

“That's like Anime, right?” I asked. “Only comics?”

“*Graphic novels*,” replied Lauren, perhaps a touch sarcastically. “I never got into them.”

“Me, neither.” I scratched my head. “Is the rest of her family... overweight?”

“Sort... of...” Lauren answered. “They're not exactly *healthy*, but not *fat*, you know?”

I nodded my understanding. “So, about this happening before.”

Lauren's eyes went wide. “Yes! Don't worry, you're not special.”

“Gee, thanks.”

“No, no, I meant,” she continued, laughing, “I meant you're not the first guy she's... acted like that around. She's been a bit... promiscuous... since sophomore year. She also doesn't handle rejection well. There have been *quite a few* guys in your position, and I always get stuck cleaning up after her.”

Literally as well as figuratively, I thought, picturing the disaster zone that their apartment had become in the span of twenty-four hours.

“Is she going to keep... harassing me?” I asked.

Lauren sucked air between her teeth. “Yeah, you might want to lay low for awhile. It should probably blow over in a week, though. Her boyfriend is coming to visit.”

I blinked in surprise. “Sorry,” I said, “did you just say *boyfriend*?”

""Oh hey meatloaf, how's everything""

""same old! you need to get a bit of meat on ya bones, you look unhealthy""

[HFW](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/Node_Page/images/1310483866536.jpg)

My mom shrugged it off and continued doing her daily task on this elephant of a man and making sure he lived to see another day and fill his mouth again. 

His beady little eyes saw my mom's ring and he couldn't stand the fact that HOW DARE SHE LEAVE THIS MAN AND GO MARRY SOMEONE ELES, DOESN'T SHE KNOW BETTER?!

""YOU GOT MARRIED?!""

""Oh yeah! it was amazing, with iidank'sdad and he's...""

""A FAGGOT?""

""Excuse me?""

""YOU DONT NEED NO BOY, YOU NEED A MAN LIKE MUH, YOU CANNA DO THIS""

""I've been engaged for months, you knew I was, what's your problem?""

""MAH PROBLEM IS DAT YOU WANTED ALL DIS -touching his stomach- AND THEN GO OFF AND MARRY ANOTHER GUY? HOW DARE YOU WHORE?!"" 

whatintheworldisgoingonhere.doc

""Listen up, what happens in life is none of your business, I am your doctor and that's about it."" 

So my mom started to walk away and this beast of a man grabbed her arm, getting sweat and grease all over it

""what are you doing?! Leave me""

""NOT UNTIL YOU ADMIT YOU WANT ME! DONT LIE!""

""Leave my hand right now or I...""

""YOU WILL WHAT?! YOU BITCH! I DARE YOU!""

My mom yelled out for help and a nurse came in and to get his paw off my mom but her tiny self was no match for meatloaf

""Help!""

""YOU SKINNY BITCH, YOU NEED A MAN LIKE ME! LEAVE US ALONE! YOU'RE SCARING HER!""

A couple of interns and a security guard came in and got his hand off. My mom was furious and shaking in shock. Police were called and she pressed charged for assault against MeatLoaf and he was transferred to another hospital and was ordered to stay away from my mom at all times.

TL;DR Beast falls in love with a doctor and refuses to believe that she can marry someone that's less of a man than he is.

1370021344.0	1feycy	"""You have no right to say that"""	LambdaZero	534	101	161	"Hi, first post (ever!) and decided it would be here after last night. This won't be too long, but it's something that frustrated me a lot and my first contact with FatLogic™. I'm 6'0 135lbs (61.24Kg) guy, athletic but not a lot of muscle (or fat, 3.9%-4% body fat). Being so tall and thin, it's extremely hard for me to buy t-shirts that fit me. It's either they fit the shoulders but barely reach my belt line, or I look like I'm going to get lost in my shirt. I'm very self-conscious about it, but usually try to laugh it off. Now that the intro is out of the way, onwards!

Yesterday I was with some friends on a terrace (not sure if that's the name in english, but basically the outside portion of a pub) since it was a gorgeous day/evening. I started to tell them that I got myself my gym membership back and started tracking my calories/food intake so I could eat enough to gain weight/muscle. I was telling them that I felt really embarrased the other day when I spent 5 hours shopping for t-shirts and found myself resigned to buying button-up shirts, since they fit me ok, but that's all I have, and that I was tired of being ashamed of being stick thin (I don't have an eating disorder, just a whack schedule so I eat when I have the time). Amongst the people there, there was a girl I didn't know and was on a highway to hamway, but wasn't totally there yet.

After having listened to me talk, she looks at me and straight up tells me ""You have NO RIGHTS to complain and be uncomfortable about what you look like, you're THIN! If you had to live with bodies like ours (points to her and a girl I knew (but not that much), you would see that what you're doing right now is degrading to people of upper weight (Yes, she said ""upper weight""...) and you should stop.""

...wut?

Being no beta, I simply told her to eat it (heh, I'm sure she would of anyways) and that she was fat because she overeats and probably ingests enough calories in a day that would feed me for 3 days, and that at least I was planning to do something about it.

After that, my friends backed me up (most of them anyways) so she she proceded to leave while telling us we were deluding ourselves if we though that I could change, since she obviously can't, and she tried EVERYTHING!


Thanks for listening guys, not the most exiting story here, but I hope it did ok :)

A big part of the motivation to get back to it after so long was reading the people that lost weight posting here. If they can reach their goal, so can I!


**Edit:** thanks everyone for the support and the clothing advice! Much appreciated :)

**Edit 2:** Some people have been questioning the 4% bf that I wrote, and after reading their comments I'm inclined to agree. So this morning I used my electronic scale and this is the result:

http://i.imgur.com/nk74tEU.jpg

I know it's no bodypod, but its a rough estimation I imagine (and I realised I'm 6 pounds lighter than 2 weeks ago. Proof that weight loss is possible?).

1373698300.0	1i7grz	Tubby Room mate takes on cripple or, The Cane is Mightier Than the Flab(Long)	Combustablesquirrel	526	100	78	"So this is my second FPS for the night. Sorry for posting two in quick succession, but my case worker at the VA reminded me of this, and I think you guys might get a justice boner. 

So, be me. A 27 year old college student. It's the beginning of the Spring semester. I'm living with a friend of mine in a house her father owns. Been there about six months

He wasn't particularly ok with a guy living there, but I proved my worth. She had a psychotic ex-boyfriend. He tried to get into the house to attack my main room mate. I was respectful, but forceful. I put him on his face until the police arrived. Her dad looked at me as armed security and took fifty bucks off the rent to make sure I stayed here long term.

Actually, an interesting PS to this. I was dating a girl at the time and she was in the living room during this incident. After the crazy guy was arrested, I was shooting the shit with one of the cops who was a member of the SWAT team in my area. We were talking about all sorts of stuff. I didn't notice that my girlfriend was strangely quiet. After he left she looked at me and said just dead pan ""You know, I don't normally look at race and stuff, but that is shit only white people can do(She was black)."" I was confused, and she said ""The cops came out and you were just chatting with him like it was no big deal"". We're not dating anymore, but I still run into her occasionally and say ""Hey, I think I'm going to chat with a cop."" She's laughs and goes ""Fuck you, that was weird for me. I just never talked to them like that"". Anyway, I'm meandering.

So, the main room mate, I'll call Beth, had a friend who hated the dorms and wanted to move in with us, but she couldn't pay rent. I said ""Right on, just make sure she helps keep the common areas clean and doesn't interfere with my schooling. 

Come move in day, I was coming back from class. This chick is like five nothing and 300 pounds. She's sitting in my chair in the living room when I come home and I said ""Hey, would you mind moving? That chair has a foot stool so I can prop my leg up"". She replied, ""God, you're like Sheldon. 'That's my spot, that's my spot'..."" In my head I'm thinking ""Bitch I met you like five seconds ago. Don't judge me"". What came out was ""Look, that's my chair and I bought it for my leg. Move"". 

It was at this point, that I met the boyfriend who I found out was moving in with her. Which was news to both me and Beth.

Over the course of the semester, the house transformed. Now you have to understand Beth. She's a pushover. She never stands up for herself. Tubby Room Mate took huge advantage of this. I didn't find out about a lot of this stuff until later. 

My main issues were about sleep. I'm a combat veteran, and they were gamers who shared a wall with me. They had recently got Spec Ops:The Line. Great game, but not something I need to hear before I go to sleep. I knocked on the door. ""Hey guys, I've got class at nine AM. It's midnight. Shut it down for the night"". I got half-hearted agreements. Later the same night, I'd knock on the door again. Rinse and repeat. 

My one move later that month was that they did the same thing and I finally walked in and said ""Excuse me"", and unplugged their console and started to walk out with it. Tubby yelled at her Bf ""Hey, are you going to let him treat us like that?!"" And the Bf got in front of me. Let me explain something about this guy. This is a kid who is about 5'6"" and maybe a buck ten soaking wet. He's not a confrontational guy. He's been Switzerland this entire time. 

I said ""Dude, you're cool, but I need to sleep. This is so not worth getting into a fight over. I'll leave this outside your door in the morning."" and walked out. 

Thus began the ritual. We even tried headphones for the speakers they had, but she kept yelling at him during gaming so much, that I just took the system at night. 

Then began the food stealing. I like to cook. I actually took cooking classes on the side to curb my PTSD somewhat. It did help. So every now and then, I'd invite friends over and cook for them. Then we'd all drink beer and watch movies. I'm talking, I'd cook appetizers, mains, sides, and dessert. 

For dessert one night, I had made from scratch brownies and ice cream for everyone. I went to get the ice cream and it wasn't there. I thought, ""There's no fucking way"". I walked to her room and opened the door, and there she was playing Skyrim and eating the ice cream out of the carton.   

I was pretty pissed. I thought we had established that the rules of the house were ""Ask before you take, and be ready if the answer is no"". So I had six guests in the house and my dessert was half of what it should be. I snatched the ice cream out of her lap and walked back to the living room. Put the ice cream under the hot water in the sink and washed it away. 

Interestingly enough, she tried to appeal to my friends by saying I wasted food. She got a resounding ""Fuck you, that was his food!"". I love that she tried to appeal to the very people she stole from. That's some fat people logic.

Towards the end of the semester. Beth knocked on my door. She was wondering if she could get an advance on the rent to buy food. I know this girl, she never asks for anything unless it's an emergency. I knew she was dating Tubby's brother, who was skinny as hell, but a good guy(he and I are actually friends now), and I offhandedly asked ""Why, is your boyfriend eating all your food?"". She actually started to cry. It turns out, Tubby was eating Beth's food after her run in with me. She felt it was safer to steal from the push over than the soldier. Beth hadn't had anything to eat in three days because Tubby kept eating everything Beth had. 

I talked to her and I said ""Look, I'm going to help you regardless, but she's taking advantage of you. You need to call your dad, and give me the go ahead to take charge of this situation"". I took her grocery shopping and gave her half the next month's rent in advance.

Then, I waited for them to get home. They got in the door and I told them to have a seat, like [Chris Hanson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_wWdTryqLY) No reason for that video, I just find it amusing. 

I told them that, from now on, their lives were going to be regimented in this house. I told them ""Today, live it up. Have fun. I'm not even going to get angry about playing games till 3 AM on a school night. Because tomorrow is going to suck so hard for you two"".

The start of the first day, things went according to plan. At 0800, I woke their assess up and gave them there marching orders. They were to clean the common areas until noon. Then get one hour for lunch. Then they were to apply at every place within ten miles of the house, whether they were hiring or not. And if a single scrap of food was missing without asking permission, that was an instant failure. Failure to do anything above, would result in immediate dismissal from the house. They weren't on a lease, and I defied them to prove they lived there. 

Tubby bitched and complained. I said ""Complain all you want. At noon, I'll be back to inspect this place. You know what happens if you don't get it done"". 

I came back, the area I assigned her was not clean and she actually wrote ""Fuck you"" on the counter with chocolate mix. 

Awwww Yeahhhh. I called some buddies up and we meticulously bagged everything up and brought it into the yard. Three 18 packs of Budweiser for a moving service is a bargain in my mind. 

She came back and tried to beg Beth to let her stay and not make her move back into the dorm. I'm so proud of her, she said ""You stopped being my friend the minute you started stealing food and money from me. This is in Squirrel's hands now"".

So so long story short, I ended up telling my case worker, that the home situation was still handled and is not a problem. "	t5_2vzax	True

----------------------------------------------------------------

Bless me, my Bretheren and Sister(en?) for I know I have been gone a while... but I have been to many places, and seen many things... and gathered many stories for you all. I have thought about you all every day my faithful followers!!! There hasn't been a moment where I have laid eyes on a 400lb mass of flesh in short shorts and a tight tank top and not imaged the jimmies here, leaving the planet on the next shuttle to mars. 

In the month or so that I have been gone, I have also been in summer vacation. Good grief people, it's been hot here. 30c average every week. Yes that is hot for us UK people. Inb4 someone says it's 40c in the middle of bumfuck america. I don't care. But I've spent time with my parents, I went on Vacation last-minute with the girls to Spain (yes, including PorkPlanet) and went to visit Cuteguy at his parents home for a few days.

I have lots of stories to tell. Some.... my best stories yet, especially from the vacation to Spain. But for now, a short story about how I returned home a few days ago to a mound of fat logic by the new beast neighbours living next door. 

YOU GOIN' LUV DIS STORY FATPEOPLESSTORIES. I DID IT FOR YOU!! I DID IT FOR ALL OF YOU !!!!!

&gt; Arive back to house. 

&gt; Fuckingtired.gif. 

&gt; Did a 20 mile bikeride with Cuteguy that morning, then drove 2 hours.

&gt; Needed to come back to the house to work a few shifts this week.

&gt; Nobody is there except for Porkplanet and Otherhousemate#2 but she's been working a tonne. Everyone else gone for the summer. 

&gt; Open front door. 

&gt; House a visible dump. Shoes and bags everywhere in hallway. Stale smells of bacon and grease. Not kidding. 

&gt; Hot and windows not been opened in what feels like a month. 

&gt; whatthefuckinghellwhyisntthishousetidyforoncetiredrage.rar

&gt; Hear rumbling from the living room. 

&gt; Oh god I just want to come home to a quiet house. 

&gt; Open living room. 

&gt; Hit by smell. 

&gt; Hit by sights

&gt; Hit by horror. 

&gt; Porkplanet: HUYYYYY GURL HUYYYYYYY

&gt; Tundra of beasts: HUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

&gt; Me *visibly grumpy*: Hi can we open a window in here please. 

&gt; Porkplanet: YOU BE GRUMPY!

&gt; Me: I cleaned this house not even 2 weeks ago and nobody has hardly been here and now the house is a mess and smells stale. 

&gt; Porkplanet: teehee sorry I will clean up tomorrow. 

&gt; ignoring the guests for the moment and opening up the double doors in the living room to our back garden. ah fresh air. 

&gt; look around. porkplanet, and 3 visibly large girls (all about her size, 250-350lb+) sat on couches, with pizzas on laps. 

&gt; We will call the first one (the head beast, on parr with Porkplanet) RedHeadPlanet. The second, ClothesTooTightBeast, the third, WhisperingBeast. 

It's 2.30pm and they have ordered huge pizzas each and watching TLC.  

&gt; Me: Hello, sorry girls I'm so tired I was a bit grumpy then. I'm imgonnamakeit!
 
&gt; All the beasts in unison once more: HUYYYY. 

&gt; Porkplanet: These are our new neighbours. 

&gt; Me: Oh really? *internal groan* 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Yeah mate, we moved in last week. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: Myself and RedHeadPlanet went to school together back in Birmingham. Isn't it a small world? 

&gt; Me: Oh cool.

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles*

&gt; Me: U wot m8. 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *more mumbles and whispering* 

&gt; ClothesTooTightBeast: Do you want some pizza she's asking? 

&gt; freaked out by whisperingbeast, she's like a fat version of that quiet asian girl off Pitch Perfect. 

&gt; Me: Ehhh, no thanks. Bit early for pizza. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: NEVA!!! NEVA TOO EARLY FOR PIZZA!!!

&gt; Porkplanet: Hur Hur!!!!

&gt; Me: Really. I'm good. 

&gt; I collapse on sofa next to porkplanet. I am so tired. 

&gt; Porkplanet: What did you do today? 

&gt; I went on a bike ride this morning with Cuteguy and just drove here after. 

&gt; Porkplanet: *scoffs and leans into RedHeadPlanet* She is losing weight and trying to get fit and over excercising. 

&gt; Me: I am not over doing it at all PorkPlanet. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Do you mind me asking how much you've lost? 

&gt; Me: Not at all! Over 6 stone! (90lb) 

Side Note: Good news reddit, I am almost at the 100lb mark. I'm gonna make it!!!

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: WOW!!!

&gt; ClothesTooTightBeast: Wooooow. 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *Mumbles* 

&gt; [MFW at WhisperingBeast](http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h306/Yajimari21/tyra_unsure.gif). 

&gt; Porkplanet: *visibly annoyed* Hmmm, I didn't think you'd lost THAT much. 

&gt; [MFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llcuj3vt5n1qagjn7o1_500.gif) 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: *mumbles* That's so unhealthy. 

&gt; Me: Sorry what. What's healthy? 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: No. I said that is so UNHEALTHY. 

Room goes silent and tense so quickly. 

&gt; Me: What, my weight loss? 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Yeah. You shouldn't lose that much weight so fast. 

&gt; Me: I have lost it in about 9 months. It's a steady weight loss if you do the math. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Whatever, where you ill or something to be THAT overweight? 

&gt; Me: *getting visibly angry* No. I was just sick of sitting on my fat ass day in, day out, eating pizza and making excuses for myself and being disgusting. 

&gt; [Everyones face when.](http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/shocked_fans_omg.gif) 

Otherhousemate#2 walks in. My saviour. As I was about to slay these beasts and make it look like some horrific mass pizza choking accident. 

&gt; RedHeatPlanet: Oh my god excuse me? 

&gt; Porkplanet: All right let's just calm down. 

&gt; Otherhousemate#2: Err, what's going on? 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles*

&gt; OtherHousemate#2: You wot m8?

&gt; RedHeatPlanet: We were just discussing how losing 6 stone (90lb) in less than a year is incredibly unhealthy. 

&gt; Me: I should listen to the girl eating a large, hot dog stuffed crust pizza at 2.30 in the afternoon. Tell me, when is the last time you went on a 20 mile bike ride on a glorious sunny day? 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Porkplanet, you live with this bitch? 

&gt; Me: I'M THE BITCH!!! Funny. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: I'm sorry I just stated my opinion. You came in, in a bad mood. You've taken it all wrong. 

&gt; OtherHousemate#2: Wow, you know, this is getting quite heated. 

&gt; ClothesTooTightBeast: Right, I'm leaving. 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles* 

&gt; Porkplanet: Oh my god you guys what the hell has just happened? 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: I'm not going anywhere. 

&gt; Me: Yes you are. 

&gt; Porkplanet: What? 

&gt; Me: Get the fuck out of my house RedHeadPlanet.  

&gt; Porkplanet: Omg you can't just throw her out!! 

&gt; OtherHouseMate#2: Yes she can. It's her house. Her name on the contract. 

&gt; Porkplanet: OUR house. 

&gt; Me: You didn't pay the fucking rent this month Porkplanet, you forgot. So you will be leaving next if your not fucking careful because I've had enough of you for one month and coming home to this house being fucking disgusting as per usual has tipped me over the edge.

&gt; Porkplanet: *stunned into silence* 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Fucking BITCH!

&gt; As she's getting up, she struggles to stand up unaided and balance pizza. 

&gt; Me: Yeah don't forget your fucking pizza, god forbid. 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles* 

&gt; Door slamming. Stench slowly wafting behind them. 

&gt; Porkplanet storms out quietly. 

&gt; She hasn't spoken to me in 2 days. 

&gt; Been the best 2 days ever. Peaceful. 

&gt; Not taking no more shit about my weight loss by horrible fat bastards. 

&gt; FIN. 

Hope you guys enjoyed.

1372542835.0	1hbya7	Tales of hamplanetry and fatlogic through the eyes of a cardiologist (IV)	iidank	552	119	32	"Story 4: HAES 

This was by far my most favourite story since it battled so much fat logic, Shall we begin or do you need to eat since your sugar level is low my amazing beetus juice deprived friends.

Mom: 5'6/167cm 120lbs/54kg/8.5stone
vs
Hammroid: 5'6/167cm 265lbs/120kg/19stone

Hammroid was admitted to the hospital after collapsing at the park as a result of dehydration, she was also a type 2 diabetic (shocker!) and had been a frequent comer to the hospital

Enter my mom, friday night, tired and just want to get this ordeal over with and go home.

""How are you holding up Hammroid""

""Not so good, I fainted because my blood sugar was low""

""actually it was because you were dehydrated, your sugar levels were fine""

""I KNOW MY BODY BETTER, MY SUGAR LEVELS WERE LOW""

My mom shows her the chart with her sugar levels on it and tells her that its fine. she just shrugs it off and pouts. 

""Hammroid, you know that you drinking water is important""

""I DONT LIKE IT, I GET MY WATER FROM COKE""

whatthefuck?

""Then no wonder this happened to you, you need to take better care of yourself and start exercising""

""FUCK YOU, I'M HEALTHY""

""Clearly not, you're in a hospital""

""HEALTHY AT EVERY SIZE, EVER HEARD OF IT YOU DUMB BITCH?!""

""Yeah, its bullshit""

""You're just jealous that it makes me healthy and you're not""

""First of all, you can barely walk 10 feet without gasping for breath, secondly, if its healthy at every size then I should be healthy too now, right?""

""SKINNY BITCH""

""I've had enough, lay your fatass back down""

""YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, THIS IS DISCRIMINATION""

""I'm pointing out the obvious, that's not discrimination""

""FUCK YOU, I WANNA GO HOME AND AWAY FROM THIS SHITHOLE""

The Chief if Medicine heard the commotion and came by and scolded my mom for talking to a patient like that but understood that she was just a fat tard 

Chief: I'm sorry about her attitude but she is right, you need to lose weight or else you...""

Hammroid: "" FUCK YOU ALL, YOU THINK I'M UNHEALTHY JUST BECAUSE I'M BIG AND I HAVE CURVES! I'M JUST BIG BONED YOU DUMB FUCK""

Chief: ""there's no such thing as being big boned!! you're more than welcome to leave right now""

Hammroid: ""IMMA SUE YOUR FUCKING ASS AND SHUT DOWN THIS HOSPITAL, BUNCHA FAT SHAMMERS, I'M HEALTHY!""

She signed a few papers so waive the hospital from any liability and went out, last my mom heard she got even bigger and started going to another hospital to carry on her shenanigans 

TL;DR Fatzilla refused to believe she is unhealthy and argues with the chief of medicine and a cardiologist about what healthy should be

1370765225.0	1fz1gw	Encounter at Wal-Mart: pizza rolls most important things ever created		494	72	178	"I'm new at this sub, but I dig it a lot, and it entertains me everyday. This encounter I had after reading this sub. Was blown away that these stories actually might be legit. Doing this from a phone and never done green screen, sooo ill try a smorgasbord of story telling methods. I hope it's not too unreadable at the end.

Be me. 5'7, 175lb, Ranger in the army for a while now. Appreciate/love physical fitness and being healthy, but also dig some unhealthy food and beer.
Easier to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart than the commissary. I hate the fucking commissary.

Almost finished with shopping, decide I want to get some easy microwave shit food for when I'm hung over, head to frozen food aisles.

Realize in this area of Wal-Mart, almost all these people probably lose things in their belly button frequently. 98% are obese.

Walk towards  freezer door. Notice incredibly obese ham-planet thudding directly towards same door.  She is 5'4, mid-twenties, guessing around 350lbs. Pasty white, covered in sheen of oily sweat (in frozen food section...). She's wearing this 'dress' top that resembles a yellow flowery shower curtain and jean shorts.

Can't help noticing her shorts have ridden way up. See huge disgusting rash on inside of thighs(chub rub) and the worst cottage cheese legs I've ever seen. Arms folding over on themselves and had the texture of a golf ball..rolls, everywhere. Same cottage cheese effect everywhere. Short 'dress' top shows too much cleavage. Acne on shoulders and face and neck, dark brown hair just as greasy as skin. Partial moustache on face.

Sees me looking at her. Does not notice face turn green and small dry heave I do. Smiles flirtatious way at me.
Ohgod.jpg

Open freezer door for her. Chivalry is not dead.  'THANKS, CUTIE! HEEEEEHEHEHE'.  
Helpmeanyone.avi

You know those bags pizza rolls come in that each have something like 72 pizza rolls in each of them? She grabbed 8 of them. Every last one they had, while I stood holding the door for her. This doesn't include the rest of the shit she grabbed, there was too much to count. It was at holy shit level.  Stacks and stacks of horrible, horrible food. Most full cart I've ever seen.

Notice her stench. It is a combination of unwashed vagina/ass, B.O., and cigarette breath.  Actually gag out loud this time.

Look in her cart, also feel bad for the sandals she is walking on. Everything in her cart was from the frozen food section, except for peanut butter and a bunch of chips, cookies, oat meal cream pies, soda...I can't go on.  So much more stuff, none healthy.

Appalled, take the time to realize I'm part of a FPS.  It takes her some time to empty all the pizza roll bags as well as all the other microwave pizza-related food she emptied out of that freezer. Flirts with me: 'GOTTA GET ENOUGH TO LAST ME THE WEEKEND'. there's enough food there for a fucking month.  

Carry on short conversation (I try not to be a dick, even when I'm so thoroughly disguised). For some reason say I didn't have anything planned for weekend.

'WELL WE CAN GET SUM EXTRA FOODS AND BOOZE AND YOU CAN COME TO MY APARTMENT, I DUN LIVE BUT RIGHT AT (nearby trailer park) AND MY SON WILL FALL ASLEEP AFTER 'IS DINNER LIKE ALWAYS'

Whole time has this attempted 'seductive' look on face.  Notice teeth...yellow as a banana. Jowls jiggling with every syllable, as she's talking she continually messes with bra and armpits while talking to me. She's sweating...so....much...

Officially begin to view her as non human. Still try to be gentle. 'Ah, I'm sorry I should get back'

'WHYYYY SOLDAT?!'....touches my arm. I begin to stammer: 'I just...sorry you aren't really my type.'

Look darkens, jowls jiggle ever so slightly, covered in sweat, as she clenched her jaw. Face turns bright red, starts wheezing. By the time she was finished basically yelling, sweat was all over her and even more prominent than before.

'WHAT, YOU CAN'T HANDLE A BIG BEAUTIFUL WOMAN? YOU DUN KNOW WHAT YOU MISSED OUT ON YOU KNOW HOW MANY GUYS I HAVE AFTER ME?' This is a quote of what she said. Verbatim. While taking she gestured at herself and put both hands on her enormous gut.

'YOU'RE PROBABLY A FAG ANYWAYS YOU LOOK LIKE ONE' as she wheezes and waddles away from me. 'CAN'T HANDLE A NATURAL WOMAN'.

I was left in disbelief, as I realized these stories may be more true than I originally thought. Fat people are angry and insane. 

I cut out a lot of the dialogue. I spent wayyyy, way too long exchanging sentences with her, I should have said single words or just grunted.  This is probably why she felt it was acceptable to basically ask me to come to her trailer to (likely) eat disgusting food and have sex."	t5_2vzax	True
1370559325.0	1ftp2f	How a Hamplanet trainee cost me $50 last week.	Throwaway_The_Grand	510	81	74	"Throwaway, first time greentexter, sorry in advance for formatting issues. I'm still fucking pissed about this and discovered this sub only recently, sorry if I don't have a lot of clever nicknames or file extensions here.

&gt; Be me, a summer server at a pretty decent Mexican (tex-mex) restaurant.

&gt; HollaHollaGetDolla.naturesprofit

&gt; 5'8"", 145 pounds, still kinda scrawny looking.

&gt; Don't be Hamtrainee (HT), a roughly 5'2"" globe that must be &gt;220 pounds.

&gt; Restaurant is understaffed and incidents cause even more firings.

&gt; Anybody can walk in the door with no experience and get a job if you pass a free drug screen.

&gt; HT had been doing other training duties, assigned to follow me and help out with the friday night shift.

&gt; Normally training shifts are pretty short, but we're understaffed and Fridays are packed, so she's stuck until close.

&gt; Don't give a shit, she seems pretty sane and nobody has given me any warning, assume she'll be fine.

&gt; Plenty of overweight servers, it's not that difficult and anybody friendly can do pretty well for themselves.

&gt; Strikeone.fatterup

&gt; HT follows me around, brings out drinks and chips for people.

&gt; HT is a bit slow figuring out the computers to put in orders, but hell, I've screwed up and they're sometimes counterintuitive.

&gt; Halfway through shift, HT complains about being hungry.

&gt; Still don't care, working around food constantly during normal dinner hours makes you hungry.

&gt; Striketwo.swingfatterfatter

&gt; Continues to complain about how hungry she is all shift.

&gt; Tune her out, start explaining things less to her and getting her to do more simple tasks to make my job easier.

&gt; Holy grail of all tables comes in to my section, 11 adult men on some kind of business dinner.

&gt; Automatic 18% gratuity is going to make my night

&gt; Introduce myself and HT, she's looking obviously pissed, but the table doesn't seem to notice.

&gt; DrinksAllRound.krunk

&gt; Queso and appetizers everywhere.

&gt; HT complains of hunger yet more while I'm picking up the drinks from the bar.

&gt; A second and third round of drinks come out as they put in orders.

&gt; Most of them order fajitas (or double orders of the same), a couple order quesadillas.

&gt; Total bill after putting in the food is 300 bucks, 18% grat means I'm guaranteed over half a bill just for putting food in the general direction of the right place and not punching somebody.

&gt; Order finally comes out, check all the food over, everything looks perfect.

&gt; Ask a serverbro and HT to help me bring out all this food.

&gt; HT complains more about how she needs a break to eat, tell her to suck it up and help me out.

&gt; StrikeThree.fuckimstillmad

&gt; Bring out all the food, get it to everybody. Me, serverbro, and HT start to walk away.

&gt; One guy flags me back over, asks to speak to my manager, looking incredibly mad. Doesn't explain why, just asks to speak to him.

&gt; Bring over manager, he asks what the problem is.

&gt; He holds up one of his quesadillas, and my heart sinks.

&gt; There's a gigantic, absolutely massive bite taken out of one of his quesadillas.

&gt; Teeth marks and everything, there's no way it just broke apart or something.

&gt; Manager, rightly, comps the entire meal to them because seriously, what else do you do when a server fucking ate some of your food?

&gt; Talks to me in the back.

&gt; Knows that me and serverbro would never do anything like that, I tell him it had to be HT.

&gt; HT comes into the back, gets into a shouting match with the manager (no beetus or thyroids, just complaining about how she was being overworked and starving and had to eat something)

&gt; HT is fired, the party of 11 ate really quick, got another order of quesadillas rushed out, and left.

&gt; No tip.

I seriously just couldn't understand why somebody else would do that for days. She could have just stolen the quesadilla entirely, or garbage-mouthed somewhere (ate food left over on plates), or said she wasn't feeling well, or anything else.

&gt; Epilogue

&gt; This Tuesday

&gt; Find out HT only even started the job because her parents were making her (she was like 24)

&gt; Find out she hated working and being ""bossed around.""

&gt; Assume she ate the quesadilla because she didn't care about the job anyway.

&gt; Still mad.

EDIT: TL;DR Hamplanet Trainee complains about hunger all night, takes a bite out of a customer's food while bringing it to them, I lose the tip on a 300+ dollar bill.

EDIT: Also, I'm not even mad at the dudes not tipping; as much as I'm proud of my service and as much as I need tips to be making any money as a server, I can completely accept being stiffed on that one."	t5_2vzax	True

1365625850.0	1c34yu	Hambeast gets what's coming to them	wild-tangent	495	67	79	"I was going to college in a small city, surrounded by hundreds of miles of backwoods Virginia.

Statistically, southern states have the highest obesity rates in the country. Virginia is the very, very artery-clogged ""Heart of The South."" Hambeasts everywhere.

One is particularly piggy-faced and thoroughly unpleasant to any men she comes across, always addressing them 'boy' and generally making the most obscene generalities. Whatever, it's a small, formerly women's-exclusive liberal arts college, this stuff is not unusual. However, what *is* unusual is that the things I buy for myself (in attempting to learn to cook) go missing, but only after I've cooked them. Not sure who to suspect, except that the kitchen is next door to the hambeast's dorm, and the time span of it going missing is stunningly short. Barring the concept of many thieves approaching from whatever direction in the hallway I'm not in, *it has to be her.* Note: Not the same person as [Moped Chick. This one is somehow even bigger.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ac1xn/nowin_situation_on_a_scooter/). Heart of The South indeed. Biggest fatty I've ever seen who has retained use of their legs without succumbing to using a scooter. She looked like this, plus about two hundred pounds, to the point that her face had actual fat folds, especially around the eyebrow and cheeks, giving her a piggish and squished face. Nevermind the description, found [**EDIT: Censored out her eyes/identifiable bits. A pic of her, c. the time of incident.** This isn't a dox or against Reddit TOS- just a pic of her many chin-chins. Now with an imgur non-facebook pic, and with other faces cropped out.](http://imgur.com/n72UcEb).

I decide it's time this food thief- I suspected her, (but wasn't sure) was dealt with. I borrow a few spices that I find hidden away in the kitchen- I rationalize it as ""it's for the greater good, fellas."" Anything that has fire on the label. Anything red. Anything that smells pepper-y that has been left over from the ravaging. Most people have abandoned efforts of cooking, knowing that they're going to get one meal out of it.

I dump it all over the beef/fried vegetable mix I'm making. It is dry by the time I'm done that I have to soak the beef in so much oil that George Bush probably wanted to invade. It's definitely ready. I move on to making dessert. I spike the (really shitty) brownies with laxatives acquired from the local Food Lion pharmacy. (First time making brownies. Did not sample.) Both were done- I put them out on the table.

I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to my friend (who leaves). I go across the hall to the bathroom. The floor starts shaking- the lights begin flickering. I walk back out the door in less than ten seconds- and I spy her, with my plate in her hands, waddling back as fast as her pudgy little legs can propel her back to her door before anyone can spot her. This was next to the kitchen, thus why nobody ever caught her. Likely requested it. I tell her to put my plate down, and that it's mine. Her piggy eyes go wide, and she says (with a sneer, accented by her fat rolls to a super-sneer) that she was just clearing the table. She goes to throw my food in the trash, and I just say ""fine, whatever.""

I turn around, walk away. I don't hear the garbage can lid go up, however. Next is the *exact* sort of sound you'd expect from someone 400 lbs. or so being gagged and lit on fire. I walk in- and she has put the plate back on the table instead of dumping it into the trash as she'd threatened, and is flapping her flabby hands around her chins desperately trying to fan herself, causing all of her fat rolls to jiggle. I watch. She doesn't want to spit it out, but it's burning her mouth up.

She spits it out, finally, gasping, knocking the chair back, opening the fridge, and guzzling my milk. The leftover milk I'd spiked with the laxative to make the brownies. ""That's my milk!"" I say quietly- not sure if she heard me or not, but she downed it either way.

[**MFW**](http://handcannononline.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/man-vs-wild/shocked01.jpg) 

I didn't expect her to drink it straight. That's why I made the brownies! Fucking hell, this was going overboard! But there was no stopping it now, no way to explain. It was watching a train wreck in slow motion.

The shitshow isn't over. ""You are terrible at cooking!"" she *yells* at me. **Yelling. At. Me. For. The. Food. She. Stole. Not. Being. To. Her. Tastes.**

What. I'm still stuck with a stunned look on my face. She is calming down somewhat, still breathing heavily, like the sound of someone switching a dyson back and forth between suck and blow before the machine can gather enough noise to begin a real whine, just more of a puff with a mysterious rattling sound.

She sits back down, ignores the stuff she just spat out, and takes a HUGE mouthful. Spits it out, making a ""BLECH"" face, takes a swig out of the milk. Tries again. This time downs it and then swallows, using the ""milk"" as a chaser. At this point, I'm just petrified, rooted to the spot. ""Boy!"" she snaps at my staring at the feeding session. I just turn on my heels, an about-face, and walk the fuck out, unable to comprehend what I just saw.

**THE AFTERMATH**

The women's bathroom was closed the next day. Then the shared-gender one next to it. Then the men's became shared-gender so that the women in our residence hall could have somewhere to go to the bathroom. Then that one closed within the day. (My plan began to backfire, I suppose). All around campus, various bathrooms kept closing as the whale had to travel further and further to take her explosive, bathroom-closing shits.

I realized about a day or two after all this had finished that I'd left the brownies out- the laxatives should have passed through her digestive system within a single day. I am still not 100% sure what happened to them, but if I had to guess, I'd say that she was a slow learner and while she avoided the spicy food, couldn't resist the free brownies and milk, thus the many, many bathroom closings.

No idea what became of her- I left the college after long. But I still have many more FPS's from there."	t5_2vzax	True
1376370702.0	1k9dnv	Oversized Kirby goes to the County Fair!	LeadFootSpiderMonkey	509	87	31	"So we have had the good fortune of not seeing good ol' Kirby for a while, until the fair came to town over the weekend and me and my husband decided to take my stepdaughter for her 13th birthday along with my nephew so they could ride rides to their hearts content. About an hour after we got there, we spotted an elephant wearing a sash that said ""bachelorette"" on it and one of those cheesy/fun bachelorette veils and fake, blinky jewelry. My husband stops in his tracks when he realizes it isn't an elephant. It's Kirby, and she chose the county fair for her bachelorette party. Here's our ""view from afar"" experiences we saw throughout the day.

You know the drill, Jimmies secured and whatnot, etc.

&gt;be walking to next fair ride for the kiddos, when a wild Kirby appears

&gt;she is with a few mini moon friends and her fiance, who still looks like the gamer guy, but with cut short hair now

&gt;kirby is still rocking that ""my little pony-esque"" hairdo but with faded colors and blonde with her roots showing.

&gt;she is in line at one of the food stands that has deep fried everything

&gt;we stop at a ride that is adjacent to the food stand because the kiddos want to ride the super spinny gravity ride before they eat any food

&gt;at this point we are about 20-30 feet from her and her pack of friends

&gt;she still hasnt noticed us

&gt;this conversation will be important later

&gt;letthehungergamesbegin.jpg

&gt;over hear her already being bitchy to one of her actually in shape friends

&gt;her friend is about 5'8"" maybe 155, medium build, she is the healthiest of them all, we will call her ""Blue"" because of her hair color

&gt;""BLUUUE, you CANT expect me to walk EVERYWHERE in an hour, we NEED TO EAT NOW""

&gt;""it's just, i dont want to get sick on the rides, kirby, since you guys want to go on the spinny ones""

&gt;im trying to picture how exactly she is going to fit in some of the rides they have been describing

&gt;""fine, suit yourself, but WE GOTTA EAT, and you guys have to buy my food since its my party""

&gt;hear a low, collective grumble from a few of the group, i hope they brought their whole paychecks, each

&gt;gamer fiance tries to be reasonable and tell her they have plenty of money to buy food

&gt;""NO, ITS MY PARTY AND THEY NEED TO PAY, IM USING MY MONEY IN THE SHOPPING BOOTH, END OF STORY""

&gt;BIG awkward pause, then kirby waddles up to the window and starts ordering. All of the following was for her, mine and my husbands mouths dropping as she went on and on.

&gt;""HEY YOU, I NEED TO ORDER, COME HERE NOW!, YEAH, OK, I WANT AN ORDER OF NACHOS WITH THE CHILLI ON THEM, 2 CORNDOGS, A FUNNEL CAKE, THE CHICKEN ON A STICK, THE 1/4 LB BACON CHEESEBURGER, AND A SNOWCONE, CHERRY. OH, WAIT AND ONE OF THE LARGE DR PEPPERS""

&gt;""AND DONT YOU DARE MESS IT UP, ITS MY PARTY""

&gt;i feel sick just thinking about that much food between 2 people...it is for her and the fiance, right? RIGHT?!

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;""THATS ALL FOR ME, WHADDA YA WANT GAMER FIANCE??""

&gt;i sneak a peek over and gamer fiance looks embarrassed AF

&gt;""I'll just have a corndog, some nachos, a slushie, and the burger and fries""

&gt;just...

&gt;he will ""just have"" have all of that

&gt;he goes to open his wallet to pay (i didnt catch the total, but with fair prices, i dont want to think about it)

&gt;""NO I SAID THEY HAVE TO PAY, MY DAY, MY WAY, NOW EVERYONE GIVE THE LADY HER MONEY UNLESS YOURE ORDERING, IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING LEFT AFTER I GET DONE, TEEHEE""

&gt; all of the ""friends"" look super pissed, one guy in the group refuses to give her anything

&gt;""I SAID NOW, YOU IDIOT, ARE YOU TRYYYYYING TO RUIN MY PARTY?!""

&gt; guy friend says ""that amount of food is ridiculous, Kirby, I'm not paying for any of it""

&gt;""FINE, JUST GO AWAY THEN!! RUIN MY PARTY, YOU INCONSIDERATE ASS!!""

&gt;the guy went to make a rebuttal, but the kiddos had finished riding their ride and I wanted to get away fast

We walk around for hours without seeing Kirby much. See them at a few games and such, we have been there for 5-6 hours at this point and decide to circle back around to the front of the fair to check out the car exhibit and eat a little. 

&gt;we walk towards the car exhibit and hear yelling coming from the pirate ship ride that goes back and forth

&gt;""GET THE DAMN BAR DOWN YOU IDIOT!""

&gt;kirby is yelling at the attendant because the bar wont click because of her gut

&gt;""PUSH HARDER DUMMY, GOSH, YOU GUYS HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO DO YOUR JOB""

&gt;Kirby finally pushes up on the bar and it sticks

&gt;""OKAAAY YOU CAN GO AWAY NOW, I'M IN. DONT YOU RUIN MY PARTY""

&gt;the attendant looks scared that she might tip the ride over, but everyone else files on and the ride starts

This is where the funniest/grossest thing I have ever seen goes down

&gt;the ride starts without incident

&gt;kirby has her fit friend squished so tight against the side that even if the bar didnt hold, she would be perfectly safe

&gt;the ride starts to go back and forth faster and faster, then..all of the sudden, an odd look goes across kirbys face

&gt;oh my goodness no....yes....noooo

&gt;as the ship goes from the front being in the air, to swinging backwards, all we can hear is ""WHARBLGARBLEGARBLEBUUUUURRRRRF""

&gt;a stream of vomit the size of california perfectly suspends itself in the air as the ship goes back wards, then promptly comes down on everyone in range

&gt;we are both horrified and laughing uncontrollably

&gt;you had to be there to see the perfect timing of it

&gt;those poor people, that stupid, stubborn kirby

&gt;""GIT MEH OFF -WHARRRRRBLE- THIS -GARBLEARBLE- RIIIIIIIDE

&gt;the attendant stops the ride, fair goers are sprinkled in Kirby dust and look pissed

&gt;attendant gets everyone off, but of course, kirbys bar is stuck

We walked into the exhibit at this point to catch some kind of presentation my hubby wanted to see, but we couldn't stop laughing. We wanted to look at the shopping tent next door, so we went out to take the most convenient entrance that would circle us back to the food vendors afterwards, so we could all eat.

&gt;we walk out and Kirby is sitting on ground beside the ship

&gt;""GAH, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH IDIOTS IN MY LIFE, 20 MINUTES TO GET ME OFF THAT THING, YOU ARE PAYING FOR DRY CLEANING, DO YOU HEAR ME, I COULDDA DIED THROWING UP ALL THEM TIMES, STUCK IN THE RIDE LIKE THAT""

&gt;she has a sheen of yellow on her jeans and shirt, that I assume was an attempt to get the puke off herself

&gt;thats when she sees us for the first time, right as we are rounding the first booth in the shopping tent

&gt;all we hear is ""GAH TAKE A PICTURE, IT'LL LAST LONGER YOU BI-""

&gt;I walk into the tent with my husband, laughing, before she can even finish her insult

Good thing the kiddos were wrapped up in Pokemon talk and didnt notice any of this, cause it would have scarred them

We shopped a little, all 4 of us split a funnel cake and some cotton candy (awwww yiss) and left. I dunno when I will see her next, but me and the hubby have been laughing for days about the way she puked on the ride

I kinda wish I had taken her picture since she offered.

OH, and some of you didn't catch that I found out about their snow cone truck.
Her mom used to run it at fairs and such, but when they moved out of their home state, she lost all of her connections and then kirby started using her expensive syrups to make drinks, so it was costing them money, so they sold it for a nice chunk of change.

&gt;working as PC tech/contractor/etc

&gt;company I was working for had offices in various counties

&gt;get call to go to remote office to fix a system that ""just won't work""

&gt;not really friendly with this office, they are weird here, even for Kansas

&gt;site director was a decent guy though

&gt;walk in, immediately am I'm hit by a ""smell"" - sort of like an unflushed toilet, rotten food and about 4000 gallons of various air fresheners

&gt;the secretary greets me, tells me that the system with the problem is in an office in the back

&gt;building is a ""workshop"" for individuals with developmental disabilities

&gt;lots of drool and hugs for those that are into that kind of thing

&gt;ninja my way to the office area

&gt;my worst fears are confirmed when I realize it is an office I have seen before - my body is not prepared

&gt;open the door and the smell goes from noticeable to vomit inducing

&gt;notice that every surface that can hold air freshener, potpourri, scented candles, etc is doing so

&gt;trash can is full of fast food detritus, empty air freshener cans and what look to be diapers

&gt;decor - hardcore ""country girl"" - lots of hearts, cows, john deer, etc

&gt;hear a clicking sound like something is trying to move somewhere but it can't

&gt;notice the chair has no arms, yet at one time it did

&gt;on the wall behind the desk are ""glamour shots"" of the office occupant

&gt;beachedwhalewithafeatherboa.jpg

&gt;I smirk and wade into the danger zone

&gt;I had never dealt with the chick in this office, she was always in meetings or with clients, etc so I didn't know the danger

&gt;I'm here to fix computers and get money, fuck the other bullshit I tell myself

&gt;I head over to the desk and pull the chair out and notice the computer is covered in dirt and obvious spills

&gt;then I realize it's one that I had installed less than 6 months before

&gt;[mrw](http://i.imgur.com/ZsLD9Pr.png)

&gt;standard beige ""Wintel"" box, but damn it, I love my kids (all computers I work on are my children FYI)

&gt;the poor little guy looks beat the fuck up

&gt;missing the front bay covers, front cover is cracked and part is missing, door for CD-ROM tray is gone, with a CD is still in the tray

&gt;it's the clicking sound for sure - not sure what part though

&gt;go to take a seat when I look at the actual seating surface

&gt;it's covered in various colors of smears - fuck dat noise

&gt;decided that it would be best to just take the tower to the hospital (my work bench at the main office)

&gt;walk out of the office and get some oxygen

&gt;go tell site director what's up

&gt;[HRW](http://i.imgur.com/oodCDvz.gif)

&gt;""OK, good luck"" he chuckles

&gt;go back to office and discover a very large woman now is in the chair

&gt;[like this only way fatter](http://www.mybodygallery.com/uploadedPhotos/39000/39289-4.jpg)

&gt;no neck, just rolls

&gt;without warning it began to yell at me

&gt;""I need my computer fixed so I can get my work done now, this is bullshit.""  

&gt;""It's never worked, you guys gave me a broken computer and won't fix it.""  

&gt;""I'm 6 months behind on my paperwork now, so you need to get it fixed right now.""

&gt;""I can't fix it here"" I replied

&gt;""HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WORK THEN?"" the beast roared

&gt;site director was there at this point, asks her to calm down, she realizes that she's not going to win this battle

&gt;I then ask her to move so I can get the tower from the jaws of death

&gt;she gets up and then slowly moves out of the way

&gt;her body is already failing - every time she moves I can hear her bones clicking and grinding

&gt;eventually she waddles into the hallway and I get the computer out of her office and take it back to my work bench

&gt;open the side...and find the source of the click

&gt;the bitch had been using her tower as a fucking trash can and it was the CPU fan hitting some hard plastic

&gt;then I found a mouse den (with free mice and mouse turds!)

&gt;fucking roaches run out of case into the work area - my OCD kicks the fuck in and I use a huge hard cover manual to kill them all (for Novell Netware no less)

&gt;the banging sounds draw the attention of my boss; they want to know what the fuck I'm doing

&gt;then my boss sees the computer - asks ""what the hell happened""

&gt;explain, they sigh, call another manager type person into the office

&gt;in walks the head of HR

&gt;""prepare to be fired"" I tell myself

&gt;HR dude is pretty hefty himself, but he manages to not let it define him

&gt;he asks me ""what happened to this computer?""

&gt;I show him the broken cosmetic parts, the rodent den, and how the power supply has roaches in it

&gt;""Can it be repaired?"" he asks - and I reply that it would need a new CD-ROM drive, a new power supply, a new cooling fan on the CPU, the case would need to be washed out and cleaned off, and that I have not even checked the whole system.

&gt;I suggest just chucking the system - after they both look it over, they agreed with me

&gt;before I toss the system I have to remove the HDD due to HIPPA, snag the RAM and video card, the non-chewed cables and then run it out to the dumpster

&gt;come back in, remove it from the inventory and go about my other tickets and phone calls

&gt;I'm not part of the process for deciding what they were going to do with the office beast - but I never had to deal with her alone again.  

&gt;Hammy was given an older, back up system to use and told that she would not be getting a new box until the next replacement cycle in 3 years.

As I'm leaving work that evening, I see the husband of the [front desk girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1bngc2/the_baby_weight_will_just_go_away/) digging the ruined system out of the dumpster and beaming with joy like he just found a massive gold nugget in a stream.

1374534884.0	1iuhz1	Very Large and Concerned Friend Skinny Shames my 7 Year Old Sister	WizardJenkins	509	84	92	"
Short time lurker, first time poster. Love all the fat people stories, I can relate. Sorry for lack of green text!

My 17 year old, female friend is presumably around 250 pounds, and is mostly in denial about her size and her health, but she's getting a little bit better. We'll call her ""Miss I'll Sit on My Ass Scrolling Tumblr While You Make Me Breakfast Without Offering to Help"" or ""Miss Tumblr"" for short. 

I spent the night and the day with Miss Tumblr, thus my frustration at the breakfast thing. I made food for the family and her. she scarfed hers down without a word and thankfully didn't ask for any more. 

After this she asked to borrow a shirt as she didn't bring one to my house. Whut. They won't fit, but I'll humor her. I gave her my two largest shirts (that I mostly use for pajamas) to try on and she stretched them all the way over her large breasteses and belly and began complaining about the way they fit. Or rather, didn't fit at all. She then found one of my regular shirts, triumphantly pulled it out of the rest of my shirts, grinned and me and asked, ""Can I wear this?"" 

Uh, sure Miss T, that'll fit perfectly after the huge Ts you just failed to squeeze into. I don't need that shirt back anyway, go ahead and keep it.

She miraculously pulled it over her gigantic boobs and squeezed it further. It looked about to rip, was barely over her belly button and her fat was just falling right out of the bottom. But she didn't find anything to complain about, probably because unlike the previous t shirts this one was V-necked and showed off her voluptuous boobs.

Okay. if you think that looks good, I'm not going to argue with you. Goodbye t-shirt, we had a good run.

Now to the bit I still can't believe happened.

Some background: My seven year old sister is very skinny. She's just a really thin kid, not unhealthy, but you can imagine why someone would think that she needs more sugar and fat to cover up dem knobby knees. 

We were out for the day (with my younger sister) and were just heading back home at around 3 pm. We stopped to get some gas and a drink or something to eat at the store there. I got a drink, my little sister didn't want anything, and Miss T got a pint of gelato. Because gelato is much healthier than ice cream, obviously. As she's chowing down on this treat with barely a pause for breath, I realized my sister didn't eat any lunch and I ask if she's sure she doesn't want anything (she's gotta be hungry, and I feel bad for forgetting about it.)

I heard Miss T pause in her slurping fest to turn around and say, ""Do you LIKE looking at your bones?""

What the fuck.

""Look at your knees honey, they're all bones. That's gross. I'm scared."" 

She literally said that to a seven year old. I was in shock. She still managed to shove some sugar in her mouth while speaking.

""You're so skinny! You need to eat more. Eating so little is unhealthy and I -"" I managed to shut her the fuck up. My little sister looked about to cry and put her head on her knees and didn't speak for the rest of the ride. 

Don't worry, I let Miss T know that what she said wasn't okay in the least. Even after elaborating on body image and my sister's self esteem she still didn't seem to get it. I think she honestly thought that only fat people would be upset when you insulted their bodies. I was livid but she could barely process what she did wrong.

I know, I know, so beta. But our families are friends and I had to deal with it the way I did.

Once we got home I had to undo the damage that Miss T did to my sister. After awhile she felt 100% better and we made some cookies together. 

Who the fuck insults a seven year old's body? How in that twisted, fat-logic infested mind did she justify herself? 

I'm sure Miss T's fatlogic might strike again, but at least she'll stay away from my little sister from now on.

1373393372.0	1hy6oe	Male Hamplanet Dating Horror	terpin	518	95	90	"I have more of these, but I will start with the worst.

&gt;me then 22yo f, hamplanet in early stages of formation, honest about it


&gt;HDH (hamplanet dating horror) 30yo, m, NOT HONEST ABOUT HAMPLANETUDE AT ALL


&gt;RM (roommate) 27 yo, m, thin guy


HDH told me he'd gotten surgery to control his weight, we discussed art and life and stuff. He would give me advice about getting my life under control and had sent me a few selfies, said he was 5'10 and 200 (down from 500), I figured he was just self conscious after losing so much weight. I had sent tons and tons of photos of myself. We always made plans to hang out, go on walks together, etc, but never worked out. We finally met up for a date at my house. The horror begins.

I hear something banging on the railing outside. My apartment was on ground level, but you have to take 5 steps up and 5 steps down to get to it. 

I get up, thinking the neighbour's toddler is on the loose again. I open the door. HDH is there, clutching a cooler, a 2 liter bottle of pepsi, a cigarette and the faceplate to his stereo.


&gt;HDH: YER NEIGHBOURHOOD IS SO DANGERUS I HAD TO BRING ALL MY STUFF WITH ME UP ALL THESE STAIRS.


&gt;HDH is humongous. I am in awe that he was able to leave his home. He weighs about 400lbs (200lbs MORE than he said he was) and is only 5'7 (3 inches shorter than he said he was). 


&gt;Me be sad that he lied, but thought we could still hang out anyway. we had cool convos... right?


&gt;He comes in my door and discovers that you have to go down a 3' wide hallway to get to the lounge.


&gt;HDH proceeds to crabwalk sideways, complaining that his ""port is giving him trouble"".


&gt;Turns out HDH JUST had his lapband surgery 4 days previously. He'd lied for months. 


&gt;HDH sits on couch, it creaks awfully bad. Tentatively, I offer an old computer chair to him instead, couch 
belongs to roommate.


&gt;HDH demands I give him a cigarette, complains about it being a menthol. He sucks back soda and proceeds to smoke out of my pack and his own.


&gt;Me has never really had a guy over to my place before and I'm from the South so I really want to be nice to guests. I figure we can eat a pizza and then he can go home.


&gt;Me suggest splitting a pizza, but he isn't having it. ""I've been drinking weight loss shakes for months, I want to bulk up!""


&gt;ohmyfuckinggoddontlaugh.jpg


&gt;Me starts asking about why he lied. He puts one hamfist up in the ""bitch please"" position. ""You're fat too. It's not like you can judge. You should be happy anyone is interested in you."" Rage begins to boil inside of me. Ordered a pizza, can't back out now.


&gt;Pizza arrives, I pay and bring it back down to the lounge. Thus begins the true horror.


&gt;HDH removes all the toppings from his pizza into a neat pile on the inner top lid of his pizza box. He begins to lick the top part of his pizza repeatedly, like a stamp. Over and over again, I hold back the urge to vomit.


&gt;HDH: ""When you get the lapband surgery your throat can seize up, so you have to make sure that the food is as easy to digest as possible. Saliva is the first step in digestion, did you know that?"" 


&gt;His eyes beam at me while he's licking his pizza. I think this is some kind of foreplay for him. I look away, start texting my roommate what's going on. ""not a rapist, but total creeper. please come home, please no one will ever believe me.""


&gt;HDH has finished eating his bread from his medium pizza. I figured it was over, but then he starts licking the toppings, I excuse myself to the patio for a cigarette. I still hadn't touched my pizza. 


&gt;I smell something awful inside my house, so I go back inside. There was a massive amount of weed inside his cooler and he's decided to smoke himself out in my home. 


&gt;Me: ""HDH! THAT'S NOT COOL MY ROOMMATE GETS UAs REGULARLY WTF!"" 


&gt;HDH: ""Whatever. I haven't been able to smoke for months because I was prepping for the surgery.""


&gt;He's got a fresh slice in his hand with toppings on it. I look around, he has my pizza behind his chair.


&gt;Me: ""HDH! THAT'S SO NOT FUCKING COOL!""


&gt;HDH: ""Whatever. I'll smoke you out, you weren't eating it anyway.""


&gt;My rage grows, I want him to go but the odor of skank weed is so pungent that my neighbours would smell it and call the cops if I opened the door. This hamplanet is here to stay. Get a text from roommate, he's on the way home.


&gt;RM has arrived. He is pissed that the place smells of skank weed, stops in hallway watching curious ritual of pizza licking.


&gt;HDH: ""You want some?""


&gt;RM shakes head, disgusted.


&gt;HDH starts talking about exwife that left him because he was too fat, how she took all the forks to spite him. ""Haha joke's on her, now I have an excuse to treat myself every day!""


&gt;HDH proceeds to talk about how if I played my cards right I could be the new Mrs. HDH; I'd have to do something about my torso though because I was just too fat in the arms and under my boobs.


&gt;RM loses shit. Direct quote: ""She's just fine. You're a fat fucking asshole. If you don't leave right now I'm going to sodomize the shit out of you.""


&gt;HDHs' face twists in horror. ""Whoa, I was just joking. Fat people give each other shit, it's not cool to say shit like that when you're not as heavy as we are."" 


&gt;RM stands up and balls fists. ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF OUR HOUSE NOW.""


&gt;HDH: Snatches pepsi, faceplate for stereo and my pizza box and crabwalks out the door. Leaves cooler of bad weed.


&gt;RM: ""Never have anyone over here again alone. If he was 200lbs lighter he would be cutting off girls' faces and licking them.""

And I never invited anyone over alone again. Lesson learned. He still tried to talk to me after that though, I told him to go fuck himself.

**TLDR**; Male hamplanet lies about everything for 2 months before date, licks pizza before he eats it to aid in digestion, smokes skank weed in my house and insults my smaller body to the point where my roommate had to threaten to sodomize him if he didn't get the fuck out of our apartment."	t5_2vzax	True
1372905013.0	1hly10	Chubwub the Hamtub	CV13	511	87	65	"Buckle up my fatties (here’s a seat belt extender just for you) because the court sentence has come down and I’m now allowed to talk about the two craziest weeks of my life. But you’ll have to wait for those stories. First you’ll have to hear the prologue. I’ll go ahead and introduce the villain now and get that out of the way. Meet Chubwub the Hamtub, a 5’4” 300lb REAL WOMAN made almost entirely, I would assume, of cream cheese filling. 

There's a dash of fat logic at the end, but it's mainly to get the background for the juicy stuff. 

&gt;Be me, 6’2” and 205 pounds down from 245 pounds after a rugby injury.

&gt;Been single a while but feeling good about myself after dropping the weight.

&gt;Thinking it’s time to get a lady again.

&gt;Some of my friends that are still in college host one of their house party. I decide to attend for the first time since graduating (almost a year).

&gt;Get there, feeling good, enjoying some bevs. I be mirin’ the ladies  and optimistically interpreting their glances towards me as mirin’.

&gt;In walks Chubwub the Hamtub.

Now, I say that she walked in, but that is really an offense to the entire evolutionary process that gifted us with legs. What this rotund heavy-cream creature does can’t truly be described as walking. No, she instead does is what I have come to call the Chub Shuffle. She would lean all of her weight onto her left leg (actually causing me to believe her subsequent knee problem complaints) and slide her right foot forward about 18 inches. The foot doesn’t leave the ground, it just slides. She then begins the process of transferring her weight to the now outstretched right foot. Once that monumental task is accomplished, she slides her left foot up even with her right foot and starts the process over. Notice I said EVEN with her right foot. Her left foot never lead in this awkward amble but always followed behind her right foot. It made for quite the spectacle. 

I recognized Chubwub from my college’s dining hall where she seemed to be a permanent fixture in a corner booth. I had never seen her move from that spot which is why I was so transfixed now. 

&gt;Shouldn’t stare. Shouldn’t stare. Shouldn’t stare.

&gt;Can’t help it, all I can think about it is that it’s a good thing we’re not near the coast or the tidal fluctuations from this prehistoric manatee’s oscillatory gait would have destroyed the ecosystem beyond repair. 

&gt;OH GOD EYE CONTACT. 

&gt;I avert my eyes quickly, but not before a little smirk crosses her pudgy face. I staring intently at the floor, but steal a glance upwards. Chubwub is making her way over to me with her exaggerated waddle. Then the mayonnaise mastodon caught sight of the food bar and I was saved. 

&gt;Unfortunately, no such grace was given to the snacks

&gt;At this time we’ll have a moment of silence for all the heroic food that fell defending my sanity. Here’s to you serving bowl filled with kraft macaroni. We’ll never forget what you did family sized bags of fritos, cheetos, and BBQ Lays. And the astounding service given by the three cheeseburgers will never be forgotten.

No seriously, she ate all of those things at the party. To be fair, it was over a two hour period, but that hardly excuses it. At one point she grabbed an entire thing of KFC and I watched one tub devour another. 

&gt;Her hunger now sated, Chubwub continues her original hunt for me. 

&gt;She waddles towards me, but thanks to the near unbelievable slowness of the Chub Shuffle, I am able to easily escape any sort of social encounter. 

&gt;We then began the least exciting chase scene most people could imagine, but the most terrifying one I have ever been a part of. 

&gt;I go up to a group of people I haven’t seen since school, talk to them for awhile. Can only  stay a few minutes because Chubwub is in pursuit.

&gt;Chat up a hottie at the wall. Not enough time to get her number before the smell of what I can only imagine was grease deodorant filled my nostrils and I was forced to move on. 

I now respect those old George A. Romero zombie movies. You don’t think those slow moving, mindless creatures are anything to be scared of. But their true terror comes in their persistence. They’ll never get up. Someday, you’ll stop running, and then they’ll get you. I shared a similar fate that night. 

&gt;Get introduced to a group of girls I had never met before. Engaged in friendly conversation.

&gt;Feel rubbing on my back and an awful, sickly heat. 

&gt;Turn around and realize my worst nightmares. 

&gt;Chubwub the Hamtub has caught me and seems to be grinding all over my back. I can’t tell if it’s just her natural heat or if it’s friction caused from her ample folds of skin gyrating across my body. Regardless, I am disgusted beyond belief. 

&gt;“LETS DANCE HONAY” she moans, her breath reeking of fried chicken and crushed dreams. 

&gt;I look around the room, no one else is dancing. It’s not even that kind of party. 

&gt;“Um, no thanks. I was just talking to these...” I start saying while taking a few steps back, an audible SQUELCH happens as I liberated myself from HER CURVES.

&gt;She cuts me off “NO NEED TO TALK TO THESE SKANKS WHEN YOU COULD BE DANCING WITH ME. I SAW YOU STARING AT ME EARLIER. LUCKY YOU I’M INTERESTED.”

I regret to inform you that she failed to call herself a REAL WOMAN. She chose to save that phrase for a later encounter. 


&gt;She Chub Shuffles her way towards me again, doing what I assume is a dance.

&gt;At a loss for words I put my hands up and continue backing away, shaking my head vigorously.

&gt;This angers the beast. 

&gt;“WHY THE FUCK AREN’T YOU DANCING WITH ME? IS IT BECAUSE I’M BIG?” She has stopped the Chub Shuffle as well as her grotesque attempts at dancing but her rolls continue to gyrate like crazy. I assume this goes on for hours after she moves. 

&gt;“YOU LIKE THESE SKINNY BITCHES MORE THAN THIS? YOU A SHALLOW FAT SHAMER OR JUST A FAGGOT OR SUMTHIN?”

At this point the entire party is staring at us and I felt my face is growing red. I feared that she would mistake it for a plate of hot wings so I had to think fast to get this situation under control. I did the polite thing, I lied. I would later come to regret this greatly. 

&gt;“No, I’m just not in the mood for dancing, that’s all” I cast my hands around the room, trying to indicate that the setting just wasn’t right.

&gt;This seems to calm Chubwub.

I fled the scene soon after, but my nightmare didn’t end there. Encounter two would happen about a month later.

""Army Bro"" said he wanted to help write this one, so everyone say hi! He wanted to make sure every detail was right, because the karaoke and end of night parts need to be told right, he also says his girlfriend doesnt read reddit, which will be important info when you read the events of the night we saw how crazy she is.

So, things had been kind of un-eventful until PM and PD won a trip through PD's work, PM asked if I could take Oversized Kirby to the bank when her check came in, and maybe to the store while they were gone, as a friend was going to be borrowing the truck. This picks up the day PM and PD left.

&gt;Be me getting up early to get a few things done

&gt;Army bro is staying with me and husband now until he is deployed

&gt;decide to get friends together that night for karaoke and drinks, maybe some dinner before

&gt;hear knock on door, OK got her disability check and needs to go to bank

&gt;Army bro hides before I answer the door to avoid her, because she has been trying to seduce him since the cookout

&gt;tell her to wait just a sec so i can get my keys and put my shoes on

&gt;walk out to car

&gt;she struggles to get in, so I have to scoot the seat back

&gt;car literally is tilting to one side and has trouble taking off cause of 480 lbs of extra weight

&gt;had found out her exact weight when she bragged about it loudly on her back porch on the phone one night

&gt;take off to bank, get a call from husband to confirm dinner and karaoke with friends

&gt;had him on the car speakerphone so she hears, then promptly exclaims ""OHHH I LOVE THAT RESTAURANT, AND I LOOOOVE KARAOKE, I'M COMING WITH Y'ALL"" and just like that, invites herself

&gt;awkward silence

&gt;while she's in bank, warn friends about OK, they actually don't believe she is like that and beg me to let her come so they can witness it first hand

&gt;OK gets in car and announces she's hungry so she wants to go home and go to grocery later

&gt;fine with me, got doctor appointment anyways

&gt;on the way home, OK gets a call from her ""boyfriend"" who she later tells me is someone she just met on W.o.W and lives on the other side of the country

&gt;proceeds to have some sort of weird phone sex while sitting in my car

&gt;literally, she is talking about her vag and how she has it ""vajazzled"" and what she wants him to do to it, strokes her breasts at one point

&gt;allofmywats and allofmyewwwwww.mpeg

&gt;thank all that is good when I drop her off at home

&gt;febreeze the fuck out of my car and spray lysol on her seat because I am so grossed out

&gt;she says she will be at our house around 5 to go out

&gt;I'm allowing her to go to prove to friends how awful she is

&gt;5 pm rolls around and there is a knock on the door, OK has arrived last

&gt;All of my friends, army bro and his girlfriend, and my husband have been hanging out all day

&gt;friends just stare at OK awkwardly, realizing I wasn't exaggerating her size

&gt;OK comes in and says she is STARVING and we need to go eat now, then winks at army bro

&gt;OK says ""ARMMMY BROOOOO! I added you on facebook, where have you been?? Can I ride with you to the restaurant? teehee!""

&gt;Girlfriend of Army Bro, who i will refer to as GAB, promptly says ""no"", that the car is full already

&gt;OK is gonna have to ride with us, in the backseat of a Honda...

&gt;OK glares at GAB and says ""We really need to go eat, you look like you're going to implode""

&gt;Army Bro stops her from socking her

&gt;Friends just stare in shock

&gt;toldyouso.avi

&gt;somehow OK crams into the backseat of the car, but complains the whole way to the restaurant that she cant move

&gt;finally get to restaurant

&gt;OK says she wants a booth, waitress explains there isnt one big enough for our party

&gt;OK takes it personal and says ""let me speak to your mamager""

&gt;not ""manager"", she actually thinks it is pronounced ""mamager"" and will argue with you about it if you disagree

&gt;confused hostess get manager 

&gt;OK says that hostess is making fun of her weight and she expects a discount

&gt;manager explains that is not the case, but all the booths with assigned staff are occupied

&gt;all my friends are in disbelief, keep thinking ""told you she was that bad""

&gt;OK finally accepts 12 seat table and sits at the end

&gt;there was 9 of us, thats why no booth, but, fat logic

&gt;waiter takes drink order and asks if we want appetizer, we all decide on 2 queso dips to split between the 9 of us

&gt;OK orders 2 more apps, one queso, one onion ring 

&gt;we assume its for everyone to split

&gt;lol nope

&gt;she orders the biggest steak they have, a loaded baked potato with double everything, and extra side of veggies and loudly announces she needs the veggies to ""eat healthy!""

&gt;friends all look in horror as she orders a diet coke for the same reason, then proceeds to slap friends hand away when apps are brought out

&gt;she eats BOTH appetizers before our food even arrives

&gt;her breath can now be smelled across the table, queso and onion breath

&gt;starts flirting with army bro again

&gt;GAB is in the bathroom at this point so isnt around to hear this

&gt;so army brooooooo -she says it like this every time- yoou gonna sing me a song tonight at karaoke? Ive got one I'm gonna sing for you

&gt;tries to bat her eyelashes, friend leans over and whispers to ask if that was a wink because her eyebrow fat just kind of wiggled

&gt;army bro, says ""no, i'm not much for singing, probably gonna have a few beers""

&gt;but army broooooooo we need us a song!

&gt;army bro is confused says ""well, GAB will probably sing our song, she usually does at karaoke""

&gt;fat rage engage (someone please name their rock band this)

&gt;""Army Broooo, I told you at the BBQ that you need some real curves and not that stick you have, you could have all THIS!""

&gt;she says this as she rolls her fat fingers down her side and does that weird ""seductive twist"" she apparently thinks is alluring

&gt;friends are still in shock, dont think they ever came out of shock the whole night

&gt;army bro has finally had it and says ""OK, i'm just gonna tell you this straight, I don't want you, the only rolls I'm interested in are the one's sitting in this basket on the table, I have GAB, and we have been together for a long time and we are very happy""

&gt;army bro actually is proposing TONIGHT, because it is their anniversary on the 3rd 

NOTE FROM ARMY BRO-- dont worry GAB doesnt even come on reddit, so theres no chance GAB will see this, WISH ME LUCK!--

&gt;Kirby actually freaking says ""we will see about that, I'll have my hands on you by the end of the night army broooooo"" wink wink....jiggle jiggle....

&gt;GAB returns at this moment and asks why everyone looks like they've seen a ghost

&gt;OK says, ""oh, they just don't wanna accept the inevitable"" and looks her up and down like a bag of cheetos, about to be ravaged by the might of the Oversized Kirby spin

&gt;Army Bro point blank tells GAB that OK is flirting with him again

What happens next, I WISH I WAS MAKING UP, it was amazing and embarassing all in one. OK has been flirting with ARMY bro for weeks at this point, and since he is staying with us until deployment, he has seen OK from a lot while outside, and OK has been flirting with him in front of GAB, and GAB has told her to back off more times than we can count.

&gt;GAB grabs the pitcher of water on the table, gets up

&gt;and.pours.it.in.Kirbys.lap followed by ""I've told you to fucking BACK OFF you fat, annoying waste of flesh, he DOES NOT WANT YOU, and you need to back off of other peoples men, you elephant looking bitch.""

&gt;slams water pitcher down and goes back to her seat

&gt;mfw [the whole place is silent] (http://imgur.com/gallery/NXV1u)

&gt;OK is stunned into silence for once, gets up and goes to the bathroom

&gt;manager comes over and says we will have to leave if we cant calm down

&gt;I explain what happened, he tries so hard to stifle a laugh, but fails, then recognizes someone at the table, who proceeds to tell him about OK and her awful personality

&gt;manager leaves, comes back with a round for everyone, and the poor waitress starts cleaning up water, I get up to help cause, feel bad for her

&gt;OK comes back with red eyes and I feel bad for half a second until she says, ""thanks GAB, you made my pants tighter, maybe I can pick one of these other lucky guys we have with us up, or maybe Army Brooooo will change his mind, teeheee!""

&gt;Every.fucking.guy.at.our.table.stops.eating.the.queso.and.looks.in.horror.

&gt;friend leans over and tells me that tonight he is fully gay

&gt;Army Bro has to literally hold GAB down and talk her out of just punching her lights out and giving her another verbal assault

&gt;lets her in on the secret that we are proving to our friends how awful she is and to roll with it, GAB agrees

&gt;Our food comes, OK is done eating before we are even half way finished and orders dessert, 2 slices of cheesecake. So thats, queso and chips, onion rings, steak, a double loaded baked potato, veggies that she barely touched, and 2 slices of cheesecake

&gt;we all try to finish fast so we can get to the bar and get hammered since we have a DD for each car

&gt;OH, but it's not gonna be that easy!!

&gt;OK leans over and says ""watch this!!"" teeheee.......huehuehuehue

&gt;she pulls a FUCKING CIGARETTE SULLOFANE OUT OF HER PURSE WITH 2 BUGS IN IT!""

&gt; [MFW] (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t8BTKgFtbdQ/TxXGLpC2jfI/AAAAAAAADK8/ftYuWO-O-nQ/s1600/56975245-wtf.gif)

&gt;also my friend said this ran through his head as he saw it happening [this right here, yes] (http://imgur.com/r/gifs/piWrdKA)

&gt;Kirby dumps the bugs into her veggies, and before we can say anything she starts SCREAMING at the top of her lungs that there's bugs in her food and damands a ""mamager""

&gt;at this point we think our friends have taken the hint that she really is a fatty with an AWFUL attitude, and they are all sitting there with their mouths open

&gt;manager comes over and takes her off to the side, as he does, one of our girl friends says she has to see what she does at karaoke, she can't stop watching this trainwreck of a person

&gt;some of the table considers calling it a night, but at this point, EVERYONE wants to get hammered, so we decide to go on to karaoke with her

&gt;hear manager at this point saying that our waitress saw her put the bugs in the food herself

&gt;Kirby starts screaming that waitress is a ""fucking liar"" and she isn't paying

&gt;manager says if she doesn't pay, that he will have her escorted off the property in handcuffs

&gt;Kirby damands bill and says she will never come back

&gt;manager informs her that that is ok, because he is officially banning her from the establishment for good for being loud, rude, and planting things in her food to get a free meal.

&gt;Kirby starts crying, saying this is her favorite place and that he can't do that

&gt;Manager doesn't back down, says if she wants it bad enough, she will have to get food to go and have someone pick it up for her

&gt;waitress arrives with our checks

&gt;Kirby waddles back over, gets out exact change, slams it on the table, calls the waitress a ""snitching cunt"" and storms out

&gt;we stay behind and console the poor waitress, and I notice a pin on her apron that indicates the waitress is new, and she tells us this is her first job and first night out of training

&gt;Manager says to us after Kirby leaves that he gave everyone but OK a 50% discount because he felt sorry for us

&gt;there are 8 of us, we all pay, and between the 8 of us, we leave her a $20 tip each, which in the end gives her a $160 cash tip and tell her to not give up, that she was an awesome waitress

After this fiasco, we promise both DDs that we will spring for whatever they want from the Liquor store, and they can get hammered once we get back home, they accept and out the door we go

1368511225.0	1easot	Hamplanet orbits the Earth	CitizenTed	503	78	116	"There have surely been many FPS airplane stories. This one is mine. 

Back in 2003, I booked a RT flight from Seattle to London to visit my sister and see English stuff. I'm a 6'0"" 190lb guy, fairly normal-looking. Got into my row, sat down, prepared my books and magazines and awaited my seatmate. 

Enter Americansus Adipemosis. She motions to the middle seat. I remove myself to the aisle and watch as this enormous woman flomps down into the middle seat. A thin, elderly Asian woman in the window seat winced as the great lump lowered itself into the groaning seat. 

Rules being rules, the armrests were up and the bulk was spilling over in great rolls of converted starch. I was barely able to squeeze myself into my chair and tried mightily to console myself that I'd only be enduring this woman's flab against my chest for...10 hours. The flight staff fitted her with an extra 12 meters of seat belt to keep her from pitching forward like a canon ball should the worst happen. 

In retrospect, I should have bailed out immediately. But I will return to that concept later. 

At takeoff, the pilot had to adjust the starboard aileron just a bit in order to keep the ship even with the horizon, but eventually the mighty jet cleared the clouds and we were off. The moment the seat belt lights went dim, Hamplanet yanked up the armrests and the full onslaught broke across the de-militarized zone. I was now squished fully against my left armrest. The crushing bulk literally twisted me, nearly lifting me out of my chair. My natural reaction was to stand up and GTFO of there. So I did. 

As I looked down at my chair, a great sense of loss enveloped me. Pizza the Hut had all but consumed my chair. I had only 60% (at best) of my seat left. The rest was taken over by the Zerg Creep. I no longer had a seat on this aircraft. I looked at Hamplanet. She ignored me. After all, what could I say? ""Hey! Lose 200 pounds while I take a leak, willya?"" 

I marched off the the flight staff. Two of them accompanied me to my seat. They took one look, then grabbed me by the arm and walked me to the rear of the aircraft. With that renown British calm in the face of adversity, they explained to me:

""We agree your seat is gone. But the flight's fully booked, even business and first. We can't move you. What we can do is this: for the duration of the flight, we can let you sit in one of the jump seats. This is against the rules, but these are extreme circumstances. The jump seat isn't very comfy, but it's all we can offer you. In return for your patience, you can have all the food and drinks you want; just ask."" 

They were actually very nice about it, and when I contemplated the situation, this was the only logical solution, seeing as Hamplanet would never fit in a jump seat. Of course, this also meant no in-flight entertainment for me. Just my books. 

I watched Greenland and Iceland slither by from my tiny jump seat window. I ate good hot food and cold drinks and spent a lot of time chatting amiably with the flight staff in the rear of the plane. It was  a very long 9 hours, but it could have been worse. And yea, it got worse. 

As we approached London, I was required to return to my ""seat"". I looked at Hamplanet. She looked at me. I said nothing. There was nothing to say. I sat down on left hip, my ass and back pressed against the flab. That was the only way I could squeeze in. The armrest was never coming back down. It couldn't. This was it. 

For the next 25 minutes, I writhed against the onslaught. My back started giving me shooting pains. I wrestled to find a position that alleviated the pain, but none were possible. If I were a lesser man, I'd have cried. But I was in England now, the land of the Stiff Upper Lip. 

As soon as the pilot cut the engines, I burst out of my seat and stepped back. My back was aching. I struggled to get my carry-on. I hobbled off the aircraft like a hunchback. Sick of all this bullshit, I dropped $100 on a cab ride. Fuck the train, fuck the bus. I wanted a beeline to my hotel, along with a triple dose of ibuprofin. And that's what I did. 

In retrospect, I should not have stayed on that airplane. As soon as it became clear that I had no seat, I had no right to be there. I should have insisted that either Hamplanet takes a later flight, or I take a later flight. For me, it would have cost me a day of vacation - a day I would have GLADLY surrendered if I could have enjoyed a civilized flight with, like, a seat. 

Never again. The next time I'm sat next to a Hamplanet, quiet acquiescence is not in the cards. Business, pleasure, whatever. If they cannot provide me with a seat, I will insist on being removed and booked on a later flight. It's me or the Hamplanet, airlines. Pick one.

I recognize everyone struggles with their body image and a person's personal choices are their choices and I respect that.  I do however cringe when I see a person fall into and reinforce a negative stereotype.  
That being said I begin the story. 

My wife had never been to a Brazilian steak house, and we were out and about in a large city that had one of these lovely places.  I made reservations and kind of kept it a surprise.   
For those of you unfamiliar with a Brazilian steak house it is all you can eat, however the kicker is these places bring the food to you!  They bring you TOP SHELF grade A amazingly cooked meats.  Some even offer exotic meats.  These places also have wait staff that will bend over backwards for you.  You are treated like royalty and dine in excess of some of the best meats available.   Honestly these places are for special occasions only for me because I always feel guilty for how well I am treated and how expensive the meal is.   
So my wife and I sit down and she is loving this place.  I order her a capirina and we get the night started.    
In the corner by himself is a man.  A man that is basically 4 men put together, he is eating and eating and eating.   He is screaming at the waiters to bring him food, and he keeps going and going.   
Now like I said I normally dont judge, but he is getting loud and obnoxious and I decide to make it a little less awkward by joking to my wife ""That guy has been there since yesterday"".

Not long after this joke, the guy vomits.      
He vomits all over the table and himself.  Its spills onto the floor and it is just fucking disgusting.   It was like this stream of at least 5 fucking liters of chunky chewed meat.   I felt faint, and my wife gagged a little.   It was bloody disgusting.   

The wait staff notice,  and like I said they will bend over backwards, so what do they do.... they set the Fat fucker into a new table, clean the vomit, and keep feeding him. This guy kept going.   I have since been reluctant to go back to a Brazilian steak house. 


TLDR:  Fat fucker goes to brazilian steak house, eats so much he vomits.  relocates to a new table and continues eating. "	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;there was a great shaking; cue hammy in blouse

&gt;And there in the kitchen stood this friend of a friend

&gt;helping my food meet its unfortunate end

&gt;this moon looked at me with utter disdain

&gt;she spake 'DIS IS MAINE' and began eating again

&gt;I stood there agahst, when what should appear?

&gt;twas a 6'8"" man bringing plenty of beer

&gt;With a little old driver, so lively and quick

&gt;I knew in a moment it must be buff Nick

&gt;More rapid than eagles his curses they came

&gt;And he whistled, and shouted, and called her by name!

&gt;To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

**Chapter Seventeen**

Like an artist obsessed with detail but cursed with an uncooperative canvas, I took to grooming myself in preparation for the evening. I shaved as close to my skin as my disposable razor would allow, and even made an attempt at plucking my eyebrows. (After removing a single hair, I decided that they looked fine.) A second shower became a necessity after a mishap with some hair spray, and then a frantic third after an accident involving cologne. There was ample time to spare before the party was due to begin, but I had hoped to leave myself an hour for a visit to the store. A tray of vegetables, I had decided, would serve as both a peace offering to Porcina and an alternative to all of the heavier foods that would no doubt be available... and if she didn't like the produce, well, tough titties, I supposed.

An appropriate choice of clothing posed another problem. My plan was to take Lauren out for dinner, and the restaurant I had chosen was only a short distance away from a brief hiking trail that led to a romantic hilltop. I had hoped – barring any issues with indigestion – to guide her there after our meal, taking the gentle path up to its starlit plateau, where it overlooked the city. Unfortunately, dress shoes seemed rather ill-suited to traversing earthen terraces, and I cringed slightly at the thought of including more casual options in my outfit. I had requested that Lauren dress warmly and ensure that her feet would be comfortable, but following my own advice for footwear was proving somewhat difficult. In the end, I chose to stow a pair of sneakers in the trunk of my car, along with a blanket and two flashlights, just to be on the safe side.

Still another issue arose when I arrived at my local market. The end of finals, the start of winter break, and the mere fact that it was Saturday had all combined to encourage every consumer in the area towards descending on the store like locusts, resulting in an impatient crowd of shoppers all competing for choice items. Fortunately, and to my immense relief, a vegetable tray of the variety that I had envisioned was still available and waiting for me. Had I been a believer in such things, I would have taken it as a sign, a cosmic indication that the evening would be devoid of problems.

I should have known better, of course.

The first sign of trouble manifested as I arrived once more at the townhouse. I had opted to appear fashionably late, hoping to find Porcina distracted, and yet no signs of life were evident. Perhaps, I speculated, the bulk of the gathering was taking place in the area behind the building, which served as a communal back yard for much of the nearby community. I approached the door – noting the handwritten sign upon it which read “COME ON IN XOXO” – and walked into the living room.

It was all but deserted. The only person in sight was Aaron, seated on the couch with a portable game system in his hands. “Where is everyone?” I asked. The man didn't respond. “Aaron,” tried again, “am I early?” Once again, no answer. A table had been set up nearby, ostensibly for bearing snacks, but other than a half-empty bowl of popcorn, no nourishment was in evidence. I deposited my vegetable tray alongside it nonetheless, feeling thoroughly bewildered and more than a little uneasy. “Hello?” I called. “Lauren?” Then, a little bit quieter, “Porcina?”

“In here,” came a reply, originating from Porcina's room. Flashes of the nightmare from weeks before played across my mind, but the voice had been possessing of neither an allegedly playful whine nor a particularly grating edge. Still, I approached cautiously, ready to retreat if it should become necessary.

Porcina sat atop her bed, facing away from the door. Lauren sat beside her, looking absolutely resplendent in a midnight-blue dress, but with a look of tired sympathy on her face. “Hey,” I ventured. “What's going on? Where is everybody?”

“*NOOOOOOOO*!” I jumped at Porcina's wailing cry, and watched as she pounded on the wall. “No, no, no! *NOOOOOOO*!” I could hear her sobbing in between each scream, and my alarm gave way to concern. This was more than just a tantrum. Something was actually *wrong*.

“Shh, shh.” Lauren soothingly petted her roommate's shoulder. “It's okay.”

“It's *not*!” Porcina argued. “It's *not*, it's *not*, it's *not*!” She blew her nose on an unseen tissue (I hoped). “This was supposed to be *my* party! *Mine*! It was supposed to be *mine*!”

“Aaron seems okay with it!” said Lauren. “He loves the game you got for him!”

“It's *not* okay!” Porcina insisted. “It's all a bunch of *shit*!”

I hesitantly took another step forward. “What happened?”

Lauren's expression went through notes of frustration, weariness, empathy, and doubt. “Only a few people showed up,” she explained. “They left pretty quickly.”

“Well, hey, it's still early,” I suggested. Porcina replied with another round of sobs. I stood for what felt like several minutes, watching as Lauren tried to calm her roommate. For all the girl had put me through, I felt sorry for Porcina. “I'm sure more folks will turn up soon,” I said after awhile. “Why don't we go see how Aaron's doing in the meantime?” And maybe get him to talk, I silently added.

By virtue of some small miracle, Porcina responded positively to the idea. She shuffled to face me with a tear-soaked smile and held out her hands. “*Ooooooooh*,” she said, “you're right. Come give me a hug!”

I did. It was unpleasant... but I had experienced worse.

The three of us returned to the living room, where Aaron was still engrossed with his game. It wasn't the best start to things but there were still options. If more people arrived, then Lauren and I could easily make our exit. If not, I could suggest that maybe Porcina would want to spend her last night with Aaron unsupervised. One way or another, though, I was not about to have the evening ruined.

“Hi, sweet*iiiiiiiiiiiie*!” Porcina gushed, enveloping Aaron in her arms. She planted a sloppy kiss on his cheek and smiled affectionately. “Do you like your *gaaaaaaame*?”

“My suggestion,” Lauren whispered from beside me. I nodded, having suspected as much.

“Oh! What did you *briiiiing*?” Porcina then asked of me.

I pointed to the table. “A vegetable tray. I don't really care for snow peas, but –”

In an instant, the tears returned. “*FUCK YOOOOOOU*!” screamed Porcina. “Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, *FUCK YOOOOOOU*!”

“What the *hell* is wrong now?” I demanded. “I didn't *have* to bring anything!”

“It was *you*!” Porcina screached. “*You* did it!”

“Porcina, no he didn't,” Lauren said. “He just got here.”

I threw out my hands, imploring. “Did *what*?”

“*YOU TOLD THEM I HAVE HERPES*!”

I don't know what hit me harder: The implied detail about Porcina's health, or the fact that she blamed me for other people knowing. 

“*What*?” I sputtered. I remembered, in abject horror, how I had considered sleeping with her, wondering even then if a thin rubber shield would have saved me. I looked at Lauren. She nodded quietly. The meaning was all too clear.

“Not contagious.” All eyes in the room, even Porcina's, turned to face Aaron. He didn't look up, but continued speaking. “Except during a breakout. Infection is very unlikely given the use of adequate protection.” The culprit of the rumor – assuming it had been the cause for the party guests' departure – seemed all too clear to me. I didn't say anything, reasoning that the situation was bad enough without throwing a lovers' quarrel into the mix.

“Porcina,” Lauren said again, pointedly ignoring Aaron, “that's not what happened. They just left!” She tried to finished brightly, but I could tell that she didn't believe her own words.

“He called me a *fat whore*!” spat Porcina. For a moment, I thought she meant me. Thankfully, she didn't. “That... that... *faggot* called me a *stupid, fat whore*, and then he *laughed* and he *left* and he *told everyone else*!” She wiped her face with the back of her hand and leveled a glare at me. “Then *he* brought *this*,” she smacked the tray of vegetables, prompting an aerial dance of carrots and celery, “to *rub it in*! They all *left* because I'm *fat*!” Her energy seemed to suddenly dwindle, and her tantrum became more like the sorrows of a mourner. “Because I'm *fat*,” she sobbed again. “*Faaaaaaaaat*!”

“It's not –” Lauren tried to say, but she was interrupted by the most ill-timed arrival of guests imaginable. Three young men had opened the door, where they stood staring like wildlife caught in headlights.

Worse still, however, was Porcina's reaction. “*COME OVER HERE AND FUCK ME*!” she demanded.

The men looked at each other. Then, in one motion, they all turned and left.

“*SEE*?!” Porcina. “It's because I'm *fat*!”

“It's not –” Lauren tried again.

“*FAT*!” interrupted Porcina.

“It's not –”

“*FAT*!”

“Porci-”

“*FAT*!”

“*It's because you're a selfish bitch*!” Lauren screamed, her voice on the verge of cracking. It stunned Porcina into silence. I could tell that Lauren was fighting back tears as she ripped into her roommate. “You treat *everyone* like *shit*,  even when they're nice to you! You *used* to be so friendly, but now you're just, just... *evil*!” Her tears were flowing freely then, and I moved to comfort her. My heart broke as she pushed me away. “You *lie*, you *break things*, you whine *all the fucking time*, and you try to sleep with *everyone* who even *smiles* at you!”

“Blowjobs,” offered Aaron, apropos of nothing.

“*SHUT UP*!” Lauren yelled. She took a tortured breath. “You were my friend, Porcina. My *best* friend. I broke up with Danny...” Porcina's brother, I assumed. “... when you told me it made you uncomfortable. I made you a cake on your birthday when your parents forgot! We got *matching tattoos* when we turned eighteen!”

That was an unexpected piece of news.

“But now... now...” Lauren sniffed and covered her mouth with her hand. “I don't know what's happening to you. It's *not* because you're fat, Porcina. It's *not* because you're fat.”

“How would you know?” Porcina muttered. “Skinny little slut.”

Lauren laughed without a hint of happiness in her voice. “Porcina, you already know. *I* used to be fat, too.”

I wanted to believe that there weren't hamplanets out there traveling the galaxy talking about the beetus and conditions that were making them large and flabulous masses of fast food and entitlement. I thought the stories here embellishments based on a kernel of truth. That kernel it turns out is an extra large extra butter extra salt coronary clogging extravaganza that I just never had the misfortune to witness. I want to apologize for ever doubting you fatties. 


Over the course of the last 2 months I have ran into more entitled blobs and earth shakers that I thought existed.Gonna try to green text for ease of reading.

&gt;Be me, 6'3 190, 21, years old, former pear shaped child, currently a summer intern at the local hospital shadowing physicians.

&gt;Be me, see some awesome shit in the emergency department, but after 2 weeks get swapped to ED pediatrics.

&gt;Not be the new pediatrician (will be Dr. NJ from here on out) with hardcore North Jersey accent and no-nonsense personality. Absolutely loves kids. 

&gt;Follow Dr. NJ on rounds through the pediatric emergency department.

&gt;[mfw](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m08xm6ohEf1rqfhi2o1_500.gif) 5 hours in to my first shift, hardly anything has happened and I'm here for another 3.

&gt;ED phone rings, EMS is bringing 14 year old kid (now known as Bam Margera) fell off his skateboard with no helmet and smashed into the pavement while getting towed by a dirt bike.

&gt;Dr. NJ mentions possibly getting the trauma docs involved and goes over the signs of internal bleeding.

&gt;Disgunbegood.gif

&gt;Wait 15 minutes, realize the whole ED can hear my stomach rumble.

&gt;Go get snack from shitty hospital cafeteria.

&gt;Arrive back in time to see nurses leave the room and pull the curtain shut.

&gt;Go find Dr. NJ in other room. Alarmist parents have brought in 3 year old with minor scrape on knee. Tell him Bam Magera is here.

&gt;Follow Dr. NJ into see this kid.

&gt;At least 400 pounds as she is dam close to breaking the pediatric bed

&gt;Look in the corner, see Bam slumped in a chair with multiple bleeding abrasions on his elbows, feet and knees and face (Later found he had 2 contusions on the back of his head). IV and oxygen tubes are stretched over the bed to his chair. Clearly he moved after the nurse put them in.

&gt;Be quite confused as to why Bam is in the corner and HM is in the bed.

&gt;Bam throws up into provided container and moans in pain.

&gt;Nurse sticks her head in and tells us EMS reported nausea and vomiting on the ride over.

&gt;youdontsay.jpg


&gt;Dr. NJ mentions something about needing a chest xray and a CT scan asap. 

&gt;Don't hear. Still staring in astonishment the 8th gelatinous wonder of the world who took her injured son's bed.



&gt;Dr NJ asks HM why she is in the bed while her son is bleeding and suffering in the corner

&gt; says she has the beetus, lower back pain and had a triple bypass 2 years ago and cannot sit in chairs for extended periods of time. She can't be older than 45.

&gt;[mfw](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lydjxp3u021qcsp5b.gif) It finally has happened. The legends are true. I have found the grail and its full of McDonalds and Dr. Pepper.

&gt;Look over at Dr. NJ's face. His face just invented a new shade of red. 

&gt;NJ is speechless. He has lost his ability for coherent thought.

&gt;Before NJ whites out and charges this woman in a fit of rage like a rhinoceros spearing a Jeep on safari, radiology tech shows up

&gt;Goes to wheel the bed down to radiology, standard procedure

&gt;[hfw](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4mm50AyH41rwcc6bo1_250.gif) HM refuses to move so her son can go get scanned.

&gt;Dr. NJ momentarily gains control, excuses himself and yells for another bed. 

&gt;another bed from the next room over is brought in

&gt;All the supporting stuff like the monitor and IV bag is moved to the new bed
 
&gt;Bam stands and vomits again. Limps over and lays down in the new bed, visibly relieved. 

&gt;Nurse asks if HM wants to walk down to radiology to keep her son company.

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/pD3EQ.gif) she says no, that's shes comfortable and if anyone will be bringing her and her son food.

&gt;If looks could kill, NJ is nuking this bitch.

1371939856.0	1gvme5	Working with obese people means you'll end up doing most of the work, I guess.	clockworkgirl21	485	64	33	"I recently took a temporary job at a trap shooting competition. About 1/3 of the people hired are obese. It isn't easy work. There's a lot of walking between sites in the hot sun, picking up shotgun shells, moving trap sets as well as packing them up and unfolding them again, plus a lot more. It isn't unusual to have 12 hour shifts. I started getting a little irritated when I saw most of the fat people start complaining about how their legs hurt and how they had to sit down for a minute. It always left the skinny people doing most of the work while the fat people sat around the benches and talked about how hot it was and how much they hurt. 

Today I nearly reached the end of my self control when the obese girl I was working with announced her legs hurt and she had to go home. They agreed she could go home. This left me with all her work as well as my own and I snapped at her, ""My legs hurt too, but I'm not going home."" 

She shrugged and said, ""You're skinny though. It isn't as hard for you to walk around in the hot sun and move around on sore legs.""

I retorted, ""Well, if it's really hard for you to work because of your size, maybe you shouldn't take a job where you have to get up off your ass once in awhile.""

She teared up and left. I feel a bit bad, but damn it, I'm not being paid extra to do the work of two people."	t5_2vzax	True
1373952996.0	1ie8nf	Hamplanet Christmas	employeeofdamonth	499	83	61	"Okay Reddit- I had to make a new account for this so I hope you enjoy it. Sorry for the length, I was an English major.

Flashback to summer 2012. I'm in my mid-twenties, working for the same company since I got out of college, and still living with my parents because I liked saving money and moving out would mean breaking my poor Asian mother's heart.

Then, sadness. Fucking assholes driving and texting on the freeway happened, and my dear papa was taken from us. Now, I had to help support my mother and my little sister. We lived in a fairly expensive area at the time and knew we wouldn't be able to afford to live there any longer, so we decided to move in with my mother's sister, three states away. Our only income was me, who was able to transfer to company's office in new city.

I was fat before my dad passed. A few months after, I was a hamplanet-in-training. Five feet, four inches and pushing 180. I became a very different person, inside and out. I was very quiet and polite, but not friendly. Now I realize I was depressed at the time, and all I did was work. The new office was bigger and the co-workers were nice, but I didn't make any friends. It was a lonely time.

One of the guys upstairs took a liking to me though and began assigning me more duties, letting me know I was on the way to management. I began to work closer with Lil Bug, who was assistant manager, and Big Bug, who was office manager and Lil Bug's big brother. Lil Bug was about 6', thin, and seemed more attractive than he was because he was funny and flirty. Big Bug was shorter, stockier, and funnier, but was on the road a lot.

For some reason, Lil Bug decided it was his life mission to befriend me. He would greet me everyday by yelling ""OMAGAWD, it's EMPLOYEEOFDAMONTH!"" giving me a giant bear hug, and cracking jokes until I couldn't stop smiling. He was pretty much the highlight of my day It was probably because of him that I became more outgoing, and friendlier to other people in the office.

Enter Hammela. Hammela is barely out of college, barely able to fit into anything she wore though she was more overweight than outright obese at the time, and barely competent. Hammela is very social and talkative, and makes friends fast. She was very nice to me, and not so nice to the skinner girls in the office. Probably the first clue I should've picked up on. Any time a fit girl wore a skirt to work, Hammela would be livid, even though whatever she wore . ""DAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE OFFICE ATTIRE!"" she would snarl, little bits of sugar flying out of her mouth, even though whatever she was wearing was usually always equally inappropriate. Hammela had a thing for low-cut tops and short skirts.

Hammela was constantly snacking, cookies and chips chocolate bars, you name it. If you brought any little snack with you to work, a granola bar or Doritos, you'd become Hammela's new best friend. And as Hammela's new best friend, you were obligated to give her half of whatever snack you had. I had to give Hammela one thing though, she tried to return the favor- always at the worst possible time. Namely, when you were on a diet or mentioned anything about going on a diet. Any time me or one of the ""more to love"" girls mused about getting healthy, there was Hammela with a box of donuts practically shoving it in your face. She tried, with all of her fatty might, to ruin any diet we tried to start. No, none of us realized this at the time.

Hammela zeroed in on Lil Bug as soon as she stepped into the office, and Lil Bug fell right into her rapidly getting puffier paws. Hammela had been there for a few months, getting heavier steadily but still pretty in the face. As the fattest girl in closest proximity to her cubicle, I heard everything about their developing relationship and everything else in Hammela's personal life.  Their relationship became something of an office joke. Hammela would always leave her cubicle to be near Lil Bug, flirted heavily with him whenever she saw him, if anyone else said his name her head would turn to whoever said it. 

One day, ""*chewing noise* Hey employeeofdamonth, guess what? *chewing noise*""
Me, beta as fuck: ""What's up, Hammela?""
Hammela: *chewing noise* ""Big Bug just told me I'm being promoted!"" *chewing noise*
Me, pissed as fuck through gritted teeth: ""That's great, Hammela. Now excuse me...""
Hammela: ""Are you going to finish those cookies?""

Big Bug, of course, denies it. Confirms I'm still on track for management. A few days later...

Hammela: *chewing noise* ""Hey employeeofdamonth. I've come to say goodbye."" *chewing noise*
Me, not daring to believe it: ""What do you mean?""
Hammela: *chewing noise* ""Lil Bug and I are together, and Big Bug says relationships between management and staff aren't allowed. So I'm quitting."" *chewing noise*
Me, trying to hide my delight: ""Oh, I'll miss you so much...""

A few days after she quit, I discovered Reddit and r/keto. Over the course of six months, I lost sixty pounds. Mom got remarried, and her new husband took on the financial burden. I moved out and decided to apply to grad school. I made friends in my classes. Life was going well.

Then, the night of the Christmas party. Not going to lie, I looked fantastic, and that made me more gregarious than usual. I was singing karaoke and dancing, everyone was having fun.

Me: *singing horribly* “My heart will go on and on...”
The feeling of the ground moving beneath me made me pause. Earthquake! All around me, my co-workers trembled in fear and made a mad dash to get under cover. But then, earthquakes didn't bring on the smell of fried chicken grease.
Hammela: *chewing noise* “Hey guise!” *chewing noise*
Holy shit. Whatever weight I lost in the last six months, Hammela had gained and more. She was no longer pretty and fat, now it would be an understatement to call her fat. She'd turned into a 5'9, 300 pound tub of lard. She reeked and sweated grease. She was holding on to Lil Bug's hand, and he looked miserable. Worse, Hammela still dressed as “sexily” as she did before- I've never seen legs that fat on a skirt that tight before. I think I went blind for a minute.

While Hammela greeted everyone, Big Bug told me what happened. Hammela could only find a job working fast food after she quit the office, and she was fired after a few months when they caught her eating the product. She had moved in with Lil Bug, was eating him out of his home, and trying to pressure him into proposing. Big Bug and I were laughing about it, and that probably caught Hammela's attention. She descended on us, the force field that currently held Lil Bug afloat threatening to also pull Big Bug and I into her personal orbit.

Hammela: *chewing noise* “What's so funny? Who's this?” *chewing noise*
Me, thinking it's a joke: Very funny, Hammela.
She realized who I was, and again, I've never seen a woman that fat get so angry. Her eyes got so squinty  She stalked away to the potluck table, dragging Lil Bug with her. I was unconcerned. 

The rest of the night, everyone was either making fun of Hammela when she wasn't near them or talking sympathetically about Lil Bug, who was universally liked. There was a big empty space around the potluck table, where Hammela was sitting with Lil Bug and eating plate after plate of brownies, pasta, and whatever else my co-workers and I brought. It was annoying everyone, as she and Lil Bug hadn't brought anything and she would glare at anyone who approached the table. (Big Bug said Lil Bug was going to bake cupcakes, but someone had gotten to them that morning.)

Lil Bug was asking Hammela to dance, but she said she was too tired to and that it was his duty as her boyfriend to stand by her. I was standing close enough to hear this, and concocted a plan with Big Bug to distract Hammela away so Lil Bug could have a little fun. I had Big Bug talk to Hammela, flatter her a bit, and ask her to take a walk with him in the hallway so she could give him some advice (Big Bug was separating from his wife, but had a sense of humor about it). It worked, Hammela was happy to give life lessons to someone, Lil Bug was free!

If only. Lil Bug and I were just about to start a duet, when five minutes later a fatass figure appeared in the doorway, casting a shadow over the entire office.

Hammela: *chewing noise* “YOU GODDAM HO! STEP AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND!” *chewing noise*

She walked up to me, and actually shoved me. Maybe at my old weight it would have been nothing, but new trimmer me would have fallen to the floor if Lil Bug hadn't caught me. That only seemed to piss off Hammela more.

Hammela: *chewing noise* “FUCKING WHORE I SAID GET OFF!” *chewing noise*

Still kinda beta and too shocked to say anything, I just let myself be comforted by some co-workers as Hammela and Lil Bug began a screaming fight in front of us. He called her out on not contributing anything to rent or utility or especially the grocery bill, and Hammela accused him of sleeping with me because, and quote, “SHE TURNED INTO ANOTHER ANOREXIC WHORE”

Lil Bug dumped her then. It was the greatest office Christmas party ever. Story not over.

&gt;in the fridge we have normal groceries, including a bowl of fresh baby carrots that will be an afternoon snack for later.

&gt;my sister Courtney is also with us (10yo). She finishes her donut, then goes to eat some carrots.

&gt;I don't stop her. There's lots of carrots.

&gt;little niece Carrie has eaten three bites of her eclaire (which is a pretty big snack for a 5yo in retrospect). She sees Courtney's carrots and wants some.

&gt;""Aunt Kablarkin, can I have some carrots, too?""

&gt;me: ""Finish your eclaire first, hon'""

&gt;As soon as the words leave my mouth, I realize how dumb they sound.

&gt;""No, wait, nevermind. You can have carrots. You don't have to eat that donut if you don't want to. And you, too, Harold. You don't have to eat it. I won't be upset.""

&gt;Carrie goes and eats carrots with Courtney. Harold takes a few more bites of donut, then goes to eat carrots, too.

&gt;Don’t be ObliviousGamer, my ex, and one of my oldest friends. At about 6’1, 170ish pounds, he was skinny by the luck of having the metabolism of a humming bird. Not really fit, but thin. Slowbro and Jigglebitch were living with him until a few weeks before this story. Also, my current (in this story) BF. 

&gt;Don’t be my brother, SlowBro, who’s about 6’ and 180 lbs of straight loose skin and flab. (The kind you get when you lose an extreme amount of weight from doing drugs, and sitting on your ass.)

&gt;Don’t be Jigglebitch, my brother’s huge (5’5 at least 260lbs) constantly underdressed girlfriend. Seriously guise, don’t. Her ankles had cellulite. Like [this]( http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-18681-body-shape.htm?StartAt=13#.UdMy9ZzHnKs) and add cottage cheese ankles to that visual. 


Now, I hadn’t seen my brother in over a year, he’s a lowlife and I choose not to deal with him. But, I had just moved back to Tennessee, and he requested to see me. All other people in this story being unemployed, they had to wait for me to get time off. Also, I was avoiding them like the plague. Finally, Slowbro just randomly showed up at my house, when I happened to have time off and no excuse to avoid him. 

&gt;(Hear’s knock on door)

&gt;Well, shit. 

&gt;Opens front door, hoping for anyone ANYONE else to be there. 

&gt;Of course not, it’s slowbro. 

&gt; “Oh good, you’re off. My girlfriend and I were headed to the lake for a while. Wanna come?”

&gt; Hellno.gif

&gt; Looks down at outfit.

&gt; Day off so not dressed, can’t say I have plans. 

&gt; fuck. 

&gt; Then I remembered my brother’s “type” of gf.. and I just had to meet this shebeast. Morbid curiosity. 

&gt; Car is parked behind bushes. Damnit.

&gt; “Yeah, sure I guess SlowBro. Lemme get some shit together. Why don’t you ask if ObliviousGamer wants to go?”

&gt; “Uh, I’d rather it just be us, so we can catch up, and you can meet JiggleBitch”

&gt; suspicious.

&gt; I grab a towel, realize my bathing suit is still packed, borrow bikini from roommate, and throw tank top/shorts over it and head out the door. 

&gt; Get into back seat, notice Jigglebitch looks fairly normal.. 

&gt;Old car, has bench seat in front, can only see head/shoulders. 

&gt;Face like a bulldog, but whatever. Let’s go swimming. 

&gt;Entire 15 minute ride, she does nothing but complain to and/or about slowbro in a whiney nasally voice that would make Fran Drescher stop and cringe. 

&gt; Awesome. 

&gt; We get to lake, I take of my shorts and head towards the water. 

&gt; Now, keep in mind that I’m built about like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-33978-body-shape.htm?StartAt=11#.UdM4KZzHnKs). Hammy, but not huge. Working 70ish hours a week has knocked off any cellulite that even considered appearing. 

&gt; Slowbro and Jigglebitch paused for a smoke. 

&gt; I finally get a good view of jiggle bitch. 

&gt; holyfuckingshit. 

&gt; In Soffee shorts atleast 3 sizes too small, and one of what I could only assume used to be one of my brothers wifebeaters, stands the majestic shebeast. 

&gt; Cellulite.. cellulite everywhere. 

&gt; Oh well, it can’t get worse right? RIGHT?!

&gt; Wrong. 

&gt;Jigglebitch begins removing what little clothing she has. 

&gt; Shirt is peeled off, revealing two sad pieces of fabric covering the hamslabs she considers boobs. 

&gt; The string holding those two triangles was nowhere to be found, presumably lost forever in the side rolls of this megabeast. 

&gt;Shesgottabedonenowright?!

&gt;Wrong again. Oh so very very wrong. 

&gt; She reaches under her stomach slab to access the severely overworked elastic band of the shorts. 

&gt;Takes her a minute, waist band is presumably embedded into skin, considering how small the shorts were compared to her ginormous ass. 

&gt;Shorts slowly begin making their descent towards the ground. 

&gt;MYEYES.

&gt;Under her hoochie shorts was even more cellulite, (cottage cheese is jealous of her lumps), and hopefully bikini bottoms, though there was no sign of them. 

&gt; “What do you think Slowbro, like my new suit? Teehee”

&gt;Slowbro agrees that he does.

&gt; Jigglebitch “teehee’s” again, and makes her way towards him. It’s a wonder those thighs didn’t start a fire with sheer friction. 

&gt; Jigglebitch finally acknowledges my existence, “See real men like Slowbro here like REAL women. He can’t get enough of my currrrrves” (begins making out with my brother)

&gt; I make a run for the shore, and grab my phone. Frantically calling ObliviousGamer in a panic. 

&gt; *I don’t CARE where you are or what you’re playing get over here right now, you can’t leave me alone with them*. 

&gt; He laughs. He knew what I was in for and didn’t warn me. 

&gt; I look over at jigglebitch dry humping my brother on the hood of the car. (Is it dry humping when you’re sweaty and covered in a thick layer of grease?)

&gt; Promise sexytimes to ObliviousGamer if he rescued me. 

&gt; “Be there in 5 minutes”

&gt; Relieved, I sit in the car and wait for him. Slowbro and Jigglebitch head towards the water in a process I can only describe as unbeaching the whale. 

&gt;  Slowbro hollers back at me, as Jigglebitch launches herself into the unsuspecting lake, “Hey wtfitsaries, are you coming or what?”

&gt;I lie. “Yeah, just a sec, I’m waiting on a call from work.”

&gt;Slowbro and Jigglebitch go back to talking about how sexy jigglebitch is. 

&gt;I mostly ignore them, until I hear my name, mutilated by a lazy mouth and a southern accent, “lolololol wtfitsaries can’t pull of a bikini like me. She doesn’t have my currrrves. She’s too skinny.”

&gt;Now, at 5’5, 170lbs, with actual boobs and a decent hip/waist ratio, nothing about me was even “skinny” let alone “too skinny”.

&gt; ObliviousGamer pulls in. 

&gt; Acts like it’s a coincidence he was here, like a boss. 

&gt; I get up and give him a hug.

&gt; Jigglebitch rushes out as fast as those flabby treetrunks could carry her. 

&gt; “OG! OG!! What are you doing here?!”

&gt; Slams into him in what can only be described as a squishy “Glomp”

&gt; I do nothing, in revenge for him not warning me. 

&gt; Until she grabs his butt. 

&gt; She grabs his butt. In front of me. In front of her bf, who happens to be my little brother. 

&gt; Decide not to react, I haven’t made it clear we were dating. Plus, I don’t like my brother. 

&gt; “ARE YOU COMING IN THE WATER OG? IT’S SOOOO NIIICE. WE’VE BEEN HAVING SOOOO MUCH FUN JUMPING AROUND! I GOTTA BE CAREFUL THOUGH, MY TOP KEEPS SLIPPING.. teehee.”

&gt; Wat.

&gt; Is it flirting with him? O.o

&gt; She’s only been in the water 5 minutes.. there was no jumping.. or swimming.. just awkward bobbing of fat with the waves. 

&gt; And that top isn’t going anywhere unless someone puts the poor strap out of its misery with a pair of scissors, and it launches itself into space. 

&gt;Bitch mode: Engaged. 

&gt; OG, “Yeah I’ll be in in a minute, I grabbed some food on the way so I’m gonna eat real fast.”

&gt;Pulls out McBeetus bag, and offers me some. 

&gt; I look over at JB. nope. Not hungry. 

&gt; “OH MY GLOB, I HAVEN’T EATEN ALLLLLL DAY THAT LOOKS SO GOOD. CAN I HAVE SOME?”

&gt;Lol, “all day”, slowbro and her were just talking about how they ate one of the little Caesar’s pizza’s on the way to get me. Which would have been less than an hour ago.

&gt; “Uh, I really only bought it for me”

&gt; “BUT YOU JUST OFFERED SOME TO HER! ARE YOU SAYING I DON’T NEED IT ‘CUZ I’M FAT? I’M STARVING!”

&gt; “Uh, I only offered it to her because she’s my girlfriend, and she forgets to eat.”

&gt; True. Between two jobs I generally put sleep before eating, hence the dropped weight. 

&gt; “SHE’S your GIRLFRIEND?! NO WONDER YOU’RE TRYING TO FEED HER, SHE’S TOO SKINNY, WE BOTH KNOW YOU LIKE A REEEEAL WOMAN, WITH CURRRRRVES.  teehee.”

&gt; Wat. 

&gt; Then she goes on and on about how she forgets to eat all the time too. She has no idea how she’s not “anorexic” because she “hardly EVER eats” .

&gt; OG- “Don’t you drink Mountain Beetus ALL day long?”

&gt; “WELL YEAH, BUT ONLY LIKE 12 CANS A DAY. GOTTA KEEP MY SUGAR UP!”

&gt; “Do you know how many calories that is by itself??”

&gt;”DON’T BE STUPID OG, EVERYONE KNOWS DRINK CALORIES DON’T COUNT, YOU JUST PEE THEM OUT teehee”

&gt; OG grabs burger, and sets the bag with the rest of the food on the hood of the car, and turns to me. We discuss his latest game and try to pretend jigglebitch doesn’t exist. 

&gt; Burger gone, he reaches back for the bag. 

&gt; “ARE YOU TRYING TO HOLD MY HAND OG? teehee NOT INFRONT OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND!”

&gt; “uh, no, I was looking for the bag my fries in it.”

&gt; “OH, teehee, I DIDN’T THINK YOU WANTED THEM SO I ATE THEM FOR YOU.”

At this point, I am trying hard not to lose my shit. This is fucking hilarious. OG is not the kind of person who shares food. He’s about to flipshit on this landwhale. 

&gt; Slowbro finally realizes JB isn’t in the water, and calls her over. 

&gt;JB reluctantly heads back to her own bf. Swaying her hips to look “sexy” as she lumbers down the beach. 

&gt;It’s hot, we decide to get in the water too. 

&gt; OG takes off his shirt and jumps off the nearby dock, as I wade in next to it. 

&gt; OG and Slowbro begin discussing video games. 

&gt; “LIKE MY NEW BIKINI OG? teehee. I GOTTA SHOW OFF THESE CURRRRRVES”

&gt; “uh.”

&gt; “YOUR GF IS TOO SHY. SHE COULD PROBABLY WEAR A BIKINI TOO, WE’RE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE. I JUST LOOK BETTER IN THEM BECAUSE OF MY CURRRRVES”

&gt;about the same size. 

&gt;She has at least 100lbs on me. 

&gt;20 minutes ago, I was “too skinny”

&gt; “I’m not shy, and I am wearing a bikini. It’s just not mine, the top is kinda small. I don’t want to risk falling out.”

&gt;  “TEEHEE! I HAVE THAT PROBLEM ALLLLLL THE TIME. MY BOOBS ARE SO BIG.”

&gt; “urm, okay” 

&gt; JB gets out and decides to jump off the dock. She waits until she’s directly in front of OG, and suddenly the halter of her bikini “comes undone” and falls down. 

&gt; “teehee, I JUST CAN’T KEEP THESE IN! teehee.”

&gt; “could you please quit flashing my boyfriend? We get it, you have boobs. Retie your damn suit”

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW! YOU’RE AFRAID I’LL STEAL HIM AWAY FROM YOU.”

&gt; I’m done.

&gt; “no, I’m just trying to erase those blubbery slabs of fat, with bologna stuck to them from my memory.”

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST MAD BECAUSE OG LIKES BOOBS AND YOU DON’T HAVE ANY”

&gt; fuck it, tank top is coming off. [releases 36DD’s from their cottony prison] “I fucking have plenty of boobs. Besides, OG is an ass man.”

&gt; “EW **LOOK** AT THAT **GUT**, YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT YOUR TANK TOP ON. NO WONDER YOUR BOYFRIEND WOULD RATHER SEE ME IN A BIKINI! RIGHT OG??”

&gt; OG, “uh, no. nobody wants to see that.”

&gt; Jigglebitch stomps away, screaming “YOU BRAINWASHED HIM YOU STUPID SLUT!”, and sits in the car to pout. 

&gt; Everyone turns to slowbro.

&gt; “She’s not usually like this.. I swear..” he mumbles and goes to comfort her. 

&gt; lol she’s already comforting herself with her stash of kingsized melted candy bars she pulled from somewhere in the car. 

Part two may or may not be posted later.. lol. 


tl;dr: 1 hour is all day, drinks don't have calories, and a shewhale got her feelings hurt when trying to steal my bf. "	t5_2vzax	True
1366586643.0	1ctuce	A Fatty Insults my Mother's Hospitality and I suck at Petty Revenge	lsjess616	486	71	119	"Alright, gluttons, I've got one for ya.  Expect mild jimmy rustling and light disgust.

My mom hangs with a group of ladies from our church.  They're all pretty awesome, and sometimes, they all get together at someone's house.  They used to call it Bible study, but gave that up when it became clear that no one wanted to study the Bible, they all just wanted to drink and shoot the shit.

&gt;So it came to be that such a gathering was to take place at our house.  

&gt;Mom was stressing out about preparing food, which seemed strange to me.  She had never worried about it before... 

&gt;""There's a new lady in the group.""

&gt;Oh, ok.  She wants to make a good impression.

&gt;My job is making artichoke dip.

&gt;Fattiest, greasiest dip you could imagine.  Soooo much mayo.  And it's kinda disgusting if you really think about it, but it tasted delicious.   

&gt;Nevertheless, it was special occasion food.  Only made for parties and holidays.  Too unhealthy for daily life.

&gt;Pull dip out of oven, cover and set aside for later.

&gt;Arrivals.HelloooooooLsjessYouLookWonderfulSugar

&gt;The porch light dims

&gt;Not dimmed, just blocked by an object.

&gt;Lawdamercy, call the zoo.  The hippo's escaped.

&gt;Nnno.. wait... never seen a hippo with blond hair.  Hmm.

&gt;""Hiiiii there, I'm Diplodocus!""  Female, 5'5, 320?  330 maybe?

&gt;Well hello, come on in, have a seat, there are nibbles on the coffee table.

&gt;Everyone settles in the living room, eats chips and nuts off the table, chatting, drinking, bitchin.

&gt;D disappears to the kitchen.  Wine refills?  Going with wine refills.

A word about hospitality.  We are from the Southern US, and it's very important to us that people feel comfortable in our home.  We wouldn't want someone to want for anything.  With that said, part of hospitality is being a good guest.  If your hostess sets out food, you would never go digging in the kitchen for something else.  If you have dietary needs or something, you mention it and the hostess would go out of her way to find you something, but you would never just root around in the pantry or fridge.  Back to story.

&gt;Notice D is missing.  

&gt;Check kitchen to find D standing over the empty artichoke dip dish.

&gt;She had dug it out from an out of the way alcove and gone into our cupboards to get tortilla chips for it.

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sad_face.gif) I won't get any more of this dip for months

&gt;Others had followed me into the kitchen (why, yes, I'll just have another little tumbler of wine, why thank you)

&gt;D:  ""Oh, ladies, I was just sampling the dip!  It was soooo good!!""

&gt;Sampling? Scarfing.

&gt;""Oh, [Lsjess's mom] I hope there's another pan!""

&gt;Nnno, that would have been enough for everyone, if you weren't included in the everyone.

&gt;I'm remaining calm.  I am a lady.  I am Ms. Manners.  I am not going to embarrass this person.

&gt;Mom: ""No, I'm sorry, I guess that's all.""

&gt;D: ""Oh, what a shame, it was so good.""

&gt;Ms. Manners.  I am Ms. Manners.

&gt;""But I guess if you didn't make enough for everyone...""

&gt;Oh.  No.  Bitch done fucked up now.  She has insulted my mother's hospitality.  This cannot be borne.

&gt;Ms. Manners is gone.  I'm about to go full redneck over here.  

&gt;We're talking Antoine Dodson, Harvey Updyke level trashy.  I am about to shame this bitch so hard...

&gt;Gonna climb in her windows and poison her trees.  She better hide her chips, hide her ham and hide her ice cream cuz I'm poisoning errbody out here... And you can tell that, Ham boy.

&gt;Seeing the smoke come out of my ears, my mother steps on my foot.  Please don't make a scene.

&gt;Right.  Right.  You know better Lsjess.  Never go full redneck.  It's cool.  Be calm.  You know her mama obviously didn't raise her right.

&gt;BlessHerLittleHeart.attack

&gt;Heh.  Little.  hmm.

&gt;I am calm.  I am calm.  I am calm.  I am....

&gt;""You should give me the recipe, I bet mine would feed everybody!""

&gt;.... I am not above a little petty revenge.

&gt;Me:  ""Of course, D, I'll go write down that recipe right now!""

&gt;Give her recipe, party winds to a close, everyone leaves.

Now, the original recipe is pretty greasy. When the mayonnaise bakes, it renders into this oily substance which separates from the dip if it sits too long.  So I added some weird stuff (tablespoon of nutmeg, dash of pickle juice) and doubled the mayonnaise.  That's a whole jar of mayonnaise here, people.  It should look alright right out of the oven, but upon breaking into it, it should separate into this sea of mayonnaise oil with clumps of parmesan cheese and artichoke heart floating in it.  

Haha, bitch won't even be able to eat it!  Or that's what I thought.  Friends, I was young.  Innocent!  I knew not the ways of the ham.  I didn't know.  I DIDN'T KNOW!!!

&gt;2 weeks later.

&gt;Somebody's wine and cheese party.

&gt;Room darkens.

&gt;Oh, it's D, coming up behind me.  That won't give me nightmares.

&gt;""Oh, Lsjess!  Hi there, darlin!  I'm so glad you gave me that recipe!  It's just turned out great!""

&gt;Wut.

&gt;""Between you and me, I think mine's better!  I don't put as many artichokes in.""

&gt;O.O

&gt;""Why don't you eat something, you're much too skinny darlin!"" (Was skinny, was 17, 5'7, and about 100 lbs)

&gt;Me: ""Oh, no, couldn't possibly, just had a full plate.""

&gt;D, shaking head:  ""I'm gonna feed you up.""

&gt;Fixes me plate with roast beef, mac salad, other stuff I'm not going to eat and.... Oh Lawd.  What is that.  It's not.  It can't be...

&gt;She has brought the dip.  With double the mayonnaise.  She lifts a small spoonful, dripping and I mean literally dripping off the spoon, with mayonnaise oil.

&gt;Gives it to me, flits off to talk to someone else.  Toss plate in trash.

&gt;Not gonna eat that.  The devil is a lie.

&gt;Me and dad set up a stakeout.  Watched throughout the night to see who else ate the dip.

&gt;4 people poked at it dubiously with chips.  Chips came away soaked in oil.

&gt;Saw D scoop up a chip full.  Watched oil drip down her fingers.  

&gt;Couldn't watch this ignoble death of sweet artichoke.  Parmesan has never been so abused.

&gt;Leave for 10 minutes.  Come back to find dip bowl empty.

And that, people, is the story of Diplodocus, the rude lady who insulted my mama's hospitality and then ate a jar of hot mayonnaise with a sprinkling of parmesan. 

For those who aren't up to scratch on the finer points of southern culture, here's what you need to know about [Antoine Dodson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEAKsaQOCpQ) (relevant part starts around 1:00.)  

Harvey Updyke is a fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.  Our hated rivals, Auburn, have some really old live oaks on their campus that are a traditional gathering place.  Updyke snuck onto campus and poisoned the trees.  Now, I hate Auburn myself, but it was a really trashy, shitty, unsportsmanlike thing to do.  So now we've turned it into a joke and ""pulling an Updyke"" means poisoning someone.

So there's the cultural references.

1376604527.0	1kg56r	You win, FPS. They really do exist. Introducing the Fast Food Fairy.	rockandrowland	493	78	123	"Current hamplanet, here (working on it). I come to FPS just assuming that 99% of the posts are grossly exaggerated. ""No way people can be that unaware of themselves,"" I thought. Even at my hammiest of states... I could have never eaten the meals most of you describe. All these people are just making all of this shit up. I read it anyways because well... it's funny. BUT THEN!

Today I was walking into the break room to heat up my lunch. I smelled a strange combination of smells. Mexican food, french fries, and BO. In the corner I see a large girl (a little larger than me, about the same size I was a few months ago) with a bag of McDonalds in front of her. I have never seen her before, so I say hi and stick my meal in the microwave. As it heats, I sit down to make polite conversation. I find out that she is new to the company. It's her first week. She asks me about my work and I explain what I do. As I am talking, she starts to unpack her meal. Two large french fries, a huge cheeseburger, 20 piece chicken nuggets, sweet and sour sauce, two apple pies. She sets to work. I am trying not to judge.

When my food beeps, I go grab it and come back to sit down at the table. She is taking the pickles off her cheeseburger. I laugh. ""I don't really like pickles either,"" I said, trying to make polite conversation. ""I love pickles,"" she replies. ""I am just trying to watch my sodium intake."" ...wat? 

I start eating my lunch (homemade stirfry, no rice) and this girl INHALES her lunch. I have never seen anyone eat that fast in my entire life. About halfway through, she finishes her large coke and then gets up and walks to the vending machine. That's when I identified the source of BO. As she passed by, I got a whiff of the strongest, mustiest, fishiest smell I have ever experienced. It was like old sharty boxers, soaked in tuna juice, packed in a ziplock bag, and left in a hot car. I cleared my throat.

She sits back down with a can of coke and pours it into her cup. ""They never give you enough coke in these things. It's all ice,"" she complained. As I am finishing my stirfry, she is about done with her McDonald's feast. I wash my container and grab my apple from the fridge. When I sit back down, some how she has a platter of mexican food in front of her. She doesn't have any other bags. The only thing I saw when I sat down was the McDonald's bag. I didn't hear her get up, and she didn't walk over to the fridge area. I have no idea where this taco platter came from. It's as if she summoned it out of ~~fat~~ thin air.

""What kind of apple is that,"" she asked me. ""I am not sure,"" I replied. ""There are so many different types of apples. I usually just get whatever looks good."" She looks me up and down and says, ""I never eat apples because they are Genetically Modified and that isn't good for you."" She then begins shoveling tacos and beans into her face. ""I am on a diet right now, so I am trying to eat better. I am actually doing low carb, but I will have an apple every once in a while,"" I tried to explain. Granted... I don't really need to explain myself to her, but I am trying to be polite. ""Low carb diets are terrible for you. You will never lose any weight doing that. (Side note: I am down 30 pounds.) Plus, apples are basically sugar anyways, so you might as well be eating a piece of cake.""

Good God. I didn't know I had jimmies, but I guess I do, because she certainly rustled them. Anyways. I just wanted to share with FPS that now I know that you all aren't liars.

TL;DR: I am trying to be less of a fatty, eating healthful, homemade food for lunch. Get accosted with nutritional advice from a smelly, oily, heffalump that seems to be able to summon food from nowhere.

Part 2:

""I'm Sorry Sir, you can't park your son on the diving board""

So my boss was in a meeting this morning and things were slow, so I thought I'd involve all you awesome FPS lovers in some more of my vacation catharsis:

If anyone didn't read the first part and want to catch themselves up with a TL;DR version…Part 1 , TL;DR: I go on weeklong vacation to Mayan Riviera. Reprehensible family of Fatyardigans (FFF, Fat Fuckin Family or Triple F) inconvenience handicap woman and her husband by refusing to give up handicap seating on hotel bus because they are too enormous for the bus' standard seating. After 15 minutes plumbing the depths of his oversized, pancetta wrapped, panko crumb encrusted heart, our fat husband manages to dislodge, along with half a candy apple, his last remaining modicum of human decency and allows the bewildered and extremely understanding (for some reason???) handicap woman to sit beside him, forcing his own wife and the wheelchairbound woman's husband to find seating elsewhere. The scene in ""The Road"" where they stumble upon the cellar full of half-butchered human livestock lying in their own filth demonstrated more humanity.  As /u/brjohnson789 succinctly put it: Dios mio, mis jaimes. 

After this short and unpleasant opening scene, I had a feeling these ass holes would be up to no good during the rest of the week….I was right:

So the bus ended up getting us to the hotel at around 9PM. I had planned on slamming a 40 and passing out on the bus ride there, but after the heartlessness I had just witnessed, my Johnnies were in a state of severe rumplefication and I couldn't sleep. I pretty much just resigned myself to the fact that life was meaningless, everyone was a morally bankrupt shell of a human being, and that I had ruined season 4 of Arrested Development for myself because I had put it on too much of a pedestal before it had even come out. I got off the bus and some guy in a golf cart drove off with my bag; then I found the lobby bar, had 3 double gin and tonics, smoked 4 Marlboro Reds and called it a night. 

The next day when I woke up at around 10AM fully clothed on my still made bed, I felt like a disgusting piece of shit so I went and showered, had a quick breakfast of a muffin and 3 dos equis, and made my way to the pool for a day of heavy drinking, maybe a couple failed alcohol-encouraged attempts at socializaion, some sleeping and some sunburning. I ordered a bucket of 6 mexican beers, found a lounge chair close to the bar, and cleared my mind of unhappy thoughts and holy sweet fuck, I hand't even taken a sip of my first beer when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye: Fat Fuckin Family! They were being chauffered along the footpath adjacent the pool in one of the hotel's golf carts (A Machine for Pigs if you will). I cringed listening to the scraping of the chassis along the pavement as the poor vehicle's suspension bottomed-out under the what-had-to-have-been combined weight of 1400 lbs sitting in the back. The mighty little cart rolled to a labored stop and the driver waited patiently for his cargo to offload themselves. 

Clad in matching bright red quadruple XL tshirts that all said ""Grabowski Dream Team 2013"", they were waddling single file along the side of the pool, searching for vacant lounge chairs, and get this: CARRYING FUCKING PLATES OF FOOD FROM THE BUFFET! Now when your last name is Grabowski, I pretty much expect you to be a fat, obnoxious asshole, and these big, fat polish narwhals were living up to this ridiculous prejudice of mine beautifully. Now directly to my left was the cabana, and directly to my right were 2 free chairs, and just my terrible luck, they were the closest 2 chairs to where the golf cart stopped. I could see FFF scanning the perimeter for the most convenient seating available. Their mouths were opening and closing, and I was too far away for anything to be audible, but I could tell they were echolocating, sending out meatballsubsonic waves in all directions, trying to piece together their surroundings, searching for the most annoying place to be fat for the day. The acoustic environment of the pool was not optimal, but podwork paid off and after only 10 seconds or so, I saw them zero in on my location and, plates of food in hand, set out in my direction. At the time I didn't realize it, but the following sequence of events would turn out to be never before documented land whale behaviour. Their feeding, parenting and alcohol consumption bevaiour would all be seen operating in conjunction for the first time ever. It felt exciting to be furthering scientific understanding. 

""Go get me a couple (a fucking couple!) buckets-a-beer"" Mr. FFF barked at his 16 year old son, glancing down at my bucket. The little turducken obliged and walked off to get his dad some beer. 

They all had enormous plates of food they had brought from the buffet area. Cookies, carrot cake, bacon, eggs, french fries. I stared at it for a bit, marveling at the literal pounds of food piled onto the plates, but It was 10AM and It was already hot as a witches taint outside so the mess into a stew of fries, icing, and bacon fat and I couldn't look at it anymore. 

The next 20 minutes minutes passed fairly unannoyingly and I drank 4 beers in peace. But this Phat Phuckin' Phamily…They just couldn't help themselves. The mother produces a backpack and proceeds to take out a cordless Ipod dock and ipod and starts blasting what I can only assume was a playlist called ""fat and annoying 2013"". I looked around as appauled pool-goers listened in horror as the relative tranquility of the pool scene beagn to be raped by the sounds of (shitty ""buffet"" double entendre ahead warning!) Jimmy Buffet's ""Margaritaville"", the asshole's national anthem. 

The music was extremely loud and after only 5 minutes, someone with far bigger balls than I yelled at them from across the pool to turn it off. Well Mr and Mrs family didn’t take to kindly, and mister, I'd say about 6 beers deep, loudly told the reasonable man on the other side of the pool, in front of that man's 2 young kids and all the kids within ear shot, to ""shut the fuck up and mind his own fucking business"". This was classic tragedy of the commons. One selfish, fat asshole using up the shared resource (enjoyable pool atmostphere) of everybody present. The man on the otherside, clearly dumfounded at this unusual lack of decency and emotional maturity, had nothing to say.

Triple F continuned to drink and be obnoxious as fuck over the course of the next couple hours. Their shitty music, the loud, unnecessary bad language, the plates of food littering the area around them that had started to attract flies... At one point, the 2 kids, the 16 year old in the pool, and the 13 year old beside his parents, started throwing food at each other. The FFF parents sat idly by, the husband passed out drunk, the wife reading her airport newstand pulp paperback horse shit. 


I seethed quietly to myself not ten feet from these elephant seals for another 2 hours when finally, some loud conga music, surprisingly much less annoying, started blaring and the hotel ""animadores"" came out with megaphones to rally everyone for some pool games. The commotion was enough to startle F^3 into action. Mr. FFF woke his ass up, summoned his 2 calves from the water and wifey in tow, they left in what, to them, must have been a hurry. In their haste, but probably on purpose, they left their plates, food and complimentary towels all over the place for some poor Mexican lady to clean up (It is their job after all!) 

I waited around another few minutes, eagerly trying to make eye contact with someone around me so we could bond over the chaos we had both just witnessed. No one was biting though, I think everyone was just delighting in the absense of FFF and the pool games that were about to start. Confident that no stranger would want to put their vagina on my neck for a game of chicken, I figured I'd make my way back to the buffet and grab something for lunch, maybe try and catch a couple of anoles on the way there. As I left I thought about all the natural resources that these people would no doubt be wasting over the rest of their annoying lives. All the fresh water and natural gas and school supplies that in another, more just life, might have been used by some destitute, Somalian AIDS orphan who could have gone on to become a doctor and cure Cancer or save some rainforests. 


TL;DR: fat assholes act like fat assholes at resort pool.

1372744742.0	1hhbyi	The last fatmobile.	wtfitsaries	513	99	83	"My first FPS post, so be gentle. lol I was in Walmart today to pick up groceries for the week, and grab a few odds and ends, as well as a prescription. Now, I'm 21 years old, 5'5, generally overweight, but currently 9 months pregnant. I've been walking back and forth to appointments all day and I'm having BH contractions. Womb dweller is also sitting on my sciatic nerve. 


I'm in pain. 


Now, normally I would never even consider using one of the scooters, I'm fairly active and perfectly capable of getting around. But today, as I waddled into the store I told myself I would use one if it was available. I walk through the doors, doing your stereotypical pregnant lady waddle, one hand on my lower back, the other feeling the contractions. Cool, still not ""real"" labor, proceed towards elderly greeter and the last fatmobile. Greeter see's me coming, smiles and unplugs cart getting it ready for me (I'm not moving very fast lol). 


All of the sudden I am knocked to the side by what I was sure was a wrecking ball. I stumble, people surrounding me look panicked, but I manage not to fall and look up to see what the holy hell just hit me. 


Enter: blubberbrat. She was about 16 I'd guess, 5'6ish, and atleast 280lbs. Like [THIS](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-9881-body-shape.htm?StartAt=3#.UdJlxJzHnKs) only so pasty white it almost hurt to look directly at her. 

&gt;Blubber brat charges towards last scooter

&gt;Greeter man looks terrified, he knows he has no chance against her.

&gt;BB wraps one ginormous oily hand around the handle of the cart. Turns and looks right past me to her mother (who was surprisingly skinny) “Look mama, there’s one left!”

&gt;Greeter looks at me, and says to the girl, very politely, that he was getting it ready for me. 

Enter: Mama- tall, I’d say at least 5’10, looked like one of those women who run 3 times a day, and do yoga. Very fit. 

&gt;I look at mama, then back at BB, trying to decide which one has a disability. 

&gt;BB still hasn’t let go of the fatmobile. 

&gt;I go full beta, and stand there awkwardly as I try to figure out what the hell is going on. 

&gt;BB then tells the greeter that she needs it more than I do. 

&gt;Greeter looks back and forth between us in disbelief. 

&gt;Mama then starts her rampage. “SIR I DEMAND YOU GIVE HER THAT SCOOTER. SHE NEEDS IT. SHE’S DELICATE BECAUSE OF HER CONDITION. SHE CAN’T MAKE IT THROUGH THE STORE WITHOUT IT.”

&gt;She then looks at me. 

&gt; “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU NEED A SCOOTER FOR, YOU’RE PERFECTLY ABLE.”


Now, her daughter ran up to that scooter faster than I’ve ever seen a hamplanet move. Half a page of text happened while I slowly made it from the door to the cart. Her 16 year old fatass needed a fatmobile for some unknown condition that apparently made it perfectly okay to knock over slow moving pregnant women. 


&gt;totiredtoargue.fuckit

&gt;I decide its not worth it, I will get my own damn groceries. 

&gt;Greeter stands up straight and looks mama in the eye, “Ma’am, this woman is obviously very pregnant, and in pain. Your daughter doesn’t seem to have any disability whatsoever, besides being obnoxiously rude. She about knocked over that woman trying to get this scooter.”

&gt;Mama’s like a honey badger.
 
&gt;Mama don’t give a shit. 

&gt;(Starts ridiculous dialogue about her poor daughters condition, we’re discriminating, blahblahblah making a huge scene)

&gt;I decide to nope the fuck out of there. 

&gt;Greeter visibly rolls his eyes at the woman as she goes on and on, which only pisses her off more. 

&gt;I decide this guy is the coolest old guy ever. 

&gt;As he distracts her, I slowly turn and walk away. I give him a slight wave to thank him for being awesome and head towards the produce section. 

&gt;Greeter just grins and winks at me. Continues to piss mama off. 


I slowly make my way around the produce, leaning on a cart I found abandoned, when I happen to look over towards the McDonalds at the front of the store. Parked at the little handicap table, in her fatmobile, not even 10 feet from the door, was blubberbrat. She needed that damn scooter SO badly, to go the unconquerable 10 fucking feet from the door to McBeetus. I’m sure her “condition” was acting up, and her sugar was so low, that she just couldn’t make it ALL the way there so she could have her Big Mac meal complete with large coke AND fries, AND an order of 10 chicken nuggets “as a side”. 


I check out, and leave. My jimmies so rattled that I don’t even realize I forgot my damn prescription, which means another trip to walmart.

&gt;Be at work

&gt;Work had a promotion around the release of a new AAA title (rhymes with ""Fatman"", coincidentally.)

&gt;Best store in every district won a pizza party

&gt;We were the best store in the district

&gt;We won a pizza party

&gt;Fuck yeah, free pizza

&gt;Close down store for the day (Pizza party was after closing)

&gt;Chatting with Bree and Annie, waiting for David and Turboham to show up

Now, Bree was a small girl, very cute, but knew her shit. She was one of my favourite coworkers. Annie was the boss, still really awesome despite that position, and, as I said in the last story, is still my friend to this day. She was more of a thick chick. Not chubby, but she definitely wasn't skinny either. And there was David. We was pretty quiet, liked to observe more than he got involved. Really nice guy. Also very skinny.

&gt; 15 minutes after close, David shows up

&gt;We're all chatting

&gt;Feel slight tremors in floor

&gt;A few game cases fall off the wall

&gt;The pigeons outside make haste away from whatever foul beast approacheth

&gt;Oh wait, it's just Turboham with an extra large McDonalds milkshake

&gt;*sluuuuurp*

&gt;TH: ""I hope you"" *sluuuuurp* ""didn't start without me.""

&gt;*sluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp*

&gt;ohgodpleasetalkaboutsomethingelse.fml

&gt;Pizza arrives

&gt;Pizza guy gets best timing of the year award

&gt;Comes in with 3 large pizzas, 4 2L bottles of pop, and 2 cheesecakes.

&gt;There are 5 of us

&gt;Get paper plates

&gt;Load up plates with 2 slices of pizza, get a cup of coke

&gt;Annie, Bree, and David do the same

&gt;Think of offering a plate to Turboham

&gt;Nope

&gt;She's gonna need a trough

&gt;Take 2 slices of pizza and coke, go and sit down

&gt;Commence feeding time

&gt;The 4 of us regular eaters start talking, taking normal sized bites

&gt;Turboham still not with us

&gt;See Turboham piling pizza on her plate 3 slices deep

&gt;Total of 9 slices

&gt;Briefly considers using a cup

&gt;[hfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/337.gif)

&gt;Grabs the bottle

&gt;Sits down

&gt;Starts mawing on the 3-deep pizza piles

&gt;4 bites and it's gone

&gt;Then the next

&gt;And the next

&gt;Begins to guzzle coke

&gt;Almost half the bottle gone

&gt;Lets out a huge belch

&gt;[mfw](http://replygif.net/i/221)

&gt;Almost done my first slice. She's demolished an entire pizza

&gt;Surely she must be done.

&gt;[lol](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/no-bird.gif)

&gt;Goes and refills her plate, same as before

&gt;All conversation has ceased

&gt;So has all eating (aside from her)

&gt;The rest of us just watching the show now

&gt;Turboham entirely oblivious

&gt;Sets in on pizza 2

&gt;Demolishes it quicker than the first

&gt;She's getting good at this

&gt;Polishes off rest of the 2L

&gt;[mfw she eats faster than my entire family put together](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/omg/oh_my_god.gif)

&gt;Only half the third pizza remains

&gt;Not for long

&gt;Those poor slices don't even reach her plate

&gt;downthehatch.avi

&gt;Downs the better part of a 2L

&gt;Looks at us

&gt;More likely at our unfinished pizza

&gt;TH: ""You guys going to finish those?""

&gt;I bite my tongue so hard it bleeds

&gt;B: ""All yours""

&gt;She passes the plates to Turboham

&gt;TH, to B: ""You really should finish yours. It's not healthy to be that small.""

&gt;Bree laughs.

&gt;Like, tears running down her face, trouble breathing sort of laughter

&gt;Turboham looks confused

&gt;No matter, there's pizza to consume

&gt;Destroys the remaining 2 and a half slices

&gt;Yep

&gt;She ate half-finished slices of pizza

&gt;Finishes her 2nd 2L

&gt;This is still within the first 25 minutes of having the pizza

&gt;TH: ""So who wants cheesecake?""

&gt;We all decline

&gt;Partially because we are full

&gt;Partially because we are disgusted

&gt;Mostly because the show must go on

&gt;TH: ""Teehee okay then. More for me!""

&gt; She opens the first cheesecake

&gt;Holyshitballs batman, these are like 8"" cheesecakes

&gt;likethatsaproblem.avi

&gt;It's gone in under 10 minutes

&gt;We are witnessing the birth of a legend

&gt;Or at least a food baby

&gt;TH: ""I think I need to go to the bathroom. Are you sure none of you want cheesecake?""

&gt;We just nod, too shocked to speak

&gt;She grabs the other cheesecake and goes to the bathroom in the back

&gt;She took the cheesecake into the bathroom

&gt;Into the fucking bathroom

&gt;I can't say this enough

&gt;She took

&gt;The cheesecake

&gt;To the bathroom

&gt;The rest of us sit there, too dumbstruck to speak

&gt;We just look at each other

&gt;Turboham comes out a few minutes later, sans cheesecake, of course

&gt;TH: ""Woo, I feel twenty pounds lighter ^teehee. I'm thirsty""

&gt;Grabs the third 2L

&gt;Downs half

&gt;Starts rambling on about her bf again

&gt;Still saying ""bf"" instead of ""boyfriend.""

&gt;That poor, poor man.

&gt;The rest of us can't do anything but nod

&gt;Probably going to need therapy

&gt;Over the next half hour of her senseless blithering, she finishes her third 2L

&gt;TH: ""Well, I need to go get home to the bf. Mind if I take the last bit of pop for the road?""

&gt;Again, too stunned to respond

&gt;silencemeansyes.jpg

&gt;Stuffs the 2L in her purse

&gt;Leaves

&gt;Conversation killed for the night

&gt;David: ""I need to pee, but I'm not going in there.""

&gt;We all need to pee

&gt;Nobody willing to bite the bullet and use that bathroom

&gt;Know this girl that is a ""plus-sized model"" in the UK.

&gt;She is big (lol) on fat acceptance and that the doctors are trying to discriminate against her, and she is about 5'0 and 300+lbs.

&gt;Somehow gets pregnant.

&gt;Develops gestational diabetes and blood pressure problems.

&gt;Doctors tell her to not gain much more weight when pregnant

&gt;She yells at them for discrimination, pigs out because ""NOBODY KNOWS MY BODY LIKE I DO!""

&gt;She goes into labor early, baby is dying.

&gt;Doctors are pissed, manage to save baby, born 2 months premature with defects caused by her diet.

&gt;She's smug because her baby didn't die, so that means she's not fat and the doctors LIED.

&gt;Gains more weight and gets pregnant several months later.

&gt;Last I heard was that the fetal growth scans were abnormal.

I really, really think there needs to be a point where you can just force people to stop breeding if they can't take care of themselves.

So, about a month has passed since the lake incident. OG got another job, I still have my two, and anytime we’re not working we’re watching Netflix or sleeping.  I stay with OG most of the time, because I have roommates and he doesn’t. Plus, his TV was like 4 times the size of mine, and his bed was better. lol. I haven’t heard from either Jigglybitch or Slow bro since the lake. OG however gets texts from JB pretty frequently, all flirty, none answered. I told him to forward them all to my brother, but OG hates confrontation. 


&gt; Be me, at work at job #2, being a slave to hamplanets at a popular fast food chain. It’s around midnight, and the line of cars is wrapped around the building. 

&gt; It’s storming like a mother fucker. 

&gt; Power goes out. Register is down. Can’t cook food.

&gt; Lolfuckthis, smoke break time. (I used to smoke, judge me motherfuckers. It kept me from killing customers)

&gt; Phone rings, it’s OG. 

&gt;”Hey, if you’re wanting me to bring home food you’re in luck, powers out and I think we’re closing early.”

&gt; pause… silence on the other side. 

&gt; “Hello?”

&gt; “I’ve done a stupid thing.”

&gt; Ohshit.

&gt; “What did you do?”

&gt; “Well.. slowbro called me, and told me their trailer was hit by a tree branch, and they can’t stay there tonight.”

&gt; “..and?”

&gt; “…I told them they could crash here for the night”

&gt; “You did WHAT?! Are you crazy?”

&gt; “Sorry babe, I know you don’t like being around them but I couldn’t leave them stranded. It’s just for the night.”

&gt; Yeah, right. Damn him for being too nice for his own goddamn good.

&gt; “alright, whatever. We’re closing up and I’ll be done in about 45 minutes, if you come pick me up I’ll throw together some burgers real quick.”

&gt;My windshield wipers sucked and I didn’t want to drive in the storm. Also, I frequently brought home a shit ton of food, because fuckthatplace.

&gt;We clean up close the store down, I throw together about 6 big ass double cheese burgers, a few things of fries, and chicken nuggets into a bag because we’re not supposed to sell them. 

&gt;Oh look registers are down, I can’t ring them up. Night manager doesn’t give a shit anyway. 

&gt;OG arrives, brings me a new pack of smokes and a monster.

&gt;Grateful, because I’ve been working since 8 am, but suspicious, because I didn’t ask for them.

&gt; “OG, why are you being so nice?”

&gt; “You’ll see.” 

&gt; I inhale quite a few cancer sticks to prepare for whatever I was about to face. 

&gt; I walk in, living room is a fucking disaster. I left it damn near spotless when I left for work this morning, OG was on 3rd shift schedule, so he was sleeping most of the day. 

&gt; Slowbro comes out of the bathroom and walks into the living room.

&gt; Me- “What the fuck happened in here?”

&gt; Slowbro “uh sorry, I’ll clean it up.”

&gt; I look around the room. Wrappers, empty mtn dew cans, and empty beer bottles litter the room. I spot SlowBro’s backpack, and then a large open duffle bag that judging by the enormous lacy underthings on the top had to be JB’s.

&gt; “This IS just for one night, right?”

&gt; Slowbro assures me it is. 

&gt;Whatever. I go into the kitchen to start unloading my mountain of fast food bags. 

&gt;OG sits at the bar and asks which one is his. (he’s a picky eater) I toss it to him, and he digs in.

&gt;Slowbro comes in and asks if he can have a burger. I toss him one.

&gt;I have plenty, and I sure as hell aren’t going to eat them, I spent all day around the beetus inducing grease piles. They don’t even look like food at this point. 

&gt;Wait a minute, where’s JB?

&gt; “She said she was gonna take a nap, she’s pretty worn out.”

&gt;Yeah, I’m sure unemployment is exhausting.

&gt;Wait. I look out, and she’s not on the couch, or in the chair. This place only has one bedroom. That means..

&gt;I look at OG. He shakes his head.

&gt; Me- “Aw hell no. That’s MY bed.”

&gt; I walk in to the bedroom to see giant pasty cottage cheese ass, in underwear that sure as shit didn’t cover much. She’s asleep in what must have been a hot air balloon that someone cut sleeves and a neck hole into, which barely came to her fupa, and lacy gag inducing panties. IN MY BOYFRIENDS BED. 

&gt;Now, OG was only gone for about 25 minutes, top. And I was pretty sure she was fake sleeping.

&gt; I walk calmly back into the kitchen, fill up a pitcher full of water, and go back in to dump it on the bitches head. 

&gt; *SPLASH*

&gt; “WHAT THE FUCK” 

&gt;The beast rolls over, arms and legs flailing, probably the closest thing to exercise she’s ever done in her life.

&gt;See’s that it’s me.

&gt;”AREN’T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE *WORKING* OR SOMETHING, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FOR? CAN’T YOU SEE I WAS TRYING TO TAKE A FUCKING NAP. I AM SO TIRED, I’VE BEEN BUSY ALL DAY.”

&gt; “Get the fuck out of OG’s bed, right this fucking second, and put on some goddamned pants.” I say, as calmly as possible. 

&gt; “NO, I’M SLEEPING IN HERE TONIGHT I CAN’T SLEEP ON THE COUCH I HAVE BACK PROBLEMS.”

&gt; Actually, I’m sleeping in here. And OG is sleeping in here. After I wash these sheets. 

&gt; The beast sits up, and gets dangerously close to my face.

&gt; “THIS ISN’T YOUR HOUSE, YOU CAN SLEEP ON THE COUCH, YOU DON’T HAVE BACK PROBLEMS.”

&gt; I notice her breath smells like vodka mixed with the usual rotting blood of her enemies. 

&gt;I look around the room, and spot my bottle of expensive vodka sitting open on the dresser. 

&gt; “Did you seriously get into my vodka?! OG was only fucking gone 20 minutes.”

&gt; “teehee I THOUGHT IT WAS OG’S, HE WOULDN’T MIND”

&gt; I’m done.

&gt; “GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS ROOM RIGHT FUCKING NOW AND PUT ON SOME FUCKING PANTS.

&gt; “FINE! YOU DON’T HAVE TO YELL AT ME, GOSH!” (Yes, gosh, like napoleon dynamite.)

&gt; The beast storms out of the room. I appear to be victorious. 

&gt;I shut the door and grab some of OG’s clothes to put on, so I can wash my uniform and the sheets. 

&gt; OG is much taller than me, his shirts come to about mid-thigh. I decide that’s good enough, throw everything in the washer, and go back to the kitchen.

&gt; I mix myself a screw driver, put the vodka in the freezer, and tune in to OG an SB’s conversation. 

&gt; Then I realize all 4 of the remaining burgers were gone.

&gt; I check the other bags, all of the fries were missing. 

&gt; Yep, chicken nuggets too. 

&gt; I ask Slowbro and OG, nope, they just had their burgers and split some fries. 

&gt;OG gestures towards the living room. 

&gt; Sitting on the couch, surrounded by food and empty wrappers, with a 2L of mountain dew currently draining into her face hole, was Jigglybitch. 

&gt; “Are you fucking kidding me?”

&gt; JB looks up, startled, and throws her giant arms up as fast as they can fight gravity, to protect her kill.

&gt; “MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS LOW, I HAVEN’T EATEN ALL DAY. I HAVE A CONDITION. JUST BECAUSE YOU NEVER EAT DOESN’T MEAN US *REAL* GIRLS SHOULD GO WITHOUT EATING. WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME TO BE ANOREXIC LIKE YOU?”

&gt; OG hears the yelling and walks in.

&gt; “Do you have any idea how many calories you are currently ~~cramming down your massive throat~~ eating?”

&gt; “teehee I NEEDED SOMETHING TO SOAK UP THE ALCOHOL teehee WOULDN’T WANT ME TO GET DRUNK, I LOSE CLOTHING WHEN I’M DRUNK teehee”

&gt; I’m not intoxicated enough to deal with this.

&gt;OG suggests we go smoke, before I punch her in the face. 

&gt;Fine. 

We go outside on the back porch so I can inhale as many cancer sticks as it takes to convince myself not to kill that beast. It took a while, apparently I needed a lot of convincing. I’m sitting on his lap, because he only has one chair out there. It gets pretty chilly out there at night, and I am easily cold, so I run in for both a drink refill, and a jacket. 

&gt;As soon as I walked in the back door I hear “OH I SEE, YOU DON’T HAVE TO WEAR PANTS BUT *I* DO. GOD WHAT A SLUT. NO WONDER OG LIKES YOU, YOU’RE EASY. 

&gt;Yeah, okay.

&gt;I go into the kitchen to make an extra strong drink, and clean up the fast food mess while I’m in there. I grab OG’s jacket, and head back outside. 

&gt;Jigglybitch is sitting on the railing, which is bending perilously under her massive girth, giggling ridiculously at something. 

&gt; “OH HI teehee I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT OG, HE IS SOOOOOO FUNNY teehee”

&gt; “Yeah, that’s nice.” I say, and sit back on OG’s lap as I light another cigarette. 

&gt; “OG I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU *LET* HER SMOKE, SHE’S GOING TO KILL YOU WITH HER SECOND HAND SMOKE. CIGARETTES ARE SO BAD FOR YOU.”

&gt;For the record, OG is smoking too. 

&gt; “I don’t *let* her do anything, she makes her own decisions. 

&gt; “OMG YOU ARE SO WHIPPED. WTFITSARIES YOU SHOULD QUIT SMOKING SO YOU CAN BE HEALTHY LIKE ME. ” 

&gt; “smoking keeps me from killing people. Plus, since when are you healthy?”

&gt; “EXCUSE ME? ARE YOU SAYING I CAN’T BE HEALTHY BECAUSE I’M A LITTLE BIGGER THAN YOU? AT LEAST I DON’T SMOKE, OR STARVE MYSELF. YOU DIDN’T EVEN EAT DINNER WITH THE REST OF US, BECAUSE YOU’RE ANOREXIC.”

&gt; I just blow my smoke deliberately in her direction until she storms back into the house to complain to Slowbro that I am being mean to her. 

&gt; OG and I laugh at her stupidity, and try to enjoy what little piece and quiet we can get. 


Fast forward a few hours. Slowbro is crashed out in the chair in the living room, I just got done making myself a smoothie, and OG and I are about to head to bed. 


&gt;Jigglybitch heaves herself off of the couch as soon as she notices that I am headed for the bedroom. 

&gt; “*OG*” She says in a sickly sweet voice “DON’T YOU THINK I SHOULD GET THE BED? YOU KNOW I HAVE BACK PROBLEMS. I SHOULDN’T SLEEP ON THE COUCH. BESIDES, SHE DOESN’T LIVE HERE EITHER,  teehee.”

&gt; “You want me to make my girlfriend sleep on the couch, so you can have the bed. Seriously?”

&gt; “teehee IT’S JUST FOR ONE NIGHT, teehee I PROMISE TO BEHAAAAVE. *wink* UNLESS YOU DON’T WANT ME TOO. teehee”

&gt; me- “You do realize I am standing right here, right? And that my brother *your boyfriend* is asleep less than 5 feet from your ass? Quit making a fool of yourself and go to fucking bed.”

&gt; She gets pouty, mumbles about her conditions, and plops back onto the couch. 

&gt;I have never felt sorry for a piece of furniture in my entire life, until now. 

The next morning, I wake up around noon, since I only had to work at one job. OG is still asleep. I come out, and start making coffee, open the fridge and it’s totally empty. Now, neither of us are there very often but I know that there was at least a dozen eggs, some random left overs, a couple of cans of monster that I take to work, a tub of butter, and a loaf of bread in there. It was all gone. I look into the living room to see Jigglybitch sprawled out on the poor couch, in just her underwear, surrounded by food wrappers, face still covered with the greasy sheen of a tub of butter. 


Her excuse? 


&gt;“teehee IT WAS SO HOT, I COULDN’T SLEEP, SO I TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES teehee. AND I GOT HUNGRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND MADE A SNACK teehee. 



Note: /u/negativeraptor pointed out that OG needs a pokemon name to fit the theme of Jigglybitch and Slowbro. My brain is mush from low blub sugah, so I need suggestions!

**Chapter Sixteen**

Time is a very strange companion.

The two weeks preceding my second date with Lauren were both the longest and the shortest - at least up until that point - of my entire life. For some of the span, the hours seemed to fly by, particularly on those evenings that fell before my final exams. On other occasions, each passing second would slow to a crawl, then slam into the next one like a collision in a temporal traffic jam. The wait was excruciating, and replaying my kiss with Lauren soon lost its sense of potent satisfaction. I had to see her again.

We kept in touch, of course, though both Lauren and I agreed that our outing with Porcina (and her  oddly mannered boyfriend) hardly counted as an acceptable first date. We had committed, as Lauren had put it, to a “do-over,” and were again holding conversation in reserve. At one point, during a period of glacier-like clock progression, I took to writing down a list of prospective questions and stories, though I scrapped it, in the end, in favor of organic interaction. I had also sworn myself away from stopping by the bookstore, lest my presence become unwelcome or give the wrong impression. Thankfully, my paranoia had largely subsided, and my urges to visit Lauren at work had become driven by – rather than a fear of being avoided or misled – desire alone.

Two Fridays passed at last, as did the remainder of my classes for the semester. Winter break had arrived, and with it, a host of seasonal workers for every mall outlet and kiosk. I had hoped that the added employees would lighten the load at Lauren's own job, but as a senior associate, she was delegated the task of training many of the bookstore's temporary hires. Her weekday schedule was suddenly full, but a spark of serendipity had left her free for a date that Saturday evening. We planned our excursion, both of us delighted by the prospect of an evening alone together.

Then, there came an omen.

It arrived in my email's inbox, an assault of atrocious formatting and far too many font styles: “AARON'S BON VOYAGE” was the subject of the message, and its body was festooned with clipart graphics of a sailboat and a cake. “My darling boy is leaving tomorrow!” the bright pink letters read. “I'm throwing him a PARTY! Please RSVP with what you are bringing and please don't bring anything that needs much cooking!” There followed a list of acceptable options, many of which – like lasagna, for instance – seemed to violate the very rule they were meant to exemplify. The letter's recipients numbered close to fifty, which left me wondering how Porcina had managed to acquire so many email addresses.

My phone rang shortly after, and my heart leaped with excitement. It was Lauren!

“Have you checked your email?” she asked, sounding not at all happy.

“Yeah,” I replied, “I just got Porcina's party invitation. Are you expected to attend?”

Lauren sighed with frustration. “I told her I would help when she asked me last week. She *said* it was going to be tomorrow, but I guess she changed her mind.” I wondered if the decision had been a well-meaning attempt by Porcina to work around Lauren's hectic work schedule, but something told me that the timing was less than considerate in its nature.

“Why,” I asked, a thought suddenly occurring to me, “did she wait until today to send out invitations? That seems like pretty short notice, especially if she expects all of those people to attend.”

“I said the same thing.”

“And that list of food?” I continued. “I mean, potlucks are fine and all, but her letter seemed a little bit... demanding.”

There was no immediate response, and I reminded myself – with a mental shout of “Shut up, stupid!” ringing in my head – that despite Porcina's failings, she was still Lauren's roommate and supposed friend. The two of them had reconciled in the weeks since the disaster at the restaurant, and I had heard that Porcina's last few envelopes had been accompanied by disappointed letters from her parents. (Apparently, Lauren had felt that an appeal to a higher authority had been necessary.)

“Sorry, that was Aaron,” said Lauren at last.

“Oh,” I answered, relieved. “I didn't hear anything.”

“He wanted to know if there would be any single women at the party.”

I couldn't contain myself. “Okay, they're a *weird* couple,” I sputtered. Then, I quickly changed the subject. “So, uh, are you free tomorrow, then?”

Lauren paused again, and I could hear her tapping her teeth with her fingernail. It was an endearing (if unique) habit I had witnessed from the girl, and one which I could picture from the sound alone. “I'll tell you what,” she replied. “I'm not going to let anything get in the way again. You can put in an appearance when the party gets going. We'll leave together. If Porcina doesn't like it... tough titties.”

“Tough... titties?”

“Tough titties!” repeated Lauren.

I'd never heard the phrase. “What? Like, pectoral muscles?”

Lauren laughed out loud. “I mean, I won't let her stop us.”

“Great!” I said. “I mean, that sounds great. What time is the party? Porcina's letter didn't say.”

“Oh, goddamn it,” Lauren lamented. “I just realized she forgot our address, too. Expect another invitation soon, I guess. I need to go talk to her.”

“No worries!” I realized that blowing a kiss would be pointless over the phone, and more sappy than was necessary. “I'll see you tonight. Oh, and dress warm!”

True to Lauren's word, a second invitation soon came chasing the heels of its predecessor. This one was populated with acronyms for laughing, phrases like “Silly me!” and excuses of the sort that explained how Porcina had been “Just so excited!” It did, however, include a time, place, and dress code for the party, although that latter line was little more than “Sexxxy people clothes!”

I wasn't thrilled, of course, but I knew that I could manage. Parties were a staple of college life, after all, and I had been to more than a few. Each of them, in my experience, followed a similar progression: The first guests to arrive would mill around uncomfortably, staring at nothing in particular and offering small talk to whomever else was in attendance. As the throng increased, someone would have the brilliant idea of putting on some music, which would inevitably result in the resident with the largest sound system having to sacrifice their stereo for the benefit of the festivities. The lights would come down, the alcohol would flow, and the stoners in the gathering would somehow find each other. They'd occupy a bedroom and debate first-year philosophy, only to be evicted by an amorous (or at times argumentative) couple. Uninvited passers-by would filter in through open doors, and as long as they were of college age, they would be welcomed with open arms and iconic red cups. Someone – either as a drunken joke or in response to a noise complaint – would invariably shout “Pigs!” which would prompt the underage attendees to dive for cover (or first-floor windows). The music would be lowered and the laughter would resume, until a suggestion for a change of venue would permeate the masses. Then, a line of staggering figures, many of them play-acting, would file from the house and break into smaller clusters, each destined for a late meal at an all-night diner or a new-found friend's apartment. Hours later, finally, a friend of the host would discover a straggler who had either gone a little overboard and passed out in the bathroom, or a mushroom aficionado who had settled in the closet.

You get used to the routine.

Though I wasn't the most enthusiastic of revelers, I found myself actually looking forward to the party. Porcina, I reasoned (or rather, hoped), would be far too busy with prospective lovers and relationship manipulation to take notice of me, and any social altercations could be avoided by melting into the assembled masses. If all went according to my stratagem, I could meet with Lauren, chat for awhile, then abscond with her and be long gone before any escape was noted. Lauren's promise to be present would be suitably honored, I would have some time to warm up my social graces, and Porcina would be distracted by food and celebration. It was perfect. 

As they say, however... even the best-laid plans of monsters and men often go astray.

Good day to you all. Have you had your McBeetus yet today? No? Get a move on! You might want to read parts 1 and 2 if you want to understand the horror that is FAT

&gt;Be me, 5'11 125 pound female. Whiter than a baby's butt but damn cute

&gt;Don't be FAT, a short woman of an enormous size, about 300 pounds

&gt;go to day care

&gt;I love my munchkins

&gt;FAT is staring at me with her piggy black eyes

&gt;this can't be good

&gt;go about the usual morning routine

&gt;the Itsy Bitsy spider is my jam

&gt;new child in the corner doesn't know the words

&gt;awwwww is visibly upset by his lack of knowledge of a spider that climbed up the water spout

The boy has cerebral palsy. He started late because his mom had been deciding wether or not he could handle camp. Mentally he's normal, but he has trouble walking and his face (not being mean it's what it is) does not look normal.

&gt;I'm singing my heart out 

&gt;iwillalwaysloveyou.mp3

&gt;boy cannot approach me to ask to teach him the words for I am surrounded by toddlers

&gt;turns to FAT to ask her what the words are

&gt;has trouble talking too 'How do I sing the song?'

&gt;FAT laughs at him, it sounds like he's talking with a marble in his mouth

&gt;boy frowns and asks again

&gt;'What, are you stupid? You don't know this song?'

&gt;boy gets upset 'I'm not stupid! Mommy said I'm not stupid!'

&gt;FAT laughs

&gt;I have stopped singing and I stomp over to FAT

&gt;imperialmarch.mp3

&gt;'What is wrong with you, why would you say something like that?' I ask furiously

&gt;'He doesn't understand, he's a retard.'

&gt;please can I punch you

&gt;boy is crying, saying his mommy told him he's not stupid no matter what anybody tells him

&gt;my jimmies have fled the atmosphere

I am beyond done at this point. Either I get fired of she does, but someone has to go. So I grab the little boy's hand and herd the remaining children (all very confused) onto the playground. For those of you wondering, super-chill-teacher-lady has been sick. Another teacher says she'll watch them.

&gt;the whale song starts 'Where are you going?'

&gt;stomp out of room

&gt;go to the lobby and try to console crying child while I look up his mother's phone number

&gt;call mom and ask her to come to the camp,please

&gt;mom arrives and is concerned, she could hear the child wailing

&gt;explains situation

&gt;thought her head was going to explode, she was angrier than good ol' Soccer Mom

&gt;SHE CALLED MY CHILD A RETARD

&gt;I have never seen anger like this

&gt;it may have caused the earthquake in China

&gt;CPM (cerebral palsy mom) screams at director

&gt;hear her threaten to sue for emotional damage on her son 

&gt;YesSnegal.yay

&gt;intercom: 'FAT please report to the office IMMEDIATELY'

&gt;judgement day has arrived

&gt;5 minutes later FAT rolls out of the office crying 

&gt;she has been fired

CPM thanks me and says she told the director that if I get fired, her husband ( a lawyer) would represent me 

&gt;I don't deserve all of this luck

&gt;FAT waddles out of the day care 5 minutes later, clutching her Cool Whip

&gt;sees me and screams FUCK YOU

&gt;laugh at her

&gt;go back to class

I am victorious! 



Until I found out she asked the director where I lived the other day so she could 'drop off' something I forgot.

I think she'll want revenge...

PS little boy did not come back but I'm his babysitter now. He's probably the cutest thing ever.

&gt; I load mine up with beetroot and mustard because I don't have tastebuds. Most of the other staffers grimace and poke fun.

&gt; Get ready to scarf it down like a starving animal. Fuck you, I'm 121 lbs I am a starving animal don't judge me.

&gt; Take the first big bite, and some jerk needs me back in the deli. Wrap up my burger in foil, leave a stupid note on it to show that it's mine, get back to work.

&gt; Come back up an hour later, staff room is empty barring Check Out Chunk.

&gt; Fucking surprise, she's eating something.

&gt; Eating something that's dripping with the unmistakeable orange juice of beetroot mixed with mustard.

Foodgirl cannot match the Red Mist General and she rips the food out of her hands.

&gt;Is she really stealing my food?

&gt;By now the other patrons have surrounded Axe. Axe hasn't put any points into counter helix though.

&gt;""No, no, she said my name, you heard it.""

The foodgirl cups her hands together and yells, ""ITS OP's FOOD""

&gt;This stuns her and I'm able to grab the food from her red meaty fingers.

&gt;Axe makes an audible ""HMUUMPH"" sound then goes back to her stroller to wait.

&gt;I take my food and GTFO.

&gt;""This is taking forever!""

Literally 1 minute after they called my order, Axe's is ready. However she has shut herself off by retreating inside her delusional head that she doesn't hear the call and nobody nearby gave a fuck to tell her.

Hello again, dear readers. Let’s skip ahead a few months. Emily and I are officially dating (yay), and Nugget has been behaving herself. We havn’t interacted too much (unless pouty glares and audible “huffs” can be considered interaction) but from what I understand, during these three months she became a bit of a fatctavist. Whereas before she was just a misguided, awkward girl who happened to be fat, she has now evolved into what can truly be described as a hamplanet. Fat logic and thin privilege galore. This story centers around Emily, and a lot of the information I heard second-hand from her, so forgive me for any errors.

Emily, in addition to being a drop dead gorgeous pixie creature, is also a gymnast. (I know, I must have been a fucking saint in a past life.) She was pretty serious about it back in high school, but after coming to college had to take a break to focus on school. In the absence of this, she became a bit of a gym rat, working out every day. Sometimes I would accompany her, but it was pretty obvious I couldn’t keep up, even when she went easy on me. Enter Nugget. Emily knows the whole, sad tale, and bless her empathetic heart, feels *bad* for Nugget. She’s pretty tenderhearted, and she hates the idea that there might be bad blood between her and Nugget, especially because she has struggled with social acceptance in the past. On this note, Nugget still kinda hangs out with Chris and Devon. She’s obviously spurning me, but she seems to think they like her more than I do. (I later found out this was because Chris had made out with her during truth or dare. Twice. Classy, buddy.) So one day, Emily goes out of her way to fall in with the little group and tries to strike up a conversation with Nugget. She compliments Nuggets clothing, asking where she got that cute necklace. (Nugget refuses to tell her because she doesn’t want Emily “stealing her style” ^giggle) Emily says that she’s seen Nugget hanging around by herself and says she’s always welcome to come hang out with her and her friends. Oh dear lord. Did you ever put your foot in your mouth there, Emily. Clouds cover the sun. Birds drop out of the sky.

“I don’t need your *pity*.” Nugget says with disgust.

“E-excuse me?”

“You think you’re better than me because society tells you so, and because you think you “stole” Alex away, but size has nothing to do you with your value as a person!”

Emily stammers that she wasn’t trying to imply it did, just that she didn’t want anyone to feel left out. Nugget retorts that maybe she’d stop feeling left out if Emily stopped “ripping her friends away from her”. Keep in mind that this is the first time Emily and Nugget have actually talked. Emily is pretty bummed out. I try to explain to her that Nugget is just being a horrible person and she’s done nothing of the sort, but again, Emily hates the idea that someone is upset because of her. So when Nugget catches up with her on the way to the gym, she does her best to be friendly. Nugget (gasp) *apologizes* for her outburst and asks Emily where she’s headed. Emily is thrilled and says she’s headed to the gym, but she can skip and grab some coffee with Nugget instead. No, no, Nugget insists she not bother herself. Nugget will just tag along. Emily is a little hesitant (Nugget has probably never done gymnastics in her life, unless mental ones count) but never passes up a chance to make amends and so off they go. Poor, sweet, naïve Emily. If only I had a chance to warn her.

I’m on my way to class when my phone rings. It’s Emily. That’s weird, she usually leaves her phone in the lockers while she exercises. I pick up and in between sobs I hear her begging me to come to the gym and help her. I’m flipping out, of course, no idea what the hell has happened, so I sprint over there and find her limping out, being half-carried by two fellow gym-goers. What the hell happened? They help me get her to the health center and on the way she tells me what happened.

After arriving at the gym, she began her warmups as usual. Nugget sat on a nearby weight bench and just watched which was… a little weird, but whatever. Emily tried to make light conversation as she worked but Nugget was pretty monosyllabic. She continues, working through the equipment, Nugget watching, and she usually finishes up with a bit of a run on the treadmill. Nugget moves to sit beside the treadmill but Emily doesn’t say anything about it besides offering to run beside her. Nugget refuses, saying she’d prefer to stay there, and plays with Emily’s watterbottle. This is not one of the crumply plastic ones you buy in a 24-pack at Stop and Shop. She’s got some sort of aluminum, double layered, thermo-sealed nonsense going on here. It’s a pretty solid piece of equipment. And suddenly, with no warning whatsoever, Nugget somehow rounds up the strength of a thousand slaughtered hamburgers and cracks it right into Emily's knee. Emily goes down hard, the couple of people who witnessed it are speechless. Nugget throws down the waterbottle, looking a little unsure and screams “That’s what you get!” (I swear to god, I couldn't make this shit up.) before galumphing off in a pitiful imitation of a run. Meanwhile Emily's knee is seriously fucked up and in between getting helped to her feet she manages to tell someone to get her phone and they help her out of the gym. That’s where I showed up. At the health center we find out (iirc) that her knee has been hyperextended (like bent way too far back) and she was going to need to wear a brace for a few weeks and do some physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee to help it recover. Luckily nothing that will permanently affect her (otherwise Nugget would be in the fucking ground) but she’s going to be out of the running for a few weeks. They give her some pain killers and tell her to ice for the swelling and bruising, and we head back to her dorm. After making sure she’s comfortable, I head out on the warpath. I soon find out from the other people in the gym that she fled to the locker rooms, assuming that I wouldn’t be able to follow her in there. I am all fucking set to prove her wrong, but she’s screaming through the door that if I so much as touch it she’ll call the police for sexual assault and well… fuck. You know how that shit ends for the male party. But hey, two people can play at that game. I call up Devon and hastily explain the situation to her. Now her dislike of Nugget has been growing exponentially since Nugget made out with Chris those few times, since Devon had a bit of a crush on Chris. He had no idea and assumed he was forever alone, which lead to the makeouts with Nugget. Just a total clusterfuck. Devon shows up and kicks in the door. I can’t see what’s going on but damn, I can hear it. First the sounds of a tussle, fabric ripping, thuds and crashes. High pitched screams from Nugget. Gutteral swears from Devon. Suddenly, glass shattering. The door opens and Devon drags Nugget out by her hair (not a petty feat) and slams her to the ground. At this point I’m pretty sure Devon has done more damage to Nugget then Nugget did to Emily, so I call off the dogs and call security instead. Devon leaves so she doesn’t get in trouble (for breaking a bathroom mirror) and when security shows up Nugget tries to claim I followed her into the locker room and raped and brutalized her. Shit. Sadly for her, they already know all about her escapades because Emily called them after I left and explained what had happened. Thank you for not being a *total* doormat, sweetheart. In fact, as we talked several of the campus police showed up as well and she was ushered away. My jimmies were awash in sweet, soothing justice. But will the school come through for me? To be continued…

TL;DR: Fat girl acts sweet to my girlfriend, only to viciously attack her at the gym. Justice is served when my friend beats the shit out of her and campus police drag fatty away."	t5_2vzax	True
1375756878.0	1jsaky	A Sad and Infuriatting FPS. Weaboo Hamplanet infatuation. and the Kitten who is now in heaven :(	pipluppop	510	96	138	"Hey guys! The last story I left you with was funny, this one isn't. Its annoying and infuriating but really shows where fatlogic can lead =( 

&gt;Be me Piplup. Small spanish chick. Don't weigh self but have eating disorder at this time, so skinny. Have celiac disease (cant have wheat), also gymnast. 

&gt;Don't be Hamocamo. Huge 280~ weaboo guy also obsessed with the army. 

So I'm 15 in this story, just came to the UK and starting my first day at school. I speak fluent english (because its english, everyone does nearly) but apparently I still need a helper. I am assigned Hamocamo. He had chosen loads of optional languages (all asian) and was pretty smart so the school figured he could help me best. 

Now guys, I know some stories are slight works of fiction, but I promise to you that due to the nature of this story, I will not lie about or add anything. This guy GENUINELY talked like this. 

&gt;""PIPLUP SAN, SO GOOD TO MEET YOU"" *shakes my hand* ""WE WILL MAKE EXTREMELY GOOD PARTNERS"" 

Whatever, I'm just happy someone is being nice to me. 

So like i said this guy loved the army and stuff, we had a recruiting agent come round to the school and they ran a few sports classes to give us a taste of how tough exercise could be in the army. 

I got through it, but it was freaking tough, and stopping to get my breath at the water fountain, I see Hamocamo on the floor....in tears. Immidiately feel bad and rush over, but the instructor is already there. 

&gt;Instructor - ""I'm sorry lad but I think it's time to call it a day"" 

&gt;Hamocamo - ""I CAN DO IT, DON'T FEEL BAD FOR ME BECAUSE YOU THINK I'M FAT. I'M HEALTHY"" 

&gt;Instructor - ""Lad it doesn't work like that, you can't be fat and healthy""

&gt;Hamocamo - ""YOU CAN'T SAY THAT TO ME I'M A KID"" 

&gt;Instructor - ""It's just facts mate, fat is weight, and we all find things harder if we have a weight to carry"" 

&gt;Hamocamo - ""YOU PASSED PIPLUP AND SHE HAS AN EATING DISORDER, HOW IS THAT HEALTHY"" 

fuck you, Hamocamo. I trusted you. 

Fps, at this point in my life I am not the alpha spaniard of my previous tale. I'm a nervous 15 year old girl with an eating disorder, i cried and ran out. Aaaaand hid in my house. And got even more depressed, and extremely anxious that everyone would bully me because everyone knew now. No one even knew I wasn't at school. All my friends were in spain, my sister was in uni and my dad worked all day, earning back the money my whore ass extremely abusive mother had taken in their split. 

WHICH IS WHYY when Hamocamo apologized in an email (I ignored him calling me Piplup-San, and how he'd been ""extremely Baka"") and asking me over for dinner, I relented, and went over. 

Fps. The house stank of piss. Like, eye wateringly bad ammonia. As Hamocamo, (completely ignoring my personal space as all hamplanets seem to do teehee) dragged me in to his orbit for a crushing hug, all I could see was the urine stains of the entrance hall, even through the misty musk of BO and pee. 

Walking through what looked like a crack den, I saw the cause of the smell. So. Many. Animals. I'm talking like, 15 cats, ~7 dogs. In a tiny one floor flat. Feces, matted fur, red leaking eyes, itching, fleas. All conditions (that my years of sanctuary volunteering had told me) could be cured by just a small amount of care. 

&gt;""TEEHEE DO YOU LIKE MY PETS PIPLUP YOU CAN'T TOUCH THEM THO"" 

Just thinking about how i'm going to report this to the shelter I'm currently at. I may be beta but not when it concerns this. 

&gt;""BY THE WAY MAMA DOESNT KNOW YOU'RE STAYING FOR DINNER, BUT SHE PROBABLY WON'T CARE COS YOU'RE A LASS AND SHE THINKS I NEED TO MEET ONE"" 

wat. 

Before I can respond to this madness, I hear movement in the other room. No, continents weren't shifting, no things around me didn't spiral in to orbit, but I did see the most disgusting excuse for a human being I hope I ever will see. 

She was spilling out of her bariatric wheelchair. I can't even guess the weight, but due to the stench of feces I doubted that she got out of it much. She was blind in one eye, almost both from the look of it and was LITERALLY drooling through a few brown teeth. She had one leg missing and a few fingers too, one foot was bandaged and the cloth on it looked yellow and sticky. Her fupa and what I could see of her lower regions were stained with brown and creamy white. 

My first reaction wasn't disgust or anger, just sadness. I am no saint myself, and do not have a lot of sympathy for people who ruin their lives to this degree, but imagine the life that this woman was living. 


&gt;""HAMOCAMO WHO DA FUK IS THIS. IM NOT PRESENTABLE YOU LITTLE FUCK"" 

Pity gone. 

Hamocamo blusters something to his mum about my eating disorder and how he fucked up. 

The ladybeast turns on me. 

&gt;""YOU AREN'T EATING? IS THAT WHY YOU LIKE MY SON THEN, DOES HIS FAT BALANCE YOU OUT?"" -weird breathy laughter

&gt;""MAM IM NOT FAT IM GROWING"" 

&gt;""SHUT UP MAN, YOU NEED FAT TO GROW. HOW FUCKING STUPID CAN YOU BE, YOU CAN'T GROW IF YOU'VE GOT NO RESERVES"" 

(sadly my mum also believed that and made my little sister a really fat kid, its common in latin families) 

she turns backto me 

&gt;""ANYWAY MY DISABILITY CAME IN SO YOU'RE FUCKIN LUCKY YOU CAME FOR DINNER. NORMALLY WE STARVE, DUNNO HOW IM THIS FUCKING FAT LIKE"" 

never heard anyone swear so much in my life....

So, obviously pizza was ordered and I couldn't have it. During hypocritcal grunts of how i'm ""deathly"" skinny and need to eat. Bitch i told you i have celiac, what do you want. Just let me have a potato or some shit. 

Get bored as they gorge themselves and hear little mews. Look over sofa and see kittens :3 So teeny.

&gt;""YOU LUKIN AT MY KITTENS LASS, NEED TO GET THAT CATS PUSSY TAKEN OUT LIKE. ITS ALRIGHT THO COS NORMALLY THEY JUST DIE IF I DONT FEED HER"" 

what. bitch what the fuck did you just say. 

&gt;""DO YOU WANT ONE. I CAN'T REACH DOWN THERE TO GET EM"" 

Say yes, need to save at least one tiny kitten, but need to come back for the one i picked out in two or so weeks, still too teeny to leave momma. 

Feeding time is apparently finished, with starving pets begging for some food respectively punched or kicked away. Mentally noting down every offense. 

Want to leave so bad, have texted dad and he says earliest he can get me is 9pm. Thats like 3 hours away at this point. Dunno my way home =( 

I can tell that HamoCamo has been nervous for a while, ask him whats up and he says that he has something he needs to show me. Tells me its in his room.

Ohgodno. 

Takes me over to his desk, picture of me and him at one of the army seshes. Not too creepy, say ""awh its nice you kept it"" to be kind. 

He smiles at me really weird and says ""oh.... oh im so glad... im so glad you wanted me to keep that......please take a seat""

I sit gingerly on the dirty bed. As he rummages through a drawer, and hands me, very carefully a handful of slightly dog eared paper. 

Flicking through the drawings i see an extremely poorly drawn manga attempt. There's a girl, in a gymnastics contest with barely contained boobs, always blushing and has cameltoe. There's a guy who looks like hamocamo in every way apart from girth. and... and he's giving roses to the gymnast girl... and... and oh god he's pinching her nipples through her lycra...

It got worse... it got... graphic.. 

And I made the connection. And I didn't know how to react. He's not stupid and can see by my face i'm totally creeped out. 

&gt;me - ""is.. is this me....""

&gt;him - (panicking) ""well... i knew you wouldnt like me.... in this life... this real life... i thought if you saw what we could be....."" 

&gt;me - ""but it's not... a relationship its just... sex"" 

&gt;idfk why i'm even gracing this conversation with answers. It's a really really weird ball to be thrown to you guys. 

&gt;him - ""well i can't have sex right now... i'm too.... to large, i wanted to make a world where i could...."" 

awkward silence.

he's staring at me

so uncomfortable. 

&gt;HEAR BEEPING. PLEASE BE MY DAD. 

Loljkdattiming. 

Run downstairs, pretending i'm sure its my dad. Lie and say he called, means i can stay outside and not in his bedroom....  

He sits with me, eventually after awkward small talk, I am taken home. tell my dad everything, he laughs until the animal bit, and encourages me to tell the shelter where i;m working the next day. 

That night, I get a message from Hamocamo. ""the kitten you wanted died, one of the dogs ate him. I wanted to save him but i can't get down the stairs that fast, you can pick another one but it might get eaten too. ""

YEAH PROBABLY BY YOU YOU FAT PIECE OF SHIT. 

Anger in overdrive. Apparently thin privilege IS BEING FUCKING ABLE TO GET DOWN THE STAIRS WHEN YOUR DOG IS EATING YOUR KITTEN. 

Apparently thin privilege is FEEDING AND COMBING AND LOVING YOUR PETS. 

Go to bed in state of sadness and hate. Hamocamo mails me a gif of a rose. Don;t respond. 

Literally run in to my manager's office 10 minutes before work next day. Tell him everything while crying. He rings RSPCA (they can claim animals) and offers our shelter's help. I can't go, I have school. 


I'm told when I get back to work (like, 5 days later) that all the animals apart from mamma cat survived. She was too starved from giving all her energy and milk to her babies. Heartbreaking, and she didn't even have a name. Rip lovely kitties :( Also, that fat bitch was charged. I don't remember with what but it's 10 years before she can own another animal. I hoped she'd fucking die before that. 

I saw one of the dogs after that, he looked SO HAPPY guys. 

Apparently the huge bitch had said that taking her animals was discrimination because she was disabled and depressed and they were her ""help pets"" (like when genuinely disabled people have dogs they take around with them for seeing/comfort). 

I ended up transferring schools again due to dad's work. But HamoCamo would still send me love poems he just ""found and thought were funny"" some rose images and gifs, oh and eventually even more porn with anime me in it. 

Not perfect justice, but most of the animals were saved. Shelters are freaking amazing places. Sorry this wasn't as funny or happy but there's a lot of place for sadness in the world of fat too =( "	t5_2vzax	True

This was 9 years ago, when I was just a sweet, innocent little high schooler trying to save money for college and contribute to society. 

&gt; be me, 15, 5'7 &amp; 125lbs

&gt; have first summer job at a marine inspired amusement park manning soft serve ice cream machines in a little kiosk just outside whale show, while co worker takes orders &amp; cash

Kiosks out side the whale shows get hit just before and just after shows, and get hit hard. It's hard on the machines, which have trouble keeping cold and keeping up with demand. They sometimes need 2 minutes to recover.

&gt; it's 2:30pm, 100F hot sunny day, everyone wants ice cream so machines have constantly been running. Whale show is over, bring on the stream of people

&gt; ice cream machine needs a break, it's whining &amp; giving super drippy ice cream. Inform next customers there is a 2 minute wait for ice cream as it's way too soft to serve 

&gt; next customer, Hammy, is 350lbs+ of currrrrves. He needs his ice cream! He's feeling faint from low blood sugar and doesn't care it's just a bunch of slop! 

&gt; be good server, carefully make sloppy cone and hand to Hammy

&gt; Hammy freaks, says its too soft and I am a bad employee despite warning him several times of the condition of said ice cream

&gt; with all his strength, hammy throws ice cream at me. It sticks to my chest. Co worker stares, crowd stares, I cry, Hammy continues to freak

&gt; Supervisor driving by saw the whole ordeal. Security is called, Hammy is removed from park, screaming discrimination the whole time. 

&gt; I'm sent home early but get paid for the whole day, never get stuck in whale show kiosk again

TL; DR
Hammy asshole needs ice cream for condition, throws it at me because Its too melty, gets kicked out of park

&gt;class starts at 8AM but the bus schedule is fucked; either get there an hour early or twenty minutes late

&gt;bus arrives and I sling myself into the seat just behind the rear doors

&gt;promptly begin to doze, head vibrating softly against the glass as the engine rattles along

&gt;enter ham-planet

&gt;she's maybe 5'5 and almost completely spherical, gotta be pushing 140kgs

&gt;her hair is heavily styled, short-cut, dyed a deep almost metallic maroon and tortured into wavy curls; she's a Ham with The Hair

&gt;she should have spent that money on a gym membership

&gt;bus noticeably tilts to the side as she takes a seat opposite me

&gt;stench of perfume floods the air, oh jesus fuck my allergies

&gt;I'm still half asleep and am slow to avert my gaze as she looks me up and down, jowls wobbling as she devours a king-sized chocolate bar

&gt;diet coke clutched in the other paw

&gt;displays chocolate-caked grin

&gt;I look away

&gt;45 minute bus ride is punctuated by her grunts that segue into tee-hees as she fucks around on her phone

&gt;arrive at uni

&gt;escape the miasma of cheap perfume

&gt;glorious fresh air

&gt;head to cafe and get a coffee, retrieve laptop and start fucking around with a essay for my ***VERY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL ARTS DEGREE***

&gt;tee-hee and grunting as she talks all about the many boys that are courting her

&gt;has a fresh chocolate bar clenched in her mitt, presumably from one of the many vending machines

&gt;overhear 'MAH BLUHD SUGAH' several times as she orders a large Mocha (with extra chocolate, thank you very much!) and three muffins

&gt;oh how nice, she's getting snacks for her study buddies as-

&gt;nope.avi

&gt;sits down as her moons, Nerdette and Asia-Minor, order a small latte and a bottle of water respectively

Let us dwell on Nerdette momentarily as an explanation for what followed; frizzy haired brunette with pig-tails, glasses, freckles/acne, slightly long nose and pointed chin. Slim, wearing vintage styled clothes (IIRC, this was before it really 'caught on' where I'm from, so this did not speak of hipster at the time; it spoke of an actual lack of fashion awareness). 

My heart. Immediately, I am infatuated, as only 22 year old me could be.

&gt;the vision before me as Nerdette awkward-steps her way over to the table is suddenly obstructed

&gt;why is there a mountain range in the cafe

&gt;oh god, it's The Hair's tits

&gt;abort

&gt;no

&gt;STOP LOOKING

&gt;***FUCK***

&gt;raise gaze, piggy eyes lit up

&gt;tee-hee-tee-hee-tee-hee

&gt;I recover, pretend like nothing happened and continue my laptop fuckery

&gt;can't help but continue to glance towards Nerdette

&gt;every time I do The Hair interprets it as a glance towards her

&gt;ohgodwhy.jpg

&gt;finally, time for class

&gt;get to lecture hall, take a seat - two weeks in so it's only the third time we've had this lecture and I'm really slow to make friends

&gt;...

&gt;enter The Hair

&gt;of course she's in my class

&gt;of *course* Nerdette is still steadily orbiting her

&gt;***of course*** The Hair catches my eye and begins undulating over to me

&gt;sits next to me

&gt;the perfume is now undercut by the sharp scent of cheese

&gt;I don't know why, why doe she smell of cheese?

&gt;introduces herself

&gt;I state my name, rank and serial number, coughing slightly at the smell

&gt;Nerdette tries to say hello

&gt;The Hair physically blocks her by leaning forward

&gt;ok.gif

&gt;actually feel kind of sick

&gt;reaching crisis point

&gt;she asks what I study and I catch a full blast of her halitosis

&gt;alert: your olfactory senses are under attack!

&gt;engage autism defence mechanism, disregard social niceties

&gt;I stand up

&gt;I grab my books, laptop and bag

&gt;The Hair asks what is wrong

&gt;I cough slightly and say, ""I'm going to sit over there,""

&gt;The Hair begins to gather her things, agreeing with what a good idea that is

&gt;""Please don't follow me,"" I say, ""Your...perfume, is choking me.""

&gt;ohshi-

&gt;she begins to quiver

&gt;Nerdette is staring fixedly at her books

&gt;The Hair erupts into whale song; ""UHTS BE-COZ AHM FAT, IS-UHNT UHT?"" she roars

&gt;all eyes on me

&gt;I don't answer, and continue to move away

&gt;""YEW JUS CAHNT HANDLE ME!"" she lows, flapping a pudgy fist at me, ""WHO WOO-DUHNT WANT DESE CURVES?"" 

&gt;select new seat, begin to sit down

&gt;""WHAT ARE YEW, FUCKING ***GAY***?"" 

&gt;dead silence

&gt;we're doing an Arts degree

&gt;in a country where homophobia resides only in the lowest, shittiest sectors of the inbred sea of suburbia

&gt;approximately one third of the 150 strong class rotates very slowly to observe her

&gt;she's still quivering with rage

&gt;Nerdette is trying to disappear into her chair

&gt;I laugh

&gt;I laugh so hard that I feel sick

&gt;soon, almost everyone is laughing and The Hair is having a small breakdown in her chair, ranting to herself

&gt;finally the lecturer arrives and the class begins

&gt;put the incident out of my mind, deftly sidestep The Hair when we get out of class and resolve to take care to avoid her in future

Little did I know this was to set the pattern for the rest of my day. Part the Second coming soon!

&gt;postcript; encountered Nerdette in an afternoon class, free of The Hair's gravity

&gt;apologized for being rude to her friend/embarrassing her

&gt;she's fine, doesn't really know anyone at uni and just sat with The Hair because they recognized each other on campus that morning

My husband is a personal trainer and one of his clients has lost a considerable amount of weight. She is an awesome success story of working hard and eating healthy and it makes me (and husband) happy that she feels and looks awesome. 

However at her workplace, people have been not as supportive and kind towards her weight loss. Husband told me that she told him people at the office keep on asking her how she lost so much weight. She tells them that she does weight training and watched what she ate. Apparently no one believes her. They ask her what's her secret and what magic ""thing"" she is doing to lose weight. 

The coworkers say that it's not possible to lose weight by solely doing exercises and eating right. There must be a secret she is hiding.

Here, I am thinking wtf, people. Like, if she told them that her secret is grinding up bones and drinking that with their tea they would probably believe that and discredit all the hard work she has done through ""simply exercising and eating healthy""."	t5_2vzax	True

Be me. 130 lb, 5'5. Very physically demanding job. Lots o lady muscle. One aspect of my job is to give people we are unable to clear with a walk through metal detector patdowns before allowing entry into secured areas. (if this was republican people stories I could tell you about my fun time with their national convention... But neither here nor there.)
Beta boss pulls me away from other duties to handle one such patdown.
Me: Why didn't you just grab [invert available female officer name here] to handle this? I was right in the middle of something.
Beta boss: You are so much better at dealing with these types of situations.
Awesome. As I am handing off my interrupted business to said female officer I notice my watch has stopped. Wtf? Suddenly my large metal belt buckle starts pulling me off to the side. What could possibly be causing such a disturbance? Then I see her. Shorter than I. Five foot tops. Based on my experience watching the worlds fattest mom documentary I would assume her weight to be well over 500 bills. Dressed in the finest toga styled king sized sheet money could buy. She is sweaty from her industrial strength wheelchair ride from the curb to the door. (these chairs are made of large steel pipes and have castors on the bottom better suited for moving heavy freight. Why the fuck do we have these?) 
She is in full on rage mode regarding our faulty equipment. IE_ she does not fit through our walkthrouth. Am quickly brought up to speed that she has not been briefed on her alternate screening options as she has not allowed anyone a word in edgewise.
Engage dat Midwest charm...
Me: good morning miss! I understand we are going to be performing some alternate screening to get you on your way today.
Rage beast: you effing people and your effing BS beepin'door. How dare you expect people to get up and squeeze through that effing tiny thing!
See, the thing is these walkthroughs are huge. I have watched the amaze-balls pro wrestler known to all as the big show walk straight through no issue. Now that is a large powerful man if there ever was one.  Anywho...
Me: Miss I apologize that our equipment was not able to accommodate your needs but if you allow me to explain what I am able to do to get you through otoday...
Rage beast: I know your game! Every chance you lezzies get to grope a real woman, right?
Me: in order to assure your safety as well as everyone already inside the option I have available is a patdown. You seem to be familiar. 
Rage beast: whatever you sick fcks needed to do to get yer kicks. Have at it. But not you. can I at least be assaulted by a het-r-o?
So this tub-fat girl is assuming I will enjoy caressing her ham hocks and wants me no where near her. I can only think she came to this conclusion based on my hair. Mohawk slicked into a tight bun. Law by day, brutal metal babe by night.
Me: if you would like to wait for the next available female office you absolutely may.  But it might be a while as we have very few females on duty.
Rage beast: you do not understand. I need to get inside now! fine. Do what you have to. 
I explain how the part down works and once she claims she understands the process we begin. On a female to clear the under side of the bust we follow the natural ""swoop"" with the backs of our hands. I look said beast up and down. Where the fuck are her tits? There were pairs of round protruding lumps on her front but my Jimmies be damned if I could tell which were boobs. Experience kicks in and I decide a gal of her girth would have a pretty low hanging set. I mentally pick a pair and dive in. Turns out this genteel lass has rolls of fat on her tits. I realizes right there where I should have gone. Her pair was laying in her lap. Did I mention I still need to duo her lap and groin?
Me: supervisor!!
I explain there is no way I am going to lift up her breasts one at a time to check. Further more I would need to almost crawl under them to complete my search. Nope. Not happening. Not doing it. Also beast used derogatory sexual names. 
Beta supervisor: I regret to inform you that we are unable to properly clear you at this time with the resources available to us. If you would follow me over to (on duty pd) he will be taking over From here.
Rage beast then, and I shit you not, stood up and tried to make a break for it inside. 2 steps later she was losing her toga and being escorted out by pd.

&gt;be me, 18.

&gt;140 lbs, 5""3'. not great, but i've been working on it lately.

&gt;have ""friend"" who is pregnant.

&gt;thinks she's mother nature for being pregnant. 

&gt;friend is a small hamplanet before pregnancy, this does not change.

&gt;i would guess about 220lbs before pregnancy. 

&gt;body is similar to [this] (http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-24925-body-shape.htm#img).

&gt;she's very annoying, but i feel bad for her so i spend time with her.

&gt;doesn't have a car, so I drive her places (normally to get food.)

&gt;makes a drastic change, becomes extremely republican and extremely pro-life.

Now, I would like to mention I was a tad dogmatic back then. I don't have too much of a problem if you are republican (now), even though I am a democrat, as long as your political beliefs don't infringe on other's rights. Nonetheless, she knew I was a democrat and was always trying to change my mind by screaming her political beliefs at me. In retrospect, I kept my cool fairly well for an opinionated 18 year old college student.

&gt;becomes pro-life. becomes pro-lifer. 

&gt;small hamplanet tells me she is pregnant.

&gt;try and be happy, but she's only 19.

&gt;whatever.herlife

&gt;starts having me drive her everywhere.

&gt;oblige because i know she needs doctor's visits and i want her baby to be safe.

&gt;admits to me she was smoking almost a month into her pregnancy.

&gt;see small hamplanet is not such a small hamplanet anymore, and is rapidly expanding.

&gt;orders french toast, bacon, sausages, hash browns and toast.

&gt;isshesolvingworldhunger.nope

&gt;take her to the grocery store afterwards.

&gt;hamplanet buys two packages of bacon for ""tomorrows breakfast, tee hee.""

&gt;is bacon a prenatal supplement now?

By now I've gotten used to her gluttonous eating habits, and I think you get the point. Another favorite meal of hers were an entire box of frozen eclairs. On one occasion I took her to her to the doctor for an utrasound and check up. 

&gt;go to doctor, no idea how she affords such a nice doctor.

&gt;talks the entire way there about how insulting it is that they refer to her fetus as a fetus.

&gt;go in with her to ultra sound. See her fat belly in the flesh.

&gt;she's only a month and a half in, but it looks like she's 6 months along. 

&gt;claims her fat rolls are her baby bump.

&gt;go to doctor, doctor weighs her. 

&gt;[mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/brit_wtf.gif) the doctors says she's gained 30 lbs in her first month and a half of pregnancy.

&gt;you are only supposed to gain about 30-40 lbs during your entire pregnancy.

&gt;mfw when i have no face.

At this point the doctor is urging her to eat healthier and telling her the grams of protein and calories you should be eating a day for a healthy pregnancy. I know small hamplanet's intake is *much* higher than that from rough calculations, but I see her eye's glaze over as soon as ""protein"" is mentioned.

&gt;sees as an excuse to eat more bacon.

&gt;drive small hamplanet home, yells pro-life rhetoric. 

At this point I was losing my patience with her, she was always telling me I was one of those ""skinny bitches"" and testing my limits with how much bullshit logic she could spew at me about fetuses and guns. I had been driving her around for a while now out of pure kindness for her entitled ass, and all she could do was insult me-especially my driving (apparently it was too cautious). 

&gt;a few days later.

&gt;be driving around looking for food.

&gt;other friend in car is giving me directions to a place.

&gt;small hamplanet bitches about my ""too safe"" driving.

&gt;lordhelpme

&gt;friend accidentally gives me wrong directions.

&gt;shouts ""turn here!"" a little too late.

&gt;turn is still makable, so i take the chance.

&gt;small hamplanet goes into hysterics.

&gt;""i hope you didn't forget i was pregnant, ikbenf.""

&gt;starts breathing heavily because apparently a slight sharp turn is too much for her glowing figure.

&gt;lays down in back, pretends to do labor breathing.

&gt;she's only a month or so along but okay.

&gt;cries.

&gt;accuses me of trying to give her a miscarriage.

&gt;""i'm sorry you're pro-*abortion* ikbenf, but i want to keep this baby.""

&gt;[mrw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/angry1.gif)

&gt;say nothing. 

&gt;drive her home in silence.

&gt;drop her off. 

&gt;don't say goodbye.

&gt;never talk to her again. 

TL;DR: watch a small hamplanet turn into a regular hamplanet and use bacon as a prenatal supplement over the course of one month. ""friendship"" ends after the occasional insult to my ""skinny body"" and constant rants about needing to be pro-life. gains 30 lbs in a month. relationship ends when she accuses me of trying to give her a miscarriage for taking a sharp turn.

1375777645.0	1jstnu	A loss of £1000's of pounds of stock because a staff member hadn't eaten in a few minutes. (x-post from talesfromretail)	Oakwater	506	96	47	"As I was repeatedly told to x-post this here as you would apparently enjoy it, here you are my dears. 

I come here with a short tale of an exemplary staff member that unsurprisingly did not last long within our company.

Many moons ago I used to work for a well known UK High street health and beauty chain. Our store in particular was a very small store and as such we only usually had three members of staff working on sundays as that was our least busy day. 

This sunday was no different, in the store was myself, the assistant manager and lets call her ""Kay"". Kay was an extremely large girl in her late teens, she was one of the laziest and rudest staff members we had and she would frequently sit her large behind onto a foot stool and shuffle around make up for her entire shift rather than be useful in any single sense.

The day was a normal day and all three of us were there for the 10 - 4 shift. Kay had gone for her break at 12 because she couldn't ""last another minute without some food to keep her going"". This was pretty normal and I was more than happy to go for my break at 1.

Anyway, she rolled back to the shop floor 15 minutes too long from her break and I went for my lunch at 1 o'clock. As per my usual routine I went to the local supermarket to grab a sandwich and the manager had gone out back to do some paper work. This left Kay to man the shop for the 30 minutes I would be gone.

After devouring my sandwich and having a quick stroll to clear my head I walk back into the shop. 

I went to go tell Kay that I would be back out in a second as I just needed to dump my phone in my locker. But Kay was not at the tills as I expected she would be. 

Oh.. well theres a few people waiting at the tills but maybe shes gone to do a price check or something?

I walk round the store and eventally end up on the makeup aisle where a shock was in store for me.

The displays normally brimming full with expensive products were barren.

Strewn across the floor was a single blusher kit which had cracked and thrown it's contents across the aisle.

Shit.

I panicked and went to find the manager out back and told her what had happened. I was sent back to the front to go deal with the customers on the tills and a few minutes later the manager comes to the front and informs me that she had found Kay watching tv in the staff room having her second lunch.

Kay had decided that when I was out of the store on my lunch and the manager was in the office it would be the perfect time to have a break because noone would tell her to go do some work. 

Her laziness and desire to contantly stuff chocolate into her maw had cost our store several thousands of pounds in stock loss.

Amazingly.

Just purely amazingly, she wasn't immediately fired.

TL;DR Lazy coworker desire to stuff face means she leaves the entire shop unmanned for nearly 30 minutes. Thieves have a field day.


For the outcome honestly I'm sorry to say that the repercussions were not all that severe. She managed to blag her way out of it somehow with a written warning.

However for some closure, she was fired about a month later when our store manager caught her eating stolen crisps in the bathroom. I'm sorry for the dissapoint.

1371913357.0	1guvwf	The Prom Dress That Almost Wasn't	comedyofmanners	504	98	44	"When I was 16 I was asked to go to the seniors-only prom, which was a BFD in my small-town high school community. I went out and scoured the earth for the perfect dress and found it. Dress was light blue and a size 10. I was not. I tried it on in the store. It was beautiful, despite the fact that my face was rapidly turning the same light blue from lack of oxygen.

""This one,"" I rasped at my mother, sucking in my stomach like a champ, and in that moment I should have gotten the Oscar for pretending to be able to breathe.

Dress was so tight that every rib in my body was close to cracking and coming out of my body. Prom was months away. Using typical fatlogic, I convinced myself that I could lose the weight while still sitting on the couch and doing nothing. Dress went in the back of the closet and was forgotten about. Diet was forgotten about. Twinkies were consumed. OM NOM NOM.

Prom day rolls around and I go to put the dress on. Zipper sticks halfway up my body. I realize that I have either stayed the same weight or gained some. Formal dress is a size 10. In regular clothing it would have been about an 8. I'm a 12 on a good day. Doesn't sound too bad, but I'm about 37% bodyfat at this point, so I take up more than my fair share of space.

I yell for my mother, not yet panicking. Mother comes in. Tries not to snort with laughter. Smile fades when she realizes the zipper is STUCK halfway up my back, and there's nothing she can do about it. I am fifty shades of red from the exertion. My mother bellows for my father. Father turns fifty shades of gray at the prospect of dealing with anything involving female undergarments and clothing. Father is the strong kind of fat but even he can't get the zipper up. Both he and Mother are half-crying from a combination of panic and hysteria. I am shaken, twisted, and jerked around so much that I suspect a mini concussion. We eventually resort to cooking lubricants and douse the zipper in PAM. Zipper grudginly slides up. I spend the entire prom looking fabulous, but with my kidneys mashed to the front wall of my abdominal cavity. I was numb from my boobs to my crotch. You could have stabbed me and it would have been three days before I felt the pain.

To this day I refuse to buy anything that will ""fit when I lose a couple of pounds.""


TL;DR: Delusional fat girl can't zip herself into prom dress. PAM saves the day."	t5_2vzax	True

1370912528.0	1g34am	Hammey loses a husband	lawrish	488	81	98	"First time posting here, so I'm still not totally sure of the usual lexico. Please be gentle! Anyway, here I go.


It starts as a conventional story: Guy meets girl. They're both smart, really get along, they can talk about anything for hours. They start dating, they're happy, shit gets serious. He gets a job across the state and moves. She goes along. She starts insisting on marriage, so they get married.


**Commence marriage!**


Let's call the girl Hammey and the guy S.

Hammey hated her job, so S proposes for her to quit and look for a new job, he'll take care of all finances. Hammey quits.

Hammey stays all day at home, sitting in the sofa, occasionally looking at job ads. Turns out that to get a new job in her field, she needs IT skills. Guy works in IT, offers to train her. Offer rejected.

S arrives after a long day work, dishes are not done, dirty clothes are everywhere, refrigerator is empty, house is dirty. ""What did you do all day?"" ""I watched TV and googled for jobs"".


With all the inactivity, Hammey went from chubby to planet in no time. 


**Let Fat Logic begin...**


""(While eating her second pint of ice cream) I don't understand why I'm gaining so much weight!"".
""I'm not fat, I'm curvy""
""I don't need to take care of myself anymore, we're married, I don't have to win you over, I already have you"" (killHerNow!)


**And the laziness, oh, the laziness...**


Like drinking the whole bottle but a sip, and not replacing it because ""there's still some"", same after leaving one spoonful of food and not doing dishes. 
""The dog needs to go out, but I'm in my pijamas, so you'll need to take it"". 
""I'll pick up my dirty underwear from the bathroom later. What do you mean? I don't think they've been there for 3 days already!"".
""I took the dog's water bowl away so he won't drink water, he won't need to pee and i won't have to take him for a walk"" (grrrr, poor dog!)


**And as her size exponentially grew, her insecurities did too.**


""Why are you wearing perfume to work?? You're cheating on me, aren't you? Why else would you wear perfume???""
""S, why aren't you home? At a bar with coworkers? Well, I'll go meet you there. I'm not invited?? Then you need to go home. Why don't you want to come home?? You're cheating on me, aren't you??""


Finally, after some time of this situation S had enough. Each time he had tried to talk about their issues, he would get absolutely no compromise from her, so they had The Talk where he told her it was over and that he had no money for the divorce at the moment, but that he consider them no longer husband and wife. Hammey cried, promised to change, wanted to talk about their issues, but after all the time he had asked for it without seeing results... it was too late.

She left the apartment they shared (it was on S's name) while he was away on a business trip. She took ALL the food there was in the house, including spices, cereals, vinagre and oil, etc etc. S considered it a small price for getting rid of her.


Enter me, who after some time of friendship (and lot of disdain for Hammey) waited a minimal time and threw my attack. Success! 

We live far from each other, so he invited me to his place for a couple of weeks. That place he had shared with Hammey. You can see where this is going...

One morning we go away, we don't come back until late evening. I hate leaving lights/fans on when noone is home, so I do a quick round before leaving, turning everything off. We arrive and the fan in the bedroom is on. Weird, I must have forgotten to turn it off. S checks something in the kitchen and announces ""Hammey was here"". Yep, he was never able to make her return the key (thanks for the warning, love!).

So we looked around, to see what she saw...

- In the bathroom counter 5 or 6 girl perfumes. Girl supplies and makeup in the drawers (Yeah, I made myself comfortable :P).
- In the tiny laundry room, which had the door open, there was a sweater and a lacey underwear set hanging to dry (the drier destroys them). Think a US size 6.
- Woman shoes in the closet. Think US size 8.

Well, I guess she knows you're in a new relationship! 


He calls to complain and to, once more, ask for the damn key. Shouting match starts. He starts laughing and hangs up. What did she say?


**""You're dating a little girl! Those were too small to be women's! You're a pedophile! I'm going to destroy you in court!""**


As a final comment to round this up, when they went to court her lawyer requested a list of all sexual encounters S had since separating from her, including name of the other person, place, date and time. (WTF???) Tried to get a monthly payment from S (why?? no kids (thank you higher powers!), she was totally capable of working and had given up nothing for S). Motion denied, even after she presented some screenshots of gtalk conversations between S and I.


**Hammey is out of our lives. She got bigger.**


Wow, it was much longer than I intended, I guess I had a lot of catharsis to do :P.


**TL;DR**: Chubby girl uses fat logic and laziness. It's super effective! Your chubby girl has evolved into a Hammey. Hubby gets tired of her shit, dumps her, gets a new girl (moi!) not of celestial dimensions. Hammey snoops around his home, finds evidence of normal size clothes and assumes ex-hubby is a pedophile, because ""those are little girl clothes! no women fit in those!"".

1370360710.0	1fnns9	The tale of how a nice girl went full Hammy Hippie.	redberin	483	77	108	"This is just a tale of how my friend K went from a regular, nice, somewhat overweight girl, to full blown hammie with fat hippie logic.  

I'm a 25/f who weighs approx: 145lbs.  K was around 5'5"", same age, and weighed 175lbs.  She and I have been friends since high school.  She was always wonderful, but over time we lost our friendship.  We decided to meet up recently to rekindle our relationship and drink some brews while we are at it. 

Now, I'm the first to say that I'm a jam band loving, tye dye wearing, birkenstock girl.  lovedemjamz.jpeg.  But the thing about me, I don't buy into hippie logic.  I don't believe in chakras, auoras, souls, herbal alternatives to medicine and what have you.  I just really like jamming out to some Phish.  And I don't smoke pot. 

K was always a stoner, super sweet though and nice.  When we met up, I expected to see the same old K.  That was my first mistake.  When she walked into the bar, I recognized her right away...except a few things had changed.  She went from 175 high school weight to 260lbs soaking wet.  She had disgusting matted dreads and was wearing yoga pants that were 2 sizes to small for her.  She reaked of pot.  

We sat at a booth and ordered some beers.  I got cheap ass PBR and she got some organic house made expensive as fuck brew.  I bet it taste good.  She also ordered chicken wings, fried pickles (a midwest favorite), fried mac n cheese (even though growing up she was lactose intolerant), a basket of french fries, and a few sides of ranch.  

""But k, aren't you lactose intolerant?"" I asked.
""Teehee, yeah, but a little won't hurt."" she replied.  

Wonderful. Now I probably have to put up with her rancid fucking farts for the rest of the night.  Lactose intolerant farts are the worrrrrrrrrst.  

We begin talking about our lives for a while.  I tell her that I've been in school, was working hard but having some issues with depression.  Now, when we were friends before, she and I both dealt with our issues.  She was off and on medications, while I tried to stay above water without them.  We talked for a while about this, then she asked if I was taking meds to help.  

I thought the conversation was going to go down the path of two friends who have a mutual issue talking about what works for them and which doctors have helped etc.  But no. It went down this path.

Me: Yes, I started taking Lamictal and blah blah blah.  Do you still take anything?

K: NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.  I would never let those harmful chemicals into my body.  My holistic doctor and I came up with an herbal based regime that REALLY works much better.  My auora has turned from black to yellow!  Can't you see?

Me: Uhh...sure...

K: I can't believe you're taking those medications.  It's so bad for you. (said as she dips another fried pickle into a giant vat of ranch and stuffing it down her gullet)

Me: Well, I've noticed some major improvements.  I'm feeling better.

K: you should see my holistic doctor.  He might be able to help with your weight problem too.

Me: My WHAT problem?  (I was running daily and eating healthy. I worked hard to drop a lot of weight that I had gained throughout my depression.)

K: Your weight! You're so underweight.  You should come with me to Whole Foods tomorrow and we'll get you some stuff so that you get healthier!

So, anything after this point is all just hippie fat weirdo logic.  Basically, she launches into a tirade about how yoga has helped her life so much (and then tries to show me some poses which she can't actually do at all), tries to get me to smoke pot with her in the bathroom, tries to steal my anti depressants out of my purse, and berates the waitress for not having ORGANIC MIXED SHOTS. 

When I left, I noticed she had tucked the card of her holistic doctor into my purse.   Out of curiosity I called, and honestly, it sounded just like the episode of It's Always Sunny where Pdiddy plays a holistic doctor out of a garage.  It was sketch. 


I never saw K again...except when I went to a Gogol Bordello show.  But that's another story. "	t5_2vzax	True

It was kind of awkward because our friend, Kirk, had gotten behind the wheel of a car drunk, underage and without a license and killed not only himself but a young woman and her 3 month old child.


At 16 and 17 we didn't exactly know how to process this. For many of us Kirk was the first person we'd ever known who had died.


Enter, Hamanda. She looked like 2 chunky people put together she was so obese. We hated Hamanda and we were the Freaks and Geeks of our school. We would accept anyone without judgement, that was our thing but Hamanda was just a shitty human being.


She didn't know Kirk and she wasn't invited but she had a reputation for showing up anywhere there was going to be a gathering of people and there might be food and or booze.


Yes, we all drank underage and yes, it was probably stupid to memorialize a friend who had driven drunk by drinking but we were teenagers and it made sense to us at the time.


We're all sitting at the camp site, on coolers and blankets. Kenneth had given a moving speech about how what Kirk had done was stupid and wrong and it was okay for us to all kind of hate him for it but it was okay for us to still care about him too.


Kenneth had known Kirk the longest, over 10 years as they were next door neighbors. I and the only other girl (aside from Hamanda) were hugging each other and crying.


Hamanda's car pulls up and she gets out.


""Hiiiiiiiii!!! What's going on, everyone!!!"" 


Loud, obnoxious, overly fake friendly voice that made me just want to kill her. In the group I was known as the Bitch and deservedly so. Most of the group became friends through me, because I had stood up to people bullying them or mistreating them.


I was a very vicious with my words and, when provoked, with my fists so ""beta"" type people tended to hide behind me.


Naturally, it was me who answered Hamanda.


""Hamanda, we're mourning our friend Kirk. This is a private group and you're not welcome. Leave.""


""Well, I knew Kirk too!"" Hamanda joins to group, plunking her fat ass down on the side of a blanket. She grabbed the nearest drink, which someone had been drinking out of less than 10 seconds ago and snatched a packet of chips out of Kristin's hands.


Me: ""Fuck off, you fat shit. You didn't even know Kirk. Fuck your fat fucking face and piss off.""


Did I mention we hated Hamanda? She stole food, she stole money, she had taken advantage of our friend Carl whilst he was drunk. (although this being Australia when it was reported to the authorities no one took him seriously because the perpetrator was a woman.)


Hamanda ignores this and we all exchange looks of horror, knowing that this horrible person is going to ruin our memorial. She's too large for any of us to physically remove her and even if we did drag her back to her car we can't physically force her to drive away.


We can't call the cops, we're all drinking and underage.


We can, however, remove the thing that she is really there for.


Kenneth must have had the same thought I did because at the same time we both jump up, start scooping up all the food and throwing it into the coolers with the rest of the beer.


Hamanda starts screeching at us but we packed it all into my car, a clamped out, crappy VW Beetle and I place the keys into the drivers side foot well and lock all the doors.


Kind inconvenient for me but I've got NRMA roadside assistance. I can just call in the morning and have them unlock my car for me. Or have one of my brothers bring me a spare key. 


The only part of my car now accessible is the front. (VW's have their engine in the boot) 


Hamanda: ""What the fuck did you do that for! I'm hungry!""


Kenneth: ""We already told you you aren't welcome here. Go away, Hamanda.""


Hamanda: ""You people are so fucking weird, no wonder no one likes you!""


To our surprise she didn't leave. Even after Kristin threw the remainder of her drink onto her.


I guess negative attention is still attention.


We all resolve to ignore Hamanda and at least try and salvage something of the night so as Kenneth and I return to our seats we start talking about Kirk.


Hamanda doesn't like the attention being taken away from her and so starts interrupting whoever is speaking and talking about herself.


Kenneth tried to tell us a story about how he and Kirk tried to skateboard off their roof. Hamanda jumped in to tell us that she and her best friend fell off the roof once too and she broke her back and its a miracle she can walk because of it.


After the 5th or 6th time of this happening I'd had enough. I can't attack this horrible whale or do anything that could lead to police involvement because, again, we're all underage and surrounded by liquor.


We have no doubt Hamanda will rat on us without a moments notice.


I start screaming at Hamanda about how she is a horrible person, won't live past the age of 40, is a fat fuck and so on. Hamanda just screams back and starts crying.


I've given her exactly what she wants.... she wants to be the center of attention and I am providing that in spades. I am now fuming. I get up to walk off my rage and suddenly remember.


There is a mega phone in one of our cars. Brad referee's netball on the weekends. His whistle, and mega phone are on the back seat.


I think we all know where this is going. 


I take the items and, walk up behind Hamanda and wait. The second she opens her maw to interrupt someone I lean over her and yell ""MOOOOOOOOOOO"" into the mega phone.


Hamanda lunges for me but is too fat to actually do anything other than kind of wobble in place. I back up a bit, not particularly worried. I can get 50 feet away before she can even haul herself to her feet.


For over an hour I keep it up. Every time she talks, I ""moo"" at her, right into her ear. 


Eventually, defeated and sobbing, Hamanda leaves to a chorus of us mooing and laughing at her.


Carl later said he thought blood had started to come out of one of her ears. I possibly permanently damaged her hearing.... I'm not even sorry.


TL:DR Hamanda attempts to ruin a memorial for a dead friend with her horrible, horrible behavior. We ruin her hearing. 

EDIT: Epilogue by request. Several years later Hamanda friended me on Facebook. I replied ""Moo"" and blocked her. "	t5_2vzax	True
1372514764.0	1hb6jf	[More sad than funny] My hamplanet sister is eating up my mothers early retirement	CanadianJesus	489	81	103	"Hello /r/fatpeoplestories . Long time reader, first time poster. This is not going to be a hilarious story riddled with fatlogic but a rather sad journey through the misery my sister is causing. I'm writing this both as a sort of therapy for me and as a warning of what can happen by enabling a self-destructive lifestyle. This is going to be a wall of text. I will be posting an abridged version in the comments.

I should say that everything in this post is true and revolves around the gravitational pull of my genetically half but size-wise full sister. I don't want to out her with her real name but she shall henceforth be known as BS, as it is a fitting initialism for both big sister and the bullshit she is spewing. 

Most of her skewed logic isn't truly fatlogic but something I would like to call I-don't-understand-simple-economics-or-how-to-run-a-household-logic or poorlogic for short. I'm still posting it here in /r/fatpeoplestories since if my sister happens to be a redditor, it is very unlikely she subscribes to this subreddit. If you're american, bring out your conversion tables and slide ruler as all measurements will conform to the superior metric system.

I should start by introducing my family, as most of these stories are about how my adult sister is mooching of and using my parents.

My parents were born in post-war Sweden in a time were food rationing were still in place to working class parents who themselves had lived through the depression. They were taught to be frugal and how to make every penny count. They preferred to set up savings accounts for me and my sisters and paying off their mortgage instead of buying a new car every 3 years and going on far away vacations every summer. There was a big [credit crunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_banking_rescue) in Sweden when I was very young that further confirmed their distrust of borrowing money and lavish lifestyles.

Like I wrote earlier, BS is not my full sister. My mother divorced her deadbeat dad when she was young and met my dad a few years later. They had my other sister (OS) and me 8 and 10 years respectively after the birth of BS.

BS has always been fat, but why is a bit of a mystery. We ate more or less the same thing in the entire family and my other sister and me were never fat. Even though my mother has been overweight after three pregnancies and several diets that never fully stuck, she shielded us from harm by relatively healthy rules. Vegetables with every meal, soda was for birthdays and special occasions and candy only on Saturdays. Hell, there wasn't even a proper fast food restaurant in our town until I was eight or nine. 

I suspect my late maternal Grandmother had a great deal of responsibility when it came to fattening BS as a young child, as she helped out a lot when my mother was a single working parent. She always loved giving out baked goods and candy to us kids, but OS and I didn't spend as much time with her as BS did. My mother has said that she regretted not being harder on BS about her weight back when she still had influence over her. I suppose she didn't want to put one child on a diet and not the other two.

BS grew up from a fat child into a morbidly obese woman. As she left the nest she left what little healthy eating habits she had and started cultivating mass. By the time she got her degree she was weighing in at roughly 90 kg, which with her height of 1,65 m would put her at a BMI of roughly 33. Certainly not america-sized but definitely way too much. Keep in mind that this is a country where McDonald's was a novelty to most people well into the '90s. It was also around this time she picked up smoking as a healthy calorie-free snack.

As BS accumulated mass she also attracted her to-be husband Cokeman (CM), named after his drink of choice. When they met he was not as obese as her, but with his height of 1,90 m and body size I would estimate his weight to 110 kg. I should say these figures are based on memory and estimates and can be off by a bit. When he wasn't guzzling coke he was snacking, eating takeaway or his home-cooked meals. He did and does like to cook, but he doesn't seem to know that there are other ingredients than heavy cream, cheese, red meat and processed carbohydrates. When they started dating he was living on his own in a ""bachelor pad"" but entirely dependant on his mother. She would pay his bills with his salary and give him whatever there was left as an allowance. She also did his laundry and on several occasions his dishes.

After several years of dating and weight-gain BS got pregnant (I don't want to picture how) and they decided to buy a house. This is the part where BS started to become dependant on my parents for financial aid. They found a house they liked in a small town where houses are cheap and living expenses low (by Swedish measures) but due to a lack of savings they had to get a 100 % mortgage on the house. The bank wouldn't allow this so my parents and CM's parents each put in roughly  $7500 as encumbrance(I believe this is the proper term) on their own houses. BS and CM assured that they were good for the money and that they would pay off the top part of the mortgage in a few years, thus freeing their parents from financial responsibility. They both had full time jobs and should be able to live comfortably on the income they had. 

And so they did. As they moved into the house BS was gaining pregnancy weight as if she was pregnant with octuplets. By the time she was about to give birth she weighed close to 130 kg. This was just pregnancy weight, she assured us, that she would lose afterwards. She did actually quit smoking during the pregnancy so she seemed to be taking it somewhat seriously. 
 
After a birth complicated by her massive weight she gave birth to my niece. At her six-month check-up she was at a normal weight but soon after they started feeding her solid foods she started ballooning up. I don't think she was even a year old before CM started giving her coke. I know babies are supposed to have a bit of fat but a 2 year-old shouldn't have rolls on their arms. [This](http://wac.9ebf.edgecastcdn.net/809EBF/ec-origin.nyc.barstoolsports.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2010/08/fat2-385x640.jpg) is an approximation of what she looked like at age 2. This of course never concerned BS and CM since babies are supposed to be chubby. Never mind that their now six year old daughter weighs the same as two of her preschool classmates. 

BS never lost her much of her pregnancy weight but didn't seem to gain any for a while either. Not until she became pregnant with child number two, my nephew. Miraculously he somehow resisted the diet and looks more like [this] (http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/09/article-1219368-06B8D7A1000005DC-342_468x524.jpg) at the time.

BS was often calling my mother making short-term loans because something unexpected had happened, like the refrigerator broke down or they got a smaller tax refund than they had expected. They were now in their thirties and still living paycheck to paycheck. My mother was always too kind and granting these loans since BS tended to use her grandchildren as emotional leverage. My parents were perplexed as to how two adults, with jobs and the generous aids and tax breaks parents get in Sweden, were unable to emancipate themselves financially. They never had to buy much for the house, they didn't go abroad for holidays and they were both working or intermittently on parental leave (80 % of your normal salary).

The answer, of course, lay in their eating habits. I'm not kidding, they were eating their entire pay checks. I'm talking monstrous amounts of takeaway, pre-made meals , snacks and baked goods. Not to mention CM's several litres a day coke habit. While BS did quit smoking during her first pregnancy, she started as soon as she could afterwards. She repeated this performance for the second child. CM never saw a reason to quit either time, not even to support his wife.

While my parents thought it was bad enough that they couldn't afford to fix a broken fridge unexpectedly, they didn't know the full extent of the monetary black hole that was this family. Everything started to reveal itself this autumn as they were starting to have trouble paying their bills. The satellite TV was shut off and power was soon to come. My parents gave them a short term loan on the condition that they come clean with their economic prospects. Apparently they were not only eating their pay checks clean, they were also borrowing money from any creditor willing to lend. The only reason they came clean was that they had stopped paying off the loans they had and couldn't get any new ones. They refused to say in how much debt they were, but close to $50000 in credit card and pay-day-loans alone. My parents and CM's parents had to come with them to the bank to renegotiate the mortgage payments so that they were only paying interest. My parents are of course furious about this situation since they have put down their own money into this and they stand to lose it all if they default on their mortgage. 

During the spring they seemed to be doing quite well under the circumstances. They were now on welfare since CM got fired for being to lazy and they had put their house on the market since they can't afford to live there any more. They are also applying for something called debt sanitation in Sweden, which is basically a form of bankruptcy where you live on the absolute lowest passable standard of living for five years and the rest of your income is paid to your creditors (the government is paying rest of the money owed) . After these five years you walk away free of debt.

Of course money troubles is never good for a marriage so this is the time BS and CM decided they should get divorced. At first they agreed on separation when they could sell the house but after CM finding that BS had been unfaithful he more or less threw her out of the house.  She is now living at a friends house.

BS is now asking my parents to co-sign the lease on a flat for her since she's got a bad credit score. My parents are really tired of caring for this 34 year old teenager but they can't cut her out or their lives without missing out on the grandchildren. My father is recently retired and my mother was going to retire a year early but now she can't since she has to support BS. Never mind that she has been on sick leave several times for work-related stress and has to take sleeping pills every night in order to not lay awake worrying.

TL;DR: My hamplanet sister has put herself in a shitload of debt and expects my parents to clean up after her.

Epilogue: I have several fatpeoplestories to share about BS but since just the back story turned out be a monstrosity on its own they will have to come in a separate post.

1372051662.0	1gyaj6	[Series] Heat Haze Delirium: Tales of a Social Worker Part III	onikakushi	540	134	96	"“On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.” – Fight Club

While I cannot argue with this poignant analysis of the human condition, I do however propose a secondary clause with which to more fully flesh this concept out for our behemoth brethren.

“The survival rate for a person suffering from fat logic is derived by a figure of the calories consumed and is on a direct inverse proportion to the number of simultaneous sufferers they are in contact with at any given time.”

Now, I realize that in most circles the use of anecdotal evidence falls far below the standards set by the burden of proof—however, in the case of planetary bodies I believe we can all agree that a preponderance of evidence is more than sufficient for our purposes.

Thus, I will today spin you another yarn from my days as a job center intern that I believe will illustrate why I believe this amendment holds weight under scrutiny (although, with the size of the bodies involved, I doubt you would have to strain your eyes).

For those of us who are newcomers to the series or merely would like to once again regale themselves with the previous two installments, you can find part one [here](http://redd.it/1gthdi) and part two [here](http://redd.it/1gvxza). 

At any rate, the curtain raises a good year and a half into my internship. Over the course of my time at the center I had become rather familiar with not only the job and the often *interesting* clientele, but also with the various personalities of my fellow coworkers. 

Sadly, the dream that I would one day escape the horrors of cliques and lunchroom drama I was first exposed to in my youth had remained nothing more than just that—a pipe dream. For here in my office it was much the same as it had always been—the people were bigger and wore business casual but their behavior remained the same: dumb.

While I am most certainly guilty of allowing brief lapses of “Peter Pan Syndrome” in my life, I try for the most part to be a level-headed adult.

However, it seemed that for the rest of my cohorts in minimum wage job placement Neverland was their constant abode. Indeed, many times the lunchroom resembled something more akin to the Jungle Book than to the grimy concrete dungeon it was in reality.

Like any other social circle, regardless of its location, there will always be groups of people who need to be avoided if one hopes to maintain any shred of their sanity—at the job center however, this was everyone.

Truly, after the first few weeks of trial and error seating arrangements, I came to the stark realization that if I meant to make it out of this internship in one piece, I must eat alone.

So eat alone I did—as mentioned in the previous chapter, my makeshift ‘office’ became a bastion of hope and tranquility. Within its perfectly whitewashed concrete block walls I found a peace the likes of which I had never appreciated before. Where others saw a cramped poorly-lit room, I saw a blossoming Eden which offered me protection and parlay from the waves of insanity outside its confines. 

Nirvana, thy name is utility closet.

For many a cheeseburger did I slowly munch away the delicious minutes of solitude in my concrete cubicle—all was right with the world.

That was of course until the air conditioner broke.

As though Eve herself had been tricked once more into eating the forbidden fruit, I was cast from my concrete garden into the barren wasteland of the lunchroom. 

Not even my car which sat dutifully in the parking lot patiently awaiting my rump to grace its leather seats could spare me from the hell which had befallen me. Due to my status as a struggling university student on a strict budget, I could not afford to go out to eat for lunch most days—and I was thus left with no choice in the matter.

I would have to eat in the lunchroom.

This stark reality hit me harder than the sugar rush you get the first time you drink a Mountain Dew—and as I slowly made my way to the employee eatery my shaking hands only acted to complete the metaphor.

As I briskly seated myself in the furthest corner of the room, like a civil war minute-man staring into a wall of soldiers he soon would charge into I surveyed my surroundings.

The room in and of itself was not notably horrid in any way—in fact I would go so far as to say that in the absence of people it would be a suitable place to eat. However, as the Grateful Dead so dutifully noted, “everything has a touch of grey.” And while it remained the only eating space with windows that opened in the building, it still left much to be desired.

See, this lunchroom didn’t merely service those who directly worked with me up front in the job center—oh no, it accommodated **every** worker in the building. Most notably, the small platoon of burgeoning berthas which made up the phone staff and various secretaries made up a good 70% of the ‘regulars.’

As anyone who has worked in an office complex will likely attest, there is no singular group of people in such a place who are louder, bring more drama, and are larger than the secretaries and phone operators. Their rotund rears and blistering BMIs were already enough to drive even the hungriest of men to starvation, but their personalities would have been banned in the Geneva Convention.

In my first few weeks at the office, I mentioned that I had attempted to brave the lunchroom—the Berthas (as they will be referred to from now on) were the reason I had left. Their constant chatter of the newest cubicle drama, that new fad diet, and of course who had gotten ‘fat’ were all just appetizers to their main course: groupthink.

I can only assume that as new secretaries are hired, they are slowly molded by the berthas until they too are an utterly delusional landwhale in plus sized women’s clothing.

Each more deluded then the last—while more than happy to sop up the newest juicy details like a fresh bun sops up mustard of how their bosses had ‘let themselves go,’ would seamlessly transition to how each of them was looking ‘thinner and sexier’ than the day before.

Their sheer bitchiness and undeserved narcissism had disgusted me to the point where I would wear headphones during eating—not necessarily the best option, but better than the Bertha’s banter by a long shot.

In the wake of the air conditioner malfunction the lunchroom had taken on a new feel—that of a refugee camp. All the displaced prisoners of hot air had relocated themselves to the area for a breath of fresh air.

Needless to say, as the lions in the Serengeti fiercely protect their watering hole, these real life hungry hippos were not keen on sharing their space with the ‘intruders.’

Of the 20 or so women (I use that term loosely) who made up the Berthas, their social order was clearly dominated by their leader—Rotund Rachel and her orbiting moon Planetary Patricia. These two were hambeasts of the highest order—true apex predators in their ecosystem. The rest of the Berthas were quick to fall into a lockstep whenever either even was so much as to clear their throat.

While Planetary Patricia and most of the remaining cursory members of the Berthas fit well into a category of hamplanetry—they paled in comparison to Rotund Rachel. Indeed, Rotundra (as she will now be referred to as) was a class all her own. Her name was not only derived as merely an alliteration to her name, but as a reference to the fact that she was much wider than tall. At a meager 5’0’’ Rotundra’s midsection seemed to bend space and time within its many rolls and layers. It seemed as though her body was in a constant state of combat with itself, with each feature attempting to distort itself further from the norm in an effort to be noticeable—this was aided in no way by her severe overuse of makeup. The Bertha’s clown-like war-paint was a point of constant ‘one up-ery’ within their pack, and Rotunda spared no expense in donning the suit of her ancestors. 

To only further complicate Rotundra’s myriad of problems, as mentioned above, the Bertha’s customary ritual involved complimenting their proud leader at all times—without question. Thus, the only thing in the room that approached Rotundra’s massive size was her completely undeserved ego and pride—a dangerous combination, to say the least.

During my tenure at the office, I had heard through word of mouth that Rotundra already suffered from a slew of medical issues related to her weight. These conditions and ailments ranged from the obligatory sleep apnea, to the beetus and all the way to 2 (**two**) heart attacks. The second of these had been nearly fatal and had necessitated a three week hospital stay and a continued medication regiment to keep her heart in check.

However, as per Bertha by-laws—nobody could say a damn thing about it. Even as she stuffed countless cholesterol packed death traps and chewed her way each day towards and early grave, the Berthas showered her with nothing but compliments on her ‘slim figure.’

So when it came down to the issue of the intruders in their territory, it only followed that Rotundra would lead the charge to vanquish the newcomers attempting to get a breath of fresh air at *their* lunchroom.

Over the next few days I began to notice a dwindling number of my comrades showing up for lunch. It made no sense however as the AC was still nowhere near fixed, and temperatures in most of the building were spiking at around 85F+. I knew something must be up, and luckily the Bertha’s triumphant whale song echoed across the room to my ears.

“I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT ROTUNDRA!” shouted one of the Berthas.

“YEAH, BLACK MAILING THOSE IDIOTS IN I.T. WAS A GREAT IDEA, WE GOT OUR SPACE BACK NOW!” another chimed in.

“TEEHEEHE, I’M THE BEST—I KNOW, ONLY A FEW ARE LEFT NOW, BUT I GOTS A PLAN DON’T WORRY,” I heard Rotundra spit out along with her half eaten brownie.

The shrieking blubber butts continued their victory cheers with another wave of compliments for their lard-soaked leader, “OH YOU LOOK SO GOOD TODAY TOO ROTUNDRA, TALK ABOUT KICKING ASS IN YOUR HIGH HEELS!”

Rotundra basked in her undeserved glory and shook the table with her massive guttural laughs and sickening attempts at modesty. 

To the audience, this is the point in the story where I wish I could convey my acts of bravery and wit in the face of fat oppression—but sadly I did not have the testicular fortitude required to stand up to an entire pack of wild orcas during feeding.

However, the following Friday temperatures had spiked to the low 90s and everyone was dealing with it poorly—even the most civil coworkers had become spiteful, and the Berthas were a sight to behold (not that anyone could possibly pick any of them up though). 

Their overworked sweat glands feverishly tried to flood their bodies with cooling, but were failing miserably. Their clown paint was slowly melting down their faces as if they themselves were becoming pieces of Picasso’s finest works, but nevertheless they chowed down in perfect form.

Only a few members of the office refugees still remained dedicated to eating their lunch in a somewhat cool(er) space, as the rest had been chased off in one manner or another by Rotundra and her gang. The three of us sat in silence at the one table that the Berthas had not claimed and quickly attempted to chow down as quickly as possible so as to escape this proverbial porky purgatory, but we had no such luck.

The heat was getting to Rotundra, and she wanted us gone—now. She walked (hovered, as her legs were not visible under her stomach) over to us and immediately demanded that we leave.

“YOU GUYS AREN’T WELCOME HERE, IT’S TOO HOT SINCE YOU GUYS ARE TAKING UP ALL THE COOL AIR FROM THAT WINDOW,” she bellowed while slamming her flippers unceremoniously upon the table.

Tom from the tech department replied in my stead, “shut up you fat heifer, can’t you see we’re eating—and there are 6 windows and 20 or so of you, do the math.”

Obviously shocked at his snappy response Rotunda proceeded to slam the table a few more times and scream at him, “THIS IS MY LUNCH ROOM, DON’T MAKE US MAKE YOU LEAVE!”

“Try me,” he growled, “I doubt your udders would allow you keep up with me though.”

As she readied herself for a full frontal assault on our foodstuffs and perhaps Tom himself, she suddenly fell backwards and gripped her chest while gasping for breath.

No way.

As she flailed around on the ground in true beached whale fashion, the Berthas slowly realized this was not a strategic move—something was wrong.

As fast as their kankles would allow them to travel, the Berthas rushed to Rotundra’s side, screaming for someone to call 911.

Rotundra was pronounced dead by the time the EMS medics made it down to the lunchroom—cause of death, you guessed it…a heart attack caused by extreme high cholesterol. 

Following Rotundra’s death, word spread quickly that she had not been taking her medications regularly—supposedly due in large part to the Bertha’s constant reaffirming that she was the picture of health.

In her wake, Planetary Patricia was quick to fill the sizable gap left behind by Rotundra and acted as the new leader of the Bertha’s until the day I left my post around a year later.

In closing, as I stated at the outset of this story—a person suffering from fatlogic has a greatly decreased life expectancy based upon the number of other fatlogic sufferers surrounding him or her.

**TL;DR – A pack of orcas attempt to maintain apex predator status in a concrete fish tank. Their leader pays the ultimate price for her status as queen beetus and her pack continues post-mortem.**

I had many stories about Miss Piggy.  I'll skip most as they have to do with laziness instead of fat people thought processes.

So, we're all poor.  And she talks me into going in on a pizza special with her - Little Ceasars or some other cardboard kind of cheap pizza - basically, we each got two large pizzas with our carefully counted out pennies.

I'm thinking - ""Yeah!  Now I eat for three days, woot!"" I eat one piece, and I head over to my boyfriends, and bring him a piece, too, since he's in the midst of finals, and I know he's hungry.

The next morning, it has snowed!  Glorious, glorious snow that I still haven't gotten tired of.  I pull open the shades... and there are four used pizza boxes thrown outside the window.

Eyes narrow.  Thoughts slowly percolate.  I head to the fridge.  Indeed, no pizza inside fridge.  Snow joy forgotten!  Lizard brain awakened!  Miss Piggy awakened next, even though she likes to sleep in till afternoon.

She told me, yeah, I threw the boxes outside because I thought you wouldn't notice the pizza was gone if the box was gone.

I would like to take the opportunity to point out here that the dumpsters outside of the apartment complex were literally less than a two minute walk from our front door.  I suppose that might be an option for some, but not when there are these handy windows right by the couch, right?

Anyhow, detente is reached when she agrees to buy more pizza.  I come home from classes to find that she got the same deal - 4 large pizzas.  She has already eaten hers.  AND three slices from mine.  I look up, and without me saying a word, she defensively spouts - ""I know you already ate three pieces, so I didn't have to pay you back for those!""

I simply nod, and take the boxes over to my boyfriend's place, and store temptation in his fridge."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;A: ""I told you no. Plus, it's almost time for Strange_Bedfellow's break. Maybe if you actually do some work instead of scaring away the clientele, you can go when he comes back.""

&gt;[mfw](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dis-gun-be-gud.gif) I'm convinced Turboham is about to eat Annie

&gt;TH: ""But I have a condition and need to eat NOOOOOOW. My doctor says I need to eat if I feel dizzy and ohgodyouwantmetopassoutbecauseyouhatemebecauseimbigbonedan...""

&gt;Turboham trails off

&gt;She's hyperventilating

&gt;Full on panic attack because she has gone almost 2 hours without feeding

&gt;[mfw](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Joseph-Gordon-Levitt-Clapping.gif) Turboham actually starts to cry

&gt;No

&gt;This isn't crying

&gt;It's like somebody has been stabbed

&gt;She is straight up wailing and screaming

&gt;Now sitting on the floor

&gt;Still throwing a full-on temper tantrum

&gt;Sweet Jesus I'm glad there aren't any customers right now

&gt;Annie looks dumbfounded

&gt;We lock eyes

&gt;A: ""I can't deal with this shit. Strange_Bedfellow, try not to burn this place down for the next few minutes""

&gt;Annie staggers to the back, unsure of her footing

&gt;I don't know what to do

&gt;This blob is wailing on the floor

&gt;Still trying to speak words

&gt;Can't discern anything besides ""don't care about me"" and ""so hungry"".

&gt;Self-immolation seems like my best course of action

&gt;No gasoline nearby

&gt;fuck.

&gt;Go to the backroom after Annie

&gt;Maybe we have something flammable there

&gt;Oh, we do. But it's even better

&gt;Get into back room

&gt;See Annie at her desk

&gt;Shot glass in one hand, twosix of Crown Royal in the other

&gt;Eyes lock again

&gt;weseensomeshit.blimp

&gt;Annie rummages in desk drawer for a second

&gt;Puts a second shot glass next to the first

&gt;I love Annie

&gt;Both down a bit of liquid courage

&gt;[mfw](http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/2010/05/14/comeon.gif)

&gt;Go out to main store

&gt;It's empty

&gt;What the bouncing fuck

&gt;Turboham should be here

&gt;She didn't...

&gt;Look out door

&gt;She did.

&gt;See Turboham ""running"" down the mall towards the food court

&gt;By running we mean shuffling at a normal walking pace, but expending considerable effort doing so

&gt;A: ""I don't get paid enough for this shit.""

***

&gt;Turboham comes back 20 minutes later, with a stuffed bag of A&amp;W and a root beer float

&gt;She's super out of breath

&gt;Probably ""ran"" back too

&gt;Annie doesn't waste a second

&gt;A: ""Are you fucking kidding me?""

&gt;TH: ""I told *huff puff* you I was *huff* gonna pass *puff* out.""

&gt;A: Well if you keep running like that, you're going to give yourself a heart attack.""

&gt;TH: ""I'll have you know I'm in great shape.""

&gt;Technically true

&gt;Round is a shape

&gt;But seriously, my sides

&gt;She waddles indignantly off to the back to hoover up some grub

&gt;A: ""As soon as she's done back there, we're going to need another drink."" 


Turboham ended up getting written up for this, but the District Manager (DM) didn't really believe the account. He decided to come in one day as a ""customer"" and see the antics for himself.

That, however, is a story for another time.

1375285383.0	1jfde8	Ares vs Mother and Sister Hambulas Part II	PraytoAres	500	94	87	"[Part I]( http://redd.it/1jcr04) [Part III](http://redd.it/1ji8yb)

From where we last left off, mother told Eris and I that we needed to bond. Eris invited me to hang out with her and her friends. I did not want to be seen in public with her but I wasn’t going to watch ‘Blondes on Blacks’ with her or watch reruns of Big Bang Theory at home, so I agreed to it.

&gt;Eris’s friend Britney arrive (White kind of chubby but cute) 

&gt;her friend Nekane arrives (Asian skinny anime type)

&gt;I go down to greet them, they say hi but they are just staring at the ground
Okay so they are a bit shy, we go upstairs to Eris’s room and it become obvious that Eris is the one with the highest testosterone in her group. She continuously bosses them around, and tries ‘flaunting me in front of them’ to assert her dominance. 

&gt;Doorbell rings, Eris looks outside and see’s the UPS truck

&gt;And with the fervor of a thousand suns, Eris sprints to get the door

&gt;She comes upstairs holding a package and is ecstatic

&gt;Me: Eris what you get?

&gt;Eris: Oh my fucking god someone gets me a knife, help me open this thing

&gt;We open it up, turns out its [Dr.Oz coffee extract pills]( http://i.imgur.com/5NEbmkP.jpg)

&gt;Eris: Finally I’ll be able to be lose weight

&gt;Eris proceeds to lecture us how great the pills 

&gt;Shows us the Dr. Oz clip

&gt;And if anyone was skeptical of the product she would reply ”Its PROVEN BY SCIENCE” 

&gt;Eris: I am so excited soon I won’t be able to fit into these clothes anymore lets go shopping!!

&gt;None of her friends had the courage to tell her it was a bad idea, and I was waiting to see her fail.

&gt;We all go to the mall in Britney’s car 

&gt;We go into Abercrombie and Fitch

&gt;Eris: I love these jeans they are going to look so good on me.

&gt;Eris goes to try them on its obvious they aren’t going to fit

&gt;Me Britney and Nekane exchange looks we all have a big smile on our faces

&gt;Eris walks out of the fitting room... her entire gut is spilling over the jeans

I look at the jeans I am no psychologist but I could tell they were in duress

&gt;Jeans: Ares… kill me

&gt;I shed a tear, and I whisper to the jeans, “Your agony will end soon.” 

&gt;Eris I know they are a little tight, but don’t worry in a week I’ll fit them perfectly 

&gt;Me: Eris how’d you button them?

&gt;Eris: no ha-ha I just have my belt around them for now

&gt;Eris proceeds to look for more apparel but people are giving us dirty looks so I tell her we should go 
somewhere else

&gt;We continue shopping around and Eris continues to buy more clothes for when she is skinny. 

&gt;In total I’d say she spent ~$400 but it was out of necessity… soon she will be ‘too small’ for her clothes.

&gt;The entire time we are hanging out I have formed a friendship with Nekane and Britney simply from the looks we would exchange while watching Eris be a gluttonous idiot

&gt;Eris starts to realize that I am friends with them, starts to get mad..

&gt;When return home this time Eris protests to sit in the back next to me

&gt;Eris: hey Ares don’t you think I looked sexy in that t-shirt [Artist Depiction of how her arms looked like 
in that shirt]( http://i.imgur.com/zDdkz4j.jpg)

&gt;Awkward silence erupts no one says anything for the rest of the car ride

&gt;Eris: Mom!! The pills came in!!

&gt;Mom: good for you honey mine are on their way as well, but hey since you are taking them you don’t 
have to starve yourself anymore

&gt;WAAAAAAAAAAAT Bitch has already been eating 5000 Calories + a day..

&gt;Mom: I will make you something special just don’t forget to stop taking your pills

&gt;Eris runs upstairs to put away her new clothes, me Britney and Nekane go downstairs to talk. We all laugh at how stupid Eris is going to feel when Eris can’t fit into her current clothes because she doesn’t  to  have to ‘starve herself anymore.’

&gt;Nekane and I  were sitting on the sofa and Britney was sitting on my lap. (It was nothing sexual there simply wasn’t enough room on the sofa)

&gt;Eris comes downstairs

&gt;Eris: hey Britney can you go be a slut somewhere else? Get off my brother do you have no fucking shame?

&gt;Britney goes and sits on the carpet… then Miss HeartAttackBeforeTheAgeOf30 jumps onto my lap (not hard)
I pushed her off before she could cut off blood flow to the rest of my body

&gt;Nekane: you just yelled at Britney for sitting on Ares’ lap why are you trying to sit on his lap; for god sake’s he is your brother

&gt;Eris: look we used to take baths together (yeah when we were 3) we are just that close

&gt;Eris: We also share a bedroom

&gt;Things get awkward, I get off the sofa and sit next to Britney, and Eris is obviously pissed off

&gt;Mom calls up for dinner…..

&gt;What is this?

&gt;Mom: come on guys I made a chicken pot pie!

I inspect the pot pie, holy shit this creation looks like it came from a knock off version of [Epic Meal Time]( http://i.imgur.com/z4YFurI.jpg). It appears as if mom just put together the highest calorie density foods in the land into a pie crust and popped it in the oven. The pie has chicken, pasta sides, rice, butter, oil, and pieces of bacon. Nekane, Britney, and I just take small portions, and leave while momma bear and sister bear eat like there is no tomorrow. 

&gt;Eris: finally I can eat without having to deny myself what I really want

&gt;Me: yeah Dr. Oz pills work it’s proven by science

&gt;Nekane: Yeah you can eat whatever you want and still lose weight, I heard it uses ions 

&gt;Britney: Its really good but dieting companies say it doesn’t work because they want people to buy 
their diets that don’t work so they can get more money

&gt;Eris and mom are too stupid to realize we are mocking them.

&gt;Britney and Nekane leave shortly after we finish dinner.

&gt;First time hanging out Eris’ friends like me more than her [yeah-buddy]( http://i.imgur.com/PEwcaNK.gif)


&gt;Later that night, we don’t have our night time salad, because you know Eris got her coffee extract pills, instead mom and Eris go out to Baskin Robins for ice-cream…

&gt;They arrive home

&gt;Eris: hey Ares we brought you something to eat as well 

&gt;I look yes!! Oreo ice-cream cake my favorite

&gt;Mom: let’s have some now

&gt;I get a slice… A SLICE…and the Ham-nebulas consume the rest of the cake..

Holy shit these coffee extract pills better be working, at least increase her metabolism by %5000.

&gt;Eventually go to bed, skyping with Britney on my laptop

&gt;Eris comes into the room

&gt;Quickly mute my laptop, at this point Britney can hear me, but I can’t hear Britney

&gt;I look at Eris oh god… she is getting bolder and bolder… she is walking around in her underwear 

&gt;She is just so excited to show off her very soon to be bikini body..

&gt; The Mighty Oz and wondrous coffee pills have given the Devourer unbelievable confidence

&gt;I don’t make eye contact

&gt;Eris: hey, I don’t like you getting too close to Britney

&gt;Me: we are just friends

&gt;Eris: thing is she already has a boyfriend and he is a really nice guy, you don’t want to be a home 
wrecker

&gt; I see Britney’s face through Skype she is laughing her ass off.. Fatso is jealous of me and Britney.

&gt;Eris: On top of that she only likes black guys.
Coming from my sister… Yeah okay

&gt;I look at Britney again she is erupting with laughter, 

&gt;Me: Good night Eris.

&gt;Eris: look I am just telling you because you are my little brother and I care about you.

&gt;And again later that night Eris watches her hentai shit, or Asian shit I can’t tell. All I know is there are Japanese girls yelling/moaning. 

&gt;I fall asleep.

**The End**




**TLDR** 

Eris gets pills which she believes will make her lose weight, so in preparation she goes to buy clothes she will fit into in the future. I go to hang out with Eris and her friends, instantly they like me more than her.

1373043309.0	1hp6ew	How a hamplanet destroyed my first housewarming gift.	ZeframCochrane-	506	102	86	"I've been lurking and commenting here for quite awhile for lack of an actual story to share with the community.

Last night as I was sippin' an Arnold Palmer iced tea loaded with Svedka, this one story in particular hit me like a ton of bricks. I cannot believe I had forgotten about this.

This is a torrid tale of a hamplanet destroying the very first house warming gift I've ever gotten for my first apartment, the names will be changed to protect myself, not like I give a shit about some hamplanet finding out I'm talking shit, but this also kind of involves dishing a friend of mine that was involved.

At 20 years old, I managed to finally land a really nice apartment with two friends, Esteban and Laroux. We had a sweet two bedroom apartment that I had been living in with my parents since I was a spry 10 year old. My parents bought a home and I cut a deal with the land-lizzard to take over the rent payments and continue living there.

Laroux was my g/f at the time of this story, Esteban was someone I knew for quite awhile, he's a pretty good guy, he just has a thing for dating and fucking hamplanets.

Esteban's girlfriend at the time was of course a 350lb behemoth with your typical excuses ""I have a condition, I can't help the way I am"" blahblahblahblahblah.

One of the first encounters with her, I cut a deal with her for a car stereo, to clean out her ham-mobile as she was obtaining a new ham-mobile from the stealership a week later. I always noticed she was NEVER EVER caught without her McBeetus EVER. Always with 2 or 3 BigMac's and the most fuck-huge Liquid Beetus cups McBeetus had to offer. 

The deal for the stereo was I would detail the interior of her car, she would give me the stereo for my car so I wouldn't have to spend cash on something new for myself. I should've known what I was getting into. 

Now usually, your average detailing, is a whole heck of a lot of wiping down and vaccuming. I usually move seats to get underneath them and I can usually get one done in about an hour or so depending on how fast I hustle.

NOT THIS CAR. There was ketchup and BBQ sauce from McBeetus literally SMASHED into the carpeting in the back seats. Plastic container and all. Fries? Fries EVERYWHERE. Under the seats, between the brackets and the hump for the drive-shaft of the car. The whole car smelled like a bag of smashed assholes and took me about 3 and a half hours to finish. Not to mention the removal of her front seats and a whole ton of Oxy-Clean to get the carpeting clean. Job done, I got my stereo.

A few weeks later, we began moving Laroux and Esteban into the apartment. My buddy LJ being the besticles of friendsicles that he is to me grabbed me a used sleeper couch he had in his garage, I was so appreciative to have this couch because it gave us a sitting space in the common area that we didn't have before, plus it was a sleeper, so if someone needed to stay because they were too wastey-pants they could sleep over, no harm, no foul.

Esteban and his BeetusQueen show up and get to moving things in, which was really Esteban and I moving his shit in because BeetusQueen was too lazy to lift much of anything except for fist fulls of fries into her gaping maw. 

Never the less, we get finished up quickly enough to enjoy a bong rip or two on the couch before bed, BeetusQueen, LJ, Esteban and I all took bong hits while the BeetusQueen shoveled her BigMacs into her endless cocksucker that adorns her rotund fat-face. 

So, we're all hanging out, having a laugh and a good time and thats when we hear the most AWFUL noise coming from somewhere in the room. 

I had lived there since I was 10, I was familiar with every creek and crack that house made. I'd NEVER heard the house make such a noise before. LJ and I exchanged a look trying to figure it out and dismissed it as just a new noise for the house, maybe there was a bad valve on a water line somewhere? Who knew?

Later on that night LJ and I were good and baked, we decided to pull the fold out bed from the couch, set up the TV and settle into the first Michael Keaton Batman.

As we were laying on the fold-out, trying to get comfortable, he and I noticed something about the fold out. There was a giant dip in the mattress, like laying half-way out of a hole or something, we stopped the movie, pulled the mattress up and looked at the frame.

That's when we noticed one of the support bars. BENT TO SHIT, not just a little bent but as if some gorilla put hands on it and bent it into a U-shape. He and I both looked at each other at the same precise moment and that's when it hit us. 

That hamplanet had bent the support just by sitting on it. That's where the mysterious noise came from. It was the sound of my very first and most treasured house warming gift committing suicide. 

We decided not to say anything, it just wasn't worth it. We never pulled the mattress out again. We took a hit from a worthless hamplanet and sucked it down.

Later on, her and Esteban broke up. He started dating an even bigger, uglier hamplanet. 

One night as we were getting stoned, I manned up and asked Esteban what his deal was with the hamplanetry.

He simply says to me ""I dunno man, I just like 'em that way"" I respected him enough to simply say. ""Fair enough Esteban, fair enough"" "	t5_2vzax	True

I still hang out with PM because she is actually really pleasant without the distraction of Kirby around. And we try to shy away from the subject so we have pleasant visits

Enter Cafe and Grille, the new restaurant that has just opened and provided me with another Kirby story.

&gt;be me

&gt;going on a date with dat husband

&gt;we go to lunch one day because he is working from home

&gt;decide on new Cafe and Grille because it is so good and the prices are reasonable

&gt;decide to take Hostess up on offer to sit outside on deck because of beautiful day and cool breeze

&gt;datsummerbreeze.exe

&gt;we are seated around the corner, caddy cornered to the beautiful fountain they have out on the deck

&gt;we order drinks and food and are waiting for our salads when we hear it

&gt;KIRBY CHAAAAAAASERRR, I WANNA SIT OUTSIIIIIDDDEEE

&gt;no, fuck fuck fuck, no, not her, it's beautiful and I'm enjoying a peaceful lunch with my husband, please not her

&gt;i think she has seen us when the hostess brings her and kirby chaser out but she hasnt

&gt;the corners of the building have glass walls so you can see through to the other side of the deck

&gt;they get seated at a table around the corner where we can see them, but because of the way the sun was shining, you couldnt see us from that side unless you really tried

&gt;when she steps under the shade of the umbrella on the table, I can really see her

&gt;she has bleached her hair underneath and her bangs are stripes of pink and purple

&gt;consider changing her name to My Little Kirby because she looks like a mix between a heavily bloated My Little Pony and an Oversized Kirby

&gt;she's gained at least 20 lbs since I saw her last

&gt;she's so loud, we can hear her over the large splash of the fountain

&gt;[mfw] (http://imgur.com/gallery/1dHXOOR) she starts complaining right away 

&gt;""DIS NOT ENOUGH COOOKE, YOU GOT BIGGAR GLASSES? NO? THEN GIMMIE TWO MOAR""

&gt;her....boyfriend.....asks for 2 more as well

&gt;waitress asks what kind of dressing they want with their salad

&gt;OHHH KIRBY CHASER, WE ARE SOOO GOOD, WE ARE EATING SALAD!!

&gt;both order extra cheese, croutons, bacon, and send the waitress back for more ranch and thousand island (not kidding, she had 1000 island, he had ranch)

&gt;we try to ignore them, but Kirby is so loud that you just can't

&gt;Kirby pipes up midway through her salad and out of nowhere we hear ""EWWW how can people EAT THAT on a salad, I heard that stuff MAKES YER BUTT LEAK""

&gt;WAT o.O

&gt;cut my eyes to the woman she is referring to in the restaurant

&gt;woman has side salad and the waitress had just sat the oil and vinegar dressing caddy down on the table

&gt;my husband nearly chokes trying not to laugh loud enough where she can hear us

&gt;I'm trying not to spit my water everywhere and we are red faced laughing

&gt;""YEAH, KIRBY CHASER, I READ ONLINE THAT CANOLA OIL MAKES YER BUTT LEAK FLUID""

&gt;you have to be kidding, she thinks the olive oil is canola oil

&gt;me and hubby are cracking up so hard we cant control it at this point

&gt;""DATS PROLLY HOW DEM TWIGS STAY SO SKINNY, THEY LEAK AND BARF EVERYTHING THEY EAT""

&gt;waitress comes out with our food and we are just now able to compose ourselves

&gt;we keep busting out laughing through the entire meal (club sandwiches and broccoli casserole FTW)

&gt;She prattles on about video games through most of the meal

&gt;she and kirby chaser snarf down 3 bacon cheeseburgers (this place has huge burgers) and at least 3 orders of fries a piece

&gt;my husband said he counted 18 cokes including the 3 they had at the beginning

&gt;we both get bill about the same time

&gt;Kirby flips

&gt;she didn't realize that this place charges after the 2nd refill (I dunno why, it says it right there in bold letters on the menu and on the table's stand up menu, hard to miss, nevermind the fact the we heard the waiter tell them twice that they werent free)

&gt;thats 21 dollars in coke alone, 35 in burgers, and 12 dollars in extra sides= 68 dollars not including tax

&gt;i have to let it sink in once we did the math on their bill just how much they ate, husband and I had lunch including drinks and it was only $15 for both of us

&gt;kirby is yelling for a ""MAMAGER""

&gt;Nice man comes out and asks what he can help them with

&gt;Kirby screams that she wants the cokes taken off the bill and that if they werent she was suing the Cafe for discrimination by charging them for extra drinks because of their size

&gt;manager starts to tell her how it is clearly stated in multiple locations that everyone is charged for soft drinks and teas past the 2nd refill

&gt;""UH AM DIABETIC, YEW WANT ME TO SUE YOU FER DISRIMINATION TOWARDS A DIABETIC TOO? MAH BLOOD SUGAH COULD HAVE DROPPED AND PUT ME IN A COMA!"" (How I wish I was kidding......*facepalm*)

&gt;husband and I leave a tip and get up to walk out

&gt;have to walk past their table to get to the door

&gt;Manager wasnt as alpha as the other one and decides to just comp the drinks and half their bill

&gt;We start to walk out when the manager starts to head off, she locks eyes with me

&gt;""HAAAAIII LEADFOOT-""

&gt;""please do not even think about talking to me Kirby, have a good day, bye.""

&gt;her maw is hanging open

&gt;""FINE YER NOT INVITED TO MAH WEDDING TO KIRBY CHASER!!!!""

&gt;I am literally shocked that someone is marrying that woman

&gt;I turn and say ""fine with me, have a great life (sarcastically)""

&gt;she starts shouting about how I'm just jealous that shes happy and that I'm probably horrible in bed and wont keep my husband very long

&gt;I want to say something but husband says to ignore her, that he has a plan

&gt;He walks up to the manager and hands him a card and whispers something to him

&gt;I look at him confused as we walk out and get into the car

&gt;we pass the deck on the way out of the parking lot and my husband flips them the bird with a huge grin

&gt;I ask him what the heck is going on when he stops and squints his eyes through the entrance doors

&gt;manager is on the phone, husband is laughing, and I'm confused

&gt;he tells me after we start to pull off that the friend of ours that knew the other manager the first time we went out with Kirby, got some of that managers business cards and gave all the bros one so they could get wing discounts during games in the bar

&gt;he had handed one to the manager and told him to call the manager at the other restaurant to verify that Kirby pulls this crap all the time

&gt;JUSTIIIICCCEEE

&gt;my husband rocks

&gt;I cannot stand Kirby

1371656308.0	1gnseo	Fat Logic at Blockbuster	JKatsopolis	487	82	70	"I came across this sub recently and after quenching my beetus I felt like I should try to return the favor. Sorry, I’m not really sure how to do the green-text or gifs.

This story took place a few years back. I was 21, 5'10"", 160 lb former gymmnast. Not in the shape I once was, but still fairly fit. Was with my friend Nate, 22, 5'10"", 200 lb, also a former gymnast. Still has the muscle, but put on quite a bit of weight.

We were exceptionally bored one night, and to cure it, decided to do something you still could at that time, head to the local Blockbuster. As was custom, we were looking for what seemed like hours for an agreeable movie. Probably ended up being around 20 minutes. Somewhere in that span Nate had suggested the movie Norbit. I laughed and said, ""Nah man,"" thinking that movie looked terrible. 

We finally agreed on something, paid, and started to leave. As we exit the door, a truck speeds across the parking lot and comes to a screeching halt right in front of us. A man in the driver's seat (I'd estimate 40, 5'8"", 350 lbs), let's call him Wannabe Hamuel L. Jackson screams through the opened window, ""Who the fuck do you think you are?!""

Nate and I shoot a confused glance at each other. ""Yeah, you two skinny bitches! You think you can just do whatever you want?""

I respond, ""Sir, I'm not really sure what's happening here. Do we know you?""

Hamuel replies, ""No, but you two were in there harassing my wife."" We look over and see in the passenger seat a woman that had been in the store. She was about 5'5"", 250. Nate and I are really confused at this point. ""You were calling her Norbit!""

We put it together. In passing, she must have heard us talk about Norbit and assumed we were making fun of her. Nate tries to diffuse the situation, ""Sir, we were in the movie store and saw that movie. I'm sorry if that caused any misunderstandings.""

""Bullshit! She's been crying here for the last 10 minutes about how you were calling her a whale and disgusting."" 

At this point I'm starting to get frustrated. I can see how an unfortunate coincidence like this could hurt her feelings. But, at no point did we pay her any attention, let alone call her a whale or disgusting. ""Look, I'm sorry if we hurt her feelings, but it was an accident.”

“Why don’t you quit lyin’ about it and fess up?!”

“I don’t have time for this.”

""Yeah well what if I kick your asses?"" Hamuel starts to open his door. 

Alpha-mode Engage! I take a step toward his truck, ""If you get out of that truck, I will fucking end you."" We lock eyes and stare down for what seems like an eternity. My heart is pounding. I don't want to fight this guy over nothing. I try to communicate through stare that this is all a big misunderstanding but if you're going to start something, I'll finish it. 

He finally sits back in his seat and closes his door. I start to say, ""Now Im sorr-"" but I'm cut off. 

He shouts, ""If I ever see you faggots again I'll kick your asses,"" throws the truck into reverse, backs up, and peels out. Nate and I are left dumbfounded.

TL:DR Ham-beast in movie store overhears talk of Norbit. Makes up claims of harassment to her husband that harasses us with threats of violence and homophobic slurs.

He was about 6'6 and over 400 pounds of pure entertainment. He had a fondness for my chili, and would tend to help himself to it rather more than would be fair. We had a few arguments about it, and I laid down the law that he was not to eat ANY of it without asking. He continued to poach and hamburgle, so I began adding more hot sauce. He continued to poach, so I escalated the severity of the hot sauce every week. Eventually I got entirely sick of this, made a HUGE batch, and added most of a bottle of 'Z', an oily black concentrated extract of pure burning misery. I told him in no uncertain terms not to eat it. 

Not only did Landfill eat it, he ate the entire thing. Over a gallon and a half of chili. I was enraged. I ran to his room to confront him, and was assailed with the most miserable stench. What he did to the bathroom can only be described as a holocaust of feces. He recreated the Hungarian sludge disaster. There was feces and vomit in the back of the linen closet. The smell of feces and vomit was strongly scented with pure capsaicin. I open his door and there is a vast fetal heap laying on a orange-stained, flattened mattress. His eyes are crimson, a filth-soaked towel under his freely running mouth and nose. He weakly gestures towards a stack of money on his table. It was over twice what I paid for ingredients. He missed a week of work and never ate my food again.

I wasn't even mad.

1367009257.0	1d6edt	Eating Disorder	maumacd	457	58	78	"Background: I have a HUGE local family. Think like 40+ people actually come to family events. Usually about 70 are invited. Family events are like 4-5 times a year and friends are always welcome, because when you're cooking for 40, another person is NBD. 

&gt;So it's thanksgving

&gt;Larger crowd than usual, gotta take in all those who don't have family in the area

&gt;This year it's at Grandma T's

&gt;Grandma T's house is too small, lets actually rent a room at the local lodge.

&gt;Thanksgiving is Potluck because Grandma T is too old, living on pension, kitchen too small, etc.

&gt;Couple Hamplanet family members, all bring enough food to make up for amounts they eat

&gt;buffet has literally mountains of food

&gt;There is like 8 different types of Stuffing, a few are like 15x30"" pans heaped with delicious stuuuuffffffffiiiiiinnnng

&gt;Cousin Delilah brings Hamplanet boyfriend

&gt;Hammy is 5'6"" at least 350lbs age: between 15 and 18 (CD is 15)

&gt;CD and Hammy bring nothing to potluck

&gt;badmanners.familydispleased

&gt;Grandma S is Grandma T's sister

&gt;Grandma S lives out of state, To old, infirm to travel much.

&gt;Suprise! Grandma S comes to thanksgiving

&gt;Grandma T is tears so happy!

&gt;but wait, that's not all!

&gt;Grandma S recently found old recipe book of their mothers

&gt;Book includes recipe for stuffing

&gt;Neither has had this since mom died

&gt;Grandma S's daughter brings this stuffing out

&gt;Many weeps, heartstrings are tugged

&gt;People done reminiscing

&gt;time to eat

&gt;Elders go first.... 

&gt;ohno.whathappened

&gt;All of stuffing from ancient family recipe is gone

&gt;CD and Hammy snuck though and got food while people reminiscing

&gt;Hammy takes ENTIRE 8x8 pan of ancient family recipe stuffing

&gt;whatthefuck.areyouserious

&gt;Uncle Boss call out Hammy

&gt;You better explain yourself

&gt;Hammy's response

&gt;""I have an eating disorder - how dare you say that! I am a recovering anorexic""

&gt;areyou.fuckingkiddingme

&gt;room full of 60 people with jimmies at maximum rustle

&gt;Hammy claims we all want him to be anorexic like we all are

&gt;Cries

&gt;continues eating while family hurls insults

&gt;Hamplanet relatives furiously deny fatlogic

&gt;Hammy again insists he has an eating disorder

&gt;Uncle Boss takes plate from him, shatters it on the floor

&gt;only person ever to be banned from family functions

TL;DR Hammy eats ancient recipe when there is literally mountains of other food available, claims to have eating disorder, perma-banned

[Edit] Because people asked, here is the recipe:

1lb bread croutons - Herb bread - very dry (note added: Don't use sourdough)

1 cup butter

3/4 cup hot milk

5 stalks celery cut small

3 onions cut small (note added: Yellows)

1 can oyster meat (note added: 30 fresh better)

1tsp lemon

chicken bullion cube crushed

Pinch of salt

Pinch of pepper

Cook celery and onion in butter. Toss bread bits with milk - then add in cooked celery and onions. Then add oysters. Be careful mixing, add in everything else.

(its not written in the recipe book, but after this you put it in the turkey.)

You begged, you pleaded, and here it is! The finale of the Nugget Tales. Enjoy!

Again, we will skip forward, a few weeks this time. Emily is hobbling around like a trooper and we’re hoping that nightmare is behind us. Unfortunately, that nightmare was literally *behind* us. We’re astounded. There’s no *possible* way, after literally *attacking* a fellow student, that Nugget has been allowed to remain. We’ve been hanging out with Chris a lot less since he doesn’t seem to know whose side he’s on, but I text him asking why the hell Nugget is still here. He tells me that she’s been declared mentally unstable (*that* I can agree with) and that she’s been given some conditions for staying: she has to see a therapist. She can’t interact with me, Emily, or Devon. (Guess how long that lasts, dear reader.) She isn’t allowed back in the gym. (A great loss for her, I’m sure.) He then goes on to tell me the twisted logic behind the attack. It wasn’t just out of spite, if you can believe it. She figured that if Emily was injured, she wouldn’t be able to work out, and therefore would get fat. I would either have to ditch Emily, or admit that I liked fat girls all along, which obviously would mean I was pining after *her* all along. Too bad for Nugget, she wasn’t able to force-feed Emily the burritos, waffles, pasta, and chips Nugget consumed so voraciously, and so Emily remained the same weight despite her injury. She even lost a little weight because she had no appetite without exercising and was losing muscle mass. Chris then fucked things up royally by saying that we “were kind of asking for it” and that because we “knew how Nugget was” we should have “just left her alone”. Okay, Chris, it’s pretty obvious who you’re supporting in this debacle. Whatever.

So we have another few on-edge weeks. Every time Emily sees Nugget she freaks out. (Understandably.) We’re both worn thin and paranoid and it’s really starting to take a toll on us. I got switched into another English class, which required a bit of a schedule overhaul. Stress on stress on stress. Devon got some disciplinary action for beating on Nugget. They say she should have let security deal with it. Fuck that. We’re all tired and cranky and feel like Nugget has won. At this point I feel it’s important to mention that Nugget was an art major. I don’t really know the specifics, I think she focused mainly on painting but I recall some sculpture, too. The subjects of her works were without fail obese women, and were usually accompanied by a fucking *essay* on the wall next to them about how oppressed she was. I guess she might have been an okay artist, I’m a terrible judge of things like that and I hated her so much it didn’t matter. This is important because one day, as Devon (a design and merchandising major) walked into the arts building, which has a gallery space on the bottom floor, she was confronted by a four-foot-tall painting of my face. Puzzled but amused, she looked around the room for a clue as to why the hell there was a painting of me on display. Looking more closely, however, she was horrified. It was a single artist show, by… guess. Just guess. She took pictures and sent them to me in class, before I could get over there and see for myself. It was horrifying. Several pieces were of a nude female, anorexically thin with blonde hair, in provocative poses. The biggest piece was clearly me. There was an obese woman on a cross. Some abstract thing with shattered glass. All the others were weird abstract shit, but the artists description of the show was the biggest load of steaming shit yet. She talked about how she used art to help her heal and overcome trauma. Stuff about “objectification” of her body and “prejudice” of the “uneducated mind”. Just on and on. (I’ll see if I can find a copy for you guys. It was 100% rage-inducing.) I grabbed a brochure as evidence and headed out. Since we had a history with Nugget and she was already on their “watch list”, things went pretty smoothly. Emily’s parents got involved and proved that Nugget had caused her enough distress that it was affecting her schoolwork and social life. The art show was considered provocation, I guess, and she was kicked out pretty promptly. I’m not super clear on how her attack on Emily turned out (her parents handled most of that) but I think she has something in her official police file or whatever. You know, the one they see when they pull you over for speeding. Chris later told us how furious she was and that she went on a rampage about “censoring the arts”. What an absolute shitshow.

The story has a happy ending, though. Emily and I are approaching our six-month anniversary and are planning to get an apartment together with Devon and one other roommate (to be found… no hamplanets) next year. We haven’t heard from or about Nugget since she was expelled, just the way we like it. For all I care, she could be rotting in a ditch by the side of the road. I hope you have enjoyed this rollercoaster of emotion and that the ending was satisfactorily sugary for all you fatties. Stay strong, stay curvy. Until next time.

TL;DR: Fattie is given a restraining order. Passive-aggressively makes an entire fucking art show about the incident. Gets kicked out. Everyone lives happily ever after."	t5_2vzax	True

First time green texting, sorry if i mess it up, leadfoot is trying to teach me.

&gt;be 17

&gt;be a cart boy at walmart waiting to graduate from high school to go into the army

&gt;decided to work there because pushing carts actually kept me in shape

&gt;be getting off work one day

&gt;stop to talk to the door greeter, we will call him Sam

&gt;he's the coolest old guy I'd ever met so I'd usually talk with him for a minute after work

&gt;he's an army vet, was in 'Nam, had funny stories for me all the time

&gt;be talking about one of his awesome stories when a...i think y'all call them ""landplanets"" walks in

&gt;she was maybe 5'2"" and about 340-350lbs

&gt;she looked like she hadn't brushed her hair in weeks (I have noticed reading these stories that this is apparently common......why?!)

&gt;sweats and a wife beater tank top with a sports bra and flip flops on

&gt;stains on her clothes

&gt;she walks past us, straight into the mcdonalds that was in the store

&gt;she comes out with a bag of food and a huge drink

&gt;think she is leaving, but we see her wheezing towards the carts

&gt;she stops to answer a cell phone call

&gt;girl with a broken leg comes in on crutches, looks around for a scooter

&gt;see's one plugged into the wall, the guy with her walks ahead of her to go and get it for her

&gt;landplanet sees this and hangs up the phone, engages speed waddle

&gt;gets to the cart about the same time as the girls friend does

&gt;she sits all of her food and her drink in the basket, thus claiming the cart

&gt;girl on crutches just stands there awkwardly, because this whale just scurried over to claim the last cart, and she is on crutches

&gt;guy politely asks for it since friend is unable to get around very well, and needs it

&gt;whale responds ""I have hip problems and I can't walk very well!!""

&gt;Sam politely points out that she walked in just fine, walked to the mcdonalds just fine, and out to the cart just fine

&gt;whale plops down on cart and says...""well.....i get tired easily, so I have to have this, she can find something else..""

&gt;starts to scoot forward

&gt;girl with crutches looks around in shock, because there is ""nothing else"" to help her

&gt;whale puts cart in drive and hits the gas, nearly knocking into the girl with broken leg

&gt;snarls ""kids these days, NO RESPECT for their elders, ought to be ashamed.....""

&gt;she was maybe 30-35

&gt;Sam steps in front of her

&gt;scooter screeches to a hault as whale opens her mouth

&gt;Sam says ""ma'am, save it, this girl clearly needs this, you can walk just fine, i've seen you in here at least 3 times in the past week and you were in the store for at least a half hour each time walking just fine when we had no available carts...please get up""

&gt;whale says ""well, maybe if the store would order more, we wouldnt have this problem, would we???""

&gt;Sam says again ""get up, I'm your elder, I fought for your freedom and right to get off your ass and do something with your life, and did you not just say to ""resect your elders....?""""

&gt;whale is confused, her fat logic has been outsmarted

&gt;she swipes her food from the cart, and waddles back towards mcdonalds

&gt;turns around and snarls ""fucking fakers, I bet that cast isnt even REAL....."" and mumbles as she takes a seat in mcdonalds to eat

&gt;girl with broken legs thanks sam and gets on

&gt;me and sam watch as one of the regular customers who is also disabled approaches the doors and says hello

&gt;she scoops the remainder of her food up and stand in wait

&gt;as soon as regular customer is off the scooter, whale scurries over, plops her food down, and scoots off into walmart 


That's the only one I have really besides Kirby, but after reading the sub, i may have to try and think of more things that happened when I worked there. I was outside mostly, so I didn't get to see a lot of the shenanigans that went on inside very often. Thanks for reading :)

This FPS occurs a few weeks before Beetus moves out.

***

**Dramatis Persona**

Moi - at time, 5'8 and 150lbs.

St Spouse-a-tron - 6'0, 170lbs. Ex Ballet dancer. Patient as fuck.

Beetus - 6'4, at least 350lbs of misogynistic bastard and fatlogic.

***

Spouse-a-tron was up north visiting his family for whatever reason, so it was just me and Beetus in the house alone. Since I was working, I didn't normally see Beetus, which was fine by me.

&gt;Be my day off.

&gt;be having worked 50 hours in 5 days due to people calling in sick.

&gt;be tired as fuck.

&gt;be deciding it's PJ day

&gt;stay in bed hanging out.

After some time, nature calls, and I unwillingly get up to relieve myself in the loo. I open the door to find Beetus looming in the doorway with a sweaty sheen on his face.

&gt;[HFW](http://i.imgur.com/8YNjibF.gif) I open the door in my pj shorts and vest top.

&gt;[HFW](http://i.imgur.com/DxPHij0.gif) just before I open the door.

&gt;I expected nobody else in the house today.

&gt;Son, my hair ain't even brushed.

Can anyone say creepy? I have the door opened just a crack to prevent as much darkness as possible escaping my cave of recovery. He can't see into my room, I'm blocking the way. I can see the cogs turning in Beetus's brain as he realises I'm a) not wearing a bra, b) in front of him and c) I know he's there.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/nZZdD.gif) his nose is inches from where the door would have been.

**""Uh...uh... I didn't know you were home.""**

""I told you it was my day off, what the hell were you doing creeping in front of my door, Beetus?""

&gt;Beetus appears to have no response for this.

&gt;He slowly struggles with words

&gt;Beetus is obviously trying not to stare at my boobs.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/adkaE.gif) I realise what he's staring at.

&gt;Try to cover myself with arms as much as possible. 

&gt;Nearest blanket is too far away.

&gt;grossed out.exe

""Look, Beetus, I need a slash, mind getting away from my door?""

Beetus's mouth just sort of flops for a bit, as he's staring at me and finally reacts. **""I'm not blocking you, you can just go around me. This is my house too.""**

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/YUi6VR0.gif) ""Beetus, you are literally taking up the entire hallway.""

**""ARE YOU CALLING ME FAT? YOU CAN'T CALL ME THAT. I'VE GOT ASTHMA. IT'S A CONDITION. JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T EXERCISE LIKE YOU.""**

&gt;I have what is called Brittle asthma. My asthma is sporadic. Attacks may be fewer and farther between, but there are a defined set of triggers, and each attack is pretty much a guaranteed hospital trip in an ambulance with an oxygen mask an a high risk of getting intubated. Guaranteed to be at least 12 hours of hell, getting prodded with needles, sensors, xrays, ECGs and a nurse struggling to find the artery in my wrist and poking about with a needle which I can feel scraping around over bones, even though there's a great big ole sticker in my medical file that says I prefer elbow for blood as the artery is right up against the skin and much easier to find.

""Beetus, that's bullshit and you know it, just get out of the way.""

I push him out of the way and go to the bathroom, lock the door, do my thing and emerge a short time later. Beetus is still standing there looking creepy as hell. As I shut the door to my room, looking creeped out, he stops me putting his foot in the door.

**""I don't care if you are dating Spouse-a-tron, this is my house too and you're being awfully loud.""**

&gt;...wat

&gt;I give him a blank look.

**""Look, you need to stop having sex so loud, it's really putting everyone off. Just because you are in a relationship, doesn't mean you should hold it over everyone. I mean, I can hear *everything* through the wall.""**

&gt;wat

&gt;In my [head](http://i.imgur.com/ZCGy6g1.gif)

""What are you talking about Beetus?""

**""I've heard you all morning, And I'm just disgusted. I don't want to hear that on my day off.""**

&gt;Beetus goes to hide in his room.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/2t4M6Cd.gif) I've been watching Band of Brothers all morning, and porking out on pita chips and Irn Bru. Alone.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/U97Riuj.gif) two minutes later I realise there's heavy breathing, grunting and...noises...coming from Beetus's room.

&gt;MFW I realise he's masturbating.

**""THANKS FOR KEEPING IT DOWN""**

Grunting resumes.

***
Next morning, making pancakes for breakfast because fuck yeah. Beetus smells the delicious and just starts helping himself to pancakes before I realise what he's doing. In between bites of pancake, he manages to squawk out a few words.

**""Thanks OMNOMNOMNOM For OMGARGSNDBNOM keeping it down SNORKNOMSQUELCH BURP last night. I actually got some sleep, and didn't even hear Spouse-a-tron go to work this morning.""**

""Spouse-a-tron is up visiting his folks in The Village till Wednesay.""

&gt;Spouse-a-tron's tiny hometown is literally The Village. They give you yellow cloaks when you leave to protect you from the monsters.

&gt;That level of small town.

Beetus had apparently not realised this. I go back to making pancakes an realise Beetus is standing directly behind him, his gunt gently grazing my ass. I can't see his hands but something tells me if I don't do something I will know soon enough.

**""So we're finally alone...I seen how you been looking at me you slut, how could you do that to Spouse-a-tron?""**

&gt;All of my wat.

I whirl around with a red hot frying pan and a spatula covered in hot pancake juice, and swipe at his face with the latter. It wings him on one of his chins, barely even a mark.

""Beetus, don't you ever fucking touch me. I don't have any interest in your disgusting ass, get away from me, or I will start swinging this frying pan.""

I waggle the re hot pan towards him to emphasize that I will fucking do it.

Beetus escapes to his room, wide eyed, and muttering about calling the police an conditions, sobbing that he's single.

Police never came. Friends said he messaged folk and posted on LJ about how I lead him on and then threatened him, and what a thin privileged bitch. He also ate everything in the fridge as retaliation.

***

**TL;DR**

Beetus is all creepy fapturbating outside my door, and next morning tries to claim I've been giving him the come hither look. Gets threatened with a frying pan, and eats all our food in retaliation."	t5_2vzax	True

Yesterday got a bit chaotic as I am very busy/boyfriend was playing the majority of both shows that I was watching in the evening so I didn't actually get to hear about what the super secret chat was until I texted him today. Here's how it went, I guess. I don't know how to do screen caps on my phone, but here is a transcription of our conversation. I had to clean up some spelling and stuff, but it's as close to word for word as I could get: 

Me: 

Hey did you ever talk to [M]? She seemed pretty insistant. Everything go alright?

T: 

Oh god yeah. She took me for tea and made up some sort of intervention shit or whatever the hell. I learned new things about you though. 

Me: 

Uh oh. What have I been hiding now?

T: 

Well apparently you are a danger to yourself and the mental health of others and cannot possibly be okay in a commitment now, should perhaps you destroy my soul. 

Me: 

Whoops. 

T: 

Mmm yeah you are too self absorbed for me and probably have some disorder or another, you poor bugger. 

Me: 

Well, shit. Let me guess, eating disorder?

T: 

Bang on. 

Me: 

Oh shit. Okay. My bad. 

T: 

Hahahahaha. 

But seriously then she told me I deserve someone better and said she's only going on about it because she cares. This point I'm figuring what the hell.

Asked her right out if it's because she wants to date and she admitted it. 

She fucking said yeah. 

Me: 

Well at least she was honest. 

T: 

Well fuck if I could figure out what to say. 

I told her everything I'd done was just as a friend and I'm sorry but I'm committed. 

Then she's just crying everywhere. 

I want to say literally blubbering. 

Me: 

LOL. 

T: 

You know she fought that. Said we had something and you've taken it. 

I asked her what she thought we had and she said things about fucking eye contact or sometimes I smile at her or something but seriously what the fuck is wrong with women?

Sorry no some women. =)

There was some bullshit about touching arms or something. Saving the best for last here, you know what her big one was?

Me: 

Some love at first sight crap? Please let that be it. 

T: 

Nicknames. She made up her shit nickname for me 'cause she thought I'd given her one. 

Because sometimes I called her mate. 

She thought it was a fucken joke or something, like I was playing off of being English. 

Me: 

LOL WHAT.

T: 

I'd never hit a lady but good god I came close. 

Just a smack right in the mouth would have been perfect. 

That's how I tell my dog when she's being stupid, maybe it works on people. 

Me: 

Okay, so to recap, I have an eating disorder, I am going to destroy your beautiful pure soul, and you're only British sometimes for flirtation and/or shits and giggles. 

T: 

Right. 

**To follow up** 

I did talk to him on the phone briefly but there's not much more to add to that. Apparently it was a long talk, but the gist of it was that I was a terrible person, I am not healthy, and that she was more of a woman than me because she actually had some sort of compassion. 

So basically she tried to ""win him from me"" by calling herself a good person while trash talking me (to my boyfriend) for a couple of hours. Solid logic bro. 

Also, because I know this question will come up, apparently he wrapped it up by telling her they should probably not hang out anymore, at least for a while, and she cried (lol, blubbered) harder and blamed me.

If you haven't read the where I met Hammila [click here for context](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3z0u/hammila_and_the_jar_of_preserves/). Anyway, on to the story! 


This weekend I held a little barbeque at my place. I had a few of my friends graduate from Uni, so it was a perfect excuse to hold am event as well as invite the community. I posted at our local bar/coffee house that everyone was invited as long as they bring something to contribute to the party. I was happy that Silver was over to help me prepare the place for the event, and to form a plan to escape Hammila's dreadful conversations. I assumed that since it was a potluck event, Hammila wouldn't fathom sharing her food with others. How wrong I was. 

Fast forward to Sunday morning, the day of the party. The festivities all are supposed to start at 1, so I'm busy prepping things for the grill. Silver stops by early to help get things all ready for the event. Hammila's daughter runs over to see if we are missing anything that her father can get in town (This town is so small that there isn't a grocery store, gas station, or anything like that. It has one restaurant/bar/coffeehouse along the highway, and nothing else. The nearest town is almost 25 miles away, and barely bigger than this town). Silver and I braced ourselves for a barbeque with the beast. I declined needing anything from the store, and told her whatever her mom brings would be okay. She took off town the street to report back to her mom. 

1pm exactly I see the girl running up to the house, with Hammila chunking slowly behind her. I was surprised to see them walking, knowing they live about 4 blocks away, and after hearing her complain about walking up my driveway. Silver snickered that she probably had to decide on eating food now, or waiting an hour for her husband to come home. Silver mentioned that the last bbq that was held was a few years ago, and Hammila wouldn't walk over and sent her daughter to get food for her. I was quietly hoping that she would grab some food, and leave as well. 

My graduate friends started to fill in, one being nicebro, who is too kind to everyone, and tends to get taken advantage of, and athleticchick, who competes in half-marathons, marathons, and triathlons all throughout the year. They see Hammila coming, and AC laughs that free food will bring all the rats out of their homes.

A little info on AC: She is a brash, honest kind of girl. She isn't rude outright, but she isn't afraid to voice her opinion or be brutally honest if provoked. 

After 20 minutes, Hammila finally arrived. I realized the horror of her mistake - that 4 block walk made her disgustingly sweaty, and horribly smelly. She reaches for a hug, and I insticually back up. She frowned, and told us about how hard the walk was from her house.

I tell her to help herself to a drink (Lemonade, Unsweetened sun tea, water, beer and coffee), and go off to start some of these
 [delicious chicken kabobs](http://www.cookingmamas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ChiliLimeChickenKabobs.jpg). 

At the grill, I can hear Hammila complaining about the lack of soda.I ignored it at first, until she decided to make a scene about it. She waddled toward AC, and was loudly complaining,

""Can you believe it? There isn't anything to drink at this barbeque""

AC: ""Oh, the drinks are right over there. They are on ice in the cooler.""

Hammila:""Naw, I saw a bunch of waterbottles in there. I can't drink that."" 

At this point, nicebro takes over the grill, and I wander over to AC. I hear the complaints, and remind Hammila that I made coffee especially for her. She starts to complain:

""I cann't drink that! I just walked here from my house! Do you want me to die of dehydration? You know what caffeine does, don't you?""

AC:""Well there's plenty of water bottles over there so you can rehydrate after that ""horrible rigorous exercise'.""

Hammila: I can't have too much water. I'm allergic to it. Every time I drink it, it makes me feel sick.""

[MFW I realize she is serious](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/question-mark.gif)   

[AC and Silver'sFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lol.gif)

AC decides to jump on this, ""You are aware that water is in everything right? Your body is composed of like, 60% water, right?""

Hammila: ""Not me. I've only drank water about twice this year.""

AC:""You are aware that soda is made with water too? And coffee?""

[Cue Hammila's freak out](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Brock_Lesnar.gif)

""What are you? A doctor? You wouldn't know anything, since you are only 20 years old! I've been on this planet longer than you, and I think I would know if I was 'llergic to things!"" 

She huffed off to the table full of barbeque, chips, and homemade desserts. She piled three plates full of food, and stacked them on eachother. She stumbled down the driveway, and waited a half hour for her husband to pick her up and drive her home. She must have been upset, because she didn't even realize that she left her daughter there with us (She was in the back playing with my puppy). We told her that her mom left, but if she wanted to stay longer, she could. I learned that she doesn't like to eat meat, so I made her a veggie burger and let her play with the dog more.  In all honesty, that was the happiest I've ever seen her. 

She told us that they mainly eat prepackaged meals in her house, and her father drives the extra 60 miles a day to get her mom fast food. She told us that she is afriad that if she eats meat, she'll become as big as her mom. Luckily, AC spent some time with her and hopefully made her worry less. 

I thought that this little freak out would have been the last I would have to deal with Hammila, but she came over to borrow some sugar yesterday. That, though, is a story in itself. 

TL;DR:Have a barbeque with college friends, and the community. Hammila walks from her house, stinks up the place, and tells us that she is allergic to water. She gets called out on it, and fills plates full of food and leaves (while leaving her daughter at my house).

&gt;We'll call this sandwich shop Quizno's, since I can't think of a way to shoehorn Beetus or Thyroid into Quizno's.

&gt;Be wondering why someone left a dark gray tent in the middle of the line.

&gt;Oh wait, that's not a tent, it's a corpulent corporate chief in oversized business attire.

&gt;They didn't have a scale available, but I'd guess 5'5"" and 300 lbs.

&gt;Business beetus beast orders a large sandwich with Turkey and Bacon

&gt;Sandwich drone is about to put sub in oven

&gt;""Wait, that's ALL the meat you're putting on there""

&gt;""Would you like extra meat, ma'am?""

&gt;""Yes, put more meat on my sandwich, that's pathetic.""

&gt;A little rude, but obese office ogre seemed hungry

&gt;Order my sandwich, wait for it to go through oven to veggie station

&gt;As I'm loading my sub with vegetables, I hear the battle cry of the raging rotund rhinoceros

&gt;""WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE CHARGING ME FOR EXTRA MEAT!?""

&gt;""Well, I asked if you wanted extra meat and you said yes""

&gt;""THAT'S CUZ YOU PUT A TINY LITTLE SLIVER OF TURKEY ON THERE, LIKE YOU WANT ME TO STARVE OR SOMETHING. I TOLD YOU TO PUT MORE TURKEY ON CUZ YOU DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH AND NOW YOU'RE CHARGING ME EXTRA FOR THAT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS, I WANT TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH!.""

&gt;Manager hears commotion and walks over ""Is there a problem, ma'am""

&gt;""YES, YOU HIRE THESE GOD DAMN ILLEGALS WHO CAN'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH AND SHE'S TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR EXTRA MEAT CUZ SHE DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH ON IN THE FIRST PLACE"".

&gt;Manager asks sandwich drone what happened and she tells him, in perfectly fluent English that put the normal number of turkey and bacon slices on, then she asked the hungry ham harpy if she wanted extra meat and she said yes.

&gt;""THIS IS A GOD DAMN RACKET AND YOU PEOPLE ARE SCUM""

&gt;Something like 5 minutes went by with her spewing racist insults at the poor Quizno's employees before the manager finally quit being beta and asked her to pay for the sandwich with extra meat now or leave. 

&gt;Meanwhile, my sandwich was getting cold since there was only one register.

&gt;Faced with the threat or forfeiting her contested meatpile, the furious formal fatty relented and paid up, leaving in a huff and vowing never to come back.

&gt;[mfw](http://s2.postimg.org/iogjxo4o9/jags.gif) after making such a scene over a dollar, she walked out and got into a late model Mercedes SUV that likely cost more than I make in a year.

&gt;Of course, the reason why I could see her entering her vehicle was because it was parked in the handicap spot directly in front of the store. 

&gt;No handicap sticker, but she clearly had a cundishun.

&gt;Dropped a fiver in the tip jar because nobody should have to take that kind of abuse from a pile of ham over a pile of turkey.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I feel like there aren't enough blue links right now, so here's another of my favourite Fatmate episodes.

Your intrepid author here was feeling low. Down in the dumps. I had been unemployed for nearly 4 months now, finances were dwindling, I was unable to get help from parents, and generally everything sucked. So when a friend finally mentioned there were some positions going in the store he worked at, and that he'd put my resume in for me and give me a leg up, I jumped at the chance! I was so excited for a chance at working, I didn't care what it was. I went for the interview, which turned out to be a group thing, and instead of sticking me in a tech job or a cashier's spot, I was put on the deli counter. 

&gt;Beggerscantbechoosers.jpeg

It was a bit of a walk to work and back, but it was also good exercise so I didn't complain.

&gt;workin off dem chubbs

&gt;gettin fit and sexy

&gt;awwyisss

I rushed home ecstatic that I'd finally be getting work! I'd finally have income! And I wanted to celebrate!

I texted Spouse-a-tron to pick up steak because I had some good news, and we needed to celebrate.

Spouse-a-tron is very picky about his steak, so I leave that one up to him.  Upon arrival home, I find Beetus in the front room (where else) in his nasty bathrobe, legs akimbo, pokeballs shining in the afternoon light.

&gt;Snorlax used BLIND. It was super effective.

Averting my eyes, I stare resolutely at the ceiling trying not to look. Beetus doesn't seem to care that his nads are on display.

**""What's got you in such a good mood, positively *skipped* into the house there, finally found someone more gullible than Spouse-a-tron?""**

It was very difficult not to hear him muttering **""Or someone who pays better at dick sucking?""** like I couldn't blates hear him from the other room.

&gt;excuseme@yahoo.com?

I calm myself, there's no point in blowing up now, no witnesses to see him start it, and he'll just lie later. I count backwards from ten, and make like I'm putting some groceries away.

""No, Beetus, for your information, I have a job, I start Monday. I'm just happy to have work is all.""

**""Oh is that all? About fucking time. Now you can pull your own weight like a real person instead of being some deadbeat mooching girlfriend.""**

&gt;error404

&gt;calmnotfound

&gt;run rage.exe

""Fuck you, Beetus. You know, most people would hear someone getting a job and say 'Oh congrats!' or 'well done!'. Most people aren't snide and vicious dickheads. Why would you say something like that? I mean, do you think I don't know that Spouse-a-tron has been covering me for rent? Don't you think I don't feel shitty enough as it is without your hypocritical ass rubbing it in?""

&gt;Note: Beetus was always 15 days late with the rent.

&gt;claimed work paid him every 4 weeks midway through the month

&gt;bullshit.

&gt;He would spend all his money on payday on a month's worth of frozen meals and vidyagames.

&gt;Wait midway through the month, complain to mummy that he'd been shorted for hours and didn't get paid enough. 

&gt;Mummy sends him fat cash for rents and more food and games.

**""Whut, you can't talk to me like that, I pay bills and stuff. You haven't done anything, accept a compliment, I was saying congratulations, but I guess you don't understand it. Just like you don't understand my *conditions*. Fucking women.""**

&gt;my facelessness is infinite

""Beetus, you're a real asshole you know that? Speaking of pulling weight, have you finally gotten your direct debit for the rent sorted? We've been waiting on that for a while.""

**""My bank charges me per transaction and Direct Debits...It's super expensive for me it's cheaper just to give you guys cash.**

&gt;I have same kind of account at same bank as Beetus.

&gt;Direct Debit is free to another UK account.

&gt;All transactions are free including, domestic transfers, deposits, withdrawals at any cashpoint, etc.

&gt;I call horseshit.

""Beetus don't you have Royal Bank of Derp? A Key account?""

**""Yeah, why?""**

Because I think your mother, Spouse-a-tron and Landlady would all be pretty interested to hear you've been lying about not making rent on time because 'you don't have money at the first of the month and how you can only pay cash.""

Beetus's beady eyes narrow in his sweaty brows.

**""What do you mean?""**

""Beetus I have the same account type as you. I phoned the bank yesterday to find out whether there were any account types that charged for transactions. Also the company you work for uses the same payroll office as mine, which pays out on the first of the month.""

&gt;We'd literally had this argument yesterday, and these were his excuses. I went and checked them afterwards.

&gt;so full of shit.

**""You can't prove anything!""**

""After how much of a dick you've been, you really think that Spouse-a-tron and Landlady are going to believe *you* anymore?""

**""You're all just fucking stupid. It's because you and Landlady are all hormonal and you take each other's sides because bitches do that. And Spouse-a-tron only believes you because you suck his dick. That's why you're with him, so he gives you stuff, you're a whore.""**

&gt;namecalling

&gt;lovely.

&gt;It's like preschool all over again.

Beetus is flailing madly at this point, robe now totally open and everything is visible.

&gt;OHGODMYEYES

&gt;THEYBURN

I just want him out of the room. I snap.

""Beetus, you are currently in a communal area, which under UK law is still a public area. You're dressed indecently, and nobody wants to see your sweaty unwashed micropenis. Go put some fucking clothes on before I call the cops on you for verbal and sexual harassment as well as public indecency. You know there's a fucking preschool and playground not 20 feet from the window in the front room? They can see everything you're doing. You're lucky you're not on the sex offenders registry for being naked in the front room. That was a new fucking couch and not only have you broken the support struts, but your greasy ball sweat is now all over it. You and your fucking room reek of death. Fucking fix it before I make sure you get kicked out.""

&gt;I don't actually know if public decency laws apply to communal house areas

&gt;The front room and patio door are glass and as yet had no curtains. Preschool not 20 feet across the grassy bit from us had a great view of this fuck every morning.

&gt;Exposing himself to kids accidentally.

Beetus is a little unsure of himself, so he runs and hides in his room, muttering about asthma, and humid environments and too much light aggravating his conditions. He doesn't come out even for dinner.

&gt;Maybe he's dead.

When he thinks we're asleep, he starts gorging on food in the kitchen.

Next morning I find he's eaten all of our stuff in the fridge AND freezer.

**Chapter Eight**

Saturday evening started as little more than an unmemorable string of attempts to keep myself distracted. Lauren, according to her own description, would be indefinitely occupied with her job, a fact which I constantly repeated to myself each time that I compulsively checked my email (and found only an empty inbox). Porcina, meanwhile, was allegedly in attendance at a bachelorette party, giving me the opportunity to sign in to my instant messenger without fear of encountering her electronic entrapment. I tried to picture, with some amusement, how a theoretical stripper would react to her presence, and wondered if he'd have to invoke a strict “no touching” policy.

I shared these thoughts with a friend, a young man called Jeff, whom I had been keeping apprised of the situation. He had, via a litany of instant messages, been regaled with the entire story of Porcina's advertisement, the picture it had contained, my subsequent date with the diva of disaster, and my ongoing pursuit of the lovely Lauren. He wondered – and rightly so – why I had chosen to avail Porcina of my presence at the mall, a question for which I had no reasonable answer. Perhaps it was a sense of disgusted fascination, or a paranoid fear of having her badmouth me to her roommate. It might even have been, as revolting was it is to a consider, simply a case of keeping my options open, of maintaining a last-resort sexual safety net.

Jeff had frequently been (and still is) a voice of reason in my life, asking questions of me that I seemed to ignore from myself. That night, he filled the same role. Why, he asked, had I not simply blocked Porcina from my online interactions, if I was so hell-bent on avoiding her? Had I ever said, directly, that I wasn't interested in the young woman's affections? How would she interpret my intentions after I'd spent an entire day as an accomplice to her objectionable behavior? Was I really so afraid of going without sex that I'd stoop to sleeping with someone like Porcina?

My rationalizations were many, but each of them was as transparent as the last. With a dawning sense of horror, I began to accept the undeniable: As repulsive as Porcina was, she was still a prospect in my mind. An undesirable one, to be sure... but a prospect nonetheless. For all my charm and bravado, I was still the gangly teenager, so desperate to be desired that I'd entertain any offer. It was a sobering realization, full of uncomfortable ramifications and ego-shattering conclusions, like being held beneath a microscope that revealed every crack and flaw in my self-image. My prior honesty to Lauren would be meaningless if I couldn't pay myself the same courtesy, no matter how unpleasant the truth might have been. Porcina was a monster, but was I any better if I continued to lead her on?

There was only one option. Jeff agreed: I would have to confront Porcina.

The night gave way to morning with no contact from either girl, and Sunday was equally uneventful. As the horizon's hue shifted through blue and into orange, I began to wonder if something was amiss. There was the chance, I reasoned, that Lauren was simply working again... but Porcina, with her subsidized rent and seemingly endless free time, should have shown her zaftig face by then. Though I was hardly enthusiastic about the prospect of my looming ultimatum, I was even less enamored with all time spent in waiting for it. I had rejected the idea of simply sending an email, both because Jeff had encouraged me to be direct, and because my only form of contact – other than Porcina's screen name – had been via a Craigslist remailer address. Even so, the delay was excruciating.

At last, after hours of silent torment, an instant message arrived. “Hey,” was all that it said.

“Hi, Porcina,” I replied.

“I want to see you.”

My heart pounded. *This was it*. I took a deep breath, and typed my response with shaking hands. “I don't think that would be a good idea.”

There was a pause, just long enough for me to foster a healthy sense of panic. “Why not?”

“I don't want to lead you on,” I typed, “and I don't think we're compatible.” I considered saying more, but eventually decided on staying concise. There was no need to further complicate things with explanations, after all.

Porcina's next question surprised me, though: “So what?” she asked. I could almost hear the accompanying hiss of laughter that she had undoubtedly let loose. “You're not my boyfriend or anything. We're just fucking.”

To her credit, she was partially right... though the second part of her sentence seemed rather removed from reality. Our most intimate interaction had been a public peep show; certainly nothing approaching actual intercourse. Hell, I'd seen equally erotic exhibitions from Lauren by that point, if one discounted the electronic medium. “We're not fucking,” I finally replied. “And we're not going to.”

With no answer or warning, Porcina signed off.

I took a deep breath and let loose a sigh of relief. My hands were still shaking, but I felt strangely content. I had broken up with girls before, let them down... but never rejected them before anything had happened. It was a new experience for me, and I took it as a sign of self-improvement. My perpetual paranoia led me to wonder what the fallout would be for (and possibly with) Lauren, but in the moment, I felt accomplished.

My triumph was short-lived. A few seconds later, Porcina returned, and round two of the battle began.

“(Acronym for laughing.) Sorry!” she typed. “My Internet died! I'm back now!”

I grudgingly sent my response. “Did you get my last message?”

“(Acronym for laughing.) No. What did it say?”

“I said,” I typed again, convinced that she was lying, “that we are not fucking, and that we're not going to.”

A file transfer began... and like a fool, I accepted it. What arrived was a picture of a fully naked Porcina splayed out on her couch, her pudgy hands doing very little to hide the overgrown hedge maze at the base of her stomach. “Are you sure?” she asked. I could imagine her girlish tone all too well.

I confess, I paused for a moment... but for once, my resolve held firm. “I'm sure,” I wrote back.

Then, I promptly deleted the picture. 

That may seem like an insignificant event, not worthy of much note. After all, it was hardly an appealing image... but the action was a literal first for me. Before that night, I had *always* kept *every* picture, sent to me by *any* girl I had ever interacted with in such a way. It wasn't like typical pornography, I had told myself, which could be found again with some creative web-crawling. Pictures sent by people I *knew*, well, they were something special, like irreplaceable items with similarly priceless values. Erasing Porcina's from existence was more than just a wise decision, it was an inspiring victory against an unlikeable part of my own mind.

Unfortunately, a self-inflicted victory held little sway over Porcina, who promptly switched tactics in her conversation. “You still owe me for dinner,” she said. “Also, for breakfast and lunch.” I began to type my protests, but another message came through: “Since you're poor, you can work it off,” followed by yet another acronym for laughing.

“Lauren got us breakfast for free,” I was eventually able to answer, “and I didn't eat lunch with you.”

“I bought food for both of us,” insisted Porcina. “It's not my fault if you didn't each much.”

“I didn't eat *any*. Not even a mint.” I poured my frustration into my next lines. “I'll pay you back for dinner, but that's it. If Lauren wants me to pay for breakfast, I'll gladly oblige. I don't owe you for anything but a hamburger.”

Another period of online silence ensued. Had I finally vanquished my foe? Her response seemed to imply as much, and I allowed myself a small measure of optimism. “Okay,” came her response. “You can give me fifteen dollars.” It was more than my meal had cost, but I considered it a small price to pay. “I'm at home,” Porcina finished.

“You want it now, I take it?” I asked. In truth, I wasn't at all opposed to the suggestion. The sooner I could be done with this nonsense, the better. Also, the possibility of finding Lauren present was alluring in its own right.

“Yes,” was all that Porcina said.

I reached for my coat as I typed my last line. “I'll be right over.”

Little did I know, in mere moments, I would be dangerously close to entering the belly of the beast.

&gt;be a couple months ago, just starting to get warm out

&gt;busting out the grill and smoker and make some delicious BBQ

&gt;bout' ready to ham out on some delicious ribs

&gt;been smoking them for about 4 hours

&gt;little did a i know the smell of freshly cooked, greasy pork would attract the beast

&gt;i look down at my beer

[do you feel that?](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lda9qpu91Z1qfsk6co1_500.gif)

&gt;250lb hambeast of a sister-in-law pounds through the door

&gt;decided to visit after doing some grocery shopping

&gt;oh, what monstrosites must be in those bags?

&gt;""I'M STARTING A NEW DIET! From now on I'm only eating GLUTEN FREE and balancing the pH of my foods!"" 

[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/nc9j0.gif)

&gt;i mention something about how those types of diets are fads/scams, especially the pH one

&gt; ""tee-hee my friend lost 15lbs on it!""

&gt; i know what friend she's talking about, a true 500lb obese hambeast. she could have lost 15lbs clearing the debris out of her folds.

&gt;opens bag after bag of ""healthy"" trader joe's food to show off her new ""diet"" food

&gt;nothing but shit like gluten free cookies, terrible frozen food, etc 

&gt;time for the ribs to come off the smoker

&gt;when i smoke stuff i cook a lot since it takes so long, so we had way way more than we needed for the two of us

&gt;ham-in law looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ifYUt.gif), clearly waiting for a dinner invitation 

&gt;""hammie, do you want to stay for dinner?""

This her real, honest to goodness, exact response

&gt;""Sure, lean meat like ribs are fine on my new diet!""

&gt;i'm stunned. however, after years of dealing with her i'm used to stupid shit flying out of her mouth. and since i already said something about her diet be useless i used up my allotted hammie corrections. any more and she would flip. 

&gt;whatever, ribs are delicious. just had to tune out the sights of sounds of hammie and her ribs. sounds like the sarlacc pit eating boba fett. 

&gt;she ate a rack to herself plus heaping sides of coleslaw and baked beans

&gt;time for dessert. i also made a key lime pie (im a bit of a food-bro)

&gt;hammie *devours* 1/4 of the large pie while my wife and i share a small slice. 

&gt;i can already tell this diets going to be successful

&gt;i like cooking but always give a ton of food away because my wife and i can't eat it all. especially stuff like desserts. i know hammie's husband loves key lime pies, so i offer her half to take to him. also offer her a good portion of the ribs.

&gt;""sure! key lime pie is jabba's favorite! and he'll love the ribs too!"" 

THE NEXT DAY

&gt;stop over wifey's parents house for something, the in-laws hammie and jabba happen to be there

&gt;""hey jabba! how'd you like the...""

[glance at hammie to see this](http://i.imgur.com/NpAbl.gif)

&gt;but it's too late, the words won't stop

&gt;""...pie and ribs i sent over?""

[his reaction](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110331013128/uncyclopedia/images/2/28/Explosion_mushroom_shaped.gif)

&gt;i'll spare you the details of the fight, but it was epic. he was *pissed*. not only did hammie steal his favorite food (a cardinal offense for a hamplanet). apparently she ate the other 1/2 rack of ribs and *1/2 a pie* at home before he arrived. 

&gt;but that's not all! she didn't tell him that she stopped over for dinner, or that she had a 2nd dinner, but made dinner for them and ate it like nothing happened!

&gt;she ate 3 *large* dinners in the span of a couple hours. this includes 1 1/2 racks of ribs, 3/4 of a key lime pie, sides, and w/e awfulness she cooked for herself and jabba.  

&gt;and here's the kicker:

&gt;the reason she was over at my parent-in-laws was to brag about how well her diet (that she started yesterday, the day she ate enough ribs for 8 people) was going!

tldr: hamplanet sister in law comes over talking about how she's starting a shitty fad diet. proceeds to eat a shit ton of greasy ribs and pie with us for dinner. send her some home for her husband and she eats those too. then she makes another dinner for the two of them and eats that. all while bragging about how well her diet is going.

I know your bodies have probably started to eat your muscles due to malnutrition, and I am so sorry for forcing that onto you. Luckily I'm back with more tales of [Hamtaro](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ebx7n/living_with_hamtaro/), my ex-roommate. Take in the calories as quickly as you can, you don't want your body to think it's full before you're done ^tee ^hee!

When I was still cool with Hamtaro, she brought over a ~~planet~~ boyfriend, who will be referred to as [Oxnard](http://hamtaro.wikia.com/wiki/Oxnard). Oxnard began their relationship at about 5'8"", 260-270 lbs. He was cool, we had a lot in common, and whenever he was around the apartment we would hang out.

I brought greens, but I slathered these in some butter so that you guys would get the full health benefits!

&gt; Hamtaro and Oxnard come home

&gt;somethingiswrong.exe

&gt;""BootsAreMade4Walken, Oxnard doesn't have anywhere to stay. His dad kicked him out.""

&gt;oh fuck, that's serious

&gt;""Can he stay here for a week or two until he finds a place?""

&gt;of course, he can stay until the end of the month if he needs

I felt legitimately bad for Oxnard. He never went to class, he was depressed, and he was always looking at apartments on craigslist. I asked if he wanted help and he said yes, so I started sending him links to cool studios within his price range throughout the day.

&gt;be 3 weeks later

&gt;Oxnard is still here

&gt;still getting along, not very happy about it

&gt;he cooks all the time

&gt;Oxnard, how are you affording all of this food?

&gt;notice my hot dogs are disappearing

&gt;I fucking love hot dogs

&gt;Hamtaro doesn't eat hot dogs

&gt;confront Oxnard and Hamtaro

&gt;maybe you ate them and forgot

&gt;[MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/55d92bf19899fa67f26355bf09a16bb5/tumblr_mipeoasVf31rwcc6bo1_250.gif) they actually think I'll believe this happened

&gt;Oxnard, how is the apartment hunt?

At this point, Hamtaro threw a fucking *fit*. HE'S LOOKING, BOOTS, IT'S NOT HELPING THAT YOU'RE PRESSURING HIM. YOU'RE NOT MAKING HIM FEEL VERY WELCOME.

&gt;both go into her room and slam her door

&gt;[I don't even](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mepwx8xCUn1rybq9m.gif)

Unfortunately, Hamtaro's daddy-dearest owned our apartment building, so he was my landlord. Hamtaro was basically my landlord since her dad never once spoke to me. Whatever Hamtaro said, went.

&gt;be FOUR FUCKING MONTHS later

&gt;hardly spending time at home

&gt;alwayswithboyfriend.jpg

&gt;all of my salad dressing, hot dogs, cheese, butter, and bread had steadily disappeared [without replacement](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cheryl-Cole-sad.gif)

&gt;finally lose it

&gt;Hamtaro, Oxnard needs to leave or pay me for a third of the rent

&gt;""I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.""

&gt;[wait, really?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2pac.gif)

&gt;Oxnard moves out that weekend

&gt;Hamtaro and Oxnard break up

I'm not sure why Hamtaro suddenly agreed with me (maybe because both of them put on close to fifty pounds when he lived there and they never left the apartment), but I was happy to finally be free(ish) to buy food without it being stolen (as often).

TL;DRs are bad for you!! You need to eat the FULL MEAL to get these curves!!

Now that that's over with onto the tale, please forgive my subpar greentexting.

&gt;Be me, first semester of college, 2 weeks into semester I believe

&gt;Be 5'8"" around 220, down around 90 pounds in the previous 2 1/2 months

(dem low carb diets)

&gt;Sitting in cafeteria during my lunch

&gt;Have lunch break later in the day so cafeteria is pretty much dead

&gt;Remains of my chicken salad sitting in front of me while I study for upcoming class

&gt;Suddenly all the tables chairs and small objects in the room begin to rattle and move towards the door

&gt;The area around me darkens as the light begins to bend towards the entrance

&gt;The door flies open and the bastard love child of an [abomination](http://imgur.com/kOIUOrA) and [Viscera](http://imgur.com/gRx0Hfs) walks in

&gt;He is probably about an inch taller than me (5'9""ish) but probably out weights me by a good 150 pounds at that point (~370-380 pounds)

&gt;His scrunched up face is caked with grease and a literal forest of pimples

&gt;His greasy hair is pulled back into a sloppy ponytail (sloppier than mine ,and thats saying something)

&gt;His pokemon shirt is 2 sizes to small, exposed the bottom of his massive gut and is stained with the grease of 1000 animals

&gt;He waddles over to the counter, the tiles on the floor creak as his full weight tests their structural integrity

&gt;He reaches the counter and a flood of pure rage crosses over his face folds when there isn't someone standing ready to attend his dietary needs (beetus)

&gt;As he slams his hand against the little service bell, I'm sure I saw grease from his grubby paw splatter across the counter

&gt;The cafeteria worker comes out from the back and his eyes widen in horror

&gt;""Took you long enough"", its speech is slurred by the layers of fat the coat its tongue and cheeks

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/PNYRZ.gif) it took the dude like 15 seconds to get out to the counter

&gt;The hambeast starts spewing out its order

&gt;3 double cheese burgers, 2 dozen piece chicken strips and 1 fry bucket

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/D9dQr.gif) Hammy just ordered enough food to feed a village

&gt;The double cheese burgers a massive, as well as a order of 6 chicken strips

&gt;And the fry bucket, wow, its basically a 84 oz cup filled with fries, friend and I split one once and it was too much food for 2 of us

&gt;Watch poor cafeteria worker get to work on the order

&gt;All the while the lardbeast is sitting at the table closest to the counter huffing and muttering on this breath, I'm sure his poor thyroid was just struggling

&gt;Eventually the food is ready and Hamgar walks the tray over to a table and proceeds to try and best every speed eating record know to man

&gt;In less than 8 minutes it has finished everything on the tray

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/CRACRU2.gif) Hamgar gets back up and order 2 more fry buckets

&gt;The worker is stunned, but none the less sets out to deep frying the frozen potato sticks

&gt;Fatty gets served the fries and inhales both buckets in a little under 10 minutes

&gt;Gets up and orders 3 more

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/RuYH0.gif) My faith in humanity begins to crumble

&gt;Worker tries to fill the order, but its late in the day on Friday and it seems that they have run out of fries

&gt;Worker says he has enough fries to make 1 more bucket and a large order (a huge amount of fries in its own right)

&gt;Hamgar, denied the chance to drive the fries before him and hear the lamentation of their women, explodes into carb-filled fury

&gt;He begins to yell at the poor worker, I actually see bits of food flying from his death-maw

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/odydm.gif) I realize the worker must have been hit by at least some of the shrapnel

&gt;Rant continues for 3 or 4 minutes about how the service is so shitty, how everyone working there is incompetent and how no actual restaurant would run out of food

&gt;To his credit the worker stayed calm through it all and when Hamgar was done asked ""Do you want the fries or not"" in a calm voice (bravo, sir)

&gt;Hamgar fumes, but says yes, inhales the fires as soon as he gets his hands on them

&gt;Having completed french fry genocide, Hamgar then waddles out of the cafeteria presumably to try and catch one of the many stray cats that hang around campus for a nice after-lunch snack    

I didn't see Hamgar for 2 years after this incident until he appear in one of my classes this semester.  Having spent 3 hours 2 times a week in the same room as this red-meat giant, I have a handful of other stories about him.  I will post those up too if this one is liked well enough.

I was indulging in some laziness today, telling myself that I would work it all out later at my yoga class. So I indulged in a cherry coke, non diet, and had a light mac'n'cheese dinner. I felt like I deserved a little treat. Besides, it was too hot out. I spent most of the day in shorts, dicked around on the xbox for a few hours, then it was Yoga time. Yoga was good. An hour and a half of stretching, and it was hard work. Almost as if the instructor knew I had been indulgent, today was extra hard. After class, I thought I'd do some weights or cycle in order to get some extra work out of me. But suddenly it hits me.

I feel this icy chill down my spine just as I jump on the elliptical machine. The AC on high? No, the vents are too far away. Cold sweat? My shirt is dry.  I look around, and I see what can only be described as a small planet. Planet Chubbs is giving me an icy stare of death. Then Planet Chubbs notices I've spotted her, and changes her smile to a saccharine grin which only barely hides the contempt she holds. Planet Chubbs is approximately 5'7 with a circumference of about 7 feet. Planet Chubbs looks to weigh maybe 400 lbs. I twitch slightly in fear, and go to the weights. Maybe if I stay far away I won't get sucked into her gravitational pull.

Later I head to the bikes. All five are empty, I just picked one and go. About five minutes into my workout, I have bad 80s pop blazing off the mp3 player, and I'm oblivious to the world.

I feel a tap on my shoulder. I assume it is just the wire from my mp3 player. I ignore it. Then my earphone is yanked out of my ear. I snap out of my mental Blondie impersonations and look around confused. The machine stops as I stop treading. Planet Chubbs has stood next to me and has just pulled out my earbud.

""You're on my machine.""

""You just fucking ripped out my earbud.""

""Well you weren't listening. You're on my machine.""

I am understandably irate at this point. I don't give a toss if you're the Queen. You rip out an earbud, that's unwanted physical contact. You do that to me and I will fuck your shit up.

As I start to explain this concept to her, Planet Chubbs interrupts me and points to the sticker by the wheels.

""It's the only machine that will hold me. You're on my machine.""

There is a sticker that says it supports up to 500lbs. None of the other cycles have this.
Perhaps I reacted to harshly, I think. At least she's trying.

""Oh, I'm sorry, but *please* do not yank out my earphones like that.""

Planet Chubbs rolls her eyes in a mental ""whatever"". I move to the next machine and begin again. Planet Chubbs mounts the cycle in a hideous parody of real exercise. Planet Chubbs's derriere doesn't fit on the already generous seat. It droops down on either side of the cushions like jello. Planet Chubbs is wearing a stretch jersey knit black tshirt. Planet Chubbs must think going to the gym is a social activity, because she's dolled herself up with eyeliner, lipstick, mascara...the works.

She adjusts the cycles built in TV to put on Family Derp. Instead of pedaling she just moves the upper pedal back and forth a quarter of a turn. I wonder if this is some new workout. Then it hits me. This is the minimum activity to keep the tv going. Planet Chubbs must have noticed my attention, as she goes to pull my earbud out again. Noticing the look I give her she stops and points to it instead. I remove my earbud.

""What?"" I ask.

""Doncha just LOOOOVE these built in TVs? I wish I had cable this nice at home.""

I look at the xeroxed and laminated channel list attached to the walls. It's not cable, it's the free channels. This is a YMCA gym after all.

I shrug noncommittally in reply.

""I come here for the TV."" She explains.

""Mmmph."" I respond politely, trying to zone in to my music. I halfheartedly smile and nod. She doesn't respond for a few minutes so I put my earbud back in.

Moments later she waves her sweaty pudgy hands inches from my face. I start back and pull the earbud out. At this point I want to just leave, Planet Chubbs is not making this worthwhile.

Planet Chubbs speaks again. Every roll of flab vibrates with the sounds and the reverberations from her not-pedaling.

""YOU'RE EXERCISING TOO MUCH. I JUST SAW YOU COME OUT OF THAT YOGA CLASS. YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK YOUR SPINE.""

For reference, dear readers, I am about 173cm (5'8) and 62kg (138lbs). I am also very busty, so I look like a broomhandle with balloons taped to my chest. I am not the thinnest of women, but I'm nowhere near this Planetoid's level of unfitness.

""Pardon?"" I say, confused by this statement.

""GURL LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE ANOREXIC AND YER GONNA BREAK YER SPINE IF YOU EXERCISE THAT MUCH. MY DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT. THAT'S WHY I TAKE IT SLOW LIKE THIS.""

I give Planet Chubbs a look, reset the bike, and start to gather my things because I'm leaving. Jabba the Hut here isn't going to let me be. 

""WHY YOU GOTTA BE LEAVIN? I'M JUST BEING NICE. I'M TRYING TO **HELP** YOU.  ANOREXIC GIRL LIKE YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA GET A MAN TA TREAT YOU RIGHT IF YOU AIN'T GOT CURVES LIKE ME.""

Curves? Try folds. Try rolls of fat, Lardzilla.

As I grab my bag from the coat rack she slings one last volley.

""YEAH BITCH, YOU RUN. DAMN RIGHT I CALL YOU OUT ON YOUR SKINNY ANOREXIC PRIVILEGED ASS, YOU DON'T LIKE IT? YOU RUN, WHORE.""

Planet Chubbs got a long ass complaint made about her to the staff. Guess who already had several strikes on her membership for abusing the time limit (and number of children limit) at the gym's drop in daycare. Guess who's losing a membership."	t5_2vzax	True
1368403382.0	1e7o41	And here we see the Australian Bogan Landwhale, in her natural habitat...		478	83	123	"**TL;DR A marine show by a child neglecter takes place aboard a locomotive, to the amusement of many onlookers.**

In this great sun burnt country, us Australian natives like to call the local rednecks ""bogans"". They are *consistent* in every state and every capital city. People plan their trips making sure they don't enter these holes of despair and front lawn toilets.

While I don't like to call them all 'welfare bums', they do sit on the lower end of the economic spectrum, which is rather sad. Lots of straggley children not being able to make it to school because their parents spent their bus money on spliffs and goon (Weed and wine, for those not in the 'know'), and no job security due to casual jobs being the only available source of income in the area. They can be fired at a moments notice, and often are, due to bad service, being late, or having to deal with their children over work.

All in all, it's not a great combination of things to be brought up with, and despite welfare controls being put in place, you will see a lot of the younger teens having kids to get that $4000 baby bonus, so they can add some 'sick rims' to their Holden Commodores (Or as you American folk know them as, Pontiac's or Chevrolets... that's right, you're using Aussie chassis'!).

Now, as you can imagine, due to lack of education, ease of accessibility to funds and junk food, and a lifestyle mainly revolving around episodes of Oprah and The Home Shopping Network, this can lead to some Class A FPS and fat logic.

So, due to this low socioeconomic status that a lot of these kids are born and raised in, they have to make do with the resources around them. One example is that due to their low income, they can not afford air conditioning. This can be quite a problem in Australia, where par boiling vegetables is done by leaving a pot of water in the sun, and we don't so much have barbecues, just plates of metal we put meat on to cook in the natural heat.

So the solution? Ride the public transport system. 

One particularly hot day, I was trying to get a ride home on the train from university, and it was absolutely packed, as one would expect during peak hour.

&gt; Be me, with a bag full of text books, exhausted from pracs and study

&gt;Meh, I can stand, it's only a 3 stop journey

&gt;Suddenly, a man gets off and directly offers me his seat!

&gt;ohpraisebetoBromin.wav

&gt;Don't notice the ominous sigh behind me 

&gt;As I sit down and look back up, I see possibly the second largest woman I've ever seen in my life

&gt;Don't ask for weight. All I know is that she looked like [this](http://topnews.net.nz/images/Jasmine-Sciascia.jpg), except with nicotine stained everything

&gt;Too fat to stand in the isle properly, basically sitting on the sides of the seats around her

&gt;Ass in peoples faces

&gt;""Why did you let HER sit down?! It's not like she is disabled!

(All speech by this planet has been translated from whale to human)

&gt;""Because she clearly is carrying a large pack full of books. I admire a person who struggles for their education""

&gt;Not sure what to feel, but just rolling with it

&gt;""Well, I bet she hasn't been on the train all day!""

&gt;""Of course I haven't. I've just gotten off from uni. Why would I stay on the train all day?""

&gt;My temper is rising, fucks being given is rapidly approaching zero

&gt;Lovely man jumps off the train, unable to give this woman the stern talking to she needed

&gt;Her anger turns to me and those around me

&gt;""You just selfishly took that seat, didn't you? Didn't even bother to offer it to anyone else""

&gt;Just kind of daze out the window. Years of experience dealing with bogans has taught me well

&gt;Or so I thought

&gt;""THIS IS SO LIKE YOU CITY FOLK. SOME OF US ACTUALLY HAVE DISABILITIES, AND CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE CITY""

&gt;Just look up and stare at her, and let it get all that pent up entitlement out

&gt;I enjoy a good marine show

&gt;""SOME OF US DON'T JUST USE THE TRAINS TO GO TO AND FROM WORK. SOME OF US HAVE TO BE ON HERE JUST TO STAY COOL""

&gt;People further down the train audibly laughing

&gt;This displeases the corpulent lard bearer

&gt;""LOOK AT ALL OF YOU PEOPLE, YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT THIS IS WHAT REALITY IS.""

&gt;""THIS IS HOW REAL PEOPLE LOOK AND ACT""

&gt;Majority of people on the train no bigger than chubby

&gt;youkeeptellingyourselfthatdarling.png

&gt;""You had BETTER give me your seat NOW, before I pull the emergency lever on this train and stop it for all of you!""

The trains here have buttons you can press to automatically open the doors, even while the train is running, and buttons that give you an intercom straight to the driver. Results in about a $200 fine if misused. 

&gt;She begins to flail about, trying to stand up after wedging herself in the isle, between the seats

&gt;Notice small children in tow, shaking her rolls, trying to get her to calm down

&gt;They clearly haven't been to school that day

&gt;Begin giggling myself

&gt;""OH, YOU THINK THIS IS JUST SO FUNNY. WELL, WHEN YOU GET FAT, YOU WILL ALLLLLL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS""

&gt;Says 'all' while pointing at everyone on the train

&gt;Thinks that everyone will just eventually get fat

&gt;Laugh harder

&gt;""Not everyone gets fat and lazy. Some of us actually have the goal to own their own air conditioner""

&gt;She begins raging... coherent words do not leave her mouth

&gt;Just screaming

&gt;Tantrum screaming

&gt;Actually doubled over in laughter by this point

&gt;""Look, this is my stop""

&gt;Turn to the person behind me, stand up

&gt;""Would you like this seat?""

&gt;Lovely lady, grateful for a seat on her long trip home

&gt;Go down the opposite end of the train to get off

&gt;Hear the fat lady singing

&gt;""YOU'RE JUST A SPOILT LITTLE BITCH, AND NO ONE ON THIS TRAIN LIKES YOU""

&gt;A tradey (person who works in trades such as carpentry/mechanics) speaks up from behind her

&gt;""WILL YOU JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DEAL WITH IT?!""

&gt;Hear more yelling as I get off the train

&gt;Have to double over on the platform to get my breath back

Believe it or not, folks, this happens more than you could imagine. Once I had a Christian woman saying she had cursed me for not giving her the seat she wanted, despite there being plenty around. Another time it was 3 little racist landwhales trying to hustle a group aboriginal kids, who were on their way home from school.

&gt;Waiting to be seated when

&gt;man, did it get cloudy outside

&gt;ask SO if he felt the ground tremble too

&gt;take the kid and run for cover!

&gt;False alarm. It's just a hamplanet couple.

&gt;Diabeto looks about 6', 500 pounds. Complaining about walking distance from handicapped parking spot to door.

&gt;Lardeesha looks 5'6, 400. Mumbling something. She can only speak from the right side of her lips, and her cheek moves up and down when she talks.

&gt;Waddles in front of me and SO.

&gt;""DIABETO, LUK AT DIS CUTE ASS BEBE!""

&gt;Just reaches over and pinches my three month old's cheek.

&gt;Lardeesha's fatty thumb and forefinger is bigger than my baby's face.

&gt;Baby starts to cry. Mama alert!

&gt;Hand baby off to SO for soothing and tell Lardeesha sternly to back off.

&gt;""I did not give you permission to touch my child!""

&gt;Lardeesha pouts at first.

&gt;""HE JUST SO CUTE AND IMMA BE A MAMA TOO!""

&gt;Repeat warning and wait quietly for the hostess to be seated.

&gt;One minute after getting to table, guess who gets the booth behind us?

&gt;SO moves to sit next to me because he's uncomfortable with touching backs with Diabeto.

&gt;Diabeto's fatty back hangs over back of booth.

&gt;SO's back is sweaty and smelly from the one minute contact with Diabeto's back.

&gt;Try to eat pancakes despite diminishing appetite.

&gt;Look up because of noise from hamplanet's booth.

&gt;Diabeto is complaining to waitress about there not being enough syrup.

&gt;""I ASKED FOR EXTRA SYRUP!""

&gt;I spot three extra cups on their table.

&gt;Waitress comes back with more syrup, now Lardeesha is complaining.

&gt;""MAH FRENCH TOAST DON'T HAVE ENUFF POWDERED SUGAR!""

&gt;Poor waitress walks away again.

SO and I abandon eating for hamwatching.

&gt;Diabeto and Lardeesha are now loudly complaining about waitress.

&gt;""SHE TOO SLOW TO SERVE FOOD!""

&gt;""STUPID BITCH DON'T KNOW DA MEANING OF THE WORD EXTRA!""

&gt;Waitress comes back, some signs of tears, for more abuse.

&gt;Manager comes. Diabeto and Lardeesha rant about the waitress, the awful quality of food, and the waiting time.

&gt;Manager apologizes and comps their meal.

1373167298.0	1hs8zj	The Fat-shion Designer II	LadyDragQueen	468	77	132	"[Part 1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hpt48/the_fatshion_designer/)

Hello everyone! I bring another tale of the Fat-shion Designer and how I thought for half a second that she had a chance of making it. I apologize for the extreme length of this one, but this is the tale of how she discovered HAES and a monster was unleashed into the world.

&gt;Classes have been in session for about two weeks and I’ve already learned that the actual school part of college is a total drag^teehee

&gt;Be at dining commons at 7am before abysmally early class

&gt;I am a zombie mindlessly choking down flavorless oatmeal and trying to remember why the hell I ever thought an 8am class was a good idea. 

&gt;The ground begins trembling and an ominous booming alerts me to an impending earthquake. 

&gt;Before I can heave my tired body up and safely store it under the table, I hear a loud voice ringing out.

&gt;”HEY LADYDRAGQUEEN WHAT’S UP?”

&gt;Oh it’s just Cocoa, swathed in a bizarre bedazzled muumuu of a dress with a smear of something resembling syrup already on her face.

&gt;”Can I sit here?”

&gt;”Sure you can sit here” my mouth Benedict Lard-nolds me in favor of politeness. “What brings you here so early?”

&gt;”I like to get here when they first open and stay until my 9:30am class so I can make sure to be the first one to taste all the different foods they put out.” She proceeds to set down a massive tray of food and plop into a chair.

&gt;Chair begins weeping and bemoaning the sorrows of its people.

&gt;”I was thinking lately that maybe I could stand to lose a little weight” she says, mouth full of the food she’s wolfing down without breaks for air or speech.

&gt;[”Oh, really?”] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/9edfe5d8d91daeba24ba2f85b728a89c/tumblr_mj2k3xEEZs1rosb88o1_500.gif) I manage to say without much detectable disdain. I’m proud of myself. 

&gt;”Yeah, I was wondering if maybe you could show me how to do it until I lose a couple pounds. ”

&gt;*BAD IDEA SAY NO SAY NO* “Of course I’ll help you, Cocoa. I’m going for a run later tonight if you’d like to join me. I’m sure you’ll be on the road to fitness in no time.”

&gt;Why do I do this to myself? 

&gt;”Well, it’s a lot harder for me to lose weight than for other people. I have… **(DRUMROLL PLEASE)** a thyroid problem.”

&gt;Explains THE SEVERITY OF HER CONDISHUNS with “It’s just so hard to drop any extra weight I might put on over a holiday. I mean look, I’m a little bigger than you and we’re eating about the same amount of food.”

&gt;[MFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/ff9e5cd164ed72ef2f8731864906eea7/tumblr_mnd3bxVVma1s8or22o1_250.gif) I’m eating one bowl of oatmeal and she has a large heaping plate of eggs and potatoes, a large plate of pancakes, and  a smaller plate of three muffins. 

&gt;WAIT A MINUTE WASN’T I ANOREXIC JUST A FEW DAYS AGO?

Regardless, I actually start to feel excited and imagine being able to help someone turn their life around. I head off to class in high spirits.

After classes that night, ESL and I join Cocoa and KaiKai for dinner. Cocoa and I had already arranged to go for a run when we leave, and I am surprised to see her actually arrive in workout clothes like we had decided. 

&gt;omgshe’sreallygonnamakeit.hopeandchange

&gt;Show Cocoa how I use a smaller plate so I’m not tempted to fill it up with more than I need. She looks inspired.

&gt;Split up to get food, Cocoa clearly wanders in direction of the carbs. 

&gt;Return to the table and she is carrying what can only be described as the Mt. Everest of meals.

&gt;She has one plate, and it is a small plate, but she had piled it with heaps of french fries and then carefully balanced 9 or so slices of pizza in a stack over the fries. 

&gt;ESL stares at me with a look of horror similar to someone watching kittens get kicked down a staircase.

&gt;”So much food! You must be hungry to eat big gross pile of slop.”

&gt;”I haven’t eaten all day!” Still, Cocoa looks back at her plate and seems hesitant. 

&gt;We seize the opportunity and convince her to only eat about half of the mound and even pick at a plate of fruit ESL fetched her. 

&gt;Minus a few complaints about not having enough food, all seems to be going well!

&gt;When the meal is over and exercise time rolls around, she’s even excited to go with me!

&gt;Cocoa and I bid the others goodbye and make our way out into the world for a jog.

&gt;It is August and we are in the desert. To say that it’s hot outside would be like saying that Michael Jackson had a little work done. 

&gt; We are outside for approximately 15 second before Cocoa starts sweating like she just single-handedly built the pyramids. I'm slightly sweaty myself. 

&gt;Gotta be brave

&gt;Try to start with a small jog. Cocoa takes approximately four bouncey steps with her breast-flaps walloping her in the face before she huffs out that jogging is bad.

&gt;Humor her and slow down to a power walk.

&gt;And by power walk, I mean the kind of stroll that old people take through flower gardens.

&gt;After about a sixth of a mile: “Working your body this hard doesn’t do anything for your health except ruin it! Let’s go back!”

&gt;I have never had such a low intensity workout in my life. 

&gt;We turn around because I’m sure it’s hard to be physically active when carrying around the weight of two people, and every little bit is a step in the right direction.

When we get back to the suite (wait why did she come back with me? She doesn’t even live here!), she thanks me and goes off into KaiKai’s room to study or something. I have the first draft of a paper I’ve had a week to procrastinate on due first thing in the morning, so I stay up late to finish it and then finally fall into a blissful slumber.

Now, the rule in our suite was to always leave all inner doors unlocked in case someone forgot their key, so we could let them into their room through a common area. However, on day one we established an “always knock before entering private area or bathroom” rule. Cocoa does not give a flying fig about rules.

&gt;Been asleep for what feels like 10 minutes when I feel myself being vigorously shaken awake. 

&gt;Like any classy lady, my first instinct is to blindly flail my hands around and scream “BACK THE FUCK UP!” 

&gt;It’s Cocoa, and she has an extremely pressing matter to bring to my attention.

&gt;”What do you do when you feel hungry and it’s late?”

&gt;”YOU GO TO FUCKING SLEEP AND YOU CAN GOBBLE UP THE WORLD AGAIN TOMORROW”

&gt;”But if I starve myself, I’ll look like you!” (the tank top I sleep in had ridden up from her shaking) “You can see your hipbones! EW! I bet having sex with you is like being pushed into a pile of brooms!”

&gt;Bitch, having sex with you is like taking a magic carpet ride on a waterbed.

&gt;”I TRYING TO SLEEP OVER HERE, GET AWAY OR I WILL CALL FRONT DESK AND HAVE YOU ROLLED OUT!”

&gt;ESL’s threat of action is sufficient enough to send Cocoa scurrying out of the room, but I’m too angry to sleep

&gt;I am a mature adult so I sit in the laundry room all night and whine on the phone to my mother about how college is miserable. 

Over the course of the next few days, Cocoa plays along with the idea of getting in shape. She takes much smaller (still large by regular standards, but for her she was positively skimping) portions and occasionally there is even sight of something green on her plate. Every day for three days straight we go on our evening slowly-inch-around-the-block. Things seem to be going well, until one night she reveals the fat logic slowly spreading throughout her massive body.

&gt;Going to the gym! Wave bye to KaiKai and Cocoa in living area and prepare to set out.

&gt;[MFW] (http://media.tumblr.com/f16530b0cfaf32507bf78ac2f79d0ac2/tumblr_inline_mlmio71ZZm1qz4rgp.gif) Cocoa asks to come along and I actually wanted to do real exercise. 

&gt;Say sure, no need to be mean about it. I can always go again tomorrow.

&gt;We get to the gym and I find out she’s never actually been inside of a gym and has no idea how any of the machines work.

&gt;What.

&gt;Show her how to set the treadmill to a slight incline and a slow pace, then proceed to go around and try to move my body.

&gt;Workout zone ruined by a rather gruesome thump

&gt;Turn around, and Cocoa is writhing on the ground. Everyone else in sight is collectively [cringing] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/2a047b557b5a4af673a5850e83861324/tumblr_mmsvpgHHaP1rosb88o4_250.gif)

By the time I make my way over to her, a couple guys had helped her up and she is babbling about shoddy machinery and exercise being a threat to the health. When she is coherent again, I find out that she had tripped over her feet and fallen backwards off the machine. Thankfully that clip-on emergency stop cord had slowed the machine and made it so her fall was barely a tumble, but she was still pissed and embarrassed. 

&gt;Give her a hug, all fitness-buddy-camaraderie style. She pushes me off.

&gt;""Don't worry, everyone has an embarrassing gym story. These people don't even care, they've seen it all. Just get back on that horse.""

&gt;""I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO, THIS CAN'T BE HEALTHY""

&gt;""Whoa, calm down. [It's just a fall!] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0uqbwXv6U1qaropco1_500.gif)""

&gt;""IT'S NOT JUST A FALL! I'M ONTO YOU! I KNOW YOU'RE MAKING THIS DIFFICULT ON PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF ME!""

&gt;[What.] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/740b8dea298f5118487d17f3b61f0999/tumblr_mi9zw8CN3N1qlvwnco1_400.gif) At this point, people are staring and I am trying to usher her to the door to avoid embarrassment. 

&gt;Whoever said that faith can move mountains is wrong.

&gt;""YOU KNOW I'M PRETTIER THAN YOU AND YOU'RE AFRAID THAT IF I LOSE THESE LAST FEW POUNDS THAT YOU'LL LOOK EVEN UGLIER NEXT TO ME, SO YOU MADE THIS WHOLE FITNESS THING IMPOSSIBLY HARD TO MAKE ME TO QUIT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I TRUSTED YOU!""

&gt;Unlike the heaving ham in front of me, I actually go to this gym and shouting like a lunatic in front of people I will see again is not on my to do list.

&gt;""Look, this is the work involved in losing weight. If you don't want to do it, fine, that's your health at stake and not mine. I know that *I'll* live to see my 30's and that's all that matters to me.""

&gt;""Don't act like you're so much healthier than I am! ThunderThighs in the room across from us (us? Since when did she become an official roommate?) told me about this modern theory called HAES, where people can be in good health regardless of their body type. *YOU'RE* more likely to have a heart attack than me because you go around straining your body like this!""

&gt;""HAES is a bunch of bullshit spread around by lazy people who don't want to put in the work it takes to lose weight""

&gt;""ThunderThighs SAID that thin people are against anything that shakes their feelings of superiority. I don't know why I ever let you and ESL pressure me to change my body. I'm so done with this.""

ESL and I have never made any comment about the way she looks and we have both actively avoided engaging her on the issue of body image, even when she throws shade and dust in our direction over how we have human-shaped bodies. 

I guess being thin in her presence now qualifies as fat-shaming. And so ends any slight exertion by Cocoa towards bettering herself. [F for effort.] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc7skwbSzZ1rosb88o1_500.gif) 

TL;DR: Cocoa asks me to help her lose weight and is poisoned with HAES while simultaneously realizing that getting fit is not all fun and games. She decides that I personally constructed the concept of calories in/calories out in order to make her quit because I'm so jealous of her womanly glory. 

From this point on, it all just becomes a downward spiral of weight gain and nastiness. [Next time] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i98ez/the_fatshion_designer_iii/) on The Fat-shion Designer, Cocoa gets stranded at Target and tries to seduce my romantic interest with her sensual jiggle."	t5_2vzax	True

He reluctantly agreed. I dressed up nice and spiffy and went down to the housing office. A charming 20-something athletic male was working the desk (thank god it wasn't a hamplanet!) and as I explained what happened I could see him becoming more concerned by the minute. Finally, when I was done, he said ""That doesn't sound like a safe environment. I'll move her to an apartment across the complex.""

THANK YOU FPS! Without your encouragement I probably would've just dealt with it. Now, hopefully I'll never have a story to post about Moose again :)

Edit: Since I got a couple of people asking, I just texted her about it. I said: ""Moose, I just wanted to let you know that we won't be moving in together this year. I really enjoy living by myself, and I talked to the DOR (department of residence) and they have moved you to another apartment. I wish you the best of luck."" 

EDIT 2: YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE IT. Well, you probably will. SHE CAME INTO WORK CRYING! She never replied to my text message, she just waltzed into work LATE and crying. The secretary immediately jumped up and ran over to her asking ""MOOSE oh MOOSE whats wrong honey!?!?"" Moose says, ""Nobody LOOOOOOOOOOVES ME sniff sniff tear tear.""

I went over to them and said, ""Moose, does this has anything to do with me not wanting to live with you?""

Moose: ""YEEEEEES WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO BE MY FRIIIIIIEND I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NIIIIICEEEEEEEE.""

Me: ""Well, Moose, like I said in my text, I like living by myself. So, you're in the same apartment complex in YOUR OWN APARTMENT. There's nothing to be upset about. I just have the whole apartment to myself and filled with my furniture, and I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH ANYBODY ELSE."" 

Moose: SNIFF SNIFF ""Well I guess that's OK then. AS LONG AS I CAN COME OVER AND HANG OUT WITH YOU!!! TEEHEE""

I channel all of your encouragement and alpha up: ""MOOSE listen to me. I like you, but I just don't have time in my life right now for another friend. I also don't tend to have people over to my apartment, particularly people who FEEL ENTITLED TO MY FOOD. So you will not be invited over. Now I have to get back to work.""

I'm not truly sure if this is full-on fatlogic, so I apologize in advance if it is not. Also, I can't really do green-text, so I'm just going to tell this old-school narrative style.  

Now, a quick background: I'm a hobbyist photographer.  I don't do it professionally, but some have said I have a bit of a knack for it.  Since this was a wedding, and I was a guest, I hadn't planned on bringing my camera.  I like to just sit back and enjoy the open bar.  However, my brother-in-law called me a couple days before hand and asked if I could bring my camera because the photographer would be at the bride's house before the wedding but they also wanted some photos of the groomsmen getting ready.

When I dropped my wife off at the bride's house, I got my first look at what I'll refer to as the Fatographer.  This guy was probably 5'10"" and around 400-450 lbs (could be more, I am bad at guessing weight). His gut hung way over his pants and made his tie looked ridiculously small since it barely reached half way down his stomach. 

I left my wife there and went to the groom's place. My wife recounted his actions at the bride's:  

After crossing the street, he walked in already winded and drenched in sweat. He sat down in a chair in the center of the small living room (making it difficult for the seven women who were trying to get ready to get around him), snapped a couple pictures from the chair (bad form because you're always aiming up), then stood up to get photos of the bridesmaids coming down the stairs.  He only took **one** exposure of each bridesmaid before settling back into his chair. So, I hope he got it right the first time...

When I arrived at the venue for the wedding (country club), he was waddling down the stairs, coming from the room where the bridal party was ""hidden"" (can't see her before).  At first I thought he had changed shirts, but upon closer inspection I realized that he had been sweating so much that his once light-blue shirt was now stained a dark navy-blue. My wife follows him down the stairs and hands me a beer (she knows me well).  

Fatographer, while staring lustily at my beer: WHEW! THOSE STAIRS ARE TOUGH! I COULD KILL FOR ONE OF THOSE, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M WORKING.

He waddles away and my wife tells me that he's only been upstairs once so far. 

Once down the stairs, he proceeds to sit on a couch in the foyer (that poor upholstery).  As guest start to come in, and handshakes and hugs are given to ""long-time-no-see"" relatives, where is the Fatographer?  Still on the couch, mopping up his brow while occasionally taking a shot from a sitting position. He looks winded, he looks tired, and he's only been there for 20 minutes.

15 Minutes before the ceremony, the bride and her ladies are still in their little room upstairs. I'm at the bar (also upstairs) when I'm approached by my wife, ""Have you seen Fatographer?  The bride is pinning flowers on her family members (mom, dad, grandmom, etc), and she'd like to get pictures.""

I go and look for him and find him on the same couch in the foyer, staring off into space.  I call down from the second floor landing that the bride would like to get some pictures upstairs.  

He eyes the stairs, looks at his watch and says ""I'M NOT SURE IF I HAVE ENOUGH TIME. THE CEREMONY STARTS SOON, AND I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT UP THOSE STEPS BECAUSE OF...(wait for it) MUH KNEES.""

He's going to miss this quintessential moment (one the bride is specifically asking to capture) because he doesn't want to climb stairs for a second time?!? That's his job! 

Whatever, at least I have my camera. So I go in and take the best pictures I can.  Thinking there would be an actual photographer there (not just a hamplanet with a ""fancy"" camera), I didn't bring anything more than my DSLR with the ""kit"" lens (cheap lens that comes with the camera body, but the most versatile one I have at the moment). But I guess something is better than nothing.

[This part isn't really a FPS, but more about the quality of his gear]

As I'm heading back down the stairs to go outside and sit for the ceremony, I see him waiting for the bridal party to appear so he can take some shots of them going down the stairs.  He gestures towards my camera, ""WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?"" asking about the make and model.

I rattle off the specs before I look to see what he's got.  Now, I'm not a pro, but I have friends who are and will give me pointers, one of the most common being that, when working and event, you should have several different lenses on you. Preferably a couple prime (fixed) lenses as they are usually a bit better quality and have a wider aperture range than variable (zoom) lenses.  This guy has the same crappy variable kit lens as me and an old external flash (non-adjustable). No gear bag, no extra lenses, no light meter. He didn't even have a spare battery! He was utterly clueless when it came to what type of file format he was shooting in (jpeg vs. RAW) and had, at best, a tenuous grasp of the basics of photography (ISO, f-stops, shutter speed).

[End photo rant]

The not going up the stairs thing is what really rustled my jimmies, but here are a couple more things that annoyed me throughout the night:

He apparently forgot about his no-beer-while-working policy since, when we went out on the country club grounds for pictures of the wedding party, he drank four beers within seven minutes (gotta replenish those fluids).

At the reception, he took almost all of the photos of the couples first dance from a sitting position, not putting any effort into getting himself in the right position. 

During the best-man/maid-of-honor speeches, he pulled a chair out onto the dance floor and took more photos while sitting down, and then would **drag** the chair around the dance floor to so he could sit in it from another angle.  It's hard hear well-wishes for the bride and groom while a metal chair is being scraped across the ground.

When it was time for the bride/dad, groom/mom dances, he was no where to be found. Same story when they cut the cake. After all the cake-to-face smashing was done, I looked around and realized he was in line for the buffet.

He missed a lot of good moments due to his laziness and unwillingness/inability to move around and get in position.

Luckily, between me and another guest who brought their camera, I think that there are good quality photos of most of the important moments.  I just hope that my brother-in-law and his new wife didn't pay too much for the ""professional"".

1367942848.0	1dv9u8	Shame of Thrones , a tale from a castle	minque	467	77	54	"First post on here, I had to share but am too tired to do first time greentext.

I ( F, 5'10 and 160bs) work in a beautiful 14th century castle in the hamungously chubby land of England. In the castle we have many stunning antiques, including a collection of historic chairs.

Be me! Lady Minque, taking a guided tour of about 30 people.
Am instilling wonderful history into their dear little brains.

We get to the part of the tour where I point out a set of 17th century carved wooden chairs. At this point I select a girl from the tour (choosing carefully based on what weight the chairs can take) and get her to sit in a certain chair- then I reveal that our Queen has sat in that chair and this makes the girl very nearly a princess!! (The little girls love this).

Suddenly a booming voice comes from the back of the tour.. 'Can I have a go in the chair?'

I look...  The voice is coming from a woman who is the same height as me but must weigh 350lbs!  There is no way I would let her sit in ANY of these chairs. I say that no, only the girl gets a go as we need to get on with the tour.

She makes chuntering and muttering noises as we move to the next room, in here are some very delicate Regency chairs, no one ever sits in these as they are so fragile. 

Voice booms out again. 'Well how about THOSE chairs? Can I have this turn?'

I stammer a bit and explain no-one can use those chairs, conservation etc blah blah.

Voice booms 'you would have let someone sit in it! It's just because I'm larger! You should let me sit in one!'

And I shit you not, she sought out EVERY historic chair and asked if she could sit in them, I said no every time. She didn't want a sit down as evidenced by the fact she didn't sit in the modern chairs we provide for elderly/disabled; no she just wanted to make a big sweaty point by doing what I let an 8 year old girl do.  

:(  she kinda annoyed the rest of the tour and they did all glare at her, hurrah.

Sorry for any grammar etc errors, I'm exhausted and on the bus home."	t5_2vzax	True
1376080600.0	1k1rx0	The final woeful story from a hospital employee. Saved the worst for last [Warning: Gross &amp; Long]	vondahl	464	73	101	"Although I came across more than a few morbidly obese patients during the year I worked in the medical field at this bariatric center of excellence, I only came across a handful of patients who really stood out above the rest. Worse than the usual, ""Ow, the tourniquet is pinching my endless rolls!"" And definitely worse than the people bitching that I wasn't the person with the food cart.

This particular experience happened when I was working as a transporter and not as a phlebotomist like my other two stories.

Transporters are the people who take patients from their rooms to go get X-Rays or CT scans and the like, and then back to the rooms. We also transfer patients from one unit of the hospital to another, as well as discharging patients via wheelchair.

Depending on the patient's ambulatory abilities, we'd use carts/gurneys, or just unlock the brakes on the bed wheels and push the bed itself. 

I got a lot of smack working in transport. I am average height, and pretty thin. A lot of the bigger patients would say that someone else should push them because I'll never be strong enough, blah blah blah. However, I was able to do my job just fine!

Except for this one day. This one day, I wished I was a body builder.

It was a fairly slow day. We're all sitting in the break room, and I got a page since it was my turn. The patient was in the Medical unit and needed to go to the GI lab via his bed. Bed jobs require two transporters, so my friend coworker gal (short, stocky, really strong bitch - SB from now on) offers to help.

We go upstairs to Medical (top floor) and grab the patient's chart. The info is on a need-to-know basis. I don't know WHY this guy is in the hospital, but I do need to know his name, birth date, oxygen flow, and his weight... Holy shit.

His weight. Over 500lbs.

Even in this ham-friendly environment, I'd never came across someone that big before. SB and I exchange a glance. We are so fucked. 

We go into his room and see this sedated pile of melting swiss cheese with some hair on top, barely fitting into the biggest capacity bed we have. The nurse gives us the go-ahead, and SB decides to pull and tells me to push. She starts pulling on the bed, but it won't budge. Check the brakes, they're unlocked... fuck.

After much pushing, pulling, and grunting, we finally get this hamplanet (he takes the word to a new level) moving. The elevator feels so far away at this point. With normal bed jobs, you give a hard push to get some momentum going, and then just guide the bed. Not this one, though. We are giving it everything we have, and it's going at a snail's pace. 

Finally get to the elevator and to the floor that has the GI lab on it. What a surprise, this guy has gastrointestinal problems... The GI lab also happens to be at the end of one of the longest hallways in the hospital.

I think I might be crying at this point, but I can't tell because I'm sweating too. We are out of breath and my limbs might give way at any second.

Finally, FINALLY we get to GI and leave this quarter-ton blob with the nurses. SB and I crawl back to the break room, covered in sweat, demanding that the men take this guy back upstairs when the job comes through. Fuck equality. They're stronger and I am not embarrassed to admit it. 

Now, a couple days go by and I don't hear/see anything about lardbeast. I had all but forgotten at this point. I got paged for an unrelated job on the floor that has the neuro unit, and the ICU. 

As soon as the elevator opened, I walked into a wall of shit smell. Ugh. Now, I've smelled a lot of shit. I've been in the room while people shit themselves. I've helped hold up rolls so the nurse could clean them off like zoo animals. Out of all the shit that I have smelled, this was the worst. It was... oh god. My eyes were watering and I thought I was going to vomit. I made a mental note to ask my dad (an ICU nurse) if he knew what that smell was since he was working this day as well.

Do my job, get home, dad comes home a few hours later. We're eating dinner, and I ask him about the smell that destroyed the entire floor for the entire day. The ventilation is really bad in the old hospital...

SO apparently the ICU had a new admit today. Huge, HUGE whale comes in. He came into the ER a few weeks ago with stomach pain, but they couldn't find anything wrong so they sent him home with pain meds. Found out he was constipated. He had had a couple enemas from his local doctor's office. He had an enema from the nurses in a different part of the hospital. Still constipated. He had another enema from the GI lab, too. 

I ask my dad if the guy was in the 500's, he says yes. I happened to remember his name, and we confirmed that this was the same patient that I had taken to the GI lab. He was sedated because he was in a lot of pain with the extreme constipation, I guess.

My dad says that he was the assigned nurse for hambeast 500 that day. He had inserted a rectal catheter (sorry, can't remember the proper name.) As he was in the room, checking vitals and IV lines and medicine, he hears this dripping sound. 

His back to the patient, he looks to see if the IV's or the sink is leaking. The dripping is getting faster. It's splashing. Turns around, sees a river of shit cascading off the bed. Guess the flood gate catheter wasn't strong enough to hold back weeks of constipation and enemas.

He calls for help, and a couple more nurses come quickly. The bed, the whale, the sheets, the floor, *everything* is covered in shit. One of the nurses calls for housekeeping to come NOW. 

One of the lovely ladies comes with her cleaning cart, but stops dead in her tracks when she sees the disaster, sees shit leaking out into the hallway. She mumbled that she refused to do it, so she just left the cart with my dad and his coworkers. 

The nurses roll up the legs of their scrubs like they're going clamming, and they start trying to soak up the shit with all the towels they can find. 

I will never, ever be able to appreciate the strength in stomach that nurses have. I almost puked just walking onto the floor, and here these men and women are in the room, literally covered in shit, cleaning up, and laughing about it. I have the utmost respect for nurses...

Anyway, they get everything cleaned up. Took well over an hour. Dad is back to normal, checking machines, doing his nurse thing. 

Dripping.

He winces and slowly turns around to find that this guy was not done yet. Another river of shit starts splashing all over the place. My now, my dad's scrubs are already covered in shit. He had previously taken and thrown away his socks, and washed his crocs, so now there's just shit all over his feet too. 

Rinse and repeat. Shit waterfalls, nurses covered in shit, hose off the elephant, change the sheets, etc. Took another hour or so. I asked my dad how he and his coworkers could just *laugh* at this. I guess sometimes you just laugh so you don't lose your fucking mind.

I was confused when my dad had called me from work and grimly asked to grab socks and pants out of his closet before my shift started that day. Everything comes full circle, one way or another.

**Waaay TL;DR - Encounter 500lb whale, forget about him, then a couple days later, smell this awful shit that wrecked an entire floor in the hospital. Ask ICU nurse dad, turns out the beast was constipated for weeks, had multiple failed enemas, and finally exploded (twice) sending shit rivers from his bed, all over the entire room. He died the next day.**"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Be waiting around with bros getting ready to go to pregaming for the weekend.

&gt;Everyone is excited to see my new car so they crowed around taking turns sitting in the car, mirin its aesthetics and dat dere leather, and first world car technology. All is good.

&gt;Thirstybro finally comes along, (he used to be a bit chubs, has made it now. But the reason I call him Thirstybro is his willingness to do just about anything for some tail.)

&gt;In this case, he brought along potatosack and her two hot friends. (Potatosack is called that because she often liked to wear clothes that literally strangled her body which made her look like... well, [this](http://galleryoftheabsurd.typepad.com/14/images/2007/09/10/sack_2.jpg).)

&gt;One cute girl exclaims ""ooooo fluttersoshy~ your car is so nice can I sit in it?""

&gt;Now being one to show off I raise the suspension, it served no purpose to help pofato get in the car but it got some oohs and ahhs. (My misteak, heh steak)


Some of you may be wondering: ""but flooterssoshy, why let her in you betafag?"" because good 'ol redditor of mine, I wanted to keep lumpypotatos happy so TB could get his jr. wet. Last time sacky didn't get any from me (another story) she took her friends and left 2 hours into the party.



&gt; After showing her the car and having a good portion of my passenger seat covered in a thin layer of grease she decides to get out but her knees required that extra inch of help. 

&gt;""DIS DA BUTTON TO RAISE THE CAR?"" oh god, with one fell swoop of her grease covered fingers she messed with the suspension button. Now my car has air controlled suspension and is notorious for running into problems with it, and combined with her 300?400?miniature planet? lb frame, it seemed like too much for my baby.

&gt;Potatosack's lips begin to quiver and starts blubbering ""But your parents have money~ and it's not my fault your car can't handle my weight. And I needed help getting out of the car because of my knees"" And begins sobbing to her two hot friends.

She's wearing brand new workout clothes, new sneakers, makeup fully done, et cetera. Oh, and she's also drinking a liter of coke and watching ""Teen Mom"" at top volume.

I say fuck it and hop on the treadmill, eyeballing her the entire time. I run for fifty fucking minutes, while she just sits there on the bike, not pedaling; she continues to chug her coke.

For those who haven't seen my [first story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1di0h8/my_first_experience_with_hamlogic/), I used to work in a grocery store. My stories don't correlate with each other, so you don't have to worry about reading anything out of order. If you want greentext to happen, I'm warning you, it's not going to happen.

Be me, 18, still working in shitty grocery store. (Fuckthisgayearth.gif) Working as normal, putting up displays and joking around with awesome boss. Enter regular customer hamplanet, who we'll call Curve Queen (CQ). This woman is about 6', 380 lbs, maybe more. Always uses her EBT card to buy the worst possible food. I don't think she ever went near a produce section in her life. CQ wasn't ever all that bad, but she did make it her personal goal to flirt with every male working in the store while she shopped. It got to the point where the men of my store would run in terror and hide somewhere customers weren't allowed. On this particular day, the only man aside from my boss that was working in the store was a cashier that I happened to be dating at the time (we're just gonna call him BF because I am not very creative). I think you can see where this is going. No one except our boss knew we were dating (he saw BF pick me up from work one night and asked me about it the next day); we liked to keep things on the down low at work because we didn't want to deal with any drama from our other coworkers. The boss didn't give a shit as long as we did our work and didn't “disappear” together while we were supposed to be working.

On the way to the checkout line, CQ stops to flirt with my boss. She makes many passes at him even though he has clearly stated that he is married. Says he needs to experience a real woman (teehee!). He just ignores her after a bit and she moves on to her next victim: my boyfriend. As she is unloading her groceries onto the conveyor belt, she lets out a very loud “Haaaaaaaiiiiiiiiii cutie! I haven't seen you around in a while! How YOU doin'?” My boss and I glance at each other and he just shakes his head. Lol like I'd do anything, BF is a grown man that can take care of himself. The boss and I casually move to a different display near the checkstand area so we can get a good listen.

CQ: “So, cutie, you got a girlfriend? If not, I'm available whenever teehee!”

The boss and I suppress our laughter and make gagging faces at each other then suppress more laughter.

BF: “I do have a girlfriend, she's a very lovely lady.”

[MFW](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/oh-stop-it-you.png) I get called a “lovely lady.”

CQ: “You don't have a girlfriend, you're lying! Why won't you go out with me? Is it because I'm big?”

BF: “No ma'am, I really have a girlfriend. And I don't have any intention of dating anyone else.”

CQ: “Oh yeah? Show me a picture of her then!”

I see him pull out his phone and panic for a second, but then remember the only pic of me on there is one from a birthday party where my face is hidden by a shadow from an overhang.

CQ: “Why are you dating some anorexic bitch? You need to get with a real women like me, I have nice curves for you to hold on to!”

At this point it takes all the willpower in the world for my boss and I to suppress our gagging and laughter. We almost lost it when she referred to herself as “curvy”.

BF: “Disrespecting my girlfriend is no way to even begin winning me over. I don't appreciate you calling her anorexic, especially since I know she isn't. If you're going to keep being rude, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.”

CQ huffs and snaps, “Whatever, I bet she's a bitch anyway. All skinny women are bitches, that's a well known fact! She's even got you so whipped that you are too afraid to break up with her for a real woman!”

At this point my boss and I have migrated down an aisle and are nearly in hysterics. I can see BF looking around for someone to back him up, but everyone else has fled from the sight of this behemoth. I nudge my boss and motion that he should go over there because if I do she might view me as a threat and eat me. Boss goes over, asks CQ to please not talk to his employees in that fashion. Says she is being malicious and needs to stop. I walk back over near the register and pretend to be working on a display.

CQ: “And what about you, do you have a boyfriend?”

I look up and realize she is talking to me so I just nod and go back to pretending to work.

CQ: “I don't know why any guy would date you, you're waaaaaaaaaay too skinny! You need some meat on your bones gurl, your man isn't going to be happy for long if you don't ever eat!”

Without thinking, I blurt out, “Well, obviously I'm doing something right seeing as how I'm the one that has a boyfriend.”

CQ begins to move toward me and I instinctively reach for my box cutter as I am cornered. The boss and BF move in her way because they know I will cut a bitch to get out of being cornered.

CQ: “I'll knock your skinny ass out! How dare you back sass me, you ain't nothin' but an anorexic little bitch!”

Me: “Why don't you just leave? You're only embarrassing yourself.”

CQ pushes past my boss and my boyfriend and I make my box cutter visible. She backs up a bit and just stares.

CQ: “You wouldn't...”

Me: “I don't like being threatened and I don't like being cornered. Now, either go pay for you groceries or just leave.”

CQ goes back to the register to pay for her heaps of chips, candy, and soda. BF is trying not to laugh as he rings up the rest of her stuff and my boss and I go outside for a much-needed cigarette. (Yes, I used to smoke, no, I don't anymore. Get off my tits.) After watching CQ get in her car and drive off, we go back inside to let BF take a break. I teased BF for the next week about him needing a “real, curvy woman” and he teased me about needing to eat more. Every time CQ came in after that day, BF and I would just glance at each other and crack up.

TL;DR I will cut a bitch

In case you're interested, my other story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dij6m/the_deviled_egg_massacre/)

EDIT: Yes, I know I could have gotten fired or worse if CQ had complained about me pulling my box cutter on her. I'm more surprised than anyone else that she didn't complain or call the cops. I guess complaining wastes too many calories and she didn't want to lose her curves."	t5_2vzax	True

**Chapter Thirteen**

Lauren looked at me with a mixture of surprise and concern. “Porcina didn't tell you she has a boyfriend? Wow, usually she likes to play the jealousy card.”

A hurricane of questions circled in my mind. I picked one at random and voiced it. “Why was she posting on Craigslist in the first place?”

“They have an *open relationship*,” Lauren stated, making air quotes with her fingers. “To *hold them over* during *college*.” She looked at her hands as though they were entities separate from herself. “I'm not sure that last part needed emphasis.”

I laughed out loud at that. “Probably not,” I replied. I picked another question. “Do you think this boyfriend knows about me?”

“Oh, almost certainly,” Lauren replied. “Like I said, Porcina plays the jealousy card pretty often.”

Not to mention pretty ineffectively, I thought. Tales of saucy one-night stands did not, to my mind, make for an interested lover. I wondered about the character of a man who would date Porcina. Maybe it was a fetish thing, or a desire for domineering women? “What's he like?” I asked, realizing that the answers might be readily available.

“Quiet,” answered Lauren. “Short. Kind of awkward. He's *way* too obsessed with video games. Like that Warcraft one.”

I was (and am) something of a gamer myself, though I hadn't given WoW any attention. It had only been released about a year before, and besides... the monthly subscription was more than I could comfortably afford. “My old roommate used to play it,” I replied. “He was pretty addicted, too.”

“It's not my thing,” Lauren said. “So, yeah, he's coming to visit. Porcina should lose interest in you then.”

“And after that?” I queried, hoping the positive trend would hold.

Lauren shrugged her shoulders. “After that... probably. As long as she doesn't think *you're* interested.”

“Trust me, I was *never* interested.” A warm tingle of anticipation climbed up the back of my spine. “Not in her, anyway.” I turned so that I was completely facing Lauren, and looked into her eyes. “Would you still like to go out sometime?”

Like it had the evening before, time stood still... only this time, no waking nightmare surrounded me. For a moment, I remembered the look of anger I had seen on Lauren's face, but I quickly dismissed it as having been annoyance with her roommate. Lauren met my eyes and narrowed her gaze, as if trying to read the images in my brain. I didn't know whether I was grateful or disappointed that telepathy was an impossibility. 

“Well...” Lauren began, her face completely impassive, “I'm not sure.” It wasn't a no. I latched on to that thought. *It wasn't a no*. “You seem like a decent guy.”

“I'm trying to be,” I promised... and I realized that it was true. Memories flashed in my head of previous conquests and mates. I was not, I knew, possessing of an especially immaculate history. I'd been lazy with my relationships and callous with my partners' emotions. I had haunted Craigslist like a marauding spirit, ready to swoop down and whisper whatever half-truths would lead to nudity. There had been a few special women, sure: The Russian immigrant who was impossibly smart, but whose intentions I had misunderstood. The outgoing freshman whom I'd inadvertently stifled, then driven away with my criticism. The opera student, so full of ambition, whose temper I couldn't be bothered to handle. More names and faces sprang to mind, and with each passing visage, I realized:

I had been a *dick*.

There was no way, I decided, that I'd ever mistreat Lauren. “I don't want to pressure you,” I said, “but I do think you're really great. I know this hasn't been the *greatest* start... but maybe we can try again?”

Lauren kept her focus locked firmly on my eyes. Then she blinked, looked away, and took my hand. “Okay.” My heart leapt. “I'll tell you what.” … and paused in its ascent. “After Aaron gets here – that's Porcina's boyfriend – we can go out to dinner. She'll be shacked up in her room with him. I'll need to get out of the house.”

“Sounds great!” I exclaimed. “The date, I mean. Not the... other thing.”

“You pick out the restaurant.” Lauren's smile returned. “I'll pay for my half.”

The next week was a blaze of color, and everything was wonderful. I told everyone who would listen about my upcoming date with Lauren, and received halfhearted congratulations in reply. This girl, I insisted to them, was different! *I* was different! My trials at Porcina's hands were like a distant memory, a forgotten childhood fear that vanished with the light. By the day of my date with Lauren, I had pictured everything from passionate lovemaking beneath the stars to tears of joy shed after the words “I do.” She was the *one*! My soul mate! My truly significant other!

She was, as it happened, my companion in catastrophe.

I woke up the following Monday with a smile on my face and butterflies in my chest. *Today was the day*! I showered and shaved with a song on my lips (which can actually be rather dangerous, depending on the brand of razor), ready to meet the morning with an enthusiastic laugh. I had talked with Lauren sporadically, and only via text message, explaining my seclusion as stemming from a desire to have abundant conversation at the ready. She, of course, agreed with my plan. I reached for my phone and let my thumbs fly, intent of describing what our future had in store.

“Good morning!” I wrote to her, my eagerness no doubt evident. “Are you ready for tonight?”

“Morning!” came Lauren's reply. “Sure am!”

“How are Porcina and Aaron?” I asked.

“Ugh.” No further words were necessary.

“I can imagine,” I sent next, “but tonight should be fun! I hope you like Indian food?” I had found a nearby establishment with an appropriately exotic atmosphere. Their booths, according to their description, were each draped with velvet curtains and illuminated by candlelight. A bit much, perhaps, but I wanted it to be memorable. This was our first date, after all, out of many more to come! I had even gone as far to ensure that several vegetarian options were available, on the off-chance that Lauren didn't share my taste for steak.

“Love it!” she replied. “See you tonight!”

Class was dull, as it often was, but my mind stayed active and engaged. I imagined Lauren and I laughing and sharing stories, and culminating the evening with a kiss. I had decided, for once, to take things slow and steady, to keep from rushing towards the bedroom with my pants around my ankles. A later date might be different, but tonight... tonight would be pure. I moved from building to building, following my schedule out of habit alone. I checked my phone every chance that I got, though I wasn't sure what I was expecting. A tiny part of me was afraid of a last-minute cancellation, but such thoughts evaporated each time I reread Lauren's messages.

“Sure am!”

“Love it!”

Even “Ugh.”

Nothing could stop me now!

Nothing, that is, but the worst news of all.

“Bad news,” came the message, and the world turned to ice. I froze with it, unable to believe what I was reading. She *was* canceling. This was terrible! I wondered if my enthusiasm had simply been too much, and it took no small amount of mental struggling to remind myself that Lauren hadn't been a party to it. Although, what if one of my friends had told her? What if I'd accidentally sent a message to her that had been meant for somebody else? I scanned through my outbox to be sure, trying to find the source of my folly.

I came up empty.

“Oh no,” I finally replied. “What's wrong? Do you have to cancel?”

“Maybe,” responded Lauren. “How do you feel about a double date?”

I've been trying to lose weight I gained for about a year and a half now, and yesterday when I weighed myself I came in at 202, which is the lowest I've been in quite some time.  I was by no means giant at any point, but I wanted to show that everyone is susceptible to fatlogic.

I was supposed to go to the gym but due to intense concentration on internet surfing, I found myself looking at the clock in Starbucks (skim milk, smallest size) and it being 30 minutes before the gym closed. *That's ok* I told myself. *You can lift tomorrow*.

And then I thought about how it's the little decisions that add up.  So I decided right then that I was going to do one of my other workouts, either running or P90X ab ripper, when I got home. Went with P90X, woke up this morning with a good kind of sore.  Fuck yeah.  Trust me when I say that workout makes you sweat.  It's not just situps, it's your whole core.

But then after grazing a bit I was really hungry.  I had just come in at my lightest weight in a long time, and there were a few goodies I bought for my lunches at work.  If I had just one, it wouldn't be so bad.   I went into the freezer, reached in...


...and made myself some brussels sprouts and a protein shake.  Because it's the little decisions that add up.  To be fair, I actually enjoy brussels sprouts because I'm just that kind of messed up.  But I countered my own FL twice yesterday.  And I woke up feeling very good about that.


I think this is the most frustrating part of FPS.  It's people constantly saying over and over, ""I can't do this.""  YES YOU CAN.  It's just work.  It's the decisions you make, every single day, that add up over time.  You have to be conscientious about it and it has to be *important* to you.  And that's why I find HAES, TP, and all of the other stuff so harmful.  It's the equivalent of meeting your friend after an AA meeting and saying, ""one drink wouldn't hurt"".  If that person is trying to get better, support them.  You're not a bad person if you're overweight; you're a bad person if you try to stop someone from improving themselves.

[Hammey and the Cookie Jar](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1em5ze/hammey_and_the_cookie_jar/)

I'll try to keep this one a little short. This event happened Monday after the barbeque event. 

I left to the office a few hours early so that I had time to take my dog with me on a hike during daylight hours. I hurried home, and changed to be on my way. Sure enough, I see a huge pickup in my driveway, and Hammila slowly creeping up to the house. I was certain that she was still upset over the barbeque event the day before, but I fought the urge to hide and not answer the door. 

Hammila:""Heeey! You're home early! I was wondering if I could borrow some flour and sugar from ya?""

In her hand was a dirty ziplock bag. I agreed to give her some sugar, but I had run out of flour. She helped herself inside, and sat at the table while saying
 ""Well, I can use the sugar at least. Do you have any coffee made?""
 
Me: ""Oh, do you need to borrow some coffee too? I don't have much, but...""

Hammila: ""Naw, I mean to drink while we visit. You have some made, right?""

At this point I was annoyed. I didn't want to be rude, but I didn't want to encourage her behavior. I told her how I was on my way out, since today was my day to take the dog for an extra long walk. 

Hammila: ""I'll only be here a minute. Make us some coffee and grab me that sugar.""

I started to make the coffee and made it a point to ask, ""Does it matter if I use water from the tap, or would you prefer filtered?""

Hammila:""It's all the same to me. I don't need no' fancy filter water.""

[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/angry1.gif) water in coffee is okay, while she is allergic to plain water.

I made her a cup of coffee and retrieved a cup of sugar for her. While I was in the pantry getting her sugar, she decides to root through my fridge to look for creamer. When she doesn't find any, she complains how ""No'ne should drink the coffee black. It doesn't taste good without cream."" I try not to murder her while fetching her sugar, and let her know that I drink my coffee black without cream or sugar. She looks at me like if I declared myself the Anti-Christ. 

Cue her rants about how she hates everyone in town. She complains about all ""those old husband-less hags"" and how they are all jealous that she has a husband (Silver's husband passed away about 5 years ago, and one of the others lost her husband last year). I cut her off and ask about her daughter (who we will call Sunflower). 

Hammila: ""Well, Sunflower never talks. She doesn't care about nothing at all. She is going through her rebellious years, like all young girls.""

This is the point where I [realize that she is dumping the sugar directly from the pyrex measuring cup into her coffee.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bites-fist.gif) At this point, she has the cup 2/3rds coffee and 1/3 sugar. She carries on the conversation like nothing has happened. 

Hammila: ""I heard sunflower tell her father that you allow her over to play with your dog whenever she wants.""

Me: ""Oh, yeah. I hope it's not a problem. I see that she really likes animals, and my dog can use the extra playtime.""

Hammila: ""Who can complain if you want to be a free babysitter? I'll send over her schoolwork and you can help her with that too."" 

I notice that the coffee is gone, and all that remains is a thick layer of sugar. Hammila is trying to drink the rest of the sugar out of the cup. I offer her a refill, but she denies. Instead, she drags her finger along the cup, and ate the rest of the sugar.

I see her husband was waiting in the driveway, so she quickly transfers the sugar from the measuring cup into the dirty ziplock that she brought with her. 

Hammila:""Mind if I use your bathroom before I head out? Seems like my morin' coffee is fightin' with me.""

Me: ""Oh. You wouldn't want to keep your husband waiting though, right?""

[MFW I dodged that bullet](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/firework.gif)

Sunflower showed up a little while later. She didn't say a word, just went to the back yard to play with the dog. I left her carrots and an applesauce for a snack, and she was gone by dusk. She left a thank you note on the clean plate that I left out for her. 

TL;DR:Hammila comes over to borrow sugar. She pours 1/3 of the cup in her coffee and scrapes out the undissolved sugar and eats it. Wants to use my bathroom, I make excuses. Also, I agreed to be a free babysitter to her daughter. Shocked when her daughter proves to be a million times more polite and thankful than her beastly mother.  "	t5_2vzax	True

Thursday was the finial meeting before taking the case to court. Both lawyers sat talking legal mumbo-jumbo while I try to follow the conversation.  During break my lawyer gave me the tl;dr: Captain Beetus doesn't want to go into courtroom litigation because that would become an easy access public record that could be used in his custody battle.

That's right, I could basically name my price.  It includes: covering the therapist for 3 months, covering the 2 doctor visits, some emotional damage compensation, and (my favorite) anger management class.  He wasn't happy about that last one.

On to the beetus juice!
&gt;Be me working the host desk a few days before Christmas.

&gt;In comes Santa.

&gt;Wearing jeans, Harley-Davidson shirt, full grown white beard, and a Santa hat.

&gt;6'1"" 300+ lbs. Looks like a tall Santa.

&gt;He is waiting for his wife to show up to have dinner.

&gt;Sheepish little kid sees him.

&gt;Works up to courage to ask if he is really Santa.

&gt;Santa says yes.

&gt;Kid ran off all excited.

&gt;Returns with his sister.

&gt;Every kid in the restaurant had a chance to talk to Santa.

&gt;Santa's wife comes in and plays along with it.

&gt;Must be a normal thing for them.

&gt;Only request a table after every kid has had a chance to talk to them.

&gt;Warm fuzzies for the rest of my shift.

tl;dr: Santa came to town. Not all fps are bad.

Edit for clarification: Nothing has been legally agreed to so both cases are pending.  It was an attempt to get the criminal charges dropped.  The reason for both Civil and Criminal courts is this: Unless there is an actual account of damage he is found guilty of, it is hard to get compensation for doctor/ therapist visits.  Emotional damage is even harder to get.  The official plan was to get a guilty in criminal court then go to civil for the compensation. Unofficially, I'm not going to drop the charges but use that for a plea deal then slip a post-it to his soon to be ex wife.

As for the confusion with lawyers, my neighbor is a state prosecutor and long time friend. he agreed to prosecute in criminal and represent me in civil because it is a ""easy straightforward case""

Hope this clarification helps.  Even if the criminal goes off smoothly, the civil case will be a ways off."	t5_2vzax	True

For the purposes of the story, the friend within it shall be called SkinnyCop (Thin and policeman). Lets get started.

&gt; Be SkinnyCop and I, fairly fit as we cycle and swim a lot.

&gt; Been out shopping for the day.

&gt; Buy all the games!

&gt; Decide we some Macbeetus to keep our blood sugar up.

&gt; Enter the fast food joint discussing our hopes for the days haul.

&gt; Suddenly the lights begin to flicker, the earth begins to move and somewhere, someone screams.

&gt; Did we just walk into a horror movie?

&gt; We turn, seeing the monster about to devour us all.

&gt; Nope, just a landwhale, charging towards the counter like her life depended on it.

&gt; About 300-350lbs, 5'5 and folds squeezed into short shorts and a tank top.

&gt; SkinnyCop feels ill. So do I.

&gt; Land whale shoves us aside and continues towards the poor employees.

&gt; Being British, we remain silent and merely passive-aggressively glare into the back of her head.

&gt; Clearly someone forgot the age old tradition of queues.

&gt; Begin to witness the order that broke MaccyD's.

&gt; ""I want -insert list of artery clogging food the length of your arm- and be quick, I feel faint!""

&gt; Is she trying to feed a small village?

&gt; Terrified employee scurries off to deal with it.

&gt; We get to order, being polite to the cashier as whale begins to complain about how long it was taking.

&gt; Gets half her order, begins to unwrap and eat it at the counter.

&gt; ""HURRY UP, FUCK YOU GUYS A SLOW""

&gt; See food churn in the blackhole, turn away feeling sick.

&gt; Don't eat with your mouth open! Manners! Are you even aware of our strongest trait!?

&gt; See's me roll eyes in disgust.

&gt; ""DON'T JUDGE ME, I NEED THIS OR I COULD BE IN DANGER!""
 
&gt; What from? Food stealing ninjas? 

&gt; But the beast wasn't finished, now I had caught its attention.

&gt; ""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE, TO HAVE FIGHT TO STAY ALIVE CONSTANTLY""

&gt; ""I have quite bad asthma and a lot of food allergies""

&gt; No! I engaged in conversation! Curses!

&gt; ""THAT DOESN'T COUNT""

&gt; Wat?

&gt; ""I HAVE THE BEETUS! IF I DON'T GET THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FOOD, I COULD SERIOUSLY HARM MY HEALTH!""

&gt; SkinnyCop pipes up ""That's not the right amount of food""

&gt; Her piggy eyes zero in on SkinnyCop.

&gt; ""AND HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU KNOW?""

&gt; Without a word, SkinnyCop pulls out his insulin.

Side note: SkinnyCop really hates it when he sees fat people using the beetus as an excuse when they clearly haven't got it when hes had it all his life. He still manages to maintain a healthy weight.

&gt; ""I'm type 1, if anything you're type 2 and making it worse by eating that amount of food, that amount of sugar would kill you""

&gt;be me, 22yo, 6'4, 190lbs

&gt;in grocery store, going down the aisle with rice and stuff

&gt;all of the sudden, the lights flicker, the humidity the air increases, the linoleum floor begins to fissure

&gt;I turn around to see a wild hamplanet, probably 5'0, 350lbs, pushing her little moon in the cart, probably about 4yo but already at an alarming weight

&gt;she's inhaling the last bites of a king sized hersheys bar

&gt;I keep doing my thing, checking out different asian marinades for chicken when I see in the corner of my eye, the porkupine throws the wrapper of the candy bar behind the cans of enchilada sauce

&gt;lolwut

&gt;alphamode engaged

&gt;""are you kidding me? Are you not just going to leave that there? In front of your own kid? That's some piss poor parenting!""

&gt;she freezes, takes a deep breath, and just starts screaming.

&gt;now, being in the south, I was expecting a slow speaking southern accent.

&gt;I was wrong

&gt;I couldn't place the accent, but my best guess was boston, and my God, the whale's mating squeal was one of the loudest, squealiest, most obnoxious sounds known to Man. I do not believe I can convey the way she spoke via text, so I will not try

&gt;""DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY CHILD. I BEEN RAISING CHILDREN LONGER THAN YOU HAVE BEEN ALIVE. YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR DAMN MOUTH OR I'M GOING TO GET SECURITY TO REMOVE YOU! AND WHERE THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT MY CANDY WRAPPER, THERE'S NO TRASHCANS NEAR HERE""

&gt;""why are you even eating in a grocery store? Can't you wait until you are in the car?""  So I've been reading fps for awhile, so I asked I received the answer I was looking for.

&gt;""I HAVE A CONDISHUN! I WOULD'VE USED A SCOOTER BUT MY BOYFRIEND WOULDN'T TAKE THIS KID FOR THE AFTERNOON!"" at least she didn't leave the kid in the car in the southern heat...

&gt;""YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW HOW A HEALTHY PERSON LIVES, BUT I HAVE TO EAT WHEN WALKING, OR I WOULD DIE! THE PAIN ON MY KNEES IS ENOUGH, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LITTLE SHIT LIKE YOU, TOO""

&gt;Wailord uses Waddle Off

&gt;I go to the enhcilada sauce and pick up the wrapper she threw behind them. As iput it in my pocket, a thought crosses my mind

&gt;""Did you pick that candy bar up here, and did you pay for it,"" I ask from about a quarter of an aisle away.

&gt;she turns around slowly

&gt;""THAT IS NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS! YOU SHOULDN'T JUST GO SNOOPING AROUND LIKE THAT, THAT'S RUDE!  AND WHAT IF I DID? IF I DIDN'T I WOULD DIE!""

&gt;""you know that's stealing, right?""

&gt;""NO IT ISN'T, IT IS ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO DENY ME THAT. IF THEY HAD, I WOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL AND I WOULD SUE THEM FOR EVERYTHING THEY GOT""

&gt;Holy fatlogic batman

&gt;""PLUS I BOUGHT ENOUGH STUFF THAT A DOLLAR CANDY BAR DOESN'T MATTER. I'M A LOYAL CUSTOMER AND I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT FROM YOU""

&gt;can't believe she talks like that in front of her kid

&gt;mfw I have no face

&gt;I just walk off frustrated and grab the rest of my stuff. When I get to the cashier, I let her know what just went down. She tells me that she'll talk to the manager and he'll check the security footage, but there probably isn't much they could do.

1373063246.0	1hpt48	The Fat-shion Designer	LadyDragQueen	469	85	92	"Hi everyone, let’s all take a moment to observe the obligatory introduction about how I've lurked for awhile, love all of you, and decided to post a story. I've never used greentext before and I'm feeling rather apprehensive about it. But I will not let it stop me. [Onward!] (http://images.persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dont-fuck-it-up-gif.gif)

This story took place almost a year ago, when I was a freshman just going away to college and so excited about all of the people I would meet. Little did I know that I’d come to regret meeting a lot of them.

&gt;Be 18 year old me, 5’3 and 115 pounds (125 when wearing makeup) of drag queen trapped in a female’s body. Not very toned (working on it!) and looking pretty average.

&gt;Just moved into freshman/sophomore dorm, waiting to meet all the fabulous people

&gt;Don’t be roommate, ESL, who is a sweet and *very* skinny international student with a somewhat poor grasp of English. 

&gt;Also don’t be suite-mate KaiKai, chubby, seems nice enough. Kind of uppity but nothing unbearable and we only have to share a bathroom and living area with her anyway. She has a single room, so we luck out with only 3 people to a 4 person suite. *Or so we think.*

&gt;Three of us go to awkward move-in-day “getting to know everyone” dorm party. KaiKai is a sophomore so she already knows bunches of people. ESL and I are hoping she can introduce us and maybe be friends all around.

&gt;[MFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4cj6d98w11qgb5p1o1_500.gif) we walk in and there is a very large proportion of very large people. 

&gt;Don’t want to judge anyone right away; try to make nice with everyone. Some people seem really cool. Maybe this dorm thing will turn out to be fun.

&gt;Suddenly beverages start trembling in glasses

&gt;The room goes dark as a mysterious mass eclipses all light sources

&gt;In the distance, a solitary scream of pure terror rings out.

&gt;5’6, approximately 300 pound pile of “real woman” ambles over and casually throws her entire mass directly into KaiKai.

&gt;KaiKai, though knocked off balance and winded, seems genuinely happy to see the planet and promptly introduces her to us.

&gt;”This is my friend Hot-Cocoa Chanel, she’s a sophomore too. We were roommates last year and she’ll probably be spending some nights in my room too so she’ll be around a lot.”

Note: What we didn’t yet know was that this means Cocoa was essentially going to be moving the fuck into the suite, eating our food, and ruining all of our good times.

&gt;First thing Cocoa says to me and ESL: “We’ll have to invite y’all over to the room for our movie and snack dates, you two are way too thin.”

&gt;THE FIRST FUCKING THING SHE SAID

&gt;THE. FIRST. THING.

&gt;Ignore derogatory comment. “Yeah that would be awesome; we’d love to hang with you guys.”

&gt;desperatetomakefriends.exe

&gt;”We’re having dinner together after this, you guy should join us.” She slowly glances us up and down. “You DO eat at least occasionally, don’t you?” 

&gt;[MFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/62fd53a78a03080946fcda2832ad4b5b/tumblr_moejl9bHh61riy0uno1_400.gif) 

&gt;By this point I am literally biting my lower lip in an attempt to not say anything (don't want to burn bridges with people who want to do sociable things with us) so ESL steps in and says ""Yes, we love have dinner with you. It will be much fun. What is your major?"" in an attempt to change the subject from how we're starving ourselves to death.

&gt;""I'm studying *fashion design.*"" 

&gt;[OFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/ebbc7dc44090be3a60dc415fc50723db/tumblr_mgtyj7TEAH1rosb88o1_500.gif) she's wearing a neon green tank top with a black/red zebra striped skirt. 

&gt;""I want to design fabulous clothing for curvy women instead of catering towards the unhealthy sizes you see in most stores."" 

&gt;Reaches out and starts pinching my shirt around the boob area

&gt;""You need to put on some weight so you can fill out this shirt with some cuuuuurves. Men don't like women who look like ten year old boys. I'm gonna have to feed you up at dinner""

&gt;""YEAH OKAY THANKS, ESL and I are going to go around and meet some other people in the dorm now. Come get us when you guys want to go to dinner."" 

&gt;Walk around, talk to lots of people, find out that almost everyone cool lives on a different floor from us. 

&gt;After awhile, ESL looks around and says ""Where KaiKai and the round one went?"" 

&gt;Nowhere to be found. 

&gt;Ask around, some chick tells us that KaiKai and Cocoa left to have dinner. Without us. After all that lip-flapping she did.

&gt;Fast forward to later that night in the suite. KaiKai and Cocoa come rolling in while ESL and I are getting to know one another.

&gt;""Why you two leave to dinner without us?""

&gt;KaiKai looks uncomfortable. Cocoa looks legitimately offended that we questioned her.

&gt;""WELL YOU GUYS WERE ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ROOM AND I FIGURED WHY WASTE TIME GOING TO GET YOU WHEN IF WE JUST LEFT WE'D BE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE DINING COMMONS.""

&gt;[OFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma1qqz0e6j1rosb88o1_250.gif)

&gt;""LOOK WE'LL DO IT SOME OTHER TIME. I DOUBT YOU TWO WOULD EAT ANYTHING ANYWAY.""

&gt;She then proceeds to walk away from us and start making a sandwich.

And that concludes the first evening of my college experience. It was just a small taste of the story-laden semester of hell that was to come. 

TL;DR: New college suitemate has hamplanet fashion-designing friend who poises herself to essentially move in. She brands my roommate and I with a scarlet ""A"" for ""anorexic,"" invites us to dinner anyway, ditches us, and then get defensive and justifies it by claiming we'd rather just starve.

**Chapter Seven**

“I was,” Lauren told me, looking only slightly abashed, “*incredibly* drunk last night when you got there. I was honestly afraid that I was going to throw up the whole time.”

Something didn't add up. “Porcina told me that you dropped her off at the restaurant, though.”

Lauren nodded. “Yeah, I did... and I was feeling pretty pissed off at her. I decided I was going to get rip-roaringly drunk, like in the movies, and tell her off when she got back.” She gave me a sheepish grin. “I guess it doesn't quite work like in the movies. I just felt sick.”

“First time being drunk?” I asked.

She shook her head. “No, I've been drunk before, but never quite like that.”

I wanted to hear more – about anything she wanted to say, really – but I knew this was my chance to get the real story about the night before. “So, why did Porcina use your... your picture?” I asked.

“Like I said, I've been drunk before.”

I furrowed my brow. “I'm not sure that I follow.”

Lauren sighed and rolled her eyes. “We got drunk together a little while ago, and we took sexy pictures of each other. College, right? Only, we used Porcina's camera, so she still had them. Last night, she wanted to post on Craigslist, and she told me she was going to use 'the pictures we took.'”

Everything seemed clear, then, and Lauren confirmed it for me: Rather than asking for direct permission – or using the pictures of herself – Porcina had said the barest amount necessary to absolve herself of responsibility in her own mind. It was only after I had responded that Lauren had learned the truth, and by that point, the damage was done. Porcina's excuse had apparently been “Nobody can see your face!” and Lauren – not wanting to ruin her roommate's chance at romance – had reluctantly agreed to play chauffeur.

Now, there are any number of things that I *could* have said. I could have expressed sympathy. I could have scoffed and remarked about the good luck of my having car. Hell, I could have simply apologized again and offered to make it up to her. Instead, I resorted to my old, stupid sleaze, and simply stated, “Well... for the record, they *were* very nice.”

Back again was the blushing beauty, staring at her shoes. “Thanks,” she said... and her hint of laughter again gave me hope. I reordered my thoughts and hurriedly tried to make up for my mistake.

“So, listen... apparently I have to take Porcina out tonight, but... can I take you out sometime later? I figure I owe you that much.”

Lauren looked up at me then... and smiled. “Sure,” she said. “But it will have to be on a weekday. Porcina was right, I *do* work pretty late on weekends. I pull double-shifts, first on the floor and then stocking.”

“Sounds tiring,” I replied. I dug into my pocket and pulled out my business card. (Yes, I carried a business card, and no, I wasn't employed. Laugh it up, lard-butts.) “Here's my email address and phone number. Drop me a line when you can, and we'll set something up!”

“Thanks,” she said again. Then she hugged me, and walked briskly away.

I was happy. No, I was beyond happy. I was *elated*. I was *overjoyed*. Against all expectations, against all odds, I was...

“*There you are*!”

… I was found. Goddamn it. I turned with a plastered-on smile to see Porcina standing on the outside of the aisle. Though she likely could have fit between the shelves, it would have been a bit of squeeze, and she had (perhaps wisely) decided to call at me from a less confined space.

“I saw Lauren walking away from here,” Porcina said brightly. “Did you find your *boooooook*?”

Goddamn it again! “Uh, no,” I answered. “Looks like they don't have it.” I walked towards her, like a man on his path to the electric chair, and braced myself for another rib-crushing hug. It came as expected, though it wasn't enough to stifle the tiny spot of warmth in my heart. *Lauren*, I silently thought, *nothing can keep me from you now*!

“So, what are you doing today?” asked Porcina.

I shrugged. “Not much.” Immediately after the words left my mouth, I regretted them. Before I could account for my error, though, Porcina had pounced on the opportunity.

“*Really*?” she squealed. “That's *awesome*! We can hang out *all day*!” I tried to protest, to go back on my word, to hastily remember a clumsily forgotten engagement... but it was all for naught. I felt my hand taken in the grasp of the beast, and I was led from the shelves back towards the cafe. “Let's get something for the road,” she suggested. Naïve as I was, I thought she meant another drink. Instead, I bore witness to the slaughter of the cafe's food selection. Porcina helped herself to several ham sandwiches, another round of pound cake, a few mystery items wrapped in white wax paper, and a handful of complimentary mints, all of which – save for the mints – were handed to me to carry. Thankfully, with Lauren being absent, Porcina decided that she would pay for the load, and I watched for the second time as several crisp bills were pulled from a white envelope in the young woman's purse. Upon being presented with her change, she unceremoniously dumped the coins into the nearby tip jar, gave the kid behind the counter a sweet smile, and said “Maybe you can afford some better *shoes* now.”

Personally, I hadn't even noticed his shoes... but they looked fine to me.

The day that followed was a disaster. Porcina led me from the bookstore and into the nearby mall, where she settled into a predictable routine: First, she would huff her way through a randomly selected store, where she would loudly critique the merchandise. When an employee would inevitably approach, Porcina would treat them to a condescending explanation of why their stock was sub-par. We would leave shortly thereafter – with me offering silent apologies – to find a bench, upon which Porcina would plop herself and dig into her rapidly dwindling food supply (which I, for some reason, was still carrying). On those rare occasions when a store had items to her liking, Porcina would remove them from the shelves, hold them up to herself, and then dump them on the floor. (She did the same thing with the wrappers for her food, incidentally, and scolded me when I deposited them into trash cans that were never more than a few feet away. “That's why they have janitors!”)

I know not how many hours I spent escorting this repugnant juggernaut, though I suspected that my spine would never recover from its prolonged exposure to mall benches. We must have visited every store, every outlet, and given the same impression to every employee that we encountered: *We are the heralds of your misfortune*, our presence likely said, *a modern Marley and his chains, sent to foster pain upon thee for transgressions gone unnamed*! We left a wake of fear and frustration, and I felt I was partially responsible, if only by my presence beside the wrecking ball.

There was, however, a glimmer of light amidst the darkness that my existence had become. As the last sandwich was being consumed (and followed by a pilfered mint), a tiny noise escaped the purse kept perpetually pressed against Porcina's paunch. From within its confines, she withdrew a sleek cellphone, which I recognized as the (original) Motorola Razr. (It was all the rage back then, the must-have phone for anyone in the know.) Porcina answered with her mouth full, treating her caller to the same child-like voice I had come to dread.

“*Hellooooooo*?” she said. There was a pause, followed by a gushing exhalation from the girl. “Oh my god *no way*. No *way*! Tonight? Like, *tonight* tonight? No way! No *fucking* way! Oh my god *yes*, I'll *fucking be there*!” This went on for awhile, during which time I considered making an escape. As the call ended, Porcina turned to me with an apologetic look. “I'm *sooooooo soooooorry*,” she said, “but I have to *doooo something* tonight.”

“No worries,” I replied, doing my best to hide my relief. I did *not* ask for further information... but she provided it all the same.

“This girl from my *class* is getting *married*, and she's going to her *party* tonight. I *have* to be there to *support her* because it's *such a special occasion*.” She offered me a pouty smile. “I'm *sowwy*. Pwease *fo-give* me?”

“Like I said, no worries!” I was barely listening, wondering as I was if Lauren would be open to a late-night meal. Had I been paying more attention, I might have noticed that all was not right with the world.

“Oh, you're *so sweet*!” squeaked Porcina.

Then she kissed me.

In all my days, and out of all the many kisses I've experienced, that one still ranks as the worst. It was a pungent, slobbery mess of tongue and lips, each of which were coated with slimy globs of masticated food. Had I returned her affection, I have no doubt that I would have swallowed more than a few of the offending morsels and possibly died of utter disgust. (Also, a passing youth's cry of “Get a room!” did very little to preserve my good mood.)

We exited the mall shortly after, though my dignity lagged behind a bit. Porcina's house (and Lauren's!) was only a few blocks away, but she insisted on taking the college's shuttle. “We walked so much today!” she explained. “My feet hurt!” My own feet, on the other hand, were quite ready to make a spirited retreat. I bid Porcina farewell – narrowly avoiding another kiss by turning my head into a strategically planned position – and hurried away, thoroughly relieved to be alive and free. I considered paying another visit to the bookstore, but decided not to risk overstaying my welcome. Instead, I returned home, feeling weary and drained... but excited. 

My day may not have gone *precisely* as I had planned, but on the whole, it had turned out well. I had been granted a respite from Porcina, made plans (to make plans, I guess) for a date with Lauren, and arrived back at my apartment with a sense of satisfied pride. I had solved the mystery of Lauren's breasts (though I was looking forward to further investigation), offered my confession, and been absolved. Sure, there were some loose ends, but I could tell that a final escape from my harrowing time with Porcina was, at last, in sight.

Oh, how wrong I was...

Hello, my blubber queens and kings. I wasn't planning on posting any Hamthrax for at least another week because of work, but yesterday I was once again accosted on the track by Stephen KingSized. I'm so angry that I have to post a second part to this story. GOD I hate this woman.


Before I start, Here's something I've realized about NYC hamplanets. Living as an obese/overweight person is markedly more expensive. The costs of food, comfort, and clothing are greater. In a place like New York, where walking is the main mode of transportation, and the culture of the city is geared to thinner, more athletic people, hamplanets have three choices: 
1) shed the logic and the pounds

2)hide away and eat themselves into a coma

3) spend ever fiber of their being and cent in the bank defending their lifestyle

That third demographic is particularly volatile. They are fighting against the tide, with only their tumblr paddles and spherical bodies to battle the thin-privilege current.


Okay, lets get into it 

[Oh Romeo, Romeo, where art thou diabeetus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fceqj/william_milkshakespeare_at_the_track/)

&gt;be me

&gt;be not carrying out a good running regime over past couple of weeks

&gt;doing more strength training/ bike riding

&gt;can't run a 5k anymore :(

&gt;be upset, but determined to get back to it

&gt;C25k to the rescue

&gt;decide to follow the program from the start

&gt;head over to the track

&gt;gorgeous weather, hot but windy

&gt;about to rain

&gt;get on the track, start alternating 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking

&gt;look up to see a familiar curtain of long black hair

&gt;god damn it. 

&gt;sure enough it's Flabamir Nabokov 

&gt;walking with a fellow hamplanet (let's call her Breditor) as fast as their tree stumps will allow 

&gt; as I pass her I can see the 32 oz Dunkin Donuts iced coffees in both of their hands

&gt;yet both are in full workout gear….

&gt;why do you need a sweatband for a stroll with beverages?

&gt;quickly avert my gaze

/rant/ Here's the thing about this track I don't like. The surrounding area is a public park, and is filled people cooking food, riding bikes, and letting their kids run around. Kids playing soccer sometimes spills over onto the track. This annoys me to no end, but again, its a public park. /rant/

&gt;kid kicks a soccer ball into my path

&gt;get it, turn around to kick it back

&gt; Franz Kafcake's eyes meet mine, and a look of recognition flashes across her face

&gt;continue jogging until 60 seconds is up

&gt;start walking

&gt;hear a loud snort behind my back

&gt;don't look because I know who it was

&gt;silently hope Anne Rice Pudding is snorking on her coffee

&gt;""Breditor, you know what's really unfortunate?""

&gt;your blood sugar levels?

&gt;""What, Ernest Hemingweight?""

&gt;""The fact that I'm a fat fucking pig with nothing better to do then harass other people""

Fucking lol, nope. wouldn't that be amazing though. 

 &gt;lament not bringing music

&gt;"" Young girls nowadays don't love themselves. They push their bodies to unhealthy levels, then can't even exercise properly.""

&gt; ignore them, my 90 seconds of walking are up

&gt;pick up into a faster jog

&gt;Lemony Snickers huffs loudly as I speed away

&gt; I'm at my limit, with the heat and the feeling of eyes on my back

&gt;assume they won't walk more than one lap, so I'm safe

&gt;finish my 20 minutes with eyes looking straight in front of me

&gt;maybe Stefatnie Mayo-r and her breditor went back to their blogs 

&gt;nope. 

&gt;not by a long shot

&gt;Adipose Huxley and Breditor are sitting on the sides, glaring at me

&gt;hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng they're eating hot dogs from the vendor outside the parks gates

&gt;I can't even process it

&gt;go to water fountain nearby

&gt;hear the squirrels scamper up their trees

&gt;god. freaking. damnit.

&gt;PrimeRib Levi has followed me to my spot, with Breditor in tow

&gt; I'm so sweaty and achey from lifting the day before, there is no way I won't snap

&gt;""Um, so I see you haven't taken my advice.""

&gt;""Sorry?""

&gt;""You're the girl who I talked to a while ago, about HAES.""

&gt;""Uh, yeah I remember. I also remember telling you I wasn't interested in any of that stuff"" 

&gt;""Well, you obviously have no regard for your own health. But I would really appreciate if you would stop portraying such a *negative energy* here""

&gt;""I have no idea what you mean""

&gt;Breditor chimes in ""Your outfit, for a start""

&gt;look down at my spandex shorts and workout shirt

&gt;….

&gt;Jack Kerofat nods frantically, chins wobbling

&gt;""completely inappropriate, not to mention shaming""

&gt;THEY ARE LITERALLY SLUT SHAMING ME AT THAT VERY MOMENT WHAT

&gt;Breditor shakes her head and turns to her counterpart

&gt;""This is exactly what HAES is about. Loving and respecting yourself. You were so right about her""

&gt;I'm so tired. I can't deal with this

&gt;Assume the worst: stress fracture (fairly common, not so difficult to do when running 80-100 km/wk)

&gt;Be waiting in a private patient room

&gt;dust starts falling from ceiling tiles, chair rattling across the floor, medical posters falling off the wall

&gt;ohshit.gif

&gt;this is it. it's the big earthquake we're due for. I learned about this in my natural disasters (EOSC 112) class!

&gt;duckandcover.exe

&gt;NOPE!

&gt;It's Dr. Ham in all her rotund and succulent glory!

&gt;Dr: Hi westcoastcora, I'm Dr. Ham

&gt;Me: Hi.... (eyes as wide as dinner plates, can't believe this woman is a doctor. Scrubs clinging unattractively to an endless number of dimply rolls/muffin-top, pants pleading for an incinerator)

&gt;Dr: Says here you have pain in your foot, why don't you take a seat and I'll have a look

&gt;comply because afraid of being eaten for breakfast

&gt;JK! there's clearly maple syrup, ketchup and crumbs on her scrubs - perhaps the sad remnants of Dr. Ham's morning cafeteria raid?

&gt;Dr: have you been doing any activity that might have caused this injury?

&gt;Me: Well, I run 5-6 days/week and I increased my milage over the past month to ramp up for half-marathon season

&gt;Dr: *wrinkles nose* ... You're lucky we have a specialist in today for this kind of thing. I'll call her in when we're done here.

&gt;At this point I'm thinking the sports specialist is in and I'll get this all figured out today! But wondering what offended her to the point of nose-wrinklage...

&gt;NOPE

&gt;Dr: You know, running that much *ISN'T HEALTHY FOR YOU,* westcoastcora, you're destroying your body.

&gt;Me: But... the rest of me is fine... I just have pain in my foot...

&gt;jimmyrustle.avi

&gt;Dr: We'll see what the specialist has to say...

&gt;Dr. Ham leaves, gravitational forces in the room return to universal norms and I start to calm down after my jimmies return to a managable state

&gt;waiting for specialist

&gt;5 minutes

&gt;10 minutes

&gt;*knock knock* ""Hi westcoastcora, I'm Dr. BabyTalk, may I come in?""

&gt;called her Dr. BabyTalk because talks to me like talking to infant

&gt;tell her to come in. apparently have had the HamTeam assigned to me this morning... Dr. BT is a mini moon, maybe 5'1, nearly spherical around her waist.

&gt;Dr. BT: Dr. Ham said you need some help with a pain you're having, I'm going to do everything I can to help

&gt;think I have fallen into an alternate universe where I'm in palliative care or something. That's how this woman is talking to me.

&gt;Me: yeah... I have this pain near my baby-toe... but kind of on the side of my foot... Are you the sports specialist?

&gt;Dr. BT: Is this really about your foot, westcoastcora, or do you hurt *inside*? (while saying 'inside' she reaches out, grasps at the air and makes a pulling motion towards her chest)

&gt;At this point I'm irritated and want to get this over with, whether she's the sports specialist or not (and by this point I'm kinda assuming not)..

&gt;Me: No. My foot hurts and I'm afraid I have a stress fracture. I just want help for my foot pain.

&gt;Dr. BT then goes into a 15 minute talk about 'taking care of myself' and not 'running my body into the ground' and a LOT of priming questions about anorexia and bulemia.

&gt;Dr. BT: We're trained to recognise the signs, westcoastcora, and we think you have a problem. Your weight is concerning and it sounds like your eating habits are very restricted. It's okay, you can be honest with me, this is a *safe place* (as she said ""safe place"" she spread her arms and pulled the air into a 'self hug' gesture).

&gt;allofmywuts.rage

&gt;Me: I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this, and this is not what I'm here for. I didn't come for counseling, I came to find out if I can run with this foot pain.

&gt;DR. BT: Because Dr. Ham referred me to you, I need to clear you to return to your studies, or your student status will be suspended.

&gt;WTF. ACADEMIC SUSPENSION BECAUSE SOME HAM-DOCTOR THINKS I RUN TOO MUCH/HAVE AN EATING DISORDER.

&gt;Spend next 15 minutes answering and filling out psych evaluation so I can keep on studying and finish my degree.

Total of about 2.5 hours in the patient room... Biggest waste of time. evar. Luckily, it all turned out fine and the pain cleared up over the next week.. I went to my friend (a physiotherapist) and he figured it was minor ligament damage. I never went back to the student health centre after that... Too much jimmy rustlage to endure another encounter with the Ham Team.

**TL;DR - two Hammy docs team up to diagnose me with an eating disorder and over-exercising, and subject me to an unwanted psychological evaluation. I went in for foot-pain.**

1368241824.0	1e3z0u	Hammila and the Jar of Preserves.	Wolfsong013	448	69	61	"Hello all! I have plenty of stories to tell, and now that university of done for the semester, I have the time to share with you. This story is the most recent, so I thought I would start here. So grab yourself some icecream, since I don't want your sugar getting low during our adventures. 


I just finished another semester at University. I'm a recovering galaxy myself, down from 280 to 220. I work in antiques, usually with research and online sales. Basically, my employer sends me the things, and I get them ready for auction. I was surprised when he offered me a position in the office (since I work primarily in the city, and he is in the countryside). This meant that I would spend the summer in a tiny mountain town. My lease was up, and my dog certainly would enjoy time in the mountains, so I decided to move. 


I just got everything inside my new place. mountaincabin.win. Scurrying around, I started the task of unpacking and making the place livable. It was midmorning, and I heard a knock at the door. I was greeted by 3 old ladies, all carrying housewarming gifts. We were exchanging our greetings when Hammila starting shuffling over. 

Hammila is short, but big. [Imagine this, but standing less than 5 feet tall](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-10255-body-shape.htm#img). She wasn't as much walking, as she was swaying back and forth. She had her daughter with her, who looks about 10, and thin. Poor thing probably just gets the scraps left over from her mothers feeding. We can hear her complaining through gasps that she ""was missin' guud tv for this"".

At this time, the ladies were showing me what they brought. They had brought a few baskets of root vegetables, and one brought her homemade bread and preserves. Hammila introduces herself, and give a bear hug with it. Unbrushed, rancid teeth smell, mixed with BO, I had to do my best to not vomit. letsburntheseclotheslater.yes. 

Hammila snaps at her daughter to give me their housewarming gifts. I can tell that there is some tension between the old ladies and Hammila. Hammila had given me a half bag [of these](http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj246/munzer90/IMG_1123.jpg) while explaining ""I had some in the car, and my daughter wouldn't stay out of them."" (Later, I found those wrappers all in my driveway. It seems that she needed the nourishment to walk the 200 feet up the driveway). I thanked her, and watched the drama unfold between Hammila and the old ladies. 

One of the old ladies (She had really long grey hair, so we'll call her Silver) scoffed at the gift of a half bag of chocolates. Hammila quickly snapped at her ""Oh, and you think she'll use those plants? Sh'just takin' 'em to be nice!"". Silver mentions that normal people eat veggies unless they want to be ""a manatee, with less mobility"".  Silver and the other ladies take it as their cue to leave. (They came over a few hours later for tea and to tell me the Hammila stories that have been collecting over the last 10 years) 

Hammila looks victorious as the others leave. Almost immediately, she sees the bread and preserves. Without breaking eye contact with the bread, she mentions ""It's rude that you haven't offered me coffee, or snack while I'm your guest!"". I stood there shocked, and stammered out that my kitchen isn't put together yet, and apologize. I asked her to give me a minute to find a knife, and I'll cut the bread. I ran downstairs, grabbed my kitchenware, and returned. 

While I was gone Hammila decided to ""rip"" the bread so she could get those delicious calories faster.
""I didn't think you'd find a knife, so I helped myself, heehee"" A little under half the loaf was on the table, while the rest was quickly being devoured. 
[MFW I noticed that she used the almost the entire jar of preserves on her ""slice""](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OMG-bird.gif). I offered her daughter a slice, where the silent girl smiled and nodded yes. When that happened, I was told between mouthfuls ""No, she doesn't need it. She don't need all the sugar.""

I apologize, and tell her that I should get back to unpacking. She gives another sweat-filled hug and thoughtfully tells me ""to make sure I have coffee ready next time guests come over"". She waddled out of the house, and I could hear her yelling at her daughter in the driveway. 

A few hours later, Silver came over. She told me that Hammila was telling everyone within earshot about how close we were, and how excited she is to have someone in town that isn't a stuck up bitch. Silver warned me that I'll have more interactions with Hammila, and guaranteed they will go as smoothly as this one. 


I'll have more stories as they happen. I'll also post Silver's most memorable moments dealing with Hammila. "	t5_2vzax	True
1363805968.0	1aohjw	Fating on the Train	ladyuniscorn	450	60	44	"Waiting for the train with my headphones on, it is an off time and so there aren't huge lines of people on the platform. Spy a fatty with a cane and a granny cart near me.

Train pulls into the station, nearly empty. The doors are wide enough for two lines of people to enter at the same time, there are even signs on the ground indicating that this is how it should work.

I stand next to the fatty and wait for the doors to open, proceed as normal to get on the train...

Fatty rage is incurred by attempting to board along side her, hits me in the shins with her cane. ""I AM DISABLED YOU SKINNY BITCH! YOU CAN'T CUT, I GET TO BOARD FIRST, I NEED A SEAT!""

I normally am very quiet and mind my own business, but she had the gall to hit me and proceed to yell at me. Rip off headphones, rise up to my full 6', make eye contact with death my eyes, and commence Fat Shaming: ""What the fuck! You fucking hit me you fucking rude bitch! The train is empty, you can have any seat you want and there is enough room for two people to fit through the goddamn door you fat cunt!""

Fatty is stunned, her eyes are bulging and she is beat red. Can't bring herself to say anything else with the entire train of 10 people staring at us. Fatty retreats and manages to walk all the way to the other side of the train in shame, she walks just fine and doesn't use the cane. The look of death is continues until she off boards at the next station.

TL;DR Fat cunt tries to use fat privilege, goes terribly wrong, retreats in shame."	t5_2vzax	True
1373387303.0	1hxycw	My experience in the South (thin privilege and other things)	Shprintze613	455	67	125	"Hey FPS,
This isn't really a story about a specific HP (I'm fortunate enough to not really know any) but I did just observe some things on my recent roadtrip to Nashville, TN (I'm from NYC for reference).

At one point, we went into a diner for lunch. There was the option of the all you can eat ""salad bar"" that had more pasta than salad. The waitress told me that in addition to my order, I could pay an extra $3.99 and have the unlimited salad bar.

Well, I took the option. I told her I wanted it and she left me a plate for it. I put some stuff on my plate, and saved room for the main course, which I couldn't even finish.

It was then that I spied the fattest family I have ever seen in my whole life. The fat was spilling over the chairs, keeping them away from the table by like a foot and a half. I kept trying not to stare, but it was hard. The woman who noticed me looking was giving me death glares.

When I finished in about 15 minutes, I went up to pay. The waitress didn't charge me for the ""salad"" portion, because I only took one plate.

I left her the 3.99 extra on her tip.

Thin privilege is not being charged for an all you can eat bar because you ""only took one plate"".

On our way home, we stopped at an amusement park that rhymes with ""hollywood"". The amount of obesity that was rampant there was astronomical. The scooter to person ratio was about 1:3.

While disembarking one of the coasters, I hear a voice behind me. A 10 year old (ish) girl was talking to me. She was pretty chubby, probably 30 pounds overweight for a 10 year old.

She was asking me if I liked the ride. After talking to her for about a minute, I noticed she was alone.

Me: Honey, did you come here alone? 

Her: No, my mom's waiting for me downstairs. She couldn't fit on the ride. She just had ""the surgery"". But it's ok, I meet people this way.

Me in my head: Jesus, this poor girl. It was 2 days ago and I'm still thinking about it.

I hope one day she makes it. I caught a glimpse of her mother, she defnitely did not fit on the ride.

&gt;Boss is a big jolly Irish guy 

&gt;Genuinely a lovely bloke, always talking about his wife, kids and friends.
 
&gt;But his eating habits, my god his eating habits. 

Bare in mind I'm not small, at the moment I'm 6'3 270 pounds after losing 30 pounds in the last 4 months. But I've never seen anyone eat like this.

1365553248.0	1c10yz	A Hamplanet Judging Others In Orbit		458	79	80	"Let's get this out of the way: I am fat. Actually, I am obese. No, actually I am morbidly obese. I have struggled with obesity from the time I was a child, and after having two kids myself - both of which are healthy weights and have healthy diets/activity levels -  it just got worst (I is a wominz). 

I more or less maintained a massive weight without losing or gaining a pound for three years (I was 330 at my highest, 5'8). Nothing to blame but bad food and laziness. I would make sure my kids did the right things, then did the bad stuff in private. But I eventually decided enough was enough, and I started to battle through the self hatred to actually take care of myself. 

That was back in July, and as of today I have lost 61 lbs. At this rate, I should be at my final goal weight by the end of next year, including tightening and toning. I have gone down two sizes and lost all fat on my legs, most on my arms, and at least two of my ten chins. My stomach is noticeably smaller, I have real shape forming on my body, my breasts are less heavy and today I had to make a new notch on my belt, after starting out with it being barely able to contain me on the first hole.

All in all, I am pretty fucking proud of myself, and I know the pride will just keep growing. 

Now, I have a friend who is a Lardy McLardfat, just like me. She claims she weighs less than I do, but I don't think that is true. She is significantly bigger when actually standing side by side. Plus, she is just a large woman anyway...you know, those women who are just kinda 'thick', and when (if) she loses the weight, I am sure she is still going to be a giantess. Just in an Amazonian kind of way, not a jigglestep way. 

The other day I noticed that I judge the hell out of this chick. I mean, I seriously judge her HARD! Just looking at her makes me feel kind of sick, and listening to her talk about weight, her diet, exercise level, what she claims she does every day, makes me rage way more than I would have just last Spring. 

It isn't because she is fat. Hell, I am a tub of epic proportions, so I can't fault her for that. It is that she sits there and constantly (CONSTANTLY) tells me we need to be workout buddies, we should encourage each other, she needs to drop some weight, and all that jazz. But she has never maintained any discipline, not for a single fucking day. Not for a single MEAL!

She eats nothing but fast food or heavy, rich foods from restaurants. Everything she orders is jumbo size, like huge buckets of popcorn at the movies, extra large fries, triple patty burgers. When she does cook for herself, she uses a ton of oil, fries everything, consumes nothing healthy, and thinks because so many veggies are in it, it is good for her. Ignoring all the butter, olive oil, ranch and cheese she dumps on it. 

As for fitness? Bitch doesn't do anything. She talks about when she was living in Australia (US now), and how she would do yoga and go for runs all the time. I don't believe her, because she considers taking her dog for a walk enough exercise to get her by. Which she barely does, as she usually dumps the dog outside in the yard to fend for himself. 

I told her she should try breaking exercise into ten minute intervals several times a day, since her main complaint is how busy she is. That was apparently too difficult, as she hasn't tried a single workout I have sent her, or anything else. 

Why am I raging about this all so hard now? Why do I give a fuck? Because earlier today, she told me that she is surprised I haven't ""lost more weight"" by now, or that I haven't tried to lose faster. Apparently not getting the concept of me not wanting loose skin that sags down to my knees, and that health is just as important to me as image. So, you know, rapid weight loss isn't what I am going for; consistent weight loss is.

Right after she says this? She casually mentions that nothing works for her, and I am so lucky. Because she has been dieting, and has gained ten pounds in the last two months. 

I officially hate her. I seriously fucking hate her. 

Edit: You guys are right. She isn't supportive, sometimes actively tries to sabotage my progress (she once offered to pick me up an iced coffee and promised to make it skinny, then when I tried it and called her out on it not being skinny and a size larger than asked for, she just laughed and said she thought I needed it), and all around bitchy. I am no longer going to hang out with her."	t5_2vzax	True

OK! Let’s jump right in then shall we?

So I didn’t expect *that* much of an uproar over my actions last part, but I completely understand your feelings. I was a useless; disgustingly beta kid and I know that’s not right. I seemed to have messed up with Scarlett and was almost raped by KG. So, I’ll skip ahead a few parts up to a whole new Lucist. Now, my wonderful beetusy sweetlings, now I give you what your hearts crave. Alpha Lucist and Justice.

The main plot of this part takes place a few months after the events of that night, but I’ll fill you in on the few events that happened before then. I’ve cut another 15 or so pounds. Maybe even 20, I don’t remember quite well. So this puts me around the 158-162 range. I went the distance and was finally relatively fit. I even grew an  inch! Fuck yeah genetics. 

I know you’re curious about the repercussions of that night, but I’m sorry to say no Justice was served to KG or even her sidekick SH. However, Scarlett and I got back on speaking terms after a month or so in class. For the weeks before that we didn't sit together. She sat a few aisles behind me with one of her other friends. Yup, stupid beta Lucist! You’ll be happy to know it was *me* that initiated the conversation with her and forced myself down in the chair next to her. Thank you CB for the Alpha advice. 

Something about being almost raped opens your eyes to how much of a “doormat” you've been to get to that point, especially when the assaulter is a fleshy ball. The transformation from beta to alpha was an arduous one, but I made it eventually

&gt;”What’s up neighbor?” holding my hand out for a handshake

&gt;loved myself for recreating the original meeting scenario

&gt;no awkward handshake this time

&gt;fuckyeah.jpg

&gt;didn’t apologize; didn’t talk about that night

&gt;just made sure she and I could talk again

&gt;felt good because I’ve never looked this in shape in my life

&gt;remembered pacing in front of my mirror talking myself up in the morning

&gt;time goes by, we end up passing notes like we did weeks ago

&gt;figured that this was pretty good, maybe just leave it like this and not try to escalate much for now

&gt;class ends we walk home

&gt;funnily enough, trip down the staircase because I’m clumsy

&gt;thought that would bring up some bad memories so I play it off like a champ

&gt;”those stairs ain’t shit; the ones in the engineering building hurt more!”

&gt;she laughs and we leave the building

&gt;reach our complex

&gt;walk her to her door

&gt;gentlemen.bin

&gt;separate

This goes on for another month. We get seriously close and just develop a great friendship. Then I propose and we get married in the summer of our sophomore year.

SIKE!

&gt;she invites me in one day after our class because we were just having a discussion on who was better at Street Fighter and she wanted to take me on

Yup, she was a light gamer. Not a *gamer girl*, she just liked playing the fun, quick ones with friends when they came over. I’d like to point out that the old me would have politely declined because he’d call this situation “enough work for the day” and head home happily. I manned the fuck up and accepted my beautiful planets.

&gt;say hi to FitGirl who was actually just leaving to meet up with CB

Yeah, they’re dating at this point. These two were made for each other. These crazy lovers get some sort of sexual high from watching each other workout or something. CB told me how she made him do a fuckload of pushups and then jumped him right when he hit his last one. Told him I heard them, didn’t need a recap.

&gt;want to quickly hurry up into Scarlett’s room because KG might be lurking somewhere

&gt;most likely the kitchen

&gt;in luck she’s not home yet

OH! I forgot to talk about this. KG has no remorse over what she did to me. No one but CB, her and I know about that night and we both confronted her a week after. She had “ABSOLUTELY NO RECOLLECTION OF THAT NIGHT! STOP BLAMING ME, IT’S NOT LIKE I WAS IN CONTROL!” she was “COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT, BESIDES, WHY WOULD I WANT TO MAKE IT WITH YOU? ANY GUY AT THE PARTY WOULD HAVE WANTED ME, RIGHT CB TEE^HEE?”

I’m imagining your faces right now. Yup, she had a thing for CB right now after *getting over* me. She was always in the girls living room when CB and FitGirl were there (you know because otherwise, she’d be in the kitchen) and just wouldn’t let go of the notion that CB and her should be together. She even took to ~~forcing~~ asking me for my number so she can text me about CB. I’d always send her on goose chases though; she seems to have lost a few pounds because of it so I’m considering this a win. I usually ignore the texts anyway.

&gt;walk into Scarlett’s room shared with KG

&gt;try not to look at the area where I was violated

&gt;justabadmemory.raw

&gt;proceed to *lose* to Scarlett in a few games of Street Fighter

&gt;”Hey, you said you were good at this game.” She says

&gt;”Yeah I thought I was too.” I respond trying not to laugh

&gt;I swear she was just button mashing

&gt;”hmmm, let’s go again. I’ll even go easy on you this time” she smiles that amazing smile

&gt;I grin

&gt;I’ve learned how to do CBs shit eating grin

&gt;demolish as my best character, Hawk

&gt;tomahawksop.mp3

&gt;”Well, look at that.” I say losing a lung from controlling my laughter

&gt;dammit she looks pissed

*Cue Rom-Com*

&gt;tackles me and starts lightly punching my chest

&gt;I’m beyond laughing at this point. The whole situation was just really funny

&gt;she told me how she would always win high school tournaments with bison

&gt;then she stops

&gt;”You don’t like KG do you?”

&gt;shock

&gt;”CB told me what happened that night was just a mistake”

&gt;CB my bro :’)

&gt;”Yeah, I didn’t even know where she came from. She just kind of rolled onto me.”

&gt;sweet laughter

&gt;she looks at me

&gt;*kiss*
FUCKYESYESYESYEYSYEYSYSYEYSYESYEYSYEYSYEYSYEYSYYSYYYE. 

Finally, I nailed it with Scarlett, everything looking good from here!

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Earthquakes. Door slams open. The beastly, beetusy, bouncy, bullish ball has arrived to claim her dominion.

&gt;”OH HAY GIRL! HOW WAS CLASS”

&gt;sees me 

&gt;try to hide under Scarlett’s sheets

&gt;”OH! SO YOU’RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER NOW? HOW CUTE!”

&gt;Scarlett and I don’t know what to say

&gt;I look at her a give a small smile remembering the kiss

&gt;”SCARLETT, YOU’RE LIKE A SISTER TO ME. LISTEN TO MY ADVICE GURL! YOU CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THIS CURRY-LOVING PERV. I INTRODUCED YOU TO SH’S BROTHER D.J. HAMMER. HE’S A LOT BETTER SUITED FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU!”

That’s an incoming story. The day we met D.J. Hammer. Just wow. He was another planet in the Full House Asteroid Belt. Not as big as KG, but definitely full of the same brand of good ol’ beetus fatlogic.

&gt;curry-lovingperv.curry

&gt;FUCKING BROWN JOKES!

Yup, here it comes guys. Beta Lucist looks ashamed and believes the fat pile of shit coming out of KGs massive lips and escapes the room to head home and sit on his computer and write more pitiful stories in his beta diary.

LOLNOPE!

&gt;something clicks

&gt;I just kissed Scarlett

&gt;this bitch gotsta go

&gt;walk up to KG

&gt;stare her the fuck down

&gt;”You know KG. I do come from a curry- loving family.”

&gt;”My grandfather actually used to own a farm in India.”

&gt;he did. Although I’ve never met him

&gt;”You know what he kept on his farm?”

&gt;she actually looks pretty jumpy

&gt;I’m not staring at her threateningly; I’d like to think I was more amused

&gt;”Do you know what India’s sacred animal is? It’s the cow.”

&gt;”You know, you kind of remind me of one. Should I show you how to milk a cow? I’ve had years of practice when I spent time in my *curry-loving* country”

&gt;neverbeenthere.ini

&gt;”I wouldn’t want to hurt a revered animal such as you though; we usually milk the cow when she’s more *relaxed*. I’ll try to not disturb you when I spend the night with Scarlett”

2 things. First, I actually spoke my mind, because I was sick of the brown jokes. I escaped my very cultured family home to college to get away from the brown atmosphere for a while (I don’t hate my own culture don’t worry). Second, I couldn’t believe at the time how much of a ballsack I had for saying I’d be spending the night with Scarlett… in her bed.

 I’d actually like your rating on how much justice was served here. I remember this day vividly even 3 years later and I still feel I sort of cheesed out in my dishing of Justice to KG. It just seems kind of… dorky at this point.

&gt;KG on a fat rampage

&gt;threatens to call the cops on me for sexually harassing her and insulting her

&gt;yells at me to get out of her room

&gt;proceed to tell her to shut the actual fuck up or I’ll go to the cops telling them that she violated me

&gt;Scarlett attests to that, saying she was a witness

&gt;honestly don’t think she was but, meh works

&gt;she stares at us blankly with this stupid glazy look and turns around and rolls out yelling madly

&gt;you’d think I actually did get to her

&gt;a few second later we hear the fridge open and close around 8 or 9 times and a lot of pots and pans and all around kitchen noise fill up the house

&gt;she was eating it away

&gt;cow’s gotta eat

&gt;proceed to make out with Scarlett for the rest of the day

How are your freakish, ham-sized jimmies now? Happy your boy Lucist Alpha’d up? Are they still being rustled? 

I realize most of you looking for juicy justice right now are not too happy. I’m not going to lie, not much has been able to put KG down. Atleast I’ve settled the whole beta dispute at this point I hope. Don’t worry your little hearts though, there is quite a few more tales to tell of KG and some little side ones of SH. After all, KG was here to stay. She couldn’t be moved because of her condishun.

*BONUS*

KG ate all the food in the fridge (3 packs of lunchables, 4 leftover eggs, half a loaf of bread, her frozen foods like pizzas, fries, chicken patties, and a 2 liter of diet *tee^hee* soda, half a gallon of milk and various other foods that FitGirl usually keeps *healthy included*) according to FitGirl and Scarlett’s analysis of the tornado that hit their kitchen. KG had apparently gone to stay with SH for the night. Good riddance I say. Now for the best bit:

&gt;wake up next morning in a familiar floral patterned bed

&gt;try not to look across from me at poor Liam’s face

&gt;Scarlett’s sleeping next to me

&gt;holyshitIdidit.mp4

&gt;ohshit, need the bathroom

&gt;walk out quietly 

&gt;see the mirror on Scarlett’s door

&gt;damn, I actually look pretty good :D

&gt;close the door softly

&gt;look across the hall at FitGirl’s open door

&gt;see CB staring at me like I just won a medal

&gt;shit eating grin. head to bathroom

&gt;hey, I puked in here!

&gt;best piss ever

End of Part 4.

Let’s call this the end of Beta Lucist honestly. But yeah, more stories to come, but just not until the end of this weekend, heading back home for religious reasons.

Community vote for next story! 

1.	Would you rather read about how we came up with the name we gave KG? 
2.	Would you rather read about the day we met D.J. Hammer?


*EDIT*
Yeah, so I forgot the biggest reason I told this story to you. FPS, to me, is an amazing place. Not just because of the amazing stories, but the motivation it brings to you through each one. 

So, you're a beta. You're fat. You're dull. You're lazy. That doesn't mean you're stuck that way. Rather than sit there worrying about it. Get up, go for a run. If not a run, a walk then. Just get moving. Meet people. Find your Scarlett.

Hold on to your motivation. It's the only thing that'll drive you. My motivation was Scarlett and in the end I achieved my dream. 

If you have a CB in your life. Hold on to them too. CB has been one of the best influences in my life. For someone who's life is amazing, he cared about me as much as he did himself. He instilled confidence into me when honestly, I couldn't find any way to do it myself. That's why I'm renaming him *Confidence Bro* with his permission.

Good Luck my friends! :D

I was working the register, very boring job when a very very large woman in her 30's waddles up looking either very jolly or very flustered. Or out of breath. Either way she come to my register and starts waving one of our tin signs around in my face.

""YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.""

....what?

""YOU PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A CHRISTIAN STORE AND YOU SELL THIS FILTH. i HAVE YOU KNOW THAT COOKIES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY SIZE AND THAT I HAVE A VERY BAD MEDICAL PROBLEM.

Again i had no clue what she was talking about until i read the sign. It read.  ""There's a thin girl inside of me wanting to get out, but I usually shut her up with cookies!"" 

""Ma'am i dont think this sign is trying to shame anyone, its more of just a funny joke sign.""

""YOU THINK MY WEIGHT IS A JOKE?"" 

""No ma'am not at all. Im just saying some customers like this sort of stuff.""

""Where is your manager? You messed with the wrong woman!""

Luckily my manager was standing there the entire time and he told me to go help a customer and he took care of it all. 

TL:DR Big woman thinks sign about cookies was shaming her."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Be same old me, except home from college.


&gt;Haven't seen old friend High School Ham (HH) this year. Last I heard from her she was really into eating healthy and fitness. Says she's really in shape now and wants to meet up.


&gt;Decide to go shopping with her.


&gt; MFW ""in shape"" means gaining 30 pounds. Now sitting at about 5'3 180-190. Looks something like [this.](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-34941-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0#.Ucmjd5WQJUQ)

I know lots of people who got heavy at college. That freshman/sophomore 15 is srs business. But HH didn't just gain 30 pounds, she gained the fat logic.

&gt;Both try on the same polka dot dress. Looking good after losing 20 pounds.  Show dress to HH.

&gt;HH: ""DAT DRESS MAKES YO THIGHS LOOK THICK. LOOK OUR LEGS B DA SAME SIZE.""

&gt;MFW there is no way someone who is a size 0-2 and a size 10-12 are the same size. 

&gt;dreamon.exe

&gt;Stare at her legs, which closely resemble an actual leg of [ham](http://l.yimg.com/ck/image/A1435/1435522/300_1435522.jpg)

&gt;Feel gross anyway, so much for this dress.


&gt; Wander over to the fancy lingerie.


&gt;Casually looking over lacy baby blue thing. Possible gift for Mr.Boyfriend?


&gt;AW NO DROPPEDMYOREO, DAT DERE IS FOR CURVY WOMEN. YOU DON'T GOT DEM CURVES FOR DAT.


&gt;Goes on to tell me how she was afraid her exercise plan and diet was going to make her lose her ""curves"" and she didn't want to look like a man so she just never started either.


&gt;""HOW U EXPECT ME TO FIND A MAN, WITH NO BOOBS? DAS WHAT GUYS WANT""


&gt;I guess boobs under 20 pounds don't count as boobs.


&gt;Drove her home afterwards, than went for a run. I lost a good friend to fat logic that day.


**Know the warning signs of fat, and talk to your kids about fat logic before it's too late.**

1371940395.0	1gvmxj	Hamplanets At The Pool: Give Me Cheetos, Or Give Me Death!		447	64	47	"Time for another tale from the poolside, folks. And oh, what a tale it is. 

This one happened a couple of days ago, and I debated telling it. But in the end, I couldn't stand the thought of my rotund, ravishing lovelies going hungry a second longer. So here I am, relaying what is one of the most horrifying examples of childhood food addiction I have ever seen. 

I was at the pool with my kids, as usual, and had already done the laps thing. The place was pretty empty, all things considered. There were a couple of girls in their 20's tanning, a middle-aged guy who always sits on the side turning more orange by the day, and a couple of mothers with their kids, not including me and my two children. 

One of the mother's is a frequent pool visitor. She is always dressed to the nines, talks on her cellphone all day and never watches her kids. Except to throw them endless unhealthy snacks, which they consume in ultra-bulk mode. I have heard her pushing them to eat constantly, since ""swimming takes up so much energy"". 

Both children are slightly older than my oldest, who is seven. Neither can swim, and neither have any kind of floating aids. They are just supposed to stay in the shallow end, as they told my daughters when they went to go play in the deep end and the brothers couldn't go with them. 

Anyway, the two boys start fighting over some full sized bag of Cheetos the woman had brought with them. The mother herself is once more on the phone and completely ignoring them. I am in the deep end, and I see them come around the curve of the pool. One of the boys is laughing and holding the Cheetos away (both are very overweight). The bigger one is screaming bloody fucking murder, as though his brother has taken his spleen. His fat folds are flapping in protest as he waddles in pursuit of that extra crunchy goodness. 

Now, I am always on the alert when kids are around, whether their parents are attentive or not. I have had to drag more than one small child out of the pool, including a two year old who wriggled out of his mother's grasp and jumped naked into the deep end, almost drowning. I am paranoid. 

I start inching towards these kids, less for their safety and more because it looks like they are going to drop the Cheetos in. Which would require the pool closing for cleanup, and I don't want that. I didn't suspect either to try and get into the water.

The kid holding them suddenly pretends to throw the Cheetos into the pool. Without seeing if they really were thrown (they weren't, dem calories), the bigger boy belly flops into the pool after them. Where he promptly proceeds to begin drowning. 

I swim the few remaining feet and scoop him up as quickly as possible, bringing him to the edge of the pool where he is coughing up water since he went down like a damn brick. He vomits as I pull him up, over the side, and his mother STILL HAS NOT GOTTEN UP FROM THE CHAIR! Despite both of her sons freaking out, and more than one person noticing from the sidelines what is going on.

The brother runs over to tell her what happened, she still doesn't get up. She seems annoyed the kid is butting in on her call, and cannot grasp that there is danger. Not until I scream over at her, ""YOUR DAMN KID ALMOST DROWNED! GET YOUR ASS UP AND OVER HERE!""

This got her attention. She comes running over, shouting and freaking out as rainbow colored puke drips from her son's face. She says nothing at all to me, just grabs him away without so much as glancing at my face. Then she leaves with her kids. Leaves the mess her kids made. The entire crowd is staring in shock as she leaves the gate with the boys in tow. 

They had to close the pool for the rest of the afternoon. I don't know who I am more mad at, the idiotic, lazy mother who never taught her ten-year-old to swim in less than six feet of water, or the kid who was willing to die for soggy Cheetos. "	t5_2vzax	True
1370451197.0	1fqbjr	Old Hambeast almost kills a baby	Rulfus	468	90	79	"Hey guys, I’ve read a few FPS related to grocery shopping in the last few days, and I finally decided to post my biggest WTF story that is related to an old hambeast! Please bear with my English, since it isn’t my first language. Greentext mode: Engage!

&gt;Be me, about 3 years ago

&gt;16 years old, 60 kg, 1,78 m tall

&gt;Still live at home, so my mom sends me to get some bread

&gt;Grocery store is just around the corner from where we live

&gt;Go there, go inside, search for the bread when

&gt;Suddenly, the ground is starting to shake

&gt;The water in the bottles next to me is shaking uncontrollably

&gt;The chicken in the fridge section is coming back to life and starts to run

&gt;An  old man enters  the store

&gt;He’s about as tall as me, but looks like he’s only meat and bones 

&gt;Estimate about 50 kg

&gt;Is so weak he literally DRAGS the shopping cart instead of pushing it

&gt;wat.jpg

&gt;I realize that he can’t be the one causing those earthquakes

&gt;Then I see it

&gt;IT looks like a greasy stranded whale 

&gt;IT is about 60 years old, ~155 cm, AT LEAST 170 kg  

&gt;IT wears an old knitwear from about 30 years ago

&gt;Judging by the stench of rot she emits, I wonder if cows already learned to walk

&gt;She yells at the old man in front of her: “HUGOOOO, WHERE’S DA TECHNOOLOOOGYYY SECTUN??? AAAHM TIYAAAD!!”


Now, one thing you need to know is that I live in a small town and the grocery store I go to sometimes has really cheap and good technology equipment, like cheap PC’s, TV’s and cellphones. Of course, since it’s a branch in a small town, they only get like a handful of those devices to sell. SO obviously, most of those are gone as soon as the store opens in the morning, because people practically camp in front of the doors at 7 am to get those cheap things. Apparently, the old couple wanted to get the special offer for this day, but ofc there 
were no devices left to buy. Bare in mind that it’s late afternoon at the point of this story.


&gt;He doesn’t say a thing and just keeps dragging his shopping cart like a gravedigger drags his shovel

&gt;He has this soulless look in his eyes, she propably already ate his soul for lunch

&gt;”Whatever”, I think, “time to mind my own business again.”

&gt;I go and take the bread, go to the checkout

&gt;There’s a heavily pregnant woman standing in front of me, having a huge grocery purchase

&gt;I’m waiting in the checkout line when suddenly, something pushes into my ass

&gt;I hear a grunt from behind and the pushing continues 

&gt;I turn around and guess what: It’s Lady Hambeast again

&gt;She has taken over control of the empty cart and is pushing it into me

&gt;I say “Excuse me, but what are you doing?” 

&gt;LHB: “WHYT AHM DOIN??? PERHBS U SHUD GO AUT OF THA WAY??? MAYBE RESBECT YOUR ELDERS A BIT MOAR!!”

&gt;I am stunned by this rudeness and too beta to say something, so I just go out of the way

&gt;Hugo is standing behind her and stares holes in the air

&gt;LHB moves on and sees the pregnant woman

&gt;RAMS THE FUCKING CART IN TO HER SO SHE ALMOST FELL OVER

&gt;Yells: “ GET OUTTA MAH WAY YOU STOOPID LARDASS!!”

&gt;watwatwatwatwatwat.gif.jpg.png.exe

&gt;didshejust…?

&gt;Pregnant woman is now red from anger

&gt;Starts yelling back: “ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE? I’M PREGNANT! YOU COULD’VE KILLED MY BABY!”

&gt;LHB: “NAH U AIN’T PREGGO U JUSS FAT AN LAZEH AH CAN SEE IT!”

&gt;bitchuserious.gif

&gt;Woman is now in rantmode

&gt;Yells at her for at least 5 minutes straight

&gt;All the time the cashier has a look of horror and disgust on her face

&gt;When Preggo woman is done, LHB just sniff and says: “COME ON HUGO LESS GO! PPL TODEH NEVR RESPACT THER ELDURS!”

&gt;She waddles away to the entrance

&gt;She doesn’t seem to know that you can only leave the building through the exit behind the checkout, since the scanners won’t work from 
the inside

&gt;She stands in front of the door for a minute, then throws a huge fit and lets out a primal roar

&gt;Finally, a fit-looking man in his 40s enters the door

&gt;He enters the store and she throws the empty cart in the general direction of the man 

&gt;He turns around, stares for a few secs and shakes his head 

&gt;Then he realises us staring and has a questionmark.jpg look on his face

&gt;timetogetoutofhere.avi

&gt;I pay for the bread and give my change to the pregnant woman ‘cus she deserved it (about 9€)

&gt;The cashier tells me that this woman was already banned from TWO grocery stores she worked at before

&gt;MFW the next time I go to that store there’s a picture of LHB’s face next do the sign that says “Dogs are not allowed in here.”

TL;DR: Old hamplanet doesn’t get the products she wants, throws a huge tantrum at the checkout and ALMOST ABORTS A BABY while callong a pregnant woman a ""Lazy fatass"". Gets banned from the store afterwards.

After finishing [part two](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f0fc8/my_weekend_with_a_hamplanet_pt_2_hammie_hits_on/) I walked over to my mini fridge to grab a coke zero and got tired from all the exercise, but I rewarded myself with some oreos and now I'm all good again.

So this takes place a few days after part 2 ends. Also, I noticed in my last part I dropped the f bomb quite a bit. I'll try not to so much in this one, but I have a good feeling typing this and having to relive the whole thing is going to bring out A LOT of rage in me.

&gt;Walk into school and friend immediately grabs me and pulls me aside

&gt;""You won't believe what's being said about you"" she whispers

&gt;Turns out hammie was telling people that my boyfriend and I ""sexual harrased"" her. I shit you not she was telling people that I made her watch why I jacked my boyfriend off.

&gt;All of my rage

&gt;Hunt her down until I find her

&gt;Hold nothing back and start screaming how she a psychotic, attention seeking, pathetic excuse for a person

&gt;It doesn't take long for the principal to show up with the school police officer

&gt;Principal takes her to his office, school officer takes me to his

&gt;He sits me down in his office and leaves to (I assume) ask the principal what to do

&gt;Comes back a few minutes later with a paper and pen and askes me to write down everything that happened

&gt;When I finish he takes me into the waiting area outside his office and leaves

&gt;Comes back with my boyfriend and asks him to do the same thing

&gt;Then asks my boyfriend and I to follow him

&gt;Takes us to conference room where Hammie and principal are waiting

&gt;Tells us to sit at the opposite end of the table

&gt;""Now, Sara has made some very serious allegations about you two, but you seem to tell a very different story than she does."" says the principal

&gt;When they ask Sara to tell her side of the story this time she says that I made her touch my boyfriends dick

&gt;Oops.jpg

&gt;""Wait, in your statement you say that they made you watch while they engaged in a sexual act, now you're saying they made you participate? Which is it Sara?"" asks the principal

&gt;""Well... uh... I... don't know."" she says

&gt;""You don't know?"" he asks

&gt;Suddenly she bursts into tears and starts wailing

&gt;Between sobs she admits to making it all up

&gt;Feel bad for her for a split second

&gt;Then I remember the whole school now thinks my boyfriend and I are sexual attacking people

&gt;Doesn't feel bad anymore

I will admit, after it got around school that she had made it all up I did start feel bad for her again. She had become even more of an outcast than she was to begin with and it was my fault. At semester she was transferred into the distracts online program and I haven't seen her since (although, oddly enough, she did show up in my suggested facebook friends a few months ago which was strange considering this all happened four years ago). My boyfriend and I are still happily together but tend to avoid this memory as it does bring a odd mix of emotions in me, but I felt this story fits well here. I may keep this account to post some other FPS worthy moments in my life, but I doubt many will live up to this. In all honesty I hope they don't.

**Chapter Fourteen**

Fuck.

This was almost worse than a cancellation. It was worse than *Armageddon*. Stuck in a romantic booth with Porcina? Dante's visions of Hell were tame by comparison. Even if it *was* a double date, with Porcina's boyfriend in attendance, I could all-too-clearly picture her licking the plates, smacking her lips, grabbing at my legs and flashing the wait staff, all in an effort to play that so-called “jealousy card” that Lauren had previously mentioned... and *Lauren*, poor Lauren, would be assigned the role of reigning in her roommate, of keeping at bay the hogs of war.

“Do you want to reschedule?” I asked. “Maybe for tomorrow night?”

My response came not in the form of a text message, but as an old-fashioned phone call.

“Hi,” Lauren said. “So, this is my fault.”

“I'm sure you're not to blame,” I answered. Then I asked again: “So, do you want to reschedule?”

Lauren sighed audibly. “I can't. I took extra work shifts after school this week so I could be free for tonight. After that, it's finals.” 

""I thought you worked weekends?"" I asked, trying to mask my disappointment.

""Finals again. There's a lot of empty time slots."" My same old streak of paranoia reared its ugly head. Surely Lauren could *make* the time to see me, assuming she really wanted to? What if our plans for a date had all been her attempt at consolation, which she had later reconsidered? Or maybe she wanted a chaperone, and had enlisted Porcina's help?

It didn't matter. I didn't care. I decided then to make the best of the evening. “I guess it will have to be a double date. How did this happen, if you don't mind me asking?”

Another sigh preceded Lauren's words. “Aaron is a year behind us. He's up here touring colleges. He's staying until Wednesday, then leaving until next week. He'll be gone for good on Sunday in two weeks, after finals.” So much for Porcina's studying, I darkly thought to myself. “Porcina wanted the three of us to go out. I told her I was busy. She wouldn't drop it, so I finally told her I was busy with *you*.”

“That can't have been good,” I replied.

“It wasn't so bad. She was actually excited. She said something about me always going for the people she rejected.”

“Uh,” I stammered, “didn't you date her brother?”

“Ew.”

“Sorry.”

“No, not you. Porcina is trying on outfits. That one was horrible. *You're* very funny.” 

Still, I noted that she hadn't laughed. Maybe, I thought, I should keep from making such crass comments. “So,” I continued, “she just invited herself along?”

“Pretty much,” Lauren replied. “She doesn't have a car. She said she and Aaron would be stuck at home if I didn't give them a ride.” I remembered the swamp of refuse that Porcina, after a single day alone, had managed to create. Were I in Lauren's place, I wouldn't want to leave her unattended, either. “I offered to drop her off somewhere beforehand, but she wouldn't hear it. I'm sorry.”

“What would happen,” I ventured, “if you just left without her?”

“No,” answered Lauren. Then, a second later: “Sorry, not you again. What did you say?”

“I asked what would happen if you just left without her.”

*That* got a chuckle, though it was cold and free of mirth. “I've done it before. She always leaves the house a mess, and sometimes she intentionally breaks things. She claims they're accidents, but I know better. Honestly, it's just easier to give her what she wants. It's only until the end of the year.”

Only until the end of the year? “You're moving out?”

“Uh-huh. I love her, honestly, but I can't take living with her. She already knows.” 

A piece of good news amidst all the sorrow! “Well, I guess you're stuck until then, but at least you're getting out,” I said. I checked the time on my pocket watch. (Shut up. I was twenty, and a recovering peacock. Besides, I *like* pocket watches. Seriously, shut up.) “You know... *I* have a car. Does Porcina have her license? Could she borrow yours for the evening?”

“Nope.”

I held my tongue for a moment, hoping that Lauren had been addressing her roommate. “No license?”

“Nope.”

It was my turn to sigh. “Well, I guess that's it. I'll pick you up in an hour.”

In hindsight, it was a mistake for me to insist on driving. My intent had been to be gentlemanly, but the end result was abhorrent. After arriving at the townhouse, my back seat was quickly populated, first by the petite girl who was the subject of my affections, and then by a man who looked like a two-thirds scale model of a normal adult male. Everything about him was small, save for his oversized graphic t-shirt. I couldn't help but notice that the cartoon character emblazoned upon it – no doubt some hero of Japanese origin – was strikingly similar in stature to Aaron. A few wisps of elongated peach fuzz clung to the young man's chin, and I immediately noticed his nervous habit of tugging on each of them in sequence.

Then, Porcina entered.

“*Hiiiiiii*!” she squealed, pouring herself into the passenger seat. “Still driving *this* piece of shit around?”

“My Porsche is in the shop,” I answered, which drew a chuckle from Lauren.

“*Whatever*,” said Porcina. “You don't have a *Porsche*.” She turned around to face her beau, who seemed off in his own little world. “He doesn't have a *Porsche*. He's *poor*.”

Her constant comments about my wallet were starting to get to me. Worst of all, she wasn't wrong. Though I came from a very well-off family, I was essentially on my own. My father covered only school expenses, leaving me to find external funding for any luxuries, like romantic getaways. Porcina's insistence in reminding me of this fact was something less than welcome, especially considering the financial hardship I would be be enduring for this disaster of a first date. (Not to mention the extra gas exhausted in hauling around her weight.) I had no problem losing funds for a date with Lauren on her own, but after only thirty seconds in Porcina's presence, I was wishing for hazard pay.

That sentiment was helped along by the young woman's choice in attire. She had squeezed into a purple dress with no sleeves to speak of, giving her the overall appearance of a certain disobedient child from a movie starring Gene Wilder. Her ever-present pigtails were especially unruly, and a second glance in their direction confirmed that they were covered in fine glitter.

Well, that would certainly be fun to clean up later.

“So where are we *goooooooing*?” Porcina whined. “It better be *gooooood*.”

I told her the name of the restaurant, while trying to give the impression that I was concentrating on the road. I met Lauren's eyes in my rear-view mirror, and saw her mouth the word “Sorry!”

“Afghani,” Aaron suddenly stated. His voice was much deeper than I had expected, though that may have been from lack of use.

“Indian, actually,” I corrected. I didn't bother mentioning that the word he meant was “Afghan.”

“Afghani,” insisted Aaron again. “Afghani.”

“So, you look nice!” chimed Lauren.

Before I could respond, Porcina interjected. “Yeah, this dress shows off my *assets*!”  She followed the statement with a bout of ear-piercing laughter. Given my car's confined space, I would have preferred her trademark hiss.

“Thanks,” I mouthed back to Lauren, letting her know that I understood. “You too.” Lauren was clad in a two-piece skirt and blouse, covered by a feminine blazer. She looked, for lack of a better word, attractive. ""*Really* nice,"" I soundlessly finished.

Porcina let out a gasp of mock incredulity. “Are you guys telling *secrets*? Come on, I wanna know!”

“No secrets,” Lauren replied.

“No secrets,” echoed Aaron. I eyed the guy in the mirror. He didn't meet my gaze.

“Come *ooooon*” Porcina whined again, “I really *wanna knoooooooow*!”

I checked the time on my dashboard. Less than two minutes had passed.

This was going to be a long night.

1365893663.0	1cam6f	The Planet and the Potheads Part II: The Barbeque	LeadFootSpiderMonkey	497	120	64	"So most everyone has dispersed now and the neighborhood kids are playing basketball, me and my neighbor/BFF took a plant to the new neighbors this morning and re-invited them to the cookout. I held out hope that the day would just be fun and uneventful, and it was, until about an hour and a half in when ""Oversized Kirby"" (thanks for the name, /u/Over-Analyzed) and her parents arrived. Here's the events from me and my BFF, who is again with me to fill in stuff I missed. Original story [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1c8qia/the_planet_and_the_potheads/)

I know it's long, but there's 2 of us sitting here filling in what we saw all day between us, so TL;DR at end

&gt;be me

&gt;helping the husband BBQ the last of the meat, and getting the ribs out of the slow-cooker

&gt;datsmell.itsmellsgood

&gt;most of neighborhood and close family has arrived

&gt;everyone lounging around the pool, kids playing, birds chirping, neighbors laughing

&gt;freakingorgeousday.mpeg

&gt;everyone getting ready to eat, getting dried off

&gt;start setting everything that has been brought out, and getting the meat on platters

&gt;been a relaxing hour and a half, wondering if OK's parents are going to come, feel bad for em'

&gt;get everyone in line, look at drink table and see ripples start to go through all the bottles

&gt;start feeling gravitational pull

&gt;look behind me off the deck and OK and her parents have arrived

&gt;OK is in the shower curtain material bathing suit and shirt from last night

&gt;notice it's men's swimming trunks, just never seen them that big

&gt;""HAAAAY LeadFootSpiderMonkey! The party has arrived! TEEHEE..UEUEUEUEUE""

&gt;greet OK and parents

&gt;they all look high and smell like patchouli

&gt;whydopotheadsalwayssmellikepatchouli.png

&gt;come up with new names for parents, PM For ""pothead mom"" and PD for ""pothead dad""

&gt;don't think anything of it, not against pot

&gt;everyone in line, everything going good so far

&gt;OK waddles over to the food

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/wxQtL.gif) she laughs and wobbles her way in between my mom and nephew to get a plate and cut line

&gt;PM and PD look like they don't give a fuck, cause they are high as fuck

&gt;then i realize PM hasn't seen her cutting line yet (we have a big family and a full neighborhood, so there's 
about 17-18 people in line)

&gt;PM see's her and puts her head down and averts her eyes

&gt;i offer her a fishbowl margarita so this woman can relax even more

&gt;she and PD both accept

&gt;imakedatmargaritagood.avi

&gt;I walk out with one of the margaritas and nearly drop it when i see the reaction my nephew has when he 
finally turns around and sees Kirby in human form in front of him

&gt; [hfw] (http://imgur.com/BcEvR)

&gt;I sit the margarita down on the picnic table just off the side of the deck and throw 2 straws in so they can 
begin drinking

&gt;BFF tells me to look at OK's plate

&gt;she took a rack of ribs and half the potato salad already

&gt;she fumbles around and pulls a 2nd plate out from under what I thought was one

&gt;fills it with one of everything from desert table

&gt;notice that she brought her own Bubba Mug (big mug with a spout on it used for small contrustion jobs)

&gt;she wobbles over to the picnic table and plops her food down

&gt;oh damn, byebyepicnictable.mp4

&gt;she tries to put her legs in, but they're too short, and her belly is too fat for her to fit properly

&gt;offer her biggest, most sturdy yard chair we have

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/u6Hnv.gif) she misses the chair because she can't see behind her

&gt;KIRBY USES ROLL

&gt;it is effective

&gt;she is rolling like a ball on her sides, she makes at least 3 full turns before she stops

&gt;then a hole is ripped in time and space

&gt;Kirby lets out a huge ripping, sputtering, earth shattering fart

&gt;sounds like a duck caught in an industrial fan

&gt;think the suction caused a major wedgie, cause she now has something I can only describe as ""fart knuckle""

&gt;Kirby surprisingly laughs it off, gets help from 3 guys and gets in her chair

&gt;proceeds to eat everything on both plates while chattering to the neighbors around us with her mouth full of 
food

&gt;she is high as a muthafucka.pdf


This is where BFF and I start feeling AWFUL for PM and PD

&gt;Everyone has eaten and is now surrounding my neighbor's pool, tables set up between our yard and theirs

&gt;got that slip n slide out for the kiddos in our yard

&gt;OK has polished off 3rd plate of food, but we somehow have made enough

&gt;OK brings chair over to where everyone is sitting between both yards

&gt;plops chair down and announces that she is going to use the slip n' slide so she can talk to the cute army guy 
helping the kids out

&gt;that's my brother who is dating one of my sisters friends, but she cant make it until later

&gt;she proceeds to grab her shirt and starts to take it off

&gt;NOOOOOOOOOOOO.imoutofideasforfilenamessofuckit.gif

&gt;I thought she was wearing a tank top under her shirt

&gt;it is one of those half tank bikini tops that ties in the back and around your neck

&gt;where is the acid, our poor eyes

&gt;she has like 5 rolls on each arm

&gt;about a fuck million on her body

&gt;bitch is trying to seductively walk over to the slip n slide

&gt;looks about how you would think Kirby in real life would look trying to be seductive

&gt;she rolls over to my brother and loudly exclaims ""WOW! look at those muscles!! do you work out??""

&gt;reaches over as my brother looks in horror at her trying to ...pet??..... his arms

&gt;he is ahead of the game and says ""yeah, me and my GIRLFRIEND work out all the time....""

&gt;""girlfriend"" term is ineffective, Kirby still trying to flirt

&gt;PM in her high and tipsy stupor says ""18 years old and never had a boyfriend""

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/gQFN3.gif) she's only 18?!?!

&gt;she looks like she's 25-30

&gt;PM continues, ""tried getting her help, it costs almost her whole disability income to feed her""

&gt;everyone is silent

&gt;says OK doesn't see the problem and is proud of her

&gt;wait for it....

&gt;her ""curves""

&gt;bitch you don't have curves, youareacurve.mpegII

&gt;says Kirby is starting college in August and has been home schooled the past 2 years for getting in fights that 
OK would start

&gt;tells us OK almost got expelled for almost hitting a cafeteria lady because she wouldn't give her extra food

&gt;everyone is looking at PM in horror

&gt;I get up to go get that woman another drink

&gt;hear brother say ""WATCH OUT!!!"" really loudly to my niece

&gt;Kirby has engaged speed waddle

&gt;puts her arms out and FLOPS onto the slip n slide

&gt;Kirby goes about 3 feet and stops, starts shrieking, laughing...........?

&gt;her top has folded under her behemo-boobs

&gt;she is giggling and asks army brother for help

&gt; ""army broooooo, teehee, can you help me up, teehee""

&gt;she winks and wiggles her top up just in time for super fit brother to pull her up to sitting position

&gt;has to call over same 2 guys to help her up like they all did before

&gt;go in to make the margarita, come back out to see her waddling towards the pool with grass stuck to her 
back, following army bro

&gt;look over and slip n slide has 1 foot rip in it


&gt;shamu is about to return to the water y'all

&gt;Kirby wants to do a cannon ball

&gt;helpusall.treefort

&gt;she is still doing that ""seductive"" walk, starts flailing her arms around to the music we have going at the 
neighbors house

&gt;starts singing at the top of her lungs

&gt;giggles and cannon balls into the pool, literally knocking water over some of the kids' heads

&gt;good thing this pool has stairs that are built into cement, she is able to waddle out

&gt;army brothers girlfriend shows up after work shift

&gt;he runs to her and kisses her

&gt;Kirby snarls, waddles over to bro girlfriend, introduces herself loudly

&gt;""I'm Oversized Kirby! And who are YOU?""

&gt;PD starts to get up and say that they are heading home

&gt;PM tells him to sit down and drink, they aren't going because Kirby is being embarrassing

&gt;GO PM! Don't let her ruin your good time

&gt;bro girlfriend introduces herself


At this point I witnessed fat logic 101 and never thought I'd her this come out of a fat persons mouth, ever, I though it was merely the stuff of FPS folklore.

&gt;""You gonna eat??"" Kirby says in a sassy tone

&gt;bro girlfriend is fit and takes care of herself

&gt;""No, ate a big lunch today at work""

&gt;Then Kirby says it....

&gt;""Guess you're too scared to have curves like me, then, huh? Army Bro needs something to hold on to!""

&gt;Bro Girlfriend just looks around kinda stunned as Kirby does a little ""seductive twist"" and walks away

&gt;everyone is silent


&gt;PM and PD get up and say goodbye politely

&gt;me and BFF immediately invite PM to our movie tomorrow night

&gt;feelsorryforherman.jpg

&gt;she says she will call and let me know

&gt;tells OK they are leaving

&gt;OK turns and grabs Army Bro in a hug and ""teeehee's"" a few times

&gt;i think he's gonna suffocate in her fat

&gt;She grabs her Bubba Jug and follows PM and PD down the road talking loudly about how Army Bro was totally 
into her

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/HWiWs.gif) I still don't know why they have a snow cone truck and forgot to ask


TL;DR- New neighbor who looks like Kirby in human form, comes to first BBQ of the season, falls and rolls, lets out duck sounding fart, eats a ton of food, flirts with bro, breaks the slip n slide, thin shames Army Brothers girlfriend, tries to be seductive, fails, parents say they have tried helping but ""muhcurves""
 
Me and BFF have to finish cleaning up now. Will post more as they happen, which I hope isn't SOON AT ALL because DANG IT, I feel so bad for her parents.

**Chapter Eleven**

I don't remember getting home, nor what I did when I got there. My next lucid memory is of opening my front door and seeing Jeff, a case of beer clutched in his hands. Jeff lived over an hour away, so his presence could not have been a coincidence. I realized that I must have called him, and that his arrival was in answer to that SOS.

“Hey,” Jeff said, looking me over. “It's cold out here.”

He walked into my apartment, angling himself between the door and the refrigerator (which had been placed in a questionable location by my landlord). Jeff was (is) a rather large guy, in the sense that he towered well over my own six-foot frame, and he made it through to my spartan living room in only a handful of steps.

“Hey,” I finally responded. 

Jeff held up a palm at me. “Nuh-uh. Drink first, campfire stories later.” With a practiced motion, he yanked his keys from his pocket, then cut through the cardboard case of beer with two swift strokes. I didn't ask how he'd acquired the beverages – I was the eldest in my group of friends, and still a few months shy of legal drinking age – and although I wasn't usually taken with excessive consumption of alcohol, I was happy to accept a treatment for my short-circuited nerves. I slumped onto my tiny couch, while Jeff took up residence on the matching armchair. There was a familiar popping sound as he uncapped two bottles, one of which was handed to me. I gave Jeff a sardonic salute – something of a tradition between us – and downed the bitter suds like a man dying of thirst. 

“I'm dead,” I flatly stated.

“Naw,” Jeff replied.

“No, really, *I'm dead*,” I insisted. “Porcina is going to accuse me of rape or something. Lauren will never speak to me again. I'll spend my life behind bars because of some crazy girl's wild fantasy.”

Jeff made a noise like “Pfft,” and took another sip of beer.

“Well, I'm glad *you're* so goddamned calm!” I snapped. I immediately regretted the outburst and hung my head, feeling exhausted. “I'm sorry, but seriously... this isn't going to end well. I should have just slept with her.”

My words prompted a quizzical look for Jeff. “How would that have helped?” he asked.

“Because...” I started to say, but I never finished the sentence. The gears in my head creaked into motion, cracking off the layers of rust that had built up over the evening. “It wouldn't have. It would only have delayed the inevitable.” Jeff nodded wordlessly, and I continued. “Porcina is *crazy*. Like, actually crazy. She might really *believe* that something happened between us... but if that's true, then Lauren probably knows about it.”

“Probably.”

“Then again,” I said, “she might not. They've been friends for years. She must be pretty good at ignoring Porcina's behavior.”

“Naw,” Jeff said again. He gestured with his beer as he spoke. “She sounds pretty smart... though that might be you exaggerating things.”

I wearily shrugged my shoulders. “Maybe. I don't know. This whole thing is such a mess.”

For a brief moment, Jeff looked uncomfortable, as though he was deciding whether or not to speak. “So,” he finally said, “do you think *maybe* this is... *partially* your fault?” I gave him a look of doubt. “I'm just saying,” he went on, “that you make stupid decisions sometimes. I mean, you're really smart... but you can also be an idiot.”

“How could I have avoided this one?” I asked.

Jeff held up a finger. “You could have stayed off Craigslist.” Another digit joined the first. “You could have left the restaurant at *any* time.” A third finger rose to meet the others. “You could have cut off contact and not chased after Lauren.” Jeff gave up on counting, but kept listing my mistakes. “You could have told Fatilda –”

“Porcina,” I interjected.

“You could have told *Porcina* you weren't interested before you followed her around the mall. You could have mailed her a check, or, I don't know, give the money to *Lauren*, which would have been an excuse to see her.”

Jeff, for the record, is certainly no stranger to stupid decisions... but he had a way of seeing things that occasionally left me feeling like a dunce. Normally, I considered my intellect to be my pride and my best asset, but in the face of my friend's observations, I looked like an utter fool. “You're right,” I muttered, feeling unhappy. “And now, I'm going to end up in jail.”

“You're not going to go to *jail*...” Jeff answered. “Come on, have the cops started knocking on your door? Is there an angry mob with pitchforks that I missed?” He made a show of looking beneath the recliner's cushions. “Hello? Mister Angry Mob?” He opened the case of beer and peered inside. “Hello? Nope! Not in here!”

I felt my face break into a smile. The combination of ethanol, a friend, and just voicing my fears had done wonders for my mood. I still felt occasional pangs of panic... but they had become much more manageable.

“Thanks,” I said.

Jeff shrugged. “So, uh... what happened, exactly? You said she was naked and crying.”

The picture was all too fresh in my mind, even when viewed through a veneer of shock. I retold the story to Jeff, taking care to include every detail, this time. He made a disgusted noise when I described Porcina's rise from beneath the bedclothes, and pantomimed a gag when I spoke about her tantrum. I hesitated only when my tale reached the point of my exit from Porcina's room, when I bumped into Lauren and saw her all but naked (and in person, this time). Remembering the event with anything approaching arousal seemed like a gross discourtesy... but I finally confessed to having thoroughly enjoyed the sight.

“Then, I came back here,” I finished, “and I guess I must have called you.”

“Yup.” Jeff opened another pair of bottles, again passing one to me. “You eaten anything? We should order a pizza. I'll buy.”

My stomach did a tiny flip. “I don't think I can stomach anything with cheese,” I replied.

“Then order a salad. *I* want pizza.” He reached into his pocket, furrowed his brow, and looked around the room. “Damn it. I left my phone in my car. Where's yours?” I pointed to my desk, which sat behind an open door at the room's far corner. Jeff departed for only a minute, but when he returned, there was a cryptic look on his face. “Uh... well, huh.”

“What is it?” I asked. In response, he tossed me the item that he had gone to retrieve. The image of an envelope on its green-and-black display could only mean one thing, though for the sake of clarity, it was paired with a few characters of text: 1 MSG

One message.

One message from *who*?

I flipped open my phone and commanded my shaking fingers to cooperate. A brief, tense moment passed as the screen before me transitioned, to display the following words:

“Sorry about Porcina. She's done this before. Sleeping now. Talk tomorrow after class.”

It was signed, “L”

1373500382.0	1i1mgo	r/tall recommended I crosspost my story, so here is a glorious moment I experienced the other day	amanoftomorrow	452	72	61	"So yesterday on the train home from work I was squished on a three person seat between a girl on my left and a guy on my right. These seats are like rows of couches of 3 person seats on one side of the isle and two person seats on the other. These are spaced in such a way that if your 5'10 then you're comfortable, if your 6'2 like me you're fucked. So there I was crammed into this seat when a very large woman comes and sits next to the gentleman in front of me, she proceeds to huff and look round at me to glare for some bizzare reason. Eventually she turns round to me and goes ballistic shouting that I'm kneeing her in the back and tells me to stop it and remove my knees from the back of her seat. This was a packed commuter train and I was pretty shocked that someone would make such a commotion. I just said ""I can't help being tall love"" and pointed to my knees which are jammed up against the seat. The look of indignation on her face grows stronger and she continued to shout and tells me to stand up then. At this point the heavens open and the absolute bro next to me pipes up with ""like he said he can't help being tall the same way you can't help taking up 2 spaces on a 3 person seat"". Luckily she actually was taking up two spaces bearing in mind this train was packed and hot with the aisle full as well, safe to say that shut her right up with a few people even applauding as her noise had caused the whole carriage to look at the commotion. I couldn't help but crack a smile at the lad who'd defended me and say thanks. This was on a train from Manchester in England yesterday evening, so if you're out there train bro just like to say thank you again!"	t5_2vzax	True

1372634921.0	1he4iw	Christmas with my hamplanet sister.	CanadianJesus	461	85	78	"[Introduction to my hamplanet sister BS.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hb6jf/more_sad_than_funny_my_hamplanet_sister_is_eating/)

This story takes place during Christmas last year, a few months after BS came clean about their economic situation. If you haven't read my earlier story, it can be summed up like this:

BS and her chubby hubby CM are at least $50000 in debt with nothing of value to show for. They have basically spent all money on food and cigarettes. They can no longer afford to pay their bills and are dependant on my parents financially.

As Christmas was approaching I hadn't seen my family for several months as I was studying abroad in Germany. I flew back to Sweden a few days before Christmas to stay at my parents house in my home town. BS and her family live in an even smaller town, roughly an hour and a half away. For the past few years, we have celebrated Christmas as BS' family's house since it's bigger.

Traditional Swedish Christmas food is referred to as [Julbord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord#Julbord) in Sweden. It's basically lot's of different dishes, mostly meat and fish, served Smörgåsbord-style. Since neither BS or CM can cook very well, my mother and other sister OS prepare most of the dishes at my parents house the day or days before and bring them. This year I was helping too, since I was at the time a vegetarian as of eight months and made vegetarian versions of my favourite dishes. BS and CM were pretty much only in charge of potatoes and beverages. Since my parents didn't want to ruin Christmas, they had even wired some money to pay for this.

As we arrive on Christmas eve morning (that's when we celebrate Christmas in Sweden) I notice that BS has lost a considerable amount of weight. The last time I saw her, she weighed at least 140 kg, but now she had lost at least 20 kg, if not more. Maybe there is hope for her yet?

I complimented her on her weight loss and told her she looked great. I thought that they had cut down on the takeaway, sweets and soda because of their crappy economy. Instead of accepting this compliment politely she starts to get defensive and tells me that she lost this weight almost unwillingly because she's been so stressed about their economic situation. I don't really know what to reply so I just nod awkwardly. I notice that CM hasn't lost any weight, if anything he's gained some, weighing at least 150 kg. Apparently they can still afford his Coca-Cola. 

We start unpacking and preparing the food we brought and just making chit chat. BS now tells us that they had decided to have an alcohol free Christmas this year because she ""don't want drunk people around the kids"". I don't buy this excuse since no one has ever been drunk on Christmas before. We grown-ups drink a Christmas beer (a dark lager or ale) and one or two shots of akvavit or similar strong spirits. The most outrageous thing that has happened would be my father falling asleep on the couch after lunch, which he tends to do every year, even when he's completely sober. 

I suspect that the money my parents wired might not have gone to the food and drink it was supposed to but I don't say anything because I don't want to ruin Christmas. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not an alcoholic and I can get through Christmas with BS completely sober. It's just that it's part of the Christmas traditions and if there's one thing we don't break in Sweden, it's holiday traditions. We still celebrate the heathen holidays that are thousands of years old.

As we finishing up the food preparations and setting up the table I start to understand where at least some of the money went. BS brings out not one, not two but six 1,5 litre bottles of [Julmust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julmust), a swedish christmas soft drink. She also brings out a bottle of Coca-Cola for CM. Now this might not seem like a lot, but keep in mind that there are only eight of us there, two being young children. I look BS in the eye and say something like: ""Wow, six bottles?""

 She answers me dead serious: ""Well, there's more in the basement in case we run out."" 

I sneak down to the basement a few minutes later and discover 4 six-packs of the same 1,5 litre bottles, totalling 45 litres of Julmust in the house. I'm starting to understand why they couldn't afford any booze after that. Very well, at least I won't go thirsty.

When we sit down to eat, my niece notices that I'm not eating the same as the rest and asks me about this. Before I can answer, BS 

interjects: ""CanadianJesus is a vegetarian, he doesn't eat real food.""

Me: ""Well, that's true. I don't meat or fish or anything else made from animals.""

Niece:""Why not?""

Now, I knew why I didn't eat those things but I'm not sure how to explain that to a six-year-old. She's not aware of were her food comes from and even though I think kids should know this kind of stuff, I don't think I'm qualified to explain ethics to a kid.

Me: ""Well, I mostly do it for my health. To feel good and lose weight""

I should say that at this time I weighed roughly 78 kg on my 1,77 m, down from 82 kg when I was an omnivore.

BS: ""That's just not true. Meat is healthy. We eat meat and we are healthy.""

Me: ""I'm not saying you can't be healthy whilst eating meat, but it's calorie dense and in the case of red meat filled with cholesterol and saturated fats.""

This is when CM gets involved, because if there's anything he loves more than coke, it's bad science.

CM: ""Calories don't matter when it comes to meat. The only thing that matters is calories from carbs. You can eat as much meat as you want and not gain weight.""

I usually avoid disagreeing with CM, because most of the time he's just too stubborn to admit being wrong. If he believes anything he will defend that idea even when faced with evidence of the contrary.  This time, high on sugar from the Julmust I do.

Me: ""Well, no. There's nothing magical about meat that makes the body not gain weight. It's basic science really. Calories in and calories out""

BS: ""Whatever. You don't need to be skinny to be healthy. You can be just as healthy whatever your weight is.""

Me: ""Well, there's a really high correlation between obesity and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.""

CM: ""That doesn't mean anything. Correlation doesn't imply causality. The same genes that cause obesity cause those diseases as well.""

At this point I realise how I can't outlogic these hamplanets and let the matter drop. We finish lunch and move to the sitting room. I think Santa is about to visit soon. 

Now, we haven't been buying Christmas presents amongst us adults in the family for several years now, since me and OS are both students and don't have that much money. My parents still insist on buying something for me and my sisters though. I'm really fine with this, since Christmas is for the young kids anyway.

I put on the Santa suit and sneak through the basement where I pick up the big sack of presents. I would have assumed that it would be light this year because of the economic situation but it was as heavy as always. I knock on the door and my niece, who is half terrified and half excited, opens the door. Everything proceeds as normal and I hand out the presents. Most are for my niece and nephew of course and they've got a really big haul this year. A bit weird, since I know that OS and I only bought one present each for the kids and my parents only a few.

After I was done pretending to be Santa I sneak back in through the basement and go back up to the sitting room. My niece informs me that I just missed Santa but he left me a present on the coffee table. As the kids are too busy playing with their new toys my mother discreetly asks my sister about the presents, as in why they bought so many.

BS: ""Oh, I wasn't going to buy so many but since you wired so much money I figured I could spend a bit extra on the kids. It's only christmas once a year you know""

My mother: ""That money wasn't just for Christmas you know. You don't get paid until the end of January. How much do you have left until then?""

BS: ""Oh, we'll figure something out.""

The look on my mothers face when she realises she's expecting her to  bail them out again.

My mother: ""Well, if you don't have enough money to eat, I'm sure the social services can help you.""

BS spent the rest of the evening sulking and shooting daggers at my mother.

TL;DR: My mum wires money to my sister. She spends it on sugary drinks and presents for the kids. Mum finally let's her know that she isn't bailing them out any more.

&gt;pretty average sized, definitely not abnormally skinny or anything

&gt;see my life flash before my eyes  

&gt;suddenly become religious and start praying 
 
&gt;oh wait, it's a human female (?) 
  
&gt;maybe an inch or two taller than me, so 5'5, and at least 400 pounds

1368087404.0	1dzo6w	Hamburglar Makes a 16 Hour Greyhound Bus Ride Hell	Sycamori	443	66	52	"Hi guys, so this is my first post to this subreddit. I couldn't figure out if greentexting on Reddit is any different than on 4Chan so if I screw it up, sorry.


EDIT: [Part Two Available Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e25zc/hamburglar_ruins_dinner_for_everyone/)


&gt;Be 14

&gt;Our choir class is heading to Banff, Alberta for a Choir festival

&gt;16 hour drive via greyhound

&gt;Seated next to a bucktoothed walrus, let's call her hamburglar

&gt;5'3'', probably about 300 lbs

&gt;Hamburglar is sorta my friend but only because nobody else really likes her, didn't know why until this trip

&gt;Sits down next to me, can feel her disgusting rippled thighs already pouring into uncharted territory (my seat)

&gt;Smells like a month old moldy pizza roll is stuck under one of her many waves of fat

&gt;Breathing out of mouth mode engaged

&gt;Takes out party sized bag of chips and munches on them, it's 6 in the fucking morning. What the fuck

&gt;Whatever.jpg

&gt;I have backpack absolutely full of treats, snacks, and goodies courtesy of mum

&gt;Supposed to last me and my friends the entire 2 week trip in Banff

&gt;Hour 3: Hamburglar has run out of family sized bag of munchies and has totaled her entire tray of cookies. I take out some licorice my mum packed for me

&gt;""HEY SYCAMORI CAN I HAVE SOME"" ""Uhm... sure I guess""

&gt;She takes entire bag of licorice, begins slobbering over every piece like a starving Ethiopian infant

&gt;Whatever I wouldn't have eaten that much licorice anyways

&gt;Hour 6: I open bag and grab the fruit salad I put on top of all my sweets, Hamburglar's eyes glaze over like donuts at the sight of all this food

&gt;I swear she's getting turned on just by looking at it, begin to gag at the mental image of Hamburglar's loins flooding with bacon grease

&gt;Quickly zip bag back up

&gt;Hour 7: Begins talking to me about her ""relationship"" with a guy at school, let's call him Wailord.

&gt;Actual Quote: Yeah... Wailord is sooo protective of me, and his eyes are this amazing dark brown colour. He's kind of like my Edward Cullen.

&gt;In reality Wailord avoids her at all costs

&gt;Killme.png

&gt;Pitstop: We all get off the bus to get food, have a choice between Tim Hortons and McDonalds, only have enough time to go to one

&gt;""OH SYCAMORI LET'S GO TO MCDONALDS IM SOO HUNGRY PLEEEEASE LET'S GO THERE I HATE TIM HORTONS :("" 

&gt;Proceeds to drag me by my arm over to McDonalds

&gt;Cannot fight the gravitational pull of Hamburglar

&gt;She orders 4 Fish Fillets, and 2 orders of large fries as well as a diet coke

&gt;I order a cranberry muffin because I'm a vegetarian and cannot eat anything at McDicks

&gt;Her mum phones her and seemingly asks her what she's eaten on the trip so far, when Hamburglar says we're at McDicks I can hear her yelling at Hamburglar over the phone

&gt;Back on bus, Hamburglar smells even worse

&gt;The strenuous act of wolfing down 4 fish fillets in record time must've caused cooking oil to begin coming out of her pores

&gt;Hour 10, cannot take Hamburglar's horrible stench any longer

&gt;Tell her I'll be at the back of the bus with one of my friends

&gt;Sit at the back with him, happy to be away from her. End up falling asleep for the rest of the trip

&gt;Hour 16, finally arrive in Banff. Surprised Hamburglar didn't wobble her way to the back of the bus to make her sit with me again considering how much she talked

&gt;Go to grab my backpack of goodies, it's SUPER light when I pick it up

&gt;Unzip

&gt;LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS GONE

&gt;""Oh, I got a little hungry so I took some of your food. I thought it was okay because you gave me your licorice earlier. Hope you don't mind! Heehee""

&gt;Pissed beyond belief, too tired to react, god damn it Hamburglar.

**tl;dr: Twilight loving walrus that smells like death eats the junk food that's supposed to last 10 people 2 weeks, on top of a trip to McDicks and her own damn food.**

The horror doesn't end there, because guess who got housed with her when we actually fucking got to the place. Yup. If you guys thought this was funny/interesting, I might post more misadventures of Hamburglar. But this is my first post and I have no clue if this is even interesting to read, so give me some feedback if you want to. 

EDIT: Wow, didn't think so many people would like this enough to give it an upvote! Will post another Hamburglar horror story tomorrow."	t5_2vzax	True
1374479222.0	1istco	"""Just wait ten minutes please..."" (A story of betrayal and revenge, Part Two)"	GNPunk	468	91	64	"I am honestly glad I'm going to get this story out in two parts, because this is bringing up some bad memories.

[PART ONE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1issx3/just_wait_ten_minutes_please_a_story_of_betrayal/)

Part Two will be the finale, and I assure you the payoff is worth it.  A little prelude to this, though.  At my age currently, early 30s, I have learned to curb my abrasiveness and am generally a pleasant person to be around, though I'm still very cynical and not afraid to speak my mind.  At the age of this story, I was a pretty terrible person.  However, even I could not fathom how far I would go to end the pain of this night.  You will learn soon.

I expect mixed reactions on the ending of this, so you won't offend me if you think I acted harshly.

Anyways, full disclosure:  **WALL OF TEXT INCOMING AGAIN**

&gt;be me and walking whale, going into Olive Garden

&gt;me looking sexy as hell

&gt;crimson silk fucking rules

&gt;my date looks like a train wreck covered in sugar

&gt;can't wait to see the looks we get

&gt;well...SHE gets.

&gt;hostess is sexy as hell

&gt;must work out

&gt;smiles at me brightly

&gt;[hfw](http://i.imgur.com/zqMEj05.gif) she realizes she-beast and me are here together

&gt;her eyes look to me

&gt;they say how sorry she is

&gt;I must not be hiding my unhappiness with this situation well

&gt;I wish I could just yell [this](http://i.imgur.com/LDMByVd.gif)

&gt;hostess seats us

&gt;well...""seat"" is a relative term

&gt;restaurant is fucking packed

&gt;looks like only one or two spots open

&gt;only booths

&gt;praying there is enough room

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;bellowing is building up

&gt;tub-of-fun uses ultra bitch mode!  It's super effective!

&gt;""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO FIT IN THERE?  DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME, WITH DISABILITIES, NEEDS SPECIAL SEATING?""

&gt;[mfw](http://t.qkme.me/3oows6.jpg) she bellows that out of her gullet

&gt;I had no clue people like this existed

&gt;sexy hostess looks ready to cry

&gt;give most sympathetic look to her

&gt;unspoken exchange helps both of us

&gt;people on either side of empty booth are cowering in fear

&gt;I would be too

&gt;two wild waitresses appear!

&gt;immediately regret their decision

The next five minutes was spent negotiating with either side of our booth to get out long enough to adjust the width of the booths and tables.  Thankfully, both the booths and tables could be moved at this restaurant.  The booth on one side had just sat down a few minutes prior, while the other group were just getting their checks, so it did work out for shebeast, who seemed content for that moment.

&gt;sit down in booth

&gt;immediately grab beverage menu

&gt;wonders if jack daniels can just be served by the bottle

&gt;ponders 12 step program for just a moment

&gt;brain brings me back to reality

&gt;cringe as booth across from me creaks in pain when tub-of-fun sits/drops/thuds into it.

&gt;at least she isn't bellowing

&gt;cautious optimism that worst is over

&gt;LOLNO

&gt;STUPID GNPUNK

&gt;""Oh my god I don't know what to get!  There are so many things I love here!""

&gt;realization hits me that she might expect me to pay for everything

&gt;trying to remember if I said otherwise

&gt;don't think it was discussed

&gt;waiter comes to take beverage order

&gt;contemplate ordering everything on the top shelf in one giant glass

&gt;settled for jack and coke

&gt;queue bellowing

&gt;wind builds up

&gt;flowers at table never stood a chance

&gt;""DRINKING IS SO BAD FOR YOU, GNPUNK!  YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT!""

&gt;thank you, anti-drinking PSA

&gt;order your fucking drink, then.

&gt;fatpersonlogic in three...two...one...

&gt;""I'll have your biggest margarita!  Oh, and can we order appetizers now??""

&gt;.....

&gt;Bitch, you just yelled at me for ordering alcohol, and you ordered the fucking fruit punch of liquor?

&gt;""I thought you said drinking is bad?""

&gt;There's that glare again

&gt;""I DON'T DRINK ALL THE TIME!  IT'S OKAY FOR ME NOW TEE HEE!""

&gt;I hate your laugh.

&gt;Waiter looks pained

&gt;Probably wondering if his tip is going to suck

&gt;Realizes I'm also in pain.

&gt;Sympathetic look from low-rent Jude Law.

&gt;She beast orders three appetizers without even asking me.

&gt;Goodbye credit card.  Was nice knowing you.


I didn't even bother to make small talk because she started ripping on every single skinny person around us, and doing it rather loudly.  She really was one of the worst fucking people I had ever met in my life.  I couldn't fathom why FakeFriend had set me up with her...at least at that moment.  It would clear up pretty soon, though.

&gt;breadsticks are here!

&gt;I love breadsticks!

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;Swamp Thing just grabbed the basket from him

&gt;I want to cry

&gt;""What can I get for your entree tonight?""

&gt;Oh, right, entree...

&gt;""Fettucine with shrimp, please.""

&gt;Maybe that will make me happy

&gt;Holy shit bread crumbs are exploding across from me

&gt;""Dressing with your salad?""

&gt;""Caesar please, or your house dressing is fine.""

&gt;Bellowing build up...

&gt;Planetoid uses FATLOGICBELLOW!  It's Effective in her mind!

&gt;""Salad is terrible for you!  You need more food than just that!""

&gt;I like salad.

&gt;Especially with caesar dressing.  Fucking delicious.

&gt;""I'll be fine.  This is a lot of food for me.""

&gt;Bears mentioning that I was around 200 pounds at 6 feet tall.  Carried well, thanks.

&gt;End of FATLOGICBELLOW in three...two...one...

&gt;""THAT ISN'T ENOUGH FOOD, GNPUNK!  WATCH ME!""

&gt;Oh no...

&gt;here it comes

&gt;That sound was my wallet crying in my pocket

&gt;""I'll have three Tours of Italy!  Oh, and spaghetti with meatballs!""

&gt;.....four?

&gt;did you just order four fucking entrees?

&gt;hamplanet, I am not on fucking salary

&gt;waiter nods, fearful to say anything else and runs away

&gt;take me with you

&gt;take me to the hot hostess please

My brain was trying to figure out what to do at this point.  She had just ordered $100 in food and was already halfway through a margarita because LOLDRINKINGISBADEXCEPTWHENSHEISN'TPAYING.  There was no way I was putting up with this...was I?  Oh god...we agreed to go to a movie afterwards, too.  The thought of this whale trying to cram into a theater seat was not entertaining at all since I was with her.  Any other time?  Hilarious.  I got nauseous at that point just as the salad came from a combination of thinking about all of this and watching her destroy the basket of breadsticks.  Her offering me a half eaten one almost made me barf right there.

&gt;Yay salad!

&gt;YAY BREADSTICK WITH SALAD!

&gt;Oh god, her appetizers are here

&gt;wonder if she'll even taste them

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;Ugh...this is making me ill.

I got about four bites of my salad down before I couldn't take it and got up, saying I might be a few minutes and wasn't feeling well.

&gt;""I TOLD YOU SALAD WAS BAD FOR YOU, GNPUNK!""

The plot really thickens with this story while I was in the bathroom.  The waiter was coming by to see if we needed anything else and interrupted tub-of-fun as she was on the phone....with FakeFriend.  The waiter immediately realized just what was going on.  Luckily for me, JudeLaw was very sympathetic and did me a solid.

&gt;didn't throw up, hurray!

&gt;still don't feel well

&gt;doubt I'll even eat anything

&gt;doggie bags rule

&gt;not putting up with the theater

&gt;My waiter is...is he waving me down?

&gt;""Sir, I don't mean to intrude on your date, but there is something you should know.""

&gt;That she is a detriment to the human race?

&gt;The most disgusting thing you've ever seen?

&gt;Incapable of satisfying her own hunger?

&gt;I'll take D) All of the above, thanks.

&gt;""What do you mean?""

&gt;Waiter takes a deep breath

&gt;""I was coming to check on your drinks and she was on the phone...""

The waiter explained to me that he overheard tub-of-fun saying how great it was that this practical joke was going so well.  I'll shorten up the exchange by basically saying that FakeFriend was apparently getting back at me for losing money at poker, and what better way to do it by making me pay a ton of money on someone I obviously wouldn't give a shit about.  Originally, I had wondered if I did something to piss off FakeFriend's girlfriend, but now I realized she probably had nothing to do with it.

&gt;pissed off at the world

&gt;mainly just FakeFriend

&gt;going to kill him

&gt;wonder if they serve shrimp in prison?

&gt;probably not

&gt;there has to be a way out of this.

&gt;should have realized that this was a....help me out here, [Firefly](http://i.imgur.com/9PPcjEI.gif)

&gt;thanks bud

&gt;what the hell do I do?

&gt;sit back down at the table

&gt;appetizers are obliterated

&gt;my breadstick is gone

&gt;sadface.jpeg

&gt;can't eat salad anyways

&gt;""Good for you, GNPunk!  I told you salad would just cause problems!  That's rabbit food anyways!""

&gt;That salad was tasty...

&gt;you know nothing...Jon Snow?

&gt;reference works

&gt;entrees are here

&gt;second waiter looks confused

&gt;he's holding five plates for two people

&gt;don't even ask, man

&gt;JudeLaw hands my fettucine to me

&gt;He can tell I'm upset beyond belief

&gt;wheels are turning, though

&gt;GENIUS STRIKES ME!

&gt;tub-of-fun doesn't even know I exist right now

&gt;smirk comes to my face

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/JvwbMVM.gif) I realize what must be done

The walking planet destroys her entrees one at a time, barely stopping for breath and to drink her second margarita.  I have finished my jack and coke out of the need to not waste alcohol and barely touched my fettucine.  I've resigned myself to the fact that it's coming with me to my home tonight.  My plan is taking shape and I realize that it must be pulled off with a little help from my new friend, JudeLaw.

&gt;timing is everything

&gt;holy fuck she destroyed all of those plates

&gt;crap

&gt;she's eyeing my plate.

&gt;fuck you, blob.  this is mine.

&gt;""Oh my god, GNPunk, you didn't eat a thing!  You're going to get so skinny you'll dry up!""

&gt;I doubt you're concerned over me, two-faced bitch

&gt;You have no clue what I'm capable of when pushed far enough.

&gt;lol you're about to find out, though!

&gt;JudeLaw is back.  Asking about desserts.

&gt;....did she say three pieces of Tiramisu?

&gt;She really is out to make me pay, isn't she?

&gt;Waiter looks at me and I don't even say anything.

&gt;He asks if I need a box.

&gt;I nod.

As soon as JudeLaw left, I excuse myself with the ""not feeling well"" excuse.  The black hole of Olive Garden didn't even hear me as she was now making sure every last scrap of food was gone from her plate and had turned to the refill of breadsticks.  Fine by me.  Gave me my escape.  I caught up with JudeLaw as he was getting to his server's station on the opposite end of the restaurant.  Perfect.

&gt;""Hey, JudeLaw!  Can I have a minute with you?""

&gt;JudeLaw looks a bit confused, though he seems to have a smirk on his face

&gt;Maybe he knows what I'm planning.

&gt;""Do you need something, sir?""

&gt;Dude, cut the formalities

&gt;I doubt this conversation will need it.

&gt;AmIevilyesiam.mp3

&gt;""Thanks for telling me about that call she took.  Now I need your help.""

&gt;Yep, he's grinning more.

&gt;loveitwhenaplancomestogether.mp3

&gt;""What's that?""

&gt;Deep breath

&gt;""Split up the check for just my stuff.  I'll give you my card.  Have it ready for me when I get out of the bathroom.""

&gt;JudeLaw looks like he's going to enjoy this.

&gt;Good guy Jude?

Sure enough, he takes my credit card and I duck into the bathroom.  A few minutes later, I come out and my boxed food is waiting for me and my already ran payment of about 20 bucks for just the fettucine and liquor.

&gt;""I'm going to make sure you earn what you'll put up with.""

&gt;JudeLaw nods and grins.

&gt;Dude could be my long lost brother at this rate

&gt;Scary we are thinking the same thing.

&gt;""Works for me.  How much time do you need?""

&gt;""Just wait ten minutes please....then give her the check.""

&gt;JudeLaw and I burst into laughter.  Group of six right behind us are fearful we are blowing something up.

&gt;Note to self:  Come back here in two weeks just to ask how it went

I open up the black check holder and sign off on a 50 dollar tip for Jude.  He's about to earn it while I punch my ticket to Hell.

&gt;grinning like an idiot

&gt;heading up front

&gt;hot hostess standing there, looking bored

&gt;""Oh, you're not leaving with your date sir?""

&gt;Ugh...guilt trip?

&gt;""No, we had a bit of a difference of opinion on things.""

&gt;Hostess giggles

&gt;Damn she's sexy

&gt;""Sorry to hear that, sir.""

&gt;Both of us laugh.

&gt;Definitely not sorry at all.

&gt;GNPunk uses charm!  It's super effective!

&gt;""Are you free next weekend, SexyHostess?""

&gt;Hostess giggles again

&gt;""I might be.  Here.""

&gt;SCORE!

&gt;Number of SexyHostess acquired!

&gt;Your score just went up by 10 points.

&gt;Your score is now 50 out of possible 100 points.  Your rank is now Shotgun Rider to Hell!

I got out of the restaurant, food and phone number in tow, and sped out of there.  I did not want to be within ten miles of the fallout that was about to occur.  After all, I had one more stop on the night to make.

FakeFriend was getting an unannounced visit.

&gt;slow down

&gt;just pray he's there

&gt;fucker doesn't know what he did

&gt;also doesn't realize it didn't work

I pulled into FakeFriend's apartment complex and walked up to his door, knocking on it loudly.  FakeFriend was a few inches shorter than me and about 150 pounds soaking wet.  Sure enough, he opened the door.

&gt;urge to kill, rising

&gt;FakeFriend looks confused

&gt;""Dude, I thought you were out with tub-of-fun?  Didn't go too well?""

&gt;Don't say anything

&gt;Don't give him any satisfaction

&gt;GNPunk used punch to the nose!  It's super effective!

&gt;FakeFriend earns Broken Nose!

&gt;Your score just went up by 50 points!

&gt;Your score is now 100 out of possible 100 points!  Your rank is now on the HIGHWAY TO HELL!

I turned around and left.  I didn't say a single word.  I just punched him dead in the face, broke his nose, and then left.


**EPILOGUE!!!**

I ended up calling SexyHostess the next night to see about that date and to find out what the hell happened.  Turned out that tub-of-fun, in all of her excitement of being a part of this sick practical joke, had left all forms of payment at her place.  Serves her fucking right.  JudeLaw apparently had to get the manager, who explained most of the story (leaving out the part where he actually knew I was sticking her with the bill) and claimed ignorance on what happened to me.  Her bill was over $100 and ended up having to arrange to pay it at a later date when she could.  She had to give them all her information and everything.  Of course, this was AFTER a nuclear explosion when JudeLaw gave her the check.  Much bellowing occurred and many jimmies were rustled.  SexyHostess and I had a few dates, nothing major, but did enjoy some sexytimes together.  FakeFriend's girlfriend broke up with him after finding out what he did to set me up and used her as the excuse.  She came over a couple of weeks after the fallout to apologize for him half-heartedly, but mainly to say she was just sorry I had to deal with it.

**TL;DR:  Evil practical joke backfires.  I stick tub-of-fun with check and break FakeFriend's nose.  End up having sexytimes with SexyHostess!**"	t5_2vzax	True
1373141089.0	1hrj21	Gym Class Trauma: Dwarf Planet vs. Nerd Girl [Long]	Poor-Yorick	473	94	70	"Hey guys! I'm assuming this is where I put my spiel about this being my first time posting, and how I'm new to the sub, etc. Try as I might, I can't seem to get the hang of greentext, but I thought you fine folks might enjoy this little tale anyway. 

To start, I'm currently 18 years old. 5'6"", 123 lbs. Frequent hiker, rock climber, generally outdoors-y person all my life (including the time this takes place). This tale begins around 2005 or so, when I was a wee little fifth grader at a small-town elementary school. I mean ""wee little"" in a very literal sense here, I was a good 4 or 5 inches shorter than the rest of my class, very small and skinny for my age. Around this time, my school caught a windfall and decided to install a sort of horizontal [rock wall](http://www.swlakids.org/new_folder/Rock_Wall_web_2.jpg) in the gym. It stretched along one side of the room, and was short enough that it didn't require much safety equipment beyond pads on the floor and a ""spotter"" on the ground below the person climbing. Me being a major tree-climbing tomboy, I was very excited to try out ""The Wall"" (as they called it) when it opened. 

However, that very same week, my class received a new student. She was a disagreeable girl of considerable size, nearly as wide as she was tall, who we'll call Pluto for the sake of this retelling. Now, me being the friendless individual I was, I tried to make nice with this interloper. We became sort-of friends, but what usually ended up happening was her being nice to me, then turning around and making fun of me in order to make other people like her. Granted, most people did the same to *her* but the fact remains, I was the easier target in this situation. The town I grew up in was fairly affluent and mostly full of little baseball players/cheerleaders, but heavier kids weren't uncommon in the surrounding area, and you were more likely to be picked on for being short or skinny or poor rather than for being fat. Despite her behavior, I was determined to gain at least one friend before I headed off to junior high, so I stuck with her for what seemed like the longest week of my life. Sat by her in class, where her beady little eyes never left *my* paper (because apparently wearing glasses automatically makes you ""smart""). Sat by her at lunch, where any food left untouched for more than 30 seconds warranted an ""Are you gonna eat that, Poor-Yorick?"" alongside much whining about small portions and cheapskate lunch ladies. I didn't always have as much to eat at home, so despite my being extremely beta, I was greedy about my lunch. This did not please the Beast one bit, and led to disparaging remarks about every aspect of my person she could find to insult. On Monday I was firm about holding onto my food, but by Wednesday I had given up and was forking over maybe half of what I was served. 

Then on Thursday, wonderful news arrived: ""The Wall"" was open for business. 

I stood on my toes at the back of the class and listened eagerly as our teacher explained the rules. No pushing, no shoving, form a line, all that jazz. She began laying out mats and explaining our first game: we were to climb across the wall once using any handholds available, then repeat using only the red/green/etc. By this point I was practically vibrating with excitement. Pluto, on the other hand, stood off to my right looking like Twinkies had gone extinct. I chose to ignore the clouds gathering across her pug-like face, and scooted a few inches away to get a better look. However, as the class began to line up, the teacher uttered a phrase that will be forever seared into the darkest part of my memory:

**Partner up!**

*Partner? For what?!* I thought to myself. I'd always enjoyed climbing trees and rocks and such, so as she went on to explain the mechanics of spotting one another, I mentally rolled my eyes at the thought of needing help to get six inches off the ground. Furthermore, the only person I knew in the class was......you guessed it, Pluto. As the rest of the class scrambled to pair up, I was unsurprisingly left standing alone; when I turned to find my partner-by-default, however, I realized she'd vanished. I quietly moved to the back of the line, hoping no one would notice and I could get through the line alone or with a teacher's help. 

My classmates began scrambling across the wall in pairs, and Pluto's disappearance was erased from my mind. Then, the windows shook. The sky darkened. Children cowered in terror as an ear-splitting **""NOOO!!""** split the air and Pluto thundered across the room, teacher in hot pursuit. Apparently, she'd tried to sneak into the bathroom to avoid any sort of physical activity. Luckily for her (and incredibly unluckily for me), running across the *whole entire elementary school gymnasium* was just too much for her and she stopped about halfway across, with a face as red as a cherry and snorting like a charging bull. She made some excuse about her KNEEEEES and her BAAACK and her ASTHMA ATTACKS but the teacher was having none of it. Suddenly, as she glanced toward the class standing in pairs, a stomach-turning thought hit me, and I knew what was coming out of her mouth next. 

*""Miss Gym-Teacher, I can't do it because I don't have a partner!""* 

She pulled an Oscar-worthy pout as she said it, lower lip trembling and watery eyes gazing pitifully around the room. I hid behind the nearest clump of kids, hoping my size would render me invisible. Apparently it did, because after scanning the group for a moment, the teacher sighed and asked ""Would anyone like to come be Pluto's partner? Remember the way we're supposed to treat new students!"" Not a single hand went up, and the whole class was suddenly enraptured with their shoelaces. Looking back, I feel bad for the teacher, she was faced with a difficult decision here. A child Pluto's size would be difficult for an *adult* to catch, but surely she couldn't do much damage when she's 18 inches off the ground? Nevertheless, we were lined up along the wall and numbered off into new pairs chosen at random. There was much weeping and wailing from my classmates as they suddenly found themselves paired with people they didn't know. However, as fate would have it, I managed to land the short stick yet again and wound up arbitrarily paired with Pluto. 

As I stood in the line listening to her grumble, I got a wicked idea. Her sloth-like gait wouldn't do much good to catch me if I fell, and if I were to climb faster than she could run, I could complain to the teacher that having her as my partner was unsafe. It *was* unsafe, as it turned out, but for reasons yet unknown to me or anyone else. So I stretched my skinny little arms and rolled my skinny little shoulders and when it was my turn to scale the wall, I took off like a rocket. Years of hiking and rock climbing with my dad suddenly paid off, and as I reached the halfway mark, I glanced back to see her a good 10ft behind me, lumbering forward with pure hate in her eyes. I turned and tried to keep going when yet *another* earth shattering screech echoed through the room, followed by a dull **THUMP** like a sack of flour falling off a cliff. This unexpected noise was too much for my nervous disposition; I lost my grip and fell flat on my ass. Pluto was no closer than she had been before I fell, and was sitting on the mat with her arms crossed and her jowls quivering like frightened Jello. 

""Teacher! Poor-Yorick is going too fast, I can't keep up and it's not fair!"" 

This child had literally stopped walking, sat down, and started pouting. Victory was in my grasp, but once again, my desire to be liked won out. I gritted my teeth and stood up from the mat. Despite her shooting dagger glares and the class balking at me over her shoulders, I walked over and offered her a hand to get up. The teacher seemed pleased by this, and asked us to continue, adding ""...and try to go a bit *slower* this time, Poor-Yorick. Just to make sure you're safe."" 

I sighed and continued my trip along the wall, considerably slower to keep up with my partner's deliberately lackadaisical pace. When I reached the end, I hopped down and wandered over to the opposite wall where some of the other kids were standing. Surprisingly, my little stunt had earned me a sort of heroine-status, as if by embarrassing her I'd defeated some kind of monster. I chatted away with a few of them while the rest of the class climbed, and found some common ground in our mutual dislike of Pluto. Unfortunately, this conversation didn't last long. The worst was yet to come. 

A whistle from the other end of the room signified the end of the first round, and as we lined up again I found my brief popularity in the path of a great cosmic wrecking ball. Perhaps it was karma paying me back for making Pluto look bad. Perhaps it was just fate. Either way, the nauseating *gravity* of the situation took hold as I realized it was *her* turn on the wall. My first thought was there was no way she would make it across. My second was a mental estimate of how tightly the climbing surface was bolted down. Horrible visions of cracking plastic and crumbling walls came to mind, but I shook them out of my head and prepared for the worst. As the line grew shorter and shorter, I closed my eyes and prayed to every god I could think of, begging for death or a different partner. 

A few eternities later, our number came up and it was Pluto's turn to conquer The Wall. I should probably restate a fact I mentioned earlier, although I'm not 100% on these numbers (and hindsight tends to exaggerate a little), I was roughly 4"" shorter than her and very nearly 100 lbs lighter. She was tall for her age and very round. I was short and slightly undernourished, although years of excelling in all things gym class had given me a bit of an inflated ego about my size; that is, I thought I was bigger (and stronger) than I really was. So, blissfully unaware of the danger I left my dignity at the starting line and went to take my place. I cracked my knuckles, set my jaw, crouched on the safety mat behind her, and waited. 

And waited. 

And waited. 

It eventually came to my attention that Pluto was not planning on climbing. She stood with her feet spread and her arms crossed, glaring at me and very obviously not moving. The teacher scolded, then yelled, then begged, but she wasn't budging. It wasn't until the class asshole began making pig noises at her and the rest of the class started chanting ""Do it! Do it!"" that she broke her defiant stare and began to cry. However, the tears were very real this time, and that was a feeling I knew all too well. She was ill-mannered, she was mean to me, above anything else she was just unpleasant to be around; but she was still being teased. So, against my better judgement I came to her defense. ""One time,"" I told her. ""Do it one time and you'll never have to do it again. It's not that hard, see?"" I tried to show her how simple it was, how it was low to the ground and easy to climb. She made some remark about me being butch and shook her head, which sent snot flying in my direction and the class erupted into fits of laughter. It was about this time that I'd. had. enough. 

*""Look, Pluto. You hear that? They're laughing at you. Laughing at US. You want that? I don't. I'm tired of being laughed at because of you. Get up there before I throw you.""*

This was the first time in my life I'd raised my voice at school. Pluto (along with the rest of the class, the teacher, the student aid, and anyone else in earshot) was flabbergasted. I glared at her until she shot me a nasty look before turning, grumbling under her breath, back to the wall to start climbing. She stood on her toes and attempted to reach for the highest hand-hold available, and gave up after not reaching it. The teacher and student aid walked over, literally picked her up and placed her on the wall. 

Once I removed my jaw from the floor I resumed my crouching position behind her, unaware of what was about to happen. 

*One step.*

She wobbled slightly, but regained her balance.

*Two steps.*

More wobbling, and she's getting shaky.

*Three steps.*

A missed foothold sends her lurching sideways. She desperately claws the air for any sort of grip, I jump forward to help but it's too late.

One final shriek flies out of her mouth, and I realize far too late what is about to happen. She loses her grip entirely, and I scramble backwards to get my footing but the mat is too slippery and my second-hand shoes are too worn down. 

She falls in slow motion, a screaming mass of sloshing fat and flailing arms reaching terminal velocity as ~150 lbs of pre-pubescent flab hurtle toward my face. The next thing I can process is the back of my head making contact with the linoleum floor. I hear a sickening *crrrrunch* and feel a sudden POP in the center of my face, followed by every inch of my body screaming in pain as the air is crushed out of my lungs. I struggle to right myself and realize I'm stuck and being smothered by her massive girth. She's still screaming (although the sound is muffled by the fat covering my ears) and rolling side to side like a turtle that's been rolled on its back. To make matters infinitely worse, the *smell* hit me as I was trapped there. Her thrashing around did nothing to lessen the suffocating mass covering my face, and the stench was one of leftover food, sweat, and too much cheap perfume covering something similar to wet dog. 

*This is the end,* I thought. *Tell my parents I love them.* 

And then, a miracle. Every adult in the room had rushed over to help, the weight was suddenly lifted and a rush of clean, glorious air hit me. I bolted and collapsed in a heap a few feet away. The crunching sound was not any of my bones, but my glasses. My nose had been flattened by the impact, and her flailing had smeared blood all over my face and shirt. I was furious, but too stunned to do anything about it. I gasped and choked as I tried to breathe again, being crushed to the floor had knocked the wind out of me.

1371751423.0	1gqorz	Uncle Tito and His Rotting Foot	kitsuneninja15	445	66	115	"Earlier this week, my immediate family and my aunt's immediate family went on a vacation that we had been planning since almost a year ago. We were to fly to Baja, California to hike and ultimately fish in one of the most beautiful lakes I'd ever seen.

We were waiting at the airport for my uncle's family to arrive when my younger cousin jumped on me, trying to scare me. The families greeted each other and my uncle introduced his brother, Tito. Tito was still slowly making his way to us, and when he finally neared, his stench of a combination of body odor and not-quite-sure-what-else gently wafted towards us. While not entirely unbearable, it was certainly repulsive. He looked to be an inch or two over 5 feet, but what he lacked in height, he made up in girth. 

""Hey, guys!"" He managed to pant out, extending a sweaty hand towards my father and grinning widely, ""I'm Uncle Tito!""

He was polite enough to greet us with a handshake and my father complied. We knew nothing of 'Uncle Tito', nor of what sort of person he was.

""Great to meet you, Tito,"" my father politely smiled back, ""I wasn't expecting you to be joining us!""

A quick explanation from my uncle and it was hinted that Tito had invited himself. So far he seemed a rather jolly fellow, albeit a little out of shape, so we put it out of our minds, expecting still a good vacation. Personally, I was wondering if he would be able to hike the trails.

Luckily for us, we were not seated anywhere near Uncle Tito on the plane, since he bought his tickets much later than we did, he ended up in the back of the airplane. The women on either side of him didn't look too happy to suffer his stench, one of them was pressed against the side of the plane, the other hanging over the aisle. Tito seemed blissfully unaware of the discomfort he was causing, and continued to happily munch away on the backpack of snacks he brought with him. I could have sworn he ate an entire box of moonpies and what could have literally been the last box of twinkies on earth during the 2 hour flight.

To be honest, the trip itself went very well, no hitches. Tito did complain once or twice about walking too fast, but generally, he kept the pace fairly well. We did not have to even take too many breaks because of how scenic our hike was. My dad, being an avid photographer, would often stop to take pictures of everything.

We didn't even have too many problems with him except for his incessant chattering about silly things like how the birds here weren't as fat as the pigeons back where he lived, and how he once went to a local bar and won a game of darts, and so on and so forth.

It wasn't until the last day when we got back from an entire day of fishing that any of us had any serious issue with him. We were sitting outside of our hotel, at a small outdoor cafe, just chatting with each other, when we hear the most disgusting noise, an awful, awful, drawn out ""Sqqqqueeeelllllllcchhhhhh"". 

We all turned towards the source of the sound. Tito was slowly removing one of his socks after a long day of fishing, revealing a foot that was not the color it should have been, oozing pus from every pore. There were little bubbles of flesh rising up from his foot, each of them excreting some foul, yellow fluid. His foot was so infected and so filled with pus that when he removed his sock, it started slowly dripping from his foot onto the floor, making a small puddle next to the pus-soaked sock he had dropped on the ground. 

Then the smell. Oh god, the smell. 

It smelled of excretion, of death. It was literally the smell of rotting flesh. 

I couldn't believe it. Nobody could believe it. I could not tear my eyes away, we were all frozen, staring at his foot, wondering what the hell could have happened for his foot to become that way. 

""Were you walking on that all day?!"" My father jumped to his feet and his face, pale with concern, ready to call for a doctor. 

""Oh,"" Tito waved his hand dismissively, ""I'd been walking on this for a while now, it's no big deal.."" 

""No big deal?! Your foot is completely infected, you need antibiotics and a clean wrap!"" 

""Eh, the doctor gave me some pills, but they didn't taste very good, so I left them at home."" Tito was now picking at the dead flesh, tearing off pieces here and there, unceremoniously dropping them to the ground.

Here, my mother excused herself to our hotel room.

Any sort of redeeming qualities Tito had were now completely overwhelmed by his stupidity. After prodding him for more information, he revealed that he had visited the doctor two weeks after he noticed one evening that his foot looked strange. He was instructed to keep his feet dry, bandaged, and was given antibiotics to treat the infection. He did none of these things and even went fishing, where his feet would be submerged in water for hours at a time. The doctor, at that appointment, did some blood work and diagnosed him with Type II diabetes (Surprise, surprise...), which explained his lack of reaction to the pain, having already lost all feeling in his legs.

Later on we discovered that the infection was caused by him stepping on a toothpick. It had impaled through his foot, and he hadn't even noticed. We, however, noticed when he picked enough at the dead skin in his foot to see it. When he finally managed to extract it, it removed an entire chunk of meat with it. 

We told him that he was probably going to lose his foot to the infection and the diabetes, but he just grinned happily and exclaimed how excited he was to become a pirate (???). 

When Tito went to find food while we were waiting at the airport for our return flight, our uncle came up to my father and apologized for his brother. He promised that if we ever were to plan another trip, he would exclusively not be allowed, and apologized profusely for his brother's behavior.

I still cannot get the smell out of my lungs.

The next morning I head off for the interview. Upon arrival, I inform the Hostess I'm meeting with a manager, all good, she brings me to the back office, several girls there for interviews. We're all nervous, same boat as me. With only four of us, we start with group interview, to discuss Hooter dress codes, uniforms, customer service.

""Table for one?"" The Hostess asks. Because the restaurant was pretty dead, we were sitting at a table.

**""AH'M HURR FOR AN INTERVIEW""** She spots the manager. **""WE SPOKE ORNA HOTMAILS LAST NIGHT""**

&gt;[Oh hurray she's here for the party.](http://iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/gifs/grumpy-cat-confetti-friskies-ad-celebration-1365182411a.gif)

We all budge over to make space for Snorlax. Interview continues. Manager explains uniform sizes to us. Snorlax raises her arm.

&gt;OHGODTHESTINK

**""I NEED A SMALL. I LURK REALLY CURVEH BUT IT'S ALL MUSCLE. I KNOW I FIT IN SMALLS. IT'S MAH SIZE.""**

The smalls are child sized. I don't they'd fit on Snorlax's hands, let alone her WOMANLY CURVES.

Manager is unimpressed. Moving on to benefits, insurance, employee discount etc, staff meals during break. Once again, Snorlax raises a sweaty arm in question. We all pass out briefly from smell.

**""I HAVE A** [wait for it] **CUNDISHEN. I NEEDS TUH HAVE SNACKS AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE OF MUH LOW BLUBBB SUGAR. TEEHEE. IT'S *MEDICAL*. TEE HEE""**

Manager lady is still unimpressed.

&gt;No snacking on shift only during breaks or before/after shift.

Snorlax is visibly upset. Jimmies russling. Manager doesn't give a fuck. Manager is serious business. Snorlax gives Manager that thousand island glare.

Manager reminds us that Hooderps is an equal opportunity employer, they don't discriminate based on sexual orientation, religion, whatevs, and that Hooderps Girls are representatives of an All American girl.

Tiny blond leans over to whisper to me ""Or All Hamerican in lardzilla's case there."" I can't help but laugh. I think me and Blondie are going to get on swell.

&gt;&gt;Blondie is 5'4, 100lbs of adorability
&gt;&gt;Cheeky scamp grin that can turn into the most Puss in Bootiest of Pouts.
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah, we're going to get on GRAND.

Snorlax's superior sense of smell, honed by years of sniffing out snacks must have picked up on something. She's jiggling with irritation at being left out of the joke.

**""WHAT'S SO FUNNEH?""**

""Nothing, just...uh...Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern.""

Snorlax is confused.

&gt;wishes Snorlax would hurt itself in it's confusion.

Manager moves on and explains that she's going to interview us one by one.

&gt; Girl one gets led off.
&gt;5'9
&gt;145lbs
&gt;ex cheerleader - all muscle

Snorlax decides to engage in some psychological warfare to get the edge on us.

**""MUH COUSIN WORKED IN HOODERPS FOR LEIK SIX YEARS. SHE MADE MORE MONEYS THAN ANYONE ELSE. SHE AIN'T AS SLIIIIIM AND CURFFFFY AS ME THOUGH, SO I RECKON I WILL DO BETTER.""**

&gt;&gt;That's nice

Snorlax waddles over to the hostess for a menu. Snorlax orders a mountain of wings with the mild sauce.

**""I'M STARVIN. I BEEN FIGHTING ANOREXICA. TEE HEE. I HAVE TO EAT, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GAIN TOO MUCH WEIGHT AND LOSE MUH CURVES.""**

Snorlax's mouth looks like the maw of that worm thing on that asteroid that the Millenium Falcon lands on. Grooooss. She apparently can't wait for the food she ordered and pulls a McDerps bag out of a flab and starts eating. We are disgusted.

One by one the rest of us get called back for individual interviews.The usual questions get asked, how would you handle this situation? What times can you work? Why do you want to be a Hooters girl? Snorlax keeps on saying how we all might as well leave because she's going to get the job and be the best and make all the money and all the men are going to ask for her and we won't get any tips or tables.

Snorlax's turn, she brings her food with her (it had come out by this time) and waddles over. Blondie dry heaves repeatedly after she enters the office. ""OH MY GOD I THINK I SAW MOULD IN HER ASSCRACK.""

&gt;Blondie is awesome, by the way. I showed her this subreddit later.

PUKE.JPG.

We hear russling Jimmies and shouts from the office.

**""WHAT YAH MEAN I'M NOT SOOT-A-BULL AT THIS TIME!!!""**

&gt;uh oh

Snorlax comes storming out like an angry jello bowl.

""Interview not go well?"" Blondie asks sweetly.

**""YOU ANORECTIC TWIG BITCH. YOU TOLD THEM LIES. I KNOW YOU DID. JUST CUZ YOU A FUCKING STICK AND CAN'T GET NO REAL FRIENDS OR A MAAAAN. YOU JEALOUS THAT I WAS GONNA MAKE ALL THE TIPS AND GET ALL THE GUYS DROOLING OVER ME..WAAARGARBLE ARGBLERABBLEGARBLE""**

Snorlax goes beet red with rage. Manager shows up behind her.

""When you've paid for your meal, please leave. I am trying to conduct an interview.""

Snorlax is confused.

**""PAY? BUT I HAVE. A. KUNDISSSHOOOON. I NEEDS TO KEEP MUH BLOOD SUGAR UP. YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO SIT HERE WITH NO FOOD. THAT'S TORTURE. IT'S TREASON. IT'S ILLEGAL. I. HAVE. A. CONDITION.""**

Apparently she doesn't have money either.

Manager smoothly responds that if she doesn't pay for the mountain of food she's ordered, she'll be happy to ask the police for backup. Snorlax goes white. I've never seen anyone miraculously find $40 so quickly. Once paid, The manager wordlessly points to the door.

Snorlax rolls out after grabbing their basket of wings.

Manager tells us we'll hear back in the next couple days and apologises for the disruption and that they enjoyed meeting all of us. Blondie gave me a grin and hoped we got hired together.

Somehow I don't think Snorlax will get a call back ever.

&gt;Huge ""HARRUMPH'S"" everywhere.

&gt;Dad tries to drown her out by having multiple toasts to his daughter and me.

&gt;Flags down the waiter.

&gt;""Uh wanna 'nother seat. Uh duhn wanna sit next to no chinks.""

&gt;We stop eating and swivel around to stare.

&gt;Waiter just stares.

&gt;""Sorry ma'am, the restaurant is currently full at the moment.""

&gt;She erupts like the volcano of Mount Vesuvius.

&gt;""UH SAID UH DUHN WANNA SIT NEXT TO NO CHINKS.""

&gt;""DEY MAKIN' MAH FUHD ROTTEN-TASTIN'.""

&gt;""DEM SKINNY BITCHES DIRTYIN MUH AIR.""

&gt;She's flopping her arms around.

&gt;My seat is vibrating ohgod.

&gt;When the waiter left to try and find another seating that would accommodate her, we talk about Pharmacy to break the silence.

&gt;She butts in.

&gt;""Yuh bitches are fermerchy muhjor's? Yuh duhn look too smart fer it.""

&gt;""Yuh probably cheated yuh way through.""

&gt;""Yuh probably slept with yuh professuh's tuh pass classes.""

&gt;The dad is now visibly shaking in an effort to lash out.

&gt;He's very proud of us for getting into a Pharmacy school.

&gt;""Excuse me, but I believe you should keep your business to yourself. My daughter and her friend worked hard to get accepted into ______ school.""

&gt;""WELL YUH SHOUHD BE ASHAMED 'CAUSE DEY BE SKINNY LITTLE WHORES.""

&gt;Right before he could say anything, the waiter whisks the thundercunt from her seating.

&gt;We have a heated conversation on how much the woman is a huge mothercunt that night.

And now ladies and gents, please prepare your justiceboner.png.

&gt;Be dad.

&gt;Be pissed as shit about the night before.

&gt;Be janitor.

&gt;loljk, be part of the admission committee for the Pharmacy section of university.

&gt;In office, waiting for next interview.

&gt;In comes the *same* thundercunt from last night.

&gt;Lean forward as she's attempting to pry her roll's from the door frame.

&gt;Plaster a huge smile (genuine).

&gt;The moment she turns to look at him, her face blanches.

&gt;She recognizes the father.

&gt;She opens and closes her jaw like a goldfish.

&gt;He simply shakes his head.

&gt;Bitch turns to leave, dejected and rejected.

1373224333.0	1htdim	Fatass Coworker Part 1: A New Beginning	ArisaMiyoshi	459	82	102	"Hello everyone! After having my fill of McDonalds and diet soda (need to watch my weight!), I have returned with a new series. I thought that [Freshman Fatty](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gng6e/freshman_fatty_final_the_hungry_strikes_back/) would be the only hamplanet I would ever meet, being in a country with fatshaming culture. Several years after I met her, I was proven wrong. She still held the record for largest, though.

Meet Fatass. Around 5'9"" and what I estimate to be a bit short of 300 lbs. Why fatass? Because he's fat, and an ass.

&gt;Be me, at first day of work in an IT company

&gt;Start of 3 week training for new employees on how to use company development software

&gt;Sit quietly, in an aisle seat in the meeting room for our first day orientation

&gt;Suddenly grasp my chair and my pen for note-taking nearly flies out of my hands as I get pulled into an immense gravitational field

&gt;Nope, it's just Fatass, entering the room with a bag of chips and a can of coke

&gt;Manager arrives soon after and I forget about Fatass, who keeps eating throughout the orientation

&gt;At least he's quiet, and somehow cleverly hidden

&gt;For lunch, we were treated to a buffet at a nearby restaurant

&gt;Excited since that place has a sushi bar

&gt;Fast forward a bit, happily eating a delicious spicy tuna sushi roll

&gt;Fatass arrives at the table across from me

&gt;Carrying two plates fully loaded with various fatty beef and pork of nearly every variety the buffet had

&gt;Watch with morbid fascination as he devours the meat mountain

&gt;Some people have also stopped to watch from the corner of their vision, even some of the managers that came with us

&gt;Heard later he was the last to leave, still trying to pack in a dozen scoops of ice cream for dessert

But I'm not showing the ass part yet, am I?

&gt;Next day

&gt;Fatass is part of my training group

&gt;Comes in with his 'breakfast', two Big Mac meals from the 24/7 McDonalds

&gt;Shake my head, remembering Freshman Fatty a bit

&gt;Instructor comes and lesson starts, which is uneventful

&gt;Lunchtime rolls around and in a display of team bonding, we all go out to eat

&gt;Guess what Fatass suggests

&gt;I order some spaghetti (yes this is McDonalds), fries and Sprite

&gt;Fatty goes for an encore of his morning performance

&gt;During the discussion, it came out that my family is rather well-off

&gt;Saw his face immediately contort

&gt;""Why do you even have to work here, just leave and sleep at home""

&gt;He grabs my remaining fries

&gt;""You don't need these, just eat somewhere more your level""

&gt;I get steamed but stay quiet, didn't want to yell in front of everyone I just met and give a negative impression

To clarify, yes, my family is well-off, but we climbed back up after being buried in debt before, causing me to stop my schooling for a while to help out at home. I never asked for anything either; I saved money for the things I want.

&gt;Next day, lunchtime again

&gt;We just decide to bring up food from the cafeteria floor

&gt;Fatass comes in with several boxes of food, looks at my meal of rice and chicken

&gt;""Why are you eating that stuff, that's too poor for you""

&gt;He makes a gesture that implies he wants to grab my food

&gt;I give him the dirtiest glare I could come up with, and he backs off

&gt;Finishing my meal, I bring out a small roll to top off my rather delicious lunch

&gt;Suddenly, the roll disappears from my hands

&gt;Had I become a magician? No, it's Fatass grabbing my roll

&gt;""This is so plain, are you sure you want to eat it?""

&gt;Then in front of me, he eats my roll in two bites, giving me a smug grin all the while

&gt;""I did you a favor by eating your low class food, be grateful""

&gt;I give him the ol' glare again, I don't really like to yell, and I was partly stunned by the audacity of it all

&gt;He goes back to his computer, ignoring my look pointed enough to strip paint off the walls

&gt;This is just the third day of work

That was...really the first time I met someone that rude. Freshman Fatty wasn't directly rude to me, and everyone else wasn't quite this level, so this was surprising. Especially since I was a quiet, shy person. He really seemed to have a problem with me in general, which you'll find out if you stay tuned for Part 2!"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; Be pathologist, on the autopsy service

&gt; [mfw](http://i.imgur.com/sD5ht.gif) service is pretty silent all day

&gt; Get oddly paged around 3pm

&gt; Got to figure out what's going on

&gt; Be told there is a new case, not a lot of info on it

&gt; [mfw](http://i.imgur.com/2QGTmBC.gif) middle aged woman, morbidly obese, both legs amputated, found arresting at home

&gt;prettyobvious.beetus.lardaceousbeing.mpg

&gt; Try to figure out if there's any reason to send this creature to the medical examiner. Last thing I want to deal with is another hamplanet, since they tend to be pretty gross both inside and outside.

&gt; [mfw](http://i.imgur.com/K5Mlh.gif) no violence, no therapeutic complications, died in the ED. Just chronic overdose of the good old Lar'Donalds. Even though we have a weight limit to handle, this creature is unfortunately below it (350 Lb). 

&gt; Gottadoit.wav

&gt; Speak to morgue tech to get everything ready and start ASAP. Tell her the entire story and to brace herself for the worst. No one is happy with this. 

&gt; Forward a couple minutes. Down in the morgue. There is a strong pull towards one of the refrigerators on top. 

&gt;Physics are acting weird... when did gravity start pulling us up?

&gt; Open refrigerator. There is a fully grown urban landwhale, lacking both legs below the knee. 128 cm tall, 288 Lb. Calculate BMI to be 78, adjusted to her amputations. I consider contacting the Museum of Natural History, thinking I just discovered a new species, or maybe the last remaining Mammoth. 

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/IWPuJ.gif)

&gt; Have no idea how to bring her down to the table. We decide on using the crane. It still takes about half an hour to bring her down. 

&gt; This planetary mass overflows the entire autopsy table. Her massive, pasty rolls protrude all over the place, with chaffing and blistering of her skin under every fold. Every time you try to move the body, it shakes and waves of fat and skin ripple over her torso.
Pressure ulcers in the back, of course. Not all the way to the bone, but still speaks a lot for her not ever moving. 

&gt;thisisdisgusting.avi

&gt; Ready to start dissecting. All body cavities are full of fat. Intestines surrounded by a thick caking of yellow, sanguinolent adiposity. The liver is fatty to the extent of being the closest resemblance to human *foie gras*.

&gt; Dissect the heart. thisgonnabegood.gif. 

&gt; It is also caked by fat, weighs 1 Kg (for reference, normal is between 200 and 300g, more or less)

&gt; OK, let's cut the heart.

&gt; Coronaries are disgusting, all clogged and calcified. Infarcts everywhere. 

&gt; All arteries are like that. No surprise she ended up losing her legs 

&gt; [mfw](http://i.imgur.com/T582k.gif) all organs are failing and surrounded by mountains of lard. At this point, my entire gear, head to toe, is covered in thick, yellow, slippery, bloody fat.

&gt; Open the stomach. Massively distended, think of a medium grocery bag, filled with partially digested pulled pork. 

&gt; Ask my unfortunate tech to cut open the bowels. 

&gt; Imsoverysorry.wav

&gt; At least 10 pounds of fetid green excrement. 

&gt; nowonder.jpg

&gt; I internally weep for both the tech and me, having to swim and crawl among all this bloody blubber.

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/XWVgR.gif) it's finally over and I feel the urge to wash right away.  

&gt;[mfw](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6fu8dnriW1rwcc6bo1_500.gif) HAES can go fuck themselves if they think dying in your early 50s is normal, a cow-sized heart is healthy and thin privilege is not having every single one of your organs fucked up. The beetus is also a bitch, not an excuse for you laziness and overeating.

1376175664.0	1k447l	Hamplanet goes to the hospital	herewegoagainson	447	73	82	"backstory, years ago I used to work as an EMT, this is the story of how I quit my job... I still have nightmares about this day sometimes

Enter me and my partner, we get a call to a house, all seems normal, typical taxi ride as we call it, knock on the door pick up the patient and ferry them to the hospital. I wish it was that, but as we approached the house we got a whiff of the most foul smelling odor I have ever come across. We thought that the person might have died. We rushed to the door and knock very hard hoping it was not a DOA. We hear a very bitchy ""come in"". So we open the door to find a woman, who I kid you not was over 800 lbs, nude, and sitting in her own excrement. This woman was physically lodged into her sofa and had been stuck there for two days. She was unable to get the the phone on the floor until then. Her home health nurse was on vacation and for some reason another was never sent. Luckily for this charming woman there was a larger minifridge adjacent to the couch stocked full of mountain dew, as well as a book shelf stocked full of high fructose corn syrup in food simulation form aka little debbies store room. At this point my partner and I had been staring at this woman for roughly five seconds and were both ready to vomit, both from the sight and the smell. There was no way to get this woman unstuck without further assistance. We got the fire department on the line, they sent ten guys. I felt bad for not warning them what they were getting into, but we needed the help. Now that we had enough man power it was time to get this woman unstuck. We all had rubber gloves on as well as some hand tools. The only way to get her unstuck was to take apart the sofa. All the while this woman is complaining about her pain and how we had better not break it and so on. Little did she know that the only way to get her out was to take out a wall... After the wall had a tool shed sized hole in it and she was dislodged from the sofa, we put her on the stretcher. This poor machine was rated at 750 lbs. brand new, and was all electric. It was beautiful, this was probably its 20th trip, and its last. As we raised it, it squealed all the way up. We got maybe ten feet with it before it started to buckle, it didn't fail catastrophically, but the metal was bending and it had to go down. So now we had to call another ambulance crew with ""Heavy Lift Gear"" this is a special cot rated at 900 lbs. They had heard about our call by this point and knew what they were in for. They arrived and all of us transferred the woman over to the new cot, This is a really difficult task as you might imagine, with half the crew having to vomit every minute or two due to the smell and sight, as well as textures. We finally managed to get her into the ambulance, the new cot was hurting, but holding, and the ambulance had most of its shock limitation maxed out. But she was out of our hair and on her way to the hospital. It was at this point that I left early and showered for what seemed like an eternity. I told my boss was done the next day. 

You thought that was the end, but it wasn't, I knew the doctor that had to take care of her, other than the stench, and excrement, there was another fluid in the mix. She was on her period, part of that horrible mixture was period blood, I wish I had never heard that, but I did. 

This happened probably 5 years ago, and it still makes me sick sometimes

TLDR: stinky and shitty naked fat lady breaks cot, hole in her houses wall, period blood, and nightmares"	t5_2vzax	True

Enjoy.

I was working in a movie theater when I was 18 and it was a horribly hot scorching day. My mom was in town and decided to be nice and bring me a delicious chocolate shake. It was between movie sets so there was absolutely no one in the ticket atrium and she decided to stay 
and chat for awhile.

A couple minutes into our chat a morbidly obese women and her 10ish year old son come in glistening like hams. The women says she's not seeing a movie but wants to get popcorn and a pop to watch a movie at home. Ok fair enough happens all the time.

I walk over to concession and proceed to get her popcorn. She wants a monster tub (160oz.) with extra butter layered 4 times. Ok 980 cals for the popcorn, 260 cals per pump of butter, 5 pumps per layer, and 4 layers. Ew. Ok fine, I make this horrible thing and she proceeds to pull out a wad of cash from her sweaty gross cleavage. She flops it on the table and it makes a sick splat noise. Nope. I explain to her that its a health hazard for me to touch that and she flips of course. My mom is still idling nearby watching this unfold.

I call down my manager who we explain the situation to and he actually backs me up saying theres no way we're putting that sweaty mass in our till. So she SCREAMS at me, calling me discriminatory because she's poor (what??) and also calls me the dreaded c word under her breath. She gives up after her childish rant and asks if I'll take her debit card. Fine. Well it's sweaty and gross too but I grab a paper towel and just get it over with.

Remember the 10ish year old kid? Well hes running around in circles in the lobby and doesn't realize his mother had waddled her way to the door. So naturally she starts to yell at him at the top of her lungs:

Waddler: ""JASON! JASON! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!? WE DO NOT RUN IN THIS FAMILY!!!""

My mom: ""Cleeeeeeeaaarrrly""

Waddler: ""... lets go Jason. Now!!""

Then they waddled off into the sunset while my manager and I lost it at what my mother had said."	t5_2vzax	True
1373266739.0	1hun1k	Apocalypse fat... the horror.(long)	Combustablesquirrel	438	60	49	"I don't know why, but the fat just keeps following me. Also, sorry to the people I didn't get back to in my last post. I was on my phone and I wanted to keep a bit of a charge for emergencies. 

So there's this state park that I go to about this time every year. I tend to want to be away from fireworks and very few people come to this place simply because to see anything cool, you have to hike in about eight miles over rough terrain.

So I pull up and start getting myself situated, rucksack on, map in the right pouch, etc. That's when I heard the arguing. 

""YOU FUCKING FASCIST FAGGOT!!!""  

That piqued my interest. So I got finished and headed over to the ranger station to sign in and see what was up.

Enter the three huge pigs. They were yelling at the park ranger and just calling him names. I actually know this guy a bit. I've seen him every year and we shoot the shit before I go out. He's willing to bend the rules on certain things except for safety. Hence the argument questioning is sexuality and political orientation. 

""Ma'am this is simply an issue of safety. If you want to camp out at the site close to this station, I'll let you shoot off as many fireworks as you want, but if you do it out there, I won't be able to get to you if something goes wrong""

""Fuck you, my taxes pay for this park! If I want to shoot fireworks, I will! Look at him he's obviously a soldier! Are you going to tell him he can't shoot fireworks!?""

I guess the ball was in my court.

""Hey Ranger Rick."" I always make fun of him.

""Hey Rambo"" Dude always makes fun of my equipment every time.

""He's actually right. The park's maps are 1:100,000 so the distance looks small.  I've got a USGS 1:25,000 map and there's a whole lot of 'what the fuck' between where I'm camping and civilization. If you blow your hand off, you're screwed because that's a rough hike.""

She blew me off and Rick(not his real name, obviously) finally broke the stale mate and said ""Look guys(to the family), I'm done with this. If you don't sign in with your name and where you're going to be, and if you don't stow those fireworks in your vehicle, I'm arresting you the minute you step out onto the trails. Your move."" 

The father grumbled and waddled his way over to the car with the(we thought) only pack of fireworks. And Rick starts into his lecture on the dangers of the mountains. 

I hand him a spare map with my planned route and itinerary, sign in and head off on my my hike. You have to understand, the first quarter mile of the trail is easy. It's actually paved. Even with a cane, it's a pleasure cruise. My compatriots however, started complaining after the first five minutes. There wasn't a lot to complain about. The view was amazing. Even with the storm clouds rolling in, it was awesome. Then we hit the main trail. 

Holy mother of god, there was no end to the bitching. All of it was entirely their fault. They stopped for lunch and the father pulls out a bucket of cold KFC. There's no way that thing was still warm. They tore into it like a pack of dogs on a three legged cat. 

I pipped up ""Guys, you really shouldn't eat that much...""

when the father interrupted me with ""Are you calling my family fat!? Are you!? We'll throw down right here!"".

""...if you're hiking. Your body will cramp up because it's using energy to digest the food. Like swimming. Also, you do understand that the BDUs and equipment aren't cosplay right? You don't stand a snowflake's chance in hell if you try to fight me."" 

I got a mumbled ""Whatever faggot, we'll see"".



I waited for them to finish and silently smoked and contemplated their obsession with gay people until we moved out. 

It just got worse from there. This trail, is a nutbuster. It's over rocky terrain, high inclines, and steep downhill paths. It's called an expert trail for a reason. One mile might take you an hour on some parts. Another mile might take you three.

 My mystical prophesy that they'd get cramps proved to be accurate. They were stopping every ten minutes.  

During those stops, I started to feel sorry for the kid. He didn't want to be there. It was obvious that his parents didn't plan on how hard it was going to be. He was hating life. First his back was bothering him. I used 100mph tape and an ace wrap and fashioned him a waist strap for his back back on the first stop. 

The fifth stop, it was raining pretty hard and getting kind of miserable for them, I gave him a handful of hard candy. I told him ""Hey, this is an old road march trick. If you're hurting or feeling tired, it'll give you a bit of energy and give you something to focus on other than the pain"". 

That's when tubby dad yelled at me again. Also, that's when I yelled back. 

He said ""Where's our candy?""

""You don't get any. Frankly, this weather isn't getting any better. I highly advise you guys to turn back now. It's going to be some seriously rough going from here on out.""

""Fuck you! **You** turn back you fucking faggot. Giving candy to a little kid like one of those faggots(That word again, I don't think it means what you think it means). I know you faggots fuck little boys""

Finally ""What the fuck is your problem!? I'm actually straight, not that it's any of your business. You know that hard candy trick? I learned it from a gay army Ranger who is more bad ass than you'll ever be, tubs of fun!""

""Fuck you, my boy is already confused(Me thinks I see the problem). We're out here toughening him up so he isn't a fairy(Sorry, I just don't feel like typing the other F bomb anymore, my IQ was dropping). Now give us the candy"".

""Give us the candy? Fuck you you fat piece of shit! I'm out!"" 



I shouldered my ruck and started walking with him and his wife shouting that I was a fairy behind me. 

I walked for another thirty minutes and it was starting to get dark. This is pretty dangerous on the trails. I stopped to smoke and I tied a red chem light to my ruck. I tend to try to be as visible as possible when I move at night on the trails. Also, that is something you don't even attempt unless you have experience. So I started walking again. 

All of a sudden I heard. ""Squirrel! OOOWWWEEE! HEEELLP, Squirrel! HEEEELLLLP!"" 

I turned and it got much louder. I thought the kid had seriously, like emergency style, hurt himself. I dropped my ruck and hobbled as fast as I could. It turned out that when I turned around, he freaked out because the red light disappeared and he ran into a bunch of thorn bushes trying to catch up to me. 

He's damned lucky that he didn't run off a cliff. If I had turned the corner of the trail in another 100 meters, he might have walked off a 40 foot drop trying to find me.

I cut him out of the thorns and he explained that it got dark so his parents couldn't see. In their fat addled brains, they sent the kid to chase after me, because I seemed like I knew what I was doing.

In my mind, I'm thinking, ""So they said that they think I'm a gay pedophile, but they sent their 14 year old son after me, alone in the dark woods, so that they could survive. Those fat selfish fucks"".

As I'm treating his cuts, what came out was ""It'll be ok, I'm not going to leave you guys behind. I'll make sure you get out of this safely"".

We walked back and found his parents eating, again, and drinking a 2 liter of pepsi each. I can only assume they had been doing this since he left. Again, I'd already told them once that day that this was a bad idea. 

I walked up and said, ""We got off on the wrong foot, so I'll explain the rules to you. Rule one, I don't like you two. From now on, you don't talk to me unless it's to ask a question. If you get confused about anything, fall back to rule one. Now tape these chem lights to the shoulder of your backpacks so I know where you are.""

I didn't really have a problem out of them for a while until we actually reached the campsite. I told them ""It's raining too hard to go near the stream. You guys set up here, and I'll be 50 meters to the West. Don't bother me unless someone is dying. I mean **dying** not **dead**. Dead can wait."" I got grumbles in response, but I was silently pouring over the statistics of how many people went missing in the park, then dismissed the thought because I didn't need the temptation. 

Now, my summer ritual is two fold. I like the peace and quiet. I want to prove to myself that I can still ruck despite my leg. Also I carry a bit of beer and a lot of whiskey. I spend the days thinking about the war, toasting the men who never returned, and generally working through my issues in an admittedly unhealthy, drunkenly way. 

I set up my tent, worked for a bit to get a fire going(wet wood), put my grill on the outskirts of the fire with a can of chili, and finally started into my beer. 

That's when Tubby jr came over. 

""My parent's wanted to know if you could start a fire for them."" 

Rage level, 7/10.

""Look, it's 11 at night. Starting a fire in the rain is tough. Tell, them to go to sleep"".

""Ok"", and he didn't leave.

I finally said ""Did you eat dinner?"" He said that he didn't, he was too busy chasing me, and I told him I'd light them a fire, but pull up a log.

I gave him my food. Let me tell you, that was a very confused kid. He knew he liked boys but his parents only found out recently. So they wanted him to lose weight and make girls like him. His father also wanted to toughen him up. Hence doing this insane trail that could have killed all of them. Let's forget trying to change the kid into not being fat, stop fucking being fat yourself!

I let him eat and told him point blank, ""Look kid, I'm not trying to step on your parent's toes, but being gay isn't bad. I knew some phenomenal gay soldiers. And ""manning"" you up doesn't mean you're not. A lot of them were tougher than I was."" 

""And if you want to get fit, start doing little things. Walk instead of riding the bus. Start running. I was actually classified as obese at your age until I started running. I ran from my house to the stop sign and walked back. Then I ran there and back. Over the course of four months, I kept increasing my distance and speed until I went from obese to a high school athlete. I won trophies and everything.""

Around this moment, where I thought I got through to the kid, Pudge Daddy walked up and said ""Hey, are you lighting a fire for us or what? Oh, can I have a beer?""

Yes, he demanded I help them and asked for a beer. Rage 8.5/10. No he couldn't.

Next day, I hiked around and did my own thing. I fucked up and left my camp by itself. I was used to no one else being there. This was easier because I could leave my supplies and just carry and assault pack and LBE, so I went all over the place. 

The rain made the water falls awesome. I ended up catch an release fishing with survival techniques(nothing pre-made except the line), which is good to practice. 

I came back to find that some of my unopened food and all my whiskey was gone. 

Hmm... who might the culprits be? I walked over and Mother cholesterol was going to town on my whiskey. It was about a quarter low on a gallon of whiskey. I don't drink liquor often, but I was planning on drinking my fill and giving the rest to my room mates after the trip. 

Rage 9/10.

I flipped. I started yelling that they had robbed my camp. I really wanted to kick someone's ass. Being an asshole is one thing, being a thief is another. 

The mother slurred the nearest approximation of ""Well, you should share. We were out of soda, our food smelled bad(because they didn't bring camping food) and we wanted somethin to drink.""

I started yelling and the father did his ""I'm going to kick your ass"" routine again, right in my face. He seemed, not as drunk, but a bit tipsy himself. 

In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have reacted physically, but my camp was just robbed, and the thieves were trying to threaten me. That doesn't excuse what I did, but it explains where I was at in my mind. I took my left index and middle finger, curled them in front of his face while he was yelling, and struck him beneath the sternum with the first two joints of those fingers. It dropped him to his knees.

Mind you, I really struck him with the force of my arm, but it looked like I only used two fingers, I said, ""That's what I can do with two fingers. Fuck with me again and I'll show you some shit. Don't steal from me again"".

Later that night, Tubby Jr came back and asked me if I could light a fire for them again. I didn't even want to deal with them. I gave him a can of sterno and told him to tell his dad ""Do your best"". 

Again, he didn't want to leave. He asked what I was doing with a bunch of drinks in shot glasses around the fire. I explained the war to him and told him I was toasting the dead that I couldn't save. That was the entire point of the whiskey. That's why I was so mad that those pricks stole it. The beginning of the bottle was for me and them. I'd say what I thought about them, I'd tell them that I'd live for them and make them proud, and I'd pour a shot into the fire and drink a shot. 

That's when the fireworks started. I heard whistling and then a BOOM. Time to round up the usual suspects. You need to understand how long it takes a cripple to walk 50 meters through the woods. By the time I got there, so many fireworks had gone off that I realized I was doing recon on the camp without thinking. I saw the figures and was moving around in the woodline to get a a good view of where things were. I was thinking of it like a target. 

That's not a good thing. I walked up and those idiots had a bunch of those kits that they sell for the 4th. They couldn't light a fire, but they were doing their damnedest to make shit explode.

After the incident earlier that day, they put aside selfishness in the interest of self preservation. 

I hiked out early because I wasn't getting anything from the trip because of them.   

They left with me. Funnest moment here. I always let the guys at the ranger station know when I'm leaving. As I was leaving, I got called back.

Rick said ""Hey, the father said you committed a physical assault on him during the trip. I gotta arrest you"". 

I said ""Yeah, after he threatened me for complaining about him stealing from my camp"".

This is why I like this ranger. He told them like it was again. ""You threatened a disabled person. He struck you. That's within lines with disparity of force laws in this state. You stole his alcohol. He shouldn't have had alcohol here, and that's a fine. You stole it, and and threatened him, that means I have to lock you up too. Seriously, go home, or go to jail. Those are your options.""

I'm here. So that's how it worked out. Not a lot of justice, but an interesting story. "	t5_2vzax	True

[The Epic of Porcina – Chapter One](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jdg9e/the_epic_of_porcina_chapter_one/)

[The Epic of Porcina – Chapter Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jdo15/the_epic_of_porcina_chapter_two/)

**Chapter Three**

The meal was finished, and the plates were literally licked clean. Porcina had, showing no noticeable shame, slurped every trace of each entree from each of our three plates, pausing only once to wink at me and state, “I'm *very* good with my tongue!” I offered a forced smile and a nod in return, certain as I was that any similarly sexual language from me would result in another inappropriate outburst from her. I am not, as I have mentioned, a particularly passive individual – especially not back then – but I was quickly learning that keeping quiet was the best way to avoid an embarrassing scene.

When, at last, our waitress returned with Porcina's change, I began to hope that the nightmare was nearly over. Only a few coins were left as a tip, with each of the bills going into an envelope that Porcina kept in her baby blue purse. “You know, a standard tip is fifteen percent,” I said, eying the rather pathetic gratuity.

“She didn't do anything right,” replied Porcina. “I'm not going to encourage bad behavior.” My mind went back to Porcina's own behavior, on which I fought to keep from commenting. Perhaps, I sarcastically considered, the waitress would have been offered more if she had flashed us. Another thought occurred to me then, and before I had given it any due consideration, I heard myself speaking.

“Oh, by the way,” I said, “your breasts looked a bit different from the picture you sent me.”

A cold stare accompanied Porcina's response. “*What* do you mean by *that*?” she demanded. “Do you think I'm just some kind of *slut*? Do you think I show my boobs to *everyone*?”

“That's not what I meant.” I glanced around, hoping that nobody could overhear. “When you showed them to *me*, though, I noticed that they were different from the ones in your picture.”

Her icy gaze persisted a moment longer... and was suddenly replaced by the same beaming smile I had already come to loathe. “Well of *course* they looked different! Those weren't *my* boobs, silly! I wouldn't post *that* on Craigslist!” She finished with a hiss of laughter, sounding for all the world like a cartoon snake with a stutter. Why, I wondered, would she post a picture of someone else's chest, especially when she clearly had no qualms about exhibitionism? I kept my questions to myself, intent as I was on leaving without further incident.

I slid out of the booth and stood, waiting for Porcina to follow me. The least I could do, I figured, was leave on a decent note, even if I would never be speaking to her again. Her own departure was a much more involved affair, a spirited reprise of her method of entry. First, she turned sideways, kicking her feet up onto the bench. With one hand on the table and another on the back of her seat, she scooted herself forward, causing the empty plates and glasses on the table to quiver in time with the quaking of her bloated waistline. She was red in the face by the time she reached the edge of the booth, and she looked up at me with what was likely meant to be an endearing gaze.

“Help me up?” she asked, resorting again to a voice devoid of any maturity. She held out both hands, which I reluctantly took. After a pull from me and an unflattering grunt from Porcina, she popped free of the booth and staggered into my chest. “You're so *strong*,” she gushed. “I bet you like things *rough*.” I offered a noncommittal murmur, and made my way towards the door... only to pause when I discovered that Porcina was quite a ways behind me, having stopped to examine yet another patron's plate. “Ooooooh, I should get *that* next time!” she all but bellowed. “Doesn't it look *good*?”

“It looks great,” I replied. I gave the confused customer a weak smile. “Sorry. Enjoy your meal.” I grabbed Porcina's hand again and rushed for the exit.

“Wait!” she protested. “Stop! Slow down! Wait!” We passed through the vestibule a few second later, and left the diner completely after a brief moment more. “That was...” Porcina panted, her expression one of rage, “that was *really fucking rude*!”

I sighed. “I'm sorry. I wanted to get out of there before our waitress saw what a pathetic tip we left.” Although I didn't say it, I also wanted to spare anyone else who might have had the audacity to order food in the young woman's vicinity.

“She deserved it!” Porcina pouted. “She was *rude* the whole time and she got everything wrong.”

Was it possible, I silently wondered, that my memory had been altered? My recollection of the evening included a forty-something, no-nonsense waitress who had been prompt, efficient, and friendly. The only objectionable person had been Porcina, with her incessant admonishments and abhorrent table manners. I supposed there was a *chance* that I was simply misremembering... but it seemed more than a little unlikely.

My thoughts were interrupted by Porcina switching back to her little girl persona. “Soooo... where's your *car*?” she asked, finishing once more with her snake-like titter.

“Uh... it's over there,” I replied, gesturing towards my vehicle. “Why? Didn't you drive here?”

“Nooooo, my *roommate* dropped me off!” she whined. “I thought you were giving me a ride *hoooooome*.” Again, this had never come up in conversation. In fact, Porcina had given every indication that she had arrived at the diner on her own, and – as her numerous angry outbursts had suggested – would be leaving on her own, as well.

For the second time in as many minutes, I sighed. “I guess I can do that. Let's go.”

The walk to my car was uneventful, if a little bit slow. Porcina spent the time regaling me with a story from her week, in which she was told by one of her professors that if she was absent from class again, she'd lose an entire letter grade. “It's so *high school* there! This is *college*! It shouldn't *matter* if I'm absent!” While I agreed with her to a point, that sentiment quickly evaporated when she mentioned that the class in question met only weekly, and that it required group participation. If anything, it sounded like her instructor was being lenient.

Our arrival at my car was accompanied by a scoff of disapproval from Porcina. “*This* is what you drive?” I merely shrugged and opened the door for her. She didn't so much sit down as she did ooze into place... and then immediately opened my glove compartment and started ransacking the contents.

I walked around to the driver's-side door and let myself in. “Please stop that,” I said.

“*Why*?” she spat. “Are you *hiding* something in here?”

“No,” I replied, as patiently as I could, “but I prefer my things to be neatly arranged, and I don't like it when people go through them.”

To her credit, she stopped rummaging. Then, after a minute, she turned and gave me a quizzical look. “Did you have something in mind?” she asked.

“How do you mean?”

“Well, we're here... in your car...” she continued, her voice getting breathy.

Hormones are a terrible thing. For a moment – just a brief moment – I considered dismissing my resolve. Her unattractiveness aside, I *had* gone out with sexual intentions, and Porcina had shown herself to be prone to some rather exciting behaviors. I had already come this far, I thought... what's the harm in going all the way?

“Are you going,” Porcina said, her childish voice returning, “to do something naughty to me?”

Just like that, my nerves were steeled again. “No,” I replied, “I'm not. You said I wasn't getting any tonight, remember?”

“Are you *suuuuuuure*?” She lifted up her sweatshirt, exposing her unrestrained breasts. Once again, I felt myself slipping. She wasn't appealing by any stretch of the imagination, but something about her wanton promiscuity and overt sexuality was stimulating on its own. Thankfully, a car drove by just then, prompting Porcina to hastily cover herself, and allowing me a chance to reevaluate my priorities.

“I'm sure,” I said firmly. “Thank you for dinner, but I'm just going to take you home.”

Without so much as a sign of disappointment – which, I confess, part of me had been hoping to see – Porcina gave me directions to her apartment. As it turned out, she lived only a few blocks from the college, in one of the miniscule townhouses that I had once considered for myself. The drive was largely uneventful and – to my surprise – quiet. It was only after we had arrived at Porcina's house that she chose to speak up again.

“I promised my roommate I'd bring you inside!” she said suddenly. “Just for a minute!” 

I thought about making an excuse, but I reasoned that with a chaperone present, nothing sinister could befall me. After helping Porcina from my car – an experience not unlike the one at the diner – I followed her into her house.

The place was *immaculate*. I stood, mouth agape, for several seconds, trying to believe what my eyes were showing me. This woman, clad in unwashed sleepwear and slippers, lived in what could have been a scene from a furniture catalog. The floor was freshly vacuumed, the windows spotless... and was that a hint of lavender in the air?

“*LAUREN*!” Porcina shrieked, jarring me from my thoughts. “*HE'S HERE*!”

A door opened to my right, and out walked a girl who, for lack of a better description, matched the state of the house. She was petite, slender, and had her long brown hair pulled back in a perfect ponytail. “Hello,” she all but whispered, her eyes not meeting mine.

“This is Lauren!” said Porcina. “I guess you guys have *kind of* already met!”

“How so?” I asked.

“*You've already seen her boobs!*” laughed Porcina.

The horror I felt in realizing what she meant was only compounded when I saw the look of shame on Lauren's face.

Wow, big response to the first story, thanks for all the kind remarks.  Now onto the next one.  This took place just short of my 2 year anniversary of witnessing the french fry version of Wounded Knee.  Just started the new semester and hadn't really thought about Hamgar since the day I saw him try to attain the next level of diabetes.



&gt;Be me, first day of new semester

&gt;Still 5'8"" but now 185 pounds, with a decent amount of muscle

&gt;Be waiting in classroom for physiology class to start

&gt;Feel heart rate slow to a stop

&gt;Am I having a heart attack?  Has my past as a ham planet finally caught up to me?

&gt;No, time is just being distorted by a massive gravitational presence

&gt;I hear the sound of an approaching T-Rex

(no fucking joke I heard this dude coming from at least 100 feet off)

&gt;The door swing open to reveal the keeper of America's strategic blubber reserves

&gt;Takes me a moment or two to recognize Hamgar 

&gt;He has put on atleast another 20 or 30 pounding now putting him around 5'9"" and ~400 pounds

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/JGx0wZV.gif) Hamgar actually has to SQUEEZE through the door

&gt;Class room is stadium seating

&gt;Balked by stairs, as many wildebeest are, Hamgar chooses a seat in the top row

&gt;Fairly sure that, due to extent of fat folds around eyes, Hamgar can't see anything further away than what he is currently shoveling into his mouth

&gt;Hear a bag of chips beings opened before class even starts

&gt;Hear god awful noise

&gt;Wtf, why are they turning on a wood chipper right outside the room when a class is about to start

&gt;Realize its Hamgar

&gt;He is assaulting the bag of chips like it owed him money (or more likely, food)

&gt;He is sitting 8 rows behind me and I can hear him crunching away at the Doritos

&gt;Clench jaw and bear it, he probably won't be rude enough to do it during class

&gt;Door at front of room opens and professor walks in

&gt;Freezes when he sees what is at the back of his class room

&gt;I can see him accessing his memory banks, if a wildebeest charges, do you stand your ground or run?

&gt;Decides against calling animal control and begins to set up his notes for the lecture

&gt;Hear the wood chipper shut off

&gt;Maybe he isn't a true hamplanet after all

&gt;Nope.jpeg

&gt;Hear the *tsst* of a soda bottle being opened

&gt;Guess at the size of the bottle, 2 litre

&gt;Wrong.gif

&gt;3 litre (yes they exist, we here in Murica take our Beetus very seriously)

&gt;Turn back to face front of class when I hear the sound of a shot vac sucking up liquid

&gt;Turn just in time to see him put his whole mouth over the opening and begin to suck the soda out

&gt;Bottle makes crackling and crunching noise as it bends inwards

&gt;He finished a 3 litre of soda in one bout of gulping

&gt;Must have blow hole on back to take in air while his mouth is full

&gt;Whole room is looking at him

&gt;""What? Chips make me thirsty""

&gt;Professor breaks the silence by starting his opening monologue

&gt;Hands out syllabus

&gt;He is about to explain how the tests will be formatted when the wood chipper starts up again

&gt;Professor tries to soldier through the noise for a minute before stopping and politely asking Hamgar to not eat during class

&gt;""But the syllabus doesn't say anything about no eating during class!""

&gt;Professor says its ok to eat, just try to be more quiet

&gt;Hamgar is for a moment, but evidently his beetus was out pacing the rate of 1 handful of chips every 20 seconds

&gt;Soon he is back to shoveling chips into his mouth like an earth mover shovels dirt into a lake (believe he is now on 2nd family sized bag)

&gt;Professor looks annoyed, ""Hamgar, since you can't eat quietly I'm going to have to ask you to stop eating.""

&gt;Hamgar turns bright red, ""This is discrimination, other people are eating you you aren't asking them to stop.""

&gt;Professor informs the raging beast in soothing tones that other people are eating quietly

&gt;Hamgar continues to rage

&gt; Professor says we will take a 20 minutes break, asks Hamgar to come to the front to see him

&gt;Hamgar, after spending a good 30 seconds trying to get to his feet, looks down the stairs as I'm sure a novice climber would look at Everest

&gt;Tries to take first step, fat knees almost buckles

&gt;Tells professor he can't make it down the stairs

&gt;Professor walks up the stairs and takes Hamgar to the corner of the room to talk

&gt;I pity the poor man having to be in such close proximity to such a foul smell

&gt;I can only hear murmuring from the two

&gt;Things obviously weren't going well when the teacher went to the front of the room, picked up the phone and made a call

&gt;A few minutes later the dean came in

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/S3VpN.gif) I know whats going to happen

&gt;I'm all for being considerate of other people's feelings, but the dean is so much of a pussy I know he will relent before the tearful onslaught of a fatty denied food for 3 hours

&gt;As expected, Hamgar starts to raise his voice

&gt;""But I have a medical condition!  My beetus-thyroid!""

&gt;A few minutes later, the dean leaves and professor goes back to the front of class looking pissed

&gt;Hamgar goes back to his seat and continues his war against the chip kingdom

&gt;As those who left the classroom begin to come back in, none look happy to see Hamgar still sitting there feeding his fat gullet

&gt;Professor begins his lecture but is interrupted a few words in by a *tsst* followed by the sound of a sucking sewer pipe

&gt;2 3 liters of soda in under 2 hours, I'm getting 2nd hand beetus

&gt;Class continues like this with Hamgar going through 3 family sized bags of chips (might have been 4, but I'm not sure) and 3 3 litres of soda in the 3 hour period

&gt;By the end of class that day, I'm sure many of my fellow students had sworn off chips and soda



Every class period Hamgar brought something in to eat, usually noisily.  I'll start posting stories about the more memorable moments of the semester.  I have 3 that I can think of now, but I may remember more as I type them out.

IStopTickleMonsters	452	84	85	"I was in WalBeetus yesterday in the produce aisle, picking up some veggies to cook for lunch when I spot a hamplanet. This female specimen was around 5'3"" (my height) and 300+ pounds. Much to my shock, from out behind this somehow mobile behemoth, steps a mini moon. She was maybe 10 years old, 5'0"" and 230 pounds. This kid was way bigger than I am.


Anyway, I'm walking past them and I hear Mini Moon begging, literally BEGGING for a couple of peaches. Claiming that she has $2 and they are only 98 cents each. I'm just in shock that this child is having to beg for fruit.


In that moment, the hamplanet lashes out and says that she ""don't like fruit"" and will ""get a pack of cookies"" for Mini Moon. So much shame and sadness in that moment as this elementary school child is yelled at for wanting fruit.

1364320980.0	1b1z74	Another horse story.	SometimesIArt	436	62	105	"I got such a strong response on the last one, so I'm pulling out one more. 

First story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ar8op/she_wanted_to_ride_a_horse/), probably best to read at least the ""backstory"" on it.

Just a forewarning, this is really long. 

So this happened on the same farm as in the last story. I wasn't clear, then, I don't work there anymore and haven't for about 8-9 years. Thank goodness, because the owners were awful. 

As I mentioned before, I was the manager of this place and ran it by myself with the help of a small handful of workers. 

A lot of the time, when people came to work there they were 13ish and didn't have a whole ton of horse experience. Which was fine, if they were willing to learn they tended to learn SUPER quick, which was great. 

Enter the story's subject. 

13-14ish, (I was 16 or so), about 200lbs and 5'3""ish. I was fat when I started there and the hard work slimmed me down, so I wasn't judging her based on appearance. She also had no experience, which as I said wasn't new, I knew teaching her would take some time. 

Most workers pick up the basics within two days. They're pretty straight forward. 

So I started her the same way I started everyone else, by walking up, handing her a horse, and telling her to lead it out to the hitching posts and I would be out shortly to show her how to tie. Her question?

""Am I going to ride him?"" 

No, no you are not. First day here, you're going to learn to tie him to a post. 

So we go through the day and she keeps asking if she's going to get to ride, and I keep saying ""no."" Then about halfway through she starts complaining that she's tired and can't keep up. It wasn't that hard of a day, either, mostly a lot of walking. Didn't even need to haul bales. I tell her to go take 5 on the straw bale stack and maybe grab some lunch, but to hurry because she had some pony rides for a birthday party to take care of. 

So she grabbed her large bag of lunch (I remember there were multiple sandwiches, a bottle of pop, some form of chocolate, and who knows what else... but whatever, not judging, remember? Trying really hard...) and plopped onto a bale to dig in while I groomed and saddled the ponies. When I was done, she hadn't shown, so I spent a few minutes adding a couple of things to the ponies to make them cute for the birthday party (if I ever had spare minutes I liked to help the kids out with setting the manes and tails up for braiding and ribbons, you know... girls... haha). And after I was done she was still not there. 

So I go back and she's still sitting there, drinking her pop and texting. Says she's still tired, I pretty much tell her too bad, time to ""man up"" and give her the two ponies to take out so I can get a trail ride ready. 

So she takes off and I know another worker will meet her out there to run the party together and show her the ropes. New workers = pony rides, period. Start with the little ones, move to bigger as you learn more. I get the trail ride ready and take horses out with my favorite coworker/person who actually knows what she's doing, and then go to get the customers mounted. 

Small moon (SM?)'s sitting on my horse. 

*My* horse. You know, the one I owned. 

She is SITTING ON HER. 

Ask her what the hell she thinks she's doing. She says ""I want to help on the trails! So I thought I'd get ready to go!""

The bridle is on wrong. My horse looks miserable. My horse was gorgeous, ([Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/9dMGXPh.jpg)) and sometimes I let the experienced workers use her to keep her fit, but it was rare because *she was my baby*. I told her to get down, now, take the bridle off, and to never touch her again. She whined and said it wasn't fair, called the horse ""her favourite"" (she didn't know I owned her at this point) and that she deserved to ride for all the hard work she'd (I'd) done. 

I make her go back to the ponies. 

She pulled this multiple times over the next week. I'd go out to find her already on a horse and ""ready to go."" I'd taken her out once that week just to see how well she rode, and it was not well. She continually lied about her experience, the work she did, among other things including incredible amounts of fat logic tossed in. 

She was not learning. She still couldn't tie a slip knot properly (it takes 30 seconds and doing it twice to learn), was too lazy to lift saddles, and would conveniently disappear to who knows where when it was time to do any work. 

Literally broke down crying the first day we had to unload square bales from the truck (60lbs each x 1500 of them) because she was too tired and was ""going to throw up."" Left two of use to do all 1500 by ourselves. 

Every time we tried to make her help us clean out stalls (read: poop-scooping) she would break down gagging and choking and run out in tears because ""poo is so gross!"" 

Whenever I asked her to soap down the saddles to keep the leather good, she would whine about it the entire time, do a shit job, then cry when I told her to redo it because she ""hadn't gotten to touch a horse in hours and that's what she's there to do."" 

She would not leave my horse alone. Every day she came up to me and asked if she could ride her. Whined when I said no. Said I was being selfish and unfair. 

Would ask to ride the in-training/young horses. Not sure why she wanted to so bad, but like hell I was letting her ruin them. 

She was always eating. She always had pop, chocolate bars, white bread sandwiches, chips... we would find chip bags crammed into the crevices of the saddle rack, and when we bitched her out she would deny it was her. 

Brought fast food to work a lot, which when you work outside in the hot sun and just drink sugar all day... couldn't have been comfortable. 

One day told a worker she was assisting (watching out for safety of passengers) on a wagon that she knew how to drive a team and told the worker to let her try. So the worker was like, sure, have a go (she's nicer than me) and SM nearly crashed the freaking thing into a bush because she didn't know about keeping tension and the horses took off. Customers almost fell out, too. I was livid.

So, the last day I ever saw her she was in charge of grooming, and she glazed over the other horses and then spent half an hour on mine, and then decided she was going to go all-out grooming her. 

She cut her mane. 

This was my SHOW HORSE. Everyone on that farm knew I was a stickler about grooming and clipping, so they all let me take care of her. Which, you know, is RIGHT. 

She had this gorgeous long, white mane that hung past her neck and was thick and orderly, which takes a TON of work on horses. I spent hours every week giving her a gorgeous mane (supplements/oils/conditioning/protective bagging), and this idiot chops it into REALLY BAD [HUNTER CUT](http://www.regardinghorses.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/finished-mane.jpg). 

The picture I showed at the start was about 2 months after this incident, when it had grown out more. [Here is a picture of a week after](http://i.imgur.com/HOMqIJ2.jpg). She looked hideous. I was livid. Look at how long/nice/full her tail is (ignore the dirt, she'd just had a roll haha)... that's what her mane looked like pre-cut. And her being a show horse, appearance was important, especially after I put so much time and money into it. 

I spent an hour screaming at this girl and telling her if I ever caught her breathing on my horse again I would end her. 

The whole time she is crying and telling me I hate her because she's fat and that she's bullied in school (I wasn't even thin then, I was overweight, just not moon-status...) and I just *wouldn't understand*, that I work her so hard (she had the easiest workload out of everyone) because I hated fat people and maybe I should look in a mirror. 

I told her I was hard on her because she was a shit horseperson, and she just lost it screaming and wailing as if I had stepped on her firstborn child. 

I don't think she ever came back after that. I'm glad. She's the only fat person I ever had to work with on that farm, and I am so grateful for that fact. 

**TL;DR**: Lazy fat new coworker becomes obsessed with my horse. Refuses to do regular work around the farm but found enough time to give ""special treatment"" to my animal and ruin her show mane. "	t5_2vzax	True

**Chapter Nine**

The townhouse was dark and silent when I arrived. Was it, I wondered, a passive-aggressive ploy by Porcina... or had I simply misremembered the address? I took a moment to reorient myself, and concluded that I was definitely in the right place, but the apparent absence of life in the dwelling was something less than encouraging. I approached hesitantly, then pressed my thumb against the dirty glow of the doorbell.

An audible chime sounded from behind the building's threshold, followed soon after by a sing-song voice calling, “Come in!”

I opened the door a crack. “Porcina?”

“In here!” she cooed in reply.

I stepped into the dimly lit room, hoping my eyes would adjust in time to warn me of any incoming monstrosities. What I beheld was a disturbing scene of carnage: Clothes were strewn about the room, as were plastic bags and sandwich wrappers. A smell of something which might have once been appetizing permeated the air, its limited appeal thoroughly marred by the mixed-in stench of sweat and stale perfume. Gone was the pristine landscape of Lauren's home, replaced by the cesspit of offal and excess inhabited by Porcina... though the denizen herself was nowhere in sight.

“Porcina?” I called again.

I could hear her sibilant laugh as she replied. “In here!” she said again. I turned to face the source of the sound, a door kept slightly ajar by a piece of discarded stryrofoam. (Not a take-out container, as one might expect, but a piece of errant packaging, such as one might find in a box for retail electronics.) I had an idea of what to expect when I entered Porcina's room... and it was with some relief that my fears were proven to be unwarranted. I found her laying on her bed beneath a comforter, her eyes glued to a large television set atop a dresser, with one hand firmly grasping a convenience store burrito.

Without wasting any time, I pulled two bills from my pocket. “Here's your fifteen dollars,” I said. As an afterthought, I added, “Sorry it didn't work out between us.”

Porcina let out a huff of fetid breath. “*God*, you make it sound so *dramatic*. It was just a one-night stand. Get over yourself.”

“What?” I scoffed. I know that I should have let it go, but instead I sought to correct her. “We didn't *do* anything! A one-night stand implies that something actually happened!”

“Yeah, okay,” replied Porcina, rolling her eyes. “We did everything else, so whatever. I already told Lauren about it.”

My heart skipped a beat and made a kamikaze run for my stomach. “*What* did you tell her?” Porcina didn't answer. She kept staring at the television, taking generous bites of her bean-and-cheese comestible, while I stood shaking beneath a tidal wave of emotions. “*What did you tell her*?” I demanded again.

“Nothing!” snapped Porcina. She took another sloppy chomp at her burrito. “*God*...”

I fought to keep from exploding. It was, almost certainly, a ploy to keep me interested (since fury and homicidal intent could be loosely classified as interest). At the time, however, I was so blinded by rage, by panic, that I was unable to think of anything beyond determining what she had said, and whether it had damaged Lauren's fledgling perceptions of me.

“Porcina,” I began, trying to keep my voice steady, “this really isn't funny. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea, but spreading rumors about...” I barely stopped myself from saying “about us,” “... but spreading rumors about me isn't an appropriate response.” I moved to step just slightly between Porcina and the television. “Will you *please* tell me what you said?”

“*God* why do you *care*?” the young woman rumbled.

Apparently, my affections for Lauren had gone unnoticed by her roommate. That much, at least, was a very small consolation. “Because it isn't *true*!” I answered. “We went out to dinner. You flashed me. That's *it*.”

“What about when you *kiiiiiissed* me?” Porcina said. Her voice had made a shift toward a childlike tone and meter, but a measure of venomous delight stilled remained. The overall effect was one of whiny, mocking sarcasm.

“*You* kissed *me*,” I coldly replied. “I had no choice in the matter!”

“You liked it,” growled Porcina. “You *liked* it.” She started to sit up, like a monstrous leviathan rising from some unknowable depths... and as she did, her comforter fell away, revealing that my previous fears had been justified all along. With another motion from her hand – the one not clutching the remnants of preprocessed Mexican food – Porcina revealed herself completely, exposing acres of naked flesh pockmarked by valleys of stretch-marks and rolling hills of fat. “You liked it and you wanted *more*,” she hissed. Her voice dropped to a throaty whisper. “You couldn't *wait* to get your hands on me. You've been jacking off all day, just *thinking* about it.”

“Stop it,” I weakly protested. The horror, the hatred, and the thrice-damned *hormones* were all coalescing into a cascade of confusing impulses and instincts. Only my anger, my fear at losing Lauren forever, remained as beacon for navigation in the tumultuous sea of my tempestuous emotions. “*Stop it*!” I said again, louder. I dropped Porcina's money on the floor – let *her* find it amidst the squalor – and backed away from the source of my vexation. “This is *sick*, Porcina. I'm sorry. No, actually, I'm *not* sorry! *Nothing happened* between us, and *nothing ever will*. You flashed me, and *you* kissed *me*... and you know what? It was *disgusting*.”

My words, at last, seemed to have an effect... or perhaps Porcina merely ran out of steam. One way or another, she slowed in her advance and slumped back down onto her bed. My blood was racing through my veins, saturated with adrenaline. I could feel my heart pounding, and I realized that I was short of breath. I stood there, almost panting, as I fought to relax. Despite all of my confusion, I knew one thing for sure: Whatever came next, the worst was definitely over.

Then, the unthinkable happened, and Porcina started to cry.

It started as a puffiness in her cheeks and a squinting of her eyes. Her many chins jiggled as her bottom lip began to quaver, and a honking sob escaped her lips. It was the first of many such noises, each of them escalating in volume until Porcina's entire body shook with the force of her rapid-fire wails. She balled her fists – thoroughly squishing her burrito in the process – and slammed them against her bed, setting herself into a screaming, bouncing tantrum. The force of each rebound rippled through her form, creating a spectacle of undulating skin accompanied by a cacophony of blubbering screams.

Terror consumed me at the sight.

I had to escape.

I had to escape.

*I had to escape*. I stumbled backwards for the door, unable to look away from the raging storm that was Porcina. I may have tried to apologize, or maybe to call for help, but my words were drowned out before they could leave my lips. Then, as I exited the room, I felt my back connect with an object which hadn't been there before... and I turned, wide-eyed, to see Lauren, clad only in her panties.

Suddenly, there was silence; a complete and utter lack of sound. The world seemed to move in slow motion as she, Lauren, the girl with whom I had become all but obsessed, looked up at me. Some part of my mind was vaguely aware that the stillness was an illusion, that the nightmare was continuing beyond the reach of my senses... but I could hear nothing, *see* nothing, beyond the anger in Lauren's eyes.

“I think you should go,” she said.

Hello, my darling whale watchers! I have a very, very small update (edit **WARNING**: this is not a small update, I worded the shit out of this bitch) about our deliciously gorging glutton. First, we'll do an update sans greentext for her current diet tips and exercise routine that I tried to suggest to her.

She has been going on walks *everyday*. Her mother was in once last week and told me how *proud* she was that RW is finally taking control of her life. RW has apparently been (attempting) to prepare healthy meals and not drowning everything in fat, dressing, etc. She's been drinking a *lot* more water, but still is falling back on soda and sweet tea. She's still eating waaaaaaaaaaaay too much candy and snacks.

So she's trying! Way to go RW!

Until this past week at work, however.

We recently had an inspection of the store by those fancy higher up dudes in suits who like to judge you on your entire existence within the universe by the fact that they are above you (and thus, you are dirt and should be spoken to as such). We will call all of them collectively Fancy Pants, because they are one entity.

&gt; Prepping like a motherfucker for Fancy Pants arrival

&gt; Everything clean, everything working, everything up to standards

&gt; Running around like a crazy bitch in a store that's way too fucking hot (srsly like 80 degrees inside, no one wants to shop in that shit)

&gt; Take a drink of sweet, sweet ice water

&gt; FANCY PANTS HAS ARRIVED, SOUND THE ALARMS (aka call manager to warn her)

&gt; Fancy Pants stops and glares, ""What do you think you're doing?""

&gt; Me ""Taking a drink of water? It's quite warm in here.""

&gt; Fancy Pants, ""That's *extremely* unprofessional to have a beverage at the customer service desk.""

&gt; Me ""It's water, it's in a spill proof cup"" *tip that shit upside down to demonstrate point* ""and it's ridiculously hot in here when you run around as much as I do.""

&gt; Fancy Pants ""We'll be discussing this with your manager.""

&gt; GO FOR IT BROS, I AIN'T GIVIN' NO FUCKS. What are you gonna do? Fucking fire me? Go ahead. (All that is me talking shit in my head, because I'm not stupid enough to say it outloud.)

&gt; RW shows up for her shift! Has become increasingly more tolerable toward me of late because of past helps rendered

&gt; RW ""I walked five miles this morning! I made myself a smoothie for breakfast and I haven't snacked at all today! I feel really good about myself.""

&gt; Me (srsly happy) ""That's so awesome, RW. It's great how much effort you're putting in! I know it's not easy on you.""

&gt; RW ""It's *really* hard. But you know, I haven't had pizza or pasta for like... three days!""

&gt; Oh sweet jesus, woman. Three days should never be a record. Maybe it's a start, I don't know, but goddamn.

&gt; Re-enter Fancy Pants with managers in tow!

&gt; Fancy Pants points at me ""This *girl* was backtalking us when we came in. She's *extremely* unprofessional and a detriment to the customer service position.""

&gt; LOL WHAT, bitches be trippin'.

&gt; Managers defend me, talking about how customers love me, how great I am with other employees, etc etc

&gt; Fancy Pants is not convinced.

&gt; RW stands up for me, ""Viza's a great person! She's always helping everyone!""

&gt; Dem eye waters...

&gt; Fancy Pants ""She was drinking water behind the customer service desk. Unprofessional.""

&gt; RW ""Haha, what? We have drinks up here all the time. I bring sweet tea in almost every day from McDonalds.""

&gt; OH MY GOD WOMAN, SHUT UP. Find something to eat!

&gt; Fancy pants glares, ""What do you mean, every day?""

&gt; RW ""Well, I have low blood sugar and it's really hot in here, and from being a more voluptuous woman, I don't want to put myself in a position to pass out. So the sugar and tea keep me energized, which is better for the customers!""

&gt; ohmygodohmygodohmygod what are you doing stop it please

&gt; Fancy Pants, ""Do you have a medical note for your low blood sugar?""

&gt; RW goes pale and looks a little stunned, ""Well, I... my doctor said... I never needed proof before because this was never an issue! I'm just keeping myself hydrated!""

&gt; Fancy Pants ""From now on, you may only drink water while at work, unless you are on lunch. You are no longer allowed to keep personal beverages at or behind the desk. You are only allowed to get drinks on your breaks which must be taken away from the front of the store. Also, no eating at or around the desk.""

&gt; LOUD WHALE SONG OF DISTRESS ECHOES THROUGH THE AGES

&gt; RW ""You can't dooooooooo that! I have a medical condition! If I pass out I can sue you! I neeeeeeeeeed to keep my blood sugar up! You don't understand what it's like to be a woman!""

&gt; Me ""I think it's a little unfair that we can't at least keep water up here, especially if it's in a container that won't spill. We have to talk for nearly 9 hours at a time on some shifts. It's just unreasonable to th...""

&gt; RW ""OH SHUT UP, VIZA. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU EAT NOW AS IT IS. YOU'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A NORMAL WOMAN, YOU ANOREXIC SHELL.""

&gt; Literally threw my hands up in the air and shook my head

&gt; Fancy Pants and managers walk away from the desk, still discussing how unprofessional *I am* (because RW might actually bring in a medical note)

&gt; Day ends, only water in spill proof containers at customer service

&gt; No food. No sodas. No advertising beverages.

&gt; RW glares at me as I'm leaving to go home

&gt; RW ""This is *all* **your** *fault*. I can't believe you'd *stab* me in the *back* like this! And I *trusted you!*

&gt; Me ""Yeah, and I thought that you were changing your life for the better. I guess that little outburst today proved otherwise. I still hope you keep trying, even if you're angry with me for whatever reason.""

&gt; EXIT STAGE RIGHT

Okay, that was not a short update.

TL;DR - Big wigs yell at me and RW for being unprofessional because I took a drink of water. RW explodes like a twat, I don't understand because I'm not a fat fuck, accuses me of being a traitor. Wish her well, GTFO.

&gt; be me

&gt; running my second 5K race

&gt; somewhere around 9000 people signed up for this

&gt; start line so crowded they had to send us in at least 13 different waves of people

&gt; proudly finish race and get a new personal best time

&gt; go to get my snack and water bottle

&gt; snacks are for runner only as there were more people than expected

&gt; ""ISH DISH WHERE TAH SNACKS ARE?""

&gt; Snack Thief is at least 5'5 and 350 lbs and practically dripping grease 

&gt; moving her way through the crowd of runners awaiting their drink and snack

&gt; we'll call her ST

&gt; ""EXHUSE MEH""

&gt; ST clearly didn't run 

&gt; watch as ST completely disregards the bottles of water and the healthy snacks

&gt; grabs handfuls of the mini bags of Cheez-Its

&gt; several people also suspect she didn't run in the race, but only grumble and don't say anything

&gt; Worker there helping hand out the water and snacks stops her

&gt; ""I'm sorry, but the snacks are for those who ran in the race.""

&gt; ""BUT AHM SOO HUNGRAY"" THERES 'NUFF FOOD FOR MEH TOOO!""

&gt; ""Ma'am, I'm sorry but the snacks were meant for the runners onl-""

&gt; worker gets cut of by ST's anger

Take one guess at what she says next. 
You guessed it

&gt; ""I NEED MOAR FOOD BECAUZ I HAVE A CONDISHUN AND I RUN OUT OF ENERGY FAST""

&gt; worker trying to be nice, but still persists that the snacks are for the runners

&gt; ""I might have made a compromise if it were just a bag, but that's too many and we need them for our runners""

&gt; by now she's alerted everyone around of what's going on

&gt; ST is flipping shit over not being able to grab as many bags as she wants

&gt; ST screeches something about him not being fair

&gt; ST grabs another handful and takes off

&gt; by now the worker is trying to chase after her

&gt; ST literally tears through the bag with her mouth and starts devouring the Cheez-Its

&gt; makes her way out of the crowd of people only to be tripped by someone

&gt; watch as 350 lbs hits the concrete in one fast motion

&gt; hear the splat sound

&gt; see her rolls sway back and forth

&gt; ST grabs the opened bag of food and stuffs herself with the remaining Cheez-Its while trying to hide embarassment

&gt; she leaves without a word on the verge of tears


TL;DR Hamplanet steals handfuls of snacks meant for the people who ran in the race, gets tripped and lands hard on the concrete, leaves while stuffing her face with what Cheez-Its she could salvage.

1370987547.0	1g5hus	Land whale spotted my BBQ. A day with a deep life lesson for me.	mita2013	447	80	63	"This is throwaway account, my first post in this /r/ and I will also apologize ahead over my poor english. There are stories that need to get out of my chest.

Im in my middle 20, happily married, no kids and I grew up in Latin America when back then the % of fat people in the population was way lower, only in the USA I have truly witnessed land whales and fatlogic. My life is good, everything is in order and I'm ruler of my modest home which husband and I both agreed to make a quiet and calm oasis with little luxuries we can afford. lifeisgoodandiloveit.jpg


Once upon a time husband and I had our first BBQ on a warm spring day, perfect weather for outdoor day! Amazing guests with so much laughter, a truly wonderful time ... then the door bell rang and I see guests moving around my coffee table and chairs, instantly I knew what was about to happen. Enter in-law whale relative who was just around the neighborhood. 

First, other people needed to assist her moving things around because this special snowflake could trip unable to see where the hell she puts her feet. Those 30 feet were a challenge already; lack air and sweat were witnessed. My Craigslist second hand chairs were in fear as well.

Second, complain about the heat and request for air conditioner were made which forced me to inform her we don't have air conditioner. Her face when I said this was as if I just told her there was a angry black widow on her face.

Third, she was already getting hysterical over the heat and start commanding more people to bring her a glass full of ice and the cold coke. At this time I walked away into the backyard to have fun. Whale wouldn't even dare to come outside and I honestly didn't care neither.

Forth, I see MORE people coming in and out with plates grabbing a piece and coming back in. Then someone told me SHE WAS HAVING PEOPLE COMMANDED TO BRING HER A BUFFET TO HER. One piece of each: a chicken breast, brats, cheeseburger, hot dog with chili, 3-4 ribs, potato salad, home made beans, cheese tray, cheesy casserole and 2 bread rolls at least ...  no green salad. This bitch drank a full 2L coke and eat enough to feed 2 grown man until full! We are on a budget here man, I invited people over to have a good time NOT to open an all you can eat buffet!

Fifth, since the party is outside and that would be a no-no to her she commanded to someone to bring her the remote control, BLASTED the volume from across the room so she could hear it still sitting at the table .. eating ...

That's when I decided to do something, gladly my husband did instead and told her about our calm and quiet motto ... This whale snapped! Oh this poor whale, all alone and bored in the house without air conditioner what a hard life for her. We were all so rude and unconsidered to her condition. Husband told her to stop the drama. Whale was about to cry and left a few minutes after.

*That day i decided what kind of attitude I DONT WANT TO EVER HAVE IN LIFE and then had more fun with real friends.*
 
**tl;dr  whale drops by to starting couple first BBQ turning it into her private buffet, commanding people to serve her and complaining about 72F heat. Decided to never turn like her in my life**

A little back story, this story takes place several years ago, back when I was a sophomore in highschool.  A new girl moved to the area and was having a hard time fitting in because of her size (she was 5'3 370 pounds I know this because she told me) so I decided to invite her to spend the weekend with me and some of my friends.
&gt;Be me (5'9 132 pounds/size 6), my friend Kay (very tiny size XS/00), and Sara (new girl/hamplanet)

&gt;School dance is approaching so we go to the mall to look for dresses

&gt;Only one store in the whole mall sells anything smaller than 0 so we go there first

&gt;Sara asks counter girl if they sell plus sizes

&gt;Gets all huffy when they say no

&gt;Tell her there are a few plus size shops here we can go to next

&gt;Kay looks through all the racks. Only 3 size 00 dresses in the whole store

&gt;Gets frustrated because they are all too short or too loose

&gt;Decides to just get one online

&gt;Sara mentions maybe Kay should get ""some meat on her bones"" makes the whole only dog like bones analogy

&gt;Kay stifles laugh and says ""I'll think about it Sara"" (Kay got hit on just about constantly)

&gt;We go to the first plus size shop the stickers on the door read ""We carry sizes 2-24""

&gt;Sara says she wears 26

&gt;We go the next shop that sells up to a size 28

&gt;She grabs some size 26 dresses and goes to the dressing room

&gt;Several minutes pass and suddenly her head pops up from the door

&gt;THERE DRESSES ARE MARKED WRONG!!!!!!! THEY DON'T FIT ME!!!!

&gt;Ask her if she wants me to grab her some of the 28's

&gt;Throws hands up in the air and says ""Well since this places lies about there sizes I guess you'll have to"" (my sister is heavy and had bought clothes there before and said they actually ran big)

&gt;Me and Kay pick 5 or 6 dresses off the rack and pass them over the door to her

&gt;Several more minutes pass until finally she cracks the door and sticks her head out

&gt;""Hey can one of you zip me up?""

&gt;I walk up to her and she turns around

&gt;Oh my god. Nothing, nothing in the world could prepare me for that. THE ROLLS. MY GOD THE ROLLS.

&gt;I grab on the zipper and try not the touch the waterfalls of back fat

&gt;Yank

&gt;Nothing

&gt;Yank harder

&gt;Hurts my hand I'm pulling so hard

&gt;Nope. This dress is at full capacity and it's not even zipped yet.

&gt;Try to tell her but she doesn't want to hear it

&gt;Slams the door and changes back into her clothes

&gt;When she leave she immediately heads to the register and demands to talk to the manager

&gt;Managers not in

&gt;She starts unloading her rage on cashier

&gt;Poor girl

&gt;Screaming about how the store is horrible for not carrying ""all the plus sizes"" and everyone who works there are fat hating assholes

&gt;Walks back to us with a huge smile on her face. Proud that she has showed everyone how wrong they are

I want to leave. I want to tell her to go home. I want to punch her in the face. I want to scream that Kay didn't act like that when the store didn't carry dresses that fit her, but I don't. I move on like it never happened. I make the stupid mistake of letting this girl stay the night at my house, and oh what a mistake it was.

&gt;Be me, tiny asian girl, 5'2 95lbs

&gt;Friends with Yuki, also tiny asian girl, 5'0 120lbs

&gt;Yuki's an international student from Japan

&gt;Very thick Japanese accent

&gt;Yuki wants to go to Disneyland over break

&gt;Does throwing_pies want to go with?

&gt;Do the ursae shit in the woods?

&gt;Don't answer that

&gt;In any case, throwing_pies very much wants to go to Disneyland

&gt;Off we fly

&gt;arrive, people are pretty nice

&gt;more fatties than usual, but guess that's expected anywhere there are lots of tourists

&gt;first day there, having a lot of fun

&gt;Yuki especially since she's never been there before

&gt;trying to go on all the rides 

&gt;pretty successful

&gt;as the sun's going down, get a really, really good spot for the nightly firework show, sit and wait for it to start

&gt;weather's nice

&gt;good breeze

&gt;eating chocolate popcorn

&gt;been a good day

&gt;glad Yuki's enjoying her time in America

&gt;drawing together in a sketchbook Yuki carries everywhere (she's an art student) and talking

&gt;normal voices, not very loud but not whispering either

&gt;popcorn suddenly starts jumping in bag

&gt;wat.jpg

&gt;ground rumbles

&gt;feeling tremors

&gt;is it the next great California earthquake?

&gt;look around

&gt;no one else seems panicked

&gt;look straight ahead

&gt;Ursula's gotten loose, barreling its way towards us

&gt;Wait no

&gt;Not Ursula

&gt;It's the entire Medusa Nebula



Now, I'm going to break greentext because my greentext skills aren't strong enough to describe the *thing* that came 
running at me and Yuki. It was pasty, white, and huge, maybe 5'10 and 400lbs. It was wearing black with neon pink and green bracelets. It had braces with neon pink and green bands; I know this because it had the most shit-eating grin running at us. On its legs, it had skinned the cheshire cat or some shit because it had these godawful neon purple furry legwarmers. On its eyes, it had black *squares* of eyeliner. Like a demented panda. Its hair? Pigtails with neon ribbons and neon fishnets or something. *It had pigtails made of tubes of bouncing, neon fishnet.* It looked alive. I don't fucking even. To this day, that hair haunts me.

&gt;Getting closer

&gt;it's seriously aiming for us

&gt;Yuki is frozen, sitting and staring in silent awe

&gt;Can barely look away myself

&gt;start seriously wondering if I'm going to have to tackle Yuki and I out of the way

&gt;Luckily, Medusa brakes before hitting us

&gt;""KOHNEECHIWAR"" it blurbles

&gt;wut 

&gt;""I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING. YOU HAVE ACCENTS. YOU ARE FROM JAPAN?""

&gt;Yuki's still frozen in terror

&gt;""I'M MEDUSA! I JUST LOVE JAPAN.""

&gt;I'm still frozen in terror

&gt;""I LOVE ANIME GUYS, THEY'RE SOOO HOT. DO YOU GUYS LIKE ANIME? EVERYONE FROM JAPAN DOES.""

&gt;Holy fuck I've heard about beasts like this online I didn't think I'd meet one

&gt;[*weaboos*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=weeaboo)

&gt;attempt to save the day with my lack of accent and not-Japaneseness

&gt;""We're not from Japan!""

&gt;It's true, we didn't fly here straight from Japan.

&gt;Medusa smiles a strange, doughy smile

&gt;""BUT YOUR FRIEND IS, ISN'T SHE? I HEARD HER ACCENT. BUT IT'S OKAY IF YOU AREN'T. I STILL THINK YOU'RE CUTE, TEEHEE.""

&gt;grins a disgusting doughy smile

&gt;winks

&gt;wat.jpg

&gt;Medusa plops down next to us, takes out a package of popcorn bigger than the one Yuki and I are sharing

&gt;stuffs her face while talking to us

&gt;""YOU ASIANS *stuff gobble* ARE JUST SO CUTE AND SMALL, TEEHEE""

&gt;""US WHITE PEOPLE CAN'T BE TINY LIKE YOU. BUT LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE SO ADORABLE!""

&gt;Medusa's mostly talking to me at this point, as Yuki's sitting on my other side and has suddenly become very, very 
interested in her sketchbook

&gt;You're killing me, Yuki

&gt;""I'm... I'm sure with the right diet you can lose weight?""

&gt;""NOPE, NOT ME! I'M JUST NOT GENETICALLY LUCKY LIKE YOU. I WISH I WAS A CUTE ASIAN! BUT I'M WHITE, SO I'M 
FAT.""

&gt;mfw one of my best friends is white and skinnier than I am, and fit as fuck

&gt;""I have white friends who are much more athletic than me! They do a lot of running and eat a lot of vegetables. It isn't 
impossible!""

&gt;""WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S JUST DEPRIVING HERSELF. I WANT TO HAVE A FUN LIFE, JUST LIVE HOW I WANT! LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO CARE ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK.""

&gt;Medusa at this point has decimated half her bag of popcorn

&gt;These are fucking huge bags of popcorn

&gt;It takes me three days to a week to finish one

&gt;Still clutching the bag of popcorn Yuki and I were sharing

&gt;""SEE, YOU GUYS HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED THAT, RIGHT? TEEHEE IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD THOUGH, LET ME TRY SOME""

&gt;she suddenly stuffs her hand in, takes a big handful, shoves that into her mouth too

&gt;NOPE.EXE

&gt;""What do you think you're doing? That's mine. That's not okay.""

&gt;It covers its mouth and giggles, I think it's trying to look cute?

&gt;""BUT IT JUST LOOKED REALLY GOOD! BESIDES, YOU CAN'T EAT IT IF YOU WANT TO STAY SKINNY, RIGHT?""

&gt;and then shit gets real

&gt;the thing reaches out with speed I didn't think it could have and grabs my arm

&gt;I'm wearing a long-sleeved dress with a slit that goes up the sleeves, so there's a thin line of skin showing 
along my entire arm

&gt;*she fucking starts running a finger along that line*

&gt;back and forth

&gt;slowly

&gt;I'm too revolted and shocked to react for a few seconds

&gt;it feels like seeping oil, dough, and the damned hopes of a thousand men

&gt;""SEE, YOUR ARM IS SO SMALL AND YOUR SKIN IS SO PALE AND SOFT, TEEHEE... IT'S SO CUTE...""

&gt;she sounds like she's in a trance

&gt;*what the everloving fuck is happening*

&gt;mfw I snap out of it and realize I'm being molested by a hamplanet

&gt;snatch my arm back, crashing into Yuki a bit

&gt;*""DON'T TOUCH ME""*

&gt;it giggles

&gt;""AWW, YOUR REACTION IS SO CUTE!! IT'S OKAY, I'LL BE GENTLE I PROMISE""

&gt;it smiles its piggy little eyes and rotting little teeth at me

&gt;her gaze would've turned me to stone but the rage was too strong

&gt;""*NO.* It is *not* okay to touch strangers like that. It's not funny. Do not touch me again."" 

&gt;Yuki's finally been paying attention since I bumped into her escaping Medusa

&gt;""Hey throwing_pies, don't we have somewhere to be?""

&gt;""Oh... oh right, I forgot! We do! We have to go, bye!""

&gt;""WHAT?? BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WATCH THE FIREWORKS... THEY'RE GOING TO START SOON.""

&gt;""Well, we've gotta get running!""

&gt;turn around to leave when

&gt;feel a gravitational pull backwards

&gt;it's not hyperbole for once, guys

&gt;Medusa fucking has picked me up and is hugging me

&gt;lifted off the ground 

&gt;sinking into the dough

&gt;being crushed by her girth, can't breathe

&gt;I struggle and try to shove her off but cannot fight the folds of fat

&gt;about to scream when she lets go

&gt;scream anyway

&gt;WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!?!?!?!??! DID I NOT JUST TELL YOU NOT TO TOUCH ME

&gt;""TEEHEE, YOU'LL GET USED TO IT! EVERYONE FIGHTS IT AT FIRST, BUT I JUST LOVE HUGGING SMALL CUTE THINGS!""

&gt;a moment of silence for all the other she's stockholmed into her embrace

&gt;Yuki and I just turn and run

&gt;Back at hotel, we lament together that we couldn't see the fireworks that day, aim for the next day.

&gt;I see that my dress has grease stains on it

&gt;Godammit, it was one of my favorite dresses too.


We saw her briefly the next day, but I think the story's long enough so I'll end it here. In hindsight, I wonder if we could've gotten her ejected from the park."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Holy fuck, you go girl

&gt;They finally decide to fuck off, and grab even more franks.

&gt;I thank the employee, she tells me they come often and they cause drama a lot of the time. So she's used to 
them doing this all the time

&gt;No surprise there

1372751301.0	1hhgtz	"My Triumphant Return ""rage follows"""	Combustablesquirrel	449	82	110	"So I've gone back to a shrink for the first time in a long time. I know how Reddit loves proof, [So, here ya go](http://i.imgur.com/PuatfbV.jpg)

Prazosin is kind of standard to start out with for PTSD. I was told to stay off the internet for a while, but my shrink is insane herself as the story will show. If my new shrink tells me to fuck off the internet, I'll listen. 

So I've been seeing a shrink. I didn't like her to begin with, but I assumed that was my prejudice against shrinks. I've had some positive encounters with fat people, and let me tell you, if real women have curves, this woman had Pi. I figured I wouldn't judge a book by it cover.  

I've seen her twice. Today was the second time. Let the story commence.

Be me. I'm on a new VA program that lets me get my masters degree for free for being a cripple. Whose dick do I have to suck? Well part of that involves me seeing a shrink. 

Fuck me. I suck it up. I saw a shrink in the army and it wasn't too bad. I figured if I have to see a shrink, I wanted to focus on four areas. I wanted to work on my nightmares, my intrusive thoughts, both stemming from the war, and I wanted to advance my social life. I used to be a very sociable person. I'd like to be that way again. And I'd like to maintain a healthy weight. 

I looked at this as a mental health tune up. So I went to the VA. If you work at the VA, and are awesome, this story is not for you(Mind you, I've met some awesome VA workers on occasion, but it's not the norm). I'm about to trash the VA workers I saw. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs is 99.99% FPS material. 

So I show up. I check in and go to the waiting area. There are a few old timers there and I'm swapping war stories with them. Then there's a kid without his fucking legs in a scooter. He was trying to open the restroom door. His scooter couldn't push the door open. I hobbled over, and tried to give the stink eye to the tubby VA workers but was ignored, and opened the door for him coming and going.  

I was kind of an asshole to the cool gay nurse who admitted me. He was nice, but I was pissed. He said ""Ok we're just gonna do vitals and.. "" me:"" Yeah, Pulse ox on the right hand, BP on the left arm where the arterial markers are. I can do this all myself. Why isn't there somebody in the hall making sure that handicap people can piss with dignity?"". Admittedly, he was pissed. It was ten o'clock and one fatty had abandoned her post to have a ""small snack"". 

Cool gay nurse was awesome. He said ""Bitch, your job is here in the waiting room. If you want a job at the snack bar, you need to quit here and go work there. Uh uh, I don't want to hear about your diet. Shut your mouth and do your fucking job"". 

I actually think I might have turned gay for a bit there. That nurse was a king among kings. 

Now I had to deal with my tubby shrink. 

Boss battle, GO!

I really didn't like this shrink because she eats in front of me and I feel that that's unprofessional. I'm not talking snacks. I'm talking she'll have a full bag of BK stackers. Picture her just eating in this conversation.

The first thing she said to me was that my weight was 175lbs. I said ""That's actually good. I've been trying to get to my Basic Training weight for a little over a year. That's tough with a bum leg"".  My shrink. The person who is supposed to lead me into mental health, said ""I think you are developing male anorexia"".  Um... no. Let me tell you about me. I've always been a runner. I'd run 12 miles every other day because I enjoyed running. I can't run anymore because of my gimp leg and my weight increased.  

I kind of consider it an achievement to be healthy without being able to run. 

I said ""Ok, I'm not here about nutrition. I'm a former medic and you have the file as to how I've been trained. Refer me to any nutritionist and they'll tell you I'm doing damn well"". 

And here comes the overture(Can't find a good V for Vendetta gif for the 1812 overture, just imagine it). 

Her: Before we really begin, I want to talk to you about your file. There are a lot of things that are blacked out or that simply say ""Omitted"". I need to know about those. 

I said ""I went through this in the army. That is stuff that is mission specific that you don't need to know and has no bearing on my mental health."" 

""Well as your Psychiatrist, I **have** to know what happened"". 

Yay! I actually have the power for once! ""No Ma'am, the Department of Defense has reviewed this case and decided that you don't have the need to know. I promise you it's nothing interesting. We once stole a turkey from an Iraqi General and other such nonsense."" 

""But frankly, you don't need to know anything more than I'm comfortable telling you or that the DoD is ok putting in my file."" 

""So anyway, about my PTSD..."" She interrupted me and said that I was non-compliant and that she was done with me.

I ended up smoking with cool gay nurse and I started to ask, ""Was that shrink always such a fat...""

""Cunt is the word you're looking for and yes. She's a cunt to the staff, she's a cunt to the patients. She's just a cunt.""

&gt;I continue to ring her up, not phased, sometimes customers don't want to chit-chat.

&gt;As I begin to total the purchase, the Wooly Hammoth speaks:

&gt;""Ahm gunno need one o dem bags of manerrrr.""

&gt;Umm...What?

&gt;""What was that, ma'm?""

&gt;""BAG ER MANERRR!""

&gt;Shit.

&gt;Literal shit.

The hammoth is asking for me to ring her up a bag of manure, used for fertilizer in a garden. This doesn't usually happen, as I am not in the garden department, and normally people would go out there to purchase fertilizer, as it's completely on the other end of the store.

&gt;""alright m'am, I'll ring that up for you and I've called for loading assistance, so someone can grab that for you in just a second.""

&gt;""Ah ent got all day!! You get it ferr me!""

&gt;""I'm sorry m'am, I'm not allowed to leave my register, as we're pretty busy right now. I've called one of our loaders, and he'll get that for you much faster than I could""

The hammoth refuses, and begins to raise voice. I was almost finished with my shift, and too exhausted to argue too much. After five minutes of nicely telling her that someone was on their way, and that I wasn't technically allowed to load heavy things, as it wasn't in my job description, I went and got her the enormous bag of manure she wanted. 

&gt;Hammoth remains silent, looks as if my being slow at hauling bag of shit that weighs only 30 pounds less than myself is paramount to her being informed that Oprah is no longer on the air.

Several rude comments later, I return to hammoth, after I have placed giant manure sack in her car

&gt;Something is amiss.

&gt;could it be...?

Though the Wooly Hammoth was supposedly immobile, she had somehow managed to get up and load her cart while I was gone. The cart that had at one point contained only a couple sheets of plywood now had it's entire bottom covered in the entire stock of candy from a nearby shelf.

&gt;There were at least 30 candy bars now in the cart.

&gt;She had somehow managed to cover it all with lumber while I was gone.

&gt;""Oh, I see you've added a few things to your cart, did you want me to add those on to this transaction or will they be rung up seperately?""

&gt;The Wooly Hammoth stampedes.

&gt;""YOU ALREADY RUNG UP MERR CART, I PAID FERR ALL THIS, I ENT GOT TIME FERR THIS!""

&gt;Umm...No.

&gt;""M'am, I'm going to need to ring up those candy bars, as they were added to your cart while I was loading your other purchase""

&gt;""YOU ENT DOUBLE CHARGIN ME FOR THIS SHIT!!!""

I attempt to show the Hammoth that the candy is clearly not on her receipt, and after her attempting to scoot out of the store, my manager is called.

&gt;Wooly Hammoth is caught instantly by my manager; asked to leave and not return.

&gt;I state that I am the biggest and that it would be unfair for me to sit next to her, say my brother should

&gt;My mom agrees that my opinion is logical and tells my brother he has to sit next to the blubbersac

&gt;there's no way she can put her tray table down

One should not judge a person by the ham on the outside but instead by who they are on the inside (like the bone part that you can make stew with or whatever).

Science Hamplanet (SH from here on out) is a girl at my college who's probably about 300 lbs (136 kg) and probably about 5'7"" (170 cm). Usually she doesn't fall into fatlogic and doesn't complain about any conditions or that, though she doesn't try to better herself either. Her moniker comes from from the fact that she's studying Chemistry for her major.

If you follow /r/technology you're likely aware that a new in-depth analysis/study on the Hyperloop and it's feasibility was released today (Link at the bottom). In it the dimensions of a Hyperloop pod are described. Greentext enable.

&gt;Be me, sitting in lounge reading book on laptop, 6'0"" 145 lbs (187 cm 68 kg)

&gt;Earthquakes, yada, yada, 

&gt;A Wild SH appears!

&gt;""Pendragon have you seen the new informtion on the Hyperloop?""

&gt;Pull up internet, find article

&gt;""Ok, here it says that the pods are 4.43 feet wide are the widest point, accounting for a center bar like they show, yeah that gives you about two feet, which is still better than airline seats which IIRC are only 18 inches""

1363850732.0	1apyy7	Teacher hates me for losing weight. I still can't believe this happened.	DancingBabyNinjas	428	60	83	"Some background for you. A few years ago, I was a young hampup, weighing in at a magnificent 150cm and about 80 kg (that's like, 5'3 and 180lbs?). Not gonna lie, I lost all the weight initially by starving myself, and kept it off by sticking to keto. Now I pretty much eat what I want but in moderation and I go running most days. I'm 169cm and 63kgs now, (5'7 and~ 130lbs).



&gt;Last week

&gt;'PE teacher' is a failed english teacher, used to bribe kids with chocolate she kept in her desk, they lumped her with the last job they could

&gt;She's about 6'0, 300lbs easy 

&gt;Let's call her Leviathan 

&gt;Leviathan doesn't like teaching, so she takes us into the school gym most lessons, most of the girls sit around on the bikes while I make an effort to push myself on the treadmills if it means I can skip my run later and use the time to study.

&gt;Leviathan sees me running for a while, I feel dizzy from no lunch so I sit down for a break

&gt;She slithers over, looking angry

&gt;""Ninjas, what are you doing to yourself? I remember last year you looked so healthy, is it stress from the exams or what?""

&gt;I look at her confused. ""Miss, what do you mean? I'm at the healthiest I've ever been.""

&gt;""Don't lie to me, I know you've been starving yourself""

&gt;That was two years ago, but okay. Normal teacher concern, thanks. ""No actually, I just eat less and go running nowadays""

&gt;""You look unhappy and emaciated. I'm not letting you go on the treadmills any more. Go sit on one of the weight machines.""

I feel like I should clarify. I'm size S in shirts but thanks to my mediterranean roots I have a size M pair of hips/thighs. My top &amp; bottom half look like two different people so I run &amp; keep my diet in check to try and get myself into proportion. I'm NOT ""emaciated"", not even close.

&gt;""Actually miss, I'm really happy the way I am. I'm proud of my weight loss""

&gt;""HOW CAN YOU BE PROUD OF LOSING HALF OF WHO YOU ARE? STAY BEHIND AFTER GYM. YOU NEED LESSONS ON WHAT REAL WOMEN ARE ABOUT.""

&gt;All the other girls are looking now, 

&gt;I have chemistry controlled assessments to finish, this bitch isn't keeping me behind for two minutes

&gt;I run out of the gym to go get changed, she doesn't make the effort to chase me.

[Next day](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120324105143/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png) 

 &gt;She tracks me down to my Biology class, demands to speak to the whole class but I know who she's addressing

&gt;""I felt like I should mention something, recently certain students in this yeargroup have been undertaking extreme methods to lose weight. Girls, Big...""

&gt;She does a fucking pirouette, it takes three minutes for her to spin all the way around

&gt;""Is the new beautiful""

&gt;My biology teacher is fucking pissed that she interrupted her lesson, demands she get out

&gt;Not before handing her a detention slip to give to me

&gt;On the slip it says ""For unhealthy behaviour, for smug behaviour"" 

&gt;SMUG behaviour

&gt;**SMUG** 

&gt;BECAUSE I LOST SOME WEIGHT??

&gt;My bio teacher rips the slip up on the spot.

Bonus something that happened yesterday. Not part of the story, but it involves her.


&gt;Me and my best friend are on our phones, I'm on tumblr and he's texting someone

&gt;Leviathan slithers over telling us to put them away, ""oh you're on tumblr? i bet you're looking at thinspiration or whatever, if you want to do that stuff go outside""

&gt;I storm out and leave, my friend is now pissed off because he knows my beef with her. He has ADHD and can be both the meanest and funniest person I know

&gt;Leviathan says ""She's leaving you""

&gt;He looks her in the eye. ""Just like every man you've ever been with.""

 I have SO many more stories from people who are *angry* at me for losing weight. This is the most recent, most fucking ridiculous one that's ever happened to me so far."	t5_2vzax	True

Back to me

&gt;MFW hear this guy might have killed himself because he didn’t want to eat soup (sound familiar?).

&gt;Get 3 units (450 ml in each unit) into him. Get verbal release for procedures and prepare to intubate. Because he is so critical, he cannot be sedated for the intubation. A proctologist and her GI physicians group was doing rounds next door for another patient...imagine the luck!
&gt;All of a sudden he crashes and starts going into [VFib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation) (your heart doing dubstep). 

&gt;Apply paddles “All clear!” Zap! Heart resets like a champ!

&gt;Call blood bank and have them send up another 5 units of radiolabeled blood. The plan is to give him radiolabeled blood (shows up on MRI), put him in the MRI and see exactly where the bleeding is, then do an emergency colon resection to stop the bleeding. 

&gt;Dream team of nurses and doctors are all working on him. 

&gt;All at once he crashes again! Going into VFib. 

&gt;Apply paddles “ALL CLEAR!” Zap! 


&gt;nothing...


&gt;”ALL CLEAR!” Zap! Heart resets like a champ again! He is going to make it!

&gt;Blood pressure is still dropping 40/20-30’s. 
The physicians are all commanding this scene like General Patton
“Get me 5 more units of blood up here stat!” 
“Call my OR team. I want them scrubbed in and ready to go in 30 minutes!”
“Make sure we have 10 more units on hand just in case.”

We are singlehandedly depleting the blood bank.

&gt;“Shit! His blood pressure is still dropping. Get me more blood now!”


&gt;“Bring me the blood prepped for surgery too! I don’t care...he won’t ever live to bleed out in surgery if he bleeds out up here!” 

&gt;“Forget the MRI, we are taking out the whole thing!”


FYI there are only about 14 units of blood in the human body. If you have been keeping count you will notice that there was around 23 units of blood that were being pumped into him. Meaning that he had probably 30+ units of blood filling up his GI tract (mouth&gt;stomach&gt;small intestine&gt;large intestine&gt;anus)

&gt;Surgical team is prepped in the OR. 

&gt;Another hospital is rushing us over more blood. 

&gt;We have unlocked the wheels on his bed and are about to take him out when suddenly his blood pressure drops to almost nothing. 

&gt;All of a sudden he crashes again. 

&gt;His heart goes into VFib.

&gt;Apply paddles “ALL CLEAR!” Zap! 

&gt;nothing....

&gt;“ALL CLEAR!” Zap! 

&gt;2nd shock

&gt;nothing...

&gt;“Begin compressions”

Allow me to paint the scene a little better. 

Every alarm in the ICU possible is going off

1 500+ lbs man with a GI tract full of nearly 30 units of blood and untold amounts of shit

8-10 doctors dressed in crisp white lab coats shouting orders and yelling into walkie talkies

12 ICU nurses dressed in freshly pressed navy scrubs in various states of panic and action

6 OR nurses dressed in baby blue scrubs ready to transport

Me standing in the doorway about to remove the room partition to help get the bed out, 
dressed in my burgundy scrubs to indicate my lowlier status as a tech.

&gt;One of my favorite nurses OldNurseBro (ONB) is less than [6 months away from retirement.](http://i.imgur.com/ESILMxV.jpg)
None of us have had any time to put on much personal protective equipment other than just gloves.

&gt;After the 2nd shock, ONB places his hands on Ham Fountain’s massive chest

&gt;“Beginning compressions!”

Imagine if you will...

you have just spent the last hour inflating a king sized air mattress 

with lots of blood

and lots of shit

you poke a hole at each end of the mattress

you place the mattress into the middle of a group of people wearing white, navy, baby blue, and maroon with 

little to no PPE

and then you jump on the mattress repeatedly because the law forbids you from [stopping](http://i.imgur.com/xgrNHU8.gif)

&gt;A physician calls the time and the funeral home is called. 

&gt;Everyone is beyond shellshocked. 

&gt;Almost everyone has some form of blood, shit, or both on their clothing.

There is no smell in the world comparable to a GI bleed. The salty, rusty smell of blood mixed with the odor of half digested shit.

&gt;The attending nurse from the IMCU walks to the room, weeping.

&gt;She reaches into her purse

&gt;and pulls out a small plastic spray bottle from Bath and Body
floral body spray

&gt;and attempts to try to cover up the horrible smell of blood and shit with flowers.

&gt;Now the ICU smells like someone took a huge, bloody dump on springtime. Everyone is gagging even more now.


To this day I cannot walk by a Bath&amp;Body store without clawing my nose off and instantly being taken back to that horrible day.

1370785613.0	1fzb3r	How Kendall got her name.	throwmyfootoffyouras	455	86	58	"I work with a lady, her nickname is Kendall. She is a large woman, but generally pleasant. She does a lot of cooking at home and brings treats in to the office. I like Kendall, and am glad to have her as a workmate.

One bank holiday weekend I went to visit a local castle with my family (English Heritage For The Win). In the gift shop, I bought a bar of Kendall Mint Cake. If you have never heard of Kendall Mint Cake, here is a list of the ingredients:

* sugar
* mint flavouring (to taste)

It is not a healthy snack but it will please you deep down in a place you never knew you had. It is mostly sold in gift shops as a novelty, and I get to have it a grand total of once every two years. A bar is about 30 grams (just over an ounce) and will last me a week of nibbling.

I had some left when I get to work on Teusday, and Kendall inquires as to what it is. I explain and give her a small piece, and as it passes her lips and begins to melt on her tongue her eyes glaze over and roll back in her head, and I know that I have witnessed the dawn of something terrible. She thanks me and retreats to her cubicle.

Cut to: next week. Kendall has brought treats again! I love this part of my work week. I ask what it is this time, and she enthusiastically responds ""I enjoyed that mint cake you had the other day, so I tried making some myself!"" The words seem innocent enough, but there is a darkness behind them I cannot place. She reaches into her bag and hands to me a tupperware container. Upon opening it, I develop type II diabetes. 

Kendall did not agree with me that 30g was a lot of Kendall Mint Cake to get through. When she read the recipe and saw ""Sugar: 30g"" Kendall said ""No. This will not do.""

She made what was essentially a large birthday cake, and given us each a slice.

Four ounces of pure sugar. Each.

And that's how Kendall got her name.

&gt;Tell him I gained 30lbs

&gt;Says I need to gain more because it's not enough

&gt; [mfw] (http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/35167522.jpg)

&gt;My only response is ""I like to stay at a low body fat. Right now, I'm at about 10%""

&gt;He says ""I'm at 5%""

&gt;At this point I think he's joking

&gt;Tell him his abs will be visible at about 11%

&gt;He stands up in the crowded restaurant and lifts up his shirt

&gt;Rolls of fat start falling 

&gt;""SEE, I HAVE ABS!""

&gt;Says he knows because he used to be a trainer at the gym

&gt;My friend and I are literally embarrassed for him

He sits back down, they eat and we head to the pool.

The pool is $2 if you aren't from the city, so you need I.D and they put your address into the computer...

&gt;Mike brought his wallet but no I.D

&gt;Starts digging in his wallet

&gt;doesn't even have $2

&gt;he's 25, lives with his parents and can't even afford to swim at the community pool.

&gt;Ends up begging my friend to let him borrow his car so he can go get money

He never came back. As soon as he got home, he lost interest so I had to drive my friend back to his house in the opposite direction.



Edit: I have a ton of fat people stories, I'll probably start posting them soon.

&gt;&gt;Be me (6' 150lb/68kg) ripped as tits

&gt;&gt;Be teaching little kids how to swim

&gt;&gt;Have a running joke with my class where I Simba them and the rest of the class and I sing that song

&gt;&gt;TheCircleOfLife.mp3

&gt;&gt;Seriously no idea how that started

&gt;&gt;Most of these fuckers weigh like 60ish lbs (27 kg 4.3 Stone, 2383 Shekel, 1.5266798866e+28 gigaelectronvolt)

&gt;&gt;One kid doesn't

&gt;&gt;Probably weighs twice the other kids

&gt;&gt;Has larger [mother](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-32629-body-shape.htm?StartAt=2#.UbaSvuce1tw) similar to pic

&gt;&gt;I try to Simba everyone at least once during the 2 week lesson period

&gt;&gt;Foreshadowing

&gt;&gt;The kid isn't even a bad swimmer, he floats well, I just don't think I could physically Simba him

&gt;&gt;Skip to first day of lessons

&gt;&gt;The mother of UnSimbable doesn't like to stay in the pool area due to the bleachers being uncomfortable and ""bad for her knees""

&gt;&gt;I don't think knees work that way m'am

&gt;&gt;She yells to LifeGuard friend to grab her a chair

&gt;&gt;She's a little busy guarding lives and she can't leave the pool area

&gt;&gt;MayoMother grumbles off to find a chair

&gt;&gt;We have no chairs




&gt;&gt;Day 2

&gt;&gt;UnSimbable comes in carrying a camping chair

&gt;&gt;Not a bad idea, our bleachers are uncomfortable

&gt;&gt;She tries to set it up so her feet are in the water

&gt;&gt;Too short/ LG ain't takin' dat shit

&gt;&gt;She watches bemused as I start the day with a good ol' Simba

&gt;&gt;After the lesson she comes up to me and asks if I had ""lifted and humiliated"" her son yet

&gt;&gt;No ma'm and if you want I can avoid that for him

&gt;&gt;Perfect plan for me right? I don't have to simba him and I have an excuse not to!

&gt;&gt;No

&gt;&gt;""No, I would like to have you do it tomorrow so I can get a pic for my hubby""

&gt;&gt;My horizon has metaphorically darkened

&gt;&gt;I tell her I don't know if I can, she kind of laughs (not quite a teehee) and says I shouldn't have a problem

&gt;&gt;My time on this Earth is limited


&gt;&gt;Day 3, The Reckoning

&gt;&gt;Spend the morning mentally preparing for my ordeal, I don't actually know if I can get him out of the water, but if I just hold him there, will that count?

&gt;&gt;Never half ass anything

&gt;&gt;I will full ass this

&gt;&gt;Be waiting for my fate

&gt;&gt;A new challenger appears

&gt;&gt;UnSimbable

&gt;&gt;Class starts

&gt;&gt;It is time

&gt;&gt;Are you ready to simba UnSimbable?

&gt;&gt;yes, of course YOU are, not me

&gt;&gt;I put my hands under his armpits and lift

&gt;&gt;nothing

&gt;&gt;I can feel the frown from across the room

&gt;&gt;patience

&gt;&gt;I try squatting lower

&gt;&gt;This is possible

&gt;&gt;I can do it

&gt;&gt;I am all powerful

&gt;&gt;I am above the law

&gt;&gt;I can't sing, too much strain, No Longer Unsimbable's mother takes a picture

&gt;&gt;He goes down

&gt;&gt;I go down

&gt;&gt;He understands why

&gt;&gt;His mother does not

&gt;&gt;""Oh you forgot to sing reddeaddeaddead, c'mon""~The Mother

&gt;&gt;I have no face

&gt;&gt;I have no words

Hello, friends. I’m here to tell you the story of my most devastating (and only) encounter with a POUS. (Person of Unusual Size). It starts a little slow, but your jimmies will be doing an absolute tango by the end of this saga, I promise you.

Allow me to set the stage.

Alex (Me) - Innocent freshman, a mind filled with unblemished dreams and high hopes. After a lonely four years of high school, I’m praying college will be different.

Jacob – My roommate. A sophomore who treats me like a little brother. My self-proclaimed “guide to college”.

Emily – Total babe. I see her walking around campus sometimes. Once I followed her into a Starbucks before deciding I was being too creepy and leaving without buying anything.

Devon – Emily’s friend and my “in”. We bonded during orientation because we couldn’t find the bathroom and ended up having to break into a dorm.

Nugget – Can you tell who the antagonist of this story is? I can’t even sum her up in a few sentences. Just read and find out.

Chris – My friend. Don’t need to know much about him other then he’s a freshman as well, and in the same ENG 101 as Nugget and I.


It’s the first day of classes. Jacob drew me a map to get to my English class (thanks, buddy) and I get there a few minutes before things get rolling. I take a seat carefully placed near the edge so I can go pee, and just far enough back that I seem interested, but not nerdy. Flawless. The next person to show up is Chris. I’ve seen him around before, but haven’t been introduced. He comes and sits a few seats away from me. We make eye contact and a mutual head bob. The lecture hall fills in a little more when the lights dim. The desks rattle. Was that thunder? Indoors? A shadow looms over me.

“Is that seat taken?”

I look up to see a finger the size of a hotdog gesturing to the seat next to me. I’m not one to make hasty judgments, however, and so I mutely shake my head and pull my legs in as an invitation to take the seat. She struggles past me and settles herself down. Now, at this point she was not too huge. Chubby, maybe, but she seemed hygienic enough and perfectly nice. What was causing her all this trouble was her HUGE backpack. And purse. And laptop bag. Yes, that’s three separate bags. She splayed these bags out around her feet (and mine, totally thwarting my ability to go pee) and began rummaging through them for a notebook and stuff. This continued for a while after the professor had come in and started doing his thing, but hey, I’m chill. I can ignore it. Then the whispers started.

“When is he going to start *teaching*?” ^giggle

“I wouldn’t have come to class today if I had known we weren’t going to be doing anything *important*” ^giggle

Girl, it’s the first fucking day. He’s laying out the expectations and shit, if you don’t think that’s important then no one is stopping you from leaving. Not to mention everything she said was punctuated by that obnoxious, nervous giggle. By the end of class I had pretty much decided I didn’t want to pursue *that* friendship, and packed up as quickly as possible, catching up with Chris on my way out. We chatted about the class for a minute before she caught up with us. Coming to walk between us, she giggled.

“Who’s your friend?” ^giggle

Chris and I traded looks. I can only assume he could hear her whispers during class as well, because he seemed to quickly understand my sentiment. I mumbled his name and picked up the pace. End of day one.


Cut to a few weeks later and I’ve rounded up a pretty great friend group. Chris and I have become solid bros (he took a blow for me and sat in Nuggets seat the second day, forcing her to sit next to *him*, bless his heart) and Devon is a super chill lady friend. The three of us hang out together a lot. Sadly, Nugget hangs out with us a lot as well. She’s not too terrible, just kind of awkward in that none of us want her there and yet… there she is. Until one day I get a text from Devon.

“hey what do you think of nugget?”

“uh, is this a trick question? I wish she’d fuck off is what I think of her seriously”

“haha yeah that’s what I thought”

When I saw her later that day I asked her what the hell all that was about and she told me that Nugget had dragged her off for some “girl time” and then confided in her that she thought I was really cute and that she’d had a crush on me since she first saw me in class, then prodded her in to texting me the aforementioned question. Well shit, I mean, I’m flattered but… no. Devon said she had tried to tell Nugget that she didn’t think I was interested, but Nugget interpreted that as meaning that I hadn’t even thought of her sexually (which was totally true) and she needed to be more overt. Here’s where it predictably starts going downhill. She began touching me more, just little things like grabbing my arm or hitting my shoulder, but knowing the intention behind them made me shy away from every motion like an abused animal. She started slipping references to sex into almost every conversation, weather it was asking Devon if she was still a virgin (totally inappropriate, and good old Devon made sure she knew it) or talking about how she could hear her roommate having sex with her boyfriend. Just making all of us even more uncomfortable then she usually did. It was at this point that I first noticed Emily. A tiny little thing, 5’2” at best, she had a stunning smile and swishy blonde hair. I was smitten. The aforementioned Starbucks incident occurred and when I relayed my story of lame-ness to Devon and Chris, Devon actually perked up and told me that she kind of knew Emily – they lived on the same hall and they would sometimes eat together. She offered to help us meet. (Really, an A+ wingman all around. Just the absolute shit.) So one day I was just heading to class when I hear “Hey! Alex!” and I turn to see Devon walking with dream girl. I’ll gloss over this part because it’s not particularly a fat person story but Emily and I end up getting to be decent friends. Like to the stage where you’ve made out “for fun” a few time and laugh it off but you’re both just waiting for the other to make the next move and the sexual tension is so totally there. But I digress. Well, let me digress a little bit more. Emily was a pretty fashionable girl. A little bit of a hipster look, she tended to favor big sweaters and cute oxfords and funky jewelry. Always very fresh and polished. And soon I started noticing that Nugget, too was looking… not exactly fresh and polished, more like disheveled and confused, but nonetheless she had found some sweaters and some thick-rimmed glasses and a pair of men’s dress shoes that she wore every single day. She talked a lot about how she had decided it was time to “update her look” and would constantly ask me what I thought of her outfit that day. Now let me say that the freshman fifteen are *not* a myth, at least where Nugget was concerned. It had become more like freshman 50. I would mumble something affirmative and make my escape. Now, dear readers, you may be thinking “Oh, big deal. Unwanted attention from someone you don’t like. Cry me a river.” But oh, darlings, I’ve just been setting the stage. Because this is where the axe drops.


I begin noticing something strange with my computer, which I usually leave in my dorm. Windows are open that weren’t when I left. USB drives have been connected and disconnected. All my social networking accounts were open. Of course I suspect some fishy business and go to Jacob first.

“Hey man, I don’t want to do this to you but my computer has been being messed with while I’m away. Do you know what’s up with that?”

He, of course, swears he doesn’t, and to the honest, I believe him. He has no reason to mess with my stuff and he honestly seems to like me. So I ask him if anyone has been in our room recently. He mentions a few friends and says he’ll ask them about it. Then his brow rumples.

“And there was your partner for the English project… Nublit? Ninpit? She came by and said she just needed to grab some files that you had forgotten to email her.”

What the fuck? There was no English project, and even if there was I wouldn’t partner with Nugget. I storm out of the room and over to her dorm. She comes down to the front desk and I lay into her, asking her why the fuck she thought she could pry in my stuff, why she lied to my roommate, demanding she tell me what she did, and she has the most devastated expression on her face. Just the look of someone who knows they are irrevocably screwed. She doesn’t even try to deny it but her face crumples and she just starts sobbing, right there, in the middle of the lobby. People are giving us strange looks so I herd her outside and try to calm myself down a little. She stops wailing long enough to look up at me with I guess she thought was a “delicate, vulnerable” expression (more like “flesh blob” and “watery”) and confessed that she had felt like we were “growing apart” and she wanted to make sure that she was still my “number one girl”. (Her words, not mine.) I told her that she was certainly **not** my number one girl, nor had she ever been, and said that I had tried to be nice but she was just getting too weird. Basically wishing her good luck with her life, I took my leave and promptly relayed the entire situation to Chris and Devon. (As well as apologizing to Jacob for ever suspecting him, but also making sure he wouldn’t let random people into our room anymore.)


Such begins my long, sad tale friends. But it’s not even close to over. How many more victims does Nugget have to claim in her quest for the D? To be continued…

1368937214.0	1em5ze	Hammey and the Cookie Jar	Wolfsong013	433	70	59	"Hello all! This is my new series starting about an old roommate of mine from a while ago. I know that most of you have been waiting more more Hammila stories, but I thought I would mix it up. I will have another Hammila story for you lovely little hams probably by monday.

Backstory: I mention my dog in my other posts. I'm not sure if I made it clear, but she is a service dog. Since she is such a massive help to me, I tend to spoil her a little when she is off duty. I moved closer to university to cut down on my commute, but needed to live with a roommate (dat university cost). Luckily my school found a girl who was willing to live with a dog. She was a half-decent human being, but was riddled with fat logic. Anyway, on to the story! 

I moved into my place and things were going alright. We were both heavy girls living in a university town. We shared a small studio apartment, with a little kitchen. I let her know that if she wanted, we could pool together for some supplies, like milk, so that we didn't have two gallons in the fridge at a time. She didn't want to pool, but that was okay, we managed with our little space.

We did offer eachother certain treats and other things that we had. We never really used anything without permission, other than things like sugar, or coffee. There was a huge difference in what we had in the fridge and counter tops. She had a meal pass for uni, so most of her things were chocolate covered raisins, things for grilled cheese, pounds of jelly beans (I'm not kidding), and a stockpile of icecream. 

She would constantly make comments that she was happy to live with ""another fat girl"" which thankfully never made me want any of her treats. She would see me get back from my trainer's house, and complain about how she gains weight, but she never accepted an offer to work out with me (my trainer is awesome and will teach my friends at no extra charge). It was okay, I didn't want to push her if she wasn't interested, but as I started to lose more and more, the more she made comments about ""me being lucky that my body allows me to lose weight"". 

[MFW I would come home covered in sweat, and feeling like my limbs were concrete](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/angst.gif)

I told her that if she wanted to lose weight, we could do it together. She said that she didn't want to work out and ""get all sweaty and gross"" and instead ate handfuls of jelly beans and ate [at least one box of these a day](http://candyaddict.com/blog/candy_images/cookie_bites.jpg). I paid so close attention since she couldn't seem to eat with her damn mouth closed. 

After visiting my trainer one day, I stopped by a petstore to get my dog a treat, and to pick up a couple of supplies. This pet store is known for its [treat bar](http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XgyGX7shiMbcfajG0GUaqA/l.jpg) and its treats that looks remarkably like [human cookies.](http://smartshopbuy.com/images/AnimalSupplies/petco-treat-bar-duplex-sandwich-cremes-dog-tr.jpg)

I grabbed my dog's favorite one, that looks like [mini chocolate chip cookies](http://www.petslubrisyn.com/wp-content/uploads/dogs-supplies/PETCO-Treat-Bar-Carob-Chip-Cookies--15-lbs-.jpg) and took them home. My treat jar looks like a glass cookie jar, with tiny paw prints around the middle. I put the cookies in, and gave on to my dog. 

The next day, I arrive back from class to see that the entire jar is empty. I asked my roommate if she knew anything about it. 

""Oh! I took a couple before I went to class, since it was exam day. Since it was a rough test, I came home and had some with ice cream. I'm sorry, I'll replace them though. It's been a rough day."" 

[MFW She ate a ton of dog biscuits](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/contain-yourself.gif)

Without thinking, I immediately blurt out

""You did know that those were dog treats, right?""

She spent the rest of her night throwing up. I felt bad, I knew I should have kept it a secret from her. Needless to say, she never took anything from the treat jar ever again. "	t5_2vzax	True
1373842632.0	1iaw25	Rotundra’s Hamplanet Holiday Hoedown: Tales of a Social Worker Part V	onikakushi	471	106	54	"For those who are just joining my saucy saga, you can find Part I [here](http://redd.it/1gthdi), Part II [here](http://redd.it/1gvxza), Part III [here]( http://redd.it/1gyaj6) and Part IV [here]( http://redd.it/1hpcon).

Last time, due to Tom and I meddling and a sadistic ploy gone awry—Rotundra no longer found herself on the dating market. This of course culminated in the utter dismay of the innumerable hopeful bachelors she had left in her wake. Nevertheless Rotundra was convinced she had found her true love, the illustrious prince of sands himself, Trey.

But like all things, this intermission in the Greek tragedy that was my life would soon too come to an abrupt and unforeseen end. Unsurprisingly, the cruel hands of fate were only too happy to oblige—Trey had been hired on in our office’s mailroom.

Tom and I were both realists—neither of us believed that Trey was, in fact, Rotundra’s ‘prince charming.’ But, at the same time we were not about to look a gift horse in the mouth—especially when it came to the newfound peace at lunch. So, even after he started at the office, we didn’t worry.

However, indications that our calculations had gone terribly wrong soon became apparent in the daily discussions of sexual depravity amongst the Berthas. Our once peaceful lunch hour rapidly devolved into a war of attrition with our stomachs as we tried to keep food down.

The graphic detail of Rotundra’s sexual discourse was only intensified by the physical motions that so often accompanied it—just as a beached whale frantically flails for its freedom, so too did Rotundra as she demonstrated for her captive audience.

Her hubris didn’t stop there, she also felt the need to constantly remind *everyone* of just how great Trey was. According to her totally *unbiased* testimony—Trey was not only a heavily endowed majestic sex-god, but was also an amazing chef. Apparently, his abilities in bed were only trumped by his prowess in the realm of fudge brownies.  Tray after tray of Trey’s brownies managed to find their way to the Bertha’s table, and each time their accolades were sung like Biblical Psalms.

It seemed as though the Berthas appetite for food had been superseded by their newfound interest in their *extremely active* sex lives. But, as you, the reader, have undoubtedly come to understand—Rotundra was not happy lest she was the center of attention. Simply being the most grotesque story-teller didn’t seem to quite satiate her need to out-do the others.

Tom and I had resigned ourselves to ignoring them the best we could. But, in true Rotundra fashion, she decided to execute a Hail-Mary to ensure *everyone* knew she was ‘for real.’

As a quick note: In our building, the bathrooms were on either side of the cafeteria—in other words the three rooms each shared a wall. As such you could hear toilets flushing, and sometimes the grunts of a Bertha attempting to make room for the rest of her afternoon snack from your seat in the lunchroom.

That’s when we heard ‘it.’ 

Neither Tom nor I could ignore the audio terrorism assaulting our eardrums. It sounded as though something was attempting to shove a whale into poorly greased PVC pipe. The whip-crack of fat hitting fat over bending metal was unmistakable. I looked at the Berthas as they too listened in shock as the porpoise yelps and groaning metal echoed through the wall.

Rotundra wasn’t in the room. The weight of the situation hit me like a fat person launched off a treadmill—Rotundra and Trey were *bumping nasties* in the bathroom.

As I sat there awestruck, I could not stop listening—never before had I heard such a grotesque medley. Like watching a train wreck, I couldn’t pull away if I wanted to.

Thankfully, Tom was there to snap me back to reality—“Onikakushi, let’s get the fuck out of here—this is sick man.”

As he grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out, my eyes met with one of the Berthas; the message was clear—we *own* this lunchroom.

Back in my office and free from the terror that had befallen us only moments prior, we sat in shock. We knew we created this beast. Thus we made a vow that we would be the ones who would eventually slay it.

The light chill of November gave way to December, and with it the first snows of the year began to insulate my morning commute. The office was alive with talk of the Christmas party. Each year the office would throw a party before the holidays, marking our last day in the office prior to the first of the New Year—naturally, it was a big deal for many people in the office and excitement was running high.

For Tom and I, the approach of the Holidays meant something else—our chances for revenge this year were shrinking on a daily basis. If we were going to do something about Rotundra and Trey, it needed to be before we left on holiday. So, Tom and I began a planning initiative each afternoon in my office, so we could avoid the ever watchful eye of the Berthas and keep our lunches down easier.

During these sessions we came up with and scrapped countless ideas—none of them quite living up to the bar we had set. But as hunger is the best spice, so too is desperation the best motivator. Soon we had a plan we were confident in—pulling it off would be difficult, but we were determined to get revenge on Rotundra and her pack of orcas.

Since Tom was the head of IT, he had access to every computer and email sent within the building. A few days prior, Tom had been called to fix—you guessed it—Rotundra’s computer. According to him, Berthas were by far the most problematic users in the building; constantly crashing their computers and *mysteriously* getting virus after virus. 

While fixing her computer, Tom had taken the liberty to take a peek at her email and noticed an email going around the office regarding the treats each Bertha was bringing to the party—ostensibly to ensure that no sugary treat was forgotten or over-represented. Everyone in the office had received a notice from Vince (our building’s boss) regarding his severe peanut allergy, but it seemed only the Berthas were a part of this mailing list.

Attention to detail was Tom’s strong suit and as he looked through the list he made a mental note of what Rotundra and Trey were bringing to the event—just in case.

If we were going to make our plan work, we needed reinforcements. Tom’s wife Taylor had helped us during our last adventure, so we hoped she would help. Luckily, her sense of humor closely resembled ours, and after hearing our proposal she was on-board.

I found myself once again at Tom’s house on the eve of the Christmas party. Tom, Taylor and I sat around a table going over our plan one last time to make sure that no detail was overlooked or forgotten—we allowed no room for dessert, let alone error.

Tom and I were somewhat lacking in the realm of baking, so we left that job up to Taylor—she crafted a tray of brownies that met our specifications perfectly. We carefully packaged them in a large zip-lock bag and ensured it would fit within Taylor’s purse.

The sky was painted grey and the streets ran slick with dark slush as I made my way across town towards Tom’s again the next day. Like a boy awaiting presents on Christmas morning, I was feeling a rush of anxiety and anticipation I had not experienced in years.

Whittling away the last remaining hours regaling one another with stories of our families and holidays past we watched the flames slowly consume logs in the fireplace. As the last wood turned to ash, we knew it was time.

After reaching the office—with one last cursory check we headed inside. People were socializing  and getting ready for Vince’s annual speech. We glanced at the treats that awaited us in lunchroom and took immediate notice to the tray of fudge brownies with Trey’s name on the tag next to them. 

Having never come to any office events prior to the Halloween party a few months ago, Taylor still had a morbid curiosity regarding the Berthas and Rotundra. Since Rotundra and Trey left so soon during the previous event, Taylor felt she had been cheated out of a chance to meet the beast.
Taylor wanted to be introduced to Rotundra and her whale pack. Eventually Tom gave in to her demands and we walked over to where the Berthas had parked themselves. 

They were in their usual spot in the cafeteria—which seemed to be nothing more than a way for them to guard and inspect every treat brought in. As we approached them instead of the treats a sigh of relief was clearly audible—we were not coming for their desserts.

The Berthas we had helped with workout plans in the past were on decent terms with Tom and I and they greeted us as such. As we introduced Taylor to them they were pleasant—Rotundra however scoffed.

At this point, a quick once over of Taylor is necessary to contextualize the following conversation. In stark contrast to the Berthas, Taylor was not only not fat—she was underweight. She was an attractive blonde who stood at a meager 5’2’’. After struggling with an eating disorder for the better part of life, she found herself not-so-comfortably in size 0 jeans. As such her weight was a touchy subject.

“I didn’t realize you were into *twigs*, Tom,” Rotundra spat with disgust.

“I didn’t realize Sea World let their attractions out for Christmas, Rotundra,” Tom snapped back.

Undeterred by Tom’s remark, she proceeded to go after Taylor personally, “You really are just skin and bones aren’t you? I bet you love the taste of your own puke more than food by now, huh.”

As I glanced over to Taylor it was clear she had not prepared herself for such an assault and was physically shaking as the Berthas cackled at Rotundra’s commentary.

Tom once again took over for his wife, “Even if that were true, at least she isn’t so insecure as to feel the need to abuse strangers over the way they look just to make herself feel better.”

With that Rotundra gave a “HMPH!” and returned to conversing with the Berthas as though nothing had happened. Tom took Taylor by the arm and walked her to the bathroom so she could fix her make-up and calm down. I returned to our seats in the main hall—Vince’s speech was just about to start.

Tom soon returned and took his seat next to me. I was concerned because Taylor was not with him, but Vince had already begun.  Since this was my first time hearing this speech, I had no idea what I was in for—it was something like a cross between the aborted stepchildren of a pep-talk and a thank-you speech. And it was long. Around the 20 minute mark Taylor finally returned to her seat looking much better.

With the final word said, time and space seemed to bend as the rows of Berthas simultaneously jettisoned their seats and rocketed themselves toward the food. Luckily, nobody was foolish enough to stand in their way and feel the crushing force of these bariatric barbarians.

The three of us took a leisurely pace, and to none of our surprise—there were only a few items left. We took a few choice dessert items and returned to our usual lunchtime perch in the corner of the room. Over an hour passed as we munched and discussed holiday plans, but as more time passed it became increasingly apparent that something was wrong at the Berthas’ table. 

What started as a few urgent whispers amongst them quickly escalated to a couple of them waddling to the bathroom with what looked to be clenched cheeks.

Soon we heard a scream from the bathroom, “THE TOLIETS WON’T FLUSH OH MY GOD!”

Soon the Berthas were fighting to get in line for the bathrooms—even in the absence of flushing capabilities. Whatever was plaguing their digestive systems paid no heed to the lack of proper facilities.

Horror made its way across their faces as they realized they had nowhere to go, driving some of the Berthas to tears—others yet began the long and shameful wobble to their cars. No matter what choice they elected, one thing was clear—they wouldn’t make it to a bathroom in time.

Even Rotundra was trying to make her way out of the building, Tom and I sat in sheer awe as Trey attempted to half-carry her out of the building as fast as his stubby legs would carry them. I guess he really was “350lbs of pure power” as he had claimed after all. 

At this point we knew it was time for us to put the last icing on the proverbial revenge cake we had been baking all night. Now that every brownie from Trey’s tray appeared to be eaten, Tom slipped his hand into Taylor’s purse, and casually put a fudge brownie onto his plate. After taking a single bite he said quite loudly, “Wow, there’s peanuts in these brownies! Didn’t whoever brought these read the email about allergies?”

With the mention of peanuts, Vince immediately demanded to know who had brought the brownies. I dutifully responded that Trey had brought the only brownies—and since Trey was busy trying to save Rotundra from defecating upon herself, he wasn’t around to defend himself.

Vince growled that he would have his job for trying to kill him when he got back after holiday—and with that declaration the final phase of our plan had reached completion.

In the wake of the toilet crisis, the cafeteria was beginning to become unbearable thanks to the smell invading from next door. We bid Vince a merry Christmas, and quickly excused ourselves. On the way out, we passed the emergency janitorial crew that had been scrambled due to the backed up toilets that were now overflowing with the shreds of the Berthas’ pride and decency—along with mountains of fecal matter.

Everything was once again right with the world. Our plan had succeeded in every sense of the word—it had even had an unplanned improvement thanks to Rotundra’s unexpected derogatory comments regarding Taylor’s weight.

It turns out that Taylor hadn’t spent those 20 or so minutes fixing her make-up, but rather had spent them clogging the toilets with toilet paper and turning off the water valves under them. While Tom and I had had her bake a tray of brownies filled with stimulant laxatives and swap them with Trey’s batch—the toilets were all her (and in case you were wondering, we bought the peanut brownie at the store earlier that day) .

In the end, we successfully turned the Berthas into the laughing stock of the office by publicly humiliating them in the worst way possible—due to their own greed they had been the only ones to ingest ‘Trey’s’ brownies. That year’s party went down in office history as the Crapper Caper. The peanut brownie also started Trey’s eventual demise at the office, and created the first ripple in Rotundra and Trey’s fairytale romance.

At the end of the night, with all said and done, everything was right, true Christmas fun.

**TL;DR –A Christmas caper the likes of which the Grinch himself would have been proud of, committed in an attempt to undo problems we had created earlier, justice ensues.**

AmeliaBeerhart	474	114	139	"[Part I](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hlxnr/popalopagus_and_the_pie_debacle_part_i/), where there is a great rustling of jimmies, [Part II](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hmlj6/popalopagus_and_the_pie_debacle_part_ii_justice/), in which justice is served hot out of the pie warmer.

&gt;Be me, about 16 by this time in the story, and beginning to delvelop an eating disorder. 5'6"" and down to 115lbs.

&gt;Don't be Popalopagus, 5'7"" and about 350lbs at this time.

&gt;Also don't be WisdomSkinny, who's 14, 5'3"" and unbelievably tiny and beautiful, who just landed a modeling contract because she looks like a young Kate Moss.

&gt;Be my birthday, and I am having a party. I have invited pretty much everyone I know, including Popalopagus, because she has been very sweet lately and I think she is changing her ways.

&gt;Everyone starts arriving, all dressed up and looking awesome.

&gt;By this time EmoKid and I are dating, much to the annoyance of Popalopagus, but this evening, she is focused on a new prey.

&gt;Be Grogger, Jewish-American import to New Zealand, very skinny and quite punky. 

&gt;Be forever showing everyone your scrote through your zipper for unknown and mysterious reasons.

&gt;Be drinking secret booze while hiding from adults in the garden, until, whoops you are too drunk and you pass out.

&gt;HotBro and EmoKid considerately carry you to my room, where you languish in your drunken stupor. 

&gt;The party continues. WisdomSkinny wonders ""Where did Popalopagus go?""

popalopagusnotfound.404

&gt;We figure she is probably in the kitchen, emptying out my pantry, now that she is done with eating most of the party snack, and hoovering up booze like a crazed wet-vac.

&gt;Not in the kitchen.

&gt;Maybe she had too much and went to lie down.

ohgodmyeyes.itburns

&gt;Light from the hallway hits a moving pile of cottage cheese and bleached orange peel.

&gt;Blubblublub

&gt;See Grogger, passed out and getting internal bleeding from the enormous whalebeast riding him.

&gt;Realise I have been standing there staring at them for ages, when Popalopagus stops and turns.

&gt;""Don't cock-block me, bitch, can't you see we're having a good time?""

&gt;""Grogger is unconscious. This is sick. Not to mention, stop comitting rape in my bed,""

&gt;""Ugh, you're just jealous because EmoKid doesn't want to fuck you. Well stop being such a bitch. Someone may as well use your bed,""

&gt;I leave the room and try to unsee. 

&gt;I call my mother downstairs.

&gt;""Please stop them fucking on my bed.""

&gt;Mother is super pissed.

&gt;Has a massive go at Popalopagus for perpetrating this obscene sex act.

&gt;""What the fuck are you doing to that poor boy? He's not even awake. Get off AmeliaBeerhart's bed this instant!"" trying to sound authoritarian, like a boss.

&gt;Popalopagus mutters something that sounds like ""Saggy old lady,"" but gets off because onlookers are starting to gather around my door.

&gt;The HamMother is called to collect her rapey progeny.



________________________________________________________


Sorry, got sleepy: here is the rest of the story, though I don't think it will calm your jimmies much:

&gt;I cover Grogger up with some blankets while we all wait for Popalopagus's mother to arrive. Things are fucking tense and everyone is sickened.

&gt;HamMother arrives and asks what happened. My mother explains the whole sad mess. 

&gt;HamMother proceeds to blame the alcohol that she claims my mother provided (nope, she didn't know about it).

&gt;Loud argument is had, meanwhile we are all thinking WHAT THE FUCK?

&gt;HamMother asks Popalopagus for her version of the story. She mutters something about ""just dry humping,""

&gt;I'm like ""Because he was fucking unconscious!""

&gt;They leave. Everyone feels really weird and doesn't know what to do, so we all go to sleep on various pieces of furniture.

&gt;Next day dawns, everyone is hungover/still drunk from the night before.

&gt;I make everyone some breakfast, and take some in to Grogger, who is still sleeping in my bed, now awake.

&gt;I'm like ""Bro, are you okay?""

&gt;He's all. ""Ummm. Did I make-out with Popalopagus last night?""

&gt;I say ""Not really, it was more like rape.""

&gt;He says ""Tell me there was no actual penetration""

&gt;Me ""She says not, but she absolutely cannot be trusted,""

&gt;He nods. ""If she's given me anything there is going to be hell to pay,""

&gt;Me ""There should be anyway. She's just going to keep doing shit like this if she doesn't get taught a lesson,""

&gt;Grogger gets tested for STI's, and it comes back clean.

&gt;He opts not to get the police involved, and decides instead to enact some vigilante justice.



TL;DR

Fatty waits until her prey is too drunk to resist her advances, then rides his limp dick in my bed at my birthday party. Does not stop until I have my mother intervene.


Edit: I deeply apologise for your rustled jimmies, I got sleepy and didn't finish typing the story last night. I had no idea so many people were actually going to read it. I hope the ending clears me of being a heartless bitch, Grogger was told about it, and after that it was up to him whether he wanted to press charges or not. Being an anarchist punk, he chose not, but he did devise some epic vengeance.

&gt; Be me, 17, doing a competition play in Michigan in winter.

&gt; Drive with bff, Blondie, to school where the competition is. Takes two hours.

&gt; Acquaintance of Blondie and I  [""Beretta""](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-21981-body-shape.htm?StartAt=11#.Ub57QBySmSg) meets up with us at the school and begs us to take her home rather than ride with the group she came with. She said she was too cramped in their car.

Have to add that she actually was named after a gun. This is the kind of town I grew up in.

&gt; Whatever, hop in, Beretta. There's a snow storm coming in.

&gt; About to get on the expressway when...

&gt; ""Can we make a quick stop at Wendy's? 

&gt; It's snowing, Beretta. We want to get home. Wendy's is ten minutes away from here. We can stop at a Wendy's when we get closer to home.

&gt; ""Please, I'm just starved!""

&gt; All right, I guess we're a bit hungry as well.

&gt; ""We gotta go inside, I gotta tinkle. Tee-hee.""

&gt; Thanks for the memo.

&gt; Beretta waddles inside, gets in line. No bathroom break necessary, I guess. 

&gt; All of us sit down with our food. I got a bowl of Chili, and Blondie got a chicken sandwich.

&gt; Why is there grease all over your tray, Beretta? 

&gt; ""I got the Baconator meal with a frosty. Have you ever had one? It's delicious. I didn't know they would put the Frosty instead of a pop with the meal but they will. So. Good.""

&gt; It was glistening in the fluorescent lights. 

&gt; I swear I saw my reflection in the grease on the bun.

&gt; I'll stick with chili thanks. Just gotta watch out for them [thumbs](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/food/chilifinger.asp) floating around.

&gt; Blondie and I finish eating, Beretta hasn't said a word besides the occasional grunt as she reaches to stick her burger or fries into her frosty.

&gt; Blondie tries to reason with her, as the snow is coming down heavier now and we'd been there for almost a half an hour. 

&gt; ""Blondie, if I hurry when I eat I'll throw it all up. I can't help it you and Homehealthgirl ate everything so fast you couldn't taste it.""

&gt; Blondie starts to respond but her phone rings. It's her dad.

&gt; ""Get your asses home now, there's already two inches of snow here.""

&gt; Holy shit, we're leaving, we're leaving.... No, Beretta just got up to use the bathroom.

&gt; She is going to the bathroom, right, Blondie?

&gt; No, Beretta, stop.

&gt; That's the food line.

&gt; Goddammit, Beretta.

&gt; ""It was so good, I couldn't just have one!"" 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/what_the_hell.gif) she came back with two more Baconator meals.

&gt; End up at Wendy's for another hour while she eats. 

&gt; Finally get on the expressway.

&gt; Snow as far as the eye can see.

&gt; Fuck.

&gt; Little pink sunfires are not meant for snow coming down.

&gt; ""Blondie, pull over! We can stop at a hotel.""

&gt; No, we're going home, Beretta.

&gt; ""I don't like this! We're going to die and it'll be your fault. You are being so selfish, Blondie.""

The rest of the four hour ride home in the blizzard was Beretta alternating between crying that we were going to die or yelling that it was our fault she was going to die.

Spoiler alert:

none of us died.

Next day...

&gt; Get to school bright and early to venture out into the cold to perform our play. 

&gt; Half asleep but can hear the dulcet tones of Beretta's voice on the bus we're all riding on.

&gt; ""... Blondie and HHG had to stop for food, and then they were both freaking out the whole way home in the snow. I had to keep reassuring them we were fine. God, I'm never riding with them again. Did you know the only thing HHG will eat at Wendy's is chili? How sad is that.""

TL;DR Friend from High school wants to ride with Blondie and I. Insists on stopping for a Baconator, or two, or three, while a snow storm starts outside, then has the audacity to blame my friend and I when it took us several hours to drive home safely in the storm. Next day, denies everything and changes the story so she's the cool one.

Welcome back dear readers. RW is speaking to me again, and thus we have an update on her condishun. I don't want to spoil any of the story with silly background information, so we'll just dive right the fuck in.

&gt; Mentally prepared for a long ass day

&gt; Attempt to mentally prepare for dealing with RW for a glorious 6 hours together. (We overlap midday for lunch rush.)

&gt; RW flops in the door and makes sure to speak to everyone except me (lol like I give any fucks)

&gt; Takes her about 2 hours to get around to speaking to me, as we're stuck in a fucking box together and there isn't anyone else to talk with

&gt; Lard knows she ain't fuckin' helping customers.

&gt; RW ""Ugh, this medicine makes my mouth *so dry*.""

&gt; Me ""That diet pill?""

&gt; RW ""Yeah, it makes me retain less fluid. It's *super* obvious that I've lost a *ton* of weight.""

&gt; You could literally lose a ton more (tonne for you crazies).

&gt; Me ""How much have you lost?""

&gt; RW ""Three pounds!""

&gt; Luckily my back was to her, so she couldn't see me desperately trying to maintain my composure.

&gt; There was a wide range of emotions - hopefulness, hopelessness (a ton? rly?), and maybe a little bit of laughter.

For the record, I wasn't making fun of her weight loss. Her attitude about it was what made me snickers.

&gt; Me ""Have you been walking at all?""

&gt; RW ""Oh, I gave that up. Walking is bad for your joints. I don't want to get arthritis.""

:( I had such hope for you woman. Why would you do this to me?

&gt; Me ""What about your dog? Doesn't she get restless without exercise?""

&gt; RW ""Oh, no. She hates walks.""

IT'S A FUCKING DOG. THEY LOVE WALKS. YOUR DOG IS GOING TO BE FAT, TOO.

&gt; Me ""Are you still trying to eat better? Have you tried those smoothies I gave you the recipe for?""

&gt; RW ""I've tried some of it, but making food is a lot of work. I've just decided to *moderate* what I eat. That way I can still eat what I like and not have to worry about wasting time.""

So apparently women are supposed to *know how* to cook for their men, but not *actually* cook for them because it's a *waste of time*. Just so we're all clear here.

&gt; Me ""Moderation is good, but you should still get some veggies and fruit. They don't take much prep at least! Have you been saving some of the stuff from your mom's garden?""

&gt; RW ""No, I've been mostly giving away what mom won't eat. Raw food spoils too fast.""

&gt; Brain desperately wants to stop functioning.

&gt; Red alerts flashing. ABORT ABORT ABORT.

&gt; lol why would I do something logical like that.

&gt; Me ""I'll go on walks with you if you want. I know it's hard to go by yourself.""

&gt; RW ""I *told* you, walking is *bad* for your *joints*. If you want to go and kill yourself, be my guest! You're worse than mom. Just because my dad was 600 lbs she thinks that I'm following in his footsteps! I'm a big, beautiful, healthy woman! Skinny people just don't *listen*.""

We didn't speak for the rest of the day. She ordered mozzarella sticks and cheese fries for lunch, which admittedly is better than her previous family-sized orders, but still. :(

YOU WERE SO CLOSE. SO. CLOSE.

Oh! She has given up soda and sweet tea! That's a step in the right direction, at least.

**Chapter One**

It was Friday night, and I was bored. Bored of what little studying I'd forced myself to do, bored of sitting at my computer, and bored of my tiny apartment. I was even bored of the literally endless supply of pornography that the Internet had to offer. In fact, it had gotten to the point where viewing anything racier than a fast food commercial would leave me feeling frustrated and restless, wholly convinced that the only cure for my ennui was a commitment-free tryst with a new woman. So, as I had done on similar occasions, I turned to the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist, intent on propositioning someone willing to scratch my itch.

After mere moments, I found a likely candidate.

The advertisement was simple; little more than a paragraph and a picture barely covered breasts. The few lines of text described the owner of the cleavage as being nineteen, attractive, and in search of a man who could satisfy her. I needed no more prompting than that, and within seconds, I had sent off a suitably suggestive (and likely rather sleazy) response, indicating my interest in a late-night meeting. Both my picture and my AIM screen name were included in my letter... and a few minutes later, I heard the telltale chime of an incoming instant message.

“Hello,” was all that it said.

I quickly typed back, fueled by hope and hormones. “Hey there.”

“I got your letter,” came the reply. “Sounds hot.” This was punctuated by that annoying acronym, “LOL.” Had I known then what I would come to know later, I would have mentally substituted the webspeak for an affected titter, perhaps better thought of as “Teehee!”

At the time, I was unfazed. “Glad to hear it,” I answered. “Want to make it happen?”

“Let's get dinner first,” she said, “then see what happens.”

It seemed reasonable enough. After all, we were strangers, and a public meal was the accepted setting for gauging one another's intentions. We made plans to meet at a restaurant not far from where I lived, after which we would adjourn to one of our respective apartments. I took a brief shower and threw on some clothes, then headed out to rendezvous with my latest conquest.

The diner we'd decided on was less empty than I'd anticipated, but still sparsely populated for a Friday night. I glanced around the room, quietly hoping to lock eyes with a slender redhead. (After all, I had only seen my prospective date's chest, and it had seemed attractive enough.) Nobody met my gaze, leading me to wonder if I'd arrived too early. Then, from behind me, came an out-of-breath voice calling my name... and I turned to behold a nightmare given physical form.

She was short, clad in a too-tight sweatshirt and pajama pants, and must have weighed at least twice what I did. Two haphazard pigtails sprouted from each side of her head, leaving the rest of her short brown hair looking simultaneously oppressed and mutinous. Her makeup had apparently been an afterthought, as it consisted of no more than hastily applied eyeliner and lipstick the shade of a particularly bad bruise. When she spoke, it was with one of two voices: A tone of demanding entitlement, offered liberally to the restaurant hostess, or one of passive and meek cuteness, which seemed reserved for me. I was disappointed, dumbfounded, and frankly a little bit disgusted, both by her appearance and her behavior... and I was to soon find out, there was much, much worse to come.

1374456660.0	1is84w	"Makeup Whale: Part III, ""Fortune's Fool"""	Poor-Yorick	441	75	276	"Good evening, darling readers. 

I had originally planned to finish this saga (which starts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i3z1c/makeup_whale_part_i_the_plays_the_thing/) and contains links to the next parts) with the tale of how I valiantly conquered the land-whale and saved my little theater from her reign of terror. I had planned to recount fond memories of glorious battle, and my triumphant victory over the beast that had so long plagued my directing career. 

However, it is with a solemn voice (keyboard?) and a heavy heart that I come to you, FPS. It appears that unlike many of the brave, assertive writers here, I have been bested by this monstrosity. *But how could this be?* You ask yourselves. As I sit here quietly munching my dinner, I ask myself the same question. To understand what has taken place here, we must take a step back in time— if only to yesterday evening, about 24 hours ago. This tale has no happy ending, so prepare your jimmies for rustling and no relief. I'm afraid this won't have as much flowery language or vivid imagery, this took place mostly via telephone and is so fresh in my memory it stings a little. Picture this, if you will. 

For those that don't remember: I, Poor-Yorick, am an 18 year old girl. 5'6"" and thanks to having a significant amount of weight recently due to health issues, I'm pretty thin at around 110 lbs. My boyfriend, previously dubbed CB, is about an inch taller and of an average build. The antagonist of this series is MW, whose physical appearance is currently a source of revulsion for me; without giving further details, I can assure you, she's a ham. She and CB attend the same small church in my town, and recently their youth group went on a mission trip. I was a little apprehensive about CB going, MW has a tendency to manipulate people into liking her (for some ungodly reason). Despite her previously assaulting him, I knew she had it in her to draw him back into her gravitational field and I didn't want that. You see, dear readers, I'm still very much laid up, and unable to really get involved if something was to happen. But he and I have been together for quite some time, so I placed all my trust in him and sent him on his merry way. I got text messages at least once a day saying how much fun he was having playing basketball with the kids at a children's home, teaching them about Jesus, all sorts of fun things. I was quite the proud girlfriend this week. 

Enter, QuietGirl (QG). I get a text at maybe 7 in the evening, a picture sent from QG of CB and.....MW. Eating together, seated at a two-person table in the middle of Beetus Barrel, while the rest of the group sat at a larger table nearby. Apparently the two had been getting quite cozy on this trip. I asked CB what the deal was, he denied any association with her. Knowing this to be false, I went straight to the source. Summoning all of my God-given strength and southern-upbringing-given manners, I dialed MW's number and prepared to unleash polite hell. 

*""MW, this is Poor-Yorick. Would you care to tell me what you're doing with CB right now?""*

She didn't even deny it. She told me up front that she'd been seeing him behind my back for quite a while. I laid there in my bed at a complete loss for words, shocked and close to tears as this greasy whore regaled me with stories of their good time together and how he deserved better than someone as ""fragile"" as me. You would've loved it, FPS. It was an impressive tirade about how my skinny, bony little body wasn't enough to sate his lust for a real, bonafide southern belle like her. After a good 5 minutes of having the last 3 years of my life shattered by this gargantuan homewrecker, I had enough and hung up the phone. Called QG, who despite my best attempts to rectify the situation, confirmed what MW had said. 

You read it right, folks. I, your humble OP, have become an example for ham-beasts everywhere. Apparently it *is* possible for a greasy, obnoxious monstrosity to steal someone's long time love away from them. I wish I had some sort of justice to treat you with, but seeing this most recent ending, it wouldn't be right to not give you all the whole truth. 

And so, we've reached the curtain call in this series. Perhaps I'll someday have a prologue for you, but for now I'm afraid things are too volatile and I'm too sick to really do much but sit here and type. Writing this is cathartic, and perhaps this will be my way of getting revenge on that unspeakably nasty girl. I don't really feel like reading back over this right now, so comment if there are glaring errors and I'll fix them as I find time. Thank you for reading, and God bless all of you. 

Until next time...stay curvy, my friends. 

Edit: Thank you all for your kind comments! I had a long, loooooooooooooooooooooooong conversation with MW last night/this morning. Many nasty greasy tears were shed on her part, and a couple new curse words were invented (much to the chagrin of my housemates) on mine. I'm beyond grateful for all your kind comments, and although it pains me to say this, CB and I are done. You guys are fantastic, and thankfully/unfortunately it looks like I'll still have to deal with MW at the theater in the coming days/weeks. Pretty much whenever I'm okay to go out and do stuff again. That being said, I can only hope justice will be served, but if not, at least I've still got the high ground. Thanks again for reading! "	t5_2vzax	True
1374019694.0	1ig8vj	[Series] Trey’s Turbulent Travail - Part I: Tales of a Social Worker Part VI	onikakushi	438	78	67	"My fellow fat-fueled fiends, I once again petition you to prepare for the practice of placating your penchant for porcine pleasantries. Today, I will ration you another recital from my musing meanderings in the microcosm of my life. 

For those just joining the journey, you can find Part I [here](http://redd.it/1gthdi), Part II [here](http://redd.it/1gvxza), Part III [here]( http://redd.it/1gyaj6), Part IV [here]( http://redd.it/1hpcon) and Part V [here]( http://redd.it/1iaw25).

During our last engagement, we found ourselves in the predicament of pulling the plug on a romance seemingly borne from the fires of perdition. As Tom and I had had no one else to blame but ourselves for this porky purgatory, we sought to purify it by any process possible.

As torrid flames of their repugnant rapture relentlessly railed on us, we were forced to rely upon a revolting route for our revenge. But, as Machiavelli so aptly ascertained, “the end justifies the means.” With our scheme trumped by a tailor-made tactic by Taylor, we seemingly secured solace. As we enjoyed our holiday hiatus, we believed our beef with the Berthas had been brought to an end.

However, our return to the workplace that January offered us no such respite—and as we would soon find, things are not always so black and white.

With the New Year, the syrupy snows and slush of December had departed and left in favor of a punishing durance of bone-chilling winds. Nothing would prevent the cold from seeping into your warmest coat and thickest scarf—it was the kind of weather that made you heavily reconsider any attempt at braving the outdoors.

As I walked into the office each morning and slowly thawed out, I noticed the small army of space-heaters under each and every Bertha’s desk—it seemed with a lack of proper fashion outlets during this time of year, desk accessories were the next best thing.

Like any of Scrooge’s employees, the extra heat these units provided was universally appreciated. That is of course, with the unsurprising exception of Trey.

Walking in each morning in nothing more than cargo shorts and a t-shirt, his staggering frame was enough to make anyone else cold by proxy. However, it appeared that the cold truly did not bother him—it seemed his days in the desert as ‘shirtless Aladdin’ had trained his body for extreme temperatures. 

Since the episode during the Christmas party it seemed the Berthas at least, had decided that someone’s improperly prepared dessert had been the culprit for their group rectal riot—as they were all equally embarrassed already, no individual blame was cast.

They had largely returned to their old behavior—that is, they no longer felt the need to discuss sexual topics during lunch. Regardless of the reason for this change, Tom and I were in no mood to complain.

Around two weeks following our return to the office, Tom came to the lunch table with important news.

“What’s up Tom?” I casually asked.

“You aren’t going to believe this man…I just was down in the mailroom—you know the new electronic mail system we had installed over break?” He replied.

The old handwritten mail system had finally been brought into the digital age. This of course meant that the mailroom employees were forced to learn an entirely new system. Anyone in IT will tell you—a new system is *always* a pain, and this was no exception.

“Trey nearly managed to break the scanner already dude,” Tom continued, “I just spent all morning helping him figure it out.”

At this point, I still didn’t understand why any of this was a big deal—somehow this didn’t warrant the look on Tom’s face.

“And?” I probed, questioningly.

“Ugh…well, it turns out he needs help with his personal laptop as well—he’s going to be here any minute with it,” Tom guiltily sighed.

Ah. Trey hadn’t eaten in the lunchroom since before Christmas break—it seemed as though he and Rotundra’s relationship was on thin-ice (although I doubt *any* ice would be thick enough to take their combined weight). Regardless, this was going to be interesting.

It didn’t take long for us to see Trey lumbering our way with what looked to be the remains of a heavily abused MacBook Pro. He laid it down in front of Tom and sat down.

“Thanks for this man, I really appreciate it…my sister lives on this thing—that’s why it looks like that,” Trey explained.

After some 20 minutes of fiddling around with various settings and cleaning it up a bit, Tom had it back to working condition. As he handed it back across the table Trey’s eyes watered a bit as he choked out, 

“You don’t know how much this will mean to her, thank you so much.”  

With that he stood up, shook both of our hands and walked out of the lunchroom—as he got up I noticed the absolute death stare Rotundra was giving him as he left.

We resumed our lunch while Tom explained to me that she had somehow managed to just get it locked into an infinite loop—nothing was really wrong with it. However, the MacBook itself was none of my concern, I found myself far more interested in the emotional response he had to it being fixed.

At lunch the next day, Tom and I found ourselves again sitting with Trey. It turned out that he had been eating by himself in the mailroom since we had been back—neither of us had invited him, but it was clear he needed a friend or two. Thus, we resigned ourselves to eating with him—until he gave us a reason not to.

Over the course of the following week, thanks to Trey’s lunches, I was exposed to some of the most horrifying culinary abominations I had ever seen. His choices left me speechless; I had never encountered the combinations and sheer quantities he consumed before. 

I stayed my verbal blade and let him munch toward an early grave for the first three days or so, but finally I had had enough. He had brought a mini-cooler filled with multiple servings of Chinese take-out, followed by a family-sized bowl of macaroni, ¾ a deep-dish pizza with two obligatory 3-liter bottles of RC Cola to wash it all down. I sat aghast and in sheer disbelief, the man ate as though it were a matter of life and death—he could not consume fast enough.

In retrospect, it was not the food that sealed the deal for me—it was the look he had in his eyes as he ate that summoned up the courage in me to say something. I knew the look in his eyes all too well, those weren’t the eyes of a man enjoying a meal—I could see him shoveling his feelings into his mouth with every bite, it was clear he was hurting. 

“Trey, what are you doing tonight man?” I asked as casually as I could.

He barely stopped inhaling food to speak, but between bites he replied, “Same as every night, watch TV until I pass out on the couch.”

“Why don’t you come to the gym with Tom and me then? We go every weekday, you should go—it’ll be good for you,” I suggested.

Initially he was skeptical and standoffish about the whole idea—but after Tom jumped in and gave me a hand, we finally managed to convince him to accompany us to the gym that evening.

Since Trey didn’t have a car and relied on public transportation to get back and forth from work, we went to go pick him up later that night. We had known from the address he had scribbled down that he lived in an impoverished area, but what we found was much worse than either of us had imagined.

Bleak streets, battered buildings and boarded up houses adorned nearly every street corner, there were no signs of life anywhere to be seen. As we pulled up to his house, we noticed there *was* a car in the driveway—Rotundra’s car. Neither of us had realized that they were living together at this point, to say we were shocked would be the understatement of the century.

Upon ringing the doorbell I half-expected Rotundra herself to answer the door—I braced for impact. However, a new face greeted us at the door—a 20-something year old girl who seemed dreadfully out of place. She was neither ugly, overweight, nor near Trey’s age, it didn’t add up…who the hell *is* she?

Over her shoulder Trey appeared, “Well don’t just stand there you two, come on in!” He bellowed.

“This is my younger sister, Chris—she’s the one who’s MacBook you fixed the other day. Chris, this is Onikakushi and Tom, they’re my friends from work I told you about.” He continued.

Wait.

I’m supposed to believe *this* girl is Trey’s sister—I don’t even. Logic had broken down, and I was honestly speechless.

Luckily, she giggled a bit and broke the silence, “Hi, I’m Trey’s sister, Chris. Thanks for always taking care of my brother, he talks about you two all the time!” She said while beaming.

It was right about then—the guilt that had been slowly bubbling up in my gut ever since we had gotten back, was beginning to hit me hard. I had no time to contemplate my sins though, Trey grabbed a gym bag and headed out the door with Tom and me following in lock-step after him.

The first night Trey came with us to the gym will live on in my memory forever; it was clear that he was out of shape and he knew it. However, he continued and tried his best to keep up with us—sitting out as necessary. By the time we dropped him off back at his house later that night we practically had to carry him inside—we figured he’d never make it again and that the excuses would come at lunch tomorrow.

We were wrong. He came in the next day with more questions—this time about food. It seemed he really wanted to give changing his life a shot and we were happy to help.

Over the course of the next few weeks, what had once been buckets of fried food slowly evolved into progressively healthier options. Perhaps most surprising was his lack of knowledge on the subject of food—he knew what he had been eating was unhealthy, but had no idea what was, either. 

Up to that point I had never appreciated that some people did not understand nutrition—I had always taken it as a basic fact of life. Something that everyone learned as a child from their parents and in turn taught to their kids. But, as Trey so perfectly illustrated—this simply was not the case for some people.

As Trey’s workout debut was approaching its three-week anniversary, we realized the impact it was having not only on him (he had lost some 40lbs by then), but on his relationship with Rotundra. The mere mention of a diet in her presence was enough to send her into a thin privilege fueled rampage—I do not want to imagine the friction created by her significant other getting *healthy.*

That night he dragged in the workout—it was dreadfully apparent, something was off.

As we were running on the treadmill, out of nowhere he slammed the stop button and stormed out of the gym into the freezing January evening. Realizing that something was very wrong, we chased after only to find him on the steps crying his eyes out.

Whatever the two of us had been expecting—it most certainly was not *this.* Neither of us quite knew what to do. 

But, soon Trey let loose the floodgates and through the tears choked out his life story to us.

It turns out that my evaluation of him had been spot on—he truly was a hurt man. When he was a mere ten years old, following the birth of his younger sister Chris, his father decided to up and disappear from their lives.

With his father’s departure and his mother’s inability to hold down a decent job, it was left to Trey to pick up the slack for the family and try to make ends meet. Making a bad situation worse, his mother took his father’s departure as a personal attack and did mental gymnastics to blame it on her weight. 

In a sick twist of fate, this in turn led to her using food as a replacement lover—resulting in super morbid obesity. By his 15th birthday he was finally old enough to work a ‘real’ job—but, his mother had ballooned up to somewhere near 500lbs and was no longer mobile.

As his mother continued to gain weight and fuel her addiction, the role of father also fell upon his shoulders. This led to the bizarre relationship between him and his sister that much more closely resembled a father/daughter relationship than that of siblings. He had been the one who had taken her to school events, had come in to class as her father on ‘job day’—the whole shebang.

Their mother had let herself go so badly that she had died by the time Trey was 19, and he had legally taken custody of his sister in an effort to save her from foster care. Since then, the two of them had been living together—doing the best they could. However, with a life as punishing as his it is no surprise that he needed *something* to use as a crutch. And, following in the footsteps of his mother, he had turned to food as a way to cope with everything. 

He continued on to tell us that he had had a row with Rotundra earlier that night about him working out—apparently after he had told her the reason why, she still told him it was dumb and that he was only going to fail. According to him, something had ‘finally clicked’ and he realized that this was likely his last chance to save himself from going down the same road as his mother. But, apparently for Rotundra—his health came second to her feelings on the matter.

Finishing his story, he looked up at the sky , cleared his throat, wiped his face and clearly said one last thing, “I can’t leave my sister like my parents left me, I can’t do that.”

Needless to say, Tom and I were at a complete loss for words. Not even the freezing cold air outside was enough to snap us out of the slack jawed awe we were in. After a few minutes we finally managed to compose ourselves enough to head back inside and call it a night.

As I lay in bed following Trey’s parking lot confessional, my guilt over what I had done to the man had finally hit critical mass—I needed to make this right. I called Tom and told him how I felt, and after some debate we reached a conclusion: we must remove Rotundra from his life.

Tom and I decided that instead of the gym, tonight the three of us would go out to dinner and attempt to convince Trey to oust Rotundra from his house—and more importantly from his life. We didn’t ask his opinion on the subject of dinner, and instead pulled into the parking lot of a local family restaurant and told him it was on us.

Without too much protest we managed to get seated and get our orders placed,

“So c’mon guys…what’s this all about?” Trey prodded.

“Well Trey, I’ll be frank—Rotundra has got to go,” Tom replied flatly.

**TL;DR – Don’t judge a burger by the bun.**

1373578495.0	1i3z1c	"Makeup Whale: Part I, ""The Play's the Thing"""	Poor-Yorick	444	79	57	"Good evening, my curvaceous darlings! First off, I cannot thank you enough for the amazing response to my last story, you guys are incredibly sweet. I have become absolutely ensnared by this sub (I'm sure your collective gravitational pull has nothing to do with it) and it is with great joy that I bring you a (much more recent) tale of fat-logic in the theatrical arts (and how many a costume met its fateful end). To give a bit of background, I'm a *long* time veteran of the stage, and I volunteer my free time at a youth theatre here in town. The events of this story go back about a year ago, and subsequent installments take place as recently as yesterday. 

So, without further ado, picture this, if you will. 

*Barrrrely* 18yo me, frantically herding ~50 teenage actors across a stage as we begin auditions for the show Hairspray. This being my first time (assistant) directing a musical, I wasn't about to potentially screw anything up. Planning stages had gone off without a hitch, costumes were in order, lights were up and working, and it was on this fateful day, as I took a step back to admire my handiwork, I felt the ground begin to shake. 

*An earthquake?* I thought. 

If only I'd been so fortunate. It was no act of nature that set our poor, run-down theater to shaking. I heard the tell-tale *screeeeeeck* of the ancient floorboards shrieking in pain as I spun around to find myself faced with 5 feet 2 inches of Gothapotamus, which I hesitantly classified as female. Although its appearance squicked me out, I wasn't about to be rude to this beast, because theatre is supposed to be all-inclusive....and definitely not because it looked like it was about to eat me. 

""DO YOU KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE HEEAH?!"" she bellowed in my direction. Not wanting to subject our elderly head director to this monstrosity, I told her that she was, in fact, addressing the person in charge. ""NAW. YOU LOOK LIKE A KID. I WANT AN ADULT."" Bear in mind, I later found out this chick (if I dare use such a term) is actually younger than me. However, I was too frazzled to care about the insult and insisted that I was the one she needed. She *harrumph'ed* and informed me she was there to audition, and despite my better judgement I directed her to the waiting area before going about the rest of my business. 

Hairspray, for the uninformed, centers around a pudgy girl named Tracy who wins a spot on a local television dance show (this takes place in 1960s Baltimore) and uses her fame to introduce racial integration. Naturally, we had many actually-curvy young women show up to try for the leading role. To be considered, these girls had to sing, act, and most importantly, *dance.* Each hopeful stepped up, performed her monologue and sang her piece, with Fupa-saurus doing a mediocre rendition of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaT7DaqPbxs) overdone number. After that facepalm-inducing performance, we took a short break for water and stretching as we prepared to take on the dance audition. 

Our choreographer performed a short combination (think something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SS06EsgOeQ) with a few more moves here and there) and the girls were expected to perform it back in groups of 5 or 6. The stage shakes as the Beast awkwardly stamps around and Bob Fosse does cartwheels in his grave. I'm pacing back and forth, watching the group and taking notes, when I see one of the larger spandex-clad bulges in the back slowing down. I'm ~~immensely shocked~~ not even remotely surprised to see Her Massiveness wheezing and sweating and not really trying. Finally, between sets she raises her hand and asks for a break. This elicits a groan from the other girls, which gives me the impression she'd complained before. The head director shook her head and told her we only had a few more minutes, and that she'd had a break not long ago. This did *not* please the monster one bit, and she informed the room that she had....wait for it.....a ""condishun"" that made it hard for her to exercise. Something to do with her knees, something to do with her hips, and to my complete astonishment our director answered with ""Well then, come forward, sweetheart! Come sit on the edge of the stage so I can talk to you!"" in the sweetest tone of voice I've ever heard. Keep in mind, this woman is 5 feet of pure redheaded anger, so I was boggled by this point. Gothapotamus smirks at the other girls (who are rolling their eyes at this point) and saunters up to the front edge of the stage before plopping down in a sweaty, jiggly heap in front of where the director was standing. I (along with the choreographer and the rest of the girls) stood there gaping as the following conversation took place.

""So your knees hurt?"" 
""Uh-huh.""
""And your hips hurt?""
""Yeah.""
""Oh, you poor poor thing. Do you want some water?""
""I dun *like* water."" 
""I see. Well I'm afraid we don't have anything else."" 
[Insert harrumph here]

By this point I'm checking myself for a pulse, wondering if I've stumbled into the Twilight Zone. This pity laden schmooze-fest goes on for a few more seconds, when suddenly, in the same chipper tone of voice, the director adds,

""Well. I'd say we're done with you then! Thank you, get your things and leave.""

Jiggle beast does not understand. Jiggle beast is not happy. Director goes to continue the auditions, motioning for the Blob to exit the stage. But wait! Blob is not moving! She rears back to begin howling at us, but the director is faster. She explains that since Blob cannot dance for even a full minute without hurting herself, there would be no way she could handle a two hour show. This further angers the beast, who begins stamping her feet and squealing about how it's ""unfair"" that we didn't give her a part. I (stupidly) shout that if she wants to help so badly, she can come back and crew the show with us. Dagger glares from the whole building suggest that might've been a bad idea- but I only wanted to placate the monster so she wouldn't bring the walls down. She wasn't satisfied by this, and left in an almighty huff. I thought we'd seen the last of her, but I was so incredibly wrong. 

Tune in next time for the RETURN of Jiggle Beast, with a special visit from Shakespeare, Director's Daughter and The Boyfriend. 

The ""makeup"" part comes next time, as does the really juicy part. Stay tuned!

1370655535.0	1fwhze	[NSFW] Hammallow tantrum'd over not being allowed to eat while wearing new and expensive marching band uniform, then leaves a mess in friend's bathroom after losing virginity	Asanthorne	444	81	64	"The first part of this story is a FPS, but the second half is more along the lines of a shitty human being story with a FP twist.

____________________________________________________________

This is the story of **Hammallow**, who I spent two years of my life with in marching band. She was roughly 5'3 and 250-260 lbs and looked [kinda like this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-34297-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0) at age 16. Every time she came into view during practices or competitions, it was painfully obvious she was huffing and puffing over her flute (the cute instrument for cute girls, teehee) instead of playing it. She was the stereotypical flirtatious hamgirl and hit on anything that might have had a penis. Some people called her ""Marshmallow"" because of her squishy shape and ""porcelain complexion"". Think white printer paper paper light. She wouldn't need high-vis clothing at my workplace because her skin is so reflective. Her mother seemed like the vicariously-living-through-my-only-child type and naturally came to EVERYTHING. Whenever Hammallow acted out, it was **""Oh, it's her condition. Her condition makes her do that. She can't control her condition.""** I don't think anyone ever knew what the alleged condition was.

Anyway, so Hammallow loved her snacks. She downed nearly two whole boxes of the Moon Pies one of the band moms brought to one of our competitions. I mean, those things are damn tasty but bwaah? 

So there we are at a competition, all bright-eyes and ready to band so hard, and I hear a loud wail. Well, it was kind of a squeaky wail, as Hammallow was very proud of her cutesy high-pitched voice
&gt;misophonia.jpg

She was **OMG STARRRRRRVVVVVIIIINNNNNGGGG** and was bawling her eyes out because Mr. Director Guy yelled at her when she brought out a brownie in the practice field. We just got new uniforms that year (which were about half white) and we had always had a ""no noms in uniform"" rule to minimize stains and messes. It was **COMPLETELY UNFAIR** that she had to march/waddle on an ""empty stomach"" (spoiler alert: she had a meal-sized snack just before we got off the bus an hour before). She was going to faint! She was going to pass out! Her health was being jeopardized over a few scraps of fabric (hint: we seamstresses don't call fabric that size a ""scrap"").

Hammallow made it through the show just fine, and ate more than her fair share of the Moon Pies.
________________________________________________________________

Fast forward a year, I had since quit band so I could work more evenings, and Hammallow was enjoying her time as an almighty band sEnIoR, teehee. I was just sitting around, derping around with some of my former bandmates at TBell, when our friend SF (Scarred Forever) bursts in the door with a pale sheen of cold sweat donning her face.

""Sorry I'm late but GUYS GUYS GUYS. YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT THAT BITCH HAMMALLOW JUST DID AT MY HOUSE."" I thought she and 'Mallow were teh besties, but apparently that was freshly called off. Hammallow had been hanging out at SF's house a lot recently because of the cyoooote neighbor boi, teehee. Three days ago they were talking. Two days ago they were making out in the living room. Yesterday he was fingering her, STILL IN THE DAMN LIVING ROOM. Being the nice person SF was, she told them to knock off the kissing, and to find somewhere else other than her couch when she walked in on the fingering.

The next day, SF (against her better judgement) left to get snacks without kicking the two out. Maybe she didn't want to see the gross? She lived with her mom, who was at work, so she couldn't supervise either.

SF gets back, and sees Hammallow's car going the other direction. Walked in the house, no sign of cyooooote neighbor boi. Sets bags down, goes to bathroom.

Remember how yesterday she told them to find somewhere else? AND FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY DID. That somewhere else happened to be SF's bathroom.

Condom on the floor. Condom wrapper in the sink. Hand and fat roll prints on the mirror. And blood on the counter. **BLOOD. MOTHAFUCKIN BLOOD**. Blood on the condom, blood on the floor.Gotta love the mess a freshly broken hymen leaves, right? SF let out a scream of rage, and rage dialed Hammallow and CNB to get their asses back to her house to clean up the mess they left.

Hammallow denied it was her, but WHO THE FUCK ELSE WAS GOING TO HAVE BLOODY SEX IN THAT HOUSE AT THIS TIME OF DAY? CNB apologized and started to go clean up the mess with some Lysol and paper towels, while 'Mallow blew up in SF's face for not being a courteous host and something along the lines of ""You're just jealous that I finally got a real man who wants my curves and not yours!"" SF was overweight as well, but less spherical-ish.

CNB and Hammallow finally got the remains of their sexcapade cleaned up, and they were banned from the house forever.
__________________________________________________________________
I haven't seen much of them since we all graduated high school and went our separate ways, but the last anyone's seen of Hammallow was one summer afternoon when she was spotted in a pickup truck bed full of Mexicans.

1368551981.0	1ebq0s	The death of a monster burrito	None4GretchenWieners	467	102	115	"Hello again lovely faces, my beetus-thighroid is has recovered from the calorie loss that was last week, so here I am to present you with another juicy beetus-filled story.

This one takes place at a friend's dorm room where we all had a ton of take-out from a near-by burrito place that is known for their 18 inch long 5lb monster of a burrito.

Be me, 19, walking back to friend's house with a couple other people with enough food to feed and entire college dorm. We had gotten two of the 5lb monstrosities, one as a joke to challenge a friend who eats more than anyone I know and doesn't gain a single pound (let's call him Skinnybro), and one for the rest of us to share. We had also gotten some quesadillas and tacos just in case any vegetarian friends or people who didn't want any burrito showed up. We had also picked up ~2 gallons of some crappy horchata from the grocery store because we were too broke to afford the delicious restaurant stuff.

We get back to our bro's (who I'm just gonna call Bro) apartment where we see this fat fuck of a person, can't tell the height because he never stood up in my presence, but he was at least 350 lbs. Bro says it's his uncle, who is in town for a visit and has insisted on hanging out in his dorm room. Kinda creepy this guy wants to hang out in a college dorm room, but whatever, just ignore Sr. Beetusfat, right? Wrong.

As soon as we unpack the food Beetusfat immediately starts whining that he's hungry, hasn't eaten all day, and all the other fat person bullshit. We ask Skinnybro if he's up to eating a monster burrito, but he says no, he had a huge lunch and just wanted a little bit of food, so we put one of the burritos in front of Beetusfat, then put all the other food on a table that was set up in Bro's room. We also give Beetusfat two of the half-gallon containers of horchata. We open everything for him, then go to nibble on the other food we brought.

A little more than 10 minutes after we sat down to eat, we hear a loud ass belch from the other room. We look out, and see that Beetusfat has made the entire 5lb food baby and the horchata disappear. We look around, thinking he dropped it, but no, he had eaten everything.

“I'm still hungry!” Beetusfat whines. “I know you guys have more food, bring some over here!”

Bro puts his foot down. “No. You have eaten enough.”

We all go back into the other room and blast some music to drown out Beetusfat. Over the course of the next hour, more people from the dorm show up because food. We don't mind sharing as they all have brought stuff to trade, mainly booze, soda, and weed. In the next hour all 20-something of us are stoned, drunk, full, and feeling great. The food is all gone now, and we can still slightly hear Beetusfat from the other room. He's still whining about being hungry even though he ate a whole 5lb death trap. He's complaining about having the munchies from his “contact high” and his (wait for it guys.... Wait for iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...) diabeetus. OFW Bro says his uncle doesn't even have the beetus.

Eventually people start to leave, and Skinnybro, Bro, and I start cleaning up and opening the windows to air the place out. Beetusfat immediately singles out Skinnybro, saying shit about him being anorexic and needing to eat because the “hot bitches” don't like men who don't ever eat. In my drunken high haze I start giggling, which gradually turns into full-out laughing so hard no sound is coming out and I'm clapping my hands like a retarded seal. When I finally stop, I tell Beetusfat that there is no way in hell these “hot bitches” he was speaking of would ever be attracted to him or any other morbidly obese man.

Beetusfat starts calling me a fucking cunt and whatnot and I nope out of the room because he's harshing my mellow. Skinnybro follows me and we go to his car where I pull out my pipe and some of my own personal weed and smoke a bowl with him before I end up cutting that fat fuck. After a while Bro texts us to tell us that Beetusfat is leaving, so I pack up my stuff and we head back up. Apparently Bro ripped Beetusfat a new asshole about invading his living space, whining like a child, and disrespecting his friends. Bro scared him into leaving by threatening to call the police and tell them he was pushing drugs on college kids. I give Bro a bowl of my personal stash (shit is goooood) to smoke on his own so he can chill and forget about his uncle for a while.

TL;DR I'm currently using red wine as brain bleach acuz I don't have vodka and my beetus-thighroid demands cake."	t5_2vzax	True
1374273414.0	1inufx	Fatty Prime and the Anime Con Adventure!	Hufflepuff_Princess	452	90	135	"You want a Fat Person Story? Here is a story.


Character Profiles


Me: 5'3, Half white half asian, slim figure but swimming and running now. Getting sexy also lesbian, also art major with focus in painting and sculpting with a minor photography. (Relevant later I SWEAR)


Hot Con Girl: (Let us call her Connie) Meet her at con. Turns out she is model at the Japanese Model show where they have models wear fashion from Japan. Turns out to be an actual up and rising model.


Girl A (Call her Sara): Friend from animu club works on committee and helped raise funds for this trip


Girl B (Call her May): President of Animu club. Cool girl, but also losing faith in club because majority of members are landwhales who do nothing.


FP: Fatty Prime rarely comes to club meetings, but is usually seen outside of the Asian American club stalking guys and trying to use her broken Japanese to seduce them. (Beware the fatlogic is strong in this one) I couldn’t tell you her weight, but she has trouble standing and walking. Refuses to exercise because of her knee issues, and if she doesn’t see progress in first two weeks of low intensity exercise she gives up. She claims to be on the “anime diet” now. (Don’t.. just don’t ask)


Small Notes to Consider:
Most anime clubs are hambeasts, but fairly well behaved.
My friends and I sat in the back of the bus. Advisor was in the front
Rustled jimmies. Beware.

Let the story Commence. 


&gt;Anime club at school is planning trip to an anime con. School is originally hesitant at first, but we manage to secure funding and transportation to con. Each student has to pay $100. For ticket, hotel, bus fare, etc.


&gt;I pay the moment I can and I’m secured to go. Excited for trip going to Otakon!


&gt;Time passes and time to go. I get on bus with friends, and 25 others that paid. 


&gt;FP comes waddling by with FIVE bags of luggage. (Limit was two) and she attempts to stop door from closing so she can get on. She hasn’t paid her $100 and she stuffs her bags into the bus despite it being pretty full. She shouts that she has paid. This continues for a while and we eventually give in and decide to check the records later. Club advisor is beta as fuck.


Shesmellsterrible.wif


&gt;FP refuses to shower saying it is bad for the hair and skin. She boards the bus and nearly tilts it as she waddles to her seat. She has a scowl on her face as she is literally filling the aisle and can barely squeeze inbetween the seats.


&gt;”These buses were made with thin privileges obviously.” She says as she begins looking for seats. Most are filled, and because of her size she takes up TWO seats instead of the usual one. Sara and May give up their seats. We are small enough to squeeze all of us into a two seater. Its uncomfortable, but not unbearable. 


&gt;Bus ride is enjoyable. FP is complaining about not having enough leg room. We ignore her and watch movies on my kindle. She keeps trying to listen / talk to us. We just ignore.


&gt;”Excuse me Hufflepuff!” she shouts at me. I look over and answer and she warns me to stay away from *her* men. I’m confused because she can’t accept I’m a lesbian who deny amazing asian mancock?


Vomit.exe


&gt;Sara and May laugh it off. Both of their boyfriends are going to be 
at the con already, and May being the only other asian in club has an asian boyfriend. I hope FP can behave.


&gt;Four hours into bus ride and kinda hungry. I made granola bars (Homemade. YAY!) to share with friends. FP sees this and freaks out. 


&gt;”You are such a fake asian.” She shouts at me.


&gt;Wat


&gt;she tells me how can I deny my heritage by eating granola bars? I look at it and say its healthy, yummy, and fruity. (Love fruit zomg) She sneers and takes out a *TRUE HONEST REAL ASIAN FOOD* A huge tupperware of Ramen. Not real ramen but that fake packaged shit, and by huge tupperware. I mean huge. As in I could stuff a thanksgiving turkey in there.


&gt;I tell her I’m not a fan of instant ramen, and she freaks out. I plan to ignore. She also complains about lack of microwaves and forks on bus. Wat.


&gt;Feel something hit me on the cheek as I’m ignoring


&gt;Friends looking around at ceiling seeing if bus is about to cave in.


&gt;See FP eating her cold ramen (With her hands). Can’t be her..right?


&gt;Ignore and go back to reading on Kindle. Sara and May pass out on each other’s shoulders. Looks cute, but I want to draw on their faces.


Dawwwhereismymarker.avi


&gt;Feel something hit me again, and again, and again. Look around and pretend to read this time.


&gt;FP is tosses pieces of pocky and other stereotypical “otaku” foods at me. Ask her why she is doing it?


&gt;”I’m doing it so you can accept your heritage!” She says to me with obvious anger in her eyes. I ask her to stop.


&gt;”WAHH how could you say that pocky is delicious!” she pretty much splutters ramen juice everywhere (She is halfway done with food. Her hands are gross and greasy) 


&gt;I give up and go back to reading. Put hood on head to protect from fatty grease.


Hoodiepowersactivate.gun


&gt;7 hours into bus ride. Tired and falling asleep. FP is holding her stomach. Her ramen is gone and she keeps digging in her bag for more food to eat. 


&gt;She complains about lack of a real restroom on this ride (She was too big to fit into the only one in all fairness it is small. I barely fit in there) 


&gt;She complains about thin privilege and how she will sue the school once this is over.


&gt;I fall asleep against my friends. 


&gt;Few hours later. I wake up to a nasty sound.


&gt;FP is looking around. Most of the students are asleep. She looks nervous..


&gt;She didn’t


&gt;She hasn’t..


&gt;She did.


&gt;She shit her pants and complains how she never did. I go back to sleep. 


&gt;Wake up to see we are in baltimore, but smell lingers.


&gt;Get off of bus and breathe that fresh city air. Lungs blacken from pollution but thankful for being free of FP’s gas.


&gt;FP squees and pretty much plows through every student, and tries to get into con early by cutting the huge line. We scream at her to stop and we all see it. Huge shit stains on her sweat pants.


&gt;We agree to go to the hotel first but what then?


Has FP really paid what she owed? Does she even have a room and with WHO? Will she contain herself and behave herself til the end of this con? Find out next time! (4 Stories Left)
Sorry about the length guys. First time telling a story, and I’m pretty bad at it. Hope you enjoyed it though.

1369849975.0	1fa4ud	Porkplanet owes me a new blouse	None4GretchenWieners	473	113	111	"Happy cheat day fatties, I have a short FPS for you today. I don't have as much time as I'd like to write stories for all of you, but I still want to keep your beetus-thighroids at a moderately safe level.

Be me on the weekend after my 18th birthday, out at a nice Irish pub on a Saturday afternoon with friends. FakeIDs.bamfs Friends are shooting some pool, I am at the bar getting a drink. I'm sitting there chatting up Bartender while he pours seven different beers into 6oz glasses (fuckyeahflights.gif) when the floor starts to shake and the glasses on the shelves start clinking. Figure it's just minor earthquake, we are in California after all, and the music is turned down really low in this place. Nope, not an earthquake, just a porkplanet. Porkplanet walks up but doesn't say anything, she just sits there looking pissed. After about a minute she reaches over and grabs Bartender's arm and he jumps like someone poured cold water on him and wrenches him arm away. I notice his arm is now drenched in sweat/grease/lord knows what. He immediately dries off his arm with his bar rag and tells Porkplanet to never, ever touch him. Porkplanet is now giving me the death glare. I don't pay her too much attention, I'm not looking to get into any fights, and there's a bouncer ~10 feet away. As I get my small tray of beer, Porkplanet walks right up to me, places both hands on my chest, and shoves so hard I actually hit the wall that was 5 feet behind me. R.I.P. my boobs. Bartender calls the police. My brand-new blouse was covered in sweat, grease, and beer. The bouncer walks right over and tells Porkplanet she needs to leave. Bartender helps me up, and I am in tears and looking for my friends who are now noticing the commotion and walking over. At this point I give zero fucks, so I pull off my blouse, go grab my sweater, put that on, throw my shirt in the trash. Porkplanet is screaming about how Bartender wouldn't serve her because she was fat. All of us (except Bartender) walk out of the pub and Porkplanet is still screaming some shit about “fat discrimination” and whatnot, and the bouncer says being fat is no excuse to shove someone, ever. Porkplanet takes a swing at the bouncer but misses and hits the brick wall behind him. She starts yowling in pain and my friends and I just stood there watching and laughing, but we also saw police lights at the end of the street. We power-walk out of there and just barely turn the corner when the cops roll up. We peek back around and see Porkplanet violently crying and still whaling about fat discrimination. I'm willing to bet she went on to become an avid poster on TiTP.

TL;DR Thin privilege is getting served drinks at the bar.

&gt; ask for her email, say i can probably get a 3xl shirt sorted if she wants

**Chapter Eighteen**

Impossible.

*Impossible*.

Lauren, though certainly not the smallest girl I had ever seen, was *tiny*. Not just in stature, but in figure, as well. She had once complained to me about needing to shop in the “Junior” section of clothing stores (though, I confess, I'd not had any idea what that meant). Imagining her as being overweight was not just difficult, it was... well, *unimaginable*.

I stood there, at a loss, as Lauren sobbed into her hand. 

Porcina kept her eyes averted. 

Aaron played his game.

“*Ergh*!” Lauren screamed, the sound muffled by her palm. “You... you *heartless*...” she faltered and sobbed again, gasping for air. “*Why*, Porcina? *Just tell me why*!”

In a tiny voice, Porcina answered: “I don't know.”

Whatever I had been expecting, it had certainly not been that.

No one said a word. The only sounds in the room came from a distant heater turning on, Lauren's labored breathing, and the clacking of the buttons on Aaron's game device. It was me who broke the silence as I shifted my feet.

“I think I should go.” I started towards the door, but Lauren grabbed my wrist and shook her head.

“Please,” was all she could manage to say. Moving slowly, gently, I released her grasp, then slid my fingers between hers. She gave them a weak squeeze, and I responded in kind.

“... I'm sorry.”

It hadn't been Lauren. It hadn't been me. It *certainly* hadn't been Aaron.

“What?” said Lauren, sniffling. She released my hand and wiped at each of her eyes. “Porcina?”

“I'm *sorry*...” The word came out with intensity, but there was no malice to be heard. Instead, it was as if Porcina's voice was reflecting an inner realization, a dawning understanding of something long ignored. She looked up at the two of us then, her eyes reddened with emotion. “I don't know what's wrong with me.”

Lauren's tears began anew, but not out of frustration or pain. She rushed to her friend's side. The two girls tightly embraced, both of them bawling, as they rocked back and forth on the couch and traded nearly incomprehensible (but heartfelt) apologies and forgiveness.

Aaron played his game.

Minutes passed.

Aaron played his game.

“*Comfort your girlfriend*!” I barked. Aaron jumped and – finally – looked up, staring at the space just above my shoulder.

“It's alright,” he said. ""You made me fart.”

Maybe it was Aaron's inappropriate response, or maybe everyone's minds had just reached their breaking points, but just like that, it actually seemed like everything *was* alright. It started out small, with a stifled snort from Lauren, and expanded until suddenly the room was filled with laughter. Lauren's bright and vibrant laugh, a low snigger from Aaron, even Porcina's merriment sounded completely genuine, thoroughly bereft of either ear-piercing guffaws or hissing. Everyone was laughing, and everyone seemed healed.

Everyone but me, that is. I thought it was weird.

Still, I smiled along with them, and joined the three on the already overcrowded couch, cuddling up behind Lauren and putting my hand on her shoulder.

“Promise me,” Lauren said, looking into Porcina's eyes. “*Promise* me you're going to get help. I'll drive you anywhere you need to go, I'll talk to your parents, but *promise* me you'll do it this time. No more putting it off. No more excuses. *Promise* me.”

“I promise,” said Porcina... and you know what? I believed her.

Another half an hour passed before it was finally decided that the party was a bust. It had, as Lauren pointed out, been a bit of a mistake to send out the invitations on the day of the engagement, especially considering the multitude of post-exam parties and voyages home that were no doubt already underway. The notice of entry was removed from the door, and replaced with a sign which read (in Lauren's handwriting), “That's all, folks! Have a safe vacation!”

Porcina's affected cuteness returned, but at least there was a small element of awareness to it. Even her suggestive jokes (of course she went back to them) seemed mostly forced, in what I suspected was an attempt to put the awkward memories of the evening (hell, the past few weeks) behind her.

“Let's all order *pizza*!” she exclaimed with anticipatory delight.

I started to protest – what was everyone's deal with pizza all the time, anyway – but Lauren stopped me. “You guys go ahead,” she said. “Enjoy your night together.” She took my hand and looked up at me. “We have a date.”

“*Oooooh*!” Porcina squealed. “Can we –”

“No!” said Lauren quickly. “Sorry, just... no. We're getting dinner – alone – and you guys are going to spend the night here.”

Porcina looked offended for a moment... but then offered a warm (if too-sweet) smile. “Okay, you kids have fun!” she said. “Be sure to use a condom!” Lauren and I both grimaced. “Get your own, though, *cuuuuuuuz*,” Porcina continued, snatching Aaron's hand, “we'll be *all out* when you get back!”

“We're gonna fuck,” Aaron stated. Just in case that wasn't clear.

Lauren wanted to take a few minutes to redo her makeup in her room, but she invited me in to join her. “If you don't mind, I mean,” she said.

“No, not at all,” I replied. “Not unless you're going to take your whole face off or something.”

“Here, I want to show you something.” Lauren walked across her (pristine) room, and opened a filing cabinet, drawing forth a large, thick book, bound in soft grey cloth. It turned out to be an album of photographs, kept secure behind sheets of thin plastic. “I heard you say 'impossible' when I said I used to be fat.""

“Did I say that out loud?”

“Yep.”

“Oh.”

“So,” Lauren continued, turning to a page near the middle of the book, “here's the proof.” Sure enough, a girl with Lauren's face stared back at me from atop a heavy body. She was still not as large as Porcina – pictured next to her, and also a bit smaller than I would have expected – but she was unquestionably overweight. “When my dad left,” she said, “my mom kind of lost it for awhile. That's her, there.” She pointed to a picture of diminutive woman with a vacant smile. I could see the family resemblance. “She's better now... but for a long time, all I ate was take-out and junk food. I was already losing weight when I met Porcina. I was still kind of pudgy until last year, though.”

“Well,” I said, unsure of how to respond, “you look great. Amazing, even.”

“Thanks!” She smiled and put the album away. “Just give me a minute. Then we can get going.”

Ten minutes later, we were following printed-out directions as we drove to the restaurant for our date. The rest of the night was everything that I had hoped for: We talked and laughed over dinner, sharing bites of each others' meals. Lauren treated me to dessert, citing a recent pay raise for her new responsibilities at work. Once we were finished and our bills were settled, we started up the nearby hill, stopping only briefly at my car while I changed my shoes and gathered our supplies. Bringing along the blanket proved to be a wise decision... though as we snuggled underneath it, I was sure that the warmth in my heart would be enough for both of us.

“I'm sorry about everything,” Lauren said at one point.

I shook my head. “Don't worry about it.” I kissed her then, a light yet lengthy peck. “Stuff might have gotten a bit crazy... but everything was worth it in the end.”

And it was. It really, truly was.

Hey people hey, I’m sorry for throwing yet another lengthy blob of words at you. I guess I’m a verbose person. The next part is a lot shorter though. 

&gt;Be me, college student by day and drag queen ~~by night~~ in my head

&gt;Somehow managed to survive the first month of college without running away to join the circus or being eaten by a certain unwelcome houseguest.

&gt;Monthly hormone fluctuations have combined with stress to give me a beautiful acne breakout on a day when I have a lunch date with the adorable dork from my mandatory “intro to college” class.

&gt;Fix problem in classic LadyDragQueen way: makeup and a smile.

&gt;""ESL, how do I look?""

&gt;""You look like fancy prostitute.""

&gt;[Activate confidence] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8p20hMt4Q1qgco7yo1_500.gif)

&gt;WingedDork and I have been out on a few date-esque things already.  He is about 5’10 and very thin (as I learn later, 135 pounds), effeminate, smart, and very adept at sewing.

&gt;He showed me a jacket he sewed himself with wings attached to the sleeves, I told him he would make a beautiful drag queen, and we were smitten.

&gt;Lunch starts out as usual. Talking and laughing our last few moments of peace away.

&gt;The doors burst open. Hot Cocoa Chanel returns to her natural habitat and begins pillaging the buffet.

&gt;Once her plates are screaming in pain and can't hold any more food, she scans the room for people. She apparently doesn't find anyone better because her eyes settle on us.

&gt;What did I do that was unchristian to deserve this?

&gt;""Hey, LadyDragQueen. Who's this?""

&gt;""This is WingedDork from my freshman seminar.”

&gt;""You're in my sewing elective; I've just never had a chance to talk to you. It's nice to finally meet you. Mind if I join you two?"" She is [clearly] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0iy7sduSk1rosb88o3_250.gif) enjoying the sight of a male who has been in her presence for an entire minute without running away screaming as she tramples his village.

&gt;""Well we're kind of on a date right now. I doubt you'd want to join!"" He laughs and abruptly stops when she actually settles down at the table.

&gt;""Oh no, I don't mind! So are you two going out?""

&gt;""We've gone on a few dates.""

&gt;""Bet you're waiting for her to put on a little weight before getting serious, huh? Only pedophiles like underdeveloped women who remind them of little girls.""

&gt;WingedDork is flabbergasted. ""We're getting to know each other. But I think she's beautiful as she is.""

&gt;""Look at her, she's all skin and bones. Men want something to grab onto. I could show you how a *real* woman feels.""

&gt;[HFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/1fc0512bad65162f444886c7c982baf2/tumblr_mhvdezRKok1rosb88o4_250.gif) she adds “You know, cushion for the pushin’.”

&gt;I'm pretty sure it would take all the king's horses and all the king's men to push her anywhere.

&gt;She gets huffy at his lack of interest. ""What, is it because I'm a little bigger?”

&gt;""I think it's rude to respond to obvious flirting when I'm on a date with someone who is not you.""

&gt;""You're making excuses for fat-hating. You know, not being attracted to big girls is discrimination. That's like saying you can't be attracted to black girls.""

&gt;""I'll admit that I’m not into obesity but that's because in most cases I've seen, very fat people have personality traits I dislike. It's usually about a lack of personal care and I can't respect that. It's absolutely nothing like being black.""

&gt;""And yet you're on a date with HER?! She has terrible hygiene but you overlook it because she's thin!""

I shower twice a day, I wash my hair often, I use soap, etc. I swear I'm not an unwashed curdled Myrtle.

&gt;""She has terrible acne and everyone knows that's caused by being dirty. If she took care of herself at all it wouldn't happen""

&gt;[MFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/eec0bc6a80e573470a84bb3fe90d194f/tumblr_mowre51PXa1rk8jx0o1_500.gif)

I'm not sure how having four pimples is defined as ""terrible acne” but I am not pleased at all that she'd throw shade in front of my date. I stare at the ground in an effort to keep my temper-bomb in check. WingedDork reads this as sadness and tries to help.

&gt;""I can’t even see anything.”

&gt;""She covers herself in makeup because she's insecure. It's understandable. Not everyone can be naturally beautiful."" she says while her tricep wings happily ripple along in agreement.

I've had enough. I don't appreciate anyone coming for how I look, especially when that person happens to be wearing shorts and a crop top with a peek of her gelatinous abdomen muffining out everywhere. You are messing with the wrong queen, mama.

&gt;""So you're implying that I have 100% control over acne but you aren't at all to blame for the extra 150  pounds of flesh suffocating your organs?""

&gt;""You have no right to talk to me like that you bitch! How *dare* you criticize another woman's body?""

&gt;""You have done nothing but criticize my body since I met you and **now** suddenly you have an issue discussing weight? If you want to talk weight, we can talk fucking weight and you won't like what I have to say.""

&gt;""You're attacking me out of your own insecurity so just go slather on more makeup until you can forget how ugly you are!""

&gt;""I wear makeup because I think it's beautiful, not because I feel ugly without it. My flaws are more fabulous than your best features and don't you forget it.""

&gt;Get up and take my leave with an agonized non-confrontational WingedDork tagging along behind.

Fast forward to evening. I have already bitched the ear off of everyone unfortunate enough to hang out in our suite following my confrontation with Cocoa. ESL, her boyfriend JRock, KaiKai, and WingedDork have convinced me that I need to talk to Cocoa so we can both apologize and move on. ESL's reasoning: ""Last time you two fight she eat all my snacks and I want to fill fridge tonight.""

&gt;Cocoa booms into the suite and begins rifling through the counter where we keep food.

&gt;""Hey Cocoa, I wanted to say that I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier.""

&gt;""I'm glad you've seen the errors in your thinking. I hope you’ve educated yourself to not be so hurtful about body image. I'll try to watch my own anger too. I'm sorry for calling you out in front of WingedDork.""

&gt;Hold the phone. I didn't say I was wrong. But I don't want to ruin our fragile truce, so I let it go.

&gt;""Good, glad that’s sorted out. Well, I'm going to the store with ESL and the guys. See you later!""

&gt;""WAIT I WANT TO GO TOO!""

&gt;""Cocoa it's a two mile walk round trip""

&gt;""Don't start this up again. I'm just as physically capable as you.""

&gt;I want to keep peace, but I also remember Cocoa's laborious exercise strolls. 

&gt;Whatever, it's her choice.

&gt;ESL, JRock, KaiKai, WingedDork, Cocoa and I set off towards Target.

&gt;Cocoa seems to be trying very hard to keep up with the group pace and not complain.

&gt;She attempts to flirt with JRock between her gasps for breath. 

&gt;ESL maintains eye contact in “gaze of death” setting until Cocoa backs down. 

&gt;Please teach me your magic ways.

&gt;Finally we arrive and do our shopping, Cocoa armed with a giant slushie from the in-store McDeath to ""refresh"" her for the walk back.

&gt;We all buy a few supplies and snacks for our rooms. At checkout, Cocoa has seven bags, primarily boxed food items.

&gt;We barely start walking back when Cocoa suggests we get a cab because she’s tired.

&gt;[OFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/d67cc4f41defb9b37c15bd28ddaaeff3/tumblr_mpacmeeeig1ssd38uo2_500.gif) no one is in the mood for this.

&gt;Bitch it is a Friday night and we're right by the tourist area, a cab is going to cost a lot and take forever to make their way over to us. All nearby ones will be waiting outside hotels.

&gt;Me: ""No Cocoa, it's expensive and there won't be enough room for all of us and our stuff anyway. We don't want to leave anyone walking alone and we don’t want to wait around on the street.""

The school is in a seriously shady area. Safety in numbers is a necessity. Even a group of two or three at night is a bad idea. 

&gt;Cocoa starts bawling tears of butter

&gt;""BUT WALKING THIS FAR IS BAD FOR MY BODY AND I CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS STUFF BACK""

&gt;We are [not amused] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/2b9d8027d3a6f202d66c907fadc0efd2/tumblr_mjo5g92rDW1rosb88o6_250.gif) and her tears are not persuading anyone.

&gt;The guys take some bags from her and try to convince her to walk with us. We don't want to leave her here alone but we sure as hell aren't waiting ages just for the privilege of paying an overpriced cab fare.

&gt;Cocoa: ""You are really hurting my feelings and not understanding my needs! People aren't made to walk this far!""

&gt;ESL: ""You think people in ancient history never go more than one mile from home?""

&gt;Cocoa starts crying harder. ""This is so mean! You're all incapable of empathy and can't think about how anyone who isn't stick thin feels. My knees ache!""

&gt;Wait wasn't she just as physically capable as us only an hour ago?

&gt;Even KaiKai can't stand by this one. ""Okay Cocoa, how about we walk you back to Target and you wait inside for a cab while we walk home.""

&gt;Cocoa: ""You too? You're *abandoning* me on the streets at night?""

&gt;ESL: ""No, we taking you back to store. If you want be abandoned we keep going and you walk back to store alone.""

&gt;""This is so insensitive."" Cocoa grumbles but turns around and we go back the short ways we came. We take her inside the store and start to leave when she stops us yet again.

&gt;""Hey since you are walking back and don't have to worry about cab room, can you carry the rest of these bags back with you too?^teehee""

&gt;ESL point blank refuses, but KaiKai and I are pushovers and take the last couple bags before leaving.

As predicted, it took her about ninety minutes and a pretty penny to get home. The great news is that she refused to speak to any of us for four days and even stayed in her own room for that time. Unfortunately she eventually forgave us and graced our suite with her presence once more.

TL;DR: Cocoa criticizes everything about me in an attempt to flirt with a guy I've been seeing, insists on coming to the store with us, and gets stranded by her refusal to exert energy to move her body.

This is another installment from my grocery store days. This one is pretty short, but buckle up dem jimmies or else they might go into orbit.

Be me, 17, hating life because grocery store work sucks and I'd rather be out with friends. Ohwellitsapaycheck.fml Be bagging groceries like a baus trying to make a good impression on the new boss as it was his first day in this particular store when a petite old lady (who we'll call Nice Lady, NL for short) comes through my line with some heavy stuff in her cart. Before I can offer to lift it for her, she calls to her daughter to help her. I look over to see this huge mass of woman (taller than me, I'd guess about 5'11”, and easily 350lbs) sitting in a chair near the service desk drinking a bucket of diet beetus. We're gonna call her Megabitch. Megabitch immediately begins yelling at *me* for not helping her mom with the lifting, saying it's my job to help her and it's not fair that she has to get up and help because she's not getting paid to do it. [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m248ezCZgT1qexd10.gif) this asshole won't help her mother out. I tell NL that I have no problem lifting her items for her, it's my job and I'm used to it, it's no problem for me at all.

NL: “Oh no, I want my daughter to do it. Lord knows she needs the exercise. I know you get paid to do it, but if my daughter wants to eat, she can do it.”

I have to fight the giggle fit that's trying to surface; I don't want to have to deal with Megabitch anymore than I've already had to. NL calls to her daughter again, telling her to get up and help. Megabitch absolutely refuses to get out of the chair and help. I lift the items for NL so the cashier can ring them up and I put them back in the cart. Megabitch is now screaming for the head manager of the store. Bossman comes up front and Megabitch launches into this whole tirade about how I absolutely refused to help her mom and that I was making fun of her for being fat and that I shouldn't be working in customer service if I didn't know how to treat customers properly. [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/N4VfNpR.jpg) the new boss has someone bitching about me his first day at this store. Megabitch proceeds to go on about how she has some medical condition and can't stand for too long or lift anything heavy. NL just rolls her eyes and I offer her help to her car. Megabitch gets right up in my face and yells “I WILL HELP MY MOTHER OUT!” Yeahokay.gif I tell NL to have a good day and turn to walk back to the register I was at. BUT OH NO IT WASN'T OVER.

Megabitch follows me over to the register continuing to scream at me, at which point I am getting extremely pissed off. My shoulders tense, my fists clench, and I turn around to shoot eye daggers at this behemoth. Before I can say anything, my boss cuts in.

Boss: “Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to leave my store. Not only can I not let you harass my employee, I cannot let you harass a minor. So unless you want me to call the police and have them deal with you, please leave the store.”

The look on Megabitch's face when she found out I was a minor was absolutely priceless. Her jaw was on the floor, and she just stood there for a solid minute looking like someone had kicked her in the teeth. She huffed and puffed on her way out of the store and NL shot me an apologetic smile. Boss let me sit in the office for a while to drink some coffee and calm down, and he told me “Don't worry about her. I've been in this business 20 years, I know that woman is craaaaaazy.”

I don't even know what made me more mad, her continued verbal assault or the fact the she couldn't get off her fat lazy fucking ass and help her elderly mother.

TL;DR Don't fuck with grocery store workers, we tend to be angrier than the average citizen.

And so my dears we come to part VI. And yes at this point it's my favourite stories of [Beetus's](http://i.imgur.com/904WVyh.jpg) epic dickery.

And we move onto a personal favourite of mine. I am a LARPer. Yes. That means I Live Action Roleplay. But whatever misconceptions you have, leave them at the door. The LARPs I attend, you are fully immersed with a high costume standard in a fantasy world, and it's very active. Imagine being in a play, and you can't break character, but it's unscripted, and you're in a field of varying degrees of lake-like status, and you're running around. Oh yes, and there's fighting, wouldn't be a good event without some murder happening. There's no dice involved, there's no flangey bullshit, it's basically down to how well can you beat the other fucker into submission. The word ACTION is in there for a reasion right. And we don't have crappy sweatpants costumes either. [This](http://www.flickr.com/photos/clareselley/sets/72157634014453596/) will give you an idea of what kind of costume standard we have to meet. Also our weapons are realistic looking foam over fiberglass and kevlar inner cores, and can actually fucking hurt you. But I digress.

This FPS occurs in late May, approximately 5-6 weeks after Beetus moved in with us. It occurs at a system which keeps track of armour etc with a system called ['lammies'](http://i.imgur.com/J9mXFIg.jpg) because they are little red tags that are laminated. There were all sorts of swords and shields and armour and potions and whummy jewellery and stuff with powers and special abilities in the game that you could make, find, buy, sell.  The group I was playing with was called 'The Ginger Kitties as slang, because we played a race of feline humanoids, and we opted to go as Bengal tigers, and play the Middle Eastern feline culture. Because we are fucking badass. Our group was lead by a guy named  Raki, and he was a dude. Spouse-a-tron and Carguy are also in this one along with Gravedigger, who is another friend of ours. They are all Ginger Kitties, playing Raki's nephews. I was playing Raki's daughter, the irritatingly airheaded Laila.

&gt;be looking all sweet and innocent.

There were four in game currencies. TL;DR I had a lot saved up.

&gt;Be May,

&gt;Be in first aid tent already at least once this event and got told ""No full body paint, No full face mask, keep airways unobstructed, keep yourself cool.

&gt;Snazz bodypaint makes you sweat like a motherfucker.

&gt;In Game excuse for nothing but cat nose is ""The whores in the whorehouse told me a great way to beat the heat was to shave your kitty""

&gt;fuggin love this game

Moving on. Beetus had gained permission from Raki to join the group, and rolled in as one of the endless cousins/nephews in the group. Raki gave him a bunch of lammies for armour, protective amulets, special robes, and weapons. The lammies get attached to items so you can show that your armour has so many hits, or makes you immune to certain effects. All good.

After a while, it's warm, I tell Spouse-a-tron that I'm OC (out of character) feeling dizzy and ill, and that I'm going to the tea house to get some cool tea and sit in the shade with a fan. Car Guy and Gravedigger (who are like brothers to me) offer to come with to be ""[Boss's daughter's protective Guard](http://i.imgur.com/wepcjZT.jpg)"".

&gt;Fine by me

&gt;Instant entourage

&gt;damnstraight.skippy

&gt;Beetus follows along because he has no motivation to do anything on his own.

At the teahouse, I settle myself in with ice cold tea and a brownie to get some blood sugar, and something cool. Offer to Spouse-a-tron, CarGuy and Gravedigger. CG and Gravedigger decline, say they're going to patrol someone's camp. Teahouse btw, is run on In Game money. So I pay for it with my hard earned gains, pay for Spouse-a-tron too, because he's being awesome and keeping me company while I'm feeling ill.

&gt;Imnotahugebitchhonest.guv

&gt;Ok

Spouse-a-tron shares my ice tea and gets a small piece of cake.

&gt;watchin dat fine ass.

&gt;mm mmm.motherfucker

Beetus arrives, winded and out of breath, it took him 5 minutes to catch up. Beetus sees us eating snacks and starts complaining that the GOD crew (the people running the game) didn't give him his starting money when he picked up his player pack.

&gt;Boo fucking hoo, they didn't have mine done, and all you had to do is ask.

Beetus doesn't want to walk all the way over to the GOD tent. (it's on the edge of the In Character Field. no more than 150 feet away)

&gt;lazy as fuck.

Without even asking if I could comp him some cake or tea and pay me back later, he starts ordering a bunch of stuff and charges it to me.

&gt;HELL NAW.

&gt;HOLDMYGLOVES.jpeg

&gt;Handbags@dawn.com

His order is FIVE TIMES the cost of mine and Spouse-a-tron (One Lrg pot Ice tea, one brownie, one cake).

&gt;My order would just about use up the In Game money Beetus has.

&gt;Beetus's order is five times that and he doesn't have that money.

I am about to say something when I start feeling faint again, and Spouse-a-tron tells me to calm down, he'll make sure Beetus pays me back.

Beetus sees me about to say something but get stopped and starts muttering stuff like **""Yeah, IT'S NOT FAIR THAT YOU BUY *HIM* FOOD BUT YOU LET ME STARVE. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH ASTHMA, I HAVE *KUNDISHUNZ* TOO. GOOD THING YOU LISTEN TO YOUR MAN, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TAKE THAT SHIT FROM A GIRLFRIEND.""**

&gt;Ohthatsright, Beetus, didn't you date an underage lass for a while, who left you because when you eventually did convince her to have sex, she was so repulsed by the smell and Mysogeny that she went ""fuckthisnoise""?

Just then dancer lady walks in and is selling tickets to the Burlesque show they always put on in the Whorehouse.

&gt;IC whorehouse has no actual sex, just backrubs and an awful lot of goofing around while making fake sex noises. Must be 18 or older to enter etc.

&gt;Burlesque show is pretty ladies in corsets singing and dancing, and occasionally stripping down to bra and underpants.

&gt;I'veseenworseondisneychannel.mkv

Spouse-a-tron knows a lot of the women in the show, is good friends, hasn't seen them in forever. I buy him VIP ticket.

Beetus pipes up, ""**MAKE THAT TWO**""

""Uh, Beetus, I don't really have enough for two tickets, and it's an OC gift for Spouse-a-tron.""

**""DON'T LIE, I SAW YOUR COINPURSE, YOU HAVE WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH.""**

""Beetus, that'y my budget for tea for the weekend, to stop me from passing out. Also, Spouse-a-tron and I have an Out of Character date at the stir fry restaurant and I have to pay that, I'm sorry I can't spare anything for you. If you want a ticket, go get some money from Raki, CG or Gravedigger, or get your money from GOD.""

**""YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF ABOVE OTHER PEOPLE, HOW SELFISH AND BULLSHITTY IS THAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.""**

Spouse-a-tron says just get the ticket, he'll get some money from Raki to pay me back.

&gt;Raki and the Ginger Kitties were an economic trade group in the game, they were wealthy as shit, and each game we got a huge ""entertainment"" budget to go arse about with at the bars, whorehouse, etc. We hadn't collected our monies yet because Raki was doing diplomancy.

Ok fine. I buy the ticket. Beetus keeps bitching but waltzes off.

After the Burlesque show, nobody saw Beetus for over a day. (This was the Friday evening, of a 3 day event. Sunday afternoon, Beetus appears barely in kit. We are about to muster for battle, so we're all putting on armour and getting armed. Raki asks why Beetus doesn't have his armour on and why none of his shit has the appropriate lammies attached.

Finally Beetus admits he lost the lammies. Raki is pissed, because it's minutes before a big fucking battle, and he's lost a small fortune (In Game Money) of stuff. Stuff that wasn't cheap. Raki pulls strings, and calls in a LOT of favours to replace as much of it as possible ASAP. We go off to battle, Beetus ""gets bored"" halfway through and disappears again. We don't find him until the event is over and we're packing up. We find out Beetus has spent the entire event in the Out of Character camping field, just sitting and talking to some vague buddy of his and drinking their beer. He missed out on a bunch of really important roleplay and game stuff, and kind of made Raki lose face in game as a head of a faction.

Due to CarGuy picking up his TinyGirlfriend, and her having some REALLY extreme motion sickness, Beetus, Spouse-a-tron and I ended up squeezed in the back seat of Carguy's old car for the 7 hour drive home. The car actually groaned and leaned off to one side on the rear axle because of Beetus's weight. It was then we discovered that Beetus hadn't showered the entire week on that field. Nor had he brushed his teeth.

&gt;The event has fully operational hot water showers and toilets with running water.

Beetus smells like roadkill, and for seven hours I had to try not to puke out the window. He spent ALL seven hours complaining about how I was a stingy unfeeling bitch all weekend.

&gt;Because having two asthma attacks, fainting three times from heat and coming close to hospitalisation and intubation would put most people in a GREAT mood.

Beetus complains about all the money he lent me so I wouldn't die, Car Guy and Spouse-a-tron kept correcting him, which only made him protest more. He started taking pictures of me asleep in the car posting them to facebook tagged as ""chesZilla looks like shit, kind of like how we all feel.""

When we got home, I took all his lammies off his weapons and armour and amulets so that at Event 3, Raki found he'd ""lost"" them ""in his room"" and refused to get him more, and frog marched him into battle without them.

**TL;DR**

Only Beetus is allowed to have a medical condition and forces me to pay for a bunch of shit for him at a LARP event.


Oh, Car Guy refused to give him a lift for the next few events too. The car's smell never recovered."	t5_2vzax	True

Bus was in the same condition as always; smelling of pee and faeces... *again.*

&gt;Got on bus, 10/10 again

&gt;One seat available

&gt;why the hell not

&gt;start dozing off

At this point people to my left start disembarking, leaving two seats vacant beside me. I should have known...*I should have...* 

&gt;I smelled it before I saw it, rousing me from my slouch

&gt;My first thought was ""Haha, no seat for you this time...""

&gt;Seats next to me vacant

It begins a trundle that shakes the frame of the bus. The whole bus shook, and that was it shaking above the normal vibration of a diesel engine. I'm pretty sure the floor was bent under it's weight.

&gt;sits it's mass down near me

&gt;spills over it's trousers

&gt;ha, trousers, enough fabric there to clothe half of india

&gt;there is a fold of fat ~~resting~~ crushing my leg at the thigh

&gt;I do the whole keep calm and carry on

&gt;it starts sweating profusely

&gt;my trouserleg is actually soaked because of the sweat

&gt;just nope

&gt;ask it to move over ever so slightly

&gt;""Get fucked you fat sack of shit, that's assuming anyone could find a fucking hole or cock underneath those mounds of fat. You are fucking fat, you are physically taking up two seats and part of my leg""

Store doesn't matter, just like every other 'Mart. I'm about 5'4 130ish lbs female and not in shape at all, but not huge tub of lard, either. My line of work leads me to be abused by fatties on nearly a daily basis because they are too fucking lazy to walk around and do their own damn shopping.

This evening was a special one, though.
&gt; Working my 6 hour shift like a boss

&gt; Smiling, manners, all that shit

&gt; Large landwhale waddles up to my register

&gt; Approximately 5'0 300+ lbs, almost as wide as she is tall

&gt; Ask her all the fifty billion normal questions expected of a cashier

&gt; ""AH DON'T WANT ANY A'THAT. STOP ASKIN' AH CAN'T STAND MUCH LONGER.""

&gt; Yes, ma'am, sorry ma'am. Suck my dick you fat cow.

&gt; The entire transaction she's sweating like she's run a marathon

&gt; Starts berating me for being so slow ringing up the entire candy aisle that she brought with her to the register

&gt; Yes, ma'am, sorry ma'am. Should be a professional poker player with this face.

&gt; Gloriously the transaction finally ends! Fireworks and fanfare like a motherfucker!

&gt; Glance around counter. No where to be seen. ""I didn't see you take them out during the transaction, ma'am. Perhaps you left them in another store?""

&gt; At this point, this horrendous bitch of a woman starts yelling at ME for losing her keys.

&gt; Yes. I stole your keys and I'm hiding them from you so you have to walk home with your candy.

&gt; Spends TEN MINUTES telling me what a horrible person I am

&gt; Starts slipping into that dangerous fatlogic zone

&gt; ""AH SAW YOU JUDGIN' ME FER WHAT I EAT. NOT ALL OF US WAS MEANT TO BE SKINNY BITCHES LAHKE YEW!""

&gt; I mean, compared to her I guess I'm tiny, but who isn't?

&gt; After spewing hatred and saliva all over my counter, she demands I call EVERY STORE THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO THAT DAY.

&gt; After yelling at me for ten minutes. Wanted me to assist her.

&gt; Haha, that's cuuuute. Go fuck yourself.

&gt; Apologize, tell her phonebook had been misplaced for weeks and that she would have to walk back and revisit the previous stores she had been to.

&gt; Dat sympathetic tone.

&gt; ""AH HAVE BAD KNEES. YEW WOULDN'T UNNERSTAN'! I CAN'T JUST BE WALKIN' ERRYWHAR!""

&gt; Sympathize again, make sad face for her ""condition""

My manager (super cool down to earth amazing manager who isn't exactly a tiny woman herself, but not a huge fatty either) came up later that evening and I told her the tale of this hideous woman.

&gt; M: ""Why didn't you offer her one of our motorized scooters?""

&gt; Me: ""After she yelled at me for ten minutes about her keys? She can walk. Lord knows she needs the exercise.""

&gt; Manager laughs, ""She probably ate her keys and forgot about it. You know if I get a complaint call on this, I won't be able to stop laughing, right?""

&gt; Me: ""Just ask her if she ate her keys, I'm sure that'll go over well.""

I have more stories, some about coworkers, some about customers. This one was just fresh in mind since it just happened this evening. I'll post some more when I get around to it.

1375775825.0	1jsskm	It's sooooo much harder to be fat than it is to be severely mentally and physically disabled because thin privilege!!!	vampire-weekday	434	78	91	"Okay, so just to warn you all I'm probably not going to greentext and this might be a little rant-y because I'm full of rage right now. If you've read some of my previous posts about my job at a high-end athletic retailer, or if you've ever worked in retail yourself, you'll know that I've dealt with some shit that's rustled my jimmies. What happened today goes beyond that... SO far beyond.  

A little necessary background (sorry): there's a young woman, M, who shops at our store very frequently. She's very severely disabled, and it's quite obvious to anyone looking: she's in a motorized wheelchair, communicates through a tablet, and often has trouble controlling muscle movements, drooling, etc. While helping her can be a little intimidating at first, she's in our store enough that we've all come to know and love her and, more importantly, understand what she needs. She loves our products and is a total regular here; her mom usually brings her here and lets her shop on her own for a bit, so she can feel more independent. She usually comes on Monday mornings when it's not busy because being around crowds is stressful for her. Luckily, everything's largely been positive for her; nobody has been outright rude, and she's come to think of lots of the salespeople as friends. She and her mom bake us cookies every so often and bring cards at holidays. tl;dr they're really sweet people and we adore them.  

Anyway, M came in today and I was helping her browse around. There were a few other people in the store, and while it was only me and my coworker (who was on the phone with another location) nobody seemed to need any urgent help. I'd greeted everyone and everything was going fine. M had picked out a headband and we were just about to go over to the cash registers when I heard someone clear their throat behind me.  

I turned around to find a hamplanet staring us down and looking furious. ""I may not be thin like *that*,"" she said, gesturing to M, ""but I'm a customer too. Stop ignoring me and help me."" Not wanting to start a fight around M, who was already seeming a bit nervous about being confronted by a stranger, I opted for a beta response.  

""Sorry, ma'am, just let me get her checked out and I'll be right with you."" I tried to quickly leave with M, but the hamplanet stopped me.  

""Should she even *be* in here? She looks contagious,"" the whale said snidely. Now, M often wears a face mask because she has a weak immune system. Today, unfortunately, she was wearing one. The hamplanet literally *pokes* her face mask, not stoping to think for one second that touching any stranger, let alone someone who is clearly suffering from some sort of mental disability, is totally fucking wrong. M starts freaking out, which for her means flailing and moaning and crying. Now, I'll admit that this can be intimidating if you're not used to dealing with her/other special needs people, but the hamplanet, of course, reacted in the most insensitive way possible.  

Instead of recognizing that she had caused this, and that a disabled girl in a wheelchair *probably* wasn't a huge threat, she started screeching about how M was ""attacking"" her and it wasn't fair to the other shoppers that we allowed her in our store. At this point, my coworker quickly gets himself off the phone and leads the hamplanet away, trying to scold her and get her to leave in between her complaints about the ""attack"" and how she just ""really needed help"" and that I was discriminating against her because I ""didn't want to sell to a fat person.""  

I tried to console M, who was now really, really upset. Even though she's pretty severely affected by her disability, she can still understand a lot of what people say, and she's very self-conscious about her appearance and her condition. She was pretty much inconsolable at this point, so I called her mom who had luckily given us her phone number. She came over quickly and left with M. We gave her the headband she'd wanted for free because omg. :(  

After they left, the hamplanet came over and told me it was ""about time I dealt with the problem."" Deciding I was going to be more alpha this time, I told her that she *was* the problem. She then proceeded to tell me she wouldn't apologize for standing up for herself as a fat woman, and that she wouldn't ever spend her money in our store. This probably would have been more effective had we not already told her to leave.  

Oh, and in case you were wondering what she so desperately needed help with, my coworker filled me in. She wanted to know if our water bottles could go in the dishwasher. Information that's readily available online.  

tl;dr Hamplanet comes in to store, sends disabled girl into a panic by yelling and touching her, says she was justified because fat."	t5_2vzax	True
1372130421.0	1h0jl7	Tales From A Former Lardguard: Tsunami Warning	plasticdinosaurs	407	54	54	"Hi Reddit!  Long time listener, first time caller.  Found this subreddit, fell in love like a hammie at the Heart Attack Café, and, inspired by other posts from fellow/former ~~lifeguards~~ lardguards, decided to share my stories.

**Background**

As for me I’m average-ish.  Definitely not a “skinny bitch” but not a planet either.  5’6” about 145, and am working on getting back into better/healthier lifestyle (eff you grad school!).  The water park in which I worked was part of a hotel in the city center.  Part of the water park complex is occupied by a set of waterslides.  One of these slides is a tube slide, allowing the rider to shoot themselves down in the dark.  It was pretty fast, and can definitely catch someone by surprise.

**The Story**

On one particularly busy Saturday night, I’m chilling in the slide plunge (where all the slides spit out their riders).  This was usually my favorite place to guard, because the work mostly consisted of preventing the occasional stray kid who tried to cut across to the ladders or slides, or help a kid who got caught in the flume’s current.  I’m floating around, occasionally busting the kids trying to be Usain Bolt in their haste to reach the slides, when, suddenly, I feel the water become a lot choppier than usual.  Lights flicker.  The sound of a whale being dropped into the ocean from 50 feet above comes from behind me.  A 350+ hamplanet is attempting to cut through the plunge (nope) to get to the slides with her mini-moon, who is clearly too short to ride (double nope).

I glide over to her.  “Excuse me Ma’am!  I’m really sorry, but you can’t cut through here.  People shoot out of these slides and can hit you.  You’ll have to exit and walk around the back.” “FUCK NAW I AINT WALKIN.  AH GOTS UH CONDISHUUUUN WITH MAH KNEES!  AH GOTS TO STAY IN THE WATER!” “Ma’am, I’m sorry, this is our poli-“ “FUCK YOU SKINNY BITCH!  AH DONT HAVE TUH LISTEN TUH YUH!  Y’ALLS CAN KEEEESS MAH ASS!  AH AM A PAYIN CUSTOMER!  Y’ALL DISHCRIMUNATIN GAINST WIMMIN LIKE MUH!”

[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/loss_for_words.gif).  Although trying to explain that EVERYONE using the park was a paying customer and they had no problem walking the short distance around, there was little I could do to stop the mass of lard waddling through, so I watched her exert herself more than she has ever done for a non-eating event, while climbing the whopping 25 stairs to the slide.

Now at the top, I can see the attendant clearly refusing to let mini-moon ride on the slide, including measuring the satellite not once, not twice, but three times, as the hamplanet grows redder and redder at the CLEAR discrimination against her precious.  This will obviously not stand, as I see the planet ride the struggle bus in attempting to lower herself in to the slide entrance, and grab the mini-moon so they can ride double (triple nope).

At this point, the attendant is trying to grab the kid out of the entrance while the mini-moon is enveloped in the mixture of flab and chlorine that was hamplanet's lap.  With a beastly bellow of “Y’ALL CANT TELL MUH WAHT TO DO HURR.  AH PAID GUD MONEY FOR DIS!” she places two chubby paws on the mini-moon’s back and shoves him down the slide.  Oh fuck.  I rush to the slide’s exit just in time to see mini-moon plop in and start sucking in gallons of the chlorine-filled water as if it were the last ~~Diet~~ Coke on Earth.  I quickly pull him up for breath, and assure him that he’s ok.

And then I hear it.  The unmistakable creaking of plastic and the screeching of skin upon said plastic.  I look up to the attendant, [HFW](http://www.arwrath.com/content/1/102730.gif).  I look to the slide exit, which is no longer spitting out water.  I realize what is coming, and start to mount a retreat that would’ve made those at Dunkerque proud.  However, I am too late.  The hamplanet, due to the immense amount of water built up behind her “curvy” frame, shoots out of the tube slide like a human cannonball and hits the water with what I can only assume was atomic force.  [I turn to see a wall of water rising toward me](http://i1.wp.com/i3.photobucket.com/albums/y88/xxAgainstTheRest/ONTD/omggggggg.gif?fit=1000%2C1000).  Realizing that there is no escaping from this, I turn my back and let the wave engulf my body.
  
As I emerge from the human-powered tsunami, mini-moon promptly turns toward me, [spews an ungodly amount of rainbow-colored water onto my chest](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m87mtouNE21rtdh0ao1_400.gif), as hamplanet exclaims “THAT THAR WUZ FUUUN!”  Mini-moon, now free of pool water and pounds of colored candy, begs Momma to go again.  I turn to them both and, in a very icy tone, state that mini-moon is not allowed on the slides because he cannot swim or stand in the plunge area.  Hamplanet is having none of this.  “WELL THATS WHY YOURE HERE HARR HARR HARR!”

I quickly signal to close the pool for cleaning.

**tl;dr: Hamplanet refuses to obey waterpark rules.  ~~Lifeguard~~ Lardguard pays ultimate price.**

1371317113.0	1gepbz	Just a few more stories from the themepark	ledhead423	426	74	43	"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fu7oa/disabled_guy_vs_disabled_guy_at_a_theme_park/) the other day and it garnered a lot of attention. While this is by far the most intense encounter I've ever had with a fatty at my job, there are still some awesome runner-ups. Sometimes I think my theme park is a magnet for crazy people.
 

* **the one who ran over my friends foot and broke that shit**
this is another electric wheelchair one. I promise this one is short though. This girl I work with (not big at all) had her foot ran over by a porkplanet and the bone was crushed so badly that she needed reconstructive surgery for it. Luckily we work for a great company and they paid for the medical bills. My friend said that all the person on the electric wheelchair had to say was 'you deserve it. I'm disabled, you need to get out of my way.'

* **the one who 'almost died'**
around october we have a celebratory party featuring the main character of our park. we don't let the party guests in until seven o clock so we have time to get the day guests out. I'm waiting up front to help escort the mass exodus of guests in when I feel my arm being pulled on by what can only be described as the death grip of jabba-the-hutt. 

""I need a wheelchair. I have a condition that requires me to be sitting.""

This woman is roughly 350 lbs. Like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-10207-body-shape.htm?StartAt=1#.Ubyibvm1GvM) but a little older. I say ok, because I've learned my lesson about arguing with 'disabled' folks, and I go grab her a wheelchair. When I return, she looks at me like I have three heads.

""no, sweetie. It needs to be an electric one. and I'm going to need some snacks as well.""

Luckily my manager is nearby and she is explains that the electric ones cost $100 to rent and we are not permitted to give them away for free. The woman starts screaming at her about her condition and how she's 'going to die without that electric wheelchair' and I have to excuse myself to the break room so I can laugh my ass off.

* **the one who got stuck in a roller coaster**
I didn't actually see this one, but on the shuttle back to the parking lot, there were several firefighters conversing about how they had to use the jaws of life to pry a woman out of her seat on a rollercoaster, as she had managed to wedge herself in somehow. They said that the whole time they were doing their thing, trying to get her out, she was loudly complaining about how '(themepark) hates curvy women' and how the girl working had 'probably intentionally asked her to sit in that seat, knowing she'd get stuck because she's jealous of her curves'.

* **the 'pregnant' porkplanet**
I was pregnant during my time at the park. Contrary to what a lot of women say, I found my pregnancy to be very easy and other than feeling random kicks near my abdomen, I used to forget I was pregnant at times. One day, working audience control again, a hamplanet runs up to me (we were ten feet apart and it probably took him 5 minutes). 

This guy sounds like he's doing a bad impression of George Costanza. ""HELP!! MY WIFE IS PREGNANT AND SHE NEEDS A WHEELCHAIR!! SHE CANT WALK!!""

So of course, my first reaction to this is to ask if she's in labor.

""NO!! SHE JUST CANT WALK!! LOOK AT HER!!!"" He motions over to a severely obese woman lying down on the ground near a wall. Maybe it was my pregnant hormones, maybe I was just sick of my job, or maybe I just wanted to make a statement, but I said something very nasty.

""Sure, I'll go get her one, but be advised, I'm pregnant myself, so it will probably take me a few minutes to get to the place where we store the extra-large wheelchairs.""

Dude turns bright red. 

""Don't worry sir! I'll be right back!""

I purposely take a really long time. I grab some water, catch up with coworkers, and then head over to the front of the park to get the biggest  wheelchair they offer. I half expected them to be gone by the time I showed up but they were there, anxiously awaiting their wheelchair that will magically make everything better.

OO: We are allowed to eat these right?

Me: Absolutely not! This is a microbiology lab, you could get a serious illness or die if they are infected? Also, all the students need to dissect those berries too....

OO: Oh, ok. Well, I already touched these so I'll finish them.

Me: No you won't, that is highly dangerous and not allowed.

OO: *flustered, pouty face**

Seriously though, this kind of behavior is really dangerous, and if someone saw that happening the department could be charged with a $10,000 fine.

I can't believe he actually had the balls to ask me that during the test.

A lot of them were old and mean and treated the workers like dirt.  People would steal our ketchup bottles and malt vinegar (ughhh the smell...) all the time.

We include a side order of ""crumbs"" which is just left over pieces of fried batter that are sitting around in the fryer for free.

1364199449.0	1ayph5	EX-Body Acceptance Ally, Now have PhD in Fatlogic (KINDA LONG)	Girlsontheinternet	390	40	48	"I used to be one of those girls that genuinely believed the fatlogic that I was born to be thin (despite my family being entirely fats) and my hammy friends were born to be fat. Until that is, 3rd year of highschool. 

We had gym which I took (hated it because the other girls were mostly mean and didn't pass the fucking ball when I catch fresher than a motherfucker) but 3rd year was special... You get weightroom. So me, 5 of my hammladies, and about 20 men were in this class that mostly involved gym equipment and occasionally had shit like 12 minute runs. 

The first few weeks the teacher let us do our own thing (groups were optional) so I started lifting like I WASN'T 110lbs, and really pushed myself. I went from being flimsy to being reasonably strong within like 2 months and I felt fucking AMAZING. I was also insecure before this, but my awesome increase in fitness made the guys in the class LOVE ME. I'd have many options for spotters and a lot of dudes helped me on proper squat form and shit. Some flirting, but all around being excellent to eachother.

Somewhere around the second month, the teacher was all ""You can't go alone anymore because its not motivating"". I'm a self-motivated sort, so I was upset and all but you know, such is life. I quickly remembered my hammies and made my way to partner up. During my bulkphase I totally failed to notice what the fuck they were doing; I vaguely saw cardio shit and no lifts ever. I assume that the fats tried and good enough.

I was fucking wrong. Within a week of being partnered up with a fat, I noticed what genetic fatness looks like.

- Genetic fatness has McDonalds in the changeroom. 

- Genetic fatness drinks a gatorade after ONLY stretching the entire sesh.

- Genetic fatness sits on the bikes and talks to the other fats, not even pedalling. During pedalling, remember to only go 1 rotation a minute on the easiest setting.

Eventually my hams just sat on the mats talking. Any effort on my part would involve my partners protesting when I said we should go do weights, or flat out insulting my efforts as ""unhealthy eating disorder shit"" and that ""I don't need to lose weight"". Excuse me bitch, lifting helped me GAIN weight. 

These girls used to try to tell me that they do daily runs but they couldn't even keep up with me and I am possibly the worst runner on this planet. I am seriously on asthma level of running. I am pathetic. But I went from lvl.3 to lvl.7 in the beep test (pathetic but you know, improvements) while these bitches gave every excuse from busted knees to period cramps to avoid it.

Two weeks of this and I just joined one of the males. Saw the girls for the rest of the course, watching the dudes exercise. Faces resembling Victorian orphans staring at a feast when looking at the dudes sweat, talking about how hot the dudes must find them. Dudes too focused on working out to notice hungry hungry hippos.

Cue end of year.

&gt; be 15, fresh out of junior high, can finally take art class without giving up band

&gt; good artist, want more practice/criticism

&gt; been working on this a long time, be lonely. Best friend moved out of state a couple of years ago, haven't found a replacement yet.

&gt; be stalked by best friend's stalker. He wants her deets, which she made me swear not to give him. He hates me for it, and harasses me for them whenever possible.

&gt; this kid is about 5'5, tipping the scale at 300lbs. He is enormous, the same shape and complexion as a Butterball Turkey. Permafrown on his face, his jowls are weighing his cheeks down.

&gt; is convinced that I turned best friend against him, that we both hate him only because he's fat

&gt; in driver's ed, talking to friend trying to describe character from a book to her, decide to draw it instead of busting her brain anymore

&gt; also be a total showoff

&gt; sickass drawing, Death of Rats avatar with a host of ghostly rats groveling at his feet

&gt; nonchalantly toss doodle in trash when class is over, I don't need it anymore

&gt; ""Whoa, you're throwing that away?"" my friend says.

&gt; I can draw it again, don't need more junk in my trapper keeper, I just shrug. Whatever.

&gt; go to art class after lunch, good mood from good food

&gt; cafeteriapizza.mmm

&gt; see kids clustered around Butterball at his space, he's got crayons and he's coloring something

&gt; one girl says, ""I can't believe you drew that,""

&gt; wtf, is he drawing dicks again? Oh well, don't care

&gt; headed to my desk, glance down at paper Butterball has squished his arms around

&gt; waitwhat

&gt; it's my drawing, how did he get it

&gt; I say, ""That's my drawing""

&gt; Butterball immediately becomes defensive, slams flabby hand onto picture

&gt; ""NO IT'S NOT I DREW IT GO AWAY""

&gt; seeing red, angry that he's taking credit for this

&gt; ""That's my picture, you asshole!""

&gt; Butterball stands up, chair groans

&gt; ""YOU THINK I CAN'T DRAW JUST BECAUSE I'M FAT!?""

&gt; allofmywhat.rar

&gt; reach out to take paper, he grabs my arm

&gt; oh no he didn't

&gt; I haul my arm back, he gonna pay

&gt; art teacher grabs my arm, she's a short, beefy German immigrant 

&gt; drags me back to her office

&gt; tells me to wait there, I watch through office window

&gt; she goes to confront Butterball

&gt; he continues to accuse everyone of hating him because he's fat even though every accusation has to do with his stealing credit for a drawing he didn't do

&gt; finally this kid in the class says, ""Dude, there are plenty of fat people we like just fine *pause for gesture at other heavy classmate* we just don't like you because you're a huge shithead.""

&gt; my hero

&gt; Butterball storms out of the class

&gt; teacher follows, so do students

&gt; she's telling him to calm down and come back to class, he's still yelling about how she's going to be fired for this

&gt; Butterball reaches top of the flight of stairs, spins on his heel dramatically

&gt; ""You're ALL going to PAY for th-""

&gt; ohmygod.dang

&gt; his foot slips, he falls/rolls down the stairs

&gt; oh fuck, he's just lying there, what do

&gt; classmates are all scared, teacher is radioing that there's been an accident

&gt; Butterball unravels his curled up body, groans

&gt; farts explosively, comically

&gt; students proceed to nearly die laughing

&gt; Butterball never comes back to school, he dropped out and started ""training"" for the military

&gt; actually calls my house to threaten me once, parents concerned, idgaf

&gt; mfw his ""training"" consists of him playing CoD in his mom's basement all day, every day

I actually felt pretty bad about it, since he did break his leg falling down the stairs, but the guy was seriously an entitled shitbag who retaliated to criticism with absolute conviction that he was being persecuted for his weight.

TL;DR, gigantic hamburger patty plagiarizes drawing, runs away from art class and then falls down the school stairs, never to return.

1374608212.0	1iwkya	Tales of my fat, psycho ex-boyfriend Pt.1	SanitySandwich	447	93	84	"This happened to me a few years ago. I was in an abusive relationship because I was so naive/sheltered/stupid when it began and the more it went on, the more I found myself stuck. Most of this happens at university student accommodation.

Me: 5'3, 19y.o, female started at 140 pounds, ballooned up to 185 pounds and back down to 147 pounds over the course of the almost 2 year relationship
My Ex: Fat Cunt (FC), 6ft tall, 19y.o, easily 300+ pounds
Roommate number 1: RM1, 6ft, 19y.o, 152 pounds, male

Some background on FC: The worst start ever to a relationship. I was on the rebound when I started to date FC, we'd originally met up for sex, did the deed but then his parents show up the very next morning so we somehow then are in a relationship. This guy is a loser. The ultimate loser.

These are just some random incidences that my mind hasn't blocked out. Sorry if it's all over the place.

1) FC constantly acts like a child and never pulls his own weight (aha, see what I did there, sorry). When I first went round to his place the floor was covered in one giant pile of dorritos bags, dips and Pepsi bottles. He'd go to the corner shop every day to buy chocolate, energy drinks and junk food and end up spending about £15 each time. We'd all just moved to university and had to learn to fend for ourselves but FC just decided to waste all his student loan for the year, which was about £2000, on junk food and video games. Of course I was young and stupid as well and I somehow ended up falling for this guy. FC wore an ear stud which I made him take out because I have a jewelry phobia, when I look over to make sure he removed it, FC hadn't cleaned it in so long that he had to use two dirty forks to remove it from his ear. I've never wanted to throw up so much in my life.

&gt;  Cue the university cleaner walking in


&gt; The look of horror on her face


&gt; ""how do you live like this?!?!""

FC just laughed his ass off and from then on treated it as a proud moment. I should have dumped him then.

2) FC's fat logic. He'd belittle other people for being fat even though he was far fatter than them. When I moved to university I lost a stone because I was now in control of what I ate and that didn't mean being guilt tripped into eating 3 meals a day, I just ate when I felt like it. Living with FC I'd adopted how he ate and became a hamplanet myself. We'd play our PSPs together which meant having to look down at the screen but whenever I did FC would look over to me and chuckle to himself because I had a double chin which he found hilarious. He wanted me to get fat so no one else would want me so he could go on being an abusive shit and treating me like his mother. Now FC was a fat fuck. He had a neckbeard and because he was so fat he had no visible chin, he had massive manboobs and looked heavily pregnant. He even punched a wall (even though he ""just"" missed me doing so) because his pregnant belly had gotten huge, bright red stretch marks on them. I mean huge, at least 5 inches long all over his belly. He hated how he looked. Once I called him fat and he made me buy him a big meal to apologise. Then a few weeks later he calls me fat, I say ""where's my free meal huh?"" and laughs in my face. Fat women were disgusting, skinny women with small boobs were to be made fun of, flat stomachs were ""unnatural"" yet being a tall, ginger, waddling lard arse wasn't allowed to be remarked on.

3) Another fat incident or two. I'd always fake orgasms during sex to get this guy off of me. Yeah it was wrong of me to fake them but when the man planet who says he loves you also says he'll burn you alive if you kiss another girl/find someone else etc, it's easy to appease him and deal with feeling like shit in private later to avoid more ""I was only joking"" being hit or insulted. I'll get to how I dumped him later. Even though I got big myself, I was still tiny compared to FC which was made even worse when I started losing weight. One day he'd gotten so big he ripped his biggest pair of fat jeans and guess who he wanted to sew them up. I'd sew up these jeans about 5 times because he had nothing else that would fit him. To stop him being a whiny little shit I had to go on a specialist fat man website to buy even fatter jeans, which he never paid me back for and I still had to sew up about 3 times because he got bigger still. There's nothing sexy about a fat man crying out of pity for himself because learning to sew himself is too difficult.

4) Because FC never had any money because it all went on his ""food"" and rent he'd try to borrow off of his poor parents or me or our roommate RM1. 

&gt; go out with friends to a curry place once a week


&gt; about 8 of us


&gt; FC would look at me and RM1 and say with a grin ""so...who am I stealing money off of today then?""

It made me so angry I was always tempted just to say ""no one, fuck you"" and just order for myself. I always gave in despite him owing me about £600 for food/rent and RM1 (the nicest guy ever) about £400 because we'd have to deal with the sulking and anger otherwise. Plus, considering I didn't have the strength to defend myself it was my only option. I didn't have all the strong guy friends I have now to take him down some or hide/protect me.

5) FC's food diary and the incident with my mother. FC would sleep until 3pm, get up, play video games and eat junk food until 3am every day for almost 2 years, maybe showered about once every 3 weeks which is horrendous when he'd demand a blowjob (he'd make me swallow) and say ""I might fuck you later if you're good"" as a way of not having to bother pleasuring me. He'd get through whatever we had junk-wise in the house. A few 2L bottles of Pepsi, several bags of sweets and dorritos, jars of sour cream dip, a frozen pizza or 3. Even if it wasn't his, he'd eat it if it was in the fridge as ""I assumed you didn't want it"". He'd let all empty packets fall on the floor around him in the living room, he'd have a giant fan on in summer to push all his fat sweat towards me and RM1 when we decided to be in that room with him. One time my mother came over and I told FC to make her a cup of tea while I did some stuff upstairs. FC just completely ignores her by playing his Xbox and after a while just wanders upstairs. My mother is horrified by the sacrificial circle of junk food waste that has accumulated over the last few months.

&gt;Suck at all the sports, and as a result, hate them.

&gt;Don't be HockeyHam, massive, perfectly circular girl that I don't really like but still hang out with because I'm beta as fuck.

&gt;Gym class. Running time. Gotta run that 1200 meters (about 3/4 mile) as fast as possible to pass the exam. Track super short (200m/650ft), so that's 6 laps.

&gt;If you feel you can't sprint the whole way, you have the option of running one lap, stop the watch for a short rest, then run another lap, etc, as long as you do the 6 laps total.

&gt;I take the lazy option because I know I suck at running, don't want to try running the whole thing and fail and look stupid.

&gt;HockeyHam hears me telling teacher that I'm picking the option with rests.

&gt;HH: ""Yeah, I think you better. It can be really hard running that much when you're not in good shape. I'm in great shape, so I'm not gonna need the rests.""

&gt;HH: ""I'm not but I play hockey and that's even harder so running 1200 m is like nothing for me.""

&gt;umokaysure.mp3

&gt;HH clearly insulted by my apparent skepticism. Draws herself up (or at least tries to.) Begins proudly patting her flabby arms and thighs.

&gt;HH: ""I might *look* fat at a quick glance but I'm really not. Look, it's actually all muscle. Because I play hockey. People who aren't fit like me have more fat than muscle. You, for example. You look thinner than me but since you don't do sports you don't have any muscle under your fat.""

&gt;Erm, I'm starting to feel a little bit insulted here. 

&gt;Smile politely, walk away, go get a stopwatch. Kids gather at the line, get ready to start running. 

&gt;Aaaaand we're off!

&gt;Begin my first lap, running as fast as I can. Start panting in seconds. Feel myself getting red in the face. Reach the line, stop the watch, walk around a little on the side of the track, feel lame.

&gt;Damn I suck at sports.

&gt;""Urgh. Look at her.""

&gt;I turn around at the voice, sure they're talking about me. Two girls taking their rest by the track. Not talking about me. I follow their gaze.

&gt;HockeyHam is in trouble. She's stopped in the middle of the track, bent over.

&gt;Throwing up.

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/say-what.gif)

&gt;Wtf. She didn't even finish her first lap.

&gt;Teacher brings her to the infirmary. The other kids carry on running. I finish my sprint with much-needed rests in between laps.

&gt;HockeyHam not seen for the rest of the day.

&gt;The next day, HockeyHam is back. Still says she's super fit. Says her weight has nothing to do with her being sick. Says it's the teacher's fault for making her run in the heat. Says she can't do sprints anyway because she has… care to venture a guess? …thyroid problems. (I thought hockey was supposed to be much harder than running? I guess if you weigh a ton, you're going to end up *bending* the facts a little…)

**TL;DR: Obese high school girl shames me for not being fit, ends up vomiting after a 100 meters run, blames it on her thigh-roid.**

Addendum: Of all the hamplanets / aspiring celestial bodies I've met in my life so far, more than half blamed thyroid problems. All the wonderfully, disgustingly entertaining FPS's I've read here only confirm that the thigh-roid is the go-to fattie excuse. 

I know exactly ONE person who has actual hypothyroidism, and that's my sister. She used to be cold and tired all the time. She takes medication for it, and now she's fine. And she has *never* been anything less than perfectly fit.

For anyone who hasn't worked in a supermarket before, food-stamps (wic checks) take quite a bit of time to process. Each ticket has *very* specific items you have to ring up, and you can only ring up one ticket at a time. This means, you have to search for each item on the respective ticket you're ringing and ring it in order. She had an entire cart full of Ham-stock that we would have to dig through. 

&gt; Free Willy notices I'm trying to relocate her to a different habitat. Doesn't like that. Immediately goes into crisis, lockdown meat-mode.

&gt; *Yea it's okay, you can bag your own stuff though*

&gt; Go over to another register to bag.

Now, for some reason (I should've known better), I foolishly began to try to put what had just happened in the past and focus on helping other customers at another register. Nope.

&gt; Lovely Customer Service lady comes over to me, ""freakonaleash31, you *better* go upstairs right now.""

&gt; Be clueless me. ""Why, what's wrong?""

&gt; Customer Service lady pulls me into a corner and starts describing to me how, during my hiatus as bagger for my original station, Lady Lard had spent that time seething in Ham-filled hatred at how I could be so absolutely audacious as to encroach on her delicate sensibilities. 

&gt; Out of the corner of my eye, the peripheral space of my already bad vision becomes obscured by this fast moving lard locomotive, who has made it her mission to find me and hit me with some fat justice.

&gt; Ham planet gets in my face, pushing the rotund little sausages she called fingers in my face, bellowing about how I discriminated against her for her weight and economic status (her owning food stamps and all).

&gt; Store manager pulls me away and I make a quick escape upstairs to his office.

&gt; They told her they fired me so she would leave.

&gt; 20 minutes later, after the store manager made sure to suck the pork fat out of her deflated pancake titties, (offering to pay for her food, ect.) he came up to tell me I had really done nothing wrong.

&gt; Manager explained to me that she was a foster-mom of like 11 kids and that she was probably just stressed.

&gt; Cosmos bless whoever has to come across those plumped up Gremlins.

&gt; Jabba the Hutt wound up suing the store for the ""damages"" I had caused her.

&gt; Joke's on her! Since she had the money to hire a lawyer to sue us, she lost her ability to procure food-stamps!

I quit a little while after that.

Usually I stay quiet about my weight loss and general fitness enthusiasm cause I tend to get some form of inquisition about ""How I did it"". Ughh. 

Anyway,

&gt;My turn to be incredulous, Beetus Bro takes fitness commitment very seriously and follows my advice
&gt;Starts looking up info online, stops eating 3 packs of Ramen for lunch

&gt;Completely turns his shit around and shows no signs of stopping, generally nicer person to be around 

&gt;Holy shit, he's gonna' make it.

&gt;Be me, fairly fit, 22, female

&gt;On register today, running my ass off to price check and scan

&gt;Please don't be Hamager, 5'3"", probably about 350

&gt;Just started my shift, only five hours to go

&gt;Hamager informs me that she needs me to work the backup register

Not a huge deal, but the back up register is wedged in a corner, and has about half the size of a normal register in terms of moving-around space. This doesn't bother me, as I am human-sized, but some of the bigger employees have a hard time getting in and out of the register stand to scan things. 

&gt;20 minutes or so go by, we start to get busy

&gt;Doesn't matter to me, hanging out with my customers, getting stuff done.

&gt;Suddenly, all lumber collapses from shelves

&gt;Drywall cracks from sudden increase in atmospheric pressure

&gt;A Hamager approaches

At this point, I come to the realization that the other shitty thing about the back-up register is that it happens to hold all of the cash for the other registers. This means that every time that anyone needs change, Hamager is forced to come into my register to get it for them.

&gt;Hamager tries to get past me to access cash-box

&gt;Squirm right. 

&gt;Nope.

&gt;Try left.

&gt;Even bigger nope, cash register in my gut

&gt;Physically place my torso on counter, Hamager the Great barely squeezes by

&gt;""I guess you are going to have to turn off your light until I get finished with my business, tee-effing-hee""

&gt;Realize that her second-from-bottom roll is wedged firmly on top of my butt.

&gt;Feels moist

&gt;So moist.

&gt;ewwnowords.fuck

At this point I realize that the only way that this is going to work without me throwing up everywhere is if I turn off my light and leave the register (interrupting my work and forcing me to basically do nothing) until she is finished.

&gt;Finally, the beast emerges

&gt;""I knew it would be a good idea to put you on this register, you teensy thing. I can work right around you! Lucky for us, you still have awhile before you hit puberty and fill out!""

&gt;Bitch.

&gt;I am drinking legal.

&gt;I am pubertized.

&gt;Not even Mance Rayder could scale your walls.

Hamager proceeds to come into my register fourteen times during my shift. By the end of the day I am covered in her sweat, and thoroughly traumatized.

1370114131.0	1fh79x	Research Experience for an Ungulate, or How I Learned to Start Worrying (for mankind) and Hate the Hamplanet	RadicalEucalyptus	428	76	62	"Okay, I have been lurking through fps for about a month now, quietly snickering to myself and silently wishing that I had a story to regale all you loveable folk.  Yesterday, I mentioned this sub to an IRL friend and he sent this text later:  “This sub is hilarious.  So, are you drafting up a story about Hamhock?”.  I immediately felt my pulse race. OH. MY. GOD.  I had forgotten.  I not only had a story (one in particular is the episode that I tell most friends), but a few other isolated incidents.

So first, some background.  About six years ago I was just about to finish my junior year at a small liberal arts college in the midwest.  I was actually pretty skinny and small (5’9, 140 lbs).  Most of the credit for that goes to a friend who was into lifting weights and running, and one day I asked him if he would buddy with me and teach me things.  Since then, I focused much more on how I ate (got into paleo, although only moderately, because small school cafeteria, read up on the science, worked out, etc).  I had decided to apply for summer undergraduate research in molecular biology (experience in a lab is BIG for applying to graduate school).   We will pick the story up there.  Engage greentext (first time!)

&gt;Be me, applying for REU (research experience for undergraduate) programs all over the country.

&gt; Florida &gt; Iowa (possible oversimplification).

&gt;Email roommate, asking what kinds of things he is bringing.

&gt;Roomie responds, seems cool.

&gt; I confirm the things he is bringing.  I don’t want us both to bring TVs or something. Jokingly, I say, “It would be stupid for both of us to bring our rock tumblers to the beach”.

&gt;Roomie ignores comment, we’ll figure it all out when we’re showing up.  End communication.

&gt;Be next month, on my trip to Florida.

&gt;Get picked up at airport by cool old guy.

&gt; [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/what.gif) he tells me he is the MAYOR of the small town where research facility is located 

&gt;Hour later, we arrive at facility.  My school is in session until late May.  I am last to arrive.

&gt;Just in time for a pizza dinner, get-to-know-the-students kind of thing.  Pizza is laid out on picnic tables.

&gt;time2meetpeeps.heregoes

&gt;See only one other guy.  Assume it must be Roomie.  He informs me that we are the only two guys.  Among 10 girls.  Is this real life?

&gt; sit down, talking to Roomie, things are warm, happy, sunshine.  Meet the girls.  Sit next to one, I will call her Geode.

&gt;Geode is pretty tiny.  5’3, maybe 110.  Fit-looking, with red/auburn hair.  Very cute.

&gt; Start to feel funny (a bad kind).

&gt; Things feel darker, sadder, less sunshiney

&gt; The joy seems to dissipate, casual chatter becomes strained, and the sun visibly darkens

&gt; Tectonic plates groan, shift, and barely hold

&gt;Is this some ominous cloud, a harbinger of the troubles to come?

&gt;Well, kind of. But no cloud.  A hamplanet.

&gt; [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/no.gif) behind me, there is a squat, brunette girl built like a bowling ball

&gt;  Girl sits down across from me and Geode, next to the Roomie, introduces herself

&gt;  She is slightly shorter than I, but at least twice my weight.  I think 5’5’’, 280 is probably about right.

&gt;  Person-in-charge says, “Let’s wait until everyone shows up to start the food, we’ll give ‘em five minutes.”

&gt;  Thank all that is holy that this man didn’t physically get between Hammy and the food.

&gt; “Seriously?  Just because a couple girls are late I have to sit here starving?  This is bull.”

&gt;  At this point, girl sits down, clears throat, and spits one of the nastiest loogies I had ever seen (or seen since), over the side of the table, into the grass.

&gt; [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yuck.gif)  We shall call this planet, “Hamhock”

&gt;  Geode says, “Umm, what the hell?”

&gt; Oddly, Hamhock is apologetic.  Says, “I am not used to being around people who care about stuff like that”.

&gt; Geode, Roomie and I look to each other for the meaning of this comment.  We do not find the answers in each others’ eyes.

&gt;weareallgoingtodie.yup

&gt;  everyone arrives.  Pizzatime!

&gt; Hamhock grabs half of a pie, folds it over itself, creating some kind of unholy pizza-sandwich, and starts digging in.

&gt;[ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imgur_9CUtI.gif)  “It’s easier to eat this way”

&gt; Easier than [what] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mend69jUi21rtvqzco1_500.gif)?

&gt; Anyway, we start doing some basic introductions.  The girls are oddly aware of my rock tumbler email.

&gt; Roomie tells me that he wasn’t sure if I was serious, thought maybe I was some kind of rock-hound super nerd, so he told all the girls about it.

&gt; Regardless, Geode thought it was funny, and told me she was into rocks, had a geode she brought with her, etc.  Hence, her name.

&gt;Hamhock, done with her first half pizza, gets up to scour the boxes for seconds.  I am quite full with my two pieces, and Geode has nibbled away only about half of hers.

&gt;  Hamhock returns, and plops several of her folds on the picnic bench.

&gt;  “This is pretty good pizza, but back home they have better kinds”

&gt;  We’re eating chain pizza.  Well-known chain pizza.  Of course there is better pizza.  Words begin to fail me.

&gt;  I say, “Yeah, it is alright.  I usually don’t eat so much but I had a short connection and missed lunch”

&gt; [hwf] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/0c6649ef147636b8d42d00fbf72b4fe8/tumblr_mfr5qk00QA1riiw1do1_250.gif) she is trying to work out if I meant that as an insult (hint:  I didn’t)

&gt; “Well, RadicalEucalyptus, I think that some people don’t eat enough.  They starve themselves and try to look all twiggy and they think it’s pretty. But it isn’t pretty, it is sad.  They should just be happy with what they have.  I may not be super-healthy, but I feel good about myself, at least.”

&gt; The table realizes that I have said something to set off these interminable whale sounds, which only through retrospect I identify as Fatty Logic

&gt;  But next to me, Geode is tearing up.

&gt;  I catch her eyes with a slightly quizzical look.  Realization must crawl over my face, because she looks down quickly

&gt; uhoh.mpeg

&gt;  Geode stands up and says, “It isn’t always that simple!” in a real shakey voice, and walks away, over to where the dorm rooms are.

&gt;hellodarknessmydearfriend.mp3

&gt;Hamhock has the nerve to say, “What the hell is her problem?”

&gt;This sets me over the edge a little.  Jimmies, they are a’ rustlin’.

&gt; “Are you serious?  Obviously, she has dealt with an eating disorder before.  You can’t possibly think it is okay to shout bromides about body image at a table full of girls.  You never know what a person has been through – especially with a group you just met!”

&gt;  “Oh, I guess she is really skinny.  And she wasn’t eating much.  How sad.”

&gt;  [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/HV7Z3JG.gif) THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING POINT!

&gt;   We at the table start to try to convince her to apologize, goes over poorly.

&gt;  “Well, make RadicalEucalyptus apologize to me first!”

&gt; I tell her, “I am sorry if you thought I was implying that you ate too much, but I was just describing my own eating habits.  There, happy?”

&gt;  She grumbles something that can’t quite escape the event horizon that is her mouth, and truffle-shuffles off to the dorms, obv carrying her pizza with her.

&gt;  Roomie looks at me, “Holy shit, man.”

&gt;  I say, “Yeah, 10 girls in forced proximity for a summer in Florida.  Forget TNT, we’re about to know some *real* drama”.

tl;dr - Hamplanet disgusts, shames ex-anorexic girl, feels nothing.

We good? Good.

&gt; Be me. Female, 18 years of age, 5'7 185 lbs (now 165 and going! Can I get a woop woop?). Going to college in Mississippi. Already a huge food/health/biology nerd. Just have a fucked up emotional eating habit. 

&gt; Dont be new best friend living in same dorm. 

She isn't a hamplanet exactly, but she was certainly overweight. She has a petite frame, is about 5""3, and carries all of her weight on her midsection.  Think [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-924-body-shape.htm?StartAt=26#.UaeRmECG0sI), but lily white.
Let us call her McEvil.

Both have anxiety issues, so we were together a lot. 
Anywho, freshman year takes it toll. One day I had very public health scare (passed out, shakes, the works). Taken to the hospital. Silver lining is that we find out that my heart doesn't heart well.

&gt;Get super embarrassed. Kick coffee and sweet tea immediately. 
Decide I am going to commit myself to health. Stop drinking almost completely, 1200 cal diet, no shitty processed food. It's a difficult process though.


&gt;McEvil is super excited and wants to diet too. Sweet! I could use the support. 

 I invite her to the gym. 
She goes with me once and spends about 25 minutes on the elliptical with zero resistance before she stops me. 

Says she is really anxious about all the people coming in. I understand, people are scary sometimes, so she leaves. 
I invited her repeatedly to go with me at 6am because no one is there. Everyday for two weeks I try to wake her up at her request, but to no avail. And then she complains about how terrible she feels and she isn't losing weight. But I digress. 

&gt;One day:
McEvil: Hey ChichiBird let's go to WataBeetus. (This was a very common occurance for her, even on her ""diet"")
Me: I mean, I will sit with you, but I am not getting anything.
McEvil: Yeah, we'll see. 

[kay?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scarjo_say_what.gif)

&gt;After she gets her food, she starts trying to feed me her extra large fries. 
Me: Nah, I'm good. Already gone over my calorie limit for today anyway. 
McEvil: You have to have a cheat day. Its healthy!

Me: Yea I had some froyo earlier, I'm good.

 McEvil **shoves** her half eaten burger in my face. (Apparently this is a common thing for people with the terrible logic)

&gt; ""Seriously ChichiBird? Just a bite! Its not going to kill you!"" She saysto me like she is feeding a 5 year old. 

I have mayo on my [face.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yuck.gif) 

She continues to badger and push food at me for a good 10 minutes.

 Me: *No thank you, I am seriously not hungry.*
&gt; McEvil: ""It is *seriously* not okay to *starve* yourself.
ChichiBird. What you are doing is not normal and **disgusting**.""

She knows I had gone through dealing with an eating disorder in the past but still fight it everyday. (claims she was anorexic too)
Tears well up.

&gt; I a few french fries to get the fuck out of there. 

**This is just the beginning of the fuckery that is the Tale of McEvil.**

Over about the course of a month she starts messing with my head about losing weight. 
In private she will basically encourages me to stop eating and be disordered again. 
In public she points out my habits and tells everyone we are dieting but that I barely eat. 

&gt; For example: 

&gt; She hands me a bottle of supplements.
"" Here, I know how you are trying to lose weight. I took these back when I never ate. You can basically live off of just these for months."" 
Herbetaboyfriend: ""Or she could eat""
McEvil: ""Or.....""

&gt; Next morning at breakfast. Chillin wit bros.
CrossCountrybro1: Hey ChichiBird! I didn't know you wake up this early

Me: Well I usually eat earlier after my run but I woke up late.

&gt;CCbro1 praises me on the hard work and says I am looking better.
feelsgoodman.imgunnamakeit.dotwhateverthefuck

&gt; McEvil, not used to being the center of attention, senses a challenge.

 Fat rage mode activate. 

&gt; She snatches phone out of hand while I am logging in my intake.
McEvil: "" Seriously? You are counting a sugar packet? A friggen sugar packet?!?""
 I snatched it back, pretty angry at this point.
Me: Yes. Get off of me about this already. 

&gt; McEvil: ""We talked about this! You are not eating enough. We all know that water trick you do to make yourself feel full! You are going to go into starvation mode and gain weight. Seriously. I have talked to BetaPreMedBoyfriend and he agrees with me.""

I am pretty embarrassed at this point because she starts have an intervention for my eating disorder  in the middle of our school' s caf.

Me: ""No you talk AT me. Just because he is PRE med doesn't mean he has done the amount of research I have-- I do for *fun*. A 1200 calorie diet is not a starvation diet. I can show you the studies that show real starvation diets. Do you want to see them? Either educate yourself or quit criticizing me.""

&gt; ""Whatever. Suit yourself"" she said whilst shoveling sausage into her mouth. ugh. 

""I will"" and walk out. 

&gt; The real kicker to this story? 
Says she has so much belly fat because of her.....
....
What is diabeetus?
Correcttttttt!
and you Mr. Lurker win [Jimmie Jeopardy!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/lemon-rain-dance.gif)

&gt; She says she has a special kind of diabeetus that makes her gain weight on just her stomach and that no amount of exercise will fix it. 

But I have never seen medication or insulin or anything of the sort

and she drinks alcohol everyday

and at least three cans of sprite

and has a fetish for fast food.

I wish I made this up.

&gt;Be about 9:30 and my boyfriend calls asks if he can come over since my parents are gone

&gt;Tell him that I have someone over but he can still come if he wants to

&gt;Says that's fine

&gt;Tell Sara that he's coming over

&gt;Says she wants to change into her pajamas

&gt;Okay whatever

&gt;She comes back out of the bathroom in a skin tight (I can see ALL the rolls) tank top that her massive fat girl boobs are pratically hanging out of and a pair of short shorts that are probably cutting off circulation to her cottage cheese thighs.

&gt;Uh, I don't think so.

&gt;Tell her it's pretty cold outside and that's probably where we'll be

&gt;Asks if she can borrow one of my shirts

&gt;Well... uh... if you think it will work.

&gt;Grabs one of my sweaters and forces it on

&gt;That poor poor sweater

&gt;Boyfriend gets there and we go out to my garage

&gt;""We should play spin the bottle teehee"" (why do they all teehee?)

&gt;Uh, no, there's only three of us here

&gt;Boyfriend looks at me terrified

&gt;Super Subject Change Activated

&gt;""It's soooooooo hot in here"" she says

&gt;Keep in mind it's fucking February and my boyfriend and I are covered up with a blanket

&gt;Takes off sweater and pulls tank top down so that even more chest fat is hanging out. Then proceeds to reach into her shirt and jam chest fat up into neck fat to create sad attempt at cleavage

&gt;Try not to gag

&gt;""So can we pleeeeeease play spin the bottle??"" she asks again

&gt;Tell her we don't have a bottle... so no.

&gt;Gets up and walks over to canned goods shelf (I'm not sure if anyone else did this but we kept all our canned goods on a shelf out in the garage) and grabs a can of tomato soup

&gt;Please no

&gt;Sits back down and proceeds to try and spin it on the floor

&gt;It's pointing towards me

&gt;No. No. No. NO. NO.

&gt;She grabs at my face and tries to kiss me

&gt;Resist urge to punch her in her fucking face and just slap her hands away

&gt;""Oh you're no fun! I bet your boyfriend would have really liked that"" she pouts

&gt;Look over at him [HF](http://i.imgur.com/EbnTO7k.gif)

&gt;""He's probably just doing that so you don't get jealous teehee!""

&gt;At this point it's getting hard to control my rage so I nudge my boyfriend and ask him if he wants me to walk him back to his house

&gt;He says yes

&gt;""Buuuuuuut what am I going to do why you're gone???????"" she whines

&gt;Give her my laptop to use

&gt;On the walk to his house we laugh our asses off about her

&gt;Feel so much better

&gt;Get back to my house and open door

&gt;Nose filled with scent of over cooked pasta (most people can't smell it if you can I feel sorry for you because it's horrible)

&gt;Go to kitchen and see Hamplanet on my laptop next to empty bowl

&gt;""I got hungry teehee""

&gt;She ate a whole box of macaroni (keep in mind we had stopped food on the way to my house)

&gt;She then proceeds to show me her fake dating site profile with pictures of some scene girl

&gt;Goes on and on about how much attention guys give her

&gt;Wat?

&gt;After an hour or so of me watching TV (after I had to clean up her macaroni mess) and her talking about all the cute guys she's talking to she says she's tired

&gt;I make her sleep on the couch

So all of my roommates went to the same uni, that's how we met each other. A couple of them still attend, British Roommate and I graduated last year. 

Yesterday was the last day for our uni, though nothing really happened other than people clearing out their lockers and such so no one really planned on going. That decision being had, Tiny Roommate invited a bunch of uni friends over to our house Thursday night so we could play video games all night (LAN party!) and generally be irresponsible with our time. 

So right before everyone is supposed to be over, I'm sitting at the kitchen table listening to British Roommate and British Boyfriend yell at each other over cars (Boyfriend is a Jaguar guy, Roommate is a Porsche guy. Shit got real.) and generally crying laughing when suddenly the room goes cold. The lights dim. All the happiness is sucked out of the room. 

Something is clearly not okay. 

In walks a few friends from uni and in tow... SmallMoon, ""M"" from the other stories, the one who is in love with Boyfriend. 

Boyfriend and I glance at each other. Oh shit. She knows where I live. To be fair to my other friend, we told them to invite people if they wanted, but man. Ugh. 

It begins. 

&gt;People starting to show up, expecting around 20+

&gt;Have sick setup for LAN in the basement: 4TVs + 4 XBoxes = 16 player Halo. 

&gt;Food everywhere. Pizza, chips, pop, veggie platters, hummus and veggie chips... basically including everyone's dietary needs. 

&gt;SmallMoon and EventualPlanet end up sitting next to each other. 

&gt;Happened because SmallMoon kept trying to sit next to Boyfriend and I asked EventualPlanet to distract her because they seem to like each other and sometimes EventualPlanet can be a bro. 

&gt;All is going surprisingly well. 

&gt;Suddenly both SmallMoon and EventualPlanet ""give up"" because ""this is stupid"" and pass their controllers on so they can load up huge plates of pizza and chips and guzzle down some liquid beetus. 

&gt;It was kinda stupid, but hilarious. Stuck 16 people on a small map and gave them all rocket launchers. 

&gt;Anyways. 

&gt;Somehow SmallMoon and EventualPlanet end up sitting next to me, stuffing their faces with 4+ pieces of pizza each. Start talking about the party food. 

&gt;SmallMoon says the veggies aren't party food (teehee). 

&gt;EventualPlanet pegs them as my idea

&gt;They were, because my friends asked for them and so I delivered because I'm a fucking good friend. 

&gt;I ""mhm"" and otherwise try to ignore them. 

&gt;""SometimesIArt is on some sort of health kick right now."" 

&gt;For the past year and a bit, but okay. 

&gt;""Oh, SometimesIArt, you *must know* that those don't work... I thought we talked about this.""

&gt;I look away from my violently exploding character to Bertstare at SmallMoon. 

&gt;""We didn't talk about it, you called me an obsessive slut.""

&gt;""Oh sorry teehee... I didn't mean it, I was having a bad day."" 

&gt;""Thanks for apologizing."" 

&gt;Pretty shitty apology but I'll take it, I'm a pretty chill person. 

&gt;""But you know you shouldn't deny yourself taking pleasure in food. Who you are is who you are and you will look how you are built to look.""

&gt;Ohh no.

&gt;""Thanks for the concern, but I'm doing alright."" I go back to playing (violently dying every 30 seconds). 

&gt;EventualPlanet enters in with, ""She eats the same thing every day, I don't get it."" 

EventualPlanet has this incredibly annoying habit of sharing everything with everyone about my life. Like once I forgot to brush my teeth (which I do obsessively) before leaving with the roommates for a movie night and she told everyone at the house that if they smelled something weird it was probably my breath. Shit like that. All the freaking time. It's supposed to be a joke, but it's a bad one. 

&gt;""Ewww how can you live like that?"" 

&gt;""Ehhhhh..."" Still trying to ignore them and play the game. 

&gt;SmallMoon says ""seriously I would rather be a little chubby than be stuck eating tasteless food and starving all day."" 

&gt;Wat. 

&gt;EventualPlanet agrees. ""Yeah and no one is happy with their body anyways so there's no use obsessing over image."" 

&gt;Start looking around for someone to save me so I can swap out and leave for a bit. Boyfriend is off across the room, back in the car debate with BritishRoommate, fricking load of good he is. 

&gt;""How thin is thin enough anyways?"" 

&gt;Ignoring. 

&gt;""SometimesIArt, I'm talking to you."" 

&gt;I am deaf in one ear, so I get away with ignoring people excellently. 

&gt;""HEY!"" They're nudging me now. 

&gt;Repeat the question. I have to give in. 

&gt;""Well I have about nine pounds to go before I'm out of overweight territory and then we'll see from there. I'm just aiming for healthy."" 

&gt;""Have you heard of HAES?"" 

&gt;Fuck. 

&gt;""Yeah, not my thing."" 

&gt;""How is *SCIENCE* not your thing.""

&gt;Seriously, someone save me. 

&gt;""I mean, look at you. If that is overweight then what am I?"" hnnnnnngg ""Doctors are pushing everyone to unhealthy lows just because of some social standard. You are SO thin, and society is telling you you aren't beautiful."" WTF. 

&gt;[Photo for reference](http://i.imgur.com/FXDxCto.jpg), I am not thin. Definitely not moon status anymore, but I have a little ways to go yet. (pic is actually me). 

&gt;TinyRoommate hears all of this unfold, is pretty timid so doesn't get involved until there. 

&gt;""Excuse me, but my doctor is pushing me to GAIN weight."" 

&gt;Conversation hits a wall. They don't know how to logic. 

&gt;EventualPlanet finally gets hit with the amount of stupid, forcefully invites SmallMoon for more pizza. 

All was well for the rest of the night. They both actively avoided me so I thought I had sidestepped any more problems and it being the end of the year and SmallMoon's graduation, I wouldn't have to ever see her again. Yay! 

Nope. 

She had to get one last thing in before she left. Not FPS but wrapping up the series with her forever and ever. 

&gt;Boyfriend is driving straight from my house to the air port. 

&gt;Going to England for the next month to visit parents.

&gt;His roommate is here to pick him up. 

&gt;Being the ""goodbye for a month"" girlfriend, ""be a man"" (figuratively), don't cry. Lots of hugs. Etc. You know the drill. 

&gt;SmallMoon's ride is leaving at the same time. 

&gt;SmallMoon asks if Boyfriend is sticking around for summer. 

&gt;Tells the truth.

&gt;Small moon freaks out and demands a hug, shoves between me and Boyfriend and hugs. 

&gt;Awkwardly long. 

&gt;Boyfriend isn't hugging back. 

&gt;He finally says ""okay"" and pushes her back. 

&gt;She tells him

&gt;""Call me... you know... if you ever... NEED me."" She glances at me, gives a smug smile, and flounces off to her friend's car. 

&gt;Shouts out the window, ""I'll miss you!!!"" 

&gt;Boyfriend pukes everywhere, had to cancel flight because rage-induced aneurism. 

&gt;Not really, we laughed it off. 

&gt;The end. 


**TL;DR**: Fat people criticize healthy eating while eating mass amounts of pizza, try to enter into a debate about HAES. Also closure on the moon in love with my boyfriend. "	t5_2vzax	True

Now, neither of us are exceptionally thin. But he was a competitive mountain biker until about a year ago (our basement ""man-cave / man-gym"" is a testament to that), and as I mentioned [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gqwcj/baby_phat/), I was on my highschool wresting team &amp; by some miracle still retain much of the physique of those days.

We both eat relatively healthy most days - only getting the McBeetus **maybe** once a month. Husband-in-training is a BBQ grill master, and loves to cook our meals. 

Our trips to the amusement park are a big-time cheat day for both of us, and boy-o-boy do we ever go to TOWN.

[Funnel cake!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQD_bEYPFz4)

&gt; drag husband-in-training to nearest yum-yum shop

On the way to yum-yum shop, I had already commented to husband-in-training that people seemed especially rude today. Ruder than usual. Rude, as in every lineup seemed to have a person in front of us who told-off their food server. Rude, considering this is SUPPOSED to be Canada ""home of the 'sorry'"". 

What WOULD our southern neighbours say if they found out the truth??

Wait wait, the rude people are probably all Americans who are visiting. I mean, there are NO amusement parks in the USA to rival ours, so that must be it!! Right?? Right?!?! Content with our logical reasoning, we carry on

&gt; approach yum-yum lineup

&gt; earth shakes, rollercoasters teeter on their tracks, babies scream and little kids run and hide

&gt; earthquake? nope ... 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yuck.gif) I look up and see [THIS](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-21571-body-shape.htm#.Ucm1z_m25io) walking in front of me ... wearing bikini roughly the same size as mine (size 6 *shudder*)

&gt; youarefuckingkidding.gif ... she's headed to the same lineup as us

&gt; see itty-bitty 20-something already in line. super-fit chick. totally cute

&gt; be tempted to cover husband-in-training's eyes, but restrain self &amp; grab his bum to distract

&gt; husband-in-training too disgusted with Hamplanet to notice anyway. He has turned a shade of green. Stares at me with eyes wide open, mouthing words that just won't come out

&gt; up til now, Hamplanet had eclipsed her mini-moon. See mini-moon. Not so mini. Nearing planet status. Wearing same bikini as planet-parent, in a smaller size

&gt; mustfightthepuke.avi

&gt; husband-in-training and I stare at our shoes while in line, not daring to speak

&gt; MUST.NOT.LOSE.APPETITE. FUNNEL CAKE WAITING!

&gt; Look up to see a scuffle happening ahead

&gt; Hamplanet and mini-planet trying to butt-in line, in front of hot-chick

&gt; yum-yum shop employee ignores hamplanet, and asks hot-chick for her order

&gt; Hamplanet quivers. Hamplanet rolls cause mini-quake

&gt; ""DIS SKINNY BITCH CAN WAIT FOR HER FOOD! I HAVE A ... ""

wait for it!!! 

&gt; ""... CUNDISHION!""

&gt; ""MAH KNEES HURT!""

&gt; ""MAH BLOOD SHUGARRR!! I HAS DA BEETUS!""

&gt; ""MAH MINI-PLANET GONNA FAINT! SHE HAS CUNDISHION! SHE HAS ... DA BEETUS!""

&gt; ""U THINK JIST BECUZ U SKINNY, THAT U BETTER THAN ME, BITCH?!""

&gt; ""WHY U SERVING HER FIRST?! SHE'S GOTS NO CURVZZZZ""

Hot-chick is now bright red, and looks to be on the verge of tears. She says nothing.

Boyfriend and I in shock. Never actually witnessed anything like this before!

&gt; Hamplanet obviously seething, hollering at mini-planet about ""NO RESPECT"" and ""DISCRIMINATION!""

&gt; Another yum-yum shop employee comes up, serves Hamplanet

&gt; we go to first employee &amp; place order. He's obviously upset. Hands shaking, face red

&gt; husband-in-training giving me the ""don't say anything!!!"" look *fucking beta*

For those who read my [Baby Phat story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gqwcj/baby_phat/), will know how much grief I got over being such a Beta. Not so today. This is many years after Baby Phat. I'm an ALPHA NOW!

&gt; Look straight at Hamplanet

&gt; Notice hot-chick is grabbing napkins a couple feet away

&gt; ""don't let the bitch get to you. she only wishes she looked that good in a bikini. and some people are cunts at any size""

Employee scurries away to hide laughter

Hot-chick stares at me with mouth open, then starts laughing

Husband-in-training can't restrain himself, busts a gut

Hamplanet stares and sputters

I grab food and husband-in-training and stalk away

Good deed for the day = accomplished.

&gt;&gt;Still be me, working in Intensive Care Unit as a nurse tech (body fluid cleanup specialist/nurses bitch). 

&gt;&gt;Still working crappy shift from part III. 

&gt;&gt;Everyone in the ICU was trying to concentrate on the mother that was in critical condition. We had never had a baby born in the ICU and wanted to stabilize her and keep it that way.

&gt;&gt;I decide to go take a quick break in our break room. I then remembered the 4-dozen bagels and cards that a patient's family brought as a thank you. Decide to try regain some faith in humanity with a nice everything bagel and read some of the cards.

&gt;&gt;Sit down. 

&gt;&gt;Basketball game is on tv. 

&gt;&gt;Cards are on the table. 

&gt;&gt;Bagels are all gone. 

&gt;&gt;Fresh pot of coffee brewing. 

&gt;&gt;If only but for a moment, life was goo....wait a minute! The bagels are all gone.

&gt;&gt;Only 7 other nurses on that shift who share this breakroom.
&gt;&gt;Only one nurse said he was able to grab a bagel. No one knew what happened to them. Everyone starts getting pissed. 

&gt;&gt;I think fps knows what happened to them.

&gt;&gt;Suddenly the alarms by my desk start going off. I slam my coffee and get up from the break room to go see what was going on. The expensive machine whose only job is to go “Ping!” is loudly going “Ping!” I look at the monitors and Hamspanic’s heart rate starts getting really elevated and she starts throwing a few PVCs, but.....her O2 sats are at 98%. Hmmm...they haven’t been that high since she has been here. Typically in the 60-80% Silence alarm.

&gt;&gt;Heart rate still increasing. More PVCs. Decided to go in there. 


FPS...prepare to say goodbye to the last of your jimmies if you have any left at this point.

&gt;&gt;She has turned blue **again**....and was eating all of our bagels from the boxes on her bed. GramHam had taken off the oxygen meter and put it on her own finger so that her daughter could eat some more before she was put on the vent without us interfering. 

&gt;&gt;I yell for the charge nurse to come in immediately since I have no idea what her actual oxygen rate is and slap the bagel out of her hand and push the CPAP over her face.

&gt;&gt;“Nerrrrrr. *GASP* I wants mah BAHGUL!”
 
&gt;&gt;GramHam: “You people are starving my poor baby. Don’t you morons know she has to eat. She is really nervous about the procedure tomorrow and eating calms her down!”
I glare at this 400 lbs fossil and see that she was also [eating an everything bagel](http://i.imgur.com/698CCV5.gif). 

&gt;&gt;Hamana was sitting in her power chair [eating two bagels sandwiching a tub of cream cheese](http://i.imgur.com/PySgvqd.gif). 

&gt;&gt;Peter Pannis was crouched in the corner covered in cinnamon toast bagel crumbs. The fat ninja had defeated us.

Stressed Charge Nurse Bro was in the middle of helping an ob/gyn with an emergency C-Section in the room next door and part of a team trying unsuccessfully to keep 3 month old infant alive. 

&gt;&gt;SCNB: “I don’t give a shit about Hamspanic anymore Tardismyspiritanimal! Let her kill herself. I’m trying to save two people that are desperately trying to hold on to their lives. Just order me a damn chopper for the baby.”

Somehow mention there are also no more bagels (I think someone asked me if there were any more blueberry bagels on my way out of the room). 

&gt;&gt;Charge nurse is one of my favorite bros and he has had a shitty night. Now, he is about is about to lose the baby and looks up and realizes he will also not have a comfort bagel to cheer himself up with later.

&gt;&gt;Somehow, something in his brain sorta just...snapped. 

&gt;&gt;The weeks of cleaning out “The Kitty,” dealing with all of Hamspanics deadly fatlogic, the enabling family planets orbiting her, the infant that he knows will probably be dead in the next few minutes, the mother was crashing, and the father was crying and wanting to know what will happen to his wife and child, 


and now no delicious cinnamon toast bagels. 

&gt;&gt;He pulls me aside and whispers in my ear “I will *twitch* personally smother that thundercunt *twitch* with her own moldy tits if she hasn’t been intubated by the time I *twitch* get out of here. [And I will set the other three on fire if I ever see their faces again!](http://i.imgur.com/X4j46gr.gif)” 

&gt;&gt;He pulls away smiling maniacally and makes a some circles in the air with his hands and says “Whoosh” ([presumably indicating a fire](http://i.imgur.com/G4kefku.gif)) then turns back to helping the ob/gyn. 


Now...not wanting Stressed Charge Nurse Bro to go to jail I moved rather quickly.


At first I didn’t think I had that much power in my position. But then realized I controlled the phones, the computers, talked to the physicians, scheduled and prioritized all procedures and tests, and relayed orders to the other departments in the hospital on the behalf of the nurses. The nurses and physicians would often just give me their passwords to enter in override orders for them. Sort of like a “Steward” or “Hand of the King.”

&gt;&gt;I called the pulmonologist (at like 11PM mind you...he was PISSSED) and explained the situation. We scheduled the intubation for right then instead of in the morning. I walked in there with respiratory, the hospitalist, security, and several techs toting the vent.
“Wat are glarbalglarbal you doing? *Gasp* I blarbgalabrelel 8 more hours to eat ALL I want *wheeze*” If you ain’t nice to me ya’ll have ta clean out Kittay!”

&gt;&gt;The team descended upon here and within 10 minutes she was sedated, 4 point restraints put on her hands and feet, [and put in the vent with an NG tube.](http://i.imgur.com/vs9Lb82.gif) Where she remained for several months.

&gt;&gt;Security kicked all of the family out and banned from ever coming back into the ICU. Peter Pannis the fat ninja threw down a smoke bomb and disappeared into the night. Social services and the police were also notified. 

I looked over at Stressed Charge Nurse Bro coming out of the other room. They were loading the infant into some sort of ungodly incubator/ventilator the size of a fridge and were sending it off to the [chopper](http://youtu.be/Xs_OacEq2Sk?t=3s).

&gt;&gt;A team was in there stabilizing the critical mom. She was hemorrhaging badly, but she was going to make it. 

&gt;&gt;Stressed Charge Nurse Bro just went in the break room and [just sat there](http://i.imgur.com/Pmn0Tv5.gif). He stared blankly forward. It looked like his soul had left his body

Working in the ICU you don’t have to deal with babies, mostly older people. There is just something just extra emotionally draining about seeing an infant going through trauma. The infant wound up dying a week later.

&gt;&gt;“Am I going to go to have to go to jail tonight?”


&gt;&gt;”Not tonight Stressed Charge Nurse Bro. I handled it.”


[HFW](http://i.imgur.com/Ud7BQvn.gif) I recap the last 30 minutes.


&gt;&gt;”Thanks Tardismyspiritanimal.”


&gt;&gt;Hands me his credit card.


&gt;&gt;”Go get us some something to eat...something healthy.”


Casualty report for the evening. An entire ICU nutrition room, 12 dirty patient trays covered in MRSA, 47 bagels, and my faith in humanity.

**TL:DR Hamspanic finally gets silenced because she won't stop eating.**

&gt; Go to party, play some music and have a merry time.

&gt; Last guest gets there. The floor rumbles, the clouds of Mordor hang over us and things begin to fall off shelves. 

&gt; Enter our Hammy of the tale about 22st (about 300lbs, 139kg)

&gt; Has brought a family bag of Doritos and cheap store brought cider.
&gt; Is also wearing a low cut top that doesn't suit her and has folds coming out.

&gt;Hammy zones in on me, noticing I am no longer the fat girl I used to be.

&gt; Instead of doing what everyone else did that night, she decided to say other unpleasant things.

&gt; 'Oh AmieNight, are you ill?'

&gt; GayCookie is currently the man Hammy is trying to get on. 

&gt; Doesn't seem to mind the Gay part in his nickname.

&gt;GayCookei chimes in a rather drunk manner.

&gt; 'Yeah, AmieNight has been cycling twice a day for like an hour and a half. Her muscles are bloody impressive.' 

&gt; Hammy looks at me as if I'm dying a slow and painful death.

&gt; 'Oh, that's why you look sickly'.

&gt; 'You know exercising to much can damage your muscles'

Note: I always do proper warm ups and never over do it. My muscles were fine.

&gt;Starts to ramble about exercise and what men want.

&gt; 'You'll lose your womanly curves.'

&gt;'You'll be to thin for any man to want you.'

&gt;'Plus, men don't want hard muscles. They want something soft and curvy.'

&gt;'Surely all this exercise is making you look sick.'

&gt; At this point I'm ready to smack a bitch.

&gt; But behold, a wild GayCookie appeared.

&gt;'Shut up Hammy! AmieNight looks healthy, just because you're jealous about how it would take three of AmieNight to get to your mass, doesn't mean you can keep hassling her!'

1368124203.0	1e0llv	THIS MILKSHAKE IS ROTTEN	walnutwhale	410	62	88	"I'm bad at writing in green text, so I'm just going to tell all of you a story. Ready? Gather around and listen to the stories of the QUEEN of hambeasts.

When I was 15/16 years old, I worked my very first job at a fast food restaurant that was known for two things: 

1) Being like a 50s drive in, where people would bring your food out to you on skates.

2) Our ""carnival"" food - like corn dogs. We also had a massive, massive selection of ice cream options (which 16 year old me reveled in, and with my super fast metabolism I never gained a pound... ah, to be young again)

Due to the nature of food we served and the ultimate lazy factor - stay in your car and MAKE SKINNY PEOPLE BRING YOU FOOD - we attracted some incredible specimens.

Now, I've always been raised to be non judgmental and kind to all, but there was this one woman - oh, this woman. She and her husband (who I'm pretty sure was her cousin) would roll up EVERY DAY in their van, 3 roly poly disabled children in tow. The collective gusts of their labored breathing as I walked up to their car window nearly blew me over, and the stench - my god the smell. It was atrocious. Like a mixture between rotten milk, bodily fluids, and dead animals. Their van was piled with trash from fast food visits past; their hair hung long and stringy in a botched homage to a newborn Orc. The woman wore the same thing every visit - a stained Mickey Mouse t-shirt and spandex leggings - and it made me wonder if she was, in fact, actually part of the van at that point. 

Now, I have a few times with this family that stand out to me. The first was the ""milkshake incident"".

Every day, they'd order about $80 dollars worth of food. Chili cheese dogs, breakfast burritos, 15 hamburgers (extra mayo), a veritable bucket of fries, etc. Since we were famous for ice cream, everyone in the smell-van would order our biggest size of milkshake - or slush - or malt - or whatever their black holes desired that day. On this particular summer afternoon, queen landwhale opened her trembling jowels and demanded a milkshake made in our biggest cup: 44ounces. 44ounces of milk and ice cream. After I had informed her that our machines couldn't blend in a cup that big and she had a fit, she ordered our biggest size for milkshakes: 32 ounces.

All was well as they munched away happily... until her voice came over the loudspeaker, thick with flehm. ""MY MILKSHAKE'S ROTTEN."" She screeched. 

Sighing, I skated out to her van. She shoved the cup at me - the entire thing was gone except for a small dribble at the bottom. ""MY MILKSHAKE'S ROTTEN, I WANT ANOTHER FOR FREE."" Her voice threatened to blow me over - I felt like Leia confronting Jabba the Hutt. Her husband cackled next to her like Salacious Crumb.

""Ma'am."" I leveled her reasonably, breathing through my mouth. ""Ma'am, you drank the entire thing. And there's no way this milkshake could be rotten - we would have noticed when making it.""

She narrowed her beady eyes at me, perspiration dripping down her neanderthal forehead as the gears in her head slowly turned. Suddenly, something clicked and she threw the cup at me with a warcry, rolling up her window and speeding - er, slowly driving - out of the parking lot.

With the remnants of ""rotten milkshake"" on me, I dejectedly wandered back to work.

That's the first lady hambeast story.

The second? I don't want to go into too much detail with this one to spare your stomachs, but... I only saw our lovely landwhale exit her vehicle ONE time (thus dispelling my notion that she was grown into the seat). Today she had slightly changed up her warddrobe: still the Mickey Mouse t-shirt, but this time she was wearing spandex shorts instead of leggings. Her cottage cheese thighs rippled like oceans as she slowly - SLOOOWLY - lumbered out of her vehicle and into our public bathroom.

I took two or three orders out and she was still in there, but I thought little of it - perhaps she was having a hard time ripping the spandex from her body.

Finally, she emerged - and there was *something* dribbling down her thigh.

Something brown.

Oh. Oh NO.

I tried to skate by her as quickly as possible, but she honed in on me. ""Yer bathroom's a mess."" She grunted, crawling back into her portable feeding lair and departing the premises.

I wanted to cry. I knew it was going to be bad, but... as the acting shift lead, I cautiously ventured my way into the bathroom. I opened the door, breath held, terror gripping me.

I felt like I was looking at a historical photograph of war time terror acts.

There was feces - and blood (yes, that kind of blood) - ALL OVER THE BATHROOM. Streaks of it across the seat, a dribble along the floor to the sink - and more IN the sink. Poop smeared handprints lined the walls. 

The bile raised in my throat.

I quit that job shortly thereafter. "	t5_2vzax	True
1372828557.0	1hjstm	The Tree, the trailer, and the hamplanet part II - They’re still here.	wtfitsaries	458	106	124	"Jigglybitch and Slowbro IV


**Note- ObliviousGamer or OG is now “Ash”, thanks to /u/ChaoticEvil**

Alright, it part one we left off around noon, when I rolled out of bed to find the fridge devoid of food, and the hamplanet still covered in butter and sprawled out in her underwear. 

&gt;I wake her ass up, ask what happened to all the food. 

&gt;She makes her “teehee” ridden excuses. 

&gt;I tell her to put some fucking clothes on before I lose my eyesight, and everything I have ever eaten. 

&gt;I abandon my quest for coffee, and decide to take a shower. Maybe scrub my eyes of the sight of her horrific currrrves. 

&gt;Ash and Slowbro are still asleep. 

&gt; I take an extra-long shower, as hot as it will go just to feel “clean” after that encounter. 

&gt; Get out of the shower, brush teeth/wash face, wrap a towel around me and decide to wake up Ash for some possible sexytimes. 

&gt;Walk across house, noticing JB’s absence from the living room. 

&gt;She’s probably just stuffing her face with whatever is left in the pantry. 

&gt;Open door to Ash’s room..

&gt; Are you fucking kidding me. 


Can anyone guess why I’m so pissed off? Anyone? Show of hands?


&gt;Yep, that’s right. In Ash’s bed, still in her underwear, getting butter all over my pillows was everyone’s favorite shebeast. 

&gt;rage mode: Engaged. 

&gt; I grab some clothes, annoyed that I am missing sexytimes to deal with this pile of goo, and go to the end of the bed. 

&gt;I quietly wake up Ash, motion for him to be quiet, and have him scoot out of my way.

&gt;I climb into bed with jigglybitch for what I can hope to odin will be the only time in my life. 

&gt;I sit sideways, back to the wall, one foot against her ass, one at the top of her back. 

&gt;I brace myself against the wall, and push as hard as I can. 

&gt; *THUMP*  The monster hits the floor. 

&gt;I grin triumphantly, while Ash is doubled over in laughter.

&gt;Jigglybitch lets out a shriek so loud, I assume the entire county heard it. 

&gt; “YOU *BITCH*. HOW DARE YOU, YOU KNOW I HAVE BACK PROBLEMS, YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME. I OUGHTA KICK YOUR SKANKY ASS. I’M GONNA REPORT YOU FOR ASSAULT. BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH”

&gt;I missed the second half of her ridiculous rant, because I was laughing too hard. 

&gt; SlowBro comes in, I assume her impact with the floor shook him out of his chair. 

&gt;wonders what is going on. 

&gt; “YOUR FUCKING SISTER JUST PUSHED ME OUT OF BED FOR NO GODDAMNED REASON. SHE TRIED TO KILL ME. YOU KNOW I HAVE BACK PROBLEMS. BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH.. WHAT ARE **YOU** GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

&gt; Slowbro gives blank stare. 

&gt; I grin. “Hey, Jigglybitch, where are your clothes..?”

&gt;Jigglybitch looks panicked. 

&gt;Realizes she’s not wearing anything but bra/panties.

&gt; She frantically tries to cover her massive rolls, but her t-rex arms couldn’t manage much.

&gt;Jigglybitch used “hide”

&gt; But it wasn’t very effective. 

&gt;Jigglybitch calls us all perverts for looking at her glorious rolls. 

&gt;Jigglybitch is out of useable excuses…

&gt;… Jigglybitch whited out. 


Nah, just kidding. She actually did call us all perverts, grabbed the bed sheet which I JUST WASHED, and wrapped it around her. 


&gt;Me- “So do you want to explain to your boyfriend why you were mostly naked in another guys bed?”

&gt; “MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, BITCH.” Turns to Slowbro “I WAS ON THE COUCH BUT YOUR STUPID SISTER WOKE ME UP, AND MY BACK WAS HURTING SO BAD I DECIDED TO LAY DOWN IN HERE teehee.  I MUST HAVE GOTTEN HOT LAST NIGHT teehee AND FORGOT TO PUT MY CLOTHES BACK ON.” 

&gt;Slowbro looks at Ash, “Don’t look at me dude, I was asleep.”

&gt;Slowbro just sighs, and leaves the room. 

&gt; Jigglybitch gets a strange look on her face. 

&gt;Not sure if trying to be seductive, or trying not to shit her pants. 

&gt;erm, well, panties.. and the bedsheet. 

&gt; “DON’T LOOK ALL EMBARRASSED ASH, *YOU* CAN LOOK ALL YOU WANT. I WAS IN YOUR BED, WE BOTH KNOW I SAW YOUR teehee *PROBLEM* teehee” as she moves her gaze down to his dick. 

&gt; Ash immediately moves himself behind me. 

&gt; “It was first thing in the fucking morning, and it was SUPPOSED to be my girlfriend laying next to me. Plus, I was fucking asleep. 

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST SAYING THAT NOW BECAUSE WTFITSARIES IS IN THE ROOM. YOU KNOW YOU WANT AAAALLL OF THIS.”

&gt;Ash gags. 

&gt;Me- “Alright, listen here bitch. Getting into bed with someone when you aren’t clothed, and they are asleep, is fucking sexual harassment. Just because a guy has morning wood, doesn’t mean they want you. His eyes were fucking closed. Notice how he no longer has a boner? it’s because he’s seen you. Now, if you don’t put some fucking clothes on, I’m afraid he will never get a boner again.”

&gt; JB storms out of the room. 

&gt;Any hope of sexytimes has been ruined. 

&gt; I send Ash out to get some food, since she ate everything in the house. 

&gt;Specifically tell him not to get any food for Slowbro and Jigglybitch, because they’re fucking adults and can fend for themselves. 

&gt;He returns with two subway footlongs, and 2 cookies. 

&gt;fuckyeahfood!

&gt;Doorbell rings. 

&gt;Open door to see pizza guy, carrying 2 large pizza’s, a 2L of Mtn Beetus, and a smaller box of what I guessed was cinnamon sticks or something. 

&gt;uh, wat. “Sorry, I didn’t order any food.”

&gt;“OH teehee THAT’S MINE!”

&gt; Waddles towards now terrified pizza guy. 

&gt; “I thought you were broke, how the hell are you paying for this?”

&gt; Pizza guy- “It’s already paid for” as he hands her the pizza and backs away, not even waiting for a tip.

&gt; “Okay, how the fuck *did* you pay for all of this.”

&gt; “OH teehee I CALLED THEM BECAUSE I WAS STARVING AND MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS LOW, AND YOU GUYS WERE SELFISH AND GET US FOOD EVEN THOUGH YOU GOT YOURSELVES SOME. I TOLD THEM MY ORDER, AND THE ADDRESS, AND THEY SAID THEY HAD A DEBIT CARD ON FILE SO I TOLD THEM JUST TO USE THAT.”

&gt;Ash puts down his delicious sub, realizing what she was saying. 

&gt; “You used my *debit card* for $40 worth of fucking *dominos* without even ASKING ME?!”

&gt; “I DIDN’T THINK YOU WOULD MIND SINCE WE’RE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS, I’LL PAY YOU BACK teehee”

&gt; “Alright, where’s my $40?”

&gt; “I DIDN’T MEAN TODAY! GOD YOU’RE SO INSENSITIVE. WE JUST HAD A *TREE* FALL ON OUR *TRAILER* WE COULD HAVE *DIED* AND YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT $40. GOD, YOU’RE SO SELFISH. 

&gt; “That’s 40 out of my grocery money for the week, we don’t all get fucking food stamps. Some of us actually work for a goddamn living.”

&gt; “I’M SORRY MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS LOW I HAVE A CONDITION, IF I DON’T EAT RIGHT NOW I COULD PASS OUT AND GO INTO A COMA”

&gt; Me “Have you ever even checked your blood sugar? Because I’d guess it probably hovers in the low 300’s.. “

&gt;I receive a dirty look, but she is too busy stuffing her face to reply. 

&gt; I give up on the lost cause, and go back to the kitchen, where I put half of my sub, and the cookie in the fridge for after work. 

&gt;Tell Slowbro and Jigglybitch not to eat it. 

&gt;I get ready for work, put on my ohsosexy fast food uniform, and throw my hair in a ponytail.

&gt;Took 5 minutes. 

&gt;Come back out, see Jigglybitch consuming said cookie. 

&gt; I look at the pizza boxes, strewn across the floor from their brutal massacre. 

&gt; “Did you eat 2 fucking large pizzas, and cinnamon sticks?”

&gt; “WELL SLOWBRO HELPED teehee HE HAD 3 SLICES.”

&gt; “And you ate the rest?”

&gt; “I HADN’T EATEN ALL DAY! teehee”

&gt; “After all 10,000 of those calories, you are stuffing the cookie I was saving in to your mouth?”

&gt; “PIZZA IS HEALTHY, IT HAS GRAINS AND DAIRY AND TOMATO PASTE WHICH COUNTS AS A VEGETABLE. BESIDES YOUR COOKIE WAS BROKEN, EVERYONE KNOWS BROKEN COOKIES DON’T HAVE CALORIES”

&gt; Wat.


I don’t even argue with her, because it’s time for Ash to take me to work . He tells them he has to leave, and when he comes back he’s gonna take a nap because he works tonight, so they gotta leave now too. They grab their bags, and her bottles of beetus, and leave the house. And that is the end of part II.

1369600873.0	1f3kkh	Skinny Hamplanets At The Pool		421	78	61	"A short one: Last summer I went to the pool every day it was open, and this summer I intend to do the same. Sometimes I go twice in a day, the kids love it. 

Today we were there for our second time, enjoying the rays and the water. Woman and her friends + their kids are there that I recognize from last year. Our kids all play, all is good. 

All of the women (three of them) are about mid-20's, so my age, average weight. The main one I remember has gained a bit since last year, but nothing major. They sit by the pool the whole two hours, not getting in once, and eating the whole time. 

Every thirty minutes (no joke) the main woman forced her daughter (about 4-years-old) out of the pool to eat. Sugar filled drinks, candy, sandwiches on white bread, these weird roll things that look kind of like pizza rolls or something. Over and over again. 

The girl keeps crying about being constantly pulled out to eat, says she isn't hungry. Mom snarls (seriously) at her to stop being a brat and eat, or she isn't getting back in. 

Her one friend without kids there points out that she has eaten quite a lot. 

""She's skinny, it doesn't matter,"" her mother loudly replies.

1370251342.0	1fklo6	My first clinical day as a nursing assistant.	a_drunk_redditor	413	66	83	"It might not seem like an FPS at first, but trust me it is.

So my senior year in high school I took a nursing assistant class. I lived about 2 miles away from my high school, but I had to go to a different local high school for the nursing class then I go back to my high school for the rest of my classes. Schools are about 7 miles apart. Class started at 6:30AM and 6:00AM on clinical days. Every Wednesday and Thursday we would go to the local hospital (which was right across the street from the high school). This is the story about my first day in clinicals, which is the in person training basically.

&gt; Get to hospital at 6:00AM

&gt; Super nervous

&gt; Get assigned patient, discuss them, their issues, and any problems we might encounter

&gt; Since its our first day we get two people per patient.

&gt; Get paired with good friend

&gt; Shes only 4'11"" and about 80 pounds.

&gt; I'm 5'8"", 180 pounds, fairly muscular, not much fat

&gt; I lift

&gt; Our patient is middle aged lady, rectal cancer

&gt; Walk into the room

&gt; [My eyes don't realize what is happening](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nonsense.gif)

&gt; Largest lady I ever saw laying on the bed

&gt; Call her Hamplanet Patient or HPP

&gt; This wasn't in the patient assignment sheet

&gt; Ask nurse

&gt; Says shes 600 pounds, needs a bed bath badly

&gt; She has bloody poops all over her backside

&gt; Oh god no.

&gt; Not on my first day.

&gt; Worst nightmare, came alive.

&gt; At least it can never get worst.

&gt; Why hath thou forsaken me, o' great one?

&gt; [MFW the nurse says that me and this tiny girl need to turn her onto her side to start cleaning her.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dr-evil-right.gif)

&gt; Spend 20 minutes trying to turn her over

&gt; She woke up, fell back asleep when we were trying to turn her over

&gt; Can't wake her up

&gt; Get our nursing instructor to help us with the patient

&gt; She looks just as shocked as we did

&gt; Need a 4th body to help out

&gt; Get her nurse

&gt; Eventually get her turned over

&gt; Use 10 washclothes to clean her

&gt; Not enough

&gt; Must have used close to 25 washcloths just on her back and he butt

&gt; All the sudden I feel a warm sensation on my stomach and arms.

&gt; Oh god. No.

&gt; This couldn't have happened.

&gt; [MFW HPP gets shits bloody projectile shit all over the front of my scrubs and arms.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif)

&gt; I have to wash her all over again and myself.

&gt; Eventually get her completely washed. Took over an hour with four people.

&gt; Continue doing morning care on her.

&gt; Comb hair, order breakfast, brush teeth. 

&gt; Doctor comes in. Stand off to the side.

&gt; She was admitted the night earlier. Must be a regular.

&gt; Doctor asks what she eats.

&gt; She kept a food diary.

&gt; Doctor invites me and my partner to look over the diary with him.

&gt; Shocked, doctors generally don't even acknowledge the Nursing Assistants, but he wants to teach us?

&gt; Might have heard from the nurse my terrible displeasure earlier.

&gt; The diary consists of fast food, soda, candy.

&gt; Thought it was her food for a month.

&gt; It was for a single week.

&gt; Doctors says she needs to eat healthier and lose weight. Her diet was a major factor in her cancer -- which is almost in remission. Don't know how.

&gt; ""I'm just going to get a lap band surgery. Then I can eat what ever I want without worry.""

&gt; The fatlogic defies me.

&gt; Doctor, ""Look, it doesn't exactly work that --""

&gt; HPP, ""Just because you're a doctor doesn't mean what you say is right. I don't care what you have to say. I'm getting a lapband and then everything will be better.""

&gt; [Our faces when](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/question-mark.gif)

&gt; More arguing.

&gt; Doctor leaves.

&gt; Continue doing morning care.

&gt; Breakfast arrives.

&gt; Fruits, gluten free pancakes, skim milk.

&gt; Looks good, wish I had it.

&gt; She says she won't eat any of it. 

&gt; Try to convince her.

&gt; She literally forces the tray into my partners hands.

&gt; Don't know what to do. 

&gt; Get nursing instructor.

&gt; We get back into the room.

&gt; Need to call her nurse.

&gt; She is already halfway through the candy bar.

&gt; Suddenly

&gt; 2 and a half hour shift ends.

&gt; Oh thank god.

&gt; Get out of there as soon as possible.

1367202898.0	1db90m	The Chronicles of Lardnia: The Diamon’ the Itch and the Lardglobe	ConfectionAffection	461	110	72	"TL;DR My socially inept high school self comes face to face with the lardbeast Lardnia, who has a global gut, an unfortunate itch, and a diamon’ ring. She flirts, I resist her curve~~s~~ (somehow), I escape to fight hambeastiality another day. 

This is the first installment of a series of encounters with the foul, female hambeast Lardnia, so named because it matched the pun in the title (don’t judge me muh curvy Redditors, thinkin’ too hard makes muh beetus flare up). This is the story of how I met her in my second week of high school during lunchtime—coincidentally her favorite time of the day.

&gt;Be me


&gt;Be 8/10, scrawny, gay (not out), in an unfamiliar environment with no real friends and a serious case of social anxiety


&gt;Be sitting in the glass partition between the hall and the front of my school, sitting with three female mangahams that had recently been kind enough to invite me into their circle


&gt;My homosense begins to tingle, signaling a large area of space devoid of taste, style, or deodorant approaching slowly from behind


&gt;I glance to the side, noting two long, skinny yet somehow shapeless, legs the color of Bavarian cream moving past me on the other side of the glass


&gt;I refuse to look up, but lo! The hambeast approaches


&gt;Ripping the door from its hinges, she lumbers into the room, exclaiming through a mouthful of Snackpack pudding, “Haaaaaiiiii guuuuuyttttthhhh!!”


&gt;In horror, I realize she is friends with my mangaham companions, and intends to join us for lunch


&gt;”Hi,” states Hamtasia, the leader mangaham of our group, in an offhand voice


&gt;I gather Hamtasia cares less for Lardnia that fatties care for pool parties without refreshments, I still refuse to look up 


&gt;”Ohhhhh, who’th thith guy here?! Dinnit know you guyth were hangin’ out with boyth thethe dayth!”


&gt;Realizing she means me, I look up… and then up some more, forcing myself to stifle a gasp


&gt;Hamtasia begins begrudging introductions as I take in all that is Lardnia


&gt;Standing at 6’0 and weighing in at 280lbs, the beast has a face resembling a massive pile of mashed potatoes full of bacon bits (acne like I had scarcely witnessed before) covered by thick rimmed, round, grease covered glasses


&gt;Lardnia has no neck, she has no boobs, she has no ass


&gt;What she does have is a gut of global proportions, rounded from the side, but somehow square from a frontal perspective


&gt;Her long chicken legs bent somehow a bit backward at the knees, her arms short and thin as Jacks Links


&gt;A curtain of greasy hair fell past her shoulder blades in the back, cascading over her face and hiding her non-existent bosom in the back


&gt;[MFW](http://www.badhaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/han-solo-shocked-e1362167609917.jpg) Lardnia’s body was an [AT-ST]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/Star_Wars_All_Terrain_Scout_Transport.jpg), her greasy hair covered face bearing a striking similarity to [Chewbacca]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Chewbacca-2-.jpg) emerging from the top bellowing to us unintelligibly


&gt;Lardnia pivots and begins to fall backwards towards me


&gt;She lands on her tiny ass inches from my right arm, shattering the panes out of the partition and creating a sonic boom that deafens me in one ear


&gt;She slaps her Hungry Man frozen dinner on the floor, and unpacks the rest of her lunch: two cans of diet coke, a family sized bag of Funyuns, 4 vanilla Snackpacks and 2 massive gas station M&amp;M cookies


&gt;Lardnia pulls out a ninja manga, opens it and begins waging a one-handed War on Lunch, a weapon of mass consumption. The Hungry Man chicken crunched in the middle, still paritially frozen


&gt;lardniadontgiveashit.jpeg


&gt;Her BO bitchslaps me in the face, giving me a black eye


&gt;Through my watering eyes, I see her crack open snackpack #1, breaking a cookie in half and shovel the pudding and a quarter of a cookie into her eager maw


&gt;Throughout the carnage, she gives me sideward glances accompanied by small “teehees”


&gt;Her fluttering eyelashes do nothing but fan her retched odor towards my disintegrating olfactory receptors. I fight for consciousness


&gt;The massacre ends after 5 minutes, taps playing in the background


&gt;With a sigh of temporary contention, Lardnia leans towards me showing me her manga, pointing to a character on the page leaving a Funyun grease fingerprint, exclaiming:


&gt;”Ya know, ya remind me of [male manga character], he’th totally cool and thuper cute terr, teehee!”


&gt;”Effrebuddy thayth I look jutht like [female manga character], they’re totally in luv, teehee!”


&gt;Sensing danger, my mind clears itself of the BO-induced haze


&gt;”Tread carefully, AffectionConfection, tread very carefully” thinks I


&gt;”Ah… cool” I manage to say


&gt;The muffled sound of crusty fingernails scratching cloth is then heard. “Dafuq?” thinks I


&gt;The upper arm of Lardnia’s free hand is in rhythmic locomotion


&gt;I note that Lardnia has a Funyun encrusted paw beneath her lard globe


&gt;Ah… Lardnia has a feminine itch


&gt;My mind reels in revulsion


&gt;The never-healing woman-wound is a foreign and unpleasant object in my mind, but my imagination refuses to surmise the hell-hole that must surely be a Lardgina


&gt;Oblivious to my disgust, but realizing I am unfazed my her mangaflirtations, the beast switches strategies


&gt;”Ya thee, ConfectionAffection, my huthband died in Ere-ack and I jutht really need a man tho that I won’t be thad anymerr. Ma nighths really get lon-er-ly without him.”


&gt;*Scratch scratch*


&gt;”He gave me thith diamon’ ring, it was thuuuuuper expenthive, but he jutht loved me thooo mutch. Ah been real deprethed since he bin gawn. Thee muh ring, right here?” 


&gt;Wrenching her gina-scratchin paw from under her globe, she shows me a ring on her right hand (dat be da wrong hand, fatty). It appears to me homemade, a length on wire twisted several times around her pudgy finger with a ~~rhinestone~~ ~~glass~~ plastic cube in it.

&gt; Be  me, join sorority in college


&gt; Sorority I joined isn't big on denying based on looks. Sisters are thin, fat and everything in between. No super fatties


&gt;Enter the baconator


&gt;Nice enough, but no fun,  generally a party pooper


&gt;Interests include: herself, webmd symptom checker, KFC




This is all fine, but our sorority goes to regional conferences, with sisters from like 8 states. This is where the story begins

&gt; go to conference. Do sorority stuff  all day till lunch break


&gt; the particular college hosting the conference has a bunch of food shops at the top of their campus.


&gt;all other sisters get bagels, sandwiches salads, aka normal people food


&gt;not the baconator. She comes back with a giant gift basket of chocolate sweets from the candy shop. Complete with gift wrapping


&gt;noneofmy.biz


&gt;eats everything but the basket


&gt;claims her anxiety medicine makes her not want to eat, so she lets herself eat whatever looks good, just so she'll eat ""something""


&gt;the delusion is strong with this one


&gt;more sorority stuff


&gt; later we go as a chapter to buy T-Shirts from the conference.


&gt;they have small, medium, large and extra large. 


&gt;baconator asks for men's xxl. Lady says only the shirts are ladies cut style. Only women would be buying sorority shirts, so it makes sense.


&gt; frustrated hambeast asks for woman's xxxl. Lol nope, they only carry people sizes


&gt;Baconator throws a fit. Says my sorority encourages eating disorders by holding women to ""unrealistic expectations"" 


&gt; didn't know lady's extra large  was unrealistic, but whatever 


&gt; everyone stares, so we leave early


&gt;turn the music up on the ride home to drown out her requests to stop for McDonald's

I think maybe it's time we reevaluate letting landplanets into our sorority

1374670871.0	1iybn7	Part IIIa: Flabpotamus gets a crush part 1	lemurella	463	119	43	"[Part I](http://redd.it/1ixzae)

[Part II](http://redd.it/1iy5ms)

**Part IIIa: Flabpotamus gets a crush part 1**

 Here we introduce DoctorBro, one of the partners of the practice, who was really cool, loved medicine, and would frequently get excited about it to Steve Irwin proportions. 

Pertinent to this part of the story is that I am studying 2nd year medicine at this point. Doctorbro makes an effort to show me interesting cases – if the patient is comfortable with it, and talk about his different theories and such.

Flabpotamus has focused her tractor beam eyes on DoctorBro, and whenever she sees him she puts on this whole duckfacing, eyelash batting, sugarcoated beetusflirt act. Poor DoctorBro is recently divorced, and so (according to FatFuck) fair game. She listens with great interest whenever he and one of the other doctors or nurses are chatting about a new treatment or interesting case, interjecting to say “oh isn’t that amazing” yes, penicillin comes from mould, “isn’t that wonderful” yes, broken bones heal. And then makes some lame excuse to make an appointment to see him because she suffers from a similar ailment to what they are discussing. 

She learns that he does cosmetic collagen filler injections and guess what? – she needs to have her lips injected. According to NurseBro, who assisted, she was making heaps of flirty comments of awfulness, which DoctorBro seemed to be completely oblivious to. She said at one point “Oh, I would never get botox around my lips, I need to be able to purse them to you know, pleasure a man orally”, at which DoctorBro nonchalantly asked her to stop talking so he could do the injections.

We were blessed for the next few weeks by her increased pouting and duckface, surgically enhanced.

Anyway, she starts to notice that DoctorBro and I have little meetings, often after my shift has finished and he has finished with his patients. She does not know (as it is none of her business) that I study medicine.

She spots us walking out of his office one day and raised her eyebrows as far and as long as her poor muscles can work against gravity with that much forehead fat.

Soon I start to hear the accusations. She never points to me directly, but makes suggestions about DoctorBro’s new young lover. Everyone’s eyebrows raise and someone says “good for him”. But according to Flabbers she’s just a skinny whore and slut. Also she is not well educated and has an admin job. Flabs starts to call her (me) ""The Sexatary"". She’s just a rebound and he will then bound back for a real, smart woman like her. Whenever I am in the tearoom she talks about how men think they want younger women but we aren’t as sexually experienced and so those relationships never work out and always end with older women. She starts to make it into a story about how DoctorBro left his wife for the young slut (me), and tells me to watch out if DoctorBroEx ever comes into the clinic to see him or do something for their teenage children. She’ll pop out of her dungeon and waddle over to the desk and, say in a spittle strewn stage whisper “Oh, watch out, the woman spurned is here. You better hide, Lemurella.”


When this happens my co-workers generally look at me blankly then go back to their work, none of them buy what she is trying to insinuate.


It culminates to one day when DoctorBro and I are in his office talking about some sort of medical thing, me with a heavy textbook and him showing me something on the interwebs. The door flies open without a knock and in bursts Flabpotamus, huffing and puffing from the walk up the hallway.
She stammers when she sees us obviously clothed and not partaking in any sort of sexual congress.

&gt;“Excuse me,” says DoctorBro.

&gt;“Oh, I, I didn’t expect to see you here Lemurella,” she says 

&gt; of course she expected to see me here, I saw her watching us with her beady little eyes when we went in to the office.

&gt;“Just what are you doing here, anyway?” she snarls “Aren’t you meant to be on the phones?” She like to rub it in that I do a more menial job than her, and so she must be more intelligent than me.


&gt;DoctorBro pipes up “More to the point what are you doing here? Lemurella, whose shift is over, and I are actually going over some case files for her assignment.”

&gt;“What do you mean?”

&gt;“Lemurella is studying medicine. I’m helping her out with an assignment.”

&gt;“Oh...I”

&gt;“And what did you want?”

&gt;“Oh, um, Mr Jeffries cancelled his glucose tolerance test and rebooked it for next week is that okay?”

&gt;“Of course that’s okay. You don’t need to interrupt me with that kind of thing. Now please leave us alone.”

&gt;She grunts and closes the door. When we can hear that she has waddled out of ear shot, DB apologises to me and says “I don’t know how much longer I can put up with that disgusting woman flirting with me.”

I am amazed – I didn’t know he’d even noticed. Such is his professional detachment and good bedside manner.

&gt;“No seriously,” he says “I’ve seen some pretty nasty stuff – gangrenous feet, haematemesis (vomiting blood), and lots and lots of poo, but nothing has made me gag more than that woman.”

&gt;I smirk the smirkiest smirk I can smirk.

**TL;DR Flabs sounds her mating call for DoctorBro, harrasses me for supposedly stealing him away, and attempts to catch us in the act.**

&gt;Be me, former fatty (5'9"" 235lb) cutencreepy, now not so hammy (5'9"" 145lb) bikini competitor and personal trainer.

&gt;Horray, it's my daughter's sixth birthday!  

&gt;I love my kid.  What can I do to show her how awesome she is?

&gt;I know!  I'll let her invite as many little kids as she wants to her party and I'll let her decide what food we serve.

&gt;[mfw](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10413) she requests a cake with no icing, fruit and veggie trays, cold cut and cheese trays, and ""No pop, Mummy!  It hurts my tummy.""  So proud of that healthy-ish party choice.

&gt;It's the day of the party.

&gt;No one in this freakin' town understands the courtesy of the RSVP.  Whatevs.  I'll have supplies for 12 little girls.  I hope we don't get all 20 showing up.

&gt;[mfw](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=6443) 12 girls show up.  I am a junior party god!

&gt;11 of the girls are lovely little things.  I get my daughter to give them the tour of the house and then set them loose to run around screaming.  Little girls run around and scream at parties.  A lot.  There may be games of ""Zombie Princess"".

&gt;Am enjoying the mayhem and look of horror on the faces of my husband and son when the doorbell rings.

&gt;I answer it and behold Hamela Junior.

&gt;She's six.  I know she's six because my daughter told me so.  Why the fuck is she built like a mini linebacker?

&gt;Whatever.  Maybe it's just baggie clothes.

&gt;I send Hamela Junior to play with the other little girls while I work on slicing strawberries for the angel food cake.  If I can keep them out of the kitchen for 20 minutes I can finish the cake and stay on track.

&gt;[LOL NOPE!](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=9396)  I hear a noise.  Look, it's Hamela Junior!  She's grabbed handfuls of food and is alternating shoveling them into her mouth!

&gt;I break up her one-person feeding frenzy, get her a cute little pink plate of veggies, dip, and meat and send her outside to play.

&gt;5 minutes later I turn around again:  Look!  It's Hamela Junior!  She's found the dip!  She's fucking eating it with a goddamn spoon, because to hell with the inefficient dip transport medium that is known as a ""baby carrot"".

OK.  Right now let's just cut through the next hour.  It involves my husband staring in disbelief at a kid who won't stop snarfelling every fucking bit of finger food that she can reach.  

&gt;[HFW](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=7460) the girl.  Won't. Stop. Eating.

&gt;Whatever.  I service cake.  Homemade angel cake with ice cream (health conscious is one thing but denying ice cream at a six year old's birthday party is a dangerous thing that could end up with you being trampled by many pairs of small shoes decorated with sequins and flashing lights).  There are also strawberries.

&gt;Hamela Junior eats two servings of cake and ice cream.  She also complains that another little girl got special ice cream all to herself.

Another note:  That little girl is lactose intolerant.  I got her a little container of almond-based dairy substitute.  I'm a junior party god, remember?

&gt;OK.  All the small (and the one not-so-small) kids have had cake and ice cream and are back outside.  I will relax with my husband.

&gt;[Wait, guess who's back at the snack table?](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=8462)  OK, I am past caring.  I cannot stop this kid from eating but I can at least stop her from sticking her sausage-like fingers into the dip.  I serve her more food and send her outside again.

&gt;Only an hour left of this party.  [I got this](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10285).

&gt;Hamela Junior comes in, whining and demanding ice cream. Sure, ice cream for everyone!  I get the kids to line up with bowls and dish it out.

&gt;1 (guess who was first in line?), 2, 3, 4 (the line is moving swiftly), 5, 6 ... WTF!  Hamela is back in line with an empty bowl!  Fine.  [Whatever.  I give up.](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10081)

&gt;7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 (Hamela made an extra trip!) and done!    Or not.  Guess who's back with an empty bowl. 

&gt;[No.  I am done.](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10187)

&gt;Sorry Hamela Junior!  No more ice cream!

&gt;Such a look of pain on her face.  ""Why not?"" demands the pint-sized porker.

&gt;""We're saving some for later!""

&gt;She scowls.  [I do not feel bad.](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=8663).

&gt;She then goes and asks my husband to serve her more ice cream.  He also [refuses to indulge Hamela Junior any more](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10300).

And then the magic hour arrives!  Parents come to pick up their kids! I receive sticky hugs and ""thank you"" from 11 happy little girls, who have played and eaten and chased after my son screaming like he's some sort of preteen pop star.

Then it's Hamela Junior's turn to leave.  Her mother, who I can't even describe besides saying that I am really impressed at her bra - it squashed roughly 60lb of sweaty chest fat into cleavage that was dressed up to right under her chins.

&gt;Hamela Junior grunts, grabs her goody bag, turns to her mother and says ""MUUUUHHHMMM!  I'm so hungry!  Can we stop at *not McD because our town is too small for high end beetus burger joints* for some foood?!""

&gt;Hamela Senior clutches her precious mini lard beast to her enormously uplifted cleavage and gives me death glares.  I am clearly an evil wench who starves small children!

[Really?](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=8024)

**The final shock**

&gt;Asked my daughter if she liked her party.

&gt;She responds with ""Yes, Mum, but it was really yucky when Hamela Junior ate the leftover cake and melted ice cream.  It was on the ground and there were ants on it.""

fin.

TL:DR  Six year old hamplanet in training ate everything she could get her greasy hands on, including melted ice cream that was covered in ants.

1362709358.0	19vxgx	Thyroid Excuse	anonymous1008	387	41	53	"This is long, but I threw in a fps at the end:
I was born into a skinny, health-conscious family, and I’ve tried to follow my parent’s example my whole life. When I was in high school I suddenly started gaining weight, even though I wasn’t eating differently. I was so exhausted all the time; I would walk upstairs to get something from my room and have to take a nap. 20 pounds later (150 lbs at 5’8) my mom insisted I go to the doctor. I tested positive for hypothyroidism, but since I was still going through puberty my doctor didn’t feel comfortable giving me medication that could interfere with my hormones. I was miserable, but after a few days I realized that if my metabolism wasn’t working as quickly as it used to, I probably didn’t need as many calories as I used to eat. I went from about 1,200 calories a day to 700, and the more I cut my calories, the more energy I had. I’m down to 128 lbs now and I feel great. 

Every time I hear a fatty say they have thyroid issues, I always want to walk up to them and say “me too” and see how they react. I wish everyone out there using their thyroid as an excuse for their weight would stop. And for anybody who has legitimate issues with their thyroid, know you’re not as helpless as you think. It may not be easy (or fun), but it’ll be worth it, I promise. :)  

FPS: I’m in my dorm making my friend’s favorite cookies for her birthday. I label them, put them on my desk, and go back into the kitchen to wash the cookie sheet. I come back to my landwhale roommate eating some of the cookies. When I confront her about it, she says “it’s ok, I exercised today”. How is that even logic?

1374947643.0	1j64tt	My Military Training with Robo-Fat, Part One: Fatty Can't Fit.	ArcticNightX	462	116	31	"I finally have an FPS submission of my own. Actually, I've had it repressed for 2 years, but now's a good time as any to get it out there. You know, like a fat person's gunt. Anyways, I'll preface this by saying that I am a veteran of the US Army, and this occurred during AIT--Advanced Individual Training (which is where you learn your military occupation), in Fort Gordon, Georgia.

In AIT, there are 3 phases, complete with perks for each. I should mention the training for my MOS was just under 20 weeks. When you come to AIT, you start as a Phase IV, that means, on weekends, you have formation at 6AM, 1PM, and 6PM. You also have fireguard (2-hour shifts just sitting and watching the hallways) on the weekends, you have to do lawn maintenance in the morning, and you can't go off post, or wear any civilian clothes. 

After 3 weeks, you can phase up to Phase V. You have to pass a room/dress uniform inspection, as well as display knowledge on various Army knowledge. With Phase V, you can go off post, wear civilians, and the only formation you have is at 1PM.  

The final phase, Phase V+, comes at 10 weeks. You have no formation, and all the previous perks mentioned. The best part is, all you have to pass is a locker inspection. 

Now, in my AIT, there was a guy in my class known for being a fat waste of space that we'll call Robo-Fat. Robo was 38 years old, in the middle of a divorce, and notorious for looking like a spitting image of James Earl Jones. It would all be well and good if he wasn't notorious for gaming the system. With this story in particular, he gamed the phase-up system. With phasing up, if you did not pass a PT test, you were not allowed the opportunity to phase up. However, if you went on medical profile after you failed your first PT test--typed statement saying certain injuries restrict you from doing exercise--you were given the opportunity to phase up. This story describes the first time he tried to phase up.

&gt; be me, new to the Army, just phased up with the rest of my class

&gt; I can wear civvies and I don't have to spend Saturday morning doing lawn detail with other newbies now. awwyiss.gif

&gt; going downstairs after class, getting something from vending machine to drink

&gt; hear heavy footsteps descending stairs behind me

&gt; motherfuckin' Robo-Fat

&gt; 5'10"" 275+ lbs. of lard...carrying his dress uniform on a hanger?

&gt; wtf when you try to phase up, you gotta wear that shit so they can see how it looks on you

&gt; oh lawd, all that junk food and general shit and lack of pt from his ""profile"" made him gain a fuckton of weight

&gt; don't care, friends and i laugh openly when he has to explain why he doesn't fit into his uniform

&gt; mfw i have no fucking face when he says his uniform shrank

&gt; mfw when the platoon sergeant and my friends have no fucking faces for his explanation

&gt; platoon sergeant very visibly angry, decides he doesn't want to waste his breath on yelling at robo-fat, tells him to go ahead inside the dayroom for the phase up test

&gt; [mfw](http://imgur.com/a/s16Zv#26) he ends up not passing because he couldn't be bothered to study

&gt; worth mentioning a kid half his age had to help him put his uniform together and clean his locker (was full of junk food, which is a huge no-no, video games, movies, a laptop and a small tv

TL;DR: Fatty games the system, cannot fit into dress uniform for inspection, ends up failing anyways.

Next up in the series, Robo-Fat ""attempts"" suicide as a result of failing the phase test.

So here is the [Venti Frappaccino](http://i.imgur.com/Dfn1lcy.jpg), White Chocolate flavoured, with whipped cream, extra caramel, and a brownie blended in (many a spaghetti was spilled asking for the last one). Manner can get you a long way though.

The cashier may or may not have heard me about the whipping cream part, though from past experience whipping cream is more sour than regular milk.

[Here is the receipt](http://i.imgur.com/PKGrW5T.jpg?1). As fast-food is a lot smaller and more expensive here in New Zealand, buying this made me hate the woman in the original story even more for not paying for all the ridiculous extras. Especially after she wasted more of the cashiers time.

Now to actually drinking it: It didn't actually taste that bad. It tasted a lot like [Cookies &amp; Cream Ice Cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookies_and_Cream), which makes me doubtful that she actually but whipping cream in here. In small doses it actually tastes good, but remember that this is Venti-size, so I gave up 3/4 of the way though and just gave it to a friend. There's no way I can ever imagine drinking an American-sized version of this. Let alone two, and with whipping cream.

&gt; be me 6', mid-30s and, at the time, 170 lbs. (i had started my diet and exercise regimen just a few months before.. down 15 from my highest weight)

&gt; recentlySingleGettingFitForDaLadies.montage

&gt; just arriving at the office, i pull into the parking lot and notice that even though i have stopped and put the transmission in park, it still feels like my car is moving, along with every other car in the parking lot, toward a central point near the front of the lot.

&gt; i look toward the front door of the building to see Pluto's missing moon, Hambert (6' 500+ lbs.), just about to enter.

&gt; pull emergency brake in hopes that will keep my car safe, grab my laptop bag and phone, then use the gravitational pull to fall toward the front door.

&gt; enter the door where immediately there is a stairwell to the 2nd floor office door

&gt; in the one minute it took me to get from parking my car to the stairs, Hambert has conquered a grand total of 3 steps and is almost to the first of 2 landings between flights

&gt; lookingAtWatch.gif

&gt; he's already breathing quite heavily and there's a distinct odor of sour milk, old bacon, and uncleaned body parts that probably haven't seen any water other than sweat in at least a decade.

&gt; i try to stay back a few steps to avoid being pulled into orbit and falling through his atmosphere, as he begins the next flight of steps.  i check my phone and work my best to not appear as if i'm in a hurry.

&gt; my plan fails as, 2 minutes later, he reaches the next landing, stuffs himself into the corner and motions for me to go ahead.

&gt; his breathing is equivalent to mine after i've finished playing a 45 minute half of soccer and his face is as red as a tomato.

&gt; Hambert: ""Go on ahead, &lt;breath&gt; my doctor said I should &lt;breath&gt; rest after a few steps &lt;breath&gt; because of my knees.""

&gt; knees.

&gt; knees?

&gt; he motions once again for me to try and squeeze by him.

&gt; deerInHeadlights.jpg

&gt; quite gingerly, i maneuver myself around him attempting to avoid contact (lest the smell be transferred), hold my breath, and begin walking up the last few steps to the 2nd floor.

&gt; as i scan my key card on the door to the offices i hear ""you young guys have it so easy not having to live with joint pain.""

First some back story: I met Popalopagus when I was about 6, at which time we became very good friends and were around the same size. By the time we were ten, she could no longer fit my jeans (though she tried, and always maintained we were around the same size). This first installment takes place when we are both around 14 or so, and she has ballooned into  [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-30763-body-shape.htm?StartAt=1#.UdTL0fn-E_8), while still claiming we are the same size. Meanwhile, I look like something like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-32812-body-shape.htm?StartAt=21#.UdTMtvn-E_8). I'm 25 now, so this story happened ages ago and for reasons that will become apparent I no longer associate with Popalopagus &amp; friends.

&gt;Be me, 14ish, 5'6"" about 130lbs and quite muscular.
&gt;Do not be Popalopagus, 5'7"" and about 300lbs.
&gt;Be hanging out with a group of your juvenile delinquent friends, having a laugh and generally behaving like little reprobates. 

&gt;EmoKid is Popalopagus's crush, he's about 5'8"" and super fit from his after school labouring job. We are all hanging out at the residence of Popalopagus and her brother (who I REALLY liked. We shall call him HotBro).

&gt;Everyone is hungry for some reason, so we decide to walk down to the shop to get delicious pies. Popalopagus doesn't want to walk the 5 minutes to get there, so we say we will get her a pie. She says she wants two pies, fair enough they are damn delicious.

&gt;Be me, leaving house with EmoKid, HotBro and WisdomSkinny (a tiny girl who's about 5'2"" and 90lbs, she's about 12 but super awesome so we hang out with her all the time). We reach the shop and obtain pies. 
&gt;I get one pie, WisdomSkinny gets her vegetarian pie, EmoKid gets two pies for himself because he has just come from his after school job where he did 3+ hours of heavy lifting and manual labour. HotBro gets a pie and we get two for Popalopagus.

walkinghomesinging.mp3

&gt;Arrive back at the house to find Popalopagus watching TV and eating popcorn and a delicious looking panini. ""I got hungry waiting for your guys, so I made a snack^Teehee"" she proceeds to offer us popcorn saying ""I don't mind if you guys have a little bit, but don't HOG it all,""
&gt;WisdomSkinny says she wants a drink first, but would like a little bit of popcorn.

&gt;Feeling thirsty, we all leave the pies on the coffee table near Popalopagus and head upstairs to get a drink.

&gt;BIG MISTAKE.

&gt;Return 5 minutes later to empty popcorn bag, clean panini plate and empty pie wrappers all over the floor. Count remaining pies. 
[MFW](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/39003-wat-know-your-meme-gif-olJb.gif) there are only 3 pies left.

&gt;She notices we are all staring at her in shock.
&gt;""What? I asked you to get me 4 pies.""
&gt;HotBro says ""Ummm, no, you asked us to get you two.""
&gt;My pie is still there, but the hambeast has eaten WisdomSkinny's vegetarian pie as well as EmoKid's second pie.
&gt;HotBro says ""Think about it. 7 Pies. 2 for you, 2 for EmoKid, and one each for the rest of us. Now there are only 3, and WisdomSkinny spent the last of her pocket money on that pie you gobbled.""
&gt;""No, I asked you for 4 pies. It's not my fault if you guys can't remember a simple order. I just assumed EmoKid must have eaten one of his on the way home, and WisdomSkinny never eats, I thought she probably changed her mind and didn't get one.""

&gt;WisdomSkinny is very hungry and starts to cry. Reminding us all that she is only 12. We forget often.
&gt;""So why did you only give me enough for two pies then?"" asks HotBro.
&gt;Popalopagus replies ""You OWED me that money, don't you remember?""
&gt;By this time I am giving WisdomSkinny a hug and she is crying quietly into my shirt. Jimmies very rustled because WisdomSkinny is so sweet and now she's sad.

&gt;Popalopagus turns to WisdomSkinny ""Oh, stop crying like a big fucking baby WisdomSkinny. You wouldn't have eaten it anyway,"" WisdomSkinny ignores her.
&gt;""Oh right, so I'M the bad guy."" Popalopagus continues ""You guys fuck up my order, and then WisdomSkinny cries and everyone is on her side. Just because she's anorexic as fuck. Well fuck you all. WisdomSkinny and AmeliaBeerhart have to GO HOME NOW. This is MY house, and I can do WHAT I WANT!""
&gt;She storms off. Slams her bedroom door. Me and WisdomSkinny share my pie, while HotBro and EmoKid donate bits of vegetable and pastry to the cause.

&gt;5 minutes later, she emerges, apologises and asks EmoKid if she can have some of his pie. He gives her the death stare. WisdomSkinny and I retreat to our comparatively saner homes.

TL;DR Lardlump steals the pie of a 12 year old and makes her cry, 2=4 and there is no reasoning with fatlogic.

1371497282.0	1gj94e	Cakes over Dates	homehealthgirl	402	61	64	"Hello again. I debated posting this and another story about an acquaintence of mine, thus known as Beretta who you have met  [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ghrhh/baconators_are_more_important_than_safety/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gin2n/fries_before_friends/) . The last two stories of Beretta aren't as ""funny ha-ha"", but a little more sad in my opinion. I should also note that this stuff happened about five years ago, when I was senior in high school.

&gt; Be me, 17yrs young, last year of high school.

&gt; Prom is in a few weeks, graduation after that, then my whole life ahead of me.

&gt; I've had no contact with Beretta since the incident with drama club earlier that year, but we run in different circles so it's not a big surprise.

&gt; I spend my lunch and the hour afterwards on Wednesdays in an office in the library doing Conflict Resolution.

&gt; Pretty typical day, eating some pretzels and doing homework.

&gt; All the little kiddies are in a good mood because of the weather, no fights breaking out.

&gt; Knock on the door, Ms. Director enters, tells me that the Spanish teacher sent two girls to the office for fighting, and rather than detention they chose to try a mediation.

&gt; All right, I got a handle on it.

&gt; Few minutes later the hall monitor escorts down two girls.

&gt; Of course one of them is Beretta.

&gt; Decide to speak to the sophomore that was also involved first.

&gt; be her, little sophomore, five foot nothing, plays varsity tennis, 90lb if that.

&gt; We'll call her Bonita.

&gt; Bonita, can you tell me what happened?


Bonita explains that they were celebrating Cinco De Mayo in Spanish class. She had made a whole tray of [Mexican Wedding Cakes](http://food.sndimg.com/img/recipes/15/06/8/large/picTsTVUJ.jpg) for her class to share. They also had a buffet with taco meat, chips, tortillas, beans, corn salsa, and several other assorted desserts and pop. This was all brought in by students; if they couldn't bring in food, they were asked to bring paper plates, napkins, anything that they could to contribute. Beretta hadn't brought anything, but no one was going to call her out on it.


Everyone had gone up for their first serving of lunch, they hadn't opened or cut any of the desserts because for extra credit if you made something ""authentic"" you could give a little speech about what it was, why it was relevant, and then share with the class.


While sitting with her friends Bonita saw Beretta, who in edition to her plate of tacos and nachos, had another plate with slices of dulce de leche cake, Mexican Wedding Cake, Carmel Cake, and some of the Tres Leches fruit Parfait. Bonita goes up to her and kindly explains that the desserts weren't opened yet for a reason, and would she be kind enough to wait till the presentations were over before eating them, thinking that maybe Beretta hadn't caught the memo. Bonita didn't want her to be embarrassed as she was the only one with desserts.


Beretta apparently then made some flippant remark about how she was the only girl who had grabbed desserts because she was comfortable with her figure. Bonita again tried to explain her that it's not about who is and who isn't eating, but about the fact that no one wants to present a cake with a slice missing.


Beretta, while looking Bonita in the eye, grabbed two of the Mexican Wedding Cakes and shoved them in her mouth. Bonita grabbed the plate of desserts away from her and took it up to the teacher's desk to tattle. Before she could take more than three steps Beretta started choking on the food, so Bonita put down the dessert plate, handed the glass of pop to Beretta and gave her a few good slaps to the back.


After catching a good breath, Beretta wheezes out

&gt; ""Get your hands off me you anorexic whore.""

The teacher heard the choking and was making her way over to see what was going on.

&gt; ""Excuse me?"" asks Bonita.

&gt; ""You heard me, whore. You think you're so great waltzing around here, dating your boyfriend who is a senior like me. Everyone knows you are just fucking him so you can go to prom. People like you steal men that aren't even your age and toy with them. You're just using your body to use him. I hope he leaves money for you when he finishes.""

&gt; Bonita, speechless, just stands there.

&gt; ""Go throw up in the bathroom so you'll fit into your prom dress. I hope you get in a car accident and die on your way to prom, skinny bitch."" 

&gt; Bonita's [FW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/um-no.gif) when Beretta grabs a taco and starts to eat again.

&gt; The teacher heard the comments and assumed that something else must have occurred as well in order for anyone to retaliate in that manner. Sends both Bonita and Beretta to the office.

I didn't need to hear anymore. I went and got Ms. Director and explained the situation. There was no mediation necessary in my opinion. The correct response should have been for Bonita to directly notify her teacher rather than confronting Beretta, but that didn't deserve punishment.

I recommended Beretta have some private counseling time with Ms. Director or one of us Mediators, because obviously she was having anger issues. This was even beyond what I had seen of her before.

Ms. Director ended up listening to both sides. Beretta didn't even bother to try to lie her way out of this one and per my recommendation in order to stay out of detention she had to have one fully week of private counseling with her or one of us during lunch. Beretta opts to try a peer mediator first. Bonita declines the offer of a follow-up session, saying that she was more embarrassed than anything.

&gt; First day of private counseling with Beretta*

&gt; I ask her why she got so angry with Bonita.

&gt; ""Well, she's just a bitch. She's not the food police and neither are you.""

&gt; Beretta, think about why you were angry. Did she say anything in a rude way?

&gt; ""No,""

&gt; Then why did you react aggressively?

&gt; ""Because she's a bitch.""

&gt; How is she a bitch for asking something politely? 

&gt; ""...""

&gt; Do you have a specific problem with Bonita?

&gt; ""She just thinks she's so pretty and so perfect and I'm sick of it. I'm not jealous or anything.""

&gt; Beretta, we do have exercise/diet clubs/walking groups that run before and after school. The weight and cardio rooms are always open an hour before school begins, and are open till 5pm after school. In fact, Blondie and I usually do cardio after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you want to join us. We usually just do the ellipticals or the treadmills.

Now, I definitely was never planet status, but I did sports for the first half of middle school and then had two really dark years where I didn't do anything besides self-destruct and gain weight. I also get what it's like to be uncomfortable in your body, being as what I'm occasionally called an ""athletic"" build, which is a kind way of saying ""Tall and flat"". I come from a small place, so I know that Beretta knew what I looked like before/after. 

&gt; ""mumblemumblemumble""

&gt; Beretta, I didn't catch that.

&gt; ""Skinny bitches like you don't know shit about me or what I go through. Taking a walk isn't going to fix me, there ain't anything to be fixed about me. You guys are the ones with the problems. Go throw up your lunch, bitch.""

&gt; Beretta storms off.

&gt; Goes to principal says she'd rather have detention.

&gt; This is the second to last time I'll ever interact with Beretta.

I have a feeling she may have found a TiTP blog, to be honest."	t5_2vzax	True

[The Epic of Porcina – Chapter Four](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1je7pp/the_epic_of_porcina_chapter_four/)

**Chapter Five**

I took a meandering route home, despite living less than five minutes away. Both Porcina and Lauren had bid me farewell, though the smaller girl had only appeared at her portly roommate's calling. Alone in my car, I had a chance to reflect on all that had occurred, and I found myself feeling equal parts revulsion and intrigue.

Though I had only interacted with her for a few brief seconds, Lauren did not strike me as the sort of person to post a suggestive Craigslist advertisement... and yet, there was no denying that the included picture was *not* of Porcina. My libido led me toward hope that it *had* been Lauren all along, and that her domineering roommate had simply found out and claimed me for herself. Unfortunately, my rational mind insisted that something different had occurred. The most likely explanation was that I *hadn't* seen Lauren's breasts; that the picture which had attracted me was something pulled from the Internet, or perhaps another advertisement. Still, if that had been the case, why had Lauren been so embarrassed?

The advertisement was still on my screen when I woke my computer from sleep mode. I saved the picture and copied the text before doing anything else, lest I refresh my browser and discover that they had been removed. My precautions proved to be ultimately unnecessary, but even so... I felt better for having preserved the evidence. My actions, however, had the unintended effect of setting my chat program's status back to “Online,” and a few seconds later, a familiar chime informed me that I had received a message.

It was, as I expected, Porcina. “So, what are we doing tomorrow?” she asked.

I considered not responding. The evening had been frustrating to no end, but it was early enough to dive back into the depths of Craigslist in search of consolation. “I hadn't thought about it,” I replied, perhaps more honestly than I should have.

“We could go back to the same place and get the same things!”

There was a certain logic to the suggestion, though if I was expected to pay, I intended to leave a much larger tip. “That would certainly make us even,” I answered.

There was a pause as Porcina typed her next message. “Sorry about Lauren,” she said.

“What do you mean?” I asked, a bit taken aback. Lauren had done nothing wrong! If anything, she had been a victim, no matter *what* the truth about the evening might be! Porcina's answer was a rambling story, full of cryptic twists and likely half-truths, from which I was able to glean the following:

Lauren and Porcina had met during their freshman year of high school. Porcina had approached the smaller girl after seeing her alone during lunch, her half-eaten meal beside her and her nose stuck in a book. (I remember thinking it odd that Porcina would mention an unfinished sandwich, but I suppose it struck her as an important detail.) The two had developed a fast friendship, with Porcina sticking up for Lauren whenever necessary. This had endeared Porcina to Lauren's mother, a single parent of similar size and stature to her daughter, and before long, Porcina was something like a second child. When Lauren's mother needed some time alone, the two girls would stay at Porcina's house, amidst her many brothers and their doting parents. Lauren was gifted food, books, clothes, and even school supplies, and though Porcina never mentioned this, I suspect the two girls were each other's only friends. They applied for the same colleges – Lauren apparently “helped” with that – and when matching acceptance letters were received, it seemed only natural for the two of them to become roommates. The rent for their townhouse was shared by both of them, with Lauren working a job (perhaps appropriately) at a local bookstore, and Porcina being provided for by her parents.

It was an interesting story, and it did provide a lot of insight into their relationship... but I had yet to discover the reason for Porcina's apology. It was, I realized, an ongoing habit for her to omit the most pertinent details. “Sounds like you guys have been through a lot,” I finally typed. “Why are you apologizing, though?”

There was another pause, likely lengthened by Porcina reading through our chat transcript. “Oh, she was all awkward and made you feel unwelcome.”

“That's not what happened *at all*,” I replied, going as far as to add the italics. “She was embarrassed when you laughed at her, and I felt bad. That's all.”

To be honest, I can't recall exactly how the conversation progressed. I remember that Porcina played it off as though Lauren had known that she was joking, and I know that I expressed hesitant acceptance. I was, admittedly, distracted, having left Craigslist for more immediate stimulation and taken my sexual frustration into my own hands. This would prove to be my biggest mistake, for while in the throes of arousal, I made the monumentally stupid decision to ask if there were any more pictures available. It turned out that, in fact, there *were*... but that I would have to trade for them.

Fortunately, I had not taken *complete* leave of my senses. Even as addled as I might have been, I wasn't about to provide Porcina with suitable blackmail material. I made the excuse that I didn't have a camera, and all but begged for a freebie or two. True, it might have been simpler to offer her a counterfeit image of my own, but I didn't want to risk her sharing it with Lauren. In hindsight, I should have suspected that our entire exchange would be repeated, but at the time, I was too thrilled when I saw a file transfer beginning.

It was a picture much like the one I had already seen... except this one included Lauren's face, her eyes locked directly on the camera with a sexual ferocity that I didn't think possible from her.

There was no denying it after that. Lauren *had* been a participant in the posting of the advertisement, though to what degree I couldn't be sure. My senses returned shortly thereafter... but I remained transfixed on the image filling my screen.

“So,” I asked Porcina, “if Lauren didn't want to go out, why did she drop you off at the diner?”

There was no response. 

I would learn the following morning that Porcina had spontaneously fallen asleep, but at the time, I was convinced that I had invoked her wrath yet again. I had no choice but to prepare for bed, and wonder what the next day would bring.

Part 7: NURSE JIGGLES

This story takes place after the wonderful NurseLovely retired and had a great outgoing party and in her place came in NurseJiggles, ALL DAT SOUTHERN SASS Y'ALL WITH SOME BUTTER, MM HMM MMMM.

NurseJiggles was a lazy fuck to put it lightly, she took forever to check up on patients and follow doctor's orders JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT TO A FANCY SCHOOL DONT MEAN NOTHIN

Veterans of FPS can already tell where this is going, NurseJiggles threw her weight around, literally and figuratively.

Its my mom's birthday! WOOHOO! but she still has to work (WHYGODWHY!) so she showed up at the hospital with some cheesecake and cookies 

[nomnomnomnom](http://viralheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cookie-Monster.jpg)

My mom went around her business treating beetus induced comas and heart attacks, having a good time with her patients who like her, especially after spending time with NurseJiggles.

Enter My Dad, Romantic at heart, 6'4/193cm 200lbs/91kg/14stone, big block of muscle and luscious hair (yes its that beautiful)  bring my mom flowers for her birthday 

[D'aww](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28800000/SpongeDaww-spongebob-squarepants-28843255-339-498.jpg)

He tries to find her but couldn't so he ends up going to a nurse to ask where she is, BIG MISTAKE

""WHATS A MAN LIKE YOU LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE HER?!""

""She's my wife and its her birthday, I want to surprise her""

""YOU?! HER?! PLEASE!""

""What?..""

""YOU NEED A GIRL WITH MEAT ON HER BONES, A REAL WOMAN""

""Ohkay...""

whatevsbruhiaintevenmad.goodday

""TELL ME, WHY ARE YOU WITH HER?""

""That's personal""

""YOU KNOW THAT CURVY GIRLS KNOW THINGS THAT SKINNY BITCHES DONT""

""Don't you dare call my wife a bitch""

""SKINNY BITCH""

""Go to hell""

So he walked away and found my mom. When he was about to leave my mom and dad had a mini kissing session in front of the nurses station

Pleaselordnotthatimageinmyhead!!!

""TAKE YOUR FILTH SOMEWHERE ELSE!""

""Nah, we're good here""

Nurse Jiggles got up to separate my mom and dad with mayo all over her face and ended up tripping with the force of a thousand stampeding elephants, the echo reverberated through the building in armageddon fashion.

""SOMEONE HELP ME! THIS BITCH TRIPPED ME! FUCKING TWIG!""

wtf.nologic

The sight of three nurses trying to hold NurseJiggles up was probably the funniest thing ever, like trying to sedate a wild hippo and transferring him. Pure Comedy.

""YOU CANT HANDLE A WOMAN LIKE ME! GET ME UP! FAT SHAMING ASSHOLES! I'LL TELL THE CHIEF ABOUT WHAT YOU DID""

""Go for it"" (The chief loved my mom)

""YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SKINNY YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH BULLYING PEOPLE AND MAKING FUN OF THEM??!""

""Whatever""

My mom went back to her office and my dad went back home, NurseJiggles was suspended was yelling obscenities in the hospital and everyone sided with my mother on this matter when a meeting was called. She came back, only to continue her sass but still avoided my mom everyday until my mom took another job.

If you haven't read the first two, [start here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dzo6w/hamburglar_makes_a_16_hour_greyhound_bus_ride_hell/)

**This might be a long one, so prepare your insulin shots before your beetus gets out of hand**

*If you are sensitive to racial jokes, please don't be offended. I do make a few insensitive jokes near the end that could be taken the wrong way. I apologize if I offend*

&gt;Miserable next morning after Hamburglar destroyed all the plates in our house, -20 degrees Celsius

&gt;At music academy watching a performance, sitting next to Hammy, performance ends

&gt;Getting up to leave, have to be careful because a creepy classmate of mine has been taking photos secretly of Smilebro and I on his camera for the past week (Irrelevant story), avoiding at all cost

&gt;Let's call him ass burgers

&gt;Spot ass burgers trying to look for me as we're exiting

&gt;Targetaquired.jpg

&gt;shitshitshitshitshit gotta go fast

&gt;Hamburglar realizes I'm running and attempts for the first time ever to actually put one leg in front of the other faster than a dying sloth

&gt;Run into nearby building, expecting Hamburglar to be right behind me

&gt;No sign of Hamburglar

&gt;Best decision ever

&gt;Unfortunately after 15 seconds, Hamburglar's echolocation was able to locate where I had run off to and she bursts in, completely out of breath as if she just ran a marathon

&gt;Actual quote: OH MY GAWDDD I SWEAR ASS BURGERS WAS.... *huff* LOOKING AT MY ASS OR SOMETHINGGGGG WHEN I RAAAN *huff* *puff*

&gt;Bitch it was harder NOT to look at your ass in that tiny auditorium

&gt;Day 7 of choir trip, day off

&gt;All the girls in my house decide to go exploring/hiking with boys in the next house over

&gt;Ask Hamburglar if she wants to come

&gt;Of course she doesn't want to come, that would require actually moving and possibly a small portion  of physical activity

&gt;Leave her in house alone on her iPod touch, inevitably tumblr blogging about thin privilege letting us go on hikes with boys

&gt;Come back, had rad time, everyone totally starving

&gt;Enter house to thick smoke and a foul burning stench

&gt;Run inside (because that's smart)

&gt;[Find pasta that Hammy left on the stove for 5 straight hours](https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/2993_1087543240407_128452_n.jpg)

&gt;Hamburglar in a food coma on the Isle of Couchland, looks more like The Netherlands considering how much she's flattened the poor thing

&gt;Clean up her goddamned mess again, finally we get to have a nice big dinner

&gt;You can probably guess where this is headed

&gt;Yep

&gt;Hamburglar stuffed her fat face full of the remaining food all 7 of us needed for 7 days

&gt;Mess we didn't initially see left in the downstairs bedroom, wrappers and crumbs and bowls full of half eaten pastas, fruit, beetus everywhere

&gt;Talentbro and Sportybro actually have to restrain Arabro from beating the living shit out of Hamburglar, Arabro so mad

&gt;Go to bed without food, feels bad man

&gt;No food for whole day, none at all

&gt;Smilebro manages to sneak off academy grounds and finds a small convenience store, doesn't have much money so she buys Kraft Singles cheese, shitty margarine and 1 loaf of bread

&gt;1/4th of a grilled cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner

&gt;All day every day

&gt;Can feel vital organs beginning to fail

&gt;Everybody fucking hates Hamburglar at this point

&gt;Every night we all squeeze into the 2 beds upstairs and lock the door while Hamburglar has free cattle run of the downstairs, want nothing to do with her

&gt;Hope she cries every night

&gt;Night before we pack up and depart, entire choir and band have a massive prepaid spaghetti dinner at The Spaghetti Factory

&gt;Portion sizes absolutely ridiculous, could feed a small African nation

&gt;So excited for actual food in a week omg

&gt;Can barely eat 1/8th of this meal because of stomach shrinkage, force self to eat as much as I can

&gt;Fuckthatwasbetterthansex.png

&gt;Get home, everyone sporting a food baby the size of a basketball

&gt;I'm standing on my new skateboard I bought near the beginning of the trip, wiggling it to break in the trucks

&gt;First words that are uttered out of Hamburglar's mouth: ""So are we having dinner, or what?""

&gt;I reply: What...? Hamburglar, that WAS dinner. What the fuck.

&gt;Hamburglar: Oh... well I'm still hungry :(

&gt;Leave room out of sheer anger, gonna punch a bitch

&gt;Later that night we're all sitting in the tiny room discussing how shitty Hamburglar made this trip for us

&gt;I mention what she said to me when nobody else was in the house yet

&gt;Arabro goes apeshit and has flashbacks of the motherland

&gt;Halalalalalalala down the stairs she goes

&gt;All of us run into the hallway and watch through the balcony that overlooks the downstairs living room area

&gt;Arabro flips kitchen table in anger, startles the wild Snorlax resting on the couch

&gt;Storms over to Hamburglar, too angry to even speak English

&gt;Picks up my beloved skateboard and begins to repeatedly beat Hamburglar to a pulp

&gt;Dying baby pig noises coming from Hamburglar. 

&gt;""STAHP WHAT'D I DOOO STAHP PLEEEZE AHHHHRHHH DIS IS BAD FOR MAH BLOOD SUGARRRR""

&gt;Smilebro, Sportybro, and I all sprint down the stairs to stop Arabro

&gt;To be honest I care more about my skateboard being harmed than the fat glob currently having her ass handed to her by the Iranian refugee who knows what true hunger is like

&gt;Impossible struggle to pull Arabro away from Hamburglar, enough commotion that someone ran over to the choir instructor house and they rushed over to see what's wrong

&gt;Instructors ready to bang the door down

&gt;Koreandramabro and Talentbro Anne Franking it upstairs

&gt;Smilebro eventually opens the door once Sportybro gets Arabro to drop the skateboard

&gt;Side and chest hurt, took a few blind skateboard hits while struggling to subdue Arabro
 
&gt;Hamburglar needs to be taken to first aid for a sprained wrist, other than that she's okay besides bruises. Spends night in the instructor's house, probably stuffed as much food down her gullet as possible to ease the pain of the savage beating

&gt;Arabro told she's suspended from school for an undecided amount of time, it will be decided when we return

&gt;Arabro giving no fucks

&gt;Skateboard has a faint crack near the middle

&gt;Worthit.mp3

&gt;Next morning we all take the 16 hour trip back home, sit next to Smilebro and everything is awesome

&gt;Never talk to Hamburglar again, she attempts many times to speak to me and after 6 months accepts the end of the friendship

**tl;dr: Hamburglar eats all the food 7 girls needed for 7 days. After a complimentary spaghetti meal the size of Australia, she still complains about being hungry, which pushes Arabro over the edge as Hammy gets a savage beating that she completely deserved**

-----------------------------------------------------

Hope you guys enjoyed my little tale of the Ham. Was my first post here, and if people like these ones I'll figure out how to write other tales about different Hamplanets I've run into. Can think about at least 2 off the top of my head.

To answer some questions asked in the last installment:

- This happened around 2009, I was 14. I'm 18 now.

- Hamburglar went on to get alienated because of her rude behavior, nobody wanted to have any of it anymore, including me. She ended up  banding together with the other 2 hambeasts that inhabited the school.

- Had a drama-filled relationship with literally the most horrifyingly awkward guy in school (Not his fault though, he went to my elementary school and I stood up for him whenever he got bullied)

- Hamburglar graduated high school last year and judging by her Facebook, she is now attending a C-Grade crappy university for God knows what.

- All the other girls in the story are in their last year of high school, Hamburglar and I were the only 14 year olds in our house."	t5_2vzax	True

**Chapter Four**

There have only been a few times in my life when I have been shocked into silence, and the moment that followed my introduction to Lauren accounts for half of them. Here was a girl who had every appearance of being clean, quiet, and fastidious, who had said no more than a single word to me, and who was so incredibly embarrassed by the combination of my presence and her roommate's behavior that she could do nothing more than stare at her own feet.

“You've seen her *boobs*!” Porcina cackled again, seemingly delighted by the situation. I was at a loss for words. Clearly, there was an explanation for everything, but I didn't know whether to request it, attempt to comfort Lauren, respond to Porcina, or just turn tail and run. I thought of apologizing, but without any idea for what. Unfortunately, my speechlessness only encouraged Porcina, who grabbed my hand and yanked me towards the pristine couch at the back of the room. “Sit down!” she insisted. “Lauren will make us some tea!”

At last, I found my voice. “No, I'm fine. Thank you, Lauren,” I said, casting a look at the poor girl. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, and didn't move from her spot near the door.

“Well, *we* want tea, don't we?” said Porcina.

“Really, I'm fine,” I said again.

Porcina scoffed in reply. “I *meant* me and *Lauren*! God! You're so self-centered sometimes!” The switch in her head flipped again, and the whiny child was back. “Aw, I didn't mean to yell at you. I'm sorry. Give me a smile!” She reached out and brushed my cheek, which was as unwelcome as the rest of the situation. Then, in a motion that my mind would interpret as a trap springing shut, she kicked off her slippers and put her legs up on my lap, her bulbous thighs like dungeon restraints made of quivering flesh. Unless I was willing to exert physical effort, I was stuck there at the mercy of a portly prison guard.

Questions were spinning in my head, but I was at a loss for how to go about having them answered. Perhaps, I hoped, Lauren would join us on the couch, and I'd have a chance to talk to her. I'll admit, her presence was one of the few things – Porcina's legs aside – keeping me from fleeing into the night, and I was already wondering if my unfavorable circumstances could be turned into something a little more pleasant. As heartless as it was, I found myself pondering ways of spurning Porcina in favor of her roommate, and coming out as a hero in my own tale of triumph.

My quest, however, would have to wait. With a grip like a clammy vice, Porcina grabbed my hand and squeezed with what was likely meant to be affection. ""I had a really nice time tonight,” she said, staring pointedly into my eyes.

“Yeah, thanks again for dinner,” I replied.

“You can pay me back tomorrow.” She moved as though to touch my face again, but couldn't sit up enough to reach. Instead, she made a show of adjusting the pillow behind her, then gave me a satisfied smile as she ran her hand down her chest, and then her stomach, before stopping just above her inner thigh. “You must be pretty horny.”

My biological urges threatened to rebel against me yet again, but considerations for Lauren – who had, at some point, closed the front door and adjourned to the kitchen – quelled any uprising before it could begin. “So,” I asked, not caring if I offended, “those were Lauren's breasts in your advertisement?”

To my surprise, Porcina seemed genuinely amused by my inquiry. She let loose another titter of escaping steam as she answered, saying ""Well, of course they were! Duh! Whose did you *think* they were?""

""Before you flashed me,"" I replied, ""I thought that they were *yours*.""

*That*, for some reason, Porcina found offensive. ""You *do* think I'm a slut! You probably only came in for *sex*, didn't you?"" I waited for another switch in personality, but this time, it didn't come. Instead, with an audible grunt and a groan, she pulled her legs from my lap and lurched into a seated position. ""I'm not that *easy*! You still owe me *dinner*!""

""Fine,"" I replied, my patience wearing thin. ""If it's that big a deal, I'll go find an ATM, *right now*, and pay you back for the hamburger."" Questions be damned, I thought. I had met this girl less than two hours earlier, and I wasn't at all happy with the way that things had turned out. This was supposed to have been a carefree roll in the hay, and instead, I was dealing with the insanity being offered by a barnyard animal! As for Lauren, well... I knew where she lived. I could visit again later with the excuse of apologizing, and ask her out *then*, with no overweight sentinel to stop me.

I waited for Porcina's response, expecting another outburst or a reversion to a caricature of grade school... but when she finally spoke, it was with a tone and demeanor that was entirely new. ""God, I'm... I'm sorry,"" she said, holding her face in her hands. ""I must seem pretty fucked up to you, huh?""

I was still guarded and annoyed... but I was curious again, too. ""A little bit, yeah,"" I confessed.

""College has been really stressful,"" she continued. ""I just wanted to have some fun, you know?""

""I can understand that."" It didn't do anything to clarify why she had posted a picture of her roommate's breasts, nor did it offer any explanation for her behavior, but at least she seemed more inclined towards being reasonable. ""So, again... why?""

""Why what?"" Porcina asked. 

A moment passed while I waited for her to process my implied question. The silence was filled by sounds of Lauren in the kitchen, presumably preparing tea . ""Why,” I tried again, “did you post a picture Lauren's breasts instead of your own?"" 

Now, I should mention that the picture in question was not an especially graphic one, though it was certainly provocative. It had featured a young woman's bosom being covered by her hands, with only the barest hint of a nipple peeking out from atop one of them. It was that tiny exposure, however, of which I had taken note – delusively thinking of myself as I did as an aficionado of the female form – and which had suggested to me that Porcina's breasts were not the ones in the image. For, you see, Lauren's nipples were a light pink, whereas Porcina's were a much darker brown. There as also, I'll admit, the fact that the former woman's breasts were somewhat small and rather perky, whereas Porcina's... well, Porcina's were decidedly not.

When at last I got my answer, it again came as a surprise. “It was mostly Lauren's idea,” said Porcina, waving her hand as though to dismiss any doubts I might have. “The ad was for both of us, but we kept getting old men answering.”

“What do you mean, 'for both of you?'” I asked.

“She wanted to post an ad, okay?” Porcina's offended tone was returning. “So we posted it together and I took a picture of her boobs and nobody good was answering and when *you* answered she didn't want to go out so I went out with you, *okay*?” The explanation had come as a rapid-fire torrent of words, and when translated, it left me with still more questions. Had it been *Lauren's* advertisement all along? I considered making a blind rush to the kitchen and asking her myself, but remembering her look of shame gave me pause. There was, I was certain, a detail missing; something that Porcina wasn't telling me. “Besides,” she suddenly continued. “You like mine better, I can tell.”

I was half-expecting to look back and see a lifted sweatshirt, but Porcina remained seated against the far side of the couch. Perhaps the presence of her roommate merited more modesty, or maybe I'd just fallen out of the young woman's good graces. Whatever the explanation, the atmosphere in the room had grown notably colder... not that it had been especially welcoming beforehand.

“I think I'm going to head out,” I said, almost surprising myself. Without waiting for a response, I stood and walked towards the door. “Thanks again for dinner.”

Porcina hefted herself to her feet, once again grunting with the effort. “I'll see you tomorrow, right? You still owe me!”

Looking back, I see that moment as a bit of a crossroads, where a single word could decide the path that I would take. I knew that if I let her down, I'd save myself a lot of trouble in the future... but it would also ruin any chance I might have of getting to speak to Lauren. On the other hand, I knew very little about the smaller girl, aside from her apparently being neat, quiet, and possessing of a phenomenal set of breasts.

“Yes,” I replied. “I'll see you tomorrow.”

1374501615.0	1it8kd	Whale Tales: Buffetbane	sanspantalooons	428	89	81	"**Part I** | [Part II](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1iuqv4/whale_tales_buffetbane_rises/)

Hello, FPS! I've been here quite a while, enjoying the companionship and rustled jimmies you've brought me whilst on the porcelain throne. I figure it's time for me to contribute and to share the horrors I've encountered in my life. 

A little background on me - I'm currently a college senior, and have worked at a Pizza Hut and a pan-Asian buffet during my first two years in school. I have an EMT license and have worked as a tech in the ER for a rest of it, as well as keeping the buffet job for extra hours. Most of my stories are drawn from the Beetus Hut and buffet, but I can share some EMS ones if people seem interested. This particular tale has to do with the pan-Asian buffet, which will remain unnamed. I prefer prose to greentext, so apologies for the lack of it.

It was a god-awfully busy Friday afternoon, and we had far too few servers to take care of the masses of people that came pouring in for lunch. The kitchen was having trouble keeping up, and the sushi line was frightfully empty despite the chefs' best efforts to keep it stocked. Now, keep in mind... as a restaurant, we had recently opened, and were still gauging how many people we needed to properly staff the place. We'd been dead as a doornail for the past couple of weeks, and the manager had seriously underestimated how busy we were going to be. We were doing our best, and most people understood that, but that didn't stop others from being entirely irate when they had to wait a bit for us to get to them.

Enter into this chaos, the planetary body that was Buffetbane. 

Lights dimmed. The earth shook. Our lamps swayed like pendulums from the ceiling, threatening to drop their lights and flee at the sight of the planet orbiting our food lines. Somewhere, a baby wailed in despair, its innocence shattered. He stood at 5'5"" (164cm) and must have weighed in at nearly 400lbs (28.5 stone). Roll upon roll drooped from his frame, loosely held to it by a sweat-stained gray tanktop and dark pair of jeans. Short, receeding black hair lay greased to his head, scraggles of a matching moustache dusting his upper lip. He reeked of sweat and the souls of a thousand untended corpses. 

Our hostess, we'll call her Dee, was a dainty Chinese woman related to the owner of the restaurant. She had a no-bullshit attitude and not one fuck to give about your CONDISHUNS and BEETUS needs. Her nose visibly crinkled at the sight and smell of the man, who seemed oblivious to her disgust because of the sweet aroma of General Tso's wafting in from the food lines. I was darting about my tables at the time, and only heard bits of the conversation.

""CAN YOU SEAT ME CLOSE TO THE BUFFET"" he demanded, interrupting Dee when she tried to greet him. 

""Sorry, all of those seats are taken right now. There is a table this way - ""

""I HAVE BAD KNEES I CANT WALK THAT FAR"" 

They must have gone back and forth for a good ten minutes before he relented and sat at an available table around the corner from the food lines, thankfully not in my section. Dee caught my eye as she went back to the front desk, giving me a DIS GUN BE A LONG DAY look and a shake of her head. I went through the first hour thinking I was safe from Buffetbane, but no... as a server taking the section closest to the line, it wasn't long before I became the target of his whalesong. 

""HEY WAITRESS"" I heard, cringing inwardly as I felt the floor shudder at his approach. I'm a guy.

""Yes, sir, how can I help you?"" I asked, polite and smiling like a pro. 

""YOU'RE ALL OUT OF SAUCE FOR THE SUSHI"" He didn't bother correcting the ""waitress"" comment, either. 

""Oh - I'm sorry about that. Which sauce..."" I stopped when I looked at his plate. It was half a plate with a mound of sushi on it, balanced precariously and shedding tabiko with every one of his shuddering steps. The other half was a large, slopping pool of spicy mayo. He must have emptied the rest of the container onto his plate, as it was quite visibly seeping out under the sushi as well. (Spicy mayo is a thick, orange spicy paste as terribly for you as regular mayonnaise, and ten times as tasty.) I almost gagged. I love spicy mayo, but that was too much even for my Asian palate. 

""We - um. We make the spicy mayo ourselves, sir... it'll take a few minutes for them to finish another batch."" 

""WELL YOU TELL THEM TO HURRY UP. SOME PEOPLE GOTTA EAT""

He noticed me staring. Oh god, I wasn't prepared for the onslaught that followed.

""WHATRE YOU LOOKIN AT? DONT YOU GET ENOUGH OF THIS AT HOME FROM YOUR MAMA"" 

""...I-I'm sorry...?"" 

He stepped closer. I retched a little, glancing at my tables and searching for a reason to escape the monster.

""DONT YOU THINK ABOUT STEALING MY SUSHI. YOUR CHEFS ARE TOO SLOW AND THIS IS ALL I COULD GET. I NEED TO EAT TO KEEP MY STRENGTH UP, YOU HEAR."" 

I was beta as fuck back then. I ducked my head and apologized, mumbled something about telling them about the mayo, and sped back off to my tables. My eyes were watering from the stench - his breath was worse than his BO. While I managed to avoid him for the rest of his stay, I was there to witness the carnage. He took two plates each visit to the buffet line. Mountains upon mountains of food, dripping noodles and sauces in his wake. There was never enough for the everyone else, and the tables complained and complained about the lack of food. When my section slowed down a couple of hours later, he was still here. I got a chance to peek at his table.

His poor waitress. We'll call her Mia. 

The table was encrusted with food and sauces. Coagulating puddles of Siracha and mayo, sweet and sour and teriyaki, a veritable murky rainbow of marinade spotted here and there with flecks of food. No napkins were in sight, and NO SILVERWARE. A full pitcher of orange soda sat next to a large glass of the same. Buffetbane's gut forced him to sit a foot or so back from the table, meaning he had to lean forward to get to his plate. He seemed to be eating with his hand, but no - he had a fork! Its prongs poked out form the pudgy ball of flesh that was his hand, constantly in motion shoveling the food from his plate into his mouth. 

Mia came up to me with a bonafide thousand yard stare. Apparently he'd been hitting on the poor girl. He asked her where she was from, whether she liked it in America or not, WHETHER SHE NEEDED A MAN TO MARRY TO GET A GREEN CARD. She always said she was busy, she had to go take care of her tables, she had a boyfriend, etc. He kept going after her. She begged me to take care of the table, since mine were leaving and we were slowing down. She was pretty and sweet, and I wanted to be a gentleman, so I agreed. Plus no one should have to suffer Buffetbane's breath.

Buffetbane was not happy. 

""YER NOT MY WAITRESS"" 

""She had to take care of some things out back, sir. Is there anything I can get you?"" 

He proceeded to chug the entire pitcher of orange soda, then handed it to me. 

""GIT ME ANOTHER ONE, I NEED SOMETHING TO TO TIDE ME OVER TIL THEY GIT MORE FOOD OUT"" 

I looked at him. Down at the pitcher. Back at him. I'd seen him take at least a dozen plates of food already. By this time it was close to three, and we close from 3-4:30 to switch out the lunch buffet for the dinner buffet. Everyone who comes in after 2:45 is warned that the buffet isn't refilled past that 2:50, in order to prevent a waste of food when we close the lunch stuff. 

""Sir, we're about to change the buffet over to the dinner buffet. I'm not sure they'll be putting any more food out at this time."" 

He looked like I'd stolen his last Twinkie.

Unfortunately I have to go to work, so I'll stop it there for now. I'll continue when I get back.

TLDR; I, late 20s fatty, had lunch meeting today with black hole at Olive Garden. Tried to talk about project, but she’d rather talk about me not waxing my cooch and face, give me advice about how to get a man and be a beautiful plussize modern wommyns. Meeting devolves into her telling me I’m classless and can’t keep a man and me shouting her out of the restaurant. Goddamnit. I'm going to call her HHWSO Or HamHam Wax Studio Owner. 

---
I’m a freelance writer that works with small businesses, occasionally my boisterous style attracts the wrong sort of element. The HamHam Element. I got a request from an aesthetician that hated her website copy and I told her I’d like to meet and discuss her business (she’s local) and what she needed done. She chooses the Olive Garden at 1:30pm. *Not a pitch meeting, we agreed to each pay for our own food. I would be homeless if I paid for clients' meals.

I arrive a little after 1pm for our lunch, not sure if she’s there yet. The place has a few patrons but I beat the lunch rush. I spot a really large Ham Planet in the corner looking wistfully out the window staring at the highway, consuming bread sticks. She’s in her early-mid 50s, a bit unkempt and she’s wearing something like this [shirt]( http://media.plussizetech.com/avenue/mm/0334_13432_mm.jpg?wid=271&amp;qlt=95&amp;op_sharpen=1) in I’d say size 32, some rough looking nude leggings plus some super loud red monkey boots with yellow-gold hardware. Oh no no no. No honey, no. She doesn’t know what I look like so she just kind of hurumphs in my direction, nomming on more breadsticks. She wildly gesticulates at the waitress asking “where in the hell” her appetizers are.

&gt;Heeeeeeeeeeeeey. I’m Terpin, it’s so nice to meet you HHWSO.”

&gt;HHWSO: “Really? You took your sweet time. I said to be here at 1:30. If this is the level of professionalism you’re going to display…”

&gt;”Uhhhh yeah, it’s 1:20. I’m actually a little early!”

&gt;HHWSO hurumphs more and pulls out an iPad with a Hello Kitty skin on it. “Yeah, I guess you are. I’ve been waiting for these people to bring me my appetizers forever it feels like.”

I pull out my phone and bring up my notes about what we could do to bring her site up to speed. “So, HHWSO, I noticed that you guys do European wax services but you’re not really talking about that on your site. Your competitors are and…”


&gt;HHWSO hurumphs even more. I notice the dozens of Juicy Couture bangles she’s wearing move when her hands glide across her iPad. “In the email you sent me, you refer to me as an AEsthetician,”


&gt;I nod, flipping through my notes to see what we're talking about.


&gt;HHWSO: “Where on my website I am clearly called an ESTHETICIAN. We use ONLY the PROPER AMERICAN SPELLING. THIS IS THE CORE OF MY BRAND.”


&gt;I nod more slowly. “Well, I’ll make sure not to do that again, so sorry about that! But back to the European waxing thing, I really think it’s important to show that you’re offering the same great services plus all the stuff that makes you guys so special…”

A waitress appears with 3 plates of appetizers. Everything is stuffed to the gills with other stuff. “Ya’ll enjoy your stuff now!”

&gt;HHWSO grumbles loudly. “Aren’t you going to take her order? She’s been sitting here for five minutes.” 

The waitress is a smaller young woman and her eyes go wide. I’m gonna guess this is her summer job and she’s probably still in high school. “Oh no, no ma’am! I’m sorry I assumed you guys were splitting or something.”

&gt;HHWSO grumbles more. “You know what they say about assumptions!”

I tell the waitress I’d like some water, gnocchi, no app, no dessert. Yes, I understand there's a deal for lots of food for 2 people right now, no, I don't want to eat extra. This enrages HHWSO.

&gt;HHWSO: ”You should really eat something. Doesn’t the agency pay for you to do lunches? You should enjoy it.”

&gt;”Uhhhh no. I’m my own boss and I pay for all my own meals and transport and things. They just hook me up with clients like you and whatnot.”

&gt;HHWSO: “Well I’m not going to tell the people I want coming into my STUDIO that I offer European wax services. We play loud rock’n’roll music in my studio and I cater to mostly Baby Boomers who make lots of money and want to try something new with their husbands. You know, bigger girls going through divorces or the ones that finally have the kids out the house and want explore themselves and their sexuality.”

Ew. Okay, Terpin, you’ve dealt with crazier people than this. Play along.


&gt;”Ohhh, that’s cool. I can understand that. I don’t think that audience is going to really associate a eurowax with frilly boring salons and studios…”

&gt;HHWSO: “We are a WAX STUDIO. We are not a salon. Did you even read the website I sent you? Are you sure you’re the person on the website that’s got good ratings? You know I wrote everything on my website. I know it by heart.”

&gt;Me be nearing my breaking point. Me be getting pissed. Her website looked like a 10 year old on a combined Twinkie acid high wrote it. “Yes, but I must say that my style of collaboration may not work for all business types. Those are just... fabulous… boots.” Desperation, salvage meeting, run:flattery.exe.

&gt;HHWSO: “Well thanks!” She stuffs appetizers down her gullet until two plates have been decimated. I slowly begin to realize that she’s a timewaster.

&gt;HHWSO: “You know, you should really come by my studio. I could book you an appointment to get that lip looked after.”

&gt;ME BE CRINGIN’. Embarrassed I put a hand over my lip, forgot to sugar last week. Quietly curse ancestry. “Oh, no. I don’t wax.”

&gt;HHWSO’s face went crazy. “You want to work with me and you don’t wax? What do you do? You shave? That’s not a permanent solution you know. What does your boyfriend think about you just running wild and ragged all the time? Or do you… swing to the left?”

&gt;Sensitive area to hit. Recently split from husband, displeasure washes over my face. “I’m in the middle of a divorce, he doesn’t really have much to say about that these days.”

&gt;HHWSO’s face screws up. “Well it’s no wonder you don’t have a man! You come down to the studio and we’ll give you a Brazillian and fix your eyebrows and lips up. Being hairless as a bigger girl just makes you feel great. But no freebies! We’re professionals and you have to pay! TEEHEE.”

&gt;Thanks ancient gods of the deep dark underworld that I haven’t had lunch yet. The idea, the mental imagery. Bad. “No. I like to shave and I get my eyebrows threaded when I have the time. Thanks.”

The nice waitress returns with my plate of gnocchi and my water. She gives HHWSO some kind of huge plate with lots of creamy tortellini on it. I want to look up the points on my Weight Watcher app so bad to see how bad the food is. So bad. Waitress scurries away quickly.

I want to fucking eat, I skipped breakfast and I’m hungry. I quit talking and think this is the quiet portion of our meeting. This does not deter the *Waxed Hamtaro* from continuing the discussion.

&gt;HHWSO: ”That waitress is sooooo stupid. Back in my day you had to work for your tips but skinny little bitches think that they can just get by with being pretty.""

&gt;""She probably just thought we were splitting the food.""

HHWSO harumphs again. ""But really, you need to wax to understand what we really do there. This is a job where you need to be beautiful and modern. You should pay for an appointment to come in and get hairless. Might take a couple hours to get it all though! TEEHEE. I can’t believe you applied for the job when you have no interest in all the…”


&gt;”No, HHWSO, you invited me to talk to you about making your website interesting. You saw my portfolio and happy customers and wanted to know what I could do for you, but we’re so busy talking about waxing my ladybusiness and how the waitress is too stupid to bring your apps on time and how I’m too stupid to spell “EST-TET-Tissi-yuN” (she says it like this I swear) that we haven’t talked about your website.”


&gt;HHWSO hurumphs loudly. “Well if this is how you treat your paying customers I don’t know what to say.” She’s still cramming food down her throat, but she’s left with the one main dish plate now.


&gt;”You don’t say anything. You’re not a paying customer."" Oh fuck. I just broke Terpin's cardinal rule #1. Don't be rude to the money, ever. 


&gt;HHWSO: ""Well! I'm a Master Esthetician and I know a thing or two about pleasing clients. You, little girl, don't know shit. Then again I ALWAYS get payment upfront! TEEHEE.""


&gt;""That's totally fine. I'm going now. It’s esthetiSHUN by the way. Like aesthetically pleasing to the eye.” I’m pushing my plate forward, pissed off. Looking for my purse, getting ready to leave. She's a nasty person but I shouldn't have got pissed off. She probably would have ripped me off anyway, though.


&gt;HHWSO: ”Ooh someone has some of that fancy book learnin’s.” **SHE LICKS HER FINGERS, EVEN HER PINKIES.** “Too bad college and eyebrow threadin’ don’t help you keep a man or give a little girl like you class.”


Oh hell no. I go full alpha ambulatorus on this bitch. 


&gt;**“Well MEBBE I shuld werk out the back of my uncle-brother-daddy’s kitch’n giv’n gerls waxin’ on them wymmmyn parts. ‘JUST HOP ON GIRLS, GIMME A SECOND TO BRUSH THEM THAR CRUMBS OFF THE KITCHERN TABLE. OH WERT. JIMMY DEAN SAUSAGE WILSON GO FETCH THE NICE SHOWER CURTAIN AND PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE, I GOTS TO WAX SISTER-GRANDMA-COUSIN’S BEAVAR.’ Then I’ll have all that class you get from warshin’ and werkin' on trim and balls all day AND THEN LICKING YOUR FINGERS AFTER YOU EAT.”** 


At this point I’ve dissolved into pure rage. Probably because this HamHam looks a bit like my mother did before she died and used that TONE that mothers use with their children. She grabs her giant SUV sized purse, stuffing her iPad inside leaves. I’ve literally fucking shouted her out of the restaurant and I am so motherfucking embarrassed. Oh my god. I went into beast mode.

I sit down, texting the cab guy that dropped me off to please come get me. The waitress comes out of the kitchen with a crazy face. “Oh my god, did she just dine and dash?!”


&gt;”Yeah… but I’ll pay for it. She got rude and I lost my shit super bad. I’m so sorry.” I was a waitress at a shitty chain restaurant, I know that feel when someone runs out and the manager takes it out on you.


Waitress puts up her hands to stop me. “I'm sorry but was that your mama? She was hanging around since like 12:30 eating breadsticks and drinking a soda out her purse.”


&gt;”No! She was a client that wanted me to do her website. She runs the xyz wax studio over off x and x street.”


&gt;Waitress: “I’ve been there my dad gave me a sunless tanning from there for my bday omg it’s SOOOOO dirty.”


I shrugged, not surprised. I ended up not having to pay for her food and just for mine. I left the waitress a nice tip because that was SO fucking crazy. Gave the store manager the name I had for ham planet and her email address because she didn’t pay for her food and just ran out. I feel bad it went that way but this woman was toxic waste through and through. Hopefully I've shamed her into being less of a cretin.

Update: She lodged a complaint that I ""Verbally and **SEXUALLY** harassed her, **embarrassing** her in a **'busy restaurant'**"" at the meeting. My account is suspended pending an investigation on Monday (they'll call the place then and see what happened). Shit. Well if they don't protect me from that kind of crazy they don't deserve 15% of my earnings anyway I guess. Dammit.

Hahahahahaha guys! So this story will not be long I think. So a while ago, after part 6, before 7, I forgot to turn my computer off one night and I went to bed and /r/fatpeoplestories was open. (my monitor faces my window) The Manatee went in the middle of the night to do something, I can only imagine what, You know what? Scratch that, I don't want to imagine. And she saw this sub and decided to go here and thinking we could ""bond over it"". And fucking hilarity ensued or PTSD inducing fuckstorm.

Miranda lives with her mom and dad in a small house with nearest neighbor pretty far away, shes home alone a lot too. So after the Manatee read this sub and I can only imagine she was furious that you guys were suggesting we get together. And that day the Manatee found out where Miranda lives and drove there (she has a drivers license apparently) to ""get Miranda to back off from her boyfriend"" 

This story I was not a part off, it was relayed to me by Miranda, sadly I haven't shown her the sub yet, but I will soon. And I think the Manatee is still stalking me here, I mean why wouldn't she? Say hi everyone. So onward to the actual story.

&gt;Be me, Miranda

&gt;MANATEE: ""You aren't even together you whore! He doesn't like you!""

&gt;MIRANDA: ""No. We aren't, but I know he likes me, during that party you crashed, he slapped my ass, and I fucking grabbed his! Later after you crashed the party, we fell asleep together in his bed. Now fucking leave!

&gt;MANATEE: ""He only did that because you whorisly manipulated him into it. He likes me and has been eyeing me everyday since I moved in!""

&gt;MIRANDA: ""Hes been eyeing you because you're a fucking freak show""

&gt;MANATEE: ""NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU ANOREXIC SLUT, YOU WILL LEAVE HIM ALONE OR I WILL DO SOMETHING YOU WILL REGRET!""

1374786079.0	1j1xfq	The wheels on the bus whine about their condushions	annieokelydokely	398	56	37	"Hello, my beautiful glistening hammy-hams adorned with pineapple rings and cloves! Long time lurker and appreciator of the stories shared. Today my jimmies were so rustled during a close encounter with a planet, it prompted me to create an account and get to posting. Here goes. (Edit to add: WHOA GATHER SNACKS TO SEE YOU THROUGH THIS IT GOT UNEXPECTEDLY LONG)

I was riding the bus home from work. When I boarded only the back section was full (the back section's deck is raised a few steps, FYI). I snagged the aisle seat of a two-seater in the main area, next to a low-key old dude. Schweet.

In the back was a group of tourists, some of them hamplanets. A few had spilled into the main area and were milling around the back door. Which on its own, whatever. Tourists can be annoying, hamplanets can be annoying--but they're not mutually reliant so I try not to prejudge. (TOO much.)

As we trundled along, a pregnant lady boarded. I caught her eye and we did the silent communication of ""Do you want this seat? yeah? yes? Cool okay let's do this.""

She smiled with thanks and relief. I gestured to socially alert everyone the seat was for Pregnant Lady.

Now. The bus isn't always an easy space to negotiate, because there's influx and outflux of passengers, shuffling to accommodate this, and of course the bus itself is in unpredictable motion. So I didn't take immediate notice when I careened forward then felt pressure against my back as I stood. People jam into you on the bus, unintended contact is often made, eh it happens.

But wait -- waaaaait -- something just wasn't quite right.

Pregnant Lady's eyes went huge and she grimaced. Then I was smushed against the seat front before being propelled into the aisle. W.T.F.

I turn around and a hamplanet had plunked into the seat! She was Beyond The Thunderthighs variety, with a very wide ass, expansive thighs, and a strangely disproportionate petite torso floating above. She'd spread as soon as she sat and had poor old dude pinned against the windows.

Pregnant Lady and I are, for a second, outright shocked. I shoved my earphones down so I could better grapple with the situation.

FantaPlanet (matching orange shirts with her tour group!) was panting and red-faced. She pulled a bottle of soda from her bag and glugged half down, then she smiled weakly and said, ""Oh muh knees, they were killin' me!"" She glanced at Pregnant Lady and did this wink-shrug thing like, she KNEW she'd bogarted the seat but hey, HER CONDUSHIONS OKAY? tee-hee!

My face and Pregnant Lady's face at this registered on the ""So Not Even"" richter scale.

So I said, ""Yeah sorry to hear that but this seat is Pregnant Lady's. I'm going to ask you to please respect that and move.""

FantaPlanet, ""But, muh kneees! We've walked so far today!""

""Maybe someone in your group will give you a seat, then. But nope, you can't stay here.""

She glugged some more liquid blood-sugar-regulator and scowled at me. ""I can't get up the stairs. And I need to sit.""

""More than Pregnant Lady?"" Long, painful pause. ""Why? I mean it. Beyond your fat having ruined your knees, why?""

FantaPlanet got even redder and she huffed like a wounded walrus. ""I have a condition! I get short of breath and I can't stand for too long it's too hard on me.""

So I told her to go to the front and tell the driver she needed one of the handicapped-or-impaired seats, because of ~medical reasons~, and he'd have to boot a fit passenger so she could have ~~all three seats of the bench~~ a seat.

FantaPlanet then actually said, ""I'm not handicapped! I just have bad knees and I'm hurting, and I'm a guest here and don't know this town!""

Yeaaaaaaah.

No one else was making any moves, so I said, ""Really? This is it? We're all just going to go with this? Great.""

There was a short silence, with poor crushed old dude kinda anemically whimpering, and Pregnant Lady had clearly given up, but she did say thanks to me.

A lady with several grocery bags patted Pregnant Lady and said she was getting off soon, and to please have her seat. Participation Award for Groceries! It was a one-seater. Those are the best seats in the house so I thought okay, jimmies, we're gonna make it out of this situation alive.

As the bus slowed, FantaPlanet gathered her remaining strength to Ramming Speed. Then in surprise attack, she burst across the aisle to claim the one-seater as Groceries exited.

""I should have this one instead! It's got more room for... my knees! And I can see out!"" She fucking BEAMED.

I was about ready to throat punch somebody. But, hark! What is this? Low-key old dude whapped his hand down on the seat and glared a dome of protection around it. I angled away, and Pregnant Lady smoothly lowered into the seat. Gold Star, old dude!

After that everything basically reset and went back to normal. That's how it goes. I only had a few more stops, Pregnant Lady was seated, I took some deep breaths and thought, ~~~let it gooooooo.

But nope, not so lucky. FantaPlanet snorted to herself and craned around to yell at her group, ""Haha let's not take the bus again unless it's chartered and private! Then we won't have to deal with any more rude people! Har har!""

At this point I had no face. Just a molten, shimmering disc of disbelief and rage in lieu of a face. I did the slow turn of 'I'm sorry, what?' at her then toward the back area. All other Fantas were ducking and looking in any direction but mine.

Pregnant Lady made a noise and I made a noise then it was my stop. As I got off I said to FantaPlanet, ""Hey better, how about instead you keep to places your wideload will actually fit?""

No idea if FantaPlanet retorted, because I made haste to exit the bus before homicide.exe kicked in. I got home and made a jimmy-soothing pot of tea, and wrote about my agonies to share them with you! The end.

**EDIT TL;DR -- Hamplanet steals a seat intended for a pregnant lady on the bus, then steals ANOTHER seat from the pregnant lady, and I nearly have a rage aneurysm.**"	t5_2vzax	True

1369765434.0	1f7p99	Hambert gets a Special Chair	HambertsFoil	422	80	41	"This falls very early in the tales of Hambert.  Was on his first day, and I heard this secondhand, so I've written it from the person's perspective, but here's another installment for all my FPS loving folks who haven't been able to feed the beetus today.

(I apologize if this FPS doesn't meet the standard I've set in my previous tales.)

Previous installments:

[Hambert and the Half and Half](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ee78z/hambert_and_the_half_and_half/)

[Hambert gets some Health Insurance](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ej8ae/hambert_gets_some_health_insurance/)

Without further ado:

&gt; be manager of a call center (not me)

&gt; hire Hambert, the 6' 500+ pound minor planet (no fat discrimination in this workplace, especially based on him not being the only beetus-bearer at this point)

&gt; new employee orientation usually begins with a tour of the campus

&gt; they've put Hambert in his own orientation so he's not required to have the usual tour. 

&gt; limit tour to just the call center and surrounding offices.

&gt; show Hambert where he'll be sitting.

&gt; immediately, he begins complaining that he won't be able to use the standard office chairs.

&gt; says we will do what we can to accommodate.

&gt; they remove armrests from a regular office chair.  he complains that it's uncomfortable.

&gt; tries removing arms from a different style of office chair leftover from the previous expansion of offices.

&gt; sits back and the locking mechanism that keeps the back of the chair  explodes under his weight and he goes crashing to the floor.

&gt; building suffers earthquake damage.  Hambert's already putting together a worker's compensation claim together in his head.

&gt; more complaints and some mumbling about not meeting accessibility requirements.  (he's in the building, so it's not an accessibility issue, but whatever, fat legal logic?)

&gt; then, at his own suggestion, he's allowed to work from home until they can get a chair that can support his bulk.

&gt; [MRW this was just after telecommuting had been axed for everyone in the company.](http://i.imgur.com/S1xOLfn.gif)

2 weeks later a chair arrives that i'm told cost in the neighborhood of $800. they've given him permission to call into conferences from his desk instead of attending in-person like everyone else so he doesn't have to walk 100 feet to the conference room.  he also gets to work from home pretty much at will by saying his knees hurt too much to make it up the stairs since we don't have an elevator up to the 2nd floor offices.

This Is Fat Privilege.

tl;dr - Hambert gets fat privilege of working from home and not attending meetings due to his girth not being able to fit in standard office chairs."	t5_2vzax	True
1364516376.0	1b7mnn	No free dumplings for you.	blueblythe	384	38	45	"So reading a post about an intergalactic fatass in a Chinese restaurant made me remember this particular gem. My mom used to own two restaurants. I practically spent my childhood at these places. I mean, nothing really burns into your naive little child head as the image of my dad flipping food with a wok that was 15~ pounds with one hand, effortlessly adding in the various condiments into the mix, with flames dancing a foot high over his head. Pretty fucking epic.

This story took place at the second restaurant, where I was now old enough to help out ~~for free~~.

&gt;Be me, 6th grade.

&gt;Mom set me up as the front clerk. People think it's cute and give me tips even though I'm at the front.

&gt;Mom u so sly.

&gt;Still in training, Mom takes over when it gets too much.

&gt;Had 6 call-ins with a line waiting before. 

&gt;Gotten a lot better. 

&gt;There are people out there who try to rip me off because they think I'm new and don't know store policies.

&gt;Fuck that. 

&gt;This one lady calls in. It was relatively not busy, since lunch time is over.

&gt;Orders Kung Pao Chicken with white rice, Chicken Lo Mein,  an order of Chicken Wings, yada yada. Lots of food, thinking it's for a group of people or something. Wants the food to-go. 

&gt;Asks for only one fork. No chopsticks. Tells me to make sure to make it quick, since she's hungry.

&gt;Holy fuck this shit is all for her.

&gt;Tells me that my mom and her are good friends and usually adds in a free order of dumplings for her.

&gt;I call bullshit. The people my mom gives for free are the people I know personally.

&gt;Never heard of this lady before.

&gt;I tell her we have no such policy, sorry, your total is 44.63.

&gt;Lady gets belligerent. Says my mom will be unhappy on how I'm treating her oldest customer.

&gt;Says she's been to our restaurant since it open.

&gt;Says I'm a horrible person for denying her free dumplings.

&gt;Decide to put phone on speaker since my mom is standing next to me, asking what's wrong. (had the ""dafuq"" face on).

&gt;I still say no.

&gt;Lady bursts into rant how I'm a fucking horrible receptionist that deserves to get fired.

&gt;Says I'm must be a slut who's even working to work minimum wage because I need money to suck more dicks.

&gt;Says she'll be talking to the manager to get my bitch-ass fired.

&gt;I say sure, here's the manager ma'am. Hand the phone to mom.

&gt;By now, everyone is out (and I mean everyone. Including the people from the back).

&gt;My mom listens through her tirades. Bitch must have the most colorful mouth ever. Calls me all sorts of names. My dad's mouth is a scrunched line. He really hates bitchy customers.

&gt;After lady runs out of breath, my mom says the best four-liner joke ever.

&gt;""That is my daughter.""

&gt;Complete and utter silence. Woman mumbles something, gives credit info and such, hangs up.

&gt;Still surprised she wanted food after all that. Damn she must be hungry.

&gt;Sitting outside to see who this lady is.

&gt;Lo' and behold, a whale managed to crawl up from the sea!

&gt;She waddles her way towards the front. Back then, the front entrance was modeled as a tunnel. Beautiful carvings of the wood with etched-images in the glass faces the customers. 

&gt;Woman was so big she was touching the wall and the fucking carved wood with her body. My mom and my dad are in the front. Mom has a poker face. Dad has the biggest frown. Is sharpening a cleaver.

&gt;Can't resist. Walk up to the front desk and hug my mom. Smile at her.

&gt;Lardass's eyes widen a bit.

&gt;""Fucking skinny little chink,"" she mutters. This does not escape my dad nor my mom.

&gt;""Teach yer daughter not to be such a little smart-ass,"" she says to my mother.

&gt;Is actually trying to give my mom ""advice"" on how to raise me. Maybe an attempt to undo her wrong from earlier?

&gt;Tells her that they're using me as slave labor and not feeding me any shit. Says because of lack of food, I'm a disrespectful delinquent.

&gt;My mom's poker face gets a very dark tone. My dad stares. His stare is scary.

&gt; He follows her out, constantly sharpening his cleaver. I follow because oh man this is too rich.

&gt;He is just standing in front of her car, sharpening dat cleaver. 

&gt;Eyes never leave the ball of blubber.

&gt;Lady is in a hurry to leave. Sweating visibly (from my dad or from her fatass lugging the food, idk).

&gt;Lady drives so fast and recklessly in order to get out of there, she drives over a curb. Huge screeching. Big-ass dent at the side of her car as she zooms away.

&gt;My dad is cursing the whole time, saying that he'll carve that fucking whale up if he see's her again.

&gt;Never see her again.


TL;DR

Landwhale wanted free dumplings. Tried to  calls me a bitch and a slut for saying no. Pretty much told colorful versions of me to my mom. Had the audacity to tell my mom how to raise me. Dad scared the fuck out of her with his asian-man-and-sharpening-his-damn-cleaver trick.

1375807351.0	1jtjnr	Working at a public library apparently means that I am a slave to all tax payers	Above_an_F	419	76	65	"I work at a Public Library.  Most days, I love my job.  I am fairly young (in my 20s) and most of my coworkers are sweet old ladies.  I mostly handle the teen area and the computers.  On most days, I love my job.  I get to help people find just the right book, I get to re shelve books (something about that Dewey Decimal System just makes me feel happy and calm), and every once in a while I get to shush someone.  But some days I hate the people that come in.

On this specific day, I had brought in home-made cookies for my coworkers.  They always baked for each other and I decided to contribute.  I made lots of different kinds, and even had lots of frosted sugar cookies for a girl scout troop that was volunteering that day.  The cookies were in the employee lounge. 

Myself and some of the girl scouts were exiting the lounge when I saw this family standing there looking at books.  There was a mom who was VERY LARGE, one teenage daughter who was dressed in a revealing manner and was large as well, and a little boy who couldn't have been more than 7 years old.  He spotted the cookies right away and asked his mother if he could have one.  She politely told him that they didn't belong to him and that they could have some cookies later at home if he was good.

At this point, I couldn't help myself and wanted to get him a cookie.  He had asked politely and quietly, his mother had been nice and polite about it, and I was feeling generous.  So I went back into the lounge, grabbed a cookie, and brought it out to him.  He lit up and thanked me.  I then went back to organizing books.  

I was on the other side of the shelves they were at and I guess they didn't see me because they all changed.  The mother, in a matter of seconds, had turned from nice, plump lady to a devilish hamplanet The mother had apparently grabbed the cookie from the little boy and he had started crying.

**Mother:** Sweety, you don't need this cookie, you are already SUPER fat and if you keep having cookies nobody will love you

This little 7 year old kid was a bit chubby, but not that bad and here was his mother who WAS HUGE and stealing his cookies.  She ate the cookie in one bite, at which point her daughter looked up and said she wanted a cookie too.  They went and found me and demanded that I get them another cookie.

At this point I was angry, the cookie had been for the little boy and now his mother had not only taken it from him, but demanded that I feed her daughter as well.  When I told her no and said that the cookie had been for the boy and not her, she started yelling at me about her blood sugar and her ""condition"".  She then got really up in my face and told me her taxes paid my salary and how I have to do everything that she says because I work at a public library that she finances. She also said that she was going to get me fired.  

She and her daughter went to go find my boss and LEFT THE LITTLE BOY BEHIND.  I went, got him a cookie, and watched his eyes light up as he enjoyed it.

Since my last installment, things around the house got more and more awkward. My internship ended so I was home much more often and to add to my discomfort, Eris no longer just goes to sleep in her underwear but walks around the house in a T-shirt and panties. Now if you guys recall from Part II, she purchased plenty of clothes for when she loses weight, well weight loss never came around and this is what pursued.

&gt;Come back from Britney’s house ( Eris knows we are hanging out, she gets pissed says shit but w/e)

Eris and mom are talking.

&gt;Eris: mom I have gained a lot of weight and it’s not coming off

&gt;Mom: Eris, I don’t know sometimes there are things science can’t explain (LOL)

&gt;Mom: Eris, remember Mr.___ and Mrs.___

&gt;Eris: yeah

&gt;Mom: well she and her husband were trying for over a year to have a baby; they went to doctors, took medicine, everything and still couldn’t have a kid. But then her friend recommended her a really good psychic, and he was able to predict that they would have a son. And guess what, two months later she was pregnant with a baby boy. The world is mysterious place. Science can’t explain everything. (Now mind you Eris and mom were HARDCORE atheists and laughed at me for being religious)

&gt;Debating whether or not I should waste my breath

&gt;Eris: Do you think they help fat people as well?

&gt;Mom: Eris, don’t talk about yourself like that. Its not your fault, you took the pills, You ate salad every night, you drank your Gatorade, you did your part. You are a healthy person trapped in a fat person’s body.

&gt;Mom: I’ll call ___ and find the same Psychic she used, that way we know what he says is true

&gt;Eris and mom now become members of some online psychic organization. Whatever, I am not going to be able to change shit. Night time rolls around, and I am on my laptop.

&gt;Eris: hey Ares, what were you and Brittany doing together?

&gt;Ares: touching our toes. 

&gt;Eris gets pissed off, and then replies 

&gt;Eris: well if you haven’t heard already, I have good news.

&gt;Ares: Go on,

&gt;Eris: The Psychic I was talking to is a Doctor, (OKAY) he told me that the reason I am not losing weight is because I am not a whole person yet (yeah you are 3 whole people). He told me that I need to find my passion, and the shackles that bind me to failure will uplift. (this guy a  Doctor, Psychic, and Poet)

&gt;Me: That sounds really deep, he must have charged you a lot to hear that

&gt;Eris: Shut up, seriously who cares how much I spend now, it is an investment in my future!

&gt;Me: So you aren’t going to return your clothes

&gt;Eris: If you weren’t so cute you’d be out of this house by now

&gt;Me: you know you could go to the gym 

&gt;Eris: No thanks, I don’t want a bunch of meat heads hitting on me.

&gt;Me: they have dance classes there that might just be your passion

So she agrees to go, I don’t do any of those dance classes but Nekane is a big fan, so her and Nekane go together. Now I wasn’t there to witness this, but I get a call from a Nekane after they came back.
Supposedly shit went down…

**Nekane’s account of the Event**

&gt;Nekane comes to pick up Eris

&gt;Eris is dressed up as if she is going clubbing, wearing a skimpy skirt with ass hanging out, high heels, makeup. 

&gt;Nekane tells her that they are going to Zumba and that people don’t dress up for this

&gt;Eris makes nasty comments that Nekane’s family can’t afford to let her wear nice clothes when she goes out. 

&gt;Nekane takes her anyway.

&gt;Eris gets to the class, feels good she is the center of attention and thinks everyone is *noticing* her

&gt;During the class she sweats so much that if she doesn’t wipe her face, she would drown in her own sweat and makeup.

&gt;Eris starts grinding on the only dude in the class (in fucking ZUMBA) 

&gt;dude gets pissed off and tells her that this isn’t a fucking club and even if it was he isn’t interested in desperate moms.

&gt;Eris runs out crying, Nekane drives her home

[Artist depiction]( http://i.imgur.com/8SgZRKc.jpg) of the event.

&gt;Eris is forever traumatized and will never return to the gym after making a fool of herself.

**Resuming**

&gt;Nekane knows that my house is currently not suitable for life with Eris’s crying so I spend the night at her house (slept in separate beds). Nekane drops me off in the morning, and Eris sees me leaving her car.

&gt;Eris: someone thinks he is a big pimp

&gt;Me: someone is a desperate mom

&gt;Eris: Look you shouldn’t be friends with Nekane, she hates America

&gt;Me: Whut

&gt;Eris: All Chinese hate America they always did and always will

&gt;Me: What are you talking about

&gt;Eris: first they bomb Pearl Harbor, then they send us poisonous toys, tainted meat, and sold nuclear secrets to Russia.

I check her face to see if she is trolling, nope fat bitch is dead serious. Can’t comprehend the sheer level of ignorance. Rather than lecture her on geography and history I talk to Eris about her relationship with Nekane.

&gt;Me: okay Eris, if Chinese people are so evil, then why was she your friend since High school.

&gt;Eris: I don’t judge people because of their heritage

&gt;Me: Are you listening to yourself?

&gt;Eris: There is difference between being friendly with Chinese people and sticking your dick in them.

**Lesson for life**

If you treat people like Eris, as fellow adults you will lose your shit. Instead treat people that behave this way as if they are a 7 year old and don’t know any better. 

""Never argue with stupid people. They will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience."" –Mark Twain

&gt;I go to take a shower 

&gt;Come out 5 Missed Calls from Brittany … oh Shit.

&gt;Call Britney, she answers

&gt;Turns out that fatso told Brittany that I was sleeping with Nekane

&gt;Plead with Brittany tell her Eris is lying, Brittany is sobbing too much to have a coherent conversation

&gt;Go to confront Eris, Eris is eating packs of flavored cream cheese with the occasional piece of whole grain bagel. (1 Bagel per 1 [creamcheese]( http://i.imgur.com/EsJzKNE.jpg) )

&gt;Me: Eris do you enjoy ruining my life

&gt;Eris: Look Brittany is my friend, it is my responsibility to tell her these types of things

&gt;Me: I thought you hated her

Me and Eris continue fighting, for a while. I give up leave and head over to clear stuff up with Brittany. 
Brittany believes me but is disappointed I didn’t tell her that I was spending the night at another girl’s house. Which is perfectly understandable.
 I also inform Brittany about Eris’s sexual advances and that she is jealous of me and Brittany’s relationship. Therefore, Eris will say anything to see mine and Brittany’s relationship fail. Brittany has a hard time believing my story so I decide to prove it to her.

&gt;I come home in a bad mood so Eris thinks that me and Brittany are having problems

&gt;Skip dinner, get on laptop with shirt off while having Skype open. (Webcam on, microphone on, speakers muted)

&gt;Eris eventually finishes eating and comes into the room

&gt;Eris: Did things not work out between you and Brittany?

&gt;Ignore her and don’t make eye contact

&gt;Eris comes and sits next to me in the sleeping bag and puts her arm around me

&gt;Eris: look you deserved better than her anyway

&gt;Eris starts to rub my back

&gt;Eris: your muscles are so big, I love running my fingers through the creases.

&gt;Eris: how about you sleep in bed with me tonight so you can get your mind off Brittany.

&gt;Phone rings, grab to answer it and go downstairs

&gt;Brittany: WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK

&gt;Me: [I told you]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AajslFuPro)

&gt;Brittany: What the fuck, does your mom know?

&gt;Me: she wouldn’t believe me anyways

&gt;Brittany: you aren’t sleeping over there anymore what if she rapes you?

&gt;Me: The sacrifices I make just to go to ______ University

&gt;Brittany: Stop joking around I am picking you up right now and you are calling your dad tomorrow that’s final

&gt;Brittany hangs up and picks me up

&gt;I spend the night at Brittany’s house.

Soon enough it was morning, I argued with Brittany, I didn’t want to call my dad but Brittany was persistent.

**Note to reader**

The reason I didn’t want to talk to my dad about this was not because it would be awkward or that he wouldn’t believe me. It was that I didn’t him to think that I was complaining. My dad had a rough experience in the military and the problems he faced in a day make all of my problems trivial. He never complained about his hardships so I didn’t think my  ‘touchy’ sister problem warranted his time. 

&gt;I call dad reluctantly

&gt;Explain to him what happened last night

&gt;He sighs,

&gt;Me: Dad I know this is hard to believe but

&gt;Before I can finish he cuts me off

&gt;Dad: son I believe you, and I was worried this might happen

&gt;Me: I’m confused

&gt;Dad: This isn’t the first time something like this happened. When you and Eris were just little, Eris was also just as *touchy*. We didn’t think too much of it until one night we caught her in your room when you were five. Me and your mother were lost, we didn’t have anyone who we could go to. If people found out they would look at you and Eris as degenerates, and both of you would be stigmatized for the rest of your life.

&gt;Dad:  We didn’t want some psychologist labeling you and Eris as having some mental disorder and have you both on medication for the rest of your life. I have seen firsthand what that medication does to people, so your mom and I agreed that it was in both of your best interest to split you and Eris up.

&gt;Me: Do you still love mom?

&gt;Dad: yes of course I still love your mother, I love Eris too, but it was for the best son. That’s why I sent you to stay at their house; I didn’t want you growing up not ever knowing your mother and sister. God only gives us one family.

I left the phone pressed to my ear and stood there. 

Motionless.

**TL;DR**

Eris tries to ruin my relationship with me and Brittany. I tell Brittany of Eris’s advances towards me and I inform my father.

**Letter to the Reader**

I know that FPS is supposed to be light-hearted humor but I really wanted to share this story with someone. Part V will be released maybe Monday or Tuesday.

1372072711.0	1gynxv	Piles of snacks and bottles full of Coke...	Tamyu	404	68	100	"I just stumbled upon this subreddit, and have spent several hours alternating between laughing, shaking my head in disbelief, horror, and occasionally hope. I can't say I have a lot of stories to contribute, but there is one event that I think might be worthy of being posted. 

Anyway, a background. I am not massively obese, but am not thin by any stretch either. (160cm, 70kg) I live in Japan and have lived here for around the past 15 years. When I left the US, it wasn't that bad. Or maybe I was just oblivious, being young and 15kg lighter at the time. Anyway, I live somewhere that considers anything over a BMI of 25 to be quite large. I am not used to encountering whales, and certainly not full out planets. The biggest people I run into regularly are about my size. 

My son was born extremely prematurely. He is extremely small for his age, and has never had the ""normal"" baby fat. As he had quite a bit of medical stuff to worry about, his diet has always been pretty closely monitored - especially when he was small. Up until about three, we had to keep track of certain vitamins and minerals in his food as he would process some correctly, some would spike in his blood and not be filtered out properly, and some he couldn't absorb at all. He is wonderfully healthy now, and we have very little to worry about these days, but the beginning was pretty stressful.

Sorry for the long backstory, but I wanted to show that I had no acquired immunity to the oily auras, and that I was quite sensitive about my son's health and well being. Now on to the actual story.

When my son was one, he was finally healthy enough for us to make the trip to the US to introduce him to my family there. I hadn't been back for about five years. In my absence, it seemed that the world had... well.... *grown*. Horizontally. This was made more obvious as family had moved out of the city while I was gone. 
Thrilled to potentially have access to cheap baby clothes, I visited a local Walmart. As we were walking up to the door, I heard a groaning and wheezing sound from behind us. I turned around, honestly concerned that someone might be having some kind of health episode. 
There was a group of women who, I can only estimate from browsing that body type site, were around my height but weighed 300 to 350. It was actually kind of fascinating because one woman's hips had made little tables on each side. The tables looked to be almost sturdy and barely moved as she waddled along. She had her purse resting on one of them, and some large plastic cup on the other. One of the others was pushing/leaning on a massive stroller. I am not into staring so just sort of thought ""wow"" and continued on inside. 

(Insert about an hour of amazement at my size clothing being an ""M"", mother-in-law in shock that she has to shop in the petite section even though she is a little roly-poly thing, and amazement that there are plus sized baby clothes. Baby clothes. Up to 6X.)

After finding that none of the baby clothes are something I would put on my son even if paid (we don't like Disney, don't like sports, and don't like trucks n' tools), I get ready to leave the baby area. 
The hip-table beast stops me. 
""Yer baby looks so sick. What you feeding him?""
I smile, act nice, start to say something. ""He..."" 
""Oh my god, yer gonna make him gay with that shit on him."" He was wearing something gender neutral, but it had purple in it. ""You gotta make him a big man."" She calls for one of the herd to come over, and they bring the stroller. I finally see inside. There is a little boy, I have no idea how old. He had so many rolls... Just, so many. His clothes were clearly tight, and puffy rolls were leaking out everywhere. He was laying there in a bed of empty snack packets. Probably twenty of them, maybe more. The mother (?) ruffled through some of them and pulled out one that still had some crackers or cookies or something in it. She tried to hand the packet to my son. I stopped her, because, well, besides being flat out disgusting and nasty - nutrition concerns and all that. She laughs and says ""Oh, don't worry, they're not stale. We just opened them after coming in here. He gets so cranky without something to snack on. He is gonna be a big man just like daddy!""

They arrived there the same time I did. I saw them come in... And had already given him a literal pile of snacks. A pile. I was stunned. I again refused, citing the fact that he was on a special diet, and she got nasty. ""I should call the police on you, you are starving him. He looks anorexic. What, you so ashamed of your weight that you starve your own kids? That is fucked up."" (Note: I actually don't doubt he did look sickly thin, he actually was at the time.) 

I just turned and walked away. They didn't chase after me.

(insert an old woman coming up and telling me that I was giving my son the gay by dressing him in purple... Not a fun shopping trip.)

When I left, they were out on the benches by the vending machines. One per bench. I watched as hip-tables bought a big thing of Coke and poured it into a baby bottle. 

It was just really sad.

Tonight, I needed to pick up some tickets being sold in a student cafe, famous and infamous for hangover fare; English breakfasts, burgers, pizzas, alcohol and coffee. Being a Brit, I joined the queue of ~15 people. Green text, commence!

&gt;Be me, 5""3, 115lbs of mountain-climbing, vegan lady. Be in tenuous recovery for disordered eating. Be at back of queue, headphones on, trying not to infringe upon tiny chinese girl in front of me.

&gt;Don't be Loud Hamplanet, a 5""5 quivering mass of gelatinous lady lard, squeezed into tiny short-shorts and bralet that are stringently protesting their grim fate. 

Seriously, I can hear buttons and zips groaning. I can hear seams creaking. I can hear the fibres of those poor items screaming in abject horror. movingon.jpg

&gt;Don't be LH's equally loud but comparatively diminutive lady friends.

&gt;Don't join the queue directly behind me. Don't invade my personal space. You are not America, you are not a battleship, do not invade.

&gt;My personal pace has been compromised. I cannot look left without making eye contact with Minion1. I cannot take deep breaths without my back coming into contact with LH's spectacular cuuuuuurves. I can hear LH, Minion1 and Minion2 conversing over my music. 

&gt;They are discussing the food available in the cafe. Note that there are 3/4 people actually purchasing consumables (usually coffees, one lad with a pint and his head on the table, finalexams.doc) at this time of the evening. Cafe is renowned for being cheap and greasy when you're hungover. 

&gt;LH is displeased, I can tell from the whining tone of her really fucking loud voice and the way that all people in a 15 metre radius are now wincing. 

&gt;""Whyyyyy don't they have any desserts??? All they sell is those American style pancakes with the syrup."" 

The cafe is situated in the middle of my halls, she cannot live more than one minute away. There is also a shop, adjoining the cafe, that sells sweets, crisps, ice cream, etc etc. Bitch is not going to starve.

&gt;Minion2; well, if you really need something, why not just have the pancakes? You can get them with ice-cream, if you want?

&gt;MFW dis bitch is pandering to the oversized toddler who is now literally stamping her foot. (I feel the building shake)

&gt;LH; I WANTED A PROPER DESSERT. I THOUGHT THEY DID CAKES. THEY DO COFFEE, WHY DON'T THEY DO CAKES? 

&gt;I am really struggling to stay quiet, but in true British fashion, I do. 

&gt;Get to front of queue. fuckingfinallyfuckingstudents.ac.uk Headphones off, buy tickets, specify that on our table there is one vegan, two vegetarians and one kosher. All this is fine with people that it concerns. 

&gt;It is not fine with LH, whomitdoesnotconcern.stfu

&gt;""Ooooooh, a vegan? Poor you, having such a picky person to sit with."" 

&gt;Condescension and bitches get on my tits. nothavingthis.gif

&gt;Fake smile, ""Actually, I'm the vegan. I'd like to think I'm not picky, I think it's the right lifestyle choice for me, and there wasn't an issue at (previous event run by same people) to cater for me.""

&gt;Interjection by smiling lad selling tickets ""And this time there's another person already requested a vegan diet, so it's really no trouble at all!""

&gt;Smile at smiley lad, think all is well, gather things to leave. 

&gt;""Well I just think it's awful, you shouldn't go to catered events if you're not going to eat what everyone else does! And no wonder you're so horribly skinny, eating no real food and being fussy like that. You're so tiny, how could you ever think that denying yourself food will make you beautiful?""

&gt;It takes a lot to anger me. I am already having a bad day. I am recovering from severe eating issues. I am vegan because I believe in animal rights. This bitch has caused apoplectic rage. I am shaking, I am iridescent red, I am FURIOUS (I am, however, still British, so rage is masked in politeness.)

&gt;""Excuse me, but I don't really believe that this is any of your business. I like being vegan, I'm much happier knowing nothing suffered for my food and I feel healthier when I eat vegan, and, although this may come as a shock to you, I don't believe that 'real food' is exclusively cake, pancakes or any of the other shit you have discussed in the last 20 minutes. I did not comment upon what YOU chose to eat, I would appreciate the same level of respect""

&gt;Moment of silence in room. thankfuckfordebating.doc LH starts up again, but I simply turn and leave the building, tickets in fist, revelling in my glory. then go home and cry to my flatmate becausetheconfidenceisnotstrongwiththisone.gif

TL;DR I queue in front of a Hamplanet, she doesn't approve of my life choices, takes it upon herself to be triggering as fuck.

EDIT; so this has been the source of some drama, I guess. I don't really want to get involved. I shall just say that I know that stalking this sub is unhealthy for me, I know that I have issues with food and that reading about other people's issues with food is not going to help that. I am in a ""tenuous"" recovery. I'm doing my best, but I'm struggling. I used the word 'triggered' because I didn't want to insinuate that the girl was being intentionally rude. I honestly think she did not know that her words could affect me. I certainly don't think I'm better than anyone, and I do not claim to take the high ground. I wrote a horrible thing about a girl I barely know, in a rage fit, and now I feel awful about it. If anyone requests more info, I'm happy to respond. 

Also, I'm so sorry if I actually angered people to the point of wanting to punch me. I honestly just thought that I had a moderately amusing story for a sub that I really (in a very unhealthy way) enjoy."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; &gt; live in what I call ""jogger's paradise""

&gt; &gt; house is right in front of a huge, half-circle street

&gt; &gt; measure run by how many half-circles I can run

&gt; &gt; never bother with actual distance

&gt; &gt; figure half-circle is about .25 miles

&gt; &gt; coolstorybro.wav


&gt; &gt; action -&gt; jump to -&gt; this morning

&gt; &gt; rainy morning, perfect for running

&gt; &gt; so happy, love running in the rain

&gt; &gt; gear up, run 6 half circles

&gt; &gt; figure that's about 1.5miles

&gt; &gt; notbadbro.wav

&gt; &gt; finish run, all sweaty and feeling good

&gt; &gt; take shoes off at door when-

&gt; &gt; I didn't want to overheat?

&gt; &gt; ""DID YOU EAT YOU SHOULD EAT GO EAT""

&gt; &gt; start to make sunny side up egg, whole grain toast, strawberries, skim milk and coffee.

&gt; &gt; ...yes...

&gt; &gt; Grammy Hammy barges into room

&gt; &gt; ""HOW MUCH DID YOU RUN THIS MORNING""

&gt; &gt; I dunno, maybe six half circles?

&gt; &gt; ""IT'S A HALF MILE.""

&gt; &gt; ...

&gt; &gt; ""YOU RAN THREE MILES.""

&gt; &gt; [MRW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m67d1kDhLU1rnarbco1_500.gif) I realize this means I've been running double what I thought I was.

**Chapter Two**

It became clear, as we were led to our booth, that my date's prior suggestion of meeting for dinner was prompted not out of caution or a consideration for safety, but rather an incredible desire for food. Our pace – already sluggish on account of my companion's waddling gait – was slowed considerably as she paused at each table we passed, drawing uncomfortable stares from the people whose meals she was ogling.

“Oh, it all looks so *good*!” she gushed, leaning forward to examine a plate of waffles. “I might have to order one of *everything*!”

I did my best to react as though she had told a joke. “Heh, well... that would be expensive.”

“I know, right? I'm sure glad you're paying!”

This was news to me. At no point in any of our exchanges – admittedly brief though they had been – had the topic of my subsidizing her meal been discussed. I held my tongue for the moment, intent as I was on not contributing to the atmosphere of awkwardness she was creating. Besides, for all I knew, it was a continuation of the same off-beat joke, a subtle commentary meant to show her self-awareness.

We finally arrived at our booth, an event that was heralded by our hostess offering a weak excuse and scurrying away... and then came the spectacle that was Porcina struggling to fit between the booth's bench and its table. Rather than sliding in sideways, as anyone else might do, she faced the bench head-on and placed a slipper-clad foot on its surface. For a moment, it looked as though she intended to step up on her seat, but instead, she scooted herself forward until she was kneeling, then turned and squeezed the rest of the way in. The entire performance was over in only a few seconds, leading me to believe that it was very well-rehearsed.

I took my seat in the normal fashion, and struggled to keep eye contact. “So, what was that about me paying?” I asked. She laughed out loud in response, an act which began as a forced snigger, grew into a self-important guffaw, then descended into what was little more than a staccato hiss from between her teeth.

“You... you don't expect *me* to pay, do you?” she asked. “Like a lady would *ever* pay for her own meal!”

“Well, I'm pretty broke,” I answered. “I can pay for my own meal and maybe yours, but not if you plan on sampling the entire menu.” I did my best to say it casually, as though we were engaging in witty banter. 

To my relief, she seemed to play along. “I was just *kidding*!” she said, reaching forward and clasping my hand... though no mention was given towards what she had been kidding *about*. I considered pressing her further, but decided not to risk the result: Her voice had been exceptionally loud until that point, drawing stares from the same people whose personal space she had previously invaded. It was a welcome change when, without further ceremony, she opened up her menu and began perusing its contents.

Several minutes passed in silence. I decided on an unimpressive hamburger for myself, reasoning that I'd be able to eat fairly quickly. By then, I'm embarrassed to admit, I had yet to decide if I would be making a hasty exit or accompanying the young woman home, but I wanted to afford myself options for either scenario. Several more minutes passed, punctuated only by a waitress bringing us each a glass of water. Porcina didn't even look up.

“What are you thinking of having?” I asked. This was my attempt at conversation, as tired and trite as it might have been. It was also ultimately in vain. Porcina was wholly engrossed in her menu, either unable or unwilling to be distracted. I noticed, to my chagrin, that her lips appeared to be silently forming each word that she read. She was clearly literate – after all, she had posted a legible advertisement on Craigslist – but after some careful observation, I could still recognize terms like “deep-fried” and “gravy” being voicelessly pronounced.

At last, she rose from her stupor... and she seemed to have undergone a complete shift in personality. Where once she had been assertive and loud, she then struck me as being passive and shy, almost vulnerable. When she spoke, it was with a high, nasal voice that was reminiscent of a grade school girl. “How much money do you have?”

“Uh, about thirty dollars,” I replied. In truth, I was carrying only my credit card, but I was unwilling to give her carte blanche. Like flipping a switch, the old Porcina was back, practically shouting her answer.

“Awww, you really *are* broke, *aren't* you?” she cooed. Once again, she reached forward and clasped my hand. “I'll tell you what: Tonight, it's my treat, but you won't be getting any.”

“Any what?” I dumbly asked. In response, she pulled up her sweatshirt, revealing an unbelievably rotund stomach covered in unsightly stretch-marks, and a pair of breasts – unencumbered by any undergarments – that decidedly *did not* match the ones pictured in her advertisement.

I was irked... but I was also, to my immense shame, somewhat aroused.

“Any more than *that*!” she tittered. “You can take me out again tomorrow and maybe you'll get lucky.”

The rest of the evening progressed in a bit of a haze. Porcina ordered two dinners for herself, which she quickly devoured. Then, she moved on to the french fries that had come with my burger, eating them with a nauseating mixture of mayonnaise and ketchup. “It's good!” she frequently insisted. “Try it!” Each time, I politely declined. Whenever a member of the staff would approach us, she'd find something to scold them for, only to beam at me adoringly a moment later. It was like watching two separate people inhabit the same body, one of whom was domineering and rude, the other who was incredibly passive and shy.

Throughout the entirety of the meal, she spoke at length – and with her mouth full – about all of her sexual desires, many of which revolved around a Japanese cartoon. She talked about getting “so wet” when she watched it, and how turned on she was from even mentioning it to me. It was infuriating, both because of the topic at hand and because – despite her appearance, her attitude, her behavior, and her attire – she was my best shot at getting laid that night, and I hated myself for that.

“Did you know,” she said suddenly, “that fruit is *super* bad for you?”

“Fruit?” I asked, wondering if I'd misheard her.

“They put this wax stuff on it to get you addicted to it.”

“Oh, that,” I laughed. “That's just to give it a shine. It's a marketing ploy.”

She shook her head, her eyes growing wide and fearful. “No-no-no-no-no! It's to get you *addicted*.”

“So, you never eat fruit, huh?” I asked.

“Don't be silly! Of course I eat fruit! I just make sure it's cooked first, like in a pie or something.” She glanced at the kitchen. “Oooooooh... do you think it's too late to order some *pie*?”

“Probably,” I said. “They'll bring us the check soon, and then we should get out of here.”

“*I told you*,” she screeched, making me jump, “*you're not getting any tonight!*” I sat, dumbfounded, wondering if a concerned patron would call the police. I further mused if it would be better to turn myself in, if only to have an excuse to escape. Before I could say anything, though, Porcina reached out yet again and grasped my hand. “Aw, I can't stay mad at you!”

It was then that I decided: I wouldn't be going home with her, nor her with me. It took longer than it should have, but I got there in the end. I'd leave, delete her email, block her from my instant messenger, and find someone else to fuck.

If only it had been that simple. True to her word, Porcina did pay for the food... but in the end, I paid a hefty price, as well.

Saddo - A's ex gf of A, tragical backstory, but killed any sympathy anyone would have for her by going out of her way to shit on everyone's parade. ""If I must be miserable, everyone else has to be miserable with me.""

***
As previously stated, Spouse-a-tron and I are LRPers. This story happens on a sunday adventure (single quest line, get from point a to point b with a series of encounters.) where we were breaking into a dungeon. 

The party going out is the Gypsy party (Who steals carts? Gyppos sir!) and yes we've made all those jokes. We are cartoon hollywood gypsies. Think Madam Simza from the second Sherlock Holmes film with RDJ. (Mmmm RDJ). Due to reasons, I wasn't playing with the party, but I was monstering. The party consisted of Spouse-a-tron (hunter tracker, scout with light armour/axe), Beetus (group trader, is *supposed to be a sly talker* guess who isn't.), A (knife bunny), Gravedigger (Voodoo magic priest) and Saddo (mage, doesn't know the spells and is therefore utterly useless). Carguy is the GM, an is handing plot out like an all you can eat buffet.

The party are given their plot, which is that they must break into a temple to steal some magical mirror shards. This is a Temple of a Goddess who is actively hated by gypsies IC because they were screwed over by a magical item of hers in ages past.

First few encounters go well, the fighty people actually kill the monsters, and they all survive. They reach a village which is the trade for supplies part. To trade for supplies all they have to do is use their free talky skills to get some discounts. To do this, they have to use a free talky skill to convince the townspeople to not believe a crazy anti gypsy person (played by me). Beetus has been complaining that he hasn't been able to use his trader skills yet, so we start setting him up for that.

A is not meant to be playing a talky character, he's the knife guy. He does all the groundwork, setting up Beetus for using his skills. Beetus fails to take the initiative, and ends up botching everything. A rescues it, and manages to convince a village to sell them some health potions on the cheap, again trying to set it up so Beetus can use his skills and contribute.

&gt;Beetus is sitting on a treestump off to the side.

**""IT'S TOO HOT...CAN'T WE JUST FINISH THIS ANOTHER DAY?""**

""Beetus, dude it's been 15 minutes...and we had one fight, which you stood still for."" Says A.

**""But I got *assma*, I can't do a lot of running. I will have an attack if my blood sugar goes down from running.""**

&gt;You ain't run yet

&gt;that's not how asthma works

&gt;'assma'? REALLY?

At this point the ""villagers"" are convinced by mad ranting woman (me) that the gypsies are all scum and ought to be run out of the village. Beetus then rouses himself from his stump, after several tries, and turns to a villager and starts finally trying to play his trader. **""uh, does anyone want to buy an amulet or something?""**

The villagers' faces: [nope](http://img.pandawhale.com/49264-Nope-gif-5cYC.gif)

I get to IC bitch him out, ""Y'ALL GYPSIES ARE ALIKE, GET AWAY WITH YE BEFORE YA STEAL OUR CHILDREN AND DEFLOWER OUR WOMENFOLK, STEALING OUR FOOD AND STINKING UP THE PLACE WITH YOUR UNWASHED SELVES.""

&gt;notice how I didn't have to use my imagination to come up with horrible shit this guy would do.

He *finally* gets the idea that he's meant to move on to the next encounter.  Several more encounters like that, and finally we get to the part where they actually have to break into the Temple. Beetus has sweated through every layer of clothing he has, grease and sweat dripping off his nose, chins and fingers.

&gt;Plays Oceans 11 soundtrack

The plan is simple. The guards walk around in comedically slow and predictable routes. They pretend to hop into the window, and it all goes off without a hitch.

This is when Saddo decides to change the plan. Saddo wanders off distracting the guards and ruining their comedically slow routes. She doesn't tell anyone what she's doing, and the plan is basically ruined. What follows is a total clusterfuck of everyone nearly dying, Saddo having a temper tantrum and crying that we're all being super harsh on her because she has a tragical history of being abused, and sending her away. Beetus has spent the entire disaster standing off to the side because **""I have a condition, my assma won't let me hop through the window.""**

&gt;It's an imaginary window.

Beetus chooses this point to inform Saddo exactly how she's overracting. **""Saddo, you shouldn't complain about your sad life, because people have real conditions you know. At least you don't have bad knees or assma. My low blood sugar problems gave me diabeetus. I can't do a lot of things because of it. Who cares if you were abused by boyfriends and family from the age of 11, you should just get over it. That's not a real condition. It's not like we raped you or anything.""**

&gt;We all knew she had been. Beetus was not informed because he's an asshole and nobody likes him.

&gt;We may think Saddo is irritating

&gt;But we would *never* under any circumstances comment about her tragic history like this.

&gt;because we're not insensitive chucklefucks.

Saddo looks like she's about to cry. At this point, Beetus gets rugby tackled by Gravedigger, A and I. 

&gt;Spouse-a-tron ha missed this whole ordeal by merit of being about 200 feet away in hiding because he thought they were still following ""the plan"".

Beetus's fatrolls jiggle on impact, but nothing else happens. Beetus looks surprised that someone would react. Gravedigger and A recover first, I was trapped under Gravedigger, and both make to swing at Beetus.

&gt;A is a martial arts champion.

&gt;Gravedigger is from the scary land known as Scumbernauld.

Beetus, backs up to get out of the way, falls directly into a muddy ditch.

10 foot drop, and about knee deep in mud, crud, and whatever detritus that local NEDS have thrown in.

Beetus flails like a landed whale for about 15 minutes.

**""HELP ME OUT OF HERE. MUH BLOOD SUGAR""**

&gt;[OFW](http://img.pandawhale.com/49264-Nope-gif-5cYC.gif)

Nobody moves.

**""GAUIZ. C'MON, I CAN'T DO THIS, I GOTS LOW BLOOD SUGAR. MUH ASSMA IS ACTIN UP""**

Finally, after much struggle, he crawls out of the ditch looking like a drowned moose. **""YOU GUISE THIS IS HARRASSMENT. I HAVE A CONDITION. YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME, I WILL SUE. YOU GUIZS ARE ASSHOLES.""**

Everybody is trying to contain giggles, and some of us are trying not to punch Beetus. Spouse-a-tron shows up, and Beetus latches onto him.

**""THANK GAWD YOU'RE HERE, SPOUSE-A-TRON, THEY ALL ATTACKED ME AND PUSHED ME INTO A DITCH. YOUR STUPID WHORE GIRLFRIEND MADE THEM PUSH ME BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO COME ON TO ME FOR MONTHS, AND I REJECTED HER.""**

&gt;I had told Spouse-a-tron what Beetus had done in Part VIII.

&gt;Asked Spouse-a-tron NOT to kick his ass.

&gt;Spouse-a-tron knew the truth.

&gt;Spouse-a-tron snaps because this is one of the rare times Beetus had shown his true colours in front of him.

Spouse-a-tron's eye twitches in anger. In the time we've been dating, I've only ever seen Spouse-a-tron get ""frustrated"" once. I've never seen him get full out angry, despite the copious amounts of cause he's been given. He's generally a very calm guy. Beta, as a lot of people have seen fit to point out. But today was not a day of calm.

Spouse-a-tron silently just walks up to Beetus, gets in his face.  Very calmly telling him how inappropriate his behaviour has been and how he's a terrible human being. Calm even tone of voice, but he's walking forward, which is making Beetus back up.

Can you guess what's coming?

Beetus backs up to the edge of the ditch, and Spouse-a-tron stops, leans in real close, and says ""And don't you ever speak to my girlfriend, or anyone in such a way every again. You haven't seen me angry yet. I suggest you don't push it."" With that he takes one more step towards Beetus, and without thinking, Beetus backs up straight back into the ditch.

We all wander back to see if Saddo is ok. Beetus pulls himself out of the ditch and starts sniffling about **""Beetus, Assma, conditions...this isn't my fault. Gonna sue.""**

And just wanders off. We don't see him for a few days, and then of course, about two weeks later, he moved out, so we never saw him again.

***

**TL;DR**

Beetus fails at being his character, and decides to insult the girl who's got a history of being abused. Gets rugby tackled into a ditch by three people, and then Spouse-a-tron gives him a talking to. When he did return he ate all our food in retaliation."	t5_2vzax	True
1369757405.0	1f7etx	The Fat Chronicles Part 1: The Earliest Ruslting	Lift_that_Twinkie	428	87	64	"Foreword, By Lift_That_Twinkie:

As an Airman, I've traversed many a fattopia within the United States. The logic, or lack thereof, I've heard, the rolls I've avoided. You see these things and expect to just keep on living, that the next day you'll be all good and dandy. But then one day you wake up, and you realize, they're everywhere. They're not invading, they're already here. The best you can do is try and reason with them and try to help them. These are my stories. My tragedies, my comedies. My victories and my defeats.

These are...The Fat Chronicles.


**Chapter One: The Earliest Ruslting**

&gt;Be the year 2001, I was but a child

&gt;Family decides to take me down to Providence, Rhode Island

&gt;Fuck yeah going out of state

&gt;Spend all day walking around finding various things to do

&gt;Dinner time fast approaches

&gt;Find epic restaurant called 'Fire and Ice'

This restaurant is a sort of DIY dinner situation. They have a boatload of meats, pastas, veggies, toppings, etc. All uncooked. You take a bowl and put everything you want cooked in whatever marinade or sauce you choose. The potential for fatlogic is huge. 

&gt;Unlimited food for 15 dollars.

&gt;[My childhood face](http://i.imgur.com/GyWIlf5.jpg?1)

&gt;With what kid logic I have I make the best pasta bacon chicken beef veggie with Jamaican Jerk wrap ever created. 

&gt;Feeling like a bit of a boss I begin my strut to the chef's counter

&gt;About to arrive when I feel lit

&gt;A massive force pushing me away

&gt;No please, I was so close....just let me have this

&gt;A massive woman, I'd say about 5' 4"" and 300 lbs literally pushes me out of the way so she could go first

&gt;Fatness Everdeen looks at me, 11 or so at the time, and tells me to respect my elders and let her go first.

&gt;[But I was here first!](http://i.imgur.com/z0ZeI.jpg)

&gt;Well too bad, kid, maybe this will teach you some respect!

&gt;Whatever.jpg  

&gt;Fatness gives the chef her food. Consisting of three burgers and an entire plate of pasta and assorted beefs.

&gt;Chef asks how she wants all this prepared

&gt;[HFW She want's this all on one burger](http://i.imgur.com/p04dk.jpg)

To give you some perspective, I went to the Fire and Ice in Boston yesterday, had one burger and could barely finish it.

&gt;As the chef is preparing the burger, Porkpie begins attempting to flirt.

&gt;""So how about later on you let me cook your meat""

&gt;Chef ignores her.

&gt;""We should go out for dinner and drinks later""

&gt;I'm just thinking......it's 6PM, isn't this dinner?

&gt;Chef says nothing, and eventually finishes her food

&gt;Takes about 10 minutes longer than it should have for her food to be finished

&gt;Finally chef get's to my food, and breaths a sigh of relief.

&gt;Go back to eat my super wrap.

&gt;Oh no, Madam Omnomnom is sitting at the table to my left...alone.

&gt;As I sit down I smell it...the stench. You know the one.

&gt;Smells like a smoker that hasn't bathed in weeks, and has rotten eggs in her bra for later.

&gt;Decide to suck it up and not say anything.

&gt;Completely full after one time up.

&gt;Ate my dinner without much of an issue, except that....

&gt;In the time it took me to finish my one wrap, she finished a triple burger with all that shit on it.

&gt;I'mFull.jpg

&gt;Parents go up for one more round of food and I stay put.

&gt;Since she couldn't keep to herself, naturally Fatty Arbuckle tells my parents that they should let me get more food, and not starve their child.

&gt; My dad, former Marine, looks her dead in the eye

&gt; [His Reaction](http://imgur.com/iIclWpx)

&gt;Finally, The Blob shuts up.

&gt;After we pay and get up to use the bathroom before we go

&gt;I have no face when she's up again with another burger and more pasta.

It has been more than two years since I was in that line of work so I don't have any problems talking about my former clients.



I loved most of my clients. But this one... I literally cried in my car before going into her house to care for her almost every time I saw her (twice a week). She was difficult and disgusting.
We will call her Whalema.



I say Whale also in the sense that she ""wailed"" a lot.



She was 5'9'' 700 lbs. She was bedbound because of her weight, beetus, and over laziness. She was on oxygen and had diffculty walking, but could take her self to the bathroom a few times a day.



She lived in her mom's basement and made it into her little apartment. She had two fridges and a freezer of her own down there and a bin for her mom to come down and get her dirty dishes. 
She had her bed, tv, laptop, bookcase, 3 air purifiers, and a humidfier. 


 

I was there to:




1. Give her a bed bath. You would NOT believe what I would find in her folds... food, pencils, lots remotes, hair ties, eye glasses, ketchup packets, personal lubricant bottles, wet wipes/tissues (couldn't tell if they were moist to begin with or if her sweat and yeast MADE them moist) etc. 



2. Do her laundry, stock her fridges and freezer, clean her bathroom and vacuum. 



She had everything she could ever want/need around her on her bed (which was sunken in like a taco) in pencil boxes with labels on them for remotes, medications, sex toys (I have no clue...), pencils and paper.



She was so scary looking the first time I went downstairs to meet her. She had the beediest little black eyes I have ever seen.
I went to shake her hand. ""Hi. I'm jeanie400...""
""DON'T TOUCH ME! YOU WILL KILL ME WITH THE OUTSIDE SPORES!""
Oh no not one of these...


She was overall good to do the housework for and for how big she was we generally got her bed baths done quickly.
But she would wail ""my water isn't cold enough"" ""turn my oxygen up! I can't breathe from the strong scent of whatever shampoo you use!"" or my favorite ""I gotta get up to pee so go upstairs until I yell that you can come back down again"".


But when I finished work and just had to wait for the dryer to finish, I talked with her. She liked to listen to whatever I was currently doing with my life. She said she liked to live vicariously through others. :/



I looked at the books on her bookshelf and talked with her about them. She was so intelligent and had a beautiful immagination! She could have done anything she wanted if she hadn't let food ruin her life. 



The thing that killed about this woman, and why I left the Home Health Industry was this:
This woman was recieving disability and medicaid.
She had a husband and a son once. Her husband started making more money and she started to buy, make, and eat more food. 
She drove her husband away with her addictino to food and he left her. He died later in a car accident. She used part of his life insurance money to pay for a deep fat fryer at home.


Her son who went to live with an aunt and uncle because she couldn't take care of him; her addicted hindered doing anything for anyone else, and pretty soon herself.
Her health quickly declined and the pounds kept adding and adding and one day, she couldn't get out of bed. This is how SHE told it to me. She wanted me to feel sorry for her. Nope. But I feigned a sympathetic, sad smile when she finished her story.



She was part of some programs that would drop off food for people on medicaid at her front door. I stocked that food in the fridge according to expiration date and what kind of food it was. She went through it all SO FAST.



Then, she was looking through her mail. She got coupons to Carl's. Jr.
Her favorite. After recieving all this good food, she wanted to send me to go to the nearest Carl's Junior and pick up everything there was a coupon for so she could ALL of that for dinner. And I could get whatever else I wanted for dinner on ""her"" dime teeheehe.



I said ""No. The government doesn't pay me to go do that for you and have you pay for it with our tax dollars to make your condition worse. It is against your doctor's orders to eat fast food and I will not assist you with that.""



She yelled and screamed but when I didn't respond she conceded and I made her something that meals on wheels or something brought her.
 (Keep in mind I am 1 of 4 aides that takes care of her)


I wonder if any of the other aides have bought her Carl's Junior.
I talk to her mom about it on my way out one day. 
Her mom tells me that yes, the other aides do buy her Carl's Junior and she buys it for them as well.



I lose it. I get in my car and call my home office immediately and tell them what I have just learned. Home office called the mom. Mom found out what a serious offense and rule violation this was. 



Mom goes downstairs and scolds Whalema. Whalema calls my company and tries to get me fired.
They tell her they have indeed confirmed that she has been using money she was supposed to be using for her care (not FOOD) to buy herself bad food and bribing aides to do it for her.
She is under revision; they don't know if they can continue to give her care after this, legally.



I was now the least favorate aide at my work. Seems most aides have had a few turns with Whalema and gotten some free meals out of it. Whatever.



I hate healthcare assistance fraud. I couldn't handle it. And the prospect of knowing that I could meet and care for someone else that was guilty of fraud because of fatlogic and food addciction made me leave the industry.


Sorry this was so long, but I thought it would be appreciated.
WAY TL;DR

Because of the nature of the hospital and care, we have a LOT of bariatric patients. As with anyone, our bariatric patients vary in nature and temperament. Many are lovely, many are not. 

This is a story of Porcinette, one of two truly terrible cases.

&gt;Picks up the phone and calls Dominos

&gt;""You know, it's ridiculous that you people don't feed your patients properly. We're humans, you know! We get hungry, too!""

1368252269.0	1e47x5	Here We Go: The Tale of Tubbs		387	48	60	"First time posting a Fat People Story, Be gentle! Probably a lot more back story than necessary, but if I post more, at least you'll know what's up. I'm not sure about greentext either, but I'll give it a shot.  

**TL;DR roommate turned out to be a disgusting, food-hoarding disease factory**

Before we begin, allow me to offer you some insight into my wonderful life. Growing up, my dad was Police Chief in our little town and a rather GIGANTIC man (6'6"", 250lbs, not fat but not skinny). My brother was a highschool football star and a wrestler until he blew out his knee (6'3"", 225 lbs of ""twisted steel"" as he says). My mom was a little thing, 5'6"" and I don't think I've ever seen her weigh more than 120lbs until she hit her 50's. Add me, the baby, and my older sister, the middle child, and you have a lower-class family of five. 

Me being the youngest.  

In my family, once you're old enough to feed yourself, it's first come, first served.   

I was never fat.  

None of us were, except maybe dad, and his reason was because locals he helped out would always bake him little pies and whatnot for his lunch and take them to the office. Sometimes we got pie. Love me some pie. 

Food eventually meant more to me than gold.  

**Enter Tubbs.**  

She was a friend of mine in high school, more a relationship of convenience at first. I was shy and relatively scary-looking to most people (pushing 6' and one of the whitest people you'll ever meet, with REALLY dark brown hair and eyes. Irish-Italian, yeah baby.) Tubbs was short. Ridiculously short to me, at 5'4"", and weighing in at a whopping 275 throughout high school. She always complained that ""her parents were poor,"" blah blah blah, couldn't buy her CDs and other things she wanted. I took it with a grain of salt because I thought, in my ignorance, that if you're poor you can't be fat. Because I was poor. And I wasn't fat. 

Never explored the subject.    

Fast forward to my post-high school years. I opted out of college and decided to branch out into the wonderful world of factory work. Shit pay for a very physically demanding job, but I absolutely loved it. My bosses loved me, I was a model employee, and I had my own little apartment in town, a fifteen minute walk from my job.  

Aight.  

But, because I was only paid $275 every week (we got paid weekly instead of bi-weekly), affording my 1bdrm apartment would be next to impossible. Tubbs hears about my plight, offers to move in. I'm all for it. I even set her up with a job where I work because my bosses love me so much they ignore her obesity and hire her on the spot (To be fair, she had dropped 75lbs and was, at the time, a much smaller 200lbs. I bullshitted them into thinking she could do it.)

The apartment, as previously mentioned, only had one bedroom. Which you had to go **through** from the living room to get to the kitchen and bathroom. The living room, however, was ENORMOUS. So she set up shop out there, with a divider blocking the view of her bed from the rest of the room, using the decent-size storage closet to keep her dresser and personal things in. We split every expense, right down to cost of food.  

A month goes by. Tubbs can't keep up at work. Backaches are common in that line of work, but usually go away after a month as your body adjusts to the labor. (Mind you, there are regulations, which my employers enforced strictly) Not Tubbs. Backaches every single day, headaches, complaining that she's going to have the plant shut down because of ""unsafe work conditions"", blah blah blah.  

*smh.*  

Eventually I end up doing the work of two people for half the day, every day, so she can go sit in the cafeteria to rest her thyroid and feed her beetus (vending machine food, fuck yeah). I have funny work stories, but this isn't the time.  

Anyhoo.  

I soon notice that Tubbs is gaining weight. I also notice that the food in my apartment is disappearing, even though i'm not really eating any of it because I eat at my mom's a lot. 

I also notice that she has less and less money every week to give me for bills. 

Where the fuck is all my food?  

I talk to Tubbs. Guess what she replies?  

&gt;I didn't eat none, mah thyroid, i can't eat much anyway, nothin' but salads. Blah blah blah.  

Salads smothered in ranch, bacon, egg, and cheese (ain't knocking bacon, LOVE me some bacon, but a whole pound for a salad is fucking ridiculous). I've seen this firsthand. Fatlogic is awesome.  

As more time goes by, I begin to calculate. I'm paying for half the groceries. I'm spending over $100 a month on food, and I'm only eating about $25 worth. WTF. I thought, if she isn't eating it, she's letting other people eat my food.  

Homie don't fucking play that shit.  

My relationship with this monstrous thorn proceeded to deteriorate until I could no longer stand being in the same room with her.  I started hiding the things I wanted for myself in my closet so that I could eat them when I wanted to. She knew I was hiding food, but didn't know where. She also knew I was beginning to dislike her. She didn't care.

&gt;Teehee, she's jealous because I have a man and she doesn't. 

**Bitch, please.**

Tubby McFatass is going out with her ""boyfriend"" one night. I honestly don't think the guy knew he was her boyfriend. I should've asked him about it. He invites me, but I refuse, electing to clean the apartment. Tubby gets a suspicious look on her face.  

&gt;Don't clean my area, I'll get that after I get home from the lovin'. 

I've never even seen this guy hold her hand. But she has an answer for everything. One night she tells me:  

&gt;We don't believe in PDA. Do all our lovin' in the bedroom.  

I sleep 30ft away from her. If somebody was in my apartment, I'd know about it. 

But oh God, the image.  *Blargle*

I'm still single after my breakup with He Of Whom We Do Not Speak, and have sworn off men for a while.  Tubbs takes my decision to stay in as a sign of my social inadequacy. Stereotypical fatlogic ensues.  

&gt;You need to put on some weight, you don't have any curves. Guys dig curves. Eat a fuckin' donut. You look anorexic, I can see your ribs. Seriously, A, I'm worried about you. We'll talk about your eating disorder when I come back from my date. Try not to puke or anything. 

I wasn't even that fucking skinny. My job (and the additional load of doing hers for her) bulked me up to a good 165 from all the heavy lifting and I absolutely loved myself, whereas she had to have easily ballooned up to 280 in the three months we'd lived together. 

Bitch, whatever.

Either way. The Hamplanet is out with her ""boyfriend"" and I venture out into the living room to clean. I rarely entered that room because i considered it hers, and would always enter the apartment through the kitchen door instead of the main door. I did most of my hanging out in my room or the kitchen unless we had people over.  

I opened the door.  

I looked around.  

**Dear GOD, the SMELL.**  

She had garbage. Garbage everywhere. Bags that hadn't been taken down to the dumpster, empty convenience store food containers, all of it shoveled into neat little piles on the living room floor. It had to have been a month's worth of garbage, made by maybe three people, just strewn about my living room. (notice how I get territorial)

&gt;I'm not waiting for this bitch to clean, fuck it.  
 
I clean the living room, then Fabreeze it, then vacuum and Fabreeze again. The things I've seen. CANNOT BE UNSEEN.  

Feeling victorious, I head back to the kitchen to tackle the mess left over from my little party the night before. I open the cupboard to get a cereal bar.  

They're gone. The cupboard is empty.  

I open the neighboring cupboard.  

Empty.  I check the fridge, and the freezer.  

Barely a scrap of food to be found in the place.  

All that remains of the $200 I bought in groceries **TWO WEEKS** ago, are three boxes of instant potatoes and a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  

**WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK.**  

I'm seething. I stomp out to my closet for my hidden reserve of cereal bars. I'll bitch at her later. I open the door, move the pile of clothes hiding my suitcase, and unzip it.  

Only to find that EVERYTHING I had hidden is gone.  

Every. Single. Fucking. THING. 

I stagger out into the living room and drop to the couch, puzzled and perplexed as to how any person can eat THAT MUCH in two weeks. There was enough food in that kitchen, and hidden in my closet, to last me easily three months.  

It's all gone.  

Then I smell something.  

It's not quite mold, not quite rot. Kind of musty. Not as bad as before I cleaned this room, but something is definitely off. I follow the smell, and it leads me to her closet.  

*Dear lord, please no.*  

My fingers trembling, I ease the door open slowly.  

And almost pass out.  

Let me paint you a picture. Empty butter containers repurposed for easy shoveling, half-filled with mashed potatoes. Half-eaten cereal bars thrown about with reckless abandon. Moldy pizza. Rotted chicken on paper plates, complete with maggots (i think), grease soaked through to the wood floor. Moldy mac n cheese scattered about on the floorboards. Full bowls of MY cereal, complete with rancid, curdled milk, abandoned on her dresser. On shelves. Everywhere. Cups of kool-aid, milk, and tea lying unfinished and growing new life. Mold. Mold all around me. . I begin to notice plates of things I **can't identify**. Piles and piles. On the floor. On her dresser.  

**IN HER DRESSER.**  

Then I notice the bottles of piss. Apparently, she didn't want to risk waking me during her bingefests by going through my room to pee, so she pissed in bottles and left them in the closet. She even managed to diarrhea-shit into a wide-mouth bottle, then left it in the corner. On the floor. On. The. Fucking. FLOOR. 

**OPEN.**

My gag reflex cries out in agony and I vomit. Vomit everywhere. A flood of vomit. There were no survivors.  

This bitch has been stealing my food. Snarfing it in the living room in the middle of the night or whenever she had the chance, stashing it like a morbidly obese squirrel whenever she heard me rustle. She had been doing it for MONTHS. Wasting. MY. Fucking. Food. Just to SPITE ME. 

As I wipe the vomit from my chin, the door opens. My rage is evident. She's mortified.  

&gt;Wh-what are you doing in my room?! I told you I'd clean it! GET OUT OF MY ROOM! 

Then she notices her closet door is open. Time itself stands still in preparation of my unbridled rage. I'm not proud of what I said next.  

&gt;You DISGUSTING. Fucking. PIG. Your FAT FUCKING ASS has been STEALING MY FOOD, and WASTING IT? LIKE THIS?! 

Dramatic arm flailing. Tubbs actually tries to interject.  

&gt;You don't understand, I have a -  

&gt;No. NO. SHUT UP. SHUT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW. So help me god. Get the fuck out. Get out right now. Get the fuck out of my sight, out of my apartment, you walking pile of fucking FILTH. YOU DISGUST ME. You're a fat fuckng PIG and I can't believe I ever wasted any of my time on letting you INFEST my fucking apartment with your FILTH. I'm calling the landlord. RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Your ass is GONE. GET OUT.  

I'm too pissed to revel in my glory. Her ""Boyfriend"" is staring into the closet in disgust. My last words to that kid were beautiful.  

&gt;PLEASE tell me you're not fucking that monstrosity.  

**Tubbs left that night and never came back. I called the landlord immediately to come over and see the damage. I told him I'd clean it if he knocked the cost off of my rent, and he agreed. $300 worth. SO many gas masks. He even had people come in to kill the mold. She never came back to work, and I made damn sure everyone knew why. Last I knew, she's living three towns over.**  

  
**Sorry it's so long!**  
  

**edit:  For those of you who didn't read the comments, I found out the day after posting this that the gnarly hambeast has moved back into town, apparently to live with her aunt. The place she had been exiled to was apparently ""condemned."" There is evidence to support that she is no longer a disease infested filth machine, and I take full credit for this. She is, however, still a hambeast.**"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;MFW I realize I'm four hours into a twelve hour shift. 


&gt;I'm tasting that guy for days. 


&gt;I will never be clean again. 

So that's my story, and I'm sticking in it. I always felt really bad for this guy, being trapped in that body and hauled out of your home by a bunch of burly paramedics seems like the worst way to go. I always think about him when I hear about the 'fit at any weight' BS. You can get away with a lot of crap when you are young. But, get into middle age and it will catch up with you hard and fast. I transported lots of people who were old before their time because of obesity, alcoholism or meth. 400 pounds at 25 is bad 400 pounds at 45 is deadly. At some point you will end up doing permanent damage to your liver pancreas and joints. A large number of obese people who use mobility scooters really are permanently disabled, they have osteoarthritis caused by excess wight, or poor circulation caused by diabetes. If that gets bad enough you go blind and the doctor saws your foot off. At this point, it's kind of too late, so if you were thinking of losing weight right now is a great time to start. Fat logic is a trap, every day we make choices, some choices give us a good chance to meet our grandchildren and live a long and healthy life, some choices lead to a one way trip in the Pequad.

A side story, most of my time as an EMS wasn't doing emergency calls it was being a taxi driver. Most of the hospitals in the area had CAT and MRI scanners, but only one had the plus sized MRI. This meant that when an obese person needed to get a scan we had to transport them to and from the hospital to use the special scanner.  This was always accompanied by a huge amount of bitching from our transportee, ""Why can't they have scanners for normal people"" was a common refrain. We refereed to these calls as ""Visiting Marine World"" Sometimes even the larger MRI scanner wasn't big enough. An ER doc once told me about a patent who could not breathe when flat on his back. They apparently had to exploratory surgery to diagnose him.

**Chapter Six**

Morning dawned as it usually did in those days, with a lone ray of light piercing the tiny window of my in-law apartment. I struggled toward wakefulness, a half-remembered dream of an anthropomorphic cheeseburger still clinging to the far corner of my mind. Then, in a heartbeat, I sprang to alertness, my heart pounding as I realized that it *hadn't* been a dream. Porcina was very real... as was her roommate, Lauren.

Lauren. I had seen a side of her – admittedly without her permission – that spelled hope for me in a way that nothing else in recent memory had. Lauren, the mysterious goddess of cleanliness and pin-up style poses! Were it not for the threat of Porcina's presence, I would have sallied forth to her townhouse and... well, I hadn't thought that far ahead yet. Still, the end result would undoubtedly be glorious! It was only a question of how and when I would win her affections.

Rather than rushing headlong into the unknown, I opted to practice a little more sanity. My routine back then included (as it honestly still does) leaving the warmth of my bed for the cold leather of my computer chair, and from there, checking my email and any webcomics that I read. (Nowadays, I've added Reddit to my repertoire.) There were no new messages aside from the usual spam, which crushed a fledgling fantasy of finding a letter from Porcina's roommate. I toyed with the idea of signing into my instant messenger, but decided against it, lest I be electronically accosted by the avatar for delusional seduction. As I sat there, however, the beginnings of a plan formed in my mind.

Lauren, I remembered, was employed at a local bookstore... and Porcina had seen fit to provide me with the establishment's name. It was a corporate chain, with one location very close to the college. Saturday seemed a likely enough time for a full-time student to be working, so with a little bit of luck, I might have an opportunity for a one-on-one meeting. If she wasn't working, I could always return to the townhouse with the claim that I was taking both women out to brunch. I would pay my debt to Porcina, and have the chance to be on my best behavior for Lauren.

I excitedly dressed and showered, all the while playing over my plan in my mind. In my ideal scenario, Lauren was delighted to see me, and irritated with her roommate for effectively stealing her date. My worst-case scenario involved Lauren refusing to speak to me out of some sense of honor for her roommate's new love interest. I prepared for every eventuality, deciding to the last detail how I would contend with any complications. Finally, suitably prepared for my adventure, I left the house with a spring in my step and set my sights towards my goal.

The bookstore was quite crowded, with a resident staff to match. Though it was hardly unexpected, the setting left me feeling discouraged. In my mind, I had been picturing a quaint little shop, stacked floor-to-ceiling with leather-bound tomes, all watched over by a tiny girl in horn-rimmed spectacles. (Lauren had not been wearing glasses when I met her, nor had any been in evidence in her pictures. Such is the way of imagination though, I suppose.) Instead, I was presented with a bustling hub of bestsellers and popular fiction, a polar opposite to the antiquated storefront in my head. Finding Lauren would be a challenge, if she was even working that day.

In the end, she found me... though I discovered in that moment that I had forgotten one contingency.

“*Oh my god what are you doing here?!*” squealed a delighted voice. I turned just in time to be crushed by a wrecking ball, and kept consciousness long enough to feel two massive arms reaching out to squeeze the last vespers of breath from my lungs. “I can't believe you're *here*!” gushed Porcina. “It's like *fate* or something!”

“Yeah,” I coughed, pulling away. This was unexpected, unwelcome... *unearthly* bad luck, really. My mind still reeling, I fought to think of an excuse for my presence. “I, uh... I needed to buy a book,” I lamely offered. “What are *you* doing here?”

“Oh, I *always* come in on Saturdays!” Porcina gestured behind her. “Lauren gets me free food at the cafe!” I looked over her shoulder to see the girl in question. Lauren offered me a knowing shrug and a wave... which I realized was more interaction than I'd ever yet had with her.

I smiled and waved back, then mouthed the words “Sorry about last night.”

Lauren responded by mouthing, “What?”

Before I could try again, Porcina hooked her arm into mine. “Come on, we'll get you breakfast! I *can't believe* you're *here*!”

“That's... really nice of you,” I replied, feeling myself be dragged along. “How about you let me pay, though? A meal and a drink should cover the cost of a burger, right?” I directed my last words towards Lauren, who had fallen in step beside us. She opened her mouth as if to answer, but was interrupted by her roommate.

“No-no-no-no-no! We don't *have* to pay! Lauren gets free food!”

I looked to Lauren to verify this, but she only gave me a helpless shrug. “Well, uh... I'm sure the bookstore doesn't want her giving everything away. Let me pay for your meal, and Lauren can get her own.”

Porcina, unfortunately, was adamant. “No, save your money! You're so *poor*! Besides, you have to buy me dinner tonight!”

Such was how I found myself being treated – though I use that word loosely, as it was rather forced upon me – to pound cake, too-sweet coffee, and biscotti with the flavor of cardboard. There were egg-and-sausage sandwiches available, too, but I declined, citing – with the truth, for once – that I didn't much like eggs. (Nor, I did not say, did I much care for egg-shaped overbearing entities... but I was stuck having breakfast with one.) That was no problem for Porcina, who reassured me that she'd eat mine for me. Lauren, on the other hand, nibbled daintily on a croissant and sipped at a thermos brought from home, which led me to wonder if – with a pang of guilt – if our plentiful meal was cutting into her corporate-sponsored rations for the day.

“So, where are we going tonight?” asked Porcina, in between mouthfuls of reconstituted egg and cheese.

“I thought we decided on the same place?” I replied. Though I didn't relish the idea of paying for her to inhale two full-sized entrees, it was at least a known territory... assuming she kept to routine. “Actually,” I said, turning my attention to Lauren, “maybe you would like to join us? When do you get off work?”

“*She can't come*!” Porcina bleated. As I had come to expect, the outburst was followed by a manifestation of nauseatingly cute sweetness. “She had to *woooork* really *laaaaaate* on Saturdays, huh, *Laaaaaauren*?” Without waiting for a reply, Porcina reached out, grabbed my knee, and launched into another sing-song sentence. “Besides, *yooooou* don't want to see *heeeeeer* boobs again!”

I glanced at Lauren, who sighed, look downward, and shook her head... though she seemed far less ashamed than she had the night before. She was uncomfortable, no question... but her embarrassment seemed almost to be for Porcina's benefit, rather than her own. I was *dying* to talk to her alone by then... and as if on cue, she gave me the chance.

“I'll help you find your book,” Lauren said suddenly, standing up from her seat. “You can come find Porcina when she's finished with breakfast.”

For a moment, Porcina looked ready to protest, but the allure of free food seemed to great to overcome. “I'll be *heeeeeere*!” she cooed, giving me a little finger-wave. I took the opportunity to excuse myself without any further hesitation, standing and following Lauren deeper into the store.

“Thanks,” I said, once we were out of earshot.

“No problem,” she replied. “It's just a book.”

“No, I mean –”

“It's *just* a *book*,” Lauren repeated, still not looking at me. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was being led away from the cafe... but that I had never mentioned *what* book I had come to buy. We walked down an aisle of art books and poetry, and wound up in a tight corner at the back of the store. “Okay,” Lauren said. “What were you saying?”

“I wanted to apologize for last night,” I sputtered. Then, as an afterthought, I asked “Why are we back here?”

“Nobody comes back here but art students, and they're all hungover or stoned on Saturday mornings.”

That made sense. “Look, I'm really sorry about everything. Porcina told me about...” I stopped for a moment, considering. An almost alien urge had come over me, and although I couldn't quite define why, I wanted to be *completely honest* with this girl. In other, similar circumstances – when faced with a  girl to whom I was attracted – I had always gone out of my way to be charming, even if it meant lying through my teeth. This time, though, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Lauren was beautiful, to be sure... but I felt that lying to her would somehow, in a strange way, be like allying myself with Porcina.

I took a deep breath and started again. “Last night, I asked Porcina for more pictures of you. She sent me one. I didn't understand why she used your picture for her advertisement. I still don't. I felt terrible about the way she made you feel last night, and I figured that she must have either stolen those pictures from you or forced you to let her talk to me. Whatever happened, I'm sorry.”

Lauren looked at me with a skeptical gaze. Then, she did the most beautiful thing she could have: She laughed. Oh, that *laugh*! So bright, so full of life, so wholly and completely pure! Her laughter was like a forgotten song from childhood, the accompaniment to a first kiss, a sound of such potent happiness that it almost brought me to tears!

… And, if I'm honest, made me panic a little bit, fearful as I was that she was laughing at *me*.

“Oh, man,” Lauren said, taking a calming breath. “Heh. No, that's... heh, that's not what happened *at all*.”

Firstly, let me say that all of you in /r/fatpeoplestories have made me laugh more times than I can count. I am a long, long time lurker on Reddit but I felt I have some doozies to share with you all, including one that is so incredible, so absurd that I don’t have the physical strength to type it up or even do it justice. If I drum up interest, I may be coaxed to share it later on. This is a different, jimmy-rustlin’, rage inducin’ story about how I became slightly racist and outed myself at the same (fun times!). Part 1, at least.


Warning: This might be considered a long one. I find myself loving the long, detailed stories on here the most and that’s the only way I know how to write! So scroll down, my beloved Redditors! Comments appreciated!


Background on me at the time of incidents: 18 yr old college student in midwest Michigan at my first job stocking shelves at a chain of supermarkets in a college town on 3rd shift. At the time I was quite in shape, 9/10 (6’1, 175 lbs), gay-but-you-wouldn’t-notice, and not out (all will become relevant). 


Background on the area: The magical part of Michigan in which I lived was a bona fide breeding place of hamplanets of the most despicable, and often redneck, persuasion (in fact, I was related to a number of them). They were smelly, entitled, and invariably draped in camo print anything, as was nearly everyone in that part of the state. I was raised by the greatest parents in the word, and prior to entering college never thought much about fat people or those of other ethnicities—they were all around and I just wasn’t raised to hate anyone.


My previous experience with African-American folk consisted of well dressed, well educated, nice-as-you-please church goers—in a word, I was sheltered. Surely the stereotypes that I saw on TV and heard about in awful jokes were just legends! Surely “ratchety” black ladies were just some mean caricature! Oh, the naiveté! Upon entering college (where I was, for the first time, surrounded by my darker brothers and sisters) and getting a job, my perspectives on the world changed drastically, and I was never the same…


&gt;Be me


&gt;Be stocking my usual aisle, catching on, going fast, doing great, slingin’ dat product onto dat shelf


&gt;A faint tremor rocks the shelves, pickle jars clinking together in a melodious yet ominous chorus


&gt;Lo, the sound grows nearer! Someone is dropping ten gallon garbage bags filled with corn chowder on the floor at regular intervals!


&gt;This cannot be! I feel… a pull. Babies begin to cry, the Silent Hill alarm begins playing in my head, a desperate call from the primal centers in my brain, warning that something foul draws near!


&gt;Then I hear it, a chorus of cackling voices and flecks of Phat brand bubblegum lip gloss showering the cheap industrial floor tiles


&gt;The florescent lights above my aisle flicker and sway, warning me of the beasts’ approach!


&gt;No… not beasts—~~the largest black woman I have ever beheld and her friends~~ Lardquisha and the Moons!


&gt;Lardquisha, a 4’10, 300lb chunk of rick dark chocolate, complete with shiny pink, skin tight “wrapper” walks past my aisle, addressing my petite and innocent coworker (who we’ll call Tiff, or T) cowering behind an end cap in a voice that may only be justifiably likened to the devil scraping his pitchfork against a blackboard mingled with the death throes of Dave Chappelle after swallowing a housecat


&gt;”YO BITCH! Where da pop at? Momma gawt low bluuuuhhhhhhd shugah and I be DAYUMED if yew see MY ass up in hear passin’ out allova DIS nasty-ayuss flo cuz bitches don’ be puttin’ da pop up frunt!” (flo = floor, for those who don’t speak ratchet)


&gt;T sputters that the soda is, in fact, in the very first aisle towards the front and that they must have passed it on the way in


&gt;I assume, at this point, that the soda aisle’s proximity to the produce section must have caused them to pass it by without a sideward glance


&gt;”Aight! S’pose yo skinny ass could use a little shugah so done git some cuuuurrrrves like this biyatch righ heeyuh!” Lardquisha exclaims, gesturing to her cuuuuurrrves and doing her best to drop dat booty (all of six inches) before nearly toppling backward


&gt;Cue stretchmark-laden love handle explosion from behind pink tinfoil getup


&gt;Cue 4 inches of ashy coin slot peeking above pink tinfoil capris


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/huudA.jpg)


&gt;gagreflex.exe


&gt;onemorereasontobegay.jpg


&gt;Cue moons squawking affirmatively 


&gt;“Yeeeeeeeeeyuuuuuuh!” “Tellum guuuurl!”


&gt;Cue chorus of cackling


&gt;OMG they really showed that innocent, helpful girl who TOTES deserved to be ridiculed for no discernible reason


&gt;Cue very first conscious sensation of fathate


&gt;Cue very first conscious sensation of racism


&gt;Lardquisha and the moons trundle towards the front of the store, relief washing over me as I realize my aisle will remain unpatronized


&gt;T shoots a lingering, haunted glance at me—the glance of one who no longer has a soul—and shuffles to the bathroom to change pants soiled from fear, a brush with being eaten alive narrowly avoided


&gt;Their conversation turns to Lardquisha’s “thighroid” acting up because the Taco Bell they had just inhaled didn’t have any “shugah” in it


&gt;Moon #1 had told Lardquisha that’s what she get for drinkin dat diet Pepsi instead of making the “hell-ty” choice (of normal Pepsi, I can only surmise)


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/w6bJj.gif)


These initial impressions were only the start of the rustling de jimmies; at this point I was nauseated, in disbelief of their rudeness to T (who clearly was a bitch because she, a shelf stocker, had designed the floor plan to the store herself, thereby keeping Lardquisha’s thighroid in a less-than-healthy state), but mostly laughing to myself. 


Let me pause here to explain a few details essential to understanding my personal encounter with Lardquisha that followed shortly. My aisle consisted of condiments and jars of pickles/olives on one side, and plastic bags and Kleenexes on the other. When stocking, we unload carts that have assorted cases of both, which I had set on the floor near the shelves on which they would eventually be put. Minutes after T’s terrifying encounter, I unloaded a new cart on the floor. Cases of product were now stacked neatly against the side of the aisles, leaving plenty of room for late night shoppers to walk down the aisle. At least for MOST late night shoppers…


I will write part 2 tomorrow if any interest because its bed time. I would appreciate comments on my writing, what I’m doing wrong/right (is my wordiness a problem?) This is my first post ever so ~~be nice~~ be honest! As I’m writing this, I realize that I have enough FPSs to write a novel all from working at this one store. And I will, if the public demands it! 


PS I realize it isn’t thighroid, just a punny Freudian slip that I didn’t correct.

TL;DR The dark chocolate braised hambeast Lardquisha and her moons crash into my store looking for liquid beetus due to sugar-lackin' thyroid. Berate the nicest girl I've ever known for not having ""curves"" and for the fact that the pop aisle isn't near the front--even though it is.

1375726580.0	1jr68g	TEEHEE, I'm fat cause of GENETICS!	shadowcat0204	414	84	117	"This is a long one, my apologies in advance.

This just happened a couple of weeks ago. I have a coworker (let’s call her Moose) who is extraordinarily fat. Definitely fits the definition of morbidly obese. 5’3 350+ pounds. (Just for reference, I am 5’6 145 lbs.) I live in Iowa, and the college I go to doesn’t have a ton of morbidly obese people. So, when I first met her, really my schema for obese people had been shaped by FPS, and I was expecting the worst. I was wrong. She turned out to be a lovely, pleasant person. She didn’t steal others’ food (though ate a SHITTON of her own every day) and didn’t express any fatlogic that I could tell. 

I am a biology major and work in my department’s main office as an assistant. Basically, this means during the summer, my job is to sit around and do nothing. So, I spend a great deal of time on reddit, particularly FPS, though I always made sure Moose never saw because I didn’t want to offend her. As you can probably guess, one day she caught me. 

As I assumed, she was mightily offended. I went on to explain that it wasn’t making fun of fat people, just CRAZY people who also happen to be fat. She eventually became OK with it, and even started reading these stories with me. However, one day, she came to work and asked, “shadowcat, have you ever heard of This is Thin Privilege?” 

I replied, “Yes, I have, and I agree with a lot of what they say (fat people shouldn’t have a broken bone ignored because they’re fat or be subject to harassment on a daily basis, etc.) but some of the things they say really bother me. Like the idea that obesity is genetic.”

Now, keep in mind we are both biology majors who have taken genetics, so I wholeheartedly expected Moose to agree with me. NOPE. First instance of fatlogic: “Oh no, shadowcat, I’ve been reading TiTP and they have solid evidence that genetics is 77% of obesity.”

My jaw dropped. “OK, then how do you explain the fact that in only 16 years the average weight of Americans has increased by 15 pounds?”

Moose: “Oh, that’s easy, that’s genetic too!”

Now, for those of you who don’t know much about genetics, this is complete phooey. I go on to explain to her exactly why: (note: I argued based on the principles of evolution and natural selection, so if you don’t believe in evolution my argument will seem like crap)

“Let’s say it is genetic. This would mean that the genetic makeup of the population (with regards to obesity) has changed drastically in the last 20 years. There’s only a few ways that could happen.

1)	Non-random mating. Basically fat people pair up and have WAY more babies than thin people, causing the average to go up. DIDN’T HAPPEN.

2)	A ton of thin people are fleeing the country and a ton of fat people have come in to the country. NOPEROO!

3)	The population went from a ton of people to a very small number of people due to war, natural disaster, etc. and only fat people are left. NOPE.

4)	Natural selection occurred. This basically means that fat people are more likely to reproduce than thin people, because the “fat” gene is favored. LOL NOPE.

5)	Mutations occurred in the gene pool. This can’t have happened! Say a mutation in the (supposed) “fat” gene occurred that caused people to gain weight. In order for it to take hold in the population, the people with this mutation would have to have more kids than thin people. WRONG AGAIN.

Also, for (4) and (5), evolution by natural selection works on a scale of thousands to millions of years. Couldn’t have happened in 100 years, much less 16.”

Moose said, and I unfortunately am not kidding here, “TEEHEE well I think you’re wrong. I’ve tried dieting and exercising to lose weight, and so it MUST be genetics! Big bones just run in my family!”

I couldn’t think of anything to say. I didn’t want to offend her by informing her that the 2000 calories she eats for lunch alone every day weren’t helping, nor were the vast amounts of chips she eats for snacks.

Finally, I say, “Well, I disagree with you. But if you wanted to try dieting and exercising, I could help you with creating healthy meals and I’d be happy to exercise with you!”

Moose: “No shadowcat, haven’t you heard, exercising is BAD FOR YOU!” And with that, she stomped back to her desk and didn’t speak to me for the rest of the day.

Please help me! I want her to be a great F2F story, but I have no idea how to motivate her to lose weight. Also, if anybody who knows more about genetics than me wants to correct my argument, please do so.

EDIT: I realized I should add that since the time of this incident, she has gained more fat logic and dismissed FPS as fat-shaming and discriminating, so I (hopefully) don't have to worry about her reading this.

EDIT 2: I got so much helpful information from you guys in the comments, I decided to formulate another argument and make a 2nd try. Hopefully it will work! Thanks for all your help!

On road with bus hambeast prime tells me what it is to be a real 


Asian, and how she is now on an anime diet. She shits herself near 

end of bus ride causing many to lose their lunch.


Cast of Characters


Me: half white half Asian girl. Apparently I’m not truly Japanese 
because I don’t eat Japanese junk food and choose to make my own instead, also lesbian.


Friend A: Sara cool girl and works on anime club committee. While not on the actual officer list she might as well should be.


Friend B: May only other Asian and president of animu club. Has lost faith in club because majority of members do nothing. 


Boyfriend of Friend B: Otto cool Asian guy with the most unasian name I’ve ever heard.


Hambeast Prime: Hp large girl with many a problems. Shits herself in public on bus ride, complains about seats and toilets being too small. Practically forces way on to ride.


Let the story being.


&gt;Arriving at hotel and unpack goods. I managed to score a room with my two friends (Hell yes). While the school doesn’t allow drinking I plan on getting wasted.


&gt;Turns out Hp did NOT pay the mandatory $100 fee and instead expected us to pay for her. All our rage and we can’t send her back to school because of how much it would cost. So we have to bear with it for now. 


&gt;Club advisor goes from Beta to Alpha in a second and says she is staying in our room with us.
Goddammit.wmv


&gt;She squees that she can stay with the only other Asian and in the same bed.


&gt;May gives her a warning that she is either sleeping alone or with boyfriend (haha)


&gt;HP gets angry at this and calls her a lesbo and storms off to room without the key. 


&gt;We get key and see her waiting infront of the room with all her luggage.


&gt;howdidshegetthose.fla


&gt;Enter room and claim and plop on bed. Feel cases slam on me and lose breath.


&gt;”whoops sorry. Didn’t see you there! I guess you are too thin! Teehee”


Wannagohulk.now


&gt;Say just watch it next time and that I claimed the bed. HP gets angry and takes her stuff off.


&gt;See May already claimed the other bed. Sara agrees to sleep with me because we don’t want to hear HP bitch and moan.


&gt;HP grunts and walks off to the bathroom. 


&gt;I unload my bag and my friends do the same. I plan on cosplay as “Mew” from Jet Set Radio [Girl in Blue is Mew]( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbmhqfuWPr1qmd4syo1_500.jpg) Friends plan on cosplaying as the girls on left and right. (Sara is black) and May’s boyfriend is going to be crossing dressing as the kinda goth looking girl


&gt;We prepare everything. Lay out costumes for tomorrow. Its currently 9pmish and we are hungry. I pull out phone and look for a café or something.


&gt;Hp pops out of bathroom. Wearing.. some.. kind of obviously dead animal. I think. It was extremely tight on her body, and while it was revealing it hide anything considered “Obscene” by the con rules. Still almost made us vomit.


&gt;We keep looking and eventually just order a pizza. May notices something outside of window. Restaurants behind con center? Nope. Just a red light district. 


&gt;Pizza comes and Hp BEGS to eat some. As she is incredibly hungry. I ask her what happened to her huge bucket of ramen. She tells me she ate it all.


&gt;I tell her that eating a huge bucket of ramen isn’t healthy, and those little nissian ramen packs are TWO servings, and ask her how much did she put in.


&gt;She made that bucket with 30 packs of ramen. 15. Fucking. Packs. 15 servings.


&gt;Remember when I was a hambeast used to eat it nonstop. 1 package of Ramen is around 480 calories (550 with flavor pack) and she had 15 servings. 15 x 550 = 8250 calories, and she was STILL hungry?


&gt;I honestly am shocked at this point. I have a single slice of pizza and just give her the rest. My friends are a bit peeved… but then there is a knock on the door.


&gt;May runs to door and opens it. It’s her boyfriend. They hug, kiss, and make small talk. 


&gt;With food in mouth Hp prime squeels like a piggy and says “A REAL LIVE JAPANESE MAN” wut.


&gt;She rushes over and tries talking in Japanese. He is a bit offended but just kinda shrugs it off. (She spoke jibberish)


&gt;Sara introduces him to Hp. May is too busy trying to think of ways to keep Hp away from him. He shows me his costume and make-up for the character he plans on cosplaying and I give him a thumbs up.


&gt;Hp doesn’t know what we are talking about. We just laugh it off, and tell her not to worry about it.


&gt;Pretty awake after bus ride because of sleeping and decide to walk around hotel. (Nice hotel. Hilton hotel that is connected to concenter.) Looking around and notice gym.


&gt;I fist pump because now I can go running after eating. 


&gt;Hp pats me on the back REALLY hard. I almost fall over. I ask her what does she want and why did she follow me.


&gt;She tells me to stay away from Otto and that he’s hers. I am a bit stunned by this because Sara introduced him as May’s boyfriend. Hp says that doesn’t matter because all Japanese men love “MUH CURVES”


&gt;She waddles away and I’m just stunned. Afraid of grease being on the back of my shirt.


&gt;I return to room and everyone seems fine. Otto is passed out on bed. May is reading, Sara is typing on her laptop. I decide to work too and take out my sketchbook.


&gt;Hp comes in and asks us what the hell are we doing? We are at a con we should be getting wasted. While a good idea I wouldn’t do it with HER around.


&gt;Hp keeps insisting on it and we are a bit hesitant. Hp wants to go to red light district, but we tell her no because that is a bad idea no matter how you spin it. Not to mention Baltimore can get a bit dangerous at night.


&gt;Hp whines and whines some more talking about how she wants to dance and stuff. This does not shift our opinion on the matter.


&gt;Hp stomps off and back to the couch. Otto just laughs because he heard everything. Hp just says “Otto would love to see me dance” Otto tells her immediately hell no, and wraps his arm around May saying “Keep me safe” This guy is cool with me so far.


&gt;As I keep drawing on my pad Hp just goes around asking everyone questions and while not annoying is getting a bit bothersome. She keeps asking Otto and May about Japanese culture and stuff. Otto has been in America his whole life, and May only went to Japan once during a semester abroad. Hp is pretty much ignoring May and paying 100% attention to Otto. 


&gt;I finish my drawing and slip my sketchbook back in my bag. I lay on the bed and look over at Sara who fell asleep at the keyboard. I decide to take out my kindle and read. (I will finish Lord of the Rings one day. I promise) 


&gt;Hp begins pestering me about how we should “mess” with Sara. Sara is NOT a morning person, or an afternoon person. If you wake her up from a nap she is grouchy. I’d avoid it. Hp thinks otherwise. Hp keeps trying to bother her and I stop her every. Damn. Time.


&gt;Hp just huffs and goes on her laptop. Without headphones we can hear her watching yaoi. (For those that don’t know Yaoi is romance anime between two men. Yuri is for romance anime between two women) Ask her to put on headphones or mute because she is playing it REALLY loud and its really late.


&gt;Hp just gets salty with me and says “I should appreciate” her doing this. So I try to change topic and ask Hp if she is going to cosplay. She says she will cosplay (Predictably) as Miku. Now hear me out here. I like anime, but I have no idea who Miku is or why I should care.


&gt;She shows me the costume and its small.. like REALLY small. As in I would barely be able to fit into it, and if I did it would pretty much suffocate me. Hp just brushes me off saying “It was made for her specifically” 


&gt;Its 1am by this point and I want to sleep. I see Sara woke up for a second and put her laptop away, May and Otto are cuddling, and I should really get some sleep. Hp finally put on headphones and all  is right with the world.


&gt;I say I’m going to sleep and I turn off the lights.


&gt;”Uh. Please don’t do that. Its rude!” Hp pretty much shouts at me.


&gt;Turns out Hp is afraid of the dark and says I tease her with my thin privilege. Wat. (I honestly reached over to turn off the lights)


&gt;I ask her how old she is and how can she be afraid of the dark. She tells me she is 36. ಠ_ಠ


&gt;This girl is 36 years old.. doesn’t have a job.. in community college.. wat, and is afraid of the dark.


&gt;I sigh and dim the light instead of turning it off. I fall asleep pretty easily but it still kinda bugs me.


&gt; I wake up ready for the next day and equip my clothing as I get ready to go out as Mew. Examining it I see no problems with it, and I look great. It’s a bit of a heavy sweater she wears so I’m going to be sweating like crazy. 


&gt;I open my phone and see I have a new text message. A lot of them actually. 54 to be exact all from the same number. Turns  out HP got my Cell number and was just sending me text messages saying “You are so underweight” or “You should gain weight you look terrible” and my favorite “Stop using your thin privilege all the time. You need to be sensitive to other people!”


&gt;I just ignore them and get ready as my friends all wake up from their sleep. HP doesn’t stir for a while so we leave without her and leave her a note. The TRUE con adventure begins.


Will HP behave herself AT the con, or will she continue to make an ass of herself. Maybe she might even find someone else to harass. Find out next time on Fatty Prime and the Anime Con!


Note: Really sorry, but this part is.. REALLY BORING. Not much happens except for minor fatlogic and thin privileging. Also I’m pretty sure one of the seven deadly sins have been committed.

Spouse-a-tron an I are visiting my family who are living in South America due to my dad's job. The locals are pretty anti-american, in this weird love hate relationship, of they all want visas, and to live there, but they don't want Americans. The local population are statistically, at least a good head shorter than I. And there's this cultural thing that women are there to look pretty and have babies. Surgery is a BIG thing here, girls getting nose jobs in their teens, getting face lifts and laser treatments.

&gt;Gotta be sexy to get a man

Where I look tall thin an Irish, the locals are short, surgically thin, and have booty. You know that infograph of aging Asian women? And they're hot and thin until 45, then suddenly Obasanzilla comes out? Yeah. They're like that. Lithe short people until about 40, and then suddenly Consuela the maid from Family Guy shows up.

Spouse-a-tron technically arrives tomorrow. Today I went out to a cafe to get lunch.

&gt;be me, 135lb, 5'8.

&gt;be hungry

&gt;be on holiday

&gt;decide it's not the end of the world if I have a can of coke and a small greasy cheese thing, instead of STRICTLY following my diet.

&gt;It's a holiday, not fatlogic. I had a sensible vegetable soup for dinner later and went cycling for a good 6 miles. 

&gt;Be drinking the beetus juice and eating the grease like it's crack cocaine.

&gt;hear two teenage girls in Spanish behind me as I'm heading back to home base.

**""Jeez, look at that fat gringo""**

**""And they wonder why they're all obese?""**

**""Look at the size of her! Kill me if I ever get that fat.""**

&gt;Be trying to ignore the shadows of highschool ED and weight anxiety.

&gt;Be looking at myself.

&gt;Be thinking ""135 is not fat at all. Not yet at goal weight, but nowhere near hambeast.""

&gt;Be **very** jimmyrustled.

I looked around to see spy these girls, who were sitting at a local burger joint (El Coral burgers are fucking amazing gais) shoveling curly fries and gulping down sodas. These girls are about 4 feet tall, and maybe weigh 90lbs between them. Yes, compared to them, I am a hulking behemoth. I listen in as I speak fluent Spanish, and these *paisas* probably assume because I'm not latino I won't understand.

**""Wow, I don't understand what guys see in women like that. What a fattie!""**

**""You're assuming she could even get a man. With a gut like that, I don't know who would go for her.""**

**""She's like Jurassic Park, the ground shakes when she walks. Just like a Gringo.""**

&gt;No, not Beta today.

&gt;I went to highschool here.

&gt;I am foreign, not gringo.

&gt;HUGE difference.

&gt;Gringo implies unedeucated Americans who don't speak the language, lack cultural sensitivity and are obese McDonalds guzzling hambuckets.

""Hey, if I'm the obese *gringo* then how come you're the ones guzzling down greasy burgers like a vacuum?""

Girls are stunned into silence.

&gt;When did *gringos* start learning Spanish?

&gt;This *gringo* speaks fluently!

&gt;doesnotcompute.com

The quicker of the two, regains the ability to speak first.

**""Psh, you wish you had our curves. I have a *condishun*. I have to eat a lot. Besides, I bet you're a poor gringo. My dad will just buy surgery to get any fat removed.""**

Her friend pipes in.

**""Uh, yeah we're on special diets. These calories don't count because of our condishunz. Everyone knows meat doesn't have calories. What are you, stupid?""**

**""Must be, she looks gringo.""**

**""Stupid gringo, doesn't know how diabetes works. Or conditions.""**

At this point, I walk away. No point in arguing with idiots.

1370986830.0	1g5gth	My Encounter With A Fat Vegan	WorldWarZi	406	69	184	"So I love cooking, especially for other people. I don't get to do it very often so I make sure that I have several preparation options for each dish, such as lean, vegetarian, and vegan. I also love to teach people that have decided to go vegan/vegetarian how to get the most out of their diet. This incident occurred when I was asked to bring vegan friendly treats to a birthday party.

&gt;Be me, WorldWarZi. (5'4"", 115 lbs.)

&gt;Arriving at a friend's with a tray of muffins and one of cupcakes.

&gt;The muffins are for the friend and I to share, she requested them.

&gt;The cupcakes are for the one or two vegans that will be attending the party later.

&gt;We have a few of the muffins as we set up.

&gt;The muffins are not vegan-friendly. They're flavored with pudding, which contains gelatin.

&gt;Leave the rest on the counter top for breakfast tomorrow.

Fast forward to when all the party guests have arrived. The two vegans present are thanking me for the cupcakes.

&gt;A third girl approaches.

&gt;About 5'6"", 260 lbs. [Like this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-12228-body-shape.htm?StartAt=14#.UbeYd0r-18c)

&gt;Ask her if she needs a drink, I'm on serving duty.

&gt;She does, but hasn't been of age very long and isn't sure what she would like.

&gt;Have her follow me to the kitchen so I can get her something she'll enjoy.

&gt;She's thanking me for providing vegan options, and that most people don't know how to make good cupcakes.

&gt;Look up as I'm fixing her drink.

&gt;[""You're a vegan?""](http://i.imgur.com/7Rbp1.gif)

&gt;She laughs and says ""Yeah, I mostly live on Kashi bars. Cooking vegan is complicated.^TeeHee""

Kashi Bars are like a vegan version of those Nature Valley snack bars from what I understand. Mostly nuts, fruit and dark chocolate.

I try to explain to her that it doesn't have to be, as it only really gets complicated when you're working with tofu. And that living off Kashi bars is a terrible idea. I even offer to share my recipes or take her shopping. She's not having it. Says three boxes of Kashi bars is all she needs. As we were talking, I didn't notice that she had been eating the non-vegan muffins that were on the counter. Mainly because I got stuck on the fact that she was eating three boxes of Kashi bars EVERY DAY.

&gt;Still stuck on the mass consumption of snack bars.

&gt;Now offering to teach her how to cook vegan.

&gt;She's still not biting.

&gt;Momentarily give up, since other people need drinks.

&gt;Notice several of the leftover muffins are missing.

&gt;Ask her if she had some.

&gt;""Yeah, I wish I had your talent, most vegan food is so bland.""

&gt;[Shit.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/awkward-Buscemi.gif) 

I'm unsure of what to do now, I've seen vegans flip a bitch after finding out they ate something that had animal stuff in it. I guess she thought they were also vegan since they were on the same kind of serving plate as the cupcakes, but we made sure to label the vegan stuff very clearly. Decide I'm better off if she doesn't know.

&gt;Try to give her my number, in case she changes her mind about needing help with her diet.

&gt;I will always regret using the word ""diet"".

&gt;A small crowd forms as she flies off the handle.

&gt;""WHY ARE YOU BEING SO PUSHY ABOUT THIS?! HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN A FAT VEGAN BEFORE? WE DO EXIST YOU KNOW!""

&gt;Try to calmly explain that I only wanted to help. 

&gt;""YOU WERE TRYING TO SHAME ME! WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO LOOK DOWN ON ME WHEN YOU AREN'T EVEN VEGAN? I LOVE MY BODY AND I WILL NOT TOLERATE YOU BEING A CONDESCENDING BITCH!!""

&gt;Still calm, tell her that eating the same thing everyday isn't good for anyone.

&gt;She calls me a ""skinny, murderous c**t"" and walks out the door with the rest of the muffins.

&gt;...[joke's on her?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/fart-in-elevator.gif)

Reading FPS brought back this horrible repressed memory from an otherwise fantastic time in my life. I have other stories about this prime cut of Irish ham too, so let's start at the beginning...

&gt;Be 19, 6""0, 82kg (180lb for the 'Murricans here) and healthy.

&gt;Starting college and moving into on-campus accommodation, sharing with 6 strangers.

&gt;Sitting around in the shared kitchen drinking tea and getting to know 4 of the girls and one of the guys I'll be living with.

&gt;I hear an almighty thunderous clap, then another, then another. It's as if Odin is splitting the sky above us.

&gt;The lights flicker, the TV reception fades and the floor creaks and groans as the source of the tremors enters the room.

&gt;thatsnomoon.jpg

&gt;It's my housemate Jenny, who shall henceforth be known as Hamon-Ra, blocker of the sun and destroyer of worlds.

Brief interlude: Bear in mind that this is Ireland, and while ugly potato-people inhabit these green lands in vast numbers, a genuine hamplanet is a rare beast. Hamon-Ra is a genuine celestial body, 5""5 and around 300lbs.

&gt;I hide my disgust at the putrid stench and rolls of fat clearly attempting to free themselves from her ill-fitting clothes.

&gt;Her face folds in on itself, red and irritated in the places that the sweaty folds of flab meet,

&gt;I make small talk for a little while and go to my room to unpack. Hamon-Ra is calling Chinese take out for herself and the 4 girls but I've somehow lost my appetite.

&gt;Flash forward 3-4 hours.

&gt;I return to the kitchen and am greeted with a scene of utter devastation. 

&gt;The other girls have left, busying themselves with unpacking or getting to know people around the accommodation.

&gt;Hamon-Ra however is lying on the couch, slumbering after defeating what looks like a garbage bag of Chinese food.

&gt;The walls are stained with grease, the table is stacked full of dirty dishes and Hamon-Ra is sweating profusely through her hoody.

&gt;Across the other side of the world, half a billion Chinese peasants raise their tools and cry ""Victory!"", they have achieved the impossible and satisfied Hamon-Ra's hunger.

&gt;I open my mouth to ask the beast if it's feeling ok, its breath is laboured and its sweaty jowls are an alarming shade of purple.

&gt;""Of course I'm okay GrahamD89, why wouldn't I be?""

&gt;""Because you ate a LOT of food, that can't be healthy""

&gt;Big mistake.

&gt;She lets loose a torrent of abuse ""JUST BECAUSE THE SKINNY BITCHES HERE DON'T KNOW HOW TO FINISH A MEAL, UNGRATEFUL c***S. I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. THIS GIRL NEEDS TO EAT""

&gt;I back away as she tears open a packet of disgusting chicken flavoured crisps.

&gt;She clearly can't allow precious calories to escape.

&gt;I leave the room, and when I return to get a beer from the fridge she's lying in the same position, with at least 6 empty bags of crisps around her, and an avalanche of crumbs rolling down her chins.

&gt;The beast leers at me with it's piggy little eyes, daring me to say something.

&gt;I leave in disgust, my eyes stained with the horrors I have seen.

From this point on it got worse. Our kitchen would only get messier, the smell permeating the upper level of our flat would intensify and Hamon-Ra would only increase in circumference. Her arrogance grew too, as she established herself as the mothership of our female housemates, bossing them around and turning 2 of them into full-fledged moons. If I recall correctly, her flowing folds may have entirely swallowed up our smallest housemate. 

&gt;This story is dedicated to R., who I hope is still alive somewhere within Hamon-Ra's inner crust. "	t5_2vzax	True
1374765619.0	1j159x	Pharmacy Hamplanet	BMI_Valentine	383	49	63	"I am currently a pharmacy intern, and I have seen many Hamplanets in my time. One of the worst offenders happened earlier this month. While it is not as bad as most of these other stories, I thought it deserved to be told.
I was working during fourth of July weekend, taking prescription orders etc, when I received a call from a customer looking for his refills. I asked home what he wanted to refill, and he instantly became belligerent. ""I want the all refilled! What are you, stupid or something?!"" For those of you who don't know, unless you only have a few prescriptions to refill, it is a difficult task to go through someone's profile and find out what can be refilled. I beta'd and told him okay. He then asked how long it would take, and when I told him about 15 minutes, he flipped again. After I got off the phone with him I started going through his profile, filling anything that could be filled. Of course his refills for his beetus medications were several weeks late (meaning he probably isn't taking them).

Well, about ten minutes into this process, I feel the ground quaking. My bottled water was doing its best Jurassic Park impression. In walked an entire solar system of Hamplanets. Dad, mom, son, and daughter. all of them well over 300lbs. Sure enough, it was the gentleham I had spoken to earlier. He comes up looking for his prescriptions, and bitches the technician out when they aren't ready. ""What do you mean they aren't ready!!"" I called over an hour ago!"" Silly ham, I just got off the phone with you. I wonder if time moves faster for planets.

I interject and tell him that it will be ready shortly. They decide to ravage the poor grocery store while they are waiting. The produce section was the only survivor of this massacre. Since it was near the Fourth of July, the store had a snack table out. As soon as these gelatinous globs of gristle and grease discovered the table, they waddled over with wide, lustful eyes. Those greedy planets ate damn near the whole table. Daddy ham himself ate an entire package of cupcakes. Garfield the cat has more social graces and tact when eating lasagna than these bumbling hippos.

The solar system starts oozing back to the pharmacy and begins shouting all of their names to the tech. They were shouting over each other so they were completely incoherent. The tech was getting flustered, and rightfully so. The mom then shouts that the tech needs to hurry because her blood sugar is getting low and she needs to take her medicine. Silly ham, I looked at your meds and they all lower your blood sugar.

After true tech had all their drugs, she rang them up. They were all on the state Medicaid program which pays for their medications except for a $3.00 (US) copay. This copay can be charged by the customer because the Medicaid legislation has something called a ""hardship waver"" in it. This was written for really destitute people who genuinely can't affor the $3, but it gets abused all the time. Well the hamdad tells the tech to charge it. I'm sure these planets had a huge hardship because their carts were full of at least  $500 in food, including 10 twelve packs of soda. There were more calories in their cart than f words in a Joe Pesci movie. The Hams then waddled out of the store to take care of their beetus and other condishuns.

I have plenty of other stories, including some involving these same planets. I will post them later if I have time.

&gt;Umm, it's 2pm and you just got here. Seriously?

&gt;She gets cane, waddles away like a fatted goose, returns an hour later with Chipolte

&gt;spreads food out everywhere, into my space, ""Sorry...tee hee, but I gotta keep my energy up for the work day""

&gt;pulls out bottled water from tote bag, pulls out Kool Aid packet, pulls out sugar canister, makes kool aid in water container, spilling powder and sugar everywhere

&gt;this is a true story

&gt;massacres chips and queso, then moves onto giant burrito

&gt;unwraps massive burrito, reaches into tote bag of doom, pulls out . . . a bottle of ranch

&gt;this is still a true story

&gt;MFW she begins spraying the burrito with ranch. Ranch dressing. On a burrito. The humanity.

&gt;notices my look of horror

&gt;OH, tee hee, it's a veggie burrito! Gotta have ranch on my veggies!

&gt;Eats it in under three minutes. I clocked it. So a catered lunch sandwich, sugary kool aid made at the desk, chips and queso, and ranch-saturated burrito in a four hour ""workday"".

1374336191.0	1ip6th	How a landwhale almost cost me my job and sight.	MP3Hoarder	413	79	39	"Sorry, don't know how to green text.

Gather round, and I shall tell you the tale of the landwhale who almost cost me my job, my sight, and my lunch.

Lets travel back to the year 2004.

Be me, 6' 220lbs male 3rd year in school and second year living in the dorms.

Don't be loudnsmelly ( henceforth known as LS) 5'3 300lbs walking megaphone with bad BO and halitosis.

Roommates (henceforth known as roomies)

LS was one of my lab partners in gen. biology, and the lab teacher was nicknamed Adolf for her crazy rules about how she wanted the lab reports written up her crazy asinine rules for the lab reports made them impossible. Wouldn't have surprised me if she wanted us to write down how many times we inhaled and exhaled in lab). Nobody got higher than a c on any lab reports all year out of a class of thirty. 

Now onto the story, LS always got to lab before me so I was spared the earthquakes and solar eclipses and stuff. LS was pretty much disliked by all the students in class for her loud voice and obnoxious ways. Her voice had one volume setting LOUD! She would yell so no one within 100 yards would miss out on what, in her mind were the most important things.... her sex life (gag), favorite foods, and new tight clothes she was wearing. 
Myself and the other lab partners were conducting a fruit fly experiment were we counted out how many had red or sepia colored eyes and Adolf was exact counts and notes (she would know!! if we were faking our results, and all the other usual threats she's issue before the lab)
LS came waddling over from the far corner of the room to ""grace us with her presence"" and tell us in nauseating detail about some new guys who ""loved her cuuurvvhes."" 
Gagging, death close.... Feeling cold

Here's the thing about LS, she loved skinny bean pole guys. The kind that look more like skeletons than anything. When I saw her from across the cafeteria once with her rail thin capture, I thought that she was walking around with a dead guy, as miserable and tired as this guy looked. 

LS liked me, a thought that still brings me shivers and makes me gag. She would sit really close to me and lean her girth on me or press her oily cheek to mine when I was distracted and looking in the microscope. The first time she did it I freaked out and ran to the restroom and scrubbed my face as hard as I could. I kept an eye on her after that and would, not subtly jerk my face away and move further away, but she never got the hint.

Back to the story, I was going to miss the remaining 45 minutes of the lab, because I had a doctors appointment, and though Adolf seemed appeased with my excuse to leave, she still told me she would not accept any lab results from me that were not complete due to my absence. (I should clarify that though my group of four did the lab together, we still we required to turn in our own reports and data interpretations and graphs)
I asked the group if they would email me the remaining data that I missed, so I could finish up the lab. LS was very excited by this and promised me that she would take ""perfect notes"" and send them to me, the others said they would as well. 

Now it's later that day, I'm chilling in my dorm room and I get a call, it's LS,  (to this day I don't know how she got my dorm room phone number) 
""Hey MP3Hoarder, it's LS! I triiiiiied to send you the email but its not going throoouuggh. Is your box full?"" I checked my email and deleted some junk mail and told her to try again, trying to be quick to get her off the phone, I was in fear that shed try to see if she could come over, go out to eat, etc. "" ok, try to send of now."" A few minutes pass, and I see several emails from her pop up. ""I see them, thanks. Well I guess I'll see you later."" 
""Wait MP3Hoarder!! Wellll? What do you think? Hmmm?""

""Ok, I see that you sent me several emails (I hadn't open them yet, they were all labelled ""what you missed 1, 2, etc) thanks for the emails, I got to go.""

A few days pass and it's Monday night, the lab reports due in the morning, because I'm a college student and I'm  perfecting my procrastination powers like the awesome guy I am. I'm working at the circulation desk in the library, and it's a slow night . Our awesome boss lets us ""hard working starving college students"" work on homework if its a slow day. I decide to start on my lab report, I'm expecting no higher than a c anyway, as are all the students in the lab. I open up my email and try to open ""here's what you missed 1"" but it won't open for some reason, and a popup asking for the  administrators password prompts me. I asked awesomeboss (AB) if she could help me. She's sitting right next to me. (She's a 5'5 50 something bible thumping year old woman whose as sweet as can be until you were a dinner or sinned in her presence.)

She gets on my computer as I stand behind her as she puts in her password. The email opens and I froze.... The email had pictures of LS front, back and side.... Naked. I was gasping like a fish out of water, waving my hands in front of my face fearing I'd gone blind, I felt my balls scream and retreat into my body. The library has a strict no pornography on the computers, one guy got canned cause he had a thing for grabbing himself looking at porn at the circulation desk. 

AB goes dead quiet, I'm stammering.
""AB, I h h h have n n no idea t t th this was on here, I don't know what's going on.""

The whole time the emails open, and finally after an eternity AB closes it, and I begin to stammer. (I really needed this job to help pay for school)

AB, this was supposed to be my lab work I missed, mmmy lab patner sent it to me, I I don't know what's going on.

Quietly AB tells me, ""you know our rules about this horrible material, this is against the rules and you know it.""

"" I I I don't know what's happening, but I swear that I don't k ow about about this!"" 

An opens the other emails listed ""here's what you missed"" and thankfully instead of more pictures of LS resembling a manatee, it was the lab notes that I was waiting for. 

To make this short, it's already too long. AB eventually realized I had no part in this, and just told me to be careful with my emails, and that she was gonna pray long and hard to try and forget the naked pictures she saw. (If I could've I wouldn't bleached my brain and scrubbed those memories away.) 

The next day I went to lab and LS cornered me with her bulk. ""I know you saw those pictures, you like??""

""They gave me nightmares, i threw up after seeing them, they almost cost my job, and probably would've turned me gay if I looked at them longer.""

I quietly vented my feelings ""I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND YOU, IT DIGUSTS ME TO EVEN LOOK AT YOU! i NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU OR TALK TO YOU AGAIN!!"" 

LS ended up changing to another lab period thankfully, I rarely saw her around campus except from a distance in the cafeteria. 

The weirdest thing, and it's haunted my dreams. I've never seen a landwhale or any chubby or fat girl really that didn't have tits except LS. These weren't even a small a cup or anything it was as if her nipples were swollen a few inches out from her chest. Scarred me for sure. 

That's my tale. "	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Don't be coolmate, tiny, has Spanish intolerance for bullshit

&gt;Don't be Nicderp, 5'5"" probably 140 of fat (not obese tho)

&gt;Coolmate: LadyTron! We have reorganize the room b/c we are getting a new roomie.

&gt;My bed gets stacked under new roomie's bed

&gt;I've never met new roomie

&gt;I hear she's nice though

&gt;Enter Nicderp... And a rolling ball of cheese.

&gt;Wait, that's not cheese...

&gt;That's just an easy cheese smeared rhino!

&gt;Wait a second... Are those luggage bags?

HI I'M BBC!! (BBC = Bipedal Ball of Cheese)

&gt;Why does BBC have luggage bags?

 I'M YOUR NEW ROOMIE

&gt;Nicderp: This is our new roomie!

&gt;MFW BBC is gonna be sleeping above me

&gt;BBC is 5'4"" and 300 lbs of round cheeks, chips, and One Direction

&gt;She wears these nasty little cotton boot slippers

&gt;They used to be pink, but they're now a near brown color

&gt;She takes them off

&gt;No socks

&gt;Feet are streaked with brown dirt

&gt;AND THE SMELL OH GOD THE SMELL

&gt;Their crushed soles from her weight resemble my soul after just a week of sharing space with this monstrosity

&gt;She puts the ""boots"" by the foot of our stacked beds...

&gt;...Right by my pillow...

&gt;I can hardly stand the smell wide awake....

&gt;What's the weight limit on these beds?

&gt; What is my fate once night falls?

It's not that I didn't like BBC. It's that the room is really made for 3 people, not 4. Until her living habits became... Invasive...

&gt;BBC hangs up 1D posters all over the top of our bunked beds.

&gt;She plays the music out loud on her laptop every waking minute of the day.

&gt;She's a huge (lol) fan of tumblr and HAES blogs

&gt;And one of those luggage bags, she had entirely devoted to junk food.

&gt;Cheetos. Doritos. Cheese curls. Fritos. Lays chips. Devil dogs. Fucking everything.

&gt;Crumbs all over my side of the room. Coolmate eventually questions out loud.

&gt;Coolmate: LadyTron, what's with all the crumbs?

&gt;I tell Coolmate to stay up until BBC comes in at night if she wanted to find out.

&gt;BBC comes in late one friday, and climbs into bed as quiet as a hippo in heat right above me

&gt;Bed squeals and shakes. Boards under the bed sag. I hear the springs stressing.

&gt;I hear a muffled crinkle, then, crunch crunch crunch crunch

&gt;Just BBC and her late night feeding

&gt;Something falls past the foot of my bed

&gt;She throws the packaging of her food in the corner of the room where the beds meet the wall

&gt;Text from Coolmate: oh my god. I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

&gt;A nice breeze of BBC's disgusting slipper boots waftes into my nostrils

&gt;Not as sorry as I am, Coolmate. Not as sorry as I am.

&gt;Rotten eggs and dog shit fill my mind

&gt;What have I done to deserve this?

&gt;Dreamless, exhausted sleep follows.

WEEK TWO
---------------------

&gt;BBC going on and on about 1 Direction

&gt;I politely engage in the conversation.

&gt;I just cannot relate on any level with this girl

&gt;Doesn't mean I can't be nice.

&gt;Somehow the topic turns to shoes.

I NEED NEW SHOES! THESE ONES ARE SO OLD AND STINKY ^(teehee)

&gt;Before I can stop myself: ""If you do get new ones, wear socks with them and they'll last longer.""

SOCKS? LAST LONGER?

&gt;Me: Yeah. Your shoes are absorbing the sweat on your feet. And your feet touch the dirty ground. Socks will absorb the dirty sweat instead and help your shoes stop smel--

I CAN'T WEAR SOX ME AFRAID OF COTTON

&gt;What

I HAVE A PATHOLOGICAL FEAR OF COTTON ONE TIME MY FRIEND CHASED ME AROUND THE HOUES WIT A BAG OF COTTUN BALL AND I WAS SCREEMIN IT WAS SO FUNEE HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW

&gt;Wait didn't I see this somewhere...

&gt;There was a TV program of this. I'm certain of it. I don't tell this to BBC though, just stalling in the conversation trying to remember where I saw it.

&gt;Me: So uh, a fear of cotton? Is that right...

She goes on and on about how much she hates it, and how funny it is, and how funny other people think it is. My bullshit alarms are going haywire. I can't do it. I can't keep my mouth shut.

You see, Coolmate and I always got along really well because we both had an extremely low tolerance for bullshit, and we both liked to be clean. Together, we were able to keep our standard of living high, even though we were living in a freshman dorm.

With BBC, the standard of living dropped significantly, but we all felt too bad for her to actually say something about her nasty crumbs, trash at the foot of the bed, or her disgusting shoes. This caused me a lot of stress. And in times of high stress, my patience goes down exponentially.

&gt;Finally it pops into my head where I saw that cotton [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbn6In9aSGo).

&gt;Me: Alright. You're not afraid of cotton.

WUH? YIS I AM, THAT'S WHY NO SOCK--

&gt;Me: No you're not. That T-shirt you're wearing is cotton. Those slipper-boots are most likely a poly-cotton blend. Those sheets you sleep on are most likely made of cotton.

A stunned silence. I can see the defeat in her eyes. If I wasn't so goddamn tired from those fucking shoes and late night CRAWNCH CRAWNCH I probably would have felt bad for her.

&gt;Me: Those shoes smell terrible. And I resent the fact that I'm the only one that has to deal with sleeping with them right by my face. They belong either in bed with you, or outside.

&gt;Me: And while we're on the subject of cleaning, these crumbs are not mine, and there's only one person who throws garbage at the foot of the bed. And it's not me.

The inevitable follows: IF I GO TOO LONG WITHOUT EATING THEN MUH BEE-

&gt;Me: You can eat without making a mess. Cleaning up after yourself isn't going to cause you to go into diabetic shock. I'm late for my classes, now, I have to go. I sure do hope this is clean by the time I get back.

I turn to leave, trilling with a adrenaline, to see that my other two roomies had arrived. They looked at me with quiet victory in their eyes. I went to class. They texted me that BBC left shortly after....

...And was never seen or heard of by me or the other two roomies again. I don't know where she went or what she did, but she was the last one out at the end of the year. She never did clean up after herself; we had to vacuum and pull all her trash out ourselves. But at least those boots never fucking came back."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt; Be me, newish employee, 5'11 ~250lb; fat yes, fatittude no.

&gt; Be stocking shelves on a lazy Thursday afternoon with collegejockbro, standing in the isle where the cookies are kept.

&gt; A nice middle-aged woman approaches me and asks where the toothpaste is. I get up, lead her to where it is, and make my way back to the isle we were in. 

&gt; As I approach, I see that collegejockbro is being compacted by not one, not two, not three, but four hambeasts standing, as one would expect, near the cookies. 

&gt; I could try to move through the mass of blubber ... [but ultimately decide to go around](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/054/tumblr_kxa5vtEhlo1qzo4t5o1_400.jpg)

&gt; As I approach I hear the familiar snorting, high-pitched squeals, and heavy breathing, but only as I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with collegejockbro do I realize the true monstrosities we are dealing with.

&gt; The head of the brood is a 5'2 ~260lbs. female; she has a rather unique smell, like a mix of cologne, wine, and old dog shit after it rains. 
&gt; To her right stands her breeding partner, 5'8 ~330lbs, his face fixed with a narrow eyed scowl; within his orbit are the two piglets, both girls, probably about 9 and 7. They are still young enough to be considered ""cute"" and aren't yet insanely obese.

&gt; I pick up what the female is saying to collegejockbro mid-sentence:

&gt; ""-why don' you people evar have the same shtuff? I's it really dat hard to keep ur shelves stocked?""

&gt; Collegejockbro, cool as ever:

&gt; ""The candy cane joe joe's are a seasonal item, we only have the around christmas"" noshit.jpg

&gt; ""Well then why don' u have'em then? Its only a few months after chismas""

&gt;FFS it is the middle of may

&gt; ""Yeah, well, we have to move items quickly off the shelves after Christmas so we don't have them.""

&gt; The male notices me and says: ""So da ya two Einsteins no when ya get thos' cookies back""

&gt;Me: ""I'm not sure exactly, check back after Thanksgiving; we will probably have them or be able to tell exactly you when we will.""

&gt; ""We drove all away here ta get mah wafe and kids sum cookies, 'not sure exactly' dunt' cut it kiddo""

&gt; collegejockbro's jimmies are on fire but he is cut off by the sow:

&gt; ""That is all we ca-""

&gt; ""I have had enouh of u two, i wanna speak to ur managur""

&gt; I give collegejockbro a look that says ""I will take one for the team"" and he takes off like a rocket.

&gt; Since the woman appears totally done with me, I think to go back to stocking shelves five feet away. But as I do so, the male starts on me:

&gt;""How dar ya to walk away frum mah wafe when shes talkin to ya!!! This is jus extremely rude.""

&gt; wat

&gt; I get up, walk back over, and apologize.

&gt; The male makes a sound like a truck turning over, placated for now it seems. 

&gt; The children have been surprisingly well-behaved, but they are getting understandably restless.

&gt; The younger one starts straying from the herd and picks up a box of cookies; she walks back and says to mom:

&gt; ""Howa bout' these momma, dey look good""

&gt; Without warning, the sow grabs the child roughly, and slaps her HARD across the face. This wasn't a 'child slap'; this was the way you would slap an adult. 

&gt; The child naturally lets out a yelp and starts crying:

&gt; ""Put'em back now emily""

&gt; Words cannot describe how much I wanted to kill this bitch. 

&gt; About 30 seconds later collegejockbro comes back with our assistant manager, a 40-something MBA down on her luck who needs this job:

&gt; ""Hello ma'am, how can I help you?""

&gt; ""We've driven all away here fur some canda cane joejoe's and you don't have'm, and des boys dun no notin, when you gettin in sum?""

&gt; ""Ma'am they are a seasonal item; we will have them around the holiday season, though due to the nature of our business I cannot tell you exactly when"" Clearly collegejockbro filled her in.

&gt; The husband turns over like a truck again and the sow gurgles with annoyance, but they finally seem to accept what we've told them multiple times.

&gt;I breathed a sigh of relief, hoping, praying, pleading, we were done, but alas, it was not so.

&gt; The sow waved one of her fat rolls in my general direction and said:

&gt; ""This one walked away frum me while i wasa talkin' to em', thats not how ta treat a customer. ""

&gt; A. I'm wearing a nametag.

&gt; B. Kill yourself.

&gt; 40-somethingMBA gave me a questioning looking and said:

&gt; ""That wasn't a good thing to do, did thesefatrollz apologize?""

&gt; ""No, he didn't, an my hasban' had to callem' out on it""

&gt; My jimmies, oh my poor jimmies.

&gt; ""Ma'am, I apologized to both you and your husband""

&gt; Her voice became a high screech: ""No you didn't are you calling meh a liar?!!!!""

&gt; Before I could say anything 40-somethingMBA was johnny on the fucking spot:

&gt; ""No, not at all, ma'am I'm sure there was some miscommunication, thesefatrollz apologize.""

&gt; ""I am sorry to you, your husband, and your family for walking away when you were talking to me""

&gt; The sow snorted in acknowledgement but continued giving me the evil eye.  

&gt; ""Now, is there anything else I can help you with ma'am?""

&gt; The sow waddles over to a nearby shelf and picks up the SAME FUCKING BOX of cookies her kid did and says:

&gt; ""I'dda hope u dun mind me taken des wit us complemetry all tings considered?""

&gt; ""Sure, i'll walk you to the register""

TL;DR: Family of hambeasts ask for a manager after being told we don't have an item, and the mother abuses her child, lies, and gets a free box of cookies.

1367864410.0	1dt1cj	Lardzilla needs her beetusjuice	None4GretchenWieners	438	104	133	"Good morning FPS, I'm back with a new story from my time in customer service in hopes of making your Monday morning a little less sucky :) This story comes from my short-lived time of working in a mom &amp; pop coffee shop. I was going to post this over the weekend, but this story involves a bit of mentioning of my grandmother who passed back in December. I have been having a bit of a hard time dealing with her being gone, so it took me a couple days to be able to finish typing this up. Still no greentext (I don't know what you were expecting).

Some minor details before we start: I had a coworker (22, 5'2”, 220 lbs) who we'll call A. A is the most obnoxious, whiny, entitled girl I have ever worked with out of every job and coworker I have ever had. I will post stories about her and her fatlogic later.

Be me, 18, working morning shift at a janky coffee shop, having to deal with A's whining already (it's only 6 am). Ignoring her and doing my normal job of grinding coffee, filling up condiment bars, and filling the pastry case. A of course is just sitting at the espresso machine texting, because she is obviously so damn special that she only has to make drinks for customers and do nothing else. Enter group of employees from a nearby business, one of them being of hamplanet status. This woman is about 5'11” and 350 lbs and is going on about how she's been on a diet lately and is going to treat herself because she's worked soooo hard at losing weight lately. As I am taking orders from the others in the group, Lardzilla keeps going on very loudly about which pastry she should get. Whatever, ignore her and get all the other orders filled. When it gets to be her turn to order, I see her piggy little eyes zero in on something behind the counter. Before I have time to look, she asks “What is *that*?” and points. I look, and realize it's my personal drink (which is under the counter but visible due to lack of cabinet doors).

Me: “That is our Caramel Freeze. It's like a Starbucks Frappuccino, but much less sweet. The flavor of the caramel compliments the flavor of the coffee quite well.”

Lardzilla: “I'll take the largest size y'all have of that drink, but gimme extra extra caramel! Put as much extra caramel as you can in there! I been working so hard on losing weight lately that I deserve it teehee! Also gimme an almond croissant and an orange cranberry muffin!”

MFW Lardzilla just ordered more calories than I eat in a day. In case you guys are wondering, our largest size is 24oz , and the most caramel we're allowed to put is about ¼ of the bottle.

A gets to work making Lardzilla's drink (and I am nearly gagging at how much caramel is going into it) and I bag up the croissant and the muffin. All of Lardzilla's coworkers are waiting on her (some have even left without her) and looking like they're about to be sick. I don't blame them, I can't even drink an 8oz size of the normal version of that drink (I made mine with only one pump of caramel syrup instead of three) and she just ordered 24oz of caramel death trap.

The next day, Lardzilla comes in and places the exact same order. I'm not one to judge, but I have to resist laughing to myself at the memory of her saying she was on a diet. The drink alone is the most caloric item on our menu, made even more caloric by the ¼ bottle of caramel going into it. Every day for the next 5 months Lardzilla comes in and orders the same items. At this point even A is disgusted, and that's saying a lot.

After said 5 months, I realize that Lardzilla has gained what looks to be about 40 pounds and I am back down to 160 lbs (down from 170, I had gained a bit of weight before getting that job). One particular day, Lardzilla comes in seemingly in a bad mood. She orders her normal order, but is all huffy about it. I pay her attitude no attention, I just smile and get to work on her order. A, however, takes the bait.

A; “Is something wrong? You don't seem happy like you usually do.”

L: “I've been working *so* hard on dieting, but I've gained 35 pounds! I don't know how *she*” (points at me) “stays so skinny, she must never eat anything!”

Me: “Excuse me? Ma'am, I don't appreciate what you're implying. I'm not even skinny, I'm just not overweight either.” Note: this is probably the 10th time that year that someone has said (outright or otherwise) that I am anorexic or bulimic. I have never in my life had an eating disorder, be it undereating or overeating. I had gained weight due to lack of exercise, but that's a different story.

L: “Well, you have obviously lost some weight, and I've been drinking the same drink as you every day, so I don't know why I've gained weight!”

Me: “I drink an 8oz drink and it only has one pump of caramel in it. Caramel syrup has a ton of sugar in it, and sugar is what makes you gain weight. I normally eat raw foods, save for dinner when I eat a few ounces of meat, and I exercise for an hour every day.”

L: “Sugar doesn't make you gain weight! If it did, fruit would make you fat cos of all the sugar in it! I need sugar anyway because I'm (wait for it... waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiit...) diabetic! I need to keep my blood sugar at a healthy level!”

At this point, I'm really irritated because not only is this the fifth time in two years that a fat person has pulled the beetus card, but also because my maternal grandmother was diabetic and even in her older age, she had stayed healthy and thin, always weighing between 105 and 110. And I'm not going to even get started on the difference between unrefined and refined sugars, because I'm betting Lardzilla spends all the time she's not eating reading up on broscience.  I keep cool though, my face very neutral and my breathing even.

Me: “My grandmother is 84 and has had diabetes for 24 years now. She isn't really able to exercise much, but she does eat a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and a tiny bit of meat. She is able to stay thin and healthy because of the foods she eats.”

L: “Well, obviously she--” she stops because I am giving her an amused look complete with a little half-smile, silently daring her to say anything at all about my grandma. L (starting up again): “Well, y'all must just have good genes then, because I eat fruits and vegetables all the time and I don't lose any weight!”

Me: “Well, I don't know what to tell you then, other than that you could join a gym. If you really want to lose weight, I'd be happy to help.”

Lardzilla just gives me a hateful look, takes her order and leaves. She still came back every day after that and kept ordering the same crap. Just thinking about ingesting all that sugar every single day almost made me want to never eat a single sweet thing ever again.

I ended up quitting that job about a month after that incident (had enough of A once and for all), but from what I've heard from others that worked there Lardzilla continued down her beetus path every day for the next year and a half. Don't know what happened to her after that, but obviously she didn't make it.

TL;DR Beetusjuice! Beetusjuice! Beetusjuice!

1364620012.0	1bae9r	Raised by a psycho planet. (not funny, just sad. Sorry.)	SometimesIArt	414	80	107	"I've been told that my last couple of stories were rage-inducing and I'm afraid this one might be too. I'm also concerned that it's not going to be very funny - just outright depressing. I know it will be a very long read. Because apparently I like wordy. 

So anyways, I've been posting in this sub for a few weeks or so, and mentioned a few times that I am a former planet (5'6"", F, 250lbs, currently down to 165lbs) and a gimp (girl with the robo-knees). Now how do you think I got there?

Yep. Raised by a planet. 

Mom and dad split when I was a teeny tiny kidlet. Dad's always had a ""beer belly"" but he keeps pretty active so whatever. Mom has always been planet. 

Super planet. 

Like currently about 5'4, 400lbs of planet. 

Dad raised me mostly, got majority custody in divorce, all cool. I adore that man and he takes my health advice seriously nowadays. He tried to get me into sports and stuff from when I was like 5, but never really had a healthy diet so that rubbed off on me. Then my mom freaked out at him that sports weren't for little girls (wtf, mom) and demanded he pull me. So I had nothing, really. Nothing too physical as a child and a less-than-awesome diet. 

When I was a tween I started work at a horse farm and that took some of the chub away, which was cool until I quit that job due to an injury and had a few years out of the horse game. I also got in a bad accident that destroyed the ligaments in my knees, and suddenly had the perfect out for any physical activity. Fatty's dream. 

Mom also guilted me into living with her full time instead of my dad. 

Seriously. Guilted. As in, made me feel like she thought I hated her because I didn't want to leave my dad. 

She would poke at the fact that I was fat all the time. Despite being literally 2x my size and a lazy ass. She was mean and entitled and abusive. The only time she every got off her ass was to beat mine. She smelled, was disgusting in her habits, was sick all the time, and demanded that I do everything. Literally. I had two younger siblings, but they were angels because they were the spawn of her and her current husband, and thus higher than I. 

I had to bring her her food, clean up her mess (which included disgusting things like snot-soaked toilet paper littering the floor, mouldy dishes [which caused me to go into anaphylactic shock due to severe allergies multiple times... in which she refused to call an ambulance for me], her fricking disgusting tent underwear, the mess she made in the bathroom that was 10 feet from the couch, and much more than you want to know about). If I didn't comply, she would use her mass to corner me and beat me with whatever she had on hand (usually a broom she wrestled away from me). 

She demanded that I feed her, of course, so in the morning I cooked her breakfast, in the afternoon I was required to come home during lunch hour in junior high school and during that time I was to get her lunch again, and in the evening... you get the picture. 

She ate typical planet stuff. Bacon, cheese, craptonnes of bread, ice cream, things soaked in cream and grease, pizza, chinese food, fast food stuff... she justified this slave work by saying that she was in charge of meal times when she was my age, so I just accepted it. 

And of course I always ate meals out of what she demanded I cook, like the rest of that unhealthy family. 

Then she got this brilliant idea that I was going to be one of those genius kids. I was on the honor roll all through school, but she demanded that on top of everything else, I was to sit on the floor of the living room in front of her couch and do homework for three hours a night regardless of how much I actually had. 

Keep in mind I was like, 13, had a job, and took care of her. So this on top of it meant I had nothing else.

And she also decided I was too fat (which I mean, was true, but talk about the kettle calling the whatever... er... fat. I'm awful at sayings.). So she said I wasn't allowed to eat anything except things she put in a special drawer in the fridge (she never put anything except like... fruit cups in there, so I would sneak food in the middle of the night and kept planet status), and would lock me out of the house in the late evening after work and my ""study session"" and cleaning the house so I could ""exercise"". I would be locked out, in the dark [9-10pm ish?!], in the cold, in the MIDDLE OF THE CITY as a 13yo girl for a couple of hours. With untreated, pretty severe chronic tendinitis in my wrecked ligaments.

Sometimes she was too lazy to get off her ass to let me in afterwards, and would sit there shaking her head and screaming through the door for me to actually go and exercise while I cried on the porch because I had frost bite on my ears and couldn't feel my feet anymore. 

So living in this situation... I was... er... everything every preteen dreamed of picking on in junior high school. I was fat, smelly (never learned good hygiene until I was like 15/16 due to shitty mom), wore gross-coloured, ill-fitting sweat pants and t-shirts to school, always snarly/bitchy due to home life/stress, cried very easily, greasy... you get the picture. I would get ridiculed endlessly at school and I didn't help matters by raging/crying every time it happened and doing the typical fat person things. 

One day in my crying/raging after someone spit a huge glop of snot/spit down my back, I insulted the wrong person and ended up in the hospital with a 4-inch pair of needle nose pliers jammed in between my ribs and pretty damn close to some vitals. Survived, went home the next morning with my step dad. 

Mom was NOT happy. I hadn't been home to study/have supper. I shit you not. I got *stabbed*, and she didn't get her food. My fucking bad. 

She said she had to starve. She was irrationally angry. Commence the usual beating/hair pulling/insulting tirade with my siblings watching gleefully from the sidelines. 

One flubber-powered punch to the face sent me collapsing over the very HOT stove, and I got burned, which I can't say had happened before. The new injury+stab wound (which was now bleeding again) finally convinced me to protect myself and I tried to run away from her... which again, I'd never done because I always thought I deserved it/knew she'd beat me worse if I did. 

She grabbed me by the neck with that bizarre fatty-strength they all seem to have and choked me against a wall, screaming that if I ever skipped a meal with her again I'd never see the light of day/I'd be grounded for a year/etc. All because of one fucking skipped meal. That she couldn't, y'know... cook for herself. 

I hit her. Yep. I don't know why, because I was terrified of her, but I punched her right in the gut while she choked me, and she immediately started screaming as if I had shot her. She ended up sitting on me/my stab wound, which I can't even tell you how painful it was, to ""get me under control."" When I wouldn't stop screaming/struggling, she threw me down a set of stairs. 

Then spent the next few hours (while I lay on the floor) screaming about how disgusting I was, how no one would love me because I look like shit, I'm fat, disgusting, don't shower, etc. All things that she taught me, right. Also said she was calling the police because ""I assaulted her."" 

So I left that night. I hadn't had the courage to tell my dad what was going on before, plus she always listened in on the line when I picked up the phone/stood in my doorway blocking any escape with her fat while I was on the phone with him. I escaped the house, phoned him, and he rescued me. 

I lived as a fatass for a while longer, but at least my dad taught me proper hygiene and I got better. 

Then, when I started losing weight, I had sorta kinda slowly reconnected with my mother. She asked how I had done it, I told her I was just eating less, doing more, and she verbally assaulted me about how unhealthy I was being, I need to eat more, I'm going to kill myself doing this, etc. Also went on about how it was bad for my knees. 

So I stopped and stayed fat for a while longer. But it didn't fit the lifestyle I wanted. 

Fast forward like 7 or so? years to now. I've been talking with her and seeing her once a year for about 3 years now. She denies every treating me badly, which I have issues accepting. But holy shit is she ever a planet. Like I said, 5'4"", 400lbs. And FULL of fat logic (is convinced if she WALKS for 5 minutes 3x a week she'll start losing weight. As in, that's the whole workout) 

She sees that I've dropped 85lbs and is ""so proud"" and shows everyone my before/after pictures... 

and... get ready for the rage... 

Tells everyone, ""look at how good she's doing! I must have done something right, hey?""

Boom. Fat entitlement at its most brutal. Need fucking credit for everything.

Sorry for the abrupt ending. This was a little more stressful to type than I thought it would be. Also sorry for the depressing story. Shit happens, right.

Secondary whale, bra flab spilling everywhere, tries to offer a voice of reason. 

&gt;Nah, she isn't anorexic, she's just stupid. 

I tell them that it's absolutely lovely where I swim, they should come down at some point. Lots of people jump in off the bridge and paddle around, and it's so cooling in this weather. Then, finally, this becomes the FPS I always hoped I would experience. 

&gt;Uh, no. I don't need no exercise, boys love my shape. You have no boobs, you should get a push-up bra until you get to a proper weight.

Third whale doesn't care about this. The gentle jingle of a Mr Whippy van distracts her, and she drifts off to get a 99. The rest join her.

1373736759.0	1i861f	Two FPS nuggets from the Farmer's Market	little0lost	381	48	23	"So today on my way to the Farmer's Market, I witnessed two different scenarios that made me think of you curvy, fabulous people. The first was inspiring, the second... was not.  
  
**The First** - Waning Moon Wanes On  
As I'm sitting at a light and looking around for a parking spot, I see two women approaching on the sidewalk in my rear view mirror. Both are jogging, with the one in front jogging backwards so she's facing her friend. Both are in the 45-55-years-old range. We'll call the lady in the front FitBroad, because she was a fit broad. I was impressed. We'll call the lady in the back Waning Moon, because while she was definitely on the chubby side, her workout clothing suggested she had probably been much larger pretty recently.  
Waning Moon is struggling, huffing and puffing, and as they get closer I can hear FitBroad talking to her. As the light turns green they finally pull alongside me and Waning Moon is still moving, but *very slowly*, face cherry red.  
""You've only got six more blocks, and you'll have done a mile more than last week!"" I hear FitBroad say as I pull away.  
I watch in my mirror as Waning Moon gets a second wind and puts on a burst of speed. She's gonna keep waning, guys.  
  
**The Second**: 5ks are for Nerds  
I've found my parking spot and am walking towards the market for my sweet, sweet local produce. All that's between me and my goods is a large set of stairs down to the area where the market is held. To my surprise, a children's 5k is currently being run along the river just feet from the market! Sweet, hadn't heard it was going on. A bunch of excited, laughing chillins run by as I approach the stairs. MassiveMamma and Mini enter the stairs just ahead of me, so I slow my roll *way* down (fast walker, here). Mini is the same age as a lot of the kids running, around 11, chubby but by no means a moon. She's watching them run, pretty envious (there are like 60-100 kids, looks fun), and asks her mother if she could run in it next year.  
MassiveMamma: ""No! Running is for nerds."" (**wut.**)  
Mamma takes a few more steps, then grabs on the railings and just stops, huffing for breath. She's too big for me to get around without bumping her, so I politely say ""excuse me"", hoping she can lean one way or the other to let me slip around.  
MassiveMamma: ""I JUST NEED ONE MINUTE, GOD.""  
Mini gives me an apologetic look and mouths ""Sorry"".  
Lo and behold, Mamma resumes her waddle in a moment, and I make my way past her and onto some glorious purple bell peppers. Poor Mini... I hope she doesn't let her mom discourage her."	t5_2vzax	True
1376533272.0	1ke60f	Giant Princess Terrorizes Children, or Chance Encounters With Abominable Snow White.	PhantomoftheMummy	382	52	57	"A few years ago I was at Disneyland (my first time!) and while I was there I saw a woman in an enormous, tent-like Snow White costume enter the park with five children, all of them dressed in ""Seven Dwarves"" drag.  Snow herself was about 5'10"" and probably weighed a little over 300.  The little ones were all slender-to-skinny, and the oldest one looked to be about ten.  All of the children seemed small for their age, curiously.  The kids called her “Mom”, so I’m assuming that’s what she was to them. 

Dressed as they were, and in a bunch, it was hard not to notice them when we encountered them again throughout the day. Having seen park employees turn a girl in a fantastic Tinkerbell outfit away, telling her they don’t allow outfits like hers in the park. I asked a nearby attendant what their policy was on costumes.  She said, ""They're pretty much okay with it unless the costume is so perfect that the visitor might be mistaken for a park performer.""  That made sense to me, for many creeper reasons. 

Then I asked, ""Why was the Tinkerbell turned away and the Snow White and Dwarves allowed in?""

She leaned in and said, ""Because no one is going to think Disneyland has a 350 pound, six foot tall Snow White wandering around the park.""
________________________________________________________

Snow White was eating a dipped banana something with nuts a few minutes later when I saw her.  Her kids were standing around her in a circle, watching. She was bellowing at them, threatening them to leave her alone or they were all going home.  The kids looked anxious for some reason.  We walked on and left them at the food stand (fifty feet inside the park).

We saw Snow again later, and at some point after we’d first noticed her she'd gotten wet, so her dress clung to her in spots and her hair was now pulled into a ponytail. All of this, with the addition of some bright blue oversized Minnie Mouse sunglasses pretty much killed any XXXL Snow White thing she might have had going on.  She was hunched over at a low table, eating a small tray of hot dogs and onion rings.  At least six dogs.  Her children sat quiet and watched.  Again, she didn't seem to be bothering to feed them.  As she ate, she lectured them, telling them that if they didn't stop their begging they wouldn't be allowed to ride any rides.  She sent one of the kids to refill her giant soda, and I noticed on the way back the little girl stopped and sipped at the straw.  Her face lit up for an instant before she surrendered the drink back to her mother, who never even stopped bitching at the kids to acknowledge her. When she was done, the Dwarves squabbled over who would get to take her “empty” tray to the trash can.  The two youngest kids carried it away, but stopped to eat the ends of the hot dog buns Mamapotamus had left behind.  Two little kids eating crumbs. Snow was starting to seriously bum me out.  

We were taking a break there, and from where we were sitting we watched Snow take her kids to one of the rides near the hot dog place (honestly don't remember which, but it was an outdoor ride) and she told the oldest boy to watch his four brothers and sisters, and that she'd be back in a minute.  All of this was shouted at top volume.  Her voice was strong but starting to become hoarse with the day's wear. 
Twenty minutes later, she comes off the ride and just waddles through the group of kids, all of whom follow her more through habit than interest. She drifted up to an ice cream shack and ordered an ice cream for herself.  The kids must have known not to ask by this point.

Later still, we saw Snow standing by a topiary sculpture of Minnie and Mickey.  She was posed between the two figures, but well below them.  Her oldest son was taking her picture.  All of the children were behind the camera.  Snow made sure of that, shouting ""Stay the hell out of the picture"" several times.  The boy took a couple of pictures, his mother tore the camera back from his hands and started off in another direction.  She had been eating some fries from a paper cone, but again, the kids didn't seem to be eating anything.  Snow was covered in ketchup, chocolate and other food stains, but the kids were still spotless. She slugged at a bottle of bright red Beetus juice she wore on a strap, like a canteen. 

Three hours or more go by until I hear that voice again, this time screaming at a person she didn't help to make.  She was screaming at a staff member for something, but her voice was so raw by now that it was hard to catch it all.  I picked up a lot of “How DARE you” and “CALL THA COPS THEN!” coming from her, and soon enough the police joined the park security.  This usually means someone is getting arrested.

Apparently, she'd left the kids in a restaurant and told them to wait right there, that she'd be right back, but that she'd never returned.  She was arguing that she'd intended to get the kids in time to leave before the park closed! It was her RIGHT as a PARENT!  I guess, by this she meant she had the right to starve and abandon her children.  I don’t think she thought that argument through at the time.
The kids were taken into custody by the police, and the mother was arrested (For child endangerment? Abandonment?)  Two cops were sitting at a table nearby with all five Dwarves, each kid enthusiastically digging into sandwiches, shakes and fries courtesy of either Anaheim PD or Disneyland, but it was obvious that they hadn’t eaten in quite a while.  

TL/DR: I saw an enormous screaming, greedy bag of sick treat herself to a day of goodies and Disneyland without sharing anything with her five children.  Then the cops came and made everyone’s day.

Some context: for reasons unrelated to weight, since high school I've almost totally stopped talking to Ursa Major/Minor, as their entitled personalities transcend conversations about food and I'd had enough of it, so there was already a lot of tension between us. Ursa Minor didn't come because she was on a roadtrip with her friends. Also, I've never had many friends and was seen through my childhood as the weird girl people avoided (mostly because of my nerdy interests, which I am thankful are now more mainstream) and was bullied a lot. Ursa Minor, at least from what she tells me, has never been that unpopular, always had a group of close friends and was pretty extroverted. This will become relevant.

&gt;drawn into their orbit, seated, me directly across from Ursa Major, table is pretty big

&gt;we order, and by we I mean Ursa Major orders so much food that no one feels the need to add anything else

&gt;receiving messages from the stars

&gt;asking how college is

&gt;""It's fine.""

&gt;ask if I've made friends

&gt;""No, I'm trying to concentrate on studying so I'm not doing many extracurriculars."" 

&gt;says someone like me should be making lots of friends, and by ""like me,"" they mean ""someone who isn't 
morbidly obese like Ursa Minor, who dropped out of school because she thought people were making fun of her 
weight

&gt;explain I'll think about friends after I feel settled in, just want to get used to the environment first

&gt;""Well throwing_pies, you always *were* a bit weird and quiet, weren't you?""

&gt;tension obviously rising, but don't take the bait

&gt;food arrives

&gt;take small portions (most of the food was drenched in sauce, and I don't like the taste of it) 

&gt;Ursa Major ready to roar

&gt;""Why are you eating so little?! Sister, why is your daughter eating so little?! She's going to starve! She's 
skinny enough!""

&gt;don't like that my mom's being blamed for something that has nothing to do with her, speak to the skies

&gt;say the food looks a bit more heavy than I'm used to, will eat more at home

&gt;""You haven't even tried them yet!""

&gt;I can see and smell the sauce dripping off of the food it ordered and it's disgusting

&gt;""Ursa Major, I--""

&gt;The heavens fall and the constellations grab my plate out of my hands, begins loading with all kinds of dishes I 
have no interest in eating

&gt;Plate is stuffed, dripping in sauce, even the things I had wanted to eat are now covered in it

&gt;so much dismay

&gt;""Here throwing_pies! There's some of everything, so try it! You aren't allowed to eat anything else until you 
eat all of that.""

&gt;mfw she thinks there's anything she can actually threaten me with

&gt;""Ursa Major, she's *my* daughter. Throwing_pies, eat what you want.""

&gt;thanks mom

&gt;Ursa Major isn't happy

&gt;""But you're raising her to be close-minded! How does she know she doesn't like those foods! She doesn't! She's 
going to be boring! She's not going to have new experiences! Look, she's not even doing anything in college! At 
least Ursa Minor joined a lot of clubs and tried to meet new people! This is why throwing_pies is the way she is! 
You're not encouraging her to change!""

&gt;mfw she's comparing me to her dropout daughter on the basis of what I'm eating at a restaurant for single meal

&gt;ignore her, use different plate, eat as planned

&gt;Sky doesn't like being ignored, huffily glares at me for few minutes

&gt;after awhile

&gt;beady pork eyes affixed on me

&gt;""I want that chicken dish.""

&gt;A very heavy dish of chicken with a ton of sauce is in front of my grandmother and I, but my grandmother is 
closer to Ursa Major so she picks it up so that it can be passed to Ursa Major

&gt;beady pork eyes glint with malice-- or is that lard? 

&gt;""No, I want throwing_pies to bring it to me.""

&gt;thefuck.jpg

&gt;Dad also is thefuck.jpg

&gt;""Ursa Major, why? Throwing_pies is the farthest person away from you, she'd have to pick it up and physically 
walk around the table to give it to you. Why would you make her do that?""

&gt;""THAT'S WHAT I WANT HER TO DO. SHE NEEDS TO LISTEN TO HER ELDERS.""

&gt;""...Ursa Major, why can't you just come get it? Or let us pass it to you?"" 

&gt;""NO, I CAN'T. IT'S TOO FAR AND IT'S HEAVY. YOU HAVE TO DO IT FOR ME.""

&gt;the fuck, you spend the whole meal criticizing me and now you're trying to order me around just to order me 
around? Why?

&gt;""Why don't you think it'd be too heavy for me?"" 

&gt;""LOOK HOW SKINNY YOU ARE, OF COURSE YOU CAN. WHAT, YOU THINK YOU'RE TOO GOOD TO LISTEN TO ME? 
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE IN UNIVERSITY NOW?""

&gt;She is actually yelling

&gt;People starting to stare

&gt;Grandmother tries to get her to stop, grabs dish, quickly passes over to Ursa Major

&gt;Ursa Major even less pleased, tries to push dish back

&gt;""I don't want YOU to give it to me! I WANT HER TO DO IT!!! PUT IT BACK! MAKE HER DO IT!!!"" 

&gt;I see an opportunity, take it

&gt;""Ursa Major, your mother is *your* elder. Why aren't you listening to her?""

&gt;Silence

&gt;Revving up, final attack, addresses my mom

&gt;""See! See how disrespectful she is! That's why you have problems with her! That's why she has no friends! 
And she's too proud! *MY* daughter is off having a roadtrip with her *friends*! She's experiencing a lot of 
things while she's young! How are you raising your daughter?!?!?!""

&gt;Well at least she stopped yelling and now she's just furiously hissing

&gt;Mother just sighs

&gt;Rest of meal in stony silence

&gt;At home, dad says we're never going out to lunch with them again as long as I'm with them

&gt;Unfortunately his decision did not stick, but I appreciated his support.


I realize it could've been resolved faster if I'd just done it, but Ursa Major has a history of making weird irrational requests like this just to show off any ""authority"" she has, so at this point everyone's sick of it. She passed this attitude on to Ursa Minor, who is older than me and thus treats me the same way. It's why I don't talk to them anymore, they're family, but they have zero respect for anyone they consider underneath them. My uncle didn't talk much since he's just a quiet guy, even though I've known him my whole life I know next to nothing about him. Wonder how he got stuck with Ursa Major.

Backstory: Looking after family's junk food/movie store while they vacation. Located in hick town, middle of fricking cold nowhere, Canada. 

Story #2: 

Evening rush just finished, catching up on shelving and cleaning that I had to put aside while the customers were lined up (only one person works here at a time), balancing a towering stack of DVD cases when Sumo Sarah walks into the store. Huffing and puffing, beet red and SWEATING, despite it being a literal blizzard outside and stupid cold. I'm a little amazed at her dedication to get here, actually. She lumbers up to the ice cream counter and stands there, staring at the board that lists our flavours. I quickly walk across the store to put the DVD stack down as she wheezes at me, ""hey!""  

I smile like a good clerk and say, ""hey, how's it going?"" 

""I want ice cream."" 

Okay... so, lacking some communication skills, but alright, I get the picture. I carefully put the stack on the counter and navigate to the ice cream section. ""Alright, just give me a second here!"" 

""I want to order some ice cream."" 

""Yep! I just have to wash my hands."" I rush to the sink and slick my hands in soap as she says. 

""I don't care, don't worry about washing."" 

""Sorry, it's regulation, I'll only be a second..."" Dammit, I'm not going to stick dirty hands in food for public sale... 

I finish up in about 5 seconds and by then Sumo Sarah is scowling. 

""Sorry about that, what can I get for you?"" 

""I don't know what I want, what one do you like?"" 

... I don't eat ice cream. I'm a runner, and dairy + running = pooping your pants. I look at the tubs for a second before looking up and admitting that I haven't eaten ice cream in years and honestly can't make a recommendation. I should have lied. Really, I should have... seriously, just could have PICKED one and she wouldn't have known. 

""Why the *hell* wouldn't you eat ice cream?"" 

I can think of about 10 reasons involving calories, sugar, and less pleasant things, but I just shrug. ""Don't like it, I guess."" 

She grunts and sways for a bit, still staring at the tubs. ""Is that one good?"" (she points). 

""I'm honestly not sure. People seem to like it, it's fairly popular. Would you like me to grab you a tester spoon?"" 

""No, you taste it. You should do it. It's your job to know. This is you learning."" 

""Ma'am, I honestly can't---""

She slams her fist on the top of the sneeze guard and I back up. ""JUSTEATTHEICECREAM."" 

""Ma'am, please don't yell at me. I don't eat ice cream for health reasons. I can't have dairy at all."" (not entirely true, I can, but it's a thing I chose to cut out) ""I'm sorry that I'm not up to your standards, but that is the situation we're in. I assure you it's temporary and the owners will be back in two weeks and they can help you. Now, if you tell me what you normally like, perhaps I can list off the flavours similar to it."" 

Glaring and grumbling and stomping her feet, she jabs her finger in the general direction of the bucket marked ""birthday cake."" ""I want that."" 

There's small bits of cake and sprinkles and icing flavour in it. It looks like blue and pink vomit frozen in a plastic tub. 

""Give me double scoops of that on a chocolate-dipped waffle cone."" 

I scoop it for her and she takes it while giving me the most nasty sneer and, I shit you not, baring her teeth. 

""Now give me a bowl of that --"" jabs her fingers at some toffee and chocolate chunk monstrosity ""-- double-scooped with chocolate syrup. 

I should have known she knew full well what everything was about in this section. I got that for her as well. 

""And a single scoop on a pretzel cone of cotton candy."" 

All of my wat spilled out all over the floor as I finished up. I actually glanced around for a kid or someone else hidden behind her as I handed her the last thing. The diabeetus is growing strong in this one. 

""Will that be all for you?"" 

""No, give me a box."" 

Would it kill this woman to calm down and stop being a bitch? Probably. I silently get her a box with holes in it that you can put ice cream cones in so they don't fall over. I punch a hole for the one bowl and give it to her. She loads it up. ""Take those to the till and ring them in."" 

As I do what she says, she lumbers over to the cooler and grabs a 2L of Fanta (the sugariest of the sugary pops) and gives that to me to ring through as well. 

""And when you're done that, write a note for the manager that I will be speaking to them about *you*."" 

I am the manager. Have been since the store opened eight years ago. Left home/lived in the city for 5 years, still the manager, still cover shifts when no one else can. 

""Okay."" 

""Have them give me a call. Write down my number."" I do. 

Snatches her change from me when I finish the transaction, grabs her stuff and races out the door as fast as her elephant legs can manage. 

Oh, you think it's done, don't you. 

NOPE. 

She goes to her car, which I can see out of the GLASS FRONTED STORE, and DEVOURS the smallest ice cream cone she bought while sitting there with the lights off. I just can't look away. How does a human eat something that cold, that fast?!

She then picks the box, heaves up out of her car, and comes BACK INTO THE STORE. 

""I dropped a cone outside in the snow. I need a new one."" 

I see the uneaten cone and the bowl in the box and realize she thinks she was being fucking sneaky. 

""Can you show me where you dropped it?"" I ask. 

""No, screw your shitty customer service. Give me a new one."" 

""Okay... ma'am... I saw you eat the cone in your car. I can't give you a free ice cream. I will scoop you another if you'd like, but you'll have to pay for it."" 

""IF I WANTED THAT MUCH ICE CREAM I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT MUCH. I DROPPED IT, IT WAS FOR MY DAUGHTER! YOU ARE STEALING FROM A CHILD!"" 

""Sorry, ma'am, I can't do anything for you. I physically SAW you eat it, and--"" 

""What are you saying? ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?"" 

""Ma'am, I --"" 

""When the owners get back, YOU ARE SO FIRED. Where did they find you, anyways? On the streets? Holy shit, they'll hire any crackhead looking for a job these days."" 

""I'm their daughter."" 

""Oh, they must be SO PROUD."" Dripping with sarcasm. She storms off. Tries to slam the door. Door has a slow-close brace, won't slam. She gets into her car, tries to speed off, gets stuck in the snow, has to reverse/forward a few times to get out, takes off. 

I'm scared she'll come in again. "	t5_2vzax	True

Be 22, just out of the Marine Corps.
Be ripped beyond belief.
Become personal trainer.
Like predator from the movie, my laser gaze descends upon fatones with swift terror. (No actual laser, cant afford)

Act 1: passing the torch

Start training new client dalebro, hes young, 15, fat but fixable.
2 months of training 3x a week, he is making progress.
Food log is strict but says he doesnt always know how to eat healthy, so we go to the market, ""dalebro, usually i just do this with older clients to show them how to shop for healthy food, but its never too early to learn how to look for healthy options."" We go around with a basket choosing healthy food stuffs, throw in some eggs I tell dalebro: you need the proteins to get jacked, dalebros eyes light up, bright eyed and bushy tailed, hes hungry for the iron. Dalebro sees how he can trudge through life under the flabby wing of his mother, or forge his own way through the painful bliss that only the weights can give. 

Act 2: Encounter

Ring ring ring. 
Phone goes off.
Invited to dinner at dalebros, by his mother.
I accept invitation. 

I arrive at the location.

Ring doorbell. Minutes pass.
Ungodly mass appears, dont know if it is dark or light behind the mass, entire doorway is blocked. 
 
WELCOME  garbble garbble 
IT initiates an embrace, I oblige.
Rub up on one of her chins.
ohgodwhy.jpg

Only upon entering the domain do I clearly see the magnitude of the situation.
 Class V Hamplanet, Dreadnaught Series overdeveloped triceps look like holiday hams stapled to her arms. Rolls on her waist look like innertubes about to burst. 

FEAR.

Act 3: Dinner is served

We sit down for dinner after the hamplanet went to the bathroom for what seemed like ages. 

Salad bowl comes out, hamplanet shovels blue cheese dressing onto her 2 oz portion of leafy greens.

""Weve all been trying to eat healthy ever since you've been training dale. teehee""

Body is frozen. Looking on in disgust as the curdles of dressing clump ontop of one another. No sign of leafy greens. 

Dale goes sans dressing. 
I am proud.

Hamplanet tells me how she used to be a fatsun designer and how I have probably seen some of her designs.

Yea whatever.

She had to quit because she developed a terrible thyroid condition.

Phasers set from stun, to kill. I lie in wait.

A gelatenous spice wofts through the air.

Fucking knew it, KFC.

3 buckets, I shit you not.

""We always have leftovers. Teehee""

Think in my head: even a zimbabwean tribe would have leftovers.

Hamplanet helps herself to 1-2 whole chickens.

Dale takes a piece and removes the deep fried crust.

Student has become the master. I am impressed. Horrible flashbacks to food journal.

Mon night: chicken
Tue night: chicken 
Thurs night: chicken

My anger rises.

She casually asks ""do you know any tips on how to lose belly fat? I just need to lose a little around the midsection, not too much though.""

Jaw hits floor.
My anger rises.

I eat the chicken sans skin to give dalebro some support. Kid is a champ.

Hamplanet notices we arent eating the skin. I can see she is upset, the grease and skin of her own chicken is all over her many chins. She says how the skin is the best part and we shouldnt waste it. Dalebro is embarrassed, he says ""its what i usually do mom im trying to be healthy."" Hamplanet snatches the skin from dalebros plate.

""Nomnomnom fine if you wont eat it i will""

She eyes my fried chicken skin. 
Dont know what to do, cant let fear take over. Fall back on my training.

Excuse myself to use the restroom. 

Act 4: Aftermath

I return from the bathroom, hamplanet and dalebro seem to be upset. I dont want to be the one creating a divide between son and mother, but if it means dalebro wont turn out like this... thing of a hamplanet i will take that responsibility.

Sit down at my spot, plate is clean, possibly licked clean. I slowly look up to meet her gaze. 

Hamplanet begins her lambasting:

""I ate your skin, I knew you wouldnt mind since you cant eat that sort of stuff, I try to be healthy but i dont let it ruin and control my life. I could go on a diet but my thyroid...

I cut her off.

""Your underactive thyroid stops you from losing weight""

The look on her face was muddled anger, surprise and flab.

""My father has one too.""

Hamplanet, visaully shaken garbles in confusion.

She says ""oh so you must know how hard it is to lose weight than""

I think she smiled, could have just been the grease forming a psuedogrin.

""I know it is hard but not impossible, my father rises before the sun and promises himself that whatever he does today he will do it with every ounce of conviction and precision he has, from dawn til sunset he will pray for peace yet prepare for war. My father also broke his back and legs im an accident 10 years ago, he recovered and he doesnt limit himself to the restrictions of his body, he overcomes them with the power and determination of his mind.""

Hamplanet was not ready for that shit. What could she say, she had chosen her path of drudgery and excuses. And I wasnt about to sit around leading to the idea that, that was the only option. Not in front of dale.

Epilogue

I wish i had more story to tell, truth is I left soon after. Dalebro stopped training with me. This was 3 years ago. Dale is 18 now, and I hope I left enough of an impression on him. He talked about joining the Marines when he was old enough, I wish I knew if he did or does. I moved from that town, got married and can now only wonder. 

Dale if you see this, let me know.

He'd pull a cutesy voice and say ""Sanity, can you get me some chocolate plweeeeease?"", he'd do this a lot just so not to seem demanding and when I called him out on it it was clear he knew full well he was manipulating me and laughed in my face. Again.

&gt; One time when I was cooking I thought 


&gt; ""its good that I'm giving up what I want to do in life because it saves FC from killing himself""


&gt; The bomb fucking drops and I stop myself, absolutely horrified at what I just said, this is not me! (Future me is thankfully no where near this wet and pathetic)


&gt; I'm ready to throw the frying pan at his fat stupid face


&gt; RM1 has to stop me


&gt; FC hasn't noticed because omg Xbox


&gt; carry on as normal

Whenever I got my period he'd look disappointed and said ""I was hoping you'd be pregnant"" as a way of trying to forcefully keep me around. One time my period was late I constantly was having panic attacks and crying because I didn't want to be pregnant or have him breed. Back when having sex with him wasn't so bad, I'd dressed up in something sexy and surprised him while he was playing Xbox. I really tried to make myself look drop dead gorgeous and I'd lost some weight so I really felt it. I go in to his room and stand in the doorway. Give him about 10 seconds to look away from the TV, form an angry face, sigh and say ""I suppose I have to stop what I'm doing now then?"". Heartbroken I say no and just walk back to my room and cry.

7) Now shit has hit the fan with me when I come home from work I just cook for myself. Big plates of pasta enough for a decent portion for two people (although it'd be a ""snack"" by FC's standards). It's the last few months of our relationship and he's not made good on the effort to stop being a little bitch child after I told him to man the fuck up. A gas bill had come but the names on it weren't ours so needed changing, FC pretty much breaks down at the prospect of having to be a big boy and phone the utility company to change the names. Back to the pasta I was making. At this point I think he thought that because he'd tried to man up once (by doing the dishes one time) that he no longer had to try so he was glued to the Xbox yet again. The only time he'd turned to look at me or acknowledge that I was there was when I had food. Or RM1 had food. He'd been sat there stuffing junk all day while I was at work but he hadn't eaten for maybe 3 hours. He goes to have a bath and when he comes out he's ""feeling faint and light headed"" because of the heat of the bath and that he ""hasn't eaten all day"" and he's staggering around so much you think he was trying to win an Oscar. 

8) So FC repeats his first year of uni because he didn't do any work the first time round and still does jack shit when given a second chance. Cue more government money for junk food. The uni luckily sees this and kicks him out half way through the year. He then spends six months making excuses about job hunting and had applied reluctantly to 2 in all that time. Me and RM1 both worked and the three of us were looking for a private place to live now that FC wasn't a student, student accommodation wasn't an option. FC was rapidly running into his overdraft and had the threat of bailiffs coming to take his stuff. We were walking home from the supermarket where we'd had appeased FC again with buying him more junk food (I actually got a sick pleasure out of helping make him fat after all the bullshit he'd put me through and wasted my time) when he says ""Sanity, you've got savings. You can pay for my rent while I look for a job.""

&gt; wait what....


&gt; AREYOUFUCKINGKIDDINGME.bmp

I can't hide my disgust at what he's just said. He owes me and RM1 hundreds of pounds, maybe even a grand already and he comes out with that?! Hands off my money fatty!

9) So FC finally runs out of money and hits his overdraft limit. No thanks for the free ride and his parents come to take him home. Money is tight enough already for them and they have 2 small children to feed. FC just sponges off his younger, hotter, far more independent brother and somehow gets fatter. There's a lot of non-fat related shit FC has said to me over the 2 years. I should have never looked twice at him. I'm glad I survived but I wish life had gone differently. I'm a much more confident person now thanks to the friends I made post-FC and I get better each day. So FC is at home, I don't text him ever even though I love and miss him for some reason. He catches on to this and we talk over Facebook at a friends house. I end it with him and cry and vow to start getting the sex I've been missing out on. These are some of the things he said to me:

&gt; ""this is all your fault""


&gt; ""the only thing that makes me happy is knowing you'll never have anyone as good in bed as me"" (LOL!)


&gt; ""don't expect to get any of that money back""


&gt; ""shut the fuck up""


&gt; and goes offline

I cry a lot over the next few days, hang out and have awesome times/sex with friends. He threatens to come up to my town to see me and chat about things. 

&gt; nothingtotalkabout@dealwithit.com

He texts me saying ""I want to come over to talk"". No way am I letting that shit into my new place with RM1. We meet at a local pub, FC, me, RM1 and FC's loser friend. Things are awkward and tense. FC and me get left alone and tries to say things I can't remember to piss me off. Then he says ""I can't talk to you properly here"" then being the whiny little bitch that he is he storms out and I've never seen him since.

&gt; time to party!

Wow, that felt good to get off my chest!

&gt;Be engaged to Samurott, 5'10, 185, no fatlogic but a general attitude of ""disregard fitness, acquire Masters degree""

&gt;Wedding planning fuck yeah

&gt;Decide on just one bridesmaid and groomsman each

&gt;Ask childhood best friend, Skitty, to be maid of honor

&gt;Skitty lives in another state and doesn't have a lot of money, but I offer to pay her transportation because I really want her there

&gt;Not exactly rich myself, but we'll figure something out

&gt;foresight.win


Break from the greentext for some background on Skitty. At the time our tragic tale takes place she was a recovering mini-moon who had always been pudgy but had recently lost a lot of weight from strength training and general not eating like a fuckwit. Fitness was a huge priority for her at that time, and she had told me she wouldn't want to date a guy who didn't make it a similar priority. Unfortunately, Skitty doesn't have a lot of self confidence and has some issues with depression, and at this time was the type of person who thought she needed to have a boyfriend to be validated as a person. She'd recently gone through a really bad break-up and I was worried about her, wanted her to be happy.


&gt;About 6 months before the wedding, Skitty tells me about her new boyfriend, Wailord.

&gt;Be happy that Skitty is finally moving on after her last break-up

&gt;Ask her about Wailord, she gets kind of defensive as she describes him as ""A bit pudgy""

&gt;ominous.exe

&gt;Still, being a bit pudgy myself, I don't judge, just want Skitty to be happy

&gt;Skitty asks if Wailord can come to the wedding too, as he wants to drive her there

&gt;Fuck yeah, less transportation expenses for me

&gt;Spend the next several months going about my business doing grad school and planning a wedding

&gt;Still, ominous portents are on the horizon, and troubling tales are reported from the otherwise harmonious world of Skitty and Wailord


&gt;Skitty tries gently encourage Wailord to pick up healthier habits

&gt;Wailord resists every step of the way

&gt;Claims he can't walk more than short distances at a time

&gt;Care to guess the reason?

&gt;If you guessed A CONDITION, you may now claim your prize!

&gt;One delicious beetus-placating cookie for you

&gt;Wailord is an insanely picky eater, will not touch anything that's not fries, pizza, or Starbeetus


&gt;Skitty's parents are divorced and her mom is getting re-married 

&gt;Skitty and Wailord go to Skitty's mom's wedding, eat pasta dish with peppers and mushrooms and stuff

&gt;Not a half hour into the reception, Wailord asks Skitty to take him home

&gt;Skitty is maid of honor and can't really leave, but Wailord insists

&gt;Threatens to throw up in front of everyone if they don't leave

&gt;Finally Skitty agrees to take Wailord home, Wailord goes off on her for giving him pasta with vegetables in it.

&gt;""You know it sets off muh condishun!""

&gt;Would be curious to know what this mysterious condition is that simultaneously makes one not able to do exercise and not able to digest vegetables

&gt;veryominous.bat


&gt;Disregard these foreboding signs, as there are invitations to send, registries to be greedy on, dresses to force onto my pudgy frame

&gt;Be two weeks before the wedding

&gt;Aw man, shit's getting real now

&gt;Wake up one morning to frantic e-mail from Skitty

&gt;Wailord's parents are cutting him off from his freeloading neckbeard ways

&gt;""WAAAAH They're gonna make me do WORK and that's OPPRESSION""

&gt;Being cut off means also no more car, which is in his parents' name

&gt;Wailord can no longer drive to the wedding

&gt;Be annoyed about short notice because flights aren't cheap this close in, but whatevs, volunteer to fly her out

&gt;nope.docx

&gt;Wailord pitches an almighty fit

&gt;""Skitty, how DARE you even THINK about going to the wedding, don't you know I NEED you during this difficult TIME? My EVIL CRUEL OPPRESSIVE PARENTS are ABANDONING ME and I need you to be HERE""

&gt;Two weeks before the wedding is a bit late to find a new maid of honor

&gt;Fuck I don't have time for this


&gt;Day of the wedding arrives, I am jerked awake at 2 AM

&gt;What's this? An earthquake, in the rocky mountains?

&gt;Nope, just the gravitational pull of Wailord's car pulling into our driveway

&gt;All 5'8, 400 lbs of him steps out of the car, with Skitty desperately trying to escape from his folds

&gt;Still, dude just drove across the country, try to give him the benefit of the doubt

&gt;What I don't know is the horror is only beginning


tl;dr best friend has hamplanet boyfriend who offers to drive her to my wedding but then acts like a humongous manchild and almost prevents her from going to the wedding at all, only to come through at the last minute. A happy ending ... or is it?


Next time on Tales of Skitty and Wailord, witness Wailord's shenanigans at Wal Mart, Starbeetus, and, of course, the wedding itself.

Part 6: Survival of the fittest 

Enter my mother, 5'6/167cm 120lbs/54kg/8.5stone checking up on DuckDuckHam 5'11/180cm 350lbs/159kg/25stone and his CUNDISHION.

DuckDuckHam had worn out his heart due to copious eating and it was hanging on by the thinnest of threads. This had resulted in DuckDuckHam not being able to work for a bit so his Health Insurance wasn't going to cover his stay much longer (Dat American Health Care). In situations like these, the hospital can make certain exceptions and alongside the state help foot the bills for all the medical care.

BUT (and its a big but) DuckDuckHam had to prove that he was changing his lifestyle and trying to eat less because even in his deplorable condition he was still chugging down whole chickens and cows attributing it to ""If I'm going to die, I'd rather die happy"" 

""DuckDuckHam, The Chief of Medicine has decided to help foot the bill for all the medical care and surgical procedures if y...""

""Oh thank you lord!! That is good news!""

""Let me finish, you have to lose 10 pounds in two weeks""

""HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LOSE THAT MUCH?!""

""For starters, you could not finish that bucket of chicken and lay off the snacks""

""BUT MY BLOOD SUGAH""

""You'll be fine""

""HMMPH! WHAT IF I CAN'T DO IT?!""

""Then we have to release you""

""YOU CANT DO THAT! THATS AGAINST THE LAW! ITS DISCRIMINATION!""

""Sir, your insurance is running out and unless you want to foot the bill yourself then be my guest""

(The bills were approx. $125,000, 82000 GBP)

My mom checked up on him everyday and he seemed to eat just fine but at the end of the two weeks they weighed him and he got 15 pounds fatter.

howintheworld.noface

Turns out he had his kids sneak in food and ate it because the diet was ""too hard"" and ""rabbit food is not for real people""

He ended up being released despite throwing a tantrum, since legally the hospital couldn't do anything more.

DuckDuckHam passed away 2 months after the incidence due to, you guessed it, Heart Failure and his casket had to made with reinforced steel according to rumours.

TL;DR Fatman given a second chance at life for free, throws it away for chicken.

&gt;Be me, working at the home improvement store that isn't Lowes.

&gt;20's, human-sized, not planet

&gt;Standing and waiting for customer to come through my line

&gt;Casually glancing throughout the store, trying to make eye contact with customers so they come to my line, not bitch co-worker's

&gt;and then it happens

&gt;I witness the migration of the wilderbeast: age (roughly 25), weight (roughly 320 (think [this.](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-28805-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0#.UbXGAEBQGPx))

&gt;wilderbeast waddles down aisles with the meanest mug I have ever seen

&gt;complexion of wilderbeast is similar to that of a deep fried fire truck, covered in melted Red Vines

&gt;*somebody forgot sunscreen*

&gt;Wilderbeast fatty disappears between the aisles of hardware and industrial-sized-stomach-staples

&gt;A smoothness is felt in the atmosphere that I had never known

&gt;A sigh of relief resonates throughout the store

&gt;stock items are quickly gathered by employees and placed back in their positions on the shelves

&gt;oh, the horror

&gt;the cracks and explosions from the gravitational pull of wilderbeast fatty will be coming out of our paychecks for weeks

&gt;I manage to forget about fatty for a bit

&gt;There is peace in the seven kingdoms

&gt;Around 20 minutes later, fatty emerges from the abyss that is our store's aisles

&gt;**Wilderbeast is now in a wheelchai, pushed by unidentified skinny dude, around 6'0"" 155 lbs**

&gt;*okay, whatever, come into my line*

&gt;Fatty does not have the time to be polite (or civilized) to the cashier (me)that is checking her out and giving her a sizable discount

&gt;*(I do my best to give everyone a discount of some form, because fuck it, why not.)*

&gt;I ask for wlderbeast's id, as she is purchasing on a credit card

&gt;Wilderbeast stands, stretches, and completely removes herself from wheelchair in order to sign swipe pad

&gt;mfw wheelchairs are only for people who seriously can't walk, (which constitutes a large amount of our customers, as we only have one wheelchair and most of our clients are senior citizens)

&gt;mfw wilderbeast asks me to ring up a snickers bar, almond joy and cookies and creme bar before paying for the rest of her items, as she needs to eat """"now, so she has the energy to deal with this standing bullshit"""" while she swipes her card

&gt;Hambeast proceeds to walk out of the store, happily nomming on candy while being supported by skinny (bf? husband? cursed by the lord) gentleman who is escorting her out

&gt;mfw she left the wheelchair out by her car, *in the back of the parking lot*, so one of the employees had to go grab it before any other customers who were **actually** disabled needed to use it.

1367020552.0	1d6rqa	Part 3: Lardquisha and the Moons - ConfectionAffection’s Coming Out Story	ConfectionAffection	442	118	76	"[Part 1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d4s3e/part_1_lardquisha_and_the_moons/ ) [Part 2]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d5rqx/part_2_lardquisha_and_the_moons/)

This is the epic conclusion to the Lardquisha and the moons incident and the story of how I unintentionally came out to the world. For background, refer to Parts 1 and 2 linked above.

When we last saw everyone’s favorite chocolate braised hamplanet, she was giving a thorough tongue lashing to myself, ConfectionAffection, due to the fact that she tripped on a case of “pickles and liquid defiance” that she herself deemed necessary to kick without provocation. Naturally, I could not help laughing at the lardbeast and the justice inherent in the Great Fall. We rejoin the story just as her initial tirade is winding down (precious calories were being expended, dehydration was imminent—hamplanet problems).

&gt;Be me 


&gt;Standing, mouth agape at the stream of curses and ratchet insults spewing from Lardquisha’s fried chicken hole


&gt;My face is light pink in hue, not from embarrassment or anger, but from the aerosol mist of Phat brand bubblegum lip gloss misting from Lardquisha’s lips and settling on my person


&gt;The moons’ orbits were interrupted, so they returned to murmuring and yelling affirmation and agreement with each remark spilling from their planet’s mouth


 &gt;”…AND YOO A FAT-HATIN MUFUCKER THAT GETS ALL UP IN MAH BID-NISS WITCH YO MUFUCKIN BOXES TRIPPIN’ UP THIS GERRGEOUS ASS, I OTTA HAVE MAH DADDY SUE YO ASS FOR ERRYTHING YOO WARTH YA MUFUCKIN BITCH-TRIPPING GODDAM TRIFLIN’ SUMBITCH!”


&gt;Hambeast is gasping for breath after 5 straight minutes of yelling, nay, screaming


&gt;Hambeast takes two ~~breaths~~ wheezes before delivering the coup de tat of fat paranoia. Note that not a word had been said by myself at this point


&gt;”I BE GETTING’ SO MUFUCKING GODDAMN TIARD O’ SKRAWNY BITCHES THINKIN DEY SOOOO MUCH BETTER DEN MA BLACK ASS JUST CUZ I GOT SUM MEET ON MAH BONES AND LAUGHING BEHIND MAH BACK THINKING THEY SO HIGH’N GODDAMNDMIGHTY! YOU DON’T LIKE DIS PHAT GETUP” (gesturing to “Dusty Rose in the Ghetto” colored tinfoil jumpsuit) 


&gt;”AN DIS PHAT POLISH AN DIS HERR WEAVE? MUFUCKING **DEAL** WIDDIT!” 


&gt;Silence falls across the store, punctuated by desperate breathing *wheeze, wheeze, wheeze*


&gt;Lardquisha braces against the berber-cue sauce shelf (her original target) due to mental and physical exhaustion


&gt;The need to say something begins to grab hold of insides, I begin longing to fill the awkward silence


&gt;Two other stockers are now gathered, looking on incredulously at either end of the aisle


&gt;[TFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfkw24emFr1qaz4rk.gif)


&gt;T, a former victim of Lardquisha, cowers on the other side of the aisle. I can hear her whimpering, feel her empathy, desperation, and helplessness


&gt;It dawns on me that Lardquisha and the moons are looking at me expectantly—they expect an apology


&gt;Not a word is spoken, but I feel the silent entreaty in their squinted, piggy eyes


&gt;awwwwheeeeellnerr.jpg


&gt;I decide to tell the lardbeast what’s what, but in a desperate compromise with my sense of self preservation, I latch onto the one thing that I took note of in her inane rant and could convincingly lie about an instant before I open my mouth


&gt;”I think your nail polish is great” says I


&gt;”Wat” says the conscious section of my brain 


&gt;This is where my gayness begins to gain relevance. You see, for those of you who don’t know, gays have an instinct to notice shoes, nail polish, outfits, dye jobs—whether good, bad, or ugly. In her rant I heard her accuse me of not being like hurr ""phat"" nail polish, the only thing she had said that I could refute without completely lying


&gt;”O yerr?” wheezes the hambeast


&gt;”Yeah,” says I. “You match head to toe!”


&gt;Note: by match I meant that they were both pink, so technically this wasn’t a lie. In reality they clashed horribly, “Dusty Rose in the Ghetto” does not match “Neon Sign in RunDownBarAcrossTheRailroadTracks Pink”


&gt;”Aw boo, ain’tyerr sweet,” says Lardquisha, giving me a ~~sultry~~ salty look from the corner of her eye


&gt;ERROR: DOES NOT COMPUTE


&gt;”Yuh want mamma tuh give yerr a lick, mamma lykes um sweet, teehee!”


&gt;WARNING: ALARM ACTIVATED


&gt;WARNING: GAG REFLEX ACTIVATED


&gt;Lardquisha advances towards her prey, homing in like a giant, wet, nuclear missile: Fat~~boy~~gurl


&gt;Every corner of my mind is sent into a flurry, all defense systems activated, yet I’m frozen in place


&gt;[MFW]( http://25.media.tumblr.com/b66ec9b06af17fecfdad888758059809/tumblr_mkym0jiuer1ru442eo1_500.gif) Lardquisha’s (processed) meat hooks are now inches from my vulnerable neck, oh god the hambeast is going to taste me


&gt;Be scared that any way of saying no to the ~~ham~~sexbeast’s proposition will be met with a slow and terrible death, what to do!?


&gt;Pray to the old gods and the new to show me a way out. Alas! My prayers are in vain


&gt;Autopilot takes over, my primal survival instincts kick and I utter the one thing I have left, the one possible defense I have at my disposal


&gt;An unrecognizable, deadpan voice emanates from my mouth:
&gt;”Bitch, I’m gay.” 


&gt;…


&gt;*wheeze wheeze*


&gt;…


&gt;ohmygerrdwhatdidijustsay.jpg


&gt;An awful pause fills the entire store, I feel by coworker’s eyes on my back. T’s whimpering has suddenly ceased


&gt;The physical constants of the universe break, apparent to me because the unthinkable has happened: Lardquisha is at a loss for words! Until:


&gt;”Aw he-YEEEEEEEELLLLLL-nerr!” exclaims Lardquisha

&gt;She turns on her tiny heel faster than I would’ve thought possible. For one glorious second, her rolls become disks of pudge, perfectly parallel to the each other and to the very floor, subject for an instant to rotational inertia, assuring me that the physical constants have returned


&gt;I breathe a sigh of relief, it worked, the hambeast is backing off. Or is she?


&gt;Psssssst


&gt;The sound of a two liter of purpul drank being opened sounds through store. Dafuq?


&gt;The hambeast thirsts, its hooks squeeze the bottle shooting the sugary shit water down her maw, the only sound now is a despicable liquid sound of purpul drank dropping down the hambeast’s gullet


&gt;Appeasing one bodily requirement, she turns to me again, unhinging her jaw for round two of beratement


&gt;”OH AH SEE HOW IT IS! YA ONE UH DEM MUFUCKIN’ ERBOBININATIONS (translation English to Ratchet: abominations). BUT DON’ BE TRIPPIN’ **AH** KNOW HA TERR FIX YO PROBLEM, STEP WUN GIT DEM COCKS OUT YO MOUTH STEP TERR GIT DEM COCKS OUT YOU AY-USS AND STEP MUFUCKIN’ THREE—“


&gt;The hambeast’s instructions for turning me into a non-abomination were cut short (and just when I was gaining hope that I finally found someone to solve my gayness!) by a massive, titanic sized belch


&gt;The resonance frequency at one point during the Great Deflate matched the florescent light tubes above, causing them to rattle ever so gently


&gt;Lardquisha, being a matter of feet from face, exhaled the rest of the vile gas directly into my nose, whereupon my knees finally buckled and I laid my forehead on the cool metal that was top of my trolley


&gt;This is where I die


&gt;[MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7fe0zghDz1rrv726.gif)


And that was how I stayed for the rest of my metaphorical lashing. The specifics of said lashing were largely lost to me, not only because they were largely unintelligible, but because I was barely conscious. The take away points from said lashing were as follows:

* The fact that I was gay was a choice, likely due to the fact that I’d never been with a real, curvy woman like Lardquisha.

* Yes, you read correctly, there was an interlude where she tried again to get in my pants after insulting every fiber of my being and belching in my face.

*  What I was was an abomination, whilst she was all real, all natural—just the way Gawd made her!

The irony that hung in the air during the latter-most statement was thicker than the purpul drank stank/~~flab roll~~ curves odor that hung in my aisle for hours afterword, refusing to dissipate.

At some point, Lardquisha left the store and we never saw flabby hide nor fake, Kool Aid dyed hair of the beast ever again. But all was not bleak, T came to me immediately with a hug telling me I was great regardless of my sexual preference and that we could recover from Lardquisha’s reign of terror together.

Another coworker, who we’ll call Guitar Hero Bro (or GHB), a recurring character in my main FPS tale that has yet to be written, told me we were still cool and the three of us went on to be excellent friends.

You see, my dearest Redditors and fellow beetus warriors, the Lardquisha incident was a turning point in my life. After the acceptance of T, GHB, and the rest of my coworkers, I gained the courage to come out to my family and my other acquaintances, and have since felt the weight of a thousand Lardquishas lifted off my chest.

After all was said and done, it turned out that Lardquisha wasn’t such a villain after all, neither was she my hero. She was a ratchet guardian, a pig eyed offender, a dark plight!

(I am not whoring for comfort/attention, the coming out is a side story to one of the most magnificent hambeasts I have ever laid eyes on) 

TL;DR Lardquisha confronts me, insults me, I slip up and compliment her. She hits on me, I blurt out a secret, she berates me, lets out a belch that is still today a universal record in size and volume, yells some more and leaves. I turn out the better for it.

I hope this conclusion appeases the hams that be. A teaser for you all, I have a draft of the worst/best FPS ever told on Reddit about ready to go and I’d like to share the title of part 1 with you now: “Muh Muh’s Odyssey Part 1: Muh Muh’s Entrance”

As a gay man (and a fat man) the comparison just makes me so angry I can barely stay coherent. Yes, there is discrimination against fat people, but even if we accept the argument that being fat is not a choice, that's still no excuse to compare it to the much worse discrimination that LGBT people continue to experience.

What's worse is that apparently now that DOMA and Prop 8 are gone, apparently now gay people should stop fighting for their own equality - and fight for fat equality?

Name me a place where being fat can get you executed. Or the states where fat people can't marry thin people. Or the federal benefits denied to fat people.

They can't do that, but if I'd posted that as a comment on the web page, brick wall of fatlogic would have met me.

After pointing out this /r to some friends, they told me I should post about this guy we know, who we shall call Big C.  Some of this I heard second hand, but had it confirmed by Big Chris and people who know him much better than me.

God that brought back painful beetusy memories. Fortunately these are the only two real experiences I've had with fat logic, but this one was the worst by far.

My background for context: this was when I first graduated college. I was 23, and couldn't find a job so I started working at a shitty restaurant. I swam in college so I was in good shape, and I always watch what I eat anyway. I was 6'1'', 190lbs, ~12% bodyfat.

&gt;break up with gf, feelsbadman.jpg

&gt;because of this and other issues have no appetite anymore, drop down to 175 lbs

&gt;not bad I guess

&gt;have to work mornings with hamplanet everyday

&gt;morbidly obese hamplanet, 5'7'', probably around 300lbs I have no idea, and goes tanning every day (I live in NJ, think a fat version of Snooki)

&gt;whalelephant always complaining about how shes overweight

&gt;complains she has to stand all day (shes a waitress)

&gt;never gets good tips because she treats the customers like shit

&gt;have seen her eating from customers' leftovers multiple times

&gt;meanwhile she scarfs free onion rings from the kitchen EVERY SINGLE DAY, and drowns them in russian dressing

&gt;does this while profusely sweating and panting horribly

&gt;she claims shes on a diet and that fridays are her cheat day, during which she eats:

&gt;wait for it

&gt;russian dressing soup with onion ring croutons

&gt;[mfw I try to make sense of this](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qnfegEUD1rc2gc6o1_400.gif)

she comes in one day and realizes how much weight I've lost and how depressed I look

&gt;""here, have some of my onion rings,"" she says while stuffing her face

I decline, shes had her filthy greasy hands in the pile of disgusting gloop already

&gt;""cmon have some, you're too skinny anyway, get some meat on them bones""

No, I don't want your onion rings. I'm not hungry/on a diet/ don't like them etc.

Got into a little bit of trouble for that, but couldn't help it.

Fatty in wheelchair for weeks, I get into grad school and quit. Haven't eaten an onion ring since 2011. I wish that was a joke, I used to love them.

Cast:

CollegeBro(CB): Best friend, athlete, roommate

So let's skip ahead to the party at the girls house we were invited to in [part1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1iwkou/kimmy_gobbler_in_the_meaty_meeting/). You can also find the delicious filling of part 2 right here:[part2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ixhwt/kimmy_gobbler_in_the_fatty_filler/).

Now you all recall FitGirl who we meet in part 2. Well by the end of the week, after talking to Scarlett during our one class we have together, I find out that she really wants CB. Apparently they were getting lunch everyday and they just really hit it off. So, the night of the party approaches.

&gt;shower, shave, dress

&gt;head downstairs to wait for the other 3

&gt;Arty bouncing downstairs with that staple smile

&gt;TE behind him rolling something in a bag

&gt;ohTruEnt.jpg

&gt;CB comes out looking like an Adonis

&gt;”ready to go boys?” he says with that shit eating grin of his

&gt;arrive at girls front door

&gt;music blasting so damn loud!

&gt;FitGirl opens the door and gives us all a hug and invites us in

&gt;manthisplaceisfuckinghuge.mp3

It was. They shared the house between 6-7 girls and only two of them had to share a room.

&gt;realize that this place is packed

&gt;people all over the place having fun and dancing

&gt;FitGirl tells us to go have fun and pulls CB to dance

&gt;CB looks at me with that grin

&gt;wink at my bro

&gt;stillmyniggah.rar

&gt;walk around with Arty saying hi to people I know

&gt;TE is off with his friends

&gt;Arty stops to talk with his art friends

&gt;decide to get myself a drink

&gt;datrumandcoke.exe

Now, going into the kitchen *seemed* safe. Little did I realize that KG spends most of her time at home in the kitchen.

&gt;the sky darkens

&gt;spontaneous thunderstorms

&gt;flying pigs

&gt;oh wait it's just KG with *little* wings worn on her back

&gt;or was it her front? Can't tell she's so round

&gt;she's dressed in the lowest cut top her curhhves could squeeze into

&gt;high heels that were bigger than my face

&gt;she sees me

&gt;fuck.fuck

&gt;charges at me into a crusty, smelly, and slimy hug

&gt;i could tell she had been dancing from all the sweat

&gt;that or standing and walking is tough

&gt;”WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LUCIST?! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO SHOW UP SINCE FOREVER! COME ON LET'S DANCE CUTIE”

&gt;she seemed pretty plastered

&gt;nope, just want to get my drink and sit down like a good beta

&gt;tell her this

&gt;”OH YOU'RE NO FUN! I GUESS I'M TOO WOMAN FOR YOU! BET YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SCARLETT! DON'T TELL HER I TOLD YOU THIS BUT SHE'S SUCH A SLUT. I SAW HER GRINDING WITH ALMOST EVERY GUY HERE! I EVEN SAW HER DANCING WITH CB.”

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/huh.gif )

Now I know what she said was obviously a lie. I mean, I came in with CB 5 minutes ago and the first thing he did was go off to dance with FitGirl. But, thinking about how attractive Scarlett is, I wouldn't be surprised if every guy wanted to dance with her.

She ~~runs~~ rolls off and I watch her majestically shake her horse sized rump onto 3 guys on her way to the living room; Arty included, who just laughed it off and went along with it for a few seconds before she started grabbing his legs from between hers. She showed a lot of flexibility for someone with a fupa she could fit her snacks into.

&gt;mix my drink take a sip and head to sit on one of the couches

NOW I KNOW! You're all kicking yourselves and probably hating me because I'm such a horrible beta. “TALK TO SCARLETT” “FIND SCARLETT” I know =/. Don't worry your cheesy fat saturated souls because some divine intervention had done the work of finding her for me.

&gt;'twas dark and loud

&gt;bumped into about 8 couples dancing before I could reach one of the couches with an empty seat

&gt;sit down

&gt;man where the hell is Scarlett, I just wanna see her and say hi atleast

&gt;”Hey Lucist!” voice of an angel

&gt;look to my left

&gt;she'ssittingrightthere.iso

&gt;notice she's drinking as well

&gt;ask her what's she doing drinking by herself at her own party

&gt;she laughs and says it's really loud and she's feeling pretty lightheaded from the shots she took with FitGirl

&gt;tell her this is my first drink and I get pretty lightheaded to

Now, since it was really loud, I was trying to move closer to her because I really couldn't hear her. I noticed that she was slowly moving towards me to.

Then. It happened.

&gt;”WHEEEEEEEEEE!”

&gt;magnitude 8 earthquakes

&gt;house breaks and everyone dies

&gt;jk it's worse

&gt;before I knew what happened a cannonball hits the center of the couch

&gt;i get shot up into earths orbit because of the force exerted from it's rear landing on the couch

&gt;[mfw](http://24.media.tumblr.com/b47e5588f5c20bc3269fb0af951ff7af/tumblr_mmxdueiOtR1rjhpb3o1_r2_400.gif ) I realize i'm getting pulled back to the ground because of it's gravitational force

&gt;suffer from serious whiplash

&gt;”SO YA MUST BEH LUCIST! KG TALKS ABOUT YA AND HER BEING IN LOVE ALL THE TIME!”

&gt;I was distracted by the smell and the 2tons of force exerted on my body to respond with something more than a “Wah?”

&gt;”WHAT A CUTIE! I WISH I HAD SOME BROWN SUGAR LIKE YOU IN MY LIFE TEE^HEE”

&gt;wtfisitwiththesebrowncomments.avi

I finally get a glimpse at the planet that almost took my life. See, at first, I thought it was KG back for some more “Color” in her life. I was surprised to see my second hamplanet. She was 3/4s the size of KG but had a much rounder face and I'm pretty sure her nose was shaped like a garlic knot. Probably coated in just as much oil and grease as well.

&gt;I desperately look at Scarlett for some assistance because this planet wouldn't let me leave it's orbit

&gt;the couch has literally BENT down the middle

&gt;Scarlett looks like she's had one too many drinks

&gt;looks at me sadly and says she's going to go find FitGirl

&gt;[mfw](http://replygif.net/i/621.gif ) I realize that she might think I'm actually interested or even having a thing with KG

&gt;finds out the cock block of a planets name is Stephanie Hammer(Full House everyday)

&gt;give a nice beta greeting and proceed to leave

&gt;wondering how much damage to my neck she's caused

&gt;probably less than the couch

At this point I was extremely scared that I messed up things with Scarlett permanently. From previous interactions with Scarlett during the week I found out that she's the one roommate who has to share a room with someone. Can you all guess who that person is? Yup, it's KG. Over the week, KG has been nothing but the worst sort of roommate to Scarlett. Leaving her smelly underwear on the floor, food wrappers all over the place, playing music(KPOP!) at all times of the day. She even caught her sitting on Scarlett's bed naked after KG took a shower. So I'm assuming Scarlett feels bad that she was bitching to me about her roommate who she now thinks I like.

&gt;look for Scarlett everywhere

&gt;ask FitGirl who I see holding hands with CB in the kitchen making themselves drinks

&gt;she says she didn't see her

&gt;give up because beta and make more to drink

&gt;and more

&gt;and more

&gt;stopme.7z

At this point I was beyond gone. I only remembered small tidbits of what happened in the short while of my drunken stupor but Arty and CB had almost everything that happened to me stuck in their minds forever.

This is what they told me

&gt;I danced with almost every girl there

&gt;notexactlywhatyouthink.mp4

&gt;i danced like a drunken fool

&gt;it shouldn't even be called dancing because I was just writhing there while the girls felt awkward

&gt;almost puked up a lung in the girls toilet

&gt;stuck my finger in between two people making out outside

&gt;right in-between their tongues

&gt;wtfiswrongwithme.yolo

&gt;and then

&gt;then I danced with KG and SH

&gt;it was the biggest sandwich in the world according to CB

&gt;he said it like watching two 250-300lbs sesame buns close in on a brown hamburger

&gt;thatkidiscolorfulwithhiswords.zip

From here on I remember what happened clearly. Hold on to your Jimmies. This is a rustler.

&gt;feel something pull me

&gt;go with because I'm still so wasted

&gt;pulls me upstairs

&gt;into a room

&gt;oh good, maybe CB is taken my drunken ass to sleep

&gt;see two beds floral patterns on one, one direction faces on the other

&gt;this... this isn't my room

&gt;get shoved pretty hard onto the one direction bed

&gt;ohlookit'sliam.jpeg

&gt;feel the life getting sucked out of me as something heavy falls on me

Now, I get seriously panicky. I have a problem with personal space when it comes to NOT KNOWING WHERE THE FUCK I AM.

&gt;freak out, try to wriggle free

&gt;I can't lift more than 190 lbs in a drunken state. I've tried

&gt;feel my sweat trickle down my neck

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/face.gif ) it's not my sweat. It's her greasy saliva

&gt;nopls.goop

&gt;she's licking my neck

&gt;like i'm food

&gt;yell CB's name

&gt;yell Arty

&gt;yell Scarlett

&gt;”HAH YOU'RE SUCH A TEASER LUCIST. DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T WANT ME, YOU DANCED WITH ME AND SH DIDN'T YOU?”

&gt;stop this, I don't like you 

&gt;”OH WHY? YOU LIKE THAT BONEY GINGER DON'T YOU? EVEN AFTER I TOLD YOU SHE WAS SUCH A SLUT AND FUCKED ALMOST EVERY GUY HERE”

She was delusional. Her story wasn't even concrete. Fatlogic.

&gt;she starts reaching down

&gt;tugs at my belt buckle

&gt;FUUUUUUUCKKKKKKTHIIIIIS.MP1000

&gt;with all the strength of Zeus I shove her to the side

&gt;she rolls onto the floor and seriously can't get up

&gt;half drunk half a ball you see

&gt;proceed to stumble my way to the door

&gt;open the door

&gt;Scarlett was outside

&gt;[mfw](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_ODcECzxGQ/T4sMKffGa8I/AAAAAAAAA88/LnQ8Dvynqbg/s1600/michael-scott-no.gif )

&gt;sees KG on the floor with half her clothes off trying to roll herself onto her legs

&gt;sees my belt buckle half open

&gt;says a quick sorry and turns around and heads downstairs

&gt;try to follow but I'm so drunk I trip down the stairs

&gt;CB and Arty find me and take me home

&gt;sleep. Glorious sleep.

&gt;next day wake up in a drunken stupor

&gt;need water. Bad

&gt;see TE eating breakfast

&gt;asks me how I'm feeling

&gt;i realized that no one realizes what happened to me yet

&gt;TE tells me that after I fell down the stairs FitGirl had to go find Scarlett who seemed really upset and told CB that I was done for the night and to take me home

&gt;he also tells me that they found KG and SH in KG's room

&gt;apparently KG was too drunk to pick herself up

&gt;she texted SH to get up there and help her “quietly”

&gt;TE heard the grunts upstairs and being the perv wanted to creep a bit

&gt;[hfw](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Grossed-Out-Ew-Reaction-Gif.gif ) he sees SH trying to pull KG up off the floor

&gt;tells me he saw brown spots on SH short shorts

&gt;darker then the color of my skin

&gt;relative justice? 

I hope your jimmies got what they wanted. I told you this was a russtler and OP delivers. Now, before you start. It wasn't actually rape. It was bad I know, but I didn't think about telling anyone other than CB. CB agreed not to tell anyone and it'll die out. He also said to avoid the girls house for a couple of days. CB agreed to have my back when it came to sorting things out with Scarlett. Anyways this is all in the past, so I know I was dumb for not telling anyone, but #betayolo.

Till the next part, kids

This is going to be a massive series I'm thinking. KG has so much ~~curhves~~ content.

Holy shit this ones long.

I love reading your comments guys so keep them coming :)

1366825642.0	1d0u2g	Bar Blubbernought Bitches like a Boss	BahamutWings	400	73	81	"OK, since it's a fat thread it seems the done thing to ""confess your sins"". I'm a Big Guy. 6""6 tall (197cm) and weigh 24 stone (330lbs, or 150 kg). Alot of this is muscle, i cycle everywhere, play rugby and american football. Yeah theres deffo a ""fat pad"" and i aint ""sculpted"" but i know my way around a gym and alot of the power is in my thighs at 32 inch circumference, i bench 240lbs, and squat 500lbs. Seriously, my friends call me wookie. I've earned it.


Now this story is from my days of bar work, I worked on the bar, and was the general go to guy for shifting piles of shit. This is at a successful Students Union night club, so when i say shift shit, i mean a Ton of vodka in cases from delivery point to cellar on my own. I get shit done. 4 cases per trip, or a 160lb barrel on each shoulder.


From here i hope you take 2 things: 1: I am big, slightly fat, but am mostly muscle. 2: I work fucking hard with what i got, a work ethic that puts most to shame.


3 years ago the bosses decide that we no longer have different types of staff. We used to have Front of House guys (tickets and cloakroom), Bar guys and Bar Support (glass collectors and shift shit guys, this is me). Upshot of this is good, team works better together, and if someone is injured etc they can do a sitdown job on front of house. Shifts get shared and swapped better too. I loved this, i got to work on the bar (eventually made it to supervisor).


Now, one person we gained from Front of House was a (to use the local term, when in Rome) a Hamplanet, a Blubbernought, a veritable sphere of 5 foot nothing and 280lbs. Now, in a busy bar you can afford a little dead weight, but she was more than a little. Now, here's where the plot thickens, her girlfriend is the Supervisor. FML.


Fast Forward 3 months of summer and its now freshers week. The busiest time of the year. We're talking 12 events in 2 weeks, each sells out 2000 tickets. Shit just got Real. Everyone is on for 9 shifts, i pick up 3 of hers, money is money.


What follows is all true, and how she got fired. I will only cover what we worked together.


Shift 1: I'm on Bar, she pulls front of house. Evening is success. At the end of the shift, boss man tells us to take all the leftover booze (6 crates) from small portable bar i've manned solo all night to the cellar so it can be locked up. I hoist up 4 crrates and say ""hey, do you mind getting the other 2?"" She looks at me like i just spat in her face. ""i cant lift heavy things, because my knees are bad"". Yeah, because they're allready carrying your lard arse. I retort ""im just as big and my knees are fine"". She opens maw to respond, thinks better of it and just vaguley waves a cloth over the bar pretending to clean. I take all the crates back and think no more of it.


Shift 2: I draw shift shit duty (bars not connected to the cellar need almost constant restocking) and she pulls Bar. With about an hour left it gets quiet, and i start taking loads to bars with lockable cupboards behind them to make sure shits stocked for the next day. I Do this by hand as faffing with a trolly thing is slower for me. I see the bar is quiet and ask her to help me out: "" i told you yesterday, mah knees"". ""Get a trolley, pack it with VK (sugary alcopop) and lets get going to Mezz(anine) Bar"". Frumpyface. Tells GF. GF tells her to use trolley. I move 3/4 of the shit to all the other bars, she does some token trolley runs interspersed with swigging of drink, munching on sweets, and trying to subtley make out with GF behind bar.


Shift 3: We both pull Bar duty on the main bar. This will be interesting. I do my usual running about like a blue arsed fly routine, make 3rd highest takings of the night. She does this wierd ""serve some people, then pretend do stock up/clean in the cellar"" routine. Now, we all take the odd 5/10 minutes in the longer 6+ hour shifts, generally to scoff some sugar to keep going and catch a fag (cigarette to my transatlantic cousins). But she set a record. In the 7 hour shift she spent only 4 hours on the bar. Shift ends, no drama, i get on with it.


Shift 4, the Blubbering: Both on Bar again, but she berates the top boss because ""her knees"" . . . ""her back"" . . . ""She cant be expected to work this much physically"". So Boss swaps her to cloakroom. Salvation.jpeg. We got Adam in return. Adam was 36 years old, lovely guy from Africa (country forgotten). He was older than the bosses but that guy is awesome, he gets shit done. We get put on the same till and took the most for the night. But unfortunately disaster struck with an hour to go. We were joking about when all of a sudden he turns around and full on goes OVER the Blubbernought. She'd sneaked to the bar after persuading someone she needed a break from sitting on her ass and come over to make out for a minute in the cellar with GF. Adam landed badly and twisted his ankle. Refused to go home, and hobbled to cloakroom to finish there. That meant i got Blubberlicious on my till. Piloting around the Death Star aint got nothing on the moves i had to pull to reach around her to get my shit done. At one point she was stood infront of the till chatting to a friend and i ask her to move. Evilstare.initiate(); She says ""you're always on my back about me because i'm fat, we should be looking out for each other."" erm. WHUT?! Look, im big, but i can see my feet and could bench press her. I just say ""look i got work to do"" and she mutters and flees to GF.Supervisor. I think nothing of it. Top bar taker on Freshers gets some free gig tickets for later in the year.


Shift 5, the reckoning: I get to work 20 mins early, standard for me. I get on getting shit ready. Boss sees me early as usual ""BahamutWings mate, i need to see you in the office."" Okeydokes, i think, probably has a delivery he wants me to deal with.

NOPE.

""BlubberTits the Vast came to me after last nights shift and says you've been bullying her all freshers about her weight.""

Erm, ok, i think back. SHITBALLS. She never replied to my snarkier comments. She was storing ammo.

""She says you call her lazy for not shifting stock and taking breaks""

Sure i may have said ""oh get on with it"" but nothing thats really offensive or anything.

""She wants a written apology from you""

I have covered this bitches shifts, i have tried to be nice. RAGEMODE.ENGAGE();

""Well, i did ask her to do some lifting.""

""We all know shes only good at lifting cakes BahamutWings"" - Winning. Boss kows the score. He knows she's a bitch, but his hands are tied, In the Students Union shit like this can get real real fast if someone screams ""Discrimination"".

""I get you Boss, i'll do it now."" So i write this BlubberBall an apology, usual, ""sorry, didn't know my fault etc etc etc."" I hand it to her when she arrives 15 minutes late. 

A snatch and a snappy ""thanks"" later i go get on with my shift moving shit. She gets her Front of House on arse ticket selling stint.

2 hours later im called to the office to cover her so she can take a break. Fair play, people gotta piss. 30 minutes later im still there, boss man comes in:

""Wheres Butternought?""

""Still on break""

""Shes been 30 minutes""

""I know""

""fuck sake""

""Told you she was lazy""

*Solemn Nod of Solemness*

Boss gets on the radio to find out where the fuck she is. Guess where? in cellar with GF having around of tonsil hockey. Boss drags her ass back. Get venomous stare from her ""You grassed me up"". ""Whatevs"". I get back to hauling the universe of beer around the building.


Shift 6 The Finale of Fat encrusted Fuggliness: BlubberBalls GF calls in sick, genuine call in, was loking like shit last 2 shifts. I get put up to being supervisor due to knowing my shit like Barrell Changes and Till Filling/Cashing up. (I was promoted 2 months later after GF of blubberball quit: short story of why she quit: i fucked her Ex GF and she resigned citing ""personal Reasons""). I get all my shit done to be ready to open. Staff are all her, oh wait, one short. Go down roster, even Adams in with his ankle strapped up, MIA is Blubberbutt the Balloon. Fuck it, i turn to the team to give the pre shitstorm pep talk: ""right guys, last event, its gonna be mental, im supervising tonight so someone else will get them gig tickets. *get chuckle*. BtB is missing, so i'd appreciate full effort tonight, lets get shit done"". BtB walks in. She heard me give the talk, cue explosion of GreaseFurah.

""I HEARD THAT, THAT WAS DEROGATORY, YOURE FATTIST""

Fuckthisshit.EngageFury();

""Yeah, by about 4 stone, but at least i work hard, arrive on time and have record breaking takings to my name, WTF have you done?""

She Does this sort of run out. Tears flooding down her face.

Feels good man.


Boss approaches me an hour later.


""Guess what happened in my office just now?""

FUCK IT ALL.

""Well BtB probably put in another complaint""

""nope. she quit. and shes suing the Students Union for discrimination""

Fuck all the FatLogic.

""Fine"" i deadpan.

Boss looks a little surprised.

""if shes gonna try and sue, i'll hand my notice in. problem solved""

Bosses face sinks, i dont care right now, im sick of her shit.

""oh, ok"".

And that is how i lost my Bar Job.

""but you said you got to Bar Supervisor?"" i hear some of the more astute amongst you say.

Yeah i did. 

Her discrimination case went before the powers that be at the Students Union. She basically said i lead a campaign of bullying based on  her weight.  Union agree with my resigning as the end of it.

I enjoyed my fat paycheque from Freshers work and lived a pretty good life about town for a bit. Then shitstorm happened. I fuck Blubbernoughts GFs Ex. Blubbernoughts GF at work starts a smear campaign of how i have ruined her life and blubbernoughts. Boss calls her in. She resigns, i get her old job. 

Fat justice just tastes so damned good.


I realise this was a long one, but id rather give you guys the lot and not in a few shitty parts, especially when all related.

I know its not a great anti fat post, but fuck it, its here cos shes fat or on another  subreddit with less liveliness. And you guys have provided me wiht many lulz over the lsat few days at work.

So until the next BlubberBeast approaches and i get more to tell, Adios, Farewell, Au Revoir, best of health, and keep posting. God love you all."	t5_2vzax	True

1374912900.0	1j5h57	The Time Fat Logic ruined a families 4th of July.	Drunken_Black_Belt	386	64	59	"Ok FPS, I can't believe I forgot this.  My first run in with Fat Logic, long before I knew what Fat Logic was.  

So if some of you have read my stories in other threads, you know I've worked mostly Loss Prevention and Security jobs in my life.  Two of those jobs were at theme parks.  One a large corporate chain, and the other a smaller family friendly park.  

That park was never too bad.  Only one or two big rides, so not so many douche nozzles plauging the park.  We did get our fair share of troublemakers.  Drunks.  Smokers who wouldn't stay in designated areas.  People hopping off rides. Etc.  But mostly it was a pretty easy going place.  The food wasn't anything special, but the soda was free, and the guest always appreciated that. Add to that a pretty decent water park and friendly co workers, and I usually didn't dread going into work.

Anyways, on the 4th of july I lucked out and pulled Medical Escort duty.  This was pretty simple.  You sat in the Aid Station with the EMT's, soaking in the A/C, giving bandaids and such.  If a call for an EMT came through, then you'd escort them through the park, and perform crowd control while they did their thing.  It was also where you brought lost kids, and that's where 90% of our time was devoted to.  Plus it meant I got to sit and watch the fire works display the park put on, without having to do guard duties during the show.

So I'm sitting in the office, playing a card game with one of the EMT's, when a call comes over the radio.  ( For the sake of easier writing, and making it understanable, I'll dispose of the 10 codes.  10 codes are stuff like 10-4 and 10-20 you hear people saying over walkies a lot).

Park Employee:  Hey guys this is the Supervisor for the North section. We got a guest here whose complaining of feeling light headed and naseuas. She is short of breath and having a hard time standing, even in the shade.

EMT: Ok we are on the way there.

We begin our walk over, and after a minute the Park Employee calls back and says the woman has passed out.  We quicken our pace a bit (you never run because it tends to make people follow you to see what's going on).  We reach the location of the call, and I see a very large woman laying on the ground, attempting to sit up unsuccesfully. She's bellowing to her children to help pull her up, but no child would dare risk being sucked into the lost forrest of fat rolls, never to be seen again.  I don't know how tall she is, but this woman's girth was Honey Boo Boo's mother plus 50 lbs.

We help the woman sit up and move her to the shade.  She's slightly dilerious and slow to answer.  It was probabvly about 90 degrees that day, and people were feeling the heat.  We are trying to ask the woman basic medical questions, but she's having a hard time answering. Her children are no use either.  They kept butting in asking if they could go ride the Pirate ship ride.  Their logic?  ""It's right next to here and we can come right back""  Great kids.

Eventually we get enough out of the woman to learn she's diabetic.  She claims she hasn't eaten all day, but one of the kids refutes this, stating she had had several pizza slices at lunch, and they had all gotten orders of fried oreos.  The EMT asks her where he testing equipment and insulin are located.  She says they are in the car.  The car that is at least a 5 minute walk for an in shape person.  Then, the single stupidest thing I've ever heard came out of this Planet's mouth.

""I don't understand.  Sure I had some food, but it's a day out, gotta treat myself. Besides I've been drinking plenty to stay hydrated.""

EMT:  How many cups of water would you say you've had since you entered the park today?

Planet:  Water?  No, I've had probably 3 or 4 cups of soda every hours since we've ben here.

EMT: Soda?  Why would you be drinking soda if you're diabetic?

Planet: Well, it's free. 

Yup....I don't think the EMT knew what the term ""Rustled Jimmies"" was, but I assure you it's the only appropriate term.  We ended up getting an (extra large) wheel chair, and bringing her back to the AID station. I'm not an expert on Beetus, but the EMT gave her a blood test and ended up sending her to the hospital. Despite her protest.  Her blood sugar was dangerously high.  She didn't want to leave because she had ""paid good money to be here"", and because ""we were ruining the holiday for her kids.""  We sent her on her way with the ambulance, and waited with the kids till the father got there to pick them up. I felt bad the kids didn't get to see fireworks and spent the night at the hospital instead, but I couldn't blame anyone but HBBPlanet"	t5_2vzax	True

**Flabpotamus Part VII:  Comeuppance**
 
During Sisterhood Of The Travelling Flabs’ term at our clinic, the pathology company complained that they weren't getting enough patients through, and that they might need to pull their service. This is not a good thing for us, because the doctors want to have someone who can take bloods on site to make their job easier, and it is convenient for patients. The docs had started to notice, however, that patients tended to make excuses to go somewhere else. Most were polite and avoidant, and said that they wanted to go somewhere closer to home, or their nephew's girlfriend worked at suchandsuch and they wanted to support her. Not CrankyDude. He’s an elderly chap who needs to have a blood test every 1-4 weeks to monitor the effects of a blood thinning medication. He continued to come to Simon and Flabfunkel because he lived a 2 minute walk away, couldn't drive, and didn't want to gets taxis to go somewhere else.

Every time CrankyDude had his blood test done by Flab Plastic Trees, he would go to great lengths to explain to us why she was a disgusting, foul human who should not be allowed to work in health care unless she did something about her stench. He even brought in an air purifier his son in law no longer needed, to set up in her room. It improved things for a while then broke. I felt sorry for that machine.
 
He also complained that she was never in her room - as she was usually in the tearoom feeding, trying to molest DoctorBro, or at the desk telling us of her sexual exploits with ChuckBucket.

And, of course, she accused him of fat shaming in some form or another. Because fatlogic.
 
We told him we weren't really in control of what she did, but feel free to ring her company, and gave him their card...

Manager also fed back possible reasons why Osama Bin Flaben was not getting as much business as they’d hoped, and also reports of incidents she’d had with our staff, where she accused them of being discriminatory about her size, despite the reports from the staff in question being contradictory. She gently suggested that maybe Honey Flabger needed some support and counselling regarding her interactions with co-workers.
 
Gone With The Flab then had a performance review in which they told her she had to stay in her cave at all times other than her prescribed 30 minutes for lunch and 15 minutes for morning tea, to which she wailed:
 
&gt;”But it's not long enuff! I need to eat because of my condishuns!”
 
They also went about investigating the source of what was known as 'the moistness'. Apparently, Flabbarabbadingdong had taken a half day at some point and NiceYoungChristian had covered her for the afternoon. She came out to the desk and asked if she could borrow a chair. ""Whatever for?"" they asked. ""Because this one, it is moist,"" she replied.
 
Positively Flab Street had left some sort of mystery liquid on the chair. No one was game to try and wick any up from the chair to perform forensics. There came a whole review process where she had to go and see her own doctor and have a report written about whether this fluid was sweat, urine, or some other atrocity, and whether this posed a biological hazard to her workmates. It was ruled that Flabber Lickin’ Good would be required to either wear a panty shield to protect the upholstery from her unholy excretions, or they would provide a plastic seat cover.
 
Flabberwocky was placed on probation, with the above conditions re: break time and exudate management. She had to attend counselling, and try to curb her outbursts towards us (no great success was noted here). They also had a chat to her about personal hygiene, and to her credit, she did start to smell just a little bit less horrifying over the following months.

Her supervisor asked the reception team to keep an eye on her (as her little abscess of an office was right next to the reception area), and log her comings and goings, to help her keep on track with breaks etc. We took this on with enthusiasm; coworker1 even brought in a stopwatch to time her breaks.

Of course, her condishuns led her to stray from her corpuscle more than was permitted. We just logged it and fed back to her supervisor like good little drones.
 
CrankyDude continued to file his complaints. It seemed that Mrs Flabinson's massive girth was impeding her ability to do her job. Her fat sausage fingers were becoming increasingly less dextrous for tasks involved in blood taking. (ThinPrivilege is being able to employ fine motor skills.) Also her job required her to stand, or sit on a stool, and lean towards a patient to be able to see find veins properly. Her abundant abdominal adiposity was preventing her from doing this safely, and CrankyDude would (with strange pride) show us his bruises after her molestation of his veins.
 
She tried to file a worker's compensation case, claiming that her job was so boring (because she scared away potential customers) that she was forced to eat, thus gaining weight and being unable to perform her job. It was not accepted.
 
The patients’ repeated complaints, along with Flablander’s inability to stick to her allotted feeding period (she started snacking in her room even more and the bin was frequently overflowing with wrappers and other fatperson detritus) eventually led to the downfall of Flablah Khan's kingdom. 

I think she was given an admin job at the pathology company, as they decided it was not suitable for her to work in a confined space, performing skills that she was not physically capable of.

I feel kind of bad for her. There was obviously some sort of emotional problem driving her eating, a problem I’m all too familiar with. Her behaviour may have been caused by a deep insecurity and inability to control her surroundings and herself, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some sort of traumatic root to her issues. With that sobering note, I don’t see why she had to be such a fucking bitch about it, and certainly life was much easier without her around. I hope she eventually got help though. I had to get help for my eating problems because they might have killed me, and I think people who habitually overeat themselves to an early grave need help as well.

But, hey, then there’d be no FPS, and I really have enjoyed telling this tale!
 
Star Trek: The Flab Generation was replaced by a really quite pleasant person, who came in, did her job, participated in normal superficial conversation and pleasantries, and never tried to condemn or seduce any of our employees. We all lived happily ever after, jimmies firmly back in their jimmy holders, beetus quenched and soothed.
 
 **TL;DR  Despite support and patience from her employers, Sponge Flab Square Pants proves herself to be unsuitable for her position. She is removed from our vicinity and replaced with a normal person. Happiness ensues. **

1370541102.0	1fsyrq	Dawn of the Dead Lift		412	90	122	"Alright my lovelies, I promised rustled jimmies, and rustled jimmies so shall I deliver. But first, some back story unless you scoured the wonderful comments I got on my last story. 

First of all, I am a hockey player. I've been a hockey goalie for around 15 years, I'm 20 years old. I'm about 5'5"" and weigh around 118-120. According to calipers, I have 9% body fat, but that was unacceptable to the extraordinarily intelligent people on reddit who know how to work the Google machine, so I got retested this morning before the gym with my team's trainers. 

1. Skinfold Measurement - 9%
2. Bioelectrical impedance analysis-10-11%
3. Height and circumference methods- 11-12%
4. Hydrostatic Testing- 10%

So there, after an arousing game of averages, I'm around 10.5% body fat. So if you don't believe it, well, shut up and drink your beetus. 

However, I am obviously a very big purveyor of the wonderful gym (dem gaiinnnzz) and since it is a commercial gym I have to deal with some obnoxious people from all walks of life. Don't think I don't run into frat bros who have NO idea what they're doing, or bitchy blonde cardio bunnies who give me dirty looks for deadlifting 300 pounds. But this is FPS, so today I introduce to you Hambelina, the mightiest of all jimmie rustlers. 

Cut to green...

&gt;Be in gym with my back up goalie, huge guy, around 6'4"" and 250 pounds of solid muscle and goalie-ness. 

&gt;Be working on squat. PR 275, need moar gainzz! 

&gt;Not really, today is a lazy day. I don't want to lift more than 275 on my shoulders/knees today.

&gt;Decide to do yoga in the mat area, today is a good day to stretch/ work on needles.

&gt;Mats are conveniently located next to cardio area upstairs. 

&gt;Such fun from watching ALL the cardio bunnies. 

&gt;Back up stairs longingly at blonde butts. 

&gt;MFW he has a girlfriend with giant boobs. 

&gt;Notice a few fatties back in the corner and get big smile. lovewhenpeoplewanttoturntheirlivesaround.jpg

Now, this is my first summer back from Uni, where I have been purveying the gym up there, so I haven't been around my home gym in a few years. Things have changed for the worse, and my Back up keeps me updated. 

&gt;""Don't even think about it, realgoaliesmeow."" 

&gt;sadface.png ""Why?"" (I always go talk to new-looking people to ask if they need any help with anything. I even had a really nice guy come up to me my first day there and ask if I needed any help. I have a very welcoming gym, and I like to keep it that way.)

&gt;""Because I've tried before, they don't want anyone to help."" dirtylooklikesatansbutthole.gif

&gt;MFW ""Uh, alright."" And go on about stretching. 

&gt;Finish yoga routine, go get a sweat towel for lifting later.

&gt;Walk behind fatties on the elliptical. 

&gt;MFW there is no resistance or elevation on the machine.

&gt;*shrug* ""Everyone's gotta start somewhere,"" I assure myself.

&gt;hearingsnickers.pdf

&gt;I turn around and see one of them looking at me.

&gt;""I didn't realize yoga worked up such a sweat, maybe you're not that fit after all!"" *guffawing* 

&gt;MFW I wasn't even sweating, and she looked like buckets of melted butter were dumped on her.

&gt;""I- uh, I got it to go lift downstairs."" 

&gt;*snorts* ""Okay, sure, whatever. You're not as fit as you look!""

&gt;*raises eyebrow* ""Uh, okay, sure."" walkawayasfastasmynotfitlegscantakeme.jpg

As a side note, I was raised in a Nordic household, meaning I don't know how to talk to strangers, or deal with strangers talking to me. Half the shock there was the fact that she talked to me in the middle of her ""workout"". So yes, I'm genetically and nurture-ly beta. It's the Finnish way.

&gt;*run over to back up* ""She's so rude!""

&gt;""Yeah, good job genius, I told you not to talk to them."" 

&gt;frownyfaceihatedumbbitches.gif goesdownstairstoliftoutanger.jpg

&gt;I decide on some leg machines, gotta keep flexibility and leg muscles for blocking dem pucks yo. 

&gt;See fatty fat fat and her fat brigade tromping down the stairs. 

&gt;Already used to the sound, it's just slightly louder than roided out gym bros tromping up and down the stairs.

&gt;Make a dirty face at them, I hate rude people. 

&gt;Start the hip abductor machine, so bad at it in relation to other machines. I prefer free weights, but this machine works the inside of your thighs, which most people really could benefit from doing.

&gt;Queen Hambelina sits next to me on the other machine, makes sneer face at me. 

&gt;MFW she put a Venti Caramel Ribbon Crunch in the cup holder of her machine. 

&gt;I go on about my business even though I have a soy protein shake, and she has a 1500 calorie shit shake next to her. 

&gt;Take a swig of my protein shake

&gt;""You shouldn't drink those."" 

&gt;MFW she would not stop bothering me. 

&gt;""It's my protein shake, and only about 200 calories.""

&gt;""Oh, you're one of those weirdos who counts calories. No guy is going to want to be with you if you fuck up every lunch by counting calories.""

&gt;SO done with this bitch. I have an All-American Lacrosse boyfriend at D-Middie. He counts calories just as much as I do, and then we have sex without having to move various parts of our bodies. Fat bitch. 

&gt;""Well, I actually have a boyfriend--""

&gt;She fucking CUTS ME OFF, ""Oh, I feel bad for him. He must be so tired of you.""

&gt;MRW she has known me for 20 seconds.

&gt;I finish my last rep and leave.

&gt;""By the way, that Starbucks probably isn't helping your fat ass get any better. If you laid off of them, you might not sweat butter when you walk your 15 minutes on the elliptical."" 

&gt;HFW I called her out.

&gt;""Well--I--fuck you!""

&gt;I walk away to the free weights to be with my back-up and hang clean my anger away. I know you all think it wasn't beta and super awesome, but I didn't feel good saying it. I don't like to be mean, but if I'm attacked I will

&gt;Look up and see the Cross fit workout for the day.

&gt;21-15-9 Box jumps, hang cleans and pull ups. 

&gt;Hell yes, motha fukkin cardio lifting. I'm pumped. Nothing makes me angrier working out or in a game than rude people. When players chirp me in a game, I preform the best. 

&gt;Back up grabs all the equipment, we decide to add sit ups too, since we didn't do abs yet today. Get 20 lb weight ball to toss between sit ups. 

&gt;See Fatty fat fat Hambelina go over to the exersize bikes on the other side, facing us in the free weights. 

&gt;MFW if she comes and opens her fat fucking maw at me while I'm crossfit-ing I will cut a bitch in her force field of adipose tissue. 

&gt;She sits on that poor bike and I hear it groan across the floor. She peddles what has to be a mile an hour sipping on that sugary cup of death.

&gt;I make a face. She's literally disgusting, inside and out. 

&gt;Back up starts the timer and we get to work. 

&gt;During the sit ups, I hear her scoff. 

&gt;""Ignore it,"" backup says, ""if you get pissed off it'll mess up our time.""

&gt;MFW he's right. Go on about the 15 crunches to get back to box jumps.

&gt;ORW we're done, 11 minutes flat. I am absolutely dead, laying on the ground, clutching my water bottle for dear life. (For anyone that doesn't know, that means 21 of all those things, then 15 reps of those things, then 9 reps of those things, aka crossfit is the product of satan.)

&gt;""We did good."" fistbumpofgoaliebros.jif

&gt;I roll over and see two fat cankles spilling out of $200 pink Nikes. *looks up*

&gt;I can barely see her stomach past her gigantic gut. She has to be 5'6"" and easily 300 pounds. 

&gt;""You're not even that fit. I could've done that without breaking a sweat. You just jumped around and threw weights.

&gt;Myfuckingfacewhen. 

&gt;""What do you even do? I feel bad if you play a sport, because your team must suck.""

&gt;I actually have no words. She is actually saying these things to me. isthisthereallifeorisitfantasea.mp3

&gt;Back up rolls his eyes, gets huffy. ""She's our goalie, we're hockey players.""

&gt;Fatty McFatfat scoffs, ""That explains it. Goalies don't do anything.""

&gt;And my vision goes black. I start screaming in that weird death whisper your mom always gave you when you were in a public place.

&gt;I grab her by her -sweat- grease soaked tank top that had her fat rolls spilling out all over the place. 

&gt;""Then do it. Race me to do this workout. I bet your fat fucking ass can't even get you up on that box, and if by some miracle of the Fat Gods you do, you'd break it under your massive fat. I'm sorry you think you're making yourself better by mocking me, but you're just setting yourself up to get your ass kicked at ANYTHING in this gym. So perform, or get the FUCK out of my face and my gym.""

&gt;Back up looks shocked. But not as shocked as Hambelina. 

&gt;Her jowls wobble in an attempt to say something back. 

&gt;I growl, ""Exactly. You wouldn't have a hope of beating me at anything. Now get the fuck out of my face and go cry over McDonalds and blog on Tumblr about how you're a despicable person, and the mean fit people kicked you out of the gym.""

&gt;She blushes as everyone closest to us in the weight area looks at her, and turns to run out. 

&gt;I am huffing from the workout and the adrenaline that that took to scream at her. I shake because I can't believe I was so mean. 

&gt;Back up pats me on the back. As we clean up, a gymbro and gymbabe approach us.

&gt;The gymbabe smiles at me. ""Thanks for that. Hopefully she won't come back. She's been picking on the fit girls here for like 5 months."" 

&gt;MFW she's been doing this to others who wouldn't hesitate to kick her ass. 

&gt;I nod to the couple, ""I just don't like when people talk to people at the gym."" 

My jimmies were soothed a few days later when a troope of fatties came in, came right up to the free weights section, and politely asked me and my back up, as well as another gym bro if we could help them with the machines. 

&gt;eyes get all big and sparkly. I help all the ladies, but I never forget the Day of the Deadlift with Queen Fatty McFatfat Hambelina.

So I hope your jimmies are rustled enough! I love all of you! Happy Beetus-ing!

Relevant personal details: female, 5'11"", 130lbs, still a 32D (basically, skinny, but not POW-skinny)
I'm doing my usual grocery shopping, grabbing some lunch meat, corn tortillas (gluten-intolerance), veggies, and a half-gallon each of whole milk and 2%. I'm grabbing some tortilla chips and salsa in the chips/soda aisle when I notice a muumuu-wearing Scooterbeast (estimated 5'5"" 330) and her greasy-skinned, zit-encrusted friend (not quite hambeast territory, 5'3""  200) eyeing me, mumbling, giggling. I keep shopping, looking for the best salsa deal.  
As I draw closer, I start to pick up a few words, "".....eating disorder... puke... bitch...."" They're still staring at me, Scooter's eyes glaring beadily, making no attempt to cover it up. I'm generally non-confrontational, but they're overstepping the bounds of polite society, so I ask Scooterbeat, ""Can I help you?"" as politely as possible. Maybe not that politely, though, because I'm irritated.  
They look at each other. I see the fire of a thousand barbecues alight in Fattie's eyes. She turns to me. ""You shouldn't waste all that food if you're going to throw it up when you get home."" She points to my chips and whole milk. ""Don't fucking tell me you actually eat that stuff."" She and Pizzaface are probably smirking, but between the rolls and the craters, its impossible to be sure.  
At this point, I'm pretty taken aback. I live in a fairly rural area and see fatties of this caliber all the time, but I've never had one be so rude to me. At this point, I inform her that I'm actually trying to gain weight right now, hence the food choices. Wrong choice; she launches into a tirade about how I should just be eating fast food instead of wasting my time with chips and milk.  
At this point, all I can say is, ""I want curves, not rolls.""  
I don't bother waiting for a response, but I see her and Cratersnout glaring at me from checkout. In her scooterbasket: 2 2-liters of Diet Coke, 2 sleeves of Oreos, bag of Doritos, package of mega-muffins."	t5_2vzax	True

I used to work in a home for the developmentally disabled.  One of my residents was a 270 lbish, 5'0"" kid, but he was basically all muscle.  (he did pullups pretty much constantly, and would wear a 40 lb weight vest for comfort)He was mostly nonverbal, and verrrryyyyy aggressive. I took him out to eat one day, as me and him were pretty chill, and he never gave me any problems.  We were at an all you can eat buffet, and I was in the buffet line while he loaded up a plate with delicious steak. Next thing you know, there is a sound like thunder, a dimming of the lights and a feeling of a sudden change in gravity. A hamplanet in their natural habitat! This fat fuck had to be about 5'8"" probably around 480 lbs. Now, the kid I had with me was autistic, and was taking his time looking at the various steaks, trying to decide which ones he wants. As this is happening, Hammy pushes him aside with his massive bulk, so hard it almost knocks the kid to the floor and  says ""move it retard"" and grabs like 4 or 5 steaks to shove down  greasy gullet. I would have hit said hamplanet in the face myself if I didn't know what was about to happen. My mind was caught between ""Oh fuck, I'm gonna lose my job"" ""Dis' gon' be good"" The kid with me loses his shit in the most majestic way I ever seen. He does not like when others touch him, and he lets out a roar that would have made the hulk shit his pants.  And when this guy gets going, there's not much I can do to stop him. (He was allowed on outings with just one person as he hadn't had an incident in over a year)  He proceeds to jump onto the hammy, and headbutts him.  hammy drops to the floor, at which point the kid picks up this hamplanet, an incredible feat of strength I would have sworn was impossible without one of those forklifts they use on the docks. He then throws said hammy a good 3 feet away from the buffet and growls at him.  The hammy starts squealing for the manager to kick us out. At this point, I'm in damage control mode, only to see that the kid has turned back to the steaks and is picking a new one (nowhere near as bad as I thought shit was gonna get) and the manager comes over. Hes looking all angry at us, while the kid is once again caught in the magical world of picking a steak. the hamplanet is screaming ""he attacked me"" and Kick that retard out of here (The kid was autistic, not even intellectually disabled, the correct term for retarded these days). I turn to the manager and say ""That man shoved my kid so hard he almost fell because he couldn't wait in line like a civilized human being, and called him a (Whispereing at this point) ""retard My kid gets pretty upset when people call him that, and he has a condition where he cannot be touched by other people"" Several other people from the buffet had witnessed the whole spectacle, and it turns out that hammy had cut pretty much the whole line, and nobody was dealing with his shit.  The manager asks everyone around what happens, and most of the line agrees that he shoved the kid.  At this point the hammy is asked to leave (though he did get a refund). No steak has ever tasted better than justice steak!  The manager even comped our meals since he felt bad.  

TL,DR: Strong as fuck autistic kid throws hamplanet that shoves him in the buffet line"	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;The XXX Spot is just what it sounds like. They sell dildos of all shapes, sizes and colors…vibrating panties…blow-up dolls…porn dvds…furry handcuffs…etc. Your garden-variety sex shop, really. Only it's huge, so they have…quite a…*large* selection. I've only been in there once, late at night, when I was very, very drunk (but that's another story, tee-hee!)

&gt;""CAN WE GO? A FRIEND OF MINE IS GETTING MARRIED AND I'M GOING TO PLAN HER BACHELORETTE PARTY AND I WANT SOME IDDEEAASSS!""

&gt;I groan. The thought of visiting The XXX Spot with Hammelina makes me gag. I really don't want to hear about her former hamplanet lovers or her rancid lady-grease. Also, I don't want to be roped into spending more money.

&gt;No, I decide. I'm not gonna go.

&gt;I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!

&gt;I'm gonna stand up for myself.

&gt;eyeofthetiger.mp3

&gt;""I'm busy right now,"" I say. ""But you can go if you want. It's not far."" 

&gt;I emerge from my room to give her directions. Candy wrappers, discarded frozen yogurt containers, and empty mini bottles of vodka are everywhere.

&gt;fucking *everywhere*

&gt;I even notice a bar of chocolate melting into my carpet.

&gt;Seriously. 

&gt;Anywho, the XXX Spot is about three blocks away. Totally walkable. I give her directions. 

&gt;""BUT I DON'T HAVE A CAR!""

&gt;""That's okay. It's really not far. Less than a third of a mile, I promise.""

&gt;""BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS!""

&gt;""…but I just gave you directions!""

&gt;""I'M NOT FROM HERE. COME WITH ME, PLEEAAASSEEE. I NEED SOMEONE TO DRIVE ME THERE.""

&gt;I groan. I'm about to tell her to fuck off and pay for a cab…but, once again, I'm too damned nice.

&gt;""Okay. We can go…if you promise to clean up this…mess when we get back.""

&gt;""WHAT? ARE YOU SAYING I'M MESSY?! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D SAY THAT.""

&gt;pokerface.jpg

&gt;""FINE. I'LL CLEAN IT UP. JUST TAKE ME PLEASE!!""

&gt;We go.

&gt;When we arrive, Hammelina bursts out of the car and runs into the shop so fast that I wonder if she sees a goddamned ice cream truck in there.

&gt;I follow. The place looks just like I remembered it. A huge wall of multi-colored dildos to my right. Mannequins with bulging strap-ons to my left. A giant, veiny, two foot dildo right in front of me. I can't tell if this damned thing is meant for actual use…or if it's just a display model. There's also a cuter, tamer-looking area off in the corner specifically for bachelorette-party stuff. Has streamers, dirty cards, dick-shaped balloons. Harmless shit like that.

&gt;""OOHHH MY GAAWWDD!!""

&gt;I look up.

&gt;Hammelina is not checking out the bachelorette party stuff.

&gt;Oh no.

&gt;She's buzzing around the giant dildo like a moth at a lantern

&gt;she's looking it up and down, her eyes shining with glee

&gt;she's almost salivating

&gt;I wonder if she's going to start licking it.

&gt;""HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?!""

&gt;I shake my head. No. No I have not. Nor do I care to.

&gt;""I'D LOVE ONE OF THESE…""

&gt;crawlinginmyskin.mp3

&gt;""OH WELL, I DOUBT I COULD AFFORD IT. TEE-HEE!""

&gt;phew.rar

&gt;She explores the rest of the store. She's more excited than a puppy going for his first walk. I hang out in the bachelorette party area and look at dirty cards. Some of them make me chuckle.

&gt;""BLINKTWICEFORYES!!!""

&gt;her voice is like a cheese grater against my ears

&gt;""COME OVER HERE!!""

&gt;I go see what she wants. Hopefully that'll make this end sooner

&gt;she dangles a long felted rope in front of me. On one end of the rope there's a picture of a svelte (and naked) young blonde, tied up, winking.

&gt;""I'M GONNA GET THIS. GAWD. I JUST LOVE IT WHEN MEN TIE ME UP.""

&gt;mothafuckinNOPE.jpg

&gt;""DON'T YOU?""

&gt;""I…uh…""

&gt;""OH COME ON. YOU KNOW YOU DO.""

&gt;nowords.jpg

&gt;""YOU SKINNY PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SO UPTIGHT.""

&gt;I choke. I don't know what to say. 

&gt;she shakes the rope at me, the fat on her sweating arms flapping about like a slab of wet chicken skin

&gt;""YOU GOTTA LOOSEN UP, GIRL. YOUR HUBBY WILL LOVE THIS. I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO USE IT WHEN WE GET HOME.""

&gt;""N…no thanks!""

&gt;""YOUR LOSS.""

&gt;I turn around, quickly. Goddammit. That's it. She's gone too far. I have to get out. This is too weird. I don't care if I leave her here. I don't care if she's mad.

&gt;""BLINKTWICEFORYES?!""

&gt;""…yes?""

&gt;""WHAT SIZE SHOULD I GET?""

&gt;I glance over my shoulder.

&gt;She's holding two dildos up to me. One big purple one, one smaller blue one.

&gt;ohgodwhy.gag

&gt;""I don't care. Get them both.""

&gt;""NO SILLY. THAT'S WASTEFUL. I ONLY NEED ONE.""

&gt;…she only…*NEEDS*…one…

&gt;huurrrrrgghhhhh.NOPE

&gt;""HOW'S THIS. I'LL GET THEM BOTH. YOU CAN PICK WHICH ONE YOU WANT WHEN WE GET HOME. IN RETURN, WILL YOU BUY ME DINNER?""

&gt;I swallow against a rising tide of vomit. I'm afraid that if I open my mouth, I actually *will* puke. I have to get out of here ASAP, no matter the cost. And dammit, no matter how hard I try, I'm still too nice to just abandon her.

&gt;I nod. 

&gt;We check out.

&gt;At least she pays this time.

&gt;On our way back, she stops at a frozen yogurt shop (of course). She's obsessed with frozen yogurt. Says they don't have it where she's from. She orders a large chocolate yogurt topped with chocolate shavings, m&amp;ms, gummy bears, and captain crunch. Oh, and she tops it all off with more chocolate sauce. It's beetus in a cup, really.

&gt;""IT'S SO HEALTHY!""

&gt;fattiegonnafat.wav

&gt;We get home

&gt;she devours the Pinkberry in under a minute, then sets in on some of the sushi. She does this every night. It's her before-dinner ""snack.""

1365801897.0	1c8dqy	My roommate the eventual planet.	SometimesIArt	414	96	130	"Man, you guys. Every time I post something here, you all freak out demanding more stories and I'm seriously running out. You all are like fatties in a McDick's buffet. I have like, one more horse story after this one (this isn't a horse story) and then I'm going to have to dig deeper into my memory banks. Yeesh. 

This one isn't so much of a story as a list of shit my on-the-way-to-becoming-a-nebula roommate does and says. We will call her Eventual Planet, or EP. 

When I first moved into this house with two girls and a guy (that dude is a trooper, man...) I was superfat, and in the past year have just lost it through super clean eating and running like mad (relevant, I promise). When I first moved in, EP was on the chubby side of normal. 

I think I left some of my old weight lying around because she fricking found it. I am now lighter than her by a good amount and I'm still ~6lbs overweight. 

Which I normally wouldn't judge, but she's kinda bitchy about it, so all the more entertainment for you guys. 

Here's what the problem is. She judges everyone. Bitches about everyone she meets, complains about school (CHOSE a science minor of some sort in her degree and is *constantly* complaining about having to do science-related work), bitches about the other roommates to me (so I can assume she does the same about me to them) even though they are the nicest people in the world, complains about being single ALL THE TIME, and always talks about her ex boyfriend and what a douche he is (we got the picture after about the 3rd time, no need for the extra 500) and then cries about it when he gets a new girlfriend. 

So with how complainy she is, as she's packing on the pounds she's getting bitchier and whinier about her body and is slowly joining the ranks of fat logic and body acceptance... and even tiny hints of TP. Oh fuck. 

I have to do something soon. 

Now, I'm going to try something new. I'm going to insert some green text to tell some short stories. Let me know if you love it or hate it. 

First hint of trouble. 

&gt;Be on a grocery shopping adventure with EP and British roommate (BR)

&gt;Drive by McDick's

&gt;EP suddenly moans with longing 

&gt;""We should stop, I want all of the fast food."" 

&gt;Me, just came back from trip to the USA and witnessed calorie counts on menues

&gt;""Man, did you know that a big mac meal has like, 1000cal? More if you get a large? Holy crap, eh?""

&gt;EP turns around and glares at me. 

&gt;""I don't count calories, so what the hell do I care?""

&gt;okaysorrywhatever.jpg

Sense shit is going to get real in the following months. 

&gt;Be me, helping tiny roommate/my best friend (TR) with workout things so she can be in shape. 

&gt;TR is very underweight and is very self-conscious about being too skinny

&gt;Helping her gain weight

&gt;EP is watching me teach her to use stability ball in reverse crunches

&gt;Fast forward a couple of days

&gt;Coming into house from a run

&gt;EP is walking around house at snail's pace

&gt;Groans loudly as she sits down in the kitchen while I grab water 

&gt;""I did those crunches you showed TR. I didn't do many but man is it ever a workout! My abs are so sore! I did like 10 of them, it was crazy!"" 

&gt;""Oh cool, what else did you do?"" Thinking it was core workout day for her.

&gt;""No that's it, it's all I could do."" 

&gt;Okayfairenough.png

&gt;EP complains for next day and a half about how sore her abs are from 10 crunches 

As time goes on, EP attempts to exercise. I mostly work from home, with morning shifts at a horse farm, so I know when it happens. Because she announces it loudly. ""Okay, gonna workout!"" Probably about once every other week or so. Comes up from basement (where our ""gym"" is) 20 mins later looking like she laid on the couch the whole time. I offer to help sometimes and she just gets angry/says not everyone has the time that I do to work out. 

I work 3 jobs but okay. 

Eating habits getting worse as days go on. 

&gt; Be EP, baking mass amounts of muffins and cookies every week. 

&gt;Seriously, like huge containers full. 

&gt;Eats bacon every other day for breakfast. Maple bacon. Normal maple bacon. 

&gt;Because low-fat and turkey bacon ""suck and taste like fake bacon."" 

&gt;1/2 package of bacon is just side for eggs, white toast with butter, and large Starbucks vanilla bean latte. 

&gt;When she doesn't have bacon she has eggs benedict with mass amounts of hollandaise sauce made with extra butter because ""I can't help it, butter is so delicious."" 

&gt;Judges my food. Makes weird comments about it. 

&gt;""Yeah, I guess you better love quinoa because you eat it for dinner like every day. You need variety."" 

&gt;""I don't know how you do that, I need to cook the hell out of my spinach because it's disgusting. At least I enjoy my food."" 

&gt;""You're not even going to put some sugar or something in your oatmeal? Gross."" 

&gt;Makes fun of BR's food 

&gt;He eats some form of soup every day. 

&gt;And pasta. 

&gt;He's super skinny, but actually in half decent shape. 

&gt;Can run like crazy. 

&gt;Makes everyone this super amazing tea out of super crappy tea bags a few times a day, TR and I freaking love it. Best tea ever. 

&gt;EP scoops sugar into every cup he gives her. 

&gt;EP, stop shooting for the beetus. 

Then came the slightly TP comments. 

&gt;Be me, home from jeans shopping with TR

&gt;TR has to go to work, leaves me alone with EP

&gt;I am excited. ""We found a store where both TR and I found jeans that fit great!"" 

&gt;EP is not excited. ""I'm surprised something like that exists. I can't find jeans that fit anywhere. Stores just cater to model-size, there's nothing for normal body types like mine. 

&gt;My ass is still fat

&gt;I found jeans. 

&gt;Mention that TR can't ever find jeans small enough without them looking like capris 

&gt;""Oh whatever, at least she has a hot body. Everything looks good on her.""

&gt;What. The. Actual. Fuck. 


So after trying multiple times to casually help her with exercise and diet I gave up for a bit. But then it didn't stop. She would constantly compare her body to TR's and talking about how lucky TR had it. TR is super uncomfortable with her skinniness and so I keep telling EP to stop commenting on it. She ignores me and bitches about how much easier TR has things and how she wishes she had tonnes of boys trying to date her like TR does. When I explain that it's causing trust issues (TR isn't ever sure when a guy is being her friend or just being nice to try to get into her pants) she says it's still better than always being single. Also says I have no right to say anything because I have a boyfriend. So basically everyone's opinions are invalid. 

Alright. That's enough for today. I'll stretch this out just specially for you folks, will make a story or two on EP's harsh judging/arguments about those thinner than her. I also have more fatlogic from her.

How the hell do I manage to make every single one of these a whole novella's worth of story? Holy hell. 

Also some advice on how to get after EP about health would be awesome. But remember I have to actually share a house with her, so nothing too mean you dinks. 

**TL;DR**: Continually expanding roommate is full of fatlogic and constantly bitches/whines/complains about everything while judging everyone and making my tiny best friend feel super self conscious via hinting about Thin Privilege. Also has disgusting eating habits she refuses to change.

1373048819.0	1hpcon	[Series] Rotundra and the Riotous Romantic Rendezvous: Tales of a Social Worker Part IV	onikakushi	397	77	38	"For those of you who are just joining my calorific chronicle or who simply wish to refresh themselves before today’s helping, you can find Part I [here](http://redd.it/1gthdi), Part II [here](http://redd.it/1gvxza) and Part III [here]( http://redd.it/1gyaj6).

Now that we’re all comfortable and have properly whetted our persnickety palates, please allow me to present the piquant picnic I have prepared patently for your pleasure.

During our last time together I told the tale of Rotundra’s terrible termination. However, due to the multitude of requests I received, today’s installment will be taking a short jog (metaphorically of course, teehee) to nearly a year prior to her eventual demise.

As the last leaves of Fall faded to brown and the screeching harbingers of the chilling Winter months that would soon befall our sleepy city blew between the deadened branches of the trees October was nearing its end. With the end of October comes what had up until this particular year been my favorite of holidays—Halloween. 

Thus, upon hearing that each year the job center threw a company Halloween party I was thrilled. Rightfully so, I had never before been in better shape and had a wide variety of costume options to choose from. 

In the weeks leading up the party, the office came alive with constant banter and speculation regarding everyone’s costumes—a welcome change of pace from the normal awkward silences that often had plagued my first few weeks at the center. 

However, like Dorothy upon discovering Oz,  I soon realized we weren’t in ‘Kansas’ anymore. Unlike my previous run-ins with Halloween parties, I soon noticed that many of my coworkers—the Berthas in particular—were seemingly more concerned with their dates than their costumes themselves.

In case a refresher is in order, the ‘Berthas’ (as I dubbed them) were a highly developed and tight-knit social group in the office. Consisting of nearly every secretary and female paper-pusher, the Berthas’ physical sizes were only trumped by the weighty auras of undeserved ego they exuded. Sitting upon (and breaking) their highest pedestal was Rotundra, a woman of truly celestial proportions who had been ignoring NASA’s yearly requests for her to return to orbit as Pluto, so we could once again have nine planets in our solar system. 

In the time leading up to this point, I had quickly realized the Berthas were the last group of people you wanted to associate with—especially as an in-shape white male. Indeed, the Thin Privilege was strong with these ones and since it is impossible for a white male to understand their struggle, I was scorned by their progressive sense of moral value. 

But, as fate would have it—my interactions with the Berthas were to increase dramatically, despite my best efforts to elude their greasy snares.

As I have mentioned in previous chapters, lunch time was always a point of contention. And while later on during my tenure I eventually came to discover and embrace the panacea of my office, at this point I was still determined to accrue some coworker cohorts.

I had managed to make one good friend during my brief stay—Tom. Tom worked in the IT department and had something of a bad temper when it came to ‘stupid people’ (aka nearly everyone), but had taken a liking to me.

I had quickly realized an important truth: one good friend in the IT department is greater than a legion of acquaintances not in the IT department. Prior to this job, I had always fancied myself something of a ‘computer whiz,’ at least in my family I was the go-to person when it came to computer problems. But, Tom was in a different league all together.

We had become good friends in a relatively short period of time—it turned out that we both had many of the same interests. What really sealed the deal however was when he found out that I was running track for my university—he had run cross-country in high school and was dying to get back into shape, so we began going to the gym together. It was a bromance match made in heaven.

During our lunch breaks we would sit in the corner of the cafeteria at one of the few tables uninhabited by the Berthas, and attempt to enjoy our meal to the best of our abilities—many times while planning our workouts for later that evening.

Due to the lunchroom’s relatively small size and concrete walls, you could easily hear everyone else’s conversations without much difficulty. While Tom and I had little to no interest in the Bertha’s banter, the reverse cannot be said.

It turns out that the mere mention of working out and eating healthy were ‘triggers’ for many of the Berthas and unfortunately Tom and I didn’t know how to use trigger warnings to protect their fragile faculties from our patriarchal hate speech.

Our clear inability to check our male privilege at the cafeteria room door led to our two-man oppression devastating any hopes for peace. And, neither of us could be assed to give even a single fuck whether or not the grazing cattle we shared our space with enjoyed our presence or not.

However, with the Halloween party rapidly approaching some of the Berthas decided to risk their own oppression to bridge the gap between us.

As Tom and I sat there munching away at our ‘rabbit food’ and discussing leg exercises, two of the smaller Berthas broke away from Rotundra’s gravitational pull to descend upon the opposite side of our table.

“Hey guys, we always hear you talking about working out and dieting and were wondering if you could help us…” the smaller one uttered. 

Tom and I quickly exchanged looks and replied, “with what?”

“Well, the Halloween party is coming up soon, right? We want to try to lose some weight before so we can look sexier for our dates and thought you guys could give us some pointers.”

Now, I’ll be the first to admit—nothing warms my heart like a fat person trying to get into shape, and I couldn’t stop myself from offering the best advice I could come up with. And after scribbling what we had said onto a piece of paper, they both thanked us and left.

Both Tom and I were shocked that we had managed to have a normal conversation with two of the Berthas—but skeptical they would actually put any of our advice into action. Either way, we went back to work that afternoon feeling pretty good.

Word travels fast among the Berthas, and so do delusions. Little did we know that the news of us giving the two lesser Moons a workout program had sparked a new and dangerous misunderstanding in the mind of Rotundra.

With only a week and a half left leading up the party, nearly everyone had decided on their costumes as well as their dates. Tom and I had decided to go with a Futurama theme—he was dressing as Bender and I as Fry. And since Tom was married he had talked his wife into dressing as Leela. We had all worked on our costumes together and were really excited about it.

That was, of course, until a few days later during lunch.

Once again, the same two Berthas rolled themselves over to our table. Ah—more workout advice, we figured as we looked at each other and resigned ourselves to play Q&amp;A yet again.

However, the question we were met with caught us quite off-guard, “so do you guys have dates yet for the Halloween party? Teehee.”

As I nearly choked on a bit of carrot, Tom tried his best to save us from this nosedive, “Yes, I’m taking my wife and were going together with Onikakushi.”

“So he [me] doesn’t have a date yet then?” She teased.

“No, but we’re meeting up before the party at my house and going together.” Tom stated once again, as I felt an overwhelming urge to brohug him.

“Well, Onikakushi—you’re so lucky! Rotundra totally said she would love to go with you and like since she tried that workout program you gave us she’s so thankful!” She said while winking.

If I had ever needed one of those Twix breaks, now was the time—my mind was not reacting fast enough to parse the information being force-fed to me.

Luckily, Tom wasn’t about to let me drown, “like I said twice already, he’s going with us—that means the **three** of us, how many times do I have to tell you?”

“Let him speak for himself! It’s not you she wants anyways—I bet you’re just jealous that a real woman like her would want him and not you!” The larger one exclaimed while pointing at Tom.

My brain hadn’t fully reengaged, but my survival instincts kicked in and I managed to string together the words, “I already made plans with Tom, so I can’t go with her, sorry.”

This wasn’t going to end well—I could feel it in my bones. They were not going to take no for an answer and both Tom and I knew it.

There was only one choice left.

“But, even though Onikakushi is already spoken for—we’ve got a friend who we know from the gym who would really like to go and would be happy to take Rotundra as his date,” Tom said while clearly straining to maintain some shred of composure.

The two Berthas looked at one another and whispered something between them quickly. “Is he as hot as you two?” They asked.

“Oh yeah, don’t worry about that, he out does us on every scale,” Tom replied.

“Well that works, just tell us the details before the night of the party! Thanks boys, hehe.” They said over their shoulders as they lumbered back to their table.
 	
News of Rotundra’s mystery date had spread like barbeque sauce on ribs before the end of work and the same question was on everyone’s mind—just who and **how** are they going to do this.

Tom and I knew we needed a plan, and quick. We had but only a few days to come up with the imaginary ‘gym buddy’ we had sacrificed to save ourselves. We knew we needed to deliver or else we were bound to have a terrible Halloween, and neither of us wanted that after the work we had put into it thus far.

So that night, instead of going to gym we decided to go to Craigslist. We figured if we were going to have any chance of pulling this off, we were going to need people of the highest caliber—the type of people *only* Craigslist can provide.

So without a moment’s hesitation we typed out a request for a “stud with muscles to match” who “knew how to treat a ‘real’ woman right and was willing to escort her to a Halloween party in return for some sexy time afterwards.” We went on to require them to post their bodily stats and the costume they would wear.

There was totally no way this could possibly fail.

Within a mere day, our throw-away email address was swamped with more than a few responses from many hopeful male candidates more than happy to fill the role.

After sifting through multiple fake and quintessential “yo baby u wnt sum fuk?” responses, we eventually settled on two candidates. We had Tom’s wife call both of them and tell them that she was Rotundra’s friend who was trying to hook her up with a good time—as well as checked to make sure they knew what they had to do / wear.

The first wouldn’t return our phone calls, so we were stuck putting all our eggs into the other basket. This champion was named Trey and he claimed to be 350lbs of “pure power” at a massive 5’6’’ tall (he further claimed bitches didn’t mind how short he was due to him being so huge).

While obviously Tom and I knew he was either so roided out that he was liable to explode at any given time or was lying through his teeth (if he had any)—we didn’t care as long as he showed up. Trey told us that he had often gone to Halloween parties as “shirtless Aladdin,” because girls always wanted him to take off his shirt anyways (so he’d just be a gentleman and save them the trouble). 

We couldn’t wait.

On the night of the party the main waiting room / lobby that usually seated all those hopefully awaiting their turn was converted into a Halloween themed ballroom—with punchbowls and treats to match.

Tom, his wife and I all decided to show up early so we could be sure we weren’t going to miss the main event. As we patiently waited for Trey to show up, we took turns being physically ill and poking fun at the Bertha’s various ‘sexy’ costumes—many of which were clearly designed for women 1/10th their size. But, in true Bertha fashion, Rotundra always needed to stand out the most—and stand out she did. Her costume consisted of what appeared to be lingerie paired with a jewel-encrusted mask that only covered her eyes and nose—she claimed to be a “succubus.” Never before had I ever wished to be asexual as strongly as I had at the mention of that word.

Nearly everyone had shown up by now and we were starting to get worried that Trey may have had second thoughts, or perhaps he misplaced his shamshir—either way we needed him, now.

Luckily, it was right around then that Tom’s phone got a text that exclaimed, “I’m here where u at.”

Tom quickly texted him back telling him to come inside and look for the woman in the mask—that you couldn’t miss her. 

As both double doors came flying open as though Zeus himself had thrust them open, a true lump of a shirtless man came heavily panting through the threshold. His beady eyes and body odor quickly ran across the room until his eyes locked on “the woman in the mask.”

Tom and I knew it was over, he was going to bolt. Oh well, it had been a good run we thought as we looked at each other while biting our tongues.

“Ey baby, I’m Trey—but you can call me your prince of the sands,” he shouted as he made his way to Rotundra with open arms jiggling.

After a few seconds of looking flustered, Rotundra replied with words I will never forget, “well take me on your magic carpet ride then sexy.”

Needless to say, Tom and I excused ourselves to go puke and die from laughter as our sides hit terminal velocity in the bathroom. Neither of us could fathom how that had managed to work out, but we knew it was beautiful in some sick way all the same. So we cleaned ourselves up and returned to the party—a party which now suspiciously was missing its two largest bodies—er, personalities. 

Following the weekend and our return to the office on Monday, we eventually heard through word of mouth of the Berthas that Rotundra was claiming Trey as her soul mate, and that they were going to eventually get married—as soon as he got divorced from his current wife (who he was only still married to because she was pregnant and the state won’t let you divorce your wife if she’s pregnant…or so he claimed).

Looking back on it to this day, I have never had such a great Halloween ever since. I doubt I will have such a chance ever again.

Tom and I continued to eat together and life proceeded as ‘normal’ as it always was at the job center. That was of course until Trey applied for a job in the mailroom a few months later—but that’s a tale for another time.

**TL;DR – I narrowly escape being served up as an offering for Queen Beetus with the help of my newly acquired brother in arms. We then manage to rig together a plan even MacGyver would have ‘mired and save the Halloween party**

1371708317.0	1gpn4i	"[x-post from /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy] ""The worst and most awkward delivery that ever happened to me."""	hamplanet4004	372	52	38	"This happened 2 years ago. I was working for a pizza shop in my hometown that was run by a pleasant Turkish family and I loved my job (unfortunately issues caused the business to close so I could not continue to work there). So anyways I get a call for a large pizza, a lasagna dinner, and 2 bottles (2 liter bottles) of Pepsi to be delivered to an apartment complex that I regularly delivered to but an apartment number I did not recognize. So I finish up the order, drive over there, and then it gets weird.

I pull in and head down a flight of stairs to the appropriate apartment. As i walk down the stairs I get BLASTED in the face by a smell that I can only describe as a moldy, musty, dirty scent. Something between old puke, burnt hair, mold, and a dead animal. This shit was foul. I hold my breath and knock on the door. A voice replies from within, ""Let yourself in, it is open."" Weird. But whatever. I go in and the smell elevates to code red, like uncovered mass grave type of smell.

The room is dimly lit by a few candles but not lights or windows and it looks like I just walked into a house from Hoarders. Directly in front of me are piles of random things and trash, these piles are everywhere that I can see. Then from my right I here, ""Put the food on the table."" I look to see the source of the voice and find the aforementioned table and I think I let out an audible gasp. I see a man who had to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 pounds (I am not exaggerating this, I was staring at IRL Jabba the Hut) is sitting on a love seat and spilling out over the sides. He has a desk in front of him and is motioning to it so I place the food down. Directly next to the couch is a four foot tall mountain of empty 2 liter Pepsi bottles.

He had left his credit card info with the restaurant so i handed him the receipt and pen and had him sign it and he writes a fat 0 with a line through it in the tip column and then signs the bottom (with a remarkably good looking signature I must add). I take the receipt and he says, and i quote, ""Do you want a tip? You'll need to do a little extra."" Perfectly contempt to get out of there so I can breathe fresh air without a tip I begin to say thanks but no thanks; however the man does not give me the chance to answer and instead says, ""Go in the kitchen and get me a fork and a knife."" I was too confused and terrified to do anything but wander through the trash infested living room and dining room to go into the kitchen (still no lights) and listen to him give me turn by turn directions to the fork and knife. The kitchen floor was stained and covered in so much dirt and grease that i could kick a layer off, there were more dirty dishes in the sink than all of the dishes in my entire apartment, and there were piles of trash everywhere. I got him his utensils handed them too him and he handed me back my tip, 2 warm sticky quarters. I thank him and get the fuck out as he tells me to make sure the door shuts behind me.

I was traumatized and felt so dirty afterwards. The more I thought about it and talked to people about what the fuck had happened, I came to the conclusion that besides the trash, the smell had to have come from that man's inability to get off of the couch and properly clean himself. I know from being in those apartments before that the showers would not be big enough for him unless he had a custom one installed and judging by how he looked and acted he probably could not get off of the couch. I felt bad but was terrified to ever go back and anytime he called back (he became a semi-regular and he always ordered the same thing) I always would make sure that I gave that delivery to another driver.

TLDR: 600 pound man that smells like rotting corpse gives odd requests and then tips 50 cents.

1367245637.0	1dc7jq	Ursa Minor vs. Niobe and Meliboea: Birthday Cake	throwing_pies	404	83	101	"Aaand I'm back! 

Once again, not (directly) an Ursae story, though Ursa Minor (my hamplanet cousin who is usually the antagonist) makes an appearance. But it's another story about a mother-daughter planetary duo. We will call them Niobe and Meliboea, because goddamn her mother is proud, and goddamn I love mythology. My greentext is a little rusty, apologies.

&gt;be me, almost 12

&gt;because it's gonna be my birthday soon, fuck yeah!

&gt;going to have a birthday party, haven't had one in awhile

&gt;invited most of class since school has a rule that if you're going to hand out invitations in class 
then you have to give them to everyone in the class that's your gender

&gt;too many kids bickering and having crying fits over being excluded otherwise, pretty hilarious in 
hindsight

&gt;all the people who disliked me bowed out

&gt;awesome

&gt;all that's left is friends and people I don't know well but don't have a problem with

&gt;super excited

&gt;ursa minor invited along to help my parents keep the ~15 young children in check

&gt;she's generally okay to kids who aren't me in small doses, so it's not a bad idea

&gt;parents rented out a room at the local ice skating rink


The way this works (since I'm not sure if it's common) is you can rent out kind of a conference room there, with a giant table, so that you can go play on the rink but also have a place to stash presents, coats, all the other things small children come with, and a place you can have your cake and all that. The expectation is that you spend your time in the rink, go in there for an hour, have your cake, and go home, so we didn't intend on using the room until the end.


&gt;party arrives

&gt;everything goes great

&gt;lots of fun skating except some girl fell down and cried for half an hour

&gt;still, pretty good time

&gt;someone's late though, we have an extra nametag and no one's taken it

&gt;who's it for?

&gt;check the guest list

&gt;Hmm, who's Meliboea?

&gt;Some girl from class I don't know well? Strange, she said she was coming... maybe she's just run 
into traffic or something

&gt;hour passes by

&gt;everyone having fun, but still no Meliboea

&gt;second hour passes

&gt;still fun, still no Meliboea.

&gt;beginning of the third hour, kids are all pretty tired, figure it's time for cake 

&gt;parents and Ursa Minor begin herding children into room when the room starts shaking

&gt;ice is cracking in sympathy

&gt;not sure if we're in a re-enactment of the Titanic all of a sudden

&gt;*I'LL NEVER LET GO, JACK*

&gt;Oh wait, just some gravitational disturbances.

&gt;in wobbles Meliboea and her mother Niobe

&gt;Meliboea actually isn't that fat, though she's well on her way.

&gt;Her mother Niobe though.

&gt;She's a really weird sort of fat, not doughy. Her skin looks more like an orange peel and crowds 
her already piggy shaped face and for some reason is tinged all red. I would guess her at 5'6, 250bs at least.

&gt;What. The. Fuck?

&gt;Ursa Minor comes, gravitational fields are disturbed

&gt;""Oh, hello! You must be Meliboea and Niobe! We're sorry you've come so late, the kids are done 
skating now and they're going to eat cake, but of course you're welcome to j--""

&gt;""NO""

&gt;Meliboea stomps one of her little stump legs

&gt;""I WANT TO SKATE.""

&gt;""Well Meliboea, I understand and I wish you could've too, but--""

&gt;planets nearly collide when Niobe butts in

&gt;LET HER SKATE.

&gt;""I'm sorry, but she can't, the kids are going to have cake n-""

&gt;NO, LET HER. LET HER SKATE.

&gt;Ursa Minor is confused and cannot compute

&gt;someone older than her is telling her to do something that she was told not to do?

&gt;you could see the systems frying in her head

&gt;she looks over to my mother for help

&gt;""Um, Niobe? Why do you want her to skate so much?""

&gt;BECAUSE SHE WAS IN *SUPPLEMENTARY CLASSES* EARLIER. 

&gt;""...so...?""

&gt;IT'S NOT HER FAULT SHE COULDN'T SKATE, SHE WANTS TO, SHE WAS REALLY LOOKING 
FORWARD TO IT.

&gt;""But if she skates, we might not have enough time for cake and presents. It wouldn't be fair to 
the other kids.""

&gt;*IT'S NOT FAIR TO MELIBOEA!!!!*

&gt;Meliboea has been standing there looking smug as fuck

&gt;I wonder why I have never noticed what a smug, punchable face she had

&gt;""How about this? Meliboea, you can go skate with Ursa Minor for a few minutes. The other kids 
are going to go into the room and settle down first, okay?""

&gt;Ursa Minor looks terrified but slowly heads off into the distance with Meliboea in tow

&gt;Parents continue getting children into conference room

&gt;Because we are children and children are crazy, we don't settle down for maybe 15 minutes so 
by the time Ursa Minor's hauled Meliboea and Niobe back with us, we're still just singing Happy 
Birthday and the cake hasn't been cut yet

&gt;By the way, it's an amazing cake

&gt;It's gigantic

&gt;Blue and pink buttercream roses on the corners

&gt;butterflies

&gt;Vanilla with strawberry filling 

&gt;thick whipped icing (I am not a cook but I was told it's a bit better than whatever the normal 
thing in icing is. It tasted more like whipped cream?)

&gt;*it looked so good*

&gt;As birthday girl, get to cut the cake and get the first slice

&gt;Oh boy I love cutting cakes

&gt;Oh boy Oh boy

&gt;start cutting a slice with the biggest flower because I am a little girl

&gt;a rumble fills the room

&gt;""*WAIT*""

&gt;it's Niobe, addressing me directly

&gt;close enough her spit gets on me

&gt;""GIVE THE FIRST SLICE TO MELIBOEA.""

&gt;Ursa Minor's jimmies are rustled

&gt;Perhaps she felt the need to defend her family's right to food

&gt;A truly noble hamplanet endeavor.

&gt;""Niobe, that doesn't make sense... it's throwing_pies' birthday, everyone knows the birthday girl 
gets the first slice of cake!""

&gt;""NO. Meliboea had classes, so she's tired. She NEEDS that cake more than anyone else here! 
She's tired from thinking so hard!!!""

&gt;I speak up

&gt;""But we've all been skating for hours... we're hungry too. Thinking doesn't burn calories!""

&gt;perhaps now that she has a smaller target, she starts getting more impassioned

&gt;""BUT YOU DON'T NEED THE CALORIES! SHE'S TIRED, SHE'S HAD CLASSES FOR TWO WHOLE HOURS. ALL THE REST OF YOU HAVE DONE IS JUST PLAY. JUST GIVE HER THE FIRST SLICE.""

&gt;I am confused and not sure how to proceed

&gt;my mother just shakes her head and tells me to give her the first slice

&gt;I start to cut a different slice than the one I wanted for myself

&gt;""Nooooooooo!""

&gt;Meliboea is whining

&gt;she has the most godawful, high, nasally voice

&gt;""I want thaaaaaaaat slice!!!!!!!!!!""

&gt;she points at the one I was cutting

&gt;I am upset now

&gt;""But I want that slice! It has a flower, I want it!""

&gt;Niobe once again

&gt;""Ugh, you're just a kid, you don't GET it! SHE NEEDS THE CALORIES, she needs that flower! She 
worked so hard in class today, all you did is have fun! You shouldn't have that flower, give it to 
her!""

&gt;...

&gt;""Yeah, I waaaantttt ittttt!!!!""

&gt;""But...I want it... it's my birthday...""

&gt;""But I neeeeeeeeed ittttt!!!""

&gt;""YEAH, JUST LISTEN TO HER, SHE NEEDS IT! BE CONSIDERATE!!!""

&gt;Ursa Minor doesn't like this, and is about to cut in again but my mom stops her

&gt;""Just... just give her the cake, throwing_pies.""

&gt;Fine.

&gt;start cutting the cake a little smaller than I was before anyway

&gt;""NO! GIVE HER A BIGGER SLICE THAN THAT, DO YOU REALLY THINK SHE CAN COUNT ON SO LITTLE?""

&gt;...wut

&gt;Ursa Minor takes knife, purposely cuts hilariously large piece

&gt;""THAT'S BETTER.""

&gt;Ursa minor and myself aghast that she isn't getting the message and we just watch Meliboea stuff her face

&gt;Angrily stab out cake pieces for everyone else too

&gt;none of the kids have really noticed any of this because they're screaming like the crazy children 
that children are

&gt;Anyway, we've all got cake now at least

&gt;Mood is better since everyone's happy

&gt;Present time!

&gt;Meliboea and two other girls banded together and got me something rather expensive (I think it 
was $50 though I don't remember what it was)

&gt;thank them profusely

&gt;Then Niobe pulls out another present

&gt;Not to sound ungrateful, but it was a piece of shit.

&gt;It was some cheap, plastic piggy (HAH) bank.

&gt;Badly painted

&gt;Could barely open

&gt;Had scuffs

&gt;Honestly, it looked like she'd bought it from Chinatown, thrown it into a closet for years, then 
decided to hand it off to me.

&gt;The kind of thing you only give to someone to insult them.

&gt;Niobe was proud as fuck about it though

&gt;""We even gave you something else! We didn't *have* to, but we did. We spent a lot of money 
on you. We're just trying to be good guests, like you guys are trying to be good hosts. We're just trying to do the right thing, be good people.""

&gt;I am totally aghast as to what to say

&gt;Ursa Minor seems like she's been building up rage for a bit though so

&gt;""Yeah, we're really good hosts. We let your daughter do everything even though she was late.""

&gt;Niobe gets even more red than before

&gt;Seriously, I think she might have a skin condition.

&gt;Party's winding down anyway

&gt;Peoples' parents start arriving

&gt;My parents are busy so it's mostly Ursa Minor saying goodbye and thanking people for coming

&gt;Niobe and Meliboea think it's time to bring their orbits elsewhere as well

&gt;But of course, not before...

&gt;""I want a seeeecond slice of caaaaaaaake!!!!!""

&gt;""Meliboea, I'm sorry, there's not enough to give everyone a second slice. It wouldn't be fair if you got one.""

&gt;""But, but I waaaaaaaaaaant one!! I'm hungryyyy!!! I worked reaaaaaallyyyy haaaard!!!""

&gt;""Meliboea, we can't do that, I'm sorry, maybe you have food at home?""

&gt;""I want caaaaaaaaaaaaake!!""

&gt;""JUST GIVE HER ANOTHER SLICE.""

&gt;""...""

&gt;""She's HUNGRY, why can't any of you SEE that?!?!?!?!""

&gt;""...she wants cake. All children want cake. But we don't have enough to give everyone!""

&gt;""UGH! Then give it to ME! PARENTS should get cake, right???""

&gt;by now the other parents are staring at this confrontation between the titans

&gt;""WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF KIDS SO WE'RE TIRED AND NEED FOOD!""

&gt;""But you didn't take care of anyone!""

&gt;""DON'T YOU THINK PARENTS SHOULD GET SOMETHING?!?!?!""

&gt;At this the other parents look worried

&gt;My parents are looking worried too

&gt;awkward silence

&gt;One person's mom speaks up

&gt;""Um, you know, if she wants cake... I don't need cake and my daughter doesn't either, so...""

&gt;all the other parents start chiming in

&gt;Niobe sees this as support

&gt;""SEE? THEY DON'T WANT IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE ONE EXTRA SLICE. THERE'S ENOUGH FOR ME. GIVE IT TO ME.""

&gt;parents give in, cut a slice, give it to Niobe.

&gt;She finally waddles off to fatter horizons with Meliboea

&gt;later at school, the other kids give me shit because they didn't get more cake

&gt;Surprisingly, her daughter and I never became friends.

My mom felt really bad and bought me a second, fancier cake the next day. Later Ursa Minor told me that my class and I were the most diplomatic group of kids she's ever met for putting up with Niobe and Meliboea. Though she never met Niobe again, whenever she came across Meliboea she made sure to treat her a bit worse than everyone else. 

I think Meliboea went on to develop the beetus in high school, though I could be wrong. She developed *some*thing and started using it as an excuse for, well, everything (not a thyroid problem though. Alas). She also started eating m&amp;ms absolutely nonstop. Every time I ever saw her, she had m&amp;ms. I swear to god I saw them spill out of her pencil case before. I do not fucking get it. My mother and Niobe hate each other now. Sometimes they see each other while grocery shopping. My mother enjoys reminding Niobe that my university's better than Meliboea's even though I didn't go to many supplementary classes, amongst other things. Niobe, I assume, enjoys her cake.

1374608028.0	1iwkou	"Kimmy Gobbler in ""The Meaty Meeting"""	Lucist	411	87	54	"Hello my fellow Hammoids! Medium time lurker, first time poster. I'm not too familiar with green text, but I'll give it a try.

Starring: 
Lucist: 18 M 5'7(170cm) 188lbs(90kg). overweight, yours truly.

CollegeBro: 18 M 5'11(180cm) 180lbs(81kg) of pure muscle. High school friend attending same college.

Scarlett: 19 F 5'4(162cm) 115lbs(52kg). A girl I met in one of my freshman classes. Fit as all hell. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson. Lives with Gobbler.

Kimmy Gobbler: XX F 5'2(157cm) and a GENEROUS 300lbs(136kg). Star of the show.



So I'd like to preface this woeful tale with a little back story of yours truly. I was never a complete hamplanet, but I teetered a little too close to the edge of it in the past. During the time before these events took place I was probably 5'7(170cm) and around 210 lbs(95kg). Now being from a very health conscious family I would get shit every day from my mother about my weight which always left me in a state of depression. I knew she was right, but that shit still hurt. So, basically, I was really sensitive about my weight. So I ended up working out the summer before college thanks to CollegeBro and ended up losing 22lbs by midsummer. Even after the weight loss, I could never shake that feeling of inadequacy for being overweight.

And so it begins:

 I had moved 6 hours upstate with CollegeBro to attend a tech school learning to develop dem vidya games. CollegeBro and I rented a small, dingy house from one of his friends. No fucks given, rent was affordable and it was relatively cozy. 

After moving in (helped CollegeBro move up his entire damned gym into his room) CollegeBro wanted to go say hey to the next door neighbors. Being the beta I am, I say nah, gotta get in that unpacking. He's cool with it, he goes by himself. Man I envy that kid and his Alpha-ness.

After about an hour and a half he comes back with that shit eating grin he always gives me when he's accomplished something.

commence the green text:
&gt;""Yo Lucist! You should have come with me man.""

&gt;""Wat?""

&gt;look over at the house he just left

&gt;see two of the most attractive women I've ever seen wave at us

&gt;one was a redhead the other a brunette

&gt;[mrw](http://24.media.tumblr.com/f729ba7724cbc8b71b47ffcf3c9f72ad/tumblr_mn7ra1abfQ1srhf08o1_400.gif)

&gt;they giggle and head into their apartment

&gt; ""All girls man. Every single one.""

&gt;CB pulls something out of his pocket

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OMG-bird.gif) it's 2 phone numbers

&gt;CB seeing my face calls me a beta and says they invited us to a party next weekend and that he would introduce me to them

&gt;myniggah.7z

&gt;charge him and start hugging every part i can grab. #NoHomo

As you can probably tell, CB was pretty good with women and was just a greatguy to be around. I'm usually not a very social person and I don't like being around social people, but CB was one of my oldest and closest friends. We've known each other since childhood. Ever since I was bullied in 2nd grade for wearing glasses, he never took anyone giving me shit and always had my back. 

Now, I realize I've given you almost no sugar for your Beetus filled hearts yet. This is where the story gets very Hammy, don't worry.

&gt;first class of my college career. FUCK YEAH!

&gt;sit in the middle row because don't want to commit to a side

&gt;take out notebook and pen like a good college student

&gt;hear someone yell ""HEY!"" pretty close to me

&gt;no fucks given, I don't know anyone yet. Must be someone trying to get the attention of a friend

&gt;feel the hand of an angel on my shoulder

&gt;isthisthepromisedland.rar

&gt;[MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpomiiIJHN1qii6tmo1_400.gif) I turn to see the cute redhead from next door connected to the hand on my shoulder

&gt;itis.zip

&gt;""What's up, neighbor?"" She said with the most beautiful smile I'd ever seen and her hand now looking for a handshake

&gt;end up doing something close to [this](http://i.imgur.com/YYkNO.gif) with her

&gt;the cringe

&gt;me mortified, just stares at her

&gt;she stares back

&gt;hold the line men

&gt;she bursts into laughter and everyone starts staring at us

&gt;I notice the stares I'm getting by all the other guys because this girl is amazing

CB likes to remind me that I can be awkward as fuck at times, but I'm pretty good at fast talking my way out of them.

&gt;""so, I guess that's a 10 on most awkward meetings."" I say looking at my notebook.

&gt;""yeah, but it's alright. Now we have something to tell CB""

&gt;""don't you dare!""

Find out her name is ""Scarlett"" and comment on how she looks like Scarlett Johansson. Talked about a lot of things in that short amount of time we had before class started. She was a really interesting girl. But then, the horrible happened.

The fluorescent lights flickered. Earthquakes rocked and shook the classroom and our desks. The pen on my table bounced up and down to a very rhythmic beat. I'm pretty sure at one point I heard a small child cry. I look to the epicenter of the seismic activity to see my first ever Hamplanet. 

I grew up in a town where Hamplanets are scarce. It wasn't that we were a healthy town, but that there just weren't a lot of Beetus filled asteroids around our area. So, I was extremely surprised  seeing this fleshy, CURVAY, and very spherical planet ~~walk~~ roll towards Scarlett and I.


&gt;she managed to slow down and stop right in the edge of our row.

&gt;maybe she'll sit at the edge, I don't think all 300lbs of her could fit through our aisle

&gt;besides, I don't think Scarlett even knows her

&gt;why would she sit with us? Right? RIGHT?

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Miley-Cyrus-surprised.gif) Scarlett waved at her.

&gt;she waved back

&gt;""Hey KG! Saved you a seat""

&gt;proceeds to squeeze into aisle

&gt;sweating from pure effort, must be hard

&gt;something just hits me

&gt;she's coming in from my side of the aisle

&gt;MFW I have no face

&gt;the ball rolls closer and I get to actually see what she looks like

She was the most fantastic thing I've ever seen in my life. I didn't even know something like her could exist. Let's start from the bottom shall we? She wore sandals with those straps that you tie up your leg to keep them from falling off. Those poor straps. I've never seen anything so stretched and frayed then these straps wrapped around her cankles. She wore fishnet stockings that looked like they were about to break and fly into space escaping her orbit. She wore a T-Shirt with a picture of Justin Bieber on it. I'm not one to start the JB fangasm because I'm not a fan. I don't like the guy, but I couldn't feel worse for the poor kid. His face was warped into some weird amalgamation of a potato and a cauliflower along with his original face due to the voluptuous hills of her body. Top it all off with noodle looking greasy hair that looked like she dumped a particularly greasy serving of Lo Mein on her head and makeup that almost made her look like a clown. Clowns creep me out.

&gt;”HEY GIRL! YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED FOR BREAKFAST, I MADE SOME GOOD FOOD!”

&gt;man her voice was shrill

&gt;Scarlett says she's sorry but she had an early classes

&gt;look down at my book because beta, don't want to intrude

&gt;realize that it's raining indoors

&gt;realize I'm losing my mind

&gt;look over to planet to see raindrops flying at me from her mouth

&gt;”SO, ARE YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE ME TO THIS HANDSOME BROWNIE HERE?”

&gt;she called me a brownie. My family's from India

&gt;doesn'tmattergotcomplimented.bin

&gt;Scarlett introduces us

&gt;planets name is actually Kimmy Gobbler

&gt;KG and Scarlett are roommates 

The professor walks in and begins class. Lecture was done through powerpoint so the room was dark for the entirety of class.

&gt;feel a slight nudge from Scarlett's side

&gt;passes me her notebook with a 3 x 3 drawn and an x in one of the boxes

&gt;fuck yeah tic tac toe

&gt;ithinkshelikesme.avi

&gt;spend half the class playfully cheating at tic tac toe and writing notes to her

&gt;hear a loud creak from other side

&gt;in as close to a whisper as all her curves let her muster:

&gt;”HEY GUYS I WANT TO PLAY TOO! I'M REAL GOOD AT O'S AND X'S Tee^hee”

&gt;most annoying teehee ever

&gt;she calls it O's and X's

&gt;be a nice guy, offer to play a round with her

&gt;beat her because I'm awesome at it

&gt;she wants to go again and tells me not to cheat

&gt;wat?

&gt;Scarlett is giggling softly

&gt;KG proceeds to claim that she's allowed to put 2 O's down because ~~she ate a lady~~ she's a lady

&gt;howshouldireact.mp3

&gt;notafuck, poker face through the few games

&gt;KG wins all of them

&gt;iwonderwhy.flv

&gt;KG grins like she's seen a mountain of bacon and she has a team of pallbearers to carry her up it

&gt;poor pallbearers

&gt;Scarlett gets my attention and wants to pass more notes

Halfway through the class I hear KG rustling through her bag.

&gt;KG pulls out a family size bag of chips, 3 servings of KFC in tupperware the size of a salad bowl and 2! 2 liters of diet coke

&gt;mustbewatchingherweight.doc

&gt;realize that she's eating them now...when the professor went over a strict no eating in class policy

&gt;takes a big handful of chips and begins to stuff them into face

&gt;sit there listening to the medley of noise she's making with her meal

&gt;realize by her movements that she's trying to eat quietly

&gt;professor has supersonic hearing

&gt;turns on lights to see who is actually committing the dirty deed

&gt;[hfw](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg ) she's caught

&gt;”Excuse me, we have a strict no eating policy in my classroom. Please put it away or you can step outside to finish it and come back in”

I'm a pretty avid reader of FPS and I have read a lot of things Hamplanets say when it comes to them and their food. As this was my first encounter with a Planet, I've never experienced anything close to fatlogic in my life. My innocence was taken.

&gt;”EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A CONDITION! NO NOURISHMENT FOR A FEW HOURS AND I MIGHT JUST FAINT RIGHT HERE IN YOUR CLASS”

&gt;the small sonic boom her voice causes makes me recoil

&gt;professor explains that if she had such a condition, she should provide her with a note from student health services along with a doctors note

&gt;makessense.jpg

&gt;”I DON'T NEED TO BRING IN A  DAMN DOCTOR'S NOTE BECAUSE MY CONDITION IS SO OBVIOUS. ARE YOU BLIND OR SOMETHING?”

&gt;she says this to a professor with a doctorate

&gt;try to imagine what her condition could actually be

&gt;look over to Scarlett who has a blank stare and has gone off into her own world

&gt;professor looking as red as a ham(hah!) asks her to take her stuff and leave now and bring a doctor's note tomorrow

&gt;she then proceeds to curse at the professor

&gt;whatintheactualfuck.png

&gt;calls the professor a dried up fat shaming whore

&gt;i'mnotjoking.mpeg

&gt;picks up her bag, heaves her girth out of the fat constricting chair and proceeds to ~~roll~~ walk herself out of the classroom gasping for air at every step up

&gt;”BYE SCARLETT, BYE LUCIST” she manages to yell mid gasp

&gt;sink into my chair

Over the next week I learn things about KG from Scarlett, who apparently, has become entirely scarred from living with KG for said week.

Next Part: Kimmy Gobbler in The Party Pooper(dat foreshadowing)


Note: Hey! I'm new to posting stories in FPS and actually am pretty new to posting in Reddit in general. I'll take any advice you give me because nothing fills up my arteries like the gooey frosted advice of you Hams. So keep that constructive criticism coming! I'll also answer questions if you have 'em. Also, sorry if it's too long =/

next part (more of an episode) right here: [part2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ixhwt/kimmy_gobbler_in_the_fatty_filler/)"	t5_2vzax	True
1367994608.0	1dx2hg	So with all the cringe-worthy, frustrating FPS on this board, here's one that might make you smile	YouCantBeSeirous	396	73	27	"A friend of mine, lets call her Marcy, is fat.  I suck at guessing heights and weights, [but google does her justice, though she's a bit shorter.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bi6my806SxM/Tq7bQq8cErI/AAAAAAAAAIU/ZlVZb_4-AA0/s1600/fat_women_250x251.jpg)

Marcy is nice.  The kind of nice that makes you take a hard look at your cynical self and want to be a nicer person.  And she cooks like she deserves a God damned TV show, and even throws dinner parties every now and then.

She has guy trouble, but not the kind you'd think- she gets dates (she's on OKcupid and aims within her league) but the guys she goes out with always take advantage of how nice she is and end up sort of using her.  

One of her ex's lived about 20 miles away and had no car, which wouldn't be a big deal, except he got so used to her driving everywhere that he stopped saying please and thank you and even volunteered her to drive out to him and his friend and drop them off at a nerd convention without even inviting her.

And in spite of her guy trouble, she's always ridiculously optimistic about dating.

Anyway.

So my FPS is that today we went biking, and Reddit- you should have seen it.  I'm in okay shape and bike regularly (I can do 10 miles in ~35-37 minutes) with my brother who's in shape proportionally to me (He does 10 miles in ~30-32 minutes) as I am in shape proportionally to her.

So we started the bike trail and I was in half the gear I usually do, just leisurely keeping pace with her (which wasn't terrible), and she had to take two breaks (one before the biggest hill and one at the halfway mark where we turned around), and it took a little longer than an hour...

but she finished it.  

She was beat by the end of it, but she finished it.  I can not express how proud I am of her, especially because we're going to make it a regular thing (between my days I ride with my brother) and she didn't even complain until after which was that ""I'm so satisfied that it's tough to walk"" complaining.

So yeah.  Today I was proud and got the warm and fuzzy's and thought I'd share."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Be a social worker handling difficult cases for CPS

In June of last year, I'd been summoned to make a determination in an unusual case: a boy who had an unhealthy fixation.  There were no outward signs of abuse, but his behavior, and demeanor, had led to his file being flagged.  I knew his case worker personally - Bertha, a jolly (and perhaps a little chubby) middle aged woman who was normally unflappable, but who started stammering when discussing this child with me.

This is the kind of case I specialize in: the kind that leaves professionals scratching their heads.  I relish these challenges.  And so it was that after a late lunch on a spring day, I headed over to his home to find out what was really going on.

The house looked like the owners took care of it.  The boy's mother, a gracious and attractive woman who would direct me to the living room to meet her disturbed child.

By all outward appearances, everything was normal.

It's always the normal ones that're the freakiest, inside.

Her child seemed gaunt, even emaciated.  His eyes flicked about the room nervously, before settling on me and widening.

I began to sweat.  What was going on?  I felt dizzy.  I had to draw up a chair to listen to the boy's tale.

""I see fat people,"" he whispered.  ""They're everywhere.  They don't know they're fat.""  My blood chilled.

Over half an hour I drew out an incredible description of a world almost unimaginable to a normal man like myself.  He talked of disgustingly fat men and women, everywhere one looked, eating like dogs and behaving like pigs.  He explained how they'd tell everyone who listened that they deserved special consideration, and that besides, they weren't fat.

The child was clearly fixated on ""fat people"".

The scheduled half hour seemed to drag on forever, like ice cream melting in winter.  I wrapped things up as smoothly as I could, not making any suggestions at that time.  His mother sadly bid me farewell as I headed out the door, lost in thought.

I went over my notes more thoroughly, over Baconators at Wendy's.  Was he schizophrenic?  It didn't look like it to me.  His mental functions seemed fine, other than a curious obsession with problems that didn't - couldn't - exist.

*What if he's right*, I thought.  *What if he's seeing things as they are, and we're the ones who're delusional?*

A healthy dose of reality would be needed for this one.  I'd need to take him out into the real world, so he could see what ordinary people looked like.  People like the ones in this restaurant - no fat people here!

As I finished up and stepped away from the table, I began to formulate a course of treatment.  I could save this child, I realized.  I smiled.

I squeezed behind the wheel of my Buick and absentmindedly planned my route home after a hard day's work.  I'd probably be going by the new Taco Bell.  I could really go for some of their chalupas right about now.

After all, a working man's got to keep his blood sugar up."	t5_2vzax	True

&gt;Wake up in the morning to Eris’ crying 

&gt;I hear it coming from the bathroom 

&gt;Go to check it out
Eris checked her weight, and to her surprise, it went up

*What are the chances?*

&gt;Eris: It’s not working, what I am doing wrong

&gt;Mom comes in to comfort Eris

&gt;Mom: Sweetie you haven’t it given enough time to get into your blood system yet, plus weight fluctuates a lot day to day 

&gt;Me: yeah it’s probably has nothing to do with your diet, you just got to let the ions get to work (LOL)

&gt;Eris’s weeping subsides

The next couple days Eris is checking her weight multiple times throughout the day. Sometimes her weight decreases and she is ecstatic. And other days her weight increases and she is depressed. A [graph]( http://i.imgur.com/x3HQR8v.png) detailing what is going on. 

&gt;Eris: Mom I am putting on weight faster than ever, what is going on?

&gt;Mom: This is completely normal. I’ll try to explain what is going on to your body the best I can. 

**Fat Science News Report**  
Mom:  Okay when you burn calories, your body starts to get hot, that’s why it’s called burning calories. This is completely natural, however if you burn a lot, like now when you are taking the Coffee Extract Pills, it generates a lot of heat. This heat can be damaging for your organs, so the body builds up a lot of water before you can lose weight so the body can keep itself cool. The more calories you are going to burn the more water your body will take in. You should be happy; your body is putting on a lot of weight that means you are going to lose a lot of weight. If you want to speed up the process start drinking more liquids. I remember hearing on Discovery Health, before you can lose weight you have to gain weight.

[Da fuck did I just hear]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_BvpLLe-A)

&gt;Eris: Thanks mom, I really just want to start wearing my new clothes. 

Mom: Let’s just get over this phase quickly, how about I take you to Costco and we get you some Gatorade. It’s packed full of ions and it will help you get your water levels up and ions level up as well.

**Author’s Rant**

I hate when idiots use the word ‘ion’; I have studied chemistry, it just means a charged particle. There is nothing magical about them and they exist everywhere in nature. Put salt in water, bam fluid with a bunch of *ions*.

**Resuming**

So Eris and mom went to Costco and bought enough Gatorade to supply the 2014 Olympics (it’s so nice to see that food stamps go to the people that really need it!)

Eris starts drinking a lot of Gatorade; in her mind she isn’t doing it for personal gratification (Bottle of Gatorade ~300 Calories), but because she whole heartedly believes this will help her lose weight. 
[Artist Depiction]( http://i.imgur.com/gZUEXX4.png) of her consumption behaviors.

As time progressed Eris continued to gain weight while her faith in her mother’s words faded. Even the [Mighty Oz](http://i.imgur.com/qbgGAqX.jpg) and his promises of weight loss were questioned.

 Sadly the idea of cutting down on food and exercising was never thought of as valid options to counter the weight gain. It has been decided that the meat filled salad will be returning so she doesn’t put on more weight. 

&gt;L O L 
 
Home life started getting worse and worse, lucky for me work plus hanging out with friends saved me from much of the drama. 

&gt;Come home from hanging out with Britney and Nekane 

We have been hanging out together without Eris; Eris has no idea that we do stuff without her now. 

&gt;Go to open house through garage code… not working odd

&gt;Ring on the doorbell… no one answers

It is obvious that they are home, but for some reason they are ignoring me. Britney and Nekane are still parked outside the house, so I tell them what is going on and Britney offers to let me to stay at her place.

&gt;An hour passes by

&gt;I get a phone call from Mom.

&gt;Mom: Ares where the fuck are you? Me and your sister have been worried sick.

&gt;Me: You guys locked me out don’t act dumb

&gt;Mom: your sister did that only to punish you, now you return home at once. 

&gt;Me: punish me for what?

&gt;Mom: I don’t know, just come home

&gt;Me: So you knew she was locking me out yet you didn’t say anything?

&gt;Mom: come home before I tell your father about this

&gt;Me: Go ahead.

&gt;Hear glass shatter through the phone 

&gt;Hang up

&gt;2 seconds later,  call from Eris

&gt;Me: What do you want?

&gt;Eris: Leave Britney’s house right now

&gt;Me: How’d you know I am at Britney’s house?

&gt;Eris: I just know, now come the fuck home

&gt;Me: Night

&gt;Hang up the phone and turn it off

Next morning Britney’s mom drops me off home after I have breakfast with them. I ring the door bell this time they answer.

&gt;Mom: I told your dad about what you did; he wants you to call him right now

&gt;Don’t answer, make my way to Eris’s room

&gt;Go to check my laptop it has bacon piece on it…Eris must have went through my laptop

&gt;Open it up.. God Dam, bitch was looking at my inbox on Facebook (had log in set to remember me) on top of that she had her Russian rape porn in another tab. 

She must have found out that her friends and I have been sending nasty messages about her behind her back . In all fairness, they were accurate accounts of her behavior, but I can understand why she was upset. 

&gt;I call my dad

He is upset and warns me that this is the only home I got and he isn’t going to pay for me to live in a dorm. 

&gt; I explain to him the full story including my face book comments.

&gt;He tells me to first of all, put a password on my computer (like many of you suggested in the comments) 

&gt;Second that mom is a “fucking lunatic” (why he divorced her) and to expect her to pull this type of shit

&gt;Third that I am not going to be able to change what other people do, just do what I can do to prolong my stay, even if mom and Eris are in the wrong.

&gt;Eris wakes up

&gt;We have breakfast together no one says anything 

&gt;After breakfast Eris and I begin talking about what happened

&gt;Me: First of all I want to apologize for my comments about you, you didn’t deserve that

&gt;Eris: I always loved you, and you say those things behind me back? To those whores

&gt;Me: I shouldn’t have done that, I was just trying to make some friends around here; I don’t really have any friends since I moved here 

(I am lying, I have plenty of friends)

&gt;Eris: Did they always hate me?

&gt;Me: Uhh what?

&gt;Eris: Britney and Nekane, were they ever my friends?

&gt;Me: I don’t know them that well to tell you

&gt;Eris: the first day they met you, they liked you more than me

&gt;Eris starts to cry… oh god

&gt;I go to comfort her, she starts going into a wheezing cry, where she has to stop to catch her breath

Wanted to originally confront her for using my computer looks like that won’t be happening. 
Fucking women, social masterminds.

&gt;Eris: I get it, you like Britney more than me

&gt;Me: you are my sister, you know I love you more than her

&gt;Eris: then why did you let her sit on your lap but pushed me off

**Wait a second…things start popping into my head**

-incest searches
-sitting on my lap
-fapping loudly
-jealousy between her and Britney

[Brain blast!]( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx31xuUmlG1r3bteso6_250.gif)

**Eris has feelings for me! And I told her I loved her more than Britney FUCK **


&gt;So there I was, thousands of miles away from home

&gt;In hostile lands

&gt;With crying sister next to me, thinking I just confessed my love to her.

**End of Part III**

**Message to readers**

I know many of you are thinking; now it clicks for you? Well looking back, her advances were obvious, but at the time, I thought trying to be funny or purposely trying to make things awkward. I never thought of my sister in that way, and assumed she would never look at me that way. (People that have opposite sex siblings understand)

Those that are curious about why I didn’t move out, I will explain that as well. My dad was already paying ~40k a year for tuition and I did not have the audacity to ask him for more nor did I want to. I was offered residence at friends’ homes however I could not accept being a burden.  
As always if you have any questions or request any clarification let me know!

**TL-Dr**

Eris locks me out of house because I have been hanging out with her friends without her. I apologize to her and realize she has feelings for me. 

**Question to the Mods and Readers** 

In writing these stories there is a lot that I am excluding from the stories for the sake of sticking to the sub-reddit’s rules. From the comments most people are deeply interested in the plot so I was hoping if I could get an exemption from the normal rules. This does not mean that my stories will contain no fat logic and gluttony; it is that I won’t skip over important parts of the story to get to the next instance of fat logic.

&gt;Neons flicker

&gt;Ground shakes

&gt;Fade in wheezy breathing

&gt;Fade in Eau de Ashtray perfume

&gt;Turn around, and at the counter stands (somehow) a monstrous glob of fat, probably about 5'3 and at least 300 lbs. Wearing a floral bedsheet with a hole in it for her head.

&gt;Call her HamPeezza, a name that will take all of its terrible meaning in a few moments.

&gt;HamPeezza's breathing sounds like she just ran a half-marathon while drowning. Sweat rolls down her pale squishy face.

&gt;I greet her. She ignores the greeting. She starts speaking, taking a breath every two words.

&gt;""YAR AISLES. ARE TOO SMAHLL.""

&gt;I'msorrywut?

&gt;""YAR AISLES. TOO SMAHLL. CAN BARELY MOVE. AM HANDICAPPED. YOUR AISLES. HAVE TO BE LARGE ENOUGH. FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. IS THE LAW.""

&gt;Look around the shop. At least 5 feet between shelves.

&gt;""How may I help you ma'am?""

&gt;HamPeezza takes out a dirty, half crumpled news article. She begins telling me how many copies she wants, but she starts to cough. And cough.

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/um-no.gif) she produces a half-full 2L bottle of Coke out of nowhere and chugs it down. Coughing subsides for a second, then starts again. Wet and rattling.

&gt;At this point everybody in the shop is just staring. Manager gets out of his office, looking alarmed.

&gt;""You ok ma'am?"" Manager asks. ""Do you want me to call--""

&gt;HamPeezza waves her hand at Manager in a shooing gesture, dismissing him. Goes on coughing and wheezing. Everybody in the shop just waiting for her to either stop coughing or drop dead.

&gt;Then it happens.

&gt;Liquid runs down her enormous thigh and puddles on the floor.

&gt;She just peed.

&gt;*Peed.*

&gt;Carries on explaining about the copies she wants as if nothing happened.

And here goes. We're going to try a real life green text story. If you like it better or worse than my old stories please let me know. 


&gt;Be about five months ago

&gt;TR and I both had an awful day

&gt;Drowning our sorrows in wine because we're adults. 

&gt;EP comes home, decides to insert herself into our conversation 

&gt;Night before had (literally) broken down crying about how TR and I never include her in anything

&gt;We do, but TR and I are very close friends and thus hang out with each other more than we do with EP 

&gt;Because of fit the night before, don't have the heart to tell her to go away. 

&gt;EP decides for us that we need to eat our feelings. 

&gt;Bakes cookies, makes bacon while cookies are in oven because ""bacon solves everything."" WTF is with this woman and bacon.

&gt;Bacon is pretty awesome but neither TR or I want any

&gt;EP says shut up and eat my bacon

&gt;TR and I split a piece to shut her up

&gt;She made the whole package

&gt;She eats what we don't. 

&gt;... we had *one* piece. 

&gt;EP says to TR, ""no wonder why you're so skinny."" 

&gt;TR looks like she's about to cry. 

&gt;I say that's not cool. 

&gt;EP ignores me takes the opportunity of awkward silence to steer the conversation to be about herself. 

&gt;No man loves her, she's going to be alone forever. 

&gt;The only person to ever care about her is her ex, and he's a douchebag so she's never talking to him again. 

&gt;No seriously, he's a douchebag. 

&gt;Guys did you hear, EP's ex is a douche. 

&gt;fuck. 

&gt;Cookies are done. 

&gt;TR and I decline cookies. 

&gt;EP gets angry, eat my fucking cookies. 

&gt;No. =/ 

&gt;Fine, whatever. EP eats an entire sheet of 12 cookies over the next hour. 

&gt;TR and I don't get to talk any more. 

&gt;EP is miserable because she tried to go shopping and ""all the stores have been adjusting their sizes to be smaller, now she can't even fit in a large and has to find stores that carry XL jackets."" 

&gt;No EP, you're gaining weight, this is real life. 

&gt;""At least girls like TR can find cute clothes, everything looks good on them."" 

&gt;TR says she never finds clothes that fit. 

&gt;TR says XSs are either too big or too short. 

&gt;TR says shopping sucks just as much for her. 

&gt;EP disagrees: at least she can get bigger clothes and belt them and still look ""smoking hot."" 

&gt;TR says no, she's so skinny it's gross, she hates it, I'm paraphrasing.

&gt;EP actually tells her to shut up. 

&gt;TR is so upset she is indulging in alcohol to feel better (we aren't big drinkers), and EP tells her to shut up. 

&gt;At least boys find TR attractive, she says. 

&gt;At least she looks hot in everything. 

&gt;She has it so easy. 

&gt;BR shows up just as I'm about to murder EP. 

&gt;Senses something is wrong. 

&gt;""I'll make some tea, everyone seems like they could use some tea."" 

&gt;Best roommate ever. 

&gt;Tries to help me and TR steer the conversation in a different direction. Asks how my appointments went, etc, like a good friend. 

&gt;EP is having none of it. 

&gt;Keeps coming back to clothes shopping and boys. 

&gt;Fuck off EP 

&gt;EP says she just doesn't understand why stores cater so much to skinny people. 

&gt;BR says he can't find clothes that fit, either, and he's super skinny as well. 

&gt;""Yeah well it's different for boys."" Fricking hell... 

&gt;Tea is ready

&gt;BR makes best tea. It's magical. Mixes it and hands it out. 

&gt;Everyone begins to happily drink

&gt;EP scoops two big spoonfuls of sugar into small teacup. 

&gt;""Okay, seriously, am I the only one who actually wants sugar in their tea?""

&gt;Yes. You ask this almost every day. 

&gt;""What's the point of having it if you don't even enjoy the taste? At that point you're only drinking for the sake of drinking. You all have let loose every once in a while."" 

&gt;BR makes tea for everyone 3x/day at least and every time she scoops in sugar. 

&gt;She says she can't handle people right now. 

&gt;Storms off. 

&gt;Bitches everyone out the next morning for leaving a mess in the kitchen after she cooked ""for everyone."" 

&gt;No one else ate her food. 

**TL;DR:** Roommate on her way to being a planet makes greasy food, demands we eat our feelings as a household together, forces conversation to revolve around her, and her fatlogic, with a hint of Thin Privilege preaching. British Roommate saves the day with tea. 

I have more stories from her that I will be sharing. She's getting worse. Most days she's alright and is sometimes straight up friendly and good to be around, but waaaay too often she does shit like this and it's getting more frequent. "	t5_2vzax	True

1375895760.0	1jw83d	Muh Muh at the Hamily Reunion: Granny vs Hammy, The Final Showdown	ConfectionAffection	406	88	52	"So this is one of the last stories I have for you curvies about Muh Muh, and, in fact, it’s a second hand story. This incident occurred at a hamily reunion around the beginning of June; one that I, sadly, ~~avoided like the plague~~ was unable to attend. Batten down the jimmies, if my previous stories put them in a rustled state.

A month or so ago, I was home for a weekend and visiting granny (the same granny from [Auntie Ham’s Brush with Death]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dvoo0/auntie_hams_brush_with_death/)), catching up on the family gossip. Among the things discussed (many would make excellent stories but, sadly, don’t include material suitable for this sub), granny brought up the recent hamily reunion. I didn’t think much of it, since Muh Muh (which is now synonymous with Auntie Ham and Auntie Hamuh Muh, if you don’t know why read [this series]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3diw/the_long_awaited_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_i_muh_muhs/)) never comes to these reunions due to her shut-in personality type and lack of general mobility. Until granny utters this mini rant:

“And you’ll never guess who was there! All the sudden, your cousin Muh Muh just pops right out of her van with her new boyfriend! Oh, and she was so witchy too! You wouldn’t believe the way she sasses me, I don’t know who she thinks she is speaking to me the way she does.”

I suddenly can’t breathe at hearing her IRL name, Muh Muh has not been brought up in conversation for quite some time. I decide on my tactic to get granny to continue with this conversation, hoping for some greasy story material. Nothing gets her going like talking about other people’s scandalous weight gains and losses. I ask:

“Well, how is she doing? I heard she’s gaining some of that weight back?”

“Oh, well you know I shouldn’t gossip about grandpa’s family…” she retorts

Grandpa mutters something about how “Muh Muh’s a damn cow,” I stifle a laugh.

“Well I was just curious,” says I nonchalantly. Granny takes the bait, and spends the next half an hour telling me every single detail. But, guise, she doesn’t like to gossip.

So granny and grandpa are sitting there on a hot June day under a tent at the hamily reunion, chatting with grandpa’s relatives. Well, grandpa isn’t because he hates these people (one of the attendees, a brother of Muh Muh’s, once held a shotgun to grandpa’s face, so he has every right). But granny, being the good catholic that she is, has forgiven and forgotten. And also loves to talk. 

Hammy behavior abounds, as it’s feedin’ time. Muh Muh’s three brothers and two of her sisters (including [Socioham]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jkaue/my_sociohamthick_cousin/)) are all there, chain smoking, torturing folding chairs to death, drinking, and, of course, eating their body weight in mountains of southern-esque food. This food is provided by the one sane sister in the family who somehow attained a normal job and married a normal, middle class guy. The normal two are the hosts. 

Perhaps granny would’ve felt the gravitational shift that would have warned of an incoming lump of Darwin-defyin’ flesh, had the mass of planets in attendance not already been disrupting the fabric of space time. Legend has it the hamily cannot congregate for more than a couple of hours, lest they throw the earth out of orbit. 

Nonetheless, up the driveway chugs the big brown Astrovan, and out oozes everyone’s favorite hammy, the dearest Muh Muh. She (slowly) stands on one leg, whilst bellowing inside the van about hurryin’ uph, “cuz her knee~~s ache~~ aches.” From the passenger side comes her surprisingly normal looking, middle aged boytoy, with a bariatric wheelchair. 

Muh Muh is summarily dumped into said wheel chair, while 
Daughtermoon rolls out of the van towards the congregation, greeting everyone with childlike enthusiasm entirely inappropriate for her age. It’s a topic of conversation in my family that she likely has a mental disorder, and has grown up too isolated, resulting in poor social skills.

Muh Muh has clearly regressed after losing so much weight, but is still far lighter than her 650ish max. Granny said she’d probably gained back 50 lbs from her lightest, so maybe around 350 lbs, which remember is minus one leg.  She’s 6’0, for reference, all these cousins are monstrously large in every dimension. Time has not been kind to Muh Muh, her skin now resembles that of a bloated [naked mole rat](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/05/article-0-14D90002000005DC-639_634x463.jpg), large dark brown moles pockmark her cheeks, and her hair is beginning to grey noticeably. Daughtermoon (who I have seen recently, that’s the last story to come) is around 300 lbs, 5’8ish. 

As luck would have it, Muh Muh is wheeled up directly to sit next to granny. Granny nods a hello, but cannot say anymore, since at that second Muh Muh bellows at her boyfriend to collect a trough full of beetus for her cuz she’s sturvin’ and needs tuh eat. He scrambles into the house, granny chooses to ignore the beast, thinking back on her [previous antics]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dvoo0/auntie_hams_brush_with_death/). 

Muh Muh used huff. It’s not very effective. Muh Muh used huff again. Granny is getting annoyed. Muh Muh uses whirlwind huff of doom, granny relents:

“So how are you Muh Muh, I haven’t seen you out getting the mail much latel—”

“Oh muh gawd, aunt granny, uh swurr tuh gawd uh cayn’t do nuthin these days! Muh beetus has been real bad lately, and muh knee is actin up sumthin fierce,” Muh Muh says.

Probably the weight gain, granny thinks. Common sense dictates that is the wrong thing to say, she instead settles for: “Oh, I’m sorry to hear th—“

“AY! AY, BUCK! LEMME BUM ONE UH THEM SMOKES, WOULD’JUH?” Muh Muh yells to one of her brothers.

He relents, throws a smoke and lighter. Muh Muh lights up like her life depends on it. 

“I thought you’d quit smoking, Muh Muh?” granny asks. 

“Tuh!” Muh Muh scoffs, “well yeah, the docturs said I shoul’n be smokin’ any moar but what the hell duh they know?”

“They already took muh leg, and now uh got a bum knee in t’other one. They said lose sum weight, and I did an’ I ain’t feelin’ any better. 
Dem docturs don’ know nuthin, uh swear to gawd,” Muh Muh declares.

This brief speech has deprived her of nicotine for too long, she inhales half the cig in one draw. 

Granny is practically speechless at this point. She makes a poor choice and attempts to reason with the whale. 

“But, Muh Muh, they took your leg because you had an infection caused by your diabetes. If they wouldn’t have taken it, you’d have died.”

“Well [14 year old cousin] has the beetus an they ain’t taken her leg!” Muh Muh counters.

For the record, my 14 year old cousin has the genetic/autoimmune flavor of diabetes (type I), and keeps it under control with an insulin pump, diet control, and a ton of exercise.  

Granny considers explaining this, doesn’t bother. Instead, she makes a second mistake and by asking another question.

“So what’s wrong with your other knee?” 

“Oh, gawd, uh gotta have it replaced cuz uh got duh arthritus an’ [bursitus]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursitis) in it cuz I been overusin’ it. Uh mean, uh have tuh use it it’s the only one uh gawt left!” the whale chortles.

“Uh gots me a lawyer too!” Muh Muh says proudly.

“What do you need a lawyer for?” granny asks incredulously.

“Cuz it’s them docturs’ fault that uh gots the arthritus an’ bursitus! If they wouldn’t’uh taken muh other leg, I wouldn’t be havin’ this problem an’ ah got’s me uh lawyer to go after em!”

Granny is in shock at this point. And angry, that was made clear to me during our conversation. If you haven’t read my other stories, you’ll realize that 100% of Muh Muh’s inane amount of medical care that she has received over the years has been paid for by Medicaid and a variety of other free avenues, hence the biting irony. 

So, to recap: Muh Muh intends to sue the doctors that saved her life for free from an acute disease she brought on by her own lifestyle choices (also paid for by the government via WIC, welfare, foodstamps, etc.) for performing said procedure.  She also justified her accusations against the evil doctors by comparing herself to my 14 year old cousin that has the genetic variety of diabetes (type 1) and takes excellent care of herself.

Needless to say, granny got up and left with grandpa to go in the house. Nothing works granny up like the overuse and abuse of Medicaid/Medicare, which she’s seen at length working as a nurse for 40+ years in a trash-filled, small town hospital. 

When the story was over, I was just kind of sitting there trying to internalize everything she’d told me. It was silent for a second, until grandpa mutters:

“Just a goddamn cow, is all.”

Then we went to Pizza Hut.

1367103386.0	1d8p08	Counselor Hamm'e	carboxcylicacid	389	67	41	"I worked at my schools STEM summer camp a few summers ago. The absolute worst part of this job was having to interact with Hamm'e, the most entitled, rude whale I have ever met. For a while after having to work with her I hated fat people, sorority girls, and became ever so slightly racist. I blocked her from memory until I saw her on campus a few weeks ago. This all came flooding back

**Background** (skip if you want)

&gt;Be me

&gt;At first meeting for all camp counselors

&gt;Gonna teach kids motha fuckin science!

&gt;Head counselor is calling peoples names, have them stand up and tell everyone something about themselves

&gt;""Hammy, please stand up and tell us about yourself""

&gt;I hear a faint growl in the back of the room

&gt;Suddenly the building is vibrating, the lights flicker

&gt;The beast struggles to raise herself, decides against standing, and instead roars from her couch

&gt;IT'S PRUhNOUNCEEED HAMM-AYYYYY, MMMKAYYYY?

&gt;Da fuq? 

&gt;She again tries to stand, this time succeeding but drops her purse on the floor

&gt;Oh, wait, it's a bucket of KFC

&gt;I can now see her gloriously curvalicousness in full view

&gt;Like a tootsie pop dipped in cottage cheese

&gt;She's 5'7, 300 pounds, and it's all from the waist up. Her legs look human sized, put her top half is completely round. 

&gt;Her muffin top is all that, processed grain and full fat

&gt;Her double chin is so severe I can't even see any trace of a jaw bone existing

&gt;She then goes into a spiel about her sorority, 'sisters', being from the D, and her disdain for the outdoors

&gt;Like she could squeeze out of doors

&gt;Not sure how to recover from that, we just try to move on and not think about what the next six weeks will be like

**TL;DR** ITS PRONOUNCED HAMM-AYYYYYYY

Onward to the fat logic! The first three weeks we had 100 girls from Detroit. They all had strong, loud personalities, but I truly enjoyed working with them. The exceptions were Laqueefa and DaQueefster. These mini hams were orbiting around Hamm'e at all times, and they learned so much from her. 

&gt;Be assigned chaperon duty for the campers going off the main campus to their classes. 

&gt;helpinkidscrossthestreet.likeaboss

&gt;Two kids are late to the meeting spot

&gt;Its Laqueefa and DaQueefster

&gt;suprising.notreally

&gt;Both 5' nothing, about 200 pounds

&gt;Went inside to the dining hall

&gt;Giant black hole in the center of the room

&gt;Its gravitational forces pull me toward it

&gt;It's Hamm'e and the Queef sisters

&gt;They each have three plates of food-eggs, bacon, toast, cereal, a pound of cream cheese, and soda

&gt;SODA

&gt;As part of a complete breakfast

&gt;""Hey guys, we're running late to class and I need you two to come with me""

&gt;Hamm'e is not pleased I'm taking her audience away from her

&gt;'RUDE. WE'RE CONVERSATIN OVER HERE. MIND YA OWN BIZNEZZ'

&gt;The queefsters snicker, and shove food down their gullet. 

&gt;I try to reason with Hamm'e, since it is our job to get them to class

&gt;""SUM PEOPLES HAVE NO MANNERS. OH LAWD, HELP ME JESUS. WE GOTS TO FINISH OUT FOOD, WHY YOU SKINNY ASSES ALWAYS WANTIN US TO BE WASTEFUL""

&gt;I give up, tell them to finish eating and meet me outside

&gt;Another counselor agrees to take my kids up to their class while I wait for the planets to finish feasting

&gt;Ten minutes later the mini planets lumber outside and immediately complain about the energy required to stand unassisted

&gt;ifeelsobadforyou.tinyviolin

&gt;We have to walk maybe 100 yards to the cross walk, cross the road, and go two blocks up a hill to their building

&gt;Non-stop bitching from the hams

&gt;We have to stop every 15 feet so they can catch their breath

&gt;Laqueefa complains about how much movement this camp requires

&gt;They are also displeased with the limited access to the dining hall

&gt;3 meals a day. Just like Auschwitz.

&gt;""GURLLL I LOST 15 DAYUUM POUNDS IN TWO DAYUUM WEEKS""

&gt;I congratulate her 

&gt;They both shoot daggers at me

&gt;""I THOUGHT YOU WAS SMART. HAMM'E NEEDS TO HAVE A TALK WIT CHU.""

&gt;lol.wut

&gt;""LOSING TOO MUCH WEIGHT GIVES YOU DIABEEETUS. IT MAKES YO SHUGAAA LEVELS DROP AN' YO BODY CAN'T MAKE NO MO INS'LIN. HAMM'E SAYS YOU GOTS TO KEEP THE SAME WEIGHT. SHE GOT DIABETUS WHEN SHE LOST WEIGHT AND HAD TA GAIN IT BACK. SHE DON'T HAVE NO MO DIABEETUS""

&gt;[mrw](http://i.imgur.com/UnFnF.gif)

&gt;Before my brain can even wrap itself around that logic, they move on to discussing how terrible I was at being a counselor

&gt;They grumble about me ""MAKIN' US WALK ALL DEES DAYUM HILLS 'N SHIT.""

&gt;""YEA, HAMM'E DRIVES US. SHE CARES ABOUT OUR SAFETY""

The school provided vehicles for the camp to use, but counselors could only use them for specific event or errands. It was against all of the rules to use them without a legitimate cause. I had no idea how to respond to this, so I just silently dropped them off (it took 20 minutes to get them to class). I went back to the counselor break room where we keep a binder we fill with stories about campers (if they annoy us, talk back, do something entertainingly stupid) and wrote an anonymous summary of their comments. I did this mostly because Hamm'e had been such a bitch to me, but also because we could potentially face legal issues if she got into an accident and other kids would demand rides everywhere. The head counselors read it and Hamm'e supposedly got a 'stern' talking to, but no kind of punishment. 

**TL;DR** Hamm'e introduces a new flavor of fat logic to campers and gives the medical community a breakthrough in diabetes research-it turns out it's caused by losing weight.

[MFW](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z9wj1i9MtOg/UXb7zlppUhI/AAAAAAAAuX0/4sBGsYMYR_Q/w500/Confused_Mr._shue.gif)

I look around, and I almost go blind from seeing what I didn't want or expect to see. Planet Chubbs is back and on the treadmills at it's absolute lowest speed watching Supernatural.

&gt;WTF.jpg

Planet Chubbs was permabanned a few days ago for basically being what in Scotland, we'd call a fat cunting bastard. But since this is 'Murica and people get mad at me for slinging cunt around like upvotes in FPS, I don't get to use it often. Moving on.

I don't want to cause a scene, I'm there to work out, not be a bitch. I appear to have made a friend though, Chubbs has apparently forgotten I complained vocally to the staff about her behaviour and beckons me over to the machine next to her.

&gt;FUCKNO

&gt;get on treadmill as far as fuck away from her as possible

Apparently this displeases Jabba, so she gets off hers and starts waddling towards me, presumably to use the one next to me. But before her horribly quivvering ass can get to the machine, I am saved by he who shall henceforth be known as HBG [Hot Blond Guy].

&gt;[THANKYOUGREATBEETUSINTHESKY]

Apparently this isn't so bad. Chubbs gets on the treadmill on his other side. The bed of the treadmill seems to buckle under her enormous ass. Supernatural gets put back on. These machines are slightly different from the one she was on before, the screen is smaller, and lower, and the displays are different. I prefer them because they have a workout programme with your choice of Armed Forces basic training workout tests.

&gt;PLANET CHUBBS CANNOT FIGURE OUT MACHINE.

**""HAAAAY ^teehee CAN YOU HELP MEH PUT DA TEEEBEEE ORN? I DORNKNOW HOW THESE MACHINEZ WORRRK. ^tee^fucking^hee""**

She asks HBG. HBG worldessly reaches over and presses some buttons and goes back to his jog. He didn't even take his headphones out. Chubbs all but licks his arm like it's a prize roast ham. HBG is visibly disgusted. 

&gt;HBG starts chatting to me

&gt;Talk how fucking awesome Hawks are.

&gt;Stanley cup 2013

&gt;chicagopride.muthafuckas


Chubbs is not pleased that HBG is ignoring her WOMANLY CUUURFFFFS and choosing the ANOREXIC TWIGLET over her. Must have some kind of sixth sense, because I glance over to see that arm reachin over, and them lips bein licked with concentration as she's about to pull out that earbud.

&gt;OHDOUBLEFUCKNO


She just manages to get a hold of it when HBG jumps away, landing on the sides of the speeding treadmill with a shout.

""WTF MAN, WHO EVEN DOES THAT?""

Slobberomnomnom Milosevich has no shame. He's got the earbuds out and he's talkin to her. Apparently success.

She starts talking over him tellin him all about how she's leavin her kid's babydaddy because he's some kind of deadbeat, she's lookin for a real man. 

&gt;Manmeat to be precise.

**""YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD HANDLE A RRRREEEEEEAAAAL WUMMIN OF MUH STATUUUURE...JUST GOTTA BE GENTLE COZ I GOTSA""** [waaait for it...]

&gt;...

&gt;...


&gt;.....waiiiiit....

&gt;for

&gt;it....


**THE BEETUS. IT MESSIN WITH MY THIGHROID.""**

HBG neither believes this nor cares.

&gt;visibly irritated.

""Ma'am, I don't know who you are, please leave me alone to work out in peace. I don't want to talk to you.""

THIS DISPLEASES SLOBBEROMNOMNOM MILOSEVICH aka PLANET CHUBBS. Immediately launches into tirade about how he is being a total cocktease and how it's sizist and racist that he's choosing to talk to the ""ANORECTIC SMACK ADDICT"" than to speak to a real woman like her. How clearly he is a dog with a bone.

&gt;run whiteknight.exe

""Ma'am, my girlfriend and I are leaving. You are making it extremely difficult to work out in peace.""

We walk off. Leave Chubbs screaming and raging about me being a ""SMACK HO"" and ""YER JUST RACIST AND SIZIST, CLEARLY A FAGGOT"".

We both point out to staff that she's back. Police come to escort her from building, take statement from HBG about her homophobic slurs and verbal assaults. HBG and I go for coffee. I feel bad, I'm engaged, but he seems like a nice guy. HBG turns out, is gayer than Neil Patrick Harris as Dr Frankenfurter in a Broadway musical. He felt bad that she was slagging me off and kinda wanted to rub it in her face, as he got the feeling she'd done it before. HBG and I are now friends.

************************************

**TL;DR**
Hamplanet who previously got banned from Y managed to slip in without staff realizing during a dead period and tried to be a total bitch. Was rescued by a well fit guy who white knighted the shit out of her when she was slagging me off, and turns out to be new gay bestie.


e; I had to add this because I found the perfect descriptor. When we left the Y to go get coffee, Chubbs was screamin up a storm about how bullshit it was that ""Smack hos and Faggots"" was gettin her arrested, doin that whole Randy Marsh ""I THOUGHT THIS WAS 'MURICA"" thing.

I work at a gas station that churns out these little grease pizzas that make your stomach turn after one bite, fatties luhhh dat pizza. 

&gt;Be me, 19, cashier at a janky gas station

&gt;Gas station has a deli. Grease buffet. The sun that the hamplanets orbit around. 

&gt;Working lunch rush like a baws, ringing up pizzas, subs, breadsticks, horrifying hamburgers, and what have you. 

&gt;Earth shakes

&gt;Grip cash register, fear gravitational pull will rip me from behind the counter

&gt;Fatty McFatterton approaches. 

&gt;Apppears to have stolen some nice floral drapes and pinned them around her glorious curves

&gt;Moar rolls than a bakery

&gt;Approaches with a supreme Pizza, 32 oz pop, Cheesy breadsticks, chips, and a 6 inch sub. 

&gt;throws loyalty card at me

&gt;Gas station is shitty so each item has to be separately rung into our fancy device and her magnetic strip seems to have vanished from grease-paw handling and excessive usage. 

&gt;Hear various grunts and moans as I slowly enter items into the machine, sorry not sorry you fucking slob. 

&gt;Finally finish, ask if she would like a bag (I've heard making people carry their items sans bag induces thyroid flare-ups.) 

&gt;""OF COURSE"" ahhh, fuck me for asking right. 

&gt;Reach for pizza, meet greasy sausages at the edge of the cardboard ""LEAVE THE PIZZA OUT."" She grumbles as she rips the pizza from my hands

&gt;Time slows as I watch in horror

&gt;Pizza flies out of sub-par box and travels through the air like the most marvelous greasy disk of 'beetus.

&gt;crashes to the ground, mushrooms, olives, sausage, and sauce scattered about the floor.

&gt;Fellow cashier and assistant manager rushes from behind counter to collect scattered contents, being the sweet woman she is, offers new pizza for McGirth

&gt;McGirth denies, grumbles, and puts the pizza on the counter. 

&gt;Swiftly move pizza into the garbage, as our entry-way is disgustingly dirty and horrifically unsanitary. Could probably be sued if we let birds eat it.

&gt;Hand the woman cash for the refunded pizza.

&gt;Head of fatty retracts, presents all 14 realms of chin

&gt;""WUT EEZ ZEES?"" squinty eyes attempt to understand

&gt;""This is the refund for your pizza. I threw it away"" 

&gt;""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT I SAID I WANTED THE PIZZA!"" because as you all know, the dirt of the shoes of strangers is the BEST pizza topping.

&gt;So flustered, can not understand desire to eat floor pizza... Shocked briefly and begin spouting out professional sounding words.

&gt;Attempt various calming methods and justify throwing away icky pizza. 

&gt;Assistant manager also attempts calming methods. Fat doth not understand

&gt;Fatty fat fat requests the presence of our actual manager

&gt;Manager approaches, says everything I said with a more sympathetic and gopher-looking face. Fatty is not pleased. 

&gt;Anger caused face to heat, boils layer of grease upon the rotund face of the customer

&gt;Snatches plastic bag off of counter and tells us that she will not be returning to our gas station for lunch EVAR again.

&gt;Manager shrugs and I mourn the loss of hammy's patronage. 


TL;DR Fat lady drops pizza, I throw it away, she gets pissed because she enjoys dirt.

1375196480.0	1jcnrq	The fat-sister from hell	synthiis	394	77	55	"Gather round, people for this is a long story. A story of pounds and kilo, a story of psychotic behaviour, borderline personality and manipulation to no ends.

A little background is in order. I've been with my SO for more than 6 years now, and her sister has been trouble for about that much, and after reading the rage-tastic story on here, I felt selfish not to share the amount of stupid, lazy, incredibly lard-ass, psycho and stuff from her. I mean. Why do I have to be the only one suffering from this shit?!

So, since you just LOVE number crunching about weight, height and stuff, here are some:

*    Me: 25 yo, around 180 cm (5'11'), a few pounds on me to put me around 92 kg (210 pounds)

*    SO: 25 yo, around 175 cm (5'9"" ), same for her with about 112 kg (250 pounds)  

*    The fat-sister (now named Sam): 19 yo, around 160 cm (5'3""), and a hefty 132 kg (295 pounds)

Since there's such a beautiful personality on this person, these stories, because there will be more than one of course.. After 6 years, you gotta expect a lot of shit that has gone by. Like I was saying, these stories will not be sorely about FATLOGIC, because even if she uses it, there's so much more incoherence and shit that goes through her head that it can't be humanly possible be the only source of all the stupid that goes through her mouth and actions. At this point, I'll introduce..  
* **  
* **SAMLOGIC**

* **

Without further ado, here goes the first story.. The time that we met for the first time..

&gt;be me, young and innocent 19 yo

&gt;introduced for the first time to my step family  

&gt;mom and dad are alright, dad love to tell puns and be funny

&gt;mom is actually still pretty (awww yiiiisssss, guess my SO will be the same)

&gt;ask my SO: ""Didn't you have a sister too?""

&gt; [tfw](/i.imgur.com/uJfwO.gif) the memories of her existance is brought back to them

&gt;ominious sounds coming from somewhere in the house

&gt;whatdidIdo... Did I summon Cthulhu or some other worldly beast?

&gt;I wish I did... nothingHasPreparedMeForThis.raw

&gt;as I watch the waves in the glass of water I am holding, I hear a high pitched noise

&gt;""...Ph'nglui mglw'nafh... sandwich""

&gt;I turn around to behold what could have uttered such terrible words

&gt;I behold the horror. A small 12 yo, larger than taller, with hands like claw, ready to rip in any food in proximity

&gt;I hide behind the counter, not knowing what that monstrosity feeds upon

&gt;my SO mom says: ""Sorry, I didn't hear you from down here, you want a sandwich?""

&gt; Sam: ""Nooooo. I'm huuuuuuuuuuuuuuungry. I want twooooo. ""

&gt; she opens the fridge door and grab a bottle of cocktail juice. Not those healthy orange, more like that stuff that is made of sugar and flavoured to some kind of fruit

&gt;grabs some stuff and put it down in front of her mom, pointing at the food

&gt; ""Sandwich..""

At this point, I have to say that I was kinda taken aback. So you order around your mom to make you a sandwich and go to the point of putting the stuff in front of her. Meh, maybe she's just spoiled (Spoiled doesn't even start to describe her)

&gt; after letting that mayo and fatty meat in front of her mom, she waddles to the couch and just flop on it

&gt;hear the floor creek as the extra weight is applied on the poor structure of the house

&gt;""Moooooom.. I'm huuuuuungry!"" sluuuurp ""hurry""

&gt;turns the tv to some disney channel shit

&gt;So. Did I even register in her head at this point? A new guy appear in the house and she doesn't even acknowledge me... Huh

&gt;my SO, noticing that: ""Heum, Sam, I wanted to introduce you to synthiis, my boyfr-""

&gt;SCRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

&gt;faster than she could finish that juice box (who am I kidding, she was already done) she jump back and comes next to me and pushes me

&gt;wut m8?

&gt;Sam: ""Go back to your family you piece of shit, we don't want you here!""

&gt;all of my what?

&gt;my SO grabs my hand and pull me toward the door the dodge the crisis

&gt;hear a spit

&gt;ohnoyoudidnt.midi

&gt;touch the back of my head and feel the spit of the little brat

&gt;turn around and see the look of hatred on her face that I will know for the years to come

&gt;SO pulls me harder outside and closes the door

&gt;one last look to the parents, the image of betaness

&gt;mom is still making the sandwiches

&gt;dad is lighting up a cigarette while going on the patio outside.

&gt;not a words from them

&gt;guess it will be me against the fat.

As this is just to set the tone, I'll write more if you people want to know more about the fat that has been a cancer for me for the last few years. There's a lot more to come and I wanted you people to understand the environment I was going to live in. There were alpha moments in that time, beta moments too.

 I made her cry, I made her hide, I nearly broke her wrist as she became more and more aggressive and had the ""support"" of her parents. There was even moments where she looked into my friends to find a boyfriend (bitch please, like I didn't tell my friends of what you did and if they ever want to get close to you...)

Hope you'll enjoy it as I enjoyed venting about it. 

**TL;DR** : Introduction to the psycho fatso, meet the family of my SO, get spat upon and nearly watched as the house imploded on itself from the gravitational pull of a massive object.

Key for those who don't know who is who. 

&gt; **PorkPlanet:** 300+ easy, mean, rude, spoiled and my Housemate and self-declared ""Best Friend"". 

&gt; **KK:** Housemate, cute, says the funniest shit when need arises, generally avoids the wrath of PorkPlanet and keeps to herself. Told me to start posting stories on this subreddit when she found it one rainy evening. No regrets. 

&gt; **AS:** Housemate, takes no shit from PorkPlanet, hilariously mean to her and the two don't get along very well. Health &amp; Fitness guru to me and the house. Loyal friend. 

&gt; **Cuteguy:** Boyfriend. Currently engaged in a Cold War with PorkPlanet declared by her for my attention. Generally laid back and funny as hell.  

&gt; Occasionally, **MotherMakeIt** makes an appearence (my foster mother). **OtherHouseMate#1** and **OtherHouseMate#2**, though those two generally keep to themselves and don't get caught up in the drama. More recently,  our new neighbors (other students) have made an appearance in my life, also hamplanets: **RedHeadPlanet** (the chief and PorkPlanet's friend from school), **ClothesTooTightBeast** and **WhisperingBeast**. 

&gt;Lastly, I'm **ImGonnaMakeIt**. I'm a recovering HamPlanet, 100lb down (woooohoooo!) and sober of saturated fats for around 10 months. 


----------

My faithful readers. I am terrible sorry for my long gaps in posting stories. The problem is, I have been on Summer Holiday, off doing things and have only returned back to the house, and into PorkPlanets wrath, as of a few weeks ago (my return depicted in [The Neighbours](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i6uty/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_eight_the_neighbours/)). Since I have been back, all I've been doing is working  working working and going on incredibly long and exhausting Bike Rides with Cuteguy in this incredible heat we've had in the UK. 

**Also, I hit the 100lb goal (!!!!!!!!), and joined a rowing club.** July has been a fantastic month. My plan is to lose another 30lb now, as well as work harder than ever to tone up. I'm told this may take a while as the last stretch of weight loss is always the hardest, but I'm keeping Halloween as my goal date in my minds eye, since it was then last year I decided to lose this weight. It should be achievable once my hand is 100% healed and my pins removed, as well as this pesky achy back I keep having. Wish me luck. 

Here is a story from when Myself, Cuteguy, KK, Her boyfriend (Nick), AS and PorkPlanet went on a last-minute vacation to Benidorm, Spain a few weeks ago. It was a fucking nightmare. This story is based on the last (fourth) night. PorkPlanet gets drunk and massively fucks up. 

------------------------

The Holiday had been fine during the days, but horrible during the nights. Usually, PorkPlanet, being a magnified, sunburned version of herself in a foreign place, would get drunk and ruin the evening with her mouth. This story occurred on our final night. 

During the day, we had been to the beach and there was a slight incident where I looked absolutely fabulous in a Bikini for the first time ever in my life (hold it against me). Then PorkPlanet showed up in a black one-piece in 35C heat and had a serious case of breaching bush down below, from not shaving (use your imagination). We didn't tell her about that last part, but CuteGuy was pretty horrified. Her obvious disdain that I was wearing a Bikini set the tone for the rest of the afternoon because she was being a major bitch. 

&gt; In Bar downstairs from Apartment/Hotel building. 

&gt; PorkPlanet is hammered drunk. 

&gt; Some sleazy Spanish dude all over her. 

&gt; Cuteguy wants to go back to Apartment. 

&gt; Not sure if I should leave. 

&gt; AS: Don't worry, you can go, me, KK and Nick will keep an eye on her even if we're a bit drunk, we have to be up early so we wont be late.

&gt; Nick: Teehee I wanna see if she actually has sex. 

&gt; Me: Ew. 

&gt; Me and Cuteguy leave. 

&gt; In Apartment in bedroom. 

&gt; 20 minutes later, door to apartment slams. 

&gt; Bang on our bedroom door. 

&gt; It's AS, drunk. 

&gt; She walks in. 

&gt; AS: Sorry I had to leave them there and come back.

&gt; Me: What's the matter? 

&gt; Porkplanet is down there talking shit about you and Cuteguy. 

&gt; Cuteguy: What on earth is she saying about me? 

&gt; AS: That you were checking out HER and KK at the beach. She's hammered. She thinks you were checking out her legs and how men just can't handle themselves sometimes around bigger women. I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING THESE ARE HER WORDS. She also said ImGonnaMakeIt should of been wearing a swimsuit also because the bikini was not modest and she didn't look good, apparently. What the fuck seriously. 

&gt; I burst into hysterics laughing.  

&gt; Cuteguy: Oh god oh god, ohhhhh god! 

&gt; Me: What? 

&gt; Cuteguy: I'm never gonna be able to have sex again with that mental image in my head. I was looking at her garden hedge because it was right in my face, not her legs. What the fuck? I'm traumatized. 

&gt; We're all in hysterics. 

&gt; AS: Can I sleep in here? They are gonna be back soon and I think she's bringing that weirdo back, and I don't want them banging in the bed next to me, I might catch something. 

&gt; Me: Sure go and sleep on the sofa bed. (There's a sofa bed in our bedroom).

&gt; AS: Ok but promise you wont bang until I am passed out. No more trauma from this holiday please, I've had enough. 

&gt; Cuteguy: I just said I'm never gonna be able to have sex again after what PorkPlanet said and I meant it. 

&gt; We're all now in hysterics. 

Roughly half hour later. 

&gt; Earthquake approaching from down the hall. 

&gt; Sounds like someone fell through apartment door, not walked through it. 

&gt; Hear porkplanet and her amigo enter her and AS's bedroom next door. 

&gt; KK and Nick go into their room down the hall. 

&gt; Lots of banging and laughing happening next door, like they're trashing the place. 

&gt; Sweet silence. 

&gt; Then

&gt; Oh god then. 

&gt; The howling. 

&gt; The screeching.  

&gt; The banging. 

&gt; Either they're having sex or she's being slaughtered for some kind of sacrificial offering. 

&gt; AS: Oh god. 

&gt; Cuteguy is hysterically laughing into his pillow. 

&gt; Me: AS come here. 

&gt; AS climbs into bed next to me. I am inbetween her and Cuteguy. 

&gt; I am holding AS close as the big spoon.  

&gt; AS: I am scared

&gt; We wince every time a howl or bang is made. 

&gt; I put my hands over AS's ears. 

&gt; Cuteguy has his hands over my ears. 

&gt; He  is still hysterically laughing behind me. 

&gt; What are our lives? 

&gt; After about 10 minutes, noise dies down. 

&gt; Peace at last. 

&gt; Cuteguy climbs into AS's sofa bed, and me and AS fall asleep still holding one another in horror. 

5 hours later. Time to get up for flight home. 

&gt; Knock on door. 

&gt; AS being closest to door opens it still laying in bed. 

&gt; PorkPlanet looks awful. Been crying. 

&gt; Me: What's the matter? 

&gt; PorkPlanet: He's gone. 

&gt; AS: And? We're going too in 45 minutes. 

&gt; Me: If you're going to keep having one night stands, you need to learn not to get so attached. We're in Spain for christs sake. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: He took some of our stuff. 

&gt; AS: WHAT STUFF. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: Money, and Jewelry. 

&gt; Me: What?! 

&gt; AS (fuming, as it's her room, too): Not my Money and Jewelry I hope. 

&gt; PorkPlanet (crying): Yeah he took all of our money and most of my Jewelry. 

&gt; AS: PORKPLANET I HAD ABOUT 300 EURO LEFT I WAS GOING TO EXCHANGE AT THE AIRPORT. AND MY TIFANNY BRACELET WAS IN THERE. 

&gt; Cuteguy can't contain his laughter from over the other side of the room. 

&gt; [AS's face when our holiday is ruined in the final hour.](http://images.wikia.com/glee/images/f/fc/Cry-laguna-beach-lauren-conrad-lc-sad-Favim.com-240279.gif)

Luckily, he didn't take our tickets or passports or any of mine and Cuteguys money since they were locked downstairs in safety deposit boxes. But that pretty much summed up the whole holiday - PorkPlanet gets rat-arsed and ruins the night. There was even one incident in the first night where she made a comment about the top I was wearing that I shouldn't wear it because that shit is for ""skinny girls, not bigger girls like us"" even though I am sure I weight 200lb less than her last time I checked. 

AS and PorkPlant still haven't spoken since the holiday. Don't think there friendship will ever repair itself after this. She's not in anyones good books this summer. 

Thanks for reading.

&gt;Be me, junior in high school, 5'5 and 112 pounds

&gt;&gt;Talking with another girl who is taller and skinny

&gt;&gt;Start complaining about never being able to find clothes that fit

&gt;&gt;She agrees, bitchy hamgirl across from her starts to speak up

&gt;&gt;Talks about how hard it is to find clothes because of her size

&gt;&gt;Says they don't make clothes for real girls

&gt;&gt;Says they've changed sizes in recent years

&gt;&gt;Mentions she is the same size as Marilyn Monroe

&gt;&gt;Tell her Marilyn Monroe was around a 36 - 23 - 36

&gt;&gt;Hamgirl pitches a fit and says I'm lying

&gt;&gt;Bothers me about it for the rest of the class

&gt;&gt;I get fed up

&gt;&gt;Whip out iPhone and google Marilyn Monroe's size

&gt;&gt;Show it to her, says I'm lying

&gt;&gt;Tells me that I don't know what I am talking about

&gt;&gt;Show her 5 more sites

&gt;&gt;Show her pictures of Marilyn Monroe

The other day I submitted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1cdgzf/theater_arts_hambeast/) story after some sleepless nights of cramming for creative writing and it was full of egregious hyperbole.  I don't think it's right to leave everyone with such a skewed impression when I have so much shit on this kid, so here goes.

&gt;be high school calculus class

&gt;one would think it would attract the best and brightest

&gt;I guess not

&gt;stuck with Hamifest Destiny as a calc partner

&gt;5'4, ~300lbs, he's only 16

&gt;always smells like urine and kebab unless he bathes in axe

&gt;then he smells like urine and kebab and way too much axe

&gt;we're not allowed to eat in class but he made a big shit about having diabetes

&gt;he's the only one allowed to eat

&gt;always brings in shitty food

&gt;Burgers from Micky D's with mayonnaise as the only topping

&gt;MAYONNAISE

&gt;Whenever I gag at the horrible smell of greasy fast food and his lack of hygiene he tells me I'm not tolerant enough of his condition

&gt;I try as hard as I can to ignore him but it's hard

&gt;I mean really hard

&gt;He likes to brag about not doing work

&gt;""I'm 16 and in calculus cuz maths comes easy to me but I'm just an underachiever that's why I""m failing""

&gt;""I'm totes super smart tho""

&gt;tells me this whenever he fails a test

&gt;like he has to be reassured of this fact

&gt;he has a 23 average in a class with a minimum grade of 50 if you turn  in a blank paper with your name on it

&gt;Fast forward a few weeks

&gt;I usually eat a fantastic breakfast

&gt;dad is a cooking god

&gt;mother is a planning god

&gt;miss breakfast one day because parents are doing parent things

&gt;oh well I'll eat the school's food

&gt;they're serving peanut butter pancakes

I have a serious nut allergy, anaphylaxis and all that shit.  I can die from the smell alone.

&gt;damn, I have to miss breakfast today

&gt;show up to calculus 4th period

&gt;Hamifest Destiny is sitting next to me stuffing his face with Mountain Dew and a family bag of Ruffles

&gt;stomach grumbles

&gt;Hamifest Destiny hears it and pulls his head out of his bag

&gt;He starts yelling at me

&gt;""See, I'm not the one with the problem!  It's so much better to be happy with food in my stomach than to starve myself to be skinny like you!""

&gt;Hamifest Destiny pulls out a footlong snickers and stares at me while he unwraps it

&gt;thisishowidie.midi

&gt;""EAT THIS YOU'LL FEEL BETTER"" he rumbles

&gt;I decline, politely but firmly on the grounds of my allergies

&gt;""IF YOU DIDN'T STARVE YOURSELF YOU WOULD HAVE WORK UP A TOLERANCE TO FOOD, WE NEEDA BUILD YOU TOLERANCE""

&gt;He then *grabs my chin*, forces my mouth open, and SHOVES THE SNICKERS INTO MY MOUTH to the point that I am choking on it.

&gt;I punch him in the face, slap his arms away from me, spit out as much of the snickers as I can but I know I'm going to have a reaction

&gt;iwascorrectinmyassumptions.docx

&gt;""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!""

&gt;Hamifest turns away from me and bawls

&gt;pull the epi-pen out of my fanny-pack (shut up, they're cool) and inject myself

&gt;have to go to the hospital

How do you react to something like this?  He later tried to justify it with his typical ""I have depression I tried to kill myself one time"" and guilt trip me into feeling bad for him.

EDIT: When I say that his depression excuse was ""typical"", I mean that it is typical for him, not that depression is just an excuse to get away with shit.  I wouldn't want to offend anyone living with depression.  I know how hard it can get, I've battled with it myself."	t5_2vzax	True

1375652561.0	1jp9gq	The Trihamthlete.	EATthrowaway	383	66	54	"So, today I experienced an unexpected FPS, whilst volunteering at a full triathlon, it's a 2.4 mile swim, followed by a 112 mile bike ride, followed by a 26.2 mile run. It's fucking intense, people are beyond exhausted by the end of it. Me and my friends were volunteering as bag people; we stand at the side of the road during the bike ride, and people ride up, shout a number at us, we find the bag with that number and stand with them as they dig out snacks/juice/painkillers/kit, whatever they stashed in them earlier. It's not a big job, it's pretty chill, a lot of jumping and running about in the first couple of hours, and most of the athletes are lovely lovely human beings and it's a pleasure to help them. I know most of the volunteers, we're all Scouting veterans of some sort, but today we were helped by a lady that I don't know, and that I shall hereafter refer to as the Trihamthlete.

The Trihamthlete is a rather tall lady, maybe 5""9ish, and, whilst not yet the interstellar bodies described in this sub, she is more rotund than anyone else I know in Scouts and Guides, probably clocking in at a UK 20 or a US 24. I would guess her weight to be in the upper 200lbs. [Basically this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-3819-body-shape.htm?StartAt=9#.Uf6-NtKTj44) She didn't smell, she seemed clean, none of the usual HP shit, just a larger middle-aged lady. 

When we arrived on site, I was leaning out of the car window, throwing up, due to bevvies last night, my travel sickness and the awful driving of my mate. When the Trihamthlete saw this, she tutted, rolled her eyes, gathered up all of her shit and waddled towards our bag section. Fair enough, you can disapprove of the hungover teenage girl, whatever. The Trihamthlete goes on to set up her camping chair in the middle of the bag section; she should not need a chair for the day, she'll have to be jumping about for a little bit before she would get a chance to use said chair and she's IN THE WAY. One of the Men In Charge (MICs) tell her this, and then FatLogic^^TM begins. ""I have a bad back, and bad knees, I can't be standing for too long, I need my chair here! I'm a volunteer, I don't HAVE to be here!"" There's a 14 year old helping who's less of a child than this woman. 

We work things out, leave her in her chair, from which she half-heartedly helps one or two athletes. we're each given a group of numbers; I hand out 100-300, and surprise, surprise, Trihamthlete is supposed to do 300-400. I ended up doing 100-400, after half an hour of irate athletes. Too late to moan about her, better just getting on with it. 

At one point, hotmanwitha300number rides up, I snag his bag from next to Trihamthelete's foot, and stand there as he digs through the bag,  before a look of confusion crosses his face. 

""What's up, man?"" I ask

""Nothing, just thought I had some jelly beans in here too; guess I'm so tired I've forgotten what I've eaten!"" 

We laugh it off, and I give him an [energy bar](http://mytidewatermoms.com/files/tpubs/CLIF_BAR_CCPC-BC-CMC_3_bar_fan.JPG) instead, and he peddles off. 

I turn to put his bag back, they do laps so we'll see him again before the end of the day, and notice an empty packet of Jelly beans in the cup holder of Trihamthlete's chair. 

""Erm, Triham,"" I query, not really believing what I'm seeing, ""Did you take those jelly beans out of an athlete's bag?""

""^teehee Well, he had so much food, and he's so thin, he won't need it, so I thought I could use it to pick my energy up so I don't pass out from all the work we've been doing"" 

I'm normally not the type to speak like this but I can't abide shit done to innocent people. 

""Triham, that's both disgusting and bullshit and we both know it. That man is halfway through a FULL triathlon, he's going to burn more calories than you would if you physically set yourself on fire. With regards to the work that you've done, you've not even burnt off a tictac, let alone a bag of jelly beans. Have you taken anything else?"" 

""Just a few things, you wouldn't understand, you're skinny, it's not my fault I need to eat!"" 

""WHAT THINGS? IF YOU NEED TO EAT, TRIHAM, YOU BRING YOUR OWN FUCKING FOOD.""

""Just a few of those energy bars, and some other bits! Nothing that they'll notice! And I don't appreciate your tone of voice, remember that I am older than you.""

&gt;Each of those bars is 250 calories. When she says a few, she means 5. 1,250 calories. And they're fucking DENSE, man, one is basically a meal. 

I can't take any more, tag in a friend to cover my area and go speak to a MIC. He moves the Triham from the area with food in, to the water station, where there is nothing calorific enough for her to steal. 

I pass the rest of the day angry but in peace."	t5_2vzax	True

**A disclaimer. This FPS is very much so NSFL, even more so than “The Hamspanic Part 1: Kitty”...however, if you stick with it you will learn the potentially life saving importance of a good diet containing lots of fiber. **

&gt;Be me. 
&gt;Winding down to the last hour of my 7PM-7AM night shift. The incoming day shift nurses are scattered around the nurses station getting report from the night shift. Several physicians are doing rounds with their staff. The ICU is bustling with activity.

&gt;The air begins to thicken like a strawberry milkshake. The ground shakes just once due to some unknown event. The hair on the back of everyone’s neck begins to stand up. Sounds begin to dull to a quiet roar. A muffled shout is heard in the distance.

&gt;Suddenly, without warning the emergency lights start flashing, the sirens begin to wail, and we hear “Code Blue! Intermediate Care Unit Room #___” being screamed through the PA. 

A code blue means that a patient is in the process of dying/entered cardiac arrest/ has become unresponsive/little or no vital signs/etc... 
It’s not good. One for the patient, and two because that means we will probably be getting them sent down to us. 
The Intermediate Care Unit was right next door to us and was for patients that are too sick for the Floor, but not quite sick enough for the ICU.

&gt;The doors burst open and in wheels the instrument of my jimmies demise...Ham Fountain!

&gt;Ham Fountain was ginormous. 
500+ lbs of fermenting bulbous ham being wheeled in on a bariatric bed (the biggest possible hospital beds) that barely fit through the hallways. 

&gt;Being right at shift change and in the middle of physician rounds we had a veritable dream team of health professionals right there. There was literally no better time for something to have gone wrong.

We’re all going to make it!

&gt;I start getting the patient transferred over into the system and relay barked orders from 8 different physicians to the other hospital departments. In a feat of cooperation and teamwork like I have never seen Ham Fountain is revived. Everyone is working like a well oiled machine! 

Then, HF’s nurse from the IMCU begins giving report.

&gt;Ham Fountain was admitted to the IMCU with Diverticulitis. Now...not all people who have diverticulitis have crappy diets or are obese...but a lot of people who have crappy diets and are obese have diverticulitis. See what I did there?


**TL:DR If you don't eat enough fiber in your diet to keep things moving through your intestines on a daily basis...hard substances like nuts or seeds that don't fully digest will sit in your gut and slowly rub a sore (diverticuli) into the wall of the intestine which can get infected (diverticulitis) [which can burst and then you die from internal bleeding](http://i.imgur.com/1rE6pQG.gif).**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis

**Which is exactly what happened next!!!** 

There...I saved you from having to read the sordid details. So if you have no jimmies left to spare today, please for the love of god close this fps and go stare at some kittens, fly a kite, or simply do anything, **ANYTHING** other than read what I am about to describe next.**

.


*Every sentence and picture from here out should be considered NSFL and probably NSFW.*

**You have been warned!!!**


&gt;Ham Fountain’s diverticulitis...was from decades of shitty eating and neglect. 
He had just had his 40th birthday colonoscopy, and the GI lab found his intestines riddled with diverticula and a few really bad diverticulitis on the verge of bursting and lots of impacted fossilized shit. The doctor was freaked out and ordered immediate surgery. Instead of a drastic colon resection, the surgery he went in for was to essentially put a rubber band around the infected pouch.and seal it off from the intestines so that he wouldn’t damage it.

&gt;Then he had to follow a strict diet for the rest of his life and take extra care for his digestive health. 

Being an FPS do you guys think [he followed it?](http://i.imgur.com/ctgRlSS.gif)

&gt;Immediately after his surgery he ordered a massive haul of fast food to be sent to the room instead of eating his prescribed liquid diet. No one knew how he got it in there or who even brought it to him. Buckets of chicken and bags of burgers. He ate all of it as quickly as he could so the nurse couldn’t see it and hid the garbage behind a room chair (they found it later). This being a fresh surgery to his colon he started having severe abdominal pressure and pain. Instead of calling the nurse (like a 5 year old afraid of getting in trouble) he gets up to try to use the bathroom. The amount of straining he had to do in order to push that massive boulder of greasy protein fast food shit past the narrowed section of colon caused the band to burst and his colon to rupture and then he started to bleed internally.

From my understanding, when you have a lower GI bleed in your intestines you don’t really feel it happening. The blood in rest of your body starts draining into about 20-30 ft of your intestines and eventually you pass out from the low blood pressure 
because all of your blood is backing up from your ass to your stomach.

&gt;When the nurse came in to do a vital signs check, he was passed out on the floor with a cheeseburger in hand with no pulse. 

&gt;She screamed down the hallway for help and slammed the Code Blue button on the wall....

My fellow curvy Redditors have demanded part 2, and I’m so happy to oblige. I can’t believe that my post actually got read and commented on! For those of you who haven’t seen part 1, link is above. 

To recap: A story of my 18 year old, gay but not out self and my encounter with Lardquisha, a less than 5 foot nothing 300lb nugget of luscious dark chocolate. I had just excaped a brush with Lardquisha and her moons aka smaller, beta female friends in various flavors of chocolate. The setting is a store similar to Walmart in midwest Michigan, within my first couple of weeks on the job working as a 3rd shift shelf stocker. My dear friend, T, a petite, cute 18 year old fellow shelf stocker had just been berated by Lardquisha and had gone to the back of the stockroom to contemplate her life and feel thankful for not being eaten alive. 

At this point in the story, I’m listening to Lardquisha and her moons clucking, laughing, and being ratchety as hell throughout the store at the top of their lungs. I thought Lardquisha was only in for some soda for her achey breaky, shugah-deprived thighroid since she didn’t make the “hell-ty” choice and got diet Pepsi at Taco Bell earlier in the evening. In short, Lardquisha needs sum beetus juice.

My aisle is strewn with cases of product to be put on the shelf, description at the end of part one. Needless to say these cases had anything from boxes of Kleenex to a number of glass jars of pickles/olives/peppers. They were pressed against the shelves beneath their eventual location on the shelves, leaving plenty of room to walk down the aisle. Or so I thought. 


&gt;Be me


&gt;Listening to Lardquisha and Moons meander through the store


&gt;Be trying to keep my trolley from rolling towards her gravitational pull, trying to steady my box cutter as the store is besieged by her massive footfalls and breathing that can be heard from several aisles down


&gt;Suddenly notice the footfalls seem to be increasing in intensity, the inane chatter growing closer


&gt;My adrenaline begins to spike for the second time in half an hour, “Surely this isn’t real life, surely I won’t be confronted by the beast!” thought I


&gt;I move to the opposite end of the aisle, turning in time to see the bottles of ranch dressing spinning to align with Lardquisha’s magnetic field


&gt;Time slows as Lardquisha turns the corner, I become temporarily stunned by the outrageous volume of her voice exclaiming that she’s starving and the doctor is reminding her “all da dayum time” to eat every hour


&gt;She exclaims to one of her moons, caught helplessly in orbit, that she “know good and dayum well that I cayn’t be leaving dis sto’ till I git me sum berber-cue sawce fo my chick-in.” The argument had been ongoing for some time, it became apparent, and Lardquisha was at her wit’s end


&gt;Moon complains that her knees hurt from all the walking, Lardquisha is angered and gives the moon a sharp slap in the face


&gt;I take a moment to admire Lardquisha’s alpha skillz


&gt;As Lardquisha turns the corner and faces me dead on, my adrenaline spikes, my pupils dialate


&gt;The light from the discount jewelry case and the florescent lighting is amplified, Lardquisha lookin’ like an ashy solar eclipse


&gt;Until this point I had never heard the term “ashy,” I can but recognize her ashy wonder in retrospect


&gt;My naïve mind assumes there was a bonfire, and Lardquisha and the moons took off their shoes and had a pow wow in the remains of their fire


&gt; For the first time I get a full on view of Lardquisha, a number of massive Cadbury eggs melted together and then wrapped poorly with a meager amount of light pink tinfoil


&gt;My initial observations turn to her utter lack of calf muscles, ending in ankles smaller around than my wrists


&gt;Like an upside-down pear, balancing on a pair of toothpicks


&gt;A massive pot belly, and a pair of GGG knockers are next in line, making a shelf perfectly horizontal to the floor


&gt;My height advantage allowed me to see the 2 feet of wobbly cleavage, flattened between two equally opposing forces of nature, gravity and Lardquisha’s gut and post-gut fat folds


&gt;Behold! The bejeweled cell phone sinking ever lower into the crevasse


&gt;Each step brought majestic jiggle’s to the layers of lard filled curves


&gt;Her arms swinging horizontally above her sidefolds, which rested on industrial sized love handles each the size of a small child


&gt;The aforementioned stretch marks making an appearance at the bottom of the gut with each step, her tinfoil jumpsuit screaming for mercy


&gt;I note in amazement that some designer had made a new color specifically for this jumpsuit, likely entitled “Dusty Rose in the Ghetto”


&gt;Lardquisha is dripping, though whether it’s grease or sweat I can neither tell by sight nor smell, the latter being so overpowering I am nearly brought to one knee


&gt;Lardquisha advances, gods no! The berber-que sauce is directly to my left!


&gt;Lardquisha becomes enraged with the fact that she has to walk another thirty feet to the other end of the aisle, and in a moment of extreme ratchety-assedness and with a roar of frustration, begins kicking cases of Kleenex and Ziploc bags as she walks, each weighing no more than a couple of pounds, out of her way


&gt;Wait, no, they aren’t in her way they’re off to the side


&gt;unbemuthafuckinleivable.jpg


&gt;”Sumbitch,” exclaims I under my breath, the first froth of rage beginning to bubble in my brain


&gt;I note a moon pushing Lardquisha’s cart, stacked with upward of twenty boxes of frozen, off-brand breaded chicken breasts, at least 10 full 2-liters of off-brand grape and red pop/drank each and 2 empties (already sacrificed to Lardquisha’s thighroid), and a mound of jumbo marshmallows. Oh and BBQ chips, 10-15 family bags, store brand


&gt;reinforcingracialstereotypes.ftw


&gt;Lardquisha homes in on my terrified, cracka’ face as she advances, going out of her way to kick as she goes


&gt;But sweet justice is around the corner, Lardquisha veers right toward the berber-cue side, homing in on the next box upon which to dole out her toothpick justice


&gt;Meanwhile, she exclaims to one of her moons: “Moontifaquanda, look at all dees boxes all up on dis dayum flo’ dees lazy white people be duurrrty dey need to pick up they dayum sheeyit so I don’t gotta be clearin’ a path all hurtin mah bad knee.”


&gt;ihaveahunchshemeanttobeoverheard.avi


&gt;[MFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsyw15zXoN1qbq017o1_500.gif) there was a perfectly clear path down the center of the aisle for her to walk on


&gt;Some god was watching out for ConfectionAffection that day, though


&gt;As Lardquisha pulled back her right toothpick to kick the next case in line, I saw a flash of what was about to happen next and I cracked a manic smile


&gt;The kick landed, directly onto a case containing a number of half gallon jars full of dill pickles and liquid defiance


&gt;The case remained stable, Lardquisha’s foot was unable to go forward as her center of mass was carried forward by tremendous momentum, unable to be described nor calculated by all of modern Newtonian physics


&gt;Forward was the direction in which Lardquisha toppled, one stick arm catching the shelf to her right, clumsily knocking down several bottles of berber-cue sauce, the industrial shelving letting out a blood-curdling screech but holding by another act of some god


&gt;Lardquisha’s impact shook the store, nay, the continent


&gt;I began a maniacal laugh, thanking whosoever had meted out such sweet justice


&gt;The San Andreas fault shifted at that moment, earthquakes simultaneously began all over the continental US


&gt;Bottles of berber-cue fell into her weave from the shelf above, never to be seen again


&gt;”Oh sheeeeeeyit!” exclaimed the moons, helping the winded and stunned beast to her feet


&gt;Lardquisha began to inhale, shaking off the moons and advancing on me, whereupon reaching my teary-eyed self, began a tirade the likes of which I had never heard before


&gt;”YOU WANNA GO, BIYATCH?! MAH DADDYS A LOYER AND HELL SUE YO ASS YOUPUTTIN THESE MUFUCKIN BOXES IN MY WAY TRIPPIN ME ON PORPOISE JUST CUZ IM A CURVY GURL! YOU WANNA LAUGH AT ME?

&gt;And so on

&gt;&gt; have a new fatty, hypochondriac. Will call her The Hamocolypse. 5'3, 375.

&gt;&gt; ALWAYS complaining about shit, wants antibiotics for every nick and cut, scrubs her eyes with tissues until they are red, and then screams for antibiotic eye drops,

&gt;&gt; spends her days flirting with elderly gentleman of various stages of dementia and sending them to the snack machines

&gt;&gt; more than little old man eats shit trying to carry honey buns back to the beached land whale

Hamocolypse is a... Unique fatty. She carries a fuckton of her weight in her abdomen. Rather than the usual beer belly, this land yacht has a swollen, pendulous flapjack of flesh that droops to her ankles when sitting. The texture is like a crater filled catchers mitt, and the whole thing looks like Grimace is hanging his ass out of her muumuu. 

I know what's happened here. Yeast, the bane of sexy curves everywhere, has taken hold deep within that monstrosity, and I've got to go fix it.

&gt;&gt; lots of help.

&gt;&gt; summon three aides, instruct them to heave the meaty flapjack up

&gt;&gt; ""**DON'T YOU FLIP THAT OVA MAH HEAD, BITCH I'LL SUFFOCATE!!!**""

&gt;&gt; Take quick break for lols

&gt;&gt; Five minutes later, the aides heave the woman's belly ([Panniculus](http://imgur.com/6Df0cwU), now you've learned something) back, and the stench of 1000 lost honey buns washes over the room, forcing two aides to retch audibly

1373081791.0	1hqbvm	The day I lost my appetite for Subway forever	HeroOfLime	389	78	81	"I've been reading up on these stories for a while now and I absolutely love them, so I decided to share one of my own from a few years ago. I thought I had shared this story somewhere in the past but it must have been on another account since I couldn't find it in my history. 
Also this is my first time doing greentext so fingers crossed! 

&gt; Be me, about 16 or so, 140 pounds, 5'8. Standard looking white kid.  

&gt; Don't be cool-ass night shift leader who I'll call Sam  

&gt; Work at a certain chain restaraunt  

&gt; Said restaraunt serves sandwiches  

&gt; They go for about 5 dollars  

&gt; Its Subway  

&gt; 7pm or so rolls on around. Dinner shift over. Life is peace  

&gt; I am Zen  

&gt; Suddenly Yin throat punches Yang and peace is cruelly sucked away  

&gt; A NEW FOE HAS APPEARED!  

&gt; Let's just call her May. For Mayo. Which she loved.  

&gt; Approximately 5'5 and around 300 pounds of lovin, she was actually not that strange a sight in our little store.  

&gt; Sam extracts herself from the counter to ""take inventory"".  

&gt; Dammit Sam Y U DO DIS  

&gt; Put on soul-less happy face.  

&gt; ""Hi ma'am, welcome to Subway, what can I get for you?""  

&gt; ""Gimme a Buffalo Chicken foot long on Italian Herb and Cheese"" 

For those who don't know about Subway, this is one of the more unhealthy subs and breads offered. But whatevs I'm not here to judge I'm here to bring joy to the people. Also dat minimum wage.  

&gt; ""Also I want you to saturate the bread in Oil, Vinegar, and Mayo.  

&gt; lolwut  

&gt; I was holding on to the hope that she didn't actually know what saturate meant ""s-s-saturate it?""  

&gt; Apparently she assumed I was *slow* and slowly stated, ""Yeah, drown it. And no veggies, just wrap it once your done.""  

&gt; [This is about what our stare-down looked like](http://i.imgur.com/HHbfD.gif)  

&gt; I focus on that sweet sweet minimum wage and start pouring the sauces  

&gt; [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/y3B13rI.gif) she keeps telling its not enough  

&gt; ""MORE! Come on I said to drown it didn't I? Its not that hard!""  

&gt; Sandwich is oozing oil, vinegar, and mayo  

Keep in mind this shit had NO VEGGIES. The mayo was one thing but the oil and vinegar? That's usually to wet the lettuce, not soak your bread! Moving on...  

&gt; I realize the mayo bottle is nearly empty. It was mostly full a few customers ago (refilled after the dinner rush).  
 
&gt; I'm sorry ma'am, that's as much as I can give you. The sandwich won't be able to close if I put any more on. 

&gt; May ain't havin none of my thin privileged BS  

&gt; Tells me so  

&gt; ""JUST KEEP POURING, IT DON'T NEED TO CLOSE""  

&gt; [MRW](http://i.imgur.com/gnQdpHG.gif)  

&gt; O lawd please make it stop  

&gt; I look at the sandwich  

&gt; WHAT HAVE I DONE!?  

&gt; She gives an exasperated sigh and says ""You're crazy if you think that's enough! You're supposed to make the sandwich the way I want, and I want MORE MAYO. GIVE ME WHAT I ASKED FOR OR I WILL LEAVE A COMPLAINT!""  

&gt; Dis bitch be yellin, luckily the place was empty apart from her  

&gt; ""GIVE ME MORE MAYO DAMMIT!""  

&gt; oshitudonediditnow  

&gt; [Sam's reaction to the swearing](http://i.imgur.com/QrHApQu.gif)  

&gt; Sam tells the woman she can't have any more and to pay for her sandwich and leave, and if she continues to yell or swear she will call the police  

&gt; May turns read in the face  

&gt; Good lord she's gonna blow!  

&gt; DUCK FOR COVER  

&gt; SAM GET DOWN!  

&gt; Sam gives no shits  

&gt; Ohshitdatglare  

&gt; May said she wouldn't pay for the sandwich since it wasn't what she wanted  

&gt; Started to storm out  

&gt; [ORW](http://i.imgur.com/kzXvt.gif) she decided to knock a bunch of our chips of their shelves, take some, and stomp on others when leaving  

&gt; She escaped  

&gt; Throw monstrosity of sub into trash  

&gt; [mfw](http://i.imgur.com/s77Ye.gif?1) I realized I was making 7.25 for this

**tl;dr** Large woman demands all the mayo we had, couldn't handle her request. She causes a fuss, doesn't pay for the sandwich, and wrecks our chips.

1371583874.0	1glriv	The Twenty-Two Towering Tenets of Fatlogic	Queefing_Peanuts	368	56	46	"After reading this sub for many moons and hearing firsthand accounts of said moons, I have decided to compile a three-part, jimmy-rustling compendium of sweetened, condensed fatlogic. Every artery-clogging principle of fatlogic I've observed has been added to this list.

If anybody can think of other examples that are not related to the ones written below, make a good case for it and I will add them to an updated list. It goes without saying that this list will need to be revised regularly. Given enough time, the entitled will always find new ways to justify their stupidity.

**The Physiology**

1\. ""I am unhealthy, but nobody can tell me that I'm unhealthy.""

&gt;My body is perfectly fine. You can't say anything to me because you're not a doctor. If you are a doctor, you're still wrong. You may have gone through a decade of schooling but that doesn't mean anything because my condition is not due to my weight. You're only refusing to give me the pain meds/CATscan/lapband surgery because you're trying to fat-shame me.

2\. Having a medical ""condition"" is a blank check to do nothing and eat as much as you want. It requires neither a formal diagnosis nor a measured treatment plan. Serious conditions, like type 2 diabetes, require no lifestyle changes at all, just medication. Having a condition makes even mild hunger a life or death situation. Having a condition will always trump the laws of thermodynamics, so weight loss is impossible even under the most strict diet. Two opposing conditions can't cancel each other out. They can only magnify the hunger.

&gt;Muh blood sugah was low, so I had to eat the whole cake. Then muh blood sugah spiked, so I had to take more insulin. The insulin made my blood sugah too low so I had to eat the pizza and all of the potato salad too. I don't care if it was for your nephew's birthday party! He took too long unwrapping his presents and I was going to pass out and die! It's all his fault. I have a condition.

&gt;My body requires more calories than other people because it is so big. I'm fat because my metabolism is too slow. I have a condition. Pass the syrup.

3\. Being fat is a more important disability than all other disabilities.

&gt;You're a paraplegic? Walk it off, this is my parking spot. I need to be at the front of the line for everything. My disability is an inconvenience that covers all aspects of life and I deserve to be compensated for it... by everything and everyone.

4\. The morbidly obese are not bigger than normal people because they are fat. That's a lie perpetuated by the BMI. They just have big skeletal frames and weigh more than normal people because muscle weighs more than fat.

&gt;This is not fat. This is muscle. I'm big-boned and I have too many muscles, which is why I have a hard time standing or walking... or doing anything, really.

5\. Exercise is dangerous to your health. Exercise makes your heart work too hard and lifting weights tears your muscle fibers. Apparently this damage is irreparable.

&gt;Sorry, I'm too health-conscious to come to the gym with you today. Exercise will ruin your health, you know. It'll give you heart attacks! It's true because I read about it in some ten-year-old science article that I barely understood.

6\. If bathing and wiping becomes physically challenging, standards of hygiene no longer apply. Concessions need not be made to ensure proper cleaning.

&gt;Yay! I found the box of milk duds I lost two months ago! It was hiding in one of my folds!

**The Feels**

7\. Fatties hate to fat alone.

&gt;I need people to be fat with me because it is the only outlet I have for being social. Eating is the only activity I know and love. You better not try to lose weight or you're gonna make me look bad. Turning down an offer of food is a treasonous act of war and I am General Fatton.

8\. A fatty is never too big. Everything else is too small. Holding a fat person accountable for the damages and inconveniences caused directly by their body's immense size is fat discrimination. Everyone should have pre-emptively built/moved/reinforced everything to accommodate for their size, safety regulations and laws of physics be damned.

&gt;It's not my fault that I don't know the dimensions of my body. Plane seats are getting smaller. My clothes are shrinking. This chair must've been made out of toothpicks. I'm a healthy person in a world built for anorexics.

9\. Big is more ""beautiful"" than beautiful. A skinny person should never turn down a fat person's romantic advances. Conversely, a fat person should never be expected to settle for another fat person. Big is beautiful and deserves to be rewarded with sexytimes from somebody thin, fit and muscular.

&gt;Men like meat. Dogs like bones. I like cake and men with chiseled abs. Teehee.

10\. Anger towards the obese is *always* rooted in jealousy or envy.

&gt;Don't be mad just 'cause I broke yo chair. Y'all just hatin' 'cause you wish you could have these currrrves.

11\. Size discrimination is a one-way road.

&gt;Nobody wants to work with skinny bitches. You're just a skinny bitch who hates me because I'm a ""real"" woman. What? You can't report me to HR for making fun of your weight!  I'm going to report you first, you little twig! You're the oppressor! You walk around this office like you own the place, flaunting your boney self by not eating any of the donuts in the break room. You're just trying to insult my weight by being anorexic and skinny.

12\. Only fat people can be beautiful on the inside. Thin people never have to work for anything or develop their personalities, so they're automatically dumber than fat people and less charming.

&gt;Skinny people can never understand me because they're not fat. They're too busy starving themselves and being worthless assholes with nothing to contribute to society. I hate skinny people and I wish all of them would shut up and die. *Sigh.* If only they weren't so stupid and put off by my weight, they would be able to see that I have a wonderful, caring personality.

**The Food**

13\. Being fat makes you an authority on everyone else's health and nutritional needs.

&gt;""You should let me have that slice of cake because it'll just make you fat if you eat it. I'm looking out for you. Also, you should've eaten more for dinner because you look way too skinny. And your kids are too skinny. You better not stop me from feeding them this entire tub of battered lard or I'll call CPS on you for starving your children.""

14\. Vegetables are ""rabbit food"" and eating them for even a single meal will send you down the path towards becoming dangerously anorexic, even if said vegetables are swimming in a gallon of ranch.

&gt;What is this? Spinach? There better be a baconator hiding at the bottom of this. How am I supposed to get full off of this stuff?

15\. Everything a parent knows about nutrition is always the correct interpretation. They grew up at a time when everyone was skinnier, so they know better than you or any doctor. A growing child needs all the calories it can get. There is no such thing as childhood ""obesity."" They just haven't had their growth-spurt yet.

&gt;When I was a kid we used to eat all kinds of candy and junk food and run all over the neighborhood getting into all kinds of trouble... what's that, son? You're tired of playing Skyrim for the past 10 hours and you want the latest copy of BattleArmy 4? Alright then, hop in the van. Let's go to Gameshop. Yes, of course we're stopping for McDonalds on the way. Ask your baby sister how many orders of nuggets she wants. Make sure you roll her over before we leave so she doesn't get any bedsores this time.

16\. A healthy diet is whatever you feel like eating, whenever you feel like eating, as long as it is accompanied by a diet coke or similarly low-calorie option. Because you're trying to watch what you eat.

&gt;Gimme two orders of double-fried pork rings and an order of bacon-battered butter bombs - with the russian style dressing - and a triple-quarter-pounder patty-melt with the french fries, fried chicken, fried mozzarella sticks, battered jalapeno poppers and deep-fried sweet potato tots stuffed in a footlong loaf of garlic bread and make sure it's got extra EXTRA mayo on it this time. Oh, and gimme a diet coke.

17\. Crash diets are bad. Therefore, all diets are bad.

&gt;Counting calories is something only anorexics do. Are you anorexic? Denying yourself calories will only make following your diet harder and you'll end up cheating on it even more. That's why 95% of all diets fail. You're just going to gain it all back. Just give up already.

18\. The calories don't count if you don't write them down in your food diary and nobody sees you eat them.

&gt;""Weight Watchers says that coffee has no calories! That means if I blend a brownie into it and fill it with heavy whipping cream, I just mark it zero in my diary! Dieting is so easy.""

19\. Promising to start your diet tomorrow means you can eat whatever you want today.

&gt;I swear, I'm really gonna do it this time. Tomorrow I'm gonna go on that diet. I'm so excited! I'm going to start today by eating all the foods I'm going to miss the most. Just like yesterday.

20\. If a diet makes you lose weight, then combining as many diets as possible will make you lose *even more* weight.

&gt;""I'm doing the ketogenic, vegetarian, raw, liquid, pH, Atkins, cookie diet. I mixed them all together into one. I'll just follow a different one every day so I don't get bored and I'll be losing weight in no time!""

21\. Any form of exercise deserves an immediate reward containing at least as many calories as you burned, if not more.

&gt;It's ok if I have this pint of Ben n Jerry's, because I walked five blocks to the corner store to get it, instead of just driving there like I usually do.

22\. There's an anti-consumerist food conspiracy out there keeping us fat. All food is unhealthy because companies want you to be fat. There's fat-making particles in all food. Even our air is making us fat! There are no healthy options, so it's pointless to diet.

&gt;Tinfoil for my head? No, I was going to use it to wrap the leftovers. LOL, just kidding! There are no leftovers!"	t5_2vzax	True

1368912002.0	1elhbr	Waddle goes to Baltimore	CitizenTed	384	73	58	"My friend and ex-coworker recently wrote a story about Waddle crapping his pants on a business trip. It's time for me to write about my first (and last) business trip with Waddle. 

Some Waddle background: he's fat, loud, obnoxious, dumb and irritating. He works in sales but has a nasty habit of boring everyone to death. He never shuts up and because his life is straight-laced and uneventful, his anecdotes are all mind-numbingly boring despite the fact that he punctuates them with guffaws of excitement. 

So anyway, the Big Boss decided that I, the Tech Guy, should get more sales experience at trade shows. I was to travel with Waddle to Baltimore for a two-day trade show. I was booking airfare when Waddle burst in and insisted that he take care of all the details. 

He ends up booking us a 5:00am flight even though there was a 9:00am flight that would have left us plenty of time. He then books our hotel room. Not rooms, room. He booked a 1bd suite in a hotel downtown. I asked for separate rooms, but he responded that such an extravagance was a waste of company money. I did the research myself. By sharing a suite, we were saving $27 a night. I told him I'd gladly pay the $27 out of my own pocket if it meant I had a modicum of privacy. Waddle then flips out and goes crying the ops manager, who grudgingly admits it ""saves money"". We'd be sharing a room. 

Why this was so important to him, I have no idea. Why we needed a 5:00am flight, I have no idea. I can only assume he likes to be irritating and contrary. 

So I get up at 3:00am to make the fucking flight. Arriving at the airport, I'm barely awake. Not Waddle. He's all excited and wide-eyed and won't shut up. Suddenly I panicked. What seats do we have? ""We're seated together, dude!"" he says. My heart dropped. 

Once we get on the plane, I was immensely relieved to discover we were in the same row, but not in adjacent seats. He was across the aisle from me. I would not have to sit up against Waddle's pork for six hours. Yay! 

The whole flight he kept interrupting me with stupid shit, talking loud and being obnoxious. I just wanted to read. 

When we get to the hotel, I find the suite is just that: a 1bd suite with a couch in the main room. Waddle immediately unloads all his stuff in the bedroom. I'd be stuck on the couch roll-away. Whatever. 

All settled in, it was time to eat dinner. Across from the hotel was a classic Baltimore crab shack with some elderly black dude sitting out front, greeting people. I told Waddle this would be perfect: a chance to eat regional food in a small independent restaurant. Waddle took one look at the ""sketchy"" place with the negro in front and flipped out. ""No way! That place looks sketchy!""

It's a crab shack. We're in Baltimore. World-famous crab cakes. But no. It was too ""negro"" for pasty white suburban Waddle to handle. And he has the company card, so he gets to call the shots. We walk around near the waterfront and he finds the perfect choice: ESPN Zone. 

I asked him if he was really going to eat at some idiotic chain joint when we were in the epicenter of America's finest seafood joints. Yes. It was ESPN Zone or I pay myself and explain to the boss why I needed reimbursement from an expense report when Waddle was being all reasonable with the company card. To ESPN Zone we went. 

I hated it. I hate sports. I hate chain restaurants. I hate drunk idiots hooting at the TV set. The food was greasy, gloppy garbage. *sigh*. 

The trade show was a bust. Our sad pipe-and-drape display wasn't catching any interest, but Waddle was sure to talk and talk and talk to me and to any poor soul who foolishly paused within 20 feet of the booth. Being the tech guy, I know what our stuff can and cannot do, and the specs of everything we make. Waddle was spewing ridiculous bullshit to everyone. He had no clue. He honestly believed that his ""positive sales aspect"" was carrying the day and impressing everyone. People streamed away from our booth like it emitted chlorine gas. 

Another evening, another dinner. I insisted we eat at an independent, non-chain restaurant. Waddle agreed, but only tentatively. It had to pass his smell test. We walked up and down the streets. We inpected the menus at all sorts of interesting-looking places. None met his needs. After 90 minutes of this stalemate, Waddle steers us back toward the waterfront where he spies a Cheescake Factory. 

Because I had ""failed"" to find a worthwhile place, we now had to eat at his Favorite Restaurant in the Whole World. After 12 hours of work, the enormous wait, the awful atmosphere and the terrible food at Cheesecake Factory really pissed me off. I refused to speak to Waddle as he reeled off stupid anecdote after stupid anecdote. 

Back at the hotel, I told Waddle I had to make some calls. Instead, I escaped and found a watering hole a few blocks away. Had some beers and some refreshingly intelligent conversation with the locals. Got back late and crawled into my couch bed. 

Next day, I had given up. I let Waddle bloviate all day. I let Waddle choose the restaurant. I let Waddle waddle all over the place. I glanced constantly at my watch, counting the hours till I would be away from this asshole. And I said nothing. All day, all night. Eventually I shut Waddle down. The stream of bullshit stopped. 

Next morning we flew home in silence. I went home and enjoyed blessed solitude. 

Next day at work, I had a quiet chat with the manager. Under no circumstances would I ever travel with Waddle again. Not locally, not regionally, not nationally. This gave him so pause, so I stepped up. These were conditions of my continued employment. NEVER. AGAIN. PERIOD. 

Though I went on many company-wide business strips, I was never paired solo with Waddle again. I was now pegged as ""anti-social"" and a sharp line was drawn between me and Waddle. From then on, he looked upon me as a bad person who spurned his kindness. Whatever. 

Fuck that guy.

&gt;Not even funny anymore, [I tried finding a picture that could do her justice](http://imgur.com/Soqhrj3), but this was the only thing that came close

&gt;Thin, greasy hair, beady eyes, huge glasses with lenses that could see the fat pouring from her self-lubricating skin

&gt;One of those people that wakes up, trips into the curtains and goes: ""Welp, I'm dressed!""

&gt;8 AM, bus was pretty damn full with students/forensics, so even Blubberbutt had to stand

&gt;Smack dab in the middle of the aisle

&gt;Being the beta that I am, I don't ask to pass

&gt;More people join bus, so Blubberbutt has to walk further in bus eventually

&gt;See side of butt/thigh/thutt(?) of Blubberbutt stroke the cheek of an unsuspecting student seated in his comfy chair while she walks further into the bus

&gt;I saw the face of true disgust and it was on the head of this guy

&gt;Alas, I left my bleach in my other backpack. You'll have to live with this disgrace, my friend

Now before we continue, you need to know something about the bus. Dutch busses usually have 2 rows of seats on each side which are 'shielded' front and back by the other seats, so you can only get in from the side. [However, in the middle is a big open space for people to stand or for bikes/dogs/whatever baggage you have.](http://imgur.com/Ou25hvM) Located in that area are little chairs attached to the side which you can fold open. Not the comfiest, but hey, free chair.

&gt;Arrive at next stop, people leave, seats are taken, seats are left

&gt;Wallchair remains empty. If it had feelings, it would probably be bracing for impact

&gt;Blubberbutt decides not to take place on said chair, probably knows it couldn't support her anyway

&gt;Happily take place, put earbuds in, blissfully ignorant of the upcoming danger

&gt;Nothing happens for the next 15 mins

&gt;Music has lifted me into extasy, could sit here forever

&gt;Suddenly, busdriver remembers who he was in a previous life: a rally driver.

&gt;Brakes and takes a sharp turn, taking all its passengers with him

&gt;ALL of them

&gt;Blubberbutt loses grip of her pole, gravity shall take yet another victim and it's name is Kimster4Life

&gt;A shadow looms over me

&gt;Force of a thousand burgers lands on top of me

&gt;Let out the biggest yelp I've ever yelped

I have three bigger brothers. I've wrestled with them. I've had the weight of three 20-year olds on top of me. But nothing can compare to the brute force of what was just lying on top of me.

&gt;Gasp for air

&gt;Chest can't expand, oxygen supply is dwindling, you must construct additional lungs

&gt;People rush to help get Blubberbutt off me, busdriver stops ASAP

&gt;They get her up

&gt;I inhale deeply ""OW FUCK, THAT HURTS""

&gt;Ribs hurt so much, it's unreal

&gt;First thing Blubberbutt says: ""Geez, didn't go well""

&gt;Didn't take any damage, her +3754 Shield of Fatty McFatFat protects her from any and all harm

&gt;[MFW](http://imgur.com/UYNKyxf) she didn't even apologize

&gt;Proceed to school, every breath hurts

&gt;[Can't deal with the pain](http://imgur.com/iS1RujU), get checked up

Turns out she bruised at least 6 ribs.

It still hurts when I push on them.

*It still fucking hurts.*

1367935518.0	1dv151	Hamplanet can't get enough of the salt	shadowguise	391	79	63	"This will be my first time sharing a FPS, I do have a few to share.

While I was a teenager, my family ended up befriending a couple that moved into our city that they had been acquainted with before. They are a somewhat older couple, at the time probably in their late 40's/early 50's. The man was a pretty awesome guy, in shape, goes for a walk every morning, generally walks everywhere, loves to be on his feet, etc. I'll call him Walker

The woman, however, was a hamplanet of the highest order. 5'3"", well over 400 pounds, [close to this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-2496-body-shape.htm#img) but shorter and with lots more sag due to age. She did nothing but eat, and eat terribly, never liked to walk anywhere or even stand for any extended period of time. She had high blood pressure but did nothing about her weight to help it. I'll refer to her as Saturn since apparently Walker liked it enough to put a ring on it.

We hung out with them on occasion for a while. Here's one of those times.

&gt;be me, around 12 years old at the time

&gt;be rather fat, over 200 pounds

&gt;my parents are also hammy, don't eat healthy, don't exercise, end up having weight problems throughout childhood

&gt;feelsbadman.jpg

&gt;Walker and Saturn invite us over to dinner one day, parents accept

&gt;at their house, just hanging out and shooting the shit with Walker

&gt;Walker tells some great jokes, all is well

&gt;suddenly a rumble can be heard from the kitchen

&gt;the earth shakes as the sky darkens

&gt;somewhere, villagers are rounding up virgins for a sacrifice to the volcano gods

&gt;wait, no, it's just Saturn bringing out dinner

&gt;virgins are safe for another day

&gt;we all go to the table and get ready to eat

&gt;meat (can't remember what kind), potato salad, baked mac-n-cheese

&gt;the mac-n-cheese is extremely cheesy, sitting in lots of grease, but as a hammy teenager I wasn't complaining about that

&gt;get lots of mac-n-cheese

&gt;parents still talking to Walker and Saturn between bites of food

&gt;I try the mac-n-cheese

&gt;suddenly feel like I'm drowning in the Atlantic

&gt;spit out what tastes like ocean water into napkin, gasp for air

&gt;realize I'm still on land

&gt;dear god, the salt

&gt;tastes like noodles were boiled in water from the Great Salt Lake

&gt;[mfw](http://imgur.com/r0G53Nv)

&gt;start to feel dehydrated, drink half of a large glass of tea just to wash salt out of mouth

&gt;can't even take a second bite of the greasy cheesy salt noodle casserole

&gt;look at mom as she takes a bite

&gt;immediate grimacing face, followed by pained chewing and swallowing to not be rude

&gt;doesn't touch it afterwards

&gt;look at dad

&gt;dad is eating it, but very slowly and taking a drink every 1-2 bites

&gt;Walker is eating it like nothing is wrong, must have adapted to consuming saltwater

&gt;Saturn has plate piled high with everything, including Great Salt Lake Cheesy Noodle Casserole

&gt;Saturn takes a bite, reaches for something

&gt;Saturn grabs the salt

&gt;oh god no

&gt;puts several more dashes of salt over everything, including cheesy salt casserole

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/YRDDs28.gif) Saturn turns the Great Salt Lake Cheesy Noodle Casserole into the Dead Sea Cheesy Noodle Casserole

&gt;eats everything on the plate, even gets seconds

&gt;drinks tons of coke during meal

This is just a sample of the kind of crap she would shove down her throat at alarming speeds. No wonder her blood pressure was always sky high. I'll share more stories later on."	t5_2vzax	True
1367850247.0	1dskc8	Fat favors	avalisk	367	55	23	"So a while ago I worked retail, and one of my coworkers was a good friend of mine, but also a pathological liar.   His girlfriend was dying of brain cancer, his sister was dying of brain cancer, wait, did he say sister?  He meant girlfriend, only its a cyst this time, super tragic, you get the picture.   

Anyways he mentioned his uncle in a few of his stories which I didn't take seriously.  His uncle is 300 lb of man muscle, been on disability pay for 15 years for his bad back, coworker brags that its $600 a week.  Back then I was a kid, thinking, damn, I want to hurt my back.  

So one day, I get a text from my buddy.  ""Come over and give me a hand with something LOL""  he has helped me with my car breakdowns and stuff, so I don't question anything, I just head over.   I get to his house, and ring the bell, nobody answers.   I call him.   ""Oh I'm in the trailer behind the house, come over.""

Nothing prepared me for this.  Evidently its his uncles trailer, which is unlocked.  I head in, and an absolute wall of weed stench hits me.   Someone has been baking in here for years, and has not vacuumed once.   I yell for my buddy and he responds from down the trailer hall.  I shuffle through the beer cans to the bathroom, where fatilus has had an accident.  

evidently he was attempting to take a shower, and got steamed up and light headed, and had fallen through the wall into the ajacent bedroom where he was unable to get up.   He wasn't 300 lb of muscle, he was 400 lb of blob.   There is water everywhere from the shower being left on for god knows how long.   Its soaked the carpet into a marsh stew of steam, and weed smell.   This was the Vietnam jungle.

We spent the next 10 minutes struggling in swamp carpet, rolling a greasy, naked orb of swearing fat over onto his stomach and knees so he could help us get him up.  we got him up, sitting on his bed, and I left straight away.  

I dont think I'll ever forget plunging my hands into the backroll of a wet, hairy naked man, but if someone knows some MIB nebulizer tricks or meditation fantasy zone thing, clue me in.  

What rustles me the most is knowing that his weed smoking beer drinking 15 year long pizza binge is funded by people paying taxes for disability, rationalizing to themselves that is necessary to help those who are hurt.  Me and my buddy are still friends, and everything works great, as long as you don't believe a word he says.

I thought they were all just exaggerated for lulz, but unfortunately... I was wrong... 


Here is mine. Not that funny, but I was horrified. 


TL;DR: Work with hamplanet at music library. Fatlogic. She judges me for being too thin. 


&gt;&gt; Be me, tiny Asian girl. 

&gt;&gt; Work in music library at uni, hence title. 

&gt;&gt; Nice part-time job, usually just sit behind counter and do hw and get paid. Occasionally have to help patrons find books, CDs, etc. 

&gt;&gt; hellyeah.jpg

&gt;&gt; Worked once with LHB before and pray to never work with her again. She is hamplanet, prob 5'6"", 200 - 220 lbs, gets to work 30 minutes late, usually carrying enough food to feed small village (according to other co-workers).

&gt;&gt; McD, sodas, chips, etc. 

&gt;&gt; LHB never does any work, just listens to her music and watches videos. 

&gt;&gt; Today there is yellow tape in front of main door because facilities needs to fix the floor right outside. 

&gt;&gt; Clock in, open up by myself and sit down to do hw, wonder who is supposed to come in with me today. 

&gt;&gt; Waiting...

&gt;&gt; 30 minutes later: 

&gt;&gt; HaaaaHOOOOOHaaaaHOOOOOO

&gt;&gt; Hurricane??? Tornado???

&gt;&gt; B-but... it's sunny outside! 

&gt;&gt; Overcome with smell of sweaty pits and hair product. 

&gt;&gt; Noooo... NOT AGAIN. WHY IS THERE NO GOD. 

&gt;&gt; LHB squeezes in through side door of library, gasping for breath, holding a large white take out box and a jug of orange juice. 

&gt;&gt; ""THENERD! WHYY IS THE FRONT DOOR NOT OOOOPPPEEENN?"" 

&gt;&gt; Think: WTF. There is yellow tape everywhere and the entire floor is dug up. Duh, it's not open. 

&gt;&gt; Afraid of being eaten alive, so answer meekly, ""They're doing work on the floor outside the front door."" 

&gt;&gt; LHB gives look of death, as if it were my fault. ""OMG... WALKING TO THE SIDE DOOR IS LIKE DEEEEEAAAAATH!!!""

&gt;&gt; LHB lumbers to her station and proceeds to feast. 

&gt;&gt; Today she has from uni eatery: a helping of fries the size of her head, three chicken sandwiches, and brownies. 

&gt;&gt; Patron comes in, needs help with finding a book. 

&gt;&gt; Go downstairs with patron. Library is tiny and find book in a matter of minutes. 

&gt;&gt; Come back up to desk. 

&gt;&gt; Food is gone. Container in trash. 

&gt;&gt; O-ok... well, we open at noon, so maybe that was her lunch. She has to be full now, right? 

&gt;&gt; WRONG. 

&gt;&gt; 2 hours later, after she sits at the computer and listens to loud, ghetto music and watches youtube videos while I do all the work, she turns to me. ""Teehee... THENERD... teehee. I'm hungry. I'm going to get food. Want anything?"" 

&gt;&gt; Smell of pits, hairspray, and greasy fried foods overwhelm me. I feel nauseated and about to throw up. Quickly drink some tea to smell something else.

&gt;&gt; ""No thanks."" 

&gt;&gt; LHB USES RAGE!

&gt;&gt; ""ARE U ANOREXIC? I NEVER SEE U EAT! U NEED TO EAT SUMFIN! U ARE NOTHIN BUT SKIN AND BONES. DON'T U KNOE MEN DON'T LIKE THAT."" 

&gt;&gt; Entire library stops. Stares. 

&gt;&gt; Still afraid of being eaten alive, cowers in corner of my seat. ""I had lunch already."" 

&gt;&gt; LHB CONTINUES TO RAGE! 

&gt;&gt; ""ARE U LYING? U NEED TO EAT!"" 

&gt;&gt; Continue to decline. 

&gt;&gt; LHB huffs, sucks air through mouth a few times because out of breath from yelling, then storms out. 

&gt;&gt; Wut just happened. 


&gt;&gt; Doesn't even clock out. Comes back 1 hr later. 


&gt;&gt; She is holding another large white container from uni eatery. Inside: three large burgers dripping with mayonnaise. 

&gt;&gt; MAYONNAISE. 

&gt;&gt; ihavenoface

&gt;&gt; Starts eating behind desk while watching random movie. Patrons all avoid her because afraid of being splattered by grease and burger.

&gt;&gt; SHE GETS PAID FOR EATING. 

&gt;&gt; Am seething inside, but continue to say nothing because patrons are here. 

&gt;&gt; Phone rings. 

&gt;&gt; WTF THIS IS A LIBRARY! 

&gt;&gt; LHB pulls phone out from pocket, checks it, then answers it AT THE SERVICE DESK, talking at full volume. 

&gt;&gt; Still eating burger, food flecks flying everywhere. 

&gt;&gt; Patrons are staring. 

&gt;&gt; Instead of telling the person she's at work, she starts a full on conversation. 

&gt;&gt; MUSTNOTEXPLODEFROMANGER. 

&gt;&gt; Still many times smaller than her, still afraid of becoming next meal. Choke down rage and continue to smile at people coming into the library. 

&gt;&gt; Overhear conversation from LHB on phone. 

&gt;&gt; ""Yeah, I'm working... mmhmmm... with some anorexic chick. She's so unhealthy... She only drinks tea for like 5 hours.""

Since this seems to be happening more and more frequently, with the growing number of hamplanets in America, I'll just keep this in a series and update it as more develops! 

Now, onto the story. Please start your rustlers, and keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times. 

&gt;Be me. 17, male, 5'7"" 130lbs, skinny, but gaining muscle.

&gt;Recently won regional barista competition. 

&gt;spiritsaregood.fuckyes

&gt;Somebody is scraping their nails on the chalkboard.

&gt;Startled, glance towards board. No one there.

&gt;IsThisTheShining.aiff

&gt;Realize that the scraping is coming from the parking lot.

&gt;Panic, I know what's coming. 

At the front of the store, a man and his girlfriend walk in. The man, the antagonist in this story, seemed to be about 5'11"" and at least 350lbs. 1.8metres, 158kilos for our Metric visitors. He had the telltale waddle of a man who had long since forgotten how to use his knees. His girlfriend, on the other hand was very attractive. 5'6"", my guess is 120lbs, hardly any body fat. A solid 8/10. My guess is this visual representation of a gaseous planet used to be in quite good shape. But fat logic must have consumed him. 

&gt;The group gets to the counter, where my shift supervisor is waiting.

&gt;2 large snowdrifts, one milk chocolate, one dark chocolate. 

&gt;This is a 1300 Kcal drink. Each.

&gt;Stay calm, maybe he's buying for his lady friend.

&gt;Heh, no. I have too much faith in humanity. 

&gt;qt 3.14 looks dejected. 

&gt;She wanted a small espresso. Something to sip on.

&gt;Roll of Stones here looks at her with eyes as buttery as an aroused Paula Dean's nether regions.

&gt;He shoots back ""No! It's too expensive. Besides, think of all the calories.""

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_mj7krd58tW1r3gb3zo1_400.gif) Espresso has 1 Kcalorie per shot.

Now, for a bit of background. I adore coffee. So much so that I bought myself a La Pavoni Europiccola direct lever espresso machine. My manager is a pretty cool guy, so he lets me bring it on on occasion, during slow days and pull shots with that bad boy. They generally turn out much better than the automatic machines we're normally subjected to. And the tips! People love a guy who can work a lever. 

&gt;sensing the tension building, I step in to offer her a shot pulled from the Pavoni, on me. Not courtesy of Laribou. I'm paying for this shit. 

&gt;Fit as Fitass accepts my offer. Situation diffused. 

&gt;Or so I thought. It seems my offer of a free espresso has not gone unnoticed by Lardemort. 

While I'm making the drinks, I overhear the staples of FPS character development ""My blood sugar is low"" ""My thuhroid is acting up""

&gt;He's waiting at the serving counter with his 2 drinks in hand, madly slurping them down. 

&gt;I'm making it really clear that I'm putting a lot of effort into pulling the *perfect* shot for that poor girl. 

&gt;Hand shot up to counter, all smiles, happy that there won't be much incident. 

&gt;QT gives a weak smile and thank you. Foreshadowing what's to come. 

&gt;The motherfucking lardbag *takes the god shot from her hand and throws it away.*

Mark my words, you fat dick, if I ever see you in my store again, I will not serve you. Fuck you, fuck your attitude.

This story's context: Ursa Major/Minor and I had a falling out, I don't remember when anymore; let's say when I entered high school, due to their constant put-downs and general rudeness concerning me. I stopped talking to them, would skip out most times we went to their house, or would excuse myself if they visited my house. My mother, Ursa Major's younger sister, tried to get us to make up many times. This is the story of one of those times.

&gt;be me, 15

&gt;don't be Ursa Minor, 20

&gt;""Throwing_pies, I'm going to visit your aunt and cousin.""

&gt;that's nice mom

&gt;""You're coming!""

&gt;that's not so nice mom

&gt;""You have to make up with them sometime! At least Ursa Minor, okay? Since you two will be the only ones 
in the family alive when we die.""

&gt;I have a sister, mom. We will live long, healthy, non-obese lives together.

&gt;""Just go, throwing_pies.""

&gt;unceremoniously carted away to be a sacrifice to the bear gods

&gt;upon arrival, take a walk, talk about our problem

&gt;haha no

&gt;arrive, first thing Ursa Major says to my mother is, ""Throwing_pies gained weight!""

&gt;She's not wrong, but I couldn't have gained more than 5lbs, bringing my end weight to the grand planetary 
mass of 125lbs, versus Ursa Major's petite 250lbs+. 

&gt;things are off to a stellar start

&gt;sit on couches for about 10 minutes being awkward

&gt;mom realizes she had no gameplan, attempts to salvage the situation

&gt;""How about we all take a walk to the park?""

&gt;Ursa Minor says she can't, it's too late

&gt;It's 6PM. In the summer.

&gt;Ursa Minor says it's too cold

&gt;We live in California. *In the summer*.

&gt;Ursa Minor says it's too far

&gt;*It's fucking 4 blocks away*

&gt;Mother gives up, appeals to their bear instincts

&gt;""How about you take Throwing_pies grocery shopping for something for dinner? You two can bond! I'm 
sure you young people have a lot to talk about! Ursa Major and I will stay here and catch up.""

&gt;no.jpg

&gt;why.jpg

&gt;dontleavemewithheralone.txt

&gt;mentalshutdown.exe



I should note here, Ursa Minor has very low self confidence and is overall insanely sensitive, and at this 
point has dropped out of university due to feeling like people have been fun of her for being fat. That's 
right, not *that* people have been making fun of her, she just didn't like the feeling that people might be. I 
am a very blunt, socially unaware person, so leaving me alone with Ursa Minor over the years has only 
resulted in tears on her part, though I'm 5 years younger than her. Basically, putting us alone together is a 
bad idea, and I didn't want to be blamed for more shit that was clearly the result of two very incompatible 
personalities, that could be avoided by just not forcing us to interact.



&gt;Ursa Minor does not have this foresight

&gt;Fat probably clogged her brain

&gt;""Okay auntie, I'll take her!""

&gt;Ursa Major looks at my mother smugly

&gt;""It's a good idea, we recently found a really good store. You probably haven't heard of it though, but it's 
really great. A lot of healthy and unique foods, we go there all the time now. Are you still shopping at 
Safeway? You should be more aware of these things. You never change.""

&gt;are you fucking kidding me

&gt;mother just nods, sends me off

&gt;unceremoniously herded into the bear's transport

&gt;Ursa Minor attempts to make small-talk on the way

&gt;""How's high school?""

&gt;it's okay.

&gt;""How are your friends?""

&gt;They're okay.

&gt;""Did you make any more?""

&gt;Nah, I like my friends. Don't need more.

&gt;Launches into a lecture about how I should meet more people, like her

&gt;Biting back comments that she dropped out of college so who the fuck is she to tell me to be anything like 
her

&gt;""And how are your grades?""

&gt;Same as always

&gt;""You should work on making them higher!""

&gt;Biting back comments yet again 

&gt;""I had really high grades when I was in high school!""

&gt;The strain, it's killing me

&gt;""I had a lot of friends, too. You need to be more social. I know you were bullied a lot when you were 
younger so you don't like talking to people, but that's not going to change, you know. People will still think 
you're weirder than they do already if you don't make new friends.""

&gt;Really Ursa Minor? The one who dropped out of college from perceived slights wants to tell the girl who 
was actually bullied to just get over it? 

&gt;Stares out window, strain of keeping jaw shut is a workout on its own

&gt;Bear shuts its trap, finally

&gt;arrive at grocery store

&gt;it's Whole Foods

&gt;I notice they're out of my family's price range for weekly groceries, but fuck yeah if the Ursae want to 
treat us

&gt;Unsurprisingly, Ursa Minor knows her way around the store much better than I do

&gt;However, everything she picks is pretty typical and heavy, like alfredo sauces, gnocchi, heavy creams, 
marshmallows, chowders and other cream-based soups

&gt;why are we even here then

&gt;try to add more unique things like lilac blueberry chocolate, not the healthiest but sounds like something 
fun to try once

&gt;""Throwing_pies, no! Chocolate is bad for you! You'll get fat!""

&gt;wat

&gt;but okay, she's the one paying for it, fair enough

&gt;put it back

&gt;Yet Ursa Minor won't stop lecturing me on how unhealthy it is

&gt;Honest to god she follows me around the store talking about how bad for me it would be, keeps it up 
several minutes

&gt;No amount of, ""Okay, okay, I get it,"" stops the beast

&gt;Stop responding eventually, just walk way in front of her and do my best to ignore

&gt;Beast eventually falls silent

&gt;Until we get to the containers of gelato!

&gt;""Throwing_pies, do you want gelato?""

&gt;Say I don't know what gelato is but it looks alright, so yes, I'll have some

&gt;""Throwing_pies, how can you not know what gelato is?! You have to get out more, gelato's from Italy, it's 
like their culture's ice cream, it's...""

&gt;Lectures more

&gt;Lectures through getting gelato

&gt;Lectures through checkout line

&gt;Lectures in car

&gt;How the fuck can she think to lecture so much on goddamn gelato, I don't know

&gt;Tuning it out

&gt;Halfway through car ride back, notice the white noise has stopped

&gt;Hear a sob

&gt;Ohboyherewego.jpg

&gt;""Throwing_pies, I keep trying to talk to you but you don't talk to me!! We'll never make up! Why won't you 
just talk to me about something? I even bought gelato! I tried to teach you new things!""

&gt;""What can I say to someone who just talks about food?! There's nothing for me to say to that! I'm not 
that interested in food, I didn't even want to come grocery shopping! You weren't trying to teach me 
anything, you were just being patronizing!""

&gt;Here come the tears

&gt;Oh god

&gt;Pray that she can drive us home in one piece

&gt;She does, but upon getting inside, Ursa Major and my mother notice the sobbing bear

&gt;Mama bear comes out roaring

&gt;*""WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER THROWING_PIES. Ursa Minor, what did she say to you!??!?!""*

&gt;Ursa Minor tearfully, between heaving sobs, tells them that even though she tries to make up I just keep 
rejecting it

&gt;Ursa Major yells at me that I'm not making an effort

&gt;Yell back at her that, well, yeah, because they're the ones who want to make up, not me, so it's not on 
me to do anything

&gt;Yell that don't I feel bad for making Ursa Minor cry

&gt;Yell back that I can't help what people cry in reaction to

&gt;""Throwing_pies, this is why you have no friends. And you're gaining weight too, so don't think you're 
better than us!""

&gt;My mother realizes that even though I am smaller than a bear, I am more agile and therefore could defeat 
them in mortal combat, which is the direction this seems to be heading in

&gt;Rushes me out of house saying she'll speak to me

&gt;We retreat, Ursa Minor's sobs and Ursa Major's screams that I'm a sociopath ringing in our ears

&gt;Later, mother asks me what actually happened, I tell her

&gt;She sighs, says mother is just like daughter, and when they were young, Ursa Major's only method of 
communication was through being overly patronizing

&gt;Accepts that throwing_pies does not mix with bears... at least momentarily.

After Abandoning TubbyLumpkins to her herd, I fled to my aunts house and unpacked the car.

Now, I want there to be a happy ending to this story, I really do. I wish I could write that BondageFairy took up lifting and became an uber fit person, that TubbyLumpkins fell to the 'Beetus', and everyone lived happily ever after. 

As I sit here and type this I am deeply saddened about what happened after that trip. 

BondageFairy patched things up with her parents and came down to the city at the end of January. I saw Tubkins briefly on Jan 2 to pick up our gear from the freight Depo. Not much was said, but she was as unrepentant and fat as ever. 

BF and I picked up work in our respective fields pretty quickly and we decided to become room mates. It worked well, she worked nights in the hospitality industry, and I worked days in a regular 9-5 IT job. 

We rented a little flat in St Kilda, and life was good for a couple of months. I did notice that BF had started to put on a bit of weight though. She was spending a lot of time out with her workmates after work, so there was a lot of beer consumption. 

She had also developed a real ""cheese tooth"", and would always have some sort of soft Gourmet cheese in the house. She'd come home from work in the mornings, and before she went to bed sit down and eat a whole wheel with crackers. 

We were still feeling the gravity waves from FudgePumpkin's presence in our lives as well. Due to her shenanigans on the trip it had blown our budget and both BF and I had a sizable credit card debt to pay off. We pressed Tubby for her share, but she had stubbornly employed fat logic and said that she didn't owe anything because Bf's family were so ""mean"" to her over xmas. 

I kicked and swore about it but really I didn't want anything more to do with that awful hambeast, plus I was making good IT money so I cleared my debt pretty quickly. BF wasn't making as good money, so she was constantly behind the 8 ball for a while. 

I helped out when I could, and eventually we got everything sorted  out. 


For fast forward to about April / May. 

BF and I are doing out ""shift change"" one Friday night, I had just got home from work and she was getting ready to head out for work. 

As we are talking she casually mentions she is going out Saturday night. She has the night off work and she is going to a party.

Then she drops casually that TubbyLumpkins was coming, and asks if I want to join them. I politely decline and then ask WHY she is still even talking to FudgeWhumpus after everything she has done.

She days Whumpus is having a hard time meeting people / making friends in Melbourne and is kind of lonely. BF feels a bit sorry for her, so she is going to catch up at a party with her. 

I really wish I knew then, what I know now. It seems that BF was one of those people who was susceptible to falling into abusive relationships. If I could go back to the past, I would have laid down the law and stopped BF going to that party. 

It was at that party that BF met the ""man"" I will call ButtMonkey. Buttmonkey was related to Whumpus somehow, he was a friend of a cousin or something. I don't remember the exact link. I do remember that he was part of the Whumpus Supercluster of Hamplanets

ButtMonkey wasn't fat, but he was white trash through and through. I met his family once, and there were all awful, awful people. 

The ButtMonkey supercluster consisted of mum (Ham Planet Prime), and 4 moons. ButtMonkey was the only thin one. They were all single mums, and all massive. The smallest only having 4 chins. 

They all lived in the one house out in the Eastern Burbs of Melbourne. 

Well BF saw something attractive in ButtMonkey, and they started dating. He was 10 years older than BF (35 ish) and worked as a shelf stacker in the local market. He had all these big ideas, most of which had him getting into IT. 

He picked my brains about it, but really took a disliking to me when I shot down his ideas of becoming a top notch programmer at 35, when he had spent all his adult life stacking shelves. 

He was also a classic abuser and make BF think she was the center of the universe, while at the same time isolating her and also feeding her. 

In the first 3 months of their dating, she nearly doubled in size. 

I confronted her about all this, and tried to make her see what Buttmonkey was doing to her, but she wasn't having a bar of it. I was just jealous because she was happy in a relationship and I wasn't. 

That was her first use of fat logic. 

She gave me an ultimatum. Either I accept and like ButtMonkey, or we couldn't be friends anymore.

My brass balls clanged and I said in that case we were done. I started making plans to move out and she was spending all her time at ButtMonkey's house. She was now trapped in the gravity field of the White Trash Super Cluster. 

Whompus herself was forced to move back to Perth around then, because the company she was working for fired her. Apparently she ""Wasn't learning fast enough"" 

She flew back to Perth and her MotherPlanet got her, her old job back. 

BF and I parted ways. I got my own place, a 4 bedroom place I was sharing with my brother, CreepyBiPolarGinger and his friend CoolFatGirl 

I never gave up on BF, I kept trying to keep in contact with her, in hope that she would see sense. She never did. I do remember the heart breaking, tearful conversations I had with TBD and VM because she refused to speak to them, because the also did not like ButtMonkey. 

I did get a rambling hate filled FB message from her a few years ago. I think she was drunk when she wrote it. 

She rambled about how she was super happy, and that she had everything she wanted with ButtMonkey and that I was selfish for not accepting him. 

I think she was trying to convince herself more than anything.

As for me, that trip had a profound influence on my life. Up until that trip I was a pretty passive, introverted person. I really just went along with the flow, and did my best to make everyone happy.  

That man died somewhere out in the desert. I liken it to a Time lord regeneration. The old one dies, and the new one is built from the sum parts of what remains. 

After dealing with TubbyLumpkins and the nightmare week that was, I swore to never go through that again. I started to develop standards, I started to be more picky about what I would put up with. Lines in the sand were drawn. 

Because of those standards I have never had an experience like that again. It gave me the tools I needed to say no. 

So while Tubbylumpkins gravity sucked BF down to her doom, I used to to sling shot my way out of her solar system, and on to other more awesome places. 

So this is the end. 

It is not a happy ending, it is not a sad ending. 

The truth is, nothing ever ends. The world spins on, and we make our way through it as best we can. 

Take care, and lift well FPS

Little info about myself is that I'm 5'9"" 200 pounds powerlifter. For anyone who knows out there powerlifters aren't the ripped ones but I feel like I'm in pretty decent shape. I was 181 about one year ago and of course college hit and I packed on the 20 pounds and I've been trying to take it off and I want to say that my family here, which is what this subreddit is, has helped me see my errors in fat-logic. 

However, this isn't about me, this about my girlfriend. She is 5'10"" about 130 pds after kicking ass and losing 10-20 pounds and I think she looks absolutley amazing. What really bothers me is the fucking assholes who are her family making her cry because they want to have an intervention because of her ""supposed anorexia"" just because they are angry with her success. Nothing hurts more than having your girlfriend come home in tears because running into a fucking FAMILY MEMBER and hearing her say that she looks terrible because of the healthy, amazing choices that she has made.

I just wanted to tell you fine people that we are the unseen force that might save ours, and our future generations from being total lard asses that will drain our economy further.

One last thing is I broke my leg a month ago (right around when I found this subreddit) and seeing this subreddit made me realize that I can still fucking diet and do upper body weight lifting and fuck everyone else who is telling me to take it easy.

This is our life and we're making the most of it. A giant thank you to all of you.

&gt; We'll call her CW, due to the wonderful thing called hindsight

&gt; Have appointment scheduled later that day to get her belly button pierced

&gt; CW calls me to tell me she wanted to eat before the appointment after hearing horror stories about people passing out

&gt; Imhungryanyway.fuckyes

&gt; Tells me to meet her at Olive Garden at 1

Anyway at this point I ended up getting ready and rushing down to the Olive Garden because I don't want to keep CW waiting. 

&gt; Get there and tell the hostess I'm there to meet up with a cute little blonde girl

&gt;Right this way sir, they're right over this way

&gt; They're right over this way

""Oh hey, Xan. Sorry to order appetizers without you, but I couldn't wait tee^hee""

&gt;There she was

&gt;5'10"" and 250 lbs of ""real woman""

""I'm glad you finally showed, I'm starving.""

&gt;Look down and see three empty plates in front of her

&gt;Shoot CW a text

""What were the appetizers you already ordered?""

""Oh, just the calamari, lasagna fritta, and the caprese flatbread""

""You must not be too hungry then""

""Oh, of course I am I was waiting for you, silly.""

&gt;See waiter walking over

&gt;Asks me what I want to drink, takes drink order and turns around to get my tea

""Waiter! Are we ever going to get our orders taken!?""

&gt;The whale song begins

""WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES FOR HIS SKINNY ASS TO GET HERE AND I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I WANT!""

&gt;Waiter visibly sweating

""Of course miss, I'm sorry"" 

""I want the Tour of Italy and a refill on my Diet Coke""

""Okay and the soup or the salad?""

""Both""

&gt;CW and decide to share the chicken alfredo and we both get the salad

&gt;Try to ignore Meagham for the most part trying to enjoy my time with CW while waiting for our salad

""You know CW you should eat more...""

Don't worry, I'll feed your beetus people. I'll feed you with a sugary cliche from every hamplanet's vocabulary

""Men like real women, women with cuhrves. Don't they Xan?""

&gt;Retch

&gt;Gag

&gt;Not wanting a confrontation I change the subject

""Oh look, I see the waiter with our salad.""

&gt;Meagham's eyes light up

""Oh goodie, I could feel my blood sugar dropping tee^hee^hee.""

&gt;Waiter places the soup and salad on the table and turns to leave

&gt;Meagham takes a bite of a pepperoncini from the salad before anybody else gets a chance to even smell the italian dressing

&gt;Earth begins trembling

&gt;Veins begin popping out of Meagham's forehead

&gt;Whalesong.deathmetal

""WAITER! WHERE IS THE RANCH!?""

&gt;Waiter visibly cringes as he turns

""Miss, we don't include ranch unless specifically asked for.""

""I TOLD YOU I WANTED A SALAD WITH EXTRA RANCH!""

""Miss, I can bring you out a fresh salad immediately with ranch.""

""Good! This is coming out of your tip.""

Now this is a good point to bring up the point that all three of us worked for tips at the time, CW and I both worked at Beetus Hut, she as a server in the restaurant portion and I as a delivery driver. Meagham worked at a local Mexican restaurant.

&gt;Dafuq did she just say?

&gt; Server brings new salad covered in ranch dressing

""I said ***EXTRA*** ranch. This isn't even enough for her [CW] skinny ass. You must hate getting tips.""

&gt;Jaw drops

&gt;In disbelief anybody would even say that to a waiter's face

&gt;Rest of meal goes smoothly until the check comes

&gt;Meagham demands we split the $66 bill evenly

&gt;Rare moment of alpha

""No Meagham, I'm not going to pay $44 when I split a plate with my girlfriend that cost $10 plus $6 for our teas.""

""CW ATE SOME OF MY APPETIZERS TOO, AND I SAID WE SHOULD SPLIT IT EVENLY MEANING WE ALL PAY $22 EVENLY""

&gt;CW begs me to just give in and split the bill evenly

&gt;Motion waiter over

""I'd like to split the check between us. I'm paying for her [CW], and myself.""

""Well fine, but he's not going to get a tip from me since my bill is so high.""

&gt;Fuck it, I'll just leave the tip.

&gt;$20 on tip line of credit card receipt feelsgoodman.jpg

""He was a horrible waiter! How can you leave that much?""

""Because he had to deal with you.""

&gt;Stand up and walk toward the door

&gt;Waiting out by CW and my vehicles since I parked next to her smoking a cigarette

&gt; About to put out cigarette when I feel the earth shaking below my feet

&gt; She's bitching about how much of a dick I am

&gt;Enraged at the way this grown woman is behaving I make something up about forgetting my sunglasses on the table and find the waiter and give him another $20.

""I'm sorry about the way she treated you man. I hope you don't get in any trouble over her behavior. Do you think I could speak to your manager?""

""About?""

""I'd like to tell them how good at your job you are and not to believe anything Meagham said.""

&gt;Talk to manager and he told me not to worry, she pulls that same stunt every time


TL;DR

My ex-gf's best friend eats three appetizers totalling 2520 calories alone before I get to the restaurant, yells at the waiter for not reading her mind and knowing she wanted ranch on her salad at Olive Garden tells him to his face she wont tip him then demands to split the bill evenly even though she ordered $30 worth of more food than my ex's and my food combined. I tell her no, pay my portion and tip the waiter ridiculously and talk to the manager who tells me she does that every time she comes in."	t5_2vzax	True
1370967088.0	1g4mza	Aunt Piggy and the 6 Months of Hamplanet Hell	timesnowroman	377	68	32	"This is the story of a land whale who made my life and my families lives absolutely miserable for the ~6 months she spent living with us. This woman was such a rude, childish, entitled bitch that I could write a book about the hell she put us through. 

So some background... this lady, who I will refer to as Aunt Piggy, was the wife of my uncle. My uncle and aunt Piggy had come to America to try to get a green card. They had to submit some papers go through the whole application process blah blah blah... so for the time being they were staying at our house. 

The first few weeks went fine. It was awesome having two families live together even if it was in such a small house. However, at the end of the first month is when things started getting crazy...

So me and my mother had just gone grocery shopping. Since we had a second family staying with us (they were a family of five but had an infant) we stocked up with a lot more food than usual. So my mother and I put the groceries away and go to bed. That night we hear somebody lumbering around the kitchen but this isn't unusual as my uncle's family just came from overseas and their internal clocks are still a little wacked.
Side note: we are a low income family, so we get EBT from the govt to buy groceries.
So next morning I wake up. Go to kitchen to make breakfast for everyone as usual. I open the fridge door and I'm jolted awake. Dafuq?  The fridge is empty. Literally empty except for a couple of lemons and half empty containers. We  had filled up the fridge with enough food to last our two families a week. It was gone. Aunt Piggy comes down the stairs just then. 

Me: ""Hey Aunt Piggy did your kids take anything from the fridge last night?""

Aunt Piggy: ""Oh teehee me and the kids just had a little midnight snack"". 

Now, let me describe Aunt Piggy to you. She was about 35 yrs old, 5'3 and over 300 lbs. Her kids (my cousins) were all under 6 yrs old and had very average weight. I seriously doubt 3 little toddlers just ate a fridge full of food. But because I am a total beta I didn't say anything. Just gave her a dirty look an tried to scrounge up a breakfast with what little scraps she left.

This was nothing compared to what this woman would do in the coming months. 
She would constantly scream at my mother (my uncle was her brother) about trying to get her (Aunt Piggy) and my uncle divorced. 
She destroyed our furniture. She would rip our couches and chairs when we weren't home. 
She would beat her children daily (something we didn't discover until a couple of days before she left). 
She and her children would consume mass quantities of food for the whole duration of their stay. It got so ridiculous we had to start hiding food in our own house, which they would actively search for and usually find.

We went nearly broke because this damn Hamplanet would eat so much food.
They also used up huge amounts of water and electricity. A couple months after they arrived we got a call from the city asking us to check if we had a broken pipe due to the amount of water our household (a.k.a Aunt Piggy) was using.

1369605055.0	1f3osb	Cloudy with a chance of beetus rain. Behind ThunderFupa and her offspring Fupulous Minor in the checkout lane.	Bella139855	385	69	52	"Quick stop at Local Target for 2 things for my SO, and after negotiating myself with tunnel vision through aisles of ""stuff I don't need but I will buy it"" I emerged to the 10 items or less lane, right behind... ThunderFupa. 

TF has more fupas than an Asian dad has disappointed chins. Every glorious roll highlighted by her fashion item of choice, a mumu that could have fit her 100lbs ago, but now fits so tightly I muttered a little prayer for the top buttons in shock (aka...'jesus fucking christopher'...).

While unloading her cart, I happen to notice her top 2 layers that have invaded her sandbags region, would ride up on the rim of the cart when she reached down, then when she put her items on the counter, they would slap softly back down to reunite with their brothers and sisters. 

Her cart:
-2 6 packs of beetus minor
- 2 12 packs of mini cupcakes 
- 1 giant bag of peanut mm's
- a carton of kit Kats (yes. A carton.) 
- liter of Beetus major 
- And 4 boxes of little Debbie Cakes 

While she is unloading her cart she is visibly getting winded pulling items from her cart to the counter. Taking 2 breaks for a ""breather"". 

She catches my stare (and possibly mouth hanging open) and I, trying to recover from my realization that I am witnessing a fatpeoplestories and have my very own hamplanet sighting, scrambled to make small talk...

Before I could say anything I literally was bounced out of the way by the equator of her mouth breathing offspring, Fupulous Minor, in attempt to ""squeeze by"" me in the aisle .The aisle that is about 10 feet wide. Could not accommodate us both.

FM must have ""ran"" to get a forgotten item. My neck tingles at the whiplash and my mind in awe of my airborne trajectory.

She was carrying ANOTHER LITER of beetus juice and the biggest snickers bar I have ever seen. Which she is waving triumphantly at her mother. 

FM is even BIGGER than TF and complained that the snacks they bought for the car ride home was not enough and she had to have a snickers bar. She even said to gain the upper hand, ""besides I just ran to get you another soda"".

TF eyes wide in pure sugar high shook her head no.  (while the cashier was beginning to ring in the items, TF had opened the Debbie cakes and her Jabba the Hutt mouth damn near bit off her own hand feeding herself both cakes in one bite)

Turning around FM whimpered and looked down at her rejected snickers bar. She then opened the gigantic candy bar and ate that thing like a slut chuggs some D. There's no other way to describe how grotesque or glorious it was to witness that.

To cover up the fact that she had just eaten it anyways FM scrambles to open the mm's in order to (I assume) eat a few and throw off her mothers suspicion of where that king size candy bar could have possibly gone...

her hurculean strength had burst open the mm bag and the entire contents went flying! Raining mms on the floor and a few impressively in the air. 

TF in shock starts choking on her Debbie cakes and reaches to open the liter of Beetus Major that FM went to retrieve because it hasn't been bagged yet. 

The Beetus Major shaken up from FM ""running"" back to the register, explodes, and starts spilling all over her, her mumu, her gaggle of fupas, and onto the floor. 

I glanced at the cashier, who held my gaze while I slowly put my items on the floor. She nodded her head in approval, and I walked out. 

*Real Ending*
As I suddenly was witnessing a GGW wet t shirt try out that no one signed up for, I stood frozen in line waiting for someone to react. 

faster then the cashier could say ""clean up at register 10"" ThunderFupa and Fupulous Minor rolled to their knees and began frantically, as fast as their pudgy little fingers could, collect the Beetus Major soaked mm's that have been seasoned by the dirt from the floor. By the handfuls. 

It was then when I glanced over at the cashier...and as I lowered my 2 items to the ground with her nod of approval did I look over and realize  I was witnessing the Hamplanet Heisman. 

Mother ThunderFupa and Daughter Fupulous 
Weren't just picking the mms up. They were eating them. 


TLDR: ThunderFupa and Fupulous Minor literally consumed and showered in their hamplanet snacks raining down on them, before they even checked out. 

Sorry SO that's why I came home empty handed.

&gt;It's healthy, so let's eat a lot of it.

&gt;Sudden stomach pains.

&gt;Look for the knife someone is trying to murder me with.

&gt;No blood anywhere, so figure I've got gas. Healthy food does that, right?

&gt;Get up and walk around, use bathroom, stretch, whatever I could to feel better. Nothing works.

&gt;Hey, let's sleep it off. That works with headaches. Again, didn't work.

&gt;18 hours later, been in constant pain and lots of it. Difficult to move. 8 or 9 on a 1-10.

&gt; Drive to local E.R.. Surprisingly, I don't crash.

&gt;Answer tons of questions before getting a room. 

&gt;Nurse:""So, you're pretty healthy?""
&gt;Me:""Yeah, I'm in perfect health except my weight.""

&gt;..**except my weight**...

&gt;MRI reveals a burst(or nearly so) appendix

&gt;No surgeon at this hospital, so must transfer

&gt;In lots of pain still and have my first experience with morphine

&gt;omgiloveit

&gt;Transfer ambulance gets there and I see the gurney

&gt;Me:""That looks kinda small""
&gt;EMT1:""Don't worry. How much do you weigh?""

&gt;I lie. Tell him 350. Not a big lie

&gt;The EMTs exchange a look. EMT1 shrugs. ""We're not going very far.""

&gt;Jesus christ, they almost had to get the fat person gurney. I start to hate myself a little more.

&gt;Arrive at different hospital, multiple rounds of same questions before surgery.

&gt;Everyone always had a few questions that I responded to with words and phrases I was starting to hate hearing.

&gt;Other than my **weight**...
&gt;My **weight** is the only thing that...

&gt;Surgery(laparoscopic appendectomy) goes fine. Get lots of dope. Feel good except when I move.

&gt;I actually developed a slight dependency problem for a few weeks after I ran out because I took so many so often. I'm good now.

&gt;Fast forward a month or so. Followup appointment for staple removal and return to work form.

&gt;Nurse comes in, asks questions, I answer.

&gt;""Well, other than **my weight**..."" Holyfuck. Again? Seriously?

&gt;Nurse nods, smiles, continues conversation while removing metal that had been shot into my body.

&gt;Removes two on the side, the ones around my bellybutton, or navel or whatever.

&gt;butwaittheresmore.ronpopeil

&gt;There's a third hole that has staples.

&gt;The nurse moves my belly a bit to remove the staples.

&gt;She moved. My. Belly.

&gt;It was in the fucking way.

&gt;I cried a little as I stared at the ceiling. I really am fat.

&gt;She didn't move it much, and it was probably just to hold on while she ripped at my soul. But still.

&gt;My stomach was in the way.

And that, my friends is when I finally fully recognized that I needed to change. And I'm doing it. With the motivation I find here, and the advice I get from other places(and here to, but mostly elsewhere), I can make it. My exercise bike hurts my ass, and I don't think the resistance goes high enough, but I'm getting there.

Thank you all.

TL;DR - I'm fat, needed to go to E.R. from stomach problems. Had surgery. Realized that I was hamplanet and hate myself."	t5_2vzax	True
1365061865.0	1bndc6	Shit people say to keep you fat	x-treme	360	46	182	"Other than the fact that all of this happens to me all the time, this isn't really an entertaining fps. More of a public service announcement.


Bros that are starting their weight loss, i just have to warn you that people may try to sabotage your progress. These will be people that you care about. People whose opinions you value. It may be your parents, it may be trusted friends, it may even be a girlfriend or boyfriend. That is why it is dangerous. By counting calories, you are already more knowledgeable about weight loss than 95% of people out there. They will constantly throw fat acceptance and broscience at you. If you ever tell anyone you are losing weight, or they notice, they will offer unsolicited advice; most of it complete bullshit. Most of it from fatties. They will do everything in their power to keep you down at their level. They suffer the same hunger pangs that you do, and they know which buttons to push to make you want to eat.



Here are some things that i had to endure constantly, and i have witnessed happen to others. You guys are likely to run into the same thing. These are the tools they use to keep you fat. Don't listen. This will happen when you let your guard down and are at your most hungry/tired/vulnerable.


""You are barely eating at all and i am concerned""

""I think you may be anorexic""

""Don't change i like you just the way you are""

""I like guys/girls with a little meat on their bones""

""Just one won't hurt your diet or make you fat""

""If you eat less than X calories in a day, your body will enter STARVATION MODE and everything you eat will be IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO FAT and you will actually GAIN WEIGHT""

""But you are already skinny""

""That's not fat that's loose skin""

""You can't lose weight unless you eat 6 small meals a day""

""You are looking so unhealthy, you need to eat something""

""You should eat healthy like me""

""You can't lose weight eating that""

""You looked better before""

""That only works for you because you are young. Just wait til you hit 30. It is all coming back""

""All that running is so unhealthy for your joints""

""If you consume less calories than you burn, You will catabolise the muscles in your heart and DIE!""

""it makes me sad that you hate yourself so much that you feel the need to do this. You should learn to love your body like me""

""I heard of this guy once who ran marathons all his life and he just keeled over dead of a heart attack! Running is too dangerous""

Etc.


I have flipped out on people before for doing things like that, and it makes me so angry every time i see it happen.


IT may feel sometimes like everyone is against you. Sometimes you will be surrounded by people that ARE against you. All telling you that the things you have been doing that have caused your current weight loss actually don't work and you must be bulimic or on meth or whatever. 


But don't give up. You guys are going to make it.  If you aren't lucky enough to avoid people like this, you will soon realize why no one hates fat people more than an ex fatty or redpilled recovering fat person. Feel free to post any bullshit that people throw at you to try to keep you from leaving the pod."	t5_2vzax	True
1364688636.0	1bbwst	"""Tee-hee, I look like Marilyn Monroe, she was size 12-14!"" (info post with links)"	Master_McKnowledge	360	51	33	"I realise that a ton of fatties love to bring up the ""I have currrrrrrves like Marilyn Monroe"" thing. It annoys the fuck out of me (and everyone with normal logic, really). I thought someone should finally do a post with Marilyn Monroe's actual size.

It is true that Marilyn was a US 12-14. However, the thing that the fatties don't take into account is the conversion. It's the same way how the value of £10 in the 1950s isn't the same as £10 now. I like/wear vintage clothing (not hipster I swear, I just like the style sometimes), and I can happily tell you the size difference is about half or so.

This means Marilyn Monroe is actually a present US size 4/6 and UK size 8/10. In fact, her exact measurements are (from her dressmaker)
&gt;Height: 5 feet, 5½ inches  
&gt;Weight: 118-140 pounds  
&gt;Bust: 35-37 inches  
&gt;Waist: 22-23 inches  
&gt;Hips: 35-36 inches  
&gt;Bra size: 36D  

Suck it fatties, one of your thighs is large enough to be wider than her entire frame.

1363632610.0	1ajfka	Baconator II: Fudgement Day	DroppedMyOreo	378	68	110	"[This will make more sense if you've read this first!](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ah0si/sisterhood_of_the_traveling_hambeast/)

*Thanks so much to BattleTard for the title!*

Background: Sororities participate in formal rush to find new members. During this time girls who want to join greek life come to the house and meet the sisters, see the house and learn a little bit about the sorority. This gives us a chance to make a great influence on the people who are rushing, but not my sorority........... because we have the baconator.

&gt; Rush week rules require we give/ make available snacks and drinks to rushees. Baconator's favorite rule.


&gt; Most girls are out in the open part of the house to meet the new people. A few stay behind the scenes to help set up and make sure everything goes smoothly. Baconator was on this ""hidden in the back"" team.


&gt; First day: Snack was fruit cups to go with our tropical theme. Baconator doesn't waste time on fruit so it was fine (too much sugar for her probably)


&gt;Second Day: Snack was pretzels (airline stewardess theme) Baconator eats 4 full bags of pretzels that night, but we were able to get by on what she couldn't shove in her face.

&gt; baconator secretly vows to try harder. EAT ALL THE FOOD!


&gt; Preference Day: Last and most important day of the week. Day people and chapters pick their new members to give bids out to.


&gt; fancy day so we shelled out for fancy cupcakes. They were decorated with our mascot 

&gt; Expensive as fuck. Delicious as fuck.

&gt; Saw what dis bitch did to the pretzels, ordered extra cupcakes plus one for each active sister in the chapter.

&gt;  chapter loved me. Who doesn't love cupcakes?

&gt; Preference night: First round of girls come in personally put the cupcakes out, went really well


&gt;They eventually left, and we were rushing to clean up and set up before the next round.

&gt; One sister comes out from the back ""Guys where'd you put the cupcakes?""

&gt; No prob. ""Oh, there are like 60 in the fridge to keep the frosting fresh""  someone tells her.

&gt; lol nope. checked there, and the kitchen, and the dining room, and the den, and the ritual room.

&gt; Cupcakes pulled a houdini. 

&gt; ""Where's baconator?"" Fat girls have a sixth sense for cupcakes

&gt; Went to Baconator's room: Found her in her formal clothes, covered in frosting. She ate all of them

&gt; She ate 60 cupcakes. 60 whole cupcakes in a half hour. 

&gt;  readytopuke.jpg

&gt; rushes coming in ten minutes. No food. Oh fuck.

&gt; Went through the second round with no food. Went ok I suppose. 

&gt; Ended up getting in trouble for not having food out. Charged with ""dirty rushing"" 

&gt;$150 fine for breaking the rules

Moral of the story: Can't put hambeast out to meet people, cause she'll eat them. Hide her and she'll eat everything else.

tl;dr: baconator fuck over our sorority during rush week. "	t5_2vzax	True
1375398608.0	1jj100	The Funeral, the Fight, and the Beck-ham: Alpha Anti-Fatties	jenemangeplus	385	74	87	"So I read a post about people acting alpha (and the apparent lack of stories in that vein). The tale of the ex is a good place to start.
 
When I was a teenager, I met this guy, Jim. He was two years older than me, and we had that immediate, young-adult, scared-as-shit, so-in-love-it-hurts kind of attraction. Still, we were both coming out of bad relationships. His ex, Becca, had been fucking one of his best friends for months before he found out. He broke up with her instantly and was still pretty hurt. But we liked each other far too strongly to let it go, so we didn't.
 
As soon as Becca found out about us (oh, the days of MySpace), she tried harder than ever to get Jim back. He wasn't having any of it. She sent him drunken texts and pictures and would call him crying and tell him there was no way he could be with a girl as fat as me. I was too in love to give a fuck. She messaged us both on MySpace and demanded, ""HAHAHAHA WHERE THE FUCK'S ALL THE GIN.""
 
&gt;whatever bitch
 
A few weeks into our relationship, a family member died unexpectedly. My family was iffy on a new boyfriend attending the funeral, so he didn't.
 
&gt;Be dressed in all black

&gt;Funeral is sad, luncheon's no better

&gt;Everyone's crying

&gt;Can barely see through my tears

&gt;But that worker kind of looks like Becca

&gt;Oh

&gt;Oh.
 
The gin had not been kind to Becca. Jim had no secret about liking curvy girls (SRSLY U GUISE), but she did not have curves. She had cuuuuurves. I was kind of surprised, because, at 5'4"", she seemed to have ballooned up to 300 pounds or more. Eventually, her squinty little eyes spotted me.
 
&gt;It's gonna be fine

&gt;She's working

&gt;I am at a funeral

&gt;We will have an unspoken girl code between us

&gt;Haha nope

&gt;She comes over and suddenly my salad is on my shirt

&gt;""Oh, I'm so sorry! *tee-hee* I think I just...misjudged how much space you take up!""

&gt;She smells like liquor and nasty sweet perfume, likely to cover the stench of herpes

&gt;Briefly consider options

&gt;Emotions are running high

&gt;I will not be harassed by a ham planet at a fucking funeral. Nope.

&gt;I realize my advantage

&gt;Bitch, I go to Catholic school.

&gt;I am gonna strategize the fuck out of this fatty

&gt;""Oh, it's okay. Maybe I could get a damp rag from the kitchen?""

&gt;""Oh, let me just grab that for you--""

&gt;""Oh, no trouble! I'll walk with you.""

&gt;Her beady eyes desperately search for an escape

&gt;My family are already not pleased

&gt;She can't do it.

&gt;No one can out-strategize a girl educated by nuns. *No one.*

&gt;We start walking back to the kitchen

&gt;We barely get to the waitress' station before I unleash

&gt;""How fucking dare you. I'm at a funeral. Show some respect.""

&gt;""Just like you're respecting me and myyyy boyfriend by throwing your fat ass at him? You're so ugly and desperate, jenemangeplus.""

&gt;""He's not with you anymore! You were the one sleeping with someone else!""

&gt;And she says it

&gt;Oh god I can feel it coming in the air tonight

&gt;Hold on

&gt;""Well, men just can't resist my sweet body!"" she shouts. Little bits of slut spit hit me in the face. Her jowls jiggle and her fupa howls in triumph

&gt;I stand there for a moment, temporarily outwitted and disgusted

&gt;Smugly she picks up a sandwich on the station and takes a huge bite

&gt;But you don't understand

&gt;I go to Catholic school

&gt;I can shiv a bitch with a crucifix at a thousand paces

&gt;So I act like the sneaky angry heartbroken motherfucker than I am and I punch her right in the diaphragm

&gt;My punches are no joke

&gt;Fatty starts to choke on the sandwich

&gt;Doubles over, can't breathe

&gt;Nasty mascara and eyeliner clumps start to run and smudge

&gt;""You fat cunt,"" I whisper to her, almost affectionately. ""Don't ever come near me again.""

&gt;And guess what?

&gt;She didn't.

&gt;...for the rest of the day.
 
That's not the end of the story though. I told Jim about what had happened, and he was pretty angry with her (predictably), but Jim had a thing about honesty, and I could *not* keep it to myself. So we moved on.
 
Or so I thought.
 
Fast forward a few months later. Last day of school, fuck yeah. Most of the school wasn't even there (seniors had graduated, everyone else was off getting drunk) but my painfully sober friends and I decided to go. I was a few short days away from a beach vacation with Jim, and I was in a super great mood.
 
Until.
 
&gt;I hear rumbling outside

&gt;Strange

&gt;Must be a 16-wheeler trying to come down the street

&gt;Think nothing of it

&gt;Go down the steps, lalala

&gt;No one in sight

&gt;Suddenly, as I'm walking, I trip on something

&gt;Fuuuuuck!

&gt;Fall on the cement hard, scrape my palms and my knees

&gt;RIP tights

&gt;I hear

&gt;*tee-hee-hee*

&gt;I get up and there is Becca, now more like Beck-ham

&gt;50 more pounds to hate

&gt;Also has two idiot-looking girls with her and 1 guy

&gt;The trio have their fists up and they don't look happy

&gt;I am sorry, little stars, but you have been pulled into her gravitational field and now you must die

&gt;I don't say a word. I lunge for them

&gt;This is a violent city and I know how to fight like a maniac

&gt;Immediately dispatch the guy with hard kick to the balls

*^(^Sorry ^for ^every ^male ^who ^had ^to ^read ^that)*

&gt;He starts throwing up, he's out

&gt;Dispatch the next two girls rather quickly

&gt;One runs away crying that she didn't get paid enough for this

&gt;Just Beck-ham and I now

&gt;She lets out a whale song of unimaginable terror and rage

&gt;Bitch, I don't speak whale

&gt;She tries to run away

&gt;LOL

&gt;I'm on the track team

&gt;Take like three steps and outrun her

&gt;And I let her have it.

&gt;Can't punch her diaphragm now, I'd never see my fist again

&gt;Jesus god her breath is foul

&gt;Whatever

&gt;Split her lip and give her a black eye

&gt;She can't even raise her arm up

&gt;""Assault!"" she whines, wiggling her fat madly

&gt;That fucking smell

&gt;Eh

&gt;Two black eyes

&gt;For symmetry

&gt;She wails and whales, I give zero fucks

&gt;""Are you done?!"" I shout

&gt;She nods

&gt;""Done with what, fatty?""

&gt;""I'm not faaaaaaaaat!""

&gt;I start laughing. She is enraged but I don't care.

&gt;""Promise you'll leave us alone. Next time I'll call the cops. We have all those messages you sent us. You'll be done.""

&gt;She realizes she's pinned and agrees

&gt;Pick up my backpack and waltz off like a proud motherfucker

&gt;If she's Beck-ham then I'm Wayne Rooney

&gt;And she did not come back for more.

[Hammila Borrows a Cup of Sugar](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1eftjd/hammila_borrows_a_cup_of_sugar/)

Alright! Lets get started!

We had a couple of pretty gnarly storms that passed though here. One of them ripped apart my fence, but I wasn't too concerned about fixing it until the weekend. Think about [one of these fences](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/9moshi/9moshi1106/9moshi110600010/9793380-wood-fence-in-vertical.jpg), but much older and falling apart. My dog stuck around alright, so I decided to wait till the weekend to grab supplies and fix the place up. 

Saturday morning I drove out, grabbed supplies, and set up in the backyard. I was in my zone, and trying to figure the best way to rebuilt the thing. After a couple hours, I notice Sunflower peeking though the gaps.

Sunflower: ""Hey Wolfsong. Your dog got out and followed me home."" At this moment, she was bright red. I assumed it was a combination of being extremely shy, and thinking that she did something wrong. 

Me:""Oh! Sorry there Sunflower. Did she follow you back?""

Sun: ""No, she is in my mom's backyard. Mom said don't come over for at least a half and hour."" 
And then she took off. 

[MFW I couldn't figure out the wait time](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif). It would work though, since I was in the middle of cutting boards. 

40 minutes later I dust off, and walk over to Hammila's to grab Chell. I knocked on the door, and in typical Hammila fashion, she greeted me with a giant, wet, bearhug. 

[MFW the smell lingers](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gag.gif). 

Hammila ""Oh, Wolf. You know, it's rather rude of you to come over looking like a mess. Next time, put on a nice top when I invite you over for coffee.""

Me: ""Oh! I just came by to pick up Chell. Sorry she ran over here, I didn't think she'd leave the yard. I gotta fix my fence, but I'll swing by for coffee soon.""

At this point, I realize that the smell wasn't just Hammila, or the hug she gave me. Her house smelled like musty clothes, and sweat. That split second that I was noticing the house, was the second that Hammila grabbed my hands. 

Hammila: ""Next time, make sure to bring some cookies or cake for our coffee. It's rude not to bring anything to the host's house. I'll let it slide this time, though, since you'a young and was raised in the generation of selfishness. Annnnyway, come in.""

[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bitch.gif)

I wanted to tell her that I didn't have the time for coffee, but I was too shocked at the condition of her house. [It looked like this, but with more rotting garbage](http://www.everydayminimalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/hoarders-tlc.jpg). Hammila swung over to a sad-looking recliner, covered in a huge stain. She sat down, and barked for Sunflower to bring us coffee. 

Sunflower scurried in, and brought us two cups half filled with coffee. Right before I took a drink, [I noticed how dirty the mug was](http://www.pa-promotions.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dirty-mugs.jpg). 

[I seriously considered this as an alternative to drinking the coffee](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mats3g25Si1qjfrswo1_500.gif)

Hammila:""Oh, I was meaning to tell you Wolf. You should really stop running. I see you run past the house almost everyday. You should hear what everyone is saying about you. Don't you know how terrible you look when you run?""

Me: ""Oh, that's okay. I know I look dumb while running, but I accept it as a part of life."" I started to laugh to try and ease the tension. I notice that Hammila is dead serious. 

Hammila:""Now Wolf, I'm being serious. No one will ever find you attractive if you keep that up. You should look more composed, and sexy. It just looks like you gave up entirely. Hell, look at how you came over today.""

At this moment, I was [too shocked by everything to really react.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/anderson-judging-you1.gif)

Me: ""Well, I best get my dog and get going. I still have a lot of work to...""

Hammila:""Don't get all upset, girl. I'll help you out, get you some sexy clothes, and find you a man that likes real women.""

Me:""Don't worry, I'm not really into that. Sunflower, if you can grab me my dog. Thanks for the cof...""

Hammila: ""NO! DON'T YAH DARE GET THAT DOG SUNFLOWER. Now, Wolf, you can't leave just yet. We are going to discuss what kind of blouses would look best on your figure.""

At this point, I just wanted to leave. So much sensory overload. 

Me:""Sorry Hammila. I'm gonna grab my dog, and I'll talk to you later.""

I went outside, and Sunflower opened the back gate. Chell and I ran home, and fixed the fence. 

And to top it off, I run past her house twice a day on my daily runs. Fuck her. 

TL;DR: Dog follows Sunflower home. Hammila uses this as an excuse for me to come over for coffee. Tells me not to run because it makes me look ridiculous, and that everyone in town talks about it. Tries to keep my dog hostage to make me stay long. I leave, and now run past her house twice a day to give her something to talk about.
