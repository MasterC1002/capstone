I noticed that post yesterday, and I felt like it didn't fit in with the context of the subreddit. This is a high content community, we have a lot of questions, news and other interesting stuff. The post in question had literally zero content, it's a screenshot of a common Ubuntu operation with caption implying that it works as advertised.

I convened with the other mods, and we decided to delete it. We were reluctant to do it because it was getting plenty of upvotes (e.g. community approval), but in the end we still did. No one wants this to turn into another /r/pics, and yet for various reasons I feel like this is a danger if we let such low content posts stay.

I'd like to have your opinion about memes, particularly whether or not they should be allowed. We already allow them reluctantly, but this one is just giving me nightmares of /r/funny. The others mods don't like memes anymore than I do, and we sometimes consider outright banning them; but I believe this community belongs to its subscribers rather than its moderators, and this is a decision that belongs to you.

PLEASE UPVOTE THIS POST SO OTHERS CAN SEE, I DERIVE NO INTERNET POINTS FROM SELF POSTS. Also, please upvote even if you disagree with me, because it's important to get a wide array of opinions on the subject.

1357307839.0	15y7ly	What the hell is going on with Ubuntu? It's literally more Windows than Windows.	dalsgaard	490	141	187	"Disclaimer: I haven't used GNU/Linux distro's for a long time, but I just felt like sharing my enthusiasm.

I mean, I'm just surprised beyond anything. I remember installing various Linux distro's a decade ago, and spending hours upon hours getting everything to work. I had to build an LFS and learn bash, before I felt confident enough to call myself a ""Linux user"". Now the installation takes 10 minutes (Literally), and it installs ALL drivers, and sends me directly to a recognizeable desktop. No fiddling around in terminals. Even my fucking webcam works..... And ALL the buttons on my keyboard, even the ones adjusting volume, and touchpad! Wow! I NEVER thought that it would be possible to make it this user-friendly.

I installed Ubuntu again because I didn't want to buy a Windows copy, and because I've always prefered GNU/Linux over the other OS's on the market. I figured: Fuck it, I don't play  that many games, and the ones I do play like Minecraft are supported anyway. And all the applications are not really that big of an issue; since they have their (Admittedly) shittier Open Source counterparts. And then I installed it, and find out that Valve are going absolutely nuts and are currently porting a shitload of titles to Ubuntu. And Nvidia too! Video adapter drivers used to be hell, but all of a sudden I can literally run TF2 *better than I did in Windows*. It looks incredibly promising. I nearly came in my pants the first time I started steam natively in Linux without use of WINE. I was contemplating dual-boot, but you know what? No reason to do it anymore.

And the application called ""PlayOnLinux"" just taked WINE to a completely new level. I remember running notepad and the windows native calculator on that thing - but now I can literally run Portal2. And with great performance! I would never... EVER have expected that. I thought my decision to go Ubuntu would mean sacrifices, but so far I've been able to do everything I could before. No problems yet.

So far, I've only had one minor point of irritation with Ubuntu. The fact that there was an ad for Amazon in the unity sidebar, and the fact that Dash actually searches Amazon too, really made me irritable. That is not what GNU/Linux should be about. But knowing the OS, I knew that there was some kind of hack for it somewhere. I didn't even need the hack. I was happy to find that I could turn it right off in the privacy settings, and now I feel like a boss.

Even when I want to fiddle around and do the kind of stuff that I can't do in Windows, I can't tell you how much support has become easier. Using the apt-get install and adding repositories means that I can usually just google what my problem is, press CTRL+ALT+T, and paste whatever command is the solution. I vaguely remember having apt-get in Debian (And in Red Hat too); but I don't at all remember it being this easy. And solving technical issues in Windows honestly never has been this simple. I haven't been forced to use vi yet, and the only time I've had a crash in the past week was when my spotify script looped and flooded the memory. OK, I'm rambling and I'm going to stop now, because you already know all of this.

tl;dr: Ubuntu is fucking awesome, and GNU/Linux distrobutions have come incredibly far in terms of user-friendliness. I'm in awe, and just felt the need to share."	t5_2qh62	True

Nothing! It was way too much of a hassle! You buy Apple and everything works for you!"" I told him that my computer ran to my own personal preferences and I didn't want anything else to which he replied: ""You'll thank me later trust me!""

Yesterday, I was at my university library doing some work and this guy came up to me and said: ""If you bought Win 7 for that thing you made a big mistake!""

I administer well over 1000 Macs in an enterprise environment and was at a loss what to do when one of my Xserve machines died.  I looked at Windows Server and when I added it up I actually spit coffee out on my desk.  I decided to take the plunge and go with Ubuntu Server.  I bought the most expensive support package and bought the servers from eRacks.  Oh my god, I was just blown away.  Reliability is way up and I'm getting a raise for cutting costs.  The biggest thing I love is that, unlike Apple Enterprise Support, Ubuntu engineers are observant, understanding and most of all stay with you through the whole problem.  Switching to OpenLDAP and modifying the schema was probably the most difficult part, but once that was done everything else fell into place.  File Server is being run by a massive FreeNAS that I turned on and honestly wander by every now and again to make sure all the lights are green.  I'm taking all the savings from this years IT renewal and putting it towards Ubuntu training for the staff and also writing a plan for temporary employees to work off of Ubuntu workstations (primarily they work through web-based services so we can save a ton by switching them from Macs).

1375144325.0	1jbcrr	baffled a scam caller with Xubuntu today	xenodrone	279	49	131	"a few days ago I got a call from an indian accented man who told me there was something wrong with my computer. I said ""which one?...""(I have 3) ""the one you are in front of right now sir"" ""Uh... I'm not at my computer, I'm not even home"" (technically I was walking out the door to go somewhere) so he offered to call back, and being the type of person who gets a lot of these type of calls and likes to mess with them, told him to call back.

FF to today, he calls me back so I go to my computer (two of them really) and he tells me to hit Windows key+R to bring up Run and type systemvwr or something which shows a few things windows defender has flagged. I googled the command he gave me and read about the scam and continued to play along, only from my xubuntu computer from there on out. I told him I couldn't get the system viewer but that I had terminal and application finder. After a few back and forths about that he tells me to get Team Veiwer (basically VNC for dummies) which luckily has a linux ver or else my fun would have ended there. So I figure, ok, whats the worst he could do, gave him the login info and proceeded to hold back the laughter while he scurried his mouse around clicking away, trying to figure out what he was into and how to show me what was making my computer slow. Finally he asks what OS I was running and then he called his supervisor who told me there were dangerous programs on my computer. ""I haven't downloaded any dangerous programs"" I said. Then the supervisor directed me to go to another website, I guess since they couldn't ""show me"" these malicious programs they skipped the fear mongering and still tried to sell me one of their protection packages. I said ""no thanks"" and he said ""ok, thank you for your time"" Yea, thanks for entertaining me for 35 mins while you scrambled to pull your scam on me.

**TL;DR**
scam caller tried to convince me there was something slowing my computer, never asking what OS I was on, then looking like a fool when remotely viewing my xubuntu system before trying to sell me some BS protection package.

Luckily ubuntu has a forum full of knowledgeable people who seem to spend their time helping others. I was lucky enough to talk to two of these people, the pure dedication and patience these people helping me displayed should earn them nothing short of a knighthood! One guy spent the best part of 3 hours helping me to figure out the problem, the other spent a good half an hour explaining a simple command. Both these people helped and enabled me to fully install and use my software. I just want to make a note of how grateful i am for these people's help.	t5_2qh62	True

- no more interest in RSS (killing Google Reader, no more direct RSS feed for Google News, link at the bottom though)
- killed SyncML, iCal and more (they told people to use CalDAV instead)
- killed CalDAV, too (use our proprietary Calendar API instead)
- XMPP/Jabber (Google Talk has been deprecated and Hangout doesn't support talking to non-Google contacts anymore)

Of course this only concerns Google Services, which users of Chromium don't have to look at. But it shows that Google is trying to work towards its own walled garden.

Why use the browser of a company that doesn't have freedom, openess and privacy in mind when we already have a well working, well tested and universally accepted alternative from a non-profit foundation that values the above?

For those of you who don't know me, I am Jono Bacon, and I work at Canonical as the Ubuntu Community Manager. I have been there since 2006, and I lead a team of five that is growing the Ubuntu community in various areas. I am also the author of The Art of Community, founder of the Community Leadership Summit, and I play in a metal band called Severed Fifth.

I was thinking about doing an AMA, but wanted to guage the interest: I would be happy for folks to ask my anything, which may include:

 * Ubuntu's direction and focus.
 * Canonical, its decisions, and where we are going.
 * How different parts of the community are working.
 * What my team does, where we do it, and how we work.
 * Anything personal related to me, my opinions, or thoughts.
 * Or anything else!

If there is some interest I will do it, if not that is fine too."	t5_2qh62	True

the ubuntu smartphone OS is getting some very enthusiastic responses (along with some valid concerns raised), and i know that i for one would love having a non-droid, non-iOS option for a full-featured linux phone (esp if it could double/triple as a desktop/tv interface!).

so, let's ask for it! the big hurdle here is to find a vendor/carrier combination willing to take a chance on a new OS. Canonical's doing what they can, making it hardware-compatible with android devices, supporting webapps and native tech to jumpstart the app ecosystem, and offering engineering support for interested OEMs, but no-one's going to take the chance if they don't see a potential market, so let's let them know there's a market here!

it took me 2 minutes to email Sprint, HTC and Samsung to let them know that I'd be highly likely to buy a solid piece of hardware with ubuntu for phones, so let's do our part and help make this happen!

thanks for listening :)

I just booted up Ubuntu Quantal in a virtual machine, tried to get to the package manager, typed in ""packages"", and got a screen full of ads.  Screenshot:  https://launchpadlibrarian.net/119522288/unity.jpg

I don't care that it can be disabled.  This is far from acceptable default behavior.

Bug I opened:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-lens-shopping/+bug/1065720

Edit 1:  This may be a good time to point out that your votes here affect how many other people will see a post, and that may make more sense than indicating how you feel about a subject.

Edit 2:  I probably should have linked to this bug instead of creating a new one:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-lens-shopping/+bug/1054776 ""Don't include remote searches in the home lens""
I apologize for missing when I looked, I was somewhat distracted by anger.

Edit 4:  People are accusing me of clicking ""more suggestions"" to get the screen full of ads, and lying about what what I actually did.  And Keithinator provided a screenshot as evidence that I'm lying.  It's incredibly offensive that you folks just believe him instead of considering how I might not have lied.  In fact, the difference is I had a clean default install of Quantal, and Keithinator did not.  He installed gdebi and synaptic before he took his screenshot.  It's different, it's slightly less offensive, but it's also not default behavior.  You guys have a serious witch hunting problem here.

1362788930.0	19y12z	Ubuntu gamers, I made a utility to improve gaming on Ubuntu by running games in a separate X server. Care to help me test it?	michaelpb	190	35	54	"Last weekend I threw together a little GUI  utility to make the process of running games in a separate X server really easy. I wrote it very quickly (heh) and it probably has lots of bugs, but this week it worked well for me in replaying  Bastion. Now I'd love to get feedback from other Linux gamers! :D

**Screenshots, and download link:** http://michaelb.org/fsgamer/

Make sure to follow the installation instructions, there are a few terminal commands to run.

Benefits of running a game this way:

* No matter what the game is, you can easily switch between the game and your normal desktop using `Ctrl+Alt+F7` to get back to your desktop, and `Ctrl+Alt+F8` to get to your game. Even games that typically prevent `Alt-Tab` cannot block these keys!

* It may run faster, especially if you are using a Unity on 12.04

* If the game crashes the X server for some reason it won't take out your other applications

* Even games that allow switching back to other applications sometimes mess up when you restore their size, or take a while to minimize, or have various other mess-ups with full screen such as the menu bar appearing over them. A separate X server will always be fullscreen with no fuss.

Future plans: I have a few more ideas floating in my head to use this system to make multiple monitor gaming *just work* on Linux, by making your primary x session stop using your first display, then running a separate x session with the full screen game in the new display. This way you can keep your normal desktop running with windows, etc, and use Ctrl+Alt+F7 and Ctrl+Alt+F8 to switch between the game and your desktop, as with the single monitor (I think that would work, right?). Thoughts?

Note: I was learning `quickly` and Gtk in the process, so it is very sloppily coded and filled with hacks (the goal was just to get something to work). Because of this **if you are running OpenBox it won't start**, sorry :P I'll fix this when I get a chance

Now when I press the super key the dash actually opens instantly. The multimonitor support has improved drastically. Actually being able to change the launcher size, reveal and colors without a third party tool is nice an while I'm not using HUD terribly often, when I do think to use it, it's pretty neat.

I've been wanting to use Linux for a while, but never found a distribution that was exactly ""calling"" me. There were things I liked and really strongly disliked about KDE, gnome-shell, Unity, etc. The varied strong opinions of the Linux userbase on both distributions and DEs were both great but also very disconcerting, because so often they would not say why their setup is the best, but why *others* were not the best. 

Anyway, I just tried the beta for 12.04 and finally realized I had been using it live off my USB for 3 days, so I figured why the heck not install it. All my material is backed up, anyway. All the quirks about Unity that I did not like in the past are different or gone to a point where I enjoy using the computer now. The only thing I wish would happen is for some video streaming site like Netflix to switch over to HTML5, which I'm sure will happen someday, but it's just too bad it's not right now.

Deserved, admittedly--I don't hold it against you for your posts. The error is all mine here, and I apologise for that.

I only recently became a mod of /r/Ubuntu, which I requested because I'm a firm believer in the philosophy behind the operating system. I've been using the OS for about five years now, and I've since then become both an Ubuntu Member, and an IRC operator in the #ubuntu-offtopic channel on freenode. What I ask is that you don't question my motives, but rather, question my lack of judgment.

When I (loosely, very) tallied up the posts in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/c8jig/are_requests_for_tech_support_relevant_on_this/), I got the impression that people didn't want tech support requests in the subreddit. Having since looked at the comments in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/cat8p/give_me_a_fucking_break_the_mod_here_ihavelund_is/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/capvy/the_community_has_spoken_take_tech_support/) thread, I can only admit that my maths was wrong, and I've reversed the decision. It was wrong, I agree, and I should have a) given the original thread more time to gather opinions and votes, and b) consulted with others before implementing such a change--something I did not, and which I regret.

We're all human, and we all make mistakes. Mine was being an over-eager mod, willing to please the subscribers of this subreddit. I can assure you all that I've learnt my lesson, and I'm more than happy to admit that.

If any of you have *any* comments on how this subreddit should be governed in the future, feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Ubuntu) (SamsLembas and myself), or even me personally. I love Reddit, I love Ubuntu, and I love this subreddit, and there is nothing I want more than to keep this a thriving community.

I hope you all understand--and again, thank you for engaging in a dialogue."	t5_2qh62	True

However, I've noticed something different about /r/ubuntu... The problem is a lot worse.  We get a lot more questions, comparatively, than /r/apple.  The reason - I believe - is because more questions are *answered here.*

I'm kind of tickled pink that no matter how hard a linux user will try to defer people in need of help to another sub, they sometimes can't help but offer assistance themselves.

This, for me, completes a larger part of what a Linux user in defined by - a compulsive helper.  Most of us hate the idea of someone struggling with Linux because we know how simple it can be.

1364908226.0	1bigrt	[RANT] Ubuntu and proxy settings: is this a joke??	il_marcello	161	25	55	"I am a long time Linux user, and I love Ubuntu. I use it at work and at home and I'm in general very happy with it – but today I want to share with you one of the biggest frustration I have with it. Sorry for the rant.

My company recently moved to a proxy-based Internet connection for all employees, so I had to set up a proxy in my Ubuntu 12.04 machine. I thought this would be as simple as adding the correct settings in the System Preferences, but alas nothing was farther from the truth.

It turns out that only a bunch of applications honor the global Unity proxy settings: other applications  use their own configuration and refuse to read the global settings. Other applications, even fundamentally important ones like apt-get, need the proxy to be set in their own configuration files.
To make things worse, some other stuff like adding a PPA to the system do not even use their own settings, so a clunky workaround is needed for them to work.

So far this is the situation as I see it:

1- the first step is to enter the proxy configuration in the system settings. This dialog should set the environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy, etc. There are two problems with this: the first is that not all applications seem to be happy with the lowercase variables (http_proxy), but for some mysterious reason some want the uppercase version of the variable (HTTP_PROXY). 

The second problem is that the config dialog does not give the option of entering a username and password for the proxy, and it refuses to save the settings if you use the usual syntax (http://username:password@proxy/)

2- so naturally the second step is to set these values in the env variables by hand using the command line, and figuring out why these settings are not persistent between reboots.

3- third step, set up the proxy config for the programs that ignore the environment variables. In these category fall programs such as firefox, thunderbird, chrome, skype etc., which have their own individual config dialogs (and where the “use system wide settings” fails to work).

4- fourth step, bang your head on the wall because you cannot update your system, until you realize that a fundamental building block of Ubuntu such as apt-get wants the proxy settings to be entered individually in the configuration file (/etc/apt/apt.conf) and simply ignores the env variables.

5- discover now that if you need to add a PPA or a key from the keyserver this is still not enough, you need to use a workaround. To add a key you must use this syntax:

    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver-options http-proxy=http://URL:PORT/ --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys GPG_KEY

While to add a PPA you must explicitly tell sudo to consider the environment variables:

    export http_proxy=http://&lt;proxy&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
    export https_proxy=http://&lt;proxy&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
    sudo -E apt-add-repository ppa:whatever

I feel that this problem needs to be addressed ASAP if we want Ubuntu to gain traction in the corporate world. The current state of things is simply not acceptable.

1337946486.0	u4c3b	Ubuntu is enjoyable to use.	SharkWhale	161	32	84	"For the first time in all the years I have been using computers, which has been many years, I actually enjoy using an operating system. My experience with operating systems has always been neutral or frustrating however after using Ubuntu 12.04 for a few months, I am beginning to feel differently. I found Unity wasn't to my liking in the previous two releases but this time round, I understand what it is trying to achieve. 

I have always liked Ubuntu and used it on and off over the years since Dapper Drake but I never stuck with it, there was nothing that really made it different from other Linux distributions and other operating systems. Like all the others, it used the standard desktop layouts, functioned pretty much the same, essentially it was just another one to choose from. 

Now, with the improvements to Unity and the introduction of the HUD, the traditional desktop seems dated and messy, a bit haphazard. For example, I sometimes use my girlfriends laptop which has Windows 7, I feel it looks cluttered, there is so much going on. However, in Ubuntu, there is very little going on, the menu bar is hidden, the tray icons are all the same colour. Windows Explorer filled with the various textures and multiple bars but Nautilus is more calm and softer. The start menu, though the Unity bar is not that far removed from it, seems a bit strange. The same goes with drop down menus, the HUD makes more sense. Ubuntu seems to alleviate the stress by not bombarding various bits of information all the time. It is much more quieter in a sense.

Another point is the post-installation process. After installing Windows 7 the laptop and I spent about twenty minutes tweaking Windows - removing icons from the desktop and taskbar, reducing the size of the icons and the taskbar, adjusting performance settings, installing free software and missing drivers, turning off all the Windows features - of course it is not something that needs to be done often, it is still a bit of a chore, whereas with Ubuntu 12.04, all I needed to do was set the Unity bar to autohide and just get on with using the computer. I just don't need to be adjusting lots of different things after every install. Most software I needed were included as well. Other Linux distributions and previous Ubuntu releases needed a bit of tweaking. It gets old after a while.

All in all, I'm enjoying my time using Ubuntu."	t5_2qh62	True

I have to congratulate Canonical and the Ubuntu team (whether paid or volunteer) for this release.

This is probably the most user-friendly (and definitely most noob-friendly) Linux I have ever seen.

My personal favorite touch is the smooth, seamless color transition of the Unity panel to match the background.  Such a small detail, yet it is these little details that add up.

Just installed 12.10 a new machine. Let it take a photo with the webcam for my account during setup. 

Set up a jabber account in empathy with google talk. 

Later, discover that google public profile, and google talk on mobile, has DELETED my old profile pic, and is using the image I took setting up my new computer. 

WTF?

a) It never asked permission
b) It never indicated this would happen
c) Old google profile pic is totally deleted, can't recover it. 

I'm really annoyed by this. Had the photo been really stupid/goofy/NSFW (and why not, its just for my own personal computer) this would be a huge problem. 

Does anyone know why this happened, and what can be done about it?

But the fun part is that the mangled image you see in the background comes from a website opened **on my girlfriend's gnome session**. 

She has an active session where she left a website opened and I'm able to see it on my own account through dash.

While in my case it's a bit funny (I'm even tempted to leave porn sites opened on my account just to mess with her), this
can have serious ramifications for other people.

So I guess it means that if you access sensitive stuff on a shared computer running Unity, leave nothing opened, even if you lock your account :)"	t5_2qh62	True

**EDIT** [Pinguy OS on Facbook.](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pinguy-OS/139771989377056)



This is the copy I install on friend's and family Laptops/PC's. I have got such good feed back for this OS that everyone that is using it has been asking me why I haven't put it on the web. So here it is.

There isn't any 32bit version because I have a 64bit PC with 4GB of ram and I am never going to run a 32bit OS on this PC.

All this Distro is, is a custom built Ubuntu 10.04 LTS x64 that can run as a Live DVD or be installed, it has all the added packages needed for video, music and web content .eg [flash and java](http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4931/plugins10001.png), plus I have done a few fixes as well. like fixing wireless problems, gwibber's facebook problem and flash videos in fullscreen.

Everything is setup for samba, all you need to do is right click a folder you want to share and add a password in samba using system-config-samba.

I have added a Upnp server as well so you can share your music, video's .ect with a PS3, XBOX 360 or any other Upnp media reader.

Nautilus has been changed for Elementary-Nautilus with added plugins so it can get music and video art from the web.

The default theme is Elementary using ttf-droid font with Docky and a custom Conky.

The tv plays youtube, the middle speaker controls volume while the one on the left and right open up Rhythmbox and VLC, the cabinets are notepads, the trashbin is clearly a widget, the clock and alarm clock actually work, the books also serve as launchers, the top bar with the date lets me know of future events. I created the desktop for fun, but don't really recommend it as screenlets seem to use a lot of RAM.

[update]JohnPickens called this ""Ubuntu Bob"" and it got me thinking. You could really play around with this design and make it even better if you used multiple desktops and each one represented a different room. The way I would do it, is use Compiz to make a cube, invert the cube (in the options) so that I'm on the inside of the cube, and then make each wallpaper a different section of a house for example: one is the entertainment room, one is the office, the other is studio..etc..  I think it's possible with the tools we have in Karmic.

[Update 2] A few people commented that they'd like to see me prove this desktop works. So I figure if I'm going to go through the trouble of making the video, 'll show it off by implementing the feature in my first update.

A few weeks ago, on a whim, I installed Ubuntu on an old netbook where Windows had gotten corrupted.  I was going to donate or trash the netbook, so I figured, *why not take a shot and install Ubuntu to see what all of the fuss is about?*

I was so impressed with Ubuntu out of the box that I [posted about my experience here on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/z7yoq/long_time_windows_user_new_to_ubuntu_how_can_i/).

Even after several weeks, I'm still loving Ubuntu.  It really breathed new life into my netbook, which I was going to give away because I assumed it was useless.  I'm so glad I installed Ubuntu.

I didn't like the Unity interface, but with some Reddit and Google help, I installed the Gnome interface and really like it.  I love the package manager and updates.  Also, I don't know why, since the hardware is the same, but Ubuntu seems to manage my wireless connection much better than Windows.  It's much more stable.

I've been amazed at how helpful and nice the Ubuntu community has been to me.  My wife has heard me praise it so much that she's considering letting me install Ubuntu on her laptop.  I told her that she could always dual boot into Windows if she likes.  I just want to say thanks again to all of the wonderful people who work on Ubuntu!"	t5_2qh62	True

I am newish to linux and ubuntu but I think I see a parallel that needs examining.

Here is how I see things as an avid Android consumer and partial developer. Android and Ubuntu are both open source and share some very close similarities now that Ubuntu Touch is out. But both are open source. Canonical is starting to act more like Google in terms of how it is building its OS. They are going their own direction to a certain extent and in my opinion, the product is great. Different, but great. Google does the Same with Android.

However, they both release their source code and third party developers make their own distros or their own custom OS. In the Android world we have AOSP, the source, and third party developments. AOKP, CyanogenMod, and Paranoid Android etc. This is very similar to how Linux is panning out. There is the Source, and different ""flavors"", Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, Linux Mint, Backtrack and many others. More than I can list or know.

In both worlds, Android and Linux, each different operating system brings something different to the table and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Also, both Android and Linux have changed drastically since their beginnings. It happens and it is a good thing.

Now i understand the Canonical/Ubuntu - Google/Android parallel isn't exactly equivalent. Where I see people getting upset is long time users who have used Ubuntu since maybe the beta days and don't like that it is very different from how it used to be, especially the 12.04 to 12.10 jump.
Here is what i say to you. If this upsets you, stock Ubuntu isn't for you anymore. Try another distro or install Cinnamon or something to that point. Make Linux your however you need to. Don't get angry because something changed! The change and the evolution is what brought me to use Linux/Ubuntu. Over the years I tried to like Linux, many times, dual booting and live CD's but I kept falling back on Windows when it didn't work. Now, with 12.10, I can say that, Linux works for me, and many more people. Isn't that the whole point??"	t5_2qh62	True

At this point, I was filled with a tiny bit of rage. You see, these people are talented developers and they're clearly unhappy with what they're seeing in gnome-shell. So they've taken time out of their busy schedules to create something more akin to the way Gnome 2 worked.

Except this is completely redundant. We already have Cinnamon and Mate, and the Gnome team have finally released some screenshots of gnome-classic mode.

This means we now have 4 teams all trying to solve the same problem, one of which is the *official* team.

As a ""fixed funding"" fundraiser, Indiegogo will refund your money if the fundraiser fails. Simple as that.

Let's say that the fundraiser succeeds and a device is made. Will you be out ~$800 if the device sucks or you otherwise hate it? No.

Copied from the fundraiser's FAQ:
""What warranties apply to the Ubuntu Edge?

A standard manufacturer warranty will apply. If you are not happy with the product, you may return it within 28 days of receiving it for a full refund. Please note, Canonical can not cover the cost of the return postage and packaging.""

So, you still get your money if you hate the phone! The only way you don't see your money again is if you love the device. This also adds pressure on Canonical to make a beastly phone, or else they'll have to refund $32 million themselves and lose money.

So are there any risks? I don't see any. If you simply don't have the money, that's fine. But if you're interested, you've got nothing to lose."	t5_2qh62	True

I've been using Ubuntu for about 2 years. Before that I used fedora, suse, slack, debian, and mandrake. I own my own IT business and manage a bunch of linux servers regularly, so I'm by no means a linux noob.

But for the past 2 years, when it comes to my home desktop, Ubuntu has spoiled me in ways only Windows could. Everything simply works. I use the terminal a lot, but things are still simple in Ubuntu. Today I went through Debian, Crunchbang, Fedora, Arch, and one other that I already forgot. Each distro I found something that annoyed me, because it was SO simple to do the same thing in Ubuntu, and I had gotten so used to doing it the easy way, that I simply got frustrated having to do it the long way, and said screw it. Obviously Arch is going to be a nitty gritty distro, but even in Debian and Fedora I found things that annoyed me.

Well, what do you know, I'm currently setting up a new installation of Ubuntu on my desktop, as I'm typing this on my Bodhi-based netbook (yes, even a lightweight distro had to be based on Ubuntu for me to like it).

Have I gotten lazy? I don't know. Maybe having to deal with servers all day in the terminal, when I back out of it and just use MY computer, I guess it's nice to have everything simply work, without having to mess with much? Anyone here notice anything similar?"	t5_2qh62	True

John here from Minus. We are very excited to release our first official Ubuntu app. The ubuntu package is made and tested on Ubuntu 10.10. User need to install the runtime library Qt first before running minus by running command ""apt-get install libqt"".

We are working hard to polish and release few new API calls to allow for authentication and the next release will have Minus Account Support.
 
The new app can be found [here](http://min.us/pages/extras) and we will be keeping everyone updated via our http://blog.min.us on new releases, be sure to send us feedback!

**Edit**: The application basically allows you to drag files and pictures into the icon in your taskbar, and then into the panel popup. It will then automatically upload to Minus and output a ""gallery share url"" and ""gallery editor url"" along with direct file URLs for the uploads. We do not support user accounts yet but soon will. Additionally you can set the application to start on system startup.

**A).Get redshift from the software centre. This app reduces the colour temperature at night, which reduces strain on the eyes as well as helps you fall asleep.**

For the newbies on this forum, this is how you can start it up every time you log in:

1) Create a file called redshift.sh. Put it in any folder you like.


2)Add these lines:


\#! /bin/bash


gtk-redshift -l [Latitude]:[Longitude] -t [Color temperature at daytime]:[Color temperature at nighttime]


an example would be 


gtk-redshift -l 30:9 -t 6100:4300


3) Make the file executable by right-clicking on it and going to properties &gt; permissions


4). Now go to startup applications and add this file to the list of startup programs.


**B). Use xbacklight to lower screen brightness at startup**


Create a file and add these lines to it:


\#! /bin/bash


xbacklight -set 45


Make this file executable and a startup program as I have shown you how to in the first example.


The brightness will automatically be set lower every time you login. Unfortunately, the brightness is still set to maximum when you get to the login screen but I normally just login without looking at my screen.


I don't consider myself to be an expert by any means. If you have any tips, please share them!

The ability to hit the super key and just start typing whatever file or program I'm looking for is pretty spiffy.  I've heard most people on this subreddit complain about the limitations of customization; specifically, the inability to move the Unity dock to the bottom of their screen.  Am I the only one who actually likes it being on the left side?  I like the integrated application menu being at the top and I love how they've maximized the amount of real estate applications now consume.  Are most of the complaints rooted in the fact that people don't like change?  This is pretty strange considering people who use Linux distributions are supposed to be champions of change.

Well I'd like to make a short apology to Canonical for doubting their (lets face it) bold move to this new GUI. I've just installed the beta 2 and after trying it out for a few hours it's looking good. On my system at least (using the ATI proprietary drivers) it's working like dream, and it looks pretty swish to boot.

There are a few issues.

* Some of the animations can be a bit twitchy.
* Still needs more polish, for instance the global menu flickers when mousing over different menu items.
* The ""Snap"" window animation is pretty ugly, mainly because it only expands fully if you go right to the very edge of the screen.
* It would suck with multiple monitors.
* More work on the customisation options is needed.

You know, actual user testing, the results surprised me. 	PossAbilities	203	108	110	"She had been using an older version of Ubuntu for about a year, but had otherwise used Windows her whole life. She initially transitioned into Ubuntu smoothly and painlessly, everything just worked and the interface was familiar. A year later she has even started complaining about having to use windows at work. Given the great success Ubuntu has been for her so far, I offered to upgrade her to the latest version, and she was more than happy to try it out.

I was expecting her to not care either way, since I hadn't mentioned there would be a new interface, she is not overly fussed by most things, nor had she heard anything from the hordes of fanboys online.  So, the result?

Within minutes she started screaming at the computer, and blaming me for having ruined everything, her first impression was that she wanted to revert her back to the older version. 

Her exact quote was ""I don't mind them changing things, but why did they have to change so much at once? Where are my menus? How do I find anything?"" I left her to figure it out, since again I didn't want to shape her conceptions. She soon figured out how to search for apps, but the instant she did, she howled in disgust at the search results featuring amazon and random system files she couldn't even use. Her example was: search for games, the results are gbrainy and a games folder which doesn't contain most of her games. Its not that she doesn't like searching, its that she thinks the search is broken. 

At this point I explained that she could choose gnome classic at login, and disable the amazon search results and the universal taskbar. To which she replied with disdain ""But why should I have to?"", a question I had no good answer for. 

I've asked her to give the unity interface a longer trial to see if she gets used to it. She has agreed to try it out for a few days, on the condition that if she still doesn't like it, I will make her laptop exactly like my desktop (Mint 14) 

  I remember distinctly, after cursing the designers out for ten minutes, and explaining to me that a search filter is not a menu bar, she ended her tirade with ""what idiot didn't hire UX designers?""

After trying all the Q-tip nonsense, I just settled for using headphones.

After installing Ubuntu, the first thing I noticed was my internal speakers were back and the red light was gone.  I installed OS X again just to make sure, and the problem was back.

1367193743.0	1dax9f	Hey Canonical, where is our window corner antialiasing?	vemacs	123	31	39	"1. It's been ""fixed"" since [pre-oneiric](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/08/brave-compiz-prerelease-testers-wanted), and as I recall by a mailing list message, was promised to be shipped for Oneiric.

2. It's been delayed further, by [pushing it back to Quantal](http://www.iloveubuntu.net/anti-aliased-corners-probably-land-precise1-probably-skip-ubuntu-1204-lts).

3. It's 13.04 now, and we still don't have a fix. This ""minor detail"" is something that a lot of people notice, is especially noticeable when using a dark-on-light or [light-on-dark background](http://opensas.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/my-desktop.png), 

And frankly, this is just one example out of many of Canonical's numerous delays and the failure to make a splash in a desktop market. The first thing my mom commented on switching to Ubuntu 5 years ago was ""it didn't seem polished enough"", and she noticed the window corners. 5 years later, it stays the same way, despite a fix [being tested numerous times](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ayatana-ubuntu/+bug/805264).

So Canonical, instead of adding potentially pointless features (e.g. shopping integration), and changing icons so the entire set doesn't look and feel consistent, why not bring **some actual polish** to the desktop instead?

Given that this fix has been released for almost 2 years, **[it's time to tell Canonical and the Compiz team that something needs to be done](https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz-core/+bug/827537)**.

Thoughts? Maybe we'll even have translucent window borders to stop desktop background clashing soon :)

I've pretty much done everything I can so far, save changing my operating system. To that end, I'm wondering if Ubuntu is the right choice to make. I can find my way around a computer well enough to be cognizant of these privacy issues and how to handle them, but I'm not in the least bit a programmer which is why Ubuntu's popularity and ease of use is attractive. At the same time, there seems to have been some controversy over commercial connections with Amazon, and I'm not filled with confidence by their privacy policy because it leaves plenty of room for complying with any demands from the NSA. It's difficult to navigate the different Linux OS's as a noob, so can anyone more experienced give me some advice?

TL;DR: what open-source OS would best suit someone trying to maximise both privacy and ease of use?

Edit: Thanks guys - you've all given quick and understandable answers to my question. I'm more confident about choosing Ubuntu now, and although I'm sure to meet some frustrations, I think the reduction in broad compatibility will be worth all the advantages (and while I'm no programmer now, I'm eager to learn, so it would be a great environment for it).

**Update2 :** The two questions were answered one way or the other. Apparently, a two-round MD5 hash with a sufficient salt is being used. I got what I wanted, and now I'll be waiting for Ubuntu's official public announcement about this. I hope we get answers and explanations on _why_ they were careless when it came to their users' protection, and _why_ they implement such a weak password storage scheme.

----------
Today I woke up to receive an email from Ubuntu Forums (forums@ubuntu.com) telling me that the site has been compramised. I went to the [Ubuntu Forums website](http://ubuntuforums.org/announce.html) and it seems that the news is true.

There are certain concerns about this attack, especially the possiblity of our passwords' exposure. Please don't go on telling me ""You should use distinct passwords"", I _do_ use distinct passwords for each site, but it's still recommended to use strong hashes.

So I'd like to start with my questions:

* Are the Ubuntu Forums using strong hashing schemes such as BCrypt or are they using one round of MD5/SHA1?
* Are the Ubuntu Forums using unqiue saltes?

^(Edit: To the downvoters. Come on guys, what the hell? This is not ""dissing"" Ubuntu, I'm a big Ubuntu fan and a 5-year user. I'm demanding explanations from a service after they had a compramise, and you just went ""Burn the witch!!"" on me.

Here's the story. I have a junker laptop that fried its hard drive, but I bought it used, no install disks. So, I buy a used hard drive ($25, because a new one would have exceeded the replacement cost of the computer), and moped home, worrying that a Linux install would leave me the way I usually deal with computer problems: swearing a lot and breaking things.

Instead, my SO burned me an install disk for Ubuntu on her Mac. I've never done anything like this before, figure the drivers will be a bitch, wireless will cause me headaches, the usual. But- screw it.

Instead- flawless install. No swearing. Very slick. I reboot, go onto the back porch, dink around with it. Still very nice. Took a little bit of toying with the wireless to get it to work, but the next thing I know, I'm on Reddit with Firefox, checking my email, playing Tetris. Back to wasting my life.

All I use that laptop for is writing (OpenOffice), surfing (Firefox, sometimes Chrome), and checking my email by web. And now it does all that, plus more. I'd switch my other systems, were it not for how I have files all over the place- and the other laptop runs nothing but my custom Access database.

I'm just very happy, and had to share. If it weren't for the Hirens boot CD and its miniature version of Linux that I used to try and fix the old hard drive, I probably never would have done this. This is so cool."	t5_2qh62	True

Despite its beautiful interface, unparalleled customisability and abundance of open source (and super useful) software, I still always felt like I was ""away from home"" so to speak; a bit out of my element. Then suddenly, like a sign from the gods of effective OS programming, today I realised that Ubuntu was here to stay:

I had spent all evening trying to get my Canon MX330 working with my Ubuntu installation and could only get the e-Fax portion of the system to be recognised. I had, unknowingly, en-queued page after page of test patterns in my fruitless endeavours to get my printer working and when I finally discovered the issue (embarrassingly simple) and got it working properly, I saw the little ""12"" over my printer icon on the top bar and panicked -- the Ubuntu printer test pages are insanely ink consuming. I opened the dialogue, expecting the usual click-spam battle with the interface I had become accustomed to with Windows but instead, every single print job was cancelled immediately and removed from the queue.

I am sick and tired of Rhythmbox sucking so much.  

First, how the hell is a bug like ""adjusting the volume crashes the program"" allowed to exist in ANY release of a music player, much less one that is allowed into a mainstream distro like Ubuntu.

Second, when I click on an mp3 file not already in the music database, and Rhythmbox is the default player, it can be assumed that I want the player to play the file.  I should not have to double click, watch Rhythmbox open, then double click again, because apparently the player thought I just wanted to see its beautiful gui.  This makes Rhythmbox a horrible player in conjunction with a program like gpodder, which sends its files to an external player to play.

These are basic functionalities and there is no excuse for it.  I fully understand that the player might not be perfect, but Ubuntu should move on if the project can't get its shit together.

I'm professional tech support guy, so I'm pretty familiar with all the new flavors of OSs (XP, 10.4 onwards). I've never had to USE Ubuntu... I would just SSH into one of my college's Linux machines to compile my coding assignments. My experience with the installation process, the initial customization, etc has been, in a word, GREAT!

tl;dr - Love Ubuntu, shamelessly jumping on the bandwagon, excited for the official release of 10.10.

Anyone have tips for a noob Ubuntu user? Or, hidden features that would make me squee?

EDIT: WOW! thanks for the feedback guys, i mucho appreciate it. also, sorry for the delay in acknowledging it, but I'm still new at the job and don't want anyone to catch me surfing reddit during company time... at least, not just yet. "	t5_2qh62	True

1343552696.0	xc4j5	Giving Ubuntu a shot on the desktop again as a Windows gamer - mixed thoughts		118	35	63	"I am a pretty avid PC gamer.  It is what I do with my spare time.  I don't watch T.V... I don't hang out (often)... I game.  I am also a UNIX/Linux sys admin with a good decade of experience.  I have usually viewed Windows as the dominant force on the desktop and *nix as dominant in the server world.  However, things have taken a different over the last few weeks.

My mid range gaming PC started to be plagued by a number of issues.  First, I had a few crashes within a couple nights that resulted in no video.  After replacing that, I had a power supply that went pop.  Since then, I have been plagued with random reboots, especially when playing games.

Software upgrades and hardware diagnostics availed me not.  Aside from one BSOD, Windows was not giving me any sort of indication... we are talking a total freeze.  I started to think about replacing hardware and realized my next step was probably a fell swoop of motherboard, CPU and memory if I couldn't nail things down further.

Earlier today, I decided to see what WINE would do for me on the latest Ubuntu.  So far, it has been an interesting ride.  I have not had one indication of any sort of hardware or system issue other than trying to get things working.  I am used to running dual monitors so I was surprised to find that one of my monitors supported a much higher resolution than it ever did under Windows.  However, I realized why that was after trying a few Steam games.  

I was getting nowhere... messages that lead nowhere until I tried Skyrim, which according to various resources, sounded like a game that should just work.  When the configuration utility came up with no resolutions listed, I realized something was up.  After disabling my second monitor and restarting X, I was able to choose my native resolution for my main monitor and...

START PLAYING!!!

That felt great.  The last time I tried to do anything serious on a Linux desktop, things were much more convoluted to get working when it came to GPUs and things were about 4 times more likely to be broken.

Overall, I see a gap that is really closing.  In spite of the Linux Desktop garnering much less industry interest than PCs (compared to consoles), the community has been able to make forward progress.  

Tomorrow, I will be continung my endeavors.  

Edit: It was a real bonus to see my Naga was working without any need for extra drivers... gives me real hope for my main addiction: WoW

Edit:  I was able to get Skyrim working and that was a blast.  Loaded my last saved game copied over from Windows... killed some wild life, noticed some slow performance.  Tried later... controls became non-responsive.  The Wow updater would mysteriously die... but overall, the system was stable.

This lead me to believe something may have been wrong with my windows install causing the crashes and lockups.  I decided to reinstall Windows but now I wanted to try an SSD.  I went out and got a 180GB one and started the install.  Windows locked up just as it tried to load the installer.  Hmm... let's try again... hmm... not even getting a POST from the BIOS now... but I do see blinky lights on my HDD access light and my optical drive.

At this point, it seems like the problem is with my old IDE devices that I have been refusing to upgrade.  Just unplugged their power and back up and running under my original install of Windows 7.  Finally got to make some progress in L.A. Noire (a game that just doesn't work under WINE from all reports and experience)."	t5_2qh62	True

1369182688.0	1esv7u	Ubuntu 13.04 is one of the buggiest linux distros I've ever used	JESSE_PINKMAN_BITCH_	135	52	105	"I've used linux on and off for many years, most of the time I always ended up back on ubuntu because it was usually the most polished and userfriendly.

I had high hopes for ubuntu 13.04, canonical claimed that they have made great strides when it came to automatited testing and such, so I was hoping that this would be a stable release with no huge bugs. I was very exited when 13.04 was released, because it looked like it would fix a lot of my problems with quantal, and even donated 50 dollars on the download page. Boy was I wrong.

1. Apparently just about a week before 13.04 was released a huge kernel update was released with many code changes. This causes a wide range of severe issues for many people, ranging from HDMI output just not working, to kernel panics on boot, to shutdown hangs. Its been a month and there still has not been a fix released (only just barely reached -proposed). If they had had any sense at all they would have rolled back this disastrous update before release. Just look at how many people are affected by this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1169984

2. Some very, very obvious visual bugs in unity that never should have made it out of a beta. Panel shadows showing over fullscreen video, libreoffice menu highlights that are totally glitched basically making them unusable to list a few.

3. The default instant messaging/ubuntu online accounts is a total mess. Trying to add a facebook account opens up firefox instead of the ubuntu SSO browser so I can't even add the facebook account. Adding a google account works but it CONSTANTLY stops working and asks for ""authorization"". Clicking the button next to the authorization message does nothing and I have to reboot to get the damn account to work.

4. Lots of issues with nautilus. Sometimes re-ordering bookmarks causes nautilus to crash, will often get random gvfs errors when mounting/unmounting network shares. When I bookmark network shares they randomly disappear from the sidebar until I kill nautilus and restart it, and when they dissappear I can't even manually navigate and mount it, it gives some random gvfs error and fails (and this one seems specific to ubuntu, I've never seen that problem with upstream nautilus 3.6.3 on other distros I've used)

And all these issues are known bugs that I experienced on a clean and updated install, on a fully ubuntu certified machine.

The worst thing is many of these problems have had ""fix committed"" for a very long time, but there is no released packages. There is a cubic crapload of bugs targeted for the unity 7.0.1 release and there's at least 40+ of them that are still unfixed, so it seems unlikely we will get updates for the already fixed bugs any time remotely soon since they are all targeted for one huge release.

I think there is something very, very wrong with ubuntu's QA process. Severe and obvious known bugs are left unfixed and the final is released anyway, so we end up having to wait ages for an SRU update. Perhaps ubuntu should be staying in beta for far longer so fixes can be pushed without going through a lengthy process, or perhaps the SRU process should be re-thunk.

I thought ubuntu was supposed to be the poster child for a user friendly and stable linux desktop? Canonical has lofty goals for ubuntu and I wish them the best, but the way things are going now they won't be able to attain them. You cannot release a product that is this buggy and expect it to have any chance of mainstream success. In its current state, ubuntu 13.04 should still be in early beta testing.

And before people say ""use the lts!"" I have used 12.04 and its no better, I have a whole set of different issues there, such as severe visual glitches with unity (such as really ugly white artifices on the indicators and panel) and very poor compiz performance."	t5_2qh62	True

1. Nvidia is already a Canonical partner and did also promote ""Logan"" as ""Kayla"" prototype running on Ubuntu when it was presented. [YT Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kIQWWJs_po)

2. Core features of Nvidias Tegra (since Tegra4) align with what the Edge is supposed to do. The software modem takes no space, 2 x LTE no problem.

3. Nvidias HDR technology is optimized for close personal shots, exactly what the Edge is supposed to do.

4. Nvidia claims to have/has always the fastest SoC, on top of that they support OpenGL 4.x with Logan, this is needed to use it as ""desktop"" device as well, and Cuda will make it attractive for desktop stuff too, something other SoC's can't do. In the video linked above Huang even promoted the same convergance vision.

5. tegra 4 is rarely adopted by the industry at this point, and also was delayed. So Tegra5 will be a sort of new start again for Nvidia, and the Edge basically the testbed for what can be done (remember Shuttleworths Formula 1 analogy)... and it's supposed to be available when the Ubuntu Edge is.

Also we will learn what is inside a computer and we'll probably break a few (not the one's pictured).

If there is any karma to be had from doing this, I am hoping that it comes from my local community.  I live in a small town with tough competition for few IT jobs. A ~~stunt~~ gesture like this should get me noticed, but I won't be deterred if I get nothing more than karma for doing this.  Its not really about me, its for the kids.

Wish me luck.  I expect I'll get swamped by families wanting a computer for their kids.  I'll probably limit it to 1 per household to be as fair as possible to all.

[Edit]  I fail at pictures.  Here's a [pic](http://imgur.com/hkoY9) of the computers.

I'm using Beta 2.2 on Lucid Lynx and it's probably the only thing about Ubuntu I don't like. It just feels like it's not being paid enough attention to, compared to the Windows version.

 The chat functionality is very poor. Offline messages are a mess - they only arrive when the user who sent them logs in, and sometimes they don't arrive at all, and their transferability to other instances of Skype on other OS's are poor. The emoticons are also static, so I have no idea what type of animation the Windows user I'm sending to is receiving. Notifications also don't work for me. Audio notifications of chat don't work and it's also hard to tell when someone has sent me a chat message.

What do you guys think of it?"	t5_2qh62	True
1305740597.0	hecv8	Finally gave up on Unity, installed KDE	wretcheddawn	121	37	126	"I *tried* to like Unity, I really did.  I upgraded the day 11.04 was released, and tried to deal with it's shortcomings and failures, but inevitably realized that it is neither stable nor as usable as my customized gnome config:

1.  It caused compiz to chew through RAM.  I've seen compiz use over 1500 MB (I have 2GB).
2.  When I'd wake the computer, the login screen wouldn't show up for 2-4 minutes. (probably due to #1)
3.  It crashed on me.  Gnome has NEVER crashed on me.
3.  Global menu infuriates me.  I have no idea what menu options are available, and don't associate them in my mind with the window because they are at a completely different screen location.  I tried to like it, but it wasn't possible.  Even OS X's is better because it shows the menu all the time.
4.  The window controls change position if the window is maximized.
5.  The window controls are on the wrong side.  This is partly preference, but aggravates me when I switch between windows and ubuntu.
6.  The Unity launcher takes too long to open when I want it, but also opens when I want to click something on the edge of the screen, and I end up opening programs by accident.
7.  Two panels are completely unnecessary.  This applies to GNOME 2.32 as well, but in gnome, I could easily consolidate them into one panel, and set it to auto-hide.  If your argument for moving the panel to the left edge of screen is to ""preserve usable screen space"", this makes no sense.
8.  It's hard to open programs that aren't in the launcher if I don't know what they are called.  I can right-click on the magnifying glass that doesn't zoom, and navigate the menus, but the only reason I figured that out is because I'm used to Windows 7.
9.  There's also the other magnifying glass that doesn't zoom, that is supposed to let me find documents but makes it difficult.  In the end I'd just click on the home folder icon and navigate to what I wanted because it was quicker.
10.  Dash takes up the whole screen to show very few options.
11.  The mechanics for rearranging the launcher are strange.
12.  Also, because I have to use Windows for work, and use Ubuntu at home, the pointless differences infuriated be when I'd switch between them.  Like the launcher on the left vs. bottom (even windows let's me customize this), close buttons on the left
91.  Switching to different windows in the same app is awkward.

Things I DID like about Unity:

1.  Shortcut keys, but Super+L should lock screen like windows.  All ""OS/WM/Shell"" shortcuts should be based off the super key IMHO.

So, I gave up and installed KDE.  So far it's much better than Unity, the interface out of the box is mostly what I want, it performs well, but it doesn't look quite as good.  It does seem to take longer to load even though I've swapped my gnome startup apps (gnome-do, guake) for KDE versions (yakuake).

What are your KDE tips?  Anyone else switch to KDE?"	t5_2qh62	True
1305081362.0	h8mjn	"""Wow, if Unity keeps going down this road it will be only good for my grandmother..."""	mnederlanden	125	44	123	"We say this like it would be a bad thing.

a. No configuration options means that my grandmother can't break anything anymore

b. I won't have to remember how windows works every time that my grandmother needs help

c. We are power users; we break software and put it back together for fun. When did we all turn into pussies who can't install software for ourselves anymore? Why do we care what comes preinstalled? 

d. Canonical has clearly been saying that it is not pulling the 200 million users goal from nowhere, but is talking with PC and tablet manufacturers who want an OS that has mass appeal... and judging from the industry, that means that the manufacturers either already have or will very soon have a hand in some of the organizational goals of Unity. 

e. Is it really so hard to believe that we aren't the target market for this distro? There are a ton of linux distros out there all aimed at power users, yet we installed the one distro that has clearly said that it's linux for ""human beings"" i.e. not people who are comfortable with computers. 

Having more users (especially the large corporations and OEM manufacturers that want to play ball with Ubuntu now that it has Unity as a Desktop) means more software being developed for Linux and Linux users won't have to have google develop a app so they can watch netflix. A linux distro aimed at our grandparents is the best thing that can happen to FOSS

f. Do we really believe that someone won't make a Unity-Tweak program to change everything that you want ubuntu to do... or a gnome 2 packet we can install after 11.10... or whatever missing option has gotten everyone's panties in a bunch. It's a 1.0 release guys, suck it up or go back to LTS until Unity becomes more mature, try Mint, or just log into Classic.

If you don't have the maturity to see that a Linux distro aimed at the computer illiterate is a good thing for FOSS, at least take your bitching somewhere else. There are some of us here that want to see Unity succeed, even if all your worst case scenarios is true and it becomes something we, the power users, won't use."	t5_2qh62	True

Izick	98	26	92	"So, I really love Ubuntu, but recently I've been thinking about going back to Windows. My main and only reason really is that Flash is such utter shit on Ubuntu. If I go into HD in the regular window, or full-screen at any resolution, then the video stutters and chops to such a degree that the picture is basically worthless, while the audio stays fine.

I'm willing to try anything, but I've already tried a bunch of stuff. I have the latest Flash version, I have a few add-ons in Firefox like Flash-Aid, and I even tried to see how Chrome's flash worked, and they all have the same problems for me.

With that being said, I'm still willing to listen. I have a pretty weak **Toshiba Satellite L455D-55976 with AMD Sempron SI-42**. The reason I tell you this is that I've been told that the fact that I use the drivers that came with Ubuntu may be part of the problem. Thing is, whenever I use the additional drivers tool, I can never successfully download FLGRX (Post-Release Updates) but I can download the regular FLRGX. The problem here is that FLRGX, or at least the one without post-release updates, completely slows my system down, and the performance is about as half as good as the regular driver, even if that.

So like I said, I'm willing to try anything. I really love watching videos, and its really a shame that I'd have to give up on this wonderful OS just because of it. I appreciate any advice."	t5_2qh62	True

6 months ago I upgraded to 12.10 because there was a clear message and vision at the time. That was: getting rid Unity 2D (basically Unity built in QT), migrating all internals to Python 3, and ""it means we have one codebase going forward."" - I could get on board that line of thinking.

Now the news is Mir, then build Unity to run on that (basically Unity built in QT) and an earnest talk about changing the release cycle...

So, the opposite of the previous message?

My question: What is 13.04 about? If there was a vision what is it? The last of the Compiz releases? The end of an era? It's not clear to me what  is going on...

 If I hit the super key, start typing, and hit enter I expect my goddamn program to launch. Instead the dash just goes HURRRRR, did you want to type something? I'm sorry I wasn't ready.

In gnome-shell I can do this, as well as with other launchers like gnome-do, synapse, kupfer ect...

I really hope performance is a big focus on 12.04, I could see myself liking unity quite a bit, but because of unity's poor performance I much prefer gnome-shell atm.

Remember when Shuttleworth said he wanted Ubuntu to reach 200 million users when 15.04 arrives, back in 2011?
Well it's been around two years and while those kind of statistics are hard to measure, the Ubuntu user base sure haven't increased tenfold yet. 

But it seems to me that there still is some hope for Ubuntu to succeed in getting a wider user base.

According to [this](http://blog.projectz.me/2013/03/03/theres-something-ubuntu-needs-to-do-if-the-phone-is-going-to-work/) article at projectz.me it seems that Ubuntu needs to expand where the rest of ""them"" are weakest - the mobile market in the business world.

**What I got from the article**:


The situation in the business world is as follows: It's not as heavily occupied by iOS and Android as it looks. According to the article both iOS  and Android have poor management and their updates are causing more problems than they fix (for business users). As it is right now, both Android and iOS are targeting the consumer market and because of that, they're in a game where new features and updates are what's keeping them in the game. This leaves them with an Achilles' heel. Businesses don't really care for flashy interfaces, X megapixel cameras and Facebook integration in the business world. What matters is management and security, and security breaches in Android (according to the article) doesn't help with the reliability on the Android front. 

*Enter Ubuntu Phone.*

Ubuntu Phone might just provide what these businesses, I personally hope do exist, need. I mean Ubuntu Phone is going to be a truly portable, full fledged computer. It's got security built right in since it's Ubuntu. And it's easily manageable from an IT department, because of Ubuntu Server, Landscape and Cloud. And it's dependable because of the Long Term Support stuff.

Those are going to be the main selling points for businesses. The reason they should choose Ubuntu over, say iOS is because it comes with the advantages that iOS and Android can't provide plus it doesn't come with the disadvantages that Android and iOS come with. 

**TL;DR**:
iOS and Android are consumer operating systems that aren't suited for the business world. 
Ubuntu Phone actually is. 


**So, if Ubuntu is a business platform. What's gonna happen to those who like it, but aren't businessmen?**

^This ^is ^actually ^where ^I'm ^gonna ^need ^correction ^if ^since ^I'm ^not ^so ^sure ^about ^the ^LTS ^side ^of ^Ubuntu. 

What I understand is this: 
Ubuntu is basically running two release cycles at the time. 
A release ever six months and another (LTS) every two years. 

Now, from what I get, this release cycle is pretty crucial in spreading Ubuntu from the offices to the family desks too.
Kids, Teens, geeks and moms and dads do care for awesome features and Facebooks integration. 

How is Ubuntu ever going compete on that market if Ubuntu isn't supposed to put out too many new feature updates? And then expand to the desktop too?

It's easy: 
Divide development into two categories:
LTS for the business side 
Short term releases for cool stuff that appeals to the general user.

What do you guys think? Can Ubuntu cater to both business and general users if they get a foothold in the business first?

Not because I feel I am at risk or anything (because honestly, if I didn't want to be tracked, I would just switch DMs), but because I feel Ubuntu has strayed from their philosophies I loved so much three years ago. 

Here's the dilemma: Stallman says to ""remove Ubuntu from the distros you recommend or redistribute"", but I really don't have anything I can confidently recommend. I know many people would say ""Linux Mint"", but I have some annoyances on their philosophy too. To me, Linux Mint stands for staying the same. When Ubuntu made the bold decision to universalize their UI by doing Unity, Linux Mint took advantage of this by...staying the same. They appeal the the crowd who want something familiar, and that's fine, but do we really want the distro representing linux to the the one that bases itself on stagnancy? This isn't meant to be a Mint bashing, but I think it's important that we realize the significance of what distro we start recommending. If we have a distro that isn't bold enough to incorporate big changes, linux isn't going anywhere quickly. 

Other than Mint, there aren't really (to me) any other distros that have a unique identity, are user friendly and are powerful (Fedora is too much for most people to get started with). So for the moment, there isn't really anything I can recommend besides Ubuntu. 

I hope to spark a debate. Tell me what distro you're going to start recommending. 

**by the way, I just want to make it clear that I'm not bashing Ubuntu or Mint, just stating my opinions. (I love Ubuntu and Unity)**

tl;dr We should be careful in recommending a linux distro that got its popularity by staying the same. "	t5_2qh62	True

NewspaperNelson	98	23	18	"Don't get me wrong, it still runs a little jerky and doesn't take much to eat up all the memory resources, but Ubuntu 12.04 with the XFCE desktop has made this 10-year-old jalopy usable again (though I am frustrated with the options for a simple volume control icon in XFCE). What I am most happy about is that this machine will run like this forever, whereas a Windows-driven machine would of course get slower and slower over time, as the armies of Windows-destroying bugs and malware slowly ate it to death.

This was a dust-gathering machine my daughter disregarded after getting a new laptop. I have a laptop, my wife has a laptop, we're lousy with laptops - and I just wanted an old fashioned desktop again.

I have been using Ubuntu now for a few years, and she has been occasionally using my rig for things (when the kids were on her computer for example).

I have a fear, however.  I am afraid that I have become so used to how things work on Ubuntu that I am forgetting how much of a shock it might be for her to switch. Therefore I am asking for some ideas.

What changes can I make to the interface/use of Ubuntu that will ease her transition into it? For example, reviewing how to one finds a program and installs it would be important....

Maybe some suggestions on Gnome/Unity/XFCE or whatever would be nice...

Thank you


**EDIT**: Thank you so much for all of the replies everyone.  To answer the ""Wait until 12.04"" comment; I wanted to.  I even told her about the differences between LTS and other versions.  However, she is out of town now and she spent the time to move all of her important work to the server before leaving. On her way out the door she commanded I fix her OS, and like hell am I just re-installing windows again. This chance is too golden, she can roll with the 12.04 update when it comes in a few weeks.

**EDIT 2** Install is done.  Currently I have Unity set, however I tweaked it so that the bar never hides, smaller icons, better transparency and so forth.  Set up the printer (through our windows home server), and also have added Minecraft (because that's a requirement in this house, damn it). Also, I added an install of windows in VirtualBox and didn't tell her.  I want her to not know the crutch is there, and if the need arises we will venture into that realm.  Mostly I think it will be used for Spotify (so that there doesn't have  to be a monthly fee, which is required on the Linux beta).

The hardest part was getting it to play nicely both locally and externally.  I use [No-Ip](http://www.no-ip.com) for Dynamic DNS.

Custom Ports, and used the following guides for some nice security (on top of others, found for each indivdual need (FTP, SSH, Samba, ports/IP tables):

I used Ubuntu on and off starting with 7.04, but (despite what others believe) the stability, performance, appearance, and features that came with Unity won me over. The only thing that I wish Ubuntu had was Google integration. Being a college student who works 3 jobs, my life is in the cloud so I can access it on any of my computers. I don't use thunderbird, evolution, or any desktop calendar application, I use Gmail and Google Calendar. 

My question to you is: is there any way where I can get good notifications through the Ubuntu messaging system and can edit my calendar on the ubuntu desktop? I want it so that when I have a new email, I get a notification about it via the default notification system and it makes my envelope turn blue. I also want to be able to view my calendar through the calendar menu and be able to add and remove tasks, then have it sync to my Google Calendar. 

I'm the best with Linux and computers, but I do consider myself above average. I am somewhat familiar with the terminal, but I usually need a step by step walkthrough or close support from a friend. If anyone has suggestions, please help!

1346566769.0	z7yoq	Long Time Windows User New to Ubuntu: How can I best support the Ubuntu community?	Thaufas	82	17	27	"I'm posting this update from my netbook, which was previously running Windows Vista, but is now running Ubuntu 12.04! Except for one minor problem, installation of Ubuntu was trivial. Intially, I was having trouble with the video, but a quick Google search revealed the problem to be specific to my computer model + video card combination.

Once I installed the updated video driver, it worked great. I still can't get over what a great OS Ubuntu Linux is. The UI is just as pleasing as Windows or Mac OS.

I installed Ubuntu for about 4 years on my desktop server, but only in virtual mode, with Windows 7 as the host OS. In that case, I didn't use it much.  Rather, I was just curious what all the fuss was about.  This instance on my netbook is the first time I've actually run Ubuntu as a host OS. I installed it because of my frustration with Vista.

Despite running Avast, Vista still contracted a virus. Kaspersky removed the virus, but then the OS became unusable. Even with a fresh install, Vista ran like a turtle on this netbook but Ubuntu feels so much faster (at least so far-hopefully, it won't slow down the way Windows machines inevitably do over time).

The Ubuntu installer is so well crafted. My netbook doesn't have an optical drive, but it does have USB ports and one MMC port. I used the latter for the install, and it worked great. The Ubuntu installer even noticed that I had a Vista installation, and it gave me the option to overwrite it or install along side it, reconfiguring partitions on the fly, which is what I did.

I was really impressed that Ubuntu gave me the option to automatically download updates during the installation. Windows doesn't do that! Also, with the exception of the graphics card, Ubuntu found working drivers for all my hardware (e.g. keyboard, touchpad, camera, bluetooth, USB, etc).

That's simply amazing, especially considering that I installed the 64 bit version of Ubuntu. When I installed Win 7 x64 on the same netbook a few years back, I had to find all of the 64 bit drivers myself.

If I can get Vista operational, I could dual boot. But since I can still access all of my files and Ubuntu runs so much faster--and is probably much less likely to get a virus--I don't see the point of making Vista operational.

I'm still amazed that Ubuntu is ""free.""  If my positive experience continues after a few weeks, I'll definitely make a donation to the Ubuntu team. I wish I'd installed Ubuntu sooner!

The machine runs faster, cooler and quieter than OS X, which amazes me because I've always thought that Windows and Linux distros all make Macs way hotter than on OS X. The battery life, ironically, is longer - now I can squeeze out an hour more from my battery comparing to what I previously had on Lion.

However there are some quirks such as I miss my OS X Dictionary.app with lookup gesture system-wide, iSight needs to be fixed manually, the touchpad becomes very jittery and I can't pair Magic Trackpad with Xubuntu (now I'm using a USB wireless mouse), but they are not deal breakers anyway. Overall I'm happy with my new setup :)"	t5_2qh62	True

But it's obvious that we have to keep talking about it. Not because every man in this community is treating women badly. Not even because most of them do.

But because we all, men and women, allow the too big minority of sexist men in our ""community"" to keep harassing the too small minority of women. Such a group, people allowing this to happen, will not be considered a community by those being harassed, and should not be seen as such by anyone else until we get our act together and stand up for the right of anyone in it to be themselves.

**[This is the story that made me write this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/lr1tl), and where the title quote comes from. I'll recount parts of it briefly below, but please go and read the whole thing!**

Skud is an important female voice in FOSS. Quite literally as a public speaker at conferences, but also as the founder of the Geek Feminism blog and wiki. She was going to speak at the Google I/O conference in March, but when she heard that it would be recorded and put online she had a panic attack and turned down this conference, which is a huge deal.

Why get a panic attack from that? If you're in technology you should only expect that what you do gets posted online. Sounds like a weak women, right? Well, you might feel differently if you'd been harassed and bullied so much after talks that you get physically ill and need to take time off from work. If you'd had to endure hundreds of comments and websites created for the sole purpose of mocking and belittling you, and if you had to explain to your boss why someone might call to say that you are distributing child porn.

All of this has happened to Skud and so many other women who have dared to be visible in technology and Free Software. And because of this she and many others like her have quit the tech business or stepped out of the FOSS community. One of the really bad incidents for Skud was after a speech at the Open Source Convention.

This is a tragedy and a shame. We have to start taking seriously that harassment like this is creating huge problems, first and foremost for the women themselves, but also for the community and for the goals of FOSS. And we need to realise that even though no one is stopping these women from speaking out in the classical sense, these kinds of attacks are effectively censorship as good as any other.

Even among the majority of men and women who do not harass we need to be more aware. Of course we need to be active in denouncing harassment and always speak up when someone talks and behaves unacceptably [at conferences](http://geekfeminism.org/2011/10/19/wednesday-geek-woman-unnamed-complainant-at-javaone/), in comments, or anywhere.

But we also need to be more aware of our own ingrain, unconscious attitudes and behaviour. We are a part of a male dominated group, so we don't naturally see things from any other perspective. Of course we don't, unless we make an effort to be conscious about it. Things we don't think about at all might for women feel like a barrier to being as integrated a part of the community as the men. As just one example the [choice of t-shirts at conferences](http://geekfeminism.org/2011/10/18/t-shirts-yet-again/) might make women feel less welcome.

There are tons of ""passive"" things like this that we need to start taking seriously. And there's tons of active things we need to start doing to get a more diverse and Open community where anyone and everyone have the Freedom to contribute, no matter what parameters they where born with.

For help with identifying both passive and active things you should be aware of and do, please have a look at the [Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/)!

**Edit:** Hi guys and galls :)

Thank you all for your enthusiasm around this topic! I just wanted to make a few things clear:

* Yes, I link to an article by Skud, and talk about her experiences here. But it is very important to note that this is not just a problem she is facing, but a big problem in tech and FOSS. The Geek Feminism Wiki has [gathered a list of well known incidents](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Incidents), but this is only some of the big things. *The cumulative effect of the small, almost invisible things; everyday teasing/low level harassment, focus on looks, etc, is just as important. This is a widespread problem, and what has happened to Skud over the years is just one example I chose to focus on.*

* No, this is related to Ubuntu! Really. Why? Not because one person harassing Skud mentioned Ubuntu, but because this is a problem in the Free Software movement, and Ubuntu is a big part of that movement. You might not agree with me that it is such a widespread problem, but it is a big problem for those affected by it and so we must talk about it and do something about it. *Note that I'm not saying this is a bigger problem in the Ubuntu community than in any other part of FOSS, or even tech. Ubuntu even has some great [community guidelines](http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/conduct) for dealing with this. But it's still a problem here, so we need to talk about it.* Just like I might say to one organization within (i.e.) the environmental movement that they need to be aware of a specific issue (i.e. the disproportionally few black people in environmental groups), even though that issue might not be a bigger problem in that specific organization than in the movement/community as a whole. I just might feel closer connected to that organization. But I do want to crosspost this in r/opensource etc. too.

* English is not my mother tongue, so I'm sorry for my long winded ways of saying things I'm sure could've been stated much more concisely, and for all typos and such. I hope you will see past that and try to focus on what I have to say instead of how I do it.

* Thank you all again. :)

**Edit 2**: Just two more points I want to address:

**""If you're public/get notoriety/active online you will be harassed, no matter who you are. This is not unique for women""** - Yes, of course harassment is a problem for all kinds of people and groups, not just women. It is not acceptable no matter who it is targeted at, and we need to fight against all of it. What I am arguing is that the threshold for getting harassed because of sticking your neck out in tech and FLOSS is much lower for women than for any other group in our community, and that we can't tolerate that. *We can't tolerate any harassment of any group, of course, but it very much seems like women are disproportionately affected and so that's the group I wanted to focus on now.*

If we plot online activity/fame and level of harassment on a scale from 1-100, then it seems to me that for a women to reach the same level of harassment as a man, she only needs to climb a lot lower on the activity/fame scale than a man (i.e. the man is at level 60 on activity before reaching level 30 on harassment, while a women only needs to be at level 30-40 to reach the same amount of harassment. This is of course only an illustration. I don't know if the scale is correct here). This is of course only in general, not true in every single incident (i.e. there might be many men getting harassed more at a lower level of activity than many women at a higher level, and the other way around, without that invalidating the argument that in general women is affected worse, sooner)

**""There's nothing we can do about this (short of inflicting censorship/horribly invasive surveillance)""** - Sorry, but this is just plain wrong. Societal norms changes all the time, and it's changed for the better throughout history. Not that long ago it was ok to stare, to say rude things, to behave terribly towards people straight to their face if they where ""different"" (skin colour, mental issues, physical disabilities, etc.). Children could stand and point and laugh while their parents watched. This is mostly not the case any more. Some people still insist on calling dark skinned people ""nigger"", but those are mainly a  minority and not much respected. It's the same online. Some online communities are mostly friendly and helpful (see e.g. Caterina Fake [talking about Flickr as a big party](http://netmagazine.com/interviews/in-depth/caterina-fake)), while others are mostly hateful and spiteful (or has too much of this).

*So clearly there are things that can be done to change the direction one way or the other. What are those things, and should we try doing some of them? I'm not trying to say that we should go after any individual, but that the community must be more aware of, and make clear trough our actions, inactions and words, what kind of community we want (open, inclusive, free, etc.). And what kind we don't want.*

Most of the ""rules"" behind the way we behave and talk are internalized, that is it's so natural to us that we don't think about them at all. The rules we have, or the lack of some rules, might lead to us doing/saying things that feels like rejections/unwelcoming to some groups, without us realizing at all. Other things we might realize could be taken in a bad way, but because we don't feel the weight of all the unintentional and intentional acts of harassment that the members of the group do all the time, we don't think it's that bad (because it's not by itself, but nothing is only by itself).

If what I wrote can inspire some people to think the slightest about these kinds of things, or even better: internalize it, in their everyday life and behaviour, then I'm happy."	t5_2qh62	True
