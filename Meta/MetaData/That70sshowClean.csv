ItLivesInsideMe	139	12	24	"After doing some extensive research on territorial exchanges during the Colonial Era!, I found that the US Virgin Islands were once Dutch, this coincides with  ( In ""Ramble on,"" during a job interview at the Fatso Burger and at the DMV, Fez claims he can speak Dutch). The east Virgin Islands were always British Virgin Islands this explains ( Hyde finally asks them, ""Where the hell are you guys from?"", his friend says that the name depends on whether you ask the British or the Dutch. But the British won't say it, Fez explains, because they hate the island, and no one understands a word the Dutch say). As for Fez quoting ""We won the war buddy, get over it!) Could be seen as reference to Napoleonic Wars, where the Dutch were the main Allies of the French when they went against the British. Fez also speaks Spanish which could be explained by the Virgin Islands Proximity to Puerto Rico.  "	t5_2sooy	True

This was funny, because Alyson Hannigan has guest starred on '70s show  before. http://imgur.com/bk06C

And just recently, if anybody remembers Mitch, he tried to fight Eric and then backed down, (http://imgur.com/ZCYa6) guest starred on How I Met Your Mother too. http://imgur.com/RaUMk

Kind of cool huh?

1339938738.0	v6dkh	My theory about Randy	Awesometoast	36	3	6	In season 8, we were greeted with a new character that a lot of people did not enjoy. I have a theory on why that is. You see, Randy's character was made as a last ditch attempt at replacing Eric, and because of the small space for character development in the final season, they couldn't properly 'make' him. Looking back, we didn't really know much about his background, his flaws, and traits. To us he was rather plain. Another factor that think that negatively affected him was the lack of flaws. The gang always poke fun at each other for their different flaws and personal traits, e.g. Hyde being a conspiracy maniac, Jackie big a big mouth, but this was not there for Randy! I guess they mocked his hair for a bit, but there's not much to him to make him a dynamic, 3 Dimensional character. Sorry for the long block of text.

1361857660.0	198t9x	This Show Just moved me so much that I burst into tears! Felt like sharing.	new2thisredditthing	25	2	2	"So I was sitting at home having my midnight snack and treating myself to  some /r/trees and got myself to my first real [10]. At this point in my life I am deeply in love with my SO after only a short period of time and I am finding Eric extremely relate able. I have just watched the last few episodes of season 3 and the first couple of season 4. Now I am warning you now there are going to be some spoilers so please decide for yourself if you want to continue.


So as you know this is around when Eric and Donna break up. Eric is so crushed by the loss of Donna so much that he gives up on life, and after much persistence from Kitty, Red decides that it is up to him to try and help Eric. 
   Now at this point I should say that one thing I did envy was the relationship that Eric and Red had because my relationship with my father is terrible. And I secretly wish it were much better.
   So Red buys him a beer and tells him the story of his first real heartbreak. And then The waterworks started I was sobbing like a little baby, and I have never watched any other movie or television show that had any effect anywhere near there. 

Thanks for reading and putting up with my grammar, spelling and punctuation, I'm still pretty toasted. :) "	t5_2sooy	True

In S01E10, ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"", Red's mother spends the day with the family. Hilarity ensues, of course, but near the end of the episode, Kitty goes downstairs and asks the gang for a cigarette. 

We can't see who gives it to her, and this is what stumps me. I've watched over and over to try and figure it out, based on the sleeves. It honestly looks like some random extra was brought in, because the shirt color doesn't match anyone else's.

Have I missed something? Are we supposed to be able to figure out which person gave her the cigarette, or is it vague on purpose? Thoughts?"	t5_2sooy	True

1375990909.0	1jz64o	[Fan theory] Laurie Dormant is literally The Devil	DremoraTed	15	2	8	"Posted this on the fantheories subreddit but it was deleted. Figured it would go over better here.

We know that Eric and a few others jokingly say that she's evil throughout the series, but the facts show that she is, in fact, the Lord of Darkness.  

Fact: She was born with a tail.

Fact: in ""Red Gets A Job"" she has Kelso look into her eyes to see images of Satan.

Fact: Eric mentions a neighborhood child who was abducted for use in ""one of Laurie's black masses.""

Fact: Eric and Donna seem genuinely surprised that she shows emotion and concern for someone other than herself.

Fact: St Peter seems to know Laurie in Kitty's daydream in episode ""Holy Crap"" and seems tempted by her. She then flashes an evil/mischievous grin. 

Fact: She changes her appearance after season 5 and no one notices.

Fact:  In ""Holy Crap"" she tries to tempt a holy man, Pastor Dave into her bed. We know that Satan loved to mess with the clergy by tempting them with forbidden items or actions.

Fact: In ""Holy Crap"" while playing Religious Rummy with Pastor Dave, she plays 666.

It's between Kelso and Hyde, I don't remember if anybody else was there.  A circle might have been involved.  Kelso says something like ""Wouldn't it be cool if they took two wheels and put a seat on it, so you could sit?"" and Hyde tells him that's a bike.  Then Kelso keeps adding stuff to make a new thing, Hyde telling him what already-existing invention it is each time, eventually circling back around to bikes.  I know I didn't just make that scene up.  If anyone on this subreddit can remember what I'm thinking of and at least give me an episode citation for that scene I'd be grateful.

1339619758.0	v0f5p	DAE think Season 8 isn't as bad as everyone says?	wetpedals	17	5	17	"First, the biggest problem everyone seems to have with it: **Randy**. I honestly didn't find him to be that bad. Sure, they gave him some crappy jokes, but he generally seems to be a good guy just trying to fit in with some new people. I liked seeing Donna branch out and try someone new, instead of just Eric Eric Eric. I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels like that relationship got tiresome after a while.

Next, the absence of **Eric**. Now let me just say he's not my favorite character on the show to begin with, but most of the seasons he's okay. But coming from Season 7, I really didn't miss him. I feel like he turned into a huge douche, all season long. I also don't feel like his character really does change much, through the entire series.

**Kelso**, on the other hand, I definitely missed. I never get tired of his antics. He did some growing up but was still leading a fun life. 

Overall though, I felt like it was refreshing to focus on the other characters a bit more. I liked the developments between Fez and Jackie, and in my opinion them getting together was long overdue. Plus, they both grew up a lot. I also liked seeing more of Hyde. His stripper wife got annoying eventually, but she left. And his Dad is always a riot.

**What do you guys think?**

**TL;DR:** Randy isn't that bad, I didn't miss Eric, focusing on the other characters was a good thing.

*I'm hoping we can get some more conversation going in this subreddit, I love verticals as much as the next person, but a lot of stuff happened in this show we can talk about!*

Edit: I just wanted to add [this screencap](http://i.imgur.com/qXVet.jpg) from the finale. The circle, having just been used for the last time. :')
