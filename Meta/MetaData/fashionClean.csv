**Ken Watanabe**

[Champagne-gray suit](http://www.flixster.com/photos/ken-watanabe-inception-ken-watanabe-13613236) - I loved the champagne-gray color, the peaked lapel, matching vest, white shirt, and champagne/brass colored tie. 

his other [gray suit](http://www.flixster.com/photos/ken-watanabe-inception-ken-watanabe-12665519)- As an Asian I aspire to dress like this someday. :)

Also, damn can he rock the [gi](http://www.flixster.com/photos/marion-cotillard-inception-mal-cobb-13667837).

**Joseph Gordon-Levitt**

Joseph Gordon's [suit](http://themoviemash.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/inception-ellen-page_Joseph-Gordon-Levitt.jpg) - This was worn at the hotel at the second level dreamstate, but I liked it even better when the jacket was [off](http://moviecultists.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/inception-screencap-13-hallway-fight-joseph-gordon-levitt-575x238.jpg). It's hard to tell in both pictures, but the blue stripes on the shirt was what caught my eye. Edit: Just to clarify this was my favorite.

[leather jacket and boots](http://www.flixster.com/photos/joseph-gordon-levitt-inception-inception-12113266) - I'm not a big fan of leather jackets/boots, but this was bad ass. I'm sure Nolan didn't want him to always sport the ""pretty boy"" look and this outfit did the trick. Well, the FN SCAR-L rifle helped out, too.

[another suit](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inception/pictures/50.php#highlighted_picture) - I love gray suits, but it's the blue stripes and machiato colored shoes that did it for me. Joseph Gordon-Levitt must be every slim-fit designer's dream.

**Dileep Rao**

Not every character should wear the slim-fit suit, and a blackmarket chemist is a good example. His wardrobe may have lacked in the elegance department, but definitely not in style. I can't find any good pictures though.

**Tom Hardy**

I can't find any good pictures of him either, but when it came to a sports jacket/suit with the unbuttoned collar, he was the best out of all of them.

**Ellen Page**

I'm a guy and I'm not very good at forming opinions on Women's fashion, but I liked how 'low key' her wardrobe was. Yea, she did pull off quite a bit of [layers](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inception/pictures/28.php#highlighted_picture) at times, but the colors were so wonderfully subtle. She was good at projecting the 'intelligent and classy college girl.'

Also, I don't know what to say other than I thought it was interesting when she was in the [suit/skirt with the Japanese hair bun](http://socialitelife.celebuzz.com/bfm_gallery/2009/10/leonardo_dicaprio_and_ellen_page_film_whip_it/gallery_main/gallery_main-leonardo-dicaprio-ellen-page-deception-set-10052009-07.jpg).

Oh yeah, **Leonardo DiCaprio** [dressed to kill](http://www.flixster.com/photos/leonardo-dicaprio-inception-leonardo-dicaprio-13613231)... and it's a [one-button](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inception/pictures/52.php#highlighted_picture) suit. Nice.

I don't really care who it's by, I'm not buying this shit just because it has a Missoni label. To be cleared off of shelves in one day at Target is just absurd to me. Missoni pulled off a huge troll on this one by making girls who can't afford the real stuff think they look great in something not even my grandma would wear. I can't possibly be alone in this.

""On the Style menu today: transforming your old heels into SUPER heels. Ok… not really. But your new pumps will include some superheroes straight from your favourite comic books.

[Pic 1](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyc7xrvilR1r3umio.jpg)

Aside from choosing a superhero and comics, you’ll also need Mod Podge, an Exacto knife, a flat bristle paint brush and a pair of heels.

[Pic 2](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyc8bg6ZtR1r3umio.jpg)

This DIY fashion project is really easy to do. It’ll just require some patience, leaving you with an awesome new pair of heels= BONUS.
How you want to piece together your design is completely up to you, so choose a superhero you like and just have fun with it.

First thing’s first: cut your comic book into strips and work from the top edge to the bottom of your heel. This way, your entire shoe is sure to be covered and you won’t have any unwanted pieces peeking out.

[Pic 3](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyc7ygRshT1r3umio.jpg)

Then, fill in the rest of the spaces with characters or words. It’ll look best if you layer on top of your comic book strip-panel.

[Pic 4](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyc7zcsQe01r3umio.jpg)

Once your heels are completely covered, apply a layer of Mod Podge over the entire shoe to make sure everything stays in place. Let it dry for about an hour.

[Pic 5](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyc8anitlD1r3umio.jpg)

Lastly, gently sand your heels with a nail buffer to remove any brush strokes or bumps. I suggest you apply another two to three layers of Mod Podge for extra protection.

[Pic 6](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyc80l17Bs1r3umio.jpg)

Wait 48 hours before wearing your new pumps just to make sure everything stays in place and the paper doesn’t crinkle.

EDIT from my comment below:*I was wrong to judge those in the picture, but it was just my initial reaction* It just makes me sad that a pair of shoes could cost the same amount as it would to feed a man for months. It makes me even more sad that I am not immune to this kind of spending, because I am also affected by thrills of fashion and being ""on trend"".
The people in the picture are not really what should have angered me, but really how society is constructed, and also a direct reflection into *my own values* which are superficial and, to be honest, disgust me.

Would you like to reduce waste &amp; recycle in the most glam way possible?**

There is a new way of updating your wardrobe without it costing you or the environment. Clothes-swapping is the latest money-saving trend among budget- and fashion-conscious 'recessionistas'. And with vintage-chic the look of the moment, there's never been a better time to get second-hand swapping..

**Green facts**

Do you know...

That you wear 20% of your wardrobe 80% of the time.

Americans throw away more than 68 pounds of clothing and textiles per person per year.

On average, 80% of textiles thrown away still have 75% of their wearability left.

**As they say, one womans trash is another's treasure! Have fun! If you have any ideas that might make the swap better, bigger, or more fun – share them.**

I have found my wedding dress. In a local vintage store, I found a 2007 Alexander McQueen floor length sheath with cap sleeves. It's my size and looks divine. It is everything I want. The price tag is big, $2,000. However, this is in my current budget and would be a reasonable budget for any future wedding.

The dress was designed while the man himself ran the house and sold for $7,500 originally. It is a masterpiece work of art. I'm a fashion writer so I take this thing pretty seriously and if I had to concentrate any funds on a specific part of a future wedding, the dress would win above all else.

The problem is that I'm not even close to being engaged! I've been with my bf for 4 years but there's no plan on the horizon to tie the knot. He, of course, thinks it's crazy to buy a $2K dress at this point. My mother jokingly has said that I could used that $2k and buy 3 pairs of shoes with it instead.
I've heard that once you find your dress get it, and it's vintage McQueen in a boutique in my city so it's kind of time sensitive.
Would it be crazy to buy this dress? I wish I could find a pic, but I can't seem to find the exact one.

NB! I've inherited my future engagement ring from my great-grandmother, meaning the other major expense related to an engagement is not applicable."	t5_2qhoq	True

I hear people say they buy Coach or similar brands as an investment, but these people also buy a new one every year or so.  That's not an investment to me!

My question is, if I spent the money to get a Coach (or similar) brand purse, could it last 5-10 years?  That would actually be worth it to me, but I don't know of anyone who has done such a thing to ask!

Please share your experiences!

1291671265.0	eh8w4	Hi Reddit, I just relaunched the Spaser Corporation. I make rad sunglasses. No sells since relaunch though.		45	11	78	"I feel like these ""help my new struggling business"" threads are pretty cliche, but I'm confident my product is cool and that I just need some more publicity to get going. I got facebook groups and friends in real life, but I've reached over saturation in my own city. Maybe you can help me out. Would be sweet to kick off right before Christmas. Also just switched from Paypal to Google Checkout because of the Wikileaks thing. Also let me know what you think of the designs and stuff!

[Spaser Corporation](http://spasercorp.com)

FYI: thomasthomas, skipharrison, and skitch all rule.

EDIT: Just added a 25% off total order, code: hireddit. Ends sunday.

EDIT: Four sales tied to reddit! Cool. Your monies go toward me making more cool things, these glasses aren't the only thing I have up my sleeve. Also I'm trying to figure out how to add international ordering to google checkout. It's tricky."	t5_2qhoq	True

The thing is I see so many cute heels I would love to wear but worry I would just look freakishly tall. I'm curious what others think about tall girls wearing heels? A fashion faux pas? Depends on the person? Rock the heels no matter the height?

LauraFinn	44	21	29	"Title kind of says it all, but I host a program on an educational talk radio station in the Middle East devoted to everything fashion related. I had reserved 15-20 minutes to chat with someone, but they cancelled. The show is live on Saturday evening, September 29th. I've sent out a bunch of emails to people and called around, but since it's such short notice I think I'm in big trouble.

Anyone here work in the fashion industry and want to be on the radio?! It can really be anything: Shoes, makeup, clothes, accessories, hair, photography, you name it. Would take about 20 minutes and we can pre-record it so you don't have to worry about being nervous on live radio.

1293740153.0	ett49	People think I'm a boy....	notaboy	29	2	66	"Hi everyone. Not sure if this is the right place for this, so please set me straight in the comments if you think there's a better subreddit or something.

I'm a 26 yo female and people often mistake me for a guy. I was a tomboy growing up and when I started getting serious about martial arts (about 12 years ago), I cut my hair short. I don't wear makeup, don't have my ears pierced, and I mostly just wear jeans and t-shirts.

It gets worse in the winter time when I wear my winter coat and people can't see my boobs. My boyfriend is cool about it (he says he doesn't think I look like a guy - I'm actually very petite and have a round face but it's like people don't look past my haircut), but it embarrasses me. And I think people might think he's a pedophile sometimes (kind of a joke, kind of not). We hold hands and everything and I'm barely scraping the 5'2"" mark. I look young - most people think I'm 15 instead of 26. They probably think he's walking around with a prepubescent boy a lot of the time.

Here's a question I'd like to start with: on my next haircut, what's a short girly-cut I can get instead of my usual? I don't really like stuff in my hair, and I'm lazy and not a morning person so is there something I can get that would be low-maintenance but still girlier?

I also appreciate any other advice you care to give me. Although you probably won't convince me to grow my hair out. I work out 3-5 hours/day and have guys at my martial arts classes throwing me around and kneeling next to my head all the time. I just think it's not worth it, sorry.

Thanks everyone!

Anyone can denounce this practice, but eventually we have to put our money where our mouth is. Is there a Sub-reddit for this? Anyone know any good websites/stores or blogs? Specifically looking for clothes and shoes  that are American made, not prohibitively expensive, and not intended for anorexic 18-year-olds. (I'm looking at you, American Apparel &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)
 
TL;DR: I want to dress well, but not economically contribute to outsourcing/slave labor. Is this possible?

1332893662.0	rgpci	Help please. Looking to train myself to walk in heels, need some advice.	cynicaldesire	30	4	23	"As a girl who's been overweight all her life, and also on the tall side of all my class pictures but I think I've gotten to an average height, I've never been one to wear heels. My boyfriend and I hover around the same height frequently and I don't want to be taller than him, but he wants to admire the perks of a woman in heels. To be fair, I've been interested in heels before, but I had weak ankles as a kid and I do not relish crashing all 280lbs of myself onto the ground if I misstep. So I fear the fall, mostly.

Question is thus: How do I begin training myself to wear heels? Should I start with something short and wide to get my body used to the difference between my heel and the ground, but also enough room to catch myself?

How dooz it, r/fashion?

**EDIT:** Thanks so much guys! I used to wear platform-y things like a decade ago in high school. I even had some in elementary school before that. But it's hard for me to find ones I like in the stores today that have a nice fat heel that I would feel steady on.

I also want to add I'm not only doing this for my boyfriend. I'm a bit of a submissive when he mentions things he likes. Like I would normally never wear skirts, but I find myself trying to find them because I want to make him happy. We feed off each other's pleasure. He lives 800miles away, too, so none of this is super urgent, just something I was wondering how to do. I doubt I'll be working on it very often, like I don't work on my Wii fit that much either. :I

Hlh9532	38	11	33	"r/fashion reddiors, please vote for me to become American Apparel's Next Big Thing (first plus size model)! Below, I'll tell you why I'm the girl for the job. :) 

http://www.americanapparel.net/storefront/UGCStyle/ModelSearch2011/View.asp?e=9877

For six years of my life, I lived in a mental prison, obsessively counting calories and working out to an unhealthy size 0. I lost my period for five years. My butt cheeks didn't even touch! (Yep, you heard me...). Nothing mattered but performing my rituals and compulsions I conjured up in my head. There was zero space in my mind to see the world around me, connect with people, and ultimately live. But with time, countless doctors, helpful books, and role models in the plus industry, I began to heal. I decided to choose freedom and truly live life. I have accepted my natural size 12/14 curvy body and could not be happier or feel sexier! You can work out, eat all natural foods, and be a curvy girl working it in the fashion industry. I hope to inspire women with my story of embracing your authentic self and natural body to live life to the fullest. Help a curvy girl like me and let's break the uber-skinny status quo!"	t5_2qhoq	True

1269198122.0	bg9p2	looki—a newly launched website to share looks and find styles you like (written by a fellow redditor ☺)	pilt	23	0	30	"Hi!

Let me be the first to say that it reminds much of the fantastic service [lookbook.nu](http://lookbook.nu/), for those of you familiar with that website.

The idea is that looks (a collection of images, each image can be tagged with items) are submitted and that users hype (upvote in reddit lingo) looks that they like. It is possible to filter looks based on categories (shirts, jeans), brands, tags (geek, goth), and colors. Looks can be sorted based on popularity, number of hypes, or how new they are.

The website uses Facebook and Facebook Connect for most user interactions (commenting, finding your friends).

For users who run fashion blogs there are widgets available that can be placed on any website that allows javascript and iframes (tumblr does, to mention one). Other users who are connected to looki can then hype looks directly on the blog or website. (The widget has only been tested in recent web browsers though.)

Any input you have is valuable!

BTW. My sister is the sole submitter so far. ☺
