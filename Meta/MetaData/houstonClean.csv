1361143237.0	18pt71	ZaZa insiders question - what's up with room 322?	joelikesmusic	3409	831	2198	"stay here frequently when on business.  Hotel was booked solid and my colleague managed to score a room unplanned.  We all had normal zaza style rooms (swank) and he ended up in this goth dungeon closet.

Seriously- the room had a chain holding the bed to wall, pictures of skulls and a creepy, incongruous portrait of an old man.  Room was about 1/3 the normal size with the furniture blocking part of the TV, bed and window.    

We asked about it at the front desk and the clerk looked it up and said "" that room isn't supposed to be rented.' and immediately moved him.

Anyone know whats up with this room?

Edit to add the follow up from the Houston Press.  [Link](http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2013/02/hotel_za_za_secret_room_creepy.php).

Now I have to go and see if I can make reservations in the yacht room.  

Edit 2:  Chronicle emailed and I put them in touch with my friend who stayed in this room.  [Link](http://www.chron.com/life/article/Story-behind-ZaZa-s-Hard-Times-room-AKA-the-4288247.php).
 His name isn't max but that isn't the point of the story.  I still don't understand why these rooms aren't on the website (when all the other themed rooms are and this is a hotel - meaning they want to rent rooms).

Edit 3: This thread has been fun.  I'm not much for conspiracy theories and don't really buy all the skull and bones stuff. 
I just wanted to know what was up with the room and figured someone on here might know a bit.  
lots of the posts are asking questions about the pictures - they were taken months ago and no staging was involved. I'm not the photographer, just a curious Houston traveler usually in town for work with a group - one of whom happened to get this room and had the forethought to take photos. 

And to the very new redditor offering me a bounty to delete this thread  - I'll totally do it because cash is cash.  But i don't want to die either.  So let's do this publicly - I'm posting your message you sent me.  And we can meet at the Monarch bar next week  - I'll be in town on Monday &amp; will update this thread when I get to Monarch so we can meet.

1342711787.0	wtjzj	I moved to Houston 3 Days Ago. Here Are Some Things I've Learned.	dead2writes	508	77	652	"Hey /r/Houston, 

I just made the move to the city from Pennsylvania. This is my first time living in a major city. I made the move because 1) My girlfriend got a job as a high school English teacher, 2) I can work from home a.k.a anywhere and 3) I really needed to get out of Central PA, or Sanduskyville as they're now calling it. 

So here are some things this small-town young gentleman has noticed about his new home after a few days of residency.

1) Whataburger. Is. Amazing.

2) Mexican food. Is. Amazing. 

3) 610 is nuts. Just liquid insanity nuts. But besides that, drivers are really quite courteous, especially considering that we're in the 4th largest city in the country. 

4) My ""meh"" quality apartment has central air, and I consider that a marvel of modern engineering. 

5) Your DPS is new to me. Everything was handled by the DMV in PA. Just thinking about trying to get my TX  license makes my head hurt. 

6) ZOMG NO STATE INCOME TAX!

7) All political candidates are Republican or The Other Republican.

8) Galleria is totally overpriced.

9) It rains here like once a day for 30 minutes. Which might explain why it feels like we're living in a swamp.

10) Galveston beach water is so warm and heavenly. 

11) I was expecting everyone to have a southern accent like my family in Virginia. This is not so. Most people speak just like me, only with more ""Y'alls.""

12) I love saying ""Y'all."" Absolutely love it.

13) Man the Astros are terrible.

14) The Texans are going to dominate the AFC South this year. I'm a Redskins fan by birth (VA-born) but will support the Texans happily.

15) Lone Star is just like Keystone Light, only Texas-ier. 

16) WTF Sideways Traffic Lights.

17) Ozarka Water &gt; Tap Water. 

18) Everyone has a pair of cowboy boots. I seriously did not know they were this popular. I kind of want a pair of cowboy boots. 

19) There are hot peppers on everything and I love it. 

20) BBQ = OMFG. 

So /r/Houston, that's pretty much what I've picked up in my first couple of days. I'm still super new to the area and working from home kind of sucks for a social life, so if anyone has any advice on what to do, where to go or where to hang out I'd love to hear it! I'm getting a motorcycle next month, and hope to find a casual riding club somewhere in SW Houston. I also played regular bar shows in a band back in PA, so I'm hoping to find some musically inclined people here as well. 

**EDIT:** GF just informed me that we are NOT in River Oaks but in the Galleria area. Flair changed appropriately. 

**EDIT PART DEUX** Wow, thanks everyone for the great advice. I know for one thing I certainly won't be bored here. So many delicious unhealthy things to eat. As soon as I get a bike I'll make sure to let everyone who has one on here know. "	t5_2qj1l	True

We drove from Florida for a printmaking event at Continental Club. Your city was not what we were expecting. Houston is beautiful, full of life, and such a great place to visit. Everyone was so nice and polite. And even though we almost got blown away Saturday night (it's ok, we're used to thunder storms), we still had a great time. I just came by here to tell you how lucky you are to live in Houston, and I can not wait to visit again!	t5_2qj1l	True

1363963827.0	1asufm	Best Idea for the Astrodome I've Heard	smellyhoustonian	459	61	122	"****Edit**** The architecture student who did the project is going to sign up fr reddit and hopefully try and answer some questions. Username: UHArch

I saw a masters project from a UH Architecture student that essentially deconstructed the dome down to its metal frame and having it be essentially Houston's Eiffel Tower.

Underneath the steel skeleton of the Astrodome, some grass and trees can be planted that can serve three purposes. 1) During Texans season, it can be a tailgate area much like the Grove at Ole Miss 2) During the Rodeo, it can be exhibition space, or outdoor grazing land for the Livestock show part of the HLSR. 3) During the year, it's just a ton of greenspace that can be chalked off for a sports complex (Imagine having your kickball beer league underneath the old astrodome)

The cost of deconstruction is much less than the current demolition costs being proposed (You can't blow it up because it's so close to Reliant Stadium), and the cost of installing grass underneath will be very inexpensive, even compared to the installation of a parking lot in that area. 

I don't know how to make this idea get any traction where it matters, but I'd love to hear other people's thoughts.

Edit: Another user asked me to put up this info for how to hopefully get this idea some traction. He had City Council and the Mayor listed, so I left them up, but it's really the County that owns it and is in charge of the situation, so the County officials are listed at the bottom. Hit them all up, because council members can lobby the county, and so can the Mayor.

Marijuana reform is real.  It is happening all across the country and I am tired of waiting.  I have muscular dystrophy.  The only medicine available for nerve pain is either neurontin, lyrica, or cymbalta.  I have tried all three for years at a time.  IT DOES NOT WORK.

Marijuana is the only medicine (except pain medication such as hydrocodone, oxycontin, etc.  but why am I forced on these medications?)  that I have ever tried that let me have any relief at all in my daily life.  It is sad that I have to fight the federal government on what I can or cannot put into my body especially if it helps combat the symptoms.

Houston, how do we get this started?  We don't have to worry about the rest of Texas.  Houston can be the guinea pig and we can be the frontrunner of marijuana reform in the ironically conservative state of Texas.

Check us out on [Google Plus]( https://plus.google.com/107650034849753393045/about?gl=US&amp;hl=en-US), on [Yelp] (http://www.yelp.com/biz/beckers-books-houston), on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/beckersbooks?ref=hl) or in [The Chronicle]( http://blog.chron.com/bookish/2012/01/sandwiched-between-sex-and-americana-at-beckers-books/). About a year ago we had the [first sale for Redditors]( http://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/hpqvg/check_out_my_parents_independent_bookstore/), then about six months later we had [another]( http://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/xmgr9/my_parents_want_to_have_another_sale_for/). 

For this sale, we’re once again giving anyone who mentions Reddit 50% off. The sale will last from March 23rd-April 21st. If you can’t make it during our hours, message me what time and day you want to go and we will send someone to watch the store (as in, I will Reddit at the front desk for a few hours instead of at home, it’s really no big deal. I love having new people find the store). 

We are a very old school bookstore that is doing well in this tough climate for independent bookstores because we do a lot of business on the internet. We have no gimmicks and rarely do events. It’s just a deceptively large, wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling, front-to-back packed-with-books bookstore. If you like books you should probably budget a few hours just for browsing. 

If it’s a pretty day we have nice patios in front, out back, and on the side, so feel free to bring some food or grab a cup of coffee and set up to eat something or have a drink in the sunshine. The last two were a big success and both my parents and everyone who I talked to who made it to the sale were really excited. I hope to see some of y’all there!

If you're looking for something in particular and don't have time to browse, you can check for it [here](http://www.texasbooks.net/catalog/). If you find it we'll pull it for you and bring it to the store (from one of our warehouses where it most likely is). 


**The Deets**

* **What**: 50% off any purchase *in store* by mentioning Reddit

* **When**: 11am-6pm March 23rd-April 21st

Here are some current photos http://imgur.com/a/BVgnG#4 Here is her Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/moon693 Her name is Victoria Moon Erickson. She is from Atlanta Georgia but was visiting Houston Raw Food establishments for her blog permissiontoheal http://permissiontoheal.org/profile/victoriamoon?xg_source=activity. Here's her myspace http://www.myspace.com/lunar_v She was staying with Pat Greer of Pat Greer's Kitchen http://www.patgreerskitchen.com Pat discovered that Vicky was missing from her room Monday. Her dog, cellphone, wallet ID, and car were all still there but no Vicky. The most troubling info here is that she left her dog. That is VERY unlike Vicky to be apart from him. ANY information would be beneficial. Please feel free to PM me for more details.
Edit: I'm seeing a lot of down votes. If I posted this to the wrong Subreddit, let me know and I'll move the post. This looked like the best Subreddit to use.
Edit:  Police have been contacted and a missing persons report has been filed. They are also searching morgues and hospitals for Jane Does right now.  Any Redditors in Houston willing to help get media attention or ANY other help would be greatly appreciated.
Edit:  More info from Pat Greer:  Vicky was complaining on Saturday of a head injury.  Vicky was scheduled to help in the kitchen but had to lie down.  One of my current best case scenarios has Vicky suffering from a concussion and simply walking off into an unknown city.  If anyone in Houston is willing to put up flyers, this could greatly help.  If she saw herself on a telephone pole with a phone number to call, that would save the day.
Edit: Flyer Image: http://imgur.com/0mgeBER
Update: Facebook page now up devoted to bringing Vicky home safe: &lt;http://www.facebook.com/events/477814195608713/478009285589204/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity&gt;

THANK YOU REDDIT!!!
I just spoke with Kevin Reece and he will be running a story tonight on KHOU TV at 5PM CST  This will also be available on their website &lt;www.khou.com&gt;.  He said they learned of the story this morning from Reddit and had already been planning to do a story.  Thank you, thank you to everyone for the work so far!

The Pharmacy manager will refuse to sell you either the Plan B or a Pregnancy Test, nor will they direct you to an employee/store that does based on her personal beliefs. 

So my GF and I like to keep a PB pill at home just in case something happens, better safe then sorry and all that. Something did and we used it; today I figured since I was going to be near the CVS on lunch I'd pop in and pick one up. I have done this twice before over the past three years, just present my ID and money, it's no big deal. 

Today was different, I walked to the counter and asked for a PB Pill and test, as I'm getting my ID out she tells me she needs to speak with the woman. I'm taken aback by this and ask her what she needs to talk to her about, I bought them here before without issue. She then tells me she wont sell it to men. I ask her if this is a policy of CVS or if it's a personal belief and she straight face tells me it's her personal belief. I then ask to speak to her supervisor or manager and she informs me she is the manager, a quick glance at her name tag corroborates this. I then ask for the general store manager but seems she has authority when it comes to medications. I then ask her if there is another employee (I did not see any) or store I can go to buy them and she said ""only the woman can"". 

After a quick Goggling it does appear that [men over 18 can buy them](http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/what-fda-says.html), and [the last Texas pharmacist to refuse without referral was fired](http://www.hpso.com/resources/article/63.jsp).

EDIT: Just got a call back from the CVS Corp offices. I explained to them the same stuff as noted above and she put me on hold while she called the store/pharmacist. The corp rep told me this was in no way a policy of CVS and said the pharmacist said she was actually out of stock of the PB pill, and that she could sell me an alternative. I cried BS on this said she said nothing about stock and if it was then why speak to the woman, it’s not like having my GF come in will suddenly restock their supply; she flat out said she would not sell it to me because I am a man. The rep replied “Yea, it’s because you called Corp, but if you want we can order the pill for you and have it by Saturday [PB Pill needs to be taken within 72 hours of conception]. I replied that I will never shop at a CVS again so long as that woman is employed there, and that I already contacted my local news stations with the story. She continued with some platitudes and I collected her contact information and we needed the conversation cordially. 

EDIT #2, just to clarity, IANAL, however from my reading there does appear to be a refusal clause for pharmacists, that they can refuse to provide medication, but they HAVE to get another employee or store to help you. 

EDIT #3: So looks like it's getting a bit of traction with the local news agencies. 

It's been reported in the ""[The Digital Texan](http://digitaltexan.net/2011/state/can-texas-pharmacists-refuse-to-sell-morning-after-pill-to-men/article12585/)"", ""[Houston Chronicle](http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2011/12/houston-pharmacist-stops-man-from-buying-plan-b-pill/)"", and ""[Houston Press](http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2011/12/cvs_refused_man_plan_b.php)""."	t5_2qj1l	True

Thank you mcLurkel and arve93

To be clear: no deaths reported. 3 shootings reported.

Patients at Ben Taub hospital.

Area of shootings were campus library and possibly cafeteria as well.

Edit: police saying it was two victims, though three people were seen outside the library being treated. Two victims in hospital at the moment. Students being held on campus. Still searching for second shooter.

FINAL EDIT: Investigation ongoing as of 4:45 pm. 
""Two people have been taken into custody. One of the suspects was reportedly wounded in the shooting, and the other was arrested by a Houston Police Department SWAT team in a wooded area. No charges have been filed at this time."" - ABC News

Seems it was a dispute between two people, one of which was probably a student. Gunshots hit innocent bystanders once the incident started. 

Campus will reopen Wednesday. 

Other college campuses in Houston have been placed on high alert. Please watch out for any abnormalities and stay safe out there, Houston. "	t5_2qj1l	True

this is the link -- http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8130708

edit: thank you all so much for your kind words. i'm out of energy and just kind of up and manic at this point to respond and thank you each individually but really, really, thank you for being such kind hearted people. going around town sometimes it makes you think otherwise of houston. luckily, we have some great friends and we are all going through this together. she was loved so much by everyone that knew her. thank you for your kind words. &lt;3

edit2: still no new info, but again, thank you all. the outpouring of support from people i've never met is amazing. i'm doing as best i can and thank you all. on a sidenote, who downvotes stuff like this? i can see upvoting it or not caring either way, but really, downvotes? we're getting that goodhoustonian:asshole ratio down to a more accurate percentile with this, at least.

***EDIT*** HPD has a warrant for him and he will be setting bail tomorrow. He hit her going over 120mph, watched as it burned, waved my brother off when he asked for help and then ran down the road.

1353428816.0	13ij41	Dear cyclist who punched my car this morning,	potato_shaped_nuts	204	50	215	"I stopped at the light on Smith and Walker, poised to turn right between Tranquility Park and City Hall.  It was a little before nine, so there was sparse pedestrian traffic and hardly any cars.  I stopped at the light and rolled forward in preparation to turn right, double checking for any pedestrians I might have missed, or cars going straight through on Walker when there I saw you, in the right lane, cycling at a good clip, helmet on, garbed in your funky racing shirt.  I happily stopped rolling forward and waited for you to pass, making as much eye contact as I could so you would feel comfortable knowing that yes, I saw you and that I was sharing the road.

Then you veered toward me and started angrily waving me back.  I was confounded!  I was not in the lane you were cycling in, you had plenty of room for your right of way along the road.  You made no turn signal, you just started waving as if I was going to run you down.  Then I understood, you were intending to take to the sidewalk and I was blocking your access to it.  When I did not put my vehicle in reverse, you came right up to it and hit it yelling some obscenity and taking off through the park.

**Firstly, the emotional response:**

You dick.  I am a huge proponent of sharing the road.  Not only do I ride my bicycle for fun, but I commute, I ride with my family (two young sons), I roller skate on the street, in short: I am rather committed to the idea that we do not need to drive everywhere. I am very bicycle aware when I am driving and am extra cautious around those on the road from motorcycles to pedal-powered.  I am an excellent driver who has had maybe 5 tickets in his life time. You, sir, are a chip-on-the-shoulder jerk face with a little man complex.  Were we standing in line and you behaved that way, you would likely not even have the stones to look me in the eye let alone express yourself like a man.

**Secondly, the more rational response:**

You douche!  When you break the rules, you make it dangerous for everybody.  Everybody, especially your brothers and sisters who ride.  And you sir, broke the rules. [Section 45-302](http://library.municode.com/HTML/10123/level4/COOR_CH45TR_ARTXIIBI_DIV1GE.html#COOR_CH45TR_ARTXIIBI_DIV1GE_S45-302RISI): “No person shall ride a bicycle upon a sidewalk in the City of Houston within a business district or where prohibited by sign.” 

Cyclists who break the rules make it dangerous for everybody even for cars who might swerve to avoid hitting you.  But especially pedestrians suffer.  I have been hit on crosswalks and sidewalks by couriers on bike.  It is a two way street to share the road and you must do your part.

**Thirdly, most rational response:**

Nice shirt, jackass.  Maybe you were going to cut through Tranquility Park.  I called the city to see if this was kosher or not and was told by a very nice gentleman from the city that it is not something they enforce unless they get complaints.  Look, jackass, I can understand your frustration about having to live in a world with motor vehicles, but sharing goes both ways.  You could have very easily continued forward and entered the park from Walker.  You were taking a short cut through the park to get to the court building, I think.  And your short cut puts people in danger. I was busy making eye-contact with you so you would know that I saw you and froze so you could make your way.  Instead, you chose to approach my vehicle (into the cross walk) and accost me. 

You do not get to hit my property because you have to share the road or because I was in the way of your short cut.  You have your head so far up your own ass, you forgot that your shit stinks. If I see you on the street, as I am down town a lot, I will likely tell you this as I am not a coward.

**TL;DR Bike guy is a coward and an asshole unwilling to share the road.**

There's NO need to spend $25 to park in a lot for Astros/Rockets games etc. You can park on the street for FREE and it will probably be easier and more convenient. 

I never have a problem finding a spot a few blocks away. Plus its good to walk. And I hate trying to get out of parking garages. Most of the time if you park on a good street you can walk right to your car and get out of downtown with minimal hassle. 

I have been doing this for years and have ZERO problems. Street parking is just as safe or secure as a lot. In fact, you are probably LESS likely to get hit or dinged as you would in a lot. 

Don't get suckered in by the guys waving orange flags! You can park on the street free and easy. One time I went to MMP with another couple. They pulled into a $15 lot and I parked on the street literally 10 feet from them. I'll save that money thanks. Pass it on!"	t5_2qj1l	True

Almost every night in this city, there is something comical going on, whether it be an Open Mic or a show at a comedy club.    
    
Right now, the ""scene"" is not what it should be. The clubs aren't bringing the kinds of acts redditors would enjoy because not enough people are coming out to support or participate. I hate to say it, but Austin does a better job of supporting and encouraging local talent.   
     
I encourage you all to check out http://comedysceneinhouston.com to find what bars near you have open mics.  Come on out and watch or participate. It's usually free.    
     
You might see the next big thing.  Or just watch someone go nuts on stage. Either way, pretty entertaining.    
    
EDIT: Here is the list of open mics--    
Monday night @ Rudyard's

I took my bag out to make room to put it in. What I didn't realize was I never put my bag back in the car. I went to drive a short distance with my friends to go eat and realized it when I parked. We went back to the spot I was painting and found a homeless man where my car was parked. We asked him if he's seen it and he said no. We searched EVERYWHERE in that area. We even retraced the route to the restaurant to be sure that it didn't fall in the street in case I may have set it on the roof of my car. After I gave up and decided to just go home, I got [this](http://imgur.com/4tm0Umv).

**EDIT**: I called the number and it was indeed the officer and he told me to describe my bag and some of the contents in it. The way it all happened was quite serendipitous. He was patrolling that area and saw my bag in the middle of the street. I was an idiot and put it on the roof of my car.
He mentioned that he normally NEVER stops to pick up unassuming bags in the middle of the road because he's been with people who have done so and the contents would just be trash. But he did so yesterday. He didn't find anything interesting until he saw the $200 cash I had. He took my driver's license, ran it, and found my number and texted me. 
What's crazy is a lot of homeless people stay around that area and the first person to come across it was this officer. It really made my day and restored my faith in humanity."	t5_2qj1l	True

To Jack,

I tried to save your dog. I really did, but he passed right as I found an animal hospital. He was very calm and responsive as we were driving to the hospital. I kept telling him it would be okay and petting him and he seemed to be happy there was someone there. I'm sorry for your loss. As a fellow pet owner and pug lover I can only imagine the pain. 


To the drivers of Houston, 

Please slow down going down Shepherd or any residential neighborhood. Stop texting and driving. There are houses and people and pets all around you. This is not a race track. You will get where you need to be when you get there. 


To pet owners of Houston, 

Please watch your pets. This can happen to them.

I was clicking on the ""random"" link out of boredom, and came across this subreddit.  It made me want to tell you all a short story.  

About 2 or 3 years ago, I was dating a girl from Houston Texas.  I was in the midst of obtaining my degree from a small private college in Virginia, and I met this girl, whom we will call ""Loren.""  Loren was from Sugar Land and she would talk that shit up all day.  She was a swimmer at said private college.

After about 6 or 7 months of dating Loren, I flew to Sugar Land to meet her parents (for longer than a ""parents weekend"" or whatever at the college).  To end the story about her, I'll say this; she sucked.  Big ol'e balls.  

But that begins my story in Houston.  I had a great time, man.  The Houston skyline is ridiculous, at least compared to my home city of Richmond, VA.  If you're curious about that skyline, just head over to r/rva and you'll see it. 
Anyway, I treked on over to the museum district and walked around there for a while, found my way to the aquarium (which was really cool.)  I think that my happiest memory of Houston was Cane's Chicken, which thank friggin God, they just opened one in Richmond.  

One day soon, I may come back.  Without Loren, thank god, but Houston definitely made a good impression.

1344008664.0	xmgr9	My parents want to have another sale for Redditors at their independent Houston bookstore! 	pearlysoames	118	12	67	"Hey /r/Houston!

My parents want to do another sale like the one last year! If you come in during August and mention Reddit you get 50% off almost any purchase (not signed stuff etc). 

The store is Becker's Books about five minutes west of the Loop off the Katy Freeway. Exit Antoine. Go North on Antoine. Turn Left (headed West) on Westview. It will be on the left with a big sign that says BOOKS and you can get to it by U-turning at the second median break. 

We’re open Monday through Saturday 11-6. We’re about as Mom and Pop as you get, as the bookstore is literally owned by my Mom and Pop, but we’ve got a huge inventory and the word people most often use to describe the labyrinthine hallways and floor-to-ceiling shelves is “overwhelming.” 

Despite the fact that we have about two employees outside the family we have a pretty big online presence due to my parents both having written books about the Houston area and my Mom being an aggressive promoter of the store. You can check us out 

In the Chronicle

On Facebook you can check out Photos of inside the store

On Yelp

On The Bookshop Register

And find reviews and a map on Google+ 

EDIT- no more Yelp promo

If you've got any questions or need directions, call in at (713) 957 8088

tl,dr: Come in, buy books! Mention Reddit and get 50% off! 

Cross-Promos: Last time some people mentioned a few other independent bookstores in the Houston area. Here they are along with a few of our friends (but the sales promos do not apply at these stores, duh): Schroeder's Book Haven in League City, Paper Back Swap 'n' Shop in Dickinson, and Blue Willow Bookshop.

FYI and your thoughts on the matter..."	reasonable_	128	28	195	"I wanted to gather some feedback and inform fellow Houstonians of what occured this past weekend at a midtown bar (Drinkery).

So my friends and I go to this bar in midtown we've visited multiple times. It wasn't a crazy night but more of a casual one (my roommate had a 5k in the morning and had to be back early). So we go up to the door, and I'm just holding my license without much thought since we've been here before and it's not an exclusive club. One of my friend goes in and then I was told by one of the two bouncers that I can't go in because I was wearing a shirt with no collars (with jeans and dress shoes) while my white friend with sneakers (running shoes) and no collared shirt can go in. Btw, I wasn't dressed in baggy or dirty jeans/shirt because I was dressed to go out (Banana Republic, Kenneth Cole, and Express for reference).

Odd, since I've been there before dressed similarly. Whatever. We go to the side about 5-10 yards away and chat about it while waiting for our friend to come out. Main focus of this conversation was where to go next - we weren't yelling or causing a scene. At this point, one of the bouncers, who seemed surprisingly against me going in at the door in the first place, walks by and says ""it's cause you not white"" and walks away.

I was pretty dumbfounded and speechless that this would happen in this day and age (I'm Asian btw). So we go to another bar.

30 minutes later, we try again for shits and giggles, at which point I have no problems getting in with a different non-collared shirt, as we had expected. The guy that made the initial comment wasn't present at the door. And then he happens to see us inside as we walk in and proceeds to kick me and my roommate (who is also not white).

I posted this story on their facebook page, and whoever runs the page initially liked the comment (mockery? who knows). Then when people started commenting on it, the bar called BS on me saying I probably deserved it or got in a fight. And then deleted the post and all the comments.

[PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/LpvXqSP.png)

What do you guys think? I think this is pretty f'd up. First time receiving such a blatantly discriminatory comment (not counting jokes from friends lol) and action against me because of my race.

All of those cities have a good, actual rock station. Then we have Houston. They have The Buzz. I don't see how The Buzz can even call itself a rock station anymore. Most of the stuff they play now can also be heard on 104.1 and 96.5. That right there should tell them they're no longer a rock station. Granted, every once-in-a-while they'll play some good rock, but for the most part they've become a new, trendy pop station.

With Houston being by far the biggest city in Texas, why doesn't a good rock station pop up? Yes, we have tow decent classic rock stations that I listen to often, but I would really love to hear some good non-classic rock.

Sure, I could subscribe to Sirius, or I could just stream music off my phone, but for some reason I'm just a person who wants to get in the car, pop on a radio station, and listen to whatever's on.

Today my wife got harassed by the short, bald cop and in the end got a ticket (I won’t reveal his name).  Just a few weeks ago I had a similar incident with the same cop so I know it wasn't my wife causing the trouble.


If any of your live in the area you know that cars and trucks park along the street all hours of the day, even the side of the street that has a no parking sign =/ .  Anyway, my wife pulled up behind a large truck parked on the side of the road and proceeded to go around it.  Just at that moment the cop walked out into view from the front of the truck and pointed at my wife and started screaming at her.  She stopped and the cop walked over to her screaming that there is a moving truck on the road and you can’t drive around it.  My wife said the truck wasn’t moving at the time and she didn’t even see him.  Well regardless, he screamed at her and asked for her license and registration.  My wife asked why and he told her it didn’t matter, just give them to him.  He then proceeded to write her a ticket for driving on the wrong side of the road.  She then asked to speak to the supervisor since this seemed rather unfair, so the cop huffed off.  At that moment the truck was still there and 10+ cars drove around the truck.  Did those cars get a ticket?  Of course not.  She spoke with the owner and he just went on and on as to why they ended up having to hire cops, blah blah blah.  He said he also has a video camera pointing in the street and tried to bring it up so they could watch the incident, but conveniently he couldn’t get it working.  Basically in the end the owner said it was the cops word against hers as the truck driver couldn’t even vouch if he was moving at that instant or not.


My incident was less severe, but similar.  I pulled onto 25th St. behind a truck that was parked on the side of the road and the same cop walked into the middle of the road and told me to stop while the truck pulled into the driveway.  Okay fine, I wait.  After the truck pulled 100% into the driveway the cop walked off the street back up the driveway.  I figured that was my queue to proceed as there was no longer anything in the road.  Just as I start going the cop runs into the street in front of me pointing and yells at me “Did I tell you you could go?!”.  I said “No, but I assumed since the street was clear and you walked away it was okay to go.”  He then says “Well I’m the one directing traffic here, not you.  I never said you could go.”  I just apologized and he gave me a few more choice words about how he’s the shit, then let me go.


This cop is absolute douche canoe, basically on a power trip.  I’ve seen several cops working at C&amp;D and it’s only this one that gives any trouble.  It just sucks because I know there’s nothing we can do and this douche will continue doing what he’s doing.  Unfortunately we live on this street and have to drive by all the time.  *sigh…   Anyway, she’s of course going to fight the ticket because cars drive around parked trucks all the time on that street, there’s no way this can hold up, but regardless it’s a hassle.

I'll go in order of things that angered me.

The traffic/parking there is always terrible there, that is a given; last night was definitely no exception.

The line to get in was substantially longer than it needed to be. I felt like the TSA was running security there. Pat down? Lift up your pants? Show your waist? Take everything out of my pockets? Take off my hat? I saw a girl literally turn her purse upside down and dump everything onto the ground in frustration. She just left it all lying there and walked in. 

The beer prices are expected to be terrible at these places, but come on man. $12 for an ""Import"" beer. Fucking Shock Top is made by Inbev you assholes.  

Other than that everything was excellent except for the Woodlands noise ordinance which made the concert end at 10:20, Oh and the fact that the music wasn't loud at all (I was sitting as low on the lawn as possible). This is the Black Keys people, this band was founded on loud, screaming, distorted guitar and booming drums (see Thickfreakness) . I play louder music in my office. 

Again guys, no hate for the Keys, but this Pavilion is terrible. I have said it once and didn't follow though, but this time I will. I am never going back to the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion....Except maybe if Daft Punk played, then I guess I would have to go.

It was a great finals from every team! 

This is the first time we had a final four with one team from each Super Regional and the first time we had a final four without a team from Chicago or Illinois. It's also the first time we had an international team in the final four.

In the car, in the shower, at work when there's no one around?  Well, what you NEED to do is sing **HARMONY**.  If you've never done it, you REALLY should.  There is NOTHING like it.

Here's what to do:  Clear off Monday evenings on your calendar.  Come to our barbershop chorus rehearsal.  It is FREE and you'll be welcomed like an old friend.  You'll meet 50+ other normal guys from age 20 on up, who sing ONLY FOR THE FUN of it.  You can stand on the risers and sing along (we have guest music books) or just sit and watch.  Heck, bring your girl or wife.  

Stay through the break and tell them you're there because of Reddit and you'll get a Reddit sticker.  If you show up with one of your buddies who ALSO likes to sing, you'll get a [Reddit/WhyNotBarbershop](http://www.reddit.com/user/WhyNotBarbershop) mouse pad.  You could probably get it autographed by the creator of that novelty account.

You do not have to be able to read music to do this.  We provide learning tracks so you can play the song you need to learn, on your car radio or .mp3 device, over and over until you know your part.  When you sing it with others doing their parts - **it is magic.**

Here's the [link for the location](http://www.houstontidelanders.org/location.html) - it starts at 7 PM every Monday.  If you want to learn more about our barbershop chorus, just visit the web site - [HoustonTidelanders.org](http://www.houstontidelanders.org/).  We're a non-profit organization and our hobby is something any guy who can carry a tune in a bucket should at least TRY.  Come on out and see.

Frightened of the traffic, scared of being robbed, terrified of the unknown and my first stop was F-Bar to meet my friends who welcomed me with open arms. I had only been here once in high school and hated the city, so I was def not happy to come back. This place was my last chance, but I happily slept on a floor in Katy for over a month holding out for anything to come my way. I graduated from seminary at Baylor in May and couldn't get a job in Waco, Dallas/Ft. Worth, home in Northeast Texas, Austin, so Houston was the last place where I had a free place to sleep. What a year it has been! I have special friends, happy at Ecclesia Church, part of the Couchsurfing community, and FINALLY got a real job in June, and will be moving into my very own apartment tomorrow! I never thought I would be living in Houston, Texas and most certainly never thought I would say, I am am happy to be here :)

I took him to the vet to search for a microchip with no luck, so he has been staying with me since then. I have posts up on craigslist and several Houston lost pets sites, but so far no luck in the owner turning up. I can't keep him forever, as my work schedule is bonkers, and I would be the worst doggy daddy ever right now, so I am posting here in hopes of either finding the owner, or finding a good home for him. He's totally house broken, and he has been a wonderful house guest for the few days(hasn't chewed or scratched anything), and all he wants to do is cuddle. This is kinda a shot in the dark, but hopefully something comes out of it.

[My aspiring nano-brewery](http://www.facebook.com/28thDay)

Edit: Just realized I didn't say anything about the actual beer itself!  It's an American style stout which basically means more roasty and hop oriented than, say, a standard guinness.  But you really cant compare the two.  This one is about 6.5% alcohol, 60 IBUs, and has tons of hop flavor and aroma.  You'll pick up on coffee/espresso and a bit of citrus in the nose.  Definitely a welcome addition to the dark beer scene around here IMO."	t5_2qj1l	True

While I do not doubt that many people are indeed missing family members or close friends and that an online community can be helpful in bringing people back together, please take such posts with a grain of salt. 

A story is very easy to cook up, and the internet is a great place for stories. Combined with the anonymity but simultaneous possibility for invasion of privacy via the posting of personal information, a lot could go wrong. Most users of the internet are aware of this to some degree. 

There are avenues for asking for missing persons. A local subreddit should not be one of them. For all you know, people asking for help finding their ""sister"" could be stalkers. If a person is missing because they have been kidnapped, then even trained people like the police cannot help - what is the chance that a random sighting could solve the problem? If a person is mentally ill, then chances are they will get noticed and returned to their families. If a person willingly goes missing then that is their right. 

Please be wary of what people say online. Cheers, /r/houston!"	t5_2qj1l	True

I tried to explain Reddit to them but they're not terribly technical. When I finally managed to articulate and told them there was a Houston subreddit they said I should offer up a special for anyone who wants to come in.

This place is *not* Barnes and Noble. If you like getting lost in the stacks, check it out. If you like sippin lattes and perusing the latest bestesellers, check it out too, although we have no lattes and only sell used books. Just come in before the end of June and mention Reddit and you get a 50% discount.

It's in West Houston just outside 610 north of I-10.

EDIT- I told my parents to print out the Reddit Alien and put him up in the store, so if they're not working that day tell the person at the front that you're ""there from that place on the internet with the alien up there on the wall"" and you'll get the discount. "	t5_2qj1l	True

Friday, July 2nd a black SUV with large silver trim (similar to an Armada) followed him from the bank's parking garage to Kroger on W. Gray.  The Kroger security camera showed the SUV closely tailing his vehicle, stall to allow him to park, and then position itself parallel to him on the next aisle.  Two black males were in the SUV.  One of the suspects broke the passenger side window, while the other acted as getaway driver.

Monday, July 5th an unidentified vehicle followed him from the parking garage to a business in the Garden Oaks area, a 15-20 minute drive. His car was parked in a secure populated area. The driver's window was busted out within 5 minutes.  A Green SUV was seen parked next to him for a moment and may be involved. 

He was more cautious when leaving the bank on Monday.  According to police, this has been happening around the area. 

Be careful and aware of your surroundings. These jerks appear to be  organized and willing to break into vehicles in daylight in very public places. "	t5_2qj1l	True

I can't stand listening to the same generic pop on KRBE over and over, and the same goes for 95.7. KILT and 93Q spend all their ""commercial free"" time talking about how they play more music than the other.

We have about a dozen Spanish channels, terrible rock choices, annoying country choices, and crappy pop channels. Why does no station experiment for stuff that people would really enjoy without getting bored?

Edit: http://www.houstonareaweb.com/radio/

About 2 dozen gospel and non-english stations. 4 country stations and 1 rock station (Besides oldies).

1344997801.0	y8n5e	Ron Carter Hyundai decided to void the contract on the deal I worked 10 days ago.	AFlyingToaster	73	10	68	"On Saturday, August 4th, against better judgment, I went to Ron Carter Hyundai in Friendswood to buy a car - a Veloster. I spent the day negotiating a deal with two sales people and the Sales Manager. This particular car, I was told, was scheduled to arrive 5-10 days from that Saturday. I did all the paperwork, got approved through Hyundai to finance the vehicle, and signed the contract. Because the car was not yet available, I was given a loaner.

On Tuesday, I took my down payment check to the dealership and was told my car would be here ""sometime this week"" by one of the sales people I originally worked with. On Saturday, I called the dealership and was told that, although some cars had arrived mine had not yet. I was told it would be here Tuesday (today).

Today, I called again to inquire about where my car was. I reached the sales manager - who was on vacation - and he said he would talk to his inventory manager and call me back. When he did, he informed me that my car was to arrive on the 18th and was ""always scheduled to arrive on the 18th"" because that was the date on the invoice. I was never told this when I did the deal originally. When I asked why I was told 5-10 days and not the date on the invoice by both him and his sales staff, he got incredibly defensive. He told me that he never said that and that rather than deal with an unhappy customer, he was going to void my contract, renege on the deal, take back the loaner, and give me my money back.

When I got to the dealership, I met with one of my original sales guys and he took me to the sales management office. The sales guy told me I was wrong, was never told 5-10 days, was always told the 18th, and that I was ridiculous for even inquiring about where my car was. A sales manager gave me my original cashiers check down payment, and cash for my trade as they had already sold it. He then told me that Ron Carter voids contracts ""all the time"" so they don't have to deal with unhappy customers.

**TL;DR:** Ron Carter told me their survey scores were more important than my business and voided the contract I signed 10 days ago on a car that had yet to arrive at the dealership. I was then told that Ron Carter voids contracts all the time.

Do I have a breach of contract case here? Would it be worth the time to contact the local news stations or even an attorney?"	t5_2qj1l	True

It's only a 700sqft apartment with two people who are gone most of the day for work. We have a service animal that's there for a lot of the day and it's taking a toll on him.

* My brother-in-law was found lying (unconscious, I believe) on or near a road somewhere in Houston around 7:00 AM on Monday.  The person who found him called 911.
* He was taken to Memorial Hermann (not sure which facility, presumably the big one on I-10).
* He suffered some pretty bad head trauma, broken ribs, and some other injuries.
* He's still in the ICU but has regained consciousness and can't remember how the incident happened.

He was discovered near his bicycle and his helmet, which had been cracked open.  He's an avid bicyclist and is generally more of an off-road trail kind of guy, but he likes commuting on his bike, too.

He's been staying in Spring, so I don't know if he just happened to be riding near Memorial or if he was riding near Spring and his injuries were so bad that he was moved or transported directly to Memorial.  He's in his early 40s and is an ex-Marine.

I wish I had more details (especially about specific locations) to provide, but if any of you happen to have some information about what happened, please let me know.  Thanks a bunch.

1341940032.0	wc3s6	TIL Houston has the largest produce Co-Op in the USA. $47 gets you a huge box of fresh produce. Pickup at the Houston Arboretum (Tue, Thurs, Sat)!	Yum_Waffles	69	7	39	"A few weeks ago, after examining my HEB grocery bill, I realized I spent a ton of money on produce every week. I enjoy vegetables &amp; fruit, but I often spend too much and sometimes forget about it and it ends up going bad. I started Googling around, and stopped by a few farmer's markets in town, but always found parking to be a hassle and to be super over-crowded.

A few weeks ago, I stumbled across the [Rawfully Organic Co-Op](http://www.rawfullyorganic.com/index.php). Essentially, fresh produce is ordered in bulk and split into boxes for the community to purchase, lowering costs. I picked up a box, and wow, I was impressed. I got a huge box full of zucchini, beets, lettuce, kale, okra, peaches, nectarines, bananas, kiwis, plums, apples &amp; more. I've been eating much healthier, feeling great, and have enjoyed the challenge of learning how to cook vegetables I rarely buy (who the heck cooks beets regularly?).

They offer pickup Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at the Houston Arboretum (inside memorial park). They also offer drop off locations, but I'm not quite sure how those work. Kristina Carrillo Bucaram  organizes the Co-Op and has a Youtube channel with a pretty good following. She prepares, and eats a raw vegan diet every day, and teaches others how to prepare their food in such a way.

I'm very much a meat eater, and far from a vegan, but I've found the produce to be of amazing quality and have noticed how much better I feel from consuming more produce. 

Anyhow, I figured r/Houston may be interested in cheaper ways to eat healthier. More deets below:

1375081515.0	1j9i0l	Update: Drunk driver in backyard	coffeeblacknosugar	68	12	45	"In case there is any interest, I thought I'd submit an update on the situation surrounding the drunk man that drove through our backyard a few nights ago.  I know this was a bit of a unique situation, so it prompted a lot of interesting discussion about the DWI (and other) laws in Houston and how they are implemented.  We were very frustrated by the lack of consequences for the driver, and I know this sentiment was echoed by others here as well.  

Because of this, the post attracted the attention of one of our local news channels and also prompted a visit from a couple of HPD redditors, who spent some time with me and my husband going over some of the reasons things turned out the way they did.  Regarding the response time, our call was initially qualified by 911 dispatch as a generic low-level disturbance, which is logged but not broadcast over the radio to the HPD.  When I called back and told dispatch my husband had a loaded weapon, this obviously moved our call up the priority list and it was then transmitted over police radio.  They were essentially unaware of our situation until after the second call - this is what caused multiple police cars to arrive simultaneously.

Concerning the private property v. public roadways discussion, it sounds as though the police may have been able to charge the man with DWI given our neighbors' eye witness accounts of him on the road (in addition to what we saw him doing in our backyard).  Perhaps the various pieces of relevant information were spread among the 10 or so officers that showed up, so the whole picture did not get put together adequately before they left.  Still not quite sure about this.

So really our only recourse at this point is to sue for damages to our property, which amounts to three sizeable dead patches of grass where I suspect some sort of petroleum fluid leaked from his car.  But honestly, who has time for that.

I hope this information is useful, and I appreciate the feedback and support from our fellow Houstonians.  Also, thank you to the friendly HPD redditors who took the time to address all of our unanswered questions.

TL;DR: old man still gets away with it, HPD saves naps for after the job."	t5_2qj1l	True

So Ernesto is tracking right to the gulf, and there's like a 50% chance he'll hit Texas. A high moving east will almost certainly keep him away from LA, MS, and FL.  He's tracking fast, but if he hits us it's still a week out.

Also, Invest 90L (that ""1"" down off africa) is kind of rocking and rolling. Low shear and the SAL pushed north should allow it to develop into TS Florence soon.  Steering currents should still be favorable to guide her into the Gulf.  I don't see a likely high that's going to come sit over us and keep her away, but it's two weeks out.

Some people got butthurt with the south park reference in my last title.  Suck it.  You live in Houston, so you should be ready for a hurricane or flood any way.  Keep your pantry stocked with canned stuff that you can eat without cooking, keep a few jugs or barrels or water handy, and don't let your fuel tank get below half full.  If you're especially preparation-oriented, get a generator and a trifuel kit so you can hook it to your natural gas.  That pretty much never goes out.

Gonna be a fun week! "	t5_2qj1l	True
