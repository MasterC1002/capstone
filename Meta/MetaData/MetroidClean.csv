1366825050.0	1d0t7p	So I just finished Metroid Prime...	Skytch	81	5	105	"And I whole-heartedly enjoyed it the whole way through. The game definitely has aged well and I'd like to list the things I liked and didn't like in the game. I hope you don't mind if I share my thoughts.

**Things I liked**

- The framerate. Very smooth and something that I can definitely appreciate in games today.

- The soundtrack, especially that menu theme. I've only played so many Metroid games, but this game I found to have the most immersive soundtrack thus far. Zero Mission had a nice soundtrack for Gameboy Advance, but MP really resonates with me. The music was really original and definitely relfects the nature of the Metroid series, especially with the intensity of the music in the final stages of the game. 

- The weapons. Each weapon is unique and very fun to use. I really like the fact that in Metroid games, you can't go through certain doors unless you have the weapon to open it. I'd like to see games in the future do something like this ""key-less"" approach. 

- The use of visors. This was a huge one-up for the game because there were many situations where using a different visor to defeat and enemy or know the territory was very cleverly done in this game. Also, the tons of info I learned from the scanner visor was cool. Definitely adds to the atmosphere of the game.

- The grappling beam. Nothing compares to the fun you can have swinging on this thing haha

- All of the lore. Especially the stuff involving how the Pirates were experimenting on Metroids and Phazon. Made the enemies of the game have a purpose. 

- The Aesthetics. Samus' suit looks awesome all throughout the game, the environments look amazing and even the bosses are well designed. Looks astonishing even to today's standards. Maybe it would look better in Unreal Engine 4 or something of that caliber, but not far off. 

**Things I didn't Like**

- Traveling from place to place. There would be times where it took me a good 15-20 minutes just to figure out how I wanted to get where I wanted. There were some elevators that led to different parts of areas and it confused me half the time.

- The metroids that split into two near the end of the game. I found them to be more of a nuisance than a challenge, having to keep switching my weapon, charging it and aiming it at the right metroid, only to be interrupted by another one coming from the side and forcing me to get it off by power-ball bombing it. It wasn't until the final boss out of desperation that I discovered that smart bombs can easily kill them in one hit. 

- The phantom chozo in random rooms. I didn't really get why that was and I found it annoying to enter a room and hear the shrieks of them every time. 

It's still an all around great game and I'll definitely be holding on to the game as well as picking up the sequel.  "	t5_2rrd6	True

1355951946.0	154nyz	So I had an idea for the next game's story	MinusTheFire	80	16	30	"I’ve had this idea for a while now, and it’s seemingly a very simple concept.  Assuming that the next game released is actually considered Metroid 5 (following Metroid Fusion, obviously), here’s how I envision the opening sequence going down…

Samus and her ship are captured by the Galactic Federation, who obviously want her for questioning in regards to the incident on the BSL Station and the destruction of SR388.  Samus is imprisoned by the GF after being questioned and now faces charges of some form of treason and/or intergalactic war crimes for the incident, and these charges serve primarily to offer her up as a political scapegoat in an attempt to pin the whole thing on Samus whilst simultaneously keeping their Metroid research under wraps.

While in custody, Samus is rendered unconscious so that experimentation can be done on her cellular makeup.  They invented a Metroid vaccine, which saved her from the X-parasites, now they want to reverse engineer a new vaccine which will allow them to readily absorb the X-parasites in the same way that Samus does now.  During the experiment, Samus has flashes of waking memory in which she discovers what the GF’s plan is, and she eventually wakes up in the middle of everything and attempts to fight free of her restraints and make an escape.  This is where the gameplay starts.

You wake up, activate your power suit (or the Fusion suit, rather) with full abilities, and fight your way out of the lab to try and find your ship.  You don’t make it very far before a voice comes over your communicator telling you that the Federation has deemed you “too dangerous to be kept alive”, just before you find out that all of your weapons and gadgets have been tampered with and are now under GF remote control (since the weapons were provided by the GF anyways, for the most part).  The idea was to wipe Samus’s memory of everything in her past, except Metroids, as the GF has now realized that the combination of X/Metroid DNA in her system has made her the perfect candidate for the new Mother Brain.  The Federation had planned to turn Samus into a fully-controllable, living drone.

You woke up before they could complete the process, however, so you’re still in control of all normal bodily functions.  The breakout of the lab triggers a failsafe function, and a countdown begins warning you of the impending destruction of the lab.  Since you have no control over your suit anymore, you begin to uninstall and remove everything that’s under Federation control, all while you’re frantically trying to find a way out of the lab.

After you escape, it’s the title screen.  I imagine the rest of the game involving the search for a lost Chozo planet of sorts, finding and building up a new power suit, and slowly discovering that the GF had already embedded you with the ability to control certain types of Metroids.  The central plot would involve an attempt to uncover the Galactic Federation’s plan to some sort of higher authority, would take place on multiple planets and/or space stations, so on and so forth.

I’m sure I’ve hit a few continuity snags here and there, but I think you guys kind of get the idea of where my head’s at.  Let’s get a discussion going about what you’d like to see as the plot for the next game and, if anyone has any ways to make my idea better, please share them!

Doesn't sound like the game is being reprinted, but regardless, GameStop told Kotaku that the company managed to get its hands on more copies of *Metroid Prime Trilogy*, and will be opening the floodgates again ""in the coming months."" [Right now, GameStop lists the collection for $84.99](http://www.gamestop.com/wii/games/metroid-prime-trilogy/74982), which is less than most listings for the game on sites like eBay. If the recent *Xenoblade Chronicles* events are any indication, they won't increase the price any higher than that, though they also probably won't lower it since it's an easy way for them to get money.

Figured you guys would be interested! Personally, I plan on getting a copy of the game once they get it in stock. I've been enjoying playing through *Prime* on my GameCube, but playing it with pointer controls and getting those bonus goodies would be really nice.

**8/15/13 edit:** As of today, GameStop's website has the game in-stock. Plus, stores seem to be getting shipments of the game in lately. Looks like ""in the coming months"" was PR for ""in two days."""	t5_2rrd6	True

I remember the first time I sat my foot on Elysia. The music together with the sunset and the floating islands that you see in the background is so beautiful, and together with the lightning clouds down below makes it so serene and calm. And of course, Bryyo. I have always enjoyed the Cliffside music, but after I read all the Bryyo lores, it got a whole new depth to it. I can picture the proud Bryyonians singing the song of their people.  

The Prime games are some of the most atmospheric games I've ever come across, and I love them for that. The sense of isolation in the first installment is one of the best feelings I've had in a game.

1358360314.0	16p3gc	OK Metroid fans, time for a serious discussion. Prime is over, Other M happened, and there's a new console generation upon us. Where should the series go from here?	MelancholySpork12	61	10	111	"I'm bringing this up because there's a pretty strong possibility of a future Metroid game from Nintendo - they've expressed interest in bringing Samus to the Wii U multiple times, Retro Studios is still working on an unannounced project, 3DS is in full swing, .etc. The air is ripe with possibility, but one thing that nobody's really considered is that there's a fairly large question mark dominating the future of the franchise. 

The Prime series, while iconic, was a spin-off series. It expanded the Metroid universe and lore by a power of ten, but it didn't technically move the story along. Chronologically, Fusion is still the most recent game, and it left the series pretty open-ended for sequels. 

Another (much more important) thing to consider is how the series should evolve from a gameplay standpoint. FPS Metroid has been rolled over, and I think most fans are ready for something new. Other M tried to combine both styles of play, and I think most of us will agree that the FPS segments in the game were unnecessary. 

In my opinion, if Metroid wants to nail another successful game, the series has to evolve **again**. Retro studios pulled off a miracle when they modernized Samus without sacrificing the heart of the franchise, but that ship has sailed. What's next? A Super Metroid reskin a la Donkey Kong Country Returns? Prime 4? Something completely different? We can't dismiss the possibility that Nintendo will simply run with the Other M take on the franchise, completely dripping with PMS.

I'd love to get some ideas going here. Metroid's proven to be a flexible series in the right hands - what other tricks do you think it could pull? "	t5_2rrd6	True

1341710485.0	w7b0s	Miyamoto wants a new Metroid (and StarFox) for WiiU	dlbpc	57	10	41	"   We all want to see one Nintendo franchise or another come to Wii U. Some of us eagerly anticipate the next Zelda, or want to see a true 3D Mario along the lines of Mario Galaxy. Yet if there's one person whose opinion matters more than all others, it's Shigeru Miyamoto's.

 

   As the co-manager of Nintendo's internal development teams and one of the most senior executives at the company, the legendary designer surely has a bit more influence than just about anyone else in the world. When I recently chatted with Miyamoto, I asked him what he would want to see on Wii U.

 

   With the caveat that he's not necessarily talking about games in active development, and that the process of evaluating which characters and games are appropriate for a system or mechanic is always ongoing, Miyamoto indicated two franchises have his attention. The first? Metroid.

 

   ""With Metroid it's very easy to imagine some interesting implementation for Wii U,"" Miyamoto mentioned. ""I think that having another screen with the gyro built in really gives you a lot of interesting opportunities for development, and we can bring a lot of our games to life in a completely unique way with that.""

 

   ""I feel like the possibilities of the GamePad for Metroid could be really fantastic,"" Miyamoto told me at a different point in our conversation. ""There's certainly a lot that you could do there for that game.""

 

   Yet the one that Miyamoto really wants to see? The Nintendo executive didn't give any details, but noted that ""personally"" the franchise he wants most on Wii U is Star Fox. Here's hoping one day Miyamoto's wish - alongside millions of Nintendo fans - is realized on the HD system.

 

http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/07/06/miyamoto-discusses-metroid-on-wii-u

I feel like the game captured the atmosphere much better, with the exception of the starting outside area in SM, which was masterful. The addition of a computer didn't make the game any less lonely, in my opinion. As the story progresses, you become more and more desolate, until you have no allies at all, and you feel very alone.

1346640552.0	z9e8l	Metroid Other M was actually a psychological horror about Samus battling her degrading mental state. (x/post from r/FanTheories)	t_j_k	55	11	22	In Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Samus's mental state is slowly degrading from the phazon, but starts to slowly recover once it is wiped from her system. During Metroid II, the addition of new chozo artifacts to her system continues to help repair her mind, and meanwhile, the Space Pirates are attempting to create artificial phazon for their weaponry. Samus's mental state is quite unstable by the end of Corruption, but could not be expressed very well in the confines of the gamebody. By Super Metroid, Samus's body and mind is almost entirely repaired, but the damage can not be totally repaired. Samus breaks in through the laboratories, and doesn't know about the faux-phazon (faux-zon?). Then, the Mother Brain shoots the fuck out of her with the faux-zon beam, the faux-zon juiced baby metroid injects it directly into her. Her mental degradation starts with a bit of latency, and the events of Other M ensue. However, most of the degradation is in her Chozo armor; remember, it's directly linked to her central nervous system. Come Metroid Fusion, almost all of it is surgically removed, and taking with it the degradation of her brain. The only thing left affected is her memory of how many times she served under a commanding officer. TL;DR: Phazon got Samus all retarded during the events of Other M, and Metroid Prime is still canon.	t5_2rrd6	True

1358428068.0	16qzue	"Instead of beginning the game with no power (post-intro) and getting stronger throughout the game, what if you began with full power and gradually lost your upgrades?
"	RetroTheft	47	9	36	"This would need some ace design, but we are talking about Metroid here. Some points:

Bosses: It's typical game convention for bosses to evolve a stronger form and become harder to hurt throughout a game, but what if you could keep that SAME game mechanic and have it make more sense? ie by the main character becoming WEAKER throughout the game. If there are several recurring bosses throughout the game that run off once they're hurt, but the next time you battle them you're less powerful, that would make things more challenging. (Also, Other M did a lot wrong, but the concept of a boss which grows older throughout the game was great, and is one of the few times where that 'stronger form' trope made sense.)

New Areas: This would be the hardest part to work, since the best part of Metroid is finding new areas. But there's a corollary -- what about LOOKING for new areas? One thing that Super Metroid did amazingly, and possibly better than any game before or after, was guide the player without the player knowing it. As a VERY simple example, you get stuck in a room with only one door and it locks. You KNOW there must be another way out, so you look for it. What if the game quickly established that you would never be locked out of anywhere you had previously been, but you might have to find a NEW way of getting there? Secret walls that even your X-ray visor doesn't see are a common thing in Metroid games. You might only find them if you have to. And this doesn't take into consideration new game mechanics which I haven't thought of, regarding transport.

(Edit: At the beginning you might have a basic 'blueprint' that shows you various connections, but not their exact locations. This could be a way of finding alternate routes once you are locked out of using a certain power, but still have others at your disposal)

The order of downgrade: In Metroid games there's often room to move in regards to which order major upgrades are obtained. What if, instead of the downgrades being purely time/progress based, they were based on which areas you went to? This could be explained pretty quickly by a certain environmental feature having an effect, or a creature or something. This would keep replayability interesting. On a second play through you could use an alternate method to get somewhere and be able to fight the enemies therein with weapons you didn't have last time.

You could even finally get everything back right at the very end, in a ""Hyper"" sort of moment -- and I'm pretty sure that would be even more satisfying than just being full powered at the end, because you would have already developed an attachment to all your powerups and would know how to use them, and you sure as hell would have been made to miss them when they were gone. In fact, the final boss sequence could return all your powerups to you somehow and then need to be good at using them if you wanted to escape the planet before it blows up. Because if there's one thing I know about Metroid, it's that the planet should always blow up."	t5_2rrd6	True

1342116786.0	wgcg9	Why I liked Prime 2: Echoes better than Prime 3: Corruption (warning: wall of text)	MelancholySpork12	48	10	53	"After picking up the Metroid Prime Trilogy, I've had the distinct pleasure of playing through all three games again with updated controls and widescreen. Such joy! Prior to this, I haven't touched any of the Metroid games for more than a year, so I'm doubly blessed with the feeling of re-discovery as I play through them. 

On a whim, I opted to play through the Trilogy backwards, starting with Prime 3 and working my way to Prime 1. I actually found this to be very interesting, since a lot of the changes made from Prime 1 to Prime 2 were dropped in Prime 3, and a lot of logical improvements along with them. As a result, it almost felt like Prime 2 actually came after Prime 3!

One of the most tangible improvements exclusive to Prime 2 is scanning. In Prime 2, doors, health packs, and items don't count as logbook entries. This makes sense to me since most people wouldn't think to scan those anyway. Echoes is also the only game that lets zoom in and rotate the the 3D model of everything you scan. I think this feature is beyond cool, especially since, Echoes has a lot of very unique enemy designs. Why was this dropped from Corruption? 

Corruption feels like a step backwards in a lot of ways. One of the biggest disappointments in Corruption, for me, was the soundtrack. It's just so boring compared to the first two games. VERY few of the tracks stand out, and the boss music is unfailingly bland. I can't even remember what it sounded like, and I beat it four days ago. Echoes, on the other hand, had a lot of stand-out tracks and a MUCH better presence. Even the less interesting, ""ambient"" tracks do a great job of setting the atmosphere, whereas Corruption's music suffers from a terrible case of ""blah""-ness. 

Another huge problem I had with Prime 3 is the abundantly obvious change in art style. I think Retro Studios wanted to move as far away from Prime 2 as possible, which might explain the new look. A huge mistake! Echoes has some of the best videogame art I've seen to this day. The architecture is fascinating, the enemy designs are EXTREMELY creepy, and the boss fights are massive in scale. It's just awesome. The exception, I will admit, are the dark worlds. They start out bland and never get better - and this is probably the biggest criticism of Prime 2, and I won't lie, it's a valid one.

But it's often overblown. Corruption may not have had a dark world, but it still suffered from a serious case of blandness. The Pirate Homeworld is DRENCHED in pinkish-red, and Norion is so full of gray walls that I still get lost there. Even Skytown, an obvious effort from Retro, just feels kind of samey by the time you're halfway through it. 

Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is a dark game, and easily the darkest in the series. The whole game is just strewn with corpses, darkness, and disturbing lore entries. The key hunting and dark worlds aren't great gameplay mechanics, I agree, but I prefer small instances of frustration to one gigantic forgettable experience, and that's what Corruption was to me."	t5_2rrd6	True

This article has become fairly well known around the web, but I don't see it getting much attention here, if you're up for a long read, it's worth your time. 

""To put it bluntly, Metroid: Other M is a story that consistently portrays an abusive relationship between two of its main characters, and romanticizes it, painting the depicted behavior as justifiable, even laudable.""

So I just replayed it on Hard with 100% collection and my god, this is the difficulty I wish Super Metroid had. 


Also I (at the same time) beat Metroid 1 in its entirety for the first time (I got stuck last time many years ago)


1. Zero mission is about 10 times better than Fusion, seriously, fusion is by far the worst 2d metroid game, the entire thing is about as linear as you can get, they removed chain wall jumping, they removed bomb jumping. And the entire game is narrated to you from a dumb computer. For example in Zero mission I chain bomb jump/walljumped my way to the varia suit before I had high jump or ice beam, and it was not easy. You could never do things like that in fusion. 

2. Zero mission truly is a remake of Metroid 1, I never realized how they literally remade the entire map almost spot for spot from Metroid 1 until I replayed it. I love it.

3. Zero mission's final boss on hard with 100% difficulty is the hardest boss fight in GBA history. No really, mecha Ridley kills you in two hits.
And even if you kill him you still have to escape which is no easy task when you can only take 6 shots from anything before you die.

4. Some of those 100% missile tank challenges are hard as balls, seriously.

When I beat that game it was the happiest I have ever been for beating a videogame, maybe it is because I had 49hp at the end and almost shit myself when the guy jumped out of the ship. But still. Just felt like I had to tell somebody lmao.

Also I laughed my ass off at the end of Metroid 1. Time bomb set, get out fast, wtf."	t5_2rrd6	True

In Metroid Prime, when you're in the Phazon Mines and you're in that one room that suddenly goes dark... Then the glass breaks and all you hear is *SHREAK!* I back the fuck up and run the hell away. It doesn't matter that I have an Ice Beam at my disposal... I know the Metroid's weakness and all, but just being in one's presence makes me quiver. 

In Metroid Prime 2, when you're running through all of those rooms and you run into the corrupted Metroids that were being propagated... I quickly back the fuck out of the room to catch my composure before I can head back into the room... still quivering in my boots like a silly child. 

In Metroid Prime 3, when I'm on Elysia and I have to go through that one room with the many dozens of tanks full of Metroids, I piss myself for every Metroid I walk by, thinking they're going to jump out at me any second. Don't even get me started on that ship with the hundreds of Metroids in a single room (GFS Valhalla?)...

1369401209.0	1eyvio	The Ultimate Metroid Experience? (MP3:Corruption)	Darkblitz9	39	6	23	"I have a plan that I've already set in motion for the (in my opinion) ultimate Metroid experience. You will need a few things though: A Powerful PC, a copy of the game disc, and at least $400 to spare. (It's ridiculous, I know, but remember, this is the *ultimate* Metroid experience.

First, get yourself either the Sony HMZ T1 or the Oculus Rift. The rift is cheaper and better visually but lacks audio and it won't come to you for months. The audio wont' work on the Sony headset though, so the Oculus gains another bonus in that it doesn't block your ears, so you can still wear a headset for audio. Only get the Sony if you absolutely do not want to wait for the Rift.

Then get yourself the Razer Hydra. I would suggest getting a wiimote and a bluetooth adapter but I've tried it and the bluetooth just does not work well off-console. The hydra works as a wiimote and has much higher accuracy with even less latency. It's more expensive but it's better all around (double nun-chuck!) 

Get yourself the Dolphin Emulator and pop your Prime 3 disc into the drive.

What you get: Your vision is completely filled by the game screen, the visor is your visor, you see things exactly like Samus does. No TV, no outside visual distractions, just the visor and what's before it. You move your hydra controller and the target reticle moves across the inside of Samus' ship, turning your vision. You are Samus.

Controls the same as the wii, however your vision is wrapped by the visor, the very edges of which you can see your ammo, health, etc. The headphones putting the sound right to your ears and blocking outside noises. Protip: If you turn off music and leave in sound effects it will be *perfect* immersion

I've tried out a mock-up of this using the Sony HMZ and a Wii mote, it works great, but the HMZ is more like a movie theater than an immersive headset so it did't work too well, and the wii mote latency is just too high with a bluetooth adapter on your computer.

I haven't been able to get my hands on a Rift, and the hydra is apparently on backorder so I am unable to relay the experience just yet.

However, when my hydra does come in, I'll be making a post to let you all know how the hydra works in place of the Wiimote.

I had just escaped the Pirate frigate and watched as a newly revived Ridley escaped. Samus jumped in her ship and the chase began. I watched as the ship descended slowly to the planet's surface as the familiar music began slowly, quietly, to play. Samus emerged from her ship, and that glorious fanfare played. I assumed control of her and realized it was raining. At the time, effects like that were rare in games, so I looked up. The rain was hitting my visor. That moment right there forever solidified me as a fan. Even more than first stepping on Zebes to save the Baby way back in 2000 when I first played Super Metroid.

1357761904.0	169m7k	The Metroid Prime Series	agentalpha	34	8	38	"Okay, so I know that there are a lot of gamers out there that have a hard on for this series. And honestly, I agree that overall it was done really well even if the story has some conflicts with the rest of the series. I missed out on the first two for GameCube and then about a year ago got Prime 3. I loved it and thought it was a great game. A few weeks ago, I borrowed the Trilogy for the Wii and finally got a chance to play the first two. Even though I'm only 20% of the way on the second game, I'm going to go ahead and say that the first Prime is my favorite followed by three and two respectively. My reasoning, you may ask?

Prime 1 felt like the 3D Metroid game I had longed for since childhood. I've been playing the series since the original but I didn't get my hands on it until a couple of years after it was released. I bought Metroid 2 and Super Metroid as soon as they came out and only played Fusion and Zero Mission on emulators because I honestly don't have the money to buy the console and then the games.

There are certain aspects about Prime 3 (weapon/suit upgrades for example) that I liked only slightly more. However, Prime 1 captured more of that feeling of being on your own in a whole new world. The desolation of the world really captured me. The graphics, music, game play, etc. were top notch. It was the best game of the entire series since Super Metroid.

I know there's a lot of people that prefer Prime 2 in the series. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of the light/dark world but some of the extra backtracking is really unnecessary to me. I think it would've been better if it had been done in the style of Zelda: A Link to the Past where you played through one world and then visited the other and then backtracked through the first world for a few items.

Maybe I'll change my mind once I finish the game but as of this point, I'm mildly disappointed and aggravated (separate ammo for the dark/light beams? Why can't that shit be infinite like any other beam in the fucking series?).

Anyways. I just thought I'd share my thoughts/feelings on the Prime series."	t5_2rrd6	True

My own personal list of stand-outs:

- Reaching the Sanctuary Fortress from Metroid Prime 2. If only the whole game was as cool as that place...

- Fighting Thardus from Metroid Prime. One my favorite fights in the series.

- Getting to Green Brinstar in Super Metroid. It feels like the game is truly starting.

- Dodging the SA-X in Fusion. Most tense I've ever felt in a GBA title.

- Opening moments from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. I love to dick around with all the gimmicks in Samus's ship.

- The title screens for the entire Prime series. I don't know why, but I have so much fun navigating the title screens from all three games that I dawdle intentionally just to see the cool gimmicky menus. I haven't seen cooler title screens from any game before or since.

- Shooting birds in the Chozo Ruins in Metroid Prime.

There was a really good [Super Metroid Glitch FAQ](http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588741-super-metroid/faqs/19122) by Brickroad with (cursory) explanations behind a bunch of the game's glitches, but a big fat ""To Be Continued"" in the section for the spazer/plasma glitch which resets your game but lets you keep everything.

I've been patiently waiting since 2002 for the guide to be updated. It seems like plenty has happened in the SM speedrunning scene since then, and there seems to be a pretty in-depth understanding of how the game works.

The Chozo engineered biological weapons, the Metroids, to combat the Parasite-X, but couldn't they have seen their use solely as a weapon? We know they 'used' to have a warrior system, but they claim to have no need for it. Yet, they still build shrines and statues to honor these warriors. They even still have their weapons, evidenced by when one Chozo elder attacks Mother Brain &amp; Ridley in full battle armor. The biggest evidence against their claim of peace is Samus. She is clad in state-of-the-art chozo armor custom fitted for her, pointing out that they definitely still have access to their weapons. Furthermore, they trained Samus in a warrior role since she arrived, with Old Bird taking her to the Chozo god of war's shrine. It seems to me that the Chozo were planning something very sinister, and that the Federation is lucky that Mother Brain's betrayal of the Chozo, causing a mass genocide, has probably saved the galaxy from being conquered by the Chozo.

Alecrein	26	3	12	"I am doing a ""Let's Play: Metroid Series"" since I have never ever given this series a chance (mainly because I didn't like Castlevania that much and through association didn't give it a chance). If you want to follow my progress check it out on [my store's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7tixAbqAotRAF-dGzlUHb5kv4m_WFka8)  Please keep in mind that these are my first let's play videos and they are only going to get better, not worse, I promise. I was originally going to skip Zero Mission as it was only a remake of 1, but all I have heard from people who have played the series is I have to play it so I will be playing it last.

The Order in which I am playing the titles is:

1.) Metroid (NES) - Completed
2.) Metroid II: Return of Samus (GB) - Completed
3.) Super Metroid (SNES) - Completed
4.) Metroid Fusion (GBA) - Completed
5.) Metroid: Other M (Wii) - In Progress
6.) Metroid Prime 
7.) Metroid Prime 2
8.) Metroid Prime 3
9.) Metroid: Zero Mission

Let me know if I have missed anything. I am doing them in this order as I feel the Metroid Prime Trilogy and Other M are only there to fill in chronologically they don't serve any major purpose to the actual plot of the series (I.E. Confrontation with Space Pirates and Extermination of Parasite X, the sole purpose of the Metroids was to get rid of X). 

The only reason I am aware of the plot is because a friend of mine recommended I read the prequel manga before diving into these games. So far I'm kicking myself for never trying these games before. 

Last thing, is there anything I should know going forward? Any games I left out? As a Metroid Fan what piece of wisdom would you bestow upon me?

The Chozo discovered the X-Parasite on SR388 and developed the metroids to exterminate them. When almost finishing the creation of the first Metroids while on Zebes, the Chozo were attacked by the Space Pirates and fled. The fleeing didn't go so well, as at least one Metroid'ed Space Pirate Corpse was discovered on Zebes. However ultimately metroid ended up on SR388, where years later (enough time for Samus to get through the GF Marines in Other M backstory to before her Zero Mission) the federation and then the space pirates discover them and take them BACK to Zebes. Then after the events of Zero Mission, and the Primes (Despite what Sakamoto said &lt;/offtopic&gt;). The GFed decided to remove all Metroids from Existence, and send Samus to SR388. (Metroid 2)

However on SR388 are signs of Chozo civilization, statues containing upgrades and weapons. Whats the origin of this. Do you think it was:

A) Before the discovery / arrival / creation of the X

1348844561.0	10mcxk	"The boss ""Metroid Prime"" got me thinking... (Possible Spoilers)"	Melos555	24	5	30	"Is it... a fully developed, mutated Metroid?  Does it realize that Samus is attempting to exterminate all Metroids? And has it later, after taking Samus Phazon suit, taken her form ""as a parasite"" to mimick her powers, just to later attempt to find new ways of tactically exterminating her due to her threat towards the metroids? Or was it just lucky to grab her suit in the last second?

Related question, did the Phazon make the Metroid Prime look like it does?

Further on, why can't Dark Samus, who is Metroid Prime with Samus Phazon suit, spawn Metroids like she could in Metroid Prime 1?


Honestly, I have many more questions because... well it just struck me, but I feel as if the Metroid Prime story hasn't been analyzed enough. There are so many interesting hidden facts and details that imho, the other games can't compare to. They have really focused in the whole ""Metroid"" being the real monsters here, which I felt was lacking in the other games, despite them being called ""Metroid"". I mean sure, there are metroids in the games, but they are mostly just creeps hanging in around in the atmosphere, one of the more difficult creeps, but not that significant. It's as if they just used the name because it sounded really good. 

However in the Prime games, it feels as if they literally are putting a bigger focus on the whole ""Metroid"" being the real bad guys in the game, considering that Dark Samus, is in fact a Metroid in Samus Phazon suit. 

And remember the fight in Metroid Prime 1? That really left an impact on you, it really showed what the Metroids could become.


And sure, I've played the other games with the Metroid queen and such, but the Metroids there just feel like simple, primitive animals that are simply defending their territory which they have infested. Here they appear to be self-aware, as if they have a predatory goal. They are hungry for preys, and despite them being parasites, they are intelligent enough to adapt after their predators. This gives a really eerie and scary effect considering that a parasite is usually just a primitive creature inside your body, following its instincts. Here it seems as if this parasitical creature is in fact conscious and self-aware. 

The whole thing makes me wonderfully uncomfortable.

And honestly, I've learned more about Metroid lore in the Prime games than any other Metroid game.

But I think that it does belong as a Prime game, and here's why.

**Gorea:** According to Alimbic lore Gorea is a shape-shifter and smashed into Alinos (I think it was Alinos, it's been a long time since I played Metroid Prime: Hunters) via a meteor (no doubt a Phazon carrying Leviathan) and emerged as a vapor that quickly took on a form mimicking the form of the Alimbics.

Gorea demolished nearly the entire Alimbic race, but the last remaining Alimbics managed to seal him in the Oubliette, supposedly for the rest of eternity. Fast forward who knows how many years and Samus Aran and six other bounty hunters receive a mysterious message offering ""Ultimate Power"".

After collecting the eight Octoliths Samus makes it to the Oubliette, along with the other six bounty hunters, Kanden, Spire, Trace, Noxus, Sylux, and Weavel. Gorea is accidentally freed and he drains the six bounty hunters of their weapons and abilities (similar to how Metroid Prime did to the Space Pirates.).

During the fight with Gorea he can switch between the six hunters' weapons and suck Samus' energy via an orange tentacle. Samus shoots six triangular structures on the wall in a certain order whilst defeating Gorea's first form resulting in a battle with Gorea's more powerful, floating second form. This form can only be destroyed by the Omega Cannon, a mysterious and highly radioactive weapon deemed an abomination by the Alimbic Order, and found by Samus. Gorea is defeated, and explodes along with the Oubliette, while Samus Aran and the other six bounty hunters escape.

**The Omega Cannon:** This weapon is highly radioactive (just like Phazon) and is extremely powerful. It is the only thing that can defeat Gorea's final form. Strangely, Samus cannot change weapons once she has acquired this weapon.

**The ""Ultimate Power"":** Gorea was very intelligent, and with all that time to think in the Oubliette he no doubt knew of how tempting the promise of ultimate power would be. He could have been lying but he also probably had accounted for the possibility that whoever freed him could be more powerful than him.

So if this ""Ultimate Power"" really exists it is probably Phazon, and he would offer it to his savior as a peace-treaty to form an alliance.

**The Verdict:** We know that Phazon has a far more powerful form: Red Phazon, which has an orange colouring. Gorea's eye and that sphere thing in his chest are both orange.

We know that Phazon-corrupted creatures can barely be harmed by conventional weapons, but can be overloaded with Phazon. Phazon is also highly radioactive and so is the Omega Cannon. Gorea arrived in a Leviathan yet there is no Phazon on any of the four locations in Metroid Prime: Hunters, but Gorea's orange colouration would suggest an extremely high concentration of Phazon. This could be because Gorea fed upon the Phazon Core of the Leviathan and eventually killed it to achieve ingesting maximum amounts of Phazon to become powerful and accidentally resulting in Phazon not spreading to Alinos and other places.

Gorea's final form can only be killed by the Omega Cannon which suggests that it is indeed a concentrated Phazon weapon used to overload Gorea.

Gorea shows the ability to suck life-energy, this suggests that Gorea is a super mutated metroid, even more mutated than Metroid Prime.

Almibic lore also says Gorea is cancerous, and cancer spreads similar to how Phazon spreads throughout a planet. Perhaps Phazon *did* spread but Gorea consumed all of that.

So there you have it, the Omega Cannon was a super powerful Phazon weapon used to overload Gorea which was a Metroid very mutated by lots of pure Phazon, and bent on possibly galactic domination.

After about 24 hours of playing this game I loved nearly every second of it. Despite the lacking ability to aim up while moving (except lock on) this game was perfectly crafted, but I have 1 gripe but this goes with every single metroid except for Other M. Too much back tracking, I never hated it but I never liked it. In metroid prime the world is so well created I don't mind going back and forth looking at the scenery. 

The bosses were the best part, I'd even say the bosses were as enjoyable as the colossus from shadow of the colossus. 

Chyka was amazing, my fingers were so raped from the boss from swinging on the hooks and shooting it, to just spamming A at everything.

Emperor Ing was pure challenge and fun. It took some time to figure all of it out but once I did the hurt was brought, because it takes some time to figure it's moves out you take a bit of hits, but the hits deal so much damage I was very low on energy throughout the boss fight and that kept me on the edge my seat in amazement. Once it was defeated I had about 1 bar of energy left and when the floor started to fill with gas I thought I was screwed but then retro studios came a long and made it so I can gain some energy back to continue the fight.

After all that was done the world started to explode, classic metroid.... always something exploding you need to escape. Once I left the planet in 30 seconds I wondered ""why did they give 8 minutes"" that very same moment Dark Samus appeared and was creepy as all hell being transparent. Once that was beat and Samus exits the portal of Dark Aether she pull a Shaquille o'neal once she hopped out of the portal as I sat with my jaw dropped in epicness.

Not to mention when samus was heading out of the temple and while heading out the door just waves goodbye while facing the other way, small things like this show a character has true emotions. Metroid is one of the few games I see that has this kind of emotion, and thought put into a game and despite odd controls they can make you feel immersed in the game that's as unrealistic as metroid.

What are your thoughts on the game?"	t5_2rrd6	True

1330907489.0	qhtkz	Super Metroid Rom Hacks	Erare	20	0	9	"After playing through Zero Mission and Fusion for the umpteenth time, I still had the Metroid itch.  Super Metroid beckoned but Planet Zebes only holds so many secrets.  That's when I discovered [Super Metroid Redesign](http://drewseph.zophar.net/).  

Redesign is a rom hack, a highly polished overhaul of the SNES Metroid game 2 years in the making.  With creative use of the old tileset, the author has created an incredible new Metroid adventure aimed towards experienced bounty hunters.  When I say experienced I mean it.  The difficulty has been ramped up several times from the original, and sometimes finding your way forward can be tricky, but it makes it that much more rewarding.  I have to admit, I abused save states quite a bit myself, and even had to use a video guide at one or two points to figure out where to go next.  My first play through was a total of 16 hours with around 75% item collection.  In time I may return for a 100% run.  Some things to note about Redesign are the increased gravity, heavy use of wall jumping, occasional use of double bomb jumping, and some secrets requiring creative use of shinesparking, infinite bomb jumping and other advanced techniques.

After my time with Redesign, I still craved more.  Upon further digging through the Metroid Rom Hack scene, I found what I consider to be an even better rom hack than Redesign.  I present to you: [Metroid Super Zero Mission](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/742/)

This rom hack takes the tileset from the GBA Metroid Zero Mission and overlays it onto the SNES Metroid to great effect.  It feels like a worth sequel to SM, it's easy to forget you are playing a hack.  Instead of gushing, I'll link to [the review](http://metroid-database.com/reviews/mszm.php) (if you plan on playing this please do not read the spoilers) that convinced me to play it.  Things to note about Super Zero Mission is the ridiculous size of the game world (Redesign is also huge), alterations to the firing speed of all the weapons, increased door scrolling speed, changes to the map interface (Mmm QoL changes) and a few new enemies.

Anyone who considers their self to be a Metroid fan should experience these two titles.

A third title I look forward to is [Super Metroid Eris](http://m2k2.taigaforum.com/post/sm_super_metroid_eris.html).  Note it is already completed, however a significant patch is planned for April 2012.  Having not played it yet, I'm going to hold out for the patch.  Eris uses brand new tilesets created by the author, and from what I've read the quality of the hack easily compares to Redesign and Super Zero Mission.

To install these hacks, you will need an [IPS patcher](http://zerosoft.zophar.net/ipswin.php)

You will also need the version of the rom titled Super Metroid (JU) (!)

1329598865.0	pvme2	Am I the only one that Nintendo succeeded to mentally hurt by making Metroid Other M?	Melos555	32	11	67	"Now, this might sound wierd and all. But ever since I was a kid, the Metroid games (Starting from Super Metroid, where samus was first introduced to me) I always appreciated the game for the gameplay, and I also appreciated the fact that it is rare to see a female being so neutrally powerful to other characters. I got this odd, yet interesting look at gaming, and I thought infact that females were portraited like this in Gaming.

Eventually, I noticed that this was not the case. Females have always been some sort of Eyecandy to gaming (Generalizing). But I didn't mind, I already had a game that had a great character, so yeah. But ever since the Zero Suit was introduced, and Metroid Other M, I've felt some part of me slowly rot. It never died, no. It rotted. And it feels as if it is still rotting. Every time I see the Zero Suit, or the Metroid Other M game, I get a huge anxiety. It could depress me for a whole day, leaving me to attempt to convince myself that the character that I once cherished so much, wasn't portraited like this. 

The Zero Suit.. The Metroid Other M game.. It feels as if the Samus that Nintendo once created didn't excist anymore. She just died. The person I played along with on the Gamecube games. The person who loved doing all these interesting scans on creatures because she was interested, and as was I! It was literally feeling as if Samus took me along on a trip, showing me all these pirate logs, all of these creature entries, and all the lore. Once, I would even imagine myself being behind the visor, being on adventures. (I really felt like this during the game)

She felt mature. A grown woman who was interested in science (Well, science in her universe atleast.)

But then, Metroid Other M, and the Zero Suit. They somehow portrayed a weaker Samus. Her body didn't display any sign of training, nor did she have any brawn. She looked like a typical, weak, accessorie woman from any game with a man as the main character. She wasn't all that intrigued in the beautiful stuff she saw. She was more concerned over this one person, who did nothing more but manipulate her. 

This all has mentally fucked me up. It sometimes has lead to me not being able to sleep well, because it feels as if the hope of the character that I had died. (Due to that she was basically a childhood hero to me, and the Metroid games being one of my favourite games. Heck, I even devoted my life to make a project that honors the concept of females being portrayed neutrally in gaming. It was literally a great game. Oh, and it was also the main source of me loving science fiction.


Please reddit.. What should I do for this pain to stop? Am I the only one experiencing this kind of anxiety?





**TL;DR:** Metroid Other M, and Zero Suit samus have caused serious anxiety issues to me, since Metroid used to be my favourite childhood game, and Samus was my childhood hero.

I personally like the space station setting. When playing Fusion, Other M, or the Celestial Archives in Hunters, the space station makes me feel trapped and very claustrophobic. Slightly more limited exploration wise but these feelings also provoke a sense of urgency, at least to me, and just remembering that there is nothing in every direction outside the ship makes my stomach flip like looking down from a very tall place.
A solitary planet on the other hand offers an equally diverse range of environments to explore, the sense of a larger somewhat more open world than a station, and not as much claustrophobia.
As for the elephant in the room, star system exploration was a smart device used to increase the scope of the game area, unfortunately at the loss of some isolation. Hunters pulled this off better than Corruption since the cluster of planets and space stations was devoid (for the most part) of the intelligent life that sculpted it into what it was. Corruption took place in a GF system which was very much still active.

-------------------------------------------------------------
My experience
-Personally, what I enjoyed the most was reading the planetary lore. I personnaly never read any books about the start to the fall of a whole civilisation, so being on a planet like bryyo, elysia or tallon IV and read about it's tragic histories managed to get me really fascinated. Seeing how they started, how they prospered, what made their downfall, how they worked against it and how their civilisation ended. I whould pass half an hour and more only to read them and imagine the whole thing in my head. Even more when I got in the valhalla. I remember imaginating dark samus enter the ship and getting away with the aurora with all the evidences and hints the lore/place game me and recreated it like a crime scene.

-I think it's the importance gauge that I think they should have left off the games. It takes you by the hands/obligated you to scan something just for the % at endgame and told you what was needed to scan/not needed and kinda ruined the fun of scanning just for immertion when I feel it.

1356234692.0	15b7us	Whilst we're on the topic of Metroid V story ideas...	Mr_Pennybags	25	8	12	"There's been a few story ideas on r/Metroid recently, so I thought I'd contribute with a little something of my own.

Similar to *MinusTheFire's* opening, Samus is tracked down and captured by the Galactic Federation, they try to remove the Fusion suit from her so that she can no longer be a danger, and they succeed in removing the majority of it's functions, but the X's integration into both the suit and her own body makes it impossible to completely dispose of, it has become an extension of her that she can summon and control at her will. Samus is imprisoned for her crimes for several months, but after Overhearing that the jettisoned *Secret Lab* has been almost tracked down to a tiny blip of a homing signal, Samus activates the living suit and fights her way out of the Galactic Federation's prison and to her ship so that she can track down and destroy anything that may have survived, or anything that the Federation can use to rebuild their secret projects.

Using the digitalised Adam to help her track the signal, Samus beats the Federation to the crash site. there is little more than a crater, with the destroyed, smouldering remains of the lab at it's heart. Samus touches down and investigates on foot. On board, Samus finds the remains of the Metroid's evolutionary stages, killed in the crash, but no sign of the living Metroids or the SA-X she trapped inside. A wall has been torn apart by the crash and reveals another few rooms of the lab she did not see before, as she had hastily began it's jettison before she had a chance to properly explore, in the room she found a computer terminal, battered, but with enough power for her to extract a series of corrupt files, and next to the terminal, the remains of what seems to be her Power Suit. The suit is not her old one, but an organic version created by the X in it's cloning of the original SA-X, Samus' ability to absorb X parasites harmlessly makes re-integrating the discarded suit into her fusion suit simple, and she is back at her fighting best, just as she was at the end of Super Metroid. 

With her old, fully powered suit back online, Adam can contact her from the ship and download the files she found onto the ship for unscrambling, now Samus can fully explore the planet and dispose of anything she needs to stop the Galactic Federations sick plans...but after only a few steps, she collapses. living inside the discarded suit were Metroid's infected and bred with X-parasites, something deemed impossible by the Galactic Federation, Samus, and her Chozo ancestors, they phaze out of Samus, stripping her of her abilities and escaping onto the planet, Samus is once again at low ability and strength, but at least she has the added armour of her Power suit that she was lacking in her organic, X-parasite Fusion Suit.

&gt;I know that this already sounds like some X-TROID ALL POWERFUL SAMUS CAN'T WIN fan-fic level writing, but stick with it, it does make a little more sense than that.

Adam tells Samus that he has managed to decipher one of the files, it is an audio diary, possibly left by the BSL scientists? They listen, the voice is female, but with a kind of gruffness to it, as if she is dying. The voice gives no introduction, but mentions her attempts to create a blend of mortal enemies, something that should not exist, and something that can be used for more than just weaponry. She seems to be talking about the X-Metroid's that we met earlier, but the X-Parasites were released onto the BSL station as an accident, how could she have been experimenting with them?

&gt;The story behind the audio files is that the SA-X, damaged by Metroids during the Jettison and subsequent explosion of the secret lab looked for a way to prolong it's life, it saw itself as a new stage of evolution for the X-Parasites, one who can think and feel, it has Samus' strong mind and determination, and begins to use parts of itself and different combinations of Metroid cells and larvae to create something that at it's core shouldn't exist, so that the SA-X may absorb them and become something new entirely, part Metroid, art X-Parasite, and part Human. The files track the SA-X through its development process, where it goes wrong, how the months of being alone is driving it's newly formed mind mad. By the time of the crash, the SA-X has shed it's power suit 'shell' and become a new being entirely, it dubs itself with the only name it can think for itself: Samus.

Samus must navigate the planet finding her old abilities, that have warped and shaped the X-Troid's into different forms (making the bosses interesting) whilst discovering the new, small Metroid nest formed after the few Metroid's on board escaped and find whatever the SA-X has become in order to rid the universe of the most deadly weapon of all: Herself.

comment's and suggestions welcome!

EDIT: Here are little mock ups for the X-Metroid and the new SA-X that I designed about a year ago.
The colours for the SA-X were based on the hornoad, to kind of give it a return to its roots. the design is based on a discarded Dark Samus design I found. The purple shell is a kind of organic incubator for the actual half-samus clone inside, modelled on the power suit and designed to be able to protect itself, fueled by X-troids. Samus doesn't realise this until she delivers the final blow, cracking the shell and revealing a dying, animalistic Samus clone inside who dies in her arms.

Obviously, there are going to be spoilers, so please don't read if you don't want to know what happens in the game.  For each time that I save and quit, I will update a new mission log from Samus' perspective, based on what she did and encountered.  I just figured it would be a cool extra thing to do, since I love this trilogy so much.  So, if you choose to read, I hope you enjoy.	t5_2rrd6	True

Firstly, is there any way I can save my game? Is the code when I die the only way? And if so, where do I enter it? If I switch games will I lose my progress? I feel like playing one of my other games but don't want to close Metroid for fear of restarting it completely.

Secondly, I'm finding the part I'm at very difficult.  I'm near the start of the game, just entering Kraid's lair I believe. I just went down the elevator. When I die I spawn there, which is great. But I always start with just 30 energy, and each hit takes about 20. Should I just go up the elevator and harvest a bunch of health from the spiky wall enemies(don't know their names) every single time I die before I do anything? Is there an easier way?"	t5_2rrd6	True

For instance, I always loved the Dark Samus fights, but this one was way easier than the prime 2 fights. Then, when you finally kill the Aurora unit, which isn't too difficult, shit just explodes, Dark Samus comes back and you're thinking ok, round 2 but NO! Dark Samus just explodes, the planet explodes, and game over.

By this I mean there could be special stages within areas of a planet or space station that require finding clues (not like in Other M), or if Samus comes across a group of Space Pirates, instead of killing them all she could leave one alive to use her advanced GF interrogation methods on.

Something else I wouldn't mind seeing in Metroid is currency. I mean Samus' gotta get paid right? She's a ""bounty"" hunter. So maybe even some side missions where she can build up her funds catching small time criminals, and using those funds to upgrade the suit expansions that she finds. Also, she could collect raw materials for said upgrades, which allows for even more exploration.

Edit: Here's the basic plot I was going for:

The story follows the events of Corruption. Samus is asked for assistance in a conflict that involves the GF and Space Pirates, as well as an uprising on a particular planet that both sides claim as their's. Samus flies to the planet to aid the GF Marines and Space Pirates in their fight against the uprising. While there, she runs into the 6 BHs from Hunters, who have joined the conflict for various reasons. Anyway, at some point Samus learns that the rebels were victims of some kind of mind-altering disease. Towards the end of the beginning, Samus gets infected by the virus that spreads the disease, but instead of crazy, she enters a coma. When she wakes up, she finds out the inert phazon in her body prevented the infection from taking full effect. Because of this, they were able to synthesize a cure. Apparently, the disease has already spread to several other systems and Samus is asked to help deliver the cure to important parts of the those systems and bring an end to it, blah blah blah. Throughout the game, the BHs get infected and you to fight them so you can cure them, and then the help you. Of course, Ridley will be infected, so you have to fight at some point.

As far as gameplay goes, I'm bringing back the command visor. Not only will you be able to control your ship, but also command BHs that may be with you at certain points in the game. You can also command any military support, such as Marines and Pirates. Also, there will be flashback episodes that show when Samus first met each BH. There will also be side missions where you get to play as each BH. This will get players used to each BH's gameplay style, which is good because there has to be some killer multiplayer. We'll bring Kraid back. Finally, Samus gets a melee weapon, as do all the other BHs.

1339994447.0	v7l56	After seeing Prometheus, I was rather taken with this idea:	Bespectacled_Gent	17	4	26	"Listen, I know that the idea of a Metroid movie is downright odious to most of us, because it would be forced to shift the focus away from isolation and exploration and onto things like character development and plot (and we know how well that went last time). I'm right there with you, and it'd take some serious directing chops to change my mind. What I will say, though, is that if a movie ever does arise, Charlise Theron should be cast to play Samus. 

I'd never thought too much of Theron as an actress, but after seeing Prometheus today, I'm convinced that she could give the dignity and power to our Miss Aran that few others could. What's important about Samus is that she's not ""cute"" or ""bubbly"", she's a strong woman who has a knack for getting herself into (and out of) tough situations. She's seen, experienced, and survived situations where any normal person would have broken under the strain, and so should be quiet, dignified, and have a serious presence to her. Samus isn't the joking or quipping type, she's serious, somber, and businesslike, and nothing stands in the way of her objectives.

If you haven't seen Prometheus yet, or don't plan on seeing it, let me just say that Theron is able to pull out a performance just like what I'm suggesting. Her character has been sent on a mission, and that's the most important thing to her. She's tough and demanding, but isn't cruel or callous. There's a great scene where Theron makes an unpopular decision in order to protect the crew, where you really get a sense that she understands the idea of ""the greater good"", and doesn't hesitate in protecting those under her care. 

It was a really surprising performance, and if ever a Metroid movie was to work, I think it'd need her involvement.

Plus, she looks the part in a jumpsuit:

Hamlet7768	15	5	5	"In Prime I, it's mentioned in the NA version that Prime got its weapons from the Pirates while they were studying it. This raised the question of how the Pirates got in there without the artifacts, and why Samus can't go in that way. Later versions retconned this to have the Pirates not find Prime, but this still leaves one wondering how Prime got the explicitly mechanical weapons, like the missiles. Here's my theory.

Whatever way the Pirates had to get in, Prime destroyed. Perhaps that's where the debris in the Maintenance Tunnel came from? When Samus learns about the alternate way in, she also just decides it's not worth it. After all, it's probably under very tight guard, she reasons."	t5_2rrd6	True

My first conundrum is Other M. From a purely gameplay perspective, it was actually pretty addicting. I could argue all day about its strengths and weaknesses, but the real problem is the characterization. I don't want to play as Samus ever again if she is the Samus from Other M. It completely went against everything I thought she was, blah blah, you have heard this all before, but what should be done to fix it? Should Nintendo scratch it out as if it never existed? Should there be a short cut scene in the next metroid game explaining that during the events of Other M Samus had an intense case of cramps and period related problems. How can they ever redeem this? Will they just declare that it is not cannon? That would be difficult since they so obviously tried to link it to Super Metroid. 

The second issue is gameplay. Other M brought some interesting ideas to the table with gameplay mechanics, but in my opinion it felt very watered down compared to other titles. Should the next game take a step further in Other M direction as far as gameplay is concerned?

I feel like retro has run the first person perspective through its paces already. I love the prime games. I could rave about them all night, but I'm satisfied with never playing a new exclusively first person metroid game again. I feel like retro created an amazing self contained series from beginning to end. I would feel almost cheated if Nintendo was like ""shit, other M didn't work. Just make another prime game. People love those right?""

I personally want a new direction. I don't want a step backward like an exclusively sidescrolling Metroid or an exclusively first person Metroid. I want another leap in a direction that forces us to experience the metroid universe in a way we haven't before. I want a change that was as shocking as going from super metroid to prime was.

So anyway, has anyone else pondered this? I would love to hear some ideas. 

Tldr: Other M was bad. Should the story be declared cannon or what are some ideas to work with the story in the next game to make the damage less painful. Also what direction would you like the gameplay to go?"	t5_2rrd6	True

Moving up futher we have the triangular Griffin Class Ships, then largest we have the Olympus Class Battleship with the ridiculously long tail fin.  

However in Metroid Prime 3 we have an unnamed class of ship, between the Griffin and Olympus in size with two smaller fins, seen in the centre of the above image.

First, despite what some think, the x parasite can possess/infect just about anything, from a power suit to a security robot, air scrubber, and it would not be a stretch to say the parasite could control a space ship. 

The reason the chozo created the metroid is specifically for the x parasite. They did not take in to the fact that the metroids would starve after the x was eradicated because the foremost goal was to eradicate the x, which had the potential to destroy the galaxy (they could control almost any lifeform, infect weapons technology, and infect robots.) They could also become sentient or semi-sentient when they infected certain things (think SAX). 

I know a lot of you don't like Halo, but serious parallels can be made between the incredible threat of the flood and the x parasite, as well as MB and the mendicant bias. I digress.

The point I thought of while reading the last chozo thread is that if the chozo had the blueprint for the metroid for a long time (it seemed like a recent creation in the manga), then the Chozo Searcher or his descendants could be responsible for the metroid prime. If after the chozo left Elysia, they sought out Phaaze (which they had briefly observed), they could have created metroids to use as a weapon or experiment on the new planet. When the chozo finally found Phaaze, something went horribly wrong, such as the metroids or the radiation killing the chozo, and the metroids made it on to Phaaze. 1000 years of being left alone and under incredible evolutionary pressure from the phazon, the metroids evolved in to a similar but more advanced species: the metroid prime.

That's my theory. Sorry for the novel or if someone else thought of this first."	t5_2rrd6	True

I am one of the rarest of you all... A teenage Metriod fan. From personal experince, it seems that nobody my age likes Metroid. At all. I love the series terriby. Back in maybe 2009, 2010, I found one of the rarest games the metroid franchise has ever made: the Collector's Edition of the Metroid Prime Trilogy, at Gamestop. I thought it looked awesome, so of course I bought it. 2 years later, I've beaten all three games on hypermode with 100% pickups and logbook scans. needless to say, I'm done with the game. Like most teenagers, I need a little extra cash, so, sadly, I've decided to sell my copy of the trilogy, probably on Craigslist. I'd really prefer that it went to a real fan of the series, not just some video game collector. So, would anyone be interested? This is what is going to be with the game when it is sold:

The game itself,
Fancy metal game box with artwork,
the storyline/concept art booklet,
the instruction booklet.

I plan to edit with some pictures soon. If you are interested, please contact me soon. Also, if anyone is good at craigslist, I could definitely use some help.

But what about LEAST favorites? There are always those places where you go ""ugh, now I gotta go through this shit again"". For me, it's probably the Pirate Homeworld.

I know by research that I'm not the only one who theorized this but what if the Samus we played as was actually a clone.  What had me thinking about the possibility was how Samus at the beginning of the game woke up from a lab and proceed to display her abilities to the Scientists.  They could have wanted to see how well she compares to the real Samus before she was let loose.  The game also had a recurring theme of cloning from enemies like Metroids and Ridley to more bizarre examples like Mother Brain.  Perhaps the clone Samus was put in the bottle ship to test how well she performs in simulated situations the real Samus would likely be in.  
Being a clone could also explain why she is emotionally unstable at times since although she has the memories as the real Samus, she doesn't have the hardships and experience to cope with those memories, leaving more mentally vulnerable.  To conclude this post, I would like to speculate that the motive to cloning Samus was to create a super soldier like clone troopers in Star Wars but beefier."	t5_2rrd6	True

Much of what makes the Prime series good can be attributed to successfully transporting Super Metroid to a 3D game.

Super Metroid is also the last Metroid that Gunpei Yokoi had a hand in. Since Super Metroid, Nintendo seems at a loss as to what to do with the franchise, going so far as to hand over the reigns to a Western developer (with very good results), then Team Ninja (with, shall we say, mixed results).

I loved it! Samus controlled amazingly, IMO better than in Super. 

It was linear, but I really like that about it. it was a good and effective break from the formula. i loved the stuff with the computer. it was a good storytelling device without being super in your face about it. It blended very, very well. i loved the concept of ""ok, shit's going down, go fix it"". It had a zelda vibe to it, which i liked.

It got really difficult for me toward the end. After the SA-X chase the difficulty spiked, at least for me. The bosses got way harder, and pathways and hidden stuff became much more difficult to find IMO.

To me, there's no other game deserving of the ""Metroid 4"" title. it was the perfect continuation of the main Metroid series. It was an updated, contemporary (at the time) continuation of classic metroid. It was, in every way, what a sequel to super metroid, should have been.

I'm at a point where I have the X-Ray Scope and want to get all the upgrades, but it'd be pretty tedious to go screen to screen constantly scanning every inch of every wall to get all the upgrades.

While I had heard that certain visual elements had been diminished in the transference to Wii, I am thinking this is more of a problem with my TV, perhaps.

Graphics is not a deal breaker for me, and I often roll my eyes when some of my friends point out shortcomings with minor things like anti aliasing, etc. I've kept myself illiterate to avoid such distractions from my gaming experience, so I'm at a loss here. I remember a much sharper image when I played the GC versions. I took some pics with my phone to show you, but they actually look better than what's on my TV....strangely enough.

1347656832.0	zw9o1	I'v been playing Metroid Fusion for GBA. This is my review so far.	electromonkey222	12	2	8	" First off, I have SO much love for this game and the Metroid series in general. They're all beautifully and uniquely designed, I could go on for hours about how epic Metroid is.

 The graphics in this game were so good, the only way I could conceive of to playing it other than with emulation would be to buy the Nintendo GameCube GameBoy player and experience it on your TV. Thank Goodness Nintendo made that possible(thank you Nintendo).
 In comparison to Mario and Kirby games This game is by far one of the simplest to navigate. Though it's sometimes hard to figure out what the next step in the game is. Like in this one part, you have to break a hole in a crack in the wall inside of a save room, even though I knew instantly that the crack was not normal, It just made me think about how several times while playing I find myself completely stuck in an area for like 10 minutes because I just don't know what to do next and had a hard time combing the level with ball bombs trying to find a trap door or secret elevator. 

  The whole point of the game is to find the little clues within the levels, and they did a really awesome job of making it rewarding and exciting for the player like in every other Metroid game, and I should just stop trying so hard, and just enjoy one of the coolest(if not **the** coolest) Nintendo franchises ever made."	t5_2rrd6	True

Lets start with beams: All of the beams are just reskins. The Dark beam is a purple ice beam, it's slow firing, freezes enemies, and even the arm-cannon models are only marginally different. Next, the Light Beam is a white plasma beam, it burns things and shoots the same as the plasma beam, although the new charge shot is a refreshing change. Last, the annihilator beam is essentially the wave beam--it homes in on enemies, shoots pretty fast, and instead of activation electrical conduits with the thermal visor, it activates certain buttons with the echoes visor. Not to mention that the beam capacity limit makes them underused (although it is a boost in difficulty).

Next, enemy similarities. It's very easy to pick up that many enemies have very similar AIs to those in MP1. For instance, a splinter is really just a beetle. An Ingsmasher is just an Elite Pirate. Kralees are just Zoomers. And Stage 3 of the Emperor Ing is a bit too close to Stage 1 of the Metroid Prime in my opinion.

Finally, they both end in a little scavenger hunt for artifacts and keys that lead to two bosses. 

I'm not saying that Metroid Prime 2 is bad at all, I was just a little weirded out at how similar they were to eachother. You look at MP3 and it's drastically different from the other two. I prefer to look at Metroid Prime 2 much like Super Mario: The Lost Levels, pretty damn similar, but the second is much harder"	t5_2rrd6	True

Love Metroid, hate a lot of new games that make it all too easy, but... I think this kind of feature might be cool in Metroid!

So I know this probably sounds horrible and, you know, a newfangled helpful ""feature"" like this in MY Metroid? NO.

But I thought about it the other day and wondered if this might actually be a good idea for, say, Metroid Prime 4. (if there ever is one, whatever. You get what I mean)

You couldn't just fast-travel to any save station or elevator or whatever ANY time at all. That would make the game way too easy and completely take away the challenge.

I was thinking of something like this:

Like map rooms, recharge stations, save stations, and so on, there would be another room: A ""transporter"" room.
There would only be one or two strategically placed in each major area. The point of this would be to take away the unnecessary back-tracking through long, drawn-out areas you've already gone through a dozen times to get back to a major area with a new objective. OR it could seriously help with finding those last 2 missile expansions you missed before you go fight the final boss or something.

Here's what I have to say while I wait for Fusion and Zero Mission.	randomtroubledmind	8	2	10	"Before I get started, I'm going to say that much of my opinion is reflected in this [video by Extra Credits](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/learning-from-other-m). Please check out this video, as they do a very good job picking apart why Other M fell flat. 

Ok, I finished Other M about a week ago, and Super Metroid about a week and a half before that. I must say that the shock from transitioning directly from such an old game to such a modern game wasn't nearly as bad as the shock of transitioning from such a perfect game to a kinda-shit game. Personally, I thought Super Metroid was almost perfectly executed, all things considered, and it felt to me like Other M was almost an attempt at a 3d re-make of the classic 2d games yet at the same time, add all the complexity of a modern game. This lead the game to fall flat in a 3 major areas. These would be, in no particular order, controls/gameplay, dialog driven story/narrative, and extremely poor use of cutscenes. 

The controls sucked, plain and simple. The half-assed attempts at giving the game a retro-feel really show here. They really shot themselves in the foot when they decided to stick with using only the wii remote with no nunchuck attachment. I think that many of the control difficulties could have been eliminated by using a more suitable control scheme, or providing people another option. Now, I must say they did remarkably well with the controls considering the limitations of just the wii remote, but there was absolutely no point in the game where I said ""Ya, these controls are really beginning to make sense."" Ultimately it felt like controls were tacked on as an afterthought to what was intended to ultimately be a cinematic experience. 

If there's anything that really kills a game for me, it's dialog. Most people praise Half-Life 2 and the 2 episodes afterwords as being some of the best games ever. And while I do still like the games, I find the dialog very stilted and frankly, boring. I'd be willing to bet even some of the hardcore Half Life fans will admit it's dialog heavy at times. Now multiply this by  twenty-eight thousand nine hundred sixty-four and you get Other M. This is covered in depth in the EC video above, so I'll just say long monologues get boring even in written form. And if you have to introduce monologue, do it in a more creative manner. This will also allow us to view other people's perspectives. Remember scanning all the pirate data and chozo lore in MP1 and the other texts found in the prime games? None of this was spoon fed or shoved down our throats, but left for us to enjoy as we wished, and gave the gamer an ultimately better, if not more mysterious, understanding of the plot. This also suited multiple game styles. You could be the type of gamer who rushes through everything without really thinking, just running from objective to objective, while there are players like myself who wont leave a room until everything has been scanned and every wall shot. Small bits of story hear and there is superior in the game medium because it allows the player to use his/her imagination. Gamers, especially those who play games like Metroid, enjoy thinking. Don't take this away through boring monologues that reiterate every point several times. Seriously, most of the longer speeches could have been condensed into something 25% as long and still be more engaging/believable if done right. 

And last... HOLY CUTSCENES, BATMAN! Jesus, the game felt like it was a poorly directed movie with a gameplay element attached. now, from a technical standpoint, I will admit that some of those cut-scenes looked damn good! However, they way they portrayed Samus was a little obnoxious, and in my opinion, borderline offensive. They sure LOVED showing the skin-tight zero-suit as much as they could, complete with the camera doing full body pans (Though, these are the beach-vollyball guys, after all). As a guy who takes some pride in saying I enjoy games where the female protagonist is non-sexualized, this is a MAJOR step back for the series. However, what is equally as bad is the shear number of cut scenes and their overall length. As I mentioned, the game was more like a movie with gameplay thrown in as an afterthought. Now, the amount of dialog might have necessitated such long scenes, but that could have been fixed with better writing and story telling as I detailed previously. And while I didn't mind Samus having emotions, the emotions displayed in the game seem to clash with everything we've already learned. But this had been debated to death two and a half million times and so I'll leave this up to the individual. All I will say is that i don't blame some female gamers for getting upset. 

I really wanted to like the game. i really did. i watched all the videos before release with my mouth hanging open, drool dripping out of the corner, down my chin. However upon release, I simply couldn't get into it. Now, nearly a year and a half later, I forced myself through it and came out feeling like the game never really did anything for me. Super Metroid did so much more with so much less. I'm looking forward to Fusion and Zero mission, two games I have high hopes for. I'm sure I won't be disappointed. 

Again, please watch the video, as it outlines everything much better than I could ever hope to. "	t5_2rrd6	True

I still had most of my touch even after so long, but this time I noticed something in the credits I never had before.

Towards the end of the credits, ""Iwata Satoru"" is credited as the executive producer of the game. I (and probably most of you) know that Satoru Iwata is the current president of Nintendo, and has produced a good number of Nintendo games, such as Kirby Super Star and Earthbound.

So is Satoru Iwata the executive producer of Metroid Fusion, just with a typo swapping his first and last name?

 - Using the circle pad/analog stick for movement, allowing 360 degrees of motion rather than being locked in eight directions like with the d-pad.

 - Lock on system that shows where you are locked (such as with a yellow glow highlighting the enemy). Pressing L or R would change the enemies you are locked on to, and the yellow glow can be disabled. On the gamepad, I could see the right stick being for aiming.

 - Jump with A, shoot with B. Morph ball activated with X, and missiles activated with Y. In morph ball, Y would activate power bomb, B would activate normal bomb, A would activate spring ball. If the spider ball is in game, I could see it being activated with the L button.

 - Pressing L &amp; R at the same time will activate a scan mode or x-ray visor (can be changed on gamepad/bottom screen). L and R would switch between entities to scan, Y would scan, B and X would 

 - D pad would control the camera (up to move closer to yourself, down to zoom out, and left/right to turn the camera). Pressing up/down twice would take the camera back out of your control and back to the game)

1358568781.0	16uyib	Just finished a playthrough of the Trilogy, some thoughts and reflections.	HollowJohn	9	2	25	"Obviously spoilers ahead. I've been a fan of Metroid since Prime 1, which I found lots of fun. A few years later, Echoes blew my mind. I love the mysterious locales of science fiction, and Aether immersed me like no other planet ever had. It was difficult for Corruption to stand up to Echoes, I was initially disappointed until I got to Skytown. That changed my mind. I still wish they'd kept the ability to switch between beams in Corruption, but that was at least balanced by all the interesting new game mechanics and abilities for you and your ship. The ship missile upgrades were pretty pointless though.

I truly enjoy the way Nintendo weaves the action and puzzles in their games. Even though I'm a bigger Zelda fan, Metroid wins the award for most satisfying puzzle sequences with the Morph Ball segments. Particularly in 2 and 3.

Metroid really has filled a niche in the science fiction universe. I find many other sci fis have an air of trying too hard to please, but Metroid's richness is subtle, coaxing you along a pleasant path of immersion. I love this series. I would love to have a daughter who could get into the games, I'd make her a Varia Suit for Halloween and everything.

Fast forward today, I finally decided to play Super Metroid [after playing MP2 and 3 again] via Virtual Console. I was literally praising the game out loud while playing it. I could feel how much impact the game could have had back in the day.

I realized the Metroid Prime series is just an extension of Super Metroid. Just like many other Nintendo classics, the true games are the ones born on the SNES, e.g. the gameplay from Link to the Past to following games. I was playing through Super Metroid just fine thanks to my skill in the MPs. Power bombing the tunnel between Brinstar and Maridia would have taken an average player a long time to figure out, but it's those little puzzles that made me fall in love because they were challenging. The world was easy to explore, although a world map accessible anytime would have been nice. 

Bosses were great for the 2D world. It was satisfying beating the bosses with the new beams. All the beams from MP1 were from Super Metroid. Beam combos started in Super and were translated well. Even the map design is similar. The music too was borrowed from Super Metroid. Blown away by the fact that my favorite tunes like Magmoor Caverns, Tallon Overworld 2, and Torvus Bog were remixes of Super Metroid tracks.

TLDR In all, Super Metroid is excellent and deserved of its praise, but if I were to play a game multiple times, it would be Metroid Prime. It's a well polished game, a 2nd, better, Super Metroid "	t5_2rrd6	True

I know about AM2R, but it does not feel authentic to me as the handheld game, or console ones, and it just does not feel like the Original game to me.
Metroid II: Return of Samus, is my favorite Metroid game followed by Zero Mission. I just always wondered why it has never been remade.
Original Metroid basically has Zero Mission and Super Metroid as remakes.
Metroid Fusion has Other M as a re-imagining.
I have always at least hoped for a re-imagining, and the only hopes for this game to be remade so far has been from an interview with a Retro studios employee.

Its a blatant rip-off of the Metroid formula: side-scroller where you explore a massive underground maze, starting with no equipment, but frequently discovering new gadgets and abilities that allow you to reach new areas. Maybe thats not the best description, but give it a try and you'll know what I mean within 5 minutes of playing it.
 
Anyways, what makes it special is the use of ""2.5D"". The player movement is restricted to a plane, in typical 2D side-scrolling fashion, but the graphics are 3D, and enemies can be found anywhere in the 3D background - meaning you are able to shoot out of plane.  

Anyways, it has components that could add to the sort of ""classic"" Metroid game I'd like to see (on the 3DS?). With all the feelings of isolation, the discovery, the powerups, a simple mission of containing some catastrophe, and the fear of a powerful entity (dark Samus, Samus-X) . But I'd like to see all of this brought to life in a beautiful, side-scrolling, 3D world! 

As I replay SuperMetroid, I can't help but imagine how cool it would be to see the same game in beautiful HD graphics, and shooting monsters out-of-plane.  Just some thoughts!"	t5_2rrd6	True

I feel, that if I played on ""Advanced"", that my aiming would improve more quickly, but that's just my theory. So, any tips on how to control this game are welcome... :)"	t5_2rrd6	True

The entire series; started with Metroid 2 on GB, moved on to Fusion and Prime 1, and continued until I now own all of them, and have occasional playthroughs on most.  (Just finished Fusion again on the 3DS).  Love Super Metroid a ton!

But while I agree with most of you that Other M was...subpar, I still enjoyed it, for what it brought to the Metroid Storyline/universe, and the re-use and 3d versions of ""The Nightmare"" and a Metroid Queen.  However, there is a Metroid game I found to be worse than Other M:  Prime 2 Echoes.  

I hated the ammo system, the final boss was not only painfully diffcult to fight, but you had to play jump rope with it (very lame), waiting in light bubbles for 50% of the game to recharge health was exasperating, and the story seemed trite and pointless.  Why wouldn't Samus just call in for back up or just leave?  The guidance system, too, was painful compared to Prime 1, 3, or Hunters, due to the Dark/Light Worlds.  And Dark Samus was a joke.  
edit:  echo vision was terrible as well!


I've talked with friends who also love the Prime Series, and they, like me, won't even acknowledge Prime 2 as a Prime game.  They support Hunters over Prime 2.  

Am I alone in this, or are some of you in agreement?  Should I go and give Prime 2 another run through, or is it, as in my first two run-throughs, painfully bad?  "	t5_2rrd6	True

Oki05	3	0	0	"Ok so we all know Other M was a crappy game and doesn't have the right to even be included in the Metroid series. But I was wondering do you think it could of been better if it was the first game of the series? I'm going to take 2 parts of the game. I don't think anyone really cares for spoilers since this game is crappy anyway, but the first part of the game is how it excludes the Prime series from the timeline. Quote from Samus ""It was the first joint mission I'd been a part of since becoming a freelance bounty hunter. And, of course, it was the first time since my Federation days that I was following the orders of a commanding officer."" This quote completely throws Prime 3 out the window what with Samus helping the Federation on Norion, destroying the seeds, and leading them through the Pirate Homeworld.   Plus Other M doesn't even fit with Fusion because after the events of Other M and the beginning of Fusion you have Samus helping the Federation again. If the game happened at the beginning of the timeline then it would make sense for this to be her first joint mission and also still helping the Federation in Fusion. Next part is the whole Ridley meltdown scene , in this scene we see Ridley and then we see a distraught Samus who is traumatized to see Ridley. This scene would of worked if the game was at the beginning of the series because then the player could assume that Samus hasn't seen Ridley since her childhood when he and the Space Pirates attacked her home world.

One planet, huge, and uninhabited - Who knows, maybe the Galactic Federation apprehends Samus... And then Sylux shoots down the ship transporting her? I don't care how she gets there, but I want this game to take advantage of the Wii U's disk size. Have huge chunks of the world and minibosses that can be skipped entirely (at the cost of some nifty new upgrades)! I want that feeling of isolation in a hostile world again.

Randomly Generated Adventure mode - If this game is 2D tile based, this would seem to be actually possible. It would not be canon; it would just be a randomly generated world, with difficulty and complexity determined at the start. It would have parameters to ensure it is solvable (in that there are not any platforms too high, or missile doors before you get missiles, etc).

Something of a story - the Metroid games have contained a huge amount of BACK lore, but, honestly, I can describe almost all of the Metroid games in single sentences. Metroid Prime managed to display Samus' emotion and reactions without a single word or facial expression, and Metroid Prime II tried to have a greater narrative. But, fuck extensive cutscenes. If you have them, keep them short. I certainly like Fusion, though.

Either put Metroid's in or drop the name - In Hunters and Fusion, we barely see anything of a Metroid, and Other M only has proper Metroids for about 5 minutes. In Metroid Primes 2 and 3, they're weird-ass mutations and certainly not proper Metroids (neither game even has an ice beam)!

No gimmicks - Seriously! ""Lol dark world!"" ""Lol hyper mode!"" ""Hey it'd be cool if you couldn't move when you switch to first person!"" ""Guys, what if - seriously guys, what if Samus - guys are you listening to me - what if Samus was a - guys listen - what if Samus was in a pinball machine?""

However this time, I wanted to get 100% (which I've never done before) in under three hours, getting the best ending (which I've also never done before).  So I'm running around, I defeat Phantoon and get the Gravity Suit, go past Samus' ship and down to Brinstar (picking up stuff along the way).

I decided to all the way down to the bottom of the first column to pick up the stuff there (where the critters teach you the wall jump).  I jump over the fake floor to pick up the Energy Tank and the Super Missile, and fall through to go wall jump with the critters.  I get to that room and turn back left toward the door when everything below the top bar (with the health, missiles, map) goes completely black.  I hear the critters for a few seconds then nothing but the Brinstar music.  I push buttons and eventually, I think it responds to the Start button, going to a different screen that's like a completely glitched checkerboard, like the Map screen suddenly decided to recreate the opening of the Matrix, but got stuck (sorry I didn't take a picture; I should have).  From there, nothing I could do would change things.  (The music kept playing, though.)

So I decided to reset my SNES (which is a shame because it had been a while since I'd saved), only to discover that the first two files were gone.  The first was the last time I beat the game, and the second was my current play-through, but the third, which was a copy of the second at the beginning of the Ceres Space Station, was still there.  (At least I don't have to sit through the opening cut-scene again.)

I've never had this problem before with the cartridge.  I played it yesterday with no troubles and picked it up today to play some more when this happened.  I wasn't even using any speedrunning tricks, just playing the game fairly normally.  I touched the console and it didn't feel warm (though I've never heard of a SNES overheating).

After I beat Metroid Prime and the credits rolled and everything, I reset the game. When it came back up, it was still having this issue. Pressing the home button and moving the cursor around on that screen resulted in the same issue.

PopeOwned	2	0	0	"Back when Metroid Fusion came out, I couldn't have been more than 10 and I remember playing the ever loving hell out of it. I tried going 100% but when you're young and you have the attention span of Doug from ""Up"", it's not exactly easy to find all the items.

Over time, however, I started losing interest in Nintendo games. Sure, I got the DS and I played the Zelda games when I could but I gradually stayed away from Nintendo. Mainly because the Xbox 360 took up most of my gaming library.

However, my brother had Metroid Prime 1-3. I watched him play it, so I knew the story but I never really latched onto it, as I did with the 2D games. It wasn't until two weeks ago, when my laptop charger died, I picked up my brother's copy of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.

He had sent it over to Florida with my Nintendo Wii and I decided to give it a chance, since I wasn't too fond of the Wii back then. Oh my, I couldn't believed how much I missed out. I understand the game is more linear in comparison to the original two Prime games but still, it got me hooked.

The level design, the art design, the score, the enemies, the bosses, the sheer attention to detail and all of it on a console I barely played! I haven't felt this much satisfied beating a game in a LONG time, especially since the last game I beat was Mass Effect 3.

After beating Corruption (82% item collection), I bought Metroid for the Virtual Console &amp; Metroid Other M. I only bought Other M for the gameplay, I know the story/voice acting is horrendous. My love for Metroid is back and stronger than ever. Unfortunately, most stores here don't sell Gamecube or GBA games, so I'll have to buy them online but it'll be incredibly worth it.

I remembered the game being really creepy with all the dark rooms and the SA-X so I was thinking what if they remade Fusion Metroid Prime style! It would be first person and would be so creepy. It would be like dead-space, Metroid style. Any thoughts on this? Another thought I had was of Phazon X-parasites?	t5_2rrd6	True

1346742691.0	zbq9a	Viable options to play Metroid games on PC?	crlyons	2	0	4	"Over the past few years I have jumped around from one console to the next to play all the exclusives that come with each of them. I have moved to PC gaming for the most part, with just under 200 games on Steam alone, but often find myself craving those exclusives once again.

From Gears of War and Halo for Xbox, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus on PS3, or Metroid and Zelda on the Wii, I can't help but cry on the inside thinking about all the great games I used to play for each of these consoles and how my options are so limited for titles like these now that I have dedicated so much of my paycheck each month to PC.  I just can't afford to buy all 3 consoles and the games I want for each of them.

Which brings me to the title question: Are there any viable options to play the Metroid series on PC? I have found [a browser-based game of the original metroid](http://nintendo8.com/game/395/metroid/) and I know there are some different emulators for SNES to get all that old-school goodness, but does anyone know if there is any possible way to play any of the other metroid games on PC?"	t5_2rrd6	True

1333665783.0	rvd81	Question about Prime 2	justgetmeonhere	2	0	6	"tl;dr A Metroid nerd asks a lot of nerdy science questions.

I was in the mood for going through the Prime trilogy again, and I'm working my way through Prime 2 now. I never really paid it much attention before, but this time I noticed something and it's really bugging me. If you can't help me with it, I hope I can at least spark some discussion.

The scans and logs all indicate that Aether is experiencing vast instability in the form of storms, quakes, etc, which get worse as its planetary energy is drained away. Ignoring the sci-fi-esque nature of the Metroid universe, how does this make any sense?

Let's simplify things and assume that planetary energy refers to the amount of geothermal energy (the scans say it also includes solar and ""bio"" energy, which I'll ignore for now). I am not a geologist, but I do know that earth quakes, volcanic eruptions, and the like are basically the release of all that thermal energy. It's basically the planet's core cooling down. Earth is a geologically dynamic place because its tectonic plates are in constant upheaval and motion, which is fueled by all of the pent-up heat inside the core and mantle. It is also responsible for producing our planet's magnetic field. Contrast this with Mars, whose core has long since cooled, has no magentic field and, as far as we can tell, has little or no tectonic activity.

All of that in mind, if one were to drain Aether's planetary energy away, wouldn't this cause quakes and other geologically violent phenomena to cease? Wouldn't that do fuck-all about the transdimensional stuff that's tearing Aether apart?

Bonus questions: Aether and Dark Aether are actually the same planet, but due to the transdimensional rift they have their atoms neatly split between one another. I'm going to assume that the destruction of Dark Aether doesn't cause all of that mass to disappear, but what does that mean? Does all that matter get pulled out of Dark Aether and back into Aether? Wouldn't that bring all the noxious gases along with it? All the monsters would die due to exposure to sunlight, but surely Dark Aether's corrosive atmosphere would linger for a while. Also, this would double Aether's atmosphere, and consequently the atmospheric pressure, near instantly. What would a sudden pressure increase like that do to the Luminoth and other wild life?"	t5_2rrd6	True

I'm pretty sure the last time Nintendo mentioned or did anything involving Metroid was when they made Other M. Also, they didn't even have anything for Metroid's 25th! Here's what I think we should do: we, and as many fans as we can gather, should all contact Nintendo and tell them that we want more Metroid games (including a Prime 4 because the 100% ending to Corruption is a cliff-hanger) and that Nintendo should focus more on Metroid. Perhaps then Nintendo would give more attention to the wonderfull series known as Metroid. Thanks for reading.	t5_2rrd6	True

Instead of continuing where Other M and Fusion are leading, why not make an Other M-esque game of Samus's time in the Federation Military? You get a small snippit of her fighting in the military in Other M, but unless I'm mistaken, you never get to hear what ""certain incident"" makes her leave and snub Adam. I think the whole storyline with Adam and Samus is great. After playing Other M, I immediately went and replayed Fusion with Adam's voice as the computer's. It makes the game make that much more sense. EDIT: -Anyway, think of a game with team fighting instead of solo (Think Prime 3 or Other M style - basically bodyguarding).- For each mission, Adam authorizes a set of your weapons, and you have to complete the mission with your limited arsenal.

Not sure if people here know about this yet, but metroid speedrunner [garrison](http://twitch.tv/garrison_tt) will be attempting a world record run of Super Metroid in front of 30,000 or so viewers for the [2013 Awesome Games Done Quick Marathon](http://speeddemosarchive.com/marathon), a charity speedrunning marathon to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.  The games have been pretty amazing to watch so far, and garrison holds the current world record for the game as of a few weeks ago, so it should be a good show.

Loads of things pissed me off about it. Ridley. They over dramatized the meeting with ridley and messed the whole thing up making for an anti climactic battle. he didn't even look like Ridley! Samus wouldn't shut up and the rest of the characters were fucking idiots. The game felt like it had some Metroid in it but over-all it ended up feeling like a completely different game with Metroid slapped on to make it marketable, like [Godzilla 1998](http://images.wikia.com/godzilla/images/f/fa/GINO2.jpg) or [Stairfax: Temperatures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LPQ6nT4UpA) or even [Banjo &amp; fucking lego cars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l69BP1uhlMs)...

Point is, while we don't have to like, or even acknowledge the voice acting all that shit happened (maybe minus a couple forgettable faces... and fucking monologues... or anything that happens aside from the general plot). Now given that... 

What do you guys think of a remake? Well, not exactly a remake since I don't really count other M as a Metroid title (I acknowledge what happened plot wise, but to me the game hasn't happened yet. They didn't make Other M yet) but how bout they make a game that is Metroid Other M? A true ""Other M"".

Zero mission had a hint system that you in most cases couldn't avoid that said where the next item were.

So my question is which hint system did you like the best? And do you want a hint system in the next metroid game?

I remember getting a silver Gamecube with Metroid Prime and a bonus disc for the second Prime game that wasn't out yet. It was my first real FPS game and at first I disliked it. I didn't have a memory card at the time so I just continuously blasted the Parasite Queen over and over again. After I finished off the Metroid Prime I was hooked. I managed to get my hands on every Metroid game except for Super Metroid and Metroid Prime Pinball. I played the Gameboy games specifically many times over. After watching this year's E3, I was very disappointed. I felt like Nintendo had abandoned Metroid after the bad reviews of Other M. After sulking around and cursing my copy of Donkey Kong Country Returns, I got an idea. I ran out to Walmart and got myself an Xbox360 Wired controller for my PC and I downloaded an SNES emulator along-side a Super Metroid ROM. for the past 3 days I have been playing this beautiful game and just minutes ago I finished it. Here are a few of my thoughts:

-After playing the Gameboy titles so much, the jump physics felt a little bit weird but I got used to them.

-I love the depth of gameplay! In my playthrough I mastered the wall-jump, bomb-jump, shinespark, and mid-air morph ball SNES style. I really felt like I was becoming more formidable while slowly learning and becoming adept at these ""secret"" moves along-side Samus herself becoming more powerful with upgrades.

-Being able to disable upgrades is AWESOME

-Hearing the themes from Torvus Bog and Magmoor Caverns in 16-bit was worth the 50 bucks for the controller alone.

-I personally think the x-ray scope is awesome! Why all the hate?

-Getting Super Missiles and Power Bombs early on was different, but I think it added a bit more strategy in the game which was very welcome!

-I almost became stuck right after getting the Wave Beam but with a quick little bit of research I was able to try a Crystal Flash with exactly 11 power bombs left! Awesome feeling to be so trapped but for there to still be an obscure escape!

-2D Grapple Beam FTW

-I got stuck on ""noob bridge"" :( but after figuring out there was a sprint button I used it and loved sprinting the whole game!

-2D Charge Beam combos! Very cool!

-And finally, fuck sand.

1369738169.0	1f6xvu	So after a couple of years of putting it off I finally bought it... [Trilogy]	OrsenPike	1	1	3	"So I have owned a Wii for many years and a GC before that which is where I first played the first Prime game and was blown away by it. It was without doubt the best FPS I had played in years. CoD, Halo, nothing else compared to it in my opinion. 

Anyway fast forward almost 10 years and I still have my Wii but due to a pretty crazy life the past few years I never got the chance to play the second and third Prime games on the GC and Wii. 

Which leads up to last week and me getting a new job which will mean I have much more time for myself and my family as well as a little bit more cash to buy some things for myself :) So what did I buy first? Well Metroid Prime Trilogy of course! I was going to pick up a second hand copy from eBay but decided to treat myself to a lovely new copy. Cost me £40 so a little expensive for such an old game but as it isn't easy to get hold of and the fact it is actually 3 full games I don't mind. 

Anyway it arrived this morning and it is glorious. My Zelda games have always been my pride and joy to own but I seriously think the Trilogy might now be my favourite. Everything about these games is just perfection. I am so happy I finally got around to buying the Trilogy.

So yeah that is my Tuesday morning Metroid post. Sorry if this is boring to others and I know it is a sort of repost as many, many people will have posted the same thing over and over but I was so excited when the postman arrived this morning I had to post about it :)
