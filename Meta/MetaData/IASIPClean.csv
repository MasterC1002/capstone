Especially in a tv subreddit, this is a feature I think we should have enabled.

For those of you on the west coast, you will probably have to join us an hour late, but we will keep your seat warm. I will be sure to mark the thread with a big SPOILER tag, but yous guys shouldn't come in if you are waiting for your personal DVR showing. If you start your own thread, please be respectful and don't put spoilers in the title. Otherwise we will pop a quick SHHH on you.
