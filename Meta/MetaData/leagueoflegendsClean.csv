**08:28** yellowpete wakes up. He cleans the house, does the laundry, and prepares breakfast for everyone in the house, except Froggen, who is streaming for 39 consecutive hours and hasn’t eaten since then.


**08:44** Snoopeh wakes up. He goes to the bathroom, and starts staring at the mirror.


**09:15**  Chauster opens his AMA and starts answering the 34 428th page of questions. He answers “*both l0l*” to the question “*Tits or ass ?*”.


**10:04** After a 71st consecutive victory with Lee Sin, Froggen decides he wants to drink some milk. He opens the fridge only to find an empty bottle that Krepo left intentionally here with a note saying “*You can’t milk those*”.  Froggen is pissed and proceeds to DDOS ocelote because of that.


**11:18** Doublelift has to go to the bathroom, but doesn’t know if anyone is in here or not. He decides to facecheck it and finds Snoopeh, still staring at the mirror.


**11:41** yellowpete starts preparing lunch for everyone in the house. He realizes there’s nothing in CLG.eu’s fridge and checks if there’s something left in CLG.na’s. There is only a partially eaten piece of blue cheese with a note from Krepo saying “*Well that tasted purple*”.


**12:22** HotshotGG is late. He was supposed to wake up three hours ago. He announces his team he will proceed to a rooster change.


**13:16** Wickd and Chauster are bored and decide to start playing chess together.


**14:19** Mirror breaking sounds are heard in the house. Snoopeh leaves the bathroom.


**15:02** HotshotGG enters Voyboy’s room and tells him he is no longer benched. He will go support, while Doublelift will go jungle, Chauster top, Hotshot ad carry, and bigfatlp will stay mid.


**15:08** HotshotGG comes back in Voyboy’s room, and tells him he changed his mind. Voyboy is benched again.


**15:48** Doublelift receives a text from bigfatlp. It says “*Don’t forget we got le scrimz vs CLG.eu in 4 hours. Tell all da peepz in da houz l0l h4h4h4*”


**16:16** yellowpete enters Froggen’s room to see if he needs anything. He finds him blindfolded and in his underwear, practicing his new “*Lee-sin dance*”.


**17:30** After 4 hours without any piece captured by any player, Chauster decides to resign in his chess game against Wickd. He will later state that he was unlucky to get black side, since he only had strategies for white side.


**18:14** While playing soloqueue, HotshotGG rages that his Graves keeps getting stomped by enemy Kha’Zix.


**18:16** Beginning of the CLG.eu daily team meeting. Today’s theme is “*Early-game aggression*”.


**18:21** End of the CLG.eu daily team meeting.

 

**18:23** HotshotGG realizes he was playing Starcraft 2 the whole time.


**20:00** CLG.eu and CLG.na start their scrim together. CLG.na ban Anivia and Lee Sin. Froggen cries and proceeds to DDOS ocelote.


**20:08** Wickd takes the first tower of the game after only three minutes. He has no opponent top since Voyboy is benched and Locodoco hasn’t joined CLG.na yet.


**20:43** Despite playing 5v4, CLG.eu decides to play cautiously and wait for the very late game. After 40 minutes, the score is 8 – 7 for CLG.eu. Froggen’s Karthus has 722 cs, Krepo’s Leona has 7 kills, and Hotshot’s Mundo just bought his fifth Doran’s shield.


**20:51** HotshotGG decides his team needs a roster change, in the middle of the game. He changes places with Chauster.


**21:12** CLG.eu gets first inhibitor of the game.


**21:54** CLG.eu gets second inhibitor of the game. Actually it’s the same as the first one, which respawned 40 minutes ago.


**23:09** Superminions now one-shot any champion.


**23:30** The game is interrupted by a crash of NA servers. Every player goes on reddit and starts an AMA, except yellowpete who has some dishes left to wash, and Froggen, who went out in the rain, in order to improve his juking skills by dodging raindrops.

As the game starts, Players are unable to move or take any action besides buying items for 10 seconds. I believe this can aid so many players who have slow computers and it removes the 'who buys items faster gets to this point on the map faster' aspect of the start of the game. There is next to no lost and so much to gain by doing this. Riot please consider.

EDIT 1: Also you get to discuss whether to invade or to not. Plus lane-switching and strats like that that you normally won't have the time to discuss in champion select.

1355097226.0	14kn0k	I don't want to receive honor anymore.	Damiascus	9197	6571	1585	"Before reading this, I just want to clarify that this post is not an attack on the honor system of League of Legends; it is more of a personal statement...

My client crashed midway through a game two days ago, and I was feeling pretty tired, so I logged off and went to sleep.  After relogging today, I noticed that I had received an honor from that game, the ""honorable opponent"" one, to be exact.  I originally thought someone DDOS'd it, but the fact that I received honor from it was weird to me.  I couldn't really remember what that game was about, since it was so short, but luckily, I had the recording of it on my LolReplay, despite it not showing up on my match history.

I played Nocturne jungle for that game, like I usually do, more recently now because of the new skin, and I had a pretty standard build for about 15 minutes, which was a madred's razor, some boots, a vamp scepter and a few health pots up until the point that my client crashed.

Upon re-watching it, I realized off the bat that something was...off about that game. The enemy jungler never connected. In the loading screen, his/her name never appeared. ""Typical"" I thought. ""The name is probably in another language.""  But after the screen loaded, I saw that he simply had no name. Stranger yet, he was also a Nocturne player.  From the beginning, he sat still in his base.

I might as well describe to you what happened during the game.  We started out normally, and I jungled and ganked, but no one died for the first 15 minutes or so.  Everyone was reasonably leveled and farmed, with every player being in the 6-10 level range, save for the enemy Nocturne. It was at 15:13 when I used my ultimate to get what seemed to be an assured kill on the enemy Soraka.  This is when the game crashed...or when I thought it crashed.  My recorder thought otherwise.

In the replay, the screen glitched for about 10 seconds after I ulted her, with everything freezing in place. When I was actually playing the game, it was during this glitch that my client froze and closed on me. But in the replay, after the glitch, it showed us all still playing...this REALLY freaked me out, but I kept watching. Apparently, my ""character"" secured the kill on the Soraka, recalled and continued to jungle. That's when I read the eerie message... ""...has reconnected."" The no name jungler on the other team got back into the game somehow and started to jungle.  I felt uneasy watching him.

The other lanes kept at each other, and it didn't take me long to figure out the next oddity.  The Soraka ""I"" had killed never respawned. When I pressed tab to see the death timer, there was none...she just stayed dead. ""An ally has been slain."" This time someone on my team died, the Ezreal, and it was the enemy Nocturne who killed him. He never respawned either. I froze in my chair, watching people die, one by one, each death leaving a lasting impression on me.

The Nocturne that I was ""supposedly"" playing did everything I would have done, which weirded me out even further. It was almost like I was still playing in that match.  After each player died, none would respawn.  I was always on edge whenever I saw my character getting low on health, to the point that I was gripping my desk.  I can't really explain why, but it's a nerve-racking feeling knowing that if your character died, they wouldn't come back... I kept telling myself it was a glitch, but after what happened next, I found it hard to.

There were only 3 people left. Me, the no name Nocturne, and the enemy mid laner, a Diana. At this point, my eyes were glued to the screen, and I couldn't help but watch as my character pursued her. This was the death that disturbed me the most. My character ulted towards her, as I normally would have done, and met her at her wraith camp. Just as my character got there, I saw the enemy Nocturne standing still in the passage to their red buff...he just stood there and watched my Nocturne destroy the enemy Diana.

After her death, everything was still.

The minions didn't move, the projectiles were frozen in place, along with my character. Everything was frozen except the no name jungler. He moved towards me and paused for a second. The timer in the recording was still going. Curious as to why he just stood there, I checked my settings on the recording. The chat box was unchecked. I remember my fingers shaking a bit as I clicked to check it.

The no name jungler had been typing throughout the entire match after the apparent crash. All he said, over and over, every single minute was, ""KILL THEM ALL. KILL THEM ALL."" Up until I had killed Diana. I felt my heart sink when I read those words, decorated across my screen. What he said soon after was what sent chills throughout my entire body.

""Thank you for your assistance.""

And that's when the game ended. No nexus was destroyed, no surrender vote was cast. It just ended. Horrified at what I just witnessed, I immediately took down the names of everyone in that game. After a bit of searching, I found that none of them played another game after that one. I'm still checking every few minutes, hoping that one of them will get in a game soon.  I don't really know what happened to those people, and I don't think I want to know...

I have since deleted the recording from my computer.  I don't want anything to do with that replay...

The image of seeing the ""honorable opponent"" message on my screen from logging in is still burned in my head...never have I felt so undeserving."	t5_2rfxx	True

1353938906.0	13t947	[Idea] Tier 1 and Tier 2 Runes Should Be Removed	DevouringRain	5175	2749	729	"The reason for this is because, why not allow the lower players to just expand their champion pool instead of being pigeon-holed to buy new runes for an advantage for the game where they'll be replacing those runes sometime after level 20 anyway.

It's not like newer players jungle often below 20, and we don't even have all the rune slots unlocked so that makes it even more difficult with the tier 1 and tier 2 runes. I think it's just better to remove them.

Edit: Whew came back, and top of /r/LoL? Nice! I have to admit, a lot of you present a valid point in defense of Tier 1 runes, but I still dislike the idea of having them in my in rune page and having potentially unspent IP. (Even though it's not a lot, something should be done, at least have the option of selling them).

Final Edit: For those of you saying I could just save and wait for level 20 to buy Tier 3, I could do that, but having runes gives an advantage over the player without it. Do you know how bad that makes me feel? :("	t5_2rfxx	True

My only intention was really to show some tips for my ~50viewers I had that day. I am not an experienced steamer yet and also english is not my native language so I am sorry if some people felt like I was just trying to stomp bronze players and ""brag"" about it. I just uploaded the video because I was just like well 40-0 sounds fun. Didn't have much other intentions.
So I am sorry if I made some people feel bad but I just tried to be informative for people that want to learn about LoL.

1360666852.0	18dekb	How Riot and ESL are not paying tournament prizes.	snip3y	6992	4739	769	"I'll try to be as short as possible, but I don't think it's gonna be possible.    

I'm Snipey and I belong to Team Synthesis, we aren't a pro team, but good enough to place at the top of some smaller tournaments.    

We've been playing go4lols and as everyone knows Riot sponsors tournaments with RP prizes. Normally what you get is 5€ in RP for 4th place, 10€ for 3rd, 15€ for 2nd and 20€ for 1st, the same system applies to the stuff I'll be talking about.    

Our achievements:

* 3rd place at go4lol #119
* 1st place at go4lol #122
* 1st place at go4lol #123
* 2nd place at go4lol monthly finals december
* 4th place at Slap.dk Roccat Challenge
* 2nd place at eSportsHeaven Roccat Challenge


A grand total of 85€ in RP (PER MEMBER!), resulting in 15 100-15 750 RP (depending if you include the RP bonuses or not).    

Not to mention ESL owes us 500€ (for the team) in cash money for 1st places at go4lols (200€+300€, they upped the prize with the start of the new year).    

The sad part is we're not the only one, anyone I ask if they've gotten their prizes say no. For example our friends, Playing Ducks should've gotten 80€ (per member) in RP (trying to be short so I won't state every tournament here) and 500€ in cash money for winning monthly finals in December. This is just two teams we're talking about and the total amount is close to 2k €, this is more than most people earn in 1 or maybe even 2 months.    

My rough estimate is that this goes back up to 6 months, I could be way off. So for anyone who is going to say that we should be patient and wait couple of weeks to get our prizes is wrong, it's been over 2 months from our first tournament and we still haven't gotten anything. EDIT: Many say we should wait 3-4 months, but others say that it's been over 7 and they still didn't get it. Patience doesn't pay off if we just sit and do nothing.    

I've reopened ESL support ticket 6 times and only got 3 answers (+2 tickets for cash prize), nothing definite, they sent me to Riot support, who then sent me to ""tournaments@riotgames.com"", I've sent 2 emails there and got no answer, went back to Riot support who told me they have nothing to do with this and that I should talk to ESL (that was the second time I was talking to Riot), then ESL told me that we should wait a couple of weeks to get our prizes and nothing has happened for over 3 weeks again. There were 5 questions and 5 replies from Riot to support tickets, but the problem is it was coming from different people. ESL and Riot were just trying to get rid of me and tell me to go to the other guy, they had a ping pong match and I was the ball.    

I don't know who is incompetent here ESL or Riot, but to me it seems that no one gives a s***. We demand what we have earned and we won't stop until we get it!    

**tl;dr ESL owes 1k € in cash money and Riot owes a bit under 1k € in RP to players of just two teams.**

EDIT: Thank you all for your support and upvotes, hope someone from Riot/ESL will see this and take a look into it.
EDIT: Oh yeah, forgot to put in the Triumphant Ryze skin for the 1st place as well.
EDIT: I can't even count the amount of posts from people who are saying that they have the same problem! DO SOMETHING!

EDIT: For the ones who are saying that ESL hasn't posted the results to Riot, that's not an excuses, as I've said I've opened several support tickets to Riot, proving that we've won prizes for these tournaments and as I've said the e-mail hasn't been answered (that's where support first sent me to) and after I asked support what's happening again, they've told me to go back to ESL, eventho they could clearly see which team and which players are supposed to get the RP. Riot is ignoring us too.

EDIT: Offical statement from ESL, they said they will fix any problems by the end of the February! Source: http://www.esl.eu/eu/news/214853/

EDIT: Playing Ducks already got their cash, we still haven't, but we're pretty sure it has something to do with banking system in our country, we think we'll get it tomorrow morning.

EDIT: We got 200€ for one of go4lols, still waiting for another 300 and RP. If anyone thinks ESL owes them money they should arrange that here: http://www.esl.eu/eu/prizemoney"	t5_2rfxx	True

**6:00 pm:** Opening ceremony was supposed to start half an hour ago. On the stream the message “*Event will start soon, stay tuned !*” can be read, on a post-dubstep song which runs in a loop. 

**8:17 pm:** First game of group A between Azubu Blaze and Team Dynamic is about to start. The two hours delay was due to the stage layout: the players’ booths were facing directly to the big screen, which enabled players to see the minimap. Every player on stage is therefore obliged to wear a sombrero for the entire event. 

**8:22 pm:** On the other stage, first game of group B between CLG EU and CLG NA. During the presentation of the teams, the camera is stuck on Snoopeh, staring. It appears that the cameraman is petrified and can’t move. Another cameraman is hired to replace the petrified one. The new one wears a qss to prevent this kind of incident. 

**9:33 pm:** Team FeaR vs IceLanD : After an impressive 1v5 pentakill with Draven, aphromoo says “I’m out”, rises from his chair and leaves the venue. Team FeaR ends up losing the game 4v5. 

**11:01 pm:** CLG.na vs IceLanD : CLG.na gets their first blue side in a competition since may 2011. Both Chauster and Hotshotgg cry out of joy, Doublelift is very satisfied as well. Bigfatlp also has da joyz, and locodoco…well…let’s just say he’s happy too. 

**2:46 am:** CLG.eu vs Team FeaR : After a good teamfight from CLG.eu, Krepo gets a pentasteals. In an attempt to sound like a Korean caster, Phreak screams “PENTAKIRRRRR PENTAKIRRRRR PENTAKIRRRR”, but nobody reacts because, you know, it's 3 am and the game has been going on for two and a half hours. 

____


**DAY 2**


**11:00 am:** Due to VISA issues, team Blackbean is not able to compete and has to be replaced. The IPL staff decides to fill the slot with a local team. A card-dealer from a nearby casino is therefore hired, as well as two strippers, the guy in the audience who owns the sign “Team Solosquid”, and a dog named “Doomy.” Team RSBS (*Reddit, Strippers and Booze and Squid*) is created and is ready to face TPA. 

**12:08 pm:** TSM vs Crs.eu : 2 minutes into the game, Dyrus who did a nice leash for his jungler, comes a little late to his lane and is 2 cs behind. Meanwhile on Reddit, top post of frontpage is “It seems like Dyrus always loses in cs, he’s just trash and NA teams just come for the show”. 

**12:14 pm:** Team RSBS vs TPA : To everyone’s surprise, first blood gets drawn by Team RSBS who runs an amazing Nasus support bot. Phreak says : “Well this play was enabled by Mistake’s mistake” and bursts out laughing. 

**12:17 pm:** TSM vs Crs.eu : Dyrus gets first blood. Top post of Reddit is now “*TSM looking so strong right now, Season 3 World Championship will be a race for second place for the other teams.*” 

**2:24 pm:** Crs.na vs Moscow 5 : The match is delayed because there is a problem with the chairs in Crs.na's booth. The IPL staff decides to replace them, and provides a bench for Crs.na to sit on and play. 

**2:29 pm:** TSM vs Meat Playground : 15 minutes into the game, Xpecial pauses the game in order to make a vlog about how the game is going so far. 

**4:46 pm:** The second round of the losers bracket just began. The teams who won their match in the first round of the loser bracket will face the teams who lost their first round of the winner bracket. The teams who lost in the first round of the losers bracket will go into the second round of the loser’s losers bracket, where they will face the winner of the first round of the winners bracket and the loser of the second round of the blue bracket, which is the bracket of the losers of 2nd, 3rd and 4th round of the winners bracket as well as the winners of the red bracket. Both winners of the winners bracket and winner’s losers purple bracket (which is also called ""pink bracket"") will face each other in a whole new bracket, called “The whole new bracket”. At the end of the competition, a lottery will determine which Asian team will win the event. 

**5:02 pm:** Crs.na vs Crs.eu : 15 minutes into the game, Crs.na starts the ""baron dance"", where they all hang out around baron, waiting for a team fight to occur.

**5:04 pm:** Crs.na vs Crs.eu : Crs.eu pushes down the nexus, while Crs.na is still dancing at baron.

**5:56 pm:** While practicing his Lee Sin dance, Froggen performs a Dragon’s rage kick in a power outlet and shuts down the internet for the entire venue, as well as ocelote's computer, who happened to be streaming at that time. 

**6:05 pm:** Reddit post named ""*Stream is down ?????*"" breaks the record in the most viewed post of all time on Reddit, surpassing Barack Obama's AMA.

**6:25 pm:** ""*Stream is down ????*"" is now the single most viewed thing in the entire world, surpassing Justin Bieber's video clip and The Bible. Check mate, Christians.

______

**DAY 3** 


**4:05 pm:** The stream finally goes back to live with Riot employees doing the traditionnal distribution of gifts to the live audience : ""*It's K*"" orange stress ball, Teemo's hat, Soraka’s bananas and Trundle pillar sex toys.

**6:16 pm:** TSM vs WE : Stream offers a listen-in of TSM voice-chat during team select. 

-TheOddOne : *They’re gonna pick that yordle scum Rumble top.*

-Dyrus :*…*

-Reginald : *Bro dude, listen, bro, dude. Bro ? Dude !*

WE first picks Rumble. 

-TheOddOne : *See I told ya ! THE GOD ONE ! I KNEW IT ! OH MY GOD. NO ONE CAN FOOL THE GENERAL ! Good guy Oddone. Knows what enemy team will pick.*
 
-Regniald : *Bro !*

-Chaox : *We should go Darius. Then I’ll go Varus bot because two teams have won with him and it seems to be the new meta. Do you think you can go Darius against Rumble, Dyrus ?* 

-Dyrus : *…*

-Reginald : *Bro ?*

-Dyrus :*…*

-Chaox : *What the fuck dude ?*

-Xpecial : *He doesn’t want to talk cause he’s afraid he’ll leak our strategy.*

-Reginald : *Dude, listen, bro.*

**7 :38 pm:** Between two matches, CLG.eu are among the crowd, signing autographs. While yellowpete is busy taking photos with a cute girl, Deman passes by him and says loudly “*Hit on that damn girl for god sake man !*”. Startled by this speech, yellowpete gently asks “*I’m sorry what ?*”, to which Deman answers “*I’m just saying you should get her number off the back of that one.*”

_________

**DAY 4 :**
 
**5:38 pm:** TSM vs Azubu Blaze: During picks and bans, Reginald bans **T**witch, **S**ona and **M**aokai (spelling TSM) and the crowd goes wild. Captain Jack is not impressed and proceeds to ban **A**listar, **Z**ilean, **U**rgot, **B**litzcrank, **U**dyr, **B**rand, **L**eona, **A**hri, **Z**yra and **E**zreal.

**6:39 pm:** The cosplay contest is won by TPA Stanley for his cosplay of Tibbers.

**7:14 pm:** The awkward interview contest is won by Fnatic sOAz for his interpretation of French Renekton.

**7:19 pm:** The hairstyle contest is won by TPA Toyz, because he’s worth it.

**8:21 pm:** The MVDP (Most Valuable Dog Player) award goes to Doomy, from Team RSBS.

**11:22 pm:** End of IPL5. This text is entirely spoiler free, so I won’t tell you who the winner is. But the result is quite surprising and the winner was a big underDOG, if you know what I mean…

I'm going to touch it up and get a higher rez/wallpaper size up when I can. Until then, hope you like!

http://i.imgur.com/lXMm45i.jpg

UPDATE! 

Working on cleaning this thing up, getting it to a higher rez-worthy state. Here's the progress on the Diana side. I'm using a bit of reference this time around. As you can see, It's nothing magic. I'm painting the whole face then just moving it so half is off camera. 

http://i.imgur.com/MKIjYCJ.jpg?1

My process, at least here, because it's such a simple image, is paint the whole face, but polish one side more. When it's in a good state, I cut off the other half, take the existing layer from the worked-up half, and flip it. I then merge the layers down so that the whole face is updated. It's a real half-assed symmetry system. Photoshop doesn't really have active symmetry, like a program like Sketchbook Pro, so I do the hackish version :P


What's even more hackish is the color! The color will come after I finish rendering in black and white. I then do a solid layer of (in Diana's case, blue) color and throw that on as a Pin Light layer which makes it look neat and washed out. 


Sooo yeah! Totally not magic. This was a really quick sketch to start off with, and therefore it's going to remain pretty short-cut based til the end ;)"	t5_2rfxx	True

The site currently houses over 1,500 videos of the top NA/EU pros playing matchups ranging from standard meta fare such as Shen vs Vladimir to more ""innovative"" picks such as Teemo Jungle.  We currently cover nearly 40 streams including fan favorites such as:

* Dyrus
* Voyboy
* WingsofDeath
* Best Riven NA
* Bischu
* Xpeke
* Wickd
* Snoopeh

We believe one of the best ways to learn to play the game is by watching pros play.  Now, you can search for your favorite streamers playing your favorite champion without having to dig through hours of footage in their video archive.

We are constantly seeking to improve our site and we appreciate any feedback from the community.  Also, please don't hesitate to ask questions.  We will try to answer everything in a timely manner.

Thanks!

Edit: You can also follow us **[on Twitter] (https://twitter.com/ProLoLMatchups)** where we'll be posting updates and highlighted matchups.

Edit 2: Sorry about the issues with loading the site guys, we didn't anticipate such a positive reception from reddit.  Thanks again for all of the support and we'll be working with our hosting to resolve the connection issues as soon as possible.

Edit 3: Cleaned up the backend a bit so the page loads should be much faster.  Also added a few videos for Lissandra and Ocelote.  Will focus more on catching up with all of the stream updates tomorrow since the new patch has changed so much.  Thanks guys :)"	t5_2rfxx	True
1360869147.0	18j4mh	Riot Replays on PBE for testing	statuskwoh	5073	3037	859	"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=34654107

Hey folks - figured there would be a lot of interest/discussion around this, especially given some of the threads of the past, so I'm starting this thread so its easy for me to keep an eye on it and be responsive. rjcombo and I will be keeping an eye here and answering what we can about the feature and the testing plan.

Quick bits:

* Gonna be on PBE for awhile, complex back-end feature means lots of testing. This is similar to how Spectator was on the PBE for long periods of time (though hopefully not as long as that was).

+ We aren't 100% feature complete, but it should be a pretty smooth basic experience. Watch replays from your match history, they get organized in a browser, you can pass files around.

* Eventually there will be backwards compatability/patching so old replays stay watchable, but its not up on the PBE yet.

Check it out. Help us find bugs. For those with PBE access, let us know your feedback and questions. "	t5_2rfxx	True

1373285995.0	1huyc8	A new sight on the Tribunal (image in post)	Spate_of_Fire	5644	3681	623	"Hello LoL Reddit, I'm a 25000 rated tribunal judge. Whilst I think the Tribunal is effective as it is now, my experience through thousands of reported-games gave me several ideas on how we could improve it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is my proposition:

http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/4117/v1ed.jpg

(fake case)


**My 3 main ideas :**

1/ Get rid of the Pardon/Punish buttons

2/ Add the Champion-Selection-chat and the After-Game-chat

3/ Give the possibilty for judges to highlight sentences in the chat

-------------------------------------------------------------------


**1/ Get rid of the Pardon/Punish buttons**

All players reported in the tribunal have not the same level of toxicity. While some are just reported for saying 'easy', some insult their teammates, utter threat (etc..).
When I am reviewing cases it just makes me feel bad to click the same button for these two kinds of players.


The Solution:

Replace the 2options buttons (Pardon/Punish) by a 'Ladder of Toxicity'. 

The judges don't choose to punish or pardon the player but indicate on a ladder from 1 to 5 the toxicity of the player, for instance:

1 : no reason to punish

2 : small reason to punish

3 : good reason to punish

4 : really toxic player

5 : EVIL SATAN TEEMO



In this way: Judges would feel more comfortable in their decisions. There is no more Good or Bad Decision for the judges, you are never wrong: you just express your feeling concerning a player on a ladder from 1 to 5.
More other, Judges won’t be able anymore to spam 'Punish' to get higher accuracy in the Tribunal. If you want to have high accuracy you have to really read the case and pay attention to choose the more accurate decision. Currently too many judges just skip cases with few report and spam 'Punish' for cases with a lot of report without even reading it.


**2/ Add the Champion-Selection-chat and the After-Game-chat**

This is something frequently asked for the Tribunal.

In several reported-games you can read in the commentaries of reporters 'insult in after-game-chat' but the Guidelines of the Tribunal are clear: 'All summoners are innocent until proven guilty.'
Adding the after-game-chat would diminish the toxicity of player after the games.


**3/ Give the possibility for judges to highlight evidences**

Reviewing case is a hard work and takes time and concentration.

A judge reading the chatlog looks for evidence to place the player on the ladder of toxicity. But reviewing 20 cases means to read 100 chatlogs, none can be attentive on every single one of this 100games. Consequently often some evidences get through.


We could make a system in which, when a judge find an evidence in the chatlog, he may highlight it.

Once a sentence has been highlighted by a Judge it is visible in red by the other judges that are reviewing the same case. 

The attention of each one benefits to everyone.

(look the example in the drawing at the top of the post)



Here are my propositions, do not hesitate to share your point of view. If you think I made misconceptions on the mechanism of the Tribunal, please let me know.

Thx

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR;** Tribunal could benefit from some changes: replace the Pardon/Punish buttons by a Ladder of toxicity – add the after-game-chat –and judges could highlight evidences in chatlog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** Frontpage =) - In response to comments:

- To avoid ""highlight pollution"" there would be a limit of 1highlight per case per judge. And to appear in red sentences need to be highlighted by several judges, not just once.

- ""*Highlight would influence other judges*"", yes but no: Highlighted sentences are indisputable evidences, like threats or strong insults on wich every judge would agree.


**Edit2:** Glad to see I introduce a good debate. The tribunal is a good thing. I remind you I only suggest ideas to make it better again. I did expect down-votes as it is a hard question and only small ideas, but if you want to down-vote: share your point of view before leaving =)"	t5_2rfxx	True

It was Warwick, myself, and our ADC (I don't remember who the adc was), and as we're pushing the tower, four of the other team show up and we get our asses kicked. 

We start running back, adc in front, me in the middle, and ww in the rear, each with less than 300 health. As we neared the river, I knew we wouldn't be able to outrun them all the way back to our base tower. This was when I realized what I had to do. My autopathing had me set, running back to the tower, so I open the chat box and said ""I'm so sorry warwick."" he replied with an ""I know..."" and at that moment, we both knew what had to happen. With fingers trembling, I pressed the hotkey for my wall, and positioned the cursor in front of our jungler. 

It all seemed to happen in slow motion, as the ice wall started to form, Warwick stopped, turned around, and charged back at the enemy team. he took a swipe at their carry, let out a howl, and fell. I looked at him lying there, hoping he would get up, that a guardian angel would descend upon him and revive him, but no. He laid there motionless, and I spaced back to where I was running, we were about to reach the tower, safe.

I’ve been playing League of Legends for about 3 years now. I’ve been sitting at almost **exactly** 1200 elo for that whole time (Silver V 4 life!). So, I'm a spectacularly mediocre player. But I absolutely love this game, and I especially love the community. 

I’m also an entrepreneur. A while back, my biz partner and I had a LoL-related idea, and we started talking to investors and start-up accelerators here in Chicago. They loved the idea (more below), but they want us to prove people are interested before forking over the money to develop it. 

So, we’re at the stage where we need your help. Investors need to see that people want this thing. That’s why we’re here showing it to you.  Do us a solid and check it out. :)

*****

##The Idea
**In a nutshell:** Voice chat that works *inside* your browser and lets you invite people simply by sharing a URL. No downloads or any other BS. 

Here are the essentials in case you’re not into scrolling/reading. 

* **Our website:** http://ggnoob.net/ 
* **Our cheesy marketing video:** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-ZFXmfaTk 
* **A mock-up of what it would look like in action:** http://imgur.com/lCjMx0w 
* **Here’s where you can sign up (this helps us with investors the most):** https://confirmsubscription.com/h/i/FA5207DE3A26A4A7  


Gamers need to chat. But most voice chat systems just kind of suck. You have to download a client. You have to buy a server (or know someone who has a server). You have to exchange account or server info. You have to set up your audio. Blah blah blah. They are just a complicated, laggy mess. 

But the biggest drawback of these platforms is that you need to know people beforehand. That’s a huge problem for League of Legends. You don’t want to give some random bloke your server information or your Skype name in champion select. 

We figured it was time for something 100x easier, simpler and faster. Here’s how GGNoob would work:

* Log into GGNoob
* Click one button to create a temporary room
* Share the URL (in champion select or wherever)
* Whoever clicks the URL is taken your room and is able to chat

That’s it. It’s the easiest possible process we could think of. The idea is loosely based on the now-defunct [PentaCall]( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13vupg/easy_web_based_team_voice_chat/). PentaCall was an awesome idea, but it was never finished, and it had a few problems. Namely, it was run by one guy (who seemed to quickly ran out of money to fund it), and it could only be used with League of Legends.  

GGNoob solves these problems by creating an investor-backed, browser-based voice chat system that can be used for any game. 

****
##Where we’re at now
At first, we tried to bootstrap the whole thing with our own money. But we ran into two major problems:

* **Problem 1:** It is extremely difficult to find someone to develop something like GGNoob without hiring a big agency. We went through 4-5 independent developers before realizing that they just didn’t have the resources (or time) to do it. We needed a bigger team. 

* **Problem 2:** Any time you host thousands of people on a single website, and they are all essentially streaming media (in this case, it’s exchanging audio information), you need a Flash server. On average, that costs about $200/mo per 200 users. Obviously, we imagine having a couple thousand users. If that was the case, Flash server hosting would cost us a **several thousand dollars per month.** And we just don’t have the budget for that yet. 


*****
## The Business Model

Obviously, this thing will need to sustain itself with some kind of revenue stream. Currently, we think the best way to do that is a **freemium** business model, similar to Twitch.tv or League of Legends itself. 

* You'll be able to use 90% of the service for free

* You'll have the option to upgrade for $7/mo or whatever

* No ads! We think ads hurt the user experience

* We're not sure what the upgrade features will be yet, but they'll probably be along the lines of flair/swag (e.g. custom backgrounds), permanent rooms, and extra big rooms (for bigger MMO clan-type stuff, etc.)

*****
##How you can help
[Join the mailing list]( https://confirmsubscription.com/h/i/FA5207DE3A26A4A7). That’s it. To our investors, every person who gets on the list is someone saying, ""Yeah this seems cool. Let me know when it's finished."" 

It also gives us a way to keep you updated.
*****

## P.S. 

Are there any other features you'd like to see in something like this? Any you could do without?

 We'll do some more extensive testing during development, but feedback is always awesome.

***** 

## P.P.S. Final Update

Thank you guys so much. This has been a *great* response. Makes us feel awesome, and it will certainly go a long way with investors. We'll try to get to all the questions we can. 

And thank you, /u/justdweezil (developer of WeConspire) for showing an intrest in working together. We just learned about WeConspire today, and while we'll do a lot of things differently, we're pumped to put our heads together.

Earlier this year I went through a heartbreaking divorce and my ex wife took my daughter out of state.
While we still lived in the same house my 2 year old daughter would sit in my lap while I played (and yeah I occasionally ate a ban warning because dirty diapers were more important than helping my ADC gather CS).

She loved watching me play and occasionally slammed the keyboard to ""help""...which often landed me right into a gray screen. I didn't mind, I just loved spending time with her.
She even wanted to be Annie for Halloween and I was going to be Tibbers. But due to the divorce that never transpired.

Fast forward to this thanksgiving, I got my daughter for the holiday after only skyping with her since June. On a rough night's sleep she found my Rammus keychain that I received from going to a Riot sponsored event. She knew who it was and wanted him so I made him toddler friendly (no more sharp spikes). Interestingly enough she went back to sleep without a fuss, Rammus tucked in neatly among her other princess plushies, spongebob, and other 'little girl' things.

Now he goes everywhere with her; to the bath, naps, food time, etc. she calls him ""daddy's Rammus"" says ""rawr...OK"" when I ask what sound he makes, throws him across the room yelling ""powball!"", and will surely perplex and annoy her mom when she goes back to her.
I want to say thank you not only for a great game I thoroughly enjoy, but can play with my daughter. More importantly though you all have given my daughter and I another connection to know that I'll always be there for her when I physically cannot be.

Now daddy and Daddy's Rammus can keep my little girl safe from counter ganks.

Thank you Riot and happy holidays r/leagueoflegends! I look forward to lurking you all more for season 3!

EDIT from the playroom:
For those curious, my gaming hobby was not the source of our divorce. Nor was it even an issue. I will not divulge the reason why. 

For those demeaning me, I don't particularly care and I can see why you would make those assumptions.  This post is only one facet of our relationship. My gamer-time and daddy-time are well separated. I didn't make the post for karma or sympathy. Only to sincerely that riot. I do appreciate even your comments.  If you wish to keep demeaning me, I don't mind. I know what I do and how I spend time with my daughter. 

And those who say that I waste their time in games. Diaper changes are not planned an I knew that I was interrupting other players time and energy, so I do apologize for my past AFKs and have been accordingly banned in the process which I deserve for taking away from you enjoyment of the game. (I never played ranked with her.. That's just messed up)

1370477588.0	1fra6p	"True ""mage"" AP mids really need to be looked at."	Washbag	5065	3151	1861	"Hi all,

I'm a D3 plat mid laner.  I'm by no means the best, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I wanted to talk a bit about the archetypal ""mage"" type champions - full ap champs that are squishy, bursty, and lack strong mobility tools.  The champs that I think fit into this category are:

* Veigar
* Cassiopeia (had to look up the spelling on that one)
* Annie
* Brand
* Viktor
* Malzahar
* Syndra
* Zyra
* Xerath
* Lux

There might be some debate as to other champs that might fit this category, such as Ryze or Anivia or Orianna, but I do not really consider them burst champions (meaning they could potentially drop a champion from 100 to 0 in a few skills).

Out of the champions listed, very few (if any) are used consistently in competitive play.  The two most likely to see high level play are probably Xerath and Lux - two champions defined by their absurdly high range.  Zyra also is seen in competitive play, but usually she fits the support role.  To me this signals a problem with a number of things that do NOT have to do with each individual champion's kit.  We could look at Malzahar and talk about how his ult is a self-stun or look at Viktor and talk about how his passive takes up an item slot.  These are valid concerns.  However, I really think the problem is bigger than that.

----------------------

There are four major problems that I see:

**1) Raw AP itemization sucks**

* Every champion on that list has mana issues, with the possible exception of a few.  When I play Malzahar the ""essential"" suggested items are Deathcap and Liandry's.  If you've ever tried to play Malz with only 2 dorans rings then you know it's an exercise in futility. All 3 of his abilities eventually cost well over 100 mana and his ult is 150.  That means at level 9 to try and burst someone down with a full combo you would be spending roughly 450 mana - the majority of his 655 level 9 mana pool.  These mana costs make it essentially mandatory that you buy either a chalice, tear, or catalyst.  All these items mean is you just spent 700-1200 gold in order to be able to play your champion satisfactorily while bruisers, ad's, and assassins don't have to worry at all.  None of those items contribute to what you do best - mid-game bursting.  A Diana can focus on building a mid-game Abyssal Scepter while you are trying to finish your ROA that won't be fully charged for another 10 minutes.  A mid lane Zed can get a brutalizer while you are stuck building mana/seeker's armguard.

* Defensive itemization is bad.  If an ad champ is having trouble vs AP then he builds a 1400 gold hexdrinker.  Bam - immediate mr, ad, and a very good passive.  If an ap assassin (Diana, Kassadin, Elise, etc.) is having trouble vs AP then he builds Abyssal.  Also, both of these groups can just get an MR item, such as a negatron, and will not sacrifice much damage and can later build that item into something useful.  If a pure AP caster is having trouble against either of these people then his/her options are very limited.  For armor you have to build seekers and then WAIT for it to give you stats.  I don't know why the fuck they decided that was a good idea. ""This Zed is blowing me up, better get this item and then pray he doesn't kill me before it gives me another 15 armor.""

* Late game damage is subpar compared to AD carries/bruisers, but your midgame is not any better than theirs really.

* You're stuck with Sorc Shoes 95% of the time

**2) Lots of champions can counter you in midlane.  You counter almost no one.**

When was the last time you heard someone say ""Shit, their team picked a XXXX, better grab Brand to counter it.""

The fact of the matter is that these AP mids are not tailor made to counter any other champion.  Even Veigar, who has a fucking button that practically says ""Push me to kill an AP champion"" is never selected competitively. We even have a professional player that loves to play him (Nyjacky) and yet he is rarely seen as a part of Curse's team comps.  I rarely feel like I have the upper hand when I play someone like Viktor.  I'm not sure what the reason for this is, but it's indicative of something.

**3) These champions are restricted to mid lane**

None of these champions can go full AP carry anywhere other than mid lane.  Lee Sin can play jungle, mid, or top.  Kha'zix can go mid or top.  Jayce and Zed as well. Ryze, Diana, Vlad, etc etc.  It's a disadvantage for picks/bans because once you pick Annie the other team knows for a fact what is going mid and what is going top.  It's also indicative of a problem if an entire class of champions will get eaten alive by pretty much any top laner in the other solo lane.

**4) Mobility creep left us behind**

Most top laners/junglers have a way to reach the back line.  This means that by the time you get your full combo off you are usually dead as shit.  It's not very rewarding to have to blow your load as Malzahar on one champion and then die shortly thereafter during every single fight.

Maybe this is an issue with itemization or base stats, but highly mobile champions just live longer.  I think this gets back to the reason of why Lux/Xerath are the two champs that perform the best out of the list - their range is so absurd that they are able to reach the backline without jeopardizing themselves.

----------------


I hope this can start some good discussion because I would like to see what you guys think.

**TL;DR  Squishy, bursty, non-mobile AP mids are having a hell of a time competing against other champs in the mid lane and elsewhere.**"	t5_2rfxx	True

I know the Riot design team's been working hard this year. Much too hard to even consider implementing anything like the snow-based holiday map from last year.

And don't get me wrong, I'm very impressed by all the new work that's being done in regards to S3 items, interface, and artwork. 

But I don't think I'm alone in wishing that Riot would do SOMETHING - just a LITTLE something for the holidays.

Therefore, this is a petition for Morello. I'm asking that, for the week of Christmas, you bring back the Santa hat on Baron. That's all. No complicated christmas-y effects or snowfall, no blinding-white snow textures that bother half the playerbase. It would literally be less than 10 minutes of work for one of the developers, and a 30-second patch. Just a hat.

Riot plz.

If people agree, leave a little post to show you care. :3

Happy holidays everyone!

EDIT: Front page! Thanks for your support, let's get Morello's attention!

and they even get payed from the watchers.

it's known that they always get payed.

of course, not all broadcasters is toxic as they are, but the problem is

in korea league of legends server, bronze tiers, you'll find many guys chatting ""i'm in dia tier look my last few games, and give me mid i'll carry this game""

1365080104.0	1bnokx	New Camera Idea	lappy74	6751	4872	863	"I've been playing League of Legends for some time now and have been doing so with locked camera. I understand why it is seen as 'noobish', it does not help your map awareness and you get a disadvantage if you are on purple side due to the HUD getting in the way. This is all true. I know some of you will probably just say 'learn to play free cam'. I guess I could do that, but I thought my new idea may be able to help find a balance between the two camera modes.

Here is a short and very crude animation of how it sort of works:

http://i.imgur.com/z4hCyUd.gif

Sorry, I'm aware the end part is a bit too quick. Hopefully my explanation below will help a bit more.

I'm sure you're all aware of how each camera mode works, so I'll just get right into it. The idea is that there is a 'barrier', of sorts, that surrounds your character. You can move your mouse cursor like you would in free cam to see other parts of the map. However, this 'barrier' prevents the camera from going a certain distance from him/her so that he/she is always on screen. But, when you click to move around the camera follows your character around the screen like it would in locked cam, the only difference is you are not in the centre of the screen.

I feel this would be a big help for people on purple who want to extend their view down towards blue's side and it will help people to remain aware of where their character is at all times.

So, what do you guys think, is my idea okay or just stupid?

Edit 1: Wow, did not expect this kind of feedback on my idea. Glad a lot of you people like it. Quite a few people are just keep saying use space bar and free cam in order to keep tabs on where you are at, at all times. Which I completely understand and I am actually going to try this the next time I play League of Legends. One thing people also seem to keep be doing is just comparing this to free cam, it isn't supposed to be better than free cam. It may have some slight issues and bugs to work out, if it were actually implemented into the game. This would be just another option for people who want to have a locked cam, but want a little more map awareness. And yes, I now know that Bloodline Champions has a similar feature. Anyway, thanks :D

1373233824.0	1htoaa	A Warning to New LCS teams and rising Amateur teams	MegaZeroLoL	5789	3950	1254	"As many of you know, I'm MegaZero from Team Marn or I suppose, former member of Team Marn part of the NA LCS during the first split. Now don't get me wrong, I love competitive League and I hope it takes off to be on par with that of other professional sports. This is simply a warning because with the current system of how LCS is ran, managers have a tremendous amount of power over the players and before you hire a manager, you need to make sure it's someone that you trust and someone that is going to help the team out.

I've always believed that the majority of the team should have power (3/5 members), however, the manager controls who receives how much money each person receives, all roster swaps, and he pretty much owns the team and can sell it to anyone he deems necessary. In my case, our manager decided to pay himself over 3x that of our highest paid player. Now there are some contractual rules that are there to help the players, but I'm not positive if I'm allowed to get into them. Riot has been helping out our team and trying to sort out the situation, but we still haven't received any of the 'stolen' money. I do take full responsibility for letting this situation happen, it was all just very unfortunate because at the time, my team trusted our manager a lot and it was really hurting our team by constantly arguing about managerial responsibilities so I dropped the matter after a week or two.

Now that was just a personal scenario from being in the LCS, I've heard rumors that an entire team could be sold and the entire roster would've been swapped out. I could be wrong, but as far as I know, this is perfectly legal and it's due to the fact that managers have complete control over a team. This seems like a major flaw in eSports, especially at its current stage. Most of the players are very young and trust people blindly. They don't take managers seriously and usually just hire a friend or a popular player. I'm not saying every team does this, but because the manager role isn't like a real sport yet, you put these young players in a situation where their career can be totally ruined just because there's someone that controls their fate.

I have a couple of ideas to help improve the situation and I think the easiest thing would just be give power to the majority in the team (however I'm sure the community can come up with better ideas so feel free to comment!) Another idea was to have a background check/interivew by Riot before someone is eligible to become manager. Being a manager of a professional team is a job, and I think it should be treated as such. This thread isn't entirely for coming up with ways to help the players out, but also a PSA that you really need to trust your manager and make sure he/she is the best one you can find before you get into the LCS.

Edit: And just a little side note, I love Phranq! (He's complexity's manager) I've never felt closer to a manager and he really loves his team and what he does. You da best Phranq.

Edit 2: While this thread was more geared as a warning to new players than a thread about Marn, it appears Marn is going to be commenting tonight. I would much rather you hear both sides of the story than follow my words as I could be very biased (You don't have a reason to trust me). I tried my best to just give straight facts which my team would agree that everything I said was true, but people should always be able to defend themselves."	t5_2rfxx	True

1376256243.0	1k5yje	Fiora's R is hideously broken.	excusemewtf	4426	2585	988	"**EDIT:** I did not mean ""broken"" as in overpowered. I meant broken as in it is not a skill that functions in any logical way. Please read what is written below before shooting off some reply about how it is or isn't overpowered - I didn't mean unbalanced, I meant literally broken. **/EDIT**

I honestly don't know if a single skill more broken than Fiora's R. The way it works mechanically is seriously ridiculous. Allow me to explain.

Fiora's R is a series of 5 attacks with bonus damage. The first one on each target deals a very high amount with any that follow dealing 25% of that. They apply on hit effects and Hydra will splash them (meaning that Hydra + Black Cleaver on Fiora makes her R an AoE armor debuff) but her ultimate has some tremendous downfalls, and only some of them are based on intentional counterplay.

Here's a short list of things that ruin Fiora's ult - I could list more, but just to make a point.

Jax's E completely negates the damage. For the whole ult, every hit that would target him.
Pantheon's passive blocks a hit. If it's the first hit, it blocks about 50+% of the total damage he'd take.
Blinds cause it to miss.

All of that is fine - a solid Fiora player can play around all of it, and it's all in her power to do. Bait out Jax's E, Teemo's blind, knock off Pantheon's shield, whatever. But there is another really dumb aspect of this skill that requires a bit of explanation first.

Each hit of Fiora's R has 3 parts. The first is a teleport. The second is a ""check."" The third is a hit. Despite what the description suggests you are not untargettable for the check phase - you can be hit with skills and die. Basically, you teleport the target, the game checks if you can see and hit them, then you hit them. Then this repeats for the next hit (which will target a different champion if it can.)

Once you're in your ult, that's it. You can pop summoners like Ignite but other than that, you're just along for the ride.

If at any point a target becomes invulnerable, untargetable or invisible when Fiora is performing a check on them, her ult stops dead in its tracks. Doesn't matter if it's the first or second hit, it will stop and no more of her attacks will resolve. Zhonya's cancels her ult immediately, along with things like Yi's Q, or STEPPING INTO A BRUSH WITH THE RIGHT TIMING. And there is nothing Fiora can do about this except make sure she never ever uses her R in the presence of someone with Zhonya's, an untarget-status ability, or a bush anywhere within flash range. Basically Fiora's only answer is to not ult at all ever.

[Here](http://www.twitch.tv/excuseslol/c/2734132) is an example showing Yi fizzling Fiora's ult on the 2nd hit. Costing a kill on Darius (and likely Yi too) if only because she doesn't end her ultimate on Darius like she should have, and thus he walks away.

tl;dr riot pls Fiora's R is the worst skill mechanically in the game (except maybe rocket jump) and has been like this since the day she was released. It's her ULTIMATE. One of the primary reasons she is a weak character (besides lol meleeadc)

**EDIT #2:** Sheesh, top post on /r/leagueoflegends. Well, here's hoping someone from Riot noticed at least. Fiora is the most fun champion to play since Riven and I hope her ult gets the attention it needs.

**EDIT #3:** Fiora players rejoice - Riot has heard and RiotVolty has confirmed he is making her R a priority. Make sure his post gets seen: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1k5yje/fioras_r_is_hideously_broken/cblwzun"	t5_2rfxx	True

Mechanics raised in discussion:

* ""Behind"" is relative to where MF is standing in relation to the target.

* While it doesn't prioritize champions, the random target selection might be weighted towards champions. This is pure speculation.

* ~~I'm 90% certain that anything between the primary target and the bounce target will take the damage instead, kind of like Cait's ult. Needs further testing to be sure. This is likely not true, but still unconfirmed.~~ The bounce cannot be intercepted.

* ~~Phreak is [fairly certain](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fpzjg/how_miss_fortunes_double_up_works/caco8jm)  that the bounce target is decided when the ability is cast, not when the primary target is hit.~~ The bounce target is selected at the time of impact with the primary target.

* You don't need vision of bounce targets to hit them.

All of them are ice-themed and and all their ults are pretty similar.  They all stun a single target and then have an AoE CC effect that radiates from that single target.  

HOWEVER, Sejuani and Lissandra's ult both entomb the primary target in Ice, while Ashe's does not (despite the fact that she does so in that one trailer).

1351267482.0	124ngb	The Tale of Doomy, Troll Support Nasus (Or, Why You Should Trust People and Be Supportive)	meakel	2635	811	484	"This is a true story, at about 1300~1500 Elo ranked.

------------------------------------------------------
I was duo'ing with a friend on one fateful night when we come across an odd summoner named Doomy. 

He is second to last pick and when his turn comes he asks innocently:
 &gt;***""what i playing?""***

We hesitantly tell him: *""Support.""*

&gt;***""oh. I thott I mid. But ok.""***

Phew, we think. Crisis averted.

&gt;***""should I play dog man or dragon lady?""***

Wait. What?

&gt;***""dog man? Ok dog man.""*** Locks in support Nasus.

At this point, we silently express our condolences to the Tristana who is asking *""What? No Taric? Raka? Uhhhhhhh...""*

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The game starts, we're half hopeful and half in denial.
&gt;***""buy wards?""***

Our Trist responds: *""yes.*""

&gt;***""2? or 1?""***

*""How much money do you have?""*

&gt;***""400.""***

*""Get two.""*

----------------------------------------------------
At this point, my friend and I are laughing our asses off, feeling sorry for the poor Trist, stuck with Doomy, the intensely persistent troll Nasus.

A level 1 team fight breaks out, but Doomy is in the wrong side of the jungle.

Trist types: *""Nasus come mid""*

&gt;***""i am mid? not bot?""***

*""Just for now!""* 

I give up first blood, but I don't care because in my head it's a lost cause and I'm laughing way too hard.

-------------------------------------------------------------
We come out of the skirmish 2 to 2, them with first blood, but their jungler way behind. At about one minute we see the Trist say:

*""Play defensive.""*

&gt;***""should i hit mans?""***

A couple seconds later, **'An Enemy Has Been Slain.'**

I am in stitches at this point, wondering what Nasus buffs must've been added to the last patch.

Again he asks:

&gt;***""hit mans? or no?""***

*""huh? go ward""*

&gt;***""like this?""***

It hits me and I realize, this guy is *literally* pretending to be an obedient dog. Holy shit, more laughter.

-------------------

At about 6:30 minutes in, bot lane gives up a double kill.

&gt;***""sry. not strong""***

*""Its okay, Sona got the kills.""*

At about this point, our top lane Olaf expresses the sentiment that he might commit suicide if we lose this game. Our Trist, who has been ridiculously patient up to this point, calms him down and tells him to focus on late game.

------------------

At about 9:00 in, I tell my duo partner to help me 4-man bot lane. It's a successful gank, but we trade two for Trist. While dead he asks:

*""hey doomy. where are you from?""*

&gt;***""?? jp""***

*""japan? woah""*

&gt;***""ya""***

*""why play on NA servers?""*

&gt;***""better player""***

*""i thought asians were supposed to be super good at this game o.o""*

&gt;***""korea""***

Now I can't tell if this guy is going super troll mode, or I've been misconstruing everything this whole time.

-----------------------------------------------
At about 13:00, I'm doing blue and I see bot tower go down.

*""yeah, we lost bot, don't worry I'll just freeze""*

Then I see the Nasus walk by, (we're blue side btw) and I think wtf. So I just follow him and clumsily, we 3-man the enemy top laner. Olaf's Reckless Swing plus the Siphoning Strike instagibs the nearby enemy jungling Mundo. I go down mid to help the people grouping there and I hear another, **'An Enemy Has Been Slain'**. I look up and Doomy is dangerously low.

Olaf says: *""sorry buddy, didn't think you were coming""*

&gt;***""it ok. i alive.""***

---------------------------------------------------------

At 17:30, Doomy is bot lane, farming his Q while the Trist picks up red. Suddenly Vayne pops out and starts engaging. The yellow pings start coming out from our team but Doomy stands stubbornly against the enemy AD carry despite taking free hits at the beginning. Amazingly the two health bars begins to equalize, but they're both getting dangerously low. 

Trist jumps in at the last second, picking up the kill in an attempt to save Doomy but alas it is too late.

&gt;***""GJ TRISTANA""***

*""Im sorry D: no mana!""*

&gt;***""it ok""*** 

-----------------------------------

At about 19:00 our Olaf dives a tier 2 tower for a kill on the enemy top laner, attracting the attention of the other 4, half health, out of mana. He runs, spending Ragnarok and Ghost running, baiting them right into the rest of us, we grab three kills. We chase the enemy Kassadin down to mid but he escapes with a sliver of health.

Doomy runs in out of nowhere, tanks the first tower, lands Wither and Strike for the kill, and then nonchalantly dodges the ult arrow from the just-spawned top lane Ashe (I don't even know) and tanks the second tower, strolling back to safety, no fucks given.

&gt;***""[All] Doomy: BIG DOG""***

---------------------------

25:00 in, and the first big 5v5 starts. An Ashe arrow is loosed, missing the Olaf, headed straight for Trist who is out of position. Doomy flashes in, taking the arrow and subsequent Sona ult, allowing the rest of us to focus down their carries one by one, chasing them back, and taking the two mid towers in the process.

We attempt to take inhib tower, but the enemy team begins to respawn. With little minion support, our team backs off, willing to come back for the tower another time. But Doomy, with no fucks left since team select, stays the extra millisecond to take the tower down. As a result, the enemy Mundo and Sona, fully refreshed, are on him, perma-slows and all. 

As my team attempts to flee and kite them away from Doomy, us out of position and health low, Doomy takes an unexpected detour, peeling their team away from us so that we can escape.

I run alongside him, across a barrier of treeline, desperately throwing Malphite Q across in an attempt to stop his pursuers. But there are too many, and he is too low. Doomy falls, martyred for the team and an inhibitor tower. 

*""im sorry doomy D:""*

&gt;***""it ok***

&gt;***team live***

&gt;***dog die""***

Manly tears were shed.

------------------------------

Afterwards we push for the win, steamrolling them and taking nexus. 
In the post-game lobby, he leaves before I can ask whether or not he's trolling. So I check lolking, to see how many Nasus games he's played in ranked. 

This was his first.

Also, if you don't have the time for the whole thing, you should at least catch the team fight at the 25:00 mark. That's the big line and martyr moment.

We already know that the Shadow Isles were once a thriving kingdom that fell when the king's daughter died, and caused it to become the cursed land of the dead. We also know that Mordekaiser betrayed the king in some way, and that way was not killing the king's daughter. If you rule out killing his daughter, there are only a few ways left that Mordekaiser could have betrayed the king. Either he killed the king himself, or he did something behind the curtains that helped the kingdom fall and become cursed. If it was the first one, why would the altar warn hecarim about Mordekaiser? He would know what Mordekaiser did. We also know that Mordekaiser's armor and undead status are a punishment or curse, that he seeks to get rid of for some reason. 

**When you really think about it, why would one death, the death of the king's daughter, cause an entire kingdom to fall, and become the cursed land of the dead?**

So, great, what happened then? Fast forward a couple of centuries, **Karthus enters the Shadow Isles, accepts undeath, and becomes a sort of god of the place with the ""*Keys to life and death*""**. But wait, why a couple centuries? The events of the current Shadow Isles have actually taken a very long time to flesh out. **Sometime between their creation and now, the beings Thresh(The soul collector) and Yorick(The gravedigger aka body collector) came into existence, and Yorick's lore states that he's been digging in servitude to the Isles for centuries.**

The fact that they came to existence in the Isles through dying serves as proof to what Elise says about the Isles being death's gate. *""That was when I understood that death was another world and I was at its door.""*

Hecarim's creation was shortly after Karthus gained his powers. The soul of the king was floating around the Isles along with all of the other souls kingdom's residents.*Off tangent here, I believe the fog surrounding the Isles to actually be nothing more than the souls of the dead. When the king's soul was extracted to create Hecarim, it left the fog barrier weakened, and it is now Elise's job to offer souls in masses to try and strengthen it*.

Many quotes and lore lines support Hecarim being the reincarnated king:
""Remember who you once were, Hecarim!"" - Riot's way of telling us he's important.
""Mordekaiser is not to be trusted, Hecarim!"" - The fact that Hecarim is the one receiving this warning is important.
""others still believed him to be the creation of some hateful necromancer."" - Straight from the horse's lore. Some hateful necromancer sounds exactly like a guy that hates the living and has the keys to life and death themselves.

Lemme know what you guys think :D 

**Tl;Dr** No, pls read it.

**Obligatory front page edit: Thanks so much for the upvotes guys :D are lore investigations something you all would like to see more of in the future? I absolutely loved doing this**

**EDIT: Upon hearing you guys' suggestions, I can definitely see it possible that Hecarim is actually the leader of the former king's cavalry/army. This could easily make just as much sense as my previous hypothesis :)**

**Important Edit: I've decided to post smaller tidbits, hypotheses, and questions I have on the lore to my twitter account.

1364486690.0	1b6lxe	Some useful LoL websites that EVERYONE should know about	cable729	3410	1606	474	"###Personal Stats (Summoner Information)

* **[Quickfind](http://quickfind.kassad.in/)** - Gives you all the quick information you want to know about your summoner. When it was created, how much IP you have, along with a bunch of other cool information in a great layout.

* **[LoL Summoners](http://www.lolsummoners.com/)** - You remember how Riot took down the ladders? Well these guys put it back up! It may not always be up-to-date, but you can scroll between pages to find what percentile you'd be in when it updates.

* **[LoL Team](http://www.lolteam.net)** - Ever wonder if you should be scared of that enemy Shaco? Well pull up this site and type in your name and you can see how many games everyone's played of that character, their k/d/a, their current tier (gold IV or such), and more.

* **[LoL Nexus](http://lolnexus.com/)** - Similar to LoL Team, but also shows you who is duo queue'd. It's currently disabled, but you can see a screenshot [here](http://www.lolnexus.com/img/scouter-screenshot3.png).

* **[Pro Builds](http://www.probuilds.net/)** - This is a really cool site where you can see what builds the pros are using **right now**. You get to see their item order, skill order, final build, gold, team, runes, masteries, and even a picture of the pro! All this in a nice-looking site that is super polished.

* **[Spectate Us](http://spectate.us)** - Type in a summoner name and select a region. If that person is playing a match right now, you can click a button to spectate them with your League client.

* **[LolKing](http://www.lolking.net/)** - LolKing has been the place to go for stats for a long time, and it still is. However, there are new and better sites emerging that replicate some of LolKing's features and even have more. LolKing also has some okay guides and very cool graphs and visualizations.

* **[Elophant](http://www.elophant.com/)** - Elophant recently got a full makeover. ~~They used to be a pay-only service that all the pros used, but now to compete with Lolking they turned to a ad-based revenue model while keeping their site free to all visitors.~~ The advantage they have over Lolking is that Elophant shows win percentages on champions for season 3.

* **[Elobuff](https://elobuff.com/landing)** - Powerful statistics. This is a pay-site as opposed to LolKing and Elophant.

###News/Pro Scene

* **[Lolplay (League Vods)](http://lolplay.tv/)** - Missed the LCS last weekend? No problem, just go to Lolplay and look up the last week. You can start watching at the picks/bans, game start, first blood, or whenever you want. They also have tournaments that aren't LCS.

* **[Riot Esports](http://na.lolesports.com/)** - They have a great site with a lot of information. They have articles on past games, predictions, stats, interviews, you name it. If you love professional esports, this is the place to go.

* **[Esports Calendar](http://esportcalendar.com/)** - Contains all the up-and-coming tournaments. Times, dates, teams, games, etc.

* **[Surrender at 20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/)** - Do you remember [MMO Champion](http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/) from WoW? This is basically the same thing. News aggregator, red post tracker, articles, and more.

* **[Reign of Gaming](http://www.reignofgaming.net/)** - Pretty similar to SurrenderAt20. They also aggregate news, have a red tracker. However, they also have awesome in-depth mathcrafting articles and multiple tier lists, including solo, competitive, jungle, threes, and dominion.

* **[In2LoL](http://www.in2lol.com/en/start)** - This looks like a news site that's more focused on the Pro scene. They also aggregate Vods and Livestreams. There's a calendar on the right counting down to the next games too, neat!

* **[LoL Portal](http://www.lolportal.net/)** - Another news site, keeps a ladder of the top teams on the right, which is neat.

### Guides and League Information

* **[Solomid](http://www.solomid.net/)** - My favorite place to go for guides. Their guides seem to be more detailed that Lolpro and cleaner in general. My only complaint is that they play a 30 second video ad at the top of the page. However, this is easily remedied with Adblock.

* **[LolPro](http://www.lolpro.com/)** - Where TSM Snapdragon has solomid.net, Curse has lolpro.com. They have some good guides, although they usually have less information than solomid counterparts.

* **[Mobafire](http://www.mobafire.com/)** - A highly controversial guide site. It's a great resource for newer players, but the guide quality has fallen dramatically since its launch. I find other guide sites much more useful.

* **[League Wikia](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki)** - A wiki specifically made for League of Legends. This is the one I use.

* **[Leagueapedia](http://leaguepedia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki)** - Another wiki option. They specialize in documenting the pro scene.

* **[Is LoL up?](http://islolup.com/)** - Tells you if the servers are up.

### Other Stuff

* **[Leaguepedia Fantasy](http://www.leaguepediafantasy.com/)** - Are you a fan of fantasy baseball/football/etc.? Then surely you'll want to visit Leaguepedia Fantasy! I believe this is the only site to offer a LoL Fantasy experience.

* **[Teams of Legends](http://www.teamsoflegends.com/)** - This site helps you find members for your team, of teams for you to join. You can also search for a scrim to play in. All in all, looks like a well-polished site."	t5_2rfxx	True

e.g. You ban Draven and he says something like ""Welcome to the League of ... aww damnit."" or you ban Elise and she's like ""Afraid of spiders, summoner?"".

Also cool added like easter egg could be if you play one champion for ten games in a row and pick something else, they'll say something slightly dissapointed or resentful e.g. pick Riven 10 games and then pick something else and she says ""I guess a broken blade wasn't enough for the likes of you.""
Just little idea for if they have a lot of spare time though, which might never really happen, but imo would be cool.

1364064850.0	1ave2s	Reverse Draft Mode	Dreksontar	4647	2848	699	"So about two weeks ago I'd made a comment about a new game mode called Reverse Draft(RD). I'm posting it here to 1) Get it more attention, and 2) To generate some conversation about it including how to implement it so give out some ideas on rulings. (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1a583j/so_april_fools_day_comes_soon/c8u9dg3)

The jist of it is that the game mode works very similarly to the current draft mode. The champion selection process will start each team will ban three champion. Champions will be selected in the same format 1-2-2-2-2-1. The major difference here is that as you are choosing a champion your icon doesn't light up with the champion you chose, that player on the other teams does. So what will happen is that you choose from your champion pool, a champion that you want the other team to play.

I personally think this would be hilarious, ending up with crazy team compositions. Bans that in regular draft would seem silly. Current Karma ban? in RD yeah. This game would be about trying to coordinate making the opponents team have absolutely no synergy and shambling a team together from what the opponent gives you. IMO you would often have teams that would have to break the current meta and would be a great way to just have fun while playing league. It would also give underplayed champions a place to thrive and to see these champions played.

In the past few weeks the Imperial Kingdom of /r/DotA2 (IKD2) has committed repeated acts of war against the Government and the people of our great Democratic People’s Republic of Teemo (DPRT).

As is resolved by the Great Leaders of our great subreddit on the morning of the 1st of April, the state of war between the Democratic People’s Republic of Teemo and the Imperial Kingdom of /r/Dota2 which has thus been thrust upon us is hereby formally declared; and that the Great Leaders be, and is authorized and directed to employ the all forces and resources to carry on war against the IKD2; and to bring the conflict to a successful termination by end of day April 1st, 2013 all of the resources are hereby pledged by all comrades of the DPRT.

The People’s Republic of Teemo has chosen Comrade Teemo to act as our general and war symbol. His proven track record of superior scouting, stealth acts, and naturally constructed shroom traps shall lead this war to a swift closure by the day's end.

The regime has decided that the DPRT will be fighting this war primarily on our soil (/r/LeagueOfLegends). **All comrades caught warring in enemy soil outside of the [**main front**](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1becna/declaration_of_war_against_the_imperial_kingdom/) will be considered as defectors and will be swiftly punished.** The dictatorship wishes very minimal casualties to all innocents in the homeland of the IKD2.

To commemorate this glorious day of war, we have permanently changed the look of the subreddit.

The Regime

I don't understand how League of Legends can call itself e-sport without such an essential tool. Not only it would increase enjoyment of LCS games and tournaments games in general. For example you want to watch only bottom or top lane match-up. But it could help you to improve by watching replays of your games.

1373386061.0	1hxws5	IMPORTANT fact about the Mecha Khazix Skin! Riot Fix please!	Craizel	5646	3854	406	"So, today I was one of the many who most likely bought this awesome skin at half price. Many have been happy with this sale considering this is the first 1350 skin to be promoted at a lower price. However, while in game, sporting my brand new mechanized void reaver, I realized something.
One of my favorite features of this skin was recently removed by Riot, without them probably even realizing that in fact a recent 3.8  balance change on Khazix has permanently altered this (and less prominently- his base skin's) most appealing aesthetic feature. Since evolved void spikes end projectiles no longer consume Unseen threat, the awesome explosions at the end of this ability's use are no longer animated in the skin. I'm talking about how the bomb like explosions at the end of the range animated previously in this skin are no longer there due to unseen threat not being consumed. In the normal skin this is the purple void like explosions with the alternate sound.
My suggestion is for Riot to animate this permanently on evolved spikes and possibly the normal single spike without needing unseen threat, as this was such a cool feature in the skin. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: MECHA KHAZIX had pretty awesome explosions on his evolved spikes, but now does not due to it not being possible to consume unseen threat. Riot should make this the base animation regardless, since it was a cool part of the skin.

IMPORTANT edit: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i0ol0/important_mecha_khazix_does_not_have_his_evolved/

Almost a year to the day we started filming, CLG and Machinima VS are proud to premier the first documentary covering a professional League of Legends team. The film has a total run time of approximately 51 minutes broken down into four episodes as follows.

* Episode 1 - First Blood (8:53)
* Episode 2 - Seoul Searching (12:09)
* Episode 3 - The ""CLG Curse"" (17:54)
* Episode 4 - A New Hope (11:56)

Originally envisioned as a story about CLG’s quest to win the Season 2 Championships, over the last six weeks and through the direction of Machinima VS the scope of the film has been greatly expanded to give better context of the team and its history.

We have decided to distribute this film through a “pay what you want” model. CLG decided to finance the film ourselves in order to remove ourselves from the expectations or restrictions sourcing funding comes with. At the same time, we feel this film is not only entertaining, but very enlightening for the League of Legends and eSports fan in general, so we feel it is important for anyone to be able to view this film if they are interested and unable to donate. There are many realities regarding teams, sponsors, leagues, and more which go completely unmentioned to the general public. CLG is just one story, and we wanted to give our fans and the community a better view behind the veil of eSports.

If you are able and choose to donate, your support is obviously greatly appreciated. Please do not post direct links to the documentary in this thread. Donations received will go to CLG to recover the costs of producing the film (travel, equipment, filming and production wages). Additional revenue will be divided between CLG and its players, current and former (EG/CLG EU), to help recover the streaming revenue they lost due to own3D.tv’s collapse.

I’d like to thank everyone involved in the production of this film. On the behalf of everyone in CLG and Machinima VS, thanks for your continued support and enjoy the film!

After calling the role already filled they refuse to communicate or compromise on what roles they would be willing to play. I then decide that rather than have a gimped team I will take one for the team of complete strangers and dodge the queue.

**AND THEN** the greatest injustice in the entire game is bestowed upon me: A queue dodging penalty of an entire hour. I just saved three people from playing with this moron who based on current observations would make a terrible team mate.

My suggestion would be this: When the notification shows up in the bottom right telling you who left your game. The four remaining team mates would vote on whether leaving the game was justified. If if three of the four say yes the leaver would serve no penalty And if half say yes they would serve a slightly reduced penalty.

This suggestion keeps with the ""For the players. By the players."" Philosophy of the Tribunal.

So far so good, but the downside to this was that at some points of the match I lost track of the wards that I placed with the Sightstone.

It would be great if, when moving my mouse over the item, all wards placed with it were highlighted on the minimap and ingame. 

Of course one point might be that as a better support you should be able to remember their position, but especially when in a teamfight (and / or in a hurry) it might be a bit harder.

I'm honestly surprised by the amount of replies saying ""why not just use your brain blabla"", I was just trying to get some input on this idea and whether it would be usefull or not. so thanks to all the constructive replies, I even learned that there's a difference between sightstone wards and normal wards when clicking on them (thanks to /u/Sloth_says_what)!

Whilst this is my own fault for using a small generic password since early beta, what I don't understand is why there's absolutely no system in place for email confirmation.

Once someone has your password that's it, the account is gone with no immediate way to recover it as they can change the email without needing access to the current email(big flaw). There isn't even an email telling you that it was changed or that your password was changed.

Riot could save a **lot** of time and money in support tickets(the wait time is anywhere from 3d-1w) from stupid people like my self if they tighten up how easy it is to completely hijack an account.



A few things that other games/services do:

* Require email action on email change(this allows the original owner to always recover the account if their email isn't compromised)
* Require a small access code sent by email/SMS when a new location/computer is detected

* Additional layer of security in the form of secret question

Again, I'd like to emphasis that it's my own fault for not being more vigilant but everyone would benefit from more security.

1373919195.0	1id23z	Evil Geniuses team additions &amp; restructuring.	snoopeh	6461	4709	1109	"******
**I wrote the following for our fans and my fans specifically as I feel I owe them an explanation.**

-----------
Some of you may have expected some form of statement from ourselves; while some may have feared it, some may have desired it and some may have have called it a necessity. While this won't be as drama filled as an episode of Gamecribs, it will aim to provide an insight for our fans who have loyally supported us for almost two years as a team (*and to the fans we have acquired along the way*) the situation in our team and where we want to be in the coming months. I hope to provide you an insight into the most stable roster in competitive league which has been through trials and tribulations at the bottom and the top of this scene even if you're not rooting for our team specifically.
*******
Over the past two years of being a team we have lived together in Korea, America and Germany making us more than just a team, but also good friends and that friendship is testament to how long we have stayed together as a roster despite the ups and downs of our history. We had incredible success in 2012, reaching 3rd/4th behind Azubu Frost &amp; TPA (*ps: still bitter about losing to Frost, we almost had them in OGN!*). While friendship is one of the core values of our team and our popularity in the community – we are at heart competitive players, and as any competitive player *(in any sport)*, we want to win. We don't play League of Legends 10 hours a day and think about it in our sleep, critiquing each other and ourselves as individuals because we want to participate – we do this because we want to win and unfortunately that is not the case right now.
*******
**“So what gives?”** - A good question, going from a world class team the previous season to a mediocre team.... something has to be wrong, right? Well obviously, but it's not a simple fix and we have come to the point now where we are running out of time. We are currently bottom of the table and only a month away from play-offs which we won't even qualify for if we are not top 6, never mind making it to World Finals.
*****
We never really needed a manager, what we needed was after being together for almost two years – was someone else.. someone we can respect to objectively look at our games, a coach/analyst. However finding someone like that is not easy, believe me.. I looked! After our weak performance in the opening of the second split, we witnessed considerable roster changes from other teams who were facing a lot of internal and external pressure at the time. Consequently, Christoph 'nRated' Seitz was released from Fnatic and while we found this surprising news, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up the analyst we always wanted. Not only is he a very capable player in terms of skill, he has a sharp mind when it comes to decision making in game and as he is a friend, we are able to respect his opinion and observations of our team both in and out of game.
*****
**""What role will nRated play in the team?""** He will play several roles, but primarily he will be the Analyst of the team, filling a hole which already in the short time he has been with us has made a considerable impact in decision making and highlighted things which we were previously ignorant of.
*****
Is it enough? Will it get us from the bottom of the table to the top? Obviously it's not the answer to all of our problems, however it will help considerably coupled with the following change.

**I've taken the decision to take a step back temporarily**. While my performance has been scrutinized, it's not as a result of any external pressure – Evil Geniuses has no impact on this, in fact I have a very positive working relationship with Evil Geniuses *(which will continue..)*. However, as a team we realize that we are running out of time, it's 4 weeks until play offs, we are not where we need to be and we cannot tolerate being anywhere else but Worlds. I don't know and we as a team don't know if substituting me will be beneficial, but we want to try it out now.. rather than later.. *(as we need results now)*.
****

**We depart for LCS Tenerife tomorrow**, with our first game being against Fnatic on Thursday. We will have **Mojtaba “Shacker” Aflaton**, previously of team **Animate eSport** substituting in place of me in order to see how he performs at an offline event. We will have Shacker and nRated taking the role of substitutes and instead of having substitutes because it's a requirement, we want to have them to actually utilize them actively.
****
Going forward, we look to alternate between having me and Shacker playing jungle, Krepo and nRated playing support during practice – this will allow us to evaluate each others performance, identifying strengths and weaknesses. The idea behind this is to improve our performance as a team, not to act as a threat to the starting line up *(even though this added pressure can result in people stepping up their game, which is a good thing!)*.
****
--------
**I'd like to thank the fans for their continued support and express that we do understand their frustration. I hope you understand my decision for doing this, I'm not giving up on playing – I just want to see if the ability to have a better overview of our team and focus more on practicing myself to refine certain aspects of my play will be more beneficial to me as a player and our team moving forward.**

Thanks to all our supporters and we hope we can do better in the LCS for all our fans! I'll likely be able to stream along with the rest of the team once we're situated in the house I'll do my best to create some very educational content!**

Hi reddit,

I'm frommaplestreet, adc for Velocity eSports. If you watched the first week of LCS, you saw us grab a 1-4 record with some gutwrenching games. A couple of our games involved us jumping out to an early lead, sometimes even a substantial lead, and then not being able to close out the game and eventually losing them. It was pretty rough, but we're confident we can shore up some of our weak points in the upcoming weeks and learn how to commandingly close out games. To do this, there a few things that we definitely need improvement on - communication and synergy being the main two.

In order to best work on our communication and synergy, a team house is needed - getting us all in one place on similar schedules and working beside each other is expected to increase our quality practice and LCS match results by a large factor. And therein lies the problem: we don't have one yet. 

Since the day after our qualification we've been actively seeking a place in southern California to live, to help us get to the next level. Unfortunately, there have been several roadblocks in this process. All-star week, slow realtors, lack of credit, lack of work history, stubborn owners have all substantially slowed down what should have been a relatively clean process. The problem seems to lie in a breakdown of communication between us, an agent, another agent, and an owner. There's too many middlemen, and the gist of our request isn't being properly communicated to owners. It's been incredibly frustrating and super time consuming. So we've decided to turn to reddit for help.

What we're looking for is a house that has most or all of the following features:

* 4 bedrooms (3 bedrooms would put us at more than 2 teammates/bedroom, which would be too tight a squeeze)
* 3 bathrooms
* within ~50 miles or ~1h30m drive of Santa Monica 
* Access to extremely high-speed internet that would support 5 people streaming and playing constantly (Verizon FiOS, Time Warner Business Line, etc)
* willing to do a year or shorter lease
* **willing to work with 6 guys who have no work history, no rental history, no credit**

We are able and willing to work around price. We can pledge to be exceptionally clean. We won't throw parties. We won't be noisy. We just need to get everyone under one roof so we can take our play to the next level.

So then reddit, do you: own a vacant house in the LA area? know someone who owns a vacant house in the LA area? know a homeowner that loves eSports, and is willing to rent to a professional team? have a connection that might help us? PLEASE PM me or our team manager http://www.reddit.com/user/guitarasaurus.

A few things that I don't think will be super helpful at this point: links to listings - we've explored zillow, realtor, trulia, craigslist, padmapper, etc etc etc and the problem lies in the lack of qualifications, not the lack of listings. Realtors that you know - again, realtors have been half of the problem, we need to go directly to homeowners and landlords who are sympathetic to our situation. Money - while we are very gracious to your donation, money isn't the issue here, we've found several places well within our price range and are getting hung up on other parts of the process. Telling us to lie on the application - that's something we've ruled out as a team, it's not worth getting evicted midway through the season.

Presently, 3 of us are staying at various locations in southern California (thank you team compLexity for housing some of us temporarily!) and the other three are packing up to drive to Cali before week 2 starts. The longer this process takes, the less quality practice we get in, the more we impose on our hosts, and the sadder we become. That's why we decided to see if any of you could help us expedite this process. Any of you willing to help us will have our eternal gratitude, and maybe we can see what we can do about repaying you in more tangible ways as well.  

Sorry if the formatting is poor.

The champion reworks (Trundle and Sejuani) are on point. Their Kits feel exactly the same, their playstyle didn't change, yet the champions fit the meta much much better and have been touched in the exact spots to reach the step of viability.

The whole Freljord lore patch is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! While I never really followed the League of Legends Lore, it was mostly because it was out of the game. Now you get a little feeling of the whole thing just by playing the standard game, the Rengar-Kha'Zix rivalry was the start, and now it's getting better and better.

The little warnings you get after you've been reported some times are perfect. I know I would stop flaming and being aggressive for a while after seeing this upon logging in. Also, the new ARAM queue reduces dodgers/ragers/afk/quitters by a LOT, and getting the quick first win of the day there is awesome! 

*And now we're on my main point* ... the Howling Abyss map. The best that you've done so far. The whole package, surrounded by the Freljord feeling, just makes me happy and want to play some ARAMs. The map looks great, feels great, has awesome details that still surprise you after playing quite a few games there. The easter egg on the map ... just **WOW** it had me in shivers. I felt like the 12 year old boy taking his first steps beyond the gates of Harrogath back then. Kudos, Riot!

1361941036.0	19b5x3	Riot... Enough of this. Kick AFK people in lobby. PLEASE	RapidT	4578	2839	716	"Just went into a ranked game... My final chance for a promotion.

Got an AFK player getting randomed. Apparently he got blue screen of death'd. And his League client stayed logged in.

That alone, should automatically disconnect a player... Don't know if Riot is in control of DCing a player when something computer-related comes up, but if they are... Fix it dammit.

Even if computer issues don't arise, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason why a player who gets a random champion shouldn't get kicked out of queue and the remaining players get automatically queued up again. They might not know how to play the champion or they might have the wrong runes/masteries by default.

So yeah, that just happened. Lost my chance at a promotion because I couldn't dodge. And I get an AFK player getting randomed.

Why is such a simple concept so hard to deliver? I know I'm not the only one who suffers from this crap. Absolutely irritating how I couldn't dodge since it was the last game in my series and the player got randomed. Yes, he did relog. But he had AP runes on Rengar and proceeded to not have such a great game at all. Nobody on my team wanted to dodge. 

Riot pls. For the sake of the stupidity that comes with no dodging in your promotion series, PLEASE boot people who get randomed from champion select. I beg you. Frustrating having my fourth promotion series in a row lost because of this incidence. I always win the first two to get back to promotion then my first promotion, then I get stuck with trolls/AFKers in my must-win game(s).

/rant

TL;DR: Riot please kick AFKers for not only the sake of those of us who are at high stakes, but for everyone else, to bring the betterment of the game as a whole."	t5_2rfxx	True

1350385487.0	11kcdl	HUGE informational thread about JUNGLE CHANGES, SEASON 3 ITEM OVERHAUL,  SEASON 3 CHAMPION REMAKES, and SEASON 3 FEATURES.	MegaFoch	3486	1749	907	"**JUNGLE CHANGES ARE ON THE WAY**

The discussion about this all started with **Morello's** reply to a summoner's comments about the Jungle being too ""safe"" and the lack of being able to out farm an enemy jungler to gain some sort of advantage.



""Yes, we agree wholeheartedly with this problem. Jungle changes will happen.""
------------------------------------------------------
""Jungle changes will have a big impact on single-target junglers especially.""


**Statikk** continued to expand on the jungle changes and revealed more details of what Riot is aiming for, saying:



""We've actually been working on changes for the jungle in anticipation for Season 3 and though I can't really give all the details here because we are still iterating, I'd like to give you guys some insights into what's going on.

There are a multitude of issues we're tackling and they are very much intertwined. The current dominant jungle strategy (GP10 Support / Tanks) is fairly stagnant and the overall current jungle playstyle in many cases severely limits potential strategy and choices in other lanes/roles as well.

One large problem is that efficient farming of the jungle has very little pay off compared to constantly applying lane pressure by camping / ganking. Overall junglers severely lack in gold unless they successfully gank and snowball the game from the get-go and/or opt for a GP10 strategy.

The approach we're currently taking is to significantly increase the rewards of jungle camps over time (junglers already have a huge impact on the early game). To go along with this though, we are buffing jungle camps back up to actually be more threatening while simultaneously offering new / improved item paths that allow players to specialize in the jungle. Overall we want junglers to be rewarded for building combat stats rather than always being forced to build gold generation items.

This is not the only thing we're changing in the jungle for next season, but these types of things are definitely on our radar.""




**Statikk's** response to a Summoner commenting that this is just Riot reverting the last set of jungle changes:


""In some ways, yes, though not completely.

We aren't going all the way back to the extreme of the old jungle where you would just get crushed unless you were Warwick, but we do feel there is a happy medium between Season 1 and Season 2 that we can strike.

The biggest difference here though is that we will be offering itemization that will help champions who need that extra boost in the jungle. Champions who are already super strong in the jungle may opt to not build these items, but it's pretty interesting to see what new junglers may become viable with these new items.""
------------------------------------------------------
""Well a lot of the directional changes we're making for Season 3 are to make sure there are niches for the various jungle types.

For example, the nerfing of the jungle camps' damage really left no room for ""safe"" junglers such as Warwick since sustain was no longer a thing. Everyone can just clear with Boots + Health Pots and apply pressure to lanes.

When we do these changes for Season 3, there may be some junglers who are simply too strong in too many categories and we'll have to address that in the context of the new jungle. Overall though, we're looking to make sure there's a reason to bring X jungler over Y jungler depending on the situation.""


  

 


                                               **SEASON 3 ITEM OVERHAUL:**

**Morello**, about what support players can expect from the upcoming item overhaul:

""We are adding a lot of support-oriented items with this in mind, though, and alternate ways to get gold (cool new mastery for supports inc...). I actually don't mind zero CS - I mind that support don't get gold that they can use to buy cool items. That is what we'll fix here.

Zero CS is needed to keep support viable (it's actually always been the optimal way to play, players just didn't have that down pre S2), but they get to do a lot of other interesting things in lane like harass, peel or set up kills. Making the lane fight for CS is inferior to that.""





**Morello**, about diversifying the starting builds and moving away from the boring standard of Boots + 3 HP bots:


""Definitely looking at this - we'll be getting away from same starts.""




**Morello** remarking they are aiming to make Attack Speed / On-hit builds ( think Malady + Madred's Blood Razors ) viable:


""Actually yes - we're trying to make that a viable build.""


                                  




                                                **SEASON 3 CHAMPION REMAKES:**

**Morello** shared that Karma and Heimerdinger are the current focus regarding ability rework



  ""Some priorities have changed, as is normal, but right now our rework focus is Karma and Heimerdinger. Might revisit Kayle at another point.

And none of these will make progress till after Season 3 changes go out.""


**Morello** about a little status update on the Heimer remake:

""Xyph is working on an overhaul, but nothing to say beyond that yet. Will still be a bit.""


**Morello** about why it takes so long to complete reworks and why Riot doesn't just divert other designers to help clean up the champions who need it the most.




""This is because resource allocation is very complex. I'll give you a fast answer about it here though

Essentially, the design resources aren't as tough to get, but if it requires art (Katarina, for example) those resources are tighter. Additionally, one designer is all a project needs (and more in many cases is damaging) - IronStylus put it pretty eloquently when he said ""no matter how many mothers you throw at it, it takes nine months to make a baby.""

Testing is actually the tougher thing, which we have separate environments for. Balancing the game actually isn't more work per champion released, just requires more sophisticated analysis. So things like Season 3 do impact reworks, but new champions really don't effect it - we just hired enough people to do both (since champions are cool and important too). We actually just added more to a ""reworks team"" also to increase this output.

Could we do anything faster if we literally dropped everything and only did that? Sure, but the cost/benefit of only doing that would be pretty silly. Game development is all about this kind of thing.""







                                                  **SEASON 3 FEATURES:**


**rjcombo** made mention that Riot will be aiming to improve the ladder system, although unclear whether he means something new all together or just an implementation of the ladder into the game client, as it's currently only available by going to the LoL website


""I did reveal several features we're actively working on in an earlier post in this thread, but one thing I forgot to mention is ranked play. We aren't satisfied with the current state of the ladders, and will be making improvements to that aspect of the game.""




**rjcombo** on a built in voice chat feature for League.


""We've done some research on this and are not convinced native VOIP is highly valuable for improving the community experience, especially when the players communicating are strangers. For players who are familiar with each other, there is already a host of great 3rd party solutions for voice.

That's not to say we'll never add VOIP to the game. It's just not a high priority.""



**rjcombo** also spoke very briefly about the a possibility of seeing an achievement system in S3

&gt;""It's unlikely we'll have achievements for the start of Season 3, but maybe during the season. I can't make any promises. What I can say is, if we add an achievements system, we'll be very focused on making sure players aren't encouraged to do silly things to earn rewards""






I'm sorry for the formatting, I might edit it during the day. Trying to make it more aired but saving it just clumps it up :( .



edit1: 

   
                         **Mastery Changes for Season 3**



**Morello** mentioned:

""In Season 3, we'll be doing a series of mastery changes (much like what we saw for Season 2). FeralPony and I will be giving more details once it's a bit more locked down.



                                     **Champion Scale**

Why some champions are so much taller or scaled up than others, like how absurdly tall new Soraka is and the difference in overall size between Pentakill Sona and other Sonas as specific examples.



**RiotNarya** said:

""Yup, we are aware and are planning to equalize the champs so the lineup makes sense from a scale perspective. Many of the champs are, in fact, off scale. Compare MF to some of the Sona models for example. Those are both female champs of approximately the same height, etc. and they are very different. Don't have an exact timeline but it's on the radar!""

1376425487.0	1kav8m	Zed Ultimate Skin: Awaken	Magnam_Dei	5043	3302	551	"So basically if you have read the Zed lore you should know that Zed starts off like Shen, as an honorable ninja. However in trying to gain an advantage over Shen Zed learns the way of the shadow. I thought it would be a cool idea for  Zed to start off the game in white monk/ninja like robes and a sword like Shen but golden. He would throw white ninja stars and his shadow slash would be a 360 sword slash (also golden). Not much changes at level 6, only his shadow doesn't follow his exact movements anymore. Once he hits level 11 his robes become torn and his face is visible. He now throws dark shadows mixed with light instead of ninja stars. His shadow slash is also dark mixed with gold. Then at level 16 he literally becomes completely dark, a shadow of his former self.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stage Voice Changes:
Level 1: Calm voice, words of wisdom and justice.

Level 6: Confused powerful voice, voice changes between his shadow and himself

Level 11: Conflicting voice, dialogue of him battling his Shadow

Level 16: Angry voice, messages of silent destruction and death.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Living Shadow:

Level 1-5: Summons Shen (since this would be before their conflict) also this Shen would look different than the Champion Shen we see in games, because this would be before Shen became the Eye of Twilight.

Level 6-10: Summons a dark/gold shadow of himself

Level 11 - 15: Summons a ghostly shadow of his former self

Level 16 - 18: Summons a ghostly shadow of his current form

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transformations:

Level 6: Zed roars and his shadow behind him comes alive

Level 11: Darkness tears at his robes

Level 16: Darkness Surges up from the ground and engulfs Zed. His Shadow laughs.

You think getting a penta after 35 minutes of afk farming top is the best thing ever? Hell, I guess you've never played support then. To provide a little more insight into a support's life in Summoner's Rift, I tried to compile a little list of the most awesome jizz in my pants feelings there are:

* The enemy support wards the lane brush and you and your AD Carry manage to destroy the ward right away

* You meet the enemy support in the river, and he's trying to pink your pink. You manage to destroy his freshly placed pink faster and your own prevails

* You get the whole wraith camp for yourself

* You have 2 gp10s and boots at the 15 minute mark [sic]

* You get focussed by the enemy bot lane (more of a masochist-like good feeling, but your AD will probably walk away with a double kill)

* The AD Carry brings a ward to the lane as he sees that you can't afford any at the moment

* Your AD carry survives with about 10 hp because of your clutch shield/heal/peel

* THE BRUSH IS YOURS! The enemy support doesn't even dare stepping in there anymore. That's my territory now and I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I please in there (mostly walking back and forth and in and out)!

* There are 2 enemy wards in the range of a single pink ward from you.


* You somehow manage to get hold of a blue buff. Hands down, this is the greatest thing ever.

Today I got banned because some guy decided he does not like me and told all his friends to report me on sight. It's the person that was jungling in both cases, and due to the nature of high Elo I unfortunately meet him quite often. Now I knew that he was trying to provoke me throughout the games because that would make it easier for him to construe a fake context to base his and his friends reports around so I barely even said anything in chat. I got unlucky to end up in a game with some of his friends in both my and the enemy team. They were constantly harassing me in chat to try and get a response that would make me being punished by the tribunal more likely. Also note how the enemy team reports me for ""flaming nunu"" when I don't even say a single thing in allchat.


Apparently doing bad in one game coupled with people trashtalking you in chat without you falling for their provocations is enough to warrant being banned. There's clearly something wrong with the tribunal if a case like this gets punished solely based on the number of reports without bothering to check the actual circumstances.

Instead of describing it myself, I'll copy and paste the contents of a letter he emailed to Riot, so he can explain it himself:

&gt;Dear Riot staff,

&gt;I'm sure you're aware of the shooting at an elementary school in Connecticut. While the guns may be the main focus in the media, and gun laws should be addressed, mental illness has not yet been appropriately acknowledged. Since mental illness plays such a large role in many violent crimes it is surprising that we have not enacted significant reforms, or launched a visible campaign riding on an event like this.

&gt;I implore you to take just 3 minutes out of your day to view this story.

&gt;http://anarchistsoccermom.blogspot.com/2012/12/thinking-unthinkable.html

&gt;There is an established need for more mental illness support services, and I think your company could help, while producing some good publicity.

&gt;**I propose a campaign similar to the one based off the Nurse Akali skin, in which proceeds from purchasing the champion Nami, or one of her skins, would go towards a donation to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI http://www.nami.org/).** I believe that, besides helping suffering families and endearing you to consumers, this might also have the added benefit of bringing Riot into the national spotlight.
&gt;CBS news has brought up the fact that the shooter was a gamer (http://cbsn.ws/TT5yag). In addition to bringing good publicity to your company, this fundraiser would also humanize the gaming community.

&gt;Thank you very much,

&gt;[Redacted]

We would really like to hear your thoughts about this. In addition, we posted this on GD forums, so if you want to check it out there too, [here is the link](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2909883).

PrimeBG	3241	1533	269	"I don't know about you guys,but although the system seems ""unfair"" the fact that summoners get contacted only if they get banned casts a large impact on how the tribunal is perceived.

For example - a person has same (toxic) attitude in game for the period of 3-4 months. He may get on the tribunal 3-4-5 times and gets pardoned, but on the 5th time he gets banned with the usual ""10 reports in 5 games"" of the sort. Now this player thinks ""damn, I don't deserve this.. I have been way more toxic in previous games without punishment and they ban me for this? F the tribunal""...

Now, sending an email when someone ends up on the tribunal may as well make most (at least the ones that would like to improve their behavior) take it as a wake-up call. ""Oh, damn.. I was close.. better watch my mouth next time"".

I do believe that, ""oh the tribunal pardoned me... there is some hope in the system after all"" should help the community. 

Getting banned for 2 weeks most often than not makes the summoner rather more frustrated with the system and with the community in general.

After all, let's bring something positive into the notorious tribunal?

What do you guys think?

Prime

Edit: This is a comment I wrote down (showing my reasoning behind this) so I'll just add it to the edit section:

Doesn't matter what the percentage is. It is important that to receive an email for when you get pardoned. 
My reasoning is that in real life, people often rethink their actions and reactions when they have had a close call.  Like picture this:

You are a student right? Spending thousands of $ (or your parents do) for education in a prestigious university.

One night you get drunk out of your mind (don't say I don't do that, we all do) and you do something very stupid and get caught my the police. (By all means I do not mean murder someone or any of that sort) and then is when you start putting things into perspective. 

I.e. - I am a student, I do this to invest in my future and now if I have a criminal record that investment goes down the drain (Not sure how it is in the US but in the UK you cannot get a job without the recruiter investigating your criminal history). You picture it and you realise it is something caused by a drunken behavior with no intentions of escalating that much.

The police levels with you and gives you a warning - in other words you are pardoned. At this very moment you realise how close you were to ruining it all and you are rather thankful for the 2nd chance you get. 

Obviously this is a very very very extreme example but if you scale it down and apply it to people that actually care if they play the game or not it could apply. "	t5_2rfxx	True

No item has a better fit anywhere on anyone than the Hydra on Pokeplank. Gangpoke? Too sexual? Anyhow, it's the stuff that the stuff of legends is made of. Do it! Don't read on. Just go play Gang ""The Hydra"" Plank right now. Thanks for reading.  

You want reasons? What, like, *facts* to support this obviously true statement? Fuck you and okay, here's why:  

1. **Parrrrrley procs Hydra's AoE passive.**  
We might have lost 6 Tiamat Fiora, but Hydra on a ranged ability with 5 seconds cooldown is *at least* 7 times more awesomer.  

2. **Hydra's use effect stacks Tear of the Goddess.**  
As if you need more than the first reason, here's some icing on your breakfast muffin. Muramana is the knees of several bees on Gangplank and now that you know to build Hydra, you can stack your tear up almost twice as fast while you sit at fountain, waiting to be able to afford your stuff.  

3. **Parrrrley crits = Hydra crits.**  
Could Tiamat Fiora Ult crit? No and yet everyone who played her got 3k Elo and a Mustang from Riot with custom Tiamat rims. Gangplank already has 99% crit chance from Trinity Force and Infinity Edge, so why not make those crits hit everyone currently in the immediate vicinity of Summoner's Rift?  
THE SYNERGY IS ALREADY BLOWING YOUR BALLS OFF, HUH?!  

4. **Hydra, Tri-force and IE? That's ""1%"" expensive and I'm not Froggen ""CLG Trustfund"" Jones.**  
That's just because you're apathetic, lethargic and garrulous. Hydra on Gangplank is cruise control to 300 CS at 19 minutes. When you land your 2500 crit Parrrrrrleys, you get the gold bonus for every creep you kill with that 1 shot.Ravenous Hydra is designed to allowed Plankie to afford everything he wants.  
Don't tell Riot.  

Ravenous Hydra, Muramana, Statikk Shiv, IE, Trinity Force, Boots of Running real Fast. Take whichever runes and masteries you feel best accentuate your Parrrrrrleying. Bind Q to your entire keyboard and watch as your 370 AD, 55% crit Gang ""Fellon in 12 states"" Plank brings the entire enemy team and their childhood pets to their knees in a single, Shiv-proccing, Muramana-infused, Spellblade-empowered, 250% Parrrrrrrely crit.

THAT'S ALL YOU GET FROM ME. 

You see it now? You see how you have wasted your time reading this, when you could already have orphaned several hundred purple minion children? I'm injecting myself with designer drugs right now to get over the withdrawal I feel from writing this instead approaching the theoretical maximum amount of non-stop, no-mercy, no-consent bullet-insertion in a vacuum.

1369663774.0	1f4yba	Vi's sister; a theory	Twibs	4230	2529	739	"In the Howling Abyss we hear, from the purple shopkeeper that Vi has a sister. After a bit of thought and projection from other mediums, primarily DC comics, I think I've come to a conclusion.

**Assumptions made:** someone in the Riot design team is a DC comic fan.

_________________________

We hear that Vi grew up in Piltover, but there is no mention of parents or siblings; it is safe to assume she is an orphan. 

We learn from her lore that she is very technologically apt, as well as having 'street smarts' and above-average physical ability. 

She begins life as a criminal, but starts to work for the side of the law (albeit using 'unconventional' methods.)

From this I have come to the conclusion that Vi's sister is Sona.

_______________

*Wat.*

_______________

This is where the assumption comes heavily into play - in DC comics there is a character known as **Ravager V** - Rose Wilson. She has above-average physical ability including strength, agility and is highly skilled in hand to hand combat. Once a mercenary, she exhibits antisocial attitude and violence, but now fights on the side of good.

_________

*umm*

_________

The point of this though, is that Rose Wilson had a brother; Joseph Wilson aka Jericho. Jericho was **a prodigial musician in his childhood**, but had his throat slit and was **rendered mute** as a result. While a skilled fighter, he preferred the use of **non-violent means**. He also inherited the ability to astrally project himself and control the motor functions of an enemy - similar to how Sona's music immobilises hers.

This is where I see a parallel to Sona - as well as the shopkeeper saying they look similar, which may just be being sarcastic but... [blue eyes and similar facial structure...](http://i.imgur.com/CzX315L.jpg)

________

*That's a bit of a stretch*

Quiet you

*Bite me*

______________

This is all well and good, but what could possibly link these 2 minor characters from the DC universe to the interspersed lore of LoL? Well, also you may have guessed from the similar surname, their father; Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke.

Deathstroke has a superhuman intellect as well as enhanced physical abilities which he **gained from a serum** he was injected with - and subsequently injected Rose with to grant her these qualities.

As well as his **superhuman strength, endurance, speed and intellect**, he has the ability of **regeneration at a greatly accelerated rate**, which grants him **immunity to poisons and illnesses**. [Sound familiar?](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/7/77/Singed_OriginalSkin.jpg)

To add to this, in Singed's lore it mentions that his first act as Zaun's head chemist was in Ionia - **where Sona was originally found and raised** - and that he was not particularly ethical when it came to finding test subjects. And strangely enough, just north-west of Zaun we find the city of Piltover, where a certain girl grew up. My theory is while Sona was left in Ionia, Singed perhaps took some *subjects* back to Zaun for trials.

And this last one is just for fun, but Deathstroke was also a member of the injustice league - another member of which Lex Luthor; notably a man of [**Genius-level intellect and incredibly skilled businessman**](http://competitive.tr.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_page_full/public/DrMundo_Splash_3.jpg), and Cheetah, whose power is to transform from [Human to Cheetah form, gaining enhanced strength](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/0/03/Nidalee_LeopardSkin_Ch.jpg).

_____________

TL:DR - Sona and Vi are sisters, whose powers are a result of Singed's chemical testing.

The new champion would continue on with the Level and Experience as the old champion, possibly even the same weapons (or a gold refund of all the previous champions equipment).  

Once a champion died, that champion is unusable by the team for the remainder of the match. 

With 100+ champions - this would ensure that in a long match, you would see lots of unique champion combinations. 

Start the match as Ashe, get ganked early, come back as Teemo.  If you die as Teemo, being forced to choose another hero that has not yet been summoned yet - some other AD carry, or pick a completely different champion to mix it up.  Come back as Alistar or an AP hero. 

Just a fun thought for a new mode-type. You'd see more champions and variety.  You might see forced ganks to get rid of certain champions.

 I never liked (lore wise) that summoners only ever summon one champion for an entire match.  I feel like if I was a magical summoner, I should be able to summon and unsummon units as I please!

The short answer is, because they're the closest. I'm not going to stop auto attacking, I'm going to put out damage. The long answer is usually something along the lines of 'because I can't walk through a tank line that wants me dead'. And yes, tanks can do damage to your ADC, as do the tanky bruisers. Enough damage infact, that by the time your ADC gets to the enemy carries, they'd get burst in a second.

I know I'm not the only one who has had to explain this to belligerent ally bruisers and tanks. Ones especially focused on 'squishies' are usually the ones who leave their carries to be chased down by tanks and bruisers, then ask with genuine curiosity 'why did you focus the tank'?

So please, unless your carry is really messing up, don't yell at them for hitting whoever is closest.

Thank you for your time

Makee 

From Societyannoysme

&gt;I'll try finding the Riot post, but a designer explicitly said that the humanoid phase is over, or, at least, they're going to tone down on it from here on.

&gt;E: Found it. It's in response to the whole ""females in costumes"", or, humaoids:

&gt;""So.. we talkin' Anivia 'n such as well? There's a few things in the works that would qualify here. I myself am very much for pushing the boundaries in what we'd consider monstrous females. In my opinion we probably could have gone crazier with Zyra and Elise especially. We've milked the ""girl in a costume"" thing pretty dry and we need to look towards character design rather than costume design. We'll certainly still have women in costume, but I'd personally like us to push past the human barrier if we're going to do monster/creature females.

&gt;One of the reasons that I'd love us to not be relegated to humanoids for such female creatures is that characters like Zyra and Elise can be problematic when making skins. There's not a ton of features or large distinguishing parts of their bodies that can serve as landmarks for change. If we're unable to make some distinct silhouette or fairly massive internal detail breakups, the changes in the skin don't end up feeling as impactful.

&gt; So yeah. There's some stuff in the works. I think it fits the bill, but it'll probably be a while for the pipeline to spit it all out.""

Orange_Astronaut	2926	1236	457	"Will this be fixed for Season 3? It is absolutely ridiculous that a ""competitive"" game would punish 4 players of a team instead of the one who leaves. 

Riot has commented on this in the past, but it is still an issue that needs to be dealt with for the coming Season.

Why is this still in the game, and when will this be fixed? Kick the person who AFKs and prevent them from joining another game for 30 minutes. Don't force the 9 remaining players to choose to either play a lopsided game (and probably a loss for the team of 4) or have someone dodge and take the penalty for their team.

**TL;DR AFKers in Champion Select should be punished as dodgers and removed from Queue for 30 minutes instead of being randomed a champion and still allowing the game to start.**

I mean, I thought the trade sign should only show up when both players have both champions, why do this happen every single time I play? How should I be able to know who I actually can trade with? DAMN!

EDIT: Many have misunderstood my post and going to say ""this happens when we play ARAM"" and we do hope for a perfection for that trade option, or else don't even enable it. Another thing is I've asked the players if they actually not own a certain champion when the error comes up, and they actually don't.

1362510384.0	19q0vd	Something really awesome that happened during a ranked Soloq yesterday.	Brokenshard7	3843	2165	618	"So yesterday evening I was playing some soloq, I ended up getting into a game with a Khazix top on my side vs a Rengar top on the side. I thought to myself, oh, interesting, maybe that ""the hunt is on"" quest will come up. I didn't actually think it would, so I dismissed the thought. The game started creeping towards late game, and suddenly Khazix dings 16 and the sidequest pops: The hunt is on. I was shocked. The game, which was sort of going in their favor (was still close) instantly became extremely intense. Their rengar wasn't that tanky, but he did pack quite a punch, and our khazix was relatively strong. The next three teamfights were pretty much our team protecting our khazix and their team protecting their rengar. Rengar ended up barely killing our khazix, but at the cost of their team getting aced and netting us a solid advantage. Both teams agreed that it was worth the rush of adrenaline, the game was intense! We all loved it.


The side quest idea was great, but I'm pretty sure we can further this without giving anyone a physical advantage like the Rengar/Khazix one. There are plenty friend/enemy relationships in league that can put out a sort of pseudo sidequest/alternative scenario in games that could make it really interesting. An example would be kayle vs morgana. At level 11 a similar side quest appears, however, the prize of besting the enemy would be a visual upgrade. For example, if Kayle kills Morgana she becomes a shining beacon of light, glowing white, all of her abilities gaining a new visual feature. Vice versa for morgana, she becomes a demonic twisted monstrosity of darkness, with her spells becoming even more visually demoralizing. 


What do you guys think of this? I feel this could not only better the gaming experience by adding a fun alternative, but also deepen the lore surrounding league of legends as well as incorporate it into the game without completely throwing it off balance.

Dyrus	5852	4178	925	"Now for the last 3 years though I haven't really brought it up as frequently, Christmas is around the corner and I haven't asked for much for Christmas but as I thought about it and one significant thing popped up in my mind.

**League of Legends Announcer Packs**

Once in a blue moon for the last three years, I have suggested to a few Rioters, my own fans, and people in general that we should have announcer packs! For example: Jax: ""Double kill."" just picture that in your mind as you play your favorite character, it brings a new stimulation of satisfaction in playing league of legends itself.

As a gamer all my life, one of the most important things for video games were audio, for example; ""Hey, Jayce, Power slam!"" from Vi. Interactions, taunts, laughs, jokes, bluepill animations just makes the game so much cooler. I even changed my language pack to the korean sounds/in-game text just to feel like I'm playing a completely different game.

Now I don't know if there is a story behind every announcer (every region) or why we haven't had these announcer packs or if it's because it isn't seen as a higher priority, or if there's any reasoning for keeping the same announcer for the last two years and a half but I just thought, over and over again, this would be a great idea to maintain people's addiction to the game. I wouldn't even mind hearing Phreak have a soundpack where it'll be like ""Tons of damage!"" for a penta kill.

**TLDR**
I would drop 50 bucks on just for a choice of a new announcer, it would be beneficial for mostly everyone in general.
**This is only a suggestion that has been poking me in the brain for a very long time. I have even made petitions to see what people think and I have finally reached my ""Wits end"" in thinking about this subject.**

Thanks for reading.

1366673064.0	1cwbtt	Gentleman Cho'gath and Brolaf are not legendary skins.	nigeriansexlord	3520	1848	525	"&gt;http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/new-skin-prices-balance-update-map-specific-champion-changes-the-end-of-quinns-journey-and-more-7309/

By riots own definition a legendary skin should ""feature a new model, textures and splash image as well as completely new animations, visuals, voice over and sounds.""
Gentleman Cho'gath does not have new spell animations and simply has a Voice over and Visual change.
This applies to Brolaf as well as the only spell animation change is his Undertow which would have looked ridiculous had they not made the minor change.

According to Riot's own tier list these two skins belong in the 1350 RP as they ""go above and beyond the quality of 975 RP skins but don’t quite reach legendary status."" 

Solution? Revisit these skins and add spell visual upgrades to make them worth the 1820 RP or simply abide by your tier system and put these skins where they belong and refund players who have bought them as 'legendary skins' 470 rp.

TL;DR- Gentleman Cho'gath and Brolaf are not worth 1820 and belong in the 1350 skin tier.

1372281504.0	1h4vgm	7-point Criticism of the New Draven Passive	magzillas	4368	2704	981	"I don't think there's much room for argument that Draven's laning phase is pretty stupidly strong.  Now, I was always in the camp that his strong lane was a tradeoff for his comparatively difficult teamfighting, and I do find it interesting that Draven's a problem when there are champions that Riot has explicitly described as ""lane bullies"" in their respective spotlights that are apparently perfectly kosher.

But I digress.  The point of this post is not to contest that Draven is or isn't OP.  Rather, in my view, Riot's solution of the ""adoration"" passive is seriously flawed from a number of angles.  While humorous, and certainly in line with Draven's intentionally ridiculous, over-the-top design, Adoration serves not simply as a nerf to the Lanes of Draven, but a problematic, and potentially frustrating, replacement to wicked blades.

For those who aren't in the know:

&gt; **Adoration:** Whenever you kill a minion or catch a spinning axe, you gain a stack of adoration (from Draven's fans who I guess are watching from an overhead dirigible).  When you kill a champion, you cash in half your stacks for 3g per stack.  You lose half your stacks when you die.

I'll try to keep my criticisms as organized as possible.

----------------------------------------------

**Problem 1: It compounds reward with reward.**

* If you're not getting kills, the passive is doing nothing for you.

* If you are getting kills, then the passive compounds an advantage you already likely have.  While useful, to me it seems like this would exacerbate a snowball effect.

-------------------------------------------------

**Problem 2: It compounds detriment with detriment.**

* Losing half of your stacks on death is perhaps what I despise most about this new passive.

* You're already out several CS and experience because you died.  But this passive adds insult to injury by ditching half your stacks.  That's real fun, right?

* You might say ""Magzillas, thou art a righteous nooblord!  Cho'Gath's feast is similarly designed!""  But Cho's R has a critical function outside of its stacking (true damage burst).  Draven's passive is purely for gold generation, and to me, there's nothing fun about losing half the stacks you worked for when you die when the stacks are literally all it has going for it.

* Inhibits the ability of this passive to serve a comeback purpose.  In such a situation, you are likely in a position where you have died a lot and/or been zoned out of CS, so your stack count will likely be low if you ever do manage a kill.

-----------------------------------------------

**Problem 3: It leads to a dead end.**

* This is a problem also present, albeit to a lesser degree, on Zilean and TF passives (everyone is level 18; everyone is at 6 items).

* This passive is designed such that it will become useless when the Draven hits 6 items and full consumables.

* It's a bit of an extreme scenario, but I think serious reservations are to be had for passives that by design eventually become meaningless.
 
-------------------------------------------------

**Problem 4: It means nothing to the Draven playstyle.**

* Wicked Blades wasn't the most interesting passive, but at least you could work with it (e.g. putting a couple stacks on someone and letting them bleed to death instead of risking a tower dive).

* Other champions typically have a passive that is integral to their design or playstyle, or serves a useful utility (e.g., Annie, Darius, Tristana, Viktor)

* All Adoration does is make the Draven want to get kills...but that's no different than what Draven already wants to do.

---------------------------------------------

**Problem 5: It doesn't make any sense.**

* A typical champion passive involves something intrinsic and self-contained within the champion.  

* Apparently we're now in the Hunger Games, and Draven has a bunch of sponsors showering him with money from their VIP Summoner's Rift Observation Blimp.

* Basically, where the fizz is this gold coming from?

* Admittedly, this is a little nitpicky.

-----------------------------------------------

**Problem 6: The arguments for Adoration, as opposed to rebalancing Wicked Blades, are inconsistent with precedent.**

* I've heard three main arguments supporting adoration as opposed to a wicked blades rebalance.

* The first is that a **rebalanced wicked blades would do nearly nothing early game and that apparently that's no fun.**  But this apparently isn't a problem for Xerath, Tristana, Gragas, or Syndra, whose level 1 passives give them a whopping ~5 armor, nothing, ~12 health over 4 seconds on spellcast, and nothing, respectively.

* The second is that **Adoration leads to super feel-good moments when you kill someone and get a bunch of gold.**  Yea, I guess, but you know what else feels good?  Killing someone from the last tick of wicked blades, or grabbing a CS thanks to the bleed.  And as mentioned, losing half your adoration stacks as you stare at your death screen definitely does NOT feel good.

* The third is that **Adoration can be balanced because ""there is a value where its underpowered, and a value where its overpowered, so there has to be a balanced value somewhere in the middle.""**  You could apply that exact same logic to wicked blades.

----------------------------------------------

**Problem 7: It kills the fundamental theme of the blood brothers. (Draven and Darius)**

* Keyword is blood.

* New passive does not involve blood.

* Draaaaven is not pleased.

* See [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/fpck2zV.png) submitted by /u/Baalhrezem

-----------------------------------------------

**Some potential solutions**

So, now that I've voiced my concerns, I'll throw out a couple quick ideas that I think would be better suited to Draven.

* Retain wicked blades with early-game nerf.  Adjust spinning axe to interact with wicked blades, such as dealing more damage to targets already afflicted with wicked blades.  This not only makes the passive more noticeable and integral to Draven's playstyle, but it also means he has to commit more in order to put out substantial damage in lane trades.

* Convert wicked blades from a static value to a value based off of Draven's bonus AD.

* Replace wicked blades with part of blood rush.  E.g., Draven gains stacking attack or move speed as he catches spinning axes.  Adjust blood rush accordingly.  

* If we're really dead-set on keeping adoration, at least let Draven cash in some stacks on an assist.  At the moment, I think it's too all-or-nothing for him to cash in stacks on kill only, and lose half on death.

-------------------------------------------------

**Acknowledgment:**  This critique is meant to be constructive.  I can certainly appreciate that Riot is addressing a balance issue with Draven, and only mean to express my view that the solution they have selected is not optimal.

**Thanks for all the solutions and alternative workarounds to finding when a channel is actually live. The spark for this thread, was me clicking into Niens stream when it said live, only 90 minutes later to see it was a VOD. Live symbol doesn't always seem accurate.**

*Also worth noting ""need to move away"" might have been overreaction at the time, I fully appreciate there is contractual commitments in place and there is no possability to ""move away"" if even required. UI rework seems like a quick and easy solution.* "	t5_2rfxx	True

This weekend me and a couple of friends were at Dreamhack Summer. Another friend of ours who is a huge fan of xPeke, wanted us to hug xPeke from him. Obviously, this would be too weird to do, so we decided to ask if we could lift him and then tell our friend that we carried xPeke. Harry Wigget, Fnatic's manager, was okay with that and so was xPeke so we did it, and for some reason we continued doing it with all the LCS midlaners. People seemed to think it was a fun idea and even Deman, qu1ksh0t, Sjokz and Rachel agreed to get carried!


We would like to thank everyone for taking these pictures with us. It was really fun and it was amazing to see how open-minded the players and Deman, qu1ksh0t, Sjokz and Rachel are with their fans. It was awesome meeting every single one of them. 


If there will be another event at Dreamhack, would you guys like to see anything similar to this? Something like botlanes, junglers, toplaners or even managers? Any suggestions are more than welcome, we're sure that you can come up with something!

1372425683.0	1h8vb7	An idea to make Twin Shadows (Spooky Ghosts) more viable.	UziNidalee	3270	1610	458	"Hello, I came up with an idea how to possibly make Twin Shadows even more viable without it being OP. So here it is:


**What if the Spooky Ghosts from Twin Shadows dealt 1 true damage?** You may ask, what's the point of that?

**Well, as you know if you deal damage to a person who is recalling it will stop the recall; so now imagine a clutch game with inhibitors down on both sides. Your team is pushing enemy base and you're a support trying to stop enemies from recalling!? Quick, pop your Spooky Ghosts and deny the game-saving recall and let your team grab that victory!** I think that would be a cool idea and it would give more use to an awesome Twin Shadows item.


Let me know what you think!


Edit: It would allow more compensation for such a long cooldown (3 minutes) that Twin Shadow already has


Edit 2: Thanks everyone for your contribution, the reason why I thought about this idea is because I really love the item and I feel like this would be a nice QoL change and Twin Shadows could be utilised more. :)

Edit 3: People saying that it would be cool if you got a kill with it, but that's pretty impossible since pretty much all the champions have a passive health regen of 1 health per second :P"	t5_2rfxx	True

- One ping &gt; two pings &gt; more pings
- Complete Map overhaul updates (SR,TT)
- New gaming modes (Dominion, ARAM)
- Changes to the ranked system 
- Rework of champs (Xin, Eve, Karma)
- Visual Upgrades (Annie, Nid, etc...etc...etc..)
- New items and new shop
- Kicking people who don't select champ (Now in PBE)
- Replays (PBE)
- *Colorblind mode*

The list can go on and on and on. Truth is, RIOT listens to their community and they work hard to implement the good suggestions to make the game better. I graduated from college not long ago and have been working for a tech company and hope to work for a company like Riot that cares as much for their community. 

THANKS RIOT and everyone for their input and feedback.

**** Sorry for all questions that haven't been answered I'll try to do that as soon as I can. I've added chipin for donations for better server so we can add more features and not get overloaded (it's my friends paypal - my country doesn't have paypal :( ) ****

**** Would like to apologize to _Jabe since I've expressed myself wrong - I didn't want to call SpectateAnyone app unverified app - I just wanted to say ppl don't like windows apps that aren't code signed with a certificate, are usually developed by one person, and aren't really popular. ****

With my online tool you can spectate anyone you wish(even on another server, and you don't need to have them in your friends). I don't know why my thread keeps getting down voted, and why 1 disappeared, and there is no negative comments on the tool, only good comments. 

Please check it out: http://spectate.us

If it doesn't work when you click on spectate that's because your lrf protocol isn't linked to lol client. You can just install lol recorder and it will do that automatically for you.

edit: and again, as soon as I post it and ppl start to upvote it rising stories don't work... strange... :))

edit2: woah, didn't expect so many visitors, I hope API calls for server won't reach their upper limit...

edit3: if visitors trend continues I'm gonna have to get a new server for this one. O.o

edit4: for 'Not Found' errors -&gt; looks like we reached an upper API call limit. I will have to contact someone to get it higher, or will have to set the restrictions on clients even lower(didn't expected so much visitors per second, and didn't expect to get on front page, looks like I underestimated reddit) :(

edit5: heading to sleep soon, gotta get up for work. Not found error should be fixed now - good guys at Elophant provided us with unlimited calls, and again to answer a question about ""Dyrus"" - I don't know why he is not found...

Some of you may readily recognize the name 3xecutioner as he is often playing in the featured spectator games on the front page of the client. He was permabanned earlier this week, and I think the story is a little interesting.

For those of you that can't access the forums, or don't want to read through 55 pages of GD, the story goes a little something like this. 3xec gets permabanned with no previous warnings or suspensions. My understanding is that he has received 2 e-mails. The first was the standard ""you have been banned,"" but the second, which in this case is supposed to give a detailed explanation of the unique beast that is a permaban (Lyte has stated that all permabans are accompanied with a unique Riot explanation), was just another form letter.

3xec claims in the thread that he has opened 2 support tickets, both of which have been closed with no resolution.

This whole thing is further complicated by 3xec's claim within this thread that one of his final games before being banned was played with Riot employees, one of which he claims raged at him for failing to play Blitz effectively.

So far, 4 days have passed since the initial ban with no report card, support response, or Riot response on the forums. I should make it clear that I have no affiliation at all with 3xec, it's just an interesting topic that I think needs some more attention. 

Surely we don't have ALL the information, it's just an interesting case that I would love to hear some discussion on, and maybe you guys can comb the thread for any relevant details I've missed (there are almost assuredly some). 

EDIT: I'm not sure when it was moved to the tribunal section to the forums, but it was (out of general discussion). This quite obviously gives it less exposure as more people browse GD. Additionally, I'm not sure how this move makes any sense since this was in NO WAY a tribunal related ban. As far as we know, the tribunal had absolutely no involvement in this decision. Curious.

EDIT 2: Just got removed from front page. zzzzzzzz. There might be one incoming anyway, but I'd really appreciate a mod response as to why this was removed from not only the front page, but the top post ON the front page. 

EDIT 3: Just received this message from the mods. ""The reason this was removed from the front page is because: Don't make accusations without sufficient evidence to back up your claim. Witch hunt."" Which is weird because, ya know, I didn't make any accusations, and no one is being witch hunted. A quest for more information, for a response, is not a witch hunt. The direction the comments have taken is not only something I have no control over, but it's the community's voice. The mods just removed a post that took top post on front page in an hour and a half. But there's no Riot-reddit collusion going on...

EDIT 4: It appears we've been reinstated? 

EDIT 5: And we're down again. Color me confused. Witch Hunt- An investigation carried out ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but actually used to harass and undermine those with differing views. Really? That's what I was doing?

EDIT 6: Come talk about this whole witch hunt thing. It's another self-post, no karma-whoring, just discussion. http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13fn0v/regarding_our_definition_of_witch_hunt/

1365651976.0	1c43rv	Draven's Spinning Axe to be reverted; Volty reflects on his design decisions	RiotVolty	2795	1173	475	"Summoners,
I'd like to go in-detail with some recent changes to Draven's Spinning Axe and what you can expect in 3.6 (barring major disasters and other issues which would delay the change).  TLDR: We're reverting axe placement to be like it was on release.  But I'd like to take an opportunity to share some thoughts and details with you on this.

Patch 3.5 included these two changes to Draven's Spinning Axe:

Spinning Axe
Now leads Draven more accurately when he is benefiting from Movement Speed increases
Axe drop location will no longer be placed partially inside walls / terrain

The first change modified the calculation for how far to lead Draven when he moves after throwing the Spinning Axe. In particular, the goal was to permit Draven to run really far between throwing and catching a Spinning Axe and have the system lead you accurately. I was inclined toward finding ways for Draven to make huge plays, and I saw this change as supporting that. I was also frustrated whenever I had an axe fall short of me, and this was aimed at making that much less common.

With these goals in mind, the new formula utilized your actual movement speed, including any temporary changes to it.  It was now sensitive to usage of Blood Rush, Ghost, and the like.  In contrast, the calculation employed at Draven's release only looked at your base movement speed and flat modifiers from things like boots.  The release formula was much more consistent, something which I valued when I first developed it. But since then I felt that I could sacrifice consistency in favor of giving Draven players more control.

In any case, the result was that the new formula did in fact lead you really far when that was what was necessary to let you run in a straight line but still catch the Spinning Axe.  In all other situations, however, it often lead you too far for you to realistically catch or want to catch if it was so far away. We were aware, prior to shipping the change, that this was generally going to be the result. I did not anticipate that this was the incorrect thing to do at the time however.

Draven players have been very talented in developing playstyles which are suited to the particulars of how Draven has worked since his release. Most notably, the relatively short distance which axes would ever lead you allowed for time to do other things between throwing an axe and catching it. Most often this meant being able to throw an additional autoattack or Spinning Axe while the first was in the air.

The change in 3.5 was very disruptive to this playstyle, and I don't think offered enough potential for skilled Draven players to outperform themselves through covering long distances between throwing and catching. After receiving feedback from players and observing the results on live servers, we have been motivated to revert the change. I apologize for the present state of Draven on live and look forward to restoring his functionality at the soonest opportunity, which is likely the 3.6 patch.

This series of events has caused me to reflect on how I might do things differently in the future. For one, I have learned to be very careful with changes like this. Spinning Axe is incredibly dependent on muscle memory and feel, so once players have gotten accustomed to a specific configuration I need to be very cautious about changing it. I also think we could have let this one cook on the PBE (public beta environment) for longer and I could have been more proactive about soliciting feedback from that source. 

One final note: the second patch note, that the axe drop location won't fall partially inside terrain, is still going to be in effect. I think this is all upside. Furthermore, we have also now blocked the Spinning Axe destination from falling on the opposite side of terrain. This was much requested and long overdue, and I'm excited to get that out to you ASAP.

Thanks everyone for your feedback and patience. See you in the League of Draven soon!

Volty

For many people silver is a joke but for me it's a crowning achievement to finally be able to reach it, even if it's silver 5! 

After languishing for 840 games in Bronze, flicking between Bronze 5 and Bronze 2, I finally made it to silver after a few weeks of non stop steady improvement on my part! There were times that I was going to quit because of the ingame community but I stuck up and I wouldn't have done it without the help of a few select redditors, that answered my call for help when I asked at around 700 games. I won't name them, to keep their privacy but I am very grateful. 

To those out there who have had played a enormous amount of games in Bronze and is still aiming for silver, keep at it! Never give up, ignore the trolls and focus on improving your skills!

Yes, sorry about the selfish post but I feel great and it means a lot to me.

attacking dragon : 3:50:15

Third: Zed at mid farming it up, while vayne dies to thresh at bot, gets another assist: 3:51:10

Fifth&amp; Sixth: actual assists with him doing dmg on the targets

Not sure if he got some more assists without helping after that cause im to lazy to check, u should get what im saying and thats the proof. kinda bugs me how nobody noticed this

EDIT: Already posted it down below -

People seem to misunderstand the meaning of this post, it isnt about NA losing just because of this bug, obviously they lost because they got outplayed. Its about getting a hold of the problem and fix it before it happens in a game thats closer, in which it might influence the outcome of the game

After playing this game for almost 2 years, I finally decided to make a smurf. The first thing I noticed was how hard it was to farm, because you lack your AD.

After you reach level 5 or something, you start to get used to it, and it's not such a big deal. But as soon as you hit lvl 25, you are starting to look into getting your first rune page. This is where I discovered how stupidly expensive they actually were.

Without double IP boost, I get around 95-120 IP per game. 

What are the standard rune pages?

**AD Runepage:**

AD Marks/ Armor Pen Marks: 1845/ 3690

Armor Seals: 1845

Magic Resist Glyphs: 1845

AD Quints: 3075

**Total cost**: 8610 / 10455

---

**AP Runepage:**

AP Marks/ Magic pen Marks: 3690/ 3690

Armor Seals: 1845 (If you haven't already bought an AD page with these runes, you obviously don't have to pay for them again)

Magic Resist Glyphs: 1845 ((If you haven't already bought an AD page with these runes, you obviously don't have to pay for them again))

AP Quints: 3075

**Total cost:** 10455

--- 

Now these are just the standard runes, but I think most of us can agree, that: 10455 IP for one page, is just too much.

Let's say I get 120 IP each game (this is considering that I win every game), I would have to play 200 games, just to match up the IP for 2 pages, and a lot more in reality, because you don't win every game.

Now, you can speed up the process, if you are willing to pay for double IP boost. This will give you around 538 IP for your first win of the day, and 350+- IP per win. But it's one of the most expensive RP purchases in the store. 

IP Boost 30 days + IP Boost 50 wins 3490+2560 = 6050 RP. That is 35 Euroes / 45 Dollars.

--- 

Like this isn't bad enough, all the other runes are stupidly expensive aswell. Let's say you want Hybrid Penetration Marks?

810 IP per rune. That is 7290 IP for 9 Marks. I personally don't think this is an acceptable price to charge +  it takes an enormous amount time to farm up this IP.

Not only this, but you also only start out with 2 Rune Pages.
 
Riot is pretty much forcing you to spend money on RP, so you can buy atleast 2 more Rune Pages, if you ever wish to go into ranked play.

/ I guess this was kind of a rant, but it just irritates me so much.

EDIT: Putting in a comment, that I thought was very well written, by FJSpoof:

*One of the main reasons runes need to be removed.*

*I ask you reddit, if a game is competitive enough to become a sport, why do people who dish out more money have an advantage over those who don't? ""Ohh but FJSpoof, you can unlock every champion and all the runes just by playing the game."" You're right. You can. After MANY years of playing you can. I've played this game for 3 years now, with almost 3000 normal games, and about 1000 ranked games. I've only purchased ONE champion with RP, and every other bit of RP I've had has gone to skins. I currently own 83 champions, and 3 rune pages because I refuse to spend any actual money on unlocking shit that should be given to us for free (champs and runes, or just champs if they were to remove runes). Players with a larger champ pool, and more rune pages and rune selections have an advantage. I really hate how riots tries to tote this game off as a hype-competitive sport, when all players arent on an even playing field.*

*Think of it this way. I'm playing Chess competitively. If it was based on Riots model, if I purchased the right runes my pawns would be able to move maybe one space more than the enemies pawns if they didn't have the same runes. Or maybe I wouldn't have access to the Knight piece, while he did. Or maybe he has 2 bishops, and I don't have any.*

*Or if you want to go to a more physical sport. It'd be like me playing football in tennis shoes against someone in cleats, trying to catch a baseball with my bare hands against someone who has a mitt.*

*Players with a full champion pool can trade champions much easier than those who can't. Players who a full champion pool can LEARN more champions than those who can't!. B-b-b-but free weeks! No, these are 10 champs a week for free out of 100+ champions. Sometimes you might not even get 10 new champions you don't have or have never played before.*

*""But you'd never be able to master all 100+ champs anyway!"" Also not entirely true, and even if your intention isn't to master them, having access to play them at anytime would help you to better understand their abilities and limits, making you better at the game and playing against said champion.*

*I understand why riot does it, because they want money, but it doesn't make for a good sport with that formula at all.*

DotA 2 does it right, and the only reason I'm honestly still in league is the time/skill investment I have in it. (That and Riven is in League and not DotA 2)Transitioning isn't as easy as starting new/fresh.

1363533220.0	1agses	50 Tips how to come a better Supporter, by Xpecial (Support for TSM)	TheTimon	3046	1443	424	"Tip #01: When learning support, it's better to be a bit overaggressive and die a few times, than to be too passive and not know your limits.

Tip #02: Wards are needed not just for playing passively, but for being agressive too. A 2v3 situation is not a good situation.

Tip #03: One of the best times to engage on the enemy is when they go for a last hit. Every AD will last hit, punish them.

Tip #04: When trading hits, take note of minion wave. Sometimes, minions end up doing more damage than champions. PCM OP!

Tip #05: Good supports know the CDs on their spells. Better supports know their AD's. The best supports know their opponents'.

Tip #06: Summoner spells are expensive. Having summoners up, when the opposing side doesn't is a huge advantage in a 2v2.

Tip #07: The best time to engage is the opponent's worst time to get engaged on, e.g., leveling up before an opponent.

Tip #08: In lane, it's important to take note of not only players' 
HP, but the opposing lane's MP. (Knowing mana costs is good)

Tip #09: When playing a ranged support vs a melee support, ward the brush they are sitting in and avoid their engages. Harass with autoattacks and spells and remember that their engages have 10+ sec cds.

Tip #10: When against an AD with Cleanse, make sure he use Cleanse on a stun. Exhaust's damage debuff is unaffected afterwards.

Tip #11: When playing a melee support vs a ranged support, aim to hit level 2 first and immediately engage with level advantage. Be very careful with engages afterwards and ward the opposing brush. Avoid getting poked down, try to all-in.

Tip #12: When laning vs an AD with Cleanse and you have a CC ult (Sona, Leona, etc), use your ult asap to blow Cleanse. Cleanse has 210 sec CD, while ults have ~120 sec CD. This gives you a one minute window to ult full effect.

Tip #13: Observe the opposing lane's patterns. If they are passive most of the time and suddenly go aggro, care for ganks.

Tip #14: Keep tabs on opposing wards. Wards only last for 3 min, if you know their wards are down, ask your jungler for a gank!

Tip #15: When on purple side and you want to hit level 2 faster, ask the jungler nicely to start wraiths and you can do wolves.

Tip #16: Autoattack. Use your autoattack! As a ranged, use your spells and your AAs to harass. As a melee, AA when fighting.

Tip #17: Explore new starting options. You can now start Rejuv Bead and Faerie Charm for a faster GP10 or try Flask for high sustain!

Tip #18: Sightstone is actually a gp10. Each ward you dont buy is 75 gold saved...

Tip #19: Decide before the game, if you want to go Philo -&gt; Reverie or just use Flask and Chalice -&gt; Mikael's. Flask AND Philo is too much.

Tip #20: Watch this. No, serious, it's the best tip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IumG1v7x4bE

Tip #21: Janna hard counters Leona in lane. Janna nados makes it impossible for Leona to engage with Zenith Blade.

Tip #22: Use your Explorer Ward for temporary vision. Its perfect for warding the enemy lane brush or to secure a buff level 1.

Tip #23: It can be okay to use stuns on tanks. If your AD kills their tanks faster than their AD kills your tanks, just kll the tanks!

Tip #24: The Biscuteer mastery potion is the only pot, that stacks with a HP pot/ Flask. When in a sticky situation, dont forget to use it! (Note: This tip isn't correct to 100%.)

Tip #25: Having trouble landing Nami's Q in lane? Predict where the enemy AD will stand to last hit a low HP minion and shoot the Q there!

Tip #26: When you use Help, Pix! on an enemy, Pix goes behind them. If they move back, Pix stacks on top of them and your Q will land 100%.

Tip #27: Damage is calculated, when the attack lands. When Ashe uses Volley you can still Janna shield for bonus damage, until Volley hits.

Tip #28: If the world is about to end, you better have Revive as a summoner spell. (Joke)

Tip #28: When playing Soraka and you expect a Flash + ult, you should preemptively use silence. once he Flashes in range, he's instantly silenced. (Real)

Tip #29: Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab actually fires from his right hand. This means if you position correctly, you can hook around minions!

Tip #30: Lulu's E is one of the few spells that gives vision of invisible targets, making her Akali's worst nightmare.

Tip #31: When playing Blitz vs a target with an escape, use Power Fist or Static Field and immediately Rocket Grab to deny the escape.

Tip #32: When fighting 2v2 bot, vision inside the brush is important. Losing sight of a low HP enemy causes unecessary dmg by facechecking.

Tip #33: ADs typically have a longer CD on ther summoner's. Season 3 patch inceased summoner CD's, but added CDR for those with Utility!

Tip #34: Many skillshots have a range slightly beyond the range indicator. knowing the full range of Blitz Q and Zyra E is rather important!

Tip #35: Control the minion wave. If there is a huge wave pushing towards you, autoattack it a bit to think the ranks and allow easier CSing. If, however, there is a huge wave pushing towards them, push the wave to the tower before backing, or you'll lose waves.

Tip #36: When enemy targets you, they will have an orange outline. If a Taric is strafing and randomly glows orange, I know its a gank.

Tip #37: Janna shield is a funny spell. In lane the shield is good to block dmg. But in fights, the AD is worth much more than ~300 HP.

Tip #38: Try turning Line Missile Display on/off. It's inaccurate on Blitz, but super necessary for Lulu. Play around with it!

Tip #39: Sightstone should ALWAYS be bought and be either the 
first or second item (first would be early Philo or Ruby Crystal for HP).

Tip #40: It's typically better to get a half charged Nunu ult on 4 or 5 enemies rather than a fully charged ult on 1 or 2!

Tip #41: When you are playing with a Thresh, please fucking pick up the lantern. Thanks.

Tip #42: When using Dark Passage on Thresh, lead your target by throwing the lantern where they will be in a sec, not where they are now.

Tip #43: Free harass is best harass, if you can get a single attack off and not take any damage in turn, that's the best possible trade.

Tip #44: Use brush to surprise with spells. Champs like Zyra and Thresh have long wind-ups, so cast while hidden for a higher chance to hit!

Tip #45: If you want to check if a brush is warded, stand in it when minions are near. If they have vision, you will autmatically attack. 

Tip #46: When trying to all-in vs a Vayne past lv6, remember to have a vision ward ready or else you'll have an extremely hars time winning!

Tip #47: Leona's Q resets your attack, but has a long animation. Take advantage of this by moving immediately after Q for another auto.

Tip #48: When playing support Alistar, do consider using some mana Regen runes. I actually think his mana costs are kinda silly! =P

Tip #49: Always hover over players' summoner spells when you hold Tab and determine if they have summoner spell CD. Never get surprised

Tip #50: Be nice to everyone in solo queue, if you want to win, or else they might decide to troll you during your promo series! ;)

He told me it would be helpful if the LCS announcers explained some of the skills and champs briefly when they are picked so he could get an idea of what they do if he hasn't seen them before.

I thought this would be a fantastic idea for newer viewers. My idea was maybe in champ select when there is that downtime right before a game. The announcers could quickly go over the champs skills and ults. 

He doesn't know a whole lot of champs, he knows ""The spider girl that Voyboy plays"" (Elise) ""The guy that looks like a grub and spits"" (Kog'maw) ""The alien that eats people and gets bigger"" (Cho'gath) ""The girl that throws spears and turns into a cat"" (Nidalee) and ""The rat"" (Twitch).

He knows even fewer ults. He knows Crescendo and ""The thing that makes the ring that no one can get out of"" (Jarvan's Ult) and he has learned the summoners.

My father doesn't really get too excited about things anymore. He stopped watching football a few years back and dislikes baseball. It's actually pretty funny to watch him watch a game. His favorite team is Curse and his favorite player is Voyboy. When Curse wins he's happy for a while, and when they lose he gets mad, just like he used to for football games. When Voy goes all out in fights my dad gets so excited, so for that I say thank you Riot, and thank you Curse.  

[Here is his request for Riot](http://imgur.com/a/J1fGx)  

It says the following:
""My name is Jim, I'm 64. I enjoy watching LCS. It would be helpful i[f] you would give a discription [description] of the champion skills when they are picked.

RIOT PLS"" 

TL;DR - My dad is old and doesn't remember/know all champ ults. RIOT PLS give a desc of champs in matchmaking. 

**EDIT:** Thank you for all the support for my father. Whether you agree with the idea or not, it's good to hear you think old dudes watching games are cool.  

Common Questions:  
Q: You dad's not old! Why doesn't he just play LoL???  
A: The reason my dad is ""too old"" is because he was exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam and has lost a lot of his hand eye coordination as a result. The too old thing is a joke between my dad and I.   
Q: Just have him go to the wiki. That will help.   
A: My dad isn't exactly an expert with computers. I think he's still using his TI 64. Do you think his 20MB hard drive would hold the League??  
Q: Why don't you just tell him what they do?  
A: When I'm here, I do. But I'm not here all the time. Example: I turned on the Korean games yesterday and had to go to school. He continued to watch.  
Q: I see you have a second monitor. Why don't you pull up your client/website there?  
A: That is my computer we're watching on. If I'm not home, he refuses to touch my computer. He's afraid he'll break it. :/

1375670022.0	1jpsbh	The 10 types of people you meet in bot games	cubemstr	2916	1315	1300	"1) The First Win Guy.

Just an average league player who was busy most of the day, but really wants that 150 IP. He decides to load into a quick bot game just to make sure he gets it. Can generally be relied on to not suck.

2) The losing streak guy. 

Poor bastard has played 10 games today, and he lost every single one of them. His pride won't let him end on a loss, but he doesn't have the heart to try another PVP. He won't feed, but he'll probably play Amumu and keep cry on all game. 

3) The Level 30 with only 2 normal wins

How did this happen? No one is quite sure. Either he never plays anything other than bots, or he loses every PVP game that doesn't have 2 disconnects on the enemy team. After watching him play, you're still not sure which it is. He probably won't feed on his own, but he's not gonna win by himself either. 

4) The actual newbie

Hey, we were all this guy at some point. Sure, some of us stuck to only playing with a bunch of friends until we were confident that we knew the difference between a Bloodthirster and a Rabaddons, but still. He'll probably have 10 farm at 20 minutes, and buy the recommended items in order, but you can't really fault him for it too much. He's level 7. The bots will get fed, but you can handle it. 

5) The guy who plays like he's a newbie.

His ranking says Level 30, and in game he says that this is his smurf. But he just tried to solo baron at 15 minutes as Karthus with nothing but a tear. He WILL feed the bots, and he WILL refuse advice. Best thing to do is split push your lane and hope to god that fed Brand bot doesn't get the urge to hit you in the face with a giant magma penis. 

6) The Guy who thinks he's Froggen.

Locks in Anivia. Tries to all in at level 2. Dies. Respawns. Dies again. Blames teammates. Rage quits. 

7) The Power Gamer

At 5 minutes in you see that he bought Sword of the Occult and a Mejai's. 5 minutes after that he starts roaming around the map into other people's lanes and killing everyone before leaving. By the end of the game (15 minutes in total), he's 50-1-2 and you see the victory screen with a distinct feeling that you didn't accomplish anything. 

8) The Guy Trying out a Champion for the First Time. 

He just bought ~~Zed~~ ~~Kha-zix~~ ~~Kennen~~ Zac and wants to figure out his mechanics before jumping into a PVP game. His build order will be precise to what players in LCS are building, but will seem surprised when he's not able to replicate the success that [INSERT PLAYER HERE] had with him the day before. He WILL be surprised that the champion needs gold to be good, and he WILL blame his mistakes on lag.

9) The ""Group Mid and Push Plz"" Guy

Apparently he only has like 10 minutes to play. So rather than doing the rational thing and just not queueing up, he demands loudly and often that you all go mid and push as fast as you can. Inevitably when you don't, he'll rage quit 8 minutes in and call everyone ""nubs"". 

10) The ""DON'T TAKE MY FARM"" guy

Look, we all know what the meta is. But it's bots. So when I'm playing Nami bot lane with ~~Draven~~ ~~Vayne~~ Ezreal, I'm gonna take a few minions for myself. But this guy won't have any of that. Every minion in the map that is within range is his by right. And god have mercy on your soul if you take one without permission. He's annoying and makes you want to leave and go help out Orianna at mid. And don't even get me started on if you ever get a kill at any point during the game..."	t5_2rfxx	True

1366109989.0	1cgdck	I'm colourblind and i can't see Zac's blobs	Viciouswall_euw	4746	3147	425	"Hello everybody, yesterday as a jungler, i was exited because i finally unblocked our recent big green friend.
With the magestic green ground of sommuners rift i founded dificult to see where were his blobs landing.

Ofc when i'm clearing the jungle, with a bit of focus, i can step my blobs easily. Sad thing that in teamfights, if i step one of my blobs is a pure accident because i have to focus my view on the Game and the champions.

Some curious facts:
- As everybody knows, the big majority of league's community are males
- 1 in 10 males have some tipe of colourblindness
- some tipes ofcolourblindness dont affect your dayly life. (I discovered at age 22 in a friends meeting talking about my 2 year old brown shirt, witch caused confusion because apparently, it's dark green)
- 6% of all males have Deuteranomally (what i have, besides protanopia), witch are 2 different tricromacy annomalys.
- Finally, 50% of colourblinds soffer from at least one tricromacy annomally.

I just can't tell how much colourblind mode helps me. But this dont change champions colour.
I even considered to buy Zac's skin just to help me with this situation.
Instead i came here to allert the community and to help some people realize they are just like me.

This prblem CAN BE SOLVED easily if Riot does one very small change to the blobs... Turn their outline to white instead of green. Maybe if only colourblind mode is enabled or something.

Sorry for the wall of text and i hope i dont get hate because i'm a minnority.
If someone would like to put this as a RIOT PLS i dont Mind at all. That would be An. Awsome change for a lot of people.

Btw, Zac feels very powerfull even though i can't see very well his blobs, soooo yeah, he must be Overpowered =P (joking)




TLDR: people with Deuteranomally have to make an enormous effort to see Zac's blobs especially in teamfights, when this can be easily fixed by changing their outline to white. Deuteranomally is a tipe of colourblindness that isn't rare...at all.

I know my english is terrible and i am sorry for that. I'm Portuguese.

A lot of redditors sent me messages, I thank them for it, it gave me a lot of ideas. But here are the problems we are facing in that situation :
1) Where to open the bar ? A frontpage on reddit means that multiple countries liked the project. However, it's possible to open a bar one after the other (only if the first works well and can be trusted by the banks)

2) We are talking about a Technology-related bar, meaning the initial investment is HUGE. Also, the place has to be on a place as accessible as possible AND to provide a high connection speed.

3) What continent ? Again, we have a choice to make ! The first bar should be either in North America, or in Europe. (Senor Xpeke already has a reservation for a table if it opens in EU)

4) A bar aiming for players can be really risky due to the nature of gamers. What I mean by that is that a gamer plays during his free time, he usually doesn't go out :D. See the logic :D

5) At last, but not least unfortunately, the money... Founds are necessary. A lot of it... Depending on the goods delivered in the bar and the oppening and closure times, It can go (For only one bar) from 200 000 for a really small bar, to 600 000 for a good bar in a city. I don't take in account only the rent, but also the base of the bar, chairs, screens, taxes.

Basically, I have the knowledge and resources to develop such a thing.

The reason I ask is, that I'm already using a selfwritten client, which is way faster and not as buggy as the Adobe AIR client(Adobe AIR tends to be really slow on my machine) but it's also simple as hell and would give you eyecancer(tell me if you want screenshots :P) if you would see it's current ""design"".

The client would be pluginizable, for example, to interact with IRC Bots or for a reddit plugin, etc.

So IF people are interested, I would turn this into a serious alternative to the Official pvp.net client.

First, whoever said it's to project better is absolutely correct! How many singers preform a concert sitting down? Projecting better also falls in with the other top reasons of being able to deliver passion, excitement and feed off the body language of your co-caster! You bet your butts my next line is going to be stronger if Kobe is jumping around the stage or Jatt is throwing his hands in the air for a ridiculous play, it' almost like a form of fuel!

Since we have program monitors on the desk we can actually look right down in front of us or at the TV under our camera that people have been mentioning.  Also, the TV is not broken, it's been moved so that players can't see it from the stage, it's placement does not effect us!

Lastly, a lot of casters have been doing this for a while, Deman does it quite often in the studio already and Day9 + other casters have been known to frequently get on their feet with the crowd to deliver that extra punch!!  Enjoy the rest of the games from EU/NA LCS and MLG and expect chairs to become obsolete for a lot of us from Game Start to Nexus Destruction!

Ignite currently causes Talon's ultimate to fade away instead of return to him and deal damage. It doesn't always happen as it took me 3 tries to recreate it. I'm sure it must work with other items, like botrk and cutlass, but I have yet to try them out.

Suggestion: I would be cool, if the tear icon was dynamic. Then, when it is bought with 0 stacks, it would be empty only with the blue outline of the tear. When it gets stacked up, the icon should gradually turn more and more blue from bottom up. I hope you get the idea, english is not my first language :-)

When implementing this visual style, it would enable viewers of online tournaments and streams to better keep track of who stacks their tear faster.

Almost like the 10 matches in ranked to gain ELO (LP League).
Another thing evident in the comments was that overall this is a great idea! You all had little things you would take away or add in different cases but overall everyone agreed that this SHOULD happen. And thats why this is great. We all want more competitive fun in the league scene and these tourney's bring it! I love everyone for getting involved and appreciate all the comments. Thanks again guys it means alot. And what would this post be without a ---- RIOT PLS give us our amateur tournaments! --- Would love to hear more if anyone wants to dm me, and P.S. ill be hosting a league tourny of my own soon.

1376064921.0	1k171j	I'd recommend not making World Playoffs plans based on the assumption you can get tickets to every one of the the studio days	Tnomad	2639	1063	341	"Hey friends,

A lot of the people that have been talking to me and messaging me recently have been asking for advice on World Playoffs/Champs travel plans. Many of them are basically assuming they'll be able to get tickets to all, the majority, or even ANY of the studio days.

This is kind of concerning to me because I'm afraid people will book flights and hotels under the assumption that they'll be at the studio.

I don't really know anything about the studio location, other than what Riot Magus said in the AMA- that it has a small audience. If you think about the concept of a ""studio"" there's no way this is going to have several thousand seats available.

I'm really afraid that the tickets are going to sell out in like... 5 seconds and then people will be shocked that they didn't get one. Right now, I'd recommend operating under the assumption that you might not get tickets to any of the studio days and concentrate most of your planning on the Galen Center/Staples Center days.

I apologize if I'm wrong about any of this, but I'm just trying to look out for fans and don't want them to feel mislead.

Other than that, get pumped! If you're able to attend any of the championship or playoff days, I highly recommend that you try! It's going to be an awesome experience =)

I played  game with my friend, all 5 members of the team (including us) feed a lot and we lose, w/e let's just go again we think :D Nope that ain't going to happen it seems. 

When we try to queue again it says that we're still in game. Even though the Defeat screen clearly showed up and we even saw the summary screen. It says that ""several"" summoners are already in game, gg.

We both relog, only to find a reconnect button. Okay fine we try to ""reconnect. It doesn't work. Nice I guess we go play another game then.

And this is jsut one example. I mean why can't you accept invites while spectating? And why can't you take a look at your friendlist while ingame? Both features exist in Dota 2.

I don't think Riot should copy anything from Valve (they're different games and suitable for diffrent persons. They both have their thing) BUT I think they should just straight ouy copy their client. Because seriously. The LoL client is awful, like really really bad. A game that has been out for well over 3 years got a worse client than one still in beta? :/

And please don't tell me Riot can't afford making a new client (Yes I have actually recently heard things like that from people). I mean to listen how stupid that sounds. The company with the most played online game in the world backed up by the worlds 3rd largest internet company (Tencent) wouldn't be able to afford a new client?

Btw, above mentioned issues are just the tip of the iceberg really...

TL:DR LoL needs a new client, badly that is.

1368400039.0	1e7kb9	If Riot can limit the amount of health potions to 5, why can't they limit the amount of boots to 1?	SLlTCX	2742	1176	471	"**Is it because health potions can be stacked on one slot while boots can't?**

Edit 1: After reading some of the comments, it's actually better to not implement a limitation on boots because there could be ""bad code (example: long if-else statements)"" during the implementation when we can just prevent it by ""only clicking once"".

Edit 2: Came back from installing fans and OCing my desktop and saw that my post was on the front page! Thanks guys. Thank you Reinboom for explaining the technicalities behind the implementation of boot limiting. 

Edit 3: I might be wrong, but implementing a 5-second refund check would be harder than implementing a limitation on Boots of Speed only. Being only able to buy one Boots of Speed would already separate the trolls from mistakes cause you definitely don't need more than one ""Boots of Speed"". Who in their right mind would purchase another ""Boots of Speed"" after upgrading their regular boots? That's right, trolls.

Edit 4: There is a small chance to misclick and double click twice when upgrading boots because we wouldn't have enough gold since we buy our core components first. Then for the enchantment double purchase, we usually buy them when we have low amounts of gold or when we have a six item build. Therefore, I believe that only a check on ""Boots of Speed"" would be sufficient enough for Riot to implement instead of implementing a check on the Boots, their upgrades, and enchantments. 

For example, a rare situation would be like thus:

*  You have boots of speed and a dagger in your inventory with 1300g. It costs 150g to upgrade to Berserker's Greaves and don't want to wait for the BF Sword, you accidentally click twice and purchase the upgrade and another Berserker's Greaves, thus reducing the amount of gold you have to 250g (thanks to my friend for the example, dcpifreak).

Edit 5: I know most of you guys want the refund option to be added because it will solve almost all of the problems that we are having. The thing is, it's easier to implement a limitation system on ""Boots of Speed"" than create the refund system. I'm sure Riot will implement the refund system in the near future, but for a quick fix, implementing a limitation would be faster."	t5_2rfxx	True

1365586281.0	1c1xp7	League of Legends has the worst tutorial possible	NeedlefeetLoL	5400	3839	1081	"LoL has the worst tutorial for a game that I've ever seen. I just started up another smurf to play with a friend of mine who is new to the game and I decided to play the tutorial because why not. This is when I realised just how bad the tutorial is and how much it could be improved. The main problems I see are:

* **Thornmail is presented to Ashe as her only item.** There is no explanation of itemisation whatsoever. It should be explained that a carry, like Ashe, is *generally* better off using attack damage items. How do I know not to build ability power on her to increase the damage on her Volley (since it doesn't have an AP ratio but it is still an ""ability"")? Or armour (since she isn't really a viable tank with initiation skills)? These are really simple things that should be addressed. Even general builds or explanations of stats and when they are important. E.g., AD is used on your abilities when the (+X) is orange and AP is used on the green (+X). That armour and MR are soft capped, just like speed. Something that points out that BOOTS DON'T STACK.
* **Locked screen.** Locked screen presents so many disadvantages and I've never really played a MOBA or RTS with it. It's terrible. Players should learn to use unlocked screen as it helps with a lot of sniping abilities and map awareness. Since the first time you play you have a locked screen, new players are likely to be more comfortable with that. Not good.
* **Bonus damage.** Ashe starts with 30 damage from nowhere that allows her to melt through the minions. When new players get into game and don't do the same thing, they will be confused as hell as to where all their damage went. This really could have been done by giving her damage items rather than armor items, since, you know, you *can't die* in the tutorial.
* **Heal/Revive as summoner spells.* Recommending Heal/Revive on an AD carry. Really? REALLY? Why not a brief tutorial about how using Barrier/Cleanse could save your life.
* **No last hitting instructions.** How do players know that the most efficient way to farm is through last hitting? I learned towards level 30, rather than level 1. Why? Because I'm never told to. DotA 2's tutorial emphasises last hitting and explains why it is important. This is something that 99% of new players could learn from and would honestly be one of the most helpful things in the tutorial.
* **Increased gp10.** Confusing for players to get 3k gold in a few minutes as opposed to tens of minutes. Also doesn't explain gold generation and just how much of an effect it has. That might stop level 10 supports from taking half the cs. This isn't really one of the major problems though.
* **Proving Grounds rather than Summoner's Rift.** I sure as hell don't know where I'm going in this 3-laned behemoth. You mean you can not be in a lane and kill the jungle creeps instead? You mean I'm meant to tell people when the enemy in my lane is missing? You mean there are neutral minions that provide certain benefits/amounts of gold? None of this is explained. I had no idea what jungling was until around level 20 and I had no idea that blue or red gave buffs.


I know that it's been mentioned that the tutorial needs updating, but damn. How could this remain the ""tutorial"" for so long? Are players really to blame for being so terrible at the game all the way up to 30? They may have simply missed the basic knowledge that most of us possess--it's not their fault. If it's basic knowledge to veteran players, it should be basic knowledge to beginner players. League of Legends can have a lot of little complexities, so why not just teach the stuff that isn't complex and is cornerstone to any player.

**tl;dr:** The LoL tutorial teaches you very little of use and misses out key basics that likely leads to the terrible playerbase that we see today.

_______________________________________________________________

**Edit 1:** I suck at Reddit formatting.

_______________________________________________________________

**Edit 2:** I see that there are so many downvotes. I assume this is because everything I rant about is covered in Battle Training. I DID acknowledge this, but I don't blame you with the vast number of comments. I wasn't able to play battle training as League shut down immediately after finishing the tutorial due to the 3.5 Balance update. I still do have a problem with the tutorial since it exists and is the official tutorial. I'd bet (safely, I assume) that a lot of people skip Battle Training since they've already played the tutorial. The other thing is that Battle Training has easily ignorable features when compared to the tutorial. I played a few games last night on my smurf (Ufabulum) and it really shows that Battle Training is ignored completely by the majority. A Garen with 2x Berserker's Grieves, a tank Annie, no last hitting. This being said, I actually had more fun playing with the new players than I do at my own elo. They weren't flaming each other and they weren't bound by the meta. Very refreshing. Anyway, the point is that they displayed the skills of someone who had played the tutorial (since it forces you to learn) and either played and ignored or straight up missed Battle Training, so my post still stands. The **tutorial** needs to be changed. Perhaps it should be split up into Beginner Tutorial and Advanced Tutorial, one which explains the basic mechanics, the other explains last hitting, map awareness (MIAs) and warding. LoL is, after all, the biggest online game.

**tl;dr:** I know that Battle Training addresses most of these issues but it doesn't seem to have an effect on low level players. It is also easily dismissible and I stick to my guns in saying that the tutorial should be changed and is currently more harmful than helpful.

______________________________________________________________

**Edit 3:** A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I intended with the itemisation part. Example builds explaining what stats do and the fact that certain abilities scale with AD or AP. I don't mean ""Ashe must stack Phantom Dancers, Infinity Edges and Bloodthirsters or else the tutorial sucks"". The tutorial gives you an armour item when you can't die. The item is legitimately useless. It doesn't stop anything or improve the tutorial at all. They could have given a BF sword to Ashe or something. That covers the bonus damage issue. I would just like basic item explanations in the tutorial, rather than ""here is a Thornmail, it is all that you can buy"".

For those of you who don't know me I am a StarCraft 2 commentator who has been doing live events/running my YouTube channel for around 4 years now.

Recently I did my very first League of Legends video and the response was extremely overwhelming. To be 100% honest I was blown away by all of the feedback, suggestions, comments and support. The support alone has been enough get me more interested in possibly playing the game more often in a casual sense.

That's where you come in!

Looking through the original post (as well as my cake post from earlier) I realized there are lots of pro players, personalities, viewers and even Riot employees wanting to show me the ropes. I would love to record the progress of me starting out in League for the first time and am curious who the best personalities in the space would be the best to do that with.

Any help, lists, or ideas of people to help get me started in the game would be amazing. I may be a complete noob but I still want to try and make content that may be useful to the average viewer or someone else trying to get into the game.

Whats really getting out of hand is this:

* Players trying to MAKE others play certain champs. ""Pick Shen, he is OP"". ""Pick Blitz and it´s GG!!"". ""They got Lux mid. Go Talon, noob.""

Because chances are, the picking player has no clue how to play Talon/Shen whatever but suddenly feels forced to do so because of peer pressure.

This brings me to something even worse:

* Players actually LISTENING to those kinda people. ""Oh, that dude I have never met and who is in a equally low shitty ELO like myself says I should pick Singed vs. Jax. I have never played Singed and got no idea why he is good vs. Jax but here we go...""

EDIT! A question about the detailing on her face, and how it creeped some people out, came up on GD, here's the answer to why her face looks like it does:

So, the super-secret head-canon I have, which I have no idea if it'll be actually integrated, but it's something that Team Diana talked about way back in the day.. is that her mark is a physical brand. The Solari elders literally took a tool and burned that mark into her face. Though, they were so blinded by ignorance, or maybe they liked irony so much, that they branded her with the ancient symbol of the moon. This scar burned her hair, giving her a larger forehead. After she flipped out, surrendering all her humanity to deep sadness and pain, that's when this thing became full of fancy. That's when her bond with the moon began. The marks on her eyes weren't makeup, they were burn marks and scorches coming from the magicalmoonlight affecting her eyes and causing her tears to boil on her face.

1355082323.0	14k6fz	Black cleaver changes need to be hotfixed, not waited for until next patch	theBMB	3133	1594	949	"Stacking black cleavers has gotten out of hand and I have yet to play a game in the past 3 days in which someone is not stacking them.  This is against Riot's intentions of introducing variety to item paths, is not fun to play against, and completely throws off any statistics for the preseason and prevents Riot from properly balancing other champions and items.  The reason why this is so game breaking is because AD casters who normally have very strong early-mid games but fall off are now only getting stronger in the late game and can essentially 100-0 someone who has a full build.  With 4 black cleavers you have max CDR, 60 flat armor pen, 1000 bonus health, 200 bonus damage, and reduce enemy armor by 30% with 1 proc of any kind of physical damage.

Counter arguments:

-Build health instead of armor

   This doesn't mitigate their damage output, it might make them take slightly longer to kill you, but you still won't have nearly enough damage output to compete with them 1v1 (or 2v1 in many cases).  Especially if you're not a tank and you're opting to buy health over damage

-Stacking cleavers doesn't increase the armor reduction cap

   It's not the cap that's important its the fact that with multiple cleavers you can reach that max 30% reduction faster.  Any ability like heartseeker strike or rake that hits multiple times will deal much more damage on subsequent hits since the max armor reduction can be reached with the first or second hit.  Also the stats offered by TBC are just too perfect for AD casters, so it's a very enticing option since every other item gives them extra stats they probably don't need much like crit chance or attack speed.

-Just CC them to death

  This is a valid strategy, but it often takes at least three people to pull this off successfully since if you don't burst them down immediately they will likely get one of you the moment the CC wears off.  AD casters and AD assassins shouldn't pose such a serious threat to a group of champions when they're designed to pick off stragglers and champions who are by themselves.  They shouldn't have the power to take out an entire team by themselves.

This is production level code, so my question to Riot is, what's going on? Do you need to hire new people? Do you need to change some policies or standards? 

I know you're coming out with a web based client at some point, but companies like Valve, Arena Net, CCP, and Blizzard all have much more stable clients without the need to move to a web based solution (which I personally see as a cop-out). Not to mention the client lacks snap-to-screen in windowed mode, and when playing fullscreen windowed crashes happen when running multiple monitors. 

I'm not hating on Riot or anything here, but with production level code we should never see a crash, or if it happens, maybe once a year per player or something. Right now I crash maybe once per week. If you need help put out a hiring call, many people specialize in stability. 

In my opinion as a programmer we have to draw a line at what is acceptable production code, and Riot's client isn't there right now despite their status as one of the foremost professional esports right now. 

EDIT: Keep in mind this is a technical observation, don't complain here just because your computer doesn't run XYZ. We're talking about overusing memory, stepping out of bounds, not generating stacktraces, not using WinAPI correctly, just obvious, freshman in college type of coding oversights.

I apologize up front for this post propably being a wall of text in the end, but I appreciate everyone who reads it and I hope the matter might get the attention it so desperately needs. Thank you!

As you all might know, problems on Eu-West are nothing new. While 8 hours downtime on NA result in a IP boost, 8 hours downtime on EUW is called a “regular sunday“. It sucks but we've kinda gotten used to it. But recently it has gone too far with the server problems. Let me tell you my story.

Today marks the 11^th consecutive day at which I am not able to properly play nor even login due to a “connection error“. At random intervals I was able to login, only to be affected by lagspikes and disconnects. I've contacted support, described them my problems and told them that none of the suggested “solutions“ are fixing the problem at hand. I offered them to provide as much data as possible and was asked to send them countless logs and information, which I did. They told me a tech specialist will contact me “soon“. Finally after five days said tech specialist contacted me but apparently did not read anything I wrote before. Instead he asked me for logs I've alredy sent and suggested solutions of which I already told them they won't work for me.

This is just my story. Other people might have experienced something else, but judging from reddit and forum posts, there are many affected.  I've read about many people who have to restart their pc/router every day, sometimes even before every game. People who can not complete one game without disconnects. People who have started playing on a diffrent server. People who have given up completely and lost the faith in Riots competence to fix this problem.

So while this may not be a problem that affects every single player, it evidently affects many and should not be ignored. But Riot has failed miserably, not only to fix this problem but also communicating about it. It took them four days on the forums to update us from a „yeah we are working on it“ to a „yeah we are still working on it“. At this point I don't even know if they are genuinely trying to fix the issue or try to ignore it until it fades away.

All we've heard so far are soothing words, unreliable solutions, empty promises, understatements and the usual and oh so very shallow „we're so sorry“. The lack of communication and the fact that they are forcing the players to go through all kinds of liabilities (sending logs, trying out solutions, restarting etc.) for a problem that was not caused on the side of the players is an insolence.

We finally want some answers! What is the situation? Is there any progress? Are people genuinely trying to fix the problem? How long do you estimate it will take to fix it? Are sales/TPA skins being extended, since they are inaccessible to many players? Will Riot eventually just take the blame and honestly apologize to the players?

It is time for someone to step up and tell us what is going on and more importantly fix those problems once and for all!



**TL;DR: Many EUW players have severe problems logging in and/or playing for more than a week now. Riot does not help us nor properly communicates. Somebody help us!**



*Edit: Just to clarify: I do not want to hate on Riot here. I love League of Legends and I love Riot. All I want is to finally get some answers and ultimately be able to play once again. Also this is not a discussion about compensation but rather a discussion about server equality. While compensation also plays a minor part in that, the bigger issues are the discrepancies between servers regarding communication with the players and server stability. There is a huge undeniable gap which finally has to be adressed by Riot.



*Edit2: Big thanks to each and every one of you for reading/supporting this post and contributing to the discussion. Also a shoutout to Jaraxo who helped me, sorting out why this post was removed at first and helping me getting it up again!

I honestly did not expect such a massive feedback but it just shows how urgent this problem is and how many people are actually affected. Let us hope that our message reaches the right people and we will no longer be ignored. Riot hopefully acknowledges those mistakes and learns from them for the future. They need to step up their communication and make server functionality and equality their priority.

Stay strong my fellow summoners! We will master this crisis and one day we eventually shall meet again on the fields of justice! Cheers!



*Edit3: Seems like we are making progress folks. Riot recently updated one of their threads, with some more specific information regarding the issue. Check out [this Link](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=11817164#post11817164) for their current situation. Thanks to spotzel for the Link and KjoeLjan for pointing it out!

The idea is: instead of having a button that says, ""I hereby lock, and won't change my champion anymore,"" have a button that says, ""I'm ready to start the game, if everybody else is."" I might un-ready, in case, as it turns out, somebody else can only really go mid, or just bought a new kat skin and really really wants to.

This does all the good of the Lock In button, but gets rid of some of the instalocking problem, in that people can't use instalocking as an excuse, and can, in blind pick, always be asked to switch, as they are never actually ""locked in.""

In ARAM, it would have a different benefit. If you're done trading, have all your masteries and runes and summoners set, and you don't really want to wait another 40 seconds, and everybody else is in the same situation, you can just start the game sooner. Less unnecessary waiting.

It wouldn't solve everything overnight, but I think it's a nice simple change for the better. What do you guys think?

The bombs will deal true damage because it explodes from minions. Minions have no magic resist and the AOE deals the same amount of damage as to the main target of the bomb.

**HAVE FUN FELLOW LEAGUERS!**

Edit: Can also be quite fun with Lee Sin.

Q a minion, throw it at them, jump, and (Lee Sin's) E for free damage if you are ahead.

Edit 2: Im sorry for the part about Zileans bombs. They used to deal the damage they did to minions and therefore true damage to champions aswell, but apparently they changed that.

Any time a champ buys a ward while they have this enchantment, it would add a charge to their boots. The boots would have an active that would allow the user to spend the charge to place a ward, similar to how Sightstone works, except that the player would still have to buy wards. I'm not sure on what the limit on charges should be, though; I was thinking it should maybe only be able to have one charge, and not be able to carry pink wards, so that it doesn't completely replace the viability of keeping a slot open for wards.	t5_2rfxx	True

Why not?	snoopeh	4356	2835	671	"I think about a week ago someone mentioned how they were during games asking their team &amp; opponents to get involved and do exercises per kill/assist &amp; objective - this inspired me to try encourage it in my stream as well, with overwhelming success!

A large portion of this sub reddit actively watches streams on a daily basis.. why not turn it into an activity/exercise routine? I understand you might not be physically fit enough to do 100 pushups or situps in a game - but start somewhere.. set yourself realistic goals and try and do it on a regular basis.. YOU WILL IMPROVE.

I was going by the rule on my stream of 10 pushups/situps per kill &amp; 5 for assist - it's achievable even for the not so fit among us. I remember when I could barely do 10 pushups, I would just make sure I did 10 each evening before sleep and gradually it increased where I was able to do more and more - I highly recommend it, especially for the couch potatoes amongst us! Once you get more confident, it might (like it did with me) end up in you eating a bit healthier and doing some running. Make sure you don't overdo it and try incorporate it into a balanced life style change at the same time ;)

So next time when watching the LCS, Voyboys stream, my stream or anyones stream - for ONE of the games - set yourself a challenge! Do it your own way - involve your friend/partner! Most people hate going to the gym, try this instead :)

* Before we get into my thoughts I would like every one to know I have been playing Rengar since release and have been with him through all his OP and UP times. These current changes are taking Rengar back into time and it really confuses me why Riot choses to take a unique play style like Rengar's and just dump it for another usual Tanky DPS champion.



Here is my post from the league forums on the topic.


I'd personally like to talk to you in private if that is possible ^.^ but these are my thoughts on your current changes

* General
- Health Regen, Health Regen/lvl, and Health/lvl all increased

This looks good, definitely something riot over nerfed

* Unseen Predator
-Now becomes visible at the beginning of the leap, rather than midleap

This actually sounds like a pretty big nerf, hopefully the speed of the leap stays the same but adding this and making people already know he is coming makes me worry a lot that he will be useless in teamfights just due to how easy it will be to peel him.
(Don't forget this also means people will actually be able to flash out of your leap now)

* Savagery 
- Attack Speed removed (Temporary for now - planning on putting something else here)
Ferocity Bonus: Savagery
- Damage lowered, Attack Speed lowered, Attack Speed Duration increased

Looks like you have pretty much dumped on Q's face, this skill looks pretty pointless right now and it seems you want Rengar to be this Tanky DPS rather than assassin. It also seems you want him to be in the jungle which isn't a bad thing but I love playing him top and I feel Riot shouldn't take away his position there.

* Battle Roar
- Damage increased
- Cooldown decreased
- No longer grants Armor/MR - instead grants damage reduction from Physical Damage/Basic Attacks
Ferocity Bonus: Battle Roar
- Heal unchanged
- Now deals damage based on Rengar's level

So pretty much with the nerfs to Q it seems we will be seeing the tanky Rengar come back with Sunfire/Visage and spilt all day. With the base damage and cooldown reduced on this ability it will allow him to clear quicker and even though the heal isn't scaled on health it will still heal more than it would with health scaling if you don't only stack health but build resistances.

The change from Armor/MR to damage reduction from AD sounds a little troublesome, you have totally taken out his MR buff for nothing if you want to get rid of these free defensive stats maybe make it like takes 5% reduced dmg? It kind of sounds broken so you could always mess around with the numbers.

Another problem that arises with this buff to W is the return of AP rengar. If you reduce this abilities cooldown and buff its base damage, while nerfing his Q all leads to the reason to just play AP again. The only thing I'm unsure of is how you plan on giving the damage on ferocity spells, will it do more dmg than W if im maxing it first? If not that just seems really weird and wouldn't make the ""ferocity bonus"" feel right.

* Bola Strike
- Damage increased
- Bonus AD Ratio increased
Ferocity Bonus: Bola Strike
- Now deals damage based on Rengar's level
- Root duration increased

Once Again with these buffs towards his base damages on his E and W it seems you guys want him to return to his tanky state? Now rather than Rengar sniping off an opponent he seems to be one who roots them up deals a bit of damage and allows his team to clean it up.

* Thrill of the Hunt
- Cooldown decreased
- Duration increased
- Movement speed increased
- Enemies will now receive a particle over their head when Rengar can see them; Additionally, Enemies will hear Voice Over on activation if they are in Rengar's sight range when he casts Thrill of the Hunt

I don't get the reason you add this, if you are already nerfing his huge burst why is there a reason to make him so noticeable to others? This completely ruins the most fun thing about him being a sneaky champion who scares the **** out of people. At the moment it feels this ability is going to be more used to scout people out with its low cooldown and more to just scare people off rather than using it to initiate onto someone. The reason this isn't a problem with nocturne is because his is a global darkness making everyone be scared, also his range to leap is far larger than Rengar's making it so he still can connect his gank before the enemies flee far. With Rengar you only have to get worried if you see a symbol on your head, taking away his global fear to other lanes and making it really easy to just play passive till the symbol goes away.




* Over all thoughts -
Riot seems to make no sense with Rengar, at first he was this crazy AP nuker, once that was nerfed he became a tanky spilt pusher, than once that got nerfed he was unseen for a long time. At the moment Rengar is coming back into play slowly because people finally found out they can just build him full assassin. I was totally fine with this because this was how riot wanted Rengar to be played. And now with these changes it seems like you guys think assassin is to broken on him so your changing him back to this tanky champion. I personally hate these changes as a Rengar main as it totally kills his playstyle and pretty much makes him this new champion. With these changes I feel Rengar will have a lot of problems trying to fight in teamfights as he is really easy to peel if he doesn't finish off an opponent with his first leap. With the current changes Rengar seems to now be a big lane bully with increased base damage on his W and his E. He will return to maxing E or W and now with scaling damage on ferocity will just spam W in lane to heal from it. His laning will be godlike and he will just push top non stop. There is no point of him trying to roam because people will easily walk away. His ult will be used to dominate top harder, by either running away or by 2v1ing while waiting for your ferocity to recharge in ult. The thing is you wish to make him a champion who is a sustained fighter, but the problem with that is he only has 1 leap out in the open and is melee. Not a lot of melee fighters are viable at the moment because they are so easily pealed, it really saddens me you make his ult visible to all and I truly believe it will be the one of the most useless ults compared to what it is used for now. 

If you wish to continue with these ult changes I beg that you atleast give everyone the icon/ sound so it isn't so obvious where Rengar is going.

I would really like to help you guys out with these changes, so if you would like to talk more and get into detail (numbers, etc) my ign is Only Rengar, I've sent both of you requests and hope I can contact you guys!

Not everything might make sense because I'm sort of just ranting and I just woke up but oh well =)

-

So hopefully the true Rengar players will support me here and show that this change isn't for the good, but rather will give Rengar a more stale style that is seen by multiple champions. It isn't that I don't want change at all, just the ones Riot has shown seem to be quite unnecessary.

MelkMan7	2674	1160	281	"In spite of all these requests for ward skins (I see a new one daily), why doesn't Riot just give out ward skins as rewards for certain achievements? After each season you could get a trophy shaped ward in the colour of the division you're in, if you've won say 200 ARAMs you get a Poro shaped ward.  

I think this approach is better because let's be honest, everyone wants a ward skin and if the achievements to get them encourage good behaviour in the community, there aren't any down sides.

1368262934.0	1e4dk7	New game mode idea ( sole survivor)	Mofiremofire	2848	1341	692	There used to be this game, maybe some of you played it, called sole survivor. It was based off the command and conquer series where you chose one unit and then were randomly dropped on a large map covered in fog of war to fend for yourself vs everyone else. Unfortunately Westwood studios took the servers down one day and I could not play this game anymore. I think a LOL sole survivor map would be awesome. Drop 20 champions off on a large map with no towers, tons of creep camps and a few shops hidden on the map and see who comes out on top. Re spawns would be quick and random where you were placed on the map. It would be interesting to see what champs and strategies would be most effective for this. Hope you guys like my idea. 	t5_2rfxx	True

Everyone in the world with the slightest interest in League of Legends should pay close attention to the matches happening next weekend in Los Angeles.  Pre-Season began in August 2011 at Gamescom, Cologne, Germany won by CLG Prime and completed with the Korean Regional Finals in Seoul, South Korea won by NaJin Sword last weekend.

It has been a long road and many air miles for all of the teams involved travelling the globe with almost every corner of the world represented.  Peoples lives will  have changed during this season and I can not express the excitement I feel for it, I may just be hyperventilating come day one.

So after a few weeks of absence, I decided to join the back the Chatroom 'Platinum vs Silver' on EUW. For those  who do not know what this is: basicly its a chatroom where you can create custom 5v5 games to improve your gameplay, usually you put 5 Silvers and Bronzies on one team, and 5 Plat-Dias on the other one. Then you obviously play the game, and afterwards your opponent gives you advice and tips, what you did wrong and how to improve it.

So this Idea beign generally awesome in my oppinion, from day to day it gets used less often, which makes me kinda sad cause I know there are a lot of High Elo players that are willing to help the low ones. For Example today, i can't even start a single game cause either no one replies, or we get stuck with 5-7 players.

So, this is an Apelle to all of those high elo players that are wanting to help the Low players getting better, maybe if you have the time and joy to do so, feel free to join the chatroom 'Platinum vs Silver' on EUW (I know it exists in NA too, but I'm not sure how exactly the chatrooms called)

Let's hope we can bring it back to Life! :)

PS: Plz dont hate me, my english suckz cauze im Only a 15 year old scrub german, and I dont know how to format on reddit correctly, im sorry :P
 
Edit: Of course, Gold people are allowed to join too! :)

Edit 2: I need some sort of Mod for this, Im the only one setting up games, but when i get ingame soon, i cant start other games, help would be apreciated :)

Edit 3: OMFG I HIT FRONTPAGE TY ALL GUYS I APRECIATE SO MUCH!!! GREETINGS TO MY MOMMY I LUV HER NO HOMO

Edit 4: A loyal fan even did a Forum for this, go check it out!
http://platinumsilver.freeforums.org/

Edit 5: If normal Chatroom is full, join others there are tons of em, for example Silver vs Plat, Plat vs Silver, Platinum vs Silver 2 etc. , just type something similiar and youll find a room for sure, otherwise just create a new one and make ppl join you, hf guys! :)

Edit 6: If the room seems empty to you, you either created a new one, or the room is already full, so just try to join another one, like said above, there are several rooms atm :)"	t5_2rfxx	True

Its extremely useful to point these out to your jungler so they know where the enemy can see and how long it will be before the ward runs out. Perhaps also include a timer in the chat like when you kill dragon/baron. Or would that just make calling those types of things out easy mode.... I dunno, i think i would appreciate it :)

**Edit**: After reading the comments, I  wish to make a few clarifications and revisions.  I agree that the timestamp part is just way too much. Its babying, pure and simple. I do though support that if we acquire more than 4 special pings, we should be able to choose which pings we wish to have at hand on our  4 direction wheel, similar to hotkeys. The suggestion about having a marker of some kind that lasts for 3 minutes is also ridiculous, although i am fairly certain that was sarcasm.... but i have found you can't really assume that sometimes... 

As for most of the complaints that say this is dumb and it would just be followed by more pointless pings (brb, re, buying etc.), thats absurd to think that riot would let LoL get that micro'd. This is just a small addition to eliminate the need to type ""ward"" if things get hectic in lane which they can do easily. A lot of people dont rely only on the smart pings 100% of the time anyway. Its often a mix between the new pings and the traditional pings and typing. 

Don't be getting all retro/hipster/oldskool league on any sort of innovation, streamlining, or new additions...

**2nd Edit**: Need is such a strong word. How about (in a olden southern female voice) ""Golly gee, Mr. Riot, sir. It sho would be mighty convenient to have this here ""ward"" ping. Now, of course, if it's too much trouble fo ya, I know I could get along just fine without it.""

This started out as just an exercise for myself, but after showing a friend, I'm taking his advice and posting it here.

I think this list could help a lot of Bronze-Gold junglers improve and move up, and I sincerely hope it does just that :)

**EDIT: Thanks so much for all the feedback!  This got WAY more attention than I ever expected!  To clarify on a few things..  Yes, this is pretty basic stuff / common sense.  It's not intended to be an intricate guide for high ELO jungle play.  It's just things that I think people should know or keep in mind to help them improve from lower ELOs to higher ones.  As I stated above, I originally wrote this list to remind myself of what I should be doing.**

**#1 is based on the assumption that you can play 3-4 junglers equally well.  Picking a jungler you can't play well just to fit the team comp could be a mistake -- you'll have to make that decision yourself :)**

**EDIT2: I've changed #10 based on the great criticism provided by you all.  Thank you!**

*NOTE: This is all just my opinion, and mostly applies to solo queue.  Jungling in arranged 5's is a whole different animal.  Please give me feedback and let me know what you agree with or what you think is wrong.*

So, here we go.  It's a long one!

##Things I’ve learned while Jungling to Diamond (In No Particular Order):

**1.	Pick your Jungle based on team composition, not just who you want to play.**

* The Jungler has to fulfill different roles depending on the team composition, especially who your mid/top laners are.  

* Example: don’t just blindly pick Eve because you’re awesome and expect to carry with ganks.  If you’ve got a Chogath mid and a Renekton top, go ahead and play Eve!  Kill that AD carry, because your team doesn’t need a front line jungle.  

* However, if you have something like a Nidalee top and a Xerath mid, your team is going to need you as the front line and some CC, so you’ll want to play a jungler like Nasus or Volibear to fill that spot.

* If you are first pick, try to choose a jungler that will work well in many team comps (my personal favorite is Lee Sin, but something like J4 or Xin will work here – you can be front line if you need to be, or you can build damage if your team needs that).    Also, picking a front-line tank jungle is rarely a bad thing.

* I’d recommend having 3 or 4 “main” jungles that you are comfortable with, so you can fill what your team comp needs.

**2.	Watch opponents’ items.**

* This is especially important when it comes to your first double-buff gank opportunity.  If the enemy Top Laner has Red Elixir and 4 HP Pots, he probably has a ward somewhere.  Going straight up the river will likely not work.  If he’s got cloth+5, don’t worry about taking a sneaky route to the lane!

**3.	Patience pays off.**

* When you’re going for a gank, don’t just run into lane.  Get yourself into position and wait for the enemy to make a wrong movement.  Wait for him to go get that CS.  THEN jump in for the gank.  Waiting that extra 10-15 seconds can really make a huge difference.

**4.	Ganks can be successful without netting a kill.**

* Burning enemy summoners will let your lanes have an easier time, and is a successful gank.

* If your lane is having a hard time farming and you can push their laner back to base, that was a successful gank.  Now your lane gets some time to catch up.

* In some particular situations, you can even help your lanes by just coming up and hanging out there, letting them cs freely without being harassed.  You see this commonly in pro games.

**5.	Keep Track of Enemy Summoners**

* Enemy blew flash the first time you ganked?  Come back!  Especially jungling someone like Maokai, if you know their flash is down you can feel confident in Flash+W to get the kill on the next gank.

**6.	Counterjungling is dangerous!**

* A lot of people want to “outjungle” their opponents and take their buffs, proving that they are the “better jungler.”  While counterjungling is powerful, you need to understand the risks involved, especially in Solo Queue.

* Watch the position of your lanes vs. enemy lanes before you go into the jungle.  Especially when invading near bot lane (invading red when you’re purple side or blue when you’re blue side).  Getting caught in the enemy jungle is an easy way to get yourself killed, and an easy way to bait your teammates into deaths also.

* If the enemy jungle is ganking a lane and you’re across the map unable to help, that is the best and most risk-free time to counterjungle.

**7.	Dying with double buffs early is one of the WORST things you can do.**

* On behalf of top laners everywhere, please do not make overly risky ganks with double buffs.  If something goes wrong, you get counterganked, your level 3 dive SOMEHOW doesn’t work, etc.,  not only did you just feed a kill to the enemy team, but you probably just lost your top lane in the process.

* As mentioned previously, your objective in ganking is not always to get the kill.  Do not do something stupid trying to get one.

**8.	Keeping up in Experience is very important.**

* This is especially true when playing very gank-heavy early jungles like Lee Sin, or jungles that are not very good at clearing camps quickly.

* When your lanes go back, go hold their lanes and soak up the XP.  It will be faster than farming the jungle and you can go get your camps when your laner is back.

* Level-wise, you should aim to be somewhere between the Support and the Midlaner.  If you notice yourself falling behind the Support, seek out sources of experience to catch up.

**9.	Buy Wards.  LOTS of Wards.**

* Yeah, I know this is what everyone says, but it’s true.  If you’ve got the space, pick up a few wards.  

* If your top lane doesn’t have a ward, ward for him!  Don’t just complain when he gets ganked and didn’t see it coming; even though you may not be there to counter-gank, you can at least give him a chance.  

* Giving your team more vision not only helps them avoid ganks, but it makes your job as jungler easier.  As the jungler, you also have easier access to “deep” ward the enemy jungle/buffs/etc.

* When you think you want to try dragon soon, ask your bot lane to pink dragon, or just pick up a pink yourself.

**10.	Your job is to get your LANES fed, not yourself. (EDIT2: Not Always the Case :)**

* *EDIT2: You guys have posted some really great reasoning to disagree with this point.  I've always tended towards a more support-oriented jungle role, which I think is why I put this on the list.  However, I can agree with the criticism posted that getting kills as the jungler is not a bad thing, especially for the bruiser/carry junglers that are common.  The thing I've taken away from the feedback on this point is that gold distribution is an interesting thing, and should be considered depending on the jungler you're playing.*

* If your laner is in danger of dying, secure the kill as fast as possible.

**11.	Communicate and Be POSITIVE!**

* This is more general than just jungling, but I find it even more important in this role.  As jungle you interact with the other lanes the most.  As such, it’s very helpful to develop a positive relationship with your lanes.  It can lead to more successful ganks, more efficient use of your time, and better winrates!

* If you want a smiteless leash so that you can gank top with double buffs, let your team know!  Let your top laner know if you want him to have a certain skill at level 2 (example: ask your Shen to get taunt second so you can have the cc for your gank).

* Ask your lanes where the wards are, or if the enemy has flash.  They’ll be happy to provide the info (if they can) in order to help your gank.

* I will often ask “how’s top lane going” if there hasn’t been much action there.  Your laner will usually tell you it’s fine, but they will know you aren’t forgetting about them, and if they do need help they will ask rather than rage.

* If you’re going to be leaving a lane alone to focus on another area, let them know.  Example: if your bot lane is winning but top and mid are behind, tell your team “I’m gonna camp mid and top, bot lane be careful.”

* (Obligatory but true) -- Don't rage, and apologize for mistakes if you make them.  If your teammate makes a mistake, don't scold them for it.  Arguing helps nothing.


**I hope this helps some players!  It's been a helpful process for me to write it.  Good luck in the jungle, everyone :)**"	t5_2rfxx	True

I've seen my share of computers with LoL and LotRO installed, and I always notice that Pando Media Booster is installed alongside the client. Before, I assumed that it was necessary to run the client, similar to Adobe Air, but after doing a bit of digging I've found that it chokes the bandwidth on computers, allowing the servers of MMO games to breathe a little while patches are being sent out. Pando is a peer-to-peer client that enables Riot to send out updates without putting full load on their servers and also speeding up downloads. As with any torrent client, thus means that while your computer is on, it is essentially seeding out your LoL files, usually requiring massive amounts of bandwidth.

I asked a client if he experienced lag spikes with his LoL games, and he said that he had. Uninstalled Pando, and told him to give it a go...needless to say, no more spikes. Tested this on my own laptop after noticing a few laggy games, and I recieved the same results. I have been running my setup this way for a week now, no harmful affects have been noted. I hope that this helps any of you who are having issues.

The rest however is up to you, the community. In order to provide the best experience, we need you to tell us what you want.

For this reason, we'll be hosting a series of polls throughout the rest of the day in order to determine the structure of ""The Tournament."" Here's a couple things to know going in:

* Prize pool will be minimum of $5,000 and funded by CLG (for first tournament) [Top teams messaged me saying this is the minimum]
* Every participating player will be allowed to stream their games
* We are pursuing the use of Deman and a pro player (TBD) for casters
* If you have any suggestions, please feel free to make a post 
regarding it. Top upvoted comments will receive heavy consideration for inclusion.
* We will make public the revenue generated from each iteration of ""The Tournament."" This will be used to determine the prize pool of each proceeding tournament and provide a sense of clarity to the players and the community.

1350317064.0	11il9l	TPA Toyz opinion on other mid laners in WC	suryd	2293	807	822	"**From his facebook**


以下是一篇關於參加S2大賽12支隊伍的中路玩家分析，排名不分先後。


Below is a list of my analyses of the other midlaners in WC, and it is not in order of merit


**SAJ_NIXWATER** - 雖然他沒有頂尖的對線技巧，但是為什麼他們能夠取得S2的資格甚至打敗DIG多抱2萬5獎金回家？原因在於他們隊伍了解到自己隊伍的缺點找到最適合他們的META，雙中。這個META讓他們把缺點都藏起來了，迫使對手需要重新適應整個遊戲風格。


Not the best mid-laner mechanics-wise, but they beat Dig by realising their weaknesses and picking a most suitable meta. This meta hides their weaknesses and forces their opponents to play with a different style that is favourable to them.


**SK_ocelote** - 對線技巧不錯，但是不足以在世界頂尖選手中取得優勢，也是一位喜歡在6級前遊走GANK的中路選手。年代的過去，他的蛇女再也沒辦法在舞台上壓制對手，球女在S2資格賽對上CLG.EU曝光，小組賽再也選不到。簡單來說是在這次比賽自信的角色並沒有很多。


Good laning mechanics, but not the best, hence unable to acquire advantage. Likes to do pre-6 ganks. With the change of time he can no longer dominate with Cass, and his Orianna was also revealed in his games against CLG.eu, so you could say this time round he was not playing with champions he was very confident with.


**CLG_Bigfatlp** - 曾經第一季的神，遇誰壓遇，怎麼打怎麼嬴。第二季的到來，我也不知道到底是jiji退步了，還是其他選手慢慢的跟上腳步，相比起來他跟世界頂尖的選手對線技巧比起來稍微有點不足，導致小組賽中路都拿不到太大的優勢。振作阿JIJI!


Once a god in S1, he used to win all time, no matter how he played. In S2, I am unsure if he deproved, or if everyone improved, but anyhow his skill his lacking compared to other midlaners. Work harder, jiji!


**iG_Zz1tai** - 擁有一流的打線技巧，喜歡用雪球角色，例如蛇女，斯溫等等角色。跑線能力偏低，因為他喜歡一直壓制你中路，就是因為太依賴使用雪球角色導致他整系列比賽在後期表現得不太好，跟他對線需要更加小心，後期會戰要嬴不會難。


Extremely good mechanics, loves to use snowbally characters such as Cass and Swain. These champions are weak are ganking because he loves to dominate lane, but his propensity of using snowbally champions led him to do not as well in WC. Playing against him you should be careful and you will be fine.


**WE_Misaya** - WE目前來說算是一個全新的隊伍，兩位新成員加入，雖然台柱微笑依然佔領世界前三強AD。隊伍上的配合度不夠，而這次比賽他選用的角色包括Orianna，Vlad，Ryze。Orianna並沒有玩得非常純熟，而Vlad跟Ryze卻並不是隊伍中致勝的關鍵，嬴是穩穩的，輸也是穩穩的。


WE is a new time as of now as two members have recently joint in, though Weixiao remains one of the top 3 ADs in the world. The team synergy is still not there, and his champion pool this tourney comprises Orianna Ryze Vlad. His Orianna play was not very proficient, and his Ryze and Vlad play, while stable, was not spectacular.


**NaJin Sword_SSONG** - Orianna的操控者，在韓國S2資格賽他的Orianna表現得非常好，8強對上我們運用一些選角心理令他兩場都沒辦法選到Orianna，對線技巧不錯，一些中路視野掌握度不夠，除了Orianna以外他需要熟練更多的角色。


Master of Orianna, used Orianna in Korean S2 qualifiers, in Ro8 we made it such that he could not get Orianna. His laning is proficient, but his control of mid-lane with regards to scope is imperfect. He also needs to learn more champions.


**TSM_Reginald** - 也許他已經了解到自己再也找不到S1那種侵略的Style，他往後唯一有比較大影響的只有Karthus，當一個對線技巧不足以讓你打出優勢跑線能力也不足的時候，Karthus將會是最好的選擇，穩穩的農，大招就是全球支援。也許他會選擇S3中淡出職業生涯？我不知道。


He has already realised he can no longer play his aggressive style of S1, and mostly he is most effective on Karthus. When one's laning is not the best, Karthus is the best choice as he is a very stable champion due to his global presence. I am not sure if he will stay on for S3.


**DIG_scarra** - 西門夜說.NA，也許大家覺得我在釣魚，我並沒有:D。有一定的對線技巧，愛嘴炮，自大，把自己整個形象都破壞了。整個年度裡面最大型的比賽卻選擇了Kata，我相信這十二支隊伍裡面都不會希望自己隊伍的中路選手只玩自己想玩的英雄，下場就是被賽前排名12的隊伍打到爛掉。


westdoor0204 of NA. Some of you may think I am trolling, but I am not. He has a degree of laning ability, but loves to praise himself and exaggerate his ability, ruining his image. His Katarina pick was a poor one, and he played a champion that he wanted to play, rather than what was beneficial for the team, causing his team to place last.


**M5_Alex.ich** - 雖然這次比賽他被單殺的次數很高，不得不佩服的是他對遊戲的認知與經驗，這次比賽選用了EVE，Gragas，Zliean。EVE毫無疑問的把IG跟我們都打爛了，實在是想不出任何應對的方式，他會選擇用Zliean是因為他的被動與復活吧，對團隊幫助極大，只是有點過於執著在這個角色了，另外他拿手角色Gragas卻是上個版本被nerf過的角色，當然不會是致勝的關鍵，Alex絕對是我遇過經驗最多最讓人有壓力的一個選手。


I got 1v1-ed by him multiple times and died. I am impressed by game experience and his use of Eve, Gragas and Zilean. His Eve play was spectacular and destroyed both us and IG, and we had no counters. His choice of Zilean was probably because of the ult and the supporting power. However, he seems to have tunnel visioned too hard on Eve and Gragas post-nerf is less of a potent champion. Despite this he is one of the players that have made me most nervous throughout the whole tournament.


**CLG.eu_Froggen** - 很多採訪都有問到我那一位選手最難應付，我的回答是Froggen，為什麼？他是一個永遠都住在中路的玩家，個人操作技巧以及反應都是最頂尖的，隊伍給他的配合也是超過正常中路所得到的，試著想想看一級的Karthus會拿到四鬼、三狼、藍BUFF，導致Snoopeh的各種落後，當然我也很明白他們隊伍整個核心就是Froggen。而賽前我也跟隊友說CLG.eu在這次比賽幾乎不可能取得勝利，為什麼？因為這不是Froggen的年代，他曾經用過的角色一一被nerf，百份之百被ban的冰鳥，Orianna他也許不喜歡玩，幾乎就剩下Karthus了，這真的非常可惜。


Interviews ask me who the hardest midlaner to face is, and I always answer Froggen because his mechanics and all are all top tier and his teammates always support him. Snoopeh falls behind by giving him his jungle, because the core of Clg.eu is Froggen. I have been told Clg.eu would not have won this tournament because all of Froggen's godly characters have either been nerfed or banned, and he doesn't play Orianna, so all he can play is Karthus. It's a waste.


**Azubu Frost_RapidStar** - 決賽的對手，對線技巧不錯，但是在於中路視野控制跟四鬼的控制力不足，導致幾乎每一場都被我outfram，還有一點就是對上我們卻把Orianna放出兩場，不知道是隊伍的討論還是他自己的個人決定，這就好像對上Froggen不ban冰鳥卻又不選的情況是相同的，值得尊敬的對手，擁有最頂尖的Skill shot技巧。把Lux演化成另一隻角色，非常厲害的一位玩家。


I played against him, his mechanics are not bad. However, his lane control and wraiths control is somewhat lacking, and he got outfarmed every time. They also let me get Orianna twice - this is similar to not banning Anivia against Froggen. He is extremely proficient, especially with Lux.


**TPA_Toyz** - 至於我自己嘛....沒什麼好講了XD 只能說這次比賽的表現我很滿意。


I have not much to say with regards to myself except that I am satisfied with my play.

CranberryJuiceMan	2906	1425	953	"What I mean is that a few months ago I used to grind maybe 9 or 10 solo games a day, whether normals or rankeds. I used to have a ball just playing all day and trying out as many champions, builds and crazy things as possible. 

Now, whilst I still enjoy playing this game A LOT when I queue up with my friends, I feel as if sometimes I'm not motivated to play on my own if I dont find anyone. I just dont know if it's the stamina or if I'm growing bored of the game. It sort of annoys me because it's also affected my skill quite a bit. Whilst I was never a very good player I was much more confident with my play, maybe three or four months ago and now I feel more hit-and-miss. And when I miss... it can get pretty ugly. D=

So has anyone else had slumps like these? Or what do you do to stay motivated towards the game? Sometimes I buy skins ^__^


tldr: Sometimes I think I get bored of the game unless I play with my friends, do you get sad on rainy days too?

If you are laning mid, and your passive (Unseen Threat) is on on cooldown, you generally want to walk into a bush on either side. If the bushes are warded, your passive will not activate, because you are not ""Unseen"". If you can't activate your passive,  it means there is a ward, and should notify your jungler.

1372602605.0	1hd60y	An idea for Ahri's ultimate skin	Kintarros	2639	1156	458	"Credits to Kopikatsu from this thread: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3524214

""According to the Shinto religion, Kitsune gain a tail every hundred years. If they live to a thousand, instead of getting a tenth tail their fur turns gold and they become a Tenko, which is a celestial being. (Ahri's abilities are likely based off of a Celestial, since they're capable of teleporting, throwing spheres of light at enemies, etc.)

Idea: Start with one tail, gain a second at 2, then gain a new tail for every two levels up until level 18:

Level 1 -&gt; 1 tail
Level 2 -&gt; 2 tails
Level 4 -&gt; 3 tails
Level 6 -&gt; 4 tails
Level 8 -&gt; 5 tails
Level 10 -&gt; 6 tails
Level 12 -&gt; 7 tails
Level 14 -&gt; 8 tails
Level 16 -&gt; 9 tails


Once Ahri is level 18, instead 10 tails, her hair turns silver, fur turns gold, and gains a slight aura. Have Inari, whom Kitsune are messengers for, talk in place of Ezreal's onboard computer. And so on.

It's been pointed out that Ahri is a Kumiho and not a Kitsune. Which makes it easier. Just name the skin either 'Kitsune Ahri' or 'Inari's Messanger Ahri'."""	t5_2rfxx	True

I recently noticed this while I was playing Ahri and went to get blue; I used charm to help kill the golem and it instantly started regenerating hp until the charm wore off. It's not a huge issue as you can just not use your charm on jungle creeps, however it seems inconsistent with other somewhat comparable abilities (Fears of Fiddlesticks, Volibear and Nocturne).  
Obviously those champions are intended to be junglers, but non-junglers' abilities should still be consistent with theirs.

1360767869.0	18g3s0	How to make champions feel more alive	Sunny724	2289	816	456	"I had this idea a while ago, when I thought about how Ezreal's armor upgrades when he hits a certain level, how Kha'Zix gets new voice lines when he evolves one of his abilities and Syndra who gets new effects on her abilities when it hits max rank (the ground beneath it shatters).
One of my favorite champions is Nautilus, one of the reasons being that when he gets a certain amount of movement speed, his run animation changes and feels much more satisfying.
So this could even be an idea for the next themed skin (like PFE), champions getting new armor when they hit 50/100 armor or magic resist. Somebody getting a new attack animation when you hit 1.5 attack speed or when you hit 200 AD. Or on a mage like Annie, who shoots small fireballs with her Q when she has below 250 AP, but when she gets above that she shoots a huge meteorite of fire. 
Anyway, this was just an idea to make it feel like you're actually making progress when you buy items instead of just seeing higher numbers :)"	t5_2rfxx	True

Singed furrowed his brow and took another drink. He'd come to the Rabble Rouser Inn for a nice tonic, not 
to defend himself.  
""I've got speed to make up for it,"" he mumbled, ""and there's my slow...""  
""Every champ and their support has a slow, Singed,"" Zyra mused, ""and without items you're no faster than 
the rest of us. Frankly, your dependence is a liability, especially with less movement items available."" No 
matter how angrily he glared at it, Singed's glass was still in one piece.  
""Gap-closers aren't everything,"" Singed protested. ""I can get more health than anyone else with my passive, 
and with Madred's Bloodrazor gone, I--""  
""Hah! Madred's might be gone,"" Darius interrupted, ""but you know as well as I do the Blade of the Ruined 
King more than makes up for it.""  
""Never mind a Liandry's Torment,"" Zyra interjected. Singed was beginning to snarl beneath his bandages. He'd 
throw them into the counter, if he could find it.  
""My poison can push like nothing else,"" Singed growled, his voice lifting slowly, ""and it's very effective 
at directing, particularly with a Liandry's."" Singed shot a look at Zyra as he mentioned it, receiving a 
glare in return. Darius looked noticeably irritated at the ease with which Singed shrugged off his 
harassment.  
""Magic resist might be less common than before,"" he snapped ""but with a crystalline flask, I'm not that 
bothered.""  
Slight foam forming in his mouth, Singed bared his teeth and stormed towards the exit. Darius stomped after 
him, but as he reached out for Singed's shoulder, he began to feel weak. Singed stopped, and Darius bounced 
off him, slumping against the wall.  
His vision becoming blurry, Darius looked up to see someone crouching down to him. He felt their breath on 
his cheek, and listened as they whispered into his ear.

1375035328.0	1j85jn	Draven's New Passive: Almost useless	Aldo13	4990	3514	1095	"So I've played Draven. A lot. I mained him on release for quite some time and he's the champ I've used the 2nd most in ranked. I'm not the best Draven or the most knowledgable about Draven, but I will say this:
His new passive sucks.

I get the idea behind it, but it just sucks. I've had games where I was snowballing like crazy, catching axes and building adoration constantly, and by the time mid to late game came around, I would have around 700 gold max from my passive. That was an ideal game and by the time I got that gold *I was already fed, so it made almost no impact.*

Others games where I do okay, I'd usually get about 300 to 400 gold. That's one long sword. By midgame.

I understand Riot wanted to hit his passive for laning (it was OP and it NEEDED it) but completely scrapping it for this was unnecessary.

The worst part is that Riot wanted to nerf his early game, but buff his late game. His late game got worse. Draven's old passive would deal 104 bonus damage over 4 seconds after an axe, stacking. I'm not the best Draven, but I could easily throw an axe every 2 attacks or even every attack when I juggled 2. Thats like having a 104 AD steroid that doesn't scale with crit. And they removed it in order to ""buff"" his late game with some extra gold. Not to mention that gold becomes useless after your build is done anyway (although that probably won't happen often).

My suggestion would be this:
Give him back his old passive,but halve the numbers. Then have it ONLY applies by axes instead of axes and crits. Then allow the damage to critically strike.

Now its damage is HALVED early game, but as you build crit chance, you regain the old damage. Plus it would increase further with IE's crit damage, allowing it to scale harder into late game (like Riot wanted).

/rant

tl;dr: Draven's new Passive sucks, return the old one with halved numbers but let the DoT crit. RIOT PLS"	t5_2rfxx	True

I think they and the level-req on T3 should be removed for two reasons.

1. They are a waste of IP when you get to level 20, you want those anyway.
2. Level 1's with full rune pages can't happen since rune slots are already gated by levels.

edit below:

Alright, so what have we learned? People love T1 and doesnt care about T2. How about buying them at T1-prices and then needing to upgrading them one-by-one. The cost would be the same as if you'd have bought T3 from the start and doesnt make players waste their IP och combining into useless stats.

Another way would be to make runes scale but I don't think it's a great idea since that either makes the rune really cheap at level 30 or really expensive at level 1.

So, pay to upgrade runes with IP. That way, new players wont feel like they want to keep their IP for champions/later runes and everyone would be happy.

Runes should also be removed from the shop when you have the maximum amount of them. (Preferably with a already-own-the-max-amount-checkbox) "	t5_2rfxx	True
1360481025.0	188l1m	It never gets easier.	SlurpeeMoney	3264	1794	201	"It never gets easier. 

Teemo doesn’t feel the blade as it pierces his body, but he feels the force of it. It’s like a heavy punch to the back, a warm spill across his fur. He can see the tip of her sword sticking out of his belly, bits of viscera dripping from its length. He didn’t see her coming, and now he’s going to die.

Again.

He knows it. He can feel it already, that familiar dulling of the senses, the sudden, impotent panic. He’s felt it a thousand times before, and he remembers each time vividly. Dying is not the sort of thing you forget. Stabbings, shootings, arcane lightning, the white-hot burning of a turret’s ether, the searing pain of Baron Nashor’s acid breath… He’s died a thousand deaths, each unique in its pains.

It never gets easier. 

Every time, there is a rush of adrenaline, blind panic. He can escape he can run he can hide he can fight death won’t find him this time because he’s clever and he’s quick and he’s armed to the teeth and he’s got so much experience there’s no way he can die right now. Sona was around here somewhere, she’ll play him that healing song she knows. He might have a potion; he doesn’t have a potion; why doesn’t he have a potion? 

He lies in the grass, his back propped against a low rise, letting the river’s cool water flow over his legs. Downriver, the water flows crimson with his life’s blood, and he marvels at the way it clouds and swirls before his vision slowly darkens and he finally lets go.

It never ends there. 

Out in the world, maybe. He doesn’t know. The summoners probably won’t let him go that easily. Here, though, it never ends with death. That was the old way, when brothers and sisters would kill one another over a petty land squabble. That was war. Here, death is a matter of inconvenience. It’s a penalty for poor strategy, for being unprepared. A single champion might die a dozen times over the course of a conflict, and no one bats an eyelash. 

The conflict has run a long time. The ancient magics that hold him to the service of his summoner grow weaker as the battle rages on. They take longer and longer to pull him back from the brink of void. His consciousness hovers, disembodied, on the very edge of extinction. He’s scared, every time, that this is the time they won’t bring him back. That all-consuming, instinctual terror of death seems to last forever. 

Without warning, he can see. The cold marble of the platform feels smooth under his skin. He’s breathing, as natural as if he’d never stopped. There’s a moment’s disorientation, a bit of dizziness, but he doesn’t have time to think. Ahead of him, he can see Fiora piercing a half-dozen minions, pushing relentlessly towards the first turret, and that requires the whole of his attention. 

He runs, refusing to let the fear that tingles the base of his skull stop him.

He can’t avoid death forever.

It’s a reality of the arena.

And it never gets easier.

A big congratulations to Taipei Assassins (Mistake, LilBallz, Stanley, BeBe &amp; Toyz) - I met these guys in Taiwan, where I stayed with them for a week.. Fully deserving champions and I wish them the best - it's a lot of money and I'm sure it will change there lives. - http://i.imgur.com/kUB5H.jpg (*picture of me with the champions and some cool people!*)

The past year has been fantastic, having met fans all over the world - your support for this game has been phenomenal and long may it continue! Together we are breaking records throughout the Games industry - reaching almost 1,000,000 concurrent viewers (*not including Korean Television or China numbers*). The crowds for these events are getting bigger and bigger - http://imgur.com/a/tJZ6h

You the community justify eSports - attending in your thousands and tuning in online/via TV in the millions .. these numbers speak volumes and to grow the industry &amp; attract the sponsors, we need you!

Also a huge thanks has to be extended to Riot Games - they are pushing boundaries that haven't been pushed before... doing production on a scale that we haven't seen in eSports. While there was teething problems, you have to understand I seen the faces of the Rioters then ... there was no one - other than the teams more heartbroken than them. They put COUNTLESS hours behind making the Season 2 Championships as awesome as they possibly could be and despite some hiccups - I think they did a fantastic job! The finals yesterday were absolutely mind blowing - I take my hat off. When the orchestra was playing Chris Linke's piece on Season 2, synced with the Video.. I had nerd chills - absolutely fantastic!

As a team, sure we are deflated - knowing we came so close to being in those finals was heart breaking. An emotion I'm sure that Moscow 5 shared - but alas.. We can only look forward to Season 3 and what it brings - even more epicness on an even larger scale.

To everyone involved in making Season 2 be as amazing it was, give yourself a pat on the back - That includes the players, the community, the organizations, the tournaments, the journalists, the interviewers, the content creators &amp; of course.. Riot Games.

“Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so.” - *Noam Chomsky*

Let's step up &amp; work together in making season 3 even better than season 2 ;)

1365341477.0	1bungs	Idea: adding new, cheap starting items (theory)	meepoorfeed	4279	2820	733	"**EDIT** #1 Frontpage, guys I LOVE YOU ALL

Adding new ""subitems"" for various starting options.

for example:

**Short Sword** : 4 AD 180gold|                     


2x **Short Sword** +40g builds into 1x **Long Sword**



**Fragment of a Ruby Crystal**: 200g +70 Health|




2x **Fragments** + 75g builds into  **Ruby Crystal**



think you all get the point
same for Amplyfing tome, Sapphire Crystal . . etc

**of course, those starting items could also build into Dorans example: Ruby Fragment + Short Sword + 115g = Dorans Blade**

this would open up an incredible amounts of starting possibilities

you could start short sword + fragment + 3 pots for example
or whatever u desiere.

just an idea :P


EDIT: For those who think this will ""delete dorans as starting items"":

Dorans ARENT starting items at all, **some exclusions like Dorans blade adc** or Dorans shield toplane or whatever but still, except of blade those dorans start are pretty rare or ""noobish""
You buy dorans to get a HUGE early game boost when u get Firstblood or similiar things or if you need some backup for mana reg or whatever.

THOSE ITEMS are ment for the start:
If you just want more AD without having to start without wards/pots or similar situations




Edit2:

Only thing I want to be added, are those ""mini starting items"" nothing would be changed, JUST this.
So no Price changes, no combination changes.. Just the ""small starting items"" divided into 2 ""smaller ones""

PS: excuse me for my bad english :/

Examples
* **Short Sword**
* **Amplifying Page**
* **Cotton Shirt/Armor**
* **Ruby Shard**
* **Sapphire Shard**
* **Magic Muffler/Hood**
* **Knife**
* **Leather Gloves**

There are many other great players in Korea that more people should see.



I want to thank my teammates for carrying me in so many games. Even though I win MVP, it was only possible with the support of my teammates. Is hard to dive when no one there to carry your dive goggle. I also want to thank Frost so much. They will continue to be strong team and Shy is just so scary to play against.

I am personally someone that would love a package like this.

With the whole ""e-sport"" thing being dominant, a lot of new players are going to want to try and compete at this game and most likely want to practice a designated role.  So why not release Support, AD, Jungle, AP, Bruiser, Top lane packs that have the ""essentials?""

1371912582.0	1guvcj	Math on bans	synplex	2560	1100	562	"So most people say that Riot should increase the bans per team to 4 so i checked the patch notes when riot increased the bans to 3 per team.     

It was the patch V1.0.0.129 when Fizz was released back at the beginning in Season 2. At that time there were 86 champions with Fizz it were 87.    

So 4 bans and 86 champions were 4,65% which can be banned from the pool. Since Riot increased the bans to 6 while having 87 Champs you could ban 6,9% of the pool.     
At the moment weve 114 champions and still 6 bans which are 5,26% of the pool. so if you project it up we will reach the  4,65% with 129 champion which means actually the 130 champion should also bring the 8 bans with it and we would be at the 6,15% ratio.     
      
**TL;DR:** Pre Fizz ban ratio was 4,65%; 129 champ will have same ratio     
      
**Typically Frontpage Edit:** Thank you for your comments ive read them all. And furthermore i just wanted to say that I'm not complaining about having in all 6 bans i've just did some math!!!

**Annie** got a model rework, which lead to a huge spike in play.

Pick Rate: 3% --&gt; 9%

Win Rate: 48% --&gt; 48%

**Blitzcrank** received nerfs to his base mana and mana costs but he remains an extremely popular ban.

Pick Rate: 15% --&gt; 13%

Win Rate: 48% --&gt; 48%
 
**Cho'Gath** got another slap on the wrist with silence duration nerfs. 

Pick Rate: 22% --&gt; 22%

Win Rate: 48% --&gt; 47%

**Elise** had her mana costs increased which reduced her ability to be a lane bully.

Pick Rate: 12% --&gt; 11%

Win Rate: 51% --&gt; 49%

**Ezreal** received more nerfs (to his passive, ult, and base movement speed), but he still remains extremely popular.

Pick Rate: 48% --&gt; 47%

Win Rate: 49% --&gt; 48%

**Katarina** received some tweaks to discourage the ""tank katarina"" build that Voyboy popularized.

Pick Rate: 14% --&gt; 12%

Win Rate: 49% --&gt; 49%

**Kennen** had the energy cost of his ultimate removed which might help him manage his energy better.

Pick Rate: 4% --&gt; 5%

Win Rate: 51% --&gt; 53%

**Master Yi** had his AP scaling on Meditate cut in half, which was a significant blow to his most popular build.

Pick Rate: 10% --&gt; 5%

Win Rate: 49% --&gt; 46%

**Miss Fortune** lost some of her AD scaling on her ultimate. This does not seem to have significantly hurt her power in solo queue.

Pick Rate: 30% --&gt; 28%

Win Rate: 56% --&gt; 56%

**Nasus** can now stack up his Siphoning Strike quicker by killing large creeps. Though this change is nice, it does not seem to be enough to solve Nasus' problems.

(LOW SAMPLE SIZE)

Pick Rate: 1.1% --&gt; 1.8% 

Win Rate: 45% --&gt; 45%

**Nunu** had his Blood Boil absolutely crushed. Nunu was never the strongest solo queue support, so this change has significantly dropped his pick rate and win rate.

Pick Rate: 33% --&gt; 24%

Win Rate: 50% --&gt; 44%

**Olaf** had nerfs to his Undertow, Vicious Strikes, and Ragnarok. It's not too surprising that his stats have suffered significantly.

Pick Rate: 21% --&gt; 14%

Win Rate: 47% --&gt; 41%

**Shaco** , traditionally one of the strongest solo queue junglers, has been brought down to size with nerfs to his Deceive and Two Shiv Poison. 

Pick Rate: 12% --&gt; 7%

Win Rate: 55% --&gt; 51%

**Sion** received changes to his Enrage similar to the Nasus and Veigar changes. It seems that these may have made Jungle Sion somewhat more effective.

(LOW SAMPLE SIZE)

Pick Rate: 1% --&gt; 1%

Win Rate: 45% --&gt; 49%

**Tristana** received some small buffs to help her early and mid game. They have helped a small amount although Trist remains rather unpopular and low win rate.

Pick Rate: 7.5% --&gt; 9%

Win Rate: 44% --&gt; 46%

**Tryndamere** got some buffs to his base attack speed and fury retention which seem to have helped him a bit.

(LOW SAMPLE SIZE)

Pick Rate: 1% --&gt; 1%

Win Rate: 43% --&gt; 47% 

**Veigar** did not seem to be helped much by the buffs to his Q as his compatriots (Nasus and Sion) were.

(LOW SAMPLE SIZE)

Pick Rate: 1.5% --&gt; 1.5%

Win Rate: 44% --&gt; 43% 

**Volibear** got some nice buffs to his base attack speed which will help him stack his W and apply his ultimate more effectively.

Pick Rate: 3% --&gt; 3%

Win Rate: 48% --&gt; 50%

EDIT:

**Alistar** was stealth nerfed by removing the .5 second stun from his W. Apparently this was not intended and will be hotfixed in the near future. Regardless, the changes have been pretty brutal for our favorite cow.

Pick Rate: 11% --&gt; 9%

Win Rate: 44% --&gt; 40%

EDIT 2: Forgot Shen too G_G

**Shen** had some more minor nerfs, this time focused primarily on his jungling.

Pick Rate: 10% --&gt; 9%

Win Rate: 47% --&gt; 47%

EDIT 3:

**Heimerdinger** got some minor buffs that didn't change too much.

Pretty self explanatory. A guy in chat says ""i play Maokai as a tree"" we understood that he was going jungle in some way, yet turned out he was supposed to go top, (which in my opinion is fine). But he went near the right side, like you see in the pictures, and stood there till 15:00 That is when the rock ulted him and made him run.

No, he was not AFK, he was throwing sampling all the time. And after he was killed, he bought 2 items and then ran to the red buff and just went willy nilly all over the place.

**I will not say his name, because that breaks the rule of witch hunting/personal attacks** but i can say that he is Silver II, and seems to be that he did this the second time now, judging at his match history.

http://i.imgur.com/Wn1tCHF.png

And at the start of the game he said ""Hi this is SIV HD, and i play Maokai as a tree"". In after chat he said ""i'm so drunk xD"" 

Oh and no, he is not SIV HD, i don't know how to prove it since i can not show the guys name, but he just said it for copying SIV HD, like most people do.
____________________________

Fun for some one as it may be, it ruined 4 peoples and probably 5 others gameplay. Playing a game should be for fun, but i think this kind of ""fun"" should be limited to Normal, not Ranked, for peace sake, because of this clown i lost one of my placement matches.

You can do support Poppy, jungle Heimerdinger, ADC Nunu, jungle Olaf or anything else, **but for fuck sake, at least try to win, rather than proceed to make us lose.**


Seemed like he was drunk or something like that, but still we had to report him for ruining our gameplay and he will probably get a ban or a warning for sure... Checking him, he seemed like a non-toxic player. But you know, that is what drinking does to you. Don't drink alcohol kids, or you might get banned.

**TL;DR:** Don't play while drunk, or you will wonder why are you banned afterwards and blame tribunal for false information.

No hard feelings, but come on...
__________________________________________________
EDIT: Lost my placement matches. Thanks Maokai.

EDIT: Frontpage? Do i get free RP? Only Karma? Ok...

Edit after a nap: I have read some comments and now i understood something. I will not be playing ranked a few days. You people should also be careful if you don't want to lose your matches...

Edit Edit Edit Ed it Edd it Edit Edit: Those who say he will not get banned, because tribunal can't judge this kind of scenario, i have screenshots of him and his real username...i mean come on, if i want him to get banned, i can just submit it to the Riot support ticket. I have the power! I won't do it though. The tribunal is the judge for him this time.

1371335753.0	1gf8er	So, I've encountered lvl 3 player in a bot game...	nygus20	2625	1170	761	"He was playing xin. And of course other 2 players (one was actually nice) flamed him like there would be no tommorow. I get it, guy could not even buy an item, didn't know what lane to go etc. but guys, guys (and girls, they say there are girls in league), cmon.

Players who flamed him were silver 5 with 800 games and guy with 473 games (unranked). So they could win a bot game even if it was 2v8. They shittalked poor xin just for the sake of it, just to blow their steam off, and I raged inside looking at that guy, who said nothing entire game, quietly trying to learn some basics. I talked to him after that and added to my friend list to help him out later, but thats not the point.

Is this community really that rotten that we are gonna bully new players for shit like that? I mean, its a mode for practice, for fucks sake, not for competitive play, you are gonna win anyway, you are gonna get 71-0-11 with your khazix (u soooo guuud), why are you making another person (real person, he exists outside your screen too) feel bad (he doesn't know the community. He probably don't have thick skin for that level of toxicity)?

Damn, I just wanted to say that I hate community at times like this. I usually say that it's not bad, that cases like this are easier to remember and happen less often than we think they do, but DAMN I'm pissed now.

TL;DR  Just played a game and have seen our community behaviour towards new players at its finest. I gues its ""DAE new players are stomped by smurfs etc."" Tuesday. But I feel better now, I hope that xin will play again tommorow so I can talk to him more.

Edit: its actually Sunday here, not Tuesday, silly me.

* There are **111,469,176** possible different ways to set up a 5-man team.

* And a total of **12,425,377,198,118,976** (yeah that's in the quadrillions) possible different 5v5 matches.

EDIT: Bonus fact!

* [The average number of games per day is 864000.](http://www.riotgames.com/news/riot-games-celebrates-end-league-legends-season-one-registered-players-surpass-15-million-over) So, **it would take *at least* 39.4 million years at this rate to go through every combination.**

EDIT: Wow! I didn't expect this post to get as popular as it has. Here are some more:

* Draft Pick (banning 6 and no repetition on either side) would give you a possible **9,758,150,446,164,120** (quadrillions) of possible games. primerion pointed out that if I included the bans as possible unique choices then the number would come out to **5,089,954,010,045,192,190** (quintillions) different possibilities.

* I'm using combinations and permutations for my maths. For Normals it would be 108! / (5! * 103!).

* The next new champion that Riot releases will create another **1,223,467,706,730,465** (quadrillion/million billion) new possible games.

EDIT: Changed the Draft Pick number to 9.8 quadrillion. Since the bans don't effect the possible games.

They already know all the books in and out so it's all about stories they never heard before. One day, after I've played lots of Amumu the day before, I thought, why not use his storyline to tell a (maybe more child friendly) version of how this little mummy was always alone and then found some friends etc.

The kids seemed to like it so when I got home I went throught the LoL champions roster and tried to find more stories that I could tell those 3-6 year olds. Turns out LoL is full of really good lore about drama, friendship and adventure :)

I already have stories prepared about all the yordles, Ashe, Tryndamere and all the Freljord guys make for a fantastic fairy tale, Kayle and Morgana will certainly evoke the right feelings about sibling rivalry...

What I'm trying to get at is twofold: 1. I hope Riot is ok with me bending their lore a bit to make it appealing to little kids; 2. Thank you Riot for giving me countless hours of story telling time :)

Cheers guys

Tegea	2427	982	319	"Hey, I’m the guy behind [www.lolnexus.com](http://www.lolnexus.com/scouter), a site that lets you lookup ongoing League of Legends matches quickly and easily. 

My goal was to create a means for players to easily find summoner info on every player in a match during the loading screen, allowing them to get a sense of what they’re up against. Or if you’re watching a streamer, you can easily lookup their match and see the details of every player and even spectate the game if you want!

Take a look at this sample image right [here](http://i.imgur.com/ssPPcb5.png?1) to see it in action
*****
A quick list of some of the features: 

- See who is in a premade 
- Find out every player’s ranked tier for all 3 seasons
- View the exact runes/masteries they are using 
- See how many ranked games they've won with their champion
- Spectate the match with a click of a button (requires LoLReplay to be installed)

*****
Although this site has been around for a bit, I’ve kept it low on the radar since I wasn’t sure how stable it would be (it's technically still in beta). But I’ve been improving it a lot over the past few weeks, and I’m happy to say that I feel this site is ready for fellow League players to use! Hopefully you guys will find it as useful as I do.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, I’d be glad to hear them! You can post a comment in this thread or send me an email on the site’s contact page. Thanks for checking it out and I hope you enjoy using it!

*****
edit: The site getting flooded with traffic, so it may respond slowly. I am working on increasing capacity, so hopefully it doesn't crash!

edit2: I realize people are having trouble with the Spectate feature. The spectate button requires LoLReplay (www.leaguereplays.com) to work. I unfortunately cannot help much with any issues related to the program itself. You'll have to contact them yourself on the site.

edit3: Seems like my site is still crashing despite my efforts. I'm still working to improve my site capacity. Hopefully everything should calm down by tomorrow

-The First Law of League: As an enemy Garen remains MIA, the probability that he is in the brush you are about to facecheck approaches 1.

--Schrodinger's Corollary: If Garen is not visible on the map, one cannot know if Garen is in a given brush until one facechecks it and collapses the quantum waveform. Ergo, until a bush is facechecked, Garen is simultaneously both in and NOT in the brush.

-The Second Law of League: A champion must obey all orders given to it by a summoner, unless that order would be crucial to winning a fight. In that case, the champion must fire their skillshot in the exact opposite direction.

-The Third Law of League: A player choosing an unconventional role / build / character on the enemy team will carry his or her team to victory. The same player with the same role / build / character on your team will be 0/13 by the end of laning phase.

--Shaco's Corollary: The performance of a friendly Shaco is inversely proportional to the performance of the enemy Shaco. Or, for every Shaco there is an equal and opposite Shaco.

-The Fourth Law of League: Any player saying ""mid or feed"" will do both.

-The Fifth Law of League: If there is a Teemo present on either side when a team fight begins, Teemo must die before any champions on either team can be killed.

-The Sixth Law of League: Any action is worth the result as long as one types ""WORTH"" into all-chat afterwards. [DLSev] 

--Doublelift's Corollary: Only the first calling of ""WORTH"" dictates worth. All other callings are subsequently nullified.

-The Seventh Law of League: Winning or losing is secondary to having both teams understand who is to blame, so the appropriate reports can be filed by the other 9 players. [Bane1998]

--ELOH Corollary: It is statistically impossible for you to be the cause, or even contributing factor in your own team's loss.

----ELOH Corollary 2: The first ally to notify his or her team that the game is lost by entering 'gg' nullifies the LP loss, and cannot be the target of the ELOH law.

-The Eighth Law of League: When a mistake is made, the offending party must point out a mistake from an ally of equal or greater value. [Campaine]

-The Ninth Law of League: Any time the enemy team will engage a powerful neutral monster, your jungler's smite will be on cooldown. [gerodork]

--Smite's Corollary: In the event your jungler does have smite available for dragon, the enemy team is already taking Baron Nashor. 

-The Tenth Law of League: Any spell with a substantial cooldown that would be critical to winning a fight will come off cooldown approximately 2 seconds after your death. [DownvotesAllYourShit &amp; Trophaeum]

--Death Defied's Corollary: If playing Karthus, it will come up 9 seconds after your death, and the entire enemy team will be below 200 HP.

-The Eleventh Law of League: Responsibility for failure is inversely proportional to farm priority. Everything is the jungler's fault, or else the support's. AD and AP Carries inevitably play flawlessly. [WRXW &amp; Zeltheo]

-The Twelfth Law of League: If all five members of your team are playing roles and champions they generally enjoy, Summoner 2 will dodge. [irojo5]

-Lane Victory Exclusion Principle: If one or more of your teams lanes win their lanes, another lane will lose to an equal or greater extent. [SamIAm1223]

-Hecarim Uncertainty Principle: It is impossible to know where Hecarim is and how fast he is moving simultaneously. [SamIAm1223]

-Blitzcrank Pull Theorem: An enemy Blitzcrank will always pull your team's Orianna or Miss Fortune. An allied Blitzcrank will always pull the enemy Amumu. [yoyomeep]

1360595542.0	18b7hs	Something Needs to be done about challenger tier	PGTundra	2083	654	426	"Ok, so I know I'm not exactly speaking for the majority here but capping challenger tier at 50 players is incredibly stupid.

First check http://www.lolsummoners.com/ladder/euw/2
That will give you an idea of just how many people are currently in Diamond 1 on 100 points now with 0 incentive to play solo q.

Why is it 0 incentive? Because when we win we get +0 when we lose we lose LP and then fall out of the ""Queue"" for promotion series, as you can see from the link there is ~40 people who are currently at the required LP and division to enter a promotion series for challenger but it has been capped at 50. 

I understand that challenger is for the very very best but currently challenger tier is for the first 50 people to rush through the ladder and get promoted and diamond 1 is for the people who have the ability but weren't fast enough.

And as a side note I appreciate the attention the rioters and generally everyone in this thread have provided as I understand that I am in a very small percentage of the player base and unless you are a pro it's normally hard to get messages out so Thanks

Although there is a bunch of you that know me, for those that don't I want to introduce myself:
----

I'm **Stephen ""*Snoopeh*"" Ellis** a professional League of Legends player and part of Counter Logic Gaming *(Europe)*, which means I play the game at a very competitive level and get paid to do it - via *salary, streaming, prize cut &amp; sponsorships.* 

Recently turning 21, coming from Sunny Scotland - I've been doing it for closing in on 2 years now and I've had an absolute blast, travelling all over the world and competing against the best teams league has to offer.

While I'm sure a bunch of people who have been following me for the past 2 years will have questions - I also want to give those who may not know much about *""Professional Gaming""* a chance to understand what it is, how to get into it and any other relevant questions they may have!

Frequently Asked Questions:
------------------------
---
**How did you become a top player?** The best way to do this currently, I believe is to play solo queue and climb up the ladder to 2500+, this will get you noticed by other top players and they will want to form teams with you or create new teams. That's how I did it.

**What do you think about Season 3 Changes?** As you have seen from Morello and Xypherous - there is plans to overhaul Season 3, I think it's interesting - I love change. I believe it will require a bit of tweaking before it's ready, especially the jungle - it's very hard to balance. Full credit goes over to the guys at Game/Live Design - it's really not an easy process.

**Will we see more carry junglers in Season 3?** At the moment, it looks like Riot wants to stray away from the ""Support/CC Orientated Gold/10 Jungler"" - which in turn will make the Carry junglers like Nocturne, Udyr, Jax, Lee Sin .. way more popular. A few other things  will become viable again, which will be interesting!

**Who is the best jungler?** This question will come up every time there is an AMA, regardless of role.. There isn't a single answer. Every champion has it's own strengths and weaknesses - there is no ""one pick beats all.."" Unless it's something that is broken after release or buffs ;)

**What does it take to be a top team?** Being the very best team, is not about how popular you are.. which some of the western teams have lost sight of - the Asian teams strive to be the best, not the most popular and consequently produce the best results. The Western teams are going to have to get more structure and take things more seriously if they want to compete in Season 3.

**What have you enjoyed the most in the past two years?** Without a shadow of a doubt, the best thing for me has been the incredible people I have met a long the way. From other players, Riot Games, the community, tournament organisers and even the locals I've met on my travels - I'm in a very privileged position and I'm very grateful of it.

1358813071.0	170sd3	Effect of pre-season balance patch #2	trollzcatz	2115	682	656	"Since week passed, lolking updated statistics for champion popularity/win rate.

[](/alistar) [**Alistar**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/alistar#statistics)

His buffs briefly stopped his slight long term decline, but did not reflect much on his rather low win rate.

*Picked:* 11.5% -&gt; 11%

*Wins:* 43% -&gt; 43% 

[](/amumu) [**Amumu**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/amumu#statistics)

Minor nerf resulted only in minor popularity decrease. His win ratio is virtually unaffected.

*Picked:* 10% -&gt; 8%

*Wins:* 55% -&gt; 55% 

[](/annie) [**Annie**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/annie#statistics)

Annie experienced rather higher spike that quickly dissipated, her lower sample makes it hard to compare effects of buffs, but right now she is experiencing slight increase.

*Picked:* 2.75% -&gt; 3.75%

*Wins:* ~49% -&gt; 51% 


[](/blitzcrank) [**Blitzcrank**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/blitzcrank#statistics)

As Amumu, nerfs to Blitzcrank did not leave any significant impact on his popularity or on how well he is doing.

*Picked:* 15% -&gt; 15%

*Wins:* ~49% -&gt; ~48% 

[](/corki) [**Corki**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/corki#statistics)

Mana changes had no impact on number of plays or wins whatsoever.
Corki is on decline for quite some time so patch is not really something that made any change to it, so stating averages before and after would make this a bit confusing.

*Picked:* ~7.5 -&gt; ~6.5

*Wins:* ~45% -&gt; ~45% 

[](/diana) [**Diana**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/diana#statistics)

Diana is back in the game, her popularity and win ratio skyrocketed once again. Perhaps she was not nerfed that hard and people were just panicking?

*Picked:* 2% -&gt; 7%

*Wins:* ~40% -&gt; 49% 

[](/evelynn) [**Evelynn**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/evelynn#statistics)

Evelynn experienced big lost of popularity and her win ratio was cut severely. However it's still relatively high considering that people did not have enough time to adjust to them.

*Picked:* 14% -&gt; 7%

*Wins:* 55% -&gt; 47% 

[](/ezreal) [**Ezreal**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/ezreal#statistics)

Ezreal experienced slight decrease in his popularity, but surprisingly high decrease in his win ratio (actually 2%, but considering his data is quite big and stable sample, it's quite a lot for single change)

*Picked:* 55% -&gt; 51%

*Wins:* 51% -&gt; 49% 

[](/katarina) [**Katarina**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/katarina#statistics)

Even though nerfs were quite substantial, she did not notice any change.

*Picked:* 16% -&gt; 16%

*Wins:* 49% -&gt; 49% 

[](/khazix) [**Kha'Zix**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/khazix#statistics)

changes to him resulted in slight decrease of win rate, his popularity experienced slight decrease around patch release, but is increasing again.

*Picked:* 18% -&gt; 15%

*Wins:* 51% -&gt; 49% 


[](/leesin) [**Lee Sin**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/leesin#statistics)

His huge popularity was decreased slightly, and so was his win rate. Considering the severity of nerfs he got out in relatively good shape.

*Picked:* 41% -&gt; 37%

*Wins:* 50% -&gt; 48% 

[](/nami) [**Nami**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/nami#statistics)

Apparently nobody cared about those changes :(.

*Picked:* ~2.75% -&gt; ~2.75%

*Wins:* ~45% -&gt; ~45% 

[](/rengar) [**Rengar**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/rengar#statistics)

Experienced huge spike in popularity, and slight increase in win ratio. However his popularity is dropping back, and he still loses too many games.

*Picked:* 2% -&gt; 6%

*Wins:* 40% -&gt; 43% 

[](/riven) [**Riven**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/riven#statistics)

Riven experienced several percent decrease in her popularity, however her win ratios were not affected very much.

*Picked:* ~16% -&gt; 12%

*Wins:* 51% -&gt; 49% 

[](/syndra) [**Syndra**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/syndra#statistics)

Syndra received small spike of interest, her win ratios are slightly increasing, but data here is very unstable to judge impact of buffs.

*Picked:* 1.7% -&gt; 2.3%

*Wins:* ~41% -&gt; ~43% 

[](/talon) [**Talon**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/talon#statistics)

Talon lost quite some popularity but still wins most of his games. Once again possible example of panic effect.

*Picked:* 5% -&gt; 3.5%

*Wins:* ~55% -&gt; 54% 

[](/udyr) [**Udyr**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/udyr#statistics)

Apparently buff to Udyr's passive brought interest of some people, but did not hold well.
His numbers are pretty unstable to judge relatively high win rate increase, which is going to be more obvious as another week passes.

Sorry for missing this guy.

*Picked:* 2.5% -&gt; 2.75%

*Wins:* ~45% -&gt; ~49% 

[](/vi) [**Vi**](http://www.lolking.net/champions/vi#statistics)

Even though Vi is not played much more after patch, her ratios improved quite substantially to 50%.

*Picked:* ~4% -&gt; 6%

*Wins:* ~45% -&gt; 50%

1374959393.0	1j6hjl	Riot should team up with Twitch and create a Twitch Twitch skin	Jrrj15	3639	2206	507	"Create a Twitch Twitch skin. I figured it would be a cool idea like how Smite created the Ymir twitch skin for people who streamed Smite.

He could wear a robe with the Twitch logo and Twitch colors on it. All his poison marks could be purple and when he has max stacks on his target instead of the crossbones it could be the Twitch logo above their head.

Abilities:

Q~ He could disappear into a puff of purple smoke.

W~ Throws a purple substance instead of a green one.

E~ Pretty much the same thing that normally happens except purple also if 
the mark of the Twitch logo is above their head it explodes with a little cool animation.

R~ The Twitch logo could appear over Twitch for a short second then disappears and his bolts turn into Purple bolts of lightning.

I'm a terrible artist so i'm not going to draw this but if someone would like to that would be awesome!
I just got this idea today while playing Twitch for the first time. Thoughts?


The comments on the last post had tons of great ideas like the poison marks being Twitch emoticons like Kappa and also ideas for special Twitch related jokes.

Reposted because the mods deleted the last post.

EDIT: Front page. Cool.

EDIT2: Also some people in the comments are talking about Riot partnering with Twitch. And it doesn't have to be a partnership it can just be like a thank you skin to Twitch for what they have done for the community."	t5_2rfxx	True

EDIT: after reading some of the comments, I do agree that buying 4 PDS on sona should not be bannable. I now want to use this as more of a tool to accompany other evidence for a punish, rather than a guaranteed ban. Revised the post to reflect this. 

EDIT2: could also determine when the items were bought, similar to pro builds.net. Credit to meloetta for this idea

EDIT3: My idea is not that items should be included in determining punish/pardon, which seems to be a lot of the complaints. Since items are included in the case, clearly riot thinks they matter in deciding whether to punish/pardon. My idea simply improves this. "	t5_2rfxx	True

I just played a game as Caitlyn and it seems that Riot has changed how Caitlyn's ult works as her target goes into fog of war as the *initial* animation (or ""wind-up"") starts. Rather than going on a shorter cooldown of something like 3 seconds if she loses vision of her target like it did before this patch, it now goes on it's full cooldown.

To be clear, I am only talking about losing vision of her target *during the wind-up animation*, not the 1 second channel she goes through as she's lining up her shot; that still gives vision of her target and works as per usual.

I know this description may be somewhat vague, but I'm sure fellow Caitlyn players will know what I'm talking about and furthermore, how detrimental this can be. I'd go so far to say that it actually denied me 1 or 2 kills in the game I just played.

**tldr; Casting your ult as Caitlyn just as your target goes into fog of war makes the ability go on full cooldown as of last patch, rather than having a shorter ~3 second cooldown like it used to.**

So yeah, has anyone else noticed this? Is this an intended (ninja) change, or something bugged?

**EDIT:** So it seems this has happened before and was fixed promptly, so hopefully it will happen again! Thanks guys."	t5_2rfxx	True

Then it hit me we dont have a penguin champion and that is something that we really need because penguins are undoubtfully the most awesome animal in the world. So if you guys like penguins you should opvote this! Hopefully Morello lead champion designer will see this and he can design: Pengoo because that would totally have to be his name. K THX BAI

Passive: March of the Penguin

Quinn's movement causes him to gain Courtship stacks up to 100. When Quinn attacks a target with 40 Courtship stacks, he spawns a small Emperor Penguin that attacks the original target until it dies, then seeks out enemy Champions. Penguins last for 15 seconds and and can have no more than 6 out at a time. Penguins scale off of Quinn's attack damage.

Q- Belly Slide

Quinn glides on his belly for a few seconds, increasing his movement speed and leaving an icy trail behind him that slows enemy champions and increases friendly champion's movement. Quinn stops upon hitting an enemy champion, applying the slow and dealing bonus attack damage.

W- Flutter

Quinn and all active penguins flutter their feathers, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies. If Quinn is within range of his penguins, both him and his penguins gain bonus armor, increasing for each penguin hit.

E- Eggsecute

Quinn lobs an egg a short distance, doing a small amount of magic damage. If Quinn walks over it, nearby enemies take additional magic damage and Quinn is healed for a small amount. Costs 25 Courtship stacks in addition to mana.

R- Momma's Home!

Momma arrives back from her long journey and she ain't in the mood. Momma copies all of Quinn's abilities, dealing 25% of Quinn's damage and doubling Quinn's maximum Courtship stacks. Additionally, all penguin's go in a frenzy, gaining increased attack speed.

1370882558.0	1g1xu8	I'd really like to be able to decide my team's pick order in Ranked 5v5.	Mondeezy	2085	662	301	"Recently my friends and I have began playing more ranked 5v5 (and it's a blast - I recommend everyone try and get some friends to play it with). Unfortunately, our support and jungler have the lowest MMR on our team, as well as the smallest champion pools. This creates an issue because our top, mid, and AD carry have to choose our champs first at risk of being countered, and due to our jungle/support's small champ pool, we can't swap many champions (i.e. one of our teammates only has support champs because that's what he plays, so he can't give me many top champs to choose from).

I'd really like the picking method from Season 2 to be reimplemented (your team picks in the order that they were invited to the party) in order to give ranked 5v5 the tournament-like setting it is supposed to imitate. This would allow the team to set the pick order to their preference (support first pick, jungle first pick, whatever), and would prevent being at a disadvantage solely due to the fact that some of your teammates are lower rated than your other teammates.

Does anyone else have any thoughts or similar experiences? I think it'd be a fairly simple solution to implement, and would make the atmosphere of arranged 5's even more competitive."	t5_2rfxx	True

1362819523.0	19yq3k	Wanting to build an LoL team + salary + house	kruzweb	2558	1138	758	"Hey guys,

I want to startoff saying this isn't a troll post, for what it's worth. I have cash and want to start an LoL team and manage it (not be a player) to compete on the National level. I have cash for salaries and some great locations to live. I want to bring out the mystery and provide consistent pay for players and build a solid career for players. I helped do this in Woman's professional soccer, and I feel like eSports has just the same chance to succeed, if not more. We offered more than competitive salaries which forced everyone else to either step out or make way, making the marketplace for top-tier talent very high.



Anyways, just wondering if anyone knows the best way to get started. Thanks!

**ideas so far**:


+ Finding a manager that is a pro player or ex-pro player that could bring some great experience as well as potentially be able to attract some top talent
+ Pubstars do not necessarily make a good 5s team
+ Talk to existing teams (LCS and non LCS) to be able to find what their current structure is
+ Have multiple paid (but not as much) teams / a ""farm league"" like sports teams do to source new talent
+ Possibly not a ""house"" to be able to go overseas for the non-US teams (not my favorite idea yet)
+ Reach out to some non-organization bound teams that already have a great image: Cloud9 and Square Duck
+ Build on a well-established team - what would users like to see, and what would they purchase? (merch, video content, tutorials, guides, riot-integrated webapps, ???)
+ Host a big tournament with cash prizes
+ Documentary TV series of up and coming players
+ Contest for all-expense paid trip to visit and hangout with the team/go to a tournament
+ Highly competitive girl team 
+ Starting a trello board to track progress with everything and get key community members involved"	t5_2rfxx	True

I'm not trying to rant here, just hopefully some helpful info for people who are used to playing bot games and not used to being on the other end of a smackdown. I'm not high ELO or anything so if you are and you're reading this thinking I'm dumb, take that into account.

If you are 0/3 after two ganks and you haven't seen your jungle in a while, understand that you are considered a lost lane and sacraficed. That's not to say ""you suck, go uninstall"". Just learn that in that situation the best thing for the team is to focus efforts elsewhere. Sure, I'll still drop a ward for you now and then, but turtle up, farm or go roam mid, something besides pushing and yelling at me. 

Take a second, assess your team, press tab and see bottom lane ADC is 5/0, mid is 3/0 and the jungle is currently 0/0/6. You don't need to start crying about another lost game yet.

Let's say you go 0/4 because you decided you're the best and will make your comeback because of your L337 skillz and push your lane to the enemy tower. When the enemy top laner who has 3 kills on you already is standing behind his tower spamming laugh, understand you're about the get wrecked. Get back to your tower.

After the inevitable wrecking don't spam ping your tower that has a quarter life expecting someone to abandon their lane or an easy gank for a futile situation. When they get there the enemy will be gone as will the tower. That would be the bad decision that loses the game, not the decision to let you sink or swim on your own. Again, not trying to be cruel here, take my wolves, get some items, contribute to teamfights.

If the chatlog is full of ""nice gank!"", ""great timing jungle!"" ""[Enemy] Srsly? That wasn't even funny, wp mao"" the next thing shouldn't be you saying ""GG, bad jungle no ganks."" You sound immature and foolish.

TL;DR Sometimes you don't roll your lane, don't take it personal when you get left. Understand that your role in the laning phase has changed and that you probably won't be the one to carry the game. Stick it out and we can still win.

It was a trolly kinda 1v1, so I picked up Elder lizard as first item and interestingly enough the elder lizard passive applied when he attacked my shield. Might not seem like a big deal but he just couldn't trade with me. Every time he attacked me he took the initial magic damage back from the shield and was then burned for another 15-45 true damage. Without me doing anything he took almost 100 dmg by hitting me with 2 autos at level 5-6, and did about 165 dmg to me. I mean when I traded back, I was able to bring him close to half health in just a single trade, and take reduced dmg because of the added armor from the shield. Maybe this was widely known, but I sure was surprised when I lit a whole minion wave on fire with just my shield up. I don't know if this is on the live servers or just pbe, but with elder lizard I don't see how an enemies laning phase could get more annoying. :P	t5_2rfxx	True

A simple suggestion turned into a discussion about whether or not Nasus Q farm in the jungle is significant or not, and now the entirety of this thread is a desperate plight to downvote me as much as possible.

This is a prime example of how little this subreddit utilizes Reddiquette and how shallow many of the posters/lurkers here are. Several people have messaged me completely dumbfounded at the amount of downvotes I have, and some have even expressed that they refuse to post to the subreddit due to fear of similar backlash as seen on my posts in this thread. Whether I'm posting in agreement to what someone's saying, arguing, stating facts, or posting something not even relevant to the topic at all, I am being blasted with downvotes, to the point where every single post I've made in this thread displays *[GENOCIDEGeorge[S] comment score below threshold]*.

1346224742.0	z0cqg	Dear Riot, as we look towards Season 3, I think we need to have a big look at how we allow for innovation in LoL	rhyno012	3017	1604	1398	"When I look at other competitive games such as DotA or Starcraft 2, their big pull for me is not that they are amazing spectator sports (although SC2 is pretty damn good), it's seeing what amazing strategies people can come up with. This is the same pull that I think a lot of pro players feel - they want to come up with the thing that completely changes the game, they want to be the Boxer of LoL.

In LoL, however, we can all admit that while the metagame is fluid, it has very specific boundaries that can't really change. Nobody has sent Annie to bot lane. Nobody has tried playing no Jungler. The greatest thing that I believe has happened was Dignitas's famous ""protect the Kog'maw comp"" with an AP soraka mid and a Mundo jungle.

What happened to that team comp? Riot nerfed it into the ground. What happened when we saw a focus on global ults? Riot nerfed them. What happened when people realised you should max W on Ezreal and it's great? Riot nerfed it. I understand why they nerfed them, but I believe that for the sake of League of Legends' growth as a competitive game, we need to look at the reasons for fiddling with balance.

As I see it, Riot have a very clear image of what each champion, each item, each ability should do, and how they should be used. When they are usable outside of these roles, these possibilities are taken away in some form. By now I'm sure you all can see where I'm going with this: Riot, how you believe a champion should work and how they do in reality are allowed to be 2 different things, and if you see a champion being played in places you didn't foresee ( e.g. AP mid Soraka, Lulu everywhere) you really shouldn't see this as a bad thing. No, this is a GREAT thing. This is what drives the metagame along. This is what fans of the game love to see. Figuring out what each champion can do is the Hallmark of a MOBA game. It's what makes us different from other eSports.

When Terrans in SC2 realised that Blue Flame Hellions were a big deal, what happened? Blizzard did nerf them, sure, but they kept them usable. Today (as far as I know) Hellions are still perfectly usable and a great unit. Is AP Soraka viable? is mid Lulu? probably not. I expect the same thing to happen to AP Rengar in a few weeks.

So what's the solution? It's actually kind of simple. Don't be so quick to swing the nerf bat. That's all. If something is being played a lot, let the players try to deal with it first, because promoting innovation is what balancing the game is supposed to do. Patches like the Rumble nerf where when his Flamespitter was fixed made his numbers simply too high is OK, that's what you'd expect because it actually is broken. Nerfing Malphite because he beats the bruisers that he is supposed to beat and has a good teamfight presence is not OK. I am certain that AP Soraka wasn't OP. I am certain that AP Janna wasn't OP. I am certain that AP Rengar isn't OP. Nerfing those was/is a mistake, because they remove the choice for innovation.

If AP Soraka beat every other AP after like a month of collecting stats, then it is fair to say that she's OP and nerf her, but you should still leave her as viable because what is wrong with allowing options for players?


Thanks for reading this and I hope you take this into account in the future.

TL;DR: Don't nerf something when it is played differently to how it was intended, because that innovation is the beautiful thing about competing within system like a videogame: You look at what is known and you try to prove it wrong.

PS: Don't adopt this policy until after Season 2 is over, it really is too far into the season to change the way you balance the metagame, it would wreack havoc on the S2 finals.

---

**Freljord Hold'em** - Each team is given the same three champions, the two players from each team not getting a predetermined champion will get to pick freely as blind pick.

*Goal*: Who can make the most out of getting the same three champs. You might need a tank or hard initiate, perhaps a carry or some CC.

---

**Mirror Image** - Each team is randomized the exact same teams.

*Goal*: No imbalance in the comps, comes down to rune/masteries, team play and skill (and who has the better skins).

---

**Cursed Touch** - Each team is randomized their champs. Each team gets to reroll two opposing champs.

*Goal*: Get the worst offenders out of ARAM, see how good a team is without that Lux, Zyra or Yi.

---

***Royal Rumble*** - Standard draft, but with only 20 randomly selected champions.

*Goal*: Who can draft the best team with a limited champion pool?

---

***League of Draven*** - All players gets the same champ.

There have been some negative comments and innuendo regarding our decision to run a non traditional composition of champions and I feel it best to comment on this for the sake of setting the record straight.
 
Curse plays to win. Our number one goal was to finish in the top two teams in order to achieve a first round bye in the LCS first season split. From our perspective, nothing is more important that preparing for the playoffs, winning North America and going on to Worlds. If you have ever watched our team interact, you would know that we are an intense group, sometimes to a fault, with a reputation for working and preparing for games exceptionally hard.
 
In this particular case, we had a game in the LCS that was not significant in the sense that winning or losing would not improve our standing in the league. As such, we took this opportunity to try an unusual team comp in the hopes that we would learn a thing or two about what would work at the highest levels of competition. This is no different than in other sports. In football, for example, teams who have secured their spot in the playoffs will often rest starters, try different plays and compositions in order to better prepare for the upcoming playoffs. For us, nothing is more important than winning when it counts.
 
Despite the unusual team composition, at NO TIME did any of our players ever not give 100% toward winning the game. There is nothing to gain for our team to produce a “troll” team and not trying our hardest. The stakes are too high and the opportunities are too great to waste a game against top talent to goof around. Curse is a professional organization and so are our players. We owe it to our sponsors, our fans and to Riot to work as hard as we can in advance of our cause; to be the top team NA.
 
As for the few voices we have heard that has accused Curse of not giving it our best shot, we take the high road. They are welcome to say whatever they like. We will continue to do what we do best; take down teams in North America and do our very best to win the first split playoff. To shift our players focus from this goal to respond to cheap allegations is a waste of their time and counterproductive.
 
To our fans, thank you for standing with us. We hope to make you proud in the playoffs.

1349751262.0	116cm2	Season 2 Finals personal experience: ocelote.	oceloteWorld	3705	2315	868	"Hey guys. Ocelote here from the hotel.

Ill be sincere letting you know that reading all the stuff im reading thru these days is making me not feel comfortable.
Community is missunderstanding everything quite a bit, and I would like to clear things out.

Some of us work hard, bringing a professional behaviour to the table, trying to reach the goal of making eSports something that everybody knows, talk about and even practice in a daily basis... And then? The catastrophe happens. Internet issues, discussions about some teams cheating, rumours surrounding us.... All this, killing the purpose of reaching professionalism. And all this, in the S2 Grand Finals. Disaster.

Im in eSports for quite long already, and thru these years I developed my knowledge in a way that I actually understand when, how and why things happen around Gaming, and thats why Ill give my honest oppinion about this topic:

1. First of all, I wanna make clear that no company behaved like Riot until now. They are giving everything for Gaming. They actually care about what people has to say, either proplayers, amateur or even casual ones.
2. No company put in practice the ideas Riot is bringing until now. Let's Open our eyes for a moment, do we realize where were the groupphase and brackets being hosted? We were right in the Stapples Center. One of the very most known and valuable places in California. Where Los Angeles Kings stadium (NHL), ESPN headquarters, Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers stadiums (NBA) are hosted. Near by Los Angeles Convention Center...
3. So much on the line.
5million prizepool year? Probably multiplied for Season3?
We are living a dream, we are living the beginning of the change.
4. The meta changes however the community wants to. As one of the most important reasons buffs/nerfs and changes are done is the feedback from the community.

When it comes down to this event:

1. Proplayers got treated extremely well. Before, meanwhile and after the games. We got everything covered, with a good hotel, good meals, cabs/shuttles, tickets to visit fun stuff, rioters taking care of us, chance to practice before playdays... Im pretty sure every professional competitor will agree with me on this one.
2. Remember when internet went down? Me, from a reliable source, can ensure u guys that the internet troubles were, not at all, Riot's fault. There was literally nothing Riot could have done better. But that's something Riot will never say. That's not the way they handle things. And that's definitely something laudable.
3. Remembering when internet went down again, it comes to my mind what Riot did. Instead of finding excuses to cover themselves, they rushed a way to make the customers happy. Ordered pizzas for everybody there, gaveout stuff and entertained the crowd however they could. (props aswell to every shoutcaster that was casting by then) Deman, Jatt, DJWheat; not counting Phreak, Rivington and Rachel.

About cheating:

1. Cant really blame players for using their senses in a moment when everything is on the line. (implying iG probably did it versus us). Nobody cant say ""I wouldnt do it"", cause even tho thinking about it with a cold mood u would never do it, who knows in a moment like that, where you just want to win. 
Im not defending them, im just saying that in those moments, when emotions make you shake, sometimes you can't even control yourself.
Lemme put it this way, If a football player had a chance to score a goal with his hand, wouldnt he do it?
He knows it's bad, and probably he woll blame himself afterwards, But in that moment, everything is engaged in a different way.
2. Riot commited the mistake of making able that to happen, but believe me,mthat wont be a problem in upcomming events. That mistake wont be repeated, for sure.

All these points are meaning that we should really lend a hand right now. Have patience, wait and see.

Grand Finals are soon, And I can put my hand on fire knowing that everything will run smooth. Be sure Riot won't commite twice the same mistake, ever.

Im not gonna be playing there, as u know already, as we got owned in groupphase by better teams. But Ill be watching the finals LIVE, as the respect for this sport and my opponents keep me here. So no, Im not gonna take the early flight and Im gonna make sure I enjoy one of the best shows in eSports, ever.

See you there.
ocelote.




TL;DR: lend a hand, Riot is doing good. Dont be so hard on them and help this to grow with positive feedback. Work together to make this grow. See u in the finals.

Just a few examples. 

You could have an EU, and NA pack with all the casters from both sides appearing in their regions pack. (both packs would feature Phreak and Deman) 

""welcome to summoners rift"" could be said by Phreak. 

In the time between the welcome and the announcement of minions   spawning you could have Rivington ask who wants to see team red win with a simulated audience cheer and kobe could ask who wants to see blue team win with the same fan fair. 

As the game progresses you could have recorded lines for towers falling, dragons and barons being taken (if in vision of it) along with deman getting more and more hyped as the multiple kill count gets higher and higher. 

Basically this addition could make your average solo queue game feel like an LCS match and would be great with replays coming out soon as you'd have a bit of mini commentary built in! 

Feel free to chime in with other ideas and of course riot pls. 

TLDR: riot could make a mint off  LCS announcer packs. 

Edit: wow I never expected my idea would gather so much feedback thanks to everyone who has tossed in their ideas and let's hope the money people at riot see this :D"	t5_2rfxx	True

1365173406.0	1bqhis	Make CV a viable passive support pick, by giving it gp10 when it's OFF CD	Twobuttons	2929	1548	639	"First of all, I'd like to acknowledge that this thread is here to open a discussion, and the examples given are strict speculation. Please do not post comments like ""you can run a poke-sustain botlane with 21/0/9 masteries on ADC"", as we all know they possibilities are almost limitless, and it does not contribute anything to the discussion. CV stands for the summoner spell Clairvoyance.

Let's say the current botlane meta divides into two sub-metas: 

* **Aggressive** kill oriented/poke lineups 
(Support preferably with CC, ADC with AD marks and Quints and 21/9/0 masteries)

* **Passive** farm oriented/sustain lineups 
(Support preferably with sustain, ADC with lifesteal quints and 19/0/11 masteries resulting in 9% lifesteal 3% spellvamp)

Now speaking of Support summoner spells, a kill setup would obviously want to pick either exhaust, ignite or both to the lane, to make the killing easier. 
But what about a farm lineup? 
Exhaust and heal are the defensive options, but they're used as an emergency rather than to provide any additional gold gain for the user, because you'd prefer avoiding engages. 

Imagine a sustain/farm setup, that's playing extremely passive. Let's say the ADC (Caitlyn) wants to rush IE on Lifesteal quints and 19/0/11, just by safe farming. In this hypothetical situation, the only additional gold gain on support are his gp10 items and runes. He's doing a damn good job, by keeping ADC safe and sound, but a well played kill lane support will have his additional gold from assists, whereas a passive support has nothing to compensate the gold and *build* difference. 

How about we make CV a viable passive support pick, by giving it bonus 5 gp10 when it's OFF CD. Each time you use it you will loose the passive gold gain, so you won't spam it every time it's available.

I love the idea of making CV a viable Support summoner spell, but in it's current state it's underpowered.

**EDIT**: Bonus gp10 OFF CD means early game you wouldn't use it as much, as it gives you the passive. On the other hand late game gp10 isn't as attractive, and you gain more map awareness of CV. Keep in mind that you won't always be in the winning team, that has majority of vision on the map, and CV would be the summoner spell that should compensate this.

**EDIT 2** I will sum up other CV enhancement ideas that were mentioned here &amp; in previous thread. I assume that two CV balancing threads in two consequent days mean that people actually like the idea of bringing that rusty summoner spell back into the meta. 

**EDIT 3** **Bolding** the most poplar sugestions. 

* Flat passive gp10

* **Gives assists if enemy is killed with vision granted by CV**

* **True vision (including wards)**

* Stealth detection

* Isn't visible to the enemy team

* % bonus XP gained

* **Merge it into a new *On use* item**

* Flat bonus stats (armor, mr, hp)

* AOE buff/debuff when used in teamfights

* +Gold on spotting enemy

* +Gold on cast

* Increased gold on assists

* Lingering vision leaves a debuff that grants bonus gold on kill

* Longer CD, allows to place a free 60s ward *anywhere* on the map"	t5_2rfxx	True

1367849840.0	1dsjww	Why isn't there a Division 2 planned?	Zankman	2709	1327	607	"Quite simple, really. 

Right now, everyone is talking about how unfortunate it will be to see teams falling out of the LCS, maybe even disbanding, how bad the promotion tournament is (flawed, rather) and so on.

One of the more common topics is ""If these amateur teams keep disbanding because they can't play in the LCS, every new season will be the same, since only the top teams will remain. Every season a new amateur team will form, compete but at the end of the day they simply won't be able to stay with the elite."" 

The obvious question is - why not have LCS Division 1 and 2? 

Both could have 8 teams. The Div 1 teams would fight for the top prizes and places in World Championships, while the Div 2 teams would obviously fight for a Div 1 spot. 

Instead of having weak, inexperienced and relatively new teams challenging seasoned LCS teams for a LCS spot, we could have teams from Div 2 trying to get into Div 1, which would make more sense and would certainly be more fair - and exciting. 

""Amateur"" teams would fight for Div 2, then. Sure, they would have a  hard and long journey to get to Div 1, but when and if they *do* get to Div 1, we would know that they are ""worthy"". 

Obviously, this setup would provide a more balanced system. It would help everyone - Div 1 teams would have more scrim partners, while Div 2 teams would have a stable, regular and competitive *professional* environment to practice, develop and grow in. It would help elevate dozens of teams *and* the league(s) itself. 

The **issue** with this is obviously a possible over-saturation in competitive content (I personally wouldn't mind, I'm not forced to watch) and, from Riot's part, an increase in expenses. 

So, such a system has a few things that would need to be addressed  - 

Would they cast all Div 2 games?

What would be the prizes? 

How many teams would be promoted to Div 1 (and how many would be relegated to Div 2) at the end of each split? 

---
So, at the end of the day, such a thing would be a big feat to organize and keep active, however, I'm feeling like it is **necessary**. 

I mean, Riot has decided to take control of the entire competitive scene - a monopoly, basically. In that case, they really need to think about the future and upping the quality of the amateur scene. "	t5_2rfxx	True
