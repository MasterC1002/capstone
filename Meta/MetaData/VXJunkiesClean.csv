I've just come back from the Delta Symposium and I am upset beyond words. Not sure if anyone else from /r/VXJunkies was there as well, but let me tell you what happened:

As you know, the Symposium is organized by the Breckental Society - the same guys that led most of the work around Mornington axions back in the late 80s, so a bunch of really intelligent creative guys; I think some of their members are fellow VX junkies, actually.

Up until now all the discoveries done by the Breckental Society were available under public domain for all to use and chances are, if you're active in this field, you have either come across their work or results based on their work: cascading resonance studies, URS inversion, Volkstrum performance ranges, delta improvements beyond the usual sigma^2 bounds and the lesser known vitrium conducters (the so called ""vindictive reactees"") which power most of the pre-3 VX models. The reason why I'm telling you this is because that moron Friundurn came out last night at the end of the Symposium and said that the Breckental Society will have a change in direction, focusing on commercial applications and **KEEPING THEIR RESERCH SECRET**.

This is a terrible blow to the VX community and something has to be done.

What's worst is that this times horribly with the Volkstrum Y-aa models law: http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/1fjmoh/new_law_may_be_passed_that_would_put_volkstrum/

Katherine Yalgeth had an affair with one of her students in 1990 - I forget his name - and I was the result. I was kept a strict secret - if knowledge of my existence was leaked onto the electro-hydrodynamic theory scene, my mother would have been ruined. I was kept chained to a dead koala bear in a basement, and fed only with pencil shavings and bricks. I was occasionally let out into the sun to frolic in the grass, but I later found out that they had treated it with DDT in an attempt to dispose of me. Anyway.

My mother died in November 2001, in a tragic accident - she was tasked with trying to break the Yalgeth limit by the US government, who threatened her with deportation. They were trying to create a superweapon for the upcoming war. The official story is that she died trying to break the limit - but I know that she deliberately triggered a multiple-cylinder Dormison's paradox, overloading Grant's Apparatus and killing herself so that she would not have to be an agent of war.


I was released from my basement, given a false name, and I set out to start a bakery. But nothing was ever enough. I wanted more. I wanted VX.

I bought my first VX module a few years back - I was a young fool, I had no idea what was going on - I didn't even know how to calibrate the Jung-Juarezian vortex loop (and I put in the Telhartic absorber upside-down) :P. But last week, something happened, something incredible, something which I cannot explain.

I ran up my module like usual (basic VX6, you know the drill) synced up the DPM, set the G'sA to the normal settings, Put the Wobble-Optic Nu Delta Coordinates to (44, 2.3444), started up.

I don't know what happened, I don't know how it happened.

I looked away for a fraction of a second. I looked back.

The delta, for one brief, fleeting moment, was 0.89.

I immediately turned the module off - I didn't have time to worry about the dangers to the Zanzibanian array - and stepped back. I tried again, taking pictures of all of my settings. I turned it on. I waited. Nothing happened. I looked away. 0.89. It remained there for what seemed like a year, but was actually two seconds. I was too scared to leave it on. I cut the power again.

I am so scared. I am naked, crying, and surrounded by computer parts. Help me find out what happened, VXJunkies. Replicate the experiment. Here are the specifications.

VX6 Basic
Brit DPM 2005
Digitech Telhartic Absorber Serial X03HS, set to zeta-lambda-1
Digitech Grant's Apparatus Serial 23kF0, set to basic 4
W-ONDC set as above
Zanzibanian array from Best Buy (It was the day before payday)
Jung-Juarezian vortex loop, calibrated to Bell benchmark

Edit: Replaced the display as suggested. Same result. Set the W-ONDC to recommended accuracy (44.0000, 2.3444). Same result. I am about to attempt something very scary indeed. I am going to let it run for five minutes and see what happens. Wish me luck. Starting in one minute.

Edit 2: Calibrated. Starting.

Edit 3: It's at .89 as usual.

Edit 4: .895

I first got into the field when I was 13, just a casual VX user, not doing anything too crazy, until I discovered a new way to reroute the Armistan Codex to improve my transitional fealdorian rate. Then I went crazy, and found different ""hacks"" that I could use my machine for, eventually programming it into my home's electrical system and running a very efficient house, saving my parents time and money (from electric bills).

I started getting noticed around 17, when I did the same thing on a massive scale for my school, making it extremely energy efficient. I was offered a job in the industry, where they would send me to conferences and test me by giving me new, difficult challenges. I had to ""improvise, adapt, and overcome."" I've got some great stories from that time in my life.. haha. Eventually, my successes as a frontman for the industry earned me a spot in the third-highest rank as a regional manager. I'm hoping to become continental manager one day, but I've got some hurdles to jump through before that happens.

Anything you wanna know?

EDIT: Seems a lot of people want to know what, exactly, the VX is. Here it is, in lamen's terms:

A Volt Xoccula module is a lot like a computer, but with more industrial functionality. It has several, several parts that can be constantly upgraded, replaced, hacked, and changed in as many ways as there are stars in the sky.

Sorry in advance, /r/VXJunkies, I'm gonna have to rant on here for a little bit and hope I can send the results to anyone else I have to explain this to. I'm never going over this again in person.

First: It's too difficult to get a manufacturer's license for Volt Xocculas in the rest of Eurasia. Yalgeth, the genius behind defining and proving the first iteration of Yalgeth's Limit, is pretty much responsible for that. On the one hand, if Oatmeal was smart, they'd be obsessed with Yalgeth, not Tesla, but somehow VX isn't popular enough. (Double Reinfroch bends, by Leimholtz' name. If only I never had to speak on them again.) Anyway, as I understand it, Asia's VX scene pretty much isn't - Yalgeth ruined that for us with his lack of business sense.

West coast and Western European designations are extremely similar, in all honesty. I live on the West coast, and the scene is unfortunately quite laid-back here - we're stuck on personal computing and everyone's excited for fission power and quantum computing, there's no interest in the Big Thing Of Dude This Has Been Around Forever. So we just copy whatever Europe has to say and trim off a couple letters.

(Primarily G and L designations - the difference subtle and nobody really cares. Let's be honest: Nobody actually uses non-G/L VX models, if the designation is relevant (we always have to preserve the second Hvørdan law, due to the Hvørdan Complex). I prefer the Western European approach because it's traditional and precise, but that's how the West coast works. (M is inconsistently removed, for obvious reasons.))

Now, here's the true bane of new VX junkies when they try to start talking with the experts and placing their first orders: The East coast is insane.

I'm sorry, but it's true.

When a Western European refers to the model VX6-AJL xI by Crunch, a true East coast junkie will write out VX-22A.dxI.

People get tripped up by this notation all the time. It's a crude conversion according to its delta magnum point as compared to Yalgeth's limit - a way of showing increase in *power* of a module, rather than being subjugated by the safety inspections of the European authorities. They call in parts of the Leimholtz formula in order to try to justify the difference, saying that since it's so important to the function of the device, we should overlook authority. That's a legitimate concern, but it causes ridiculous errors when trying to communicate to VX proteges.

In all honesty, East coast designation is an underground thing, and most parts you find there are marked down both ways - like English and French up in Canada, or English and Spanish in most of the USA.

I mean, this a subtlety most of /r/VXJunkies doesn't care for, and I generally appreciate the pragmatism of this group. I'm just sick and tired of explaining business subtleties like this to newer members.

Anyway, if you see VX-22A on here ever again, try to convince them to use a more commonly accepted standard. That's what naming is for - a point of reference. It's fine to use in personal settings, but when talking with other groups, *please* use the international standards.

C_IsForCookie	61	16	21	"Here's a small FAQ I've put together highlighting some important aspects of VX Modules. We hope to have a more in depth FAQ up soon, as well as a possibility of a Wiki. Just remember guys, we're trying to build a big supportive community of VX lovers, so the faster the word gets out, the more motivated we can all get about some serious VX mods!

* What should I expect from my brand new VX module?

&gt;The VX6 is designed to systematically draw correlations between various active points in a statistically unbalanced chemical markup, in order to reduce reactivity in its final solution. This is done by using deltas. The higher the delta the machine can function on, the more efficiently is can draw correlations based on corroborating separate inconsistencies in pressurized environments. In order to do this without failure, the machine must achieve its prime vector. Of course it can also be used to solve physical logic problems, or make music and light displays from scratch.

&gt;A Volt Xoccula module is a lot like a computer, but with more industrial functionality. It has several, several parts that can be constantly upgraded, replaced, hacked, and changed in as many ways as there are stars in the sky. Basically, if you have enough technical know-how, you can do ANYTHING you want with the machine.

* What model is currently in production?

&gt;The VX Module is in version 6 of production, effectively called VX6.

* What standard performance should I be looking for in my VX?

&gt;Deltas of no less than .35 with a Vector of 6 should be used to gain sufficient results. This is based on the work of Ralston.

* What is Division 4s record?

&gt;Division 4 hit Yalgeth's Limit at .88 deltas, yet unfortunately collapsed asymptotically from there.

* What type of hardware should I use in my VX?

&gt;Consumer based VX modules should be equipped with Mornington model center fluxes while industrial models would be best suited with Calibras. Other auxiliary hardware is usually user preferential and too long to list in this FAQ. For more specific questions about center y-tube converters and pressurized head gasket caps, as well as other internal and external parts, ask our friendly subscribers.

* What happens if polarity becomes unstable in my unit?

&gt;Try reintegrating the valien module parser. Polarity usually becomes unstable after rebooting the chronodynamic.

* What type of insulation should be used on my VX?

&gt;There are a few models to choose from. Among them there are the L-2XD ion insulation plates, and the upgrade to those, the XL-3SD. With these models, it is a general consensus to cool the system to at least 246 Fankels.

* What if I don’t cool my machine and it overheats?

&gt;If your Fankel reading is too low your machine could overheat and the specular rod could melt into your antifodder reader

* Does Tea-Tree oil improve the performance of my module?

&gt;There are no conclusive results of this hypothesis.

* What is The Hans-Rodenheim law of vectoral momentum?

&gt;It explains how increases in vector conversion rates transfer across planes of delta cooler.

* How can I avoid energy consumption if I have sigma range problems?

&gt;Use a silicone forensic disruptor chip model 377Aa.

1302636644.0	gog6l	"Time to set the record straight on this ""Flux 
Capacitor"" crap."	squidmd	55	7	7	"Time and again I have seen non-VX users dismiss VX science as wankery,  uselessness, or even outright fabrication. And it's an easy mistake to make. 

Think back. There was once a time when *you* probably would have assumed that anyone talking about a ""Neturon-shielded deIzensen Mechanism"" was blowing smoke. For the uninitiated, any sufficently advanced field is indistuingishable from nonsense, and this holds especially true for non-mainstream technological fields like VX.

But we can at least make an *effort* to get ourselves taken seriously. And folks, step one of that effort is cracking down rampant use of ""Flux Capacitor"". So let's set the record straight right here, once and for all.

As you all know, and as just about everyone knows, a Flux *Capacitor* is a *fictional* device from Back to the Future, which enables time-travel. There is no ""Flux Capacitor"" in VX science, plain and simple. Not in the time travel sense, not in any sense. 

Unfortunately, there *is* a Flux *Capacitator*. If you're not familiar with the basics of VX, it's function is difficult to explain (sorry). Suffice to say, it's a key component of any VX module because it allows the operator to modulate the electrostatic flux across several dipole traps, protecting the main ion-resonance chamber from overflowing its capacitance. If you didn't comprehend all that, don't worry, it's not important. The key thing to understand is that a Flux Capacitator is a *real* and *important* VX component that is *in no way related to time travel or Deloreans*.

But a field as interesting as VX is bound to be dominated by a certain type of person, and this type of person strongly tends to like certain types of movies. As a result, a whole bunch of us started referring to our capacitators as capacitors just because... well, we thought it was cool. And this slang became so widespread that no one thinks twice about it, and sometimes you even see it repeated in conference presentations and published articles.

But I think the time has come to retire the joke. VX funding is still well behind what it should be, and public perception plays a huge role in that. As much as it pains me to say it, I think that the full name should be *required*, and we should do our best to (nicely) enforce this requirement. Maybe someday, when the masses have been educated about the limitless possibilities of VX research, it will be safe to reintroduce our little joke. But until then... let's respect the extra syllable, alright?

It all started a couple days ago, when I was working on my own VX4 unit - I'd finally managed to get my hands on a remanufactured Optimus CR-306 metaprobe (the last one I had was fried by an XM spike that somehow managed to bypass the Wolfe-Klein dampers) and I'd finally managed to synchronize it with the crystalite resonator array.

Anyway, I ran the standard recalibration routines - five delta-QX runs at 1.21 GeV, three full temporal isometry calculation sequences, and a Bragg-Henry matrix - and everything seemed to be just fine... until I switched it into fifth-mode output.

This is really just a test post from my VX Lavalator to see if it actually goes through.

After acknowledging the error, I knew I should rush to post my findings so others don't run into the same issue (as the infrequency of posts indicate that there is, indeed, some issues out there.) So, to resolve the issue at hand: open the VX, take OUT the luxorn paneling (wear grounding gloves - this is a MUST,) grind down pin #5x-e (NOT F! I REPEAT NOT F! I almost made that mistake,) then carefully check the exterior paramators for any loose beta nodules. (Thrifty tip - you can get cheap calcitrant washers from most hardware stores.

1374285203.0	1io6z9	Kickstarter project to build a Feynman VX	sukivan	40	5	9	"Hey guys!  
  
I have recently inherited some vintage VX schematics from my great grandfather. He was a janitor at Caltech, and he tells me that Richard Feynman (THE Richard Feynman) was a big VX enthusiast. Feynman would regularly stay in his office well into the wee hours, trying every trick in the book to measure the potential drop across his VX plasma canisters without disturbing the adjacent neutrino field (ha, haven't we all been there?!). Rumor has it that Feynman even forced his students to remove their shoes before entering his office (pursuant to Yalgeth's lesser known Second Law).  
  
Of course, with the pervasive discrimination against VX owners at the time, a man of Feynman's stature had to keep this hobby to himself. Towards the end of his tenure, Richard gave my grandpa a set of schematics for an improved Feynman VX which *possibly* may be able to exceed Yalgeth's Limit by truncating the non-zero values of the Binomial Sigmoid Function. Does this sound too good to be true? There are some ketchup stains on the schematics, so I might be missing something important here and be completely out to lunch.  
  
Anyway, I would love to build this unit and see if it works, but the cost is prohibitive, and it looks like I will need to recruit someone with a PhD in Hydroplanar Engineering just to construct the Torus Manifold. So I figured I could try to do it as a Kickstarter project, but I know that VX has fallen out of vogue lately (thanks a lot, Obama!), and some people are skeptical about the political (not to mention moral) ramifications of a delta output over 0.88.

1294306821.0	ex5ua	Look, it's the elephant in the room. Let's just get it out in the open. We need to talk about The Belgians.		40	8	3	"There was talk at [Gottingen 09](http://vxmodules.wikia.com/wiki/Gottingen_09) that they were onto something unusual. We've all heard the rumours.

Then there was VX Camp in Boston in April at which various more specific ideas were flying about. I wasn't there, but everyone on the East Coast was saying they'd found some new coefficient, in the .86 range. How can there be a new coefficient? Exactly. That's what I thought. But hear me out.

I've dug out the proceeding of a conference held in Ostend, Belgium where [Vermeulen](http://vxmodules.wikia.com/wiki/Hannah_Vermeulen) was due to give a paper. The reason most people have missed it is, it's been mistranslated as the ""Fifteen Conference"". Think about it. The Belgians call VX ""XV"", just like they call NATO ""OTAN"" and AIDS ""SIDA"". So it's understandably been interpreted as XV, roman numerals.

Anyway. [Mertens](http://vxmodules.wikia.com/wiki/Jakob_Mertens) gave a paper, and in it, the proceedings, sparsely reported in the Journal, say that he ""recited out a long numeral"" (sorry my French isn't great) and ""joked, etcetera etcetera"".

If you actually go to the transcript in the University library, you'll see what he actually did was *get to a portion of the coefficient which repeated* paused, and then said ""and so on"".

I know you're going to think I'm crazy, but what if he wasn't joking? What if he'd actually crunched through all the data and found a non-random sequence of the coefficient? That after the 137th digit, the digits *are non-random from there on*? Effectively, you could stop looking for coefficients past the .87 mark if that were true. You'd need some really *big* input power, but, once you've got that? Game over, my friend. Game. over. That whole space is opened up.

Look, it's late, but I have to post this, just to get it off my chest.

Vermeulen was *supposed to give a paper*, title unknown, at the conference. But she didn't. And [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5sOfO8Ei1h) (taken on a cameraphone at the afterparty) shows Mertens being asked why she didn't turn up. He jokes in the subtitles that she ""inherited some money from her father"" then changes the subject.

But if you actually speak Walloon? **That's not what he says**. He says she got some money from ""Papa"". (Her actual father, it turns out, died in 1978 in a gardening accident, so it's unlikely she'd have had to wait that long for an inheritance).

Am I crazy? Could he have meant Pan-American Physical Acquisitions? The shadowy VC firm which is rumoured to be funding VX research?

1310932932.0	is79p	Had some VX trouble yesterday in the laboratory.	joke-away	39	9	4	"My lab works with a refraction chamber attached to a 6 ferrocore VX (V:6.4 δ:0.80, all the delta that government money can buy) through bi-stable EPR manifolds.  Administration has had us running nonstop lately: 2, sometimes even 3 test samples a week, all pushed through the highest frequency sigma scanning. As was inevitable, yesterday during our dry run one of the techs forgot to crank the spin shaft after hitting the 12th vector, and we blew out the D-Separation valve. Literally *blew out*, as the steam from the sublimating coolant expanded so rapidly that input panels in the next room shattered.

I called the administrator personally and told him that I was very sorry, that we could not go on with the test scheduled for that afternoon, because our primary VX was going to need at least a week's worth of repair and the auxiliary VX would need a level 6 diagnostic before we could safely hook it up. That was not good enough for him. He emphatically told me that he did not care what rules we had to break to get the sample tested, today.

So we hooked up a 5 ferrocore auxiliary VX (V:6.4 δ:who knows?) to the EPR manifold without doing a T88 alpha pass, cranked the anti-mass spectrometer 105% to make up for the virtual resolution we lost with the core difference. Our team then began the frequency analysis of our anomalous test sample-- crystalline in appearance, exponential oscillation quotient of .677, stochastic molecular complexity assays pointing towards xenobiological construction. We fired up the emitters, charged the overhead capacitors, and finally, pushed the sample in... and it went [boom.](http://i.imgur.com/aAHnQ.jpg)

* As per the thread ""Partial delineation is perfectly alright."" Partial?

1301029418.0	gb1zd	Please read--last warning before the banhammer comes out.	oneisnotprime	44	11	20	"Hey guys, sorry to play Old Man Grumpy but this subreddit is growing like a fully immersed L negative inversion rod and we need to make sure that as a top Google result, we put a good face on VX and make the newcomers welcome.  We are now the **fifth largest VX Community on the web** (awesome!) and have at least three national finalists posting regularly (and P_J of course), so it's time for us to remember what Tobey Maguire said about great power. As such, we (the mods) feel that the following 3 rules are the very least we can do to ensure a healthy and productive discussion. Apologies to the vast majority of you who do not need to hear any of this, but we need to lay the groundrules publicly to hold everyone accountable.

1 - Newbie bashing will not be tolerated. Have you forgotten the overwhelming awe the first time you successfully polarized a cadmium bearing rod, or the eureka moment when you accidentally liquefied your entire cooling stack? VX is about discovery, not who has the most tightly calibrated resonator (which isn't you anyway unless you are GlowingFaceMan). If you hear someone talks about using magnetic pinning or synthetic dividers in their module, take the time to explain envel dumping, don't just call names.

2 - We cannot attain legitimacy without showing some respect to the founders of our community, and that includes the Daramov Foundation. Going forward, we will no longer allow posting of the Daramov Numbers on this board. Pay for them if you can, torrent them if you can't, or go to the Daramov subreddit, but keep it off VX Junkies.

3 - The pseudoscience is starting to drown out the actual delta maximizing, so going forward the rule is as follows--if you can't source it from VXUSA, VXRadius, or especially *Hans-Rodenheim Positions Fully Diagrammed*, don't post it. **Yes, duaris_blecho, this includes ferrous oxide models  and tertiary theory.** "	t5_2s9al	True
1294253933.0	ewqxm	ATTENTION: I am 95% certain that oneisnotprime's incredible run to 0.88D (Hosmer's scaling) was falsified. We've been had, folks...	redorkulated	33	4	5	"You may have seen [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ewbee/my_vx_module_has_at_least_a_43_delta_guys_i_think/) in which oneisnotprime takes us all on a very convincing and exciting ride as he allegedly achieves 0.88D(H) using a controversial J+ style indent modifier.

I know it was a lot of fun to read about and I'm sure oneisnotprime is a great 'Vaxer, but I'm afraid the outcomes he describes are simply not possible for a variety of reasons.

Oneis stated early on that he had encountered Z-axis flatline at around 0.50D(H) - an entirely reasonable problem to encounter. What he neglects to mention is that without inverting his peristatic vanes, reduced eriasmatic flux would start to seriously pile up around 0.65D(H) or so (see Fagan, 1994, in *VXConcepts*). 

That all makes sense on its own - I think we can all assume that oneisnotprime simply balanced off his aphasial nodes and worked backwards from there, simply redistributing the Farine quantities among available nodes until he achieved essentially the same balancing effect. However, he mentions later on that he used his novel indenting scheme to *calibrate his main core perimeter*. It's a subtle point, but anyone who's worked around a redistributed Farine matrix will immediately tell you that an unstable perimeter is the only thing that lets your module handle the kinds of Crane's interference you see with the load rebalancers.

Oneisnotprime, I hate to call you out in public, but after that whole controversy with the NASA report about arsenic based life the last thing our community needs is an embarrassing disappointment in the public eye. If there was something I missed, please let me know, but until I can see a complete copy of your Rangeley Quantities, backlogged from at least 0.1D(H) forward with subintervals, I won't be convinced."	t5_2s9al	True

I’ve been all over the wiki and can’t find anyone with similar problems. [As you can clearly see](http://i.imgur.com/1wix1.jpg) the primary and secondary output indicators have returned a value well beyond Yalgeth's Limit when they should only be post-extrapolating a sinusoidal theta value in the neighborhood of the Connery’s distortion baseline. As best as I can figure there is a problem in the frequency-domain six or seven half wave-forms ana or kata of the luminal border. But I’ve been through the entire superquantum postexilic cruciform reiterative architecture and can’t find any hemicyon deliminations.  

I am tempted to just reallocate the discrete output integer generating function and reduce the display graphic by a yottaflop. But that seems like it would just mask the problem and open me up to superfankel heating problems.

And before you ask, I have already reintegrated the valien module parser, I may be new at this but I’m not an idiot. Also, I know my set up is shit but I'm still new to VX moduels and using a lot of secondhand hardware."	t5_2s9al	True

1367564563.0	1dlv2g	Free VX5 (see caveat), some parts available too!	BrimstoneNFire	34	5	18	"Hey friends;

I'm pretty sure I just ferromodulated my VX5. I was running a standard exo-T9 cycle (bluebook), and the Doltran link went white hot. I was able to shut down the cradling nodes but I'm sure I sent the old girl to VX heaven.

So now my question is, does anyone want to take some parts off my hands? I'm getting rid of my older equipment, because our new lab has twin VX7's with Rodenheim tripolar phase convertors, (which- I'll have you know, we can run at 10e9 Yalgeths, without insulation). My point is, I have no interest in the old parts, and I'm happy to release them to a science team in need.

Here is a partial parts list. First come, first serve:

-Posin invertor (3-wire, pre-1975)

-MarkII induction base unit (missing pump, and shims)

-3500k Tau field generator

-Beryllium quad-lens (100mm)

-Quark shield manifold (50-60% life remaining, should hold up to at least two more rounds)

-One ferromodulated VX5. CAVEAT: Unit is currently bedded in a tritium pool, anchored in a 1000 foot deep bunker. Free to take, removal is up to you. Must have top-secret clearance for removal. Our team can remove it for a fee (2-3 million USD, estimate)"	t5_2s9al	True
