I'm not going to lecture you about how you ride your bikes, but please get some lights so I can at least see you when you're blowing through a stop sign.

1348019274.0	1043lp	from a few visiting UMass alumni this past weekend...	bittym87	71	6	13	"Just wanted to say, despite the (rather predictable) outcome of the game, my friend and I who roadtripped from Springfield, MA to Ann Arbor to see the Big House were thoroughly blown away by the experience. We got chirped by maybe three or four drunk kids the entire weekend, which is quite impressive considering we decided to walk straight through the student crowd all the way from Ashley's to the stadium at 3 PM. (If anyone saw the pair of guys with a maroon UMass jersey and a Victor Cruz Giants jersey...yeah, that was us.) All of the bars were very accommodating, and all of the alumni we talked to were gracious in the victory and more than happy to tell us all the good places to go in town.

Mind you, the two of us are huge college hockey fans and we don't get nearly the same treatment roadtripping to places like Vermont, UNH, Maine, etc. I'm sure if we were wearing Ohio State swag (eww), the reception might not be so nice. As it is, though, you guys are awesome. Go Blue."	t5_2rjkn	True

(College subreddit comp.)	fuzzep	49	6	3	"As some of you may know reddit is hosting a grow a [college subreddit competiton](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/from-aberystwyth-to-york-update-on-grow.html) and i think it would be really cool if could get fellow wolverines to unite under the UM subreddit to win this. University of Michigan is a big school with a huge alumni base and a large student body, so we already have an advantage. Here are some things we can do to help this awesome subreddit grow and help us win:

• Post OC! (It could be any thing about UM, or even something about Ann Arbor but dont hesitate, please post!)

• Invite your friends, classmates, roomates to join our subreddit

• Spread the word about our subreddit ( Although UofM has over 40,000 students, only about 260 are subscribed. Lets Change that!)


And GO BLUE!

1333638474.0	rup0r	Hey UM redditors, anyone want to live with me?	auditory	39	7	34	"Hi reddit,

All of my attempts at finding a roommate so far have failed because people either a) found the place I liked too expensive or b) are already tied up in a lease.  I don't want to live with a complete random (craig's list scares me) so maybe a redditor would be a better option

I already found a place I liked and I'm signing the lease for it this week.  Some info about the place:  The rent is 1500/month (if split even 750/person), it's a 2 bedroom bi-level.  One room is bigger than the other so we can negotiate how to split up the rent.  

It's on S. Fifth near Packard in a beautiful house.  This is kind of in the central/south neighborhood.  I love the location because it's close enough to my fav bars (Arbor Brewing, Ashley's), restaurants, and stadiums (I have football and basketball tickets).   


Some info about me:  I'm a female, second year Master's student.  I love music, cooking, video games and sports.  I'm okay with a male or female roommate, as long as you are tidy and polite.

More about me:  I'm a great cook, I'm fun and spunky.  I have tons of games if that's your thing and I also come with two guitars, hopefully a new keyboard by fall and maybe a drum kit too.  I come technology equipped and am party friendly.


Feel free to PM me for more info

TheDarwinator	27	3	5	"With 100 responses so far, 60% of respondents would be happy with just a house party. 35% of you said you would be happy with just meeting for dinner. And right in between those two sets were 46% of respondents who thought dinner followed by a house party was a great idea.  In addition, almost half of you said that age restrictions would be an issue so while bars might be fun, it would exclude a large portion of the redditors.

To that end, I think the results favor doing dinner and a house party.  For now we will assume that we can find a venue for this house party. If I can convince my housemates to do it *maybe* I'll host it at my apartment, but if any one else feels like hosting that would be wonderful.  we can always do a money collection to help with costs.

I think doing it shortly after graduation would be the best time.  I apologize to everyone who is leaving the area but we can give it another go in the fall!  Below is another survey.  Please indicate whether you plan on attending just the dinner, just the house party, or both.  Also note whether you would like it to fall on a Friday or Saturday in May.

Survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RLT323B

EDIT: Also, please comment below on what restaurants/bars you want to meet at for dinner.  I will compile another survey of the suggestions shortly.  Remember most bars like Charley's and Blue Lep are 18+ friendly before 9pm so age shouldn't be an issue."	t5_2rjkn	True

So tomorrow, on the 4th of July, a ton of protests will be happening across the country to keep the issues regarding the NSA in the spotlight and to show that this won't just be forgotten like every other questionable/problematic thing our government does (we can only hope). 

As of now, the Restore the Fourth site has Ann Arbor listed as one of the locations with 2 users noted as either running it or at least having some say in it. Unfortunately, they have yet to put a time or date on the page, and I'm still waiting on a message I sent to one of them asking about it. I don't live in Ann Arbor, but was planning on trying to make it out there tomorrow anyway.

Being from one of the most politically active schools in the nation, it's important that everyone who can participate, even in the smallest way, does. This could just mean showing up wherever it is happening (if we don't know by tomorrow, I guess it'll just have to spread by word of mouth during the day, or we could take the reigns and figure it out here). But even if you can't come out, wave signs, or do anything like that, spread the word that it's happening. The bigger media outlets are expected to give this minimum coverage while still using Snowden as a distraction to divert attention from the fact that..... ya know, we get searched and seizured'd'd constantly and illegally. 

This thread could be used to discuss or for anything else pertaining to it, if that helps.

So Sunday, September 30th at 8 p.m. I'm hosting the shit out of this thing.  Bring your own alcohol if you so choose.  I have bought some of the cheapest vodka that exists for this thing, so if you want to drink you'll have to drink it straight or bring something to mix it with.

I live at 1145 Nielsen Court in the Medical Center Court apartments.  You don't need the apartment number, as I'll have a sign posted on both entrances to let you know where to go.  If you're respectful to my place/things, then I may decide to host more of these.

Bring friends if you want, if it gets big enough we may have to take it in the courtyard area, so I suggest wearing clothes warm enough for that.

Of course if you only want to attend one event that is perfectly fine!

**Gameplan:** We will meet at **The Blue Leprechaun for dinner at 6.  Reservations will be made under the name Reddit, and if anything changes I will post to the subreddit.**  After a lively meal, everyone can retire back home to get ready for our Summer Kick-Off/Reddit Meet-up house party, tentatively at my apartment on Packard.  ~~The theme, if you chose to abide by it, will be ""Animal Print Pants Outta Control.""~~  No theme any more, just party!! **If you only want to attend the house party and not the dinner (where I will divulge the super secret party location), PM me and I can give you the address.** I don't really want to put it here on a public forum.

Please R.S.V.P. on the survey below, as soon as possible, so I know how many people to expect at each event and plan accordingly.  You can check either one or both of the choices.  Blue Lep will probably cost between $10-15 with tip, plus drinks if you want them.  Finally, I humbly request a minor donation to the booze cost at the party, whatever you can spare, I don't want you not coming because of money! (If you're not drinking then don't even worry about it.)

**R.S.V.P HERE** http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WRYLPQR

**EDIT 1:** I made the reservation at Blue Lep. Please, please, PLEASE r.s.v.p. as accurately as possible so we don't overwhelm the wonderful wait-staff there.

This would be a small business endeavor (I only have a year left of school), so I want to keep a small menu.

I'm not hung up on this idea though.

SgtSchembechler	29	12	37	"My roommate and I were walking home from our internships today and we struck a conversation as we passed by Elbel Field. We purposefully leased a house on South Campus this year because we were a house of eight active guys who enjoy playing pick-up sports and wanted to be close to field space. The University ended up fencing off the whole park and closed everything down until the summer because they didn't want to pay people to staff the field. Now I can't play soccer or anything when I get off work because they lease the space to look youth organizations. Does this piss anyone else off? Maybe this is being fueled by my preexisting hatred for Rec Sports (another issue entirely) but I feel that a part of my tuition should be reimbursed for them taking back some of the resources to which I was expecting access.

The lovely tenants of 1319 Cambridge, also known as the chem frat, are looking to fill 4 rooms in our house. Most of us are redditors so it's safe to assume we are also good people. The rents range from 430-570 for rooms, there are 3 singles and one double open. Some cool things about the house are:
- A parking lot for all residents who have a car
- TV room with stadium seating and a very large plasma TV that includes showtime, starz, HBO, and whatever else your heart desires
- A kitchen that will be renovated over summer to include a new dishwasher.
- Four fridges to hold all your bacon, as well as cabinet space to hold dry goods.
- Restaurant size oven/stove top
- Washing and drying machines that are not coin operated
- Wireless throughout the house
- One bitchin' brand new third floor patio, complete with outside mounted speakers, nice furniture, and soon to be tiki torches.
- A fantastically original great room ceiling (seriously, there's only one other in the world like it)
- 3 showers and 4 toilets
- Flexible lease planning (1 semester is possible)
There's plenty more cool things to learn about the house, it was built in 1915 so it's almost 100 years old. If you have any other specific questions please ask them. I want you to want to live here. If you're really interested and would like to come by and check out the rooms, send me a PM.

RazorICE	19	5	60	"So I've been accepted for a Fall '13 exchange semester in Aerospace Engineering. UM was by far my number 1 preference the entire time so I'm extremely excited! 

I have a couple of questions I hope some of you wouldn't mind answering? I know you guys get some of these same questions fairly regularly (I've read through a lot of them) but it probably doesn't hurt to get more opinions, especially more up to date ones.

* I've heard both that living on Central is more fun than North, but also that North isn't as bad as people say. However, just exactly how much class time should I expect to have at Central? (I guess this question is more specific for Engineering students, particularly Aero Eng)  On the flip side, how fun exactly is it living on Central if you're an Engineering student?

* **Is there stuff to do around North campus** (restaurants, shops, etc.) or is all the fun stuff at Central?

* **What's the difference between all the Northwoods?** Which one's the best? What about the other accommodation options?

* **Are US on-campus accommodations all shared?** ""2 Occupants share 1 bedroom apartment"" doesn't sound all that appealing to me. Isn't that a bit... invasion of privacy and tight fitting? Different culture I guess, but I would love to know more about how exactly this works. I quite like getting home late at night and not having to worry about waking anyone up, and, you know, having the ability to strip naked without worrying about disturbing a roomie.

* Still talking about accommodation - would you guys recommend getting **somewhere off-campus instead?** I'd love to experience the local life and get the whole A2 experience down, but don't know which of on-campus or off-campus would give me a better experience.

* As a 4th year student in a 5 year degree, **what am I - a junior or a senior?** (I'm just a ""4th year"" here.)

* **Meal plans** - how useful are these? Self catering is pretty common here and I'm used to it, so not getting a meal plan is not an issue, but are these helpful for socialising for example, or not so much?

* **How exactly do fraternities work?** I still can't understand this whole ""rush"" process. Are they even open to exchange students, or students only around for a single semester? I feel like joining a fraternity is an essential part of the full American college experience (as something that practically doesn't exist elsewhere), so I would love to have a go.

* I want to have an awesome American college experience and meet tons of people. As an Eng student, what are some of the easiest ways of accomplishing this? One of the main reasons I picked UM was for its awesome reputation for social life, so I'd love to take advantage of it as best as I can in the one short semester I get to spend there.

* **What's Detroit really like?** I must say, it has a less than stellar reputation where I'm from.

Thanks for any answers, and Go Blue! ;)

Gotta get into the sporting spirit, right?

**Edit:** *Damn*, thanks for all the responses everyone! I'm sure these will be useful to others like me :)

Roboticide	17	4	16	"The webcomic XKCD has a special [April Fool's strip](http://xkcd.com/1193/) that is still currently changing based on outside sources.  One of those sources is a competition between colleges to get the closest hash.

[We're currently ranked sixth,](http://almamater.xkcd.com/best.csv) and only the top 3 are featured in this ever changing comic.

So all you have to do is [go here.](http://almamater.xkcd.com/)

Enter ""umich.edu"".

And then enter literally any string of text and hit ""Go Hash.""  It'll then tell you how you did.  Lower is better.

Now honestly, to get 288 and break into the top 3, we need about 230 trillion attempts, so the odds aren't very good.  Or we need incredible, stupid good luck.  But we made it to sixth, and obviously Carnegie Melon had some amazing luck, so if your bored, give it a shot.  I just think it'd be neat to see UofM mentioned on the comic.

Oh, and it ends at midnight tonight, EST.

EDIT: Well, we're now 11th.  I think Google, the NSA, and MIT are all cheating.  Bastards.

What are frat parties like? My instinct is to avoid frats like the plague, but are there some filled with genuinely nice people?

I'm a senior who's deciding between University of Michigan and Oakland University for college. As of right now, my intended major is chemistry which is certainly subject to change. My biggest conflict is that at Oakland, my tuition will be completely paid for in addition to having some extra cash for housing or something of the sort. The other aspect of that however is that I live only 10 minutes away from Oakland University and I feel that I may not get the full college experience, even if I do choose to live on campus. I've visited both campuses and both are very different yet intriguing. Also, with chemistry as a major, grad school seems like a possibility so it may be beneficial to head into grad school with absolutely zero debt. On the other hand, my first year at U of M will cost around $6000 due to the financial aid they're giving me. This however is very likely to change on account of the bad year my dad's business had. My future years at U of M could end up being extremely expensive.

Aside from academics, which obviously points to the University of Michigan over Boston University, what other things are available at the University of Michigan and to the University of Michigan Alumni?

edit: Sorry guys, I decided to go with Boston University. The money that I would save going to Boston was just too much for me to ignore.

I want to live within a 2 or 3-mile radius of campus if possible, and on a bus route so I can either bike or bus depending on the weather. I would prefer to NOT live near the greek housing if there is an area for that, because I go to bed a lot earlier now than I did in undergrad. My undergraduate university had a large neighborhood where many of the undergraduates lived, and it was pretty trashed out/disgusting, with really ugly, overpriced highrises... so, hoping to stay away from that sort of thing (if it exists in AA). I would prefer a house (or duplex, or fourplex) over a big apartment. Quaint &gt; Cookie-cutter. Is that sort of housing available?  The icing on the cake would be to have the necessities within close walking or biking distance: a coffee shop good for studying and a grocery store. How far in advance do I need to look for housing? In undergrad, places started pre-leasing in February for August... ridiculous. Is that a thing in AA?

Second question - grad students, how did you find roommates when you moved? Visit day? Craigslist? Reddit?

Third question - what is there to do outdoors? It looks like there's a national forest about three hours away. Do y'all do snow stuff? I'm assuming there's snow? Clearly I'm clueless? Am I even going to have time to do fun stuff ever?

Next up: What kind of coat do you all have? I was born and raised in Texas, been here all my life. I spent a winter in Canada, but it was DRY, so it didn't seem very cold, and I wasn't relying on my bike for transportation. I have my ski jacket... and a wool peacoat, but it seems like I need a good everyday down coat? Speaking of Canada, Toronto is pretty close, eh? Do people go there? Is that a thing?

1325052532.0	ntach	Thinking of UM for grad school...	tarsir	10	1	13	"Wee bit of background on me: Let's just get this out of the way, I'm currently an OSU undergrad (there's a good reason why, part of it's that I live here, but my first choice of college was UM until I looked at tuition).  I'm currently studying computer science but have been programming off and on for about eight years.  I've always been really interested in AI, particularly as it applies to games, and would almost certainly try to specialize in AI if I do ultimately decide on grad school.    I haven't completed any games, but right now I'm working on one that I have decided I'm finishing before I start my senior year or I cut out a hobby, so hopefully I finish by then, heh.  I'm also going for a dual-degree in Japanese, with a minor somewhere in there in neuroscience, if this means anything.

So I'm in my junior year right now, just took the GRE and got like a 322/340 on the combined and still waiting on my writing scores.  My GPA started off...unimpressive, but I've got it right on the brink of being above a 3.0 again.  I'm also working in a biomedical informatics lab as a research assistant right now.

With all that said, my questions!
1) How hard would it be to get into U of M's CS grad program assuming I resurrect my GPA to something like a 3.2, keep the job and got, say, a 5 on the GRE writing?

2) How's Ann Arbor life?  (I realize this is a really open question, but answer it however you'd like to, a variety of answers would be rad)

3) How expensive is housing on/around campus?  

4) I won't get eaten alive for having gone to OSU for undergrad, will I?  :(

2-4 kind of assume I get in, but whatevs.  Might as well ask now, methinks.  Anyway, I'd greatly appreciate any input on this subject you guys and gals might have (especially in reference to my questions, but aaaany information is always good), even if it means my applying would likely just be as good as tossing away the application fees.  And of course, if there's any more information I should provide, please let me know.  Thanks everyone!

I am a high school senior from Papillion, Nebraska, and the University of Michigan is my #1 choice for my future education. I am torn between whether I'd like to pursue choral music education or musical theatre. But I know that the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance at umich are phenomenal and have everything I'm looking for. I'm going on a visit later in October, and am hopefully sending in my musical theatre prescreen in the next two weeks!

I have been involved in band, choir, and drama throughout high school. Some of my roles include Wilbur in Charlottes Web, The Phantom in POTO, and Danny Zuko in Grease. I absolutely love MT and can't wait to be involved in it in the future! I take classical voice lessons, and am in a musical theatre dance class. I also recently got myself a really great acting coach!

I have successfully auditioned and made the All-State Band, Jazz Band, and Chorus all three years. (Band and jazz band on Trombone). I have loved experiencing several opportunities at various honor bands around the Omaha metro and the midwest.

I am the drum major of my marching band at school and have thoroughly enjoyed fulfilling my responsibilities of a leader! I have so many awesome friends, but I am the only one in my friend circle that wants to continue in the fine arts.

So.....

Is there anything you guys could help me with for my audition/interview? I have a lot of good songs to perform for my classical voice audition, and I have some good monologues/16 bar cuts for MT. I won't be auditioning for the Trombone Studio, but if I do find myself at Umich I will be doing band related activities! I am super excited to come check Ann Arbor out, and am really looking forward to applying!

The other big question is money,,,, but that is a later discussion. Is there a good pool for scholarships for talent based auditions?

Lastly, a few questions about time commitment:  I will be quite busy this year, but I am willing to make time for this rush process which I'm sure will be quite demanding (I rushed an IFC sorority at one point and participated in a community service rush semester, so I have some experience in general.)  I will of course attend informational meetings, but can anyone give me some personal sentiments on the rush process/time commitment?

TL;DR: Can someone give me the scoop on the business fraternites aka their reputations, rush time commitments, and any other general information?  

Thank you!"	t5_2rjkn	True

I was just wondering if you guys knew anybody who switched to IOE from a major that they hated (which caused them to have a low GPA) or someone who just has a lower GPA overall.

I was just wondering how possible is it to land an internship with a lower IOE gpa (like.. 2.7~3.3).

Just a background info... I'm ending my sophomore year as an Electrical Engineer. The whole semester, I hated doing circuits and had no interest in it. I thought I understood the concept though. Studied my ass off for the exam, completely bombed the 215 exam. 100% know that I'm not going to pass the exam, and possibly even the course. As for 270, I'm not sure how I did, but I still bombed the second midterm.

I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of interest, or because I don't study enough (even though I studied my ass off).

But if anybody could help me out, I'd appreciate it!

**TLDR; How successful are IOE majors with low GPAs?**

EDIT: Small clarification. When I entered college, I planned on doing IOE, since I always heard it was more business based. I'm not trying to switch to IOE just cus it's easier, but because it seems to be more business-like. Currently, I wish I was a business major, not an engineering major, but it's too late for that. However, I tried out Electrical Engineering, because I heard patent law programs prefer EE's over any other type of engineers. I now realize that doing EE just for a law program isn't worth it.

1. How the hell do you all afford it? Out of state tuition is around 52,000 a year, so is Michigan really generous with scholarships or something? 

2. What's the social scene like? Is it mostly greek, or is it a lot of house parties and stuff? Are people usually pretty open?

3. Is there a lot of school spirit? Do people get excited for football/basketball games? 

4. How challenging is it, academically? I've taken some pretty boring/easy classes in high school, and I'm hoping to avoid those in college. I'm LSA, undecided major. 

5. What's the living situation? Do most people live on or off campus? 

6. Are the classes huge? I come from a small high school (200 kids) and I've had classes with as few as 3 people. I'm not expecting anything like that in college, but will every class be a 500 person lecture?

7. What's the intramural scene like? I played a lot of sports in high school, but wasn't good enough to play D1. Is there a strong intramural/club sports scene? Particularly soccer and lacrosse.

8. I haven't visited, but from what I read online the campus seems huge. How do you get around? Do people bring cars, or is it more walking? Do a lot of students have bikes? Are there buses? 

9. How easy is it to double major or add a minor or something? I'm not sure I want to tie myself down to just one major. 

10. How easy/hard is it to switch colleges? I applied to LSA, but what if I find out I really want to go into Athletic training, or education, or pharmacy?

11. Last question. Do you, personally, like going to Michigan? If you had to pick again, is this where you would want to go to college?

I've been primarily going to Ashley's, Aut, Necto and Bab's when I do go out. Very rarely do I stop somewhere else. It's almost exclusively Ashley's when I do head out, too.

.

I'm thinking I should try out a few new places. The South U area is one I have generally avoided. The few times I have been to any of the bars down that way, I've had horrible quality of service &amp; product, especially for the prices they charge. I'm not too thrilled by the standing-room-only crowding those places seem to develop, either.

.

So, other than Ashley's / Babs, what are your favorite bars around downtown? Are there any on South U that aren't horrible?

Likely pertinent information:

* I primarily go out to have a good brew and spend time with friends.
* My friends are increasingly aching to meet people while out; I'm apathetic on this.
* I'm 25, just finished my MA. My friends are either still in school or stopped with an associates."	t5_2rjkn	True

I was there last night (I was having an allergic reaction to a medication and couldn't breathe well). I don't have insurance but decided I had to go, which my doctor definitely said was the right call before pumping me full of steroids and benadryl. Anyway. I got wildly different answers about how much I would have to pay for these things. The nurse assuredly told me that the visit along will be $600, and the IV + meds would be ""more"" on top of that. But that she really had no idea how much. The social worker I talked to said, ""oh, you're a student so you can set up a payment plan no problem. I wouldn't stress about it. I'd guess it'd be about $500 total, but I really have no idea."" And when I asked the check-out person that would have charged me a bill if I had insurance, she also had no concept of what the cost would.

So, obviously this will fluctuate wildly based on treatment --  but have you been? Did your friend go? How much did you end up paying?

Also, this insane article about ER costs varying widely from TIME a few weeks ago:
http://theglobalrealm.com/2013/02/28/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/
(it's not the TIME link, as the time link is behind a paywall) 


**tl;dr:** What did you pay for your UMich ER visit? I was there last night and no nurses, social workers, or administrators asked had any concept of what it would cost.

1346602293.0	z8fmc	How were your experiences with financial aid? Or transferring?	EvilFrostop	6	1	22	"I am a prospective student hoping to apply by November 1st. It's been my dream for a while now to attend Michigan, but now I am doubting more and more that I will be able to without ruining my life with crippling debt. My family's income (about $90,000/year after taxes) rules me out of pretty much all federal aid and from the university website's calculator a vast majority of my university aid will come in the form of loans (about $9,000 worth!) which still leaves me with an outstanding $13,000 in expected family contribution. Ok, all fine and dandy, but my family has told me they're not going to help. I'll have enough to meet that efc from my own savings by the end of this year, but there's no way I'll be able to come up with $10,000 a year during college, and even if I was, I'd still graduate with 36k debt. Worst case scenario I'd end up with around $60,000 debt.

So, I'm asking you, how were your aid packages? Has anyone been in a situation like mine? Has your job out of university been able to adequately repay these loans? What can I do?

Another possibility that I've been looking at is attending Oakland University for my freshman year (my GPA and high schools credentials will earn me full tuition there) to cut a substantial sum from my graduation debt. Has anyone here transferred into U of M? How did it work out? Was it worth it?

I'm looking for any help that I can get. Did anyone here get any large merit-based scholarships? What are my prospects? If it helps, I'll graduate a year early as valedictorian with 4.something GPA having taken four AP classes. Will that boost my aid package?

Sorry for all the questions. I'm just freaking out over this stuff. Neither of my parents went to college so they don't really know about any of this stuff. I know I can message the office of financial aid, but I don't know how to word that message without sounding obsessive, and I doubt they could help me very much."	t5_2rjkn	True

I'm definitely applying to this school, and I'm pretty sure I can get in. As of now, I have a 2150 on the SAT, 31 on ACT, lots of extracurriculars, challenging course load, etc. 
The only problem is money. My parents don't see the point in sending me to what they refer to as a ""lower tier"" school out of state , when a school in my state is pretty much the same thing for half the tuition. 
I see their logic, but I'm seriously dying to go this school. I love the environment, the city, everything. I seriously dislike the university that I would attend in my own state, as I have been there several times as well. I don't expect a full ride scholarship, but even if I got about 20K off, my parents MIGHT be convinced. The only way, as of now, that they would agree to send me out of state is if it was an Ivy League or something up there, like Stanford etc.
How should I go about this situation? I know it's a pretty generic question with no real answer. But does Michigan generally offer scholarships/financial aid to OOS students? I am a pretty good student from a very competitive school, but I haven't exactly done anything EXTRAORDINARY that's deserving of a scholarship.
Are there any ways that I could maybe work on campus as freshman/help out to waive the OOS tuition? I know it's a bit early, but the application process starts in a few months, and I'm planning on getting started in a couple of weeks. I just feel like Michigan is my destiny. I've always felt this way. Throughout my life, I've always told myself I'll get to Michigan somehow, but now that the time is approaching, I am faced with how to actually solve these challenges.

I am actually in Flint, Michigan right now with my friend, so i was wondering if I should go talk to the financial aid dept myself. My parents are pretty unsupportive of this, but I can go down there to talk to them. Would this show initiative/interest? I'll pretty much tell them about my passion. And how the only obstacle is literally the OOS fee.

This means that in January when we sign up for housing current freshmen will have first pick, followed by current sophomores, juniors, and seniors. This order for housing sign up has not been implemented in at least the last ten years. RHA and Housing revisited this process because the University has been admitting more students than expected in recent years and this has caused a housing crisis. This is being implemented to prepare for the worst, that being that there is not enough housing for everyone that signs up.

In the interest of potentially saving some lives, there will be a bone marrow drive on December 1st from 11am-4pm at Mason Hall (in front of the posting wall). The objective of the drive is to get interested people into the bone marrow registry, so that they can be contacted if their marrow is a good match with a patient.

The objective of the drive is to:

1) Disseminate information (e.g the methods of donating bone marrow, http://www.bloodservices.org/donating/donating_bone_marrow.htm)

2) Collect saliva samples of interested people and enter that information into the bone marrow registry. 

The drive is backed by DKMS (http://www.dkmsamericas.org/), but is organized by ~10 UofM students/alumni.

I humbly ask that you inform people about this drive so that we can reach out to people that may be interested in being included in the bone marrow registry. 

The procedure is sometimes a last resort for many patients (e.g. when radiation therapy or chemotherapy fails), so it is indeed worth the time and effort to donate marrow. I hope that you will keep this in mind and help get as many people informed about this drive as possible.

Thank you,

Drive participant.
