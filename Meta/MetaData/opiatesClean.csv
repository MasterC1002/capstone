1337471850.0	tvcan	Buying H in NYC for the First Time, a Retrospective [long as fuck]	thatsweetembrace	830	108	210	"I was ordering the dried pods of the poppy flower and dosing myself with the narcotic opiate tea made from these pods a couple of times every month -- in the last years of high school -- then college -- then the years following school when I was directionless and sad, bouncing from one city to another in search of something I could not name.  My Paypal history with my preferred pod vendor is the most accurate record of everywhere I've lived -- old apartments and zip codes -- cities and towns I've passed through quickly and forgotten.  I've tried almost every opiate under the sun, and   have never been physically addicted or gotten into trouble because of them.

Anyhow, if you are into pods, you know what happened to them.  My last order of pods, a couple of months ago, ran me $140 and got me high twice.  Fuck that.  I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.  

So, I decided to finally bite the bullet and take a trip to NYC to buy heroin.  I bought a bus ticket online, and made arrangements to stay with a friend for a few days.  The ride is a couple of hours from where I live.  I wrote down the address of a needle exchange, thinking that maybe if I hung around there I could strike up a conversation with someone who could help me find heroin.  However, I had  reservations about trying to obtain heroin at a needle exchange, as I find it distasteful and kind of rude.  On the bus ride over, it was overcast, drizzly.  On the bus, I reflected on the “how to score dope” posts that I've read that offer advice of varying quality on how to buy drugs on the street as safely as possible while I looked out at the signs of gas stations and McDonald's and Wendy's passing by outside.

I know heroin exists where I live, but my timidity when it comes to asking the “right people”, my clean-cut appearance, and my general lack of street skills have rendered finding it locally, so far, impossible.  On the bus ride over, I grew determined to find heroin while I'm in the city.

When I got off the bus, it was still early afternoon.  My friend was working until later, so I decided to walk around Manhattan and see if any opportunities would present themselves.  The first person I came upon was begging for change at a street-light.  When the light went red, she'd walk up the line of cars, soliciting change with a plastic McDonald's cup in hand.  She'd walk the line of cars front to back, stopping to pick at her teeth for a minute in the mirror of a parked white van while she waited for the light to turn red again so she could repeat her walk.  She was white, in her late-twenties or early thirties, and had the recognizable unwashed appearance of a homeless person or stereotypical street addict.  She had sores on her face that I found unappealing.  I dropped a crumpled dollar in her cup and asked her, nervously, if she knew “where the dope spot was at.”

She said that she didn't do that stuff anymore, that she's in a methadone program now.  She seemed suspicious. Methadone is a subject I'm interested in, and we got to talking.  We discussed the length of the methadone detox, the rules of the program, the process of tapering off.  I asked her about the quality of the local powder heroin as compared to West Coast Tar.  I put another dollar in her cup and reminded her that I'm just looking for twenty dollars of “dope,” and am not trying to pull any funny business or anything, and I'll give her an extra twenty dollars for her trouble.  I feel a pang of guilt, thinking that if she really is on the methadone program and trying to stay clean, twenty dollars in cash might be a huge temptation for her.  She looked and me seriously now and said: “You'll really give me twenty?  People out here usually hardly give me anything.”  I could tell that, even with her suspicions, when she heard that I'd give her twenty bucks, it was too much to resist.

I pulled my pocket open so she could see I had two twenties in tow.  Her posture changed.  She bent forward, a rocket ready to fire into space.  “Alright.  Let's go.”  I was tagging along beside her, trying to keep up.  We jay-walked.  We jay-walked again.  A car honked.  A hot-dog vendor yelled.  My heart was pounding at the prospect that I might have actually started the chain of events that would lead to having heroin in my pocket.  She checked every machine we passed by with a change-slot:  pay-phones, electric parking meters.  In the payphone, she picked up the receiver, and began to dial.  She paused.  “You know what? I have two bags on me.  Just give me the twenty for the two I have, is that cool?  Will you still give me the extra twenty?”  And, of course, I said yes.

She passed me a clear plastic bag.  It was about the size of a baseball card.  Inside were two folded up wax-paper bags stamped in bold purple: “Purple Label.”  Even heroin, it seems, has a brand name.  The bags were about the size of postage stamps.  I quickly stuffed it in my pocket, my greedy left hand feeling for the bags inside.  She cracked a warped smile and yelled “Enjoy!” like a T.V. grandmother might say after setting down a plate of piping hot oatmeal cookies. She said “I'm always around here, if you want to come by tomorrow.”  I walk away, quickly, a shit-eating grin plastered on my face, giddy, light-headed, happy.

I snorted nine bags of heroin in the city.  All of them in bathrooms.  Bathrooms in bars, restaurants, and cafés.  I presented a clean-cut appearance and almost always patronized the business whose bathrooms I used to avoid suspicion.  I carried a cup emblazoned with the place's logo, just to further justify my use of their restroom.

The next time we meet, Tracie asked me if I booted. I said yes, and she offered me a “clean spike.”  I remembered what “boot” means, and told her, actually, no, I don't boot, I snort it.  I tell her that I know it's kind of a waste, but I don't like fucking with needles, even though I know I'm missing out on the “rush” that come with injecting heroin.  A tall black guy walks past us with ear-buds in.  She discreetly pointed at him and whispered “he raped me”.  “He knew I had two warrants out and so I couldn't call the cops.”  “That's fucked up” was all I could think to say.  “My program, if they see me doing any deals or anything, I'm totally fucked.”  She threw the two tiny wax paper bags, into a baseball cap that has suddenly materialized in her hands.  

In the bathroom, I would unzip my backpack and take out a literary journal I purchased before leaving, not realizing that I would be too high to read any of it.  On it, I put a straw cut to about three inches, a folded wax paper bag filled with heroin, and a credit card.  I would empty the tan powder from the wax paper bag, and then rip the bag, getting every little bit of heroin that might have accidentally gotten stuck to the bag.  I would rip the bag a couple of times, crumple it into a ball, and toss it out.  I would take the straw and scrape off any heroin that might have inadvertently gotten stuck on the credit card during while I made the line, putting it back into the line.  I would snort the line.  I would snort the back of the literary journal, just to make sure I got everything.  I would lick my finger and rub it on the back of the journal.  If I saw more than a little bit of powder, I would feel sad for wasting good heroin. I would taste my finger.  It always tasted great.

Before I came to New York, I had scoured the internet in search of Fun Parties and Events and anything that might be interesting.  A Food-Lovers Group was organizing a “guacamole tour” – there were shows and concerts.  I never did anything on the list, my afternoons and evenings all surrendered to a series of heavenly nods.  

The third and final time I saw Tracie, her girl wasn't picking up her phone.  We walked around to kill time, calling often and getting antsy.  We went to a Starbucks, and she ordered one of those giant chocolate and caramel coffee type deals (a milkshake masquerading as a coffee).  She took off the plastic top and stirred it around with her green straw, blending the caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and frozen coffee stuff together into a sloppy mess.  As she did this, I saw how dirty her nails were and felt like cleaning out the gunk under them for her. I think how if people saw her they might be afraid to touch her because she looks homeless and has sores on her face.

On the street, we ran into one of her friends, a handsome boyish looking middle-eastern kid about my age.  He had a Sbarro bag with him, and an open collared shirt exposing abs.  His eyes looked nervous.  He talked about the warrants out for him. He walked like a maniac: long, unpredictable steps.  He said that he could cop for me, but I will have to buy him a bag.  I said OK.  When he’s gone,  I explain to Tracie how I trust her, but now that there are other people involved, I am worried about losing my money.  She said that she trusts this guy like a brother, and that I should not worry.  He loops around a corner.  We follow him, but not too close.   He comes back.  He gave me five unstamped bags, tucked between his thumb and index finger.  He walks away immediately.  I put them in my pocket.  We dart off.  “You owe me two” Tracie said.  I tell her I know.  I counted the five bags and put two in Tracie's outstretched hands.  

We were both pretty happy at this point.  She could tell that I was relieved that it went fine.  She suggested that I come with her to use the men's restroom at the hospital, while she uses the women's.  I declined.  She asked “Am I going to see you again? I figured you got three this time, you know, two for today, one for tomorrow.”   I said probably not, as my bus is scheduled to leave tomorrow.   She gave me a hug, and a little nervous peck on the cheek like a prude school-girl might.  She said “enjoy” and “take care of myself” and I walked away.

EDIT: I plan on doing it for me. This is just a way if seeing that I have support for my choice. And it is really opening my eyes. I don't live near any friends or family so there is no one stopping me from continuing on with my habit. But I have made the decision to quit. this is just kind of a kick starter.
Thank you for all the support guys. This is my favorite sub-reddit for a reason. (besides the drugs)

Also I am 10 Hours and going strong without any so far. I hope to make it through but right now I'm taking it a day, or more like an hour, at a time.

EDIT: 15 Hours without using so far. Thanks for the inspiration. 

EDIT: I am almost 24 hours clean. I am preparing for the WDs to hit. this week is going to be tough but I am going to do all I can to make it."	t5_2r0y3	True

1359628152.0	17mfw7	Fuck My Friends (A Suboxone Hate Story)	fat_loser_junkie	195	38	94	"What is it with friends, always wanting to be involved in your life, with their fucking *caring* and shit? Okay, maybe that was harsh, so let me rephrase... What is it with your friends in recovery, with their caring and shit? With their sideways glances, the deep looks into your eyes to see how pinned they are today, the glaces at the tops of hands, insides of elbows, and their silent judgement. I'm happy you're clean, but I've seen you spill your shot and try drawing out of my dirty carpet, so stop looking at me like that.

But still, friends are friends, and even with my atrophied sense of morality, that demands some degree of allegiance. So when they call, begging, cajoling, demanding I go to the bar, what am I to say? No? Well... Yeah, actually. At least until one of them offers to pick up my tab.

So that was how I found myself out on Thursday night, college night, closer to a decade after my graduation than not, sipping shitty beer in a shitty bar, listlessly hitting on freshmen with fake IDs made by the same guy I buy my coke from. Jesus, I don't even drink anymore. I don't even *fuck* anymore, I'm so limp-dicked from shooting up almost anything that promises to make me feel half human again. But still, I'm here, pretending to enjoy hearing the lies about my friends' desk jobs, clean-time, and - really, you boring motherfuckers - new power tools.

At least they aren't staging an intervention, right? No one would do that in a bar. That's what I told myself when I went to the bathroom to shoot the Opana I had stored in my shoe.

When I get back there's another round, so that's okay. Shots. Neat. Maybe I'll get drunk and actually have fun. Let the chubby redhead take me back to her dorm if I can convince her I'm really a grad student at her school. 

Whatever. 

Drink.

When my glass hits the table, I can feel their eyes on me. Expectant... ""Well, what?"" I ask. ""Do your shots."" (That's the junkie talk slipping out, ""do,"" not ""take."" I've been in too long.)

""Brother... We need to talk. You need to get off the dope,"" one says. He actually calls me brother. The sanctimonious fuck.

""Don't say anything. We did this because we love you. We dosed that shot with two sub strips.""

The room goes cold. Time slows. I can't feel the sick coming, not yet, but I know it will. I flash to every time I'm kicked, every sick junkie I've ever seen. The movies Trainspotting and Requiem. My stomach knots, and in the time I open my mouth to ask him if he's serious, my body tells me he is.

I sit in silence. I let them watch me. Their eyes are full of concern. Compassion. Two have been where I was going. One had a lover die from too much Xanax and Oxy. Part of me wants to not hate them. I wish I was clean, so I could laugh at their shitty jokes and enjoy this shitty bar.

But most of me feels the sick that is starting to march on the Paris of my high like a million rabid Nazis. The part of me that sat through grad school and a thousand hours getting certified to treat fuck-ups like me says this isn't how you stage an intervention. The biggest part of me, the part I hate, the part I love, the part that I identify as *ME,* the junkie...

He says quietly, ""Take me home now, or I swear I'll kill one of you before the other two can stop me.""

""We have Clonidine, K-Pins, and Xanax at home. Scotch too. Precipitated withdrawal is bad, but you're gonna wind up dead one day... Come with us and kick. Please...""

I say nothing. I can taste bile in my throat. Vomit from the sick or from anger, I don't know. Same with the shaking I can feel in my hands. But my gaze is level. Even. My eyes don't blink. Maybe they can see them dilate from pin-points as the adrenaline is hitting my system, or maybe they know they've fucked up. Two of these guys I've fought with before, for fun. Fraternity Fight Nights, a way of releasing tension. Another saw me throw another man off a two-story balcony after he hit my once-upon-a-time, one that got-away, girlfriend.

I don't break my gaze as I pick up an empty beer bottle and walk it across my fingers. Even with the shakes, I'm better with my hands than a magician. Shooting up in winter-cold Chicago alleys will leave you with some non-drug related skills. They watch as it goes from the drinking a beer-with-buddies to the someone-is-about-to-pick-glass-out-of-a-serious-wound-hand-grip.

I can see their thoughts. Would he do it? To one of us? Oh god, to *me?* I'm wondering the same thing... The same thing, plus calculating the time back to my house, the time to prep a shot, the strength to get through 16 mg - *Jesus-fucking-Christ that's a lot of sub* - the way my friend's blood would look on my hands, these hands, these hands that I swore would never commit violence again, these hands that have seen blood before, these hands that used to hold two beautiful women that I both lost to this habit, these hands that once wrote beautiful poetry, music, made art, and love, and beauty...

""I'll take you home... I... I'm sorry.""

Still, the whole time home I'm wondering if they weren't right, even if their methods were wrong. But the biggest part of me is wondering if I could feel well off enough morphine.

The answer is yes, I can.

1356015092.0	15639b	Different Opiates - How They Feel	fat_loser_junkie	133	18	125	"In the past few weeks, I've noticed a number of posts asking how such and such pill compares to this and that opiate. Well, since I've swallowed, snorted, shot, and shoved up my ass damn near every opiate you can get, I thought maybe I'd try to make a kind of comprehensive list of the subjective effects of different opiates. *(Plus I'm high, bored, and I can't sleep for shit.)* Since everyone's experience is different, please take this little guide with a grain of salt. Still, even though I'm calling myself connoisseur of opiates, I hope everyone else will chime in and add their opinions too.

Anyway... I hope someone can get some use or entertainment from this list. If not, well at least writing it kept me entertained for a bit.

Codeine - This is a step up from Tramadol but that's really not saying too much. Its available over the counter in a lot of countries, and that fact should tell you all you need to know about this. Its best used to stave off withdrawal when nothing else is available. There are two exceptions to that statement. The first is if you have either no tolerance or an absolutely microscopic habit, and the second is if you have some Sprite, a double-stacked styrofoam cup, and a Jolly Rancher. (Heh... Jolly Rancher story.) If you have the second, use those ingredients with some codeine/promethazine cough syrup to make yourself some ""Lean,"" or ""Purple Drank."" The promethazine potentates the slight action of the codeine and counteracts the shitty side effects of some pretty severe itchiness and nausea. Final verdict... Use it to stay well or get some cough syrup to get your lean on, but be prepared to be underwhelmed. 
**Codeine is VERY slightly euphoric, but is also very sedating, stomach churning while being itchy as a two dollar whore's week old panties.**

Hydrocodone - Now we're starting to talk about real opiates. Unless specially compounded (or in cough syrup form, but after codeine I'm done talking about syrup) hydrocodone always comes with the dreaded acetaminophen. So unless you hate your life you're going to need to do a cold water extraction. Once you do that you've got a pretty good starter opiate which will introduce you to the power of the poppy. Hydrocodone produces decent euphoria without too much sedation. Itchiness and nausea will increase with the dose. The main difference between hydrocodone and other opiates in that hydrocodone gives a euphoric burst of energy that is similar to a low-grade coke buzz. You'll be talkative and in the mood to get shit done. This and oxycodone used to be my ""clean the apartment, cook dinner, and bang the girlfriend"" pills. 
**If you use a CWE your liver will thank you. I think of hydrocodone as the poor man's oxycodone. One of the biggest pluses, however, is the fact that its a Schedule III where all other worthwhile opiates are Schedule II. Because of that its much easier to either find these on the streets, in your friend's and family's medicine cabinets (dentists especially seem to love writing for these), or to get them scripted to you for some bullshit reason like a stubbed toe or broken penis.**

Oxycodone - Speaking of oxycodone... Here is where we start to get pills without extra shit like promethazine and acetaminophen. (Except for Percocet, Endocet, and Donkeyballsocet.) The effects of oxycodone are almost exactly like hydrocodone except that oxy is stronger and, in my experience, tends to produce much more energy. If hydro has the buzz from mediocre coke, oxy has the buzz from high quality yayo. Its also a bit more itchy, and from what everyone has told me, is also a lot more nauseating. Of special note is that Roxicodone can be smoked for a unique high, similar (but much, much weaker) to smoked fentanyl. Furthermore, moving up in strength, this is the first opiate that can be IV-ed, although with a ridiculously high oral bio-availability and the lack of a rush from shooting there is really no reason to put oxycodone in a rig. 
**Now we're starting to talk about the good stuff. Its called ""hillbilly heroin"" for a reason boys and girls - mainly because when snorted it feels like a non-sedating heroin. Very euphoric and energetic by just eating the pills. Unique in that it can also be smoked - like fentanyl - but personally knowing how good it is snorted and swallowed, I never saw the point.**

Morphine - Here we go, the gold standard of opiates. First off, unless its going in a vein, its being wasted since every other route of administration's bioavailability is absolute shit. (Okay, yeah, except for plugging it, but I always lump plugging and shooting together since they produce similar results.) In a perfect situation you can only get 60 mg in 1 ml of water, so it takes some practice to learn how to perfect the extraction of the goodies from the pills. When shot, morphine produces a huge histamine release (the pins and needles) which some people enjoy while others hate. A big dose will also leave you flushed and possibly with the worst headache you've ever had. Its very sedating, so you can forget all about that feeling of energy I was talking about that comes with hydro- and oxycodone. This is a chill out, one eye open, maybe nodding out kind of opiate. It might not be a whole different world from what I talked about above, but its at least a different continent. 
**Sweet Mother Morphine... Sedating, defines euphoric, has great legs, but has to be IV-ed. Even then you're maxed out with 60 mg per 1 ml of water, so preparing pills for IV is an art. Also, some people HATE the unique rush. But some people are fucking idiots, so there you go...**

Hydromorphone - Like hydrocodone and oxycodone above, hydromorphone and oxymorphone are very similar. That being said, don't mix up -MORPHONE and -CODONE, because that's like mixing up dynamite and a nuclear bomb. With hydromorphone (Dilaudid, or dillies) its IV or nothing. Really. I swear. If you're not IV-ing your hydromorphone I beg of you to sell it to a junkie who will. Its too good to waste and anything other than IV is a complete waste. Hydromorphone has arguably the best rush - it combines the best parts of the morphine rush and the oxycodone high, compressed into about a roller coaster ride of around a minute. The biggest downside is that hydromorphone has no legs. Aside from smoking oxycodone or fentanyl, shooting hydromorphone is the crack of opiates. You will look up from the rush and ask, ""Awesome! Can we go again?"" And no, you can't, because one, its expensive and two, your receptors are bound. 
**IV is required and 100% worth it, but there are no legs whatsoever. No legs, so this bastard rolls around in one of those hoover-round electric wheelchairs. Since the duration is so short there's no real negative side effects. Well, except for immediately wanting more...**

Oxymorphone - Opana is my favorite opiate and honestly blends all the best aspects of oxycodone, morphone, and hydromorphone. While I only IV it, I know that some people have had good results with insulfation. Its incredibly euphoric, second only to really good heroin, it produces a rush that is right up there with hydromorphone, and has the energetic buzz of a large dose of oxycodone. Furthermore, a lot like my experience with morphine, it seems like I can flip it mentally and go from energized to nodding out by relaxing and closing my eyes. If there is a downside, its the fact that the legs are a bit short and because of the euphoria you find yourself wanting more right after you've shot. Regardless, oxymorphone, I love you. 
**Bad mouth oxymorphone and I'll stab you in the throat and then fuck the wound. It has the best parts of oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone, but will leave you wanting more almost immediately. Aside from that, watch out for a bit of extra nausea.**

Fentanyl - What can I say about fentanyl... Well, first off, the bad. Its know to produce a lot of nausea. Its so insanely powerful that its measured in micrograms. Lastly, there's no real good, easy way to abuse it. Yes, the patches can be cut up and gummed, worn on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet with a heating pad on it, or (as I've been told once or twice before) use alcohol to prep them for IVl. The best way, however, is to smoke the gel squeezed out of the patches. (I'm not sure which brand has the gel... Does anyone know? I'm too lazy to Google it...) Still, for me, the only reason I would use the patches is to stay well while I'm on the hunt for an opiate I'd enjoy. On the plus side, however, fentanyl is quite euphoric, but its also very sedating. 
**Its difficult to abuse, very euphoric but very sedating. When smoked, there are no legs whatsoever. However, if used as directed - or even carefully gummed or worn to maximize absorption - it can be fantastic for staying well until something better comes around.**

Methadone - Methadone is a perfect example of a double edged sword. It can be the best thing for maintenance, but if you ever want to come off the drug you had better prepare yourself for a month of hell. First, the good... It can be very euphoric, it can last a long time, and it really doesn't take much to get where you want to be. The bad aspects, however, are the kind of things which keep me away from methadone. As I already said, it has a long half-life, which means it will last a good while, but that means withdrawal lasts a good while too, plus it takes hours for your dose to take effect. Knowing myself, I'd be likely to re-dose early and end up falling out. Finally, the oral bio-availability is much like oxycodone, so there is no need to IV. Plus, even if you did IV, there is no rush and it still took hours before I felt any effect. 
**Euphoric, but sedating. Long half-life means a long withdrawal and a long time before you feel your dose. Lastly, there's no point in IV, which will do nothing to solve my needle fetish.**

Okay, I'll go back later today and edit this to clean it up because right now I'm fucking exhausted. I hope someone out there enjoys the post and maybe has a few questions answered. Like I said, if nothing else it gave me something to do.

I swing by because I mostly like to check out the 'porn' y'all post, but I also get a kick out of some of your stories of pick ups gone wrong, busts, big scores...hell, just the tales of a junkie, really. 

And that brings me to the point that got me to write this post - I get the feeling there's lots of 'drugstore cowboy' types around here that fancy themselves somehow different than junkies. I can't tell you how many posts I read where these trash-stash sporting, semi-literate, 20-somethings go on slobbering about ""blues"", and at the same time seem to shit their BVDs at the thought of some smack. Little do they know, they're doing the same god damned thing...just paying more for it and getting a watered down high. Shit, am I the only one around here who thinks a wildly overpriced pellet of oxycodone is a little underwhelming? 

My first taste of the dope was over 40 years ago, in the form of a morphine syrette. It was love at first sight, and I've been with the lady ever since. I haven't been using the entire time, thank god, but the addiction has always been there. In that time, I've done some of the world's finest junk, spiked some of the worst bunk, and sampled about every pharmaceutical in between. 

And do you know what I've discovered? Aside from the predictability of the pharms, not a damn thing is different. Yeah, I have my preferences... some buzzes are better than others - but no matter what your opiate of choice, you will always become the same wet, shit-covered, quivering, pile of filth without it. 

So as an appeal to the Roxy 'fan boys' on here...please shut the fuck up. If you need your blues to wake up in the morning, then you're a junky. Plain and simple. And don't let your preferences get in the way of this community's goals of fun, support, and harm-reduction.

Hell, I just saw a guy post on here about not catching a good buzz from oxycontin, but digging on vicodin, and he got downvoted to the pits of hell... for a simple preference! The poor sucker just wanted to know if somebody else had a similar experience. Isn't that what this site is supposed to be all about?

Ladies and Gentleman, 

The only thing constant in this existence is change. It's been well over a decade since my earthly passion for the opiate began and well over a year now that it has since departed. In my first moments in recovery, Christmas of 2011, while my joints still ached and my legs still shook, I clung to this subreddit. I shared my story and reveled in the life that I once lived. My war stories were posted with pride and admired by those who could relate. I've met people from here in the real world, though never used with them. As clean as I was, there was something that was keeping me tied to the lifestyle. I didn't want to let it go. I wanted to see people shooting in the tinychat, I wanted to remember my own counter littered with high grade pharma and bags of street dope. I wanted to stay close to you all, because I was afraid I would change. 


Last night I had a dream:

*****
I was running from the cops with a special bag of dope. This bag was assembled by taking a piece of portion of every bag I'd ever bought, collected through the years and had been lost. Until suddenly, while walking by some cops, this bag of chunky, sandy, and colorful heroin appeared in my pants pocket. It was heavy and full. The cops somehow noticed, as if they just turned into Agent Smith from The Matrix, I ran... 


I found myself hiding in a bathroom stall. I was looking in awe of this collection of dope, how it could exist and how high it would get me. I could hear cops running around, somewhere outside the bathroom, but I was going to use it anyway. When I started trying to get it out of the bag an earthquake began! It was shaking so violently there was no way to prep. 


There I was, a collected lifetime of assorted dope, in my hands, and it was spilling out on the floor. All of my years of savings were being lost in an abyss. 


The heartbreak of this was enough to wake me from my slumber. I was so sad. Sad like I was losing family members with each sandy rock that was shaken out of my grasp. Sad that I didn't get to use the substance that I'd ritualistically collected over a decade of use. 

*****

Now awake, I wipe the sweat off my brow, and got up to go to work. I didn't get up to go score dope, I didn't get up and check my phone to see if ""B"" was finally back on, or if ""Q"" was out of jail. But I was forced to think about that little insight from my sub-conscience, and took it as a sign. 


*The collected experience of a decade of drug use, in a bag that I'd been holding on to, even with 17 months clean, made itself known to me. AND I was going to use it. I even tried everything I could to do so, but I was unable to, by the grace of a natural disaster.* 


Because of my fear of change, my fear of becoming someone that you all might not appreciate or recognize, I am holding on to the past. My addiction uses nostalgia as exercise and fantasy as food, to give strength to my almighty ego that, without intervention, would dive right back into the collective parts, pieces and lifestyle that brought me to my place of misery.  


You people, you beautiful human beings who live in that place, the place of my misery, know this! *It is not through collective bias and a community of chemicals that you will find your salvation.* It is through love and acceptance of who you are, without opiates, that will free you from your prescribed slavery! 


This community is part of a cycle of opiate addiction. An essential part of the cycle in which justification of the use of opiates cannot be done on one's own. This is not a problem of just the opiate addict, but of the human ego and the psyche. A conscience or perhaps un-conscience ability to confirm our faulty actions through commonality! However, my good people, if you've found yourself here for that reason, don't despair. This cycle can be deadly, but there is hope for us all. 


Surely you are summing up the rational equations to prove to yourself that these words do not apply to you. That your situation is unique. Most likely you are insulted that someone would have the unmitigated gall to write so generally in reference to a community of nearly 5,000 people. That is fine. I accept that this message likely will not be well received, because years ago I would have been first in line to discredit it. So how could I judge you, when I was you. How could I resent you, without resenting myself? How could I turn my back on you, when I know what redemption I hold now in my heart. The same love that I have now for myself, I have for you. You can do with it as you will, but I give it to you freely. 


I am no longer afraid of dropping my bag of collected dope experience. I am no longer afraid of leaving you and this subreddit. Because no matter where I go, I take you with me. I know your pain, for pleasure, your passion and pursuits of it. I cannot be holier than thou, because I am thou. 


For now, I must heed my call, to life and it's blessings, and to help others who have found it in them to want help. While understanding those who do not. I'll be around today and tomorrow, but anyone who wishes can find me through PM, or /r/opiatesrecovery


Love and respect to you all, you have been a huge part of my life, and hopefully always be part of my recovery.

1335016662.0	sl8x8	PSA: Overdosing	jmkogut	86	14	37	"Recently r/opiates has been absolutely flooded with posts detailing what posters are calling overdoses and discussing the ways they have treated these situations. More often than not, these claims include ""I was dead for X minutes!"" Where X is an obscenely inaccurate representation of how long you can stay under without dieing or acquiring severe brain damage. There is a difference between life threatening respiratory depression and simply taking too high of a dose and passing out. There are signs and symptoms of an overdose that are readily identifiable to the trained eye and contrary to popular belief, overdose cannot be treated merely by covering someone with ice and hitting them very hard in the face or genitals or even throwing them in the shower. There is a standard of care that should be followed and without proper medical training, equipment, and the facilities necessary to treat patients, that standard of care will not be met. **We strive above all else for harm reduction.** The following is a quick guide on *proper procedure*, I don't want to see more silly OD posts after this.

-----------------------

**What is an opioid overdose (acute opioid toxicity)**

Opioid overdose is relatively easy to define, and in fact identify once one knows the hallmark features. But, to simply define it, an overdose is any dose of an opioid that results in profound respiratory depression/arrest. Overdose results in other symptoms that may not be as easy to identify, but among them are bradycardia (low heart rate), severe hypotension, and cyanosis (when the victims lips/skin turns blue, they are cyanotic and need of urgent medical care). These are not the only symptoms. Others include unresponsiveness to light, heat, sounds, touch, etc. This does not mean ""spend 30 minutes putting the person in a shower, shoving ice in their pussy"" (420chan users, represent). This means shout their name, maybe slap their face a little bit just to see if they are aroused [ed: giggity] by it and say ""hey man stop slapping me alright?"" or something similar, that means it's not an overdose. Another hallmark is labored breathing, This may sound like snoring, and if this is the case, there are a few things that need to happen to ensure the person survives. Putting them in a shower, hitting them, shoving ice anywhere in their body, none of that will help and certainly no emergency room physician will instruct you to do that. Don't be stupid, this is a human life. 

**What should I do if I find someone who I believe has overdosed?**

This depends greatly on whether or not you're alone. Let's assume you are for a moment. FIRST, call 911, the police WILL almost always show up. If you have more than one person there, then hide the drugs. Generally, they're more concerned with saving that persons life than they are with fucking over drug users. If your friend dies while you were around and didn't call 911, you could easily be charged with voluntary manslaughter. I know someone this happened to. 

The second thing to do, in order to save their life, is to listen to the 911 dispatcher, generally they will advise you to perform CPR. Being that an opioid overdose causes respiratory issues, hands only CPR is not going to be sufficient. Rescue breathing will be needed. It is best(regardless of if you're a junkie or not) to be familiar with CPR/the rescue position/other basic first responder techniques. If you're friends with the person, they likely won't sue you.

If you are not alone, you should cycle doing CPR (it is exhausting, I've performed it on folks who have overdosed at or around the needle exchange I have volunteered for) until EMT's or police arrive and relieve you of that duty. The best way to go about the call is generally to say ""hello, 911? Yes, my friend is not breathing. His lips are blue and he is unresponsive. I do/do not know cpr, I need an ambulance, what can I do in the meantime?"" Do not mention that your friend just did heroin or whatever. Once the paramedics arrive (they have narcan, and narcan, unlike ice, actually does reverse overdose) tell them that your friend ""occasionally does opiates, like heroin, oxycontin, morphine,"" or whatever the case may be. They will see the symptoms, and with that knowledge, hopefully make the diagnosis that the person has overdosed. Regardless, if they do not, they have the tools and the means to keep the person alive until they reach an emergency room where the doctor WILL make that conclusion. You should not be fearful of this following you around for your life, but it will. I've personally overdosed twice and required ambulance rides to the hospital and a full week or two week stay. I'll get into the reasons why later. However, I will say, even after these overdoses I do not struggle with getting prescriptions for narcotics (I have ms contin, percocet, norco, opana, etc). They will generally send an addictionologist around to evaluate you or a psychiatrist, if you don't want to get marked as an addict, answer their questions in a way that doesn't make you look like an addict. [ed: easier said than done]

**What if my friend wakes up before paramedics arrive, does he still need medical attention? Why?**

YES. Why? Well, when once overdoses, it is a very serious trauma for the body to go through, many people who overdose aspirate(vomit and then that vomit infiltrates the lungs), I did both times I OD'd, if you aspirate during an overdose, it is likely you will get aspiration pneumonia, which is very serious in and of itself. There are other very serious and dangerous possibilities that you simply cannot diagnose unless you have access to a full lab for blood work, a radiology center for chest x-rays, etc. Other life threatening complications include further a further lapse into unconsciousness and unresponsiveness, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (just to name a few). This is why they like to keep people who have overdosed for a minimum of one night for observation. 

**But I/my friend was dead for 30 minutes! They woke up because we put ice on them and were fine! **

First of all, your friend wasn't dead, they didn't ""flatline"", and they didn't go into cardiac arrest. had they flatlined they would have needed even more than narcan to bring them back. During my first overdose I went into asystole, the treatment thereafter was much more complicated and the fact that I survived is very, very, very much so down to the fact that I made it to the hospital alive and without hesitation. (nobody waited around to call 911)

**How can I avoid overdose?**

In harm reduction, we have a saying, test shots save lives. I'm sure you've seen me or other users post that before, but it is some divine truth. Test shots DO save lives. Mixing substances, such as benzos, alcohol, muscle relaxants, cocaine, amphetamines, etc, also greatly increase the risk for an overdose, so if you do mix any of those with your dose of dope, cut the dose of either the opiate, the secondary drug, or both, at least until you're confident about increasing the doses.

*This thread is not intended to help those who attempt to overdose to kill themselves. In that situation, you need more than medical help and although I do understand your plight and have been there myself, you should contact a mental health provider or check into a psychiatric hospital. It is my experience that unless you want to detox, they will keep you out of withdrawal be it with methadone or suboxone or if you're a chronic pain patient (even if you abuse your drugs, don't mention that, just say you're a CP patient) and they'll give you your drugs as prescribed. *

If you are suicidal, please, please, please check out /r/suicidewatch.

And for everyone else, can we quit using overdoses as a junkie dick-waving badge of honor? Overdoses only occur when we fuck up and are nothing to be proud of.

My hips ache, the pain is pounding.  Every heart beat I have reminds me I am alive, but also reminds me I am fucking hurting.  I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering how the hell I am going to get through this day.  I gotta piss, but the bathroom seems so far away when every step feels like ten.  Alarm has gone off three times.  Snooze is my friend, my only friend at 6am.  My wife rolls over, she is one of those people who is angry when they wake up unexpectedly.  She is starting to stir.  Don’t want to wake her up because I am hurting too much to get out of bed. 

 I suck it up and roll out from under the covers.  “Fuck, my hips hurt.  Back hurts worse.”  Gotta decide what to do first, piss or pills?  The pisser is close, the pills are across the house.  Pisser it is.  As I walk past the mirror, I see my eyes are bloodshot all to hell, can’t even open them all the way because they are so dry.  “God, my piss stinks”.  It’s so yellow it’s orange.  I need to drink more water.  These pills are dehydrating the fuck out of me.  

Walk to my office across the house, my man cave if you will.  Very little work actually gets done in there.  “Where did I put those pills?”  I switch locations in the office to keep my wife from finding them all the time.  She knows I take them, she knows I am prescribed them, but if she kept up with them she would realize how many I take and how many I have to buy on the street to keep withdrawals at bay.  “There they are.”  

I put them behind our wedding photo, we were both smiling, happy.  Once upon a time we lived the fairy tale.  Life finally took that from us, or maybe the pills did it.  In my mind, life gave me the pain, pain gave me the pills.  You think painkillers only cost money?  That’s funny.  These dones, oxys, blues, pandas…they cost more than money.  Nobody tells you they take your motivation, your sex drive and pretty much anything else you hold dear as down payment.  “Fuck it.”  No time for introspection.  Gotta get ready for work, get the kiddos ready for school and kiss my wife goodbye.  No time to feel sorry for myself.  No time for help, hell, no time to even cry for help.

Take my last three dones.  I look at that empty bottle and dread starts to creep in to the pit of my stomach.  The empty bottle looks back at me and laughs.  “How the fuck am I out already?!?”  Damnit.  Had a bad day?  Take an extra done.  Going out with my buddies?  Take an extra.  Going to my In-laws for dinner?  Better know I am taking three extra that night.  “Fuck me.”  The rollercoaster begins.  The dones are settling in.  I am starting to feel better, the pain is melting away and I can smile again.  Just in time too, the family is waking up.  Gotta put on my happiest face for my kids.  I don’t want them to know how addicted their dad is.  Morning routine is done, jump in the car, ready to start my day.  My first stop is to CVS.  I have to get some Lope, cause the pain killers I took, 30mg of the pharmacy's finest is going to be gone before lunch.  I always wonder, does the cashier know about my habit when I walk up with a 200ct Lope and a box of Tagamet?  Who knows...and fuck ‘em if they judge me.

Hop in the car with my junkie survival kit courtesy of my local pharmacy and head out to work.  Make a few calls, send a few texts out to my connects.  A rag tag group of the most unreliable, jerk ass people I know.  It’s funny really.  Two years ago, I wouldn’t have said two words to some of these people.  Now I am on the phone, trying to charm them, begging them and treating them better than I treat my own flesh and blood.  After I call, I think of all the things I have to do this week that I can’t imagine doing without some opiate therapy.  Kid’s soccer game, date night with the wife, big project at work…the list goes on.  The place I am in and my need for pills leads this godless man to do the one thing he never does……..pray.

1364309116.0	1b1k9h	A new IRC room has been set up and is waiting for you!  Please upvote for visibility.	njstein	75	14	19	"Hello everyone.  As some of you may know, I am a recent addition to the moderating team of /r/opiates.  As a frequent user of IRC and with much disappointment of the regular IRC room, I decided to fix up a room that is to be used.  The previous room had a founder that is nowhere to be found, thus no ops in the room, no traffic, and such.

The new official channel is #r.opiates on the server irc.freenode.net ; All rules of /r/opiates will also be present on the IRC.  If you think ""why don't we just use the tinychat?"" We can use both.  Sometimes it's annoying to cam up when people are just open mic spamming their music at a quality worse than tape mixes off the radio recorded in a place with bad reception.  There is a link to the tinychat in the channel topic of #r.opiates.  The room is currently mostly empty, however feel free to lurk and to also push this IRC room to become more popular.  It's always nice to have a place where you can bullshit about random shit with people who share the same hobbies as you.  Also depending on popularity, I may have to set up a few ops and half-ops, but we'll see how the traffic goes.  Can't wait to see you guys in IRC.

**tl;dr**  New IRC room, #r.opiates on irc.freenode.net

[Webchat link to IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#r.opiates)

Same rules apply (no sourcing, don't be a dick, etc.

Any questions ask away. :)

It feels like hours. It hurts to sit but it hurts more to stand. It’s not just my legs, its my entire body, aching, I feel a heat wave come over me, I unzip my jacket and try not to draw too much attention. After a minute I feel flush; the lady sitting across from me is awkwardly looking through a magazine. As my face goes from red to white, she probably thinks I’m half dead. I feel half dead but the air sends chills up my chest and down my arms, reminding me that I am still alive. I calm my thoughts by thinking of the sweet reward I’ll be getting. I just need to wait it out. 

*It wont be like this next month, I’ll make sure to ration out what I need to get me though. This is so uncomfortable I never want it to happen again. I can do this.*

I hear the familiar clink of the safe, any minute now I’ll be able to leave this place and relax. Minutes pass like hours. “Newyt” I stand and make my way towards the counter. I pause for a second as the pain shoots through my body. I feel like I’m going to throw up. The lady looks up from her magazine and gives me a concerned look. I rub my stomach trying to somehow give off the illusion that I’m sick. Fuck her if she doesn’t buy it.

As I open my door and sit in my car I’m fumbling to open up the bottle of pills. *One, ah fuck it how about three.* I deserve it; it has been a hard road getting here. As I swallow the pills they scrape down my throat. I should have bought a drink but I just didn’t have the energy to do it. The drinks were too far away from the counter; there is no way I would have made it. 

I wait a minute and have a thought. My straw is in my bag. *I grab it and take out another pill.* I deserve this. It slides down the straw and I stop it in the middle. Shaping it like a U I grab my lighter and crush that little fucker. The straw takes the abuse pretty well as I run the bottom of the lighter back and forth. I tilt my head up and look around. There is a lady coming out of the store, people are everywhere living their lives. I’m going to live mine now. I put the car in reverse. I painfully stretch my head to look around. The last thing I want to do is run anyone over. 

I put the straw to my nose and inhale the powder. I almost gag as it hits the back of my throat. I concentrate on driving. The minute’s pass and my arms and legs regain their warmth. My stomach settles down and I’m starting to feel at ease. The warmth grows slowly, starting from my gut, relaxing me from the inside out. I look at my phone, who can I call? 

I want to let someone know how good I feel, but there is no one. I can’t tell one person how relieved I’m feeling, how the pain is not but a dull ache in the back of my mind. How I feel like I can conquer anything in my path.  

I pull over into a gas station lot and hop out of my car. As I light up a smoke I call my wife. I tell her I love her and that I’ll be home soon. I truly do and I feel it now more than ever. The thought of how I treated her sickens my thoughts. Sharing how I truly feel with her and what I'm gong through dances across my mind, but I don’t tell her. She wouldn't understand. I hang up and take a drag of my cigarette.  My body is a glow, I can move without shooting pain, I want to tell the world I feel fucking awesome. But I can’t, I’m alone in this. As I hop in my car I grab the bottle and pop it back open.  *Two more*, I’m going to get fucked up, I’m going to be the happiest father and husband ever. I’m going to play and read stories to my kid. Joke and run around. Tonight is going to be the best night ever.

[This is what I've been waiting for.](http://i.imgur.com/j46JAiW.jpg) It changes everything in my life.

That is my story. I hope you enjoyed it."	t5_2r0y3	True
1362038797.0	19dxh2	Where I've Been (A Story of Overdosing)	fat_loser_junkie	62	7	61	"A few of you guys and gals have sent me messages asking where I've been this past week or so, and to avoid having to send a bunch of messages and also to maybe entertain and share a cautionary tale, I'm going to tell everyone about what happened. I hope you enjoy the story, and maybe take from it a little bit of inspiration to add some care and safety to your own habits. Before I start, let me just say that even though what happened seems like a suicide attempt, it was more an accident brought on by - to be completely frank and honest - insanely irresponsible and stupid abuse of drugs.

About a week or so ago, give or take, I woke up and started my usual routine. As I've said in previous posts, I have an absolutely insane habit and tolerance. I usually shoot between four to eight Opana IR 10 mg pills in one sitting or two to four MSContin 100 mg pills. Even using a 3 ml rig, I'll find myself shooting three or four shots back to back, making all of them at once then banging all of them as fast as I can. I've never overdosed, never fallen out even. (Well, at least not with pills... As a younger man, with heroin, that is a different story.)

I'm not proud of the size of my tolerance, even if I sometimes wear it as a badge of honor. When I make rounds for friends, I call them ""big boy shots,"" and take a certain degree of humor from watching their reactions to the massive histamine, pins and needles reaction a large shot of MSContin can produce. I don't give them anything near a dangerous level of opiates - I have enough red on my hands, I don't need anymore dead friends. But these ""big boy shots"" have become a bit of legend in my circle of junkies.

What went down on the day of my overdose is this. The night before I had lucked into a bottle of 10 mg Ambien. Normally I stay away from benzos and benzo-esque pills, but a friend gave them to me and talked me into shooting one. It produces a unique rush, and an odd, dissociative, almost hallucinogenic high, albeit very short-lived. The major downside is that after one shot - in me at least - it starts a crack-like fiending for another shot plus a quick decent into, well, to put it mildly, doing a lot of stupid shit with no memory of it at all.

So, that morning, before I prepped my usual Opana and MSContin shots, I decided to add a bit of Ambien in the mix. There were 26 pills in the bottle before I started, and - once again, very, *very* stupidly - I decided to put not one, not two, not three, but four of those goddamn things in a rig. The last thing I can remember is pulling the rig out of my vein and pressing a cotton ball to the site.

What happened next is a bit of a puzzle, but one constructed from notes I took while doing my business and phone calls I made over the next hour. I, almost fetishisticly, record the amount and time of every shot I take in a notebook I keep with my gear. The notes stopped after the third round of 400 mg of MSContin, but more than twenty pills were missing from my stash. That's 2000 mg plus of morphine, not to mention at least 800 mg of Opana and the remainder of the Ambien. Obviously not all made it into my body - I imagine a great deal was spilled - but a god-awful lot of opiates went into me.

At some point in the process I wrote in my notebook the following, which fucking haunts me: ""Please don't think this is an accidental overdose. I know what I'm doing. We all have to die of something.""

Eventually, I passed out. For how long, I don't know. I only know that my phone showed a number of calls to friends who didn't answer, with the exception of my ex-girlfriend. She tells me that she could tell from my voice that I had done something incredibly stupid, so she immediately drove to my house, from her apartment about ten minutes away.

According to her, once she got here, I was barely breathing, cold to the touch, and turning blue. She immediately put two strips of 8 mg Suboxone under my tongue then called 911. She also cleaned everything up before the paramedics arrived.

They loaded me up in the ambulance and rushed me to the nearest hospital. Apparently I had a seizure on the way, but that was the least of my problems.

Even after naloxone was administered in the ER, I was still cyanotic and unresponsive. The doctors believe that was due to a combination of the sheer amount of morphine in my body, plus damn near a month's worth of Ambien. I was intubated and taken to the ICU, where I stayed for three days before I woke up. According to the nice doctor, he had never seen anyone with such an irresponsibly insane amount of opiates in their system. In conversation with him, he bluntly wondered aloud at the damage I've been doing to, ""Your whole fucking body."" He said he honestly thought I would either never wake up, or at the very best, awake with massive brain damage.

Luckily, I proved him wrong...

Still though, even after I was awake and fully functioning in ICU, I was put in the psych ward, on a suicide watch. I spent three days telling the shrinks that despite what I had written (my ex had supplied my dosing journal at the request of the doctors), I wasn't suicidal, just really fucking stupid. They disagreed, and repeatedly begged me to go into their residential rehab program, but, since I'm here writing this, I obviously declined.

So, I'm back. I'm here. I'm not dead. I'd like to thank everyone who sent me messages and phone calls asking if I was okay. I don't keep many close friends in the real world, so its nice to feel a bit of love coming from some of the members of this great community. For those wondering, yes, I'm back to my old shooting regimen, albeit a bit toned down. I'm also back to staying away from benzos and their brethren.

The main reason I'm sharing this story goes back to what I wrote... ""We all have to die of something."" That's true. I've seen overdose deaths, gun-shots, a fatal stabbing. I preformed CPR on my father as his lungs finally gave out. As a teenager, I even found a friend who hanged himself... What I'm getting at is that I'm no stranger to death. I think most addicts will, at some point, realize that their lives are always walked on the razor's edge between this world and whatever comes next. That's okay, I think. I think that's just the part of the price we pay to play with these amazing, beautiful, deadly, destructive molecules.

The point I'm trying to make though, is this... While we all have to die of something, be smart and try not to let it be by this. Limit your dumb-ass choices. Don't dance so close to the fire, because if it consumes you, there is no second dance.

So, please everyone... Be careful out there.

**TL;DR - I once lost a ring fingering my high school girlfriend. That's nothing though... A buddy of mine lost a watch once. Just read the damn thing. Or not. I don't care. I'm going to bed.**

*Note - Future posts will get back to the more fun and less somber shit than this. I promise.*
 
**SUPER EDIT** Thanks everyone for your kind words and compliments. It does my ego a lot of good to hear that people enjoy my posts and stories, and even more so to hear that people don't want me to, well, you know... fuckin' die. These kind words do actually mean a lot to me, so thank you, everyone.

About the stupidity of shooting Ambien, that was one of the things the hospital staff was really kind of amazed about. In my area, if you're shooting, you're shooting meth, and one of the nurses actually told me that she considered shooting Ambien right up there in with that in terms of bad choices. I had a few conversations with nurses and doctors about what the effects and feelings of an Ambien shot were, and without a doubt, every person I talked to about it was either amazed that I did it or really curious as to how it felt. I don't advise anyone to try it, even if you're desperate to shoot *anything,* just bang some water. After one Ambien shot, your memory and decision making abilities go right out the window. *(As a side note, the best part of this experience was probably getting the number of this super cute nurse who invited me to attend NA with her. She's told me she had an alcohol and coke problem for a few years and has been in recovery for two. Nurses are, without a doubt, responsible for the best sex I've ever had, so I'm hoping she'll be kind enough to thirteenth-step me. Hey, let a nigga hope, okay? Oh, the worst part... Fucking catheters. No one should ever wake up to discover a goddamn garden hose coming out of their penis.)*

Finally, I probably owe my life to Suboxone, in that it most likely reversed enough of the opiate-induced respiratory depression to get to to the hospital where a full antagonist could be administered. It was lucky that I had taught my ex that trick and even luckier that she was collected enough to remember it. If you don't have naloxone available to you, maybe consider keeping some subs around in case you overdue the dumb-dumbs like I did.

*One last thing... If there's interest, I'll post the story about how I got revenge on my so-called friends who dosed me with Suboxone about a month ago. I think the story was enjoyed by some of you, and the tale of revenge is pretty sweet. I'm writing it now, and will hopefully post it in the next few days. Once again, thank you all for your kind words and support. This is a nice little corner of the internet, and everyone here continuously makes me happy to have found it. Stay safe, and I hope everyone makes it to where they want to be.*"	t5_2r0y3	True

Ok, so about a month ago I had my first meet up with a dude from the subreddit. He had a couple decades on me, but seemed like a really chill guy, and I was excited to finally get to meet another poppy enthusiast in my newly acquired home-town. I moved down here a couple years ago, but as an occasional user I never went cruising the ghetto to look for goodies or put myself out there in any way really in order to meet someone. So you can imagine my excitement when I get a PM from a guy who lives near me, asking to meet up and hang for awhile. It had been over a year since I had felt the sweet embrace of Lady Poppy and to say I was looking forward to it would be an understatement. Now, I have been taking suboxone for about 2 years at this point, and have been content to just maintain, abstaining from any kind of *real* buzz. I let him know that I had some, and we worked out a trade. I traded him 260 bucks worth of sub (at a very cheap rate, at least compared to what they go for back home) and in return he gave me a bundle of the local brown powder. We met up, got to know each other, and generally had a good time. He was running late, so we didn't get to hang out as long as I'd like, but he came through for me so I was happy, and went home to blast off. 

Now, it had been so long since I'd touched anything that I figured my tolerance would be pretty low. Boy, was I wrong. Even after 20+ hours   after my last suboxone, I sniffed 5 bags over the course of that night and *didn't feel a damn thing*. Not wanting to jump the gun, i told myself it must be the subs still in my system, so I went to bed and decided to do the other 5 bags the next day when I woke up. I put all 5 bags out on a plate, formed them into 1 thick line, and went to work, taking little sniffs every 10 minutes or so, taking care to coat my nostrils and not suck it all down my throat. After I got it all down, I began the wait for onset. And I waited... And waited... And nothing happened. Didn't even get pin eyes. Needless to say I was confused and upset. I sent him a text message saying ""If you'd just told me you were hurting I would've given you some subs for free man, no need to rip me off."" I figured that would be the last time I ever talked to him. I was wrong.

He called me a couple hours later expressing confusion. He said he had no idea why I didn't feel anything, that it was the same dope he'd been doing for months, and that it gets him buzzed up just fine. He made a point of saying that he never rips people off and apologized that I was unhappy with the stuff. I said whatever, chalked it up to a loss, and went back to the daily routine. I figured that would be the last time I ever talked to him. I wanted to post here and tell you guys about my experience, but I didn't know what to say. I still didn't know if I had gotten ripped off or if my tolerance was just so damn high that the dope wasn't cutting it. I didn't want to bash the guy if he genuinely *didn't* rip me off, but I didn't want to come on here and say the meet-up went great either without really knowing what happened. I told him I didn't want any more of that dope, but if he could get some pharms to let me know. He said he didn't get a hold of them very often, but that he would let me know if he did and we'd meet up again. So I just moved on. I had been stockpiling my meds for awhile, so the missing subs didn't fuck me, and at the very worst I wasted an evening. No big deal. 

Fast forward to last Monday. He sends me a text asking if I would mind parting with any more of my subs. I was very hesitant because of what happened last time, and I told him that since I don't normally sell them I would much rather do some trading. He told me his buddy was coming into town this weekend with some blues (roxi 30's) and asked if I wanted some. I said definitely, and that I would take as many as he could get in trade. He asked if he could come by and pick up a few subs until then, to get him through. Against my better judgement I said sure, and sold him 5 for the same low price as before. Now, as you can imagine, I was thinking at the time that he was just hurting and made up the bit about the blues so that I would part with some of my subs. Again, whatever, it's not hurting me and i could use some spare cash. He texts me again on Thursday asking if he can come get a couple more. He said he ended up sharing with his buddy who was in need, and that the blues were still coming but he needed to make a pick up before then if possible. I told him it was fine, to come on down. He called me a little while later and told me not to worry about it, that he was supposed to get the blues tomorrow (Friday, today) and that he would just wait until then so he could bring me some. I was surprised by this, because in the back of my mind I still had the thought that he was just making up the bit about the blues so he could buy subs from me. 

So today (Friday) comes, and I text him asking if everything's copacetic. Again, to my surprise, he says yes and that he will be headed to my house when he gets off work. I don't get my hopes up, but think about how nice it would be if he actually came through. Oh, I also asked him if he knew where any **good** bud was. He said that even though he rarely smokes, he happened to have some killer on him right now. I said awesome, and got everything done that I had to do for the day. So 4 o'clock rolls around, the time he said he would be off work, and I don't hear anything. I wait til about 4:45 to call him, expecting no answer or an excuse about how he couldn't get them but still needs the subs. I was very pleasantly surprised. 

He answers the phone and says he's en route to my house with everything he promised. I was ecstatic! He shows up, I jump in the car, and we proceed to bullshitting for awhile. He gave me a super fat eighth of some medical grade bud and 8 blues. I traded him subs for the whole amount. Even though I was giving him the subs for really cheap, I was still enormously grateful that he was willing to take the whole deal (blues *and* buds) for subs alone, as I probably wouldn't have been able to even complete the deal if he wanted cash instead. I split one of the blues with him for being such a bro, we talked about music and ""the good ol days"" for awhile, then we parted ways. 

Because of him, I am sitting here enjoying the first buzz I've had in almost 2 years. And it feels **WONDERFUL**. I still have no idea what went wrong the first time, but I have officially chalked it up to my own body chemistry/tolerance, and most certainly don't think he tried to get one over on me. I'm so glad I decided to give him another chance, because he truly is a great guy and it's great to have made a real friend from the r/opiates community. I will leave it up to him if he wants to reveal himself by commenting in the post. If he doesn't comment I'm not gonna blow his spot up by mentioning his user name in the main post. Suffice it to say that he is a really cool guy who came through for me. Even after I had all but written him off, and straight up called him a thief to his face (or phone). I really hope you read this dude, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry for doubting you. You're a solid guy, and I foresee a long and mutually beneficial friendship between the two of us. My only regret is that we didn't get to actually hang for very long. We need to get together and shoot some pool or something. 

I had to write this because I know you check the sub almost every day and I wanted you to see (publicly) that I appreciate your efforts, and apologize for what I said after the first meet up we had. I hope you're having as good of a night as I am, because my night wouldn't be half as great if it weren't for you. To everyone else who took the time to read this, thank you too! Sorry for the huge wall of text, but I needed to get this out. I wanted to share my story so that it might restore some of your faith in your fellow bropiates. Not everyone is out to get you, or in it just for themselves. There are still some truly good dudes out there, and at least one of them is a member of this sub! Well I'm off to add a little of that delicious herbal extract to my nod. I really hope this makes it high up enough so that he gets to see it, it always makes me feel good when I read about a successful meet-up between Redditors of the poppy persuasion!

Using substances recreationally and/or having addictions does NOT make you a bad person and we should all remember that despite what some people would want us to believe. Don’t let what anyone else thinks get you down on yourself.

I’ve seen your stories about families, relationships, businesses, and schools that you try your best for every day, and I know what amazing people all of you are.

I think all of my bropiates are the best of people and I love you all. Stay safe and don’t let others get you down. :) &lt;3

Well we prepped our shots, me doing 2-3x the amount of him.  He's a small guy, but not that tiny compared to me.   I had  bit of a tolerance, but he didn't.  Still, I've seen the dose he took go fine for other people his size, and they didn't even pass out.

well he said he wanted to get a big dose, but apparently it was too much.  

After injecting, he said it felt good, nice and strong to get a nod from it.

Seeing as he was alright, I did my monster shot and got to my bed where I laid back.

About 3-4 hours later I awoke from a deep deep nod (i could have died)

but I looked to my right where he had been sitting and found him laid back on the bed with no breathing.

after about 3 minutes of CPR, I used a flash light to check his pupils and they were dilated, which was my first OH FUCK moment, no reaction to light at all.

So, being the non-ass hole I am I rushed him to the ER and stuck around to give his information to the ER workers and help contact his mother.

soon after, I was told that he was gone and had probably been dead for several hours as rigimortis was beginning to set in.  Narcan wouldn't have saved him apparently.

It's been really hard on me, It's been months and I still think about it at least 5 times a day and it makes me feel depressed because I feel like a horrible person who's at fault for what happened.  

I've been in touch with his mother since and we're on good terms after I explained everything that happened.

I could have maybe had time to get him to the ER so they could administer narcan, but I was on the verge of death at the time he was unconcious too, so all I can think is why couldn't I just have died with him, but I know that sounds stupid and unnecessary to think about.

It just kills me to know his mother lost a child just a few years ago, and now this...  

how can I not feel like a scumbag?  I've been trying to tell myself not to keep blaming myself but I can't get past it.

OR

maybe i deserve the self-ridicule, but I feel that will just lead me back to doing heroin again, and that's unacceptable.  I need to stay clean for my friends mother so she knows the same thing won't happen to my parents, and If i stay clean perhaps my friends passing will keep me alive to help others with the same issues.

This is a story I haven't really told anyone and it's not short, but if you kind strangers have a minute i'll try and leave you something meaningful. Here it goes.

So this wee lads 12 years olds and pretty normal. Private school, pretty bright, moms got her issues and so does dad, family life was really rough when he was younger but recent history has been pretty calm. Kid lives in the suburbs of a west coast city and spends most of his time alone, sitting outside in the sun watching the people walk by, or reading in his room. Never had a lot of friends but that was how he liked it. One day in mid-may he's out getting coffee and meets an older girl, 14 year old, he's smitten. He buys her coffee, chat's her up (he's a smooth fucker for being only 12) and all of the sudden they're friends. She's got an older brother, 19, lad's clever as Faust and just like the kid in almost every conceivable way. They spend time together and for a little while everything is good in the world.

The older brother of the girl is hitting a rough patch now. His friends are some pretty shady folk. None of them have jobs but they all have a lot of money the kid notices. The kid and the girl are dating now, lovers. He's got some emotional mileage for a kid his age, his mother has psychosis and is addicted to more scripts than the kid even realises, and the fighting in the house is non-stop. He grew up independent and never got in much trouble so his parents don't watch him much, and the kid starts to drink and smoke and have sex with his older girlfriend and do the things normal things teenagers do. The kid's had migraines and panic attacks since he was little, and now with his body and mind changing in puberty some depression and anxiety are starting to surface as well and the kid constantly feels as if there is something he needs, some hole in his chest that needs filling, so he starts searching. First it's pot, then psychedelics. Man did those psychedelics change things, shrooms are easy to come by, and acid not much harder, even mescaline finds its way into this kids bloodstream, but despite the early feelings of peace and unity the psychedelics loose there spiritual powers after a short while, and by then that hole has grown. He starts to spend more time with the older brother, thinking maybe he can help the kid. He spends some time with the older kids and tries a couple other things, a lot of them are into uppers, but as much fun as they can be the kid doesn't like them. After a long night out hopped up on mdma he feels like he is in debt to the drug, it intensifies the pleasure of life for a few hours, but the next few days that debt is repaid with the worst kind of hangover. Starting to believe he is going to spend the rest of his life with a hole in his chest the kid starts to get cold, things at home get worst and the depression turns black, he's unhappy but getting by just barely. He starts to see less and less of the older brother. His sister tell the kid that he's working some stuff out and taking heroin. The kid thinks heroin's a bit scary but that maybe painkillers are what he needs to fill the hole. They do. He spends a lot of time taking his novocaine of the soul, filling in the hole, spending more time with the girl and less with the brother until one day he gets a call. The brother has offed himself.

The girl is utterly destroyed. Growing up their parents had beaten the everliving shit out of them and it had made them close, now they were as far apart as two people can be. The boy was crushed too, he saw himself in the older brother. The hole in his chest grew. He stepped up from Oxy's right up to H. The first time was bliss, like ascending to heaven and being cradle in the hands of a loving god. 'Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt' as the saying goes. The next year the sister, unable to recover from the loss of her brother follows him into the shadows, leaving the boy alone. He is devastated, his only friend, his lover, he's never felt this sort of pain before, and things got dark.

He fuelled his habit by shifting weight for the shady guys the brother used to hang out with. The only powder in the city it seemed came from them. He did this for a while until the psychic pain was too much to bear and the drug had destroyed him thoroughly. He didn't want to be like the brother so he decided he was going to quit using. His first attempt last mere hours. Cold turkey was a stupid idea, he was going to need to taper off obviously, and the first time he did that he did so too fast and felt all sorts of imaginary bugs and spiders and subjective spikes in his skull. He did this over and over again, one last binge then he'd quit only to find more spiders and spikes awaiting him, he tried to taper again and again with the same results until one day he had the terrible realisation that some line had undeniably been crossed. So he shook his fist at the sky and vowed to kick this shit once and for all and spent a few white-knuckled days locked in his bathroom praying to the porcelain gods, telling his parents about this awful flu going around. Then he sliped. He couldn't stay clean. He made more pledges, and installed self regulations and tried again and again to no avail. When he was high he wanted to get clean, and when he was clean he *needed* to get high.

Time went slowly then. The head-flattening guilt, and black depression, and searing pain continued with the drugs providing shorter and shorter periods of relief, until finally there was no relief at all. It was impossible to get high enough to fill the hole. He hated the drug but found himself doing it over and over until finally he wanted to stop more than anything on earth and it wasn't fun anymore and he couldn't believe he ever even liked it in the first place, and it felt like he was fucking crazy because there were like two of him fighting all the time, until one day it stopped.

Finally one day he caught himself in the mirror and saw what it was the drug had done. The mask was off and he saw once and for all what he was. Fucking death. Living death. It was nothing like being alive, he felt more undead than alive then.  The idea of dying wasn't even scary anymore, because what was truly scary was the idea of living like that for another 5 or 10 years and only *then* dying. And that lightless hole in his chest had teeth now, and it was devouring him, and he knew that he was in trouble. He'd finally hit the fucking bottom, and from that second on he could no longer do drugs, every line felt like attending his own funeral and he would rather die than continue living like that. He used to say everyone needed something worth dying for, and now that phrase was becoming too real. The only question remained was whether or not he was going to escape the drug by following his friends into the shadows, or whether he was going to get clean.

A few kids he knew had gotten clean through NA, and they told him they could help him, and as long as he truly wanted to he could get clean. And he did. It was the hardest thing he'd ever done, the thought of withdrawals still makes him sweat and leave salty fingerprints on his computer keys. The drugs filled that hole and became a part of him. He loved them so much that he eventually needed them, and when he stopped that part of him that needed the substance died, like an engine without oil or a plant without water. That hole has grown, and four sober years later it's still there, but just like a bowl that needs to be carved out of wood to hold water, his chest hollowed out by suffering now holds joy. He's still hurts, and he still misses the drug, and he still stands on the sides of bridges and on balconies, and thinks about a beautiful reunion with the girl and her brother but he waits here, and reads by himself in his room and when it's sunny out sits outside and watches the people walk by."	t5_2r0y3	True

So I just started a new job last month as a counselor at a methadone clinic.  I recently graduated with my MSW (Master of Social Work) and have wanted to get into substance abuse counseling for a long time.

I'm a 10+ year clean addict, but downers were never really my thing -- meth was more my thing.

So basically, I know drugs, I know drug culture, but I know very little to nothing about opiates.

I wanted to sub here to learn more, but I didn't want to be a silent lurker -- would like to ask questions.

Obviously I'm not here to try to counsel anybody or convince anyone to seek treatment or any shit like that (hell, probably not ethical for me to counsel on Reddit, anyhow!).  I just want to learn more.

Anywho . . . like I said, I just didn't want to lurk here without being open about why I'm here because that just felt shady to me.

Figured I'd just throw it out there and see what happens . . . if I get downvoted to shit I'll understand, no hard feelings and will move on to trolling erowid and what not.

I think it is for the better. of course it is. I can't stand being broke anymore. thursdays are great, but the rest of the week is just garbage. no gas, no food, no nothing. I just do not have self control when im using. So I might as well put a stop to this. But I just wanted to say farewell and that I had a hell of a time posting and reading everyone's posts!  Happy nodding and stay safe my friends!	t5_2r0y3	True

Some of us are rather successful people who juggle society and scoring, life and learning and even though we might mainline one, we're men about it and still take care of our shit. This one's for the addicts who are responsible. The men and women who still work their asses off, party hard and keep their life together. A daily user is a happy user and happy people are good people. This one's for the relax at the end of a long day, running into the bathroom after work to mix one up.

I checked myself into a rehab program in Oakland, and three days later A young guy came into the program. He was a highly educated, bright guy working on his MS in Physics. We immediately connected since we are very close in age (I'm 24, he 26,) and we were both avid reddit users. We lived together for the next 25 days, which were the best and clearest days I've had in the last 7 years. 

He had started using some lighter opiates a year or so prior, but had quickly moved into much harder stuff - H and needles. Unfortunately, he connected with some people on this subreddit who introduced him to that whole world. That's not to say he wouldn't have found it himself, but it's sad to think that things progressed so quickly and just a year later he's gone. He OD'ed and passed away over memorial day weekend, and I just found out yesterday when I was back at the rehab center visiting another friend who's getting off H for the third time this year.

The point of this post isn't to tell you what to do or how to do it, but I hope you will all keep this in mind. He was a good friend to me, and these kind of things happen to people every day. If you want to get clean, you can. If you don't, then please be safe. If anyone out there is looking for help finding a rehab program near them, don't hesitate to PM me and I will do all that I can to help you find some options that can help you.

Be safe out there.

RIP Neal,  /u/THROWYOUAWAYS

I got an OK from the moderators for this and hope not too many people are put off by my discussion of specific vendors on the road.

So, I had been wanting to do the big H for many years now but had never been in a position to convince people that could obtain it for me.  I have had a long history of addictive behavior with most of my adult live spent going very heavily with our friend alcohol.  Anyone who knew anybody ""knew better"" than to help me connect with people that could obtain our friend the big H.

For many years I had replaced alcohol with Poppy Pods.  From eBay to private sellers until the arizona raid a couple of years ago I was very well situated with a 10 pod a day habit that let me tame the beast I had unleashed with alcohol.  I moved onto PST (poppy seed tea) when the price of pods became prohibitively expensive ($10/pod) and have since been more than a little curious about other options for my daily dose of dopamine manipulators.

After following BitCoin through the $30 bubble and checking out SilkRoad a couple of times a few months passed and I decided that there most be some kind of non-scamy activity happening. Otherwise there would not be so much press surronding the road, random people speaking of it, etc, etc.

So I took my time researching the current vendors on the road focusing most of my efforts on the several hundred pages of the Herion thread(s) on the silkroad forums.  NoGenRX seemed to be the practical choice with grams of suppoedly excellent #4 heroin in the $250 a gram range.  After recieving this first order and sampling H I knew it was a turning point and my life would enter a honeymoon phase with the drug that continues to this day.

I've now sampled 3 vendors from the silkroad which I can recommend and would like to state that it is indeed a fine place to get what you need in times of need.  You must do thorough research on the forums and stick to the rules of using the escrow system and not being the first person to try out a new vendor if you hope to get what you are paying for.

Now for the vendors:

**NoGenRX**

NoGen has #4 heroin from Canada and recently has been going through some problems in keeping up with demand.  Here is what his heroin looks like:

http://s16.postimage.org/aqtdidgk5/nogen5.jpg


**Nod**

Nod perhaps has the best service that I've seen on the Road.  He is a friendly guy and very professional. He sells black tar heroin from the U.S. and can ship overnight.  He has reliably had listings to purchase for several weeks now and reliably sends things out overnight.  The price for his tar is perhaps something that may astonish folks around here @ $300/gram but the quality is IMO up near the level of NoGen's #4. My picture sort of sucks for Nod's tar but here it is anyways:


http://s7.postimage.org/ngbnc5cu3/nod.jpg

**PeoplesDrugStore**

PeoplesDrugStore is somewhat of a newcomer on the scene, offering #4 from canada like NoGenRX and a couple of other popular vendors ( TomorrowMan and NorthernDancer as well as the famed ""Opi"" ).  I went out of escrow for this order, but would not recommend anyone else do the same. Prices are similar for this #4 at $250/gram. Heres a couple of pictures I just took:

I hadn't seen a direct discussion here regarding vendors on the road and thought it would benefit those who have thought of looking into it but have not because of lack of easily accessible information.  I think (personally) that not dealing with real life dealers of hard drugs may be worth the premium that is being charged on the road.  There is still obviously legal risk but at least the possibility of getting ensnared in some dealer's legal or personal or financial drama is lessened by having that dealer seperated by several hundred or thousand miles."	t5_2r0y3	True

This is the first time ive actually done a 30 day inpatient program. Ive tried 5 day detoxes, IOP, and a Dual Diagnostic Program in my area to no avail. So I hope getting away, (3-4 states away to be exact) will help me quit. Im in it for the long haul this time. Im sick of this shit and I need to get clean.

The place im going to has the highest success rate on the east coast, *and* has a program specifically for those with diagnosed chronic pain and an opiate addiction (read: me). So this is just a temporary goodbye, and I just wanted to let everyone know that im not dead and will be back in a month or so. Maybe even early if we have access to the internet, but im not sure.

If any of you feel like sending me a letter or whatever (I dont suspect anyone will) You can mail it to:

__________________________
Anything would be greatly appreciated and I will reply back if anyone decides to send a letter. Obviously you guys dont have to, but I will be absolutely elated if I do receive any mail.

So wish me the best of luck guys. I really want to get clean this time and find out if my chronic pain is worse because of the hypersensitivity caused by years of opiate abuse, and see if my depression is real, or just a side effect of my poly drug abuse.

Ill see you guys in a month or so, and as always: *be safe, not stupid*

Much love, John D. aka the infamous terqui.

1374447733.0	1iry88	My son is an addict. What do I do?	confusedthrowaway333	49	14	123	"First a little background. Yesterday life fine. I have a lovley wife and a son - whom I love very much - in college (not really in college since I don't live in the US, but you get the point).

No one in out family has ever been doing very well in school, and neither did my son but he until yesterday I thought he did okay. However, now I don't know what to think.

Yesterday I was helping him doing some paperwork and went to his room to look for some bank papers. Instead I found a drawer full of what I think was heroin. I'm not sure on the excat drug but there was syringes and drugs.

This basiclly made my world fall apart. I smoked my fair share of marijuana in my youth but that it. I belive hard drugs are just as bad as any other parent without any exposiour to them would. Now I have honestly no idea what to do. This is obviously a huge violation of trust, but since it's such a serious thing I needed some time to think about how to react. Since I found serveral syringes I figured this has been going on for a while (If it was me I would be extremly carefull to get rid of all evidence for the first long period of time - it takes confidence to get sloppy). I went on a ""bussiness trip"" to the nearest hotel to think for some time. That's were I am now.

I think I read every single ""help, my kid is doing drugs"" page on the internet. A few hours ago I found this subreddit and have also read every single post for the last month of so.

What worries me the most is that most of you seem to like what you are doing and doesn't want to stop. I guess this means I have every reason to believe my son doesn't want to stop either.

I am obviously going to contact the local help centers for parents like me very soon but I would like to get your views on it as well. What do a confused dad like me do?

I obviously **do not want** my son do you these kinds of drugs. I have not talked to *anyone* yet - not even my wife. The reason for this is that she would definitly not be able to wait a few days thinking the situation through.

Som facts:

* My son is 20 years old
* He currently lives at home (for free) but are looking for his own place.

Again. I am devastated, sad, confused and angry. I read that some of you have been kicked out, and while I obviously do not want to be a part of this and support his habbits also have a hard time seing how kicking him out should help anything. Some of you have been pulled out of college and into rehab but it also seems like rehap is diffecult enough when you truly are motivated to quit - and pointless if you do not want to.

What do I do?

So I lost my Mom to breast cancer coming up on 8 years ago. It was 2 weeks before my 21st birthday. I was a junior in college and I lived with 5 other people. My Mom had been sick for awhile and I had gone home to see her in the hospital the weekend before. It was to say my goodbyes but I guess I didn't let myself believe that she was going to die and that this was going to be the last time I was going to see her. Its unfortunate because I would have said alot more to her than I did. I was just so in denial that I treated the last visit like I had treated the countless other hospital visits other the course of her 5 year battle. Thankfully, the last words I got to say to her were ""I love you"" before I left. 


One week to the day after I uttered those words, I got the worst phone call I have ever received. It was 2 am and I was dead asleep when my phone rang. I drearily looked at the phone display: Incoming call from ""Pops"". I knew before I even picked up the phone what was waiting for me on the other end.


""Hello?""

""It's me. Mom's gone"" was all that was said thru tears on the other end of the line.

""I'm on my way""


The house had a single lane driveway and of course, mine was the last car in. I had to wake up everyone in the house, uncontrollably crying, so they could move their cars and let me out. I threw some clothes into a duffle bag, snorted 60 mg's of Adderall, and got into my car. I have the image of my room mates standing on the front porch at 2am, this look of sorrow and helplessness in their eyes, seared into my brain as I pulled away and started the 4 hour drive home.


4 hours and a pack of butts later I got to the hospital and it was just getting light out. My entire extended family was already there. I had had a long car ride to cry, think and pull myself together on the way home so I parked my car and walked into the hospital like a zombie going thru the motions. I remember the elevator doors opening and entering the cancer wing. When I turned the corner, I saw my whole family standing at the end of the hall. I walked toward them and was greeted by a doctor. He shook my hand and looked me straight in the eye.


""I just want you to know that your mother was one of the best people I have had the pleasure of working with. I say pleasure because although the circumstances of which she was here were terrible, she was an incredibly strong fighter and was positive until the end.

Well, that sent me over the edge. I lost it. Broke down and cried like a girl. I challenge anyone reading this to go thru that and come out on the other side with a dry eye.


Anyway, after I said my goodbyes, we got back to my house and lo and behold, my Ma Dukes' supply of 180 20mg OG OC's. I was hurting and this was exactly what I needed to numb the pain. I took a handful and brought them up to my room. Back then, my tolerance was relatively low compared to what it is now so 2 20's got me nice and noddy. I spent the next 2 days helping with planning the funeral, dealing with insurance scumbags and going thru her stuff in an opiate induced haze. After the initial handful ran out, I went to go re-up from the medicine cabinet. Gone. 180 20mg OC's, GONE! I went from drawer to drawer to cabinet to cabinet looking for the bottle. I was so frenzied that after 15 minutes of frantic searching, I straight up asked my Pops where they were.

""I flushed them""

""You fucking WHAT?!?!?""

""I flushed them because I knew you'd get into them""


I felt like I had been stabbed in the gut. So. Much. Free. Drugs....wasted. And at that moment, I had the realization that I was an addict. I had forgotten about the fact that my Mom had just died and was upset about drugs. My Mom wasn't even in the ground and I had already forgotten about her and was intensely pissed off about drugs. 


This was my first realization. It was healthy for me because I have atleast acknowledged it. I don't know if I will ever have full control of it. But atleast I know. Thanks to anyone who read all that. Been awhile since I could get that off my chest and I wasted half an hour at work. Happy Nods."	t5_2r0y3	True

1375987651.0	1jz1bd	Hey...	wastingmyair	43	8	53	"I kind of disappeared about two weeks ago, so, just wanted to drop in and let y'all know that I'm alive and what not. 


The last time I used was Friday - July 25th. I had made a subs appointment prior to this and was scheduled for the 29th, but I had to cancel due to finance issues. I went into WD's as expected, but by Sunday, I knew something was ""off""... This was the worst WD cycle I had ever experienced. A friend suggested a preggo test and so I did. Positive. Oh, fuck. Between Sunday night and Monday morning, a lot of shit hit the fan, but I'll spare you the drama.


It just so happens that the nearest sub doctor to me is also an ob/gyn. I call Monday morning and explain my situation and beg for my appointment back, or anything they can get me in on asap. She tells me to come on in, but I couldn't get there right away since I had no car at the moment and it's a 45 mile trip there. She rearranges a few appointments for the afternoon and tells me to just be there when I can.


I get there and they do a drug screen and pregnancy dip to confirm both reasons for being there. She then sends me to a local pharmacy to pick up 15 8mg sub's to begin treatment with. Go back to the office and she gets me started on the film... Half strip at a time. Between needing to monitor my symptoms and fine tune my dose and the aforementioned drama, she decides to admit me to the hospital. Best sleep I ever had! WD's going away, lies and deception about my addiction are out in the open, and I felt safe being sober for once in my life. I don't remember much else about that day, though.


We get me to 12mg film for my daily dose and I get sent home late Tuesday afternoon. Since I am pregnant, she doesn't want to keep me on the films, because naloxone is not very studied in pregnancy, so, as soon as the pharm gets in subutex... I've got a script for that.


I had a follow up appointment the 5th. I am just about a month pregnant. I caught it so early because the WD symptoms and early preg symptoms combined. Based on blood work and scans, things are progressing as they should be. We will be able to see a heartbeat at my next appointment, if things continue to go well. 


After switching from subs to subx, we had to increase my dose just a little. Up to 16mg/day and I honestly feel *normal* again. I've started going to meetings, taking better care of myself and continuing with mental health treatment. I see a pretty bright future for myself... Especially since summer is almost over and I'm starting work again. 


Sorry for the boring wall of text. TLDR: Shit hit the fan with family/friends, found out I'm pregnant, getting clean (almost two weeks!)...


How are y'all doing? What have I missed? Give me a r/opiates cliff notes!

I also pulled my grandmother aside the day of my grandfathers funeral so I could give some bullshit excuse in order to get money from her. As soon as I could, I left without telling anyone and picked up a bundle while still wearing my suit. I felt like shit but my dude hooked me up with 2 extra bags as a way to give his condolences.

1353628582.0	13n5el	A note about addiction.	genericwit	45	10	52	"I see a lot of people saying they're addicted, or not addicted, and hardcore users [or chippers] proclaiming, ""Oh, that's nothing, you're not addicted,"" or ""Of course you're addicted, you're in denial.""  However, while I think this can be well-meaning, it's often misguided.

Addiction is fluid, and believe it or not, not an actual diagnosis.  ""Addict"" is a pejorative term and one used as an identity for recovering addicts.  Professionals speak in term of Dependence and Abuse, which I believe are more helpful terms, and can co occur but do not necessarily.

Someone who abuses a drug is someone who spends a great deal of time acquiring or recovering from the drug, uses the drug in dangerous situations, and/or uses drugs despite negative effects to social or vocational [school/work] life.  Someone who abuses drugs can have a few or all of these qualities.

Dependence, however, is a much more stringent criteria.  Dependence implies a cycle of using increasing amounts of a drug to get the same effect [or using the same amount and getting no effect], trying to quit the drug, experiencing withdrawals, and then increasing drug-seeking behavior to avoid withdrawals.

Obviously, these criteria are not all inclusive.  They don't necessarily catch the dependent user who never tries to quit and only uses medication as prescribed, or adequately describe it.  However, I think these terms are more useful than making a blanket statement that someone is an ""addict.""

Now, since I work in the mental health profession, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine--and maybe you all don't really care about the distinction between abuse and dependence, addicts and junkies.  But I think there are a lot of really common misconceptions about addiction, and if we ever want to see an end to the stigma of opiate and drug use, we as a community at least need to start using less stigmatizing language."	t5_2r0y3	True

BluePillsLostHope	52	21	46	"We’re often asked, “Why dope?” This question is not easily answered, mostly because half of the time we don’t have any fucking idea.. but we can’t stop. After a while its just life, you can’t live with the drugs.. but you can’t live without them even more. We get high because the world’s uncomfortable, uninteresting and unbearable. Always.

So when your friend notices the track marks you’ve been attempting to conceal with long sleeve shirts and jackets, simply tell them this; we get high to cope or to forget, we get high to think or to stop thinking, we get high to relate to others or maybe we don’t want to relate at all. We get high to fit in, or we get high because we’ve blended in too much. We get high to feel something, and sometimes to feel nothing at all. But most of all we get high because we’re empty, and we’re empty because we’re missing something.. the key to being a functional member of society. We don’t possess what’s required to be, like them. We’re just desperately trying to survive in their world, because it certainly isn’t ours. We’re trying to function, think and behave.. the way the rest of them do.

Except with our irregular pupils, our track marks and slurred speech, we still aren’t very functioning. And yet multiple times a day I’m able to easily convince myself that my blacked out eyes, my shaky hands, my slow beating heart and my slowed state of mind have absolutely no effect on how well I’m able to function in society. All of the things I tell myself are fallacies, but I’m capable of believing them regardless. Junkie justification; it’s our must powerful weapon against our own common sense and comprehension of what it means to be healthy and productive.

Anything can be justified, when you’re a junkie."	t5_2r0y3	True

You realize you’re killing yourself but you don’t have enough self worth to beat the craving-reward mechanism, usually because of an underlying depression that is related to, and fueled by, some source of guilt/shame. It quickly develops into a self-reinforcing spiral of self-loathing that drives you to your drug of choice as an escape, which you can’t resist because you just don’t have enough self-worth to muster the will to stop, and worse, you’re cognizant of that lack of self-worth. That only legitimizes the self-loathing in your head and further deepens the depression and isolation, because who in their right-fucking-mind would actually want to spend time with you? Anyone who does is obviously too selfless and decent to deserve the load of shit that is your worthless life, but-you’re-just-so-lonely-and-the-only-way-to-distract-yourself-is-to-do-the-one-thing-that-overwhelms-all-other-thought-processes-anyway…

We place them on a pedestal, and mentally build them up to be something better than they are. This results in making poor decisions chasing something that you think is worth it, but really isn't.

If right now, you can't think of anything that you could want more than a line or shot or whatever of your opiate of choice, then you gotta take a step back man.. There are a million wonderful things in this universe, and the high from opiates shouldn't be the main focus of your short time on earth.. Experience it, feel it out, but don't forget the important part- moving on.

At some point, you've gotta move on, move forward. To me, when I use, it is me giving in completely. Basically, it is me saying ""I can't handle this shit anymore, give me a break"".. but you can't live life seeking the same substance for the same break from reality for the rest of your life. That just seems dumb, and once you've done that you'll find your worshiping that substance, valuing it more than anything else.

I'm not telling anyone to stop using, or even suggesting it. All I'm saying is that if you find yourself worshiping this shit, try your hardest to take a break, take a step back, and re-evaluate your life from a position while you are not dependent.

Living your whole life high might seem nice in the moment, but in the end your just missing out on every other aspect of life just to chase one stupid substance.

And I'm not trying to pretend like I'm better than anyone here. I still crave more than anything that warm opiate blanket, I just know that in the long run, there's more out there than opiates, and I had put them on a pedestal and built them up in my mind to be something greater than they really are. It takes some sober time to try to figure shit out man.

ramble ramble ramble.. I'm done, this is really just a lot of non-sense thoughts that have been running through my head lately... Hope it helps someone out

I've been seeing lots of ""I met up with (redditor1) and scored this (picture) tonight! Nods were had!"" and such like that. Not to shit on the party, but maybe for everybody's safety, just keep it as a random person and not post the name?








In pretty much every one of these posts, one person will explicitly say that the other person got the drugs for them. The only thing is, thanks to Len Bias, if one of the individuals from that night decides to do a little too much and decides to not wake up anymore, that's a reckless homicide.






Sure, the cops might not care about a bunch of junkies on a website posting pictures of pills and/or heroin. But, with an overdose, now you have a pissed off family/friends, pissed off police department... you can be sure that they're going to check the victim's phone records, computer records, and so forth. And if the phone points to the computer, they will be more than happy to look at that person's history. Then, that cop going from not caring is going to care a whole bunch when he realizes he gets to put an open-and-closed homicide case in that portfolio of his.

He called me to come over so he could give me a couple of bottles which was quite an exciting prospect but as I arrived at his home I walked in on him prepping his rig to IV somewhere in the neighborhood of 80mg of methadose, which if you've been around this sub long enough you will know what a bad idea this is. I immediately slapped it out of his hands (which he didn't take too kindly to) saying ""BAD DOGGY! NO! BAD!"" and showed him the pictures of jmkogut's arm (can't find the link at the moment but hopefully he'll be kind enough to post them in the comments, but FYI they're are NSFL.) He had a panic attack over what he was about to do to himself (plus he can't handle gore which made it even worse.) If I had arrived 5 minutes later he could have lost his arm...or worse. Anyway, I'm posting this out of character to give kudos to jmkogut for making an example out of his mistake for all of us to show dire consequences involved with this decision and to aid in discouraging this outstandingly dangerous attempt to get high.

Its not worth the tears of loved ones, the strain on my body, the overdraft notices from my bank, the hobbies that haven't been nurtured...its not worth the responsibilities i've overlooked, having to wonder where i'd be if i never touched the stuff, and the depression that comes along with getting off the shit.  Its time to man up, and take the armor off.  There have been a lot of fun times over the past 8 years.  It started with the romance...the honeymoon with vicodin for my wisdom teeth...looking back its almost poetic, like all wisdom was ripped right out of my head at that moment.  I was in love...head over heels.  I found heaven in a pill.  Then oddly enough i discovered tramadol and the world of online pharmacies.  This is when i reached fiend status, and where my brain, under normal circumstances would have got the fuck out and never looked back...but alas, i was in way over my head.  Little did i know what the future had in store for me.

I began selling the tramadol, along with soma and weed throughout college.  I watched others get hooked which is something i will always feel guilty about.  One of my roommates had a problem i was unaware of when i first started selling to him, and within half a semester he went from 100mg to takin 750mg, 15 pills, to get high.  I had to cut him off, of course by then the damage was done and he knew where to get the shit himself.  I think it took having a seizure for him to realize he needed help.

The next flavor was codeine, online from new zealand.  Fiendin out took on new meaning.  I can remember days i would literally sit by the front door waiting for the mailman to come, running outside everytime i heard the hum of a diesel engine...like a dog waiting for his owner to get home...fucking pavlov.  The kitchen became my labratory, and i was doin a 24 pill (10/500) cwe just about every day.  Although i didnt introduce my roommates to the shit, i didnt mind being their supplier and assuming the risk of ordering scheduled narcotics online if it meant free drugs for me (this was the thinking in my drugged up mind).  Again, there will always be guilt for this.  

At this point i took a few weeks off, and spent a few days sick, and several weeks depressed and completely unable to sleep.  It had me, and i was miserable without it.  Then i saw something on the news while eating dinner with my parents that would change the course of my life forever.  I always knew baltimore had a pretty heavy opiate scene, but after seeing 'the wire' i was way too scared to ever fuck with it.  What i saw on the nightly news was a segment about the open air pharmacy that was lexington market.  They had busted people selling everything from suboxone to xanax to percocet.  Surely, i thought, none of that bad shit that happens in the projects of east and west baltimore would go down in a place like lex mark.  So the very next day i made the trip up, and within an hour of me turning the keys in the ignition, i had my hands on 10 5mg perc ir's at the low low price of 1$ a pop.  The progression of my addicition was slow...at this point it had been about 3-4 years and i could still get high on 20mg of percocet and either half or a full 350mg soma.  

From here the sky was the limit.  Copping shit off the street became part of the ritual that was getting high...it was all a rush...eveyday i was carrying out a secret mission...the pursuit of getting high. Eventually i got tired of this risk, and paying a little bit more to go to people i knew werent going to burn me or make me wait became standard procedure.  I went through a morphine phase for about 3 months right around the time i got laid off.  I have always been responsible as far as employment and never let getting high fuck that up.  Morphine was always ingested with a couple shots of vodka for what i referred to as laudanum.  It hit me hard, and the withdrawal was the worst i have ever experienced.  

I got to meet someone from this forum and that turned out much better than i thought it would.  Tried opana for the first time, which has always been a curiousity, and also saw someone shoot up for the first time, which i almost couldnt watch.  Be safe arnoldwhat.  You seem like you have a good heart and i wish u all the best in life.  If u ever decide to clean up you will always have a shoulder to lean on.

Tried dope a couple weeks ago.  Did it a few days in a row and truly hope that was it.  I always liked knowing my drugs were produced by people with phd's in white lab coats in a clean environment...as u all know, dope is a totally different ballgame. I also got some dilaudid last week which i havent had for at least 3 years.  I am going out with a bang, no pun intended as ive never used needles...all curiousities have been satisfied.  

I am very lucky to have people in my life who still support me through all of my lies and scumbaggery.  I am glad i never stole, and earned the money i used to buy drugs...i have enough guilt to deal with without thievery being on the list.  Most of all my parents and girlfriend.  We've been together 10 years and she's been my rock throughout this whole ordeal.  It would take 10 lifetimes to repay her, and i hope i can do the most i can in whatever time i have left on this earth.  Its just not worth the pain ive caused...i love her and my parents too much.  They don't deserve this.

I plan on remaining active in this subreddit as well as the one dedicated to sobreity.  I am always here to offer support and advice, as well as tips on harm reduction if you've made up your mind that you're going to use.  Stay safe everyone.

I will leave you with some lyrics from a song i wrote titled 'thin line' about the struggle we all know.  

I walk a thin line between love and hate,

Freedom and fate,

Makin somethin of yourself and throwing your life away

Tomorrow is just another day.

In the future, if I die, a friend will make a post on this account telling you. I'm making this arrangement so, maybe, we can avoid the weekly post asking what happened to f_l_j, or where I'm at.

I don't post a lot because, one, I don't want to over-extend my welcome and, two, I only post when I feel I have something worthwhile to contribute. The e-popularity I enjoy here is kind of nice, and I don't want to piss off a sub (mostly) full of people I consider friends (or, at the least, kindred spirits) with tons of inane shit. While I have plenty of friends in real-life and a decent social life, like many of you, this is one of the few places I can truly be myself without alienation or judgement over my lifestyle.

I know I've been stringing everyone along with promises of a blog or at least a continuation/conclusion of the Great Suboxone Mishap. I'm sorry about not posting it, but I've been trying to sell a collection of short stories to a publisher, and I was told it all needed to stay un-posted for the time being. That time is up, though, since I'm giving up on that pursuit and the manuscript is going back in the drawer.

Lastly, as much love as I get from you guys I get about as much hate. I don't know what I've done to piss so many of you off, but, honestly, if you get so worked up when you see my username that you feel the need to message me hate-mail and death-threats (yes, I'm serious) you seriously need to just go do some goddamn drugs. We're all junkies here, and if you're *that* fucking full of hate, maybe its time for you to up your daily dose.

Or, maybe, you can go fall in front of a bus. I couldn't really care less one way or another."	t5_2r0y3	True

1337004626.0	tmgl5	For all the opiate lovers out there that need a little motivation..	Bearlostatsea	42	8	33	"It all started 10 months ago, July 6th to be precise.  I decided to quit opiates.  I had been smoking oxycontin and fentanyl on a daily basis(80-160 mg of oxycontin, 100 mcg fentanyl) for a little less than a year. 

The decision to stop was an easy one, my habit was costing me more than I could ever make at my job or steal in randoms places.  My physical appearance was becoming quite scary (not that I really cared), I went from weighting 195 lbs to 135 lbs, emotional attachment was impossible, and I was simply tired of living that life.  

I moved in with my parents, and when they started to notice I wasn't feeling well, I confessed to them the real reason why I moved back. Not all parents would have acted like they did, but they made it their mission to get me out of that situation.  For that, I thank them everyday.  

Now, what I really want to say is that if somebody reads this post and is thinking about quitting opiates, please do so.  It would be completely illogical of me to start listing the reasons why it would be a good idea, but in this day and age, there is no reason to have to wake up every morning with opiates on your mind.  As I mentioned earlier, it has been 10 months,  it is not a record by any stretch, but I have to admit, I have never felt as great as I feel now.  When I go to bed at night, I don't think about how I am going to get my next fix, when I wake up I don't stress about how long I will have to wait to receive a txt from my dealer.  I wake up and I feel alive, I feel like I belong, and even though life can be a bitch sometimes, I can still thank myself and the people around me for helping me get out of that world.  

The first few months after I quit, I didn't think I would ever be happy to live without opiates, but guess what? That's bullshit, you create your own happiness, you can control you life.  Do you really want to be a bitch to the needle you whole life?  

I guess I wasn't the only one to notice my new found happiness, I met the girl of my dreams, somebody who doesn't quite understand what I went through but still tries to relate.  All these things that have happened in the last 10 months make me glad to be where I am.  I don't have a perfect life, I still get bad grades in school, I still have shitty days, but now those things don't seem so bad, as a matter of fact, I'm quite glad that I can have a horrible day and not have to bury my thoughts in fentanyl smoke.  I am no longer numb to my emotions, and that makes me happy.

I do understand that not all addicts want to or are ready to quit, it is after all one of the most wonderful feeling in the world.  But, if you are an addict reading this and you want to change your life, then do it.  It won't be easy and you'll often feel helpless and stressed beyond anything you have ever felt, you may become depressed, you may want to end it all.  But when you start to notice that you can get out of it, there is no better feeling.  When you stop making your life revolve around opiates, your whole outlook on life will change.  And is there a better time to quit? Summer time is coming around, do you want to miss out on sunny summer days by lying in your dark bedroom waiting for a fix that will only last a few hours??

We went from a post or two every few days to a hundred posts a week. All in the timespan of a couple months. The unique/impression counts on our traffic graphs grow exponentially every time I look.

I have never seen a reddit so small with so much activity before, this must be some sort of record. The first two pages of posts are within the past day alone.

I thank every last one of you for turning this reddit into what it is today. A place to feel accepted no matter how bad you've fucked up your life. A place to get support when you decide to turn things around. A place to talk dope without persecution because let's face it: we all love it (recovering or not).

I'd like to thank FractalGlitch for creating r/OpiatesRecovery. Although he's a newcomer, I see potential for that sub to help many people.

As many of you know, we hit 1k subs this week. It's been the happiest milestone we've reached to date. There's just 9k left to go till our next one.

In short, I feel like being high on opiates is what the human game SHOULD feel like. I'm normal and healthy and happy when I'm high. Yes, yes. I know that's the trap and sets the long hard road towards addiction. I've managed it effectively for years. 

It's such a crude and rudimentary way to feel normal, but those glimpses of bliss are sure hard to ignore. "	t5_2r0y3	True

1356968072.0	15q5j5	Reddit meet up gone wrong: Robbed at gunpoint, withdrawals, probably the best week of my life so far :-/		43	7	86	"Well I guess I'll start with the interesting part.. I've been meeting up with a user on here pretty frequently lately, and we've always gone to a dude he knows with a script. Dude with script was out, but I know my buddy had other sources and we had also discussed going to baltimore to cop, so I went to go meet up even though we didn't have a definite source.

All his connects weren't good, so we decided to head to the ghetto of baltimore. First mistake I made was leaving my $2000 macbook in plain site in my car before making the trip to the ghetto. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, sooo dumb.. but what's done is done. Anyway, streets are pretty empty at first, so I was a little discouraged and starting to get desperate as I knew crippling w/d's were right around the corner for me.

So, we finally see a spot with at least 5 black dudes who were obviously dope boys, and the approached my car as I slowed down. One dude was trying to talk through the window, but at the same time there were like a bunch of other dudes just banging on my windows and shit saying ""let me in! let me in! we gotta go!"" and shit like that, so I panicked, and again made a thoughtless decision and opened the door, and sped off with two black dudes in the back, me and friend from reddit are up front.

They instruct us to go to spot, and I look back and see the dude already has my laptop in his hands, so I ask him what he's doing and he hands it back to me saying some shit like ""what man? Nothing it was just sitting here"". At that point I shoulda just told them to fuck off but whatever, I was dumb and had never done anything like this before so I kept driving to a spot. They hop out, get back in, go to another spot that is really secluded. It was a dirt lot behind some buildings.. 

Dudes leave, come back 30 seconds later brandishing a giant fucking pistol, putting it me and my friend's head, threatening to kill us. I've never looked down the barrel of a gun before like that, and it was fucking terrifying. I lost $100 cash, cell phone, and my lap top. My dude lost $20 and his phone. We both got pistol whipped pretty good, which left us bleeding pretty profusely from the head as we drove out of baltimore.

I drove my friend to a hospital, dropped him off, and decided I wanted to head home so it would be easier explaining to my parents what happened.. (If I went to a hospital way out near where I was, it would be hard to explain why I was all the way out there, 45 minutes from home)

Made the drive home, told my parents essentially exactly what happened but left out the part that I was looking for dope, and lied about where I was. Dad took me to the urgent care clinic and I got stitched up and a little script of hydrocodone (small victory in a sea of shit, its keeping me well for the time being)... 

So, here I am, dopeless, down ~$2500 worth of shit, and I've only got 5 5/500 hydros left. My most significant w/d symptom is extreme nausea, which makes it really hard for me to pop a few hydros to get well, because I'm scared I'm gunna puke them up before they get absorbed. 

I woke up today feeling like absolute shit. I'm going to report this to the police in hopes that my laptop turns up at a pawn shop or something, but I doubt its gunna do much.

Just sharing my story in hopes of stopping someone from doing something equally stupid. I made several mistakes during this, and if I had been smart I probably could have ended up getting dope, instead of getting all my shit taken...

Just be careful guys, staring down the barrel of a gun like that was fucking terrifying, and something that I'd never want any of you to go through. 

I wish you all the best.. BTW, I left out the name of the redditor who was with me incase he doesn't want to share this with the community, but he knows who he is.. Hope you're ok man, I'm just glad we got out of this OK.

Insurance will cover my phone after I pay a $99 fee, but nothing else is covered so I'm gunna have to pay for a new laptop before I go back to school in a couple weeks. :-/"	t5_2r0y3	True

Perhaps one of the worst nights ever period, an unbelievable waste of time and money.  Disclaimer: this is a long story 

First off, I was on vacation away from my normal connects so I had no one to cop from.  Incidentally I had spoken to this redditor before about local open air spots and he contacted me to let me know he just got a new fire dope connect.

So I arranged to head out to him towards the evening, and repeatedly called him throughout the day to make sure that everything would be good with his dude when I got out there relatively late at night.  My experience with dope connects is that they generally stop serving after 8:00 or 8:30, so I was skeptical that this would even be possible.  My other boy then hit me up to say that i could get raw through his dude, but I didn't want to flake on the redditor so i declined that offer...

So I get out to this dude, and we then go out to scoop the girl with the connect.  I then learn that this girl is on house arrest, so even having her in the car is PC to search and just fucking stupid.  Anyway then we learn that her dude is all out and has been for several hours, but apparnetly there hasn't been any communication between redditor and her during the times i continually asked ""is it straight"". She says has other connects so it's still possible to cop, so it's not a problem.  At this point I would have rather dropped everyone off and gone home.

So we then drive far as hell to a gutter ass house to pick up another grimey bitch who has the connect.  So to not be a suspicious full car we drop the redditors off and me and these two girls i don't know are off to cop in the city.. Before even getting 10 feet the chick in the back is like ""can i smoke in your car"", and since it's a brand new car i was like ""no you can't smoke cigarettes"".  She replies ""Oh no it's not a cigarette"", so I am like ""no you defintiely can't smoke weed"".  

**""Oh no baby this ain't no weed, this that crack rock""** as she has her crack pipe loaded up and lighter in hand.  So now I have a bitch literally smoking crack in my backseat as we drive to the ghetto to score dope...

Ok so eventually we get to the city and we wait for 10 minutes parked in literally the worst neighborhood I ahve ever been in - all of hte houses are boarded up and there are open air dealers crawling hte streets and peering in the windows trying to sell us shit.  Finally the dude shows up and we cop and go back to the house to do the product. 

Oh yeah, the house where everyone was hanging out and shooting up was a former recovery house.  And it also had the power shut off, because the owner relapsed and didn't pay the bills.  So we get back there and all these kids are booting up by candlelight.  I sniff so i didn't give a shit, but i really wanted to get the fuck out of there.

Oh yeah, the crackhead apparently 'burned' someone earlier in the day at the recovery house, so she desperately needed a ride for her and her bf away from there.  I couldn't help her since my car was full, but she was pulling out all the stops.  ""I'll lay in the trunk, I'll lay on the ground, they won't see me, it won't be a problem."" blah blah.  eventually i just threw her an extra $10 to shut the fuck up and take a cab.

So i do the ""dope"", and it is by far the worst h i've ever done in my life.  The $10 scramble pills were like .3-.5 of powder, and probably .02-.05 of actual dope.  So you can imagine how much disgusting cut is in that.  Honestly like the most ignorant form of opiates i've ever encountered, just for really struggle people who can only scrounge up $10 to get a dialy shot type thing.

so i throw the redditor a $10 shot for ""hooking it up"", throw his friend 3/4 of a shot for free because he was broke and i didnt want to see him go sick (and because that wasn;t going to do anything to me anyways), and then throw that crackhead bitch $10 to not drive with 6 people in a tiny car.  

Drop everyone off, drive home, do the rest of what i copped, not even pinned.

**what a meet up!!!!!**

Well for those of you following I thought I'd throw another update out there, It's been about two weeks since my last one and about a month since I stated I was getting off diesel. Week one was when my wife went off to rehab and my daughter went to go live with my wifes sister out west in Idaho. That week I was kicked out of my home for stealing, then after a little brief homeless hustle I ended up staying in my friends basement for about two weeks. After being so grateful to sleep in a bed and to have food every day a few times a day I continued looking for work, and secured a job at mcdonalds that I'm still waiting to start on. In this time I did heroin once and didn't get caught, thought I was slick and I was slick enough to get away with it that time, shot my bags went home and chilled in my room for a bit and enjoyed that beautiful golden warmth we've all grown to love, after that I was out of money and wasn't looking to scheme to get more bags. After I those bags though something in my mind went off, I started going to parties a bit and went to a Brooklyn rave, maybe some of you guys were there it was at the electric factory if you were there you raved hard, I know I did. I ate two tabs of acid and ate over 1.2 grams of Molly (or meth) over the course of 6 hours. After this night of course I ended up telling myself ""Oh of course I have a heroin problem, so I should be able to eat MDMA as much as I want and that won't drive me insane""; the kicker, I've already lost my fucking mind, over the next few days I get a gram of molly for free and sell it off, make a few flips and then bam I have money for my two favorite things, weed and heroin. That was this last friday when I had all the money I needed, I tried to cop but my boy wasn't good and I don't have a car. All that night was spent thinking about how the next day I was going to feel that subtle pinch under my skin, feel that flow of junk through my veins, and that sudden relief when it hits your brain. Every second of the shot I romanticized and plotted out so the millisecond. 

   Staurday, I woke up and immediately got onto my friends laptop to text my boy about his diesel he picked up early early in the AM. A little background my boy is a very very known junkie in my town, and I am as well. Everyone still has a little bit of love for me but when they see me with this other dude they know somethings up, my biggest fear that day was being seen with him by somebody else I knew... So he answers pretty quickly he's not back into town yet but he's heading straight to me when he gets here, and he did. I closed all my incriminating laptop windows, signed out of everything and made sure my conversations were deleted to ensure my safety. I leave the house walk down the driveway where my boys (let's call him Jon) old beat up car that he never bothers to repair because he's too deep into the grind is waiting for me to jump in, money in pocket, skateboard in hand since I told my friend that I was going to go skate. I jump into the car, Jon has been homeless for a good while now and has been sleeping in his car it smells like sweat when you fall asleep with your shirt on under too many blankets, you know the smell. He looks as thin as ever but he always has, we both just looked like a good old fashioned pair of junkies in a car. Jon and I used to shoot heavy together, we watched one of our friends fall out on our couch once and luckily we were able to bring him back without medical attention but me and Jon bottom line, have been through some shit.

   The ride begins, we go to our local truck stop where I make the exchange and tell him I planned to chill for a bit since I definitely couldnt go home for how fucked up I was about to get, he agrees to chill and we do our business. Bags in hand but only one cooker, his shit so of course he went first I watched every second as intently as I could without being weird, but it was. He jams, and it's finally my turn, I cook up my dope and at the last second ""hey man you wanna throw in a milligram of Xanex on that?"" I've never shot dope and benzos at the same time but I've heard it put you in hard nodsville, so I cook up my my four bags, throw in some extra water and add my xanex. I never tie off because my veins are fucking beautiful for dope and I jam myself. Feelsgoodman.jpg loved it, the rush was amazing it was one of the best rushes I've had in my life, we chill on our diesel for a bit and get a soda from mcdonalds, and that's where it all went wrong as it could've. While jon and I were sitting in front of mcdonalds drinking our soda my other friend pulled up in his car and saw us, he came over said hi and we exchanged pleasantries and apparently the second he left he called the people I was staying in ""Jon and Miguel are hanging out together, so watch it"" basically is what the call said, I didn't know until later that this happened and I'm not mad or surprised it happened it;s just because people care and are tired of me shooting my life away. So later I finally make it home but i'm still on hard nods, i shot another two bags after my original four to keep a good high until bed time. I sit in front of the computer and plunk away at reddit and things like that, apparently I was nodding while typing and looked pretty fucked up so my friend and his girlfriend confront me
""Miguel, we heard you were chilling with Jon today and you've been acting kind of weird so we have to ask, did you do heroin today""
me-""No of course not, I'm just not feeling well and I didn't sleep much last night"" (my friend had a heroin addicted dad my excuse didn't fly)
""Well Miguel, I watched my dad for years and when I let my friend Rob stay here and he relapsed, he used the sick excuse and I'm not buying it""
  We go on for a bit but I was caught, no way to get out of it, everyone knew, I cried apologized and started packing my things, everyone came over unplanned that night so everyone saw what happened and everyone knows I relapsed. This lead to no one wanting me in their home and I spent the night outside wishing I never knew what heroin was like, I didn't get high, I lost everything I lost my wife, my child, my home, my well being, my self worth, everything was gone and the act was heroin, the problem; me. After two days of trudging the world feeling bad and accumulating the smells of the world my one friend decided to take me into her home, her parents fought hard but no one wanted to see me suffering outside, If i agreed to be babysat and never leave the house alone I could stay here. they also wanted me to go to detox and start going to NA meetings, there was no state funding for detox since i don't have insurance so I've been on lockdown going to meetings every day since tuesday, it's finally dawned on me the problem is me, and to fix it I don't just need to change my life and surroundings I need to change everything about myself. I finally start work next week and I'm looking for a second job. My wife gets out of rehab in two weeks and she expected me to do so much more, I've failed my goal and now all I can do is everything I can to make things right again. Today my only real job is not to get high and it's full time and hard as fuck. That's where it is for now my friends, I have nothing after having everything, I hope someone can learn from my story but me typing these updates is as much for me as it is for you, hopefully the next one will be me telling you how well I'm finally doing and that I finally became the man I've always wanted to be. Working on it, stay well out there friends.

TL;Dr, I lost everything to heroin due to my own actions, and now I'm fucking serious as shit about getting clean, haven't even smoked weed and looking to stay that way. Always thank you for letting me shit on this subreddit with my life, you guys are the best."	t5_2r0y3	True

1349564766.0	1129zo	From chipping for 6 years to shooting up for a month straight... (long story long)	halfwayjux	33	5	36	"So I started doing opiates at 15, 15mg roxis and 2mg dilaudids of which one would make me feel divine. After the most taken route of weed &gt; crazy shit &gt; opiates. I was fortunate to be the last of my group of friends to start doing them, and saw many of them become addicted so I learned to never do them more than a day and a morning straight, no matter what, pill or powder. Although pills were fucking skittles, bullshit, compared to what heroin did to me and gave me an additional ""soul"" high. After that opiates were on my mind daily, and I started doing them weekly, bi-weekly, then a long long weekend straight. And so I stopped. For a while.

After a great number of months I thought it was possible to chip as I had before, doing them monthly or less, and I pulled it off, until last summer when I first shot dope and sniffed it before that a few days a week, enough that I had to feel like a schmuck taking piggybanks to the closest coinstar that I hadn't cashed out already. Spending money that I shouldn't have, and so it goes. So I stopped...

And then, I started dabbling in pills again, because pills I'll never have a problem with, only heroin is my downfall, well and maybe really good hard while on it, but that's not even that bad. So I did the pills on occasion and got away with it.

Beginning of Summer was the honeymoon. I got bags every now and then, blew a couple, got retarded, balls were itching and I had no problem scratching them violently in public, in front of who gives a flying fuck. Nod, nod, nod. Don't come home, sleep wherever, it's not REM sleep anyway. Do it a few days in a row and get those false visions of exhaustion...

Silk Road FUCKED it up. One of my best friends made an account and soon began receiving quarter, half, and full grams of #3 and #4 heroin at purity of around 90+ percent. I began going upstate to see him weekly, and only smoking or snorting this gorgeous shit that had to have been skimped off bricks in Afghanistan or some shit, I don't know how else it would've been available. And so began my decline into addiction, low to moderate by my standards. Because it started costing too much for skimped street bags that we ended up settling for, I started to shoot it up. And after the second, third, fourth and fifth shot, it didn't stop. So I did it for five days straight, didn't get sick. Didn't ever get sick for six years.

Since the beginning of September, up to four days ago, I had syringes in my arms for all but one day of that month. Found homeless junkies in the village who I bought a bag for buying me bags and one of them left their dealer's number in my phone. The end. Sixty dollar bundles of decent Arizona became $80 bundles of the infamous Purple Label that did me so good for a while. Well, anyway, it was a few bags over a day, and it led up to sometimes booting shit buns in a night, smoking hard on top. No money for crack after that, since only heroin could consume me as it did. Better than sex? Pfff. Sex is for idiots who don't know what ""orgasmic"" really feels like. I started loving the bathrooms of White Castle who didn't even care if I bought anything to use them and doing it there every day, sometimes a few a day.

Two thirds into the month-long binge I started to feel that it wasn't fun anymore. I anxiously waited for my dealers who came soon enough, but I started worrying about being sick in jail, if I got caught, and since I'm already on probation for a couple more years, hopefully only one more, that it'd be even worse. So I decided I had to stop, after ripping great friends off and encouraging them to cop saying that I was getting ten bucks off, ha ha! More like charging you enough so that my bundle or so became free. Scumbag? Oh yeah! Like I gave a shit then. Then there was no more money that wasn't mine to spend anyway on it, and my insulin syringes were dull after the unknown number of bruises and sometimes I found to my horror that that bruise on my forearm WAS NOT FUCKING COOL and WAAAY too fucking big for normalcy. Okay, relax. One more day. Yeah, tomorrow will be it. For a week or so...

Run out of funds and so I get a few subs spotted from the friend I ripped off, guilt-free. Asshole! The first day of sobriety was the worst, having shot up a dose that didn't even get me right, just content until I started not being able to get comfortable and aching, cold, hot, both at the same time! Online it said to give it 12-24 until dosing on subs. Well, I only did after 36 hours, and only because I had restless leg and trouble sleeping. One milligram worked. After that, I never really felt sick, even though I shot decent to good dope for a month straight, and heard of people doing small amounts of opiates for a week and crying, shitting and puking. What the fuck? Am I immune? Clearly not, since I felt some withdrawal symptoms, but I'm still wondering why they were so minute? The urge to cop was only there the first sober day.

I know I can't responsibly use opiates anymore, even if I won't be a junkie telemarketer... I know that it'll only be heroin, and only intravenous, because I soon became addicted to the needle. Oh, they didn't lie. I used to dread shots, and now I can't wait for the next one. Drug dealers became my best friends and public bathrooms my favorite place to be. Real friends told me to chill and hit them up when I wasn't being rude - was I? Who cared?

My only regret is ripping off those who didn't deserve it, and never shooting the Silk Road dope. I probably would've died with my amateur tolerance. It was hard to do dope when it was a lot of money, but it really fucked up when it became $60 a bundle and direct, in less than five minutes of wait. Well, now, as opposed to before, I actually want to stop doing it all, bad drugs, weed, ""good"" drugs, except acid, I need that one more time. I'd like to thank dope for somehow making me forget about my depression and self-loathing, which I had harbored before, it only took regularity to open my eyes to the problem that is I.

In closing, I'm sorry, as a writer I haven't written anything in over a month worth of value, who would want to do anything productive anyway right? So I apologize for any scrambled thoughts or typos, and I know I got lucky, and I don't need to test it anymore. I've done enough, and only have 4-ACO-DMT, 2-CI and LSD to recommend to those who wouldn't take advantage or abuse them.

By god though, casual chippers are strong mental motherfuckers, and I was one for long enough. Now comes all the shit I neglected and procrastinated, writing, music and other arts, the endless conquest for all possible retained knowledge and a never-ending progression. Maybe some day I'll be back, but you best believe it'd be Silk Road quality to start. By the way, that site is the future of the drug market and my friend is making enough off of it to take away more of his soul as a result. Our friends died from this, and well, someone's gonna make the buck, it might as well be they who ran in the same circle.

Sorry about the novella, have a wonderful and responsible existence and feel free to dole out all comments, questions and criticism. Peace gods!

When someone gets in here and takes their agression out on some other redditor, by directly implicating that redditor in crimes, they are being a selfish, whiney, little brat. AND if that someone is you than you're implicating yourself; making you a selfish, whiney, ignorant, little brat. Ignorance is not a lack of intelligence, I'm not calling you stupid. But stupid choices stem from ignorance, often self imposed (blissful ignorance). 

You're playing a game out there, and getting robbed is part of it. Be thankful you're not knifed or dead. Leave the game out there. Just because someone lets the same dude F them twice, doesn't mean they have the permission of the universe to tarnish this reddit community as a whole. 

If you're thinking you're going to save someone from getting screwed, you're wrong. Just because you have a voice on this subreddit doesn't make it the Angie's list of drug dealers. Go find or start that list if you want. I think it's a great idea. But this isn't the place for it. Shit, go create, /r/opiatesangieslist or make a Geocities page (lol, does that still work?)

Known well for their really annoying inability to just STFU and be conquered, the Afghan people have been pumping out some hardcore boy, and other opium preparations for many, many moons. Plus, you can have sex with goats, if you're a guy. If you want to, Im saying. Aaah, Stevie Nicks.

So, instead of just hopping a train, which seems fucking insane to me, Im instead thinking we sneak our way into a cargo container. From there, it's all downhill. Fucking easy, right? We'll be fucking *delivered* to our dope destination. All the while, HeroinKing and his band of ruffians will be on the side of some highway, getting ketchup packets thrown at them by passers-by, while they stand there with their thumbs out.

I plan on arriving in Kabul via mule train. If you've never ridden an ass before, don't worry... in Afghanistan, you can have sex with them too!

I know what you're thinking... this sounds too good to be true! But I assure you, once we hit Kabul, we check out a few bazaars, hang out with some locals, and rent a nice stretch next to a poppy field.

The way I see it, there's no way this can fail.

So, who's with me?

**Edit**: This has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I wasn't invited to go on HeroinKing's trip. I don't want to go. "	t5_2r0y3	True

1374385556.0	1iqktk	"Wrote this out in a comment thread, decided it needed its on post. ""The czarist experience I had coping in Baltimore"" Please share yours as well."	Face_first	32	5	55	"There are so many! This one is one of my favorites but I am not proud of it because its pretty fucked up, but hey we all do fucked up shit when were in the grips, am I right?

Me and my 2 friends were about 18, broke and in this midst of full blown heroin addiction. We were all sitting outside smoking and trying to figure out the score for the day. My one friend, we call him ""Marky"" had a brilliant Idea, an Ice Cream truck, and fully loaded up fridge with Ice Cream and a bad ass jingle that blared over the intercom was all sitting 10 years away from us in a garage. The kids house that we were hanging out at, who's name is ""Pancho"" for this story, his parent inherited the truck and used it on the weekends around the neighborhood to make the kiddy's happy. At first Puncho was saying ""Hell no...fuck that shit...my Dad will kill me...blah blah blah"" He also said ""I don't even know where the keys are."" So I said, lets just go in, see whats in it an look around.

Once we got into the truck, witch was roomy as shit l'd like to add, I noticed something, the keys, sitting right in the fucking ignition! Score. So as Pancho goes into his house to grab more smokes, me and Marky decide we are doing this shit, its hot as fuck out and we can slang the shit out of some Rocket Pop's. Pancho comes back out and me and Mark outline the plan for him. It was currently 10:00AM, by the time we get all the ice cream out of the freezers in the garage, gas up and get on 95 it would be around 11AM. We lived north of Baltimore, about 25-30 min away, but we were going to the west side so It was going to take a little longer, maybe 45 min. So we could expect to arrive in the city and start selling ice cream and pops at around 12pm, sell ice cream for about 3 hours or as long as it takes to get enough to fulfill out habits and then get back an hour before Pancho's parents return so we can make it look like the truck never left.

I'm guessing by this time Pancho is feeling the middle to late stage or withdraw, and says fuck it lets load up! OH YA ITS ON, WE FINNA SLANG SOME MAH'FUKIN SPIDERMAN POPS!

So we hit the road, 95 to 695 to Norther Parkway into the Jungle. We ride around until we find a small project building hit the tunes and drive around it 5 or 6 times....nothing, not one person. I had the bright Idea to put on some Lil John (it was the only CD in the truck) and play that instead of the ""Ice cream song"". So with the Master of Crunk ready to get Jiggy we head about 2 miles down the road, im not sure of the roads or neighborhood but it was rows and rows of houses. We crank up LJ and start to hit the strip slow....

SUCCESS!!! Kids start running out from there house 3 or 4 at a time, kids riding there bikes as fast as they could to get to the truck (I guess they don't see to many Ice cream trucks in the hood) It kinda made me happy to see all these happy faces waiting for Ice cream, but then I remember what the bottom line of this operation was, to get some Ma fuckin Herion.... So we sell 23 ice cream pops, witch equates to about 35 dollars. That's barely enough to get one of us well. We need at least $60 each to makes this trip worth while and then some gas money to put back in the truck, so at least like, $200.00. Fuck it was getting to look like this was a waist of time and resources...UNTIL my partner in crime Markey saves the day with an Ingenious Junky Idea.

When the kids on the bikes pulled up they all, everyone of them, left there bike at the back of the truck, atleast 15 to 20 bikes piled up last time. Markey's idea was for two of us to keep the little fuckers busy infront of the truck while the other guy opend the back door and throw all the bikes in a drives off! Holy shit, that was a crazy ass idea, but its only getting later so why the fuck not. We go over about 10 blocks to hopefully get all new kids, turn on YEA! OKKKKKKKKKKKK and it starts to look like ground hogs day. Me and Pancho are all fucking with the kids infront of the truck and Marky was humping bikes up into the back of the truck. Mind you these kids are ages 5 to 13 and there is not an adult in sight.... Makes sense. Soon as Marky says go, I jump into the drivers seat, Pancho slams shut the side door, Marky slams the back door and I gun it. That beast goes 0 to 60 in like 29 seconds so for the first couple of seconds I had kids pounding on the side of the truck, I was really beginning to think that they could push the truck over, I was also always the pussy in the group. So I had to keep gunning it thru a red light. As soon as we went thru the red light we all heard !PING! It was a fucking bullet whole thru the back of the truck!!! HOLY FUCK, I have no idea how Pancho explained that to his Parentals.

So there we are in the west side of Baltimore with I think 17 bikes in the back of our frekin' ICE CREAM TRUCK?!?!??!! Now it was time to unload them, but where. I wasnt trying to take them to a pawn shop, they were all in pretty rought condition. Again, Marky had a great Idea. He was pretty close, like he shot this shit with one of the D-boys on the west side, and he knows that they buy there toughts and look outs bikes. His idea was to run over to his corner, and ask if he wants to do a trade. Long story short, we take the bikes over to the East Side, Rose St. to be exact, meet up with a D-boy name Fatz and trade 13 bikes for 20 scramble pills(20 gel caps filled with Raw and quinine). The Quinine apparently give the D a stronger rush but the verdict is still out on that one. Also the scramble pills are really made for shooting, you can sort it but the white fluffy quinine mixed with the raw is really really nasty on the way down.

So there it is, one of the craziest story's of my use out in Body-More Murda-land. Be safe. What are your crazy come up/copping storys?

Live in NJ went out to Cali for 4 months to get clean, came back home and proceeded to go on a 3 week mini-run. Ended up getting into a recovery house in kenzo(yeah I know big improvement over Camden haha). So I've been detoxing myself the last few days so I can pass a drug test. Its crazy how different WD is after only 3 weeks compared to a year run last time. I only needed like 40mg of immodium a day to get through it. I'm happy I stopped before I sold the shit I managed to acquire while in Cali too(tablet, guitar, phone). I ended up oding twice though, which really sucked. Anyway, I just felt like posting this and kind of getting it off my chest. I've been through so many ups and downs over the years, from 3 years clean and about to graduate with a good girl, to losing it all and relapsing a couple years ago.

I wasn't kidding when I said there are lots more where those came from. Also, those Sherman's Headache pills not only contain ""acetanilide"", as Jdemoure pointed out, but on colser inspection of the package they specifically say they do not contain opiates. :( So, looks like it's the ajax for me!

And until it's time, I won't. My question is based on the presumption that we consider ourselves to be 'us' while holding, and I wonder about the creatures we become post-WD. I know a lot of people turn from junk to drink, sometimes to coke in its ubiquity, or maybe invest their addictions in the acceptable;  2 packs and 6+ cups of coffee every day. All come loaded with identity, with personality, just like junk, and I am curious as to what you're like without what universally defines us.

For me, it's always the same. I'm no longer floating freely through streets, at home but removed from it all. I'm just another human being filling my days with the infinite ""somewhere to be"" so constantly that I don't have to deal with these quandaries. Though through my own decisions I have all but run out of ""somewhere to be"". I don't feel like I blend anymore, even though I probably stood out while sickly thin and tired. Now I'm just some creature, catching the eye of everyone I pass, judging every smile and every ounce of happiness in some sick misanthropic fit. I love good coffee when I'm clean.

Not to sound like an ass, but I enjoy reading everybody's trials and tribulations, especially those about strife and struggle.  I think i enjoy those posts because I can relate so well.

Anyway, How many times has someone posted here about losing an &lt;insert opiate of choice&gt; somewhere under the seat of their car, never to be seen again? Happens quite a bit. And it usually is a very painful experience. I am here today to tell you how to remedy such a problem.

I have this super cool secret compartment under my center console thats accessed by popping out my cup holder.  A while back, I stashed a bundle there for transport on a three hour trip.  Halfway through, my girl wanted to do a bag or two.  OK me too!  Pop the trap door and its gone. Cant even feel it.  Disappeared into a void.  FUCK.  I was on my way to move my bro home from college.  All his furniture was three stories up.  That should be  fun sick.  Went to WALMART and ""procure"" screw drivers to disassemble my console to find it.  No dice.  Spent the last hour and half drive texting people in this large college town  looking for a connect.  Again, no dice.  Spent the night there, luckily I dosed pretty heavy before the drive and slept fine.  Moved all his shit out the next day sick as fuck and drove home three hours sick as fuck, also sad.  

Then boom, a revelation: pneumatic power.  I went to my shop at work where we have a nice air compressor.  We have an attachment that you can use to simply spray compressed air: think kinda like a garden hose hand gun trigger thingy but with air instead of water.  I aim it down in there, pull the trigger and the bundle came flying out INSTANTLY.  As you can imagine I was very happy.

This was actually a while ago.  I was cleaning my truck last night and use the same tool to blow all the dirt and dust out of my truck.  Wasn't even looking for anything when a single stamp bag popped out from under my seat: a pleasant surprise to say the least.

I hope this information will help a few people from this community in the future.  Actually, how many of you are going to look for lost treasure right this second?

1367305961.0	1deccj	I overdosed today. There's a strong batch of tar going around Houston	trashcanjunky	33	7	26	" I've had a low level heroin habit for 5 months after I was released from prison 6 months ago. I've managed to hold down a 40 hour a week job, not use when I have custody of my daughter, and in general, be less of a fuck up since before I was in prison. I still thought of myself as an addict, but an addict on a positive trajectory.

Until today.

To preface, when I use these days, I usually score .2 or .3g ($20-$30) and either inject a 20 all at once, or split a 30. Every once in a while, if I've been feeling physical withdrawal symptoms, like today, I'll try to stretch a 20 out to taper a bit before I discontinue use for awhile. The most I've injected all at once in recent memory was .3g,  and while I was very, very high, I was reasonably coherent.

So I've been doing more h than usual in the past week or so, and after being off for about 36 hours I began to get sick I scored .2g for $20 off my connect in SW Houston, split it in half, and cooked up some tar that cooked up very dirtily, with a large amount of dark brown, particulate matter. I pulled about 25 units into my point, and injected it.

I woke up in an ambulance. I could see when they were about to run the narcan into me. This is where I'm happy my physical addiction is pretty mild, I felt so happy, so FUCKING COLD, but so happy when I came out of the high. I immediately started crying my eyes out. My kid's mom came to see me in the hospital. It was sweet of her, more than I deserved. My best friend came to pick me up. He didn't really know how to handle it, didn't really know what to do when his best friend of 20 years wouldn't stop crying. But he was there, and that counts.

Friend dropped off some pot, another friend dropped off 3 mg of Ativan. This is goodbye to opiates for me gentlemen. I've never overdosed in 5 years of injecting heroin. I have an eight year old daughter to look out for, not to mention a family that loves me despite my best efforts to the contrary.

tl;dr Strong batch of dirty looking tar floating around Houston. Try not to use alone (like my dumb ass) and be conservative with your dose."	t5_2r0y3	True

As I was chilling in one of the many famed parks in SF I get a phone call. I answered the private number (I usually ignore those calls) and it was from my pain management office saying I could come pick up my monthly script a week early as my Doc is going out of town! Obviously I am ecstatic at the news and head over to pick up my 120 little yellow homies. I have some blues as well and just 30 minutes ago, I boarded a train from the Bay Area to the Emerald city in Washington. The trip is 24 hours straight through.

1358955362.0	174j8j	So, let's talk about traveling while using for a second. 	middleageddroopyguy	32	3	73	"I used to be a travel agent, and everytime I faced clients who were users, I could always tell because their trips would cut short halfway and or they would get completly fucked up or arrested trying to score in another country. When I spoke to them about it, they always said "" we were absolutely sure we brought enough for the whole trip, but we ran out halfway through"", or ""three days in"". 

I had one specific couple that at least once a year would book a seven day or 14 day vacation, use everything they had in the first 3 or 4 days, have to rebook their flights home, and by the time they hit the home airport, they were so dope sick, they had to have people meet them at the airport with a fix. Of course this never worked our with the timing they wanted &amp; they always had problems trying not to puke going through customs or whatever . Sometimes they would try and score wherever they were , which always ended with them being ripped off, and usually ended with them being assaulted as well. The woman was horribly unpleasant when she was dope sick .

I particularly used to sell a lot of cruises, and used to constantly have to tell people "" if you smoke pot in Jamaica, **dont** try and bring it back on the ship , you're going to find the police there searching everybody, and your going to end up in a Jamaican jail unti, someone comes up with enough money to get you out"".  The dealers sell you a bag, give the high sign to the police, who get you on your eay back in, and will give the remainder of the drugs back to the dealer in exchange for burning you.

And it didn't matter, some idiots would always try and do it and get arrested . I would tell people if for some reason you have illegal drugs with you on the ship, throw it overboard before you hit the port where you get off in Miami or wherever , because the cruisline usually has to give them a few cabins to search before they clear the ship, and if they think you're possessing , they'll give them your cabin. 

Now that it's post 911, and the TSA is putting their hands up people's asses, I pretty much have to have my doctor write a notarized letter so when I go through security with the pills in my carry on, and I get pulled aside, I have the documentation to prove they are required meds. I once had TSA try and tell me it was dangerous material, and I had to check it , which I refused to do, and had to get a supervisor, who actually called the fucking FBI before I was allowed to board with it, which means I always go to the airport 6 hours before my flight . 


What I have had luck with though is going to pharmacies on islands in the Caribbean like Cozumel Mexico and scoring Soma, Xanax, tramadol, some decent pain killers, valium. Recently ships have started to look at the pill bottles you bring back with you from islands, but there are ways to get around that.

Junkies are obsessed with opiates like I am. That's a given. Sharing an addiction with someone can be the ultimate in bonding experiences. It's incredibly intimate and quickly builds trust, tests the relationship in ways not possible in sober relationships, and if you can make it through the hard times with a junkie, your relationship can survive almost anything. 
 On top of that though, they are more willing to engage in the activities I enjoy. All of the non-using men I have dated have been so obsessed with sex that there's hardly any time for anything else. Wanna watch a movie? Too bad, he's too busy feeling you up. The lack of sex drive in junkie boyfriends has been less frustrating and more refreshing for me. I feel like it evens the playing field and fills the gender gap. The differences in sex drive that naturally occurs between men and women seems to be a major issue in relationships.

 I don't worry so much about being used for one thing. If they didn't want you around for your company, you'd know it. The junkie boyfriends that I have had can sit down and talk to you and just hang out for hours without getting distracted and trying to hump your leg. The non-using boyfriends I have had run the risk of basing the entire relationship on sex and physical attraction. Maybe this is a flaw in me. Maybe I think that my only sense of worth is tied up in my body and my ability to fuck, but I feel really appreciated and truly interesting around junkie men. And even though the sex is not highlighted, it still happens and it's awesome. They last indefinitely and since they can't get themselves off, they are solely focused on my pleasure. I certainly don't plan on dating a non-user anytime soon. "	t5_2r0y3	True

When I first started smoking weed, my opiate dealer referred me to one of his friends, who sold weed exclusively. With him, I met many of the friends I have today, some of which I call my best friends. None of them would ever dream about using any other drug, and very misinformed when it came to drugs in general(PCP makes you eat people. WTF). Their ignorance aside, they're very relaxed people who I could tell anything to, or so I thought. After a night of chilling together at my place, I decided to tell a few of my best friends about my opiate use. They fucking went off. They told me that I'm a loser junkie who'll end up homeless with no teeth(Again, wtf). They told me all their misconceptions of opiates(Saying black tar makes your skin turn black) and told me that they would never associate with an addict and told me to leave them alone. They left my place in hurry, acting disgusted with me and acting as if I were a lesser human than them. It's been about a week, and they refuse to answer my texts or calls. Honestly, I'm shocked. How could a few people who were some of the most caring people turn into hateful monsters so fast? I don't know what to do anymore. I've lost my best friends in the world because I chomp some pills a few times a week. I didn't really have any friends before, and I feel so alone.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words. I have now realized that my friends are not friends if they cannot tolerate my opiate use.

Two important issues need to be brought up -

1.  With the latest events unfolding on silk road and my experiences via two different accounts on reddit, I deem it absolutely important that fellow /r/opiates subscribers be made aware of what may be Law Enforcement Officers and Undercover Informants being active in the sub.  Via two different account names, I have been approached and sent private messages from random people asking me to find them substances.  It is obvious this person is either LEO themselves or that they are trying to lure unsuspecting bropiates into committing illegal acts, as an informant.  Please brothers and sisters, be smart, stay safe, and don't trust random people. Your lives and free civilian life may hang in the balance. 



2. There is some rather potent #4 going around the South/South West areas of the country (USA) right now.  It is cut with fentanyl and people are overdosing with what they consider their normal dose.  Fentanyl is 100X stronger than morphine and it will kill you without blinking an eye.

It seems like every person I know that is dealing with opiates is the most unreliable, selfish asshole I have ever met. Not just ""dealers,"" but most of the people I get hookups from ever. 

I've got three main hookups for Roxi 30s, two guys and one gal. One of the guys is a pretty good friend, and he works all the time so I understand why he can't always be on point. However, the other two are seriously selfish assholes. The girl gets to me the most.. She always says she'll be able to get me something and hours will go by with no response or update. Most of the time I'll never be able to get anything from her. Recently she's gotten into banging dillys and I believe she just spends all of her money on that now. She used to go get some blues every day and I'd front her the money and get my stuff about 3 hours later (after she swore it would only take an hour, every time.. I just got used to that.) I know, I know.. Never give money without product, but she never let me down.

The other guy used to be stocked up all the time, but would be hours late no matter what.

I just came into a good supply of 'em, and OF FUCKING COURSE they expect me to be there immediately for them. Drive to their house and deliver, $25 instead of $30, and to be there within 15 minutes.

FUCK THAT I'M DONE BEING THE NICE GUY

Bitch, I'm gonna make your ass drive out to meet me, and then wait in that fucking parking lot for a good 20 minutes at least. Don't expect me to wait on you hand and foot when you don't even have the decency to answer my calls and tell me you can't get anything. Don't blow my fucking phone up at 11am expecting me to drive 30 fucking minutes out to your house. I never used to be like that, but after all the bullshit they've put me through (especially the girl) I'm just not being nice anymore. This shit is ridiculous. I know exactly how it feels to be hurting and have people stringing you along but it's just not worth it to even get rid of mine anymore to make the extra $7.

I almost don't even want to sell fucking any to them. I haven't been able to get any for about two weeks now because of these assholes. Why should I sell mine for $5 less than they will sell them to me? And then run out and be hurting and just have to buy them back? And at a $5 premium at that!!??! We used to have a great system where we all helped each other out when the others couldn't find any. I guess the buddy system has died while the addiction has grown.

1367608346.0	1dmwph	A story of an addict trying to study for finals in college.	Kitayets	33	5	28	"Sitting in my room, sick as a dog, trying to study for my finals. In a haze coming off of smoking 20 roxies the night before, wishing I had just ONE left to bring me out of my sickness. It was the ultimate Catch-22. I felt like such a piece of shit that I couldn't do anything but think about scoring so I could study for my finals. My mind was racing, I knew I was going to fail my classes and time was running out. I wasn't going to go without a fight. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't focus on my textbook. I knew that if I had some medicine in me I would be able to get some work done. I put all of my energy into finding some, and after many hours of laying in bed, staring at the clock, shaking and sweating, I got a phone call and knew relief was coming shortly. It was about time because it felt like a million scarabs were crawling under my skin, pushing against the walls and trying to escape like a bunch of trapped prisoners.

I was too sick to get out of my bed so I had my medicine delivered straight to my room. I crawled out of bed and barely made it to the door. There it was, one little blue pill smaller than a penny, a pill with all the power in the world over me, a pill stronger than anyone and everyone. The mere thought of what was about to happen put some life back into my legs. I carefully stood up and frantically searched for the first piece of foil I could find and a tooter. I was about to be back in my world, the world I loved and was so comfortable in, the world that was quickly crumbling right before my eyes. But at that moment I didn't care. If my world was going down I was going down with it. I took a flame to the perfectly straightened foil and my eyes zoned in on the beautiful pill, sliding down the foil like a teardrop rolling down a cheek. This was my ritual and I loved it as much as getting high itself. I inhaled the dense, blissful smoke of the first hit into my tired lungs and immediately felt as if a thousand pounds were lifted off of my shoulders. Suddenly everything in the world was right again. The pain was gone. Things weren't as bad as they seemed. All my problems seemed to fade under a cover of that thick smoke. ""This is the life"" I thought to myself. With every hit I felt like a part of me was coming back, until I was whole again. Life felt so simple, but deep down I knew I was only fooling myself. I was extremely depressed, but so what, I had what I needed at the moment and I felt okay with myself. Now was not the time to think about my problems, ""I'll deal with those some other time.""

I looked down at the foil and all I saw was a black spot. I tried to scrape one last hit but didn't get much. I finally felt decent enough to study, so I took out my textbook. Finally, now I can study like my life depends on it. I was so determined to pass this class and show my teacher that he was wrong. I read one word and thats when I realized how foolish I was. There was NO WAY in hell I was going to study. Now that I felt pretty good, all I wanted to do was enjoy my high. My mind was already on getting my next fix, so it's not like I could study even if I wanted to. I felt like such a dick because I told myself I was going to study after I got high, but I didn't care, I was too busy feeling good. I was so overwhelmed and torn that I broke down in tears. I didn't want this anymore, but I didn't know how to get out of it. I put myself in this trap, and I didn't even realize it. No one was answering my phone calls. My meds were wearing off and I knew it would be a long, cold, and sad night ahead. I wrapped myself in my blankets, just staring at the ceiling, trying my hardest to fall asleep. Sleep was my light at the end of the tunnel.""What a lucky guy I am"" I sarcastically thought to myself. All I had to look forward to was same pathetic miserable routine the next day. This was not the life I wanted to live, being miserable day after day, living for the short and ever fleeting moments of relief that my pills would bring me.

Edit: Wow, what an overwhelming response. I forgot I made this thread and just logged on. I wrote this story a few months ago and posted it on a different thread but I thought no one read it so I figured I would post it again.

1366895880.0	1d2wqj	First powder in about six months...	CleverWit	37	10	50	"I reached into the breast pocket of my black leather jacket, scooping up five wax paper folds branded with green stampings labeled ""ITouch."" Each fold contained a miniscule amount of fine tan powder with a bitter taste familiar only to those who've walked the line before; myself included. It hadn't taken much to acquire; a couple phone calls and an arrangement to reimburse myself with tonights wasted funds through a mundane transaction tomorrow evening, effectively neutralizing my only reservations and rationalizations on why not to participate in such a purchase.


In the past such an acquisition usually took hours, a lot of waiting and unanswered phone calls; hour long trips to dangerous poverty stricken areas, carrying such a reputation that simply driving through town was enough to warrant what the police described as a ""wandering ticket."" But not this time, no, this time it took something like 12 minutes and a mile drive from my home in what some might consider the ""ghetto"" to the local shopping center just the next town over. And now, back at home, I took a moment to admire the tiny packets now resting atop my dresser.


Warm with anticipation, I exhaled a deep breath and tore open one of the folds, emptying its contents upon a worn Nirvana concert DVD case, The meager pile exhumed from the packet was quickly shaped with an equally decrepit debit card into a neat line, about an inch in length. A straw cut into a third was retrieved from my sock drawer, placed in one nostril as the opposite hands index finger effectively plugged the other. From there it was as simple as a deep breath before taking a step back and lowering myself to the refuge of my bed.


Within several quick moments the effects began to take hold, the nerves in my face and eye sockets apparently converted to perceiving a new threshold of gravity, a heavy yet blissful weight pulling upon my features. A very specific and unique warmth spread along my body, as if my veins now carried along them a very sincere and tingle inducing sense of security. Ascending to my feet, I allowed myself the most satisfied of grimaces as I paused to glance in the mirror on my way out, closing the door behind me.


Returning downstairs to my recliner and 50 inch television, I poured a can of Coke into a glass of ice as I flickered through the channels, relinquishing the remote once I'd found something familiar. After lighting a cigarette I closed my eyes and smiled once more to myself. For good or ill, I knew I was home.

the good fight on this sub. Your stories have entertained, helped, 
and gave me perspective, on what we are all going through, and 
for that I thank you all. Here's a true story that happened to me yesterday.

Okay with that out of the way I would like you to take a journey with me.
Now I've had my times with our DOC and for the most part I've had it under 
control, (I understand I am addicted, and sought out help) within the past few 
months. How have I done this you ask? Simple suboxone. But this isn't a story 
of kicking this is a story of some pretty damn good luck! Unfortunately I have 
not been able to afford my sub script for the past week, and with bupe/nox 
rapidly leaving my system during days 6-7 without anything I was feeling terrible, 
absolutely like shit. I couldn't sleep at all last night knowing that Tuesday I would
be getting paid. So Tuesday morning finally comes after hours in limbo rolling 
around sweating. I get ready as best my sorry ass could, feeling like Bernie, from
the classic Weekend At Bernie's. I come to the decide to treat myself to a high
before I go back on my sub regiment (of course!). I call my dude and everything
is a go, I could not get to the nearest ATM quick enough. Palms sweating, body 
shaking, relief just around the corner in my mind I swipe my card and rapidly hit 
the withdrawal key (yes I see the irony in that button as well) instead of cash the 
dreaded insufficient funds pop up. ""No!"" I think to myself,""this can NOT be happening!""
I am completely defeated, deflated, crushed, ruined, fucked. Damn MLK day pushed 
my direct deposit back a day. I spent the next couple of hours cursing myself in bed. 
Oh and one thing I forget to tell you good people is that I had traffic court at 4 pm, 
just another horrible event to add to the day's list.

Now with our hero in this story, better yet known as myself, thinking and accepting 
the day as a full bust I get ready for court. I notice that I am missing a paper that I
needed for the courts. So I search my car where I thought I put it. Now this is where 
my day turns around. In the pouch behind my driver seat I pull out a piece of paper 
thinking it's that paid ticket I needed. It wasn't bropiates, it most def wasn't. It turns 
out I had stashed a pay check behind there from August (I was working 3 jobs at the time).
This paycheck is for an actually good amount of money to. Instantly I am so happy,
""Victory is in the air!"" I scream as I head to the bank to cash it. Once cashed I head to my 
dude and I tell him I would like 15 bags of the finest ECP, which I usually get for $100. He 
says he's busy (oh no!) but sends one of his little runners to meet me. The process takes 
about 15 minutes to meet with the runner. I hand him the money as he throws the goods 
in my car and takes off. For some reason I feel something was off, and it was. Once I stopped
to inspect the product I see the runner actually gave me 25 bags! 10 freaking bags over! I'm 
not one to try and get over on my connect for a few bags so I gave him a call (I didn't even 
have the runner's number) and tell him that he had given me extra, his response, ""Don't worry 
dude keep it, my mistake."" Words couldn't describe how happy I was, and to top it off this shit 
is fire! I did 2 bags and it floored me, which hasn't happened in years.  So looks like I have a day
or two of nods ahead of me before I go back to my regiment, happy days my friends happy days
indeed! Oh and court got dismissed so it turned into a great day all in all. Thanks for listening bros
I know it was a little on the long side but I tend to get long winded when I am fucked up. So here's 
my first post into our small but awesome community. Happy nods to all!

Use a dremel to grind down the pill into a powder (really the only possible way you can do it).

Add about 100units of dry acetone (99% or better, if you cannot obtain this, dry the highest you can obtain with this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drierite)

Stir vigorously for about 10 mins, then heat the mixture to about 130F in a hot water bath.

Remove and continue to stir the mixture.

Continue these last two until you see most of the pill break down and dissolve into solution.

Filter the solution through filter paper (or coffee filters). Save the product IN the filter, as this is where the oxymorphone is.

If done correctly, the acetone(as anhydrous as possible) will have broken down the three main polymers in the pills, which are all soluble in acetone, and left the oxymorphone (and talc, and a few other binders) intact.

Let the powder from the filter dry out a bit, and it will be snortable as is.

The reason this works, is because the 3 main polymers that are used to make this horrible pill are soluble in acetone (and maybe even IPA, but I am not sure), while oxymorphone is not. This is also why you cannot use wet acetone, as the Oxymorphone will just go into solution with the other shit as it is soluble in water.

This might work without having to first grind down the pill, but will probably just take longer."	t5_2r0y3	True

1317614810.0	kz0rp	Thoughts from a junky.	thoughtsfromajunk	32	5	9	Heroin is a hell of a drug.  It's interesting to me to see how others judge someone when they find out he is junky.  The media has effectively vilified heroin to the point that being classified as a junky is about the same as being diagnosed with a terminal illness.  Is a junky ill? yes. I suppose so.  But using heroin or, his choice to use heroin, is not an indication of him having a death wish or a complete disregard for the value his own life.  Quite to the contrary, I'd be willing to bet that most junkies love being alive.  After all you can not get high when you are dead. Rather, I'd say his choice to use, it is a weighted calculation, that, to the junky, at the moment of all consuming desire, seems a rational choice. After all what would make more sense than doing something that will not only remove considerable physical discomfort, but will also propel him into a state of absolute content. A state that allows him to forget about the person he just robbed or the loved one left waiting on him.  In that initial rush the feeling is so intense it is impossible for him not to sigh with sick indifference to everything around him.  A smile spreads across his face, smug because nothing in the world matters, absolutely nothing can slow him down. All that will of course dissolve and nature, very appropriately, taxes him with a sickness that is as unpleasant as the high was amazing. It is how the universe works.  Everything will eventually balance itself to obtain an equilibrium.  If his desire to use is greater than his desire to quit, there is an imbalance he will rectify.  Maybe for him, his desire to use is so strong that only complete and utter destruction can deliver enough weight on the side of getting clean to cause him to quit. Maybe, his desire to use will always be the dominant force, and he will always use. The problem with kicking dope is that the good that comes of it often takes too long to set in a be appreciated by him.  Before he can appreciated the beauty of sobriety the desire to use overwhelms him and he caves.  More imbalances are created that are most easily counterbalanced by dope.  It's a cycle that sucks.  A cycle I hate being stuck in.  	t5_2r0y3	True

For me, its easy.

It ain't the WDs, the (lack of) money, the anxiety, the limp-dick lack of interest in the opposite sex (or whatever floats your boat on a sunny day), the daily rollercoaster of rage, the social alienation, or the sheer, visceral, madness of it all...

It's easily, by far, being, literally, Full of Shit. 

Now I know no one wants to talk about pooping. Poopy smells, it's taboo, it's hidden behind closed doors... but goddamn I can't imagine a more disgusting feeling than being on a binger, and having a swollen stomach full of poop. And the full implications thereof.

To me, opiates are ""the"" perfect drug. The drug in the movie Limitless. But there is a yin and yang to all of existence. A price must be paid for this inherent loveliness. F=-F and all that. 

I remember backpacking through Cambodia, one of the first times I ever tried Dope. Stuffed &amp; stoned off Happy Pizza (pizza cooked with weed under the cheese) I met a young cambo kid, Rambo, who resided riverside. A tentative transaction, first, led to some good quality opium dragon-tail chasin. Next up, was the holy grail: he delivered what looked to be a solid gram of straight out the Opium Triangle, lovely golden brown heroin. 

Days it must have been .. me and my girl spent at that Fairyland of a hotel, nodding out to some Battlestar Galactica. Don't think we left once, except to order some more Happy Pizza. When all was said and done, and it was time to pack our bags and move on,  we were in a post-heroin-haze, to say the least ... laid out on the bed, moving  little. 6AM: ""KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK."" It's douchebag Karl knocking on our door, ""Time to go temple trekking guys!"" he said in his most enthusiastic, bright eyed bushy tail, never-done-a-drug-in-my-worthless-life voice.

 Sittin on that tuk-tuk (half a motorcycle with a carriage attached to it), dazed and confused ... I could have gave a shit (no pun intended) that we were passing some of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring scenery I'd ever had the pleasure of visually assimilating. [Angkor Wat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat), the Temple City... 8th wonder of the world ... anyway, got to the Golden Gekko hotel in Siam Reep, where most of the temple trekking would take place out of, and I took the biggest shit of my life. Poor Cambodian plumbing had NO fucking chance, a 6'3 shitter backed up for 3 days high on heroin and happiness... instant toilet clogger. Dropped the lid on that sucker and walked out, that's someone elses problem. Right.

Wrong. I alerted the Cambo staff, who smiled and nodded only to find the bunker buster still lodged when we came back that day. Had to switch hotelrooms. 

Honestly, I can deal with most of the shit the lifestyle brings, but not the (lack of) shit itself... its what keeps me a chipper.

Thoughts? Shitty stories to share? 

p.S - DOn't even get me started on toilet paper. The rest of the world uses bidets/bum guns to wash their asses. First thing I did when I came back to the states was install a bum gun. Highly recommended.

Some of the tar I've bought in the past has shattered when pressed on the counter just above. There HAS to be fragments somewhere. At least this was my mindset. I had my face to the filthy linoleum, poking deep in the crevices. I had a small headed screwdriver in hand to push away bug carcasses, food crumbs and god knows what else. Anything and everything that even remotely fit the description made its way into my spoon. As all ingredients chosen were of the brown/black variety (BTH has been my main purchase), the water colored itself correctly and a'cookin I went. I have no fucking clue what just found its way into my veins, but it damn sure wasn't what I was looking for. the story doesn't get any more exciting. The shot didn't make me sick or grow a third nipple (no offense to my tri-tipped brethren), it just filled me with shame. Is this what I've become? Since I've moved back east, I've only geared up via SR. I'm too unfamiliar with the area and clueless these days to the art of finding sources from scratch. SR has been reliable. Expensive, but reliable. I have to leave for a biz trip this weekend, so I intentionally used up my stock a cpl days ago. Leaving enough days to get past dope sick and be able to function. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Hell, maybe it still is. I just can't fathom how something that once upon a time was a well controlled, occasional habit has lead to me searching high and low for anything I can cook into just one more shot. My personal life imploded nearly a year ago now. I refuse to drink as I can't handle the levels it takes my depression to. Dope has been the only thing to take the 'sad' away. Now it's become a component of it. I don't think I have a point, sadly. I just needed to get this out. I'm losing hold and grasp of who I thought I was. It's easy to lie to yourself throughout life. Justify or explain away your mistakes and bad choices and forge ahead in an ignorant bliss. When you're cooking up crumbs and bug shit (just spitballing here) to get just one more hit, there's a reality and a visual now that you can't forget or deny. 
Nothing went how I'd hoped it would. I'm ready to wake up now. I've learned my lesson.

1365479919.0	1byvuh	"DEA decided we are not in ""enough"" pain"	IGuessItsMe	36	6	24	"My story from today, which I am trying to spread and have sent to members of congress, state government and media. It is chilling, if you have ongoing chronic pain. PM me for proof if you want it.

DEA has decided I am not in ""enough"" pain.

Today my wife and I visited 17 different local pharmacies, to refill my prescriptions for pain medication. We will try again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next. I am not optimistic.

Three back surgeries so far, and I face another, possibly two. My life is brutal pain from dawn until twilight. I have seen the same doctors for six years, and have filled these exact prescriptions during that time at the exact same Walgreens and CVS stores. I know and am friendly with the staff. My wife carries a complete copy of my medical records. Documenting every surgery, every needle that's been driven into my spine, every procedure. Today, every single pharmacy was united in their message: Your records no longer matter. The three inch thick pile of records proving I am in severe pain ""no longer counts."" Nor could they tell me what WOULD count, what WOULD make a difference. Because, you see, they do not know either. They were plainly confused and fearful. Most didn't really want to talk about this at all.

Today my pharmacist told me that they would probably never carry any schedule 2 medications again. At Walgreens. At ALL locations. Forever. Just as frightening, he told me he's not supposed to share this. He is only permitted to hand out a prepared statement from corporate that says, ""Due to changing requirements, we will no longer fill your prescription."" No explanation, no method to appeal, nothing more to be done or said. Not even a vague idea provided about how to ""meet"" these nonexistent requirements.

I called Humana, my insurer, about mail order options. They said my medication was covered by the plan but that it ""would be illegal for them to allow me to have it."" I asked for clarification. She repeated the quoted phrase four more times before I gave up. This defies the most basic ideas of common sense. It verges on parody and is offensively absurd. 

DEA has vilified a legitimate and useful medication that has improved my life and the lives of countless others. It is reprehensible, disgusting, and morally wrong. Pharmacy personnel are afraid of violating rules--but no one KNOWS the rules. No one told them. They fear being tossed out of a job or into a jail cell.

I use 150 fifteen mg pills per month. Five per day. DEA regularly trumpets headlines like ""We shut down a pharmacy that distributed nearly 200,000 doses of Oxycodone last year."" I hope you understand that means they served about 1,000 people in my level of pain. In a county with nearly 500,000 people, and in a city the size of the Tampa Bay Area, these numbers seem perfectly reasonable.

I am keenly aware of the illicit trade as well, and am hopeful that it is improving. However, those of us in real pain are being abandoned, left behind in a DEA witch hunt that will only hurt all of us. And seems to have no safety net for those in true need.

When the day comes that I run out of my current medication, and cannot fill my new prescriptions, I have a plan of sorts. I will simply go to the ER and ask to be admitted. Or ask my primary doctor to admit me. I am certain she will, she knows the great efforts I have undergone to get well. Then, I will at least have the pain relief I need. Of course, it will cost taxpayers tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of dollars. Because of medicine that is really worth a couple dozen dollars, at most.

Somehow I doubt this outcome is what anyone envisioned, but it is coming. And I will advise the other chronic pain patients I interact with in person and online forums to do the same. A very large-scale, very expensive, but vital protest. Which also assures us that we will have the pain relief we require.

Please work on a solution. Please help me. Please help us. I have all my records. I am willing and ready to meet with you, to share these records, to tell you my story. I worked for many years in TV/Radio with colleagues and friends in more than 200 major cities from Los Angeles to D.C. and Fairbanks to Miami. I plan to share this with my colleagues at those media outlets. I am hopeful something can be done, but the clock is not only ticking, it is a roaring inferno.

Meanwhile, people in genuine pain suffer. Like me."	t5_2r0y3	True

So, here goes, no holes barred, nothing held back. Hope you kids enjoy it. To fully understand the story, I have to take you back. Back a ways. I was 4. My mom would give me codiene cough syrup because I wasn't a very good sleeper. I remember loving the way it tasted, and that stuff tastes pretty terrible. After that, I had a fairly normal childhood, nothing too interesting went down. Through high school, I always found myself looking to change the way I felt. Drinking, smoking pot, taking some pills here and there, nothing too wild. When I was 17, I got my wisdom teeth taken out. I had a bad reaction, that resulted in a dreadful infection. I went to the doctor, and it was revealed that he used a latex sponge in my mouth(I am allergic). To avoid a lawsuit, and to keep my dad and I happy, he went a little nuts with his perscription pad(my dad is also an addict, and has been breaking himself off from all the pills I've gotten since I can remember). I remember realizing that I liked the way this medicine made me feel. A chill feeling. I could talk to anyone about anything, and have no fear. I used to say ""it makes me super honest"". This was the biggest misconception of my life. Opiates would make me a lot of things, but honest was not one of them. That summer, I also bit a hole through my lip and got in a car wreck, so I had a pretty constant string of opiates coming my way. It was a good summer. I started college the following fall, and without a source, I pretty much put the opiates down. I started dating a guy that I had liked since high school, and things were pretty great. I had an awesome boyfriend, I was loving school. We went to JazzFest, where I stupidly wore a sundress and no sunscreen. I got a horrible sunburn. I felt sick the day after, so I headed to my doctor to see if I could get some cream or something. She sent me home with a perscription for Lortab 5's. The sunburn healed in a week, and I had about 20 pills left over. This was the first time I remember taking opiates solely for the purpose of the way they made me feel. I knew what I was doing, but I figured that hey, I only take them at night, after school, while I'm waiting for my boyfriend to get home. And they DID come from a doctor, how dangerous could they be. I had my first ever blackout from that bottle. I locked my boyfriend out of the bedroom. I woke up the next morning with him asking me why, and I made some excuse. After that bottle ran out, I remember being pretty sad, but I wasn't fiending for more at that exact moment. Through the next few months, my relationship got rocky, he cheated, I forgave. I remember one night, he asked to go out to eat with his ex. I knew what was going to happen, but I didn't want to tell him no, I was terrified he might leave. So, I hit my toe with a hammer, hard, and went to a walk in clinic. 10 Lortab 10's. I was alright with him cheating on me that night. I had the ultimate boyfriend, and he was white and oblong. Over the next few months, things got worse. We fought, he called me lazy, stupid and worthless. But, shit, I didn't deserve any better. I always knew something was wrong with my nose. I had never been able to breathe properly. So, I marched myself to an ENT, got a CT and sure enough, my septum was deviated. Surgery was my best option. Well, hot damn, I was gonna have that!!! I knew I would get some fun drugs. I had that surgery, got about 60 10's, I knew it would last me a little while. It lasted me about a month, I was happy again. Comfort, solace, and happiness, all in these little bottles! Could it get any better? Even though my world was miserable, boyfriend that treated me terrible, full time job that was stressful and tiring PLUS school full time, I had happiness. I had a synthetic little version of heaven I could run to every night. The world could crumble, and I would sit in my bed and nod. I didn't care. Those pills eventually ran out, and I went back to life. This time, I couldn't take it. I was just miserable. One day at work, I decided that this shit needed to stop. I needed some pills. I didn't know any drug dealers, nor did I know how in the world one would become acquainted with one. So, I decided I needed to have surgery. There's something you need to know about me. I'm smart. Would I call myself a genius? No. But, I did my homework. I researched the shit out of appendicitis, and I DIDN'T just run to the emergency room. I called my GP's nurse, telling her I think I had some sort of stomach virus, that it hurt, bad, and that I was running a fever. She asked me to come in for a look see. I waited in that waiting room an HOUR after my appointment was supposed to be. When I was finally called back, I hobbled back there like I was dying. The doctor came in, and I knew when to flinch and what to say. She asked if I still had my appendix. I took a second to give a ""huh?"" look and said yes. She said ""I don't want you to panic, but I'm going to send you downstairs to see one of the surgeons."" ZING! I gave a panicked look and said, ""Okay, are you sure? Should I call my dad?"" She nodded yes and practically ran out of the room. I had her convinced. I knew my job wasn't over yet though. I still needed to convince a surgeon, and my dad. They wheeled me downstairs, and I called my dad. He hopped in the car and headed over. I went into the surgeon's office, he took a look asked me some questions. I knew what to say. He sent me to the hospital, for some fluids and tests. My heart sank. Tests. I knew very well that there was nothing wrong with me. What if I got found out? I was admitted to a room, and getting the IV was probably the worst part of it all. I had a nurse on each arm, tears running down my face. That is honestly the only time I can remember thinking ""Holy shit, Crystal, what the FUCK are you doing?"". They did an ultrasound on my belly and couldn't find anything, so the tech says, in front of both my dad and boyfriend ""It looks like we're going to have to do a transvaginal ultrasound."" She did that, and saw nothing. Shit. At about 9:30, the nurse came in and said, ""Well, surgery's at 10:30, he's taking out your appendix."" I was truly floored. I went in for surgery, and right as they were knocking me out I remember thinking, ""I hope this is all worth it."" When I woke up, my dad was being my dad and taking a nice little video. The next morning, I woke up from a nice morhpine induced sleep, and the nurse asked if I was in pain. I expected a percocet or something. I told her yes(duh, that was the reason I was there, MORE DRUGS). She brings in a syringe to put into my IV, I asked, ""Now what is this you're giving me?"" She said ""Morphine."" I said ""How long will it take to....oh my god."" I don't think I'll ever forget that high. My dad and I goofed around and talked. I was in bliss. The doctor came in to check on me and THIS is the kicker. He says, ""Well, you're appendix was definitely inflamed and needed to come out."" I nodded(haha pun) intently. We left the hospital that day, and get this, the doctor wrote me 60 Lortabs 10's and the pharmacy messed up and put a refill. I knew if they called him, he'd say no, so I filled them both so fast. This was the beginning of the end. Those 120 pills kept me good for about 2 months. After that, things went to shit pretty fast. But, that's for another day. In no way am I ever condoning what I did. What I did was dangerous, and I could have very easily died on that table. It is not something that I would reccomend to anyone. What I did was bad, and I feel bad. "	t5_2r0y3	True

For me two things take the top and it aided me in quiting:

1: A 17 year old bone thin H addicted prostitute and her 40 year old pimp/boyfriend.  He would sell her and give her H in return.  He was a big time dealer of H and G around here.  She was only 17 and had black track marks up and down both arms, you could tell she was already gone.  Living out of hotels and squatting just to get by.  Made my fucking heart hurt.

2: An 18 year old prositute that was pregnant, the father was one of her clients that she didn't know.  Doctors told her that if she quit H the baby could die from withdrawl so she has to keep on using not only to be well, but to keep the baby alive.  She was still working while pregnant and living from motel to motel.

On an unrelated note, it's raining.  Also the last shot I did was a mix of H and G and holy balls I think I went full retard for a good 20 minutes.  I have been clean for a few weeks, I didn't quit for me I quit because I couldn't take seeing my friends and people I knew in horrible situations anymore.

I'm a fucking retard.	dextromethorphansand	34	11	48	"So I got kicked out of my house and left my girlfriend a week ago and basically have just been stealing and doing stupid shit so I can get my two favorite drugs, heroin and coke. And I have been doing a lot of both. I'm getting high almost every hour. 

So this morning I needed my wake up speedball. I walk to burger King (I don't usually hang out in here, my spot has been McDonald's the past week)   and accidentally pour out two or three times my normal dose of coke but think nothing of it, I just want to get high, and I throw in one bag of dope (running low). So I hit and I get the ear ring. It's so intense. Beyond anything I have ever felt. It was almost like nitrous only with a speed high instead of a dissociative high. I wake up twenty minutes later In a puddle of blood and puke. I walk out and ask the lady who is working If I could have a glass if water. I get it and leave like nothing happened. 

10-20 minutes ago I walk back into the same burger King so I can do a small speedball. I get everything ready, it's a normal to smaller dose and I shoot it. 

Fuck. I missed. Lovely, I have 4 fucking bags of dope left and that has to last me till noon tomorrow. Oh but I have plenty of coke... One more small shot won't kill me. Once again I pour out a little too much. Oh well. I hit and stand up, I don't have to puke which is nice but my entire body Is shaking. I walk over to the toilet and boom. I wake up a few minutes later once again in a puddle of blood and puke. 

My ears are still fucking ringing and I'll probably do another fucking speedball when I end up leaving this establishment. I'm sick of this disease. I hate who I'm becoming. And I'll probably be dead in a week at the rate I going.

OpiateStory	27	3	13	"I don't have my phone right now so I just popped in over at my dealers house who happens to be an older lady (50ish but looks a lot worse) and really just a glorified middleman, but she likes me and comes through most of the time.  
  
So I arrived at her house at aroun 12pm and we sat and talked for a bit and she was watching ""Dances with Wolves"" and smoking pot out of a stone pipe. I chilled for a while talking, about a whole lot of nothing because she had indicated that ""her guy"" should be there by 1230 or 1245.  
  
Well, as we all know that deadline came and went and I waited some more as two other pill seekers joined us.  
  
Now for some background: This lady, Sandy, lives in an old rundown house with like 12 cats and almost everyone has either one eye or both eyes missing or somehow infected with... I don't know... disease I guess(so much eye gunk and I always have to kick (not hard you crazy cat lovers) them out of the way because they're mean as fuck.). The bathroom has shit ALL over the basin and just has a couple of big logs chilling in the and the whole house reeks of shit, animal waste, mold, body odor, and cigarette smoke.  
  
At some point in the last two months she started sharing this house with a guy only known as ""Pill Bill"". Obviously, Pill Bill was a low life and stole from her and did other such sheisty thing and was eventually arrested and put in jail.  
  
Okay, so anyway Sandy, these two other pill seekers (some couple), and me were waiting for the pill guy to come as 1:30 rolls around. At this point Sandy had been outside talking to her landlord, paying rent, when Pill Bill's mom rolls up to get his stuff. He was apparently suppose to have it ready to just go because she knew he would be going to jail at any moment.  
  
The mom and Sandy talk outside for a bit and Sandy says she has to go talk to this guy (the pill guy) and tell him she can't go with him (lie). Sandy hobbles over, jumps in this guys truck, and is gone leaving the mom outside not knowing what to do because she had apparently just left and wouldn't answer her phone... So she knocked on the door.  
  
We waited a second and then opened the door and the women told us her story and we haphazardly looked around for a suitcase on wheels, but found known. Right at that second, Sandy comes up the driveway yelling and screaming about how she had told the women to ""not go in [her] house!"" and not that they would go through things later because she didn't want ""none of [her] stuff stolen"". She told her many times to leave.  
  
At this point the poor woman, who has clearly been dealing with a drug addicted son for many, many years began to cry her eyes out and beg us to help her and explain that she didn't want to steal Sandy's stuff, just get her son's.  
  
Well, me and this 40 year old guy could just feel the hurt in this woman and I don't know about him exactly, but it cut me down hard because it made me think of all the shitty things I'd done to my mom or made her endure so I felt I couldn't just stand by and let Sandy treat her like that.  
  
I've known Sandy for a few years and she loves me to death so as the older guy went and started looking for the bag I went to Sandy to convince her that this lady DID NOT want to take ANYTHING that was not her son's property. She just wanted to get his clothes and other belongings and leave and with Sandy's cooperation we could do it in no time.  
  
We quickly rifled through all the piles of clothes and junk to find Pill Bill's stuff and start throwing it in plastic bags.  
  
I have never seen a human being so grateful in person in my entire fucking life. Even typing it now brings back those emotions and makes me a little teary because I could *feel* all the hurt and anguish and sadness as she thanked us profusely for helping her.  
  
We eventually got everything sorted and put in the woman's car and she drove away... I just hope someday she won't have to do things like this ever again. She was such a nice lady because she completely knew why we were all in that house and what went on, but all she cared about was her son."	t5_2r0y3	True

Anyhow, I take a couple rips of some chronic and start driving. All of the sudden it starts getting really cold in my car so I start to think of things that warm me...like say some good #4.

My thought process then turns to bitcoins and moneygrams.

I hear the song, Semi-charmed Kind of Life, by 3EB. It was playing through pandora on my phone. The lyrics, ""I want something else"" kept repeating, and it triggered something in my brain. I wanted something else other than dope and drugs to make me happy. I then decided to not buy a lot of bitcoins and use drugs, for now at-least.

He decided to opt out of the majority of the treatments after being told that there was essentially no way, even with a miracle, that he would survive; he wanted to die at home with his friends and family, not in a hospital bed. Because of the pain, which the doctors told us would probably be regularly an 8 on a scale of 10, Joe was prescribed a plethora of opiate pain killers including 80 mg OxyContin, 30mg IR Oxycodone for breakthrough pain, MS Contin 200mg, Diluadid in solution which he learned to inject himself in the hospital, and the old Opana 30's. He had so many different medications because he had numerous oncologists, pain management docs and GP's frequently by his side. I guess the doctors tend to be pretty lenient with the opiates they prescribe when you're pretty much guaranteed to die. So that's a bit of back story, now onto the good stuff, Joe's final gift.

Today I was cleaning my bathroom when I saw these goofy Family Guy [Pants](http://i.imgur.com/aizkV.jpg), hanging on the hooks on my bathroom door. I took the pants down to wash them, and upon the checking the pockets noticed [something](http://i.imgur.com/hfUlf.jpg) inside them. My heart sort of fluttered and dropped at the same time. I was eager with anticipation because I knew what had to be inside the bag, but the presence of the bag was also a reminder of the shitty pain my friend had been in. Anyways I took the bag out, and this was what was inside, [nod](http://i.imgur.com/eGqr0.jpg). 

While I'm sure Joe is up in the big Opana in the sky, this situation still makes me [sad](http://i.imgur.com/CQyeD.jpg). I know Joe would want all of us to be [happy](http://i.imgur.com/QJNhR.jpg) though. 

TL;DR: I found a butt ton (31) of 30's in my deceased friend's pants. "	t5_2r0y3	True

I've been surprised by how well-spoken many of you are. Its actually kind of debunked a lot of the junkie stereotypes that I didn't realize that I held. But on the other hand, its incredibly shocking to read about the hold that opiates have over many of you. I simply can't fathom ingesting, snorting, drinking, injecting some of the things that you do on a daily basis. From an outsiders perspective, there is literally nothing in my life that I put as much effort and time into as you folks do in the pursuit of your meds. 

I have to say the most disturbing thing about this sub-reddit is the advice and encouragement you give to people who are considering, but have yet to try, opiates. It just seems like such a potentially destructive and expensive addiction that it might be better to encourage potential users not to take it up. Although I suppose that if an individual is determined to try something - they'll likely do it regardless of the advice they get on the internet. 

So, in closing, I'd like to thank you all for the education. I believe that my time here has helped me to be more empathetic to the trials and tribulations of individuals who struggle with addiction and I will endeavour not to unfairly judge people based on the drugs that they choose to take. For what its worth, I'll do my part to continue to advocate for addictions supports within my community (e.g. needle exchange, safe injection sites, etc).

1372917768.0	1hmauk	A story, an attempt to get clean, and my five minutes of fame	jarock_obama	28	4	32	"Ok, so around mid December of last year i found myself in a familiar place, the coatesville veterans hospitals 21 day inpatient rehab. i was attempting to clean up my act, i had been here 3 times and had completed the program twice and had left once. the time i left i was ""suckered"" into it. i came to their detox unit to spend a week detoxing and leave, but while there i was offered suboxone maintenance if i would spend 14 days in the rehab after detoxing. so i went over spent 14 days going to groups and *A meetings. after 14 days the suboxone coordinater tells me I'm not a good canidate. i was gone that night.

So anyway here i am back in rehab, this time i know i need to get in a long term program afterwards not go back to my apartment. Well after a week you sitdown in front of your treatment team and discuss your plans. i sit down and immediately put it on the table that i need to get in one of the 2 on campus programs when i finish rehab. i am shot down, you have to be homeless to get into their programs and even though there is an eviction notice on my door, that isn't good enough. ok, so backup plan, i let my team know i need to get on sub maintenance. BANG shot down again. because of the eviction notice, my housing is not stable enough to be in their maintenance program. So I'm pretty pissed at this point, i bring up another issue, my medication. i put it to them like this my medications are not helping me, in fact they may as well be sugar pills for all the good they are doing me. i explain that all mydiagnoses say that my drug use is due to these mental illnesses that i am dealing with, and if i leave here without an effective medication regimen then my chances of staying clean are very slim. they say i may be able to talk to a psyche dr in 2 weeks. quick math, a week into a 21 day program and you are told you might see a dr in 2 weeks. hmmm so basically I'm not gonna get to see a dr. so i look at this treatment team meeting as them not trying to help me. so i make up my mind that i am leaving, binging for a week or so and hopping on an amtrak to california and ill see what the veterans hospitals out there can do for me. so i leave with another patient. he's from camden but was staying in a shelter before he went to rehab. so we stop in camden grab some D and he grabs his DOC, crack and head to my place in delaware. we get fucked up for 2 days, at some point i buy a amtrak ticket. and he leaves and heads back to the shelter he was staying at. the day after he leaves i get a call from him, he asks me if I'm home, no but i will be in less than an hour, he explains some guys from hbo want to talk, they are doing a documentary on veterans dealing with addiction and are willing to pay just to talk. i kinda don't believe him so i tell him ill give him a call when i get home. 2 hours later he calls, he's outside with this hbo guy. so i think wow maybe this is for real. we get high and talk for 2-3 hours. hbo dude buys dinner and pays me 80 bucks. at the end of the night the hbo guy tells me he really likes my story and would it be ok to bring a film crew and would i be ok talking about my use on camera. I tell him that i am cool with it but like i told him earlier I'm going to cali in 5 days. he says they can probably get the crew down tomorrow or the day after. i tell him cool we talk money and that's that. the next day the film crew comes down me and my rehab buddy talk about combat, drugs, dealing with the veterans healthcare system, and a bunch of everyday shit.  at the end of filming we grab a bite to eat and the hbo dude says he thinks my story is really cool and would it be ok to come on the train and film my journey, i tell him no problem, we talk money and that's that.

the day comes when its time to get on the train. I'm well stocked with enough oxymorphone to last 5 days and 4 bundles of dope. of course i run out of pills in a day and a half. so i go on an adventure to the westside during a layover in chicago. it works out and i have enough to get to cali comfortably. everything goes pretty good, we do little check ins on camera, where we are, how I'm feeling etc. when we get to cali I'm out of dope withdrawals start kicking in. hbo dude films it. he has a rented car at the hotel we are at. i beg him to take me down to skid row to find something. he tells me to stick to the plan and not to make any contacts out there. he's a good dude tries to distract me and promises to get me to the va first thing in the AM. the next morning i head over to the va hospital and am admitted.


I detox at the VA and tbe wds are not bad at all compared to past experiences. time comes to figure out where to go from her. apparently they don't have an inpatient VA dehab out here. they refer me to a rehab ran by salvation army, doesn't sound half bad. until i talk to another patient who just got back from there. he tells me there is a lot of drug use there. the facility is a converted warehouse, and sleeping quarters are cubicled off but he says it is loud at night which is a big problem for me. i have terrible nightmarea and rarely get more than 4 hours of sleep. i express my concerns with staff at the detox and they assure me it'll be ok, give it a try, knowing that beggars cannot be choosers i head over to the program. my first night i spend in the shelter half. the facility has a shelter and a rehab unbeknownest to me. so day 2 i start going to groups. not too bad although i didn't sleep much my first night. I was told hygeine items were provided, they weren't. i didn't. even have a towel. luckily i stole sheets and a blanket from someone's bed. it was very unorganized and no one told me the rules or anything. day 3 i had a drs appt so when i heard the intercom call for anyone going to the va to be outside at 7am i headed outside and rode the bus the 2 houRs to the va. my appt was a simple mental health checkin after leaving the detox. The social worker whom i was speaking with was worried as i apparently looked like i was losing it. so he had me talk to a psyche who wanted to give me klonipin but upon investigation it wasn't allowed at the rehab so he prescribed a high dose gabapentin and penciled me in for the next day. i headed to the pharmacy and picked em up and went to wait for the bus. i get back and hit the last few groups. day 4 again didn't sleep much and the gabapentin doesnt seem to help. around 645 i head out to wait on the bus, but am called back in. i go see what's up. i get bitched at for not seeing some lady to do an intake. no one told me anything about this so she tells me we'll do it now i tell her i gotta take the bus. she tells me i can take a city bus, i ask her for bus tokens, they don't have any so angerily she tells me to go. fast forward to day 5 i again have an appointment this secretary lady again bitches at me, tells me i should have taken care of this before i got there. she asks me about any other appts i tell her about my monday and tuesday appts and she flips. Tells me to pack my stuff. so i do and head back to the VA, they talk to the program director and he says to come back. this is the first communication i see between the program and the VA even though i was assured that they talk to the va ans will make sure i make all appts. whatever. so i head back that evening. i guess fridays are when they party cuz i notive someone shooting up in a stall, and another person smoking crack out back. weekends are dull. i get reprimanded for going to the store to get cigs, you can't go off grounds your first month there, of course no one told me this. monday finally rolls around and the same lady bitches at me again for not doing my intake. i brush her off and head to my appt which is a dental appt. They script me vicodin 5s. my tooth is hurting bad but i make sure to only take them exactly as prescribed. On tuesday i see my friend the intake lady she again bitches at me. i tell her about what i was scripted and she gets pissed, apparently you are not allowed to hold your own meds. i am booted from the program bc i had my scripts in my locker. 

I go to the VA with my bags and they send me to another program which promptly boots me for having dirty urine (you are supposed to detox before going to their program.) at this point I'm fed up. fuck it, i relapse hard, shooting mscontins andw hotel hop for a week before amtraking it back east and staying with a friend until i got back out on my own.


This whole journey sucked. only upside is that the hbo guys, they work for a little company called vice and they recently got a show on hbo. so keep your eyes open for me. i should be in the second season. last time i talked to them asking what was going on with my episode and they were still trying to get someone from the VA to talk on camera about my specific experience. but this has been a long not too eventful post but hopefully anyone who read this will be looking for me."	t5_2r0y3	True

I knew what happened seven seconds later with the needle still in my arm. I couldn't breathe, and I guess that's when everything went dark and I fell to my knees and leaned against the bed and thought, ""fuck, god. I dont think i want to die."" I dont pray, but there arent any atheists in foxholes. Everything went dark too quickly to even try and open a packet of subs. 




The few days following are a blur of sickness and fucking up suboxone dosage/ timing for the first time ever. I was so sick I wished I were dead. Nearly a week later, my body still feels like it's recovering. Sleeping 15 hours a day. Trying to eat something normal.

I have this one ""friend"" who is a full-fledged junkie. He owes me money, and bags. I'm not going after him for the money or bags because honestly the state his body and mind are in right now is punishment enough. 

I'll always text him and it will always be ""I forgot"" or ""I tried to steal books from my mom to sell but she caught me"" or ""I can't find the Suboxone, my mom hid it really well"" or whatever the fuck other bullshit excuse is for why he doesn't have this, that or the other thing. 

But we go through the same dealer. So I picked up from the dealer today and lo and behold, this junkie buddy of mine offered my dealer 2x the normal cost for Xanax, or so the dealer tells me. I guess my buddy is in a jam, because in addition to the heroin &amp; methadone, my buddy has a problem with benzodiazepines. He must be going through benzo withdrawal. Shucks.

Normally, out of the kindness of my heart, I'd throw him a couple for free because he was my friend. Well, he's not my friend anymore. Now, he's a junkie. I've been burned too many times by this lying piece of shit. He thinks he's got everyone fooled, but the only fool is him. 

And me, but not anymore. I guess I'll just have to let him seize in front of me or something. Shame, really. I guess moving on is for the best anyway. The kid reuses the same needle going into the double digits. The kid got his girlfriend into shooting dope when before she was a tar smoker. The girl is probably using him, which is sad and pathetic, but he wants to feel like a big man, so he can have at it. 

I don't know what the point of this post is, really, except that it seems I have less and less friends in the dope game. Now they are just junkies that I know, junkies that used to be my friends or junkies that never were my friends. 

My girlfriend told me a million times these people aren't my friends and she's, once again, right as rain. It's a shame, but what can I do? That's why I like dealers. There's no pretense. Money for product. Period. When it's someone who's supposed to have been a friend that screws you over it, it hurts. 

I take full responsibility for being so fucking goddamned stupid and naive. I have a number of things on this kid that I could do to ruin the rest of his pathetic existence, but I won't. I'll let whatever is supposed to deal with him deal with him.

I can't get a hold of him right now for obvious reasons.

My theory is that he ground pills up, took some of the real H, and then mixed the pill powder with the remaining H. 

My question is- has anyone else ever gotten H that was gelatinous when mixed with water? Or, does anyone know of anything that would cause this? Would pills cause this?

So even if you never share needles or have a single disease, _please_ take the extra ten seconds to dispose of things properly. I'm NOT suggesting that any of you guys would ever do something this inconsiderate or being like ""Oh, all IV drug users have HIV and Hep-C"" and shit like that, because given the harm reduction tips on here and all the posts I've read, people are really careful and I doubt that any of you do. But just for the sheer freak-out factor of not knowing who's it was, whether they were as careful as you guys or not, please just think of other people and don't be this inconsiderate. And if you're around other people who are less-so, please remind them. Or if you're with other users you don't know too well and stuff is left lying around, it's all too easy to have an accident. Most of the time probably inconsequential, but it only takes one. 

Sorry to post this if it's like off-topic or not the right thing to say, but she just called me sobbing and has to wait like six weeks before she'll know if she got anything from it. And she has shitty insurance, shitty parents, and is just barely getting by on her own, so in the rare case that she _did_ get (god forbid) HIV, it's a fucking terrible situation. And given that it's super unlikely that it was the clinic's fault (I mean, even if they _did_ have used needles there which is unlikely, they'd have to dispose of them properly) but just someone who was coming to the clinic, so it's not like she can get any money from them if she needs treatment. 

I tried to reassure her that the odds are pretty damn low of getting HIV or Hep-C even assuming whoever used it _had_ that, but still, that's little reassurance until you know for sure that you _were_ one of the lucky ones. And it's not a good way to start your summer.

So _please, please, please_ cap them, throw them in one of those plastic red bins designated for that purpose if they're available, and if not, even an empty soda can with the top folded over is better than nothing. Don't put others at risk.

I'm a junky, through and through. My DOC is heroin. I've been using drugs since I was 12. I'm 24 now. I'm not even talking about weed or the lighter stuff. Coke, rx shit, etc. Grew up in Brooklyn. Not the worst part of town, but really far from ""good"". Most of my friends I grew up with are the same as me. Career drug addicts and criminals. Product of my environment? Maybe. I like to take responsibility for my actions, so I guess all that is my choice. I started shooting dope four years ago, but out of the last four years, I was able to.get 17 months clean with the help of a program.

So, that's my background. To the here and now.. 

I relapsed last year. I always thought, while clean, that if I relapse, the shame and personal guilt would kill me. Heh, nothing like that happened. I just kept banging dope. At home, at work, everywhere. I'm extremely functional. Most of my friends didn't even know I relapsed. I kept up appearances, did great at work. Just never had any money, because I had a two bundle a day habit. So since February of last year, I've kinda been derpin along, shooting massive amounts of heroin, and basically just getting by, by the skin of my teeth. To those of you who are chipping, I salute you for your responsible use. You achieved what I never could. For me, heroin is a way of life. Everything else is just a distraction. Dunno. Those 17 months of sobriety didn't really do much for me... And that's the longest time I had been clean in more than a decade. Sure, I had money (didn't know what to do with it), and ky parents trusted me more... But, I just wasn't happy. There wasn't any purpose to anything that I did. I discussed it in my groups often, and tries to work on it. I decided to get sober because at the time, my use spiralled out of control, and one day I overdosed at work. Now, I was sober and bored, which is probably the worst thing to someone in recovery. When I started using again, it just wasn't the same. I didn't have the same zeal... Couldn't go hard on it. Something would always hold me back from using with that same intensity. Don't get me wrong, I still blew all my cash on dope, but I subconsciously didn't wanna od, or look like shit... I don't know. Something. Basically, I think I didn't know what to do, and went back to doing what I knew best. A cautionary tale to someone in recovery, perhaps? Probably.

So, derpin along to January... I got tired of this lifestyle. I was living with my parents, forced to move back in with them after rehab. Anyone who's ever had their own place and had to move back in knows what a drag that is. So, I knew I had to get clean and step up my game at work so I could have my own place. Went to detox, got clean for a week, started using again. Rinse and repeat twice. Then I said fuckit. I knew I had to feel the pain, went to upstate new York and kicked my habit (up to  30 bags daily by now) cold turkey. Man, that was rough... Laying there, 90+ hours awake, listening to the cold wind howling outside... Shudder. When I went back to Brooklyn, I broke. Started using again. By this time, I had no job, and couldn't use a lot. Felt like an asshole, cause I just went through that pain, and decided to throw all that away. On the other hand, it was me who picked up the phone and called the man... I know, I'm rambling. Sorry.

At the end of January, I got a ridiculous opportunity for a huge score. Without getting into details, I came up on ten grand. Cash. Grabbed sixty bags and decided that I was gonna do something with my life. Traveled across the north eastern united states. Also figured that this could help me start over, get away from my dealers and ""friends"" in Brooklyn. Wound up running out in Indianapolis. Got sick, and all my well laid plans went out the window. Tried hard to score in town, but I swear to god, that place is square as shit. Wound up getting a gram and a half of tar from SR. Being used to reeally high quality Ny dope, it lasted me two days. I was also burning through money ridiculously quick. I never learned how to budget. To me, money is nothing. All those years of using, I learned how to get by on very little, cause that's all I would have after supporting my habit. So.. it was cold as shit in Indianapolis, and on a whim I decided to go south. Looked on Google maps and decided that I'm going to land in new orleans. So here I am. I managed to secure housing, ten minutes away from the French Quarter. So I got there, sick as shit. Found dope within a half hour of getting off the bus. Thank god for the homeless. It was STUPID expensive, and total shit, so I blew the last of my money, getting high all week long. 

So, here I am. I got no cash, but I found a job. Didn't like that job cause it was too far away, so I found ANOTHER job, within the same week, right in the French Quarter. What recession? Functional, I told ya ;) 

I'm gonna be alright. Surviving is what I do. The problem is, I don't wanna survive, I wanna live comfortably. If I stop shooting dope, I got this motherfucker in the bag, but the problem is... I dunno if I'll be happy doing that. I don't really wanna stop. Bad case of asshole disease, the ol' I want to have my cake and eat the motherfucker too. Anyone else ever been in this situation? Maybe its just time to grow up, bit dammit, I don't wanna :)

If you're still reading this, thanks a lot. I haven't really made friends here yet, and I needed to get this off my chest. I have some cold turkey to go through, but it shouldn't be too bad. 3-5 days of hell, but I'm a big boy, and big boys don't cry right? Also, I'm totally aware that I sounded like a total asshole jerkoff in some places, but I'm not sorry! Honesty is the best policy.

If you can relate, this is the motherfucker to do it in :) thanks."	t5_2r0y3	True

I see this IRL as well as online. This is something rarely, if ever, seen with users of drugs like marijuana, alcohol, or psychedelics. This is very admirable and something I wish more people could see. At our very core, we are still grounded in the reality of our habit. None of us tease or make-fun of someone trying out sobriety, unlike drinkers or smokers. Potheads or trippers are always so brash and outspoken on how harmless their habits are while the rest of the world sees it for what it is. Just another addiction.

1301191837.0	gc9t2	My Kratom advice for those going through withdrawals	DevoretOpiate	27	4	22	"Firstly, for those who don't know, Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) is a legal plant (in most of the world) that contains alkaloids which when consumed bind to opioid receptors in the brain and is thus a great thing to have for opiate withdrawals or for recreational usage. 

There are various types of Kratom, each containing the same alkaloids but in different balances. Depending on the balance of said alkaloids, Kratom can be more of a stimulant with little or no euphoria, or can be more relaxing with decent euphoria. 

The vast majority of people agree that the stimulating kinds of Kratom (i.e Thai, Indonesian, ""Commerical Grade"") are much, much LESS desirable for treating withdrawals and can in fact actually be problematic. Conversely, the more relaxing/euphoric types of Kratom (i.e Bali, Malaysian, Sumatran) are much more effective in treating withdrawal symptoms and feel much more like an actual opiate than the stimulating types. 

Personally, a very good quality Bali Kratom is the absolute best I have used for treating withdrawal symptoms and for taking recreationally. Some people like Maeng Da in this regard, but imo it's a strong half/half effect mix of stimulating and relaxing effects. Bali is the best imo because of it's tendency to be the most relaxing, euphoric and cheap price wise. Green Malaysian is also a great choice. 

Anyways, I figured I'd write this up because I know quite a lot of people personally who absolutely despise the stimulating type Kratom strains for treating withdrawals. This is also the same thing I've read in countless places across the internet. 

As a last note, please don't think that stimulating strains like Thai are worthless, as a lot of people very much enjoy taking Thai for recreational purposes as it can give one a desire to work. It's just not the best choice when it comes to withdrawals and euphoria. I'm hoping that I can save someone the annoyance of deciding to get some Kratom to help themselves out and realize they picked the wrong strain for their purposes. 

**TL;DR**- If you're going through withdrawals or want a more relaxing/euphoric experience from Kratom it's likely you'll be much better off with strains like Bali, Malaysian, Sumatran as opposed to the stimulating strains like Thai and Indonesian. 

**edit:** ""Toss and Wash"" is the best way to take Kratom and it simply means put some Kratom in your mouth and swallow with water or juice. Best thing to do is put the Kratom under your tongue initially and then put some liquid in your mouth and try to swallow all the Kratom at once in one gulp. There is an art to doing this, and it takes some getting used to. Some people gag their first few attempts, it's only natural.

**edit:** Can't believe I forgot to mention this... always try to use Kratom on a COMPLETELY empty stomach (literally nothing in your stomach whatsoever) as it's most effective this way! If you feel nauseous after dosing on an empty stomach, eat lightly until the nausea is eliminated. 

**edit:** If you need to know some good online kratom sellers, please PM me. NEVER ever use iamshaman ever! They have been known to mix in lots of Kratom roots into their powdered Kratom leaf. Fuck that shit.

**edit:** I guess I'll post a couple vendors publicly afterall... **KTBotanicals.com** is truly one of the best sites around (search for ""Kratom"" in their search bar). They have excellent regular green-veined Bali as well as a large variety of other strains and everything is guaranteed high quality. Their extracts are 100% legit as well, which is more than I can say for the majority of other sites. Some people say anything more than 20x is bullshit, but that's very incorrect and dependent on extract process and alkaloid balance. If you try their 50x you'll be impressed. Also, **loveleafgarden.com** which is unfortunately closed temporarily has excellent Kratom (ESPECIALLY their Super-fine Bali and Super Green Malaysian imo). Loveleafgarden has a few links to other sites to use that they can personally vouch for until they get back open and I'd imagine they are good quality being that loveleafgarden is most excellent. IMO, just keep an eye out for when they re-open and use ktbotanicals.com now :)"	t5_2r0y3	True

Well he just told me he became a mod of this sub and this community seems to love the king and consider him a close friend as do I. Well I want to tell you guys a little story about how awesome of a motherfucker this dude really is and how much of a good ass friend he is and I'm proud to say we are irl homies. 

So earlier this year my grandfather passed away. It was a year and a half long battle with cancer, and me and my grandfather have been close since I was born. He asked me to help take care of him and all that after his leg was amputated due to the cancer. Well towards the end of the battle we knew it was coming, but just not how soon it would happen. /u/heroinking knew I was having a pretty rough time with it and made sure to hit me up pretty much everyday and make sure I was doing alright and wanted me to chill with him whenever I could. Well the day I had been dreading for well 6 months (found out the cancer had spread to the lungs, 6months to a year he was given. Six months from that day was my 21 birthday which made me dread it even more. He ended up passing 20 days after my birthday.) 
So my point is, the day that he passed the king made sure we hungout and I went to chill with him straight from the room at the icu. Alls I had I'm pretty sure was like 20 bux, but the king didn't care and as soon as I got there he greeted me with one of the biggest oxybrodone hug (I had been bawling my eyes out like a big bitch), he then hooked me up with a fat ass shot that sent me into a nod. There was nothing that I needed or wanted more in life at that point than to chill with my homie and get high as fuck. He then sends me home, after chillin for a while, with well over half a gram to make sure id be good for atleast a day. Like I said he's just a good ass motherfucker, also one of the most loyal, real dudes out there too. We all need more friends like him.

I have been using again for 3 months and I am miserable.  I am so tired of my day revolving around waiting on the dope man.  I am so so tired of being dope sick.  I am tired of being a loser, which I am.

When I got sober I got some of my friends and all of my family back.  One of my closest friends that I have been friends with since the sixth grade blew me off the other day.  I think it's because he knows I am using again.  This really scared me. I spent a couple days high and reflecting.  I realized that if I keep using I am going to lose everything. Because as an addict I am miserable, unless I just got high I have realized that this lifestyle is not worth losing even one thing on the long list of good things that sobriety gives me.  I am not going to lose this friend.

I would like to think that I could be a chipper, but I know that isn't possible.  I am a low bottom addict and I know that my only way out alive is to get out now.  I have to take advantage of this feeling, build up some courage, and actually put in some work towards being the person I want to be.  I am very far from the person I want to be.  I want to be someone that people enjoy spending time with again.  I have not been that person since I started using years ago.  I am finally ready.

I will not be visiting because for me it's only a way of romancing the drug.  Thank you for all the good times on here.  I mean no disrespect, but it's my time.  I don't want to die and I am tired of being alone.

Thank You Everyone and Good Bye

First I ever had was vicodin and tylonal 3's with codeine. I liked the buzz so much I started buying any pain killers I could find. Within 6 months I had gone from vic's to perc's to morphine and methadone. Then I discovered OxyContin. This was back in 2003 or so before they op'd them and I was getting the 80's for $30. I was doing oxy's daily for about 2 years before I started heroin. I had been around it plenty but it just took a day where my dealer wasn't answering his phone for me to try it. At first I was getting the powder then I found connects on tar. I have been on tar for years now but still do pills occasionally. I was knee deep in the wave of 15's and 30's that hit the east coast. I mean I used them but mostly sold them and smoked tar. Then I started getting Opana's and I think I cried a little the day they OP'd those things. I've done every opiate on the market at this point although Opana's and h are my favorites by far.

He invites me over to his apartment (in one of our nicest neighborhoods I might add) to chill and get high. All is right with the world. 

Yesterday: 8 bags of fire ECP procured downtown- a twenty minute ride away. No more West Side ghetto copping. No more near misses with the po po. My dealer has a corner office and wears Ralph Lauren to work. This is the beginning of something beautiful. 

What's this? Another message? Someone who lives close by wants to chill and compare bags? Well ok! Chilling out on his roof, high as fuck talking about drugs and relationships and life until 3am. I go home happy with a plan to meet up again and do more of the same. 

Today: 85 degrees and sunny, I'm off to the beach with my puppy after a fat shot, iced coffee and a full pack of smokes.

Dope rules **everything** around me.

I found myself outraged in the store today.. I held up a pair of pants, and yelled to my friend ""These mother fuckers want *three* bags for a pair of pants"" !

I've been at this stage of addiction for some time.. by this stage I mean 85% of my income is spent on getting good. Prices of anything and everything go through the junkie conversion in my dome, and come out my mouth measured in bags or buns. I spend any free time I have on the chase.. and I never, ever, have enough to blast in my arm.

My addiction is a full time job. 

And no matter how far down it takes me, how many times it puts me in the gutter.. I still don't change my ways. No matter how many times I have to suffer through that sick - on my knees, begging the sky, that if I can just get through this last time, I'll never use again... the second I have some cash - it's like I don't even know what else there is to do with it beside score !

How many of you are like me ? How many of you feel like you have passed the point of no return, as I do..?

I got love for all of you, in any stage of addiction.. because as long as there is that need for dope/pills etc. it rules at least *some* portion of your life. I'm a slave to the needle - and today it has me a little down. I'm feeling the selfish need to know I'm not the only one ?

I fell in love with the drug. I used any opiates I could get my hands on but it was a rare occurence. For about a month and a half it dried up and I didn't get to snort any pills the whole time. Finally gave in to seeing what heroin was all about. At first it was a once in a while thing, a treat. By the end of the month I had solid connects for tar and #4 and had used for a week and half daily. The first time I copped I snorted as little as I possibly could to test it. Now I was a master at shooting up, staying up til 5 or 6 in the morning taking small shots for the 4th or 5th time that day to experience that warm rush. When I finally fell asleep close to 7 am, I slept. Not until 8:30PM that night did I have the energy to even pick up my phone, to see what I had missed that day. But something was different. Something was off. This wasn't just being tired. My whole body felt drained. By 10PM I was in withdrawal for the first time. Cold sweats, extreme fatigue, and a foggy feeling. I had some H but I was afraid to use it, sickened at what it had done to me

My body ached. I hadn't eaten in 48 hours. My stomach felt full, but nothing came out. I was more tempted to shoot up than I had ever been before. 24 hours after my last shot, after sleeping for 18 of them, I gave in and cut off a small chunk of my rock of #4. I drew up some water and got ready to mix it into the spoon. But at the last second, I changed my mind. I knew that the uncomfortable feeling I was experiencing was nothing compared to the fullblown withdrawals of people who have been using for years. I decided to give my body a break and went to bed.

That was last night. I woke up feeling tired and having no energy. I still hadn't eaten more than a few bites of cereal. I finally mustered up enough energy to get a shot ready,  before I even got out of bed. As soon as that blood leaked into my needle I instantly felt better. I hopped out of bed and invited my friend to smoke some of the amazing Sour D I just got from the Silk Road. I actually have the energy to wake up and get on with my day. And it fucking scares me. I'm going to try not to use any more today. And tomorrow try to get out of bed without it. I can't be high on heroin every day just to feel normal. This is what it's like to become an addict.

First, it’s been a good, twisted, self-destructive run. We all have more in common than we otherwise would. Sadly, it’s time for me to get the fucking move on. I’ve been encapsulated by the opiate womb coma for four years. I owe it to my ~~family~~  myself to see the rest of this decade of my life through with conviction and a strive toward some, any form of clarity and purpose. I will not forget from where I came or the people I befriended along the way. I’ve met a great number of people who I hold in high regard. This is not a dismissal on The Life, this is merely my independent exit from it. I wish you all safety and fruitful pursuits.

My quit date was Nov. 27, 2012. I had been living by myself in NC for a while and had cultivated potent sources and co-users down there along with a growing disregard for safety which caused me to liberally use the Road for more exotic chemicals. I had been using intravenously for the past month or more, can’t really place it. At the end I was my drug dealers’ favorite customer, creditors’ worst nightmare, and all around self-absorbed, righteous dickhead.

It all came to a head over thanksgiving break, I was driving up to NE for the holidays. Usually the ride is a ball buster: on the road at 7 a.m and drive up through Richmond, DC, Maryland, Delaware, NJPike, NYC and Connecticut. If you play your cards right and take minimal stops it can be done in 11 hours. This time around I didn’t hit the road until 1p.m because I wanted to make sure I was stocked: Gram and a half of dope and all the consumables, 250mls of liquid Xanax (.5mgs per drop), THC Jolly Ranchers and a carton of cigarettes. Hit the road running.  I am not proud of this. 

The ride went as usual, through Raleigh up 85 to Richmond—call my connect in the hood there for coke, no dice—don’t even stop for a piss break. At this point I must have started to really feel my own doped outness, I ended up pulling over and getting a hotel in Fredricksburg, Va just shy of DC. Figured I’d throw it on the company card and enjoy myself. Countless shots and drops later, dinner at Hooters next to the hotel where I was a complete zombie I almost passed out. Back in the room was a little video chat with some other bropiates and sleep.  Wakeup call for 9a.m, drop drop, shot, shower, candy, check-out, hit the road. 

I blew through DC by the Pentagon, Capitol Building and everything else with little traffic. Up through Maryland and Delaware, call fellow bropiate in Philly, sure I can take a little detour to the city. Took the 2 hour detour to pick him up, we go and score, fix on top of all I had been doing that day. Shit I’ve got a headache and fever. Drive him home, dose with a couple drops of the Xanax and I’m on my merry way again. By the time I cleared the city and airport the headache had set in. Had I caught cotton fever for the second time in two weeks? Pull off highway before hitting the NJ turnpike, check into a hotel with my own money this time, the bean counters knew I had made one night stop, no need to let them know I had to take two, especially so far off course.

In the hotel room I hooked up the laptop, log in, went on Tinychat to shoot the shit again, showed off my newly acquired dope on top of everything else that was beginning to look quite spent and fix. Did a shot to subside the shivering at this point. Yep, pretty sure it’s the fever. I was able to sleep through it, however, magic.

10 a.m wakeup call, close enough to home, within striking distance. Drop, drop, shot, shower, candy, check-out, and I was back on the open road. Xanax was having a weird effect on me. I had never really fucked with the awful stuff in the past, it seemed to stretch my vocal cords, voice began to have a reverberation even I in my state could hear. Blew through NJ Turnpike with the easy pass mounted on my dash, to be honest I don’t even remember that part. I start moving in and out of remembering. No recollection of passing Newark airport, George Washington Bridge in NYC, or NYC skyline. 

Finally in Ct, almost home up through  Stamford, Bridgeport, Hartford; can finally re-up on cheap bundles and white there, going out tonight boozing, hitting on girls fucked out of our minds, going to be a good night.

Crash.

Didn’t even make it through Greenwich, just shy of Stamford. I rear end a family in the passing lane because I was mixing up a shot in a Gatorade cap. Pullover into the left breakdown lane, WTF. Get out to see they are OK. Their small Jetta’s truck is crumpled and my cars front end is pretty fucked but still drivable. FUCK. Bum the guy a smoke, I’m going nuts making sure their infant in the back seat is OK.
Cops show up. Get the grill down by them, getting all my info together. Cleaning everything in my car up, caps, cottons, needles, two different kinds of dope, coke, Xanax dropper into one of the many bags in my backseat in an incredibly calm manner. Cover up my forearms that are an absolute travesty of track marks. Kind of blank out after that, I was sitting in the driver seat, windows down at rush-hour in the left breakdown lane.

 Cop comes back to the window, “You realize your license is suspended?” Nope. Unpaid ticket, FUCK. “Are you on anything, son?” Fuck, must have seen my DUI from when I was 18. “Nope, officer.” Straight  stare back at him, turn intensity up to a 7. Damn, it always amazed me how unnoticeable to non-users opiate user are. Tow truck pulls up in back, FUCK. 

Now at this point you may be thinking, alright that’s quite a scare, you almost killed a family, if the cop searched your car you were looking at felony possession, if he blood tested or even sobriety tested you it would be instant DUI. Yeah, you would think. Get picked up from a friend at the Stamford train station, luggage and drugs in tow. Wallet lost in the mix-up. Home by 10pm, everyone is asleep thankfully. Safe.

The next couple of days were spent working, grabbin’ dope during work from my plentiful connects. 25$ blues, 45$ bundles, 150$ balls of that white girl, good to be home. One of those days my go-to wasn’t picking up and I was completely out. Brute force through work with a couple bags. Out at 3. Drive down to the hood, usual corners are empty, what the FUCK. Alright, time to be industrious. Park the car, hit the block. The only white dude in a sea of Hispanics and blacks, don’t give a fuck. Everyone has a comment, everyone’s a comedian. End up talking to some Puerto Rican in Spanish, “Que necessitas, hefe?” Bundles. “Vamos.” Follow him around the corner, through some buildings passing a couple of less than savory looking motherfuckers. Up a steel staircase, bang bang, some word in Spanish I couldn’t keep up with. A response from within, Valle. Door swings open, step inside. Four or five big ‘Ricans standing around an otherwise deserted, linoleum floored entryway. A tirade of questions in Spanish, my second language skills are not up to snuff so I just start talking in English. “Two bundles, 20 of coke, what else you got?” Get my shit, for the first time they address me in English, “Make sure you hide that good, pendejo. Bike cops.” Right, start putting in an upper inner pocket. “No, not good enough.” Well alright. Toss my introduction a bag for his trouble, nut the lot. Jesus, where the fuck was I and what kind of calculations had I placed or failed to even register. Notice the dudes I’d just given $120 before bursting back into the stairwell are strapped to the gills, all of them. I am not a smart man.  Walking back to my car I get a text from my previously absent hook, “You good?”

….
Cold turkey. Haven’t taken a break, never mind quit without some subs in over 3 years. The doc at the ER was a surprisingly well humored, I presume gay, polish guy with slim fitting clothes from what looked like Express and a ponytail pulling his hair and face into a tight squint. “I hear someone’s been a naughty boy.” I look up from the hospital bed with my mother and sister at my side. “Can’t argue there, been firing dope into my veins.” He laughs gets on his haunches and begins to break down my options. He somehow convinced my mother, father, sister and even me that I was strong enough to kick at home. “The brain is 100% chemistry. I know hundreds of junkies who have kicked thousands of times. You’ve done it before, you know you can do this.”  Since I had done it before and since I was approaching 24 hours with no outwards signs of withdrawal, probably the Xanax’s long half-life still in my system, I agreed.  I was held in the ER for 5 hours among the cracked out and toothless of Hartford’s strung-out. I left that night with a script for something to take care of stomach issues and Ibuprofen. Fucking cold turkey from a .5 gram/bundle a day IV habit never mind what else I could get on top of that. 11.27.12 
As anyone else in the situation I stocked up with the usual over the counter meds in a fleeting attempt at making the next week bearable, lope, Nyquil, Gatorade, Tylenol pm, more lope, Sudafed and a host of melatonin, and hydroxy-tryptaphan.  Not that any of that could touch the internal torment I went through for the next 8 days. I was stuck in a weird form of purgatory, disgustingly tired without a hope in the world of sleeping, the strength of a man with nothing but bile in his stomach and a central nervous system so fried that normal human function was not possible.
10 days into the detox I still hadn’t slept for more than 5 minutes consecutively, I lost pretty much all of my reserve body fat but was up to a rate of reading more ferocious than during my college days or any time before. Although miserable and disconcerting in process, that lack of mind altering substances, which my mind had not experienced since 15 years of age, a strange clearness opened up.
….

TLDR; I'm done guys, be safe. End rant. 

I obviously cut the story short when I realized I was over 2000 words, if you would like to hear how I came to break down and tell my family everything and the aftermath I will. Probably won't be lurking too much anymore.

What are you going to tell them? Worse yet what if they go and question this guy? There isn't much they would be able to do about it, and if you think he is mad now just wait till he thinks your a rat. If your worried now this will surely make his attitude worse.

I'm not saying that since you do drugs you need to be a gun toting gansta but god damn you need to at least have some street smarts. If your not that kind of person find a dealer more your speed. If your not comfortable around him or his part of town you shouldn't be there.   

Don't call the police unless you sincerely think your going to be harmed, even then I wouldn't but I know that everyone doesn't feel that way. Don't rob him, or try to. Don't pay him off, or say sorry. If your this scared about this you don't have the resolve to rob him. It takes serious balls to beat a guy outta a 100 pack.

A while back I came across this guide of several methods to potentiate an opiate high. I did not write this myself but it really does work well. I reccomend this thread be stickied.....my bad if this has been posted before...



""Hi BLTC!

What's up. Haven't shown my face in quite some time, but I haven't died or anything. Been super fucking busy with work, school, and of course, drugs.

So, my opiate experience is now ridiculous. As some you may remember, I had a ""opiate potentiation formula"" that I thought was pretty damn good.

That was when my opiate use was, TOPS, once a month. Now, I use several times a week, and only to keep my tolerance from rising and to avoid becoming physically dependant do I limit my indulgence.

And, in my opiate-induced generally junk-driven journey's, I have seriously revised my famous formula. Here it is, in all it's new, revamped glory:

That said, to get the ABSOLUTE MOST out of your opiate, try N0 W4RN1NG's patented opioid potentiation formula:

* T-45) 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), a large glass of tonic water (or another source of quinine), and a large glass of (white) Grapefruit juice, preferably from concentrate.
* T-35) 30mg DXM HBr, 4mg CPM, 25mg Benadryl(Diphenhydramine HCl), 330mg Naproxen(Aleve).
* T-20) 2 Tums OR 1.5 Tbsp. of Baking SODA. (Obviously this step only applies if you are eating your opes)
* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opiate\opioid.
* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two. Not more, you don't want to over power it.

In depth explanation:

The Tagamet HB (Cimetidine) is a broad CYP450 inhibitor. This basically means it 'clogs' the enzymes that metabolize opiates\opioids and clear 'em out of the body. Tagamet HB tablets are 200mg each, so the recommended 600mg is 3 tabs. They're OTC, and you can get a box of 50 generic 200mg cimetidine tabs at CVS for like $5.49.

Quinine is an ingredient in tonic water, and functions the same way as Tagamet. It inhibits the CYP450 set, more specifically, CYP2D6. It doesn't 'clog' as many enzymes as Tagamet does, but it STRONGLY 'clogs' CYP2D6, which is the MAIN enzyme for opiates like oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, etc. A large glass of straight tonic water is plenty. I prefer the ""Vintage"" brand. You can buy a liter of tonic water at any grocery for like $2.00.

White grapefruit juice contains three ingredients that clog the CYP450 set. However, it doesn't clog CYP2D6 too well, which is the main one for most opes. It does strongly 'clog' CYP3A4 nicely though, and although that's almost an 'auxillary' enzyme for alot of opiates, it definitely helps out. Again, it's cheap. Go to any grocery store and you should be able to get a nice big bottle of 100% whitre grapefruit juice from concentrate for like $2.50-$3.50.

An important thing to note for the grapefruit juice is the percentage of juice. A lot of companies make ""White grapefruit juice"" that is basically water, corn syrup, and like 10% juice. This is almost a waste of your money. You want it to say 100% juice, and also, you want to make sure it's 100% white grapefruit juice! A very common business practice for juice companies is to create 'juice cocktails'. These are beverages that are MAINLY cheap filler juices like apple and pear, with the advertised fruit only partially accounting for that '100% juice' the bottle sports so vividly. Look in the ingredients list, and make sure the only juice in there is white grapefruit, preferably from concentrate.

Nutritionally, juices from concentrate are usually not as good. However, for one reason or another, grapefruit juice from concentrate can contain 25%-40% MORE naringin, bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin; the three enzyme inhibitors present in white grapefruit.

Now, some of you may be wondering WHY 'clogging' these enzymes is so beneficial. Basically, by slowing or even completely stopping the metabolization of opiates, they last MUCH longer. Also, blood plasma levels of opiates have been shown to vastly higher when the CYP450 set is strongly inhibited; meaning their is a higher peak, and it lasts longer.

It's a win-win situation, trust me. ^_^

On to the other shit. Benadryl(diphenhydramine HCl) and CPM(chlorpheniramine maleate) are both over-the-counter anti-histamines that increase the analgesic and euphoric properties of opiates to some extent. They also help cut down on the ope-itch. In addition, these guys also slightly inhibit subset CYP2D6.

Seeing a pattern here?

DXM (Dextromethorphan HBr, Robitussin, Zicam, etc.[not that it needed an intro on this board]) has a special effect in this formula. Although it doesn't inhibit the CYP450 set to any appreciable extent, it does contribute to analgesia and euphoria for all major opiates. Also, it has been shown to prevent the build up of tolerance! 30mg of DXM a good half hour or so before dosing will definitely slow any tolerance build up if you use this method every time. And with opiates, that's a VERY big deal.

The Naproxen(Aleve) adds to the analgesia and euphoria. Aleve comes in 220mg tabs, so by 330mg I mean one-and-a-half tabs.

The tums\baking soda is only necessary if you're eating the opiates in question. Basically, they lower the PH of the stomach\GI tract [well, technically it raises the PH, but ya know what I mean] which allows more of the opiate to be absorbed into the blood.

It's fine to smoke a little bud, but too much ruins the high IMO. And when I say a little, I mean like .2g, tops. If you have a moster tolerance, titrate accordingly, but if you smoke a few times a week .3 will be perfect.

To further breakdown all this pre-dose potentiation, I'll make it easy for you guys and just tell ya how many pills to take, and the exact way I consume them

* T-45) 3 200mg Cimetidine pills, washed down with a HUGE tonic water\white grapefruit juice cocktail.
* T-35) 1 Coriciden Cough &amp; Cold Low Blood Pressure, 1 Benadryl, and one and a half Aleve.
* T-20) 2 extra strength Tums if I'm popping the opes.
* T-0) Rail\pop those shits.
* T+10) *Smokes a bowl*

The Coriciden has both 30mg of DXM and 4 mg of CPM, so it's good for killin' 2 birds with one stone. No pun intended.

Also, some people are under the impression that all these drugs make the high ""dirty"". They CAN, no doubt about it, but in the dosages I listed, there are *NO* perceived changes in the quality of the high. It really does feel like you took more opiate, minus some itching.

Anyway, that's basically it! Hope I manage to help some of you guys out on your voyages to the land of nod, and if you have any questions, feel free to post.

And if this is too lengthy, it's because I'm yakked out of my skull PLUS 48mg hydromorphone; preloaded, of course, with my all-powerful formula.

...and I'm procrastinating for a paper due tomorrow morning. But that's besides the point. Peace!

N0 W4RN1NG

EDIT: Forgot to mention:

This formula should NOT be used in combination with codeine. Codeine's pleasurable effects are largely dependant on it's metabolization into morphine via CYP450 subsets. This formula basically fucks that shit up the ass. If you're using codeine, just take the DXM.

Also, if you plan on drinking alcohol, nix the Aleve. It can cause some nasty damage to your stomach in combo with alcohol. Same goes for APAP\Tylenol(acetaminophen), so if you're taking opiates with tylenol included (Vicoden, Percoset, Endocet, Tylenol 3, etc) be nice to your liver and don't drink. Liver failure is no picnic, mkay?""

I shot incense at bonaroo back in 2002. My nose was stopped up (I had been snorting OC 80s all day) so I couldn't tell from the smell and it looked like that kind of crumblyish tar, so I thought it was cool to bang. I took the shot and sat back in the tent waiting. Oh and by the way, about 5 mins before I took the shot I ate 5-6 hits of acid. Then, cut to 5-10 mins later and I'm barfing and sweating and my mouth tastes like nag champa. I black out after that and came to is the medical center they had there. While I was laying there with an IV in my arm and my beard filled with barf I started to trip my asshole inside out. The nurse holds up the bag of my ""tar"" and says ""is this what you used?"" and I nodded and she told me it was just incense. The nurse wanted me to go to a hospital but the main dr. guy said I would be ok but to come back if I started feeling bad again. They also gave me naloxone because my gf that gave them the bag of my ""tar"" said it was heroin. So I ended up going into terrible WDs because of the 160mgs of OC I did earlier...while tripping. So since I was feeling like shit I decided to head back to camp and try to relax but on my way back a cop decided to pick me out and fuck with me, probably because I looked like a zombie on account of the vomit now caked into my beard and pupils the size of half dollars. I knew he was going to search me so I quickly ate the remaining 4 hits of acid I had in my pocket so I wouldn't get popped. The cop searched me (I was in a cartoon at this point) and found my dugout with fresh herb in it, I forgot about having the dugout on me but hey, at least it wasn't acid. He wrote some stuff down on a ticket thing and gave it to me. I threw it away and it never came up again, don't even have any warrants. I finally made it back to camp and crawled in my tent and listened to Weird Al and Tom Waits tapes until I felt good enough to pass out. 

**TL;DR** - I injected that Indian poop stick incense thinking it was tar while I was on acid and OC and then got shoved dick first into WDs when a nurse gave me naloxone when someone said I was on heroin and then got searched by a cop while tripping and going through WDs which went better than expected. Also, beard vomit cake.

DownNOut28	25	5	29	"So the other day one of my dudes was really bogged down with life shit and just problems and in a generally bad mood so, much to my surprise when he responds RIGHT away when I hit him up and he's all all happy-go-lucky and tells me to come meet him right away. Not only that, he keeps sending me these jokey texts, which is not out totally of the ordinary on a weekend night or something like that when he's partying but this was like a Tuesday afternoon or something random like that. So I meet him in a parking lot and he doesn't have his normal bindles weighed out, he just gives me my order in one bag he measures out right there. Plus, it looks way different and smells MUCH stronger then the usual stuff. So at this point I'm thinking ""hm, I should err on the side of caution and do a bit less than usual"" so I take a shot and all of a sudden ""FWOOOOSH"", my body starts tingling all over, ears go deaf, vision tunnels, all those ""pleasant"" side-effects that used to only happen in my very early days of shooting when I was going for the mad rush (I have since stopped going for really heavy rushes because it became almost impossible to get ti that level without using too much dope in addition to too many close calls with OD's). 

So not 10 minutes after I do this, i get a text from my dude saying ""oh shit man I forgot, I hadn't gotten home to cut this batch up, be careful you can grab some lactose if you want"". I'm glad I smelled something fishy with his behavior, he was just so much higher than usual and I'm glad I caught that. so be careful out there guys, there might not always be warning signs.

The other mod folk and I, as well as some of our loyal users, /u/peer_pressure-er and /u/heroinking especially, have been noticing lots of sourcing going on, so I wanted to clear this up, once and for all. 

What, exactly, is sourcing?

In short, sourcing is naming your source or looking for a source for illegal, or hell, even legal drugs. 

This INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:

Giving your dealers name. 

Asking for hookups in your city.

NAMING OR REVIEWING SILK ROAD VENDORS. I've seen a lot of this lately. Any posts or comments containing it will be removed. 

Naming the street where you cold copped. 

etc, etc.

We're just trying to keep this subreddit up and running, believe me, I hate being the bad girl, but hey, we all can agree that we love this place, and want to see it here for a long time.

I decided to be honest with the doctor and hope for the best. Since I wasn't going to pass any potential drug test anyway, I thought I'd use one more time as a 'last hurrah'.  Yes I'm an idiot, I know. I fucked up big with that decision. I was nodding out in the living room, my parents saw, and they kicked me out. I didn't even make it to the damn doctor appointment.

I'm at a local bar now, but it closes at 1, and after that I don't know where to go. The last time my parents kicked me out my one good friend let me crash on his couch, but his parents didn't want me staying there anymore and I had to leave.

I tried talking to my parents, but they aren't listening. They have entirely cut me out. I'm really scared guys. I don't know what to do. If anyone here has been homeless before, how did you get through it?"	t5_2r0y3	True

He tells me he wants to try it first before he decides how much he wants to give me but that it will probably only be a half a point because he's a greedy fuck.  shoulda settled on a set amount before i went and scored.  what the fuck ever dude...  i'm sick and i don't go to the ghetto to cop for free.

The whole time this guy is talking a big game.  how he will get a bundle every day if he likes it.  blah blah blah.  this g (ecp, btw) happened to be some fire.  So i just sort of sit down at the computer and browse /r/opiates while i wait on dude to fix and do his shot.  He takes forever to find a vein(did i mention this guy is pretty large?  no?  oh well this guy is about 5'11"" and probably 220-240).  I suck at telling stories sorry.

So i'm sort of half paying attention to him and half looking at the computer because i don't want to be all annoying and hovering over him waiting for my shit like an anxious little kid.  I didn't see how much he had poured into his spoon and i also was not aware that he had been popping blue footballs and vic10s all morning.  At one point, i look across the room at him and my other friend is sort of holding his arms with a worried look on his face.  Right then the dude started to stumble backward towards me.  I jump up like whoa! and sort of catch him/let him down to the ground slowly.  I've been through this before and every time i tell myself i need to get some narcan to keep in my little ""kit"".  but i still haven't.  how do i get narcan exactly?  is it available on SR?

so this guy is laying on my floor.  one of my friends is flipping his shit, my other friend, who is a nurse, was monitoring his breathing and heart rate.  I was honestly just pissed.  There was a huge dude layed out on my floor, and i didn't get my drugs.  I stay about 2 blocks from a hospital so i had freaking out friend back the car into the yard and the three of us all carried his heavy, completely unconscious ass to the back seat of the car.  He was still breathing and had a stable heartbeat.  He reacted slightly to earlobe pinches and sternum taps.  He was mostly just nodded the fuck out, but that is the beginning of the danger zone.  So we safely get him in the car without bumping his head or squishing his feet.

Y'all are gonna think i'm a dick and i'll probably get downvoted but whatever, fuck you, i was sick as a dog.  At this point i reached into his pocket and grabbed the pill bottle he keeps his shit in.  I grabbed out his bag of dope, easily less than half a g now(he had shared with the other two folks, too.  Just not me.)  and poured about about .15 into my own baggy.  then i grabbed a xanax and the blunt he had stashed in the door handle.  I copped for him, then i carried his fat ass to the car and safely sent him off the emergency room.  I deserved that shit.  I gave the pill bottle to the more level-headed of the two friends and asked her to make sure that's not on him when he goes in(DUH, i wouldn't put it past these asshats...).

Moral of the Story:  Don't pop benzos all day then do a giant shot of dope, it's dumb.  Do a test shot at least.  

A question also arises; to cop for idiots or to not cop for idiots.  On one hand they have lots of money that they can blow on drugs and help support my hustle but on the other hand they aren't too sharp.  The nurse is pretty smart, she has done her research and she knew exactly what to do but her boyfriend(a friend of mine since 2nd grade) and this guy that they introduced me to are about dumb as bricks and have very little understand of drugs other than ""they fuck you up"".  They also call and text incessantly when i'm out on a run for them ""are you there yet?  did you get it yet?  Does it look good?  How long til you get back?""  so fucking annoying.  Other times they call me saying they want a hundo bag and i make all the necessary phone calls and get everything set up and they back out at the last minute.  I'm starting to think they are just more trouble than they're worth.  As a matter of fact when dude first hit the floor and nurse friend was checking his vitals, i screamed 

""GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ER AND NEVER EVER FUCKING CALL ME AGAIN DELETE MY NUMBER AND WHEN DUMBFUCK OVER THERE COMES TO TELL HIM TO DELETE MY NUMBER,TOO.""  (we had exchanged numbers)  My hustle partner disagrees.  He says that if they keep spending money like that we can start getting some good hustle action goin.   What do my brops think?

TL;DR- dude did way too much after i copped for him and he told me he'd give me a bag.  I got him safely to the hospital but not before i grabbed a little bit of dope and a pill and a blunt off of him as an EMT/finders fee.  He actually just texted me thanking me for getting him to the hospital and asking for a ride when he gets done up there, offering to ""hook me up"".  that's funny... 

also i'm pretty high on xanax and the dope and smoking half the blunt.  This took me almost 2 hours to write.  noddin pretty hard.  happy birthday /r/opiates!  did i read the post today?"	t5_2r0y3	True

I've been posting and lurking here for years on separate accounts and I've finally hit rock bottom,  I'd show you the last of my dope porn but I sold my phone for junk already so the pictures are all gone.  

But here's the story and if you can relate maybe you can consider getting help too and if not it is what it is,  I know how great getting high I know all the reasons to keep using and some of us can and some of us can't.  I can't.  

Two days ago,  same shit different day, waking up sick and finding a way to get money to get high,  I'm out of valuables they've been gone for years.  But of course I found a way,  escorted my white friend to Newark and kept her safe while we copped got a few bags out of it and shit worked out.  Great times. 

Yesterday: woke up sick,  trying to find a way to get money.  My girlfriend and I are sick as fuck trying to get high tempers are the highest thing in the house. Fighting all day two junkies at each others throats,  ends with us fighting and me the piece of shit that I am throwing a plastic bottle at her not just endangering her but our child that was in her arms.  Ended my day getting bailed out of jail by my best friends dad,  a fucking blessing I never expected. Ended the day sick as fuck but in my house with my girlfriend and shit.  

Today: so god dammed sick,  trying to find money trying to middle man my way to a bag ready to do anything. I tried to sell a piano from my grandma that cost 1200$ but it was too old and worthless.  Still so fucking sick... But I finally decided it's time to get my life on track me and my girl went to NA and we finally have some hope. Things are looking up,  I'm so sick but for the first time in forever I have a slice of hope and I'm so happy that that's another way.  I have no subs or methadone but it's what I need to just ride this one out. Guys this has been a horrible ride but this sub was always a place for fun for me but it's also a trigger. I'm sad to leave but I need to.  I know I'm ranting and this post isn't much but thanks for being there and helping stay safe out there.  I hope the best for all of you,  get noddy get sober,  stay safe. After I answer any comments the /u/Bunkjunkfunk is gone.  But it's been a great ride.

1370896322.0	1g2hjl	Anybody Else Love Their Connect?	sinnerinmyhead	26	6	40	"Back in January a buddy hooked my Wife and I up with this (very young) girl who could get Roxies and the occasional Opana.

Really she wasn't that reliable and I had my concerns about dealing with someone so young. The first time she actually came through, she mentioned that she could also get Boy (what the kids call dope in my area).

At the time the only dope connect we had was in the 'hood. It was powder and the quality varied substantially so it was rare that we bothered getting any and made due with meds.

Ol' girl only got tar and though I hate what it does to our veins, I've never been surprised by tar. It seems to be a pretty consistent quality regardless where in the city you go.

Anyway, that night we got a couple balloons to try. Super easy pickup. Took all of 5 minutes and didn't even have to leave the suburbs. As soon as we got home, we got our gear together that had been collecting dust, and pushed off...

It. Was. Damn. Good.

Early on she didn't have a car or enough money to buy any more than what she could immediately sell. I helped her out whenever I could because she really impressed me with her business and people skills and I knew she was going to become a really good connect. Also I was becoming fond of her. We hung out periodically and actually became friends.
 
Cut to now. She has a car, supporting herself and her own habit and has really moved up the ladder.

She cuts us deals on occasion, never keeps us waiting, stays in contact, will deliver if the Wife or myself can't get to the city and will never let us be sick. There have been two or three occasions where she has driven 30 miles to hook us up with a shot just for throwing her 5 bucks for gas.
I didn't intend to write a novel, but I'm more than a little high since today's score was particularly good.

tl;dr
I have an awesome connect who takes very good care of me. Also, just because someone is young and may seem naive, doesn't mean they won't provide good service."	t5_2r0y3	True

Controlled substance inventory management.  A few months ago. I started snatching up a couple pills here and a couple there. Then I happened upon a bottle of original formula opana ER 30's. That's when I went from recreational use to habitual use of opiates. after that i switched. To oxy 30's the blue ones my  habit started with snorting 2 - 3 pills a day and now my habit. has grown to 12 - 15 pills a day. I can't go on like this. My wife   Has become suspicious. As my behavior is obviously no longer normal.  She sees me nodding and locking myself in the bathroom and refusing to open the door. Not to mention the level at Which I've been taking from work is getting harder and harder and conceal.  I don't know what I'm going to do about next months inventory. It's become obvious to me it's time to quit. In my acquisition of substances I secured a couple boxes of Suboxone. Along with plenty of benzo's. I'm on the verge of losing everything I don't stop today my entire life will be over. 

Tl;dr - My opiate use is about to cost me everything, My wife, my son my job everything. Need to get clean ASAP.


Edit: my wife just went through my phone and found instructions for cwe in my notes app. Aand Has called me out. I told her its research for sharing at work. She's not. Buying that.  And is threatening to leave and take the baby. I've tossed my stash and am hoping for the best.

Edit - she's threatening  to UA my ass.

Edit  - well my wife and i have talked, barely I basically told her yes you're right I've been using drugs stollen from work. And that I am taking the steps needed to get off of them I haven't had any opiates since Sunday morning when I posted this. Just suboxone and adderall  to stay awake because all I want to do is sleep now. Next piece of the puzzle is work. I will be doing an inventory of schedule 2 drugs. I will be cooking the books. And covering my tracks electronically. But if anyone were to look at the physical inventory. They will see a discrepancy. Most of what I stole was from scripts being filled. Yes I am a scumbag I took drugs from those who actually need them. But I can only beat myself up over that so much.

After that ordeal, and not even catching a buzz, I was a annoyed with myself and I don't think I was able to internalize that completely for the whole day. I was a little suspect of what I was doing last night, but there are times when the cravings hit you and it's all too easy and familiar to abandon yourself to autopilot and be a spectator in your own life, watching yourself do these things which aren’t furthering your life, adding to you as a person, or helping anyone.

About mid-afternoon I went to the ER to play-up a fall that never happened on the shoulder I've had three surgeries on for chronic dislocations. I told them I slipped on a patch of ice and felt the humerus shift outwards for a split second and return to position again, and was therefore very apprehensive about the status of it after the ice+ibuprophen standby wasn't cutting it in the way of relieving symptoms.

I had x-rays taken, which was neat to be able to see the relocated coracoid process and the screws implanted, and the doc comes back in talking over care of the 'injury' and said he'd give me some anti-inflamatory's, and hands me a script for naproxen. I thanked him and asked him if he wouldn't mind writing me a script for something a little stronger as I know that sleeping is going to be hell for the next few nights. He's game.

Much to my lamenting he came back with a second prescription for tramadol as I have a codeine and morphine allergy and he wants to stick to synthetics. Fuck. Think fast, Mimos. You know you can't be too pushy or he'll shut down faster than faster than a bar at last call, but you sure as hell don't want to leave with tramadol. I play half-dumb.

""Tramadol? Is that what Ultracet is?""

""Yes, but Ultracet has acetominophen in it, as well.""

""Oh, that stuff makes me nauseous like no other. Do you have any other ideas?""

""Well, because of the morphine/codeine allergy I didn't want to do any derivatives of them. I mean, norco or percocet are the only other options, really and they're both codeine-derivatives.""

""That's what they always gave me after surgery, I don't really have any issues with them.""

""Okay, I'll go write that up for you.""

""Thanks, Doc.""

Now I have the script for 15, 5/325's hydro and there are no 24hr pharmacies open on the route to my gf's house. I'm frantically googling every pharmacy I can within reasonable-distance, drive by three pharmacies, two mostly en-route and one, 15 minutes out of the way. All closed. Well, fuck me! You put off going over there because you were still pissed off at yourself for being an idiot last night with no benefit, and now you’re over an hour late and you still didn’t get anywhere.

That really made me feel like the asshole I know I can be sometimes and which I try SO HARD to keep anyone else from ever glimpsing. I'm running around to do all this shit, late for my gf's house. And I can't even fill the script. You're a dick, Mimos. You don’t deserve her if you’re going to be doing this kind of nonsense, still. She’s better than that. Hell, you don’t even deserve yourself, considering who you were, how you wrecked that, then painfully crawled out of that hole you dug for yourself.

So I spend the evening over there, come home, hit up the pharmacy right by my house and here I am. 15 down and the buzz isn’t worth it. Hardly feel anything other than slightly-shifted, pre-euphoric and with an inexplicably itchy nose that only serves to berate me for all this effort with its ironic presence.
I put in all that energy, on many different levels, to do that for fifteen fucking hydro's. If I put that same energy into other areas of my life, I wouldn't be living with my parents four years after having to move back in with them. I'm definitely better than when I moved out here. Off the junk. Quit FedEx, too. (You have no idea the amount of pharmaceuticals moving through that place.) Clean except for once in a great while when I do something foolish. (Like selling hydromorphone on the side, telling myself I can just play middleman once a month and not touch it.) But I'm still here. Because of tonight. I'm still here.
I can't believe how stupid it all is.

If I don't stop fucking around, this very moment, I'm going to lose some things I truly cherish and love because I'm refusing to stop being a selfish prick, and continuing to wallow in the transiently-blissful, apathy of opiates. I have two choices: I can either grow the fuck up or I can continue to slip back down that slope of Teflon and waterslides that I Sisyphus’d for too long before forcefully digging in my nails and painstakingly crawling to the top of that ride with bloody fingers to show for my determined effort to the top.

The view from there is the only one I want, anymore. There’s nothing good to look at halfway down and even less from the bottom.

I have always sniffed it.  I do not IV and I have never tried smoking it.  Today I have a very small amount and I am wondering which way I will get the most out of my dope.  Will I get more out of the small amount of dope by sticking to sniffing it or if I smoke it off of some foil?  Is the high that comes with smoking it the same as sniffing it?	t5_2r0y3	True

Last year, he got dope for a girl who overdosed and died. For those who don't know, there is a law called the Len Bias Law. It allows the state to charge whoever sold the dead person drugs with reckless homicide.





http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/131596013.html





He got a total of 13 years. 6 years in prison, 7 years on extended supervision. A friend of mine's wife was in a similar situation, also charged with reckless homicide via the Len Bias Law. She received 3 years in prison, 7 on extended supervision.

I was in a really bad car reck last year which left me with one ruptured disc and 2 herniated disc. I just had my 3rd major back surgery in a 5 month period. Each time I left the hospital after my surgeries the strongest pain medication my doctor would give me is hydrocodene 10mg 325mg which I was prescribed to take one every 4 hours. I have been on these for at least a year now and have built up a huge tolerance to them. It usually take 7 minimum to even get a decent amount of relief. In-between my 2nd and third surgery I was in a lot of pain and asked if I could be put on anything stronger and all I was prescribed was ultracet and phenergan which did shit besides make me sleepy as hell. Finally I asked him to give me something stronger for when I went home from the hospital after the last surgery. He prescribed me oxycodone (percocet) 10mg 325mg to take once every 6 hours. I feel like even with this I'm still getting screwed because they are a little stronger but with the less frequent dosage
And small amount he prescribed (40) that I might as well just stick to high dosages of hydrocodone. I see people here that get prescribed way stronger pain meeds than what I have right now and I could almost guaranty my pain is at the very least equal to theirs. What's going on here? Am I doing or saying something wrong? Is this normal for doctors to do? I feel like I'm being strung a long here, like they have the ability to make
The pain go away but wont do it.  However, when it comes to recommending surgery they are so eager to convince me to have it, saying that this will be the last surgery and it will be the magic bullet to fix all my back problema. I'm sorry if this is coming off as a rant or something of that nature, I'm just losing hope that I'll be pain free for just one day sometime in my lifetime."	t5_2r0y3	True

I help them out when I can since they don't have a car and they would give me good deals and such. So fast forward to two weeks ago, in the week or so before that I hadn't bought much but they kept calling for rides to re-up and each time they were throwing me like .2-.3 for a 15 min ride. Enter one of my good friends that had also hit them up a few times. While he was giving the guy a ride to grab some food he starts telling my friend how he has been getting rides from me more often because I haven't been buying as often and he wanted to make sure I kept using so that I would get addicted and become a consistent customer. Seriously, what the fuck! Like they know full and well that heroin has controls and has somewhat ruined their life. They whine about and make jokes about that fact quite a lot.

1371226123.0	1gcfiy	Life is a mean bitch	obviouslyafakery	24	4	7	"This is really just an outpouring of emotional pain I have no other outlet for. My little brother would have been turning 21 this Sunday, Father's Day. I remember *my* 21st birthday, not so long ago, when we sat on the curb at our grandparent's house where he was staying. I'd lost my ID the same day, so no bars for me, but we shared a joint and a tallboy there on the curb and talked about the future. Blew smoke at the stars. We'd gone inside later to shoot tequila with our Dad around the same table we'd decorated Easter eggs at as kids. It wasn't much, but it was everything I'd wanted. He was already doing heroin then, had already tried to die by eating pills, but I was the sister who had run away at seventeen. No one told me anything. Not then, not until it was too late.

He's been dead almost two years now, dead before he was even out of his teens. And while I know the socially acceptable mourning period has long past- I dread the summer anniversary, I dread to dream, I dread each day I wake. 

My life hasn't been easy. I was molested by a neighbor when I was four, and again by my stepfather at thirteen. My parents waged a bitter war against each other, so much so that private investigators hired by my dad followed my mother, brother, and I everywhere. My mother recorded all the conversations we had with our dad. I was called into court to testify at their divorce hearings, each one begging me to tell the judge how awful the other was. They were both awful. But how do you say that to a stern-faced judge at ten years old? I started doing meth stolen from my dad at fourteen, sent away to boarding school at fifteen. When I got kicked out of boarding school after junior year- I knew it was go back to live with my drunk mom, or get the fuck out. I got the fuck out. 

I hitchhiked to the west coast, no easy feat from Georgia, and nearly killed myself partying for a few years. I'd always thought things would be so much better when I was an adult, at least if I was miserable it would be as a result of my *own* actions. I looked around my life and I knew that it was what I had made it. I wanted better, I wanted to feel better. So I moved away again, said, I want to be a good person, and surely now life will yield a little joy to me.

And it did, I built a good life with hard work and honesty. I was happier than I can ever remember being, more stable. I felt like I had finally beat the darkness, surely now life could not be so cruel as to break me down again. But he was still dying back in our parents house, the little brother I left. The little brother I got hooked on meth, which lead to pills, which lead to heroin, which lead to death. The only one who knew my life, knew what it was *really* like inside that suburban box house that looked like a middle-class dream. The only family I really loved.

When he died I did not know it, but I know now, I am truly broken. I have not the strength anymore to be that happy person, knowing a heart can never be mended surely. I have a friend who says that without sadness we cannot love the light, but I hate the light, I hate the false illusion. 

I hate my empty shell, and the way I can no longer give my SO what he needs to feel satisfied. He deserves that happy girl he fell for five years ago, and the happy life we had. He has waited patiently beside me for two years, now, for a laugh that's not coming back. We'd planned a family, before- how can I give love I don't have to some small child who deserves better?

These days the only thing that makes me happy is heroin, happy and shamefully sad at the symmetry of indulging in a drug that most likely helped speed the downfall of the person I mourn still. But it smooths the pain away, without the pitying stare or sardonic condolences. It does not judge and I do not disappoint with a frown. 

I am sorry for the wall of text, anonymous friends, and while I haven't posted here much, know that the existence of this sub has helped me feel not so alone in the universe. But I could use someone to talk. I could use a true friend who knows how I feel.

Honestly most if not all the junkies I have known in my life (including myself) have a certain set of experiences in common. We all start by chipping, a few times a week whether we pop em or snort em. Sooner or later it becomes everyday (though we are still unaware of our problem). Rarely does someone start by shooting up, but 99% of the time that's where people end up, I know I promised myself no needles for the first 8 years of my habit. It's always a downward cycle with this addiction, there's no such thing as enough money or time to sustain it and a normal life. Eventually on this path you will lose everything, not just material possessions but feelings, morals, and friends. In fact you will find yourself empty of all but the chase, the chase to feel ""normal"" by putting more opiates in your system. You wont realize how far from normal you actually are. You will lie, cheat, steal, anything to fund your next dose to avoid feeling the pain of withdrawal. I know I cannot change your path, you must decide that for yourself. I'm just trying to post a warning. As someone who is on that long road to stay sober and has experienced everything that opiates have to offer. I must say choosing to have a life that doesn't revolve around shooting dope still doesn't feel normal to me even though I feel better. After you have gone to the wall coming back is a life long process and it's hard, you're much better off trying to quit before you lose your emotions and the drive to do... well anything but heroin. It's a long hard road and subo/methadone aren't solutions just harm reduction. All they ever do is prolong the addiction, the feelings of worthlessness. Treatment centers and methadone clinics all have under a 5% efficacy. It's a bleak outlook for those that go too far too long. I have spent over a year working my way off... I have to end this wall of txt, I could go on and on even though I know it won't have any effect. Best of luck to everyone who reads this I hope that you don't think you're smarter or better than I, because if you're doing opiates believe me you're not.

Edit: Obviously this wont hold true for everyone, but in all my usage I have only met one person that was able to chip and not get hooked. Yes, I fucked up. No, that doesn't give me any right to preach. I wasn't trying to, honestly just had some thoughts I wanted to get out and if you don't want to read them then don't.

ThisPersonIsOnDrugs	26	5	30	"its 10:50 in the morning, I look over at my hands and notice their stillness, no quivers, no shakes, no twitches. My hands have always been my indicator for me, when I first feel the high coming on I usually feel it in my fingertips first, spreading through my arms, caressing itself through my shoulders, and finally slithering to my back. Then I can feel it; the eternal bliss, the sudden chill you get when you can feel it coursing through your body, the aches and pains from last night, from last week, shit, the pain from my whole life...its gone... a couple pills later and its all gone.


Why can't i feel like this all the time, do some people feel like this all the time? is it even possible to feel this good without these drugs. I begin to think that sooner or later the only happiness in my life will come from powders, pills, prescriptions, and pussy (not that im even getting any in the moment)..........""Fuck, im late to class""


I stumble from the warm safe haven of my bed and crawl to the floor like that of a slug on its deathbed. In this moment I have the same thought that has reoccurred to me ever since I took down these compounds for the first time ""If I could, I would sit here in this exact state of feeling, this exact state of emotion, and this exact state of life until the day I die....and i would be happy"" But the thing that trips me up the most is that EVERYTHING, and let me repeat *EVERYTHING* is ok when I can feel it starting in my fingertips. 


My childhood of not seeing my parents, my mom smoking crack, and being an alcoholic her whole life, all those years of being fucked with in school for being the fat kid that would go nowhere in life, all these scars on my wrists from the countless times I used to cut myself and wanted to see how deep the vein was, hoping I would accidentally nick it and end my sorry life, all those years spent in psychiatrist offices ""You suffer from what we call severe depression, ADHD, social anxiety, and in other words you are fucked up"", all those years of being a kid and locking myself in my room to just cry for hours......none of that matters anymore. I begin to feel it in my fingertips.

But is this how my life was supposed to be, was I supposed to cut too deep, am I still supposed to be depressed, should I not be the first person in my family to go to college. Am I cheating myself for the better or worse. Is that feeling in my fingertips saving my life or simply prolonging my imminent fall into my own demise. It is crawling up my arms


its now 11:30....I take another pill. I say to myself ""it doesnt matter anyway, because if I died at this moment, I would be happy, all the pain is gone""

I found a post in all time top and it was a warning to young users because this shit turns on you real quick. So, tonight I thought I should introduce myself to this loving community. I am a 17 year old girl in rural Pennsylvania. Heroin is an epidemic here. Everyone does it. Walking through school all you here about is making trips into the city to get a bun or 2. here we call my highschool heroin high. The first time I got high I was 13 and it was taking tokes off a zong. I fucking loved it. Any anxiety, self-consciousness and fears went away and all was right. I picture it in my head today as my ""I have arrived"" moment equipped with a full band and balloons, and confetti. I knew that that was where I was supposed to be. I always hung out with an older crowd and my using quickly progressed within a few months. I started doing pills. And i was overwhelmingly happy. Opana, Percocet, Morphine, and Oxys became a way of life. One day my boyfriend had dope. I didn't know what this was, and was very confused because i thought dope was weed, and this sure didn't look like weed. However, he cant be blamed because I didn't ask questions. I was just along for the ride and i was truly in love with drugs so i knew whatever it was i would probably like it. I had gotten to the point where i'd pick up anything to get the next high. (pills, DMT, shrooms, inhalents, X, or spec. K) He knew I didn't really like uppers so he told me I would love it. I did it and it was the most amazing thing. I've tried  to explain the beauty of it to nonusers and did it no justice. I was 15 the first time i did heroin. Now 2 years later I am a junkie. I've managed to pull together 6 months through drug counseling (IOP), rehab (beginning of my senior year i spent 2 months), NA, and AA(NA is weak where i live so most addicts have to go to both.) I tried to kill myself a few months ago because I got so depressed (psychiatrist called it acute post withdrawal) and in my head i figured if i can't use heroin then there's no point in continuing my journey in this world.  I've never loved something so much in my life. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Sometimes i swear i think i can taste it in the back of my throat after smoking a newport and it drives me crazy. Coming home to a crying mother and step dad, friends overdosing all around me, and withdrawal were not enough to keep me sober. To this day it still creeps into my brain on a daily basis.

I'm absolutely terrified. I'm sitting on the porch of my central Florida home, watching the sun rise in flip flops &amp; a tank top nodding in and out in my last attempt to hold on to the warm center of my very little world. I haven't posted in here much but I wanted, no needed to share this moment with someone and here just felt right. I'm going to work and save money in the recently developed oil town of North Dakota; or at least that's the line I'm feeding all my friends &amp; family who look at my like I just ate my own face off when I mention moving to the middle of nowhere with temperatures of 19 degrees. Only I know that I can no longer continue on the way that I am. I have two great jobs &amp; seem pretty together but I know that I only wake up everyday with a smile on &amp; go to work to obtain money to feed my ever growing hunger for pharmaceutical drugs. I never see a chance of ever becoming anything but a functioning addict if I stay here and continue on this way. I bought my plane ticket 12 days ago, and here still a mere 5 hours before I board a plane and change the course of my entire life, it hasn't felt real. I don't think it will be real until I wake up tomorrow morning freezing my ass off without even one shot to get my day going. I'm doing the right thing though, right? My apologizes for this ramble but again I needed to get these emotions out &amp; this seemed like the best place to do so, thank you for the read.	t5_2r0y3	True
1361294824.0	18tsnx	Doctor didnt come see me; Instead, he sent his PA in to take the abuse.	t0kensm0ke	23	5	67	"So heres the nutshell youve all read once or twice before however its finalized and no other errors involved, including whys and what the fucks from the clinic.


&lt;.....finally, the PA comes in and sits down to talk to me. I see youre not sleeping well, and your mobility is extremely poor. You've doubled up on your medications, tested positive for hydrocodone twice, and you showed up once with absolutely nothing in your system. What can i do for you.

First of all, i told them each time that i would test positive for hydrocodone. My wife tossed me a few when i needed it. Second, i showed up with nothing in it because they moved me from 60mg a day to 20mg a day, and i wasnt having that so i took my normal 60mg a day and ran out in the first week like 3 days early.(40 count, 5mg, 4x day(was taking 3 per dose time so 12x pills/day).)

""Back the mack truck up for a second here...you guys are the cause for this shit. Albeit by my own doing that those results came back, however, by your actions of undermedicating you've forced me into a position that im unwilling to back down from.""

how, might you ask?

* I was on 15mg x4/day for 7 months prior to entering their care.

* They immediately cut me down from 15mg x4/day to 5mg x4 day. Im hoping you all realize the fail written all over this move.

* Realizing this didnt work, they moved me up to 7.5/325mg 4x/day

* I cannot take the apap. Ive had acute renal failure(body doesnt process it well. I can take it, just not extended like this). He tells me its processed through the liver. Fuck me right? It must be their medical history and their body. This was explicity said to them, and its nowhere in my record there.

* My upper back hurts so bad, i cant breathe at times. I call them for recommendation, they dont call back for 32 hours. Told them i took an extra pill for 4 doses. Got mad and told me not to, didnt bother to ask how i was doing. This wasnt in their records either.

* Next, they decide to put me on mscontin 30mg. Fuck, this is worse than the 7.5's. No pain relief what-so-ever. Double em up, 60mg 2x/day. fuck yea. Im dancing with my kids and throwin em around enjoying my life the way i was meant to.

* go in for follow up with a chip on my shoulder about this place already. tell them i doubled up on the meds because they suck dick and i want out of my contract so i can get somewhere with competent doctors who understand pain management and arent afraid of the DEA. Write me a referral.

* so they write me one detailing all the bad shit from my record there, but neglect to write in their infractions.

* Ive been to the ER about 10 times in 4 months because i cant get on top of my pain without taking double my dosage. No longer able to be treated at ER for my back. 

To top it off i wasnt given anything to jump off this shit with so i had to endure the wonderful wd's again. thats twice since ive been here, and ive never had that before in 4 years.

This facility has effectively destroyed my medical history for any future pain management doctor i may come in contact with in the next few years. If theyd have just kept me on the same fucking medications i came in with, everything wouldve been fine and half of this shit avoided 100%. Theyve reduced the quality of my life by 85-90%. The last week ive been bed ridden for 5 days and slept most of that time away. Ive missed work and school not to mention the time spent with my kids, wife, etc.

Fuck the east coast. This place is fucking garbage. Never had these problems out west.

* ive also pissed myself twice since i moved here because of a pinched nerve in my low back, reinjured my upper spine 3x since june, and when i asked for an mri they told me wait another 6 months because nothing significant has changed. *I FUCKING PISSED MY PANTS DUDE.

ShivaHVishnu	24	5	21	"almost daily i see posts from people who are suffering through the sickness of withdrawals. i can totally relate. when i had a daily habit i really wish someone would have told me what i am about to tell you. i'm sure many here already know this, but clearly many do not, so...

here is what you need. cimetidine or generic tagamet. can be bought at any drugstore. white grapefruit juice, available at most grocery stores. loperimide, or generic immodium. walmart sells 2 bottles of 72 2mg pills for under 10 bucks. take 1000mg of cimetidine and drink 12 oz. of the juice. these 2 items inhibit cytochrome enzymes responsible for first pass metabolism of many drugs. taking these will allow more of the drug to be absorbed into your bloodstream, and at high enough doses lope WILL pass the blood brain barrier.
45 minutes or so after taking the cimetidine and juice, take anywhere from 35 to 70 of the 2mg lopes, depending on your tolerance. this absolutely will lessen your withdrawals if not relieve them entirely. lope seems to have a half-life similar to methadone, so a single dose will last 24 hrs. often it lasts me 48 before i feel like i need to dose again. you will get some wicked constipation, so definitely get yourself some laxative and use it as needed. on the plus side, you will save money on toilet paper.
this has absolutely worked for me and everyone else i know who has tried it. the lope will work unpotentiated for little jobs, but for a decent habit potentiating the lope is a must.
the more people who know about this, the more suffering can be avoided. happy highs, all."	t5_2r0y3	True

1350431333.0	11ll6x	Need helping making a serious decision	misskrisbliss	19	1	51	"I don't think I've ever been so torn in my life. Here's the scenario, if you need more information feel free to ask me.

My husband and I have been using h for approx. a year (only smoking, neither of us has ever tried IV). We had intermittently used various pills for several years before that, but not on a regular basis. For the first half of this year, we were probably using between a half gram and a gram of black per day, an amount we were concerned about and, frankly, ashamed of. It had escalated quickly as is often the case when sales come into the picture. Fast forward a few months, selling is no longer involved because of the huge negative impact it had on our life (not only usage-wise, but because of the incessant calls from buyers, stress resulting from money problems, constant fear of getting caught up, etc) and we did a pretty good job of reducing our daily usage, perhaps to a .4/.5 each per day. For the last month we've been diligently tapering off in an effort to finally kick the habit completely; we can't afford it at all now that the sales days are long behind us and as newlyweds we cannot justify pouring our paychecks into drugs when we have responsibilities to attend to. I feel like we're getting our life back and we've reduced our usage to a meager .2 maximum each day and any w/d symptoms are much more tolerable than before.

That brings me to this afternoon, when a whole new issue just presented itself unexpectedly. I woke up this morning thinking we were doing great, just a couple more days from our target, when someone suggested to my husband that the best way to wean ourselves off the last little amount (essentially, to maintain the very low usage level and allow our bodies to re-regulate while using/buying very minor amounts) would be to shoot it up. The argument, I guess, is that we could split a half gram over several days if injected, whereas smoking it requires more -- and our finances just don't have any room for more at this point.

If I'm being honest with myself, I am terrified by the thought of even going there. We've made it this far without giving in to any offers to try IV. That step is where many of our friends dove head first into a deeper problem than they had before, which sounds terrible to me when we've worked this hard to taper ourselves off with nothing but diligence and hard work. So, my questions: has anyone else received this as a suggestion for tapering off, or is this person misinformed and further passing along that misinformation to us? Would this be a good idea or a terrible one?

The last issue is that my husband prefaced the pitch with, ""The reason why I'm entertaining this thought is because it's something I've always wondered about, even before we ever got involved in the first place. If we quit this weekend without ever trying it I almost feel as though I'll think like ***** [friend who went through a similar situation, tried to quit suddenly without a plan or ""getting in his kicks"" for lack of a better term] did and relapse because I didn't get it out of my system."" To me that sounds like it could be his mind trying to justify a questionable solution to a serious problem that we've spent months trying to remedy. But at the same time, if it's really something he wants to try, I do recognize that this is the absolute last time it will ever be an option. I am not as well educated about the effects of different usage methods (bio-availability and whatnot) like my husband is, and he seems to think this is a good recommendation, so I wanted to ask you all what you think: would it be worth it to try this as a way to wean ourselves off that last little bit we've been using or are we asking to set ourselves back? Or, if the tapering thing is a total no-go, would it be worthwhile to try to shoot up one time to quell any curiosity about it and then get back on our quitting schedule that's worked well for us thus far?

Sorry this is so long, I apologize for ranting -- this is just a very sudden and thought-consuming predicament. Any and all advice is much appreciated! I can take the heat, give it to me if you've got it. Thanks all.

**TL;DR:** A trusted friend advised my husband that, to help us make the last jump as we're tapering off using heroin, the most advantageous way to work down from the last .2 per day would be to shoot it up. Never tried it before; very apprehensive about taking that advice."	t5_2r0y3	True
1350177774.0	11fvco	So heroin got the best of me.	Fringes	25	6	50	"Nothing more to say. Heroin was taking me down the rabbit hole, straight to that wonderful place Dante writes about. I was passing through the dark woods into the first circle when my housemates staged an intervention. Never thought I was one to be the center of an intervention. 

I was smarter. I was stronger. I was better prepared. 
But Heroin knows that. It feeds into your psych. Most of us are above average intelligence, and we only need our wits to get by in life. We never have to study, or work hard. We simply solve everything with our intellect- lying, cheating, conning, slipping by unnoticed. Then we became addicts, and we couldn't beat it. We'd never lost to anything before, how could this happen? 
It happened because addiction is a part of ourselves. We finally had a formidable foe; ourselves. We rationalize and try to make sense of the losing battle, but we can't beat addiction. We can't beat addiction because it is in us as much as our heart or brain or kidneys are in us.

Once you're an addict you don't go back. You can be sober for 25 years but you're still an addict.**You fight every day to stay clean.**

If anyone has a personal story of beating a real hardcore addiction and staying clean for the rest of their life, please share, it would surely provide solace to at least one of us.

Welp. Nearing the second week of an outpatient. It was a good run brothers. I hope each and every one of you stays afloat for as long as possible. I sincerely hope you don't need to hit rock bottom before realizing you need help, and to all you chippers; Keep on chippin'!

I hope to never relapse, but that demon inside me speaks so enticingly- Come on man, get some good dope, grab some rigs, you can easily stay functioning and get high! I fight these thoughts every waking day- but so does every addict; even those who've been sober for years.

I was bored sick and sitting in my closet at the local ymca. I only had one phone connect at the time and he was a suburban kid about 3 years younger then me. I had a few open air markets within walking distance of the Ymca so i thought i can burn this suburban dope dealer, we will call him M. So i call a girl up and ask her if she wants to make a bun, duh she does and agrees to drive. I call M and order 5 bun and tell him to put them in a cig pack cuz my ride can't know I'm getting D. 

15 minutes later my girl scoops me and we head to the burbs. I tell her that I'm just gonna beat the kid up if i have to, but prefer not to. I call and try to get him to meet at a park, he tells me to go to his house, and he'll be outside, i haggle over price for a min and tell him ill be there in 5. I'm panicking a little at this point as he has roommates and im not a fan of getting my ass kicked by 3 dudes while sick. My girl gives me $15 in ones to use as flash cash if needed.

we pull up and M is outside by himself. i get out of the car and he has the dope filled pack in his hand. i walk up and raise my hand to slap hands but instead in one smooth motion grab the cig pack, turn around and run 5 ft to the car and hop in. Me and the girl ride off into the sunset where we proceed to get mangled, she forgets the 15 she gave me so i can afford cigs. Like an ass i use all the dope by 7 am the next day.

Only a few months after I reached my lowest point (highest doses, more frequent use) I was arrested for drug possession. Luckily I only had 10 mg of hydrocodone on me opiate-wise so rather than jail I was sentenced to 12 weeks of outpatient rehabilitation with randomized drug testing.

I had to check about 30 (exaggeration) fucking stores in the area just to find Spice Island poppy seeds at a price that wasn't completely fucking me. It turns out a grocery Walmart had pretty dece prices. Anyways, I got 3 jars of 2.6 oz's and I used 2 of the bottles for my formula. I have a pretty small tolerance, and this was my first time with PST, so I started small. The narcotic concoction that I made from those 2 jars started out surprisingly plain, but had me nearly gagging by the end. I was surprised at how much fluid there was to drink! Poppy seed ""tea"" is a rather deceiving name. But yeah, watched some futurama and felt it kick in about 30 minutes later. Smoked a bowl with a buddy and an hour later I was at the full effect. It's rather mild; it feels like 15mgs of vicodin, which is pretty much the lowest amount of opiate I'll bother using to get high. I drank some tonic water, then had a benadryl and an aleve, and the high is a bit more noticeable now. But yeah, I gotta say, I wasn't 100% sure PST was gonna be worth my time, but I've definitely found something new to work with, and I'm going to try honing a good formula. I'm gonna use 3 jars next time, and maybe use some of the regular potentiators for me.

TL:DR I tried poppy seed tea, I didn't make a ton, but it worked and I'm fuckin excited

Happy nods, b/r/opiates 

EDIT: So today, I tried it again, except with 3.5 jars instead of 2. MUCH better results. I'm still not fucked up by a long shot, but its a much more noticeable high. It's also a very different high from most opiates. Less of a ""high"" so much, and more of a complete sense of peace. Very relaxing and pleasant."	t5_2r0y3	True

I hesitate to say this here because I only blew 15 or so blues, and I know that what I'm going through is just a fraction of what many of you have many a' time.

The thing about it is there's a hole and nothing to throw in it.  Drugs and opiates in particular reveal the mechanical workings of the brain, and the question of motives takes on a particular significance when there's very little energy to parse out...I've been trying to come up with a poetic way to describe my pain, and I can't.  I was standing on my balcony for hours quietly reciting myself poetry while everyone was out having a great time and even if there's no logical reason I can't be like them I can't, for the life of me, ever figure out how.  It's a hole, and it'll still be there when the withdrawals are over and all I'm trying to do is remember what I used to enjoy, and think, well, there's that one thing...what else again?  Oh yeah, a whole big pile of nothing with some sides of sit down and shut the hell up, and while you're at it thank jesus for being in America and having a job and not being crazy or deformed or stupid.  You are small and nobody cares how you feel.  You can derive bliss from a cool breeze or you can not be a junkie, but you can't be both.  Because on its own, it's just the fuckin' wind.

Sorry and thanks for listening.

1365728896.0	1c6cd7	A story to tell my friends	Dilly-day-dreamer	22	4	20	"Well my fine partaking gentlemen and ladies of high stature, I've been lurking for over a year now. Finally decided to make an account after falling in love with reading every post on here, from you snarky bastards making fun of kids asking about 500mg hydros to wrenching my heart and practically bringing me to tears with stories of lost loved ones. My pupils never prick without thoughts of coming here to see whats going on In my favorite community. I've always been at home whenever my sweet pharmaceuticals grab hold of my pleasure receptors. Some come sit down and listen to a little story I have to tell. Its not much but offer a little entertainment is the least I can do when you guy's get me through my sickest sick days. 

My tale begins with a rare occasion. I happen to finally reap the harvest of my blood, sweat, and tears and have more then a little cash to spare, for the first time in months. I call up my bud to see what type of opiods he has, that may grace my nostrils. ""oh hey bud"" he says after picking up after three rings, his husky voice sounding like  music to my ears. ""lucky for you all my plugs got back from the pharmacy, And my medicine cabinet looks like a candy store. What to you want, I've got blues, opana 10 ir's and the white triangle dillies"" Sweet merciful lord, My heart races and I practically break a sweat. He never has anything more then greens, and on rare christmas like occasions the purplish gray 20's. Having a grand ready to spend on my supplies, I tell him i'll pick up fifty blues, twenty five opas and twenty dillies, He chuckles and tells me to meet him at our usual spot, the greasy little sub shop parking lot downtown. 

I practically skip over to his car and he hands me three baggies looking just as fat as they should be and he says he threw in some extra subs in a fourth larger bag, just in case I binge a little too hard. I'm a little surprised and grateful, but the bag looks a little big for just some of the plasticy foil wrappers of subs, but hell who am I to complain? I just manage not to kiss him on the cheek as I jog in to hit the shops bathroom and chop out a line. As I sat down on my my porcelain throne I pull out a blue and an opa, lay them on my bill and grind them to a pulp with my bic lighter, I smile, realising I still have enough greenery to buy two ounces of greenery. I bend over and sniff the lines off of my 40 oz to freedom cd case I slipped into my denim jacket. Oh that sweet drip, the taste is so sickly sweet and bitter. My gaze lowers too the cd case as I swirl my finger over it and lick the residue off my fingers. Man bradley. Why did you have to boot that fat shot and off yourself. I never even got to see you live. A sigh slips out of my lips as my eyes roll back in my head and the warmth envelopes me. A big cheshire grin creeps onto my face and I chuckle at the graffiti in the stalls. a couple of toys trying to show off their handstyles and a dick here and there. One particularly vulgar line sticks in my mind ""dont be a quitter, put it in her shitter"". 

As I float off the toilet and back into the real world my mind is at ease. The tensions and stresses of my day are far and few between. I get a call from a close friend of mine (the only other user I partake with) saying he's in the area and asks if I want to go to a party with him. Im higher then flavah flave on helicopter with a crack pipe, so sure why not. maybe she'll even be ther-""oh and guess what dude, rhiannas there. She's asking where you are. Shes thirsty"". I break out laughing at my friends use of the word thirsty but hell, Im dancing over to his car when he pulls up. Rhianna is the cutest most enticing perfect female I'd ever met, (except cayce, but thats another heartbreak to be told over another line). When I get to the party she practically grabs me by my jacket and pulls me into the guest room. Am I dreaming. Is this actually happening or is this some pipe dream induced by my own cocktail of drugs. 

No.

Its real.

The scent of her skin and the taste of her lips, oh my god the way she undressed and crawled onto me. The most sensual two hours of my life proceeded over another couple blues and she fell asleep in my arms, practically purring she was sighing so contentedly. I slipped out of bed and got dressed and joined the party. Hookah was being smoked and I was high as a kite and my balls were a helluva lot lighter then when I started the night. As I joined in on a few rounds of hookah and played ring of fire with an OE. The lights dimmed down and My vision slowly nodded off. My fellow party goers were passing out drunk around me. I couldnt help but walk off after most were out cold. Except nick and tom playing a vicious round of egyptian rat screw. I slip back into the room with her. I chop out another line. One day This will be a story to tell my friends...

Here are some of mine. Nothing special or anything that hasn't been done millions of times before:

- I hack a lot. If you don't know, it's where you drive around and look for people flagging for rides. Kind of like a cheap taxi service. Around here in Baltimore City, this is one of the easiest ways to make money. You just have to know where to go to pick up your hacks.
- I don't boost myself but I have a few friends who do. I'll pick them up sometimes and take them boosting then take them to sell their shit and cop. I have one friend who is insanely good at boosting and he's usually my go-to guy in the mornings if I'm sick and broke.
- I sometimes go scrapping. A normal sized air conditioner can be broken down and scrapped for $25 - $30. You just have to know what you're doing when you're breaking stuff down. If I'm desperate, there are tons of business parks where I live where I can go dumpster diving and find tons of scrap.
- I cop for people. I have tons of good connects and a lot of friends that don't or would rather have someone else take the risk when copping. Everyone I know knows I play fair so they look out for me, I look out for them.
- Sometimes I'll park my car near a gas pump and give people a story about running out of gas and realizing that I left my wallet at home. I'll tell them I'm trying to scrape together enough just to make it back home. I dress nice for this and I'm good with talking to people. Sometimes I can make $20 in just a few minutes doing this. I've had people just hand me $20 before. Sometimes people will just pay for the gas at the cashier but hey, free gas :) Sometimes I'll make a couple hundred dollars in a day, but sometimes it seems like NOBODY is trying to kick anything out.

Anyways, like I said, nothing special. I don't rob or steal, mostly because I just don't have the heart for it. I depend on my car a lot. Whenever I have car issues and I'm desperate, I'll just flat out pan handle. ""Hey man, I'm trying to make some bus fare, can you help me out a bit?"".

This is really fucking awesome cause the last guys that I had before i went into treatment taxed the fuck out of me, and probably took like a quarter out of each of my bags.

i went to the nearest sketchy area a mile or so away from where i live, and whilst walkin about up and down the streets (around 11pm) i meet these two homeless guys. we start talkin and i hit it off with one of them. we talk about music, drugs and all other kinds of things. i finally got a word in and asked for some ""gear"" and his friend says hes the man to talk to. we go to meet his dealer, who is also meeting 10, fucking TEN people at the same time in this very dark, poorly lit park. it was sketchy, but something about this homless guy told me id be fine.

got two bags of about .2 for £20 (about $30 or so) and i promised him a few rips off the foil. i didnt have any apparatus or rigs so he took me through a hole in a fence, and into a massive, completely pictch black abandonned building.

in some rooms there were people sleeping in filth, in other rooms there were junkies doin their thang. we went to this one room where two obviously very very doped up guys were layin out, and we got some foil, and eventually convinced them to give me one of their clean, pre packaged rigs.

we then walked to ANOTHER abandoned place, which was pretty much a bathroom i think? and we opened up one of the bags and got it laid out on the foil. i let him take first rip, but he made sure it was just a tiny toot so that i could get the best possible hits. man... i took that first rip and i just fell against the wall. bare in mind im on 18mg suboxone a day and had also taken probably 40mg of valium that night too.

we took turns ripping the foil, and this guy was a fuckin pro. there was not a single bit of residue left after the smoke sesh in this tiny dilapidated bathroom. it was about 10 rips each, and by the time it was done, i was fucking ROCKED. i let him keep the tooter we made, since it had some leftovers inside he could use later. i gave him a couple of my 5mg valiums as well since he was the coolest and most helpful dude ive ever met.

the whole time we were chatting, joking around and shit, but considering the fact that i was walking around with drugs, money and a homless guy id never met until an hour ago, plus the fact we were in an abandoned complex that i doubt anyone would dream of going near... i still was totally at peace (and high as shit)

i said my goodbyes to him and his friend that i met, numbers were exchanged and i went home, almost shitting myself at the thought of the bag in my pocket i was about to shoot. 

got home, rigged a shot and i felt it but knew i wasnt gettin all the dope to dissolve. went and grabbed some citric acid and boom. perfect shot. i was propper rocked at that point, and ended up nodding out whilst trying to get on the tinychat last night about 2am GMT, but passed out with all my shit laying around me. luckily at some point in the night i woke up and cleaned it all up before passing out again fully clothed. woke up at 1pm today, feeling out of it, but much more clear headded after an hour or so.

my current debate is whether or not i go pick up my subbies today, or do this last bit of gear ive got left (about 100mg). 

ill probably take a hit, go get the subs and just not take em til later on when the H is out my system, but fuck me... it was some good H for how shitty im told it is around here. this is the first time in 10 months ive touched any drugs at all, i dont regret it, and im not going to get more. it was a one time thing for me, and im super glad that i can remember how it felt, and know how bad it would be for me to even consider doing another bag. maybe in another ten months... who knows.

hope yall enjoyed this tale... i know its long, but give me a few minutes and ill have some LOVELY pictures for you :DD

happy nodding my dudes

**EDIT:** here are the pictures of one of the £10 bags i scored.

gotta say, i got a hella good shot last night, but when i finnished the rest this morning it didnt do too much. as tempted as i may be, im not going near it again and in fact am about to go down to my clinic and tell my social worker i relapsed. im not trying to cover it up from people, it was my decision to do it, and im still happy i did.

However, I notice, especially when I have taken more than my allotted daily allowance, I experience what I can only describe as a “brain orgasm”.

Essentially, it’s everything that I would feel during a full fledged nut busting, except I am not physically aroused, and do not ejaculate either.  But the full wave of body ecstasy courses through me.  Repeatedly at that.  Minor stimulation of my flaccid member increase the pleasure, causing me to shudder and quiver just like the real thing.  It’s really weird. And really great.  I wish I could summon it on demand, but so far I have been unable to generate this experience at will.

Is this a one off phenomenon?  Anyone else ever experienced something like this?

Looking forward to feeback.

1338255906.0	u9m5v	Hey, b/r/opies. 	pleadthefifth	26	8	61	"It's fucking 90 degrees here in NYC and I've been dopesick all day. I guess it being 90 degrees was kind of good, because I have my own personal air conditioner, which is my disgusting, sweaty body and withdrawal chills. 

I'm feeling alright now because I busted out my Suboxone I keep in case of emergencies such as this. I put .5mg under my tongue and feel surprisingly human. My legs are a bit kicky and I'm still sweating like a pig, but I'm able to keep food and liquids down, which always helps. 

I wish I had some bud to go with my sub, though. Perhaps I'll dose some MXE later. I get so depressed I wanna fucking kill myself when I don't have opiates. It's the honest truth. I don't mean to dampen your nods, it's just that Suboxone makes me utterly depressed. It's not even my script; I had to bum this off of a junkie pal who got on Methadone. 

I wish I had some score-porn to show you all, but all I've got is a sad, sad 1mg strip of Suboxone (as in, half a fucking 2mg strip!) 

I don't wanna turn this into r/opiatesrecovery material so I will end with: 

I wish you all happy nods &amp; I hope to live vicariously through your score pics. I am completely jealous of most of you right now! I have... dope envy. /sadpanda I hope to share some score pics one day, but usually once I get my hands on Opis, they go up my greedy nose ASAP. :D "	t5_2r0y3	True
1337969882.0	u4tf9	Interesting Heroin production facts (at least to me!)	verichrome	21	3	28	"For a while now I have researched illegal drug production, markets, policy, finance, etc.  Its all a fascination of mine.  Recently Ive been doing some research into heroin production over the past 20 or 30 years and learned that most of the heroin found on the east coast (ECP) is actually produced largely in Colombia (obviously more well known for it coca economy).  

Mexico has grown in the past four years to the second biggest producer besides Afghanistan (which accounts for 87% of worldwide production).  Im assuming this is what accounts for the huge spike in BTH which it seems is much much more widely available now than it was in the past.  And its probably safe to assume the growing demand for Heroin is caused directly by the spike in people using pharmaceuticals but anyway that is another topic....

I guess the point of all this is that it seems to be commonly assumed that (powder) Heroin found in the US comes from Asia however it seems as if Colombia account for the majority of it in the US.  Is this true?  

Anyway, I find all this stuff fascinating!  And if any of these assumptions/facts are wrong I'd love to hear it!

""Instead of slapping a label on you, the Germans would describe as *'Morphiumsuchtig.'*  The verb *suchen*  means to seek.  So that might be translated, loosely, as 'morphine seeky' or even more loosely as 'morphine-seeking.'  I prefer 'seeky' because it implies you have an inclination to seek morphine.

""What the fuck are you talking about?""  Shaftoe says.

""Well, suppose you have a roof with a hole in it.  That means it is a leaky roof.  It's leaky all the time -- even if it isn't raining at the moment.  It is only leak*ing* if it happens to be raining.  In the same way, being morphine-seeky means you have this tendency to look for morphine, even if you aren't looking for it at the moment.

Instead of driving off when we were done, we both nodded out for a minute. It was at that point that we were ripped from his car and taken into custody.
Basically, we are both looking at Heroin possession, and possession of paraphernalia (spoons and rigs). A felony! My boyfriend has a lawyer, but I do not. Almost everything was right next to/on me when we were pulled out of the car. I was never read my Miranda Rights, but I'm not sure it even matters. I have never even been pulled over in my life, let alone arrested. This also sparked my entire faimly finding out about my habit, which I have so diligently worked at to hide.
AND LET'S NOT FORGET,spending the entire night/morning/afternoon/evening in the Miami Dade County Jail. The most revolting, grotesque and disturbing place I have ever witnesssed, and been a part of. People there that had been to, or came from other jails, were appalled at how disgusting these cells were-how the entire place was.We got to use a phone once, for only 3 minutes, in which I was never able to get a hold of any of my family. Luckily, after attending a hearing, I was released on Pre-Trail, and have to return in the next 4 hours to attend court.

That I never intend to keep.
Empty parking lots,
And deserted streets.
Intentions are clear,
And plain for all to see,
If I wasn't the only one who cared.
Nerves on edge, and time crawls to a stop.
Waiting for her.
My true love, my mistress,
Who steals souls, and rapes the willing,
Training my eyes to spot her a mile away.
Butterflies in my stomach,
She's the only one,
Who can make me so apathetic.
I see myself through another's eyes,
For just a second,
For just a second, I see true despair,
I'm so pathetic.
I thought we were done,
Thought I had forgotten all about her,
As she's in my arms, my soul, my mind,
Like riding a bike,
I could never forget the way she makes me feel,
Happy and sad, all in one,
She only takes a point, to tell me I'm done,
I'm the dumb ass rat, crawling back to the trap,
Terror mixed with exhilaration,
Maybe I won't be so lucky next time,
Illness finds a hole in bliss.
She makes me sick,
As I hold her in my hands,
I feel sick,
As I pull her close.
Guts and Glory in the toilet bowl,
With her on the bed screaming ""Let's have another go"",
I give in, weakness rears it's ugly head.
I used to love her,
Said only nice things,
Now she's nothing more,
Than a whore I can use for the night,
And forget in the morning.
Picking myself off the strangest floor,
She'd left without a word,
Ways I'd rather keep it,
Things I would never change.
Maybe next time the trap will get me,
I feel like I'm playing Russian Roulette,
With a loaded gun.
Everyone's gotten off their high horse,
But I can't seem to stay off mine. "	t5_2r0y3	True

To qualify for a chance, just post on here, why you should receive them. Try to make your reason worthy as I wont be giving them to people that can't be bothered to post proper answers.

This is no scam. Those that know me on here know I am genuine, and pretty generous at times. This is one of those times. lol.

I will wait a few days to make sure everyone who is interested, gets a chance to post.

So go for it people, get posting.

Personally I am gutted, fucking love the furry ones. But, we now know to expect recurring vets bills that we just cant afford. I would do anything to keep them, but know my wife is right.

So, I am sad as fuck. But brought a shit ton of H to cheer me up.

We have a week before they go, so I plan on spending as much time as possible with them both.

Edit: I have just been told we have found a permanent home for them at a cat sanctuary dedicated to cats that struggle to be rehomed. It has acres of land and hundreds of cats that will never be put down. They can live their lives their happily. 

The only downside to this cat paradise is we can never see them again. Its a secret place that take in cats that are supposed to be put down. Some anti animal putting down place ran by a vet who disagrees with animals being put down. The RSPCA do not know it exists,  and would probably try to close it if they did. Then put the cats down.... sick fucks at the rspca. Never liked them as they put down loads of animals.

So, I am really sad, but happy at the same time knowing they will be happy with tons of Land and other cats, and will never be put down.

Gonna get as many pictures of them before they go, create an album and then post it in this subreddit.

I have also, between me and a couple of mates, created a subreddit dedicated to trying to find homes for pets, rather than be put down.

Its /r/RescuePetsUK and I would appreciate any help people can offer to spread the word.

I hate places that put down animals, just because no one wants them. So want to use the reddit community to help find homes for them.

CleverWit	21	4	21	"Had no intention of picking up anything today, was actually considering making my first SR purchase and waiting it out. I like in NJ and my gf recently moved about an hour away to PA for grad school. So I stopped home after work to pack a bag of some clothes to come up for the weekend. I live in a shitty neighborhood (we're literally the only white residents in the neighborhood, not that it matters just saying.) 

My next door neighbor is a junkie ""I've got a habit"" was the phrase he repeated constantly when I first told him I use dope while trying to be friendly when we first moved in and giving him a ride to 711. Anyway, after being home for 5 mins he must've seen me driving away and called to see if I was leaving town for the weekend, as usual, probably because he wanted a ride to pick up. He's unemployed and doesn't have a car, so I always drive when I wanna score because I have no connects so when I score it's always by having him middle for me.

I said yeah I was leaving town and he was just ""all right, have a good weekend."" About twenty seconds later I called him back to ask if anything was actually right in town and I could score without having to drive anywhere to pickup. He said yeah, so I immediately hit the atm and went back to town. Of course, when I get there I find out it wasn't actually on our block like he implied, but fortunately I only hadda take us a few blocks away, just a five minute right.

I give him my $50 for the 5 stamps I wanted, realizing as I circle the block he was gonna throw down $20 and get a full bundle and keep 5 for himself, instead of at least throwing me a 6th for free like would've been the decent thing to do. I shug, fuck it, least I'm getting what I want all within 15 mins. I pick him back up, get my 5 and drop him back off on the street next to ours (I don't ever want my roommates to see us together, cause they'd immediately figure out why we were together.

I stop at my moms house 5 minutes away to give her a few bucks to help out, like I always do the weeks I get paid (bi-weekly.) I go in the bathroom after cutting a straw and dump one out to blow, just to see the size. A fucking bump is literally all this first stamp was. I only wanted to do one stamp before the drive up to PA, but seeing how scummily small they were, I did two and ate a mg of Xanax to give it a boost.

Felt it, but not so much. Make the drive up to my girls, about an hour ride, barely feeling it. So I got here about 45 minutes ago, went to the bathroom and dumped out my other three bags on the counter, tearing apart the stamps and scraping out every last grain of the tan powder. I blew it all up and popped two more .5 mgs Xanax, washing them down with the rum and coke I'm drinking now. 

So now, as I write this, 5 stamps, 2 mgs of Xanax, and my tasty Captain cocktail, I'm actually feeling pretty fucking great. Not full uncontrollably nodding kinda high, but the step right before that. Hugged by invisible puppy clouds, itchy, warm and content.

And for the record, my gf who is sitting two feet away from me as I write this does not know I'm still using, but she's very drug naïve and can't tell. So now I'm content to enjoy a nice relaxing night, feeling my love and hanging out with my human love.

I know this was a very uneventful story, I just felt like sharing todays tale of acquiring and enjoying my favorite substance. Happy nods all, may you score bigger bags than I did today (but hey, at least I'm high).

And for the record, I know it's stupid and dangerous to mix benzos and booze with my dope, but, hey, it is what it is.

So once again, happy nods bropiates and bropiettes.

UPDATE: By the end of the night (about 3 hours after those last stamps) it took me about 30 minutes just to log into my laptop and log into reddit one last time between nods, so I'd say it worked out pretty well and I got where I was trying to go. All in all, pretty good night."	t5_2r0y3	True

I awake about 11 and dress myself in jeans and an old dress shirt, doing my best to look middle class. I also equip myself with my wallet, lighter and trusty Spyderco Knife. On the way out the door I grab my paycheck and begin my walk to the light rail. Once downtown I cash my check, buy a pack of Dunhill Cigarettes and walk to a specific park (open air drug market). I am propositioned almost immediately; ""watcha need, man?"" ""Black"" I reply. ""How much?"" he asks ""$60"" I answer. Normally deals are safe to make in the park but there is a protest going on a block up and the park is surrounded by LEOs. ""OK, follow me, by the library""   and we saunter off to make our deal. First he hands me a $20 bag (clear plastic, looks good too) and tells me that he has to break off more and we are headed to Arby's. On the way we make small talk, turns out we are both from Southern California (or so he said) and that he was selling $100 grams. So I decide what the hell and say I'll buy a gram in lieu of $60's worth. Once at Arby's I lend him a lighter and he disappears for a minute and returns with a small parcel wrapped in a melted opaque white trashbag.

From there I begin my trip back home, walk to union station, take the light rail, walk the final stretch, the entire time relishing my score.

So I did the only thing I could do and cooked up the paltry $20 bag to get high enough to share this story with you guys.

I know getting ripped off is a common occurrence in our circle, especially when cold copping but this is the first time it's happened to me.

 So, It's been maybe a little over a week since I posted about quitting doing heroin. So I haven't been counting but I've been opiate free for about 9 days or some shit. I'm a fucking human again as in I'm no longer withdrawing which is nice but fuck, so check this; Shit goes down, I post on here about quitting. That Saturday my wife decides there's no way she's going to stay clean without going to rehab. well fucking fuck so of course her family in Idaho jumps on this shit and gets her to fly home for rehab and she took my kid with her after fighting for hours over who would take care of her. She decided I was too fresh to take care of her and now her stupid cunt sister in Idaho has my kid and isn't answering my facebook messages asking to be able to call so my 7 month old doesn't forget my voice. So basically after deciding to get clean i fucking lost everything I love. After they leave and I no longer have contact with them my mom found out about a violin i stole because I'm a stupid fuck when i'm on junk and basically said I'm an orphan from this point on and not to call for shit. I'm 20 so there;s time to fix this but at the moment I'm totally fucking homeless and don't know what to do next. I'm stuck, and I'm so fucking depressed I just want my family back home where they belong. But I lost our home because i'm a piece of shit. I ruined any chance of her having a safe place in New Jersey to come back to. And what do I think of, I just want to get fucking high. I hate all this constant pain, missing my wife every second of every day. Thinking about her, then my daughter, then getting heroin back into my veins as soon as possible, the only thing I have left of value is my longboard and I've considered pawning it just to get high for one more stupid fucking day. Which of course would turn into every fucking day. I'm losing my mind over here my friends, I've lost my family and my home two of the most important thing any man could ever have and all I have left is my skateboard and a junk habit trying to pull me right back to square one. I'm trying to stay strong, I'm staying strong the temptation is killing me but getting high won't get my family back...but fuck at least I wouldn't feel this way anymore, at least for a little while. 

Basically I'm just ranting and miserable, thanks for reading if you did and thanks for not commenting if you didn't. Stay well out there my friends."	t5_2r0y3	True

1371182263.0	1gbfui	I need to drop some heavy feels..	Jamillia	21	5	16	"I can feel my roommates hand take hold of my ankle, and tug.. I hold on to the leg of the bed tighter, I haven't caught my breath in what feels like an eternity.. and the cracks in his voice, while he's trying to be strong for me, and get me to come out, is only making me cry harder. We have 30 minutes before we need to leave, and I'm hiding under the bed like a toddler. I can't get my shit together.. I can't do this.. He lets go of my ankle, and lays down on the floor next to me in his freshly pressed shirt.. He doesn't say anything, we just lay there like zombies, much like the 4 days prior that I had spent in my.. Place, if you will..

The place where everyone isn't looking at me, where everyone isn't asking ""what happened"" ... None of the strangers offering condolences can get me under there.. It's lined with his t-shirts, socks, underwear.. the last towel he used..His pillow that is still filthy from Starscape... It smells like every night before bed, and every Sunday morning.. I have a strange collection of miscellaneous shit from the past 4 years and I've just been laying in it for days. 

We have to ""view"" the body today. We have to say goodbye to the love of my life, my best friend... Everyone's best friend.. Our house is calm for the first time since Monday, when my whole world came crashing down. It's just me, my two roommates, and our fifth that had always rounded out the family. We are all dressed in funeral attire for the first, of three agonizing days of saying goodbye to one of our soldiers.. I happen to be ""the lady"" .. And I happened to have been madly in love with the soldier that left me in this world on June 14th, 2010, by means of a self inflicted gunshot wound. 

Fifth didn't live with us, because he was a heroin addict. Not because we didn't love him, or want him there.. It was just easier for him to live at his parents as his addiction deepened, mostly money wise.. He pretty much rode the couch, we called it his bed.. he was our undocumented roomate !

I had never done H. I got down on my fair share of get downs though.. At the time, I was an avid ketamollicaine (k, Molly, and coke in one scrumdiddlyumptious line) dirty deems, and benzo kinda gal.. I raged a lot of festies, smoked a lot of tree and just dug the mother fuck out of life ! It wasn't that I had no interest in dope.. I was just very conscious of fifths daily struggle to exist. I laid on the other end of the couch while he kicked uncontrollably, and poured sweat like a beast in the A/C... He always wanted to get clean, so anytime I'd get curious and start inquiring about giving it a rip, he'd remind me of all the pain id witnessed, and in some cases been through due to his love affair with dope.. I accepted it. Just lookin out for me ! 

I'm out from under the bed, but I can not get my shit together... Into the bathroom to fix my face... Fifth is in there.. With his works. 

I didn't put any thought into it really, I asked if his rig was new.. Before he could get ""yes"" out, I had his belt around my bicep and I was asking him to hit me... He obliged, and in that moment, I sold my soul to the needle. 

10, 9, 8... I'm warm. I must be under the bed...? I'm not..I'm in the bathroom ? I disconnect. 

I'm not lonely, or scared. 

I can fill a novel with my feelings, or thoughts.. Evident to whomever made it this far into my story.. But when it comes to explaining that first shot... The mental benefits almost over shadowed the euphoric achievements my body reached. From that first shot in the bathroom, I never looked back. I would *never* have made it through the last 3 years without dope.. To some, that truth is ""sad"".. To me, it's just truth I guess. THIS is what makes getting clean laughable to me... And the clean time I did rack.. Was hurtful, and scary, and a fucking joke.. Because I couldn't shut the want off for 35 seconds at a time. 

Tomorrow is the three year anniversary of my world packing it into a bullet... And next Tuesday marks the day I became an IV heroin endorser..

I really needed to dump that shit out. So if you took the time to read this.. THANK YOU !!! All of those memories play in my head like an infomercial.. I still have night terrors, trust issues, and a raging addiction... But for the first time, I can tell people, who if nothing else, catch my drift on the raging addiction part... 

**TL;DR** tomorrow is a shit 3 year anniversary for me (my boyfriends suicide) so I decided to tell the story of how I started to use... which coincidentally, will have its very own shit anniversary Tuesday. "	t5_2r0y3	True

I have bone spurs in my neck which give me pain from time to time but doesn't warrant oxy TBH. My normal doc was booked out one time so I went to a walk in medical center and that's where I was introduced to oxy. I was only expecting panadeine forte (30mg codeine, 500mg acetaminophen) but this doc skipped past that and offered oxy without my asking. After I ran out, I asked my normal doc for more and he look horrified that this other doc had given them to me, he also refused to give me any. My reg doc is looking out for me but sometimes a mother fucker just wants to get high so I went back to the other doc and got more oxy.

I've been back to this other medical centre numerous times, hamming it up about how my neck is so painful. Last time, the doctor suggested cortisone injections into my neck. I sat there thinking oh fuck what have I got myself into, this dodgy fucker wants to stick me with needles and all I want to do is get high. If he tries to do it right now, I'm gonna have to refuse but it's going to look hella dodgy because apparently I'm in so much pain! Thankfully, he just gave me a referral to a neuro. Obviously I didn't call to book an appointment because I don't need no fucking injections into my neck.

The problem I have now is the prescriptions don't last long enough. I started in Jan with 5mg taken orally, that then turned into chewing 5mg, then 10mg, then 15mg and now 20mg. How can I get more without resorting to stealing or sourcing it illegally. I just want as much oxy as I want, I don't think that's too much to ask. I need to go back to this dodgy doctor because I've run out of oxy and I was thinking about just asking him straight up to play ball and write me prescriptions for as much as I want.

On an unrelated note, do pharmacies keep medications such as say, oxycodone, under lock and key after hours or is it on the shelf behind the counter?"	t5_2r0y3	True

SEDDITSCRUB	24	6	27	"Myself and 2 friends picked up some raw and went back to his parents house. He fixed himself a good strong shot, more than i'd ever seen him do ever, he shot up and less than 5 minutes later he was drooling all over himself and seizing.We called him an ambulance ASAP but he was unresponsive and barely breathing. We didn't wait a second to call 911 as soon as it became clear he wasn't responding.


We performed CPR until the paramedics arrived and took over but they got him to sit up and look around for a little bit before he nodded back out. On the way out of his house he was sitting up and we made eye contact.

 At this point what are the chances of him dieing? He's healthy as hell minus being a opiate addict. Works out a lot. I spoke with his parents and the paramedics and told everyone there what happened and what he was on. Based on them getting him to respond is there a good chance he is going to be okay?


EDIT: My friend is okay. We got him out of the Hospital a few hours ago around 2 AM eastern time. We live in Baltimore. First thing he asked was what we did with the syringes and the dope, we flushed it as soon as the call to the ambulance was made. He found out he might have an heart condition due to some abnormal rhythm/patterns, the doctor's recommended he see a specialist and stop doing drugs. His parents are pissed as hell but whatever. Thanks everyone, I was reading these comments in the waiting room and it helped take some concern away. One of the paramedics made a comment to me that his lips were turning blue when they were resuscitating him and that if he were left alone that way he could have died.

here's mine: one day my buddy and i were trying to pick up and of course no one was answering. this was in our pill-doing heyday when we each knew a few legit connects, but for some reason everyone was dry. discouraged and disgruntled we went to walgreens to pick up some beers and candy to try and cheer us up. while in the candy isle we see this dude and his gf. dude's on the phone yelling ""tell them they're oxy 30's! O-X-Y-C-O-N-T-I-N 30S! the little blue ones! 15 bucks!"" my friend and i both look at each other with a huge fucking grin ""no way""

I didn't want to freak him out so i just said loudly ""what, did he say oxys? i want some oxys!' and he looked at us ""for real? are you a cop?"" i was like 'wtf, do i look like a cop??! do you have them on you?"" sure enough he pulled out a tin with a bunch of roxies and morphines 30mgs.

Yeah, I *hate* having to waste my time waiting for those assholes for hours and hours, when I have other things I need to do. So I started telling them, ""don't say you'll be here in 20 minutes if you're not going to be here for several hours."" and a few of them are more honest about it now, so at least I'll be more realistic about what to expect. I also try not to call and bug them too much while I'm waiting, because I know it's irritating, and I don't like people doing it to me. When I stopped the habit of calling incessantly, they warmed up to me anyway.

I knew this one chick I used to buy from who is super-scary. She's just psycho, and a pathological liar. She keeps saying she has cancer (this has been proven false), yet parties and does coke. She's the biggest manipulator I've ever met in my life, she just uses and fucks *everyone* over. She's also a thief that will lie *right to your face* about anything. I really don't know how she does it. It's really scary. And she always raises the prices on her pills. $10 for 10MG Vicodin? No fucking thank you! She has blackmailed me several times, and has lied to my boyfriend about things I do, etc. I was finally able to get her out of my life. I ignored her calls and texts, and after a few months she finally got the picture. It sucks that I lost a dealer, though with her, it wasn't worth it. This woman is bat-shit insane and I'm still afraid to see her in public, haha."	t5_2r0y3	True

1347822941.0	zzech	Why arn't any pharmaceutical opiates illegally manufactured? 	FerretHydrocodone	19	2	56	"What I mean is, why arn't any opiates such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, ect ever manufactured illegally outside the companies that produce them?

Is it simply because it's too complicated and would be very expensive to make? Or is it because it's cheaper and easier to make heroin or opium and just sell that?

I would think there would have been at least one scientist who loved opiates and decided to set up a little lab and make pure Oxy down in his basement. 


Sorry for the spelling mistake.

I've just been curious."	t5_2r0y3	True

I am from Athens/Greece, so English is not my first language! Bear with me! Heroin is my self-medicating substance for 7+ years to combat chronic pain as well as a mixture of hardcore depression and some psychotic symptoms. Free healthcare here, but no pain managment clinics and an overall shitty institutions to treat addiction. 

**The topic of my post: Shit Dealers Do.** *Fell free to post the common dealers' behaviours of your Area. Things we all know and experienced, but in a tidy, list format.*

    Area: Athens, Greece
    Age: 26 - Years in the game: 7 - DOC: Heroin #3 
    *Musician, Lyricist, Poet, Performance Artist.*
    Involved with radical politics, including queer politics, as well as creating new 
    Anthropological Studies about the Issue that Junkies are the new ""other"" of our times, 
    in Foucault terms.

**On-Topic List**

1. Scoring from a dealer's house. He/she will tell you to come in 5 minutes quickly because he has a lot of work. You arrive under their house, only to be informed to wait 10 minutes and they'll come out to do buissness with you. These wonderfully expressed ""10 mins"" actually translate to 30-40 minutes, whilst their phone 'magically' doesn't accept calls. When they do appear, my hunger for my medicine erases *any desire* to file a complaint concerning their services.

2. From my experience, this is a 100% confirmed behaviour. When your trusted man announces that ""this new batch is fire/bomb/take-it-easy-or-O.D."", it is certain that the new batch is of a lower quality, and they try to placebo your brains. 

3. Dealers dissing other respectful dealers. I experienced one instance where a current dealer dissed the new batch of a very dark brown rocky H #3 circulates by another dealer of mine. Turns out, the 'other batch' is actually of a much better quality. Even users that want to support their dealer lie to you, even insulting your IQ by dissmising your objective experience about how the dark brown #3 is awesome.

4. I am an exceptional client. Always give straight money, not even 1 euro less, never ask for freebies. However, when the dealer is on a hard economical situation, he/she will not differentiate, and sell to me the same H cut with god-knows-what, with the other, unreliable junkies that BEG to purchase a 10euro dose every day with only 6-8 Euros. Some appreciation on my proffesional behaviour please!

5. What you call 'ballons' (i think), we call them 'papers'. When a 'paper' is obviously filled with lower quantity, they quickly announce that there are narcs everywhere and to take it and leave it ASAP. They induce a state of panic to their customer, so that he/she will not notice the rip-off until they get home.

P.S. I am sure a lot of bropiates and femmpiates will tell me to change dealers. *However, this thread is about **reliable ones**. I won't get even into discussing the shady, unprofessional ones.*

I hope I didn't break any guidlines, this is my first post, so I needed to introduce myself, and also post a topic that crosses my mind lately.

**Feel free to AMA me about the economical crisis in Greece, and how it is related to the market. AskmeAnything about my Area's uniqueness concerning the Opiate Game. We have exceptional cheap quality gear, maybe because of the geographical proximity with the east. Roma population is the main supplier to the country, bringing the best #3 from the East (I guess)**"	t5_2r0y3	True
