He died from what  I believe was previous complications of his two strokes he had a couple years ago. He was only 41. 

There was not much information on his passing from when I last checked, so if anyone can share with us what exaclty happened that would be great.

**I want to be convinced**.  

I want you to make a strong argument for why YOUR pick is *the best rapper alive*.  

The rules:

* Alive means alive.  Biggie is disqualified, as is Tupac on the grounds that he's pretending to be dead.

* They don't have to still be rapping.  Feel free to nominate someone who's retired, as long as they're still alive.

* Rapper means rapper.  It's cool that Ice-T is on SVU.  It doesn't count towards him being a good rapper."	t5_2qh2e	True

For recording I utilized Adobe Audition (Although it mysteriously began crashing on my old laptop and I finished most of the album on a new one).

I did it all on a single laptop, with no hardware. (Save for a studio mic and M-Audio box)

If I sound proud of myself, I'm not gonna lie, I am.  The album has done with with my local (WV) audience.  But I was curious what people that aren't from my region think of it.

Thanks A HUGE AMOUNT in advance.  I'll answer any questions, should they come up."	t5_2qh2e	True

**EDIT:** I think it's easier just to respond here to what everyone's been saying rather than replying to each comment individually. 

First, doubois, I don't really have much patience for the ""true school/ *real* hip-hop"" argument that you're making. No other genre suffers as much from sticks in the mud as rap does from golden age classicists. No one disputes that bands today are still making rock music, even if they might bemoan the fact that the Beatles or the Stones aren't around any more. People that were at woodstock in 69 probably don't enjoy the Foo Fighters any more than you enjoy Gucci Mane, but that doesn't make them dispute that the Foo Fighters play rock.

Second, I guess I have no problem with the ""hip hop is the culture; rap is the music"" argument. Still, all three of the subreddits in question (r/hiphop, r/rap, and r/hiphopheads) seem to be pretty much exclusively focused on the music. I believe there are also separate subreddits for graffiti and breakdancing. Wouldn't it be easiest for r/rap (2,000 subscribers) and r/hiphop (1,700 subscribers) just to merge into r/hiphopheads (almost 17,000)?

I guess it doesn't really matter, and there's a bunch of subreddit redundancy all over reddit. It just seems silly to me to have three subreddits that are all essentially the same thing."	t5_2qh2e	True

Maybe it's a matter of opinion (well music usually is, but I think there are objective factors that can be used to determine if an MC is fucking terrible, and they're exploding when they're applied to Juelz specifically). This beat is amazing, like a lot of dipset beats, and it's just ruined, utterly ruined. 

Here's an example of someone else on the beat, it's better (this was when 50 tried and new how to be catchy at least). He is at least on beat and counts his bars and attempts a chorus (it's the same shit as Juelz, but the difference of how it's applied basically shows what I mean)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjU0QHLEpE0

Honorable mention: Bizarre: Just like U (d12 world)... 

I don't need to explain why Bizarre ruins any beat, but this shit is amazing. Why they gave the hi-tek beat to him is beyond me, I guess once they pay for it they can do whatever they want and I know he's their friend, but fucking A.

Distinctively Hip-Hop beat a must, other than that... PLAY BALL!!!  Make submissions in the form of .wav files if possible.  It will make it easier to record.  
Here are the tracks I am working on currently, but I would love better beats for them, so I ditched them a week ago.  Just really a sample so you know I am serious about this and have the capability of recording tracks.  https://soundcloud.com/Twhy-g

(Shout out to Platinium K on Jointz)

**EDIT:** Humbly, thank you!  I didn't expect three new beats in just one day.  Since I work during the day, I will start at the top of receptions and work my way down, completing one a day.  I will be able to keep up on that pace for a while. Please keep them coming, and who knows... I smell a Reddit Album!

I used to listen to 2pac and Biggie back in the day, but gave up on hip hop for a while, based on these albums, hip hop is indeed, not dead.

1.  Are you mainstream or underground?  Are you a Kanye West guy or an Aesop Rock guy?  Both?

2.  Where do you get your music?  Do you still hit the brick and mortar or do you Torrent, or do you Rapidshit (Rapidshare)?

3.  Do you prefer solo hip hop or a crew?

4.  What other music styles catch your ears like Hip Hop?

myself?

1.  More underground than mainstream but I will admit to liking some mainstream songs.

2.  I'm almost 90% into rapidshit now.  It's hard to find good underground on Torrent unless they've already gained a level of popularity.  Brick and Mortar doesn't work because small local bands in San Fran (for example) aren't going to be selling albums in Toronto.

3.  I go through phases.  Right now I'm digging listening to a crew.

It is a nice find, and I would like to add a couple of recommendations:



eMC - The Show

O.C. - Word... Life

Artifacts - That's Them...

Artifacts - Wrong side of the tracks

Cunninlynguists - Southern underground

Heavy D &amp; The Boyz - Peaceful Journey (Because of Don't curse!)

Blueprint- 1988

Jedi Mind Tricks - Servants in heaven, Kings in hell

Mobb Deep - The Infamous (obligatory)

Pince Paul - Prince among thieves

The Beatnuts - Street Level

Victor Vaughn - Vaudeville Villain

Odd Squad - Fadanuf Fa Erybody


I know there's tons of more, but I couldn't be bothered to write more of them down! 


P.S.: If I could ask for a favour in return, it would be a link to the Soulmatic album, the Stillmatic Nas album with production by Soul Supreme, and speaking of Soul Supreme, if anyone got a link to the discontinued Starchild album by O.C. That album contains a wild song, 1nce angain with production by Soul Supreme... "	t5_2qh2e	True

Here's my (admittedly unconventional) vote:

Yours?

**UPDATE:**  Not sure why someone who was a rights-holder decided to call ""Terms of Use Violation.""

Anyhow, the song was ""Debo the Game,"" by Sticky Fingaz.  The song's much better than average, but the  _video_ is pure art.

I hope _this link_ will continue to work:  http://vimeo.com/1530679?pg=embed&amp;sec=1530679
