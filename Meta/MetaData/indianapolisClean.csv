1347500846.0	zsspa	Someone stole the moped I've had since 1992.	taburl	502	73	251	"At some time overnight on 9/11 - 9/12, someone stole [my 1989 Tomos A3 Bullet moped](http://i.imgur.com/GgshN.jpg) from my carport where it was chained with two padlocks.  
  
I was getting into my car this morning when I thought, ""Hey... wait a second..."" and noticed that the old-school moped I've treasured since I was 11 years old was stolen from the carport of my apartment. The only thing left behind was one cut link of chain.  
  
I'm sure it isn't worth a whole lot to pawn or scrap, but I have kept this thing running for 20 years, so I'm extremely attached to the darn thing. My older brother and I saved &amp; saved forever to buy it back in 1992, and I even have the original paperwork still in fine condition.  
  
I have filed a police report and the folks at the leasing office claim they will review security camera footage. I would sincerely appreciate any tips or information anyone else might have."	t5_2rtt2	True

The light turned green but the car in front didn't move. I saw him inch up a little, and noticed there was an older fellow near the median that had fallen off his bike in the road and was having problems getting up. 

The car in front of me inched forward, I figured it was going to switch lanes and drive on once it could get over, and in my mind I thought of those videos you see online of people driving past a baby in the road, etc. I told myself if all these jerks were going to pass this guy by, then at least I would stop and help him up.

The car in front of mine inched up some more, put and blinkers on and at the same moment the driver opened his door, 4 or 5 other cars near the intersection opened their doors too to go help the guy. Traffic was at a stand-still both ways for a full minute at this green light during rush hour, but no one honked or yelled. They helped the guy and his bike to the sidewalk, made sure he was ok, and everyone got back in their cars and continued their drives home.

It was kind of amazing. Good job Hoosiers, you restored a bit of my faith in humanity today."	t5_2rtt2	True

I don't know if there are any devious political powers at play here, but from what I can see on their website, it'd be a huge improvement to Indy.  

They just updated on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/IndyConnectNow) that ""HB1011 on mass transit passes House Roads &amp; Transportation committee 11-1. The bill heads to Ways &amp; Means committee next.""  They're asking for people to sign the [petition](http://www.indyconnectnow.com/) on their website.

I'm excited about the prospect of being able to take transit to/around downtown, and having better/more routes available.  Do any of you know more about this?

**edit:**  Here's a [map](http://www.indyconnectnow.com/UserFiles//Image/EJ20A2dcpPg1fgDV7TV9SB-W6QIAoiRr4K6LZh1p5aM.jpg) of the full proposal (and some more [info](http://www.urbanindy.com/2013/01/10/indy-connect-shifts-into-high-gear/))."	t5_2rtt2	True

I live in Noblesville but drive downtown to fill up, I feel you guys are being arrogant by leaving your prices so high. Also how about an update to your Noblesville restaurant, so many possibilities.

Edit: I've been told [Fountain Square Brewery](http://www.fountainsquarebrewery.com) has $5 Sunday 

Edit2: Arrogant probably wasn't the right word

Edit3: It looks likes [Oaken Barrel](http://www.oakenbarrel.com/) has $5 Thursday

Edit4: I should of said this at first..The employees at Barley Island are VERY cool, always friendly.

Final Edit: Nothing but love to all Indiana breweries. Maybe I was short sighted in my desire to get $5 growlers from Barley Island. [erchamion](http://www.reddit.com/user/erchamion) gave me some good info to my ignorance on how breweries work. I look forward to Barley Island doing a redo to the interior.

I have a 7 month old female Beagle/Border Collie mix named Ginger. She's spayed,  housebroken, and is playful and energetic. I am in an emergency situation as I have been keeping in my car overnight but the weather is warming up and I can't keep her like that, obviously. The other thing is The Humane Society in Indy is booked solid since they don't euthanize for time and space here(a good thing). I was referred to the Animal Care and Control service here but since I don't have any proof of residency, I'd have to pay a $40(which I don't have) fee for them to take her. I really wish I could keep her but I'm too poor to have a lot of options. I'm told that if I could find someone with an Indianapolis ID, they could drop her off for free. I don't know anyone here yet so I could really use some help. Ideally, I'd like to have her go to a good home but I'm starting to panic. I had to leave her in the car just to come up to my room and type this. My wife is distraught about this whole situation so if anyone could please help. If you don't have a car I could pick you up and we could go down there together. All you would have to do is say it was your dog and you were dropping her off. Please, please, please, Indy. You guys have been so nice since I've gotten here. Please come through for me on this....

**UPDATE!!!**: We've found my girlie girl a temporary home where she can run in lots of space and play with other puppies!! A very special thanks to /u/iuhoosierkyle for letting her into his home and to whom I've scrounged together a few pennies to give some reddit gold(hint hint). My faith in humanity has been strengthened tenfold! Also thanks to everyone who upvoted, commented, wished her luck, and spammed their friends' Facebook timelines about this.

The committee chose to do it this way so that we could have correct numbers for food. Since they are providing meat, buns, paper products and drinks it is easier to coordinate and plan through a website that allows us to keep track of the actual number of people coming!** 


Here is the event information that is highlighted on the page to RSVP: 

**2013 Global Reddit Meetup Day is officially booked for June 15th from 3pm-Dusk**

We have a shelter house rented for the day at Paul Ruster Park (11300 E Prospect St, Indianapolis, IN). The idea behind this meetup is to celebrate the Reddit culture we have grown and fostered here in Indiana over the past several years. I know there are dedicated groups all over the state that have regular meetups but for one time a year we get the chance to come together and represent Indiana for the Global Reddit Meetup Day, so make sure you attend!

If you are a Reddit meetup seasoned vet you should be here!

If you are a lurker who has never made it out to a meetup event yet...you should be here!

If you are new to the area and want to me like minded people...you should be here!!

If you just heard of Reddit yesterday but think it is awesome...then you should be here!

This is your chance to come and connect with a great group of people who share the same interests as you! Everyone is welcome including kids!

*There is going to be a suggested $5 donation to help cover the costs of renting the shelter house, paper products and the drinks we will have available.*

**Here is what the planning committee is providing:**

-Paper Products (plates, cups, napkins, table clothes, forks/spoons)

-Meat (burgers, brats, hot dogs)

-Drinks (ice, 2 big 5 gallon containers of lemonade, water and iced tea)

-Music (Eric will be bringing out his dj gear to spin some tunes)

 

**Here is what we need from all of you to make this successful!**

*Please note the number of people RSVP'd about a week in advance so you know how much to make!!*

-Side Dishes (mac n cheese, potato salad, veggie trays, dips)
-Desserts

-If you want something other than lemonade, water and iced tea please feel free to bring a cooler! 

-Games and activities (I have corn hole, a washer game, hillbilly golf and random sports equipment like a volleyball and soccer ball)

-Raffle? (anyone have a cool company that would donate prizes, gift cards or something for a raffle?)

 

**Misc Info**

-There is a dog park connected to this specific park so feel free to bring your pooch is he/she is well behaved.

-There is a playground for the kids

-Tons of open field space for whatever activities we find ourselves wanting to get into...I am thinking a giant game of kick ball or wiffle ball needs to happen!!!

-Plenty of parking right next to our shelter house

-Access to outlets


So, lets kick off the conversation and get some hype going for Indiana's own Global Reddit Meetup! As of right now we are sitting at 26 people for the event on Meetup.com I want to see at least 50 people represented for a big group picture at 5:00PM!

**Edits May 20th**
-Took out BYOB. We are going to go ahead and follow the park rules when it comes to drinking alcohol. Details of the after party (which include a pool and private residence) will be made available for those interested the week before the meetup. Those wishing to partake in adult beverages should attend the after party! The reddit meetup group has been known to throw some great house parties! Bottom line is: Better safe than sorry and since this is going to be a kid friendly event the planning committee thought it best to abide by park rules! "	t5_2rtt2	True

This weekend is the NCAA tournament. This weekend is also when Jeff Garlin from Curb Your Enthusiasm appears live at Morty's for the first time.

Because we want Jeff to love Indianapolis, and because we know that many people will stay home glued to their TVs, I want to offer Redditors free tickets to any show this weekend. Cool, huh?

Just print out this page and show it to the box office. And they'll give you two free tickets to any show this weekend. Show up early since we better damn well be sold out. And show Jeff Garlin how great Indy can be?

Morty's is at 3625 E 96th St near Keystone Crossing. Have fun. 

**TL;DR** Print this out for two free tickets to Jeff Garlin this weekend."	t5_2rtt2	True

Originalluff	42	14	7	"Like the title says, I know this is a real shot in the dark...But today at Greenwood mall somewhere around 3:30pm a boy named Brandon collapsed onto one of the benches across from me beside Clarie's. When I asked him if he was OK, he said he was having severe chest pains and has a heart murmur. I ran to call security, who called paramedics, and then sat with him with a hand on his shoulder while we waited. He told me he's here all alone from (I believe) Oregon. He's 19, and his birthday is tomorrow. I never got his last name. He was probably taken to Community Hospital South, considering its only about 10 minutes away.

When the paramedics arrived, I had to step aside. I fished his wallet out of his pocket for him since he hurt too much to do it himself, handed it to the security officer beside me, and then I was shooed away. I wished him good luck, and said goodbye to him before he was wheeled off by paramedics. 

For some reason I really felt for Brandon. I much rather would have stayed with him to hold his hand or distract him from the pain or SOMETHING...But I couldn't. 

If I can, I'd like to find out how he's doing, and maybe bring him a small birthday gift. It sucks to be all alone. Especially when something like this happens. Does anyone out there in Reddit-land know a 19 year old Brandon who's turning 20 tomorrow?... Who is (probably) still holed up in the hospital tonight for a heart condition? 

Edit: I called the hospital and without a last name, they won't be able to find him. =( "	t5_2rtt2	True

On Saturday, 14 January 2012, a black 2003 VW Jetta was broken into at the Hyatt Place hotel near the Indianapolis airport. I'd just had it detailed, but it didn't look new or flashy by any means. It was dirty, with deep scratches on the trunk. Yet for some reason, it was still appealing enough for somebody to smash the rear window and ransack the backseat. Three bags were taken. One was a small black computer bag, one was a green backpack, and the third was a Samsonite carry-on. In these bags were several books all on the topic of death and two notebooks. One was a hardcover orange book with graph paper inside; the other was an embossed copper-covered notebook with a polar bear and the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 on the front. This was my thesis research. I'd managed to get only about a third of it digitized over break. I really, really, really need it back.


I am an anthropology student. I study human mortuary ritual and see how our reactions to death tell about the way we live our lives. The books that were stolen were necessary for my senior thesis, and the two notebooks contained research that I cannot replicate, as it would require traveling to London. This thesis is due in March. I don’t have time to go back to London. All I had was my research, which was taken from me while I was on vacation with my family. I’m mad as hell and incredibly upset. The thief didn’t touch my stereo, my GPS, or the credit card that I’d accidentally left in the front seat. He or she managed to make off with three bags, a $150 netbook, a disc drive, a wireless mouse, a signed copy of Kickass #2, a Cthulhu puppet, my tablet pen… and basically my life’s work. And as much as I’d love the other things back, I really only care about that last one.


Now, the books had monetary value, yes, but not enough to make the theft worthwhile. Trust me on this. I know.  I know this is a long shot, but if you, or anybody else knows anything about these books, please contact me at cmonesmi@nd.edu. I don’t care about the electronics or the luggage. I just want those books back… even just the two notebooks. Those are worth nothing to you or anybody else who’s not me. I won’t be pressing charges… I won’t even ask for a full name. I will pay for shipping back to me. If you or anybody you know has information about these books, please contact me.

The money we make from this event goes to pay for attorney training (i.e. this is how you cross examine an angry police officer, this is what you do when an officer searches your client's car without permission) and to help fund a Christmas party for the office. The event is open to the public and there is no dress code. (I'm really not sure why we call it a ""ball."") Just bring yourself and any legal questions you want answered by a host of very friendly attorneys. 

Reddit, this would be a fine way to support a group of people that spends everyday in the trenches fighting to give a voice to indigent defendants who otherwise could not defend themselves. Essentially, our credo is that one's quality of representation should not be a function of how much money you have in your pocket. If you like this idea, then here's your chance to support it.

My car got stolen Thursday...	kloot	26	2	15	My car, well technically my brother's car that I have been driving, a [1996 white Buick Century](http://i.imgur.com/pFdcT6S.jpg) was stolen Wednesday night into Thursday morning from [The Lodge at Trails Edge apartments](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=9460+Benchview+Drive,+Indianapolis,+IN&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=39.925184,-86.136659&amp;spn=0.001195,0.00284&amp;sll=39.926572,-86.138853&amp;sspn=0.00239,0.005681&amp;oq=9460+bench&amp;hnear=9460+Benchview+Dr,+Indianapolis,+Indiana+46240&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=A) off 96th and College Ave near the Monon at approximately 7:00am. It had the driver side window smashed out, an [IU sticker](http://i.imgur.com/bpKKhW8.jpg) in the back window, as well as a faded Carmel High School crosscountry sticker. There is rust in the wheel wells and paint missing from the back right bumper. License plate is Hamilton 590NGA. I filed a police report, but I would really like to have this car back! It had over $500 worth of diabetic insulin pump supplies in the trunk, as well as very expensive professional artist oil and acrylic paints valued around at least $200 as well. If anyone lives near the area in Ashton Brook, College Courts, Lakeside Pointe, or Nora Pines and sees a car fitting this description please let me know! There is also the possibility that my car was targeted and I was followed from around 46th and College just north of the fairgrounds. If anyone in the SoBro area sees a car like this as well please call the police and PM me! I need to find this car within 12 days or it's considered a total loss and I'm out a car, as well as the $500+ worth of medical supplies that I most likely won't be reimbursed for. Any help is greatly appreciated!	t5_2rtt2	True

Here are some resources for people struggling to care for their pets	slambradley	27	4	7	"FACE does low cost spay/neuter and vaccinations. Pit bulls, pit mixes, and anything even slightly resembling one can be fixed and vaccinated for $20. All others are done based on the animals size. $30-55. Cats are $20.
http://www.facespayneuter.org/fees.html
Food pantries: FACE also runs a pet food pantry

The Humane Society of Indianapolis also has low cost vaccinations and spay neuter 
http://indyhumane.org/index.php/services/spay_neuter_clinic

If you absolutely must give up your pet, please understand that animal control is currently at capacity and cannot take in many more animals. They will attempt to get all of them adopted or sent to rescue, but there is a very real possibility that your animal will be euthanized. Similarly, many rescues don't take owner surrenders so they can concentrate on injured strays and dogs pulled from the shelters.

Here are some guidelines for finding a new home
http://m.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/finding_responsible_pet_home.html

Also, there have many many cases in Indianapolis of people ""flipping"" dogs. They claim found pets as theirs then sell them on craigslist. They will also take free to good home pets and do the same. Some states have had people do this then sell them to laboratories, but I have not heard of it in Indiana."	t5_2rtt2	True
1372820969.0	1hjkhn	My experience with state senator Brent Waltz (R), district 36	matthewsmith1989	32	10	10	"I've been trying to get ahold of my state senator ever since Mike Pence announced that he would push for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman. In 2011, Brent Waltz voted for HJR 6, which would have done exactly that. Since this is a new legislative session, if Mike Pence wants to do that he would have to get a bill passed through the state congress again. Since there is a super majority of Republicans in the House and Senate, this probably wouldn't be that difficult. But for my representative, I was hoping to convince him not to vote again for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. 

The last time I talked to a staffer, he said that Senator Waltz was taking a vacation to Nevada and he wouldn't be back until after the 4th. To my surprise, tonight I received a call from Senator Waltz. It speaks volumes to me that he would call me on his vacation to talk about an issue that was important to me. 

What I found in Senator Brent Waltz was a reasonable, forthright, and honest legislator. To my great surprise, I found this in a Republican. I explained to him several different reasons why I believe it's a bad idea to vote for a constitutional ban on gay marriage for the state of Indiana. He conceded that I made very compelling arguments, but he was elected to represent the people of Indiana's 36th district. He was steadfastly convinced that, outside of his personal feelings on the matter, he would be representing the majority opinion in his district for voting in the affirmative. While I disagree with him that it really is the majority opinion in the district, I can respect the answer that he gave me. 

We talked for a good long while about policy and I asked him what I would have to do to convince him that this was not what his district wanted. I asked him how many people I would need to get in front of him to show that we care about this issue. He told me that in a district with 140,000 people in it, it's hard to gauge the will of his constituents based solely on a few thousand very passionate people. But wanting to be fair to me and the other constituents that believe the same way I do, he compromised and promised me that he would put on his district survey the question ""Should there be an amendment to the Indiana constitution that defines marriage as between one man and one woman?"".

This was extremely reasonable and fair. While I assured him that I was still going to work my hardest over the next year to convince him that voting for this again would be a bad move, I can respect that he was willing to test his own beliefs. 

He told me that he will be having town halls again in the fall, and encouraged me to come out and speak my mind. He also encouraged me to bring along as many people as I could to speak out about why marriage equality is something he should support. 

I can honestly tell you that after talking to Senator Brent Waltz for a good long while, he is a reasonable man that would be very open to changing his mind on this issue if we were able to convince him that the majority of his district believes strongly that his current vote would send Indiana in the wrong direction. 

I urge everyone in the 36th district to call his office and be persistent until you get a chance to talk with him. I started the conversation expecting him to put up his fists and prepare for a fight, and instead what I got was an open and honest exchange of ideas that I have not had with any other politician before. 

Also, if you would like to join my effort to convince senator Waltz that marriage equality is good for the state, please let me know and we can get organized. 

**TL;DR, Senator Brent Waltz is a great guy, but at the moment he's going to vote for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. I am completely positive that we can convince him to not do this. If you live in district 36, just read it. You'll be glad you did.** "	t5_2rtt2	True

So I was laid off about two months ago. I have been looking for a job since then but have had no luck. I'm not going to college since my family is not in a good economic state and did not want to put them or my self in a worse situation debt wise. Although my dream is to one day become a writer. (Yeah ik my grammar sucks and English is not my first language.)

A little back ground of me: I've work as customer representative for a law firm. I've also work for as an assistant for a staffing agency. I am ambitious, bilingual, have exelent work ethic, reliable. Transportation is not a problem for me. I wouldn't want to let my potential go to waste and work in a fast food restaurant but at this point I'm desperate. 

The reason why I'm coming to reddit with my issue is because there is an amazing group of people and I've seen great things happen. Again thanks for reading and just giving me like a location of a place that might hire me would be great. 

Have a great day and be careful with the thunder situation. :)

So I just got burglarized for a second time and I am trying everything I know to do to seek help for this, even though I know it's largely futile. In addition to all the measures I'm taking -- which I won't discuss publicly -- I'd also like to ask for your help keeping an eye out for some things that were stolen from my apartment. I know there's some downside to this but... after two burglaries...

Anyway, here's the rundown on things stolen. I'm not listing all details but all I'm asking is that you keep an eye out if you're on Craigslist or pawn shops or ebay or whatever. 

- 2 Kindle Paperwhites (I can identify the books and stuff on them)

- 1 11"" HP laptop (with some after-market hardware specs I can provide)

- 1 30 or 32"" Toshiba LCD TV with remote (bought in 2008, I've honestly forgotten the size)

- 1 pair men's size 11 snow boots. I can provide brand name and photos

- 7"" Android-based tablet (can give brand name, model, etc.)

- A very distinctive ""Republic of Gamers"" Asus 17"" laptop

I know this is unusual but I just want to track down my stuff as best I can.

1313459569.0	jk00l	Fake google reviews are actively pissing me off.	Cermo	24	1	9	"I was looking for a local Chrysler dealership to take my car in for service when I kinda slipped down the rabbit hole.  I know any rating or review system is going to be gamed to some extent, usually for profit and occasionally for revenge.  And if I'm being honest, I also know that I am emotionally unstable and tend to fly off the handle at things that really. don't. matter. that. much.

That said, I spent about an hour crawling through a web of google reviews with [this Chrysler dealership](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=949697568470560931&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0) as the starting point, and I found that most if not all of the 5-star reviews were fake.  

I came to this conclusion by clicking on the names of the reviewers and looking at reviews for other businesses they've posted.  A pattern quickly emerged.  Of the thirteen *reviewers* I looked at, 9 of them also glowingly reviewed [this pediatric dentist](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=2228671684341436819&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0), 8 of them loved [this animal hospital](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=1744588257233565434&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0), and 7 of them (though not necessarially the same 7) had wonderful experiences at [this Chevy place](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=11944914547138505385&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0), [this Honda place](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=5864924155666912039&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0), [this used car place](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=2881659202820154014&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0), and [this resort](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=2935906891269314052&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0).  Goddamn but I wish I was that rich.  It goes on and on.  Granite countertops?  Window replacement?  Feel like Italian tonight?  Nothing is sacred!

Why should you care?  Look pal, I don't know that you should.  Personally I'm annoyed because I liked using reviews on google to pick businesses, and I'm frankly simultaneously angry and sad at yet another reminder that anything and everything that can be misused for profit will be.  I guess that sounds pretty naive.  It wasn't news to me, it's just the *reminder* that's chapping my hide right now.

I know this isn't the most terrible injustice in the world, or even in Marion county, but if this annoys the lower-middle-class consumer in you, and you're looking to ""make a difference"" but want something a little more rookie-level than [Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn), maybe do your own exploring, maybe ""downvote"" the suspect reviews (was this review helpful? yes/no), maybe flag them.  I wrote reviews at the Chrysler place and the kid's dentist pointing out the hinkyness of the other posts, but that felt like pissing into the wind so I come here instead.  Maybe you write your own reviews?  Maybe you upvote mine?  Maybe you just go buy your car somewhere else?  Maybe you go buy a pound of ground beef and make a nice spaghetti dinner?  I don't know.

I think this is something worth discussing, r/indy.

I know, realistically, there's a certain ebb &amp; flow to the cycle of violence.  Some years are naturally more violent than others.  Some correspond to hot summers.  Some are nationwide trends.  Etc.  There are always outliers here, and always external factors worth discussing.

But I'm starting to get really concerned about elevating violence in Indianapolis, particularly as incited by urban youth who are out past curfew and starting fights which tend to escalate into more serious matters.

I know, to an extent, this has always been a problem.  You need only look at the demise of somewhere like Lafayette Square Mall.

But this year, I can remember this being a huge issue that was starting to surface at Castleton Square Mall, as well as re-surface at Circle Center after IMPD &amp; related gang task forces had done an excellent job policing this problem for so long.

Now, it seems like any time there's a major event downtown -- 4th of July, Black Expo, etc. -- someone gets killed/shot/severely beaten.  Brawls are breaking out.  Generally, really concerning things are happening.

I don't have any easy questions or answers to ask here, just moreso opening this up for discussion...

Is this really a problem, or just part of a cycle you see in certain years, or overblown by media?

Do you feel unsafe downtown now?  During major events?

Is it fair to say this is an ""urban youth"" problem?  What does that imply?  What are we comfortable admitting here, if anything?  Seems to be, making careless or baseless accusations won't solve anything, but figuring out the demographic most in need of an action plan here would.

What can be done to curb this violence, realistically?

Is this a youth problem?  Policing problem?  Parenting problem?  Community problem?  Reminded of recent Indy Star op-eds essentially placing this on black community faith leaders for not being vocal enough, but I'm curious what common consensus here is?

What is the solution to this problem, or your best guess anyway?

What must we absolutely avoid?


Like I said, really want to get a dialogue going.  It's a sensitive subject, but a very real one, and I don't mean to frame this any particular way.  Just curious to hear what people think about this trend of violence."	t5_2rtt2	True

I was originally born in Los Angeles but we moved here to get away from the (at that time and sorta this time too) economically crumbling California. I didnt expect much excitement at first, but as i grew older and more mature, I've noticed a lot of small things about this state. This whole state feels like its one large community. The other day, I saw a commercial about how Hoosiers always willing to volunteer and help each other and I will stand by that. I've always tried to denounce Indy because I was born in Los Angeles, and even though my heart will always be with the Lakers, I will forever be a Hoosier. This city offers so much that many other big cities cant. As a positive pothead, i feel that people are generally more lenient when it comes to bud. I've never once been caught and hope not to, but other people will smell it and just shrug it off or joke around with us or something. Some of my friends have been caught with pot too, and the punishment is either very light or none at all. I love to think that we're probably the most chillest state out there, and im glad to be living ""the Crossroads of America."" But I've had my fair share of asshole cops and people, but if you're in the heart of thriving and caring community, there are people who are generous and loving to welcome you with open arms. If you let this state grow on you, you'll grow with them. So let's keep showing these other states what's up, Hoosiers."	t5_2rtt2	True

1371491398.0	1gj106	My experience in Indy	Yellow_STDs	19	1	10	This all happened right at the end of my semester, so only a month or so ago. Our lacrosse team made the quarterfinals, which happened to be played at Lucas Oil, and not going to lie, we were a little skeptical of going to a town in Indiana instead of a traditional east coast location like Boston or Philly. I was blown away. Now forgive me for the awful description, but the tall point statue and layout of the city was what really got me. It felt to me like a good mixture between an old european town and a modern american town, with monuments, statues, offices, skyscrapers, and an overall beautiful layout. We went to St. Elmos steakhouse where I had one of the best meals I've had in years. We had some time to kill the night before the game so we walked from our hotel to the steak n shake/movie theatre corner in what appeared to be the heart of downtown, got some milkshakes, and just sat near that corner people watching. All kinds of unique and multi-purposed people passed us. Couples on date night, girls going to a prom, kids going to a movie, families going to dinner etc. Everything felt so friendly and welcoming. Lucas Oil was a hell of a stadium to be at let alone play in. I plan on going there when I can have a little more fun and get to see the city a little more, but overall a very nice surprise. Keep it up Indy. 	t5_2rtt2	True
1371481941.0	1gip0z	Would you trust this guy again?	Moses_Scurry	24	6	8	We built an Estridge home one year before they went bankrupt. Our three year warranty was eliminated, and we still have expensive repairs needed that would have been covered. Furthermore, most of these repairs were identified before the bankruptcy, but because they knew what was coming, Estridge procrastinated on doing them until it was too late. Many contractors were either never paid or were paid a very small percentage of what they were owed. Our neighbors had $30,000 in escrow for their landscaping that was wiped out. Everyone deserves a second chance, but if you still have messes left over from your first chance, you should fix them before you get the second in my opinion.	t5_2rtt2	True

It's going to be a great time to be a Star Wars fan, but there's some really awesome stuff happening in our area that you can be a part of right now.

Ever see the toy drives at Scotty's Brewhouse (next one is at the 96th St. location Tuesday, June 19th) with the Stormtroopers guarding the toy boxes? Did you get your picture taken with Jedi opening weekend of the 3D release of The Phantom Menace or on Free Comic Book Day? Where did Weird Al find a pair of Tusken raiders?

All those costumed people are members of Bloodfin Garrison of the 501st Legion (the bad guys) and/or Mos Espa Base of the Rebel Legion (the good guys). We're the local chapters of international organizations that use our costumes for both fun and to benefit children through volunteer and charity work. You can read more about us at [our website](http://www.starwarsindiana.com) or our parent organization websites: [501st Legion](http://www.the501st.com) and [Rebel Legion](http://www.rebellegion.com).

Aside from spreading geeky joy at events, we also love getting new people involved. There are lots of resources and helpful members. The sewing and painting is all worth it when a kid recognizes you. With such a major event in the area next year, right now is a really good time to start getting involved.

Events we have done recently:

*Valparaiso Music Festival

*Hoosier Valley Railway Museum Star Wars Weekend

*Toy drives for Scotty's Brewhouse

*Greenwood Relay for Life

*Summit City Comic Con

*May the Fourth Be With You at the City Market

I'll be monitoring this thread, so feel free to ask any questions here or hop over to [our forums](http://www.starwarsindiana.com) and register there. You can also request our presence at an event via our website.

We're also on Facebook:

A few people and I are looking for a trivia team!

We were in the lead the first 4 rounds, but other teams of 4-8 people started beating our asses with the added brain power, so I figured why not see if any other redditors wanted to join up and form a giant braintrust? Doesn't have to be a weekly thing, can keep it casual, but I think it'd be a great idea to get r/Indy to mingle amongst ourselves for those of us who can't make it to the Friday night meetups.

I moved up here with my husband about 9 months ago. We live just below 38th on a one of the nicer, busier streets.

So, I was riding home on my bike. I got about a block away from our fourplex, and there was a car at the end of the block, and the windows were down, and there were two black gentlemen in the front seat. I usually acknowledge everyone I meet, as I have been informed this is appropriate in the inner city ( whether false or true I don't know). Usually I do so with a nod or a wave from my handle bar, but because I was so close, I actually spoke when the passenger looked at me, and said, ""Good afternoon, sir.""

This may have been a mistake.

I was slow-followed home by the car. Luckily, there were telephone workers outside. I turned in the driveway and they stopped on the street and watched. Quickly, I turned behind the house, put my bike in the garage, and got inside.

Alright, reddit, I know I did something wrong. What is it? Was it speaking? I come from a very different culture, so I honestly need the advice on how to conduct myself.

I'm a short, blonde, blue-eyed white girl, if that helps.

I discovered the station about a year ago and am now addicted to it. Indy's FM radio scene is pretty scarce, and if it wasn't for 91.9, I'd probably break down and buy XM. (They're from Zionsville, so the reception can get questionable as far south as I am)

Their tagline is ""Unpredictable,"" which is pretty accurate. I can't recall hearing the same song more than twice, ever. In terms of genres, they do a lot of 
oldies--that is, blues, jazz, rock, country and pop from the 1930s (no joke) up through the 60s. They also do a fair amount of classical, contemporary European hits, short comedy recordings, and ""indie rock."" They have a few set programs; one of their locally-produced ones is the ""Rockin' Rhythm Revue,"" which focuses on early blues and rock n' roll, as well as ""Woodsongs,"" which is a bluegrass and folk show from Kentucky. You can peep at their [website](http://www.919witt.org/) to get a taste of the last-played songs. In terms of variety, it blows my fall-back station, WTTS, out of the water. (Bonus: they play very little classic rock)

As you can tell from their website, they seem to be a kind of boot-strapped operation. My guess is that most of the show hosts are volunteers. They do ""underwriting,"" not commercials, and not many of them at that. They accept donations as well but I'm not sure how all their finances come together.

It's all very quaint and local and I love it.  Anyway, just thought I'd share. "	t5_2rtt2	True

Our I.T company has grown out of the home office, but what I found to be a perfect space, has a couple downsides.

**Pros**

Location - Castleton Area, close to shopping, highways, food, etc..

Layout - End Unit, only one neighbor. One large, private office. Two or possibly three offices total. I don't necessarily need the door at first. One bath with a shower. A few different areas for storage.

**Cons**

Price - After utilities, Internet, phones, and whatnot, the total will be hitting $1,000/mo. I'm looking to split that 50/50, or come to some other agreement based on how the unit is split. I'm not opposed to bartering.

Property Condition - Nothing disgusting or that requires major work, but there are some cosmetic improvements to do be done. Paint and trim work mostly.

Clearly, the ideal business would need to be fairly small, and work primarily from a desk- Accountant, Lawyer, Realtor, etc..

If this is you, or someone you know that is looking to move, please let me know. I won't disclose the details of the location, for fear of it being snatched up, until meeting with the other business owner.

1364785493.0	1beccf	Pedestrians &amp; Cyclists of Indy: Are you visible to drivers at night?	stgnet	18	4	26	"I just had a disturbing experience - while driving home this evening through Broad Ripple, had a (presumably drunk) person yell at me to stop and call me an asshole.  He was walking along the Monon Trail, and as I reached the ped crossing yelled very loudly, upset that I hadn't stopped for him.  I was following a line of cars, it was dark and had been raining, and I heard this individual before I saw him.  From what little glance I got in passing, he appeared to be wearing a dark hoodie and no reflective clothing whatsoever.  Why he wasn't lit sufficiently for me to notice is unclear, but it left me disturbed enough that I wanted to go back and both apologize for the unintended slight and explain that he simply wasn't visible -- but there was other oncoming traffic, and I thought better of trying to talk to somebody both upset and likely drunk.

This experience is part of a disturbing trend I have noticed around town: pedestrians and bicyclists out at night, in the dark, wearing dark clothing, and walking or biking along or across an unlit or dimly lit portion of roadway.  There has been numerous times in the last year that I have been scared out of my wits to come across someone at the last moment - usually but not always out of my direct line of travel, but close enough to be surprising and quite the adrenalin rush.  Jaywalking pedestrians is one thing (almost hit somebody the other day because they stepped out into a lane I was changing into) - but this lack of concern about crossing roads at night is going to get somebody hurt or killed - and I don't want to contribute to such a painful experience.

Please for the love of whatever you hold dear (and your own life) take a moment before stepping or riding onto any pavement and consider:

1) Am I visible?  Do I have light colored clothing on?  Something reflective?  Flashlight in my hand even?

2) When biking, do I have lights on front and rear of bike, and are they on?  This is actually a law about using lights when biking at night, BTW!

3) Do I see any cars on the road?  Note that you may not always HEAR cars anymore, thanks to electric cars, but you should at least see headlights approaching you.  If so, get off the roadway or duck behind a non-moving object (like a parked car).  And: don't presume the car will stay in the same lane!

4) Is there overhead streetlights?  Is the area well lit?  Is there bushes or anything that would obstruct the driver's view of me?

5) How busy is the road I'm about to travel?  How fast do the cars travel on it?  Can I take an alternate road or stay on a sidewalk to avoid higher traffic areas?

Seriously people, please take a moment and consider it from the driver's point of view, and don't presume you're safe - even on a crosswalk for a trail that is closed at night.  And recognize that it's more likely your fault than the car driver's if they don't see or stop for you - but you will be just as hurt or dead either way.

I don't make it to this mall much, so when I do, I make sure to check out the Arcade since it's the only one left in this area. 

Much to my surprise as I walked in, I noticed for sale signs on every game. Indy 500 4 car setups with screens, Nascar 2 car setups, House of the dead style shooters, LARGE fighting game cabinets, newer fighting games running off PS3 or 360s, but in sit down cabinets. The whole nine...

The prices seemed to range from $10 Grand all the way down to $350 for a super Large SNK Chaos machine. If I had the transport and the room in the house, that cab would have came home with me yesterday.

If anyone is interested you should check it out, or at least give them a call. The address and number are as follows.

1339482843.0	uxke8	A Monumentous Day for the Indianapolis Indians.  Spatulas Everywhere. 	bamb00zled	19	4	19	"The first two individuals I met at the Reddit Meetup had staked the place out early. They both ((not sure what the policy is on IRL names on here)) greeted me amicably as I sat down, sans blanket, on grass that I was sure had been planted by the Gods of baseball themselves.  Small talk ensued. Quick wits and such. 

As game time drew closer and arrived, a plethora of Redditors - all of whom were generally engaging and interesting - showed up.  The total tally was about 10.  The alcohol (I tend to take the Anthony Bourdain approach to public events) was prohibitively expensive, but the hot dogs were inexplicably cheap. We had met up near the Captain Morgan pavilion, which sold four kinds of Sun King.  Hooray beer!

If you want to save yourself money on drinks, being super sneaky is apparently a good idea, but you never heard it from me. And I never heard it from Natasha on Rocky and Bullwinkle...

----

We applauded the multiple succinct plays of the Indians. They truly seemed to be firing on all pistons, if one could use such a cliché term. And I did. I am already thinking of a better one. ""They were bopping on all cat noses."" .... Still needs work.



Of course, being on the lawn, you get the local idiosyncrasies inherent in any public setting; spatulas were given away; children scampered around rather scamperetously, large chicken-sandwich-promoting-cows were denounced for their bigoted agenda (Apparently, Chick-Fil-A hates chicks that fill vajays, and by that I mean that they're quite against any non-hetero-stuff), and a guy with $5,000 worth of cameras told a joke that took like 3 solid minutes to pull off. He nailed it though... Kinda. I, for one, welcome interesting people.

----

The place was alive with an interesting crowd, all observing a particular spectacle; the conversations and numbers were inconsequential. It was a place to be, at a place in time. The fact that it was a Monday seemed lost for that small venture, when the Indianapolis Indians decimated the Rochester Red Wings. *(I was too inebriated to know for sure that that's who they played). It really wasn't even close. We reveled in the almost cartoonishly lopsided score, before saying our goodbyes and parting ways.

----

Reddit Meetup Level: Success.

Stop by next time!  I know I will.

1.  Get a place that has reservations and more accessible parking.
2.  Ask for separate checks ahead of time (although after talking with the waiter after everyone left he said even if I would've asked he would've printed out the ticket the same way)
3.  Someone tell me where you guys are going after I clear the checks if you're going to drink! :)
4.  Walking to my car at midnight with roughly 240 dollars in cash makes one much more paranoid than usual.

Apart from being excited for the move, I had a few questions I wanted to ask, and also thought it be pertinent to introduce myself to the Indianapolis reddit community.

We have lots to do in preperation, but i've left my job already, so I have full time planning ability (aside from applying for jobs in Indy (I'm currently a Marketing Manager for a tech firm and hope to find something similar).

**CARS**:


We need to buy 2 cars pretty soon upon arrival.  Budget is about $20-30k per car.  I'd mused at getting something sporty (350z, Camaro, etc), but I'm worrying about the weather and managing with a powerful RWD car.

 - Are there any car dealer redditors that would be interested in talking to me?  I'm wagering we can get a good deal from the necessity to buy 2 cars in very close proximity to one another.

 - How often does it snow in Indy?  Does the snow maintain on the ground for the Winter season or does it fully thaw between snow falls? Do I NEED a AWD/FWD car or would a RWD be okay?

 - Any recommendations on good cars to buy in that price bracket?  Most the cars are different from USA to UK


**HOUSING**:

So upon arrival we'll have to rent somewhere until we have settled a bit and seen the area and made sure we're comfortable for the long term. We've done some research and the following areas seemed nice:

- Broad Ripple
- Carmel
- Fisher

Broad Ripple sounded good for socialising and being in a vibrant area. We're 28 &amp; 26, so we're not adverse to more... 'active' areas... the suburbs probably aren't going to be ideal on day one.  Also, we've sold most of our furnishings, so we're going to be looking to move to somewhere which is furnished initially.  If anybody has any ideas of good areas, developments etc that would be suitable, please let me know!  Also, we have a [small dog](http://winstonken.wordpress.com/) so would have to be suitable to keep him there.



**HOTELS**:

Upon arrival in town, we're going to need a hotel for like, a week until we have an apartment/house lined up. Needs to be pet friendly for small animals, decent quality but not ridiculously expensive. Any suggestions?



**JOBS**:

I need to start looking for a job in Indy, so does anybody know any good recruitment agencies?

Alternatively, are there any big technology (hardware or software) companies, or alternately, security hardware/software companies in the area that would be good to look into?  /EDIT: I actually work in marketing.  My Last job was Marketing Manager for a tech firm (Surveillance Hardware &amp; Software), so as much as I appreciate the IT tips, they're not 100% relevant).

Almost everyone likes to drink, so let's get a list of all of the bars/pubs/clubs in Downtown Indy and Broad Ripple or wherever else and make a combined list of all of their drink specials or even live music on certain nights.

*Wednesday:
Kilroys, again!

UPDATE!!!  confirmation at Scottys in downtown Indianapolis at 4:30pm today, Saturday August 13th, reservation is under JONES.  hope to see a good group there!

Hey guys and girls - 

so, Gen-Con got me really fired up to want to get back into gaming, and finding a good group of peeps out there that are looking for a good laid back fun social group to get in with.  [I took the idea from this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/jcjfs/post_gencon_2011_meetup/) and put up a new event on the Indianapolis meetup calendar for this Saturday.  The time and place is flexible, as I'm relatively new to the area, if you have any suggestions please post them up!

link to the meetup:
http://www.meetup.com/reddit-indianapolis/events/28820911/


Edit:  Hey everyone -

if you are going, or at least would LIKE, and might even be able to, please RSVP on the meetup page. this will help us know how much space we're going to need, plus how many games.

thanks! :)


Edit 2:  xnorange is checking to see if we can get a place to play.  Hopefully he/she (sorry! :) ) can confirm what's available.  I'll keep working with him and will post up here and on the meetup as soon as we have more info.

EDIT 3: Hey everyone:  we still do NOT have confirmation on a place yet.  if anyone has any suggestions, please msg me or post them up ASAP.  I personally don't know the area well enough, so if you have any ideas, please let us know.

Edit 4:  I tried contacting Saltire games, they are booked solid saturdays.  I'm going to call Arsenal game room later tonight, see what they have.


Edit 5: I have not heard back from xnorange at all about his efforts to find us a place.  I've also called every gaming place I could find in Indy, and they are all booked solid (figured they would be on saturdays on short notice).  I have given this a good deal of effort to find a place, but I've run out of ideas, and I do NOT know the indy area well enough to pick a random spot that would be good for us."	t5_2rtt2	True

If you bought tickets for the Deluxe they're still good. We just needed room for the [Wheel of Christmas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-4q1XR4Ec). 

As we're kind of a local label, it'd be great if you could help us get the word around. This would be one of the larger venues Sufjan is playing and we need help filling the space. 

The show so far has been nothing short of fantastic. We promise you'll remember it for many Christmesses to come. The price is right too ($20+crazy ticketmaster fees). 

Tickets are here:

I just found out tonight that myself and two others are driving in from Columbus, Ohio for the Indy 500 tomorrow morning.  These two others are from Brazil and speak little English, in case you are interested.

Anyways, I am trying to secure some parking.  I am willing to pay to park, and also looking for a place to perhaps meet a few other redditors. I imagine my car will be arriving around 10am. I saw atheos's post about parking, and I'll be texting him around the time that I leave.  However, on the off chance that his place is full, I would love to have a backup to ensure that I get a good spot.

If you have anything, please PM me back or give me a text/call at [redacted].

Thanks a lot, and I'm really looking forward to my first time in Indianapolis tomorrow!  Also any suggestions that you may have for the race are welcome!

Figured we'd give Reddit first crack.

**We're located on the west side, 56th street right off I-465.**

This is all ""free"", if you can use it and can come get it, it's yours. We will probably be trashing this stuff otherwise. I say ""free"" because there is some value to this so from my experience with stuff like this before, some of you will say ""well shit, have $5-20, I don't want to just take it"". That is gratefully accepted, but if you want to just take it that is ok too, we just hate to toss this stuff out.

**You must come get it, before this coming Saturday evening.** We're on a pretty tight schedule with our move unfortunately.

If you want to claim something or if you want pictures, PM me with your cell # or email address and I can send a picture over from my phone.

* ~~All kinds of ""trip room"" lighting -&gt; blacklights, plasma sculpture, oil light projector, electrical wall hangings, etc. If you are interested in this please take it all, I have a bunch of it from my college years and would rather you take it and all trash anything you don't want on your own than get into a piece-by-piece analysis. If you like the high times you would enjoy this set of things~~

* Mr. Beer kit + plenty of empty soda bottles+caps to fill up. I've got the instructions and everything, all you need is to buy the refill kits to make your own beer.

* ~~old fat PS3 that has suffered from YLOD, been professionally re-balled and yet another YLOD. If you are a PS3 techy guy and wants an old one to try to repair, or get a working HDD or Blu Ray drive out of, this is all yours. It currently turns on and immediately YLOD's, but the disc drive and HDD should work fine.~~

* Fireplace stuff - fire screen, log carrier, Duraflame fire starting sticks

* Automatic cat / small dog feeder. We got a newer one since, this is a 6-tray feeder set to rotate on a timer, runs on a 9V battery

* ~~Crock pot~~

* Watercolor kit - a large book-looking thing, unused, that I guess teaches you how to start with watercolor art. Something my wife got but never used

* ~~8 or 10 or so glass Mason jars~~

* partially used box of Plaster of Paris

* Two sets of downhill snow skis + set of poles (might request $ for the nicer of the pair)

* Baby stuff - ~~baby swing (negotiable $ for this, as we would consign otherwise)~~, pink/purple party supplies (minnie mouse), white noise generating machine, ~~pack-and-play (one board in the base is broken, kids wouldn't notice/care though), Baby Bjorn chest carrier~~

* We also have a lot of clothing, I'm a male 5'8"" with clothes and business suits to give away that would fit someone around 125-130 lbs (I used to have a skinny waist before drinking beer all the time, ha!), and my wife is ~ size 8 and has a lot of clothing as well. We've ""been there"" before so if you need clothes we can hook you up with no questions asked, summer, winter, whatever, we want to help our fellow redditors.

* A pair of well-used bookshelf speakers (Sony brand maybe?). They aren't audiophile quality but if you need some bookshelves to bang out some tunes, these have been through some crazy parties. They're so awesome in fact I recall one of them is either missing a tweeter or has it held in with scotch tape. There might still be a center channel floating around as well but I haven't located that yet so it may have seen the end of it's life a few years back during our last move. Eye hooks are already in the back for easy wall mounting to a wall anchor, hinge+wire tie.

Further Edit: Based on spot checking what's available on Craigslist last night, I don't think cost is going to be much of an issue. Right now we pay $1200/month in Grand Rapids, MI, and would like to stay around that area. Almost every place that popped up in the search in the downtown area was under $1000 though.

We did find one place that looks promising: Abington Apartments near Georgetown and 47th. Has anyone lived there before that could give us an opinion? Or just anyone near that area who might know how the quality of living might be? We're not extremely picky, but I'm getting very frustrated reading reviews online that are obviously posted by the apartment itself.

Edit: Just to qualm some confusion: money isn't tight. We watch what we spend. Theoretically, I could go over $500, but I'm not going to because that is what is the most comfortable for us. We would like to have children in the near future (not immediate, obviously), we have loans we want to pay off early, and all the usual things people save up for. I know there are decent places to live within our budget. I'm not going to stretch out of my comfort zone because I don't believe I have to.

-Bike friendly building
-Laundry facilities on site (I'd prefer to have W/D in the unit, but I'm flexible.)

I was never served properly, and have proof that the debt was paid long before any judgement was ever entered. My problem is living in Indy and the court case being in NY, finding a lawyer has been tough. I don't have a lot of money for a lawyer, nor a lot of time at this point (the case is in 3 weeks). I've already spoken with the judge and she is willing to settle the matter by phone.

I've been looking for a home for him for the past 4 months. He has a bite history and as soon as that is out in the open, he's instantly denied foster care. I've had a few leads come up cold and at this point, he might have to be euthanized if a home isn't found. 

These pictures are a few years old but he looks the same. He is fixed, cropped tail, natural ears. He likes to play and wants to spend more time outside. Needs a home with lots of love, play time, walks, etc. He's pretty lazy now because of the lifestyle he has at my house, but if you let him run free he'll run around until he sleeps for hours. Has been to the play day thing at Barkefellers on the southside, they ran screening on him and he passed. Has always been good with their handlers and the dogs he interacted with there. I can get more information on his bite history as requested.

1319506497.0	lnueg	Haunted House Review - Necropolis	rickscarf	12	0	1	"Just got back from [Necropolis](http://www.darkarmies.com/necropolis-haunted-house/index.html), located in the Dark Armies paintball warehouse on the east side of town near I-70 / I-465 at Shadeland Ave. I won a pair of combo tickets for all 3 attractions, which was nice because the tickets are pretty pricey - but I'd say it'd be worth the price, because of the size of the facility and number of actors involved.

Without giving any spoilers away, you can buy tickets to individual attractions, or a combo ticket that gets you through all 3 in a fairly seamless manner. We went on a weeknight and there was no line to speak of, but I've heard it can be up to a 2 hour wait depending on the night you go. Good atmosphere to make for a tolerable wait, though.

The main event is Necropolis, the City of the Dead. Our initial group was greeted by a ghoul, informed of the rules and inside the building is where the line actually starts. They send in each group a few minutes apart so you can go more or less at your own pace, which is nice. All of the effects and actors were well-done, you can tell they had an eye for detail and made sure there was a twist around every corner. The actors do not touch you (apparently a HUGE concern to the high school girls behind me, they asked like 5 times while the rules were being explained) but they are numerous and pop out to scare you often. Plenty of high-tech effects with lighting, LCD panels, pneumatics etc, as well as good old-fashioned dudes jumping out behind you. This portion of the combo we did lasted approximately 15 minutes.

Next we did the Zombie Inn, which while interesting and not bad in-and-of-itself, was the weakest of the 3 tours. I won't give away the big spoiler of it, but I will say that nothing during the evening especially scared or surprised me but I did smile once I figured out what was going on in this event because I definitely was tricked by the psych out it surely intended to create. They probably wouldn't do it for all groups or couples, but since I was there was my bro there was a divide and conquer involved in the mystique, and I ended up getting through the Zombie Inn quite a bit faster than he did. Luckily for me they planned on this, and I got to be involved in a bit of planned one-on-one time with an actor to make sure I was entertained while waiting on him. This particular actor, a mad scientist, was my favorite actor of the night hands down. Great sense of humor, and even freaked me out for a split-second later on because he called me by name and I forgot that I told him earlier. Plenty of memorized lines I'm sure, but I could also tell he was quick-witted and throwing out some of his material on the fly which was awesome. The Zombie Inn takes approx. 7-12 minutes to get through depending on the speed of your group.

Last was the Dark Terrors tour, this was really a unique event I haven't seen before in a haunted house. No spoilers here because they tell you on their webpage but the gimmick of this one is they give each group one flashlight, but they can control the brightness and turn it on/off remotely. I was kind of bummed at one point because I think they messed it up and we walked through darkness in one room I could tell was really well designed so we didn't get to see it, but overall the gimmick worked pretty well and created a nice eerie feeling to what is otherwise a quality haunted house tour. They could've done a lot more with the effect, maybe a total darkness room with wind machines or strobe effects, but they did a pretty good job and I would recommend checking it out. I think this tour took us about 10 minutes to get through.

Overall I'd say it would be a good value for the price and would recommend it. I went to Hannah House last year and enjoyed that one as well, to compare the two I'd say Hannah House is a bit spookier, but Necropolis is much more polished in terms of the effects and is very large (I think I read somewhere 30,000 sq feet?). I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have; I'm not sure there are spoiler tags on reddit, but if you have a possible spoiler question feel free to PM me.

* Since we're on a budget, we're not keen on the idea of being forced into catering by the venue we use.  Since the reception isn't immediately following a wedding, we were hoping for a more informal 'Hors d'oeuvres' type of food catering, which we may end up doing ourselves or having friends help with.
* Having a provided cash bar would be ideal.  Alcohol catering prices are ridiculous, not to mention the annoyances of needing a liquor license.  Not all of our guests will be imbibing, so giving guests the option to purchase drinks would work best.

Any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!"	t5_2rtt2	True

I am not new to the city, but this will be the first time I actually rent a place instead of crashing with my friends. 

I'm a single, 25y/o male without any pets, but I have to move as soon as possible- probably this weekend. My job is very close to the Palladium in the Carmel Arts District and I've budgeted around $1000/month in rent.

The question I'm having is, should I move downtown for the social scene and bite the bullet on the commute, move to Carmel and bite the bullet on the social scene, or should I split the difference and live in Broad Ripple?

There are not many 1br apartments available in the city at the moment, and even fewer in Broad Ripple. There are plenty of 1br apartments in Carmel, but I feel like that's because it's mostly families. Is this true? Will I be marooning myself on the north side, without anyone my age, if I move to Carmel?

I'm starting to get rumblings from my roommate who's the main leaseholder that I might be booted out because I'm not officially on the lease.

I learned last week that the other roommate who IS on the lease, may be losing his job because suspended license and $200 fee. SO... with that in mind...

Can I ask you fine Redditors for help in apartment searching? I'm on SSI, am hard-of-hearing and I have an extremely limited amount of funds.

Also... WHY IS THE SOCIAL SERVICES DIVISION SO RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO GET AHOLD OF VIA PHONE?!

I'm also probably going to need help in getting moved to the new apartment... but that'll come once I've narrowed down the search.

My requirements:
Must have high speed internet access... it's the only way I communicate to the world via computer.
Must have at least 2 or more bus lines close or on the streets by apts.

Budget: $200-500. I'd prefer electricity/gas be included in the rent... if at all. 2-bedroom? Small or large is OK... but I intend to have a roommate in to help split the bills in the next few months.

I'm just overwhelmed by all of this as I'd just moved here last year November and have yet to fully get caught up on things around here. I... to be honest... I'm getting really tired of the apparent streak of bad luck I'm rolling on. I need help, and in a really bad way.

Searching online isn't getting me too many answers. I moved here from my northern city quite a few months ago and I am looking to move my guy here... but I am limited by a few things (I am well aware I may have to budge on all these things):

* I am on a budget, so I need a place that is pretty affordable or at least lenient on pricing (I am paying around $200 now and wouldn't mind cleaning stalls every couple days, or other barn duties)

* I have a gelding and he does NOT do well with mares. He thinks he is QUITE the charmer,  but they all can't seem to stand him haha. Even in different pastures, when he has been separated from mares, it has posed a problem. I realize this may not be possible but it's DEFINITELY preferable.

* I really would prefer a small (in all honesty, private) barn with relatively few horses. Where he is now, there is only one other gelding (used to be 4 total but the others have moved) and I love it, and believe that is the most perfect scenario for him given past experiences.

An indoor arena is desirable but not a deal breaker for the right place. I would love to know if anyone has any positive experiences with places around here. I'm looking for a nice, quiet place with awesome people (plz no more ""crazy"" horse people, I'm so over it). We don't show anymore so all I want is a relaxing place to keep him where we can just hang around all day.

I'd prefer to adopt and was hoping Reddit could give me advice on where to find my future furry friend. I don't care if it is a puppy or adult, male or female. I'm partial to large breeds though, like boxers but not pit bulls. I've been checking out the Indy Humane Society and ARPO websites, but thought I'd ask if I'm missing anything. Has anyone had luck with any other organization? Or does anyone know of a pup that needs a home? Thanks!

Thanks to your suggestions from my last post, my band, [Lords of the Trident](http://www.LordsOfTheTrident.com/) landed a date at Indy's Jukebox on 8/13 in Indianapolis on our 2013 TRIDENTour. 

However, we need to find a few local bands to play the show with. Can you suggest some to contact?

We're just a bunch of mild-mannered nerds. We'll play with any genre. It's the Iron Maiden/Dio type of metal,.

To make a long story short, we were never really the right family for him, and that point was driven home a couple of months ago when he snapped at my eldest son. Well, I'm due with baby #3 in about six weeks and we don't feel comfortable having him in the house with a newborn. The person we got him from is no longer in rescue due to health issues and a divorce. She does work with another organization who I have been in contact with for over a month now. I asked if she could do a ""courtesy post"" but never did, and still doesn't have a foster for him. Time is getting short, and I told her that I would have to start looking at other options for rehoming him. He's a 5YO M/N Pomeranian, about 15 lb (tall but not fat!). He's due for vaccines on Thursday so I'm going to take him next weekend. We got his teeth cleaned last year, but he could probably use it again. I have a very long and detailed write up about him if you would like more information, or know of an organization that might be able to help.  I have contacted a couple of small breed rescues recently to see if they can do anything, but I thought I'd see if anyone here would be interested.

He needs to be in a home with older kids (10+) and prefers women.  He's inconsistent about peeing / pooping outside.  He's adorable, playful, fun, athletic (LOVES to play fetch and has great leash manners), submissive to other dogs, and a cheerful little guy.  He's not perfect, and we are going to have even less time to take care of him than we already do when baby gets here.  Yes, I know, I know - pets are a lifetime commitment.  I'm a vet tech, so I get that.  We weren't planning on having any more kids when we adopted him.  And my family has to come first and I am doing my damndest to be sure that he goes somewhere that he can truly be appreciated instead of tolerated.  Thanks. "	t5_2rtt2	True

We're looking for people interested in maybe getting together some time and playing any of the following, or anything at all really:

Ascension (4 player deck building card game) - We really like this game and would love to have some other folks to play with! It's super easy, and we already have the stuff for it. 

Ticket to Ride - I've got a copy of the original board game, it's simple and a lot of fun!

Last Night on Earth - A zombie apocalypse board game? Fuck ya!  Another one of my buddies has this one. I'm not really sure if he'd be OK with me taking it to play with folks he doesn't know, but I'd be willing to buy it if there were people interested. 

any quirky unique board/card game - If there's enough demand for a specific game and no one owns a copy, I'd probably be willing to buy it. My fiance and I love that kind of stuff anyway. 

Looking forward to hearing from folks!

So had to quit my job, pack up everything I could fit in my car and left everything else behind to get the hell out of there.

He referred us to Pamela Steed who wants $600 up front just to visit her. We were then referred to Dr. Roberts on Guion Rd. who said because of her schizophrenia that he would not be able to help. 

I do not understand how having schizophrenia could affect a doctors ability to treat a patient with TMJ. I don't know what else to do, she is currently sitting here bawling her eyes out because she is in so much pain. We have gone to the ER before and their only solution is pills. We have tried going to the dental school because again her case is ""too complex"" as well.

I only mention doctors names because people familiar with this problem will probably know those doctors and I dont want to be referred to them again. I know the Indianapolis subreddit isnt too busy but I am praying someone may have a solution."	t5_2rtt2	True

1338055498.0	u67uo	See you again soon, Indy!	CommodoreFappington	17	9	11	I'm from Cincinnati, but I just visited my sister in Indianapolis yesterday.  Wow, what an awesome place!  I wish I had taken off work so I could stay longer.  Met up for lunch at 3 Wisemen, had delicious beer and an amazing pizza.  Later, we hit the Upland Tasting Room, The Sinking Ship (very cool!), Chumley's, Rock Lobster, Broad Ripple Tavern, MacNiven's, Old Point Tavern, and finally The Chatter Box.  Everywhere we went had an excellent beer selection with great local brews.  And the food trucks!  Cincinnati has a lot of cool bars, many of which are within walking distance of each other--despite this, we don't have many food trucks.  Anyway, I'll be back to party soon, had a great time.  Cheers!	t5_2rtt2	True
1335122291.0	smyrs	Moving to Indy from UK; advice on telecoms options	andrews9	10	0	27	"We're moving to Indy in the next few months from the UK- would like to pick your brains about cell phone/home broadband options.  

Is there anything specific to Indy I should consider (ie carrier with best signal, ISP with best bandwidth) or will looking at national sites (eg AT&amp;T)answer my questions? 

We've got iPhones right now; I've looked at the fibre optic options from Verizon which look great, but couldn't determine if the service was offered to homes in the greater Indy area.  Do most people get bundles of phone/TV/broadband rather than shopping around?

Would like a decent connection to video chat/Skype with family in UK, also get BBC channel on the TV. 

Many thanks!

edit:  Many thanks for the replies, you have all been a very big and kind help.  I love this subreddit for the quick and helpful feedback!!"	t5_2rtt2	True

1322459306.0	mrp2z	I have a weird request...I need an audience.	Cermo	11	1	25	"I'm a student at Ivy Tech reluctantly taking a public speaking class.  I'm taking the class online, which means I have to provide my own audience.  The rules say I need at least 6 people who are at least 16 years old or older.  I have an assignment due at noon tomorrow...er...today.  Monday.  I have to give a 5 to 8 minute informative presentation on the topic of my choice.  

I procrastinated, obviously, and ended up writing a presentation on handgun ammunition, because I've absorbed a lot of useless knowledge about it in the past few months.  I tried to think of something better... that is to say something of more general interest... but while I waited for a better idea to come along I went ahead and wrote up this one, and now I'm out of time.

What I've done before in this class is to just show up at an Ivy Tech campus and ask a teacher if I can borrow the class for a few minutes.  Then I set up my camera, say my piece, and get the hell out before the fruit starts flying.  In this case I'm worried that a firearms-related presentation won't be well-received by either teachers or students.

So I'm wondering... does anyone happen to know of a place where there are six or more people with 5-10 minutes of idle time they'd like to spend learning about ammo from an amateur?  I think it woulda actually be pretty interesting to someone who knows nothing about handgun ammo but would like to.  Preferably at about 10:00 tomorr...dammit...this morning?  And hopefully not too far from the area of 71st and Binford Ave?  Super bonus if there's a whiteboard.

If all else fails I'll just hijack a classroom again.  So to speak.  It's worth mentioning at this point that I won't actually be bringing any guns or ammo with me, so no worries there.

Thanks."	t5_2rtt2	True
1319777539.0	lrvlf	Can't find friend in Indianapolis, she was having car trouble and her phone died. 	Bunny_fu	13	3	3	"Have any Indy redditors seen a Black 2000 Bonneville broken down anywhere? It was a Johnson County plate. 

A friend was going to a wedding rehearsal and got lost from the pack when she blew a tire on 82'nd and Allisonville. Some people went to help from the rehearsal at 7pm. Around 9 we were informed that AAA was on their way and she told the people to leave. According to AAA they got her on her way, and she mentioned something about taking ""backroads"" back to Franklin, where she lives. She has not made it home.

IMPD has been informed, but some people have gone out just to see. 

She is 25 dark-dirty-blonde/light brown hair, glasses, around 180lbs, 5'5"" with a green insulin pump. She was wearing a sweater jacket, and would be carrying a tan cloth bag. 

If anyone might have seen something please say something, or call IMPD. We are really worried. "	t5_2rtt2	True

My employer, DirectEmployers, is looking for two great Python web devs for User Experience engineer positions. To look at the job posting, see [here](http://de.nlx.org/jobs/DirectEmployers-User-Experience-Engineer-Job-Description.pdf).

I'm not the hiring manager but I am one of the devs you'd be working alongside. The biggest upside in terms of work environment here is that the Python dev team is in separate part of the building in a quiet, clean, well-lit office far away from sales, marketing, executive staff, etc. My boss, the VP of Product Development, is an excellent guy to work for; he's great at filtering out distractions at work.

If you have any questions about work environment or what have you (not pay/benefits/etc., not my area), you can ask here. But really getting in touch with Rick (see the PDF) is your best bet."	t5_2rtt2	True

Why there? It's all-ages (kids, under-21s, alcoholics, you're all welcome). The food's decent, the booze is good. It's midway between downtown and those folk who live up in the hundreds. And frankly, no one else had a better option. Plus, it's not a long trip to Broad Ripple, if people want to head out that way afterwards.

Please, please, please RSVP, either [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/reddit-indianapolis/events/23325681/) or on [Reddit Meetups](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-reddit-meetup-day-2011/) (but not both!) so we can attempt to know how many to expect, and give the bar some warning if a huge number try out.

We cool? We cool.
