I was an Australian exchange student in Missouri, and I do really enjoy the Midwest. But there is no other place in the world I can see myself permanently than in St Louis. 

I've spent many weeks living and exploring St Louis, and I've never not been happy while doing it. People in St Louis are not only kind and generous but funny and easy-going. 

You guys don't even realize how nice you are, in everything I did I knew I could find some nice St Louis folk.Whether from the Zoo to the Brewery. A perfect example would have to be when I was riding up to see the Arch for the first time cramped in those little vehicles. 
My mate, a St Louis Native just started a conversation with the other people in the car, I thought it was polite to just sit quietly and it would be weird to talk. He put it perfectly, that he thought it would be weird *not* to talk. This has basically been my experience in St Louis, I could always find a conversation and someone with a kind spirit to get along with. 

From the bottom of my heart I just want to say, you guys are awesome and keep doing what you're doing.

**Go Cardinals!**

Like I said, long shot, but I thought it'd be cool to get the young artists property back to him, if I could. Does this sound like someone you know? I'm not sure how reddit works but I think it's okay to ask for upvotes for visibility. Really don't care about karma, just happy to be here ya'll.

Even if you have no interest in going, that shouldn't prevent others who would like to from seeing it. Please note that as this is a self post I will not get any karma for it.

Here's the information as posted on the [reddit gifts site](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/rstlouis-plays-board-games/), which is the official site for this event:
&gt; We're going to play some board games! If you've been on our IRC chat room,  you'll have heard of Dominion. If you like Wil Wheaton, you may have seen his new web show Table Top, where he invites people over for games and chat. The [first episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro) covers Small World. Other episodes cover Settlers of Catan, Zombie Dice, Tsuro, Get Bit... all fun games that are easy to learn and fun to play, and you get to play them with your fellow redditors!

&gt; **About our venue**: [Urban Eats](http://urbaneatscafe.com) is a local independent coffee shop in south St Louis City. They normally close at 8, but are willing to stay open until midnight to allow us to have this event. However, in order to avoid a reservation fee, they are asking for a minimum take of $500 (I'll basically be on the hook if there's a shortfall).  They do have a great menu (if you're having trouble viewing the Flash menu on their site, I do have a [PDF copy](http://timothy.org.uk/UrbanEatsMenu.pdf)). Beer, wine, cocktails and ""boozies"" (alcohol laden smoothies) are available, but this is NOT a 21-only venue, so those under 21 are very welcome. With 40+ people, this is easily do-able. I have to give them 2 weeks notice for a cancellation, so **if by August 3rd we do not have 40 RSVPs this event will be in danger of being cancelled.**

AMA!	michellewitthaus	121	26	55	"Hi, my name's Michelle Witthaus and I'm running for Alderwoman in St. Louis' 6th ward.  I'm a former St. Louis Public School teacher that is also an activist and community organizer.  I'm looking forward to being Alderwoman so I can bring ""participatory budgeting"" to my ward and allow residents to be a bigger part of the decision-making process within the ward. Participatory budgeting gives residents a bigger part in the democratic process by allowing them to vote on how we spend the ward budget.  I look forward to answering your questions through my AMA at 11:00 a.m. today.

If you aren't able to participate today, I'll come back to check out questions later and reply tomorrow.

Here's the information as posted on the [reddit gifts site](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/rstlouis-plays-board-games/), which is the official site for this event:
&gt; We're going to play some board games! If you've been on our IRC chat room,  you'll have heard of Dominion. If you like Wil Wheaton, you may have seen his new web show Table Top, where he invites people over for games and chat. The [first episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro) covers Small World. Other episodes cover Settlers of Catan, Zombie Dice, Tsuro, Get Bit... all fun games that are easy to learn and fun to play, and you get to play them with your fellow redditors!

&gt; **About our venue**: [Urban Eats](http://urbaneatscafe.com) is a local independent coffee shop in south St Louis City. They normally close at 8, but are willing to stay open until midnight to allow us to have this event. However, in order to avoid a reservation fee, they are asking for a minimum take of $500 (I'll basically be on the hook if there's a shortfall).  They do have a great menu (if you're having trouble viewing the Flash menu on their site, I do have a [PDF copy](http://timothy.org.uk/UrbanEatsMenu.pdf)). Beer, wine, cocktails and ""boozies"" (alcohol laden smoothies) are available, but this is NOT a 21-only venue, so those under 21 are very welcome. With 40+ people, this is easily do-able. I have to give them 2 weeks notice for a cancellation, so **if by August 3rd we do not have 40 RSVPs this event will be in danger of being cancelled.**

I work over at KDHX and just wanted to let you know about the Kickstarter we're doing to build The Stage at KDHX: a brand new 125-seat venue, bar and café space in Grand Center, housed inside the under-construction Larry J. Weir Center for Independent Media. I'm really excited about the place, because everyone will finally be able to hang out at the radio station, make art, make music, and all that fun stuff. 

[Here is the link right here with pictures of the place and details on premiums and goodies.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kdhx/the-stage-at-kdhx)

If you're a supporter or have never heard of our commercial free community radio station, I hope you'll check it out! And if you're broke as a joke, please enjoy a free animated video starring Fred Friction at the link, or please share with your pals. Thanks for reading!

Love and kisses,

1371218755.0	1gc6kc	FUCK Dobbs Tire and Auto Center! They tried to rip me off on a state vehicle inspection!	rage242	92	23	52	"Dobbs is STILL Trying to Scam Customers!!!. Why in the Hell does Dobbs still exist? Has everyone forgotten the horrible red nightmare this place was and still is? They were on the local news for scamming and ripping customers off. I remember a traffic reporter going off on a rant while doing the traffic report. Dobbs tried to scam him, but they had no idea he was on the radio every day.

Here's my recent experience with Dobbs...

I took my car to Dobbs Tire &amp; Auto Center for an auto safety inspection, against my better judgment.   Anyway, I was desperate for an auto inspection and they were the only inspection station near my home that could get the job done on a Saturday. When I called to check the status of the inspection, I was told my car had failed inspection for a bad upper taillight and that it would cost $20.00 to repair it. I informed the technician that I would buy my own bulb and replace it myself.  His tone went awkward upon hearing this. He paused, then said ok. He did not tell me that they had done any work on the car. After purchasing a light from Wal-mart for $3.89, my buddy and I return to Dobbs. Upon arrival we test the brake light to insure it was indeed defective. Sure enough, the brake light does not work, so we remove the cover for the bulb. We try to unseat the bulb from the socket and immediately discover the bulb will not come out. The bulb is stuck inside the housing, because it's too large for the hole to be removed. We then proceed to disassemble the housing, something that should not be required to remove the bulb. Once we get the bulb out, it's obvious that this is the wrong bulb for the socket and housing. Next, we reassemble the housing, insert our new bulb, we purchased, into the socket and test. It works perfectly. The new bulb also inserts perfectly into the hole in the housing, with the housing fully assembled, the way that it should. We go inside Dobbs to request a re-inspection of the light. Then we are informed that the shop has already replaced the bulb and the vehicle has passed the inspection. Questions... Why wasn't I informed that the work had already been done and the car passed when I called? Why wasn't the new bulb tested for functionality?  I addressed these questions to the manager and he become aggravated and tried to explain they were doing me a favor. Where's the favor? Over charging me for a bulb replacement? Lying about what's been done?  Trying to scam me out of $20.00? Trust me I will not let this go!

EDIT - I am confident this is a HUGE problem with all chain Auto Service centers. I price matched Midas to Car-X by 50.00. Instead of installing my new exhaust on springs and the proper hangers, they WELDED my exhaust directly to the frame of the car. This was at the Midas on Manchester, in Ballwin."	t5_2qpnm	True

Please help Phineas.	SavePhineas	126	60	20	"Phineas nipped a neighbor child when she fell on Phineas' small human companion he shares a home with. The girl's parents took her to be examined at a hospital. Her skin wasn't even broken but the hospital staff are mandatory reporters and were forced to call animal control.

The animal welfare society has argued that Phineas is NOT a threat. The Lexus Project, a legal group determined to save dogs wrongfully labeled as vicious, is helping but we need to bring more attention to the situation.

Please take a moment to visit the site below. Examine the facts that are put forth and make your own conclusion. If you see that Phineas doesn't deserve to die please sign the petition on the site.

From the site: 
On June 22, 2012, a Golden Lab named Phineas was seized from his home and family in Salem MO following a report that he had bitten an eight year old neighbor who had entered his yard. A photo of the bite indicates that it was hardly a nip and did not even break the skin. The family of Phineas retained an attorney and brought action against the City of Salem to have Phineas returned to them. From the time of his seizure and for nine months, Phineas was confined in doggie jail. Written testimony from the boarding facility caring for him and submitted to the City states that he was anything but vicious. On March 22, 2013, Phineas was removed by Animal Control to an undisclosed location following issuance of an order by Judge Scott Bernstein of the Dent County Circuit Court. In that order, he stated: ""The Court finds that Phineas, the Labrador Retriever owned by the Plaintiffs is in fact a vicious dog as defined by Defendant's City Code under Section 5-15 in that Phineas without provocation on June 22nd, 2012 bit (minor child - name withheld.) The dog shall be humanely euthanized.""

His wife of 63 years was just laid to rest two weeks ago after many years of health problems. He put his work on hold to take care of her. She lost the fight and now he's lost without her. He was planning on going back to work as a handy man in the next few weeks, in hopes of keeping himself busy after his loss. He woke up this morning to find his white Ford E250 van gone, along with his tools inside. The license plate is OWA 737.  It is a 2000 econoline 250 extended 8 cylinder. 

This is a desperate plea for help from anyone in the St. Louis area. The van was stolen from his home near Hampton Ave and Manchester Rd. If you have any info please contact St. Louis police. We would sure appreciate any help.

#ANOTHER UPDATE: There's been a huge outpouring of people wanting to help and asking about a donation page. I setup a donation page on Crowdtilt (yes the same one for the Atlanta Security Guard) for people to help. I can't believe there's that many people that want to help. Here's the link if anyone wants to help or at least get the word out... https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/help-for-herman-bertuso

###Latest Update:: THE VAN HAS BEEN FOUND!!! Unfortunately, all the tools were gone. But he has the van back and it's still running, other than being a total mess inside. Here's the news story... http://www.kmov.com/news/editors-pick/News-4-tracks-down-stolen-van-193722871.html?can=n

Places to Avoid:

* Busch Stadium (open air, easily broken into)

* The Magic House (It seems fun at first; but think about how horrifying it will be once the zombies infiltrate)

* Chesterfield or West County Mall (least secure of all the malls)

* The Arch (this should be a given: don't fucking go to the top of a giant ~~parabola~~ hyperbolic cosine function[vernonpost of unincorporated] because the zombies will find a way to knock it down. Also, too high for a useful sniper post unless you're really good)

* Soulard (I just have a bad feeling about it)

* The Science Center (It's been useless for a while)

* One of the thousands of hospitals (where do you think it spreads? Barnes might be okay just because it's so big)

* Highway 40 (too streamlined now; even a zombie could navigate it)

* Private Schools (not a lot of security)

* Metrolink/ Metrobus (could also get started there; unreliable)

* Monsanto (they’re probably the cause of the outbreak)

* Scott AFB Initially (It will be over run with people seeking refuge, and will lead to a massive break out due to the sense of security. And those douches that hide their bites) (ravioligirl)


Places to Go:

* Edward Jones Dome (not open air)

* Galleria or Mills Mall (beefed up security) (also, according to MrHacks of NoCo/ Florissant, Cabellas at the Mills has guns and other weapons. And, can I point out, a Cinnabon)

* Highway 70 (all the construction will confuse the zombies)

* Inner city schools (secure entrances and exits)

* The Rivers (zombies can't swim, and if you can secure a boat it will be easier to shoot those on the land. Easy escape down the Mississippi)

* WashU (hear me out: the roofs are easy to sneak on and they're the perfect height for a sniper hideout)

* The Zoo (animals are immune to the zombie virus, and Raja will lead us to safety) (also we can use them as transportation)

* The Art or History Museum (nobody goes there, anyways, so the zombies won't think to. Also, if you can get on top of the art museum you can shoot the zombies running up the hill)

* City Museum (more hiding places than the Magic House)

* A Cathedral or Church… just walk a block or two and you’ll find one (most zombies burst into flames when they enter churches. Some of the relics could be used as weapons)

* Lemp Mansion (the psyche of the zombie has taught it to steer clear. Also the non-PC Bubblehead School thingy)

* Crestwood mall, not even zombies will go to that place. (trchili of Shrewsbury)

* Delmar Loop (it's where the zombies hang out already)


Things to remember:

* I don’t care if it’s the zombie of Stan Musial, Nelly, TJ Oshie—whatever. You kill that zombie because it is no longer your hometown hero. It is a zombie. 

* There are rumors that InBev took over AB because they knew Monsanto was producing a zombie gene and the only cure would be beer. So the brewery might be the ultimate weapon, and drunken zombie fighting is a lot more fun than sober zombie fighting.

* The further away from the city you get, the less zombies you will encounter. However, there is a slimmer chance that you will find more humans the further down 70 and 44 you go (remember to stay away from 40)

* Escaping down the river should be our primary plan; however we might encounter more zombies and should stay prepared.

* Inner city schools will have food and lots of protection; private schools will have lot of good food but little protection. I.E. when you’re picking a school, choose Vashon over SLUH.

* If the epicenter of the outbreak is Florida, we would probably want to ride the Mississippi NORTH rather than SOUTH, which might be dangerous. There are many marinas in St. Charles on the Missouri river that could be hijacked and can take you all the way to Montana, a place not even zombies want to be.

* Bass Pro also has guns, and is easily accessible from highway 70. (etishuman21)

* Blackblackbird noted that Barnes could be safe, as it has food, medicine, a helipad, security officers with guns etc. I don't think they offered us help, but they said they have a special access card to fortify themselves...

* MrHacks also noted that St. Louis is home to the [Zombie Squad](http://zombiehunters.org)

* Hope you guys remember Boeing has a missile factory in st charles. Even though the ordinances are meant to be dropped/launched, still a lot of explosives. [daskro]

What else should we add? I don’t know where we can procure weapons so that information is needed.

Well, we had a wonderful time in your fair city, and we can't wait for our next time there.  

We took the Amtrak from Little Rock on a Friday night, arriving in St. Louis Saturday morning.  Stayed at the Crowne Plaza four nights--nice, convenient location and a decent stay.  Nice pool on the roof, and we could see the Arch from our room if we looked to the side!  After a nice, long hotel room nap, we went to the Cardinals/Rangers game that Saturday night (rain delay, but our seats were under an overhang; awesome night after the storm passed, except Cards lost).  We visited Union Station and the Zoo Sunday, City Museum Monday, more Forest Park Tuesday (Art Museum was closed due to the new grand opening, but did the Museum of History and the Science Center).  Went up the Arch on Wednesday and then caught our return train that evening.  Also went to Laclede's Landing, Soulard, City Gardens, and a few other spots.  We missed a few others that were recommended, but this will be a thing we do from time to time.  It's a great city, with so many things to do and see.

Highlights: City Museum knocked our socks off; my first trip to the *new* Busch Stadium and Junior's first MLB game ever: wonderful.  His favorite drink: Fitz's Root Beer Float; mine: Fitz's Root Beer Float (my second favorite: Schlafly Pale Ale).

tl; dr: Thank you, people of St. Louis (esp. StL subreddit!) for being great hosts.    "	t5_2qpnm	True

I thought you guys might be interested in the results	amishrefugee	67	10	35	"So I just finished this project where I chose to study demographic change in ALL of St. Louis over the last 20 years using [GIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system).  I took all the data for Missouri and clipped it basically so it only showed areas within 50 miles of the Arch.  I made a bunch of colorful maps and found out a whole bunch of stuff about where people live now.  I also looked at racial demographics and found some pretty unexpected results.  

----------------

**[THE MAPS](http://imgur.com/a/Bl2d8)**

---------------

**Some things I found:**

-St. Charles County is responsible for all the population growth of the last 20 years

-St. Louis County has remained almost completely stagnant in population since 1990

-There were more people in the city in 1877 than there are now, and more people in St. Charles than that

-The Black population of St. Louis is growing ~8x faster than the white population, but is becoming less 
geographically segregated 

-The number of areas with almost no black people (&lt;1.5%) has cut in half

-Certain areas downtown (CWE, Grand Center, Wash Ave) may be becoming gentrified as white people move back in

-White people are leaving some areas of South City real fast

-St. Charles is growing to be less segregated than most of St. Louis County

-North City, while still declining rapidly, is getting whiter 

-North City, U-City and some of downtown are just about the only places getting whiter 

-There are almost no minorities (meaning other than black or white in this case) in North City 

-I don't know what the hell happened in the area around Hamburg, Missouri, but like 99% of the population left between 1990 and 2010

OK, we all have heard the crime statistics from CQ Press in Kansas City. Their business is to report statistics for use in magazines, or for-profit books they sell. Their statistical analysis is not very scientific and they even admit as such. They were quoted saying they would be ""stunned if there is a criminologist out there who will support this."" So why do they continue to do it then? Because it sells and is sensational, and it's not meant for actual scientific study. It's meant to sell books and magazines to the average person.


The biggest problem with how they report statistics is their use of arbitrary boundaries and borders, which is not an accurate representation of a region. Many cities across the country have big sprawling borders that include a larger area of the region and a more diverse representation of their population. So because of their arbitrary boundary size, they look great according to CQ Press. If St. Louis City had never split from the county in 1877, St. Louis would also look good in these rankings. This is why it is not an accurate representation of crime. Everyone knows statistics can be misleading. This is a perfect example.


So where can we get a more accurate statistical analysis? The FBI. That is a main focus of their job. They have hundreds of statisticians and criminologists, and have cities report crime to them in an accurate, fair manner. They compile statistics for study and analysis. This is how the government finds out where they need to focus, who needs more funding, and how to spend our tax dollars. That's why they want it as accurate as possible.


The FBI does not use a city's legal borders as a representation of a city. They use what they call ""Metropolitan Statistical Area"" to get a more accurate analysis. They try to get every region to report crime in a uniform matter, hence the name Uniform Crime Reports. Some cities are more uniform in reporting than others. For example, New York only counts a theft if it's over $1,000. Chicago doesn't report numbers at all. St. Louis is pretty accurate in their reporting.


Now to what this is all leading up to- Where does St. Louis fall in all of this? How does it look comparing one metropolitan statistical area (MSA) to another? The answer is decent. Not outstanding, but certainly not ""Most Dangerous City."" Firstly, it's still not an accurate representation to compare one city to another. For one example why, let's look at Walnut Park in north St. Louis. It has a high density of crime, but for the average citizen living in the MSA, there really isn't any reason to go there. There isn't a significant draw to the area, therefore, the crime that happens in Walnut Park is avoidable for most people in the MSA. In a city where crime is more evenly spread throughout, it is less avoidable. An extreme theoretical example is if half a city had an extreme crime problem, but the other half was 100% crime-free, the latter half would be a perfectly safe place to live, but statistically it could still look bad.


**With the disclaimer out of the way, ready to compare some stats? Violent crime in the St. Louis MSA is 497 per 100,000 inhabitants. The first thing you might notice on the FBI website is that the population for the MSA (a more accurate representation of the population of the St. Louis region as a whole) is 2,822,879. It's a pretty good, medium sized city when you take out the regional borders that local government has divided it up into. Also you might notice that 497 isn't too bad. To cherry-pick some numbers; Tampa, FL is 500, Charleston, SC is 513, Cape Girardeau, MO is 541, Tulsa, OK is 598, Philadelphia, PA is 605, Houston, TX is 620, Anchorage, AK is 812, and Memphis, TN is over 1,000.**


**TL;DR**  The average St. Louisan believes their city to be extraordinarily awful due to piss-poor statistical reporting that doesn't reflect reality. This does more harm than we realize. St. Louis suburbanites are scared to death of the city, businesses think twice about moving here, and people move to other cities. This city has an inferiority complex due to a problem that isn't nearly bad enough to warrant all the harm it causes. Crime is a problem throughout the country, but St. Louis is closer to average than it is to ""Most Dangerous."" Below are links to the FBI website, so you can check it out yourself.

We have been proudly serving the local Korean community in the St. Louis area for the past 10 years. However, just serving the local Korean community is not our main goal. With the recent change in ownership, we would also like to bring in more customers who have never tried Korean food. Anything from the best Korean snacks and beverages, Shin Ramen, to pre-made bulgogi and korean bbq meats can be found at our market. In addition, we also carry many other foods that can be difficult to find at your local Dierbergs or Schnucks! We have decided to also change things up by providing customers with a Facebook page to ask questions and leave comments or feedback!

(x-post from Veterans)	RepCarnahan	62	11	11	"In March, I introduced the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act. It is a bill that would lift the five-year window on Veterans seeking mental health help. It was supported by AMVETS.

Earlier this month, we found out that military suicide rates are nearly one a day. That's unacceptable. Our military engagement is slowing, but we are losing both active-duty military and veterans to suicide at a rate that is staggering.

Serving in a military conflict is stressful to an extent that is incomprehensible to most human beings, even including those who are actually veterans of that conflict. Many do not want to address even the potential of having sustained even the slightest mental trauma. Those who eventually do seek help may find that they are no longer eligible for VA mental health benefits. We must ensure that every soldier, sailor, airman or Marine can seek help for service-connected mental illnesses, regardless of when their conditions manifest themselves.

Please let me know what you think about this legislation. I am going to keep fighting for it.

Here is the press release I sent out in March: http://1.usa.gov/LTL3Zp

I need a ride from St. Louis Surgical Center to the Loop in University City at about noon. Due to outpatient rules, I cannot take a taxi. 	throwaway_gyn	57	9	15	"Hello, redditors of St. Louis!

I am undergoing gynecomastia surgery (i.e., removal of man-boobs). It is rather embarrassing for me and it's a problem that has caused me quite a bit of insecurity over the years. I have lost considerable weight (I'm pretty skinny) and I went to the doctor to check out the man-boobs, which only became more and more apparent (it pops out more when you're skinny). So the doctor confirmed that it was glandular and that I needed surgery if I wanted it removed. 

I am new to St. Louis; I moved here in late August for school (Wash U). I have made a couple of friends, but I don't know them that well and it would be quite embarrassing for me to spring this up on them. I'd be very uncomfortable doing that.

So, I have come to you guys.

Firstly, some logistical information. St. Louis Surgical Center is located on:
760 Office Parkway 
Creve Coeur, MO 63141

I live on the Loop right next to Blueberry Hill. The distance is approximately 8 miles. My surgery should be finished at some point between 11AM and 12PM on November 2 (Friday).

Outpatient procedures prohibit me from leaving without adult accompaniment. I cannot take a taxi by myself. I need someone to take me home.

I'm a broke law school student, so my ability to compensate you for this will be limited. It is more charity than a market transaction. Still, I can give $20 for your troubles and I can cover the gas expense. If you do not have a car and you'd like to help me, I might be able to pay for a taxi to pick you up, bring you to the surgical center, take us to my place, and then the taxi will take you to your place. (depending on the distances and expenses involved)

Also, if you're a Wash U law student, I'd rather not have your help in this matter. I'm rather insecure about it all, and it'd be a bit... odd. (I'm a Wash U law student.)

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and I would sincerely appreciate any help you guys and gals can offer.

Reply to this topic or send me a private message if you can help me.

PS -- if you have any questions about gynecomastia or anything else, I'd be more than happy to answer."	t5_2qpnm	True

Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity.  I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.

The Internet has transformed the way our nation's industries and government operate, and it plays an increasingly large role in our economy.  Our critical infrastructure systems, such as banking, telecommunications, and energy grids, are now more interconnected than ever.  Observers commonly note that our nation has gone from ""network enabled"" to ""network dependent.""  As a result, we face an increased threat from cyber attacks that could have a devastating effect on the nation, impacting everything from our energy grid to the security of our financial institutions.

Every day, millions of potentially damaging ""phishing"" emails are sent from seemingly ""trustworthy"" entities to unsuspecting individuals and small businesses with the intent to steal sensitive information, crash networks, or invade privacy.  Hackers, domestic and foreign, overrun websites with so much Internet traffic that websites are forced to shut down, depriving users and subscribers from important online services.  Some cyber activity is related to espionage, as foreign governments try to steal secrets, access national security information, disable government operations and more.  All of these actions jeopardize the free and lawful flow of commerce.  Accordingly, protecting our infrastructure systems from cyber threats has emerged as a top national security priority.

As you may know, on February 12, 2013, President Obama signed an Executive Order aimed at bolstering cybersecurity protections for critical infrastructure networks by increasing information sharing between the government and private sector entities that run critical infrastructure networks.  The government will increase the volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat information shared with the private sector so that private sector entities can better protect themselves from cyber threats.  The Order also requires the federal government to draft voluntary cybersecurity standards. 

In addition, Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan has reintroduced the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), H.R. 624, in the House of Representatives.  This bill would remove legal barriers that restrict information sharing between private sector companies and the federal government.  On April 18, 2013, CISPA was approved by the House of Representatives.  Should this legislation come to the Senate floor for a vote, I will be sure to keep your views in mind.

Our laws must be modernized to properly address the risks and the scope of cyber threats.  However, we need to find a common-sense approach to protect our industries, businesses, and government from cybersecurity threats without restricting growth and innovation, imposing unnecessary heavy-handed regulation, or threatening the civil liberties and privacy of individuals.  Any new requirements that Congress enacts must be flexible enough to ensure both the public and private sector can react quickly to new or unrealized threats.  Further, new regulatory requirements designed to address cyber threats cannot be allowed to simply become paperwork exercises for the regulated entities while contributing very little in the way of enhancing security.

In the past, I have voted to debate cybersecurity issues, which are critically important to both our national security and private sector, in the Senate.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find commonsense, compromise solutions that will serve to protect government and private sector interests from increasingly dangerous cyber threats.

Again, thank you for contacting me. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of further assistance to you on this or any other issue.

Last night he put on what was still a great show as he always does, but he played Roll Over Beethoven, then played a slow song, then played Roll Over Beethoven again. It was funny, but it showed how his short-term memory had gone (a condition confirmed by my friend, a waitress at Blueberry Hill).

So I'd suggest you see him live; this man has had his songs covered by the Beatles and many other bands, has played on stage with John Lennon (and unfortunately Yoko), and absolutely revolutionized an entire genre of music. Make it your priority to go see him.

&gt;Below is an email from Michelle Burdick, a MoveOn member in Raytown, MO, who created a petition on SignOn.org, the nonprofit site that allows anyone to start their own online petition. If you have concerns or feedback about this petition, click here.
&gt;
&gt;Dear Missouri MoveOn member,
&gt;
&gt;Missouri State Representative Rick Brattin is proposing intelligent design/creation be required teaching and given equal time in every science classroom in Missouri, including college level classes.
&gt;
&gt;This will also require the schools to spend money on new textbooks on or including intelligent design.  
&gt;
&gt;We need to tell the Missouri General Assembly NO on HB 1227. That's why I created a petition on SignOn.org to Rep. Rick Brattin, the Missouri General Assembly, and Governor Jay Nixon, which says:
&gt;
&gt;We do NOT want intelligent design taught in Missouri science classrooms.
&gt;
&gt;[Click here to add your name to this petition, and then pass it along to your friends.](http://signon.org/sign/rick-brattin-and-the?source=mo&amp;id=62664-24212078-fA12oUx)

Although the Appellate court reversed some parts of Neill's ruling, they affirmed the voiding of the ordinance.

The key sentence is on page 2 of the ruling:

""However, since the Ordinance does not comply with the mandatory notice requirements of the Missouri Supreme Court rules, we affirm the trial court’s judgment in favor of Smith invalidating the Ordinance, although not on procedural due process grounds.""

As of June 12, local media outlets including the St. Louis Post Dispatch, the Riverfront Times, KMOV, KSDK are all reporting that the ordinance has been ""upheld"". It is clear that none of them even read to page 2 of the ruling before reporting on it.

This is an error with implications not only for citizens of St. Louis, but for people living everywhere in the United States because survival of legal challenges to red light camera ordinances in one city is used to justify their adoption in other cities.

Please help contact these media organizations to urge them to correct their mistake. St. Louis City's red light camera ordinance is void, and has been since February 2012."	t5_2qpnm	True

I picked up a doughnut and a drink to enjoy before heading home and sat down on a bench by the bike rack to consume them.

Back in the store, waiting for the Redbox behind me, there had been three people, probably in their 20s, having a conversation about over-paying for lottery tickets. When they came out and headed to their car, the woman in the group turned around to ask if I needed a ride anywhere. My mouth was full of doughnut, so I just shook my head, gestured to my bike, smiled, made the Sign Language motion for ""Thank you,"" and said ""Guh Boo.""

Offering a ride to a stranger late at night was really quite a nice thing to do; a tiny act in the scheme of things that nonetheless did its part to increase the quality of our civilization. I have no idea if any of the people I saw were redditors. If so, thanks! Either way, let this be an inspiration to all our neighbors.

I've been hard at work organizing it and it's gonna be completely f---ing bananas this year. Here's the details and stuff...I'll likely be in some sort of Rabbit Outfit this year, so if you see me please come and say hi and I'll get you a beer!

[You can see what you’re in for at the Riverfront Times photo gallery -- some photos NSFW, kids.](http://www.riverfronttimes.com/slideshow/midwest-mayhem-at-the-city-museum-33259890)

From 6:30 p.m. until Midnight—sprawling across 600,000 square feet of the famed City Museum—Midwest Mayhem is KDHX’s way of thanking everyone who supported commercial-free, independent radio in Saint Louis during their recent Spring Membership Drive. Members should have received their tickets by now, but you can also get them at the door for $20.

13 local bands: Little Rachel • Née • Five and Dimers • Aaron Kamm and the One Drops • Warm Jets USA • Bob Reuter’s Alley Ghost • Javier Mendoza • The KDHX Blues Band • Tight Pants Syndrome • Funky Butt Brass Band • The Folk School of St. Louis Showcase (featuring Louisiana Purchase, the Gateway Ramblers and Boss Hall). We’ll even have KDHX DJs spinning throughout the night, so look for Steve Pick of Sound Salvation &amp; Cat Pick of Emotional Rescue, Roy Kasten of Feel Like Going Home &amp; John Wendland of Memphis to Manchester, Andrea of Radio Rio, Kate of Beep Beep Boop Boop, Darren Snow of Rocket 88 and DJ Needles of Rawthentic.

[Band bios and all that stuff at the Midwest Mayhem blog.](http://www.midwestmayhem.org)

In addition to all the music, the Mayhem will continue throughout the museum with burlesque performances hosted by Lola Van Ella, roaming performances from Belle of the Ball and the Lawn Chair Brigade, an outrageous Photomaton photo booth, and plenty of food and booze, booze, booze. Booze it up, booze monkeys!

All breaking news about Midwest Mayhem will happen at our [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/kdhx) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/881kdhx) pages.

BobPlager	55	17	223	"Being a prideful St. Louisan who, despite being diaspora, loves his city to no end, I am very disappointed when bad things happen (especially things that would give our city a bad name, or perhaps an even worse one than we've accrued through the annual ""worst crime city in the universe"" lists). 

What do you feel can be done about the situation in the loop? The situation not only causes people to avoid such historic areas, but strengthens dichotomies between blacks and whites.

Is it the police who are dropping the ball? But what are they to do exactly, short of blatant profiling? Should they be allowed to profile based on demographic and not race?

For the record, I think a tentative way to combat such negative situations is to NOT give up on going to places like the Loop; it is still safe in general there, and to drop going and patronizing such places would be letting those responsible for the ""shenanigans"" win, if you will. I plead that you not give up.

Where is it geographically? What is the student population like? Are they known for anything in particular? That kind of stuff.

Not to brag, but the swiftness in which i deflected your muffin was pretty fucking ninja, if I do say so myself.  Why the lady behind you honked, I have no idea.  I can only assume she didn't approve of your muffin throwing, or the paint-job on your sedan - a snazzy metallic gold.  Anyway, you didn't have to yell at her too and then call her a b*tch.

I kind of adopted theirs, by visiting St. Louis pretty much every summer and winter since I was a young'n (younger than I am now, anyway). It's one of my favorite cities, I've got tons of family in the area, and I absolutely love the school. Just the possibility of going there makes me giddy. I'm so glad I was accepted!

I want to play D&amp;D. I'm willing to DM (though I'm only moderately experienced) or be a player. I unfortunately am unable to host a game since I only have a small studio apartment but would totally be up for helping people who've never played before start a game. 

I don't have a car so I wouldn't be able to go very far from the CWE, but if I can get there by bus or train I'm all for it.

Anyone interested?


edit: I should mention I'm up for any pen and paper really. If I know it I can run it, otherwise I'm willing to learn a system as a player.
