As a budding designer with a true passion for it and a lot to learn, I am sincerely hoping that the collective attitudes I've witnessed here are not as indicative of the industry as I'm suspecting they are.

Between the pretentious assholeism found in the comments of the ""This is a vector image"" ('What a waste of time'; 'this isn't even talent/skill'; 'this is so sad' - most seem to be steeped in insecurity and jealousy;  how dare someone get positive attention for their work!?), to the outright meanness in the post about solidwhetstone's design (justify it however you want - most everyone was just MEAN about it) - I'm done with this subreddit. 

Send the downvote brigade! Start defending yourselves and attacking me! No one will be surprised when you do.

To those of you who aren't dicks, keep on rocking. Otherwise, go fuck yourselves.

1343416276.0	x9fi6	Your logo is bad and you should feel bad: From a printer/designer about your unprintable logos.	jadeddesigner	858	136	306	"Alright designers, it's back to basics.

I keep seeing posts about designers asking for critiques on their logos. 9 times out of ten, your logo is unprintable and doesn't take into consideration that it will be shown in all different sizes and on different mediums. It's absurd how few designers actually have a good grasp on what goes into printing your logo (and I'm not talking about you shitty Epson CMYK home printer.) So, without further ado here is a small checklist on why you need to revise your logos:

• Start your logo by only working in black.

Straight up, only use black. C0M0Y0K100. Don't you fucking dare touch the opacity or consider putting that K down to 50 or 20 or whatever. Do everything in black. This is your 1 color logo. When you have a one color logo THEN you can start coloring that fucker. Also, limit the number of colors you use. 4 is a good maximum number, but I try to stick around 3.

• Limit your gradients and expect resistance.

Gradients are the bane of a printer's existence. It may look great on computer monitor, but hand it to a flexographic printer and he might as well tell you to go fuck yourself. Gradients don't translate well in print. Even in CMYK printing, they can be messy and don't have the same tolerance from one color to another, printer to printer. 

• For the love of god, play with your logo.

So, you've created a logo, huh? Well here's what you need to do. Print it. As small as you fucking can without losing it's integrity. Not very legible? Did your anorexic ultra-thin type disappear? Yeah, time to go back to the drawing board. Create versions of logo that can be placed horizontally, vertically and without type (unless the typography is your logo). Your skinny type isn't going to show up on a piece of fabric because it's going to be lost on the threads. Always have longevity and functionality in mind when you design! That's design 101, and it's amazing how many designers forget that.

I get told a lot by a lot of amateur/small time designers that, ""This is 2012, my logo can be as complex as I want!"" Fuck you, and here's why:

• Printing is expensive.

I don't know if you know this, but [CMYK printer ink is more expensive than human blood.](http://i.imgur.com/7eeoo.jpg) That's why you need to think ahead and consider alternative printing methods. That's why you need a 1 color logo. You have clients. Clients aren't into the most elaborate bang for their buck. They are looking for ways to cut down on costs and maximize profit. You owe them that.

The other thing is that using alternative printing methods price by the number of plates/screens/inks used. Right now, my printer charges $200/flexographic plate made up. 1 plate = 1 color. So, LIMIT THE NUMBER OF COLORS YOU USE, because YOU WILL end up having it printed or someone else will print it for you (ie, sponsor, advertisement, etc). And I'm sure you want it looking good and recognizable. 

What alternative methods? I'm talking about offset and flexographic and screen printing. All of these forms of printing have their pros and cons, but all are meant for mass production. You need to learn how each of these work, because it's important to know what to expect. 

Anyway, I am willing to answer any questions. Let's also hear the more veteran printers/designers put forth their advice. Cheers

**EDIT:**

A few other points should have been made thanks to other's posts.

• VECTOR

Your logo needs to be vectored, converted to outlines and expanded. Turn it in as either an EPS or Illustrator PDF file. If you don't know what that means, then you probably aren't a designer.

• Pantones.

Buy yourself a pantone book, preferably 2 for solid color coated and uncoated inks. A pro-tip is to work from pantones. Convert all of your CMYK colors and RGB colors from a Pantone color first. It is much easier to match from a pantone color than to match TO a pantone color.

• Color Match

Finicky about colors? It's your job as a designer to request that your colors be color matched to an already made up hard copy. Inks are typically transparent and the paper or substrate behind the ink has a tendency to come through. That means your logo has a chance of always being printed darker than it's intended color. Ask for your colors to be color matched against an already perfect print of yours on the paper or medium you are printing it on. 

• You signed it, it's your fault.

This one is simple. If you sign that proof, the ink is on your hands. Don't be angry at the printer. Printers may be nice and try to accommodate for your mistake (cheaper re-run, maybe?), but all in all, you are probably going to eat that cost.

So as a subreddit, we can get together list of any resources for designers or beginning designers, like font repositories, tutorials, textures, ect...

What do you all think?

EDIT (11-18 8PM):
I was going to add Hollowgram's list of tutorials, design theory links, and resources, but it put the post over the character limit so I'll just have to link to it. UPVOTE THE MAN OKAY?!

This list is by no means the only resources listed in this thread, check the comments for more, there's a lot of good discussion going on even an hour after I first made the post. 

If you are needing something that is not addressed in this list or in the comments, feel free to comment with your needs and I am sure someone out there can find what you need!

Thanks to: ohhoe, fred_monster, designermidwest, Lo_Rez, michaellonger, switchmotiv, dizzytwister, ant_monologue, captainhiltz, ennuied, and krisu, mtx, BabiSealClubber, BrainShutDown, timothyjc, and julian88888888, and everyone else who has contributed to the list and in the comments!

1341915488.0	wbl6i	The Next Reddit. A responsible redesign.	44oz	336	41	79	"Trying to redesign a site that has been a part of millions of users lives throughout the past many years is not an easy task. 

Changing where things are laid out or how things are organized in a drastic way can spell death if not done in small steps over many years for a site like this.

I have noticed over the years that for some reason, maybe it's our human nature to gravitate toward clutter, or the tendency to become pack rats, but for whatever reason, websites with lists of links in a tight space in organized rows or columns tend to perform really well and generates loyalists for life. 

Sites like Drudge, Reddit, Craigslist all have this type of feel. Lots of data, simplified into what first seems a cluttered grouping of tons of content that can set a designer's brain on fire, but for some reason, users find it easy to navigate, scan, use and fall in love with.

When I went forward with designing a new reddit.com, I had to keep this at the forefront of my mind. How can I keep things the same, yet make them different and for the better. How can I tweak and organize things in small steps in a way that improves the ease of use, but does not scare away the loyalists... which by now is pretty much everyone. How can I redesign the style to be clean and modern yet classic and timeless.

It was not an easy task, but I believe I came up with a pretty good, yet realistic solution.

As you can see the main goals in this task where to introduce a faster way to let people become part of communities, remember to take part in the communities, discover that you can actually edit your communities (something missed by many new people) and lastly, still have amazing access to the front page, all while making sure you can still satisfy the loyalists with a collapsed top nav view.

I really set out to make things very familiar but yet refined. Making areas more defined, buttons more noticeable and clickable, links and navigation cleaner, organized yet the same.

I purposefully did not go down the route of creating a bunch of white space that most designers gravitiate toward right away, but left the cluttered tight spacing, maybe a bit more refined for easy skimming and browsing. 

Of course this is just one view into a site that has many different configurations, I even have ideas how to make these work great with sub reddits, but for now I think, hope, you can appreciate this stab at designing a site that is almost impossible to design. A site that is loved by many, that fears change. 

I believe if done right, in small stages (unlike *coughdigg ) reddit can introduce new features with a cleaner more usable design.

Love it, hate it, it''s all good! At least it will get you thinking and maybe another blue link to click on.

1339273193.0	utlik	Shit they don't teach you in design school: Interviews	fowleryo	327	51	68	"Hola r/design. I know there are a lot of students in here looking for jobs and internships. I've been there, I know how it goes. I now run a shop in Los Angeles who's hiring people like you, so I thought I'd give you my perspective in hopes that it helps you land a job or at the very least, stand out in a sea of candidates. 

No one ever said shit about any of this in college, and it seems like they still don't, judging by the responses and interviews I've had for a summer internship I'm offering. 

Below is a wish list of traits that I look for in potential hires. 

**Learn how to write an email**
Loosen up. Show some personality. We're a creative agency, not a box factory. Starting the email off like, ""Dear Hiring Manager"" just comes off weird to me. Even if I was a hiring manager, I'd want to be addressed in a more casual fashion. ""Dear all"", ""Hello, ladies and gentlemen""… anything that hints that you're interesting makes me much more receptive to your message. 

**Be Assertive**
Ask questions in your interview. It sounds cliche, but you're also interviewing me, to see if I'm the right fit. ""What does the position entail?"" ""Is there room for growth?"" ""Does it pay?"" ""Do you think I'll have stuff for my book when I'm done?"" These are important to know. If someone asked me any of those, I'd interpret it as initiative. That's a good thing. 

**Don't second guess your work**
When you bring a portfolio in, please don't tell me about the stuff that's not in it or point out the flaws with the work that you're presenting. Stand behind it, have explanations for things. One of the biggest no-nos that I've seen are candidates telling me they did something because ""it looks cool"". You need to have reasons for everything – bullshit or not. 

**Be Positive**
Please don't tell me how hard it is to find a job.. or how long it's been since you worked. I'm sorry if you haven't been able to get a job, but the smell of desperation to me zaps any sort of enthusiasm I might have had for you. You need to be enthusiastic, appear hungry to do some great work, not just get a job. 

**Be Useful**
I'd say that about 20% of the people that have emailed me don't have portfolios. 20% of the people that do, it's full of photography and illustrations. That doesn't help me. I need to see examples of graphic design and how well you handle typography.  I'd love to know how someone handles hierarchy, etc. What you're presenting needs to have some relation to what the position entails. Showing me illustration/photography when I'm hiring a graphic design intern just doesn't cut it. 

**Be Normal**
More than anything, I just want to find someone that's normal. Someone who can hold a conversation, who has their own shit going on, who can add something to the culture at our office. 

**Be on time**
Please don't show up 30 minutes late and not say shit about it. We're busy and when we have to adjust things to fit your schedule, you're already starting off on the wrong foot. "	t5_2qh78	True

&gt;This past SEMA I had, which at the time seemed like a amazing opportunity to work for Mishimoto to do a full drawing on two sides of a car as well as a hood in a 4 day span. I was extremely excited for the opportunity to see how I could accomplish this as well as this was something different than my usual fair of digital mouse clicking. SEMA is a famed trade show in the automotive industry with different companies pushing new ideas to those that are true automotive enthusiasts.

&gt;Month before the event and working with a marketing company everything was in order to be at one of the biggest booths with plenty of space as well as plenty of support to take on this endeavor that needed to be done within 4 days. Obviously this was no small task and any and all support would of been needed as well as being involved with one of the largest vendors at SEMA with amazing foot traffic.

&gt;A week before the event in a frenzy, everything that was planned was destroyed by the owner of Mishimoto since at the last moment they decided to get a booth dedicated to their brand, and the drawing, meaning it would just be me and my team working along with Mishimoto branding. Totally understandable, but since this changed the dynamic and trust, Mishimoto would now have to fund my efforts directly and everything just seemed sketchy days before the event. They could not afford my core price of $5000 and with only week before the actual event they offered $1000 + expenses (taxis, food costs, etc) which we agreed upon since I was looking forward more to the opportunity to work on this project more so than actual costs. In the end, I just wanted my basics covered and to have funds to pay Zombie Yeti for his time to assist me on this endeavor.

&gt;Sadly, the 4 days working with Mishimoto was hell.
&gt;From the first moment we started to the last moment when we finished up we had no respect given and any verbal agreement to assist in our efforts were ignored. Even the simple fact of asking for a small chair to sit and work on lower details was ignored. When both Zombie Yeti &amp; I approached this, we set day specific goals on what we wanted to accomplish which on each day we met those goals and called it day.   During our drawing, we would have Mishimoto employees open doors on us while we drawing it on, shake the car pretty hard to take off the hood so some SEMA celeb could sign it.  Everything became awkward quite fast and our frustrations working with them grew and grew as time progressed.  Simple things of being bossed around or being told ‘how’ to do things made it mind numbing to say the least.  However Zombie Yeti and I held our heads up high and did our best with what we were working with.

&gt;With 2 days left, the right side of the car needed to be done, but there was no space.  I asked the owner of Mishimoto if they were planning on flipping the car as discussed when we first stenciled it prior the opening of SEMA.  Our only other option was to spend the next two days fine tuning the left side and hood and do a vinyl wrap in the end, or flipping the car so we can work and wouldn’t be hidden between booths.  Really the core reason why we were there was to let passer goers of SEMA see us draw thus getting them to talk with Mishimoto and about their products.   The car was not flipped and they still expected us to finish that side.  Both Zombie Yeti &amp; I decided that we wanted to finish the car proper and started.  Imagine trying to draw in 3foot of space for two days.  Quite the task, but we couldn’t stand back and proof our work. After the event, I Invoiced Mishimoto and shortly got a message back that he was instructed by the owner to not to pay me. The first reasons were rhetoric and subjective immaturity thus promoting the annoyance that is Mishimoto:

&gt;• ""1-2 hours late every day""
• ""you didn't even have the common courtesy to say goodbye ""
• ""I had to pay another artist to finish the design and then erase all of original marks left from your carbon stencil""


&gt;This was absurd reasons.  1. The ‘late’ aspect was because Zombie Yeti &amp; I would have a meeting at the hotel about how to figure out solutions and set the daily goals.  2. Saying goodbye? Really? 3. Paying another artist?  Why? We (Zombie yeti &amp; I) agreed that the carbon details (pencil lines) defined the piece and added authenticity as well as if we tried to erase them them cleanly, the Krink markers would smear.  That was our decision as artist and the given timeframe was the best choice.

&gt;So in the end.  This is my story of the events.  Mishimoto already threaten to sue me if I release my accounts of SEMA, but I say FUCK EM. When you refuse to pay me for my time and try to hush me be threatening me that you’ll sue, I say bring it.  I am tired of companies taking advantage of designers and illustrators because they have money to sue you, but don’t have the money to pay you as the owner of Mishimoto stated in our emails:  “'skimpy expenses' you feel you are owed”  At the end, it’s just $1250.  That is it.  Quite sad isn’t it."""	t5_2qh78	True

I started out as a musician, went to music school, practiced a lot, played a lot of gigs, and mostly starved doing it. I always had to temp as a word processor to make ends meet. I'm still a musician, gigging most weekends.

Got good at MS Office. Real good, with excellent English skills. Lucked into a PowerPoint job where my boss was a Pratt-educated designer. He kind of took me under his wing by teaching me Photoshop and Illustrator and general design concepts like color, typography and page layout. As long as I did most of the Excel, PowerPoint and Word he was happy. Learned a lot. 

I started noticing how some things looked ""right"" and some things looked ""off"". I tried to figure out why. I never had any formal training so this was a mystery. Continued to temp around, but now lots of Photoshop and Illustrator added to MS Office.

Fast forward 7 years, it's now 2010. Same boss brings me in as a temp ""designer"" (what a joke) to his new job. I struggle mightily while working with real designers. Feel like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. They know I suck, but I have a good attitude and help with everything I can so they like me. Ask for help a lot. I tried to copy the good designers' work in my downtime. Got real good at InDesign, and honed my Photoshop and Illustrator chops. 

This part is key. After a while I started to have the chops on Creative Suite to be free enough to think more like a designer. Could execute quickly, so I could try many things in short time. Tried to figure out what the real designers meant when they said something ""popped"". Hit or miss with me, but I always took the Word jobs away from grateful designers who would then be more than happy to help me with my design challenges.

Steady progress. Thought I was getting there. Wrong. The designers showed me their portfolios. I wanted to slit my wrists, but instead I gradually made my own portfolio. Not as good, but not bad. Continued to think about what ""design"" means. Still not sure I know, but...

After two years of trying to be a designer, and getting daily feedback from 20 other real designers, company finally made me an offer.

This is the first ""musician-day-job"" that I ever liked. I'm still trying to figure out what makes good design, but at least I know when something ""pops""."	t5_2qh78	True

I post a new pattern each day that i have either created from scratch or have made from a random something something that I've found, these include envelopes, vintage fabric, tissues, and album art. 

If i have sourced the design from else where I always state the source and link to original artist if possible.

If anyone can see any mistakes, annoyances, or potential legal issues that i could learn from please let me know. 

Many of you will straight away tell that I've used a tumblr template for the blog with a few tweaks. Guilty as charged. I need to learn more code before I attempt a re-design.

Many many thanks :)

1318437733.0	l9pov	 An Apology to the /r/Design Community	chrismsx	250	60	65	"Recently I made a post about what I thought would be a thread about color and how it effects the reception of your resume.  Instead **what I got were a bunch of critiques about poor typography and clutter.**  

Initially my response was to ignore everyone because the sample I provided was a rough prototype but as more and more people started to dig at my design, **I became defensive** and argued with almost everyone, who at the end of the day just wanted to help. 

**I wound up having some good constructive conversations once I swallowed my pride** and took a look at what my resume REALLY looked like.  I wound up learning a lot about the effective use of white space, leading and typography.  I think I became so defensive because I know typography is a weak point of mine and I've never been one for brevity. Even in conversation I repeat unnecessary information a lot.  I've managed to keep this issue out of my professional work but when writing my resume I simply forgot because I wasn't viewing it as a work document,  but instead as a chance to say anything and everything I wanted to highlight about my ""career"". 

The lessons I took away from my fellow redditors in the design community allowed me to solve this. I sat down and REALLY looked at my resume and line by line removed everything that repeated or wasn't necessary to covey the message I wanted potential employers to receive.  I told someone in the thread that I'd be selling myself short by writing less about myself but in essence I was selling myself short by not believing that I could find a more user friendly way to convey a message. 

I just wanted to take this opportunity thank all the design professionals and fellow design redditors for being harsh, blunt, honest and most of all gracious enough to help other designers in need.  I want you to know that it's truly appreciated and I'm sorry for becoming defensive. It's a nasty trait for a designer to have.  

**Summary:** *I was a defensive ass hat when all you guys wanted to do was help. I'm sorry. You are all awesome and I appreciate your free help and guidence.*

A while back my mom found Yukifumi Shibasaki on Instagram. He's a graphic designer/photographer/artist. She showed me his feed and I started following him too because I really loved his work. Through Facebook and commenting on each other's photos my mom and him became friends.

One day, out of the blue, he said that he was so grateful for all the support and compliments we gave him on his art that he wanted to send us a painting. And so he sent us a package from Japan to New Zealand that included a beautiful original oil painting, a letter, a collection of flyers he had designed, and a cute little illustration done by his girlfriend (see the gallery link for pictures).

I was just so struck by this gesture, sending us this gorgeous painting all because he was moved by our comments on his art. I wanted to share this because his story really touched my heart. Every now and then you'll come across people who will surprise you entirely and show you the best of humankind. It just goes to show that genuine connections can be made over the internet. I really admire him for being able to be so positive after all he's been through. If you read the letter you'll see that he's had a pretty rough time over the last few years - divorce, losing his business, debt, having go to onto welfare, and suffering depression. And now he's hoping to build a new career around his paintings. It makes me feel so happy that mine and my mom's words have given him confidence in his work.

Here's the links to his Instagram and Flickr accounts if anyone would like to see his other work:

*I received a lot of feed back. People pointed out things I didn't even think were problems. I took study of all the advice and redesigned my portfolio, website and  brand identity. 

*This week I received FOUR interviews. One with a very well known University, one with an awesome interactive design firm, one with a awesome UI/UX firm and another with a large company. 

*I know I did the work but your advice, honesty and support helped me grow in a way that has literally been invaluable.  :-)

Almost every day, someone comes into my office and asks me to remove the single creative element from GenericDesignProject, and the end result is usually something I can't be proud of, and wouldn't put into a portfolio if I were looking for another job. I've worked at several places, and while there is an initial surge of creative freedom that seems to happen, it always settles down to the inevitable requests to remove that ""art"" stuff and change the font to Times. I've found that contract freelance work is pretty much exactly the same, only with no health insurance, and the potential with each new client that you won't get paid.

I just had a project I was proud of get completely and totally gutted. I had tricked myself into thinking that it might actually go through without being ruined, but that just never happens. 

I am making pretty decent money, but I feel completely powerless. I find myself thinking about how nice it would be to go and work in landscaping or farming or hydrogeology or something completely different, but my entire ""proven"" skill set is design-related, and there is no way I could support my family if I tried to jump ship from design at this point. Add to that the fact that I enjoy designing, right up until the point where someone with a terrible eye for everything comes in and asks me if we could make all of the boxes blue, because people like blue. And can we use something like Times?

I've been reading David Thorne's book, and it got me thinking that maybe we're all living this way, and that what separates us is our coping mechanism. He uses being a complete asshole as his release for these frustrations. I'm not willing to do those things. A lame pity post on reddit is apparently about as far as I'm willing to take it. 

**Edit**: Thanks for all the feedback. It made me feel a little less like an idiot, and a little less alone in the (design) world, which I guess is what I was looking for today. To quote my favorite Scientologist:
