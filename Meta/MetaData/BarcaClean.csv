I visit r/realmadrid occasionally, and it's relatively common to see our fans posting there. Sometimes our comments there, while not distasteful, can be regarded as quite unpleasant by those subscribed to r/realmadrid. This is something that has been voiced by Madrid fans both in their subreddit and on r/soccer.

I don't know about you fellows but personally I suggest that we should avoid posting too much there. I think we should respect their subreddit. I see r/barca as a sanctuary for us fans away from the reactionary and sometimes childish environment that is r/soccer. I know that I would hate it if fans from other clubs started posting negative comments here, and I appreciate the fact that they don't.

It would be nice if we minimize our ~~presence~~ negative presence (posting, upvoting/downvoting) in r/realmadrid simply out of respect.

Just something to think about.

I'd like to remind everyone one of the reasons /r/barca got popular; /r/soccer became very, very hostile in a general manner, and people with Barca flair were insulted and downvoted. As such, people started leaving the subreddit in an effort to discuss their team in a less hostile environment.

If someone were to come in to this subreddit and start openly mocking us, you'd be absolutely infuriated, and question why that person would not simply stay out of our subreddit.

/r/realmadrid is no different. That subreddit is for fans that want to discuss Madrid in positive manner. In this regard, they are *just like us*. Let them escape the battle that wages between us, just like we can escape here.

I despise Madrid. I want them to suffer and watch as their team falls apart and I want them to fall into a spiral of football depression. I have no problems telling them that. I know you all like to voice that same opinion. Attack them on /r/barca, destroy them on /r/soccer, whatever. Tear them a new asshole.

Livestream of press conference here. More details to come.

I take back every argument I made trying to possibly justify the practical reasons for Abidal's departure. Seeing this actually happen, how devastated Abidal is, on a human level this is just unbelievably wrong.

Rosell and Zubizarreta have deflected all questions about their decision with ""It's a complicated process."" It's one thing to make a controversial decision, it's another to be unwilling to defend it. Rapidly losing faith in the character of these men.

Abidal mentions how the club constantly delayed discussion of his contract for months. Bastards.

Abidal breaks into tears as the conference ends and he hugs all the members of the team and technical staff before leaving. Look of anguish on his face is haunting.

My overall view: the decision was made by Tito, based on playing time, and is understandable. The process of informing Abidal and letting him go was handled by the board very poorly, and is a disgrace. Their lies, broken promises, PR stunts, and inability to honestly defend the decision is really embarrassing."	t5_2s561	True

Whatever your personal views on the politics involved, being a Catalan club is massively important to FC Barcelona and to a great majority of it's fans.

I was wondering if any Culés subscribed to this subreddit had any interest in learning Catalan, but didn't know where to begin.

Here is a link to a site I would strongly recommend: [parla.cat] (http://www.parla.cat)

This is a brilliant site, funded by the Catalan government that offers completely free Catalan lessons from complete beginners to fairly advanced. I found the site really useful when I was learning.

**Match Events**

0' - Kick off!

3' - **[GOOOOOOL!!](http://i.minus.com/i4D4RCa2QQOLX.gif) [ALEXIS!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiZUZTtZM08)** What a way to start the season! After a lot of short passes Xavi finds a completely free Cesc who just lays it to the side for an easy goal.

11' - Messi controls the ball in the area and lays it off for Xavi, who fires a shot – it goes high.

12' - Pique with a sprint and sliding tackle in Levantes half to prevent a counter attack.

12' - **[GOOOOL!!](http://i.minus.com/ipbiQYV6wAOrF.gif) [MESSI!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tsQ4zaRlAk)** dribbles through the defence, 1-2 with Pedro and a goal.

    Overtaking Cesar (132 between 1942-1954), Messi is now the Barcelona player
       who has scored in most Liga matches (133)

15' - Messi's free-kick goes straight into the wall. The rebound attack ends with an offside.

18' - Barca keeps pressing very deep in the Levante half already and easily dominates the game.

18' - Alexis runs into the back of the defence, but his spinning kick doesn't go as planned.

23' - Xavi's free-kick finds Pique's head, but the ball goes over the bar.

24' - **[GOOOOL!](http://i.minus.com/iJfXU0bm157DW.gif) [Dani Alves!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSMYetpfPUc)** Messi fights for the ball, 1-2 with Messi, Navas saves from Cesc and Alves scores the rebound.

26' - **[GOOOOL!!](http://i.minus.com/ib06qEGgcX5ZcK.gif) [Pedro!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaUOEt1Onvw)** A beautiful pass by Messi finds Pedro who scores for the 4th.

30' - Navas comes out to clear before Messi. Messi gets the ball back and his lop just misses the goal.

33' - Xavi with a free-kick, Navas saves for a corner.

41' - **PENALTY!!** Adriano gets brought down in the area.

42' - **[GOOOOOOL!!](http://i.minus.com/ibwXkQuF08O80Q.gif) [MESSI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLsaiy4pWmE)** His second comes from the penalty.

45' - **[GOOOL!!](http://i.minus.com/i8aGbNF2P78UV.gif) [XAVI!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgGd2jmlRQI)** Scores on his 15th anniversary of the first team debut!

**HALFTIME** A great performance sees Barca ahead with 6-0 at half time.

    Xavi completed more passes (55) than the whole Levante team (53) in the first half .
    Lionel Messi has equalled David Villa as active Liga player to have scored in
        most different Liga games (133)

46' - El Adoua in for Sérgio (1/3).

46' - Pallardó in for Simao (2/3).

49' - **yellow** El Adoua, foul on Alexis.

54' - Messi nearly makes it seven but Navas stretches to deny it.

56' - A cross by Pedro finds Pique, but his shot gets blocked.

58' - Again Pique. Finds himself at the end of a nice ball, but Navas denies Barca the 7th again.

59' - This time it's Pedro who fancies himself a shot from outside the box, but it gets deflected.

61' - Messi's run through the middle ends in a save by Navas.

63' - Again it's Navas who denies Barca another goal, this time it was Adriano.

64' - Neymar in for Alexis (1/3).

64' - Ivanschitz in for El Zhar (3/3).

66' - Messi's free-kick once again hits the wall.

68' - **yellow** Rodas for a foul on Cesc.

69' - Xavi this time with the free-kick, another hit in the wall.

70' - Busquets is brought down in the area, referee ignores it.

71' - Iniesta in for Messi (2/3).

73' - **[GOOOOL!!!](http://i.minus.com/inRMTKZ9EvIKN.gif) [PEDRO!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXQbcy0hCtg)** A Levante free-kick goes right to Cesc, who puts it off to Pedro for his second of the night.

75' - Iniesta and Neymar with a lot of passes between each other within the Levante box.

76' - Tello on for Pedro (3/3).

78' - **yellow** Xumetra for pulling the shirt.

81' - Neymar with a great run and a pass back.

84' - Barca seems content with the score and does little more than holding the ball now with sporadic attacks.

86' - Cesc with a great ball to Neymar whose attempt is denied by Navas.

88' - *yellow** Neymar for a late challenge.

90+2' - Valdes with the first save after a long range free-kick.

**FULL TIME** A single goal in the second half seals a great start into the new season.

Yes, the ref was shit. Yes, Milan played incredibly and we played poorly, and the aircraft carrier in front of their goal at the Camp Nou is going to be ugly. And yes, by all that is holy, we are desperately missing Vilanova.

**But we are goddamn Barcelona**. Are you telling me we can't beat this Milan side 2-0 in the Camp Nou, no matter how confident they are? Are you telling me we're fucked? Fuck that shit. They came into this game with a plan and a will to win, we need to serve that right back to them in our home stadium. We know exactly what we're going to be facing. So let's trust in the coaches and the team to know how to get out there **AND BEAT THIS FUCKING TEAM!**

MOTM if you want, but I think we'd be better served by just discussing what went wrong and how we're going to play next week.

Edit: **MORE MOTIVATION!**

Arsenal were down 4-0 to Milan last year. They came back to 3-0 and almost snatched it. Chelsea went down 3-1 to Napoli, came back to win 4-1 in extra time. 

And to everyone saying our defense is so sloppy that we're guaranteed to concede a goal, I say - are you fucking serious? That's like saying our offense is so good we were guaranteed to score today. Milan has conceded more goals in the league than we have, and their CBs are shit - yet they had an amazing defense today.

Our team has a job to do. It's not an easy job, but it is well within our reach. The offense needs to score goals. The defense needs to be perfect. The fans need to be incredible. The coaches need to be courageous. These are all things we are capable of. **So let's do our fucking job.**"	t5_2s561	True

1367278765.0	1ddgpr	"""What's happening to Barca?"" [Attempted translation]"	egcg119	74	15	9	"[Original here](http://www.marca.com/blogs/perarnau-221/2013/02/27/que-le-pasa-al-barca.html). 

1. Barca have ceased to practice the style of play which enabled it to win 14 out of 19 titles in four years. Has it ceased to practice it entirely? No, but it has in the small details, various small details, as if it had ripped the pocket of its pants and was losing change with each step.

2. The so-called positional play does not consist of having the ball and accumulating a high percentage of possession, but in generating numerical superiorities behind each opposing line that is pressuring or defending against you. It can be more or less horizontal or vertical, more or less offensive or defensive, but it has to generate superiorities. Guardiola's Barca always sought to have the ball in order to attack the opponent by means of rapid ball movement, even if horizontally: they did it this way seeking to provoke disorder in the opposition and generate the resulting space from which it could advance further.

3. Possession was a simple instrument, although some turned it into a myth, either to defend or ridicule it. Certainly, Guardiola considered it only this: one more tool of the game. The same thing happened with Barca's famous pressure and ability to recover the ball (i.e. the 6-second rule).

4. When Eto'o was at Barca, the pressure was physical. Entirely physical: running and running pressuring opposing defenses. When Eto'o left, the pressure became more positional and selective. Barca pressured especially after losing the ball in the opposing half. And besides being a symbol of identity, that pressure was also just another simple instrument and thermometer.

5. Thermometer? Yes, because it reflected the previous position of the team before it lost the ball. As Guardiola said, you defend well only if you attack well. And that meant that you had gone up to the point of losing possession passing through particular previous steps, without hurry, with long periods of possession, tiring and tiring the opponents, moving them around and making it difficult for them to maintain order. If you managed to follow these steps, you made it hard for them. If you lost the ball you had four teammates close by = recovering the ball. The recovery was the thermometer that indicated if you had attacked well.


6. These were some instruments (to explain all of them would be too extensive) of Pep's mode of play. When the Pep Team suffered its fall before Chelsea and Madrid last April, it did so before two teams that closed themselves up very well and left Barca like an inheritance a question: ""How do you attack a wall this well sealed if the team that practices is also a team of high quality?"" In search of solutions, Tito Vilanova turned the team towards a greater verticality.

7. As a result, the team scored many more goals than in previous years, but it also happened to concede more. It turned its sight towards the defense, above all to the substitutes of the first team? (titulares?), but the problem did not reside in the defense (well, sometimes them too), but in the mode of play. Because in the transition towards verticality they fell into the fault of haste. With rather good judgement, an external expert dubbed them ""los acelerados."" The Barca that ""bored"" madridistas (but won 14/19 titles) began to seem more like the speedy Madrid, but with none of their resources.

8. Of course, the opponents also took much credit in the change, but it was Barca who constructed - a new habitat step by step. More vertical, more rapid, with shorter possessions, without attacking together nor closely together...The result was that it cost them a great deal more to recover the ball. How it wouldn't cost them if only the basic recovery were positional and not physical! Logically, with players spread out this way, the lines very separated this way, recovery could not turn out to be simple by the greater amount of running that it gave Busquets.

9. Today Barca runs more than before, but it does so in a more scattered manner. It has gained many victories - ore than ever - but it also has undergone a transformation of its style of play. Tito's intelligent variation has been to practice positional play but with a more vertical sense and alternating rhythms. He has succeeded in many games, but in others he has not found the exact mix of each ingredient, the appropriate utilization of each instrument.

10. In this journey, the team has begun slacking in little details. After Guardiola submitted them to intense pressure and discipline for four years, some liberation inevitably resulted. In fact, the relaxation of certain habits (I am not suggesting anything grave) allowed us to see a Barca each day more powerful since November. But they also were forgetting certain details: fight for each throw-in, not take anything for granted, play directly to Messi instead of playing it through Xavi and letting him move the pieces and play for Messi, which is different...

11. We must touch upon this point. In the most orthodox Barca style, Xavi was Base Camp. The team carried the ball out from behind and looked for Xavi. This was the condition *sine qua non*, no matter how far up the pitch they were. From that point began the genuine collective forward movement, in the style of a mountain climber. And only when each piece - their own and their opponent's - was in an adequate position did the ball find its way to Messi. At this point, freedom for Messi (to do his thing).

12. The course, therefore, was never straight to Messi, but with Xavi the intermediate carrier. But even when Guardiola was on the bench the team began to skip the Xavi step. Sometimes by haste, by wanting to run forward too much, sometimes even Xavi himself was not at his best (right now something similar is happening). For whatever reason, the rest area, the intermediary step, was disappearing, making itself less habitual. The team ceased to play for Xavi and began to play directly for Messi. And Messi ceased to be the endpoint, instead becoming the beginning and end of everything, which is the best way to be diluted.

13. Against medium opponents, no problem.But in serious moments there were important difficulties. Valencia got the knack of it very well and Milan applied the same recipe as Chelsea, with the difference that Barca responded much poorer, preferring to keep the ball in order to not run risks, not keeping it to make the opposition run. Barca didn't attack Milan with the ball, rather trying to protect themselves with it. They came out of it poorly, and in that moment the little details became enormous in the mind of certain players who, after such success, were beginning to forget what it was to suffer on the field.

14. Against Sevilla they did not play better, but they did seem to free themselves mentally of the same stiffness, in front of Madrid they came out splendidly, with Pedro and Iniesta open on the wings and sharp. Ten minutes of good combinations and fluidity, but too quickly they returned to recent faults: play totally oriented through the middle and no horizontal switching whatsoever; Xavi retreated to join Busquets, with him disappeared the midfielders that should be generating numerical superiority behind the lines of Madrid; Iniesta had to come back in turn. Madrid had won the battle although the score did not yet say so.

15. What's happening to Barca? An accumulation of tactical mistakes, some details that seem minuscule but continue undermining the team, and finally a mental collapse that made them betray themselves in the matter of their play. The problem is only their own and the solution as well. Open themselves up, come together, recuperate by being close together, looking to the wings...their problem is in the football and now it affects their mind, that for the first time in years is processing uncertainty and incomprehension. It is not the legs nor the fitness: it is the play. Yes, with the addition that their coach is sick and against this there is neither criticism nor nuance: it is what it is and the club decided with good reason to hope that Tito heals, something much more important than any victory.

16. Crazy, throwing himself into attack as if there were no tomorrow, Pique was stopped by Iniesta in the San Siro with obvious gestures from his arms: ""Where are you going?!"" It's the symbol. Before, after conceding a treacherous goal, the team grabbed the ball out of the net, placed it in the middle of the field, and the first pass was to Xavi, as if to say: ""Take it, organize us.""  Now, the pass is to Messi: ""Take it, get us out of this mess."" And Pique, for his part, throws himself to the mountain. I exaggerate the note, of course, but it is a way to reflect the situation as it seems to me.

17. And the self-criticism. Nobody is so good as to be the best for eternity. Errors are not sins, only errors and we all commit them by the handful. The merit consists not in committing them, but in mending them and for this to reflect, define, and correct them. Someone as little reflective as Dani Alves said last night: ""We have had neither control nor long possessions."" That is to say, at least a footballer still nows what is the real problem: the play."	t5_2s561	True

The 19-man squad traveling to the Bernabeu: Valdes, Pinto, Alves, Pique, Puyol, Masch, Bartra, Alba, Adriano, Busquets, Song, Xavi, Cesc, Thiago, Iniesta, Messi, Pedro, Villa, Alexis

One will be dropped before the game, almost certainly Bartra (interesting that he was chosen over Montoya). Montoya, JDS, Tello, and Cuenca don't make the squad - no surprises there, really. Most importantly, Puyol will feature in his first Clasico this season! You can almost hear the merengues' knees knocking together at the mere thought of facing El Capita.

Real Madrid squad news: Ramos, Di Maria, and Coentrao are suspended. Pepe and Iker are injured. Marcelo was thought to be injured but r/realmadrid informs me that he is fit once again.

So Madrid are undoubtedly weakened as far as squad goes, but as far as their play, they're probably in their best run of form this season, having only conceded 1 goal over 3 games against Valencia. Both teams will view this game as a huge opportunity. Barca want to take advantage of a struggling Madrid, get some away goals and build up a lead before Madrid's full squad returns for the second leg. Madrid have been terrible in comparison to Barca all season and will be eager to knock us down a few pegs.

Tactical notes: it's not clear whether Mou will sit back and defend for a 0-0, or try to come out swinging, given that their attack is the strongest part of their team right now. Regardless, one thing is clear: we have to take the game to them. Too many Clasicos have now passed with us coming out flat and conceding a foolish early goal, then struggling back into the game. We have the best attack in the league, up against (most likely) Arbeloa, Varane, Carvalho, and a rusty Marcelo. Hit them hard and early, and it'll cripple their morale.

It'll be a tough game, but the opportunity is there - if we can leave the Bernabeu with a solid cushion, their return leg will be incredibly difficult (considering they'll have to play two Clasicos and the return leg against United in the span of a week).

Finally, I have made a gentleman's agreement with various r/barca redditors: if we win by 3 goals or more, I will run around my neighborhood in my boxers with a Barca jersey wrapped around my neck like a cape, and will of course post proof.

 I hope he is not going to announce his retirement or anything like that. Old or not, we really need him right now in the locker room to keep the stability going and as a leader.

As for myself, I'm from Brazil (Porto Alegre, Ronaldinho's hometown :))) and have been a supporter for the club for several years now, and whenever I talk about football with friends, they always joke and/or say that my Barça passion exists just because the team is kinda like a fad for the last years, no matter what I say about what I admire in the club, like the playstyle, philosophy, La Masia etc, most people don't take it seriously.
What is funny, is that some of the people that belittle my support for the team actually follow less information and watch less games from their teams than me, even though I'm really far away from Spain, or never go to their teams stadium. 
So, are all of you Barça supporters actually from Catalunya? What drew you into Barcelona? Do you think you can't be a ""true"" supported unless you're from the region of the team? Do people in your countries react like that when you say you're a Barça fan? I've been longing to hear foreign Barça fans opinion's on this for quite a while now. I try to support the team in however means I can (I watch all games, buy all seasons jerseys etc) but up until I joined this subreddit, I had no one to talk about this one subject I like so much.

ps. I still dream of the day I'll be able to afford a vacation to Barcelona to watch some games in Camp Nou!!!! :)

As far as our lineup goes, I pray to every god in the universe Iniesta doesn't start on the left again. Past that, our lineup is predictable. MVP up front, Xaviesquets in the middle, and Pique and Puyol in the center. The determining factor for me is whether we start Alves and Alba or give Montoya a run. Personally, I think we could use a bit more defense, but then again I'm not sure I'd match Montoya up against Ronaldo. Maybe Masch starts with Puyol on one side? I'm just fucking tired of conceding from the wings.

This will not be an easy game. Mentally, Madrid are surely in a better place than we are: they've got something to prove having lost the league, and they're amped up about the United clash in the league. Whereas we are top of the league, a bit dismayed and disorganized after the Milan game, but with the next leg two weeks away.

Okay, let's be real, I just described my mentality, not the team's. The team will rally and come in with spirit, cause it's a fucking Clasico. Still, can't deny that our porous defense and static offense of late worry me."	t5_2s561	True

_________________

**INTRODUCTION**


Over the past years Barcelona has experienced a golden era in terms of football, while also suffering through some painful episodes for its fans. Even if it hasn't always been reflected on the pitch, during this period fans and followers of the club have always believed that the essence of the team’s approach to football is a positional game based on possession and an offensive mentality. 

This idea, created or at least perfected by Cruyff, has been maintained to the present. What all coaches seek for their team, to develop a distinct style of play, FC Barcelona has achieved on an institutional level. All thanks to the fact that its fans, employees, players, coaches, board of directors and presidents have wished it to be so.

Josep Guardiola’s appointment as manager of the first team should be seen as the tipping point for this model. His exit put a lot of pressure on the current board of directors to maintain this approach by finding a coach and players that would adapt to it. This responsibility is now delegated to the new coach, who must fulfil his obligation to take care of it, improve it and sustain it, so that the fans can decide whether or not they agree that the club should follow this path into the future. 

In this historic moment Tito Vilanova takes the reins of a team and group of players who had given some indication that they had reached the end of their cycle. He takes over in at a very risky moment.  

The greatest risk is to fall into *decadence*, to forget the fundamental aspects of football that provide strength, vitality and energy to the sport.  In which entertaining the fans and searching for victory become mere reflections of the “genuine reality”. In which following the “Barcelona model” becomes an end unto itself that conditions everything and makes us forget the real goal: to win in a pleasing and entertaining fashion. 

The risk of Barcelona becoming a parody of itself and losing sight of the true objective is very real. Vilanova has the responsibility of not breaking with the footballing philosophy and model has joined the majority of the fans to their team. He will be responsible to keep the fans excited and happy during each match. 

Our goal is to analyze this new project. In order to understand where the ideas come from, before we continue we should provide some context for Tito’s team.

Competition: Champions League - 1/8 2nd leg

Camp Nou

Aggregate  FCB 0-2 ACM

-------------------------

If in the end we lose it will hurt no matter what, so I prefer going into the match optimistic, because it makes the buildup easier to deal with ;). So I'm going to call a 3-0 for Tito, just like Piqué.

Big questions going into the match are which one or two of  Xavi, Cesc or Thiago start, who will join Messi in the attack (Pedro, Alexis, Villa, Tello). 

I think Iniesta has to be in the midfield this match and I'd like to see Pedro and Alexis on the wings.

____________

**Barcelona Squad**: Goalkeepers: Valdes, Pinto.

Defenders: Alves, Piqué, Puyol, Alba, Mascherano, Adriano

Midfielders: Busquets, Song, Xavi, Iniesta, Thiago, Cesc

I am from Montréal and, as the title says, my first experience of a match in Europe was Pep Guardiola's last match in front of his home supporters. As a Blaugrana and in vacations in Barcelona, the setting couldn't have been better.

I just wanted to say how much my experience was way beyond my expectations. The anthem sung by 99 000+, the flags, the tifo dedicated to Pep, that Messi free kick, the penalties, the ceremonies, all of this sent shivers down my spine. I nearly lost it when Messi and the team went to celebrate his second penalty with Guardiola. Truly a magical moment. Even though I do not speak Catalan, it has been an honor to sing that mythical anthem with you, especially at the end of the game. You culés are truly deserving of such an amazing team (and city in general, I have to admit!).

Moltes gràcies a tots.

Stop acting like a crazy teenage girl and get out of Thiagos ass. He didn't want to play for us any longer!! His priority was himself not the club! 

Many of us come to this sub to read discussions about things that can help our club and other news regarding Barca! Quit spamming the sub with your whining. 

Thank You! 

Edit: I would like to apologize to everyone who got offended or angered by this post that was not my intent. everyone has their own opinion and they should all be equally respected. 

The reason I made this post was because of the amount of people continuously complaining about Thiago leaving. I think all of us find it upsetting that he left due to managements screw up and him wanting to leave, and some of us are even angered that he joined Munich. The complaining isn't doing us any good nor it ever will. But I think it is definitely time to stop the complaining and accept that he is gone and look forward to and discuss what other choices we have and what other changes we would like to see in the club.  I much rather look at the future of the club rather than the past. 

I wish Thiago all the success in Munich, so one day he can come back to Barca.  

Once again apologizes to those whom were angered by this post.

Next to iniesta he has probably the most intimate on field connection with messi. he is a player of the last two years who has completely molded his game to working with messi.
His surge in form at the last season showed me that adaptation period was over. I think in this friendly today Sanchez was easily the most impressive player (sergi was messi were amazing as well). 
He has always been excellent at setting up goals, especially messi, but now he has his confidence back and he is attacking the goal like a world class forward and still distributing amazing passes in the final third. 
No matter how good neymar is i am certain there is no way at least this season his build up and combination play will be as good with messi and the rest of the offense as Sanchez.

Tito's surprise lineup worked out well, with Cesc as the false 9 and Thiago-Busi-Xavi in the midfield. People complaining about Tello not converting his chances, but tactically he was very important with his runs to give the team depth in attack. Messi scores a brace in 30 minutes of play, Villa scores another goal and [dedicates it to his unborn son](http://t.co/FWL36Pob). Cesc, Xavi and Thiago all play great controlling the match. It's a good day to be a culé!

In the other match Navas/Cicinho walked all over CR/Marcelo and really the entire Sevilla squad just played with such energy it was impressive to watch. RM still just pounding the ball out on the flanks, when Alonso is marked out of the match they are too easy to defend. I thought Modric might give them more pause, but they didn't really feed him the ball."	t5_2s561	True

*[Official fcbarcelona.com calendar](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/calendar)

*[Official Google Calendar for Barcelona](https://www.google.com/calendar/htmlembed?src=spa_6162_%2542arcelona%23sports@group.v.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Budapest&amp;dates=20130701/20130801)

These two mislead me in the past (iCal format not refreshing, CL matches not included...) but if You think they are worth a try.

Instead this year I created my own calendar based on the one at fcbarcelona.com, and I promise **I will refresh it**. You can find it and subscribe to it [&gt;&gt;HERE&lt;&lt;](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3cnijnt06pa0qf5arv8vemlouo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Budapest).

A few useful info:

* The timezone for this calendar is GMT+01:00 (since I live in Budapest), but it can be easily set by modifiying the link. For example these are set for: [Bangkok](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3cnijnt06pa0qf5arv8vemlouo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Asia/Bangkok), [Chicago](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3cnijnt06pa0qf5arv8vemlouo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago), [Perth](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3cnijnt06pa0qf5arv8vemlouo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Australia/Perth), [Nairobi](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3cnijnt06pa0qf5arv8vemlouo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Africa/Nairobi), [Moscow](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3cnijnt06pa0qf5arv8vemlouo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Moscow)...

* Fixtures are mostly based on [the calendar on fcbarcelona.com](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/calendar).
* Until the official times and dates LFP games stay at saturday/sunday (tuesday/wednesday) all day long events with an '(unconfirmed hour)' note.
Taken from fcbarcelona.com:
""*The exact day of the match can not be considered definitive until the start time is shown. The day and hour will be decided approximately ten days before the match.*""
* The format for the calendar entries - Home matches: Atletico Madrid @ FC Barcelona ||
Away matches: Bayern München vs. FC Barcelona ( I will use this calendar from my mobile a lot, I want to see the opponent first, all the time for practical reasons)
* The calendar entries are 2 hours long

Of course I am open to any suggestions! (especially those, that doesn't sound like a lot of work)

-------------------------------------------------------


**David Villa: Surviving Barcelona**

He signed with Barça to face challenges worthy of his talents. His career had been a steady climb to the top: Sporting, Zaragoza, Valencia and finally Barcelona, a sustained arc of progression. It was May 2010. Naturally, Villa’s signing was seen as the Rubicon of his career. 

It was a big deal.

However, things turned out a bit differently. Signing with a world class club is sweet in some aspects, but also leads to anxiety in others. For starters, where would he play on Messi’s team, when the only forward for Pep was the Argentinean? He considered the spectre of Eto’o and Ibrahimovic, two forwards that had moved on with more disappointment than glory, as well as the situation of Bojan Krikic, who was still with the club but was clearly regressing month after month. It was written in the contract: Villa would play on the left, a position that he had already played with Spain, with Pedro on the other wing. It was a substantial change for the Asturian footballer, but playing for the Barcelona that won 6 trophies in a season was incentive enough. It was a personal sacrifice, but it was worth it.

The plan worked out well and Villa’s performance was satisfactory. *El Guaje* scored 28 goals his first season, including three very memorable ones: the two against Madrid in the 5-0 in La Liga and the beautiful goal in the CL Final against Manchester United. It was impossible to have the same protagonism he had in Valencia or playing for *la Selección*, but things worked out very well for him: score less goals in exchange for a European Cup and a Liga, two titles that he did not yet have. Pushed out to the left wing, asked to make runs and attack one on one from there, Villa tried to make the most of his ambidexterity, surviving in his new position, adapting with admirable aplomb despite the difficulty. Villa was an attacking *specialist* playing within a system that was increasingly dominated by versatile *combination* players who were all cut from the same mold, with Messi supplying the frenzied attack. How long could Villa shine on a team that was increasingly devoted to playing as many midfielders as possible? At the very least the risk was to be completely exposed, if not suffer outright ostracism.

And then came the horrible injury in Japan, which threw all plans out the window. Winning the Club World Cup was a nice addition to his successes – which is why he came to Barcelona after all – but the fractured tibia was the worst injury he had ever had in his career.  It meant he wouldn’t be able to play for 8 months, missing the rest of the season and the Eurocup. But in reality the injury came at a time when he was already in a delicate situation. Back then Villa was a substitute as much as a starter. Speculation started about his lack of minutes, his role on the team and his supposed unhappiness. The injury ended the speculation, but his prolonged absence cast further doubt into his future, or at least led to uncertainty. When he returned Pep was gone, replaced by Tito, and his role on the team was unknown and even today it’s still not clear. He has gained playing time as his physical conditioning has improved, showing himself to be effective when he has had chances. It’s possible that in Tito’s more *chaotic* Barcelona, Villa may have more opportunities to shine as a goal scorer, but at the moment his contributions are still mostly intermittent. What role will Vilanova give him when he is 100% in shape, if he’s not already? How many goals will he need to score to win a starting spot?

The question of what his role will be in Barcelona is difficult to answer and his ambiguous time in Can Barça is proof of this.  It’s quite strange to see the situation of the highest goal scorer in la Selección  (53 goals) and the 13th highest in the history of La Liga, with 166 goals. Years ago he could have landed in any big club in the world and churned out the goals playing his natural position, but he signed with the Barcelona *de los bajitos*.

And it made sense. And it still does. 

His role in Tito’s Barça does not have to be the same as what it was under Pep (in either season), so from this point on the future of Villa can be as great as we want to imagine. El Guaje is still a star striker on a team that has no strikers, which is a tremendous contradiction, which everyone hopes to overcome. Although Villa will be unable to play as a 9, unless Messi uncharacteristically gets injured,  he can still give us wonderful matches  playing from the left or anywhere else, as he has already shown many times. The team is no longer progressing toward playing with 10 midfielders, but rather it is moving toward a hybrid with different registers, which makes things easier for the Asturian. Now that his first period at Barça is over, with great expectations and various trophies and titles won, he now starts a new, totally unpredictable one in which he will try to recover his best football. The history of Villa at Barcelona is complex, filled with bittersweet episodes, of happy images with *reservations*, the striker pushed out on the wing playing with his opposite leg, the killer adapted to a new role, although he’s not a midfielder or a winger, the substitute for newcomers like Cuenca and Tello. In the end it seemed like Villa had to come to Barcelona no matter what, although sometimes surviving a top club can be the hardest test possible.

[Sport](http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/semana-clave-para-cesc-2407087) gave out a recent article on Cesc wanting to have a sit down with Tito this week to know what his role in the team will be for next year. 

Thiago seems to be doing the same by letting his father [flirt with other clubs](http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20130531/fc-barcelona/conversaciones-thiago-alcantara-real-madrid_54375032583.html).

As it seems, this is not a monetary issue, but one regarding the actual game. 

I would personally prefer for both to stay and have no changes to the midfield other than sidelining Xavi to give way for the two aforementioned. However, there are indications of them not being compatible with each other. Some communicational hiccups and small indecisiveness on who should take the corner kicks for instance. 

I made this [**GIF**](http://i.imgur.com/VrP1hYn.gif) to give an example on how their different styles might conflict in the future.

This might be very controvercial, but I also think Cesc feels threatened by Thiago. That's why he wants to force Tito's hand.

I am curious to hear how Barca was perceived before Cruyff...let's say in the 1980's. By then Barca had only won 10 Ligas (Madrid 24, Atletico 8, Bilbao 7) and zero champions leagues. So, we were very far from Real Madrid, and closer to Atletico Madrid and Bilbao. For example, I think that back then the most important Derby in Spain was not Barca-Madrid....but Atletico-Madrid!
Probably in the world Barca was just considered a 2nd tier team...such as Roma, Tottenham, and Valencia are today

To those who say we didn't take our chances, sure, but Madrid had plenty of chances of their own. Honestly, we just didn't play well enough today. Talking points for me:

* Messi dropped too deep, like he seems to do increasingly against Madrid - and he was completely anonymous. Alonso and Arbeloa were hacking away at him, and Varane was incredible, so maybe he was just trying to escape, but it hurts us and clutters the midfield. Too often Cesc was making the runs Messi should be - and Messi's the one we want burying those chances, despite Cesc's goal.

* I think we're seeing the limitations of the Cesc-Iniesta-Alba axis on the left. We did not use that flank enough today. Iniesta played amazingly, but came in too deep. Cesc was decent, but played mostly through the middle. Alba was left on his own to cover Callejon/Essien or Ozil/Essien, and thus didn't have the space to get forward enough. Moreover, they whipped in crosses from that left wing all day long, and that's what eventually led to the goal. Both offensively and defensively, e needed a real winger out there - to challenge Essien and make runs behind him, and to close down those crosses quicker on defense.

* Related: we simply didn't attack enough. Too often they had 6-7 people back in defense and we had only Pedro in attack. The team was static, staying back, not making enough runs. Only Alexis, Pedro, Alves and Alba showed any sort of off the ball movement - and our fullbacks couldn't get forward as much because of their threats on the counter.

* Our passing was sloppy in general - Xavi in particular had a terrible first half.

* The ref was shit on both sides.

* Our defense had an amazing game, Alves and Pique particularly. And God it's good to have Puyol back.

* Varane is the bane of my existence. I honestly think we just saw the birth of Real Madrid's version of Puyol. He's going to cause us problems for many years.

* If Villa has no role for us in big games, even as a supersub, and he wants to leave, why not sell him? It's ridiculous to keep him only for cup games or Osasuna when we could be giving minutes to youngsters like Tello and Cuenca. Disrespectful in my eyes.

Madrid put up a fantastic fight defensively, and our attacking firepower simply went absent. We were always going to concede at least once, but the fact that we only scored one, after leading the league in goals scored, is truly, truly disappointing. Oh well - we'll have to get them next time. Visca Barca. Nominate your **MOTM** below.

1345532698.0	ykjam	Pre match thread: Barcelona vs Real Madrid	poetical_poltergeist	37	5	78	"The first leg is going to be played in the Camp Nou. Tito Vilanova has a near fully fit first team (Abidal and Thiago the exceptions of course). On the other hand, Pepe is almost certainly out after the collision with Casillas in the match against Valencia. Di Maria is also a doubt. 

So how are you guys feeling about this game? I'm nervous, as is to be expected in a Clasico. What would you starting line up be if you were Tito?"	t5_2s561	True

1342808554.0	wvw5j	Announcement: Regarding recent events.	poetical_poltergeist	40	5	28	"So I'm assuming most of you are familiar with (what was unfortunately the top voted) post over on r/soccer, by a fairly regular poster here. I apologise for not posting about this earlier, but none of us knew what was happening at the time.

Now, he was banned for what a mod perceived as trolling, a ban which IMO he didn't deserve. I have lifted that ban, but the damage seems to have been done already, and he [says he doesn't care anyway](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/wu8kk/i_have_been_banned_from_rbarca_for_remembering_a/c5gqgty). I won't lie that I'm a bit disappointed that the first thing he did as soon as he was banned was go on over to /r/soccer claiming how he was banned for expressing his opinions as a true fan, opinions which ""the Americans who run this place won't understand"" (FYI only two of the mods are American, a few Spanish and other assorted varieties), and that he didn't message the mods inquiring why he was banned at all. 

The impression a lot of you seem to have been given is that this subreddit is a circle jerk, that only one opinion is tolerated whilst everything else is either downvoted or deleted, which is *not* true at all. Lots of people seem to have a similar complaint about every single subreddit on here, so that doesn't bother me too much; but I do hope that the posters who have been here a while will certainly realise that that's not true at all. Remember when Alves' celebrated against Rayo Vallecano by dancing, and half the people here were annoyed at him and the other half seemed to think they were being over sensitive pansies. Opinion has been divided about Cesc since he came, about Piqué's form and celebrity lifestyle etc. 

I also don't want people getting the impression that we ban people regularly, and this getting in the way of regular discourse. The ban list consists of 4 people (one of them a spam bot), and we always discuss before banning someone, except this time of course. 

In any case, the damage seems to have been done already, so I suppose the important part is how to deal with such events moving forward. We just reiterated that every single ban must be discussed by the whole group of mods beforehand. *All suggestions are welcome as well*! We're really not a bunch of draconian mods, this subreddit is usually very quiet and our job usually just consists of approving posts that the spam filter snagged, updating the sidebar and header image.

TL;DR cliffs:

- the_phet should not have been banned for perceived trolling, his ban has been lifted.

- A mistake was made, which all mods full responsibility for. Easier thing would have been to claim that it was a mistaken ban, or Reddit was acting up or something. Rest assured that it won't happen again, and this was an isolated event (again, 4 bans total in ~ 2 years here).

- Feel free to vent here (or rage at us if it so pleases you) and share your suggestions here, we sincerely hope that one small incident won't change your mind about the community here."	t5_2s561	True

1349529461.0	111gkf	Pre Match Thread: Barcelona vs. Real Madrid - El Clásico!	egcg119	42	6	55	"This might be one of the most interesting buildups to a Clasico since Mourinho arrived - impossible to tell who has the advantage going into this one. On the one hand, our lovely Barca have opened up a fantastic 8 point lead, undefeated in 6 while Los Blancos have struggled in the league. On the other hand, few of those wins have been convincing or dominant, and Madrid seem to be hitting form just in time. Moreover, our defense has been crippled by the losses of Pique and Puyol - Song's nearly guaranteed start gives us all some trepidation, but let's see if he can prove himself worthy of the price tag.

On a more positive side, Fabregas is on fire, Messi has four assists in two games, we have more forwards than we know what to do with, and Tito's midfield had their most dominant performance yet against Benfica, very reminiscent of Guardiola's Barca at their finest. We should be confident in our team, but not underestimate Madrid - with their backs up against the wall, they will fight for their lives, hitting our defense early and hard. I hope we've learned our lessons from the Supercopa. Expect the first 15 minutes of this game to be a scorcher.

Probable lineups:

Barca: Valdes, Alves, Masch, Song, Alba, Busi, Xavi, Iniesta, Fabregas, Messi, Pedro

RM: Casillas, Arbeloa, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Alonso, Khedira, Di Maria, Modric, Ronaldo, Benzema

Whatever your reasons are, I think it would make for an interesting story.  Please share them here.

I originally did not watch a lot of football. The only football I watched were World Cups as my father was a huge fan of Maradona and he used to support Argentina National Team. However, he wasn't much into club football. When I started college, I had a close friend who was a devout supporter of Arsenal. In 2006, just to annoy him, I wagered my bets on Barcelona for the Champions League Final of Barcelona vs. Arsenal. So I went to watch the match and was simply spell bound by what I saw that night.

1342425331.0	wmuwa	A summary of next year's B team	_sic	44	7	15	"I've been reading a bit about how next year's B team is shaping up, so I thought I'd summarize some of that information with just a bit of my own opinion thrown in. However, most of the subjective information is from people who follow the team much more closely than I. 

-------------------------

**Keepers:** Oier, Masip and Bañuz 

* Bañuz is being promoted from juvenile because they need a 3rd keeper for when Oier is included in the first team for CL weeks. It should be mentioned that this will be the 5th season on the B team for both Oier and Masip, which is perhaps a questionable decision.

**Defense:** Balliu, *Sergi Gomez*, Ayala, Lombán, *Grimaldo* and Planas

* Supposedly the B team is about to sign a CB called Lé, who can also play at FB and may sign Justé (from Nastic) to cover the RB position, but Nastic is demanding €3m, which would kill that deal. If Justé doen’t come we will need to find another RB.  

* Lombán is a 25 year old vet of limited talent who was signed to bring in experience. Some would argue that such signings are useless (think Armando, Carmona, etc.), because it cuts the progression of younger players, but I think that it's not a bad thing to have a few vets mixed in there. God knows that last season our defense lost a lot of leads due to stupid, inexperienced mistakes. 

* Ayala was promoted from juvenile and has a great future, so he will need minutes to grow. 

* In general terms the defense looks goods because Balliu is a versatile player who can cover several positions. LB is well covered by Planas, who will help our future superstar Grimaldo (16) grow. 

* The player who has to step up the most is Sergi Gomez, now that Bartra, Montoya and Muniesa are gone. 

**DM:** Gustavo, Ilie

* B team is also negotiating to sign the Portuguese player,  Agostinho Cá.

* According to some, Gustavo is probably not good enough for the team; Ilie on the other hand is very good, but he's coming off a year long injury, so it remains to be seen how he will bounce back. Cá, the Portuguese player, supposedly has a profile similar to Edgar Davids and with some polish may be good enough to make the first team some day.

**Midfielders:** *Sergi Roberto*, *Rafinha*, Jordi Quintilla, Patric and *Espinosa* (Joan Angel Ramón can also play in the midfield).

* As always the strongest part of a Barça team, although there is probably one too many, especially considering that Sergi Samper will probably need some minutes with the B team late in the season. Some are surprised that Quintilla made the B team, since he was a sub on the Juvenile (although it may have something to do with his promising brother Xavi Quintilla, who is a CB for the Juvenile).

* This year the most important thing is for Sergi Roberto to step up to the next level and Rafinha needs to continue to grow. I would also like to see Espinosa play a bit more, because he’s brilliant technically. I´ve also read that Patric is an interesting player. 

**Wingers:** Kiko, Lobato, *Deulofeu*, Miguel Angel, Joan Angel, *Tello*

* Joan Angel was just signed and could be a great addition. He played as a winger at Espanyol, but he can also play in the midfield. I´ve read that he may start along with Deulofeu. 

* I heard that Miguel Angel had a great first half of the season with the juvenile team last season, so he may be a surprise. 

* Although Tello still has a B team contract, it's doubtful he will play for the B team this season. He will either be promoted to the first team or loaned out to a first division club.

* Lobato and Kiko were both disappointing signings and should probably both be sold. This would mean that a winger would have to be signed. It's possible that only one will be sold though.

* The most important thing is for possible future world beater Deulofeu to continue to grow. He still needs to do a lot of work on his decision making.

**Forwards:** *Dongou*, Rodri

* Obviously, another forward needs to be signed, even though Rafinha can play a False 9 and that new forward should come with the sale of Rodri who was a major disappointment. I've heard that Paco Alcacer from Valencia would be a good signing, but it may be too late because he recently signed an extension with Valencia and Aduriz has been sent back to Athletic, so he may be their 2nd 9. 

* Also, Dongou needs real minutes. Last season he was only given garbage time at the end of matches by Eusebio. We need to see what he does with extended time on the field.

**Summary**: 

* Rodri, Kiko and Lobato were terrible last season and should probably all go. However, most likely only 2 of them will be gone and a new forward will be signed. 

* Players who are in negotiations: lé, Cá and Justé. 

* All in all a very young but extremely talented team whose success will probably hinge on signing the right forward once the dead weight is moved out. Expect an up and down season like last year.

* For me the most important goals of this team should be the progression of certain key players (in order) Sergi Roberto, Deulofeu, Rafinha, Sergi Gomez, Grimaldo, Dongou and to maintain the team in Segunda.  Secondary goals are to give players like Ayala and Sergi Samper some playing time so that they can continue to grow.

**Edit**: As vganguly points out, Espinosa is another player that we really need to nurture. Sky's the limit for him.

**Edit 2**: According to Barcastuff ""Official: B-players Oier, Sergi Gomez, Planas, Ilie, Lobato, Sergi Roberto, Kiko Femenia and Rafinha will start preseason with first team"". I imagine that for Lobato and Kiko it will be a way to put them on display before selling them.

**Edit 3**: Looks like the striker to be signed could be [Sergio Arujo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Araujo)

1371565864.0	1gl3m4	Some interesting thoughts form Euleri on the Thiago situation	NotSoFastMister	35	3	53	"[Euleri](https://twitter.com/euleri):

Thiago 2 linked dimensions: 1) whether he's sold; 2) how much he's sold for. Even if he does want to go-selling him for 18M is awful value

That 18M release-something Rosell &amp; the board lied about when Thiago was renewed-is incompetent management. That's on the club

Then this idea that no one could be bothered to monitor how many matches Thiago played-not Tito, Zubi, the board- is absurd beyond belief.

This narrative that this is entirely Thiago's choice is spin. Roselly &amp; the Board are spinning this issue to avoid being held accountable

Need to spin this issue is why there's been so many leaks about this in Catalan press. Barca wants to build that narrative-it's him not us

Just ask-why did the club lie about what Thiago's release clause truly was when he renewed? Creating this narrative-it's him-an extension

Seems to be major confusion about roles in midfield-orchestration focus v more ""attack focused."" Thiago's role-orchestration. Limited depth

Cesc, Sergi Roberto, Rafinha are not midfield orchestrators. Neither is Mata. None of those players can just step in &amp; ""replace"" Thiago

If Thiago leaves it's going to be on a very poor valuation &amp; will leave the team inadequately covered in midfield orchestration w Xavi aging

This is a far bigger issue than Thiago's decision alone. There's a context to that decision. And it's that context which is so troubling

The balance sheets of football clubs are comprised of the contracts of their players. Those are a club's assets. They have to be managed

For Barca to have completely mismanaged Thiago as an asset this way is pure incompetence. And Barca is now trying to spin it as his ""fault""

Someone at Barca needs to be held accountable for mismanaging Thiago's contract/situation. But that's point of this spin. ""It's not me"""	t5_2s561	True

_______________________________________

**The Panopticon of Sergio Busquets**

[Juanma Lillo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Lillo) once said, “show me your defensive midfielder and I’ll tell you what kind of team you are”. Busquets probably transcends the spirit of Lillo’s quote somewhat, but even so, by examining Busquets, you can trace the path that Barça has followed ever since Guardiola gave him a starting position on the first team.

Busi emerged in Guardiola’s squad, just when Pep was beginning his term on Barça’s bench with poor results. That season he ended up winning the triplete, and although the usual starter at DM was Yaya Toure, the *canterano* played a great deal, putting in quality minutes. In fact, injuries in the defense at the end of Guardiola’s first season gave him a starter’s role in the key moments of the season, including the Champion’s League Final. And Busquets never gave it up.

In that period, Busquets was the DM partnered with Xavi, with everything that implies. Xavi was the rudder, a footballer who started as a [4 and ended as a 6](http://www.notasdefutbol.com/historia/los-dorsales-y-su-leyenda), but even from a more advanced midfield position he continued to be the team’s compass. Therefore, Xavi needed a DM at his side that would give him the pivot when he dropped deep and allow him to mark the team’s rhythm, a partner in support and continuity. And so Busquets, who started as a 6 and ended as a 4, was the perfect man for the job. This explains why with barely a season in top flight football he would so clearly win the starting position from one the most dominant DMs in European football.

In both the 4-3-3 and the 4-2-4 that Pep used his second season, or the more recent 3-4-3, examining how Busquets played was key to understanging how the team functioned. For example, one of Guardiola’s last innovations was his CB-DM hybrid role.

Under Tito new horizons are opening up for the player. The early approach implemented by the new coach included wide open wingers and a double pivot. Busquets suffered in this scheme, the same as Iniesta, Villa and Alexis… With a more traditional 2 (CB) in the center, this structure increased the distance between players and made it more difficult to create passing triangles. In this setup the support and continuity provided by Busquets had less importance  and when the team lost the ball he was farther away, making it difficult for him to press, one of his most valuable contributions to the team. Moreover, behind him the CBs were in a constant state of panic, compounding the problem.

However, after the strategic Liga matchup vs. Madrid, and once the large gap in points was consolidated, Vilanova started working on his new concepts. Since then the double pivot has practically disappeared and Xavi is increasingly playing a more advanced position so that the team needs to alternate its helmsman. In Tito’s new system, which is closer to a **2-3-3-2** (see below), Busquets is frequently the player who plays the ball out from the pivot. If the team has difficulty playing the ball out from the back, the advanced midfielders drop back to lend support, but the basic plan is for them to be more advanced. But to make it easier for Sergio, Tito has created a “panopticon” structure which allows the DM to always find a passing lane. 

The panopticon model, which can be seen in the [architecture of some penitentiaries](http://www.google.es/imgres?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;tbo=d&amp;biw=1097&amp;bih=609&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=0BtOsI6a9SzkHM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.digitalcrossrhodes.com/2009/10/panopticon/&amp;docid=kH3x36I14jIgpM&amp;imgurl=http://www.digitalcrossrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Presidio-modelo2.JPG&amp;w=1840&amp;h=1232&amp;ei=pL_BUOD2HqSI4ATZy4HQBg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=123&amp;vpy=63&amp;dur=3486&amp;hovh=184&amp;hovw=274&amp;tx=173&amp;ty=123&amp;sig=116933858202647236064&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=140&amp;tbnw=203&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=18&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0,i:87) as a way to increase surveillance and security, and which [Michel Focault popularized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticism#Panopticism_in_Foucault.27s_Discipline_and_Punish) when he extrapolated it  as a way to understand how modern society functions, allows everything to be monitored from a central point. Surveillance from the center. 

This is how Vilanova uses Busquets, transposing what would be lines of surveillance in a prison to passing lanes on a pitch, so that Sergio from the pivot has many options when playing out from the back. In front of his position Busi has the most productive connection: Xavi, Cesc and Messi, who almost form a 3 man line. Iniesta, when he plays in the midfield replaces one of either Xavi or Cesc. Constantly creating passing lanes behind the defenders is very difficult to stop. Further up the pitch, in wide positions to start, the wingers wait. Passing long isn’t one of Busquets’ strongest qualities, but he has improved in this aspect the last few seasons.

To the right and left Busquets has an easy pass to the FBs who are positioned practically in parallel to his position. It’s an easy way to beat a press that closes down the three mediapuntas, so that Sergio doesn’t have to risk losing the ball. This is the evolution from Abidal to Alba. The first line no longer has 3 men (2 CBS + 1 FB), but rather the FBs simultaneously join the first line of midfielders (DM + 2 FBs).  Finally, behind him, he has the traditional support of the two CBs.

In Vilanova’s Barça, Xavi’s role has evolved and by extension the DM role has evolved as well to include more responsibility playing the ball out from the pivot. Busquets doesn’t have the same footballing qualities as Pirlo, Xabi Alonso or Guardiola, but even so he continues to be one of the key players on the squad match after match. Of course, Tito makes it easy for him.

Find CBs that Barca HASN'T been linked to who are possible to get and would be a good fit.	egcg119	36	7	38	"This is mostly a fruitless exercise, as Barca have never been known to be great for scouting, but I thought it might be useful for people. We get so locked in to what we read in papers that we think those are the only options out there. I checked Sport's latest suggestions for defensive options, and they were all 4 Premiership defenders: Agger, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Vertonghen. Of the four, only Agger is a vialbe option. Lazy journalism. So I got sick of the papers, and wanted to do some investigating for myself. So I went out looking for other 18-year-olds than Marquinhos, I'd rather be the one buying them for 2m then buying them a year later for 35m.

My vote at this point would be Agger and a cheap youngster. Euler seems convinced we should shell out money for Mangala, so that's an option too I guess.

Doria: Brazilian, 18, plays for Botafogo, has done well for U-20 national team. Linked to Europe and Barca once or twice. What I saw on Youtube I didn't love, he seemed pretty big and slow, but others rate him very highly.

Ezequiel Munoz: 22, Argentine, plays for Palermo. I really like this guy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cPzKTc8uIQ. Quick, seems to read the game well and make good tackles. Was called up for Argentina by Maradona. Moreover, Palermo have been relegated this year, so he could actually be feasible: found a twitter source saying he's likely to leave this year. Here he is on whoscored http://www.whoscored.com/Players/70733, not bad statistics at all.

Other names I came across: Zouma, Umtiti, Diego Reyes (just signed for Porto, damnit).

So that's what I have to start. What we do as fans has absolutely no impact on Barca's eventual decisions, but I personally feel a lot better having spent half an hour or an hour doing some scouting of my own, getting to know the market. I feel like I gained information from this, rather than getting hyped up over what Sport and MD tell me to do. People are saying Marquinhos is the next Thiago Silva - he might well be, but none of us actually know him, we're just listening to what we're told. Whoscored, Google, Transfermarkt, Wikipedia, and Youtube are all your friends. "	t5_2s561	True

---------------------------

 

**Line-up Barcelona:** Pinto - Montoya, Sergi Gomez, Bartra, Adriano - Dos Santos, Song, Sergi Roberto - Alexis, Messi, Tello

**Bench Barcelona:** Oier, Neymar,Kiko Femenia, Bagnack, Planas, Patric, Ilie, Espinosa, Samper, Dani Nieto, Dongou, Joan Roman

---------------------------

 

**Match Events**

0' - Kick off! - After a minute of silence, the 3rd pre-season game is under way.

5' - Messi in the attack, out to Alexis, tries to give it back, but Messi slips.

8' - A long corner by Dos Santos finds a completely free Alexis at the 5m area who can't get the ball on goal properly.

9' - Gdańsk with a lot of fouls already.

9' - First sub for Gdańsk already.

12' - A long ball by Messi finds a barely offside Tello.

14' - Bartra intercepts a ball beautifully, passes it back to Pinto who doesn't pay enough attention, corner Gdańsk.

15' - **GOAL! BIENIUK!** with a beautiful header after the corner.

22' - Tello coming off for Joan Roman. ""Tello presumably subbed off out of precaution, with thigh mucle discomfort.""

26' - **[GOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!! SERGI ROBERTO!!!](http://i.minus.com/ibyCV3qp6sRszz.gif)** Alexis puts it out for Montoya, who lays it across, right for Sergi who comes running into the area.

32' - Second sub for Gdańsk.

39' - Dos Santos somehow finds himself at the end of a cross, his attempt clearly misses though.

40' - Pinto with a sloppy clearance that finds a Gdańsk player, luckily nothing comes off it.

45+2' - Messi with a free kick right on target, but Jan Bak saves it.

**HALFTIME** One great goal by Sergi, one goal by Bieniuk after a completely preventable corner.

46' - Subs: Oier for Pinto, 2 changes for Gdańsk.

50' - **GOAL! GRZELCZAK!** runs through the defence and put it into the back of the net.

53' - Next Messi free kick goes over the goal.

56' - Nearly the third for Gdańsk, but the header goes over the goal and it was offside.

57' - **[GOOOOOOOOOOL!!! MESSI!!](http://i.minus.com/ivgvLyvyrQHr3.gif)** chups it over the goalkeeper after a nice pass by Alexis.

65' - Kiko Femenia, Planas, Bagnack, Patric, Samper, Ilie and Espinosain for Montoya, Sergi Gomez, Bartra, Adriano, Dos Santos, Song and Sergi Roberto

**New line-up:** Oier - Kiko Femenia, Planas, Bagnack, Patric - Samper, Ilie, Espinosa - Alexis, Messi, Joan Roman 

66' - First team debut for Macky Franck Bagnack (18).

70' - Neymar and Dongou have started to warm up.

77' - Dongou in for Messi.

79' - Neymar makes his debut, coming on for Alexis!

80' - Another sub for Gdańsk too.

83' - And another Gdańsk sub.

87' - And another... meanwhile all we see is one foul after another by Gdańsk.

90+3' - Gdańsk with the last chance of the game that misses the target.

**FULL TIME** 2-2, could have easily been more (or rather less for Gdańsk). Last 15 minutes was more fouls than football, not nice to see in friendlies at all.

The club were hit by Bayern Munich with a 4-0 defeat in this week’s Champions League semi-final first leg to lead to suggestions in some quarters that the Catalans were reaching the end of an era.

*“There is no change in the cycle. There is a structure, a club, a continuity,” the Vice-President told Catalunya Radio today.* 

*“We will make touches this summer because every year we have to improve.*

*“This is not like in 2003, when we were not winning titles. We have a solid base of players. Barca do not see next year as without Messi, Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets.*

***“The new project is already underway. We already spoke about that in New York. There are some parts that are pretty advanced but we cannot say anything.***

*“There are positions we need to strengthen. That’s life as the years pass. It is something that our Coach is managing very well.”*

Vilanova missed two months of this term at the club to receive treatment in New York for cancer that had returned to one of his salivary glands.

However, Bartomeu has maintained the club’s line that he is continuing on in the role for next year.

***“Tito Vilanova will lead the club next year. For one thing we have a contract and we trust him.***

*“It was not easy to make the transition and he has done a great job.*

*“It has been a very difficult year for him personally and at a sporting level, but the management has been done very well.*

***“We will make four or five signings this summer, we have to shake up the squad, whilst we have players in the Barcelona B team.”***

Transfer speculation is that Neymar is on his way to the Camp Nou in the summer.

***“The signing of Neymar has not been done. He is a player of interest to us, as I have said, and we will see what happens at the end of the season.***

***“He has a contract with Santos whilst we have not heard that he wants to leave Santos. If says he wants to leave, we will be one of the clubs trying to sign him. He is a request from our coaching staff.”***

Bartomeu also reflected that the League remains the club’s top priority this campaign.

*“The League is the first target. It has been difficult but getting to this points difference is to be celebrated because it is not easy.*

*“It is confirmation that the project has a future perspective.”*

The Vice-President also made clear that the club must be optimistic ahead of next week’s second leg against Bayern.

*“It’s hard but we can cause an upset [in the return leg]. Everything is possible. Madrid believe in their comeback and we also have to believe.*

*“Our players are the same as always, they have won many titles. These players are capable of anything because they are extraordinary.”*

So with this in mind, while we watch how this league unfolds, after RM matches if there is something of interest to our community (RM dropping points) we will allow one post about it where everyone can go nuts if they need to. We only ask that the title of the post be more along the lines of ""Thank you Santi Cazorla"" or "" The lead is cut to 6 points"" rather than ""Fuck You Real Madrid"" or similar. Let Pep's class and elegance be your guide when posting your titles. Remember, one post is enough, the rest will be politely removed.

Anyone else seeing what I'm seeing? ;)

I'd say we let some Barca B players play for FC Barcelona against Espanyol. If Girona manage to win the game, the last two rounds will get really interesting: Barca B play Villareal and Girona play Almeria. If both Catalan teams win, Girona would be places second before the last round against Real Madrid Castilla while Villareal and Almeria play against each other. 

Pretty exciting and specially given as FC Barcelona already won the title and Barca B secured their spot in Segunda Division this would give us something to root for! I'd like to see a third Catalan team in La Liga!

So, don't forget to follow our Barca B match thread next sunday at 12:00 (local time) while the other two Catalan teams play the Barcelona derby at 20:00."	t5_2s561	True
1367557055.0	1dlp6v	Our Defensive Numbers: 09 till date	felandath	35	6	19	"Its now an accepted fact that our defense is poor, mainly because of our bad luck with injuries and of course not buying a CB in the summer. Here is our Goals conceded per game record (All official matches) -

- 2005/06: 0.84

- 2006/07: 0.92

- 2007/08: 0.97

- 2008/09: 0.89

- 2009/10: 0.66

- 2010/11: 0.63

- 2011/12: 0.74

- 2012/13: 1.18(!)

This is our worst performance in the last 7 years. We are shipping more than a goal a game. What is worse is our defensive capitulation in matches this season (where we concede 3 or more goals a game). Following is the number of games we have conceded 3 or more goals.

- 2005/06: 5

- 2006/07: 4

- 2007/08: 7

- 2008/09: 3

- 2009/10: 1

- 2010/11: 2

- 2011/12: 2

- 2012/13: 5 (with 5 matches remaining)

This is our worst performance since the Rijkaard era. Of course these statistics are greatly affected by the results against Bayern. But, we are so dazzled by our attacking records that we ignored how good we were defensively as well during Peps time. Defense is the key. I hope our rebuilding strategy is based on a foundation of good defense.

However, I'm also delighted with the successful experiment of a new formation that could mean a new role for the best player in history.

Please, if you haven't read this post take a look at it, I feel that it is not getting enough attention, the piece by Zonal Marking that /u/doccoyote63 posted a few hours ago:
http://www.zonalmarking.net/2013/03/13/barcelona-4-0-milan-tactics/

Barca used a new formation (that I love):

      Pique    Masch     Alba

               Busi
         Xavi         Iniesta
              Messi
  
     Alves    Villa    Pedro

- Alba clearly received instructions to play an ""Abidal"" role, in other words, to stay in defense. He did that pretty much all the game until he ""disobeyed"" and scored a goal on an amazing run. This tactic of having three defenders while Alves roams upfront is not new, Guardiola used it in most of his games.

- The revolution was using Villa, not as a winger, but as pure 9. It has been said before many times that Barca can't use a striker because Messi is there. This could be the end of that. If you read the Zonal Marking's article, Messi himself asked for this tactic:

&gt;Interestingly – as mentioned after Barca’s Copa Del Rey defeat against Real Madrid – in the match against Sevilla (immediately after Barcelona’s defeat in Milan) Messi commented on the positive impact of Villa playing upfront. “With Villa up front in the second half, Sevilla’s centre backs couldn’t move forward, which gave me more space,” he said. Nothing mind-blowing, but it’s quite rare for Messi to comment upon his side’s tactics.

Messi himself asked for this formation. Amazing.

It gave us three improvements:

1) We still have width, with Alves on the right and Pedro on the left

2) Messi is free. This is thanks to Villa distracting the CBs. Villa scored this time, but he doesn't even have to, just by being there he is doing a lot.

3) We have a decent defense, finally. Alba was great buy following instructions and staying in defense.


I'm sure we will see this formation in the future, but, do you think it will become the next most important formation? Will Messi complete another transformation and become a true 10?

&gt;Sons of Koeman, of Johan, my brothers!

&gt;I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.

&gt;A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends, and break all bonds of fellowship; but it is not this day!

&gt;An hour of Mou, and shattered shins, when the Age of Messi comes crashing down; but it is not this day!
This day we fight!

&gt;By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of Pep!

1370505329.0	1fs1r9	Mythbusting: Neymar edition	imyourcookie	52	26	9	"One of the inevitable results of the increasingly international scope of club football is the spread of myths and player reputations across the globe. Most football aficionados – be they fans, journalists, or even players – only follow a handful of teams or leagues in detail. Yet through the media, through a handful of high-profile Champions League or cup games, through YouTube highlights of catastrophic goals or errors, and, most importantly, through the all-important video games like FIFA, we are bombarded with information that makes us feel like experts. Some of us may recognize that our knowledge is incomplete, but it is much more difficult to confess “I simply don’t know much about X” or stay silent when you have been exposed to news stories and discussions about X every month or two. So as we fans talk to each other or post on message boards, these reputations reinforce themselves, and reputations begin to take on lives of their own, developing into myths. Although I am by no means an expert on Brazilian football, I’ve done a bit of research on new blaugrana boy Neymar, and I’d like to bust some myths today.


Myth 1: Neymar is inexperienced and untested. We’ve all said this in some form or other: Neymar is moving from Brazil straight to an elite European league, and he simply hasn’t performed at the highest level yet. While it’s true that the overall quality of Brazilian teams is not quite up to La Liga’s level, you may not know about the most prestigious competition in South America, the Copa Libertadores, CONMEBOL’s version of the Champions League.

In 2011, at the age of just 19, Neymar led Santos to the Libertadores title, scoring the winning goal in the 2-1 victory over Uruguayan club Peñarol in the final, being named “man of the match” in the process and voted player of the tournament. This was an enormous milestone in Santos’s history: the last time they won the Copa Libertadores was 1963, led by none other than Pelé himself. Pelé may be a horrible, narcissistic pundit, but in this particular vein Neymar’s comparisons to O Rei are grounded in an incredible achievement.

Myth 2: Neymar is selfish and lazy. Since 2011, Santos have unfortunately gone downhill. In 2012, they sold Neymar’s best friend and talented playmaker, Paulo Henrique Ganso. Previously Ganso had been able to feed Neymar excellent passes, allowing Neymar to thrive as a finisher on the left wing. With Ganso gone, the creative role fell increasingly on Neymar, who like Messi, often dropped back as far as half-field to pick up the ball. Now responsible for the creative burden as well as goalscoring, Neymar’s play in recent months occasionally appeared selfish as he embarked on long solo runs in the middle of the park, yet in reality he often simply lacks players of quality to pass to.

But Neymar has also responded to the challenge, demonstrating excellent passing skills and totaling 14 assists in 48 games in 2012 – in addition to his 41 goals. Nor is he lazy: as Spanish football writer Lee Roden writes, “Contrary to the stereotypes lazily thrown around regarding players hailing from his nation, Neymar works hard. Very hard. He wants the ball, and will pursue whoever has it until he gets it.” Work-rate is incredibly important in a Barça forward, but Neymar’s physical frailty belies an unflinching determination to win the ball back and help his team.

Anyone who watched the Olympic games in 2012 should have already taken a stance against accusations of laziness and selfishness.

Myth 3: Neymar is arrogant and immature. If you followed Neymar’s presentation on Monday here at totalBarça and listened to his press conference, you know this myth to be far from true. If not, I highly recommend you do. Despite exhaustion from the flight and the overwhelming experience of his first day at Camp Nou, Neymar proved himself adept at handling the press. Faced with questions clearly meant to draw out an ego for the tabloid headlines, Neymar reiterated his admiration for Xavi, Iniesta, and Messi, dismissed comparisons of himself to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and past Brazilian greats, and expressed no concern over his shirt number at Barca. On less hot-button issues, the Brazilian expressed humility and honesty about the year ahead: “I think it could be a difficult change for me, but I believe that I need to adapt quickly so that I can have a normal life and so that I can bring joy to the fans.”

Myth 4: Neymar is an outrageous luxury purchase at €57m. Put down the pitchforks – I am by no means defending Rosell, nor arguing that Neymar will necessarily be a success at Barcelona. I hope he will be, of course, but here I wish to simply add some nuance to the financial aspects of the deal. Fifty-seven million is a huge sum, especially when players of similar quality like Lucas, Hazard, and Götze have all moved for around 40m euros. But there are two mitigating factors. First, Neymar is one of the most marketable players on the planet. In his time at Santos, the club’s marketing revenue quadrupled, while their TV rights deal tripled between 2011 and 2012 alone. Brazil’s economy has been growing, and the spending power of South America should not be underestimated. Neymar could earn back a large chunk of his transfer fee in the next year or two alone.

Second, although this will inevitably remain rumor as the club has sworn confidentiality on the financial aspects of the deal, Nike may well have subsidized part of Neymar’s transfer to Barcelona, according to Tom Conn from Inside La Liga and Andreas Vou from Mundo Deportivo. Spurred by Sandro Rosell, a former Nike executive in Brazil, the American sporting giant is believed to have part sponsored Ronaldinho’s landmark move to Barcelona back in 2003. According to these sources, now that Rosell is president of FC Barcelona, a similar scenario has occurred again, with Nike contributing anywhere from 11-19m euros in order to send Neymar to Catalonia. Faced with late, expensive bids from Adidas outfits Chelsea and Real Madrid, and with other Nike icon Cristiano Ronaldo locked up at Madrid for the foreseeable future, it is quite easy to imagine Nike backing Barcelona to ensure the protection of their brand. The economic realities of such a high-profile move in today’s world of third-party deals, image rights, and brand sponsorship are complicated and always shrouded in secrecy, but it is silly to imagine the sum of 57m as simply a giant pile of cash handed over in a briefcase. Neymar may prove to be any number of things at Barcelona, but with Rosell in charge, a bad business deal likely isn’t one of them.

In many ways, Neymar is emblematic of the new world market for football. Gone are the days of Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, talented Brazilians who could ply their trade at smaller European clubs and build up a reputation before moving to the top level. But unlike compatriots Oscar and Lucas, who moved from Brazil to top clubs as relatively unknown players, Neymar’s reputation has preceded his arrival in Europe by several years, developing into polarizing myths of either “future legend” or “flop.” Now that he has at last arrived in Barcelona, we owe it to ourselves to try to get to know the player, not the phenomenon.

League is all we have left, no need to rest players, so expect Tito to come out strong in order to clinch the league. Still, if Xavi starts I'll be disappointed.

1366843745.0	1d1jn4	Yet another summer transfer thread (over 15 players analyzed)	astral_cowboy	33	3	102	"Brace youselvers, summer is coming. And it will be a hot one indeed. I've assembled and briefly analyzed a few options that the team might consider for the summer transfer window. This is my take on what the team needs to do.

**BUY**

* Winger

1. Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior ""Neymar"" (Santos FC): A no-brainer. We need someone to help Messi upfront relieve him of all the pressure from the opponents. Neymar's a versatile winger, makes a decent amount of goals, and he may bring a surprise element to our attacks. He will be expensive, but he might bring back the old magic Ronaldinho used to have and give us many, many smiles. Since signing him is very likely to happen, I won't analyze that many options for wingers, except for two exceptional ones. (40M)
2. Sergio Agüero (Manchester City) - If for some reason we can't get Neymar, ""Kun"" Agüero could be our target. We've all seen what he's capable of, and is one of Messi's closest friends in the Argentine NT. The biggest drawback could be his price: Manchester City bought him from Atlético for $45M, and that tag isn't likely to go down *if* Manchester wants to sell. Since he's one of their most important players, pushing for Agüero seems rather unlikely. (60M)
3. Gareth Bale (Tottenham Hotspur) - One of the most dangerous wingers around, Gareth Bale pure muscle, speed, and talent. His style may be too direct for our style of play, although that might also be for good. Just like Kun, his biggest drawback could be his price tag and the recluctance from Tottenham to sell him (if they don't give any preference to Real Madrid because of their recent collaboration deal). Bottom line: Signing Bale is highly unlikely.

* Center-back 

1. Marcos Aoás Corrêa ""Marquinhos"" (AS Roma) - He's young, quick and tough. Buying him might be an investment for the future, our very own Varane. But he also may be a big bet, and become another Henrique or Chygrynskiy (poor him, we should've kept him). If we were to buy him, he should slowly start playing. Keep in mind that, being that young, he *will* make mistakes, some of them might cost us games. But if polished the right way, he could shine.
2. Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) - At 24, he's ready for prime-time. Buying him might give us a more solid defense, increase our team's height. If we were to buy him, he should be played instead of Puyol. Although I haven't seen him play that much, one of the disadvantage lots of people mention is his speed and that he wouldn't add anything substantially different to what we already have with Piqué and possibly Bartra. Also, his price tag will likely be very high and if Lewandowski leaves (as rumors indicate), it will be hard for BVB to let go yet another player (Gotze).
3. Héctor Moreno (RCD Espanyol) - This lad has played well this season with Espanyol. He's a solid defender and has great long-passing skills -- something we seem to have lost since Rafa Márquez left. He's tall, and knows La Liga. Most likely, we won't break the piggy bank if we were to buy him. Also, at 26, he might be a good investment for a few years.
4. Vicent Kompany (Manchester City) - At 27, he's getting old. We should consider him only if we're running out of options and need a solid defender for the short term.

* Striker

1. Robert Lewandowski (Borussia Dortmund) - I swear I started to write these before their game against Real Madrid. He's a top-notch finisher that has scored 30+ in both, this season and the last. He can give us the so-desired height we need. He's also young (24) and if he proves to be the striker we're looking for, it might mean we're settled for years (unlike Ibra and Villa). He's bound to leave BVB at the end of this season (which can lower his cost) and half of Europe will be looking for his services (which can increase his cost). Unfortunately, rumors are placing him in Bayern Munich. If these rumors aren't true, we definitely have a chance at getting him. A pure striker such as himself can open up many possibilities Villa should've opened up but never quite accomplished (due to tactics, etc).
2. Edin Dzeko (Manchester City) - A very effective striker and along with Agüero, one of City's best goal scorers for the last two seasons. Likely transferred during the summer and Borussia Dortmund seems interested in him. At 27, he's still young to perform at his best, but most likely won't be a safe bet for the long-term.
3. Mario Gomez (Bayern Munich) - He's set to leave at the end of this season and is definitely one of the best poachers around. Unfortunately, his style of play might not completely fit Barça's as he's rather static. While he adds height that could favor our set pieces or benefit from crossings, it seems he might suffer the same fate as Ibra. 
4. Javier Hernández (Manchester United) - Just as Mario Gomez, this lad's one of the best poachers around. He's also hard working and an overall nice person that might fit well in the team. A potential drawback is his height, at 1.75m, he might struggle against big and tall defenders. He certainly has a touch for goal, but sometimes that might not be enough. Rumors place him outside of Old Trafford this summer, and although Fergie has discarded that option, you can never know.
5. Fernando Torres (Chelsea FC) - Expensive and most likely won't happen.
6. Lucas Podolski (Arsenal FC) - Most likely won't happen.
7. Luis Suárez (Liverpool FC) - A big No-No. At some point he was linked with Barça (thanks in part to his agent being Pere Guardiola, Pep's brother). He's definitely one of the best strikers around, but his recent contract extension (til 2016) and his continuous antics. 
8. Radamel Falcao (Atlético de Madrid) - Expensive and most likely won't happen.
9. Wilfried Bony (Vitesse) - He's the current top goal-scorer for the 2012-2013 season of the Eredivisie. I've seen him play a few times and he seems to be quite fast and lethal. Having almost no media coverage, he could be a discrete signing, which could reduce excessive pressure. He could also be a team player that might not expect to play every single game (unlike a big signing) and wait for his chance to unleash the beast within. He might not be that expensive.

* On buying a goalkeeper...

This baffles me a little. There are some possible scenarios:

1. Sell Valdés. The club can sell Valdés and buy a promising goalkeeper. There aren't many available GK around, Ter Stegen being one of the few. However, I believe the above positions have a higher priority, and making too many changes at once might be detrimental to the team. 
2. Keep Valdés. At this moment, we don't need a goalkeeper since Valdés is doing just fine. We might still have a chance at renewing his contract, which would be great for the team. But if we don't, we can certainly take the loss, hold him this next season, and buy a keeper the next one. I think we should cut our losses and opt for the one that affects us the least. Are we fine with Valdés? Yes. Do we need to sell him because he's not playing well? No. Financially it doesn't make a lot of sense. But football-wise it might.
3. Sell Pinto and promote Oier. Pinto's getting old. He'll turn 38 next season and that might leave us in a weaker position in Copa del Rey. We don't have the option to not renew his contract, since he recently extended it until the end of the next season. If we don't sell him, the club will need to get another goalkeeper next year, either Oier Olazábal or buy yet another one (depends on the Valdés outcome). If we do sell him, we will give him minutes from Copa del Rey and we could have him and a GK we sign competing for playing.

.


**SELL**

* Ibrahim Affelay (Schalke 04) - No surprises here. He doesn't add anything different to what we already have. He's been injury-prone, and hasn't been able to deliver on the oportunities he's had. (5M)
* Bojan Krkic (AC Milan) - Same as Affelay. During his time at AS Roma and AC Milan, he never really showed any special that might actually make the squad any better. (8M)
* Jonathan dos Santos - He's had very few oppourtinities during this season, and next one doesn't seem like this is going to change at all. We're overbooked on his position and will likely be for the next years. (5M)
* Alexis Sánchez - He's been given plenty of opportunities without really delivering. He isn't the goal-scoring machine he was at Udinese (granted, he played in a different position), plus, he doesn't seem to be able to make an impact on big games. He's labeled as a hard-worker, which he is, but that's not enough to play at Barça (we also have other hard workers such as Pedro and Tello). If sold, the club might get a descent amount of money for him. (15M)
* David Villa - It will be hard to see him leave since he's one of my favorite players. However, he isn't getting any younger nor faster. Having him on the team means giving Tito some extra ""pressure"", partly because of his status a hierarchy in the Spanish NT. We don't want any drama any time he doesn't play. His contract is also about to end next year, so it's sell and make some money, re-new him, or let him go free next year. The club could potentially trade him to Dortmund for Lewandowski (doesn't sound like a far-fetched idea). Wenger might also be interested in him, with his recent Spanish crush. (20M)
* Javier Mascherano - A big surprise here. He's an A-class player, with a B-class role within the team. He's not suitable for being a CB, and Busquets isn't going anywhere. He's excellent at destroying opponent's game, but unfortunately, he's too short and lightweight compared to Song. I definitely see our team in need of Song rather than him because he can add some muscle in times of need. Most likely he won't be sold, but if he is, he can bring in some serious money (I'm sure many teams from Serie A could be interested) (25M)

**Pellegrini** is a good coach, so it's not going to be a cake walk but our squad is at the healthiest point in the last couple of years. **Isco** is going to be a threat so Busquets will have to keep his eyes on him. They're likely to play a 4-5-1 or 4-4-1-1 with Isco feeding the lone striker during counter attacks.

.


I'd personally would like to see some experiments done once in a while.

This is the most interesting setup I can imagine:

**Iniesta - Villa - Messi**

**Cesc - Xavi**

**Busquets**

**Alba - Puyol - Pique - Alves**

Iniesta, Alba and occasionally Cecs will run wild at the left flank. Messi and Alves will draw 2 or 3 defenders from the right side. This leaves a ton of space down the middle for Xavi, Cesc and Busquets to supply Villa, who will play a classic center forward role. This might leave our defense at risk a little bit and would not be very effective against the style employed by Celtic and Chelsea. If Malaga does play a deep and compact defense, we'll have to move Messi into the middle and bring on Pedro.

Anyone know if Tito is back?

--

The football world hold their breath as the 2 giants of the sport were about to clash. No one could have predicted the outcome at Nou Camp. We saw the full power of this Barça, with their extroardinary scoring capacity and that, their coach, Pep Guardiola, had perfect reading of the rival. We analyzed 'El Clásico' from the winners perspective, a Barça team that put Madrid's project to shame. Before that, a few thoughts on Real Madrid. This Mourinho's team still has a long way to become the much glorified team the press makes out to be. There will be lots of opinions surrounding this game, it will be a lot of talk about Marcelo's bad performance (He was transcendent, althought not the worst). The reasons of yesterdays failure are lots of tactics and little to do with attitude. ""The Special One"" still doesn't have the competitive team Madrid's press claim. This Madrid has cracks and this shows when the pressure elevates.

The result was a consecuence of the great understanding Guardiola had of Madrid's issues and because of the style of a legendary team. Once I said this, let's analyze.

**1 - Many people expecto to see Marcelo fall, except Guardiola.**

The weakness on the left-back (Marcelo) had been said before the match, people expected Alves+Pedro+Xavi to work Marcelo side and win his back. Nonetheless, Pep chose another target to kill Madrid: Sergio Ramos. Although Marcelo got substitued and was transcendent… Sergio Ramos is the authentic victim of this game. Ramos fell apart against the Villa-Iniesta couple, they were always 2 against 1. Even after the 2-0 and after Mourinho's tactical changes, Ramos kept being the target.

Let's start discussing Barça's defensive attitude and their positioning at the time of starting to touch the ball. We saw a Barça high-pressing, not allowing Madrid to connect more than a few passes at most times. Casillas was starting Madrid's game from defense by throwing long, but even that way Barça recovered the ball with ease at their own side of the field, or even better Barça steal the ball on Madrid's side by high pressing.

Barça's circulation of the ball start from the defense, with 3 defenders to out-number Madrid's first line of pressure, plus Xavi and Busquets ahead of the defenders. Xavi starts the game beginning plays and ends up finishing a few. Outstanding game of Barça's number 6, less important on the finishing touches than on other matches, but key on starting the plays from midfield, and even scoring a goal. His would be the 1st goal. The 2nd important tactical thing defensively speaking is stoping Cristiano Ronaldo's counter-attack, for that the left-or-right back that is playing on Ronaldo's attacking place stays defending and Pique plays on the opposite side of CR7 to stop Di Maria's run. Pique acts a false right-or-left back instead of a central defender. Pique plays slightly ahead of Puyol to touch more the ball and give passes to the midfielders, and Puyol helps in the back to stop and watch CR7. Avoiding losing the ball on their own midfield, secure tiki-taka circulation of the ball on midfield and not giving CR7 any chances are the key defensive tactics Pep prepared for El Clasico.

FOTO 1 http://i.imgur.com/qugxf.jpg

For this Barça doesn't play with a pure Center Forward, Pedro and Villa play very open, Villa sticking to the line of the pitch and Iniesta cutting slightly inside. Behind them 2 playmakers: Xavi and Messi. Ronaldo starts playing as a Right Wing, so the Iniesta+Villa association is the key of the game. Barça plays with more intensity on Ramos side, who always finds himself playing against 2 players: Iniesta in the interior and Villa as a Left Wing.

FOTO 2 http://i.imgur.com/3x7Xf.jpg

Messi never acted as a forward, his function was to just be there, helping Xavi and Iniesta, and to outnumber Madrid's midfield. Iniesta's mission was to help Villa to beat Ramos and Xavi's was to organize, and even to try get to the box to shoot. Lionel Messi was constantly moving between Madrid's lines, mostly ahead of their Defensive Midfielders. His sole presence intimidates and attracts attention. The space behind Khedira is where Iniesta plays and helps Villa. Pedro shows up in the box to drag Pepe, hence allowing Iniesta to receive the passes.

FOTO 3 http://i.imgur.com/v4wJy.jpg

If Iniesta changes position, no problem at all. Barça has an obsession: Sergio Ramos. Barça always looks out for Madrid's right side.

FOTO 4  http://i.imgur.com/cX1Py.jpg

The 1st goal is born out of this. Messi organizes, Pedro drags Pepe, allowing Iniesta+Villa to outnumber Ramos. Xavi sees lack of surveillance to run ahead. Madrid collapses when they can't close Iniesta's game and even Carvalho misses and Marcelo fails at closing Xavi's run. All of this is born because Barça outnumber Madrid on midfield.

FOTO 5 http://i.imgur.com/L6xZJ.jpg
FOTO 6 http://i.imgur.com/z13mb.jpg

The 2nd goal comes the same way. Iniesta+Villa &gt; Ramos. Villa plays a Left Wing, sticks to the white line on the 1st half, then Marcelo gets beat by Pedro. The absence of help on Ramos side, plus Marcelos defensive issues cost 2 goals to Madrid. Barcelona knows how to win this game: attacks Ramos side and finish on Marcelo's.

FOTO 7 http://i.imgur.com/pSRCx.jpg

Mourinho tries to react against the whole that is the lack of help on Ramos side. He switches his wings, now Di Maria closes on the righ and CR7 starts from the left side. Guardiola reacts ipso-facto, he switches Pique and Puyol. Pique pays on the opposite side of CR7 and Dani Alves goes less in attack. Now Abidal has the permission to attack because he defends the opposite CR7 side. There are 2 ideas behind this: Give more space to Pique to play the ball and to wide up the team with a left-back.

FOTO 8 http://i.imgur.com/PEe7B.jpg
 
This doesn't present an issue on Guardiola's election on wich side to attack. Even Mou takes Di Maria's help off Marcelo. Pep sticks to the script. His obsession is to blast Madrid's right side. Iniesta+Villa never get out of character, and even if in the opposite side appear open spaces, the total and absolute victim of Pep is Ramos.

FOTO 9 http://i.imgur.com/XXl9m.jpg

**2 - Cristiano Ronaldo's journey, a partially resolved situation.**

Having resolved Barça's attacking ways, now they only have one task left: stop Madrid's counter-attack. They did well, except on 2 times. CR7 is the Madrid's key man. On his 1st chance he finds a chance after Abidal goes up to counter-attack, then he crosses to Di Maria. On such a high-level match, these situations can lead to have a score sheet that doesn't truly represents what happens on the pitch. After this, Barça corrects this problem.

FOTO 10 http://i.imgur.com/licL0.jpg

This never happens again, Guardiola prevents the right-or-left back to go on attacking. The 2nd CR7 chance comes from an anomaly. Alves goes attacking and Pique watches his back, but CR7 does something unexpected, he starts diagonal run without a ball taking advantage of the misplacement of Pique and Alves.

FOTO 11 http://i.imgur.com/yR4Aw.jpg

From there CR7 passes to Benzema and Abidal saves in-extremis. This was Madrid's best chance, it's kind of odd they didn't tried this again. This was the only thing that caused Barça problems.

FOTO 12 http://i.imgur.com/fwFIF.jpg

**3 - Messi+Villa the 2nd half deadly connection.**

Overwhelmed by the 1st half, Mourinho modifies his XI. Lass gets in, for many this was a defensive change. Nothing farther from the truth. Lass allows high-pressing and stops Abidal+Alves to go on attacking. The change is offensive but fails. Messi as a playmaker and assists Villa with his runs.

FOTO 13 http://i.imgur.com/SsNYT.jpg

The game because homogenous, less space for Iniesta. That's when Messi hulks out, as a playmaker, as a true 10, organizing, assisting, conducting. He intimidates and makes the 3 Madrid midfielders to constantly watch for him and close his passing lines. Villa acts as a Center Forward, slightly to the left. He looks out for the space between Ramos and Pepe, and kills them from there with speed and right timing.

FOTO 14 http://i.imgur.com/rRQMZ.jpg

The third goal appears like this, Messi receives ahead of the Madrid's midfielders and filters a pass between Pepe and Ramos to Villa. Always the same, with the same results. Guardiola says once again, and again who is the absolute victim today: Ramos.

FOTO 15 http://i.imgur.com/zJ5ze.jpg

To finish punishing Ramos, Messi finds Villa again. This time is a counter-attack, Villa starts from the left, wins Ramos back. If Barça doesn't have the ball, Villa keeps intimidating Ramos as a Left Wing, that leaves Pepe a little helpless.

FOTO 16 http://i.imgur.com/WhtH5.jpg

From there, with a 4-0, Barça just keeps posession, avoids losing the ball maybe humilliate more Madrid with tiki-taka style who can't get back the ball. Pep's boys make the game a ballet performance and is only when Jeffren and Bojan get in that Barça goes on attack again. These 2 boys want more and the 5th goals arrives to an extasis explosion on Camp Now.

*Conclusion*

The humilliation is monumental. The distance between these 2 is supernatural. Madrid opens up a very dangerous door, their supposedly defensive strenght is put to shame. Pep has shown the ways to beat this Madrid, always speaking in therms on 9-10 level teams, those who can win the Champions League. Coaches around Europe now have arguments against Mourinho's side. A defeat this size has more consequences long-term.

On the contrary, Barça keeps feeding their legend. The play by their own terms, but shows big flexibilty when needed. The know how to read the weakness of their rivals and never play with the same ways. Empire Barça. Genius Guardiola. This team is from another planet.

1354624964.0	149cnr	Pre Match Thread: Barcelona vs. Benfica (UCL)	egcg119	32	4	36	"Squad announced: Valdés, Pinto, Montoya, Piqué, Sergi Gomez, Puyol, Adriano, Planas, Thiago, Dos Santos, Busquets, Song, Sergi Roberto, Villa, Messi, Deulofeu, Rafinha, and Tello. 

Not sure how I feel about Puyol in the squad. On the one hand, we're short on CBs, and he could be a great help mentoring the young defenders. On the other hand, if he gets injured I'll punch a baby. I'm really glad Tito brought a B-team CB though. And we've got a string of tough matches coming up for which I'd really like him to be healthy.

For context, in the same fixture last year, our sixth group game against Bate Borisov, our lineup was: Pinto, Maxwell, Bartra, Fontas, Montoya, Thiago, JDS, Sergi Roberto, Rafinha, Pedro, and Cuenca. We won 4-0.

Not sure which lineup I'd like to see. Personally, I think it'd be silly for Messi to play in a game that has no mathematical significance whatsoever, I'd rather he play against Cordoba. But if he wants to, he will. Assuming that he does:

              Pinto
    Montoya Gomez Puyol Planas
               JDS
          Thiago Roberto
      Rafinha Messi Villa

Reasoning: Song will get game time elsewhere, the young'uns won't. JDS needs to keep getting tested before January. I want to see Roberto shine in a first team game. Thiago needs to roll back into form, and watching him linkup with Rafinha would be a delight, like it was last season. Up front, I think it's overkill to start both Messi and Villa, but I think Villa needs to play and Messi seems to want to. Both should get subbed off in favor of Tello and Deulofeu at some point though."	t5_2s561	True

45+1' - Tello with maybe the [best chance](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzt61u_tello_sport), his curling shot goes just wide.

**HALFTIME**  - A really boring 0-0 at half-time.

49' - A cross from Tello is easy pickings for Courtois.

51' - **[GOAL! Falcao](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzt6jr_atc-1-0-fcb_sport)** gets to the ball after Barca's defence can't get it away.

87' - Diego Costa with a chance, but Pinto saves for a corner.

90' - **yellow** Insúa for a handball.

1361219065.0	18rr03	Thoughts on Neymar, flair, and immaturity (an old topic, but just thought I'd share recent thoughts anyway)	egcg119	40	13	23	"So I watched two videos today, by a youtuber named rom7ooo:

One was a [Messi vs. Ronaldo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUMFxK3D2I8) that was quite well done, and really made me appreciate Ronaldo's ridiculous talent. 

The other was a [Neymar video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEJGJkOT9nU).

In the Neymar video, I realized that the moments I hated most were the ones where he was standing still, facing a defender, and did some moronic footwork or a rainbow. This is the mark of an immature player to me, and it reminds me a lot of Ronaldo at United. Everyone used to make fun of him for just doing endless stepovers and then falling on his face. But I know that the second Neymar moves to Barca, this shit would stop, because if he tried even one rainbow, Tito would bench him and Puyol would slap him silly.

So without the immaturity of those tricks, what might we have on our hands? Well, I still can't help but seeing the similarity with Ronaldo. Watching him mature, he has gained muscle, discipline, and consistency - but he has retained an extremely creative flair, as seen in the video above. Backheels, quick stepovers or chops, and juggling over a player are *extremely useful* when used appropriately. It's an element of surprise that, if used quickly and sparingly, can leave a defender in the dust. We saw it with Ronaldinho, but we also see it occasionally with Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta - backheels or juggling not to look fancy, but because it's effective and the defender simply doesn't expect it. Flair can be used to showboat, but once a player matures and learns when to use it, it becomes an incredibly useful tool to have in your arsenal.

Neymar, I think, has that creativity in spades. Watch him when he's dribbling at speed or receiving a pass - he is incredibly difficult to predict, and that makes him dangerous. I'm not sure the same can be said of our current wingers. They are impossible to predict off the ball, and they are immensely hard-working and efficient on the ball, but they rarely take on defenders or catch them off guard. Ronaldo does. Ronaldinho always did. And I think Neymar can. More importantly, the maturing process we've seen with Ronaldo, from an obnoxious asshole kid doing tricks on the wing, to a powerful, explosive, creative forward, provides precedent and gives me faith in Neymar's potential.

Sorry if I wasted your time with a tired discussion, it just seemed to me a useful point that I hadn't really seen made so far in these threads."	t5_2s561	True

23 games. 17 goals. 10 assists. 1 hat-trick, 4 braces.

He has scored in every Supercup game they have played head-to-head. He has not scored in a CdR match against RM. Only 4 games where he did not have a goal or assist. All this in 2079 minutes out of 2100. 

Incredible.

*Camp Nou Saturday 21/04 20:00h*

For the first time that I can remember both teams are coming into the clásico after losses. This is also one of the most crucial clásicos in recent memory, with the league hanging in the balance. If Barcelona win the lead is cut to just 1 point, not a death blow to Madrid's title hopes, but it would definitely be a psychological advantage for Barça going into the final matches. 

One can imagine Mourinho longingly watching Chelsea's display of, ahem, defensive football, as it is precisely what he wants to do when he plays against Barça. But, of course, he doesn't have the team to play that way; what he has is a team that is 100x better than Chelsea. It has been reported quite a bit in Spain that there has been a season long power struggle between Mourinho and the clique of players closest to him (CR7, Di Maria, Pepe, Coentrao, Marcelo) and the rest of the squad, with the majority of the team just wanting to play good football against big teams instead of closing up shop like Mourinho has them do against Barcelona and complaining about referees when it doesn't work out. I don't know how true this is, but I do know that if RM comes out to play and gets after the match, we will have our hands full. If they come out with a trivote and try to win a draw, we will win. I'm 100% convinced of this. 

Bad news: Alexis is doubtful for Saturday's match. Apparently he was visibly limping when he came off the plane today. 


So what lineups do you want to see?

1309178548.0	iaa6t	Why I'm 100% behind buying Sanchez and Cesc	_sic	32	3	39	"I've been doing some reading on the DiarioYoya forums recently that has convinced me that these two signings would be the best thing our team could do to keep progressing. Let me try to explain the major points.

**The situation.** Mascherano recently had an interview where he said that almost all teams start on the wings and move to the center, but that Barcelona was different in that everything started in the center. *With this in mind Mourinho has decided that to beat Barcelona he has to flood the midfield with highly aggressive players and force Barça to try and win from the wings*. During the four clásicos this was evident: Xavi, Iniesta and Messi were often practically man marked by Pepe, Xabi and Khedira and Alves marked by Di Maria. This man marking left space on either wing that Barcelona was unable to exploit because our wing players, while great, are no good at one on one situations, Villa in particular could not get around Arbeloa or Ramos. Pedro had slightly better luck against Marcelo, but mostly because of Alves wreaking havoc, a luxury that Villa doesn’t have on the left. In fact, one of the main reasons for Barça’s lack of goal production in the second half of the season was that opposing teams like Valencia were flooding the center of the pitch and practically leaving the wings to Barça where they are less effective (and Pedro and Villa severely overworked). 

*One thing we all know about Pep is that he’s never satisfied and he always trying to stay ahead of what other teams throw at Barça.* If we look back we can see after each of his seasons at the helm he’s tried to change up tactics and bring in new players to execute those tactics:

**Year 1.** The big problem was teams pressing high up the pitch against us. Guardiola thought that with a target man at the 9 we would be able to mix up our game with good outlets and secondary play.  So he went out and bought Ibra. In some respects this worked out well as one thing that people overlooked with Ibra was how well he would come down to the midfield and receive long outlet balls from Valdes when the other teams were committing 5-6 players pressing up high. He would often bring down the ball with two players hanging on him with insulting ease. He would then give nice passes to streaking players like Pedro or even Bojan. We destroyed teams like Tenerife that were pressing up high, largely thanks to Ibra’s presence. However, while he provided what Pep wanted in this regard, he slowed the team down with his lack of movement up top which robbed the team of depth. 

**Year 2:** to counteract the lack of mobility and loss of depth caused by Ibra’s more static game, Pep brought in Villa, whose movement has been spectacular this season, and to be honest for such a little guy he is amazingly effective at receiving long outlets to counteract pressing teams even when marked by much bigger players in the midfield.  So problem solved, but this has given rise to new problems on another level, the tactic of midfield flooding that I mentioned up top.

**Year 3.** With teams intent on flooding the midfield, this season it became more and more difficult to distract opponents on the wing to make space in the center of the pitch for Xavi, Iniesta and Messi (did you ever ask yourself why Pep was progressively moving Villa and Pedro further and further out on the wing? By the end of the season both were basically stationed right on the sideline, making it harder for them to score, but providing just enough distraction to pull defenders out and give more space to the midfield artists).  Madrid will increasingly use this tactic, as most of the new signings are not superstars, but rather players who will be willing to sacrifice themselves executing Mourinho's negative tactics of man marking and roughing up Barça's midfielders.

**So what’s the solution?** *Clearly Alexis Sanchez*, a player who can receive the ball out on the wing and dominate defenders one on one, something that neither Pedro nor Villa (or Afellay) can do with any regularity.  Some are even comparing him to Messi, pre-Guardiola: unstoppable on the wings, bold, strong, tough to bring down and with such good technique that it outshines even his startling physical attributes. Can you imagine bringing an insane dribbler like Alexis on for Villa or Pedro if a team is giving us the wings? It would be like throwing a hand grenade into the center of the pitch, the way the bunched up defenders will be scrambling to cover his runs from the wing. I'm pretty sure that Arbeloa, Ramos and Marcelo would pay money from their own pocket to ensure that Sanchez ends up in England instead of Camp Nou.

*I would also argue that Cesc enters into this equation* because Pep might want to expand on what we did in Anoeta this season when Xavi played the 4 for a stretch of the match. This might be an option along with Cesc and Iniesta that allows the team to keep the ball in the midfield for 80-90% possession to close out matches or against teams that are only interested in defending. It’s true that Cesc is not as brilliant at distribution as Xavi or at mazy runs like Iniesta but he’s still very good at both. Cesc is a polyvalent midfielder that gives a little bit of everything, including Keita’s offensive push and Busquets’ one touch passing. He’s also much more aggressive and persistent when pressing opponents than either Xavi or Iniesta and probably looks for goal more than either of them as well (although Iniesta seems to have turned a corner this season in this regard). His ability to plug into different spots makes him an invaluable substitute and sometime starter.

**tl;dr Alexis gives Pep a new tactical variant and Cesc allows him to take his main approach to a new level.**

1362162746.0	19h53f	Pre Match Thread: Real Madrid vs. Barcelona	egcg119	29	3	60	"19-man squad traveling to Madrid: Valdes, Pinto, Alves, Adriano, Alba, Pique, Mascherano, Puyol, Bartra, Busquets, Song, Thiago, Cesc, Iniesta, Pedro, Alexis, Tello, Villa, Messi

Xavi out for 10-15 days, thigh injury has returned on him - he could be out for Milan again. I suspect he never really fully recovered from it, and that could be part of why he hasn't been as sharp of late. Montoya also out of the squad, which is rather strange. Still no sign of Abidal. 99.9% probability Bartra is the extra man dropped out for the game.

If Adriano's fit, I'd rather he start than Alba, and have him play a bit more reserved. Also remains to be seen if Messi recovers adequately from his fever - we might see him subbed off, but I'm certain he'll start.

My hopeful lineup:

    Alves Pique Puyol Adriano
             Busquets
           Cesc Iniesta
        Alexis Messi Villa

Also, Madrid are in a tricky situation, cause they have to rest some players for United and the league's already lost for them, but they're playing at home and can't simply play B-teamers. So it'll be interesting to see what balance Mourinho strikes. The only annoying thing is that as far as post-match bragging goes, we're kinda in a lose-lose: if they lose, they'll say ""oh, we rested players,"" and if we win, they'll laugh and say we can't beat their subs. Still, a win is absolutely essential for morale, and hopefully for putting them back in their place before the United clash.

Reminder: Kickoff at 4:00 local time, which means the game will not be televised in the UK."	t5_2s561	True
