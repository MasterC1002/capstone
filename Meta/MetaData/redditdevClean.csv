1287513673.0	dtg4j	Want to help reddit build a recommender? -- A public dump of voting data that our users have donated for research	ketralnis	232	50	70	"As promised, here is the big dump of voting information that you guys
[donated to research](http://reddit.com/ddz0s). Warning: this contains
much geekery that may [result in discomfort for the
nerd-challenged](http://www.flickr.com/photos/33809408@N00/1053349944/lightbox/).

I'm trying to use it to build a recommender, and I've got some
preliminary source code. I'm looking for feedback on all of these
steps, since I'm not experienced at machine learning.

## Here's what I've done

* I dumped all of the raw data that we'll need to generate the public
  dumps. The queries are the comments in the two `.pig` files and it
  took about 52 minutes to do the dump against production. The result
  of this raw dump looks like:

      $ wc -l *.dump
       13,830,070 reddit_data_link.dump
      136,650,300 reddit_linkvote.dump
           69,489 reddit_research_ids.dump
       13,831,374 reddit_thing_link.dump

* I filtered the list of votes for the list of users that gave us
  permission to use their data. For the curious, that's 67,059 users:
  62,763 with ""public votes"" and 6,726 with ""allow my data to be used
  for research"". I'd really like to see that second category
  significantly increased, and hopefully this project will be what
  does it. This filtering is done by `srrecs_researchers.pig` and took
  83m55.335s on my laptop.
* I converted data-dumps that were in our DB schema format to a more
  useable format using `srrecs.pig` (about 13min)
* From that dump I mapped all of the `account_id`s, `link_id`s, and
  `sr_id`s to salted hashes (using `obscure()` in `srrecs.py` with a
  random seed, so even I don't know it). This took about 13min on my
  laptop. The result of this, `votes.dump` is the file that is
  actually public. It is a tab-separated file consisting in:

      account_id,link_id,sr_id,dir

  There are 23,091,688 votes from 43,976 users over 3,436,063 links in
  11,675 reddits. (Interestingly these ~44k users represent almost 17%
  of our total votes). The dump is 2.2gb uncompressed, 375mb in bz2.

## What to do with it

The recommendations system that I'm trying right now turns those votes
into a set of affinities. That is, ""67% of user #223's votes on
`/r/reddit.com` are upvotes and 52% on `programming`). To make these
affinities (55m45.107s on my laptop):

     cat votes.dump | ./srrecs.py ""affinities_m()"" | sort -S200m | ./srrecs.py ""affinities_r()"" &gt; affinities.dump

Then I turn the affinities into a sparse matrix representing
N-dimensional co-ordinates in the vector space of affinities (scaled
to -1..1 instead of 0..1), in the format used by R's
[skmeans](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skmeans/index.html)
package (less than a minute on my laptop). Imagine that this matrix
looks like

              reddit.com pics       programming horseporn  bacon
              ---------- ---------- ----------- ---------  -----
    ketralnis -0.5       (no votes) +0.45       (no votes) +1.0
    jedberg   (no votes) -0.25      +0.95       +1.0       -1.0
    raldi     +0.75      +0.75      +0.7        (no votes) +1.0
    ...

We build it like:

    # they were already grouped by account_id, so we don't have to
    # sort. changes to the previous step will probably require this
    # step to have to sort the affinities first
    cat affinities.dump | ./srrecs.py ""write_matrix('affinities.cm', 'affinities.clabel', 'affinities.rlabel')""

I pass that through an R program `srrecs.r` (if you don't have R
installed, you'll need to install that, and the package `skmeans` like
`install.packages('skmeans')`). This program plots the users in this
vector space finding clusters using a sperical kmeans clustering
algorithm (on my laptop, takes about 10 minutes with 15 clusters and
16 minutes with 50 clusters, during which R sits at about 220mb of
RAM)

    # looks for the files created by write_matrix in the current directory
    R -f ./srrecs.r

The output of the program is a generated list of cluster-IDs,
corresponding in order to the order of user-IDs in
`affinities.clabel`. The numbers themselves are meaningless, but
people in the same cluster ID have been clustered together.

## Here are the files

These are torrents of bzip2-compressed files. If you can't use the
torrents for some reason it's pretty trivial to figure out from the
URL how to get to the files directly on S3, but *please* try the
torrents first since it saves us a few bucks. It's S3 seeding the
torrents anyway, so it's unlikely that direct-downloading is going to
go any faster or be any easier.

* [votes.dump.bz2](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/votes.dump.bz2?torrent) -- A tab-separated list of:

      account_id, link_id, sr_id, direction

* For your convenience, a tab-separated list of votes already reduced to percent-affinities [affinities.dump.bz2](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/affinities.dump.bz2?torrent), formatted:

* For your convenience, [affinities-matrix.tar.bz2](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/affinities-matrix.tar.bz2?torrent) contains the R CLUTO format matrix files `affinities.cm`, `affinities.clabel`, `affinities.rlabel`

## And the code

* [srrecs.pig](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/srrecs.pig), [srrecs_researchers.pig](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/srrecs_researchers.pig) -- what I used to
  generate and format the dumps (you probably won't need this)
* [mr_tools.py](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/mr_tools.py), [srrecs.py](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/srrecs.py) -- what I used to salt/hash the user information and generate the R CLUTO-format matrix files (you probably won't need this unless you want different information in the matrix)
* [srrecs.r](http://redditketralnis.s3.amazonaws.com/publicvotes-20101018/srrecs.r) -- the R-code to generate the clusters

## Here's what you can experiment with

* The code isn't nearly useable yet. We need to turn the generated
  clusters into an actual set of recommendations per cluster,
  preferably ordered by predicted match. We probably need to do some
  additional post-processing per user, too. (If they gave us an
  affinity of 0% to /r/askreddit, we shouldn't recommend it, even if
  we predicted that the rest of their cluster would like it.)
* We need a test suite to gauge the accuracy of the results of
  different approaches. This could be done by dividing the data-set in
  and using 80% for training and 20% to see if the predictions made by
  that 80% match.
* We need to get the whole process to less than two hours, because
  that's how often I want to run the recommender. It's okay to use two
  or three machines to accomplish that and a lot of the steps can be
  done in parallel. That said we might just have to accept running it
  less often. It needs to run end-to-end with no user-intervention,
  failing gracefully on error
* It would be handy to be able to idenfity the cluster of just a
  single user on-the-fly after generating the clusters in bulk
* The results need to be hooked into the reddit UI. If you're willing
  to dive into the codebase, this one will be important as soon as the
  rest of the process is working and has a lot of room for creativity
* We need to find the sweet spot for the number of clusters to
  use. Put another way, how many different types of redditors do you
  think there are? This could best be done using the aforementioned
  test-suite and a good-old-fashioned binary search.

## Some notes:

* I'm not attached to doing this in R (I don't even know much R, it
  just has a handy prebaked skmeans implementation). In fact I'm not
  attached to my methods here at all, I just want a good end-result.
* This is my weekend fun project, so it's likely to move very slowly
  if we don't pick up enough participation here
* The final version will run against the whole dataset, not just the
  public one. So even though I can't release the whole dataset for
  privacy reasons, I can run your code and a test-suite against it

1345496292.0	yjk55	Proposed change to the 'users online' count for low values (&lt;100)	alienth	147	19	146	"Hola all,

As of right now, if the number of online users that are on a subreddit totals fewer than 100, the metric simply displays the value as ""&lt;100"". I purposefully took a very conservative approach to this, as giving a more detailed metric for small count of active users has some potential privacy implications. For example, in a very small subreddit with a limited set of active users, you could do some analysis and an educated guess at when a group of those individuals are on reddit. The less active the subreddit, the more educated the guess. It's a bit of a reach, but I decided to err on the side of caution.

Since the feature was rolled out, the general response seems to be that people want minimum display value lowered. Here's my proposal on how to execute that, while still minimizing the potential privacy problems.

Just as it is now, the metric will be accurate for values of 100 or greater. However, if the true count is fewer than 100, a random jitter will be added to fuzz the true value. The jitter will be the largest for very small counts, and exponentially decreases as the true count increases, reaching a jitter of 0 when the true value is 100. For example, a true value of 0 may display anywhere from 0-6, a true value of 40 may display anywere from 40-43.

Additionally, low values will be cached on the back-end for 5 minutes. This prevents someone from rapidly sampling the fuzzed values to determine the true value.

I also recognize that some subreddits simply want to hide low values. To easily allow for this, I will also be adding a ""fuzzed"" CSS class to any value less than 100. This will allow subreddits to hide the low value fuzzed numbers, while still displaying higher values. Of course, the count can still be hidden entirely via CSS, just as it is now.

Please let me know any thoughts or concerns you might have regarding this proposed change.

cheers,

alienth

**tl;dr** Users-online will be display all the way down to zero, but low values will be fuzzed and cached for a period of 5 minutes to protect privacy."	t5_2qizd	True

Hello Reddit developers! [ketralnis](http://www.reddit.com/user/ketralnis) [wrote the following message below a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/dtg4j/want_to_help_reddit_build_a_recommender_a_public/). After leaving reddit, the project got put on the back burner. We still have the same problem introducing people to new reddits and the [reddit search](http://www.reddit.com/reddits) is still terrible. After reading the recent reddit blog post about introducing more reddits into the default set, this project needs to be revived more than ever. 

I am hoping you can help revive this project and make it a reality! Together, we can make reddit a better place.

Please criticize me! This will be an ongoing thing, I will be coming back to posts and fixing things. I want to know what you think.

So after poking around in the reddit source code like a blind man for a while, I thought that the only way to motivate myself to understand it is to explain it to others, so here it goes.

I will try to explain things at a source code level. I will not be explaining how to deploy the server, or anything like that, there are already tutorials about that. Mainly, I'll be referencing the source tree and specific files a lot. I'll try to submit diagrams every now and then to illustrate certain points better.

**Pylons**

Reddit is a web-app. It uses a Python API called Pylons to deploy the webserver and handle all calls. Pylons basically does everything. When you submit a link, view comments, or just go to reddit.com, what happens is that the relevant information is sent to Pylons which then processes it according to the reddit API.

As [eurleif](http://www.reddit.com/user/eurleif) once said about [his popular Pylons based website](http://www.omegle.com), Pylons has very little documentation and tutorials available. So I'm going to break it down as simple as possible and then break it down some more.

Pylons facilitates using a MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to deploy a web application. This means that there are three components of the web-app and they work separate from one another. I'm not going to go into the particulars of MVC, you can google that yourself. I'm going to work with them in order of simplest to most complicated.

**Controller**

The controller is the portion of the code that facilitates calls from the client (you) and the server (reddit). For example, if I would go to ""http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming?sort=new"" the controller takes the ""r/"" portion of the URL and processes it and whatever follows it, doing whatever the code tells it to do. In this case, it strips out every part of the URL after '/r' and passes that on to the middleware, which we will discuss later.

In Pylons, this basically means that when a call is made, the code looks at a map of calls to controllers located at [/config/routing.py](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/config/routing.py) and instantiates the appropriate controller class located in the files in [/controllers](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/tree/master/r2/r2/controllers) and calls the mapped function. The function then returns a complete HTML page, which is sent to the client.

Pylons generally gets HTML parameters to the controller by having them passed as parameters to the controller function (or ""action"" in Pylons speak), the reddit code base instead makes use of decorators to set method parameters. HTML parameters are passed along using the @validate decorator that you see above the GET functions in the controller. This sets the names of the HTML parameters to the function parameters usually using several decorator functions such as ""nop()"" and ""Validate()"" which I haven't figured out yet.

For instance, if I want to search, the following is called, http://www.reddit.com/search?q=hello&amp;count=50&amp;after=t3_fcf41 (search for ""hello"", list 50 results, and list them after the result titled ""t3_fcf41""). This tells Pylons to look at the routing map for something called search. Pylons finds the appropriate mapping:

     mc = map.connect
     mc('/reddits/search', controller='front', action='search_reddits')

and passes that along to the controller. Here, the controller being used is ""front"" and the function is ""search_reddits"". This tells Pylons to get the class ""[FrontController](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/controllers/front.py)"", instantiate a new object from it and call the function ""GET_search_reddits"". @validate then sets the parameters ""query=q=hello"", ""count=50"", ""after=t3_fcf41"", ""reverse="", ""num="". Several functions are then called to perform the search and render the page based on the search results. Pylons then takes the fully rendered page and sends it to the client. If you notice, several mappings have a colon before the name. This is a wildcard, which means that it is not mapped to a particular string and the controller can see that string and decide what to do with it. These are passed along to the controller as function parameters. For instance, a mapping that looks like this mc('/foo/:bar', controller='foo', action='baz') will call a function defined like so:

    def GET_baz(self, bar):
          return dostuff

The parameter ""bar"" is mapped to the next thing in the URL after 'foo/'.

All in all pretty simple. To review: The mapping of calls is stored in 'config/routing.py' in the form of ""call_name, controller, function"". The call name is everything past ""reddit.com"" in the URL, the controller is a class with the name ""FooController"" where ""foo"" is the name of the controller in the map, and ""function"" is the aliased name of the method to call in the controller class that has the form of ""GET_function(self, **params)"" where params are a series of variables including the generic request variables and the GET and POST parameters. The page is then created and sent to the client.

There has been some talk about implementing comment streams for Reddit.  Well, I've created a comment stream for developers.  I've put a lot of code together to make sure that all of the comments (that Reddit is willing to deliver) are collected, properly cached, sorted and then made available for the stream.

I cache the previous 2.5 million Reddit comments in memory and the previous 5 billion on disk.  

If you wish to test the stream out, it is available [here](http://dev.redditanalytics.com/search/stream/)  Please be advised that this stream is for applications to ingest json data (one JSON block per comment).  It will do you little good to load this with your browser unless you're simply curious or testing that the stream is active. 

Until I get more funding, I'm limited to 1 terabyte outgoing per month.  I'm working on securing 1 petabyte outgoing per month, but it's going to cost a bit of money.

Please let me know how the stream works for you!  

Thanks so much.

**Why should I use this stream?**

It will save on your API calls to Reddit and alleviate stress on Reddit's servers.

**How accurate is your data?**

My stream does not filter any comments.  The comments are formatted exactly as would be delivered from Reddit minus the wrapper.  Each JSON is delimited by a new line.  My ingest script has failover built in and is smart enough to know when there is an issue on Reddit's side.  If you see the comment on Reddit, there's a 99.9999% that it is in my stream.

**How current is your stream?**

Within 5 seconds at most.  If it falls further behind, it's Reddit's fault.  :)

**Does your stream get comment edits?**

No.  Comment edits are not available on Reddit's stream.  There is currently no known way to get comment edits while bound to the rules for Reddit's API usage.  The only way to know if a message was edited is after the fact -- when scraping the comment again at some future date and reading the ""edited"" key in the JSON response.  This key should always be false in my stream -- just as it would be when viewing http://www.reddit.com/comments.json 

**Where can I send suggestions?**

Send them to my PM on Reddit if you like.

**What is the location of this stream?**

http://dev.redditanalytics.com/search/stream/

**How many connections can I make?**

Please make only one.  There is no need to make more since you will get the same data from both.

Edit:  There is now additional logic to check if there is already an open stream for a given IP address.  If so, it will give an error.  

**How many global connections do you support?**

Hopefully enough until I get a more powerful server.  This server is very old.  :)

**You mean I could see just the comments come in real-time??**

Yep!  If you're using linux and have perl installed (most come pre-installed) and assuming you have installed JSON for Perl from CPAN (sudo cpan install JSON) ... you could use this command in bash  ... 

    wget -qO- ""http://dev.redditanalytics.com/search/stream/"" | perl -MJSON -ne 'print from_json($_)-&gt;{body}.""\n""'


**That's pretty cool, but what else could I do from the command line?**

Well, you could figure out which submissions are currently most active by piping in 1,000 comments to this command (it will take 1-2 minutes to collect all of the data)

    wget -qO- ""http://dev.redditanalytics.com/search/stream/"" | head -n 1000 | perl -MJSON -ne 'print from_json($_)-&gt;{link_title}.""\n""' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

**I found this really useful and would like to repay you in some way**

A Reddit Gold reward would always be helpful and contribute to helping me scrape comments for their score values!

** **UPDATE** **

AndrewNeo offered an awesome suggestion to help conserve bandwidth.  If you do not need the entire stream, you can filter by subreddit.  This is how you would stream comments only for askreddit:

http://dev.redditanalytics.com/search/stream/?subreddit=askreddit 

The subreddit name is not case sensitive.  

Also, if you plan on using this API for the future, plan on having to pass an API key at some point.  Traffic is going up a bit faster than expected.  I may have to implement API keys at some point.

** **COMING SOON** **

I am also going to put a *q* parameter so you can filter the stream by keywords and phrases.  You could use this to trigger a bot or send an e-mail to Wil Wheaton when his name comes through the stream *grin*

**Questions for you the user**

Would filtering by a specific submission help?
What about filtering by author name?
How can I make this better?

----

* Easy Mode: Use Ubuntu 12.04 Long Term Support

The [install script](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/install-reddit.sh) is Ubuntu 12.04 specific and *awesome*.  It apt-get-s dependencies, sets up the databases, and even gets the stack running.  **Highly recommended**.  

If you don't like Ubuntu Unity, you can ask Ubuntu to install LXDE, XFCE, KDE, etc.

----

* Fix the /etc/hosts file

One thing install-reddit.sh does NOT do is fix your hosts table.  Adding the following line to the /ect/hosts file can help your browser find the local reddit server:

    0.0.0.0                 reddit.local
Now you should be able to go to reddit.local in your browser, log in, and look around at...a very, very empty reddit clone.

----

* Where's the create reddit button?

By default, reddit hides the ""create reddit button"" to reduce the number of reddits created by clueless newbies. There are other ways around this, but one shortcut is to go directly to http://reddit.local/reddits/create .

----

* Tweaking the configuration:

There are some important files for tweaking your local reddit's settings.

/home/reddit/reddit/r2/example.ini  
**DON'T EDIT, JUST LOOK**  *This file lets you see all the default settings.*

/home/reddit/reddit/r2/run.ini  
*This is just a pointer--it defaults to pointing at development.ini*

/home/reddit/reddit/r2/development.update  
**NOTE: Change the *.update file, not the *.ini file**

Add the following line to /home/reddit/reddit/r2/development.update :

    short_description = I changed the description!

Then run:
    /home/reddit/reddit/r2$ sudo make

Reload http://reddit.local and boom, the title of the webpage has changed.

----

* Where's the off switch?

Turning the local server on and off can be done on the comand line:

    sudo initctl emit reddit-stop
    sudo initctl emit reddit-start
    sudo initctl emit reddit-restart

1322683665.0	mv40x	Hey reddit API developers, let's talk about CAPTCHAs.	chromakode	47	10	18	"Hey all,

I'm currently investigating our CAPTCHA implementation and ways to improve it (one thing we are considering is moving to reCAPTCHA, though it has some interesting limitations). CAPTCHAs are one place that have been difficult to work with in the current reddit API, so I'd like to take this opportunity to improve things. One of the first steps for that is opening a discussion with you. I'd like to ask 3 questions to get things started:

1. How do you currently handle reddit CAPTCHAs in your client?

2. If we make a change in the way we implement CAPTCHAs on the site, how much lead time do you need to support it in your client?

3. Is a CAPTCHA that requires opening a web page sufficient for your client, or do you need more granular access to CAPTCHA images?

Many of you run reddit bots that make posts to only a single account around the site. We'd like to eventually have an API key system where we can provide some exempt status to single-account registered apps.

Another important set of apps to consider are mobile. We understand that CAPTCHAs are a big nuisance to mobile users, though they are an important tool for registrations and unproven users. I'd love to hear your thoughts on question #3 and what would be ideal for you and your users."	t5_2qizd	True

1339629271.0	v0oa1	On reddit's new server code plugin system	chromakode	33	1	6	"As a few of you have already noticed, yesterday I pushed the code behind reddit's new new ""plugin system"" to GitHub. The purpose of these plugins is pretty nitty-gritty, so unless you're a reddit developer, you will probably never notice they're there.

The purpose of the new plugin system is to make it possible to extend reddit without adding to the core codebase. This originally came about when developing the new [about pages](/about), which add a lot of very reddit.com specific templates and static files, but aren't something you'd by default need on a different deployment.

In general, plugins can be used to:

 * add specific functionality to your reddit instance without changing the core
 * run experimental code before folding it into the main codebase
 * implement interchangeable functionality for a specific purpose (for instance, you could have alternate search plugins implementing Solr, IndexTank, or CloudSearch backends)
 * override specific static files or templates

On the practical side, plugins are separate python packages that you install alongside reddit. You can then enable them by adding them to the `plugins` line of your server `.ini` file. They also integrate with the main reddit `Makefile` to compile static files for production.

For a sample plugin, check out the [about pages codebase](https://github.com/reddit/reddit-plugin-about). The basic plugin definition is in [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/reddit/reddit-plugin-about/blob/master/reddit_about/__init__.py). I'll be working on releasing a skeleton plugin package in the future with more detailed information.

My hope is that having the option of writing plugins will help keep the reddit core simple while making it easier to try out and integrate small extensions to the site. If you have any questions or ideas please feel free to comment here or hit us up on IRC in #reddit-dev on FreeNode. :)

Here's the commits on GitHub behind the new plugin system:

1337166201.0	tps8u	Having trouble getting a dev instance of reddit up and running? Here's an updated reddit VM (as of 2012-05-15) and instructions I followed to make it.	ichthyos	37	7	16	"This is a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) box, like the one /u/kemitche [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/qnuxp/pycon_prepackaged_vm/) before.

Download it here: http://aquatica.mit.edu/~ichthyos/reddit-clean.box

MD5 = 9f986e9e4dfd5a8dde4d528515a99757

The code it's running is current as of May 15, 2012. It is running reddit on port 8000, forwards that port on your host machine to the same on your VM, and has test data from populatedb.

Download and install [VirtualBox 4.1.14](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to get this VM up and running:

    $ vagrant box add base reddit-clean.box
    $ vagrant init
    $ vagrant up

Add a line to your /etc/hosts file on your host machine to make reddit.local resolve to 127.0.0.1. This will make the links on your dev reddit work. Point your web browser to http://reddit.local:8000. Voila, you should see an empty reddit!

----

Just for future reference, here are the steps I took to make it.

Lines that look like this are run on my host machine:

    host$ command

Lines that look like this are run on the VM:

    vagrant$ command

First, download and install [VirtualBox 4.1.14](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).

Get a clean ubuntu image, tell Vagrant to forward port 8000, start your VM, and ssh to it.

    host$ vagrant box add base http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7490647/talifun-ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64.box
    host$ vagrant init
    host$ echo ""config.vm.forward_port 8000, 8000"" &gt;&gt; Vagrantfile
    host$ vagrant reload
    host$ vagrant up
    host$ vagrant ssh

Update Ubuntu packages.

    vagrant$ sudo apt-get update
    vagrant$ sudo apt-get upgrade

Update the VirtualBox Guest Additions on the VM so that they are compatible with your newer VirtualBox.

    vagrant$ sudo aptitude install dkms
    vagrant$ wget -c http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.1.14/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.1.14.iso
    vagrant$ sudo mount VBoxGuestAdditions_4.1.14.iso -o loop /mnt
    vagrant$ sudo sh /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Per [these instructions](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/reddit-install-script-for-Ubuntu), get [the latest version of the reddit install script for Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/922144) and run it. You'll probably need to change the URL in the first line.

    vagrant$ wget https://raw.github.com/gist/922144/20655c40920185a376a21cfd0975596547927c30/install-reddit.sh
    vagrant$ chmod +x install-reddit.sh
    vagrant$ sudo ./install-reddit.sh

Still following those instructions, populate your reddit with test data.

    vagrant$ cd ~reddit/reddit/r2/
    vagrant$ sudo -u reddit paster shell run.ini
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from r2.models import populatedb
    &gt;&gt;&gt; populatedb.populate()

**EDIT:** Oops, I included the commands I ran to get reddit running on the VM but not the one I ran to package it up at the end (including the port 8000 forwarding directive in the Vagrantfile config). Here it is:

    host$ vagrant package --output=reddit-clean.box --vagrantfile Vagrantfile

1303752033.0	gx3lg	A day in the life of hacking the code.	reseph	36	4	3	"Here's a little write-up of how I work through the reddit code to make a contribution to the source. My background is teaching myself C when I was a teen to develop a MUD, then 2 years of Computer Science (C++, Java, database stuff) and PHP/Python on the side as I worked on some side projects and now working at a local web business. Python is my least familiar language and I have no experience with Pylons/Cassandra, nor am I familiar with the reddit code. [Here's a blog post of my first contribution](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/11/thanks-hackers-in-both-senses-of-word.html) but I'm going over my [""mark nsfw"" contribution here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/pull/18).

The first thing I had to do was get the button in, otherwise I can't even test the code I'll be doing. So I did a grep for one of the buttons, in this case ""approve"". The first thing I got was **POST_approve** in api.py, which I figured was the actual code to handle approving the submission. I'd come to that later. Then a number of results appeared unrelated, so I narrowed it down by doing a grep for **\""approve\""** and sure enough I found data/templates/printablebuttons.html.py. A quick glance at it and it seems to be a ""compiled"" version, but grep also listed r2/templates/printablebuttons.html which looks to be the right place for buttons. A quick glance at the template code and it looks simple enough. I decide to use the yes/no confirmation button which report uses:

    %elif thing.show_report:
      &lt;li&gt;
        ${ynbutton(_(""report""), _(""reported""), ""report"", ""hide_thing"")}
      &lt;/li&gt;
    %endif

And I create this code based on the report code in the same file:


    %if thing.show_marknsfw:
      &lt;li&gt;${ynbutton(_(""mark NSFW""), _(""marked NSFW""), ""marknsfw"")}&lt;/li&gt;
    %endif

Along with the bool show_marknsfw, the last argument is clearly an identifier of some sort (since one of the buttons was ""hide_thing""), so I have to find where that is defined now and create marknsfw and unmarknsfw. Again I'll use grep to search for an existing identifier; I picked ""indict"". Oh and I used grep like this **find . -exec grep -l ""indict"" {} \;** I came across a number of strings and the sort (which is what I'm not looking for) and then found POST_indict in api.py and figured that must be it. An example of what I was looking over:

      @noresponse(VUser(),
                  VModhash(),
                  thing = VByNameIfAuthor('id'))
      def POST_del(self, thing):
          if not thing: return
          '''for deleting all sorts of things'''
          thing._deleted = True
          if (getattr(thing, ""promoted"", None) is not None and
              not promote.is_promoted(thing)):
              promote.reject_promotion(thing)
          thing._commit()

          # flag search indexer that something has changed
          changed(thing)

          #expire the item from the sr cache
          if isinstance(thing, Link):
              sr = thing.subreddit_slow
              expire_hot(sr)
              queries.delete_links(thing)

          #comments have special delete tasks
          elif isinstance(thing, Comment):
              thing._delete()
              delete_comment(thing)
              queries.new_comment(thing, None)

 I understood the Python in the code, but things like the noresponse() parts wasn't I knew offhand. Regardless I looked over a number of the functions and found that I needed to **thing._commit()** and **changed(thing)** (found in POST_del) when making a change.

Next up I needed to find how to mark something NSFW. (I spent a bit working on appending the title of the submission with ""(NSFW)"" into the database, but later removed that to append it in the template). So once again I did a grep for ""nsfw"" (case insensitive) and found a line like this **item.nsfw = item.over_18 and user.pref_label_nsfw**, so it looks like bool values in a struct or the sort (originally I ended up setting just item.nsfw to true and that didn't work). So back in **api.py**, I create this code basing it off the other functions in the file:

      @noresponse(VUser(),
                  VModhash(),
                  thing = VByName('id'))
      def POST_marknsfw(self, thing):
          thing.nsfw = True
          thing.over_18 = True
          thing._commit()

          # flag search indexer that something has changed
          changed(thing)

Next up is to figure out where to define show_marknsfw that defines when it'll show up. It looks like a ""method"" of thing that returns a bool.

Again, I used grep to look for show_report and found some assignments of it in **r2/lib/pages/things.py** and found that it's not so much a method, but a bool variable in the PrintableButtons class. There's a number of things done the file, such as initializing and determining the final value etc. Here are the changes I made:

    def __init__(self, style, thing,
....
    -            show_distinguish = False,
    +            show_distinguish = False, show_marknsfw = True,

...

                     show_distinguish = show_distinguish,
    +                show_marknsfw = show_marknsfw,

Basically following how the code is for similar vars. Next up is to set the actual bool to determine True/False. First was just simple logic to decide who could mark submissions NSFW. I picked mods, the submitter and admins. Did some looking around (like on the ""remove"" code that mods use) and came up with this code:

        if (c.user_is_admin or thing.can_ban or is_author) and not thing.nsfw:
            show_marknsfw = True
        else:
            show_marknsfw = False

Note: I also wrote code to unmark something NSFW, but didn't include it here because I didn't add the code until months later (just now).

I think that's it, unless I forgot anything. It took me a number of days going through this and testing it. Maybe an admin can give the technical details of exactly what is going on here (like noresponse) but I found most of it self explanatory. "	t5_2qizd	True

It's packaged up as a [""vagrant""](http://vagrantup.com) box, but you can also un-tar it to get to the VMDK disk and OVF file.

EDIT: /u/dakta has pointed out some obviously helpful and much needed info:

&gt; If the VM goes into ""Guru Meditation"", you've probably maxed out your available system memory. Go into the VM settings are tone it down until VirtualBox says it's OK.

&gt; If the VM doesn't boot after that, you need to enable PAE/NX under Settings&gt;System&gt;Processor.

&gt; Finally, I had to set the VM to open up with a GUI screen to let me select what Ubuntu shit to boot using grub.

&gt; For reference, since kemitche didn't say so, the default user is ""reddit"" passwd ""reddit""... I don't know how root is really set up, but sudo for ""reddit"" is the Vagrant default of passwordless, so if you really must change root password just sudo passwd root, although I don't suggest it.
&gt;
&gt; As expected, reddit is installed already and rearin' to go. Just point your host machine at localhost:8000 to get to the reddit install. SSH is forwarded on port 2222, so you can ssh reddit@localhost:2222 and connect through that instead.

In addition to manually tweaking the VM, if using vagrant, you can modify the VM with [config.vm.customize](http://vagrantup.com/docs/config/vm/customize.html) commands:

    config.vm.customize [""modifyvm"", :id, ""--memory"", ""1024""] # quotes around the number needed; RAM size in MB

**Introduction** 

Please criticize and correct!

Last time, we discussed Pylons and the MVC architecture and how the Pylons controllers directs the client to the proper web page. Now we will discuss the ""view"" portion of the MVC, how the web pages are displayed.

**Mako**

Pylons uses a library called [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) to generate HTML pages. If you are familiar with other server-side HTML renderers, like PHP and JSP, this should be very familiar to you. The basic structure involves writing a plain HTML page with special tags for Python variables and special PHP-like brackets for Python scripts. In Pylons, all of the templates are stored in the [/templates](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/tree/master/r2/r2/templates) directory.

Some basic Mako structures:

*Lines that start with a hash (#) are comments.    
*Lines that start with percentage (%) are Python code.    
*Python code can go anywhere between a &lt;% and a %&gt;.     
*Include statements are defined with the `&lt;%include file=""filename""&gt;` tag, where ""filename"" is the name of another template.     
*Functions can be defined with    
     &lt;%def name=""functionName(params)""&gt;
     function stuff    
     &lt;/%def&gt;    
*A function can then be called with `${functionName(params)}`     
*Variables can be defined with `${variableName}` and can be set in the Python code before the template is rendered (more on that later).

The basic method for rendering templates is the (drumroll...) `template.render()` call. Whenever this is called it returns a template rendered as plain HTML. The render function takes in the form of the variables set in the template. You set the variables by naming them explicitly in the function, i.e. `render(var1=""Hello"", var2=""world"")`. In general, the standard way to call the render function is to pass it as a string to the Templater constructor, like so:

     Template(""&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;${title}&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;${someText}  
    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"").render(title=""Hello Templates!"", someText=""Blah de blah"")

This outputs a  simple HTML page:

    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello Templates!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;Blah de blah&lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

All pretty straight forward.

**Pylons and Mako**

In Pylons, a ""render"" function is included in the controller files. This function works just like the standard Mako renderer, only the first parameter is the name of the template file (located in /templates, but that can be changed.) Another difference is the `tmpl_context` class, generally imported as ""c"". This allows a cleaner way to access the template variables. All the variables found in a template are members of ""c"". So in our example, we would do the following (assuming the template is named ""hello.html"":

      def GET_index(self):
             c.title = ""Hello Templates!""
             c.someText = ""Blah de blah""
             render('/hello.html')

**How reddit connects**

The reddit codebase has  a series of classes that inherit from the reddits own home brewed [Templated](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/wrapped.pyx). These are in the directory [/lib/pages](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/pages). The main file is pages.py. This contains the class Reddit which is a child class of Templated which is a parent class to most of the pages that reddit renders. These are the content renderer classes. If you look at the templates, such as the one for the [main page](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/templates/reddit.html) you don't see any content. All of the content is set by these content renderer classes. Most of what the class does is set a whole lot of variables and functions that will be used by the templates. 

A level of abstraction above are the [Wrapped](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/wrapped.pyx) classes. These are the classes that define most of the HTML.

Lets look at the reddit footer for an example, since it's static and all the information is self contained in two files. (The footer is the thing at the bottom with all those outside links, that nobody ever looks at). First there is the [template](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/templates/redditfooter.html). Look at this bit of code:

     %for toolbar in thing.nav:
          &lt;div class=""col""&gt;
             ${toolbar}
         &lt;/div&gt;
     %endfor

That's about 95% of the footer, right there. What it does is cycle through every item defined in thing.nav and prints it out. Looking back at the [renderer code](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/pages/pages.py) (look for RedditFooter) you see that it is made up of a whole bunch of smaller pieces, each of them HTML renderers in their own right. These smaller items are defined in [/lib/menus.py](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/menus.py). These are subclasses for the class [Styled](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/wrapped.pyx) which is a Templated type of class. When the footer render method is called, the template cycles through all of the Styled typed classes and calls the ""render()"" function on each one, shown here as `${toolbar}`.

You will have two options:

1. Revert your stuff to use the old ""lucene"" syntax
2. Continue using ""cloudsearch"" syntax, and add ""syntax=cloudsearch"" to your query params.

The nitty gritty is that I've thrown together a query parser/rewriter that will rewrite lucene queries into matching cloudsearch. This means that (a) there may be bugs if using lucene syntax, and (b) lucene queries may not have access to the full range of expressions allowed - for example because cloudsearch doesn't support it, or because the rewriter doesn't support it.

1326192669.0	oapba	Understanding the reddit DB	MDY	31	6	9	"So I've been trying to understand how reddit interacts with its many databases and was hoping some clever people could help confirm/correct my understanding.  To illustrate my understanding (or lack thereof) I'm going to construct an example of two users, Alice and Bob, reading a subreddit.

Bob is already reading the subreddit and is happily clicking on up/down voting buttons as he sees fit.  When he clicks on a voting arrow, some javascript is executed that changes the visibility of the up/down arrow and the dispaly with the number of votes for a link (a purely cosmetic change visible only to Bob) and ajax sends a POST request to the appropriate voting action of the API controller.  This bit of code then adds an entry to the rabbitmq link_vote queue, which says that Bob voted up/down/null on link l.

At some point, the link_vote_q process, which handles the link_vote queue, decides to do something with these votes.  It takes all the votes and updates the postgresql database to reflect this new information.

Meanwhile, Alice has decided she might like to look at the same page as Bob.  She sends a request to the appropriate GET method of the listing controller, which gets the appropriate mako template and renders it by fetching data from the postgresql database.  If rabbitmq has gotten around to commiting Bob's votes at this point she will see them, if not, she won't.

However, rendering each mako template by fetching data from the main db each time a user requests a page is time consuming.  This is where cassandra comes in.  Cassandra stores the rendered html for each page (or at least for the commonly accessed ones) and can give them to the user instead of rendering everything from the sql db.  This works great so long as nothing changes, but of course Bob is voting on things so the html in cassandra needs to be updated.  How does this happen?  I would guess that when link_process_q commits stuff to the sql db it also submits something to cassandra saying the pages that depend on this vote need updating as of ""current time"".  Then when Alice comes to view the page, cassandra knows the rendered html in its cache is too old and goes off to the mako template and the sql db and renders a fresh version.

But wait, there's more!  Even fetching stuff from cassandra is annoying, because it requires accessing the hard disc.  To minimize this, memcache keeps the most commonly accessed bits of html served by cassandra in memory, so they can accessed super quickly.

Sorry that was a bit long, but the reddit db system is a bit complicated so it kind of had to be.  If anyone could help out and tell me how far off I am, that would be great.

tl;dr Bob and Alice have a fun time on reddit."	t5_2qizd	True

 * If a submission had been banned by a non-moderator (admin / admin script / etc), the `banned_by` value is supposed to be `true`. Due to a bug in this code, `banned_by` would be set to `true` even when a submission was not banned.

These api properties have now been tweaked to be mutually exclusive. If a post is banned, `banned_by` will be set, and `approved_by` will be `null` (and vice-versa). In addition, `banned_by` will now only be non-null if the submission is actually banned.

1358245022.0	16m0uu	PRAW 2.0 is Coming (release in ~2 days)	bboe	25	1	4	"PRAW users,

I've been working on-and-off for the last few weeks (with significant help from /u/_Daimon_) on extending the initial OAuth2 support added to PRAW by /u/intortus. My original plan was for addition-only changes thus resulting in a backward-compatible 1.1 release. However, properly handling reddit's OAuth2 scopes necessitated a number of backwards incompatible namespace changes (which in turn prompted numerous other namespace changes) thus I am bumping the major version number.

To minimize the amount of code from breaking that has a PRAW dependency, I wanted to give everyone a little time to update their projects before I add PRAW 2.0 to the cheeseshop (pypi). If you have code that depends on PRAW and you don't want it to break for other users of your projects you have two primary options:

The first option is to simply update your `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` file to depend on any PRAW version less than 2.0 (1.0.16 will be the last 1.0 version). If your package installation does not automatically handle dependencies then you can inform your users to run `pip install praw==1.0.16` to get an appropriate version, or point them to [this source tarball](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/archive/praw-1.0.16.tar.gz) or [this source zipfile](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/archive/praw-1.0.16.zip).

The second option, of course, is to update your package to work with PRAW versions &gt;= 2.0. To help you get started you'll want to checkout the PRAW 2.0 [Change Log](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/wiki/Changelog). Until I actually release the package on pypi, you'll need to clone the github repository (`git clone git://github.com/praw-dev/praw.git`), or manually download the source ([zipfile](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/archive/master.zip)).

I'm happy to answer any questions you have as replies to this submission. Assuming no major issues are discovered, I will release PRAW 2.0 Wednesday evening (PST).

Edit: I should add that if you are interested in using PRAW via OAuth2, check out the [PRAW OAuth wiki page](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/wiki/OAuth)."	t5_2qizd	True

Each T3 object (a submission that was not spam) is represented as one line of JSON in a file.  Each file is an entire day's worth of submissions to Reddit and compressed using gzip.  

I will also include Python files to serve as an example of how to process each file.  You can take the information and put it into a database or a flat file or run your own analysis on the data.  I am working backwards from the present and will add approximately a month's worth of submissions each day.  Within a month or two, all Reddit submissions will be available in this archive.

Please use these archive files instead of using Reddit's API if you simply want submission data.  It will spare the Reddit servers a bit of load *and* you can get data far more quickly than making requests to the API every two seconds.

The URL for the archive is:  http://redditfiles.4shared.com

If you are familiar with JSON data, you should have no problem using this data for your projects.  

I am creating a search engine for Reddit that is (I hope) superior to what is currently available.  I'd love to work with anyone who is good at front-end development -- so please send me a message if you are interested.

&gt;&gt; [...] shift the friend-lookup into the client[.] Some javascript should be able to turn usernames red if they are in a list.

and ketralnis replied:

&gt;I'd recommend you take this discussion to /r/redditdev if you're really interested, but for this question, the client has to get the data from somewhere too, right?

My idea is, [similar to cdawzrd and AngerMCS](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dqse4/fun_in_the_sidebar/c127t8s), that the client should be able to  cache the data so that reddit only serves the friends-list once. 

One final speculation:
If reddit also serves the list of ""comment upvote ids"" and other stuff seperately, it should be able to serve ""flat comment pages"" to everybody. Then, the comment pages can be cached for a second on the server before reddit has to include the recent  upvotes and comments ""batch-style"" in a single pass.

This should be similar to the wiki architecture where most people just get a plain html file that only gets updated when somebody alters an article.

1368476670.0	1e9lwp	Proposal: robots.txt equivalent for reddit bots.	shaggorama	27	11	24	"There ought to be a subreddit-level flag (and perhaps a user-level flag) to instruct bots not to engage on that subreddit (or with that user). Obviously this would only be effective for those bots that respected such a flag, but I believe something like this could reduce the amount the moderators need to fight with bots. There seem to be a lot of subreddits that have a ""we see em, we ban em"" attitude towards reddit bots: why not just modify the ecosystem so the bots already get the message without evening needing the mods to ban them?

Here's how I imagine this being implemented: 

1. The option to set this flag needs to be made available in subreddit settings. I think this should default to ""bots are ok here.""

2. The main reddit API wrappers (e.g. praw) should be set to respect this flag by default. Overriding this flag should be easy, but this way people just messing around with bots as hobby projects (which I assume is most of the population of praw users) will respect the flag by default.

EDIT: Some great ideas in here, but I'm thinking such a feature would be more trouble than it's worth and probably actually cause more work for everyone (mods, bot creators, and app developers). There's nothing really wrong with the current system of just banning bots when mods find them.

Pardon the self-promotion, but I'd like to announce [GoReddit](https://github.com/kz26/GoReddit), a Golang Reddit client/library that I'm working on. Obviously it's in a very early stage of development, but right now it's capable of getting a listing of posts from a subreddit, getting a listing of comments, and voting. All API calls go through a custom HTTP client that respects the guideline of waiting 2 seconds between requests.

I'll be using GoReddit for a bot that I'm writing, but I'd also like the library to be useful to others interested in writing a bot in Go or something. With that said, what features do you find most important for a Reddit API client?"	t5_2qizd	True
1362613240.0	19t48f	Learning reddit's code, Journal #2: Admin status (one way or the other)	fool_blog	17	0	7	"This is continuation of http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/19saz0/learning_reddits_code_journal_1/. I'm posting as I learn--to help others and to get corrections when I ""learn"" the wrong things.

(Oh, and I switched from /u/foolblog to /u/fool_blog because ""fool_blog"" is easier to read and *^i ^kinda ^forgot ^the ^password, ^oopsie* .)

----

In Journal #1, I got a local reddit started and running on a Ubuntu 12.04 system. *Everything here assumes you're running Ubuntu 12.04.* 

Now, the quest for admin powers begins.

----

**Make Me Admin!**

By default, reddit has one admin ~~account~~ not-actually-an-account-yet. The first person to create an account named ""reddit"" is the admin.  Yikes! 

Let's change that.

Login to your local reddit.  Create two accounts.  I'm using ""fool"" and ""fool2"".

Open /home/reddit/reddit/r2/development.update in a text editor and add one line:

    admins = fool, fool2

Save the file. Open a command line terminal and:

    cd /home/reddit/reddit/r2
    sudo make

Boom!  Your two accounts are admin accounts.  ""reddit"" is no longer an admin.

However, there are still major problems--admin account have very limited powers until you verify email accounts, and I can't figure out how to get the local reddit to send out confirmation e-mails. 

That's okay. I'm gonna cheat on this one.

-----

**I'm gonna hack my database.**

**Disclaimer:** *There's a high chance that doing things this way is extremely naughty.  With any luck, somebody will post corrections.*

Reddit saves important stuff in a PostreSQL database.  

* Step 1: Set the postgres password. 

I used the instructions at http://library.linode.com/databases/postgresql/ubuntu-12.04-precise-pangolin#sph_set-the-postgres-user-s-password

* Step 2: Run the pgAdmin III GUI.

If you don't have it, get it:
    sudo apt-get install pgadmin3
Once you do have it, run it.

* Step 3: Add the local server.

1. Click on File -&gt; Add Server...

Fill in the blanks on the Properties tab:

&gt; Name: reddit [or something else, as long as it is not blank]

&gt; Host: localhost

&gt; (Port should be 5432 by default.)

&gt; (Maintence DB and Username should be ""postgres"" by default.)

&gt; Password: [Whatever password you used in Step 1.]

Now click OK to open the reddit database.

* Step 4: Commence database hacking:

In the object browser, open the tree: 

&gt;  reddit (localhost: 5432) 

&gt;  Databases(2)

&gt;  reddit

&gt;  Schemas

&gt;  public

&gt;  Tables

&gt;  reddit_data_account

Select reddit_data_account and press Ctrl-D to open the data in a new window.

Now find your admin accounts.  You're looking for a row like:

    3  |  name | fool | str

3 is the id number for the account with the name of ""fool"".  (This number may vary.  The important thing is that the 2nd column is ""name"" and the third column has the name of the admin account.)

I'm going to hack fool into having a verified email account.

I add the following rows to reddit_data_account.  I use ""3"" in column one because that's the account ID number for /u/fool .

    3 | email          | fake@fakefake.com | str
    3 | email_verified | t                 | bool

Fool2 needs email verfied too.  The row for fool2's name has ""4"" in the thing_id column, so I'll add two rows for him, too.

    4 | email          | fakest@fakefake.com | str
    4 | email_verified | t                   | bool

Now, since doing things this way is **probably very naughty**, I seem to have messed up reddit's cache system.  Alas, since I don't know how to fix that the easy way.  However, rebooting the computer forces the caches to update.  

One reboot sequence later and the hack is complete. The caches have been forced to refresh, and the local reddit is convinced that the email addresses were verified. I can use the admin accounts to do admin type stuff.

*And, yeah, this is the cue for people to tell me how clueless I am and how to do this sort of thing without a reboot.*

First things first. I am a noob at this but Deimos asked me to enquire here. Hope this helps! :) I think this post can go here, right?

###What is ChromaMarket?
So along with a few others, I am a mod at **/r/ChromaMarket**, which is a place where we do some **virtual currency stuff**. We buy/sell virtual goods and everybody starts with a set amount of money. However, recently, we have gotten around **30 active users** that frequently use the system and this is set to go up. Thus, we decided to find someone who could **help us with a bot**.

---

###About What We Need:
We need a bot that can **read modmails**, and complete transactions that take place via modmail. These transactions only include **buying and selling**. As such, the bot would need to **calculate the money** after the purchase/sale and enter that info into our **subreddit wiki page** if possible. For buying, the bot would need to **add** items to the list in the wiki page and for selling, the bot would need to **remove** items from the list.

---

###More Info:

- We would like this to be done **asap**
- Anyone who **can help**, please comment below

I've been urging myself to use the OAuth API and I love how it works. It's a lot more easy to just have a user press a button instead of making them enter their credentials on a third-party site.  
With that having said it has come to my attention that the OAuth API is really limited, It's in no way as good as the normal API.  
For example the front page (.json / hot.json) only gets the public frontpage.  
I can update a reddit's stylesheet but not get prevstylesheet (trough /about/stylesheet.json) which makes it impossible to update it at all.  
There's just tons and tons of other stuff like this which makes using it quite impossible.  
Coming back to the title, In order to try to get the users frontpage I now have to get all of their subreddits (2 requests, and then I'm still not sure if I got all of his subreddits) and then try something like /r/subreddit1+subreddit2+etc.json which costs a lot of - unnessary - server load for us both.  
There also have been a few project I just completely had to cancel because of these limitations.  
There's just so many things missing compared to the normal API and as much as I love the work you guys have done on it so far, I'm really urging you to continue working on it because it's unusable for me at the moment because of it's limitations.

A few people have asked for my help, when I posted in that thread a few days ago, so I figured there might be a demand for personalized help.

So, if you're friendly, willing to listen, and do, what I tell you (exercises) send me your email in a PM, after you post a comment in this thread, and I'll walk you through the basics of logging in, submitting a story, getting links from a subreddit, and deleting your posts, among other things.

Requirements:

* Python 2.x or 3.x
* Modules to use: `requests`, `json`, `pprint`, `time` or `datetime`
* Friendliness (I'm not going to waste time with dicks, looking to spam reddit or something)
* Basic Google-fu, ability to search Stack Overflow
* Willingness to listen to critique, should the need arise.

Bonus:

* Google Talk/Chat if there's ever an issue you can't solve on your own
* Creepy pics of forests. I just like looking at them.
* A subreddit you can 'spam' with test posts. I use my [/r/tankorsmash](/r/tankorsmash) for this. It only takes a minute to create a subreddit.


My motivation is that I'm going to write a generic tutorial for working with Python and the reddit API, and I'd like to get a feel for what people have trouble with. I only expect a few people to respond to this, I can't handle more than that! ;)

Then, they finish paying, PayPal sends us an IPN with their email address, and we mail them a claim code that they have to enter in at [/thanks](/thanks) while logged in to reddit.

It's an annoying step that confuses people and leads to the vast majority of our customer support requests.

What I'd prefer to do is this: when a logged-in user goes to pay for gold, send them off to PayPal with their username stored in a hidden (or overt) parameter. Then, when they pay, the IPN notification has their username and we can simply credit their reddit account, rather than having to send them an email with a claim code.

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/o0pk5/monopoly_is_an_old_game/.json

I am able to see the first 50 parent comments. At the end of the JSON Array for these comments, there is another item labeled ""more"" which has an id of ""c3dibkp"". 

So according to the API, I should be able to fetch more comments by accessing:

http://reddit.com/comments/FULLNAME/c3dibkp.json

I'm guessing that FULLNAME should be equal to the id of the original story, which is ""o0pk5"".

However I cannot seem to get the correct results using:
http://reddit.com/comments/o0pk5/c3dibkp.json

What am I doing wrong?

1323324187.0	n4i9b	Question about Reddit's Thing-&gt;Data database design	streetc0de	14	2	5	"I was watching this video: [http://thinkvitamin.com/code/steve-huffman-on-lessons-learned-at-reddit/](http://thinkvitamin.com/code/steve-huffman-on-lessons-learned-at-reddit/) and at 9:40 (about Lesson 3) Steve talks about how data is stored in a non-relational way.  This ideology really intrigued me as it seems like the perfect way to eliminate schema changes.  But I do have some questions about it hopefully someone more experienced than I can answer:

1.  He says there are no more joins using this design. Does he mean that completely? Wouldn't it make sense to join the Things table to the Data table on ThingID?

2.  I related this to objects in my mind where the Things table could be renamed the Objects table and the Data table holds all the object's fields/members/attributes.  Also, to make searches faster, you would need to index the Type column in Things, but indexing varchars is inefficient so you could instead index TypeID (integer) to improve performance.  This would require a 3rd table to map TypeID to it's text name.  This table could be called Classes, so our structure would go Class-&gt;Object-&gt;Data.  My question is, is that a more efficient way of doing this, and is it OK or a bad idea to join these three tables in each query, where you say need to select all objects of class User (for example)?

3.  Obviously since this structure uses only 2 (or 3 if I make my Classes table) tables these tables (and their indices) are going to get monstrous.  What performance issues are there with tables so big? I'm pretty sure there is a max table size (even if it's the OS's maximum file size) so how do you split these up? When they do get split up, how do you determine what goes where (obviously it's up to the developer but what is the most optimal solution)?  And when things are split up across different boxes, how do you know where to look later?

4.  Is MySQL a suitable platform for this type of database? If so, what database engine would be most efficient?

I'm sorry for such wordy questions, I'm still turning the concept over in my mind.  It seems like such a simple solution to a complex problem but I worry about its limitations.  Million thanks to whoever helps shed some light on this."	t5_2qizd	True
1285892093.0	dl9e2	Thoughts: How can we best approach handling comments in the 1000s? 		17	3	42	"I believe normally, the max is 500 comments to load at a time and for Gold members it is 1000 comments to load at a time. Then you could hit load more comments the bottom of the page. 

Navigating comment threads that are this large can be difficult from a user-interface stand point as well as far as server load. With a 1000 comments, it can take several minutes to load a page. For a self-post, like for IAMA posts, it can be extremely difficult to manage, especially just going through the inbox. 

So I wanted to hear your thoughts if there are steps we could take, either from an interface standpoint or loading time, that we could try to alleviate the concern. 

I believe as Reddit gets more traffic, these popular posts could easily hit the 10,000 mark. 

Maybe we could make an outside application, like a control panel, to aid the management of self.posts for the OP? Maybe we just need some CSS or a greasemonkey script from the user-side? Or maybe we need to edit some code? What about a new sort-method for comments (like with Best, New, Controversial, Top)? I don't really have any bright ideas at the moment. 


Edit: We might need to make some visual examples with some perf-testing to show how some of our ideas could work. Don't want to re-invent the wheel.

Is it done at the query level or mostly done by the application?

For example, just looking at the most visible stuff:

1. Per user, get the subreddits?
2. Per user, get the top links per the user selected subreddits
3. Have the ticker bar populate with the top links per the subreddits
4. Have the user selected last view links
5. Highlight the friends
6. Show the user's karma

---

/by_id will now only 404 if all links were not found. I noticed some users pointing out our inconsistent and counter intuitive behavior of /by_id. /by_id is an endpoint to get links by ID. However, if given an invalid link ID, the entire result would be a 404, even if some of the IDs were valid...giving no indication of which IDs were invalid. HOWEVER, if given an invalid id with a invalid prefix (eg ""/by_id/t3_1iy9ku,tomatosoup"") the endpoint would not 404 and would be very happy to just give you the valid items. This behavior was inconsistent and made it difficult to deal with having invalid ids. The new behavior is to only 404 if all of the ids were not found.

I've a bit of experience with Elasticsearch, and I'm curious how the core Reddit devs would suggest I go about implementing integration. I would love to be able to contribute Elasticsearch support as a plugin, but it is clear that there's a little bit of work that would need to be done before Reddit could support alternatives to CloudSearch. 

Would it be acceptable for me to submit a pull-request that would make the search handling more modular and ""pluginified""? That would allow me to package Elasticsearch support as plugin, as well as allow others to provide their own plugins for their preferred search index system. 

I've spent a bit of time looking at this problem, and believe that it shouldn't be too complicated to abstract Reddit from CloudSearch, allowing for any indexing system to be dropped in place. I guess I just want to make sure that, should I do this, it would stand a good chance of being found useful by the Reddit core devs.

1365762108.0	1c75dh	Lesson 1: How to get submission data from Reddit's API	aphexcoil	16	5	12	"Hey guys!  I am going to put together a series of lessons for developers.  I will progress through the process of getting JSON data from Reddit's API, building a MySQL database and importing the Reddit data into a database.  With these lessons, you will be able to create a fully functional database using Reddit's API for your projects.

I've just started coding in Python (I was previously a PERL programmer).  If you see any errors in the code, please let me know.  

I hope these tutorials will help aspiring developers create awesome applications for other Redditors.  

Today's lesson is a simple one.  We will create a very basic Python script to retrieve Reddit submission data using the JSON format.  

Let's dive in!  For these lessons, I will assume you are using a linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)  If you are running windows, I would recommend that you download Virtualbox (Free Oracle product) and install Ubuntu under Virtualbox.  Virtualbox is a nice virtual machine which allows you to run a complete OS under your existing OS.  

You can learn more about Virtualbox and download it from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

You can download the install files (*both 32 and 64 bit versions*) for Ubuntu [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

**Once you have Ubuntu installed, you can install MySQL (if it is not already installed) by using these commands:**

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

**You can install phpmyadmin for Ubuntu and MySQL using this command:**

    sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

The following code is very simplistic.  It authenticates with Reddit's server and makes requests for submission data.  Each request will return up to 100 submissions.  It is important that you change the setting in your Reddit profile to receive 100 listings per request.  The other alternative is to pass a URL variable with your GET request using the limit variable.  In this script, I have hard-coded the limit to the maximum of 100. 

This is a very basic script with virtually no error control, so you may want to add additional error handling routines in your project.

**Here is the code for the Python script:**

    #!/usr/bin/python
    #
    # Script Name: getRedditJSONSubmissionData.py
    # Usage: ./getRedditJSONSubmissionData.py &gt; redditData.json
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # This script will average one request every two seconds.  If the servers return data faster, you might
    # need to change the sleep time to avoid going over the API limits.  
    # Also, make sure you change the settings in your Reddit account to get 100 objects at a time.  You can
    # also use the URL variable ""limit=100"" (it might be count=100?)
    #
    # Also, the code to handle errors if a non-status 200 response is received should be improved to 
    # eventually stop requesting after X amount of failures -- this might happen if Reddit's servers go down
    # for an extended time period.
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    import requests
    import json
    import time
    import sys

    user_pass_dict = {'user': 'your_user_name',
                  'passwd': 'your_password',
                  'api_type': 'json'}
    s = requests.Session()
    s.headers.update({'User-Agent' : 'short_description_of_yourself user:your_user_name'})
    r = s.post(r'http://www.reddit.com/api/login', data=user_pass_dict)
    j = json.loads(r.content)
    after = """" # Set this to a T3 object to start at a specific point or leave blank to start with the most recent submissions

    while True:
        time.sleep(1) # Sleep for one second to avoid going over API limits
        url = ""http://www.reddit.com/r/all/new/.json?limit=100&amp;after="" + after
        html = s.get(url) # Make request to Reddit API
        if html.status_code != 200:  # This error handing is extremely basic.  Please improve.
            # Error handing block

The previous sort/filter defauts didn't make sense for the Subreddit instance functions `get_new`, `get_controversial` and `get_top`, thus I've made it such that these generic functions use either the reddit or account default for non-logged in and logged in users respectively. As part of the change I've added explicit functions for each of the possible listings. Those are:

* get_controversial_from_all
* get_controversial_from_day
* get_controversial_from_hour
* get_controversial_from_month
* get_controversial_from_week
* get_controversial_from_year
* get_new_by_date (this already existed)
* get_new_by_rising
* get_top_from_all
* get_top_from_day
* get_top_from_hour
* get_top_from_month
* get_top_from_week
* get_top_from_year

I recommend you use one of the explicit listings in your code. If you want to dynamically handle a filter the best way is to do something like:

    subreddit.get_top(url_data={'t': top})

where `top` is one of `all`, `day`, `hour`, `month`, `week`, or `year`.

I believe reddit data would be an excellent data set for such an engine -- where things like upvotes, and the reputation of a commenter, and the amount of further discussion a comment inspires, etc. could all influence ranking.

To test this, I'd love to crawl (or suck through an API) quite a bit of reddit articles and comments.

Is there a recommended friendly way to do this?


If it matters, the search engine's F/OSS based (lucene extensions), and we'd have no problem releasing them - as well as any reddit-specific stuff on top of them - as open source.

I'm not saying smaller subreddits deserve to have more subscribers, but I think there needs to be a new method built into Reddit to allow that to happen, like a recommendation system, since the current method isn't working as well as it should. 


There are a couple of ways for people to find out about new reddits currently:

1. Post in /r/newreddits
2. Allow the reddit to be shown in the default set
3. search via /Reddits
4. Same links that can be shown to have been placed in different reddits
5. Links from generous mods in the subreddit description like so ----&gt;
6. Post topics in similar reddits and link off
7. Paid (sometimes free) Advertise on the site
8. [Randomit](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/75183)

Some subreddits that are active, make good posts often, and can get an active following with good word of mouth, can expand greatly as far as subscribers. 

But for instance, KeyserSosa or Raldi said on [DrillDown](http://thedrilldown.com/2010/09/02/the-drill-down-151-surfing-with-the-aliens/) that they just heard of /r/zombies this past week, a community of ~8,500 for 2 years. There are about ~100 subreddits with over 10,000 subscribers and thousands of subreddits with less than 100 subscribers. 

Most have less than 100 for many reasons like not being active, no content, unusual topic, etc. This isn't about that, but about how to develop and spur activity more uniformly across smaller subreddits. 

Sites like [metareddit](http://metareddit.com/) or [subredditfinder](http://subredditfinder.com/) can help in their own way, but are not close to being efficient. 

Tags will not work and the Reddit Admins despise it with a passion. 

I was thinking of add a recommend button to /reddits to show reddits that you may like based off of the reddits you currently subscribe to and posts you may like. 

The issues I can see is not just creating an algorithm to analyze and recommend subreddits, but to reduce the server load to perform such an analysis as well. 

What do you developers think about creating that kind of system for reddit and taking on this massive project?

Or is this something better left for the Reddit Admins to decide once they have the resources to do so? 

Can you guys think of some other solutions?

Thanks for your input! I certainly would like to see more than 0.56% of /r/programming subscribed to /r/redditdev.

1366882240.0	1d2nr4	Multiprocess PRAW -- testing needed	bboe	11	1	1	"Hey everyone,

I spent a little time over the last few days refactoring how PRAW actually handles requests including how PRAW performs both rate limiting and caching. The new approach is modular allowing you to more easily change PRAW's request handling behavior by providing your own handler class, or utilizing a non-default handler provided by PRAW.

One such handler I wrote is a multiprocess handler that interfaces with a request-handler server that is now included in PRAW. Before I push this code out with version 2.1.0 it would be awesome if some of the regular PRAW users could test the multiprocess handler with your programs.

The primary benefit of the multiprocess handler is you no longer have to worry about rate limiting when running multiple versions of your PRAW programs.

To get started, fetch PRAW from github. While using git is recommended, here's a [zip](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/archive/master.zip) of the latest source. Installing PRAW this way requires you to run `python setup.py install` from the root of the source tree (where setup.py lives).

Once up and running give this script a try: https://gist.github.com/bboe/5458377

At this point you'll probably notice warnings like:

    Cannot connect to multiprocess server. Is it running? Retrying in 2 seconds.

From a separate terminal, start PRAW's multiprocess request handling server by running `praw-multiprocess`. From here you should be able to run as many PRAW instances you want so long as you pass in an instance of the `MultiprocessHandler` when creating the Reddit instance.

What I'm looking for is any issues you encounter. I've handled most of the obvious connection issues on my ubuntu OS, but perhaps the socket error messages are different on other OSes, or I completely neglected to test something. That's where you can help!

At the moment the only unresolved issue that I am aware of is when the request times out, the server fails to pickle the resulting TimeOut object. This in turn will cause an EOFError on the client that it already handles. However, after 3 consecutive EOFErrors PRAW will raise a ClientException.

Any feedback you have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"	t5_2qizd	True

1366303575.0	1cm5as	Advanced Reddit API Project -- Some questions for you guys.	aphexcoil	11	0	7	"I've downloaded and archived around 65 million Reddit submissions.  I still have a few hundred million more to go before I have a fairly complete archive of submissions.  

A few of you have mentioned that it would be great if I created an API that you can make calls to and download data in bulk.  I am working on creating such an API right now and will have something available in the next week or so.

Here is my question -- I need a reliable dedicated server to handle the load.  I would like to get something with the following specifications (or something close):

8 gigs of memory (or 16 gigs if cheap enough)
128 gigabytes of SSD storage
1 terabyte of regular HD storage
Quad-core CPU (second or third generation Intel Core)
1,000 Mbps unmetered bandwidth (with option to go to 10Gpbs unmetered)
Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit server edition

The most important thing for this project is having a large enough pipe to handle the bandwidth requirements.  I want to at least guarantee 500 kilobytes a second downloads for the API.  

Q1)  What company would you recommend for getting a dedicated server with specifications similar to what I mentioned above?

Here is what the API will initially offer:

* Ability to make requests and have data returned in JSON format.  (XML and Google Bit Protocol will eventually be supported)
* Ability to request submissions by date range and subreddits.  
* Ability to return 1,000 submissions per API call.
* Allow 5 API requests per second.
* 1,000 API call limit per day for unregistered developers.
* 10,000 API call limit per day for registered developers.
* 100,000 API calls per day for partner developers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example API call:

To retrieve 100 submissions for the subreddit ""askreddit"" between two dates:

http://api.redditdata.com/submissions?subreddit=askreddit&amp;startdate=[unix timestamp]&amp;enddate=[unix timestamp]&amp;limit=100&amp;format=json

To retrieve 100 top level comments for a particular thread in the subreddit ""askreddit""

http://api.redditdata.com/comments?subreddit=askreddit&amp;id=z8492&amp;limit=100&amp;level=1&amp;format=json

To retrieve all Reddit submissions for April 18, 2013 for the subreddit ""askreddit""

http://api.redditdata.com/submissions?subreddit=askreddit&amp;date=20130418&amp;limit=0

To retrieve all Reddit submissions for the subreddit ""askreddit"" with a minimum score of at least 500 for the above date:

http://api.redditdata.com/submissions?subreddit=askreddit&amp;date=20130418&amp;limit=0&amp;minscore=500




**Here are the API fields that I am going to support:**

**limit** (specify the maximum number of returned objects)

**subreddit** (specify a particular subreddit or an array of subreddits)

**minscore** (specify the minimum score of a particular submission)

**mincomments** (specify the minimum number of comments)

**startdate** (the oldest date possible for objects)

**enddate** (the newest date possible for objects)

**date** (return objects with this exact date)

**author** (return objects submitted / commented by this particular author)

**q** (return objects that have this keyword or array of keywords using boolean logic -- AND, OR , etc.)

**domain** (return objects pertaining to a certain domain)

**over18** (return objects that are over18 only, both or none)

**id** (return objects with this id or an array of ids)

1360201367.0	181cu9	A couple of questions	elAhmo	11	1	1	"Hey guys, 

I hope that you are able to help me with this.

1. During the creation of the new subreddit, is it possible to change the default value of thumbnails to the link, and make it ticked? So that way, when creating a new subreddit, it will have thumbnails shown by default for all users.

2. Is it possible to set default users from the admin interface? I am aware of the settings in the ini file, and I am wondering is that the only place or an admin can change it somewhere on the site.

3. Is it possible to delete the subreddit? Like, completely delete it and everything it contains? Or, can someone explain what the banning actually does, what happenes with the mods, users who are subscribed, top menu bar, search indices and so on, does the banned subreddit leave trails or its deteled-like, but not completely?

4. Somehow, my clone is not detecting new search submissions, so the data has to be pushed manualy to CloudSearch to Amazon. (via paster run r2/lib/cloudsearch.py -c ""rebuild_subreddit_index()"" and rebuild_link_index(). I've added a cron job for this, but this might pose issues later when (if) the sites become bigger, so can you suggest some potential solutions why the process_new_links() is not working (its not working when running directly via paster run, so its not the consumers issue)

1357244604.0	15wmo2	Suggestion/Brainstorm: Premium API Access at Cost	bobbonew	15	2	7	"After reading /u/dakta's comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/15v7l4/retrieving_a_users_comments_seems_to_be_limited/c7q7lcy), it sounded like a decent revenue model for Reddit by allowing further limits on API calls for a cost.

Thinking about it from a service kind of level, what is currently being offered now is the free tier, while allowing for a ""pay for what you use as you use it"" type of model that AWS currently has.

Possible options could be:

- Rate limit bypass - allow the application to bypass current rate limits when the application has the need to. Price it at something like $0.001 (numbers completely made up) per rate limit bypass.

- Comments returned limit bypass (allow 2000 comments to be retrieved at a time instead of 1000).

There are a multitude of ways you could do this, perhaps even by *just* offering the rate limit bypass while keeping the other parameters the same (ex: you can't bypass the 1000 comments returned, but you can request 5000/sec and be charged rate limit charges).

**Please Note:** This is just a brainstorm of possibilities, and I do know it would take quite a bit to implement something like this. But from the dedicated Reddit community (especially the programming community) I'd like to think that some users *would* pay premium for something like this."	t5_2qizd	True

On ELI5, we have one flair option. Users can mark their question as ""answered.""

Basically, the bot would have one task. When a post *that hasn't been given flair* received 25 comments, the bot would PM the OP and say:

&gt;Your post on /r/explainlikeimfive, ""[NAME OF POST],"" has received many responses. If you feel that your question has been adequately answered, click [here](link to reply to bot with a specific code) and hit ""reply"" to mark it as answered or do it manually.

* alert users when their post that hasn't been marked as answered hits 20 comments through a PM

* link them to the post

* allow them to click a link that does it for them

Of course, we could add the bot account as a mod.

1359576451.0	17kwf1	Adding an email notification feature. Best way to proceed?	inflecto	12	1	5	"I am working on modifications to Reddit to support email notifications. I'm doing this primarily for a clone of the Reddit source we're evaluating for part of a larger system. I find that implementing a significant feature is the best way to learn the nuts and bolts of an architecture. 

I also would like to contribute something back to the community as part of our process, if possible.

So I'm not too worried about doing the feature, as I'm comfortable with complex systems and Reddit seems fairly approachable. I'm more concerned with wasting my time on a feature that won't end up being accepted for other reasons. If I know there is no chance the feature would be accepted, I'd code it differently than I might if it would likely be accepted, as there are likely Reddit-community requirements that greatly exceed ours for reasons of performance, scalability and dealing with what is likely to be a much higher flow of potential notifications for most people. For instance, people might want the option for a daily digest email on Reddit.com while on our future system, they'd likely just take the full feed all the time.

Since this is a feature that seems likely to have been considered many times before, and not implemented yet, I want to make sure I understand the reasons why this hasn't yet been done.

So I'd like to find out more about the informal or formal process for proposing, implementing, and then getting new features accepted into the main code line.

In this particular case, there are likely to be considerable cost from an operations perspective for the feature. It is also likely that people within Reddit have looked at this feature and decided it wasn't worth the tradeoff in benefits versus operational costs and time required to implement the feature.

So:

1) Does anyone know why email notifications specifically have not yet been implemented by the full-time programming staff? A search didn't turn up any discussion.

2) What are the operational parameters which enter into any equations about whether or not a feature like this would get accepted into the main code line?

3) How does one obtain architectural approval for a design ahead of implementing a feature like this? Is there a defined process? Who makes these sorts of decisions?

4) Email notification seems likely to increase the outbound email volume by several orders of magnitude. What is the specific email infrastructure I should target for sending email? It seems likely that this would change for just this feature alone as the only use of email I currently see is for confirmation of email addresses.

I'm trying to pull the first 500 posts of a subreddit in its JSON format in one call so as to limit the number of calls I send to reddit. I can append .json to the url and get the first 25 posts, but when I try to set the limit to ?limit=500 (which is supposedly the max), it will only return the first 100 posts. Since I figured this is built in, I tried to use ?count in conjunction with ?limit=100 to start at the 100th post and collect the posts from 100-200, and then repeat this for 200-300, etc, but this does not work and defaults me to the top 100 posts.

Here is my code:

    def datascrape(subreddit):
        import urllib2

        temp = open(str(""tempfile.txt""), 'w')

        url.append(""http://www.reddit.com/r/"" + subreddit + ""/.json?count=400&amp;limit=100"")

        pos = 0

        while pos &lt; 4:
            req = urllib2.Request(url[pos], None, {'user-agent':'MrFanzyPanz_Data_Test'})
            opener = urllib2.build_opener()

            pos += 1

        temp.close()

        return

The ""subreddit"" variable is currently set to ""pics"".  The API's time limitations make it really problematic to call entries individually or by lists, so I'm trying to avoid the API. Is there any way to extend the limit to 500, or to use ?count and ?limit together in order to retrieve blocks of 100 posts?

I guess I just want my /u/moderator-bot to be able to come back up and help moderating.


Edit: 

I am told that it might be an https issue.  I switched to http auth and all is fine.

1341113171.0	vv4tg	Python Reddit API Wrapper package rename and repository move	bboe	12	4	2	"Three things:

With /u/mellort's support, I have moved what was previously [mellort/reddit_api](https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api) to [praw-dev/praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) on github. /u/mellort has made a clone from the new location, so that existing links to the repository are not broken.

Additionally I've official updated the name to __PRAW__ which is an acronym for ""Python Reddit API Wrapper"". The primary impetus for the name change was to resolve the confusion I see from many people regarding what to call the package. I admit it was very confusing that the repository was called `reddit_api` and the package was called `reddit`. Hopefully it should be clear what name to use now: PRAW.

Finally, to clearly distinguish the python package from reddit's own source, I have renamed the package from `reddit` to `praw` and restarted PRAWs version number at 1.0.

Aside from the readthedocs documentation, all the documentation (on github) should be updated to reflect the change.

Making the switch is pretty simple, here are the steps:

0. Install the `praw` package (instructions on github)

0. Replace `import reddit` with `import praw` in your code and of course update any `reddit.NAME` references with `praw.NAME` such as `reddit.Reddit` with `praw.Reddit`.

0. If you had a user-level, or script level `reddit_api.cfg` file, please replace that with `praw.ini`. There is more information [here](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/wiki/The-Configuration-Files).

1338534420.0	ufauq	a working example in C# - CleanModQueue is a Windows Forms app that uses System.Net.Htttp.HttpClient to tickle reddit's API.	AyeMatey	15	4	7	"http://cleanmodqueue.codeplex.com/

Source available. 


I wrote a little tool to do moderation of reddits for me. The tool or the code may be  interesting to other devs or moderators.

The basics:

- It's built on .NET 4.0, therefore runs on Windows only. Uses Windows Forms.

- It is graphical - not a headless script.

- works by periodically querying reddit for the contents of your aggregated modqueue, then applying rules to items in the queue. It can also monitor other more specific queues. 

- the rule flavors are: if the post is from a ""known bad"" domain, spam it.  If the post is from a ""known bad"" author, spam it. If the post is from a mod of the reddit, approve it.  If the post has N upvotes, approve it.  If the post is from a ""known good"" domain or user, approve it. 

- You can set the list of known bad domains and known bad authors.  Likewise known good domains and users. You can set the re-check interval, and the upvote threshold. You can set the relative priority of these constraints.  In other words, you can tell it to first delete known bad domains, then approve known good users, or vice versa. 

- It also presents a UI where you can tick checkboxes to explicitly specify  actions to take on particular items.

- Uses the ReadAsAsync&lt;T&gt; that is part of HttpClient to de-serialize JSON responses into C# classes.

- The reddit interaction is all wrapped up in a C# class called ""Reddit.Client"".  It exposes methods like Login, IsLoggedIn, Logout, GetModQueue, GetNewQueue, RemovePost, ApprovePost, ReportUserAsSpammer, GetUserRecentPosts, IsUserDead (shadow-banned), and so on.  This may be useful for other .NET developers.

1304908349.0	h70v1	How much extra load would this put on Reddit, and would it be worthwhile?	Sam_Mack	20	11	17	"Basic outcome: When viewing all the comments on a submission, the colour of the comment reflects that user's response to the submission. If they upvote, their comment has a faint green background; if they downvote, it's faint orange. No vote lodged, no alterations to the colour of the comment's background.

Possible implementation: I'm not an expert on the Reddit code, so this might be totally retarded - just based on my guesswork at how the existing system works. Requires no database modification but does require a few queries that probably aren't there - esp if caching upvotes and downvotes.

When loading a comments page...

    $submissionUpvotes = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM votes WHERE submission = '$currentSubmission' AND voteType = 'upvote'"");
    while($row = mysql_fetch_array($submissionUpvotes)) {
    	$arrayUpvotes[] = $row['userID'];	
    }
        
    $submissionDownvotes = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM votes WHERE submission = '$currentSubmission' AND voteType = 'downvote'"");

    	$arrayDownvotes[] = $row['userID'];	
    }
    
    $submissionPoints = count($arrayUpvotes) - count($arrayDownvotes);
        
    // here's all the other stuff to output submission points, image thumb, etc etc etc
        
    // when looping through comments:

        echo ""class = 'upvoted'"";
    }
    
    if (in_array($commentSubmitter, $arrayDownvotes)) {
        echo ""class = 'downvoted'"";
    }

There are a number of subreddits that do this, and it has become a huge hassle for big subreddits now...  Yes, we've made that hassle ourselves by starting to offer this when traffic was lower... not complaining in that regard...

However, two key concerns:

1) It's a cumbersome process to add people's crests, and I'm trying to come up with a solve (via UserJS) to at least simplify the process for moderators...

2) Subreddits using the a.author[href=/username]:before method are often running out of space.  The alternative is to use shorter declarations that involve the user's reddit-ID (found in their about.json) such as: .id-t2_[userid]:after  Problem with that is once you put it in you never know who the heck it is/was if you need to do some editing...

It would be great if there were a way (maybe there is one already?) to look up a username if you know their userid... So, mine is 2539s ... can I query a URL somewhere and get back 'honestbleeps' from that?

If so, I'd build a tool for managing crests in a more efficient way...

Also, a feature request for the API would be to add awards to /user/{username}/about.json. Or at the very least, is_gold to tell if a user is a current gold subscriber.

If I could easily tell if a user is a gold subscriber I can give them full[er] features while limiting normal users to less resource intensive methods.

Which is fine and dandy.

But sometimes, when the exact same running code during the exact same session
submits a post, I get this:

    ""{""jquery"": [[0, 1, ""call"", [""body""]], [1, 2, ""attr"", ""find""], [2, 3,

    ""attr"", ""redirect""], [12, 13, ""call"",

Note: My post request has the following:

     extension =&gt; json

     then =&gt; tb
     title =&gt; title

Now I would rather not have the Jquery bullshit wrapping the post result, but I
can deal with it if needed.

However it's really annoying to get inconsistent results.  Sure I can work my
way around it, but what's the problem here?

I'm an interface designer and while I've been practicing my hand at js development, I feel a little out of my depth at times.

I have the basic site up. Currently you can view stories from any subreddit and switch subreddits. Here is a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/ACyWq.png

It's slow going but I intend to stick to it. There is a lot of work to be done, comments page, ability to login and post, for example. It would be fantastic to have a js developer to work with on this project.

I don't believe a reddit client for a browser is pointless. It's always nice to give the user a choice. I created a reddit ""app"" for the Chrome webstore, which was basically a redirect to reddit.com. It was the first reddit app on the webstore and as such, it generated quite a few thousand installs. Unfortunately, this past week it was taken down. I can resubmit the app, but only if it does more than redirect a user. I figure this is a great time to release a reddit client, because we have a guaranteed userbase there. As soon as the app is resubmitted, it will update automatically for all users.

DuaneBailey	10	1	4	"A while ago, I had whipped up a small greasemonkey script to fulfill the role of [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) for my reddit needs. Among many other issues with Microsoft's fine operating system, there's no easy way to type in en-dashes and em-dashes—their solution is to fake it in their products by substituting instances of `--` surrounded by words with em-dashes. As you might imagine, this is kind of irritating as the em-dash is an incredibly common form of punctuation. SmartyPants also adds many other features, including TeX-like quotation marks, (c) and (r) symbol replacement, proper ellipsis support, etc. And there are really no downsides! It was *designed* to be integrated in with markdown.

I found myself with a dearth of  projects to do and I was bored, so I thought about giving back to the community by integrating some form of SmartyPants's functionality into reddit's markdown implementation. When I looked at the source, however, I discovered that there was already support there, but reddit had [intentionally disabled it](http://code.reddit.com/browser/r2/r2/lib/c/reddit-discount-wrapper.c#L70)! (*gasp here*.)

This isn't really a complaint so much as my wondering why you disabled it. I can't imagine that it's considered intrusive, like images or HTML, or that it's a safety concern, like the `SAFELINK` flag. Are you guys planning on releasing the individual features (like the superscript feature that is in SmartyPants!) as gold features slowly? seeing `&amp;emdash;` littered throughout my normally beautiful comments makes me a little sad.

This reddit was running fine on a VM on a provider but about a week ago I transferred the entire installation (code + db) to another VM running on a different provider.

Ever since I did the move I've started to get random reddit crashes (about once every 12 hours) and seem to be caused when people add links.  What happens is that a row for the link is created in the reddit_thing_link table but an incomplete or no row is created in the reddit_data_link table.  As a consequence, the link has no sr_id and I get a hard crash with no further pages served until I manually delete the rows.

I am pretty sure this is a problem with my configuration as this installation has run fine for over 9 months on the first provider.

I have vacuumed the database but the only discernible differences in the configuration are that my original VM was running a 64-bit Ubuntu (postgres version 8.4.4) while the new one is running a 32-bit Ubuntu (postgres version 8.4.5).

pointers at where the changes might be made to make this happen (I've tracked it
as fare as r2.models.account.Account.friends, but I can't find where
Account.friend_ids() is defined)

Anyway, here's the idea

Where the current comment tagline contains something like

    &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/ketralnis"" class=""author submitter id-t2_nn0q friend""&gt;ketralnis&lt;/a&gt;

and reddit.css contains 
    .tagline .friend   { color:orangered }

Whether or not `friend` ends up in the class is AFAICT related to a test in
 r2.models.builder.wrap_items line 128, this test would be entirely removed if
 this proposal or something like it were implemented.


The idea is to take advantage of CSS caching in browsers. That is, supply a custom
CSS file per user (in a manner which can be invalidated to force a recache) e.g.
from reddit.com/bjartr.css?&lt;some sort of uniquifier&gt; which would contain e.g

    .tagline .id-t2_nn0q { color:orangered }
    .tagline .&lt;another friend's id&gt; { color:orangered }

and so on.

I still have to research where the CSS generation routine would be appropriate
and how to do it in such a way that fits the style of the rest of reddit's code.

The reason to use CSS directly instead of JS to achevie this is to leverage the
rendering engine of the client's browser which will be faster than using JS to
modify a page and force subsequent re-renderings.

Worst case is a browser doesn't cache CSS at all (rare AFAIK) and the CSS file
is served from a reddit side cache (flag on account says whether or not friends
list has changed since it was last generated) and so the actual list of friends
would only ever be queried on first visit or when the friends list changes or
they view their friends list in their preferences. Even if the CSS file is reserved 
in its entirety every time it only causes two queries (one to see if it 
needs to be regenerated and one to get the CSS text) which would mean for
a logged in user with zero friends that is in the quite unusual position of having 
browser which does not cache CSS there may be an extra query compared to
that same user in the current system. I do not believe this is problematic due to
the rarity of such a browser configuration.

1276899622.0	cgkig	We are building a team of developers and testers for Radio Reddit mobile apps. Inquire within.	HarryMuffin	12	3	13	"Yesterday came the great news of the [Reddit iphone app going open source](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/06/weve-open-sourced-ireddit.html).  That being the case, we fellow redditors over at [Radio Reddit](http://www.radioreddit.com) wanted to jump on the opportunity to use this to build a Radio Reddit app for the iphone, as well as a foundation for other mobile environments.  

A general concept is as follows:

On RadioReddit.com, users that are artists or are parts of bands upload their music into our site with all relevant information going into our database.  We then have playlists generated automatically based on genre and [schedule](http://www.radioreddit.com/schedule) of said genre.  Users can see what song is playing at the moment on the website and vote it up or down.  An example of the outcome can be seen at [/r/radioreddit](/r/radioreddit).  

We are thinking that we can adapt the code to incorporate a stream of Radio Reddit and information of what is currently playing while allowing for voting in real time. Our site and database also holds tags, all id3 info, etc so maybe something unique can be done there(thank you [octatone](http://www.reddit.com/user/octatone) and [johncub](http://www.reddit.com/user/johncub), you are awesome). As we also offer [podcasts](http://www.radioreddit.com/podcasts) of every show, we think this might be worth incorporating as well.

If you are interested in joining in the fun, you can find us in our [chat room](http://www.radioreddit.com/chat) or on irc at irc.makethemusic.org in #radioreddit-dev and #radioreddit.

1274316975.0	c64hb	While trying to use the reddit VM I had a problem with  networking not working. Here's how I solved it.	mindspider	10	0	2	"Commands such as sudo aptitude update wouldn't work. I'd get an error like ""Temporarily cannot resolve [urlhere]"". After trying ifconfig eth0 and getting nothing. I finally tried eth1 just to be sure. eth1 was working,  I changed etc/network/interfaces so that everything with eth0 now said eth1 and then rebooted the machine. Everything worked flawlessly after that.

    eth1

    cd etc

    cd network
For some reason, it wouldn't let me use cd if I tried cd'ing through more than one directory in one command.
    sudo nano interfaces

(All eth0 to eth1)

    ctrl + X

    y

At this point I just forced the VM to close. You probably shouldn't do it like that. I just like to live dangerously.

EDIT:  The most efficient approach that I can come up with in the event that an error 404 is returned when requesting a batch of 100 id's is ""divide and conquer.""  That means splicing the original request array of ID's in half and making a new request for those ID's.  Then continue to split the array until the bad ID is the only one left in a request.  The performance for such a situation is probably O(log N) if there is one bad ID out of 100.

* CSS
* Subreddit images
* Flair templates
* Settings
* Sidebar

And then you can later restore this is something nasty happens. You can also create backups of subreddits you don't moderate, if that's your kind of thing.

Additionally, you can use this tool to produce pre-packaged subreddit themes, like /r/edurne, and distribute them to other moderators, who can then easily apply those themes to their subreddits.

To compliment these changes, I also added the ability to specify the username/password of a moderator from the command line arguments when you run it, in case you want to put it in cronjob or something similar. See the readme for details.

With corresponding definitions for `#a`, `#b`, `#c`, just 3 base sprites could be composed into 6 combinations, instead of needing 6 different precomposed sprites. (If the layer ordering matters, then 3 permuted sprites would enable up to 9 distinct effects.)

The flexibility and relative efficiency would be even greater with more sprites or more background layers.

1359163692.0	17aiml	[PRAW] Getting newest posts to show up as quickly as  possible	IcyRespawn	9	0	6	"Hi guys,

I've just started using PRAW today and I'm absolutely loving it.

I did run into some issues while writing a bot. It's supposed to check a specific subreddit for the newest posts, read their contents and alert me whenever it finds something that matches a certain regular expression within them.

I'm checking for new submissions every 10 seconds, by calling s.get_new_by_date(limit=5) on my subreddit's Subreddit object. The problem is that after the initial call, new posts are usually only fetched after anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes AFTER they were created, where I expect them to show up within a maximal amount of 10 seconds from the moment they were created. They do appear when I refresh the page in my browser.

Things I tried doing to resolve this:

- My user agent follows the API guidelines and isn't generic.
- Setting my local praw.ini file so that cache_timeout=5 to ensure I'm not reading from the cache.
- Calling s.refresh() on my Subreddit object after every sleep(10).

Do you guys have any idea what might be causing this to happen? Is it because pages are cached server-side, and so I cannot force a refresh on the user's side? If so, why do pages usually take more than a minute (which is far more than the forced 30-second limitation if there is in fact one) to be detected by my algorithm?

I have noticed there is some remnants of adding this functionality in older commits in the Snudown repository, but it's been removed for whatever reason. Is it worth discussing how we might do this?

The simplest solution would be to include a client-side JS highlighter in this repo. in the Snudown repo, the changes will be very minimal involving the inclusion of a class directive in the &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;code&gt; blocks

(At askscience we want all ~2000 or so panelists to be able to edit the wiki, but not have general users edited it.)

First, I have tried doing it through the API, but couldn't figure out how to do it to add as wikicontributor to a subreddit not to tied to specific wiki page and was getting 403 errors.  Details on my API attempt at the bottom.

Next, I tried doing this through client-side javascript.  Go to the add wiki contributors page manually, logged in as myself, populate an array of users to add (which we maintain in a spreadsheet) and then use the following to add the users (with a delay of adding 1 user every 2 seconds originally; and 5 seconds on my second attempt).  (Yes jQuery could do this more concisely, but basically this just types the name into each form and then simulates a click of the button with a delay of two seconds - using an IIFE and setTimeout).

    for(i=0; i&lt; users.length; i++) {
    setTimeout(
       (function(user) {
           return function() {
              var a = document.getElementById('name');
              a.value = user;
              var b = document.getElementsByClassName('btn')[0];
              var event = document.createEvent('UIEvents');
              event.initUIEvent('click', true, true, window, 1);
              b.dispatchEvent(event);
          }
       })(users[i]), 80000*i);
    }

However, after I added about ~80 contributors last night (at a rate of 1 every 2seconds), I got SUBREDDIT_RATELIMIT error message.  So this morning I tried again, and was able to get another ~80 or so in before the same error message popped up.  This time adding at a rate of 1 every ~~5 seconds~~, ~~10 seconds~~, ~~30 seconds~~, *80 seconds is fine, as is everything over 72 seconds*,

Is there any published limits to avoid this SUBREDDIT_RATELIMIT?  I really want to add ~2000 or so users.

1346886540.0	zf378	Possible API patch: Batch GET command by_id?	MrFanzyPanz	9	0	4	"Hello, Dev!

I'm an intern for CenSoC (The Center for the Study of Choice) at the University of Technology, Sydney. We are currently doing a project involving various structures that implement ""Follow the Leader"" type dynamics. We look to see if the choices that people make are dependent on the influence of ""leaders"" in their community, and try to analyze why this is/is not an attribute of the community.

We would like to do some simple data mining through the Reddit API, since Reddit is already effectually a simple choice experiment (upvotes/downvotes). We were planning on collecting content and user data to see how they influence each other, however, we hit a snag:

If we try to request user info one at a time, with a 2 second delay between each, the time taken to collect all of the data would be overdrawn. We have been considering restructuring the data mining approach, but we also wanted to know if a patch would be simple enough to allow GET requests by_id. Something of this nature:
    


in the file which implements GET username about API:    

    /r2/r2/controllers/listingcontroller.py, line ~679

to go from something like this:
    

    def GET_about(self, vuser):

        ...

        return Reddit(content = Wrapped(vuser)).render()

        ...

to something like the following, where the username(s) url portion is split using regex (much like in the 'by_id' api code):

    reddit.com/user/userA,userB,userC/about.json

... and then looped on the server-side appending to the returned http response without having to re-initiate the http request/response every time:

    def GET_about(self, usernames):

        ...    
        splitter = re.compile('[ ,]+')    
        return Reddit(content = [Wrapped(x) for x in in splitter.split(usernames)]).render()    
        ...
    

obviously, the correct Python-syntax and various variable-validation in reddit arch. will be necessary, but the logic of the above, albeit incorrect Python-syntax-wise, remains.

I could host the URL myself, but first I need a way to get a machine readable list of **all** subreddits. I could grab them from http://www.reddit.com/reddits, but that only returns them 25 at a time, and includes a whole lot of extra data besides the name (which is all I need), so it's a bit impractical, especially to keep the list up-to-date.

UPDATE: I'm running a perl script to scrape http://www.reddit.com/reddits.json, but you can only get 25 results per request. It's been running for over 15 minutes now, and 15,600 reddits. I might be able to run it as a cron job, but probably no more than once a day. I guess the list doesn't need to be up-to-the-minute. I'll publish a link to the list in case anyone else needs it, to save reddit from being scraped by too many robots.

UPDATE2: OK, got it working eventually, thanks to ketralnis. I was able to get the data from /api/search_reddit_names.json, but it wasn't directly compatible with Opera search suggestions because a) It requires POSTed params and b) the JSON object wasn't quite in the correct format.

2)  What all does the `make` do?  It looks like it is compiling the python to c for optimization?  How do I ensure that this is the optimized/compiled code being used?  It appears that the uwsgi server that was configured by the install script uses the same run.ini as my development paster server (which I can tell uses the regular .py files).  

3)  Will reddit have problems running in a sub-directory on the apache2/mod_wsgi server?  Will any of the internal links, etc. break?

4)  Does anyone have any tips for running php and wsgi on the same apache server?  The closest I could find was [this](http://serverfault.com/questions/226449/how-can-django-wsgi-and-php-share-on-apache).

1. How often do session cookies / modhashes expire?  Could I login once (or once an hour/day/week/month) and then continue to use the same modhash/cookie?  Looking at the python source the session cookie doesn't appear to ever expire (the check of the cookie `datetime+user+sha(datetime+user+secret)` reads datetime+user from the cookie and then compares to the secret).  However, the modhash for CSRF protection seems to just be a placeholder in the reddit source.

2. I plan on giving mods a few browser buttons that will combine a couple separate requests into a single action; e.g., mod presses a button that uses the API to 'post a (brief) comment', 'send a (brief) message', and 'change user's flair'.  Should I wait 2 seconds between the three separate requests or can I send request 1, wait for response 1; then send request 2, wait for response 2; then send request 3, wait for response 3)?  I expect these actions to happen rarely after testing finishes, less than 20 times a day (60 total requests daily) -- nowhere near the limit of 60 reqs/minute.  So, I'd prefer not to have to wait 4+ seconds to finish the combined requests, so they can get quicker feedback of success/failure.

1.3.0dev is not available via pip, thus you'll need to manually fetch it from [github](https://github.com/bboe/reddit_api/tree/python3). Going forward PRAW will depend on the `six` module which can be obtained via `pip install six`. To make sure you are running the correct version you can run:

I've been trying to understand how reddit renders the comments tree and was hoping someone could help me out.  What I'm specifically trying to do is to have a comment not be displayed when a flag is set.  This isn't for any specific purpose, I'm just trying to understand the code at this point.  I'm not familiar with pylons/mako (although I know the basics), but am pretty experienced with using python.

The best i've been able to do so far is a crude hack of the template comment_skeleton.html, where I define blocks as empty if the flag is set.  When I've tried digging deeper into how things are done, I end up tumbling down the rabbit hole of inherited classes without much insight.  For example, I tried following the simple route from the /c/COMMENT_ID to the comment_by_id action of the front controller.  If you follow it far enough, you end up at the _render function of Templated class, which I think probably calls something else to do the rendering depending on the context.  In principal, the right way to implement my if flag, no print action would be to change the python code rather than the template (at least I think it is), but I'm utterly lost as to how to do it.

1292206403.0	ekrig	Logging in via POSTs to /api/login causes account lockout?	pjakubo86	8	0	12	"Hi all,

To start with, I'm very new to using the Reddit API so I apologize for my  naiveté. I'm currently writing an app which allows the user to log in. I'm doing a POST to http://www.reddit.com/api/login/&lt;username&gt; with the following as the request body:

op=login-main&amp;user=&lt;username&gt;&amp;passwd=&lt;password&gt;&amp;id=%23login_login-main&amp;r=redditdev&amp;renderstyle=html

I believe I copied that string out of the regular login requests that I was sniffing. Admittedly, I have little idea what most of those params mean (op, id, renderstyle).

In any case, these logins are generally successful for around 10 times. After that, it seems that my account is basically locked out of reddit. In other words, I can't log in via my app or via reddit.com. The only way out of this seems to be to reset my password on reddit and log in again. Even then, after the inital reset of the password, I'm still unabel to log in to reddit again.

Any idea what I might be doing wrong? I've looked around /redditdev and the API docs, but I haven't found anything. I did find a post from a while ago complaining about a similar problem when using the iPhone app, but there was no resolution to the problem in the thread.

Thanks for your help!

**EDIT**: Just got a raging clue from this code:

    if login_throttle(username, wrong_password = form.has_errors(""passwd"",
                                                     errors.WRONG_PASSWORD)):
            VRatelimit.ratelimit(rate_ip = True, prefix = 'login_', seconds=1)

            c.errors.add(errors.WRONG_PASSWORD, field = ""passwd"")

1376349543.0	1k8ocm	Is there any way to easily host a reddit bot using praw on Google App Engine?	pipsqueaker117	8	2	7	"I wrote a simple bot for reddit which needs to run every ten minutes or so to adequately perform its job. As I didnt want to leave my computer turned on forever in order to let the script I decided to try hosting it on google app engine.

Now I'm a newb to both app engine and praw, so bear with me here.

When I uploaded my script to the app engine it threw me an error saying that it could not find/import any packages named ""praw."" That's fine. To fix this, and all the later dependency errors that came up, I just ran the following commands in a python shell

    import dependencypackage
    print(dependencypackage)
    
I then copied all the files/folders that the shell spit out into my app's src directory. By doing this a few times I managed to trade one error for another, but now I'm running into the following error:

        Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""/base/data/home/apps/s~reddit-spelunky-bot/1.369458891331523467/SpelunkyDailyBot.py"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;

        from praw import decorators, errors
    ImportError: cannot import name decorators

I'm stumped by this one, because when I check the praw folder in my app's src dir there exist both a decorators.py and a decorators.pyc. 

So the question here is twofold-

1) What am I doing wrong here? Is the decorators module not supported by App Engine or something? Can I even use praw in a GAE script? I'd really love to get this bot on the cloud, so this question is the main one

2) Is there any easier way to do this? I feel like the process I've followed to get all the dependencies in the src is one of the least efficient possible. Is there some sort of tool I can use, some sort of magic button I can use in my IDE (pycharm or pydev for eclipse) which will take care of uploading all these dependencies for me?

Answers and explanations are welcome (duh)

Looking forward to your answers!

1360703448.0	18eeep	Resolved issues porting to PRAW 2	Bornhuetter	8	3	2	"I recently ported moderatorbot to PRAW 2, and had a couple of issues.  bboe was helpful as always, and I thought I'd reproduce here what I did to get my code working, in case others can learn from this.

**Issue 1 - my_moderation**

In PRAW 1.x the way to get a list of subreddits that the logged in user moderates, you use:

    For subreddit in r.user.my_moderation():

In PRAW 2.x the correct way is now:

    For subreddit in r.get_my_moderator():

(and don't forget the () after r.get_my_moderator as I initially did)

**Issue 2 - _request**

In PRAW 1.x, I used the following to make HTTP requests

    response = r._request(url, params)

In PRAW 2.x params has been changed to data, and the following needs to be used.

    response = r._request(url, data=data)

In this particular case I was trying to make an HTTP request to remove a comment.  bboe recommended that I use 

    r.request_json(url, data=data)

&gt; *you should use r.request_json as you can't count on r._request to always be around.*

In this case that will work (even though I am not actually trying to get json data).  In other cases I believe that I still need to use _request.  I believe that some pages do not return a json properly (or the json does not have all the data I need), but the result of _request can be parsed using beatifulsoup.  I don't have any code currently in production that uses beautifulsoup on _request, so I can't remember the exact situations I used it for.

So, I'd like to ask bboe to consider putting some sort of _request functionality into supported ""user space"""	t5_2qizd	True

The reason I'm asking is because I want to derive the full name for a submitted link so that I can comment later, and the response I get back from a submitted link with the API is a bunch of Jquery arrays that contain mostly useless info.  The one useful thing it does contain is a url to the comments for the newly created link.  I can scrape the ID out of the comments URL, and if I can just attach ""t3_"" to the id then I'm all set.

Once the bot is working again, I will pay responders if they are helpful.  The more helpful, the larger the tip.

1. What is the best way to get comments from a large group of users?  My bot scans its users' comments for a command.  Right now it goes through the list of users and gets the contents of ""http://www.reddit.com/user/$username/comments.json"" for each user.  With reddit's limit of 2 requests/sec, 5,000 users might take 3 hours to go through even if none of them use the command.  

 Is there a better way?



2.  When someone does a tip like ""+bitcointip $1"", the bot doesn't know who the tip is to, so it has to look at the ""parent_id"" of that comment, then get all the comments in the entire post, and then search the array of comments for the ""author"" of the comment with the same ""name"" as the original comment's ""parent_id"".  This is fine for posts with a small number of comments, but in posts with a large number of comments ""http://www.reddit.com/comments/$link_id.json"" does not return all of the comments.

 Is there a better way to get the ""author"" of a known ""parent_id""?

1295307188.0	f435o	Setting Up a New Development VM (follow-up to Updating the VM)	vogon_poem_lover	7	1	3	"**TL;DR** – Setup new Reddit dev VM. Summary of steps: Used VMWare to create Ubuntu 10.04.1 VM, installed g++, and *BeautifulSoup-3.0.8.1*. Modified and ran [install-reddit.sh](https://gist.github.com/738525) script. Updated *run.ini*. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a follow up to my [post submitted this past weekend](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/f36q5/updating_the_vm/) on trying to setup and update the published Reddit development VM. Basically, that was a flop as the published VM is out of date and updating it was simply getting too painful. Instead, I focused on setting up a new VM image for myself based on the latest Ubuntu ISO (10.04.1). Note: this VM was setup using VMWare with the same default user (“reddit”) and password (“password”) as the publicly distributed VM.

What follows is (relatively) detailed but streamlined description of the steps taken to get the environment up to a nominal running state. There were many false steps and unnecessary side-tracks taken to get this to work. I'm fairly sure that I've captured the minimum steps necessary, but of course, let me know if anything is missing or if you would like more information about some of the missteps/issues.

1) Logged in as “reddit” initially then set password for “root” (I'm lazy and hate having to always type sudo in front of everything and then having to type the password repeatedly). Remaining steps were performed as “root”.

2) Installed SSH server and then logged in as “root” from putty instead (prefer accessing VM using putty rather than the VMware console).
	apt-get install openssh-server

3) Installed g++
    apt-get install g++

4) Downloaded BeautifulSoup  3.0.8.1 from [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/). Then install was performed using the following commands:
    cd /home/reddit
    wget http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.0.8.1.tar.gz
    tar -xzf BeautifulSoup.tar.gz
    cd BeautifulSoup-3.0.8.1/
    python setup.py install

5) Edited the */etc/hosts* file to add the following line:
    127.0.0.1       reddit.local reddit pay.localhost cslowe.local
	
6) Downloaded [install-reddit.sh](https://gist.github.com/738525) to */home/reddit* and modified it to retrieve the 0.6.9 version of cassandra
    cd /home/reddit
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    wget https://gist.github.com/gists/738525/download
    tar -xzf download
    cd gist738525-26f2a656ecf1417376210e2d172a918e53491d97
    sed -e ""s/unstable/06x/g"" install-reddit.sh &gt; /home/reddit/install-reddit.sh
    cd /home/reddit
    rm -rfd tmp
    chmod 755 install-reddit.sh
    ./install-reddit.sh

7) Go get some coffee, go to lunch, do some real work, surf Reddit, etc.

8) Edited the *run.ini* file to change the *use_query_cache* setting to *True* (Reddit app fails to start otherwise) and other settings to get it start and run nominally.
    cd /home/reddit/reddit/r2
    rm run.ini
    sed -e ""s/use_query_cache = False/use_query_cache = True/g"" -e ""s/domain = localhost/domain = reddit.local/g"" -e ""s/media_domain = localhost/media_domain = reddit.local/g"" -e ""s/\*:hc/\*:hc:hc/g"" example.ini &gt; development.ini
    vi development.ini
(Add the following line after after [DEFAULT])
    INDEXTANK_API_URL =
(save file and exit vi)
    ln -s development.ini run.ini

9) Reset ownership of all files to “reddit” under the */home/reddit* home folder
    cd /home/reddit
    chown -R reddit:reddit *

10) Secured the root user (removed password) and rebooted the VM.

At this point the VM is running and is externally accessible. There are no sub-reddits defined, so I'm still working on how to post content, but I was able to register and log in, so that much is working. I'm currently researching how to load some test data to get going. If anyone has any insight on this it would be greatly appreciated.

Special thanks to [spladug](http://www.reddit.com/user/spladug) for his assistance and pointing out the [install-reddit.sh](https://gist.github.com/738525) script.

Lastly, I can't say I appreciate the Reddit servers being started by way of svscan in a development environment. Since I had many issues getting it to work, having it automatically started (and restarted) became a pain since the only way I found of killing it was to reboot or switch to single-user mode. I've therefor removed the *reddit-app01* and *reddit-app02* links from the */etc/service* folder. Perhaps once things are more stable these links will be restored.

EDIT: formatting

**EDIT:** Not sure how I missed this originally, but I noticed yesterday that the Cassandra service wasn't starting automatically. I found it necessary to modify the ""*/home/reddit/reddit/srv/cassandra/run*"" script to get it to work. In my environment the executable for Cassandra 0.6.9 was found in the ""*/usr/sbin/*"" where the *run* script was trying to locate it in the ""*/usr/local/cassandra/bin*"" folder which doesn't exist. A simple change to the script results in Cassandra starting up normally (commented out the ""cd"" line and removed the ""*bin/*"" prefix from *exec* line)."	t5_2qizd	True

I'm fairly new to Linux (Ubuntu 9.10), Python and Pylons, so I'm not sure what caused this problem. But I found a work around so thought I'd post it.

I am following the Ubuntu instructions [http://code.reddit.com/wiki/RedditStartToFinishIntrepid](found here.)

The following line keeps crashing out because it can't find BeautifulSoup

    sudo python setup.py develop 

I solved the problem by adding the correct download path.

    sudo python setup.py develop --find-links http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/

Not sure where the out of date download path is stored.

Edit: 

I then encountered another problem

I solved this by installing libxslt1-dev (no idea why this was needed. Perhaps this was installed by default on the version of Ubuntu the instructions where tested on.

    sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev

Edit 2:
Now have a problem with awards , which probably did not exist when the instructions where written. I've tried solving it with

I have tried to [get permission to release this script before](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1jzxqn/looking_for_permission_to_release_a_certain/) but the response was (probably?) negative, although I can only see that on the upvotes and reddit gold that the only commenter got who told me it would be too heavy on the servers. Well, I was aware of that and that is why I had asked for permission in the first place : )

I have now taken measures to make this script much less resource hungry. The script was aimed to help my moderation tasks, and as such I have now improved this script in two ways:

- The script is now limited to only work in subreddits that the logged in user moderates. I.e. it is now also only useful to someone who *is* a moderator.
- It now uses the jQuery inView plugin to only load about.json for such usernames that are currently in the viewport. The delay of 2100ms between requests to about.json remains.

So what do you say now, redditdevs?

EDIT: I have now incorporated a cache in localStorage for this script and removed the ability to show karma. The script only shows user age now.

I know this may be a silly question. I know reddit cache almost everything. There is a div containing user information on top right of reddit's page. It has a id of ""header-bottom-right"". My question is, if the page I get from reddit is cached, say, when I log in, how does reddit know what is my username? There are so MANY MANY reddit users, how does reddit cache
pages among which only user information are different but main content of these pages are the same? Or does reddit only cache content data and render page on every request? Or is that rendered by javascript? I know I can read the source code of reddit to find out how it works, but reddit's source code is way too complicated to me to read....

2. I am converting from an ID of the form ""t1_cag5h2j"" to one of the form ""cag5h2j"" by flushing the first three characters down
the toilet, which seems a scary way to convert from type A to type B.

Any ideas?



**Edit: Solved.**

I added a function to the PHP SDK:

    /**
    * Get saved posts
    *
    * Get the listing of a user's saved posts 
    * @param string $username The username.
    */
    public function getSaved($username){
        return $this-&gt;runCurl(""http://www.reddit.com/user/"".$username.""/saved.json"");
    }

Usage:

    require_once('reddit-sdk.php');
    $reddit = new reddit(username, password);
    $saved = $reddit-&gt;getSaved(username);
    print_r($saved);

The Python library cssutils, which is used by lib/cssfilter.py for the bulk of the validation work, seems to support RGBA colors, as well as numerous other features that are duplicated in the reddit code. For example, see this same list of color names in the Reddit code at [2] and in the library at [3].

I note that lib/cssfilter.py has had only a handful of substantive changes in the last year, while cssutils acquired these features in the last few months. I believe the current version of the library has made most of lib/cssfilter.py obsolete.

Reddit's setup.py does specify an older version of the library that does not contain the features I mentioned, but I'm not sure it's necessary. The version was pinned three years ago [4] due to ""API breakage"". In my judgment, using a newer version of the library is worth it for the gigantic code deduplication and more-correct CSS validation.

Is this a project worth pursuing, or am I missing something?

1335651351.0	sxcig	Extending Reddit: Adding more fields to text link submission?	RedditSrc4Research	7	0	8	"To skip background/motivation go to the next section ;)

------------------------------------------------

I am working on a website for an annual graduate research conference that would like to make some of their internal paper reviews public, so that the review process is more transparent to the research community.  Hopefully this will help even the playing field for researchers who are not intimate with the review process, lead to better quality paper submissions, and foster productive discussion, perhaps even innovation, regarding the process itself.

I initially thought of the reddit source engine for this purpose, but decided to go another route because of its excessive features (both user interface -- ads, gold, search, etc., and back-end enterprise design -- memcached, cassandra, etc.).  It simply had too many features and was too complicated for our needs.  I ended up prototyping a quick site from scratch using pyramid, which worked pretty well.  Unfortunately I have now been asked to add a lot more features such as comment sorting, moderation, voting, etc.  This has prompted me take a second look at the reddit source to see how hard it would be to adapt to our needs.

So I spent this morning getting the latest version of the source up and running on a Xen Ubuntu 11.04 VM, then proceeded to dig in to how to modify it for our needs.  The [ubuntu install script](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/reddit-install-script-for-Ubuntu) worked great (after I finally found it, heh), other than some problems with Cassandra crashing unexpectedly (mostly due to VM issues, but it took forever to debug :/).  I managed to figure out (mostly) how to hide / disable stuff we don't need through css / templates, but I'm having a bit harder timing adding additional features we need (since that involves, you know, real coding...).  I as a bit disappointed that I couldn't find any high level descriptions of or tutorials for hacking the actual code.  I guess I should go look at the pylons layout specifically?  Is it  fairly close to a normal pylons project?

Notably I am just a lowly graduate student who was notified this had to be done ""urgently"" with less than a weeks notice for the intended rollout :/.  Obviously that's not going to happen at this point, but any expedited input would be greatly appreciated =)

------------------------------------------------

Basically what I would like to do is force all submissions to be ""text"" and enable extra fields (such as authors). Then I would like to add an additional ""review"" section with multiple fields (such as reviewer and text) to the top of that ""link""'s page.  This review should be addable only by moderators, but should have some sort of form submission.  So for starters, **does anyone have any tips on what I would have to do to enable additional submission fields in the "".../r/blah/submit"" form, then have them display on the "".../r/blah/comments/xxxx/xxxxx"" page for that submission?**  Perhaps just a high level description of the process, including which files would have to be modified (and how), would be a *huge* help.

Presumaby I would have to modify:

   1) r2/templates/newlink.html to add the additional form fields.  (Very novice question... is the templating language Mako?  I started getting used to Chameleon with my prototype, but I'm not very familiar with Python web dev.)
    
   2) Whatever model this form gets submitted to.  (Presumably it will still be routed correctly, right?  Maybe for the purposes of understanding, someone could mention how it gets routed there?)
    
   3) The persistent storage.  How is the data actually mapped back to SQL / Cassandra?

The next step will be to make the review submission form for moderators, but I think if I understand how to do this I will have a much better idea of how to tackle that.  Perhaps this post was a bit hasty, since I am still very much exploring on my own, but I figured the sooner I ask the sooner I will get feedback ;).  Regardless, I think others could benefit from a description of how to do this, as I searched for a bit and couldn't really find much (let me know if I just missed it).  Thanks!"	t5_2qizd	True
1332868078.0	rg2we	Request: unread counts for mail, mod mail, mod mail by subreddit (details inside)	honestbleeps	13	7	4	"Just a suggestion:

Currently, to get unread counts, I have to download the JSON that corresponds with the ""listing"" of mail - meaning, for example, /message/unread.json ... then I count the results... that's a decent bit of unnecessary data for Reddit to send, and for me to parse through.

For mod mail, there isn't (that I'm aware of) even an unread page -- so I'd need to download 100 messages (since that's what my prefs are set at) and parse through them individually counting up the ""new"":""true"" flags to determine the unread count...

It would be great if I could just make a simple query that returned only the data I need... something like:
    {
      ""unread"":""6"",
      ""last_unread_timestamp"": [UTC timestamp]
    }

I'm not even sure what other data would be needed / useful beyond that, but I'm guessing it'd be more efficient than downloading the JSON data that includes the text of every message, etc...

Ideally, I'd love to have this for:

- messages/mail

- mod mail  [general]

- mod mail [separated by subreddit, i.e. unread messages to r/whatever]

I have a weird problem when trying to install reddit. It all began with the ""keyspace reddit not found"" error message (more details [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/182#issuecomment-1755430)). I was advised to create a new keyspace using cassandra-cli. However when I've tried to connect using the ""connect localhost/9160;"" I was greeted by this:

The program doesn't seem to react to commands such as ""service cassandra stop"" or ""/etc/init.d/cassandra stop"" at all.

Would it be acceptable to send the PMs from my own account, or will a certain volume of them get me flagged somehow, or start requiring a captcha after some point?

Before I get into the details I feel it necessary to point out that while I'm an experienced programmer, I've done very little in the way of Python development (basically, I'm pretty much a newb in that regard). Also, I'm only slightly more experienced with regard to Linux. I'm reasonably capable on the command-line but it's not my primary OS and I'll be the first to admit that I'm no guru. Please forgive me if I erred in some way in attempting to get this to work. 

I'm trying to setup a local Reddit dev environment partly as an exercise and partly to see if I might in some small way contribute to the community. To this end I reasoned that the best place to start would be to download the VM.  Despite having some minor issues with getting the image start VM (VT wasn't enabled in the BIOS and the HP BIOS had dumbed down setting labels which didn't allow me to quickly identify which settings were in need of toggling) eventually I got it running and everything came up fine. Once the VM booted up I happily found that all the services started up and I was able to access the server from a browser in the host.

Of course, anytime you want to begin coding, or even just looking at the code, you will want to work off the latest version. So I attempted to update the sources under the ~/reddit folder. This is where things went awry.

At first I tried updating it by pulling in the latest source and did manage to get it to build, but I ran into the error described above and then tried to completely replace that folder by removing it and then following the instructions in the 
[Start to Finish](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/RedditStartToFinish#CheckingoutGIT) guide to pull down the latest code.

After many false starts, I finally managed to get it to build, but every attempt to get it to run has failed with the above error. I'm guessing that there is some basic incompatibility with the pycassa and thrift packages installed, but I've not determined how to resolve this and Google isn't providing many clues on this one. I did try installing updated versions of pycassa (modified the ~/reddit/r2/setup.py to reference a slightly newer version) but I determining that was a dead end and restored to 0.3.0 version. I then followed [these instructions](http://pycassa.github.com/pycassa/installation.html) for updating the Thrift python package. Updating thrift python packages also had no effect.

If anyone has any ideas as to what has gone wrong or if you require more information please let me know.

FYI: I did run into issues in trying to build latest sources whereby it was necessary to install the Cython package and update the BeautifulSoup package. I'm currently trying to verify these and any other steps which were taken prior to getting the error above and I will post those once the refreshed VM decides to cooperate (PostgreSQL didn't start properly for some reason and it's taking forever to shutdown). I had every intention of posting a step-by-step guide of updating the VM when I could not find one, but until I can get it to work I can't guarantee the steps I've taken are valid. Of course if a guide to getting the VM up-to-date exists, please feel free to point it out!

1291942699.0	ej9az	Reddit Timing Out	nubsauce111	9	3	1	"I have been playing around with the reddit VMWare image and have been trying to replace the [reddit header in the upper left hand corner](http://static.reddit.com/reddit.com.header.png) with my own image. By default it is set to [http://static.reddit.com/reddit.com.header.png](http://static.reddit.com/reddit.com.header.png). 
 
I've searched for help and found instructions telling me to change the string referencing this location that is found in [/r2/r2/models/subreddit.py](http://code.reddit.com/browser/r2/r2/models/subreddit.py) on line 721 to be the new location. I can no longer remember where I found the documentation telling me how to do this and I can't seem to find it in any searches. 
 
I made this change, and restarted my reddit. Afterward, my reddit would no longer load. It times out every time. Even after undoing the changes I made, the reddit still times out. I have repeated this process once already, so I am fairly certain that this change is what is causing my problem. 
 
* Firstly, I believe that there has got to be a better way to apply changes to .py files than rebooting reddit. I would be highly appreciative of anyone who can let me know how to do this. 

* Second, does anyone have any idea how I can recover my reddit from this, ideally without having to start it from scratch? 

* Third, does anyone know of a working way to change the reddit header image?  

Thanks everyone!

    EDIT: I managed to solve this problem. It turns out that the documentation I had read before was correct 
    and modifying the subreddit.py file will change your header image. It would have helped if I had gotten the 
    URL I was using for the replacement image correct. (I had been copying from a file that had http;//)

    I would still appreciate anybody would could instruct me as to how to apply the changes I make without 
    having to reboot. Thanks again!"	t5_2qizd	True
1291062045.0	edi0g	Aggregate Submission Data	Xodarap	7	2	6	"I basically want to do the following query:

    select count(*), avg(votes), avg(comments) from submitted_links
    where user = &lt;me&gt;
    group by subreddit

Then I can display stuff using fancy graphs etc.

I started to implement this by downloading my data to a local db (props on the awesome API, btw) and working on it there, but I realized that this was kind of stupid if Reddit would allow me to build this functionality into the site. 

If I made this, would it be something that I could donate to reddit? Otherwise, it's probably easier for me to just do it locally.

EDIT: I realize reddit doesn't have that db layout, I was using it as pseudocode. A more realistic query might be something like:

    select avg(Ups - Downs) from Thing
    where Thing.Type=""Link"" AND Thing.ID in (
        select distinct Thing_ID from Data
        where Data.Key = ""User"" AND Data.Value = &lt;me&gt;
    )

I'm still downloading the VM, so that might not be exactly right, but you get the gist.

1: Use lucene parser for user input. It is more natural, can use boosts on field:keyword pairs, can use wildcards and Boolean operators. In this case you can only use Dismax for ""must not have"" which can be made with lucene using AND NOT.

 
2: Don't use the LowercaseFilterFactory. It doesnt work as it should. Makes the wildcards unusable.

 


3: Default query operator should be AND. Internal query if i search for ""reddit alien"" should look something like this: 

    (title:(reddit+alien)^150+OR+content:(reddit+alien)^80)+AND+NOT+spam:(true)

The fields are OR'ed but user input is AND'ed. That way the search will be more accurate.



4: Add more boost to title, less to content and no boost to the other fields. Add the subreddit and other filters as facets with quotes. (more accurate).

I'm misunderstanding something here about OAuth2 as it pertains to non-browser based applications.


So I'm at the point where I can generate proper URLs for protected, scoped resources but I'm not quite sure how a 'headless bot application' would go about retrieving the access token (barring some custom code to 'click' the allow access button - which seems totally wrong)


For example, say my bot has determined it should post a comment:
http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#POST_api_comment


First, it would need to get an access token using an URL like this one:
https://ssl.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?state=[generated-state]&amp;redirect_uri=[my-apps-redirect-uri]&amp;response_type=code&amp;client_id=[my-key]&amp;duration=temporary&amp;scope=submit


Then, it would need to use that access token in it's next request to make a new comment. My disconnect right now is how to avoid needing to 'manually click' the allow access button - since my app is just a bot.


I've seen bots on reddit before, so I know this can be done - my google fu is just not very good at finding examples of this.

Assume I don't know whether my thing is a submission or a comment.

If I don't want to parse the URL, presumably I can do this:

    submission = rh.get_submission(url = my_url)
    if submission.permalink == my_url:
        object = submission

So, is this the proper way to do this? I'm concerned because I don't have total control over the URL, and the URL might not be normalized.

edit:

I'm concerned this would crash if the URL is not normalized and there are no comments, but that would presumably be an easy fix. It may also make sense to test the comment first and see if its ID is present in the URL, then test the submission ID against the URL:

    submission = rh.get_submission(url = my_url)
    if len(submission._comments) &gt; 0 and my_url.find(submission._comments[0].id) &gt;= 0:
        object = submission._comments[0]

        object = submission

On my clone, I am trying to modify how the spotlight bar behaves. Instead of promoted links and links from user-subscribed reddits, I want to show posts from a **specific subreddit**, which will be used for announcements and such.

I tried modifying the organic.py in r2/lib, this line:

    def organic_links(user):
        sr_ids = Subreddit._by_name(""my_announcement_reddit"")

But this now shows the empty box (I had to get lose of the .sort() and similar things because I have only one, not a list of subreddits). I also tried posting something there, to rule out the ""freshness"" issue.

How can I achieve this?

Thanks!

It was indeed the proxy. The following praw.ini configuration is working for me on PythonAnywhere:

    [reddit_nossl]

**test.py**:

    import praw
    r = praw.Reddit(user_agent='Trying out PRAW on PythonAnywhere',site_name='reddit_nossl')
    submissions = r.get_subreddit('opensource').get_hot(limit=5)
    print [str(x) for x in submissions]

The reddit_nossl settings are as the name implies, and log_requests: 2, check_for_updates: false

Using wget to access the same url works, [pastie link](http://pastie.org/pastes/7998257/text?key=9gpwt88jid8zww3ykt0yg)

I also tried using just requests.get, which also works. [script](http://pastie.org/pastes/7998286/text?key=49wrr8rknnn4gkignsqflq), [output](http://pastie.org/pastes/7998283/text?key=t1qfmdty0jkkxtq5uj2svg)

An admin at PythonAnywhere has said it's not a proxy issue, which is showing other users accessing reddit. I'm stumped, but that's not saying a whole lot. Is something staring me in the face?

**Edit**:

I added some debugging, and modified the request pool as suggested. The new script looks like:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import praw
    import requests
    import logging
    import httplib
    httplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1
    logging.basicConfig()
    logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    requests_log = logging.getLogger(""requests.packages.urllib3"")
    requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    requests_log.propagate = True

    # Works
    print 'Making basic Requests get'
    requests.get('http://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/.json?limit=5')

    # Doesn't work
    print '\n\nImporting PRAW and requesting submissions'
    r = praw.Reddit(user_agent='Trying out PRAW on PythonAnywhere',site_name='reddit_nossl')
    submissions = r.get_subreddit('opensource').get_hot(limit=5)
    print [str(x) for x in submissions]

I manually edited PRAW's handlers.py to modify the pool, the first 2 lines of the PRAW output shows the settings.

The output is rather long, so I'll [link to it here](http://pastie.org/pastes/7998858/text?key=pzb01ahx79yzmbsp9k7na)

JSONP only works for GET requests. 

[CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is designed to address this, but [a request to add it seems to have been ignored](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/432).  In response to spladug's comment:

&gt; If you have a specific example of a portion of the API that you would want to support CORS and that can be done so without allowing third party websites to arbitrarily execute actions as yourself, then please let us know.

My response would be: any API endpoint that is POST and does not require oauth (if it doesn't require authentication, the action probably isn't tied to yourself).  Specifically, api/morechildren.  

Or just make api/morechildren a GET endpoint since it's reeeaaally just a fancy read-only endpoint.  Or am I overcomplicating this and is there an easy way to get my morechildren in a regular browser script? "	t5_2qizd	True

I'm not super familiar with web scripting and I'm kind of at the ""know enough to break everything"" phase of using jQuery, but I got the scraper mostly working... on publicly accessible pages.

I'm trying to use JSONP to grab likes and dislikes and it's throwing a 403 error, even on the account I'm logged into (I can grab the standard JSON version just fine from my browser, but obviously not from the script due to origin control).  Is there a way to log into reddit from a remote script, or at least to convince reddit that I'm already logged in?  The API documentation doesn't seem to indicate that oauth is usable for this.

1367766233.0	1dqeri	Problems with /api/submit.json and Captcha	lospheris	6	0	2	"So I have been trying to learn the Reddit API with python. The final goal of the project is to post encrypted messages to a subreddit. I got the idea from http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9. I know it isn't very practical but I wanted to play with the Reddit API and the crypto libraries in python. The problem is that I don't have enough karma, apparently, to make posts without captchas so I decided to just write a way to solve the captchas into the program. My first submit seems to go fine. I get the captcha iden, get the captcha, and respond with the iden and the captcha letters in the parameters. I always get an error 500 from Reddit when I post with the captcha data.

There is a copy of my code below. I can't for the life of me figure out what I am doing wrong. If anybody could point me in the right direction it would be amazing. I haven't been using a wrapper for the API because I want to actually learn the API not just use it. I have also googled as much as I can and looked at various wrapper source code and even the Reddit source code and can't see what I am doing wrong.

https://gist.github.com/lospheris/5520957

Also, some of the stuff in the class is for using it with a GUI. For the most part I play with it from the python shell but I have a quickly thrown together GUI that I played with too so that is why there are a few things that aren't actually required for talking to reddit."	t5_2qizd	True

I was planning on having my program mark unread messages in the inbox as 'read' after it finishes processing the message, but it seems like there are flaws in this plan. 
For example, if I accidentally log on to the reddit account associated with the bot, I might accidentally open up a message and it wouldn't be processed by the bot.

The PRAW tutorials have a method in which processed submissions are kept track of using the submission ID.

Would this be the best method for handling messages?

It has a required parameter `flair_template_id` but I can't find any useful information about it. I see it's part of the flair selection form, but this is the only place it's provided, embedded in this HTML form. A form that is served by an unlisted API point,`/api/flairselector`. This API doesn't serve anything when the flair isn't editable by the requesting user, making these values effectively private.

Is there any reasonable way to access this id? Why can't I refer to flair by its CSS name, like the one flairlist serves? It seems the flair API is partly broken right now because of this strange parameter.

Im trying to make an app just for learning purposes. I want to get the list of subreddits that a user is subscribed to.

I managed to get this going and you can find it over [here](https://github.com/shrayas/slashsub) on my Github. But my question is this: 

Why does one have to authorize the app every time he tries to login with reddit? isn't that a one time thing? If he's already logged in to Reddit it should automatically redirect back to the callback URL is what i feel. 

Maybe i'm doing something wrong.. In a gist here's what im doing

    #get object
    r = praw.Reddit(...)

    # set oauth info
    r.set_oauth_app_info(...)

    # get URL
    r.get_authorize_url(...)

However, I'm wondering what is the right way to reuse that access once I've gotten the tokens from Reddit.   

I created a 'get_user_data()' function to reuse the token, and within that I perform an r.refresh_access_information(refresh_token).   Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to immediately update the user information for the user that the refresh token is for.   Instead, it seems to take 2 calls to get_user_data() in order to get the current information for the user I'm interested in.

If r.refresh_access_information() is the correct function to use, how to I force PRAW to block long enough to get the information for the user that the refresh token is for, rather than returning the information for the last user that get_user_data() was called for?

1344700773.0	y1utr	Bacon - Reddit extension for Safari: help needed (testing/artwork/code review).	jsribeiro	7	1	2	"Hello.

I've been developing, for the last few days, **Bacon**, a Reddit extension for Safari.

The extension implements a toolbar button that, when clicked on an open page, checks if that page was already submitted to Reddit and, if so, shows a popover with some info:

* thumbnail;
* score;
* author;
* subreddit;
* number of comments;
* the submission title.

It also provides links to the discussion page and a link to submit the page if it's not found.

The extension is fully functional, but I'm currently needing help on three fronts:

* **code review**: it's my first incursion in javascript and Safari extension development, so there may be some major design flaws or room for improvement;
* **testing**: I've been testing the extension, but extra testing is always welcome;
* **artwork**: there are two art assets needed: one icon for the toolbar and one icon for the extension itself (which is also used in the popover).

This last step is important if the extension is to be submitted to Apple's extension gallery. I'm currently using the Reddit alien for the extension icon, but for the toolbar icon I'm using an envelope icon from the [Mail Open Tabs](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/extensions/) extension, which is not acceptable. And I really can't make a decent toolbar icon (I've tried).

http://imgur.com/a/0ZccI

Can anyone offer an explanation as to why this happens? It happens more on stories that reach the frontpage 100 than when they dont make it. Is this some database synchronization bug, some bot accounts downvoting stores in synchronicity, or something else? Or maybe it is part of the spambot deterrent system. All theories or actual explanation is welcome!

By the way, if interested, I'll PM a link to my interface but it is in a very beta format running on a micro instance of EC2 so it can really only handle a couple of users for now."	t5_2qizd	True

I'm working on a project that will pull videos from subreddits that Redditors are subscribed to. Problem is, I want to be able to scrape subreddits in the background while the user isn't logged in, and Reddit doesn't support OAuth, which would mean I'd have to store credentials.

Anyone have any insight into a good way to pull this off without screwing shit up, security wise? 

What I have thought of already:
- AES/Rjindael encryption for passwords (planning on using http://crypt.rubyforge.org/rijndael.html)
- Encrypted data kept on a different server than the secret key
- SSL for /api/login
- Server security precautions (iptables, firewall, etc)

Another option would just be to cache the user's subreddits once, and never store the credentials, but any time the user updated their subreddits they'd have to refresh it my app. The idea of the project is that it becomes your feed of personalized video content, so I'd like to make the user experience as smooth as possible.

1)  The domain in .config/reddit_api/reddit_api.cfg has to match the .ini config for the server, even if they both point to the same IP.  I had a couple DNS names configured for my site, and PRAW started complaining that I hadn't logged in even though I had.  E.G., if the .ini file has reddit1.example.com and your reddit_api.cfg file has reddit2.example.com (both of which point to your server), PRAW will not recognize your login (and not throw an error either until you try to do something that requires the login).  It took a while to debug :/

2) Here is an example for make_moderator, which is not shown on the wiki:

    import reddit
    r = reddit.Reddit('some user agent','myreddit')
    sub = r.get_subreddit('mysubreddit')

My friends asked me to write them a small python script which logs in an account upvotes a post and repeats (for the same post). They figured that if they could get a lot of fast upvotes it would give the reddit post a little bump. They aren't spammers etc. My script runs perfectly, it loops through a block of code that logs in an account from a pre defined list, upvotes a predefined submission and loops back. When I check the post it only has gained one upvote. A) Why is this. and B) how can I get my program to work properly. I think that the website searches for votes coming from one ip and will only take one. If this is the case can someone please provide a bit of code that will log into a proxy?

I tried it on Mac OS X Lion, but I'm not getting the long response times there. (so the wrapper seems to be working well?)

So I'm playing around with python and the Reddit API, and I've hit a roadblock when trying to fetch the json from /new pages. For example, here's some code that works as expected:

    import urllib.request
    import json

    response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/.json').read()
    jsonResponse = json.loads(response.decode('utf-8'))
    print(jsonResponse['data']['children'])

This outputs the array of submissions on the frontpage of r/pics. But if I attempt to get the submissions from the 'new' section of [/r/pics](/r/pics) (so the url is now ""http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/new/.json""), then I get '[]' returned.

    jsonResponse['data'].items()

shows

    dict_items([('modhash', ''), ('children', []), ('after', None), ('before', None)])

If I load the url in my browser (with a json viewer extension) I can see and read the children array just fine for both the front page and /new/. For some reason, python can't. Other pages like /controversial/ and /top/ also work fine in python.

Someone suggested spoofing my user agent, but that is explicitly against the rules of using the API, and I wasn't sure if it was okay for debugging at least. Thought it better to post here first. Someone else pointed out that it's because I'm logged out, and the json returned by a logged-out browser is the same as what python is getting. I don't know if that's a feature or a bug, though.

I asked this in r/learnprogramming and was kindly pointed in your direction.

I have been researching algorithmic sorting systems like the one used here on Reddit and I wonder if anybody has any experience actually implimenting one into a system that could share their knowledge.

To test it I grabbed reddit's Python code (https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_sorts.pyx) and while I can happily pass in perameters and have it return a score, I'm still completely baffled as to how this would work in practice. 

You would surely not have a server iterating in an eternal loop over each submission in the database, passing the data to the python script to re-calculate the score, passing it back to the db to store and re-index?

Is this process run when a vote is logged, perhaps? Or am I completely off the mark?

Would anybody be able to share a rough description of how the algorithm works in practise and how it interfaces with the database? It would really help me plug an infuriating gap in my understanding. :)

the problem."	DaveChild	8	3	5	"I've not contributed to the reddit code before and don't know if this would be of wider interest. It's a fairly simple bit of JavaScript, using jQuery to find your comments and provide a way to jump to them.

The simplest way to see it in action is to copypasta this code into your address bar (tested in FF and Opera on Linux):

    javascript:(function() {if (reddit.logged) {var yc = $('.noncollapsed a[href=http://www.reddit.com/user/' + reddit.logged + ']'); if(yc.size() &gt; 0) { $('.cloneable').eq(0).after('&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=""rounded gold-accent comment-list-box""&gt;&lt;div class=""title""&gt;Jump to your comments:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;');for(var i=0;i&lt;yc.size();i++){var text = yc.eq(i).parent().parent().find('.usertext-body .md').text(); if (text.length &gt; 54) { text = text.substring(0, 50)+' ...';} $('.comment-list-box div:last').eq(0).after('&lt;div id=""yourcomment' + i + '""&gt;#'+(i+1)+': '+text+'&lt;/div&gt;');}for(var i=0;i&lt;yc.size();i++){var cs = yc.eq(i).offset().top;$('#yourcomment'+i).bind('click',(function (lcs) { return function(){$('html,body').animate({scrollTop: lcs},500);}})(cs));}};};})();

I'm after feedback, suggestions for improvement, and some idea of whether this is worth submitting to the main codebase.

Here's a more readable version of the code for those of you geeky enough to be interested. Which I would guess is a reasonable percentage in /r/redditdev :)

1279711180.0	crzum	Problems submitting links on fresh Reddit install (Debian)	snooo	7	2	3	"Hi Guys, 

I'm having some issues trying to submit links on this brand new reddit installation.

I don't see any error showing up in the log, even when turing debug mode on. (Probably I'm not looking in the right place..)

This is what happens: 

I try to submit text: Browser (all of them) 'hangs' on showing red 'Submitting...' message.. nothing happnes. HOWEVER, the message GETS posted once you return to the subreddit manually. 

If I try to submit a URL: Same behaviour in the browser.. get to 'Submitting...' then nothing. The post never gets into the subreddit (nor can I find any trace of it in the database.. )

The only other 'abnormality' I can see is that the submit page is a bit different formated then the current running production page on reddit. 

It's missing the blue frames around the input windows, the the default size of those windows are wrong (very small) . In IE you can resize them properly, but in FF and Chrome you are stuck with the wrong size..   I assuming the CSS is not loaded properly but this is something I will look into next. 

Other then that the installation seems to be working fine. Only futher issue I had was running populatedb(). This seemed to do what its suppose to do (post the google.com url to the subreddit reddit_test2 etc..) , but hangs once finnished. 

Ps. I have downgraded to Paste &amp; PasteScript 1.7.2 (from 1.7.3 that gets installed with the build) . It would not run at all with 1.7.3

1253111414.0	9l5i2	iReddit bugs and various features	roxm	7	3	7	"I use iReddit a lot, and I paid a good two or three minute's worth of salary for the privilege, so I DESERVE TO HAVE ALL OF MY DEMANDS MET, RAWR.  Totally kidding, I know that sometimes bug reports or enhancement requests can come off the wrong way.  I would do this myself if I had access to the source, but I don't, so.

First, a bug:

 * When scrolling to the bottom of the list, the ""Updating..."" banner pops up.  If you scroll down again while the banner is still up, it seems to kick off another request in the background, and when it finishes you will have two (or more) copies of the next page of stories added to the bottom of the list.  (My high score is currently like six or seven copies, but it doesn't save the score either -- is that another bug?)

Some assorted enhancement requests:

 * In the main story view, it's difficult to click on the comment button to go directly to the comments.  Could the active area for that button be made to take up the entire rightmost side of the list item?
 * It would be nice to be able to swipe left-to-right across a story in the main list view, the way you delete items in other list views -- in iReddit's case, to reveal a button to hide the story.  Especially the Glenn Beck stories.
 * There is an already-reported bug (I assume) about going to a specific comment within a story from your mailbox -- sometimes you'll click on the comment and be taken to a blank page.  Although this may actually have been a problem with the site instead of iReddit because now I can't actually reproduce the behavior in order to describe it accurately.
 * I'd like to be able to see profile pages via iReddit, especially my own, because I like to obsess over whether or not my latest comments are getting the proper number of upvotes.  YES I'M NEUROTIC, LEAVE ME ALONE.
 * When there are many (many [many]) comments on a story, the comments view doesn't show all of them, and it doesn't offer a way to load the comments that aren't displayed.  This is disconcerting when you're looking for a comment on a story that you know is present (because you're the author [NEUROSES]) and it's nowhere to be found.
 * Ideally I'd like the WebView-based comments view to be replaced with something more custom, except I don't know exactly what that would be.  It gets pretty unresponsive when there are tons of comments -- just highlighting a comment can sometimes cause a painful delay.
 * When clicking on a link from a comment, it should load in a new WebView and cause the breadcrumb arrow at the top left corner to add a context frame.  As it stands right now, you have to click on the little arrow in the web-browsing widget in the top right in order to get back to the comments, and if you're not paying attention and you click on the arrow in the top left, you go all the way back to the main story list.

I really dig the more recent improvements -- interpretation of Markdown, ability to browse a reddit you're not subscribed to, less crashy crashy, and so on -- these are just things I noticed and wanted to share.

Edit: More things I noticed!

 * Self-posts aren't getting their Markdown processed.  This post in particular looks hysterical.
 * Self-posts have the book/comment icon present in the bottom bar, but it doesn't do anything.  Maybe hide it for self-posts?

Edit: More things!  I'm getting down to pretty petty pitter patter at this point, but I wanted to share because I PAY YOUR SALARY, RAWR

 * Edited posts don't have a visual indicator like they do on the website.  This is not a huge deal, but probably wouldn't take much to add, except now that I look at the JSON feed it seems like the indicator is not present, so WTF SHIT'S BROKEN SOMEONE HAD BETTER FIXXIT
 * The current HTML-riffic comments view has very small hitboxes for the collapse and expand widget, and since it's right next to the username, it will be very easy to miss and go to the user page instead of collapsing the comments (edit before I actually finish this edit: I just realized that you can click anywhere on the line, not just on the teeny [-] icon, so NEVERMIND but I WON'T DELETE THIS, NOT EVER)
 * It would be nice to be able to upvote or downvote articles without clicking through, because I enjoy judging a book by its cover.  The same goes with comments -- it's kind of weird to have to select the comment and hit the teeny 'vote up' button underneath the comment box.  I think I just miss coloring in white H's, to be honest.
 * Also, if you switched to a custom view for the comments, then you could have a dedicated full-screen comment editing dealy, which might be nice, similar to how the Facebook app does comment editing (yes, I just admitted to both being a Facebook user and to being so addicted to Facebook that I use the iPhone app, PLEASE KILL ME) but then you might not be able to scroll through the list of comments, so I'm not sure this is a good idea.
 * Also, would it be possible to save the list of stories in the main view to some sort of permanent storage?  In low-memory situations, such as when you click on just about any story that's not a 16x16 pixel image on imgur, the entire story list appears to get reloaded from the server (apparently one page at a time), and sometimes the results don't match up with what *had* been there before the iPhone gave up trying to remember what it was doing a minute ago.  I don't know enough about the iPhone SDK to know whether or not using permanent storage like this is a good idea, but at least it would be faster than loading them over the net again.
 * And, hey, if you're putting them in storage, maybe you could dedupe them?  Due to the way Reddit works, when you request the 'next' page, you're actually requesting stories 'after' a specific story, but if that story moves in the ordering that you've requested, then you can wind up with stories you've already seen.  On the web, there's not much you can do about this since you don't have enough context to remove the duplicates, but since the story list is being downloaded to the phone, you can just compare the story ids to the story ids you've already got in the list, and just kick out the duplicates.
 * Also, and I REALIZE I AM BEING KIND OF HYPERACTIVE AND I NEED TO TAKE MY MEDICATION BUT BEAR WITH ME PLEASE, it would be neat if there was a persistent envelope widget in the upper right that would turn orangered when you had a new reply, and that took you directly to your mailbox.  Also, push notifications, but I realize that's not as easy as it is to type out ""push notifications"".
 * Also, search would be nice.

Also also, I have about as much free time as a mother of sixteen who runs a large corporation and plays professional hockey, but I also have some obj-c chops, and if you're interested I could try to put together a comments view if you wanted to move away from the WebView that you're using now.  I don't have the iPhone SDK but I could just do it using desktop-style Cocoa and let you tidy it up when it's done.

1369846230.0	1fa01t	Need help testing back-end API for redditanalytics.	RedditAnalytics	6	3	4	"I am creating an API that will allow developers to retrieve submissions and comments far faster than by using Reddit itself.  I am also creating a ""comment stream"" that is similar to Twitter's streaming API.

The API is located at http://api.redditanalytics.com/

Now, here's what it can currently do:

It currently has around 25 million submissions and around 250 million comments.  The submission API is in alpha and I need some testers.  

Here's how you use it:

**Required GET variables:**

*key* (set this to anything right now)

**Optional GET variables:**

*beforedate* Retrieve (up to limit) submissions in descending order.  This can be set to two different values.  You may either use unixtime or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.  Keep in mind that the second option is in UTC time (not your time-zone, unless you're in UTC :)  This cannot be used at the same time as beforeid 


*limit* Return X results.  Maximum value is currently 50.  Once we get out of alpha I will increase it.  


*beforeid*  The same as before date, but using submission ID's.  (i.e. t3_z2317)  This cannot be used at the same time as beforedate.


*subreddit*  If present, only return submissions from that subreddit.  This can be used in conjunction with either beforeid or beforedate


**Example:  You want to scrape everything from a specific subreddit from most recent working backwards**

You want to retrieve only submissions from askreddit starting with the most recent and working back.

First call your program makes will be to:
http://api.redditanalytics.com/?limit=50&amp;subreddit=askreddit&amp;key=pleasework

The return will be in JSON and will have two variables that you will be interested.  The variable ""data"" is an array with all of your results (in the same format that reddit provides them).  The second variable is ""info"" and it will return another beforeid to you.  You can then pass:

http://api.redditanalytics.com/?limit=50&amp;subreddit=askreddit&amp;key=pleasework&amp;beforeid=&lt;whatever beforeid was returned to you&gt;

You can put that in a loop to scrape all the submissions from a particular subreddit.


**Example:  You want to get submissions from before UTC April 1, 2013 at noon**

http://api.redditanalytics.com/?limit=50&amp;key=yaddayadda&amp;beforedate=2013-04-01%2012:00:00 (%20 is URI encoding for a space)





Groundrules:

**Please don't destroy my server.**  It is a piece of shit cloud server with 1 gig of ram  and a one core processor.  If I get funding, I will get a better server that will be much faster.  Please realize that the server may be slow to return results at times.

Please limit your requests to 2 a second.  If you serialize your requests and go above 2 a second, I won't mind.  The point is to wait until one request is completed before you make another.  Please don't make parallel requests.  

If the server is unavailable, it has probably crashed.  Let me know if this happens (or if I see it happen, I will correct it).  

I have set the server to FORCE deflating the returned data which means your client should expect to handle the compression correctly (most do).  I am doing this because I have limited outbound bandwidth and I have no idea how much data will end up going out (knock on wood). 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  I will be including more GET attributes like author, q (keyword search) and others in the coming days / weeks.  I will also be putting together the comment API if I get more funding.

Stuck_In_the_Matrix	4	0	0	"For my [Reddit analytics project](http://goo.gl/kVJMx), I was using Ajax calls to update the information and graphs on the main screen.  Unfortunately, this calls for making a request each second to the back-end server.  While the back-end server can handle that, there is latency involved during the round-trip request for data retrieval.  

Also, there appears to be some type of memory leakage with some browsers when tons of ajax requests are made over an hour (3,600 to be exact).  

After switching to Websockets, the application runs much smoother both on the client-side and the back-end.  I am using Mojolicious for Perl as the websocket server on the back-end.  With one processor, it is able to handle around 100 open connections simultaneously while still managing to sort and process the Reddit stream.

I know that I could just go ahead and manually parse the object and e.g. store the values to a csv file. But this seems so odd to me and I want a more fluent solution.

I am trying to figure this out and I have been searching for some resources and sample code, but without luck. I did find one user wanting to do the similar thing, here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/reddit-dev/FLwJKuny6TU

But the issue is that that code is old more than 3 years, so I couldn't to the exact same thing on the current version. This is what I did, but I am still getting the ""that name isn't going to work"" message:

1.  As suggested, I added sys.setdefaultencoding('utf8') to the sitecustomize.py in /etc/python2.7/sitecustomize.py and in /usr/lib/python2.7/sitecustomize.py
(first I did import sys, then added that line at the end)
2. After that, I followed the instructions the suggested, and did the changes in the following lines (this is for the **current** version of the code)

&gt;r2/r2/models/subreddit.py:162: 
&gt;name = name.decode(""utf-8"").lower()

I couldnt figure out how to implement this change,    
&gt;q =  cls._query(lower(cls.c.name) == name.decode(""utf-8"").lower(),

the updated code receives a list there, lnames,
&gt;q = cls._query(lower(cls.c.name) == lnames, 

and this code too
&gt;#lower name here so there is only one cache
&gt;names, single = tup(names, True)

this thing was previously was simpler, probably just name = name.lower(), and now there are changes to the code which I don't understand :(

3 . In r2/r2/models/link.py:305, I changed the line to:
&gt;res = ""/r/%s/%s"" % (sr.name.decode(""utf-8""), p) 

4 . In r2/r2/models/account.py:288, I changed it to:
&gt;cls._by_name_cache(name.decode(""utf-8"").lower(), allow_deleted, 
_update = _update) 

5 . In r2/r2/lib/subreddit_search.py:44 and :71, I changed them to:
&gt; name = sr.name.decode(""utf-8"").lower() 

In the  filters.py, I changed the line in the _force_unicode() method, from ""latin1"" to ""euc-kr"", since my goal is to allow Korean characters there.

So, those are the changes I have made. But I am still getting that error. I think the main issue is the change in code, in r2/r2/models/subreddit.py:156, where the method to make subreddit name lowercase is not affected by these .decode('utf8') modifications.

So it does see *r.user* as being of the right type (i.e. *LoggedInRedditor*), but it can't find the method *get_saved()*, just like with the non-logged in user object.

Afterwards I get a list of comment ids and I have to make one request per additional comment. This results in making hundreds if not thousands of requests which clearly isn't a good idea. 

Why do there seem to be arbitrary limits on how many comments I can get? Wouldn't it be better for me to make fewer requests for more data at once?

So - in the form of a question - are both cassandra and memcache operating in front of comment pages?  I assume memcache is a pure cache - recreatable.  In the case of cassandra though, I think it's used as a permacache.

So then - am I allowed to bring down/restart cassandra and expect it to come back in the same state?

Is there a way to recreate the comment pages so that they work after this occurrence?  Is there a way to avoid this occurrence?

I changed that to:

                return user_name

and added this in errors.py:

     ('USERNAME_TAKEN_DEL', _('that username is taken by a user who has deleted')),

and added this in login.html:

     ${error_field(""USERNAME_TAKEN_DEL"", ""user"", kind=""span"")}

svc -t etc and then try to register with an existing username and I get

&gt;an error occurred while posting (status: 500)

Watching the logs gives me
&gt;Debug at: http://reddit.local/_debug/view/1303852567

So I bring that up and find

    File '/home/reddit/reddit/r2/r2/controllers/validator/validator.py', line 164 in newfn
      simple_vals, param_vals, *a, **kw)

      uid = cls._by_name_cache(name.lower(), allow_deleted, _update = _update)
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'

Fairly used to traces at least in gdb, so I understand that name seems to be null or the sort. But why? Account._by_name is called before my new var is even called.

Ah no wait, it's a different call to _by_name in account.py, hm. I'm going to guess it's failing to return the new text error then and continuing to attempt to create the account?

[EDIT] There we go, found it. I missed the line in api.py where it makes the form actually return the error.

**author_total_posts**  (unsigned int) This key would show the approximate total posts made by author and could be cached.  From the previous two keys, a developer could calculate an author's average karma per post and choose an appropriate threshold for filtering comments based on these keys.

I want to develop a bot that will work within a specific subreddit and it must be able to do the following:

* Check the subreddit for posts tagged with a certain string.
* Send and receive messages to and from the members.
* Comment on posts.

I don't know where to start, I am a programmer, but don't know how to use the API. I'd like to make it as a Java Application that I could keep running on my machine, monitoring the subreddit and the bot's inbox, but I can work with other languages if necessary.

1369526469.0	1f20l5	[plugin / feature request] In-page alert when browsing a non-reddit page which has a reddit post about it	Retro8	3	0	1	"**Does this already exist?**  
  

**Explanation of feature**  

When browsing any site online, ie. a youtube page or bbc article, you are given an alert if a current reddit post has linked to the article/video/etc. This would operate as an in-browser plugin, and not necessarily a part of RES. *Though I don't know which other plugin developers this post should be seen by.
  
**Why I want this feature**    
I am relatively new to reddit and find it hard to reconcile my new found interest in up-vote based discussions with the time required to simply browse articles from the sites I like. I would love to be able to browse my usual haunts outside of reddit, but to know near-immediately (and automatically) when a reddit discussion based on the very same weblink is waiting for me back on reddit.
  

**Issues**    
Problem: Would the plugin need to check against some sort of library file? If so, this might take up to much resources
Solution: Limit the library to only logging reddit posts which contain a certain minimum amount of comments (ie 1, 5, or 10). Also, limit the library to only retaining records of posts which were created in the last x amount of months (ie 1)
    
**Disclaimers**    
a. This is my 2nd post ever. I spent time trying to find the most appropriate place for this post and /r/Enhancement seemed right. I'm not sure if there is a general plugin developers subreddit somewhere.  
b. I have basically no technical knowledge to know whether this idea is even possible. But i sure as hell couldn't make it.

I'm wondering if the response time should be included in the request time.

## Examples

\#1 Consider response time as part of the 'request':

    reddit.get('/r/all/comments') # synchronous call, waits for response
    sleep(2)
    reddit.get_next() # request more from the server

\#2 Ignore response time

    time_at_request = time.time()
    reddit.get('/r/all/comments') # synchronous call, waits for response
    time_spent_in_request = time.time() - time_at_request
    if time_spent_in_request &lt; 2:
        sleep(2 - time_spent_in_request)
    reddit.get_next() # request more from the server

The first example does not take the response time into consideration. If the server takes 10 seconds to respond, the script will wait an extra 2 seconds before sending another request. Total time between requests is 12 seconds.

The second example calculates the time it takes for the server to respond. If the request takes less than 2 seconds (e.g. 1.5 seconds), the bot will wait for the remainder of the 2 seconds (e.g. 0.5 seconds) before making another request.

I'm inclined to think the second example is OK (within ""2 requests per second"") but I don't want my bot to get banned for rate-limiting."	t5_2qizd	True

This is, again, regarding the instance of this clone of mine. I have covered most of the things, and now there one more thing: setting of the default subreddits. As I see it, there are two things there:
* subreddits on the front page for users that are not logged in
* subreddits that a new user is automatically subscribed to when registering

I found the setting in the ini, ""automatic_reddits"", https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/example.ini#L454 but I can't really seem to figure the effect of this thing. I have tried entering 10 subreddits there, and now tried 15, but the new users get 20 of them when they sign up, and I don't know where did my clone got that number. 

num_default_reddits = 10 
This line was also interesting, as I though it was to decide how many of those will be showed to not logged in users, and how many of them will the new user subscribe too, and I tried setting this number to 15, but that didn't really work as expected.

I spent some time at https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/models/subreddit.py, examinig default_subreddits(), top_lang_srs() and subscribe_defaults(), and I see that there's some sort of relation between the setting of number of reddits, language of the site and popularity, as well as that list of reddits in the automatic_reddits line, but couldn't find exactly how is reddit doing these stuff.

So, I am wondering, could someone explain a bit what is affecting the showing of reddits to anonymous users, which ones will be auto-subiscribed-to for newly registered users, what role does the language setting of the site (in ini, site_lang, or lang_overide??)  has (and how that relates to the languages of those specific subreddits) and, at the end, how could I make this to work as intended, provide a list of reddits for the users to be autosubsribed to, which would ideally be the same thing which anonymous users see?

I imagined the most simple way to do this would be very similar to site owners adding reddit rank or submission widgets to their pages (similar to Facebook and Twitter button/widgets), but done through a bookmarklet instead. Ideally, to limit the links checked, the bookmarklet would prompt me for text to use in finding matching links.

1.  It seems much more suitable to somehow poll the API directly, rather than through a URL request. Is this possible?

2. Also, the reason I use my script on a separate server is because I cannot figure out a publicly accessible path that I could place the script on the reddit source server. Is there such paths, or does the service override non-reddit requests?

1338391903.0	uc7kt	Weird Caching Issues?	RedditSrc4Research	3	0	4	"I noticed when I first installed reddit on a VM there were some weird caching issues, I'm pretty sure with even built in fields.  For example, when a user would post a comment it would appear (through a JS update), but when they hit reload it would be gone.  However, if another logged in user visited the page then it would show up.  It seems that this problem basically fixed itself over time, as if the caching engine ""learned"" the fields and updated them appropriately.

Anyway this issue is now occurring with more than just comments; in particular, [I added more fields to text submissions](/r/redditdev/comments/sxcig/).  I made a new design flow where an author would submit a text post, then a new user type ""reviewer"" would review it, then the author would be able to add a rebuttal.  Each of these are separate usertext objects stored in the link.  I am not sure if this is pertinent, but we just got to the rebuttal stage and are having the same strange caching issues.  The submitted rebuttal will show up immediately (through a JS update), but then will not reappear for the author, or even for non-logged in users.  Other logged in users will be able to see the rebuttal though, so I know it is being saved.

I mention this since the rebuttal field has been mostly unused up until this point, which is why I think the cache isn't recognizing it.  I should also mentioned I just rebooted the server (in case that makes a difference).  Notably, I am not noticing this issue with the other fields I added (such as the ""review"").

Is this a caching issue as I suspect?  If so, is there a way to force the cache to update?  Otherwise is there a way to just disable it? (I don't have enough traffic to merit the caching system anyway...)

 I'm currently writing a bot (the account that's currently posting this) to try to help me keep a personal

'next' links in the previous entries, so they're all linked together.
Like the subject says, I can't post a story via the API.  I can log in
okay, but when I attempt to POST to /api/submit with all the required
information I don't get a reply that looks like any of the replies
documented on the API page.  Instead, I get:

    {""jquery"":[
    [0, 1, ""call"", [""body""]],
    [1, 2, ""attr"", ""find""],
    [2, 3, ""call"", ["".status""]],
    [3, 4, ""attr"", ""hide""],
    [4, 5, ""call"", []],
    [5, 6, ""attr"", ""html""],
    [6, 7, ""call"", [""""]],
    [7, 8, ""attr"", ""end""],

I'm guessing from this it's expecting a CAPTCHA and, as that's
designed explicitly to catch bots, that's exactly what it did.  I've
done everything I can think of to try to convince reddit that the
bot's allowed to post in the subreddit - I put it on the list of
'approved submitters', I verified its e-mail, I even made it a mod,
but I keep getting this response.  Is there any way to fix this?

Perhaps offtopic:  I recognize the format of the return message as
JSON, but what the heck is it trying to tell me?  Those fields mean
nothing to me, unlike (for example) the kind of JSON response I get
after logging in, which is very straightforward.

All the other links in the widget are fine (voting arrows, subreddit title etc). 

I don't know much about programming or html but I assume it's something like a href=\""/r/subreddit/comments/ instead of a href=\""http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments 

Is there any way for me to download the javascript file (so I can fix it and then host it on our server). Or is it something a reddit developer could fix easily?

Also, in a semi-related request is there any way to have a reddit button that displays the number of comments in the thread rather than the points?

    talk.geekherocomic.com/goto?url=url-of-the-comic-strip

Now, that *goto* you see there is an action I have added to the *front* controller, and the code is the following:

What it does is: it figures out if we have the link already, and if not, redirects to the submit page. Of course if we have it, it redirects you there. It used to work like a charm until yesterday, until today I rebooted my server and it stopped working. Let me describe how:

It looks like it doesn't find the link with the *link_from_url* function, so it always redirects me to the submit page. The funny thing is that if I submit it again, my *goto* function will find it from now on.

This is pretty bad for me because it means that now the people can't comment anymore on the old strips.

It's a dict, and an element of the dict is the CSS for the sub, and it's correct, so I know the ""get_stylesheet"" call worked properly.

What can I pass to ""set_stylesheet"" that will not result in this error:

&gt; praw.errors.APIException: (BAD_CSS) `invalid css` on field `stylesheet_contents`

I have tried passing the dictionary, and dictionary[""stylesheet""], and both produce this error.

    rh = praw.Reddit(""whatever"")
    &lt;login&gt;
    sh = rh.get_subreddit(sub)
    ss = sh.get_stylesheet()

    sh.set_stylesheet(&lt;what goes here?&gt;)

ss, stylesheet = ss, ss[""stylesheet""], stylesheet=ss[""stylesheet""], all of these result in the above error.

I am logged on and a moderator of the sub.

I have also tried:

    ss = rh.get_stylesheet(sub)
    rh.set_stylesheet(sub, &lt;whatever&gt;)

... with the same results.

I would like to eventually be able to make changes to the stylesheet, but for now I'd settle for a no-op.

Would you prefer just a simple implementation of all the api methods? or some more complex features?

At the moment I had the idea of maybe making something to handle paging so the user only has to call back / next type methods and it wraps up the before / after parameters and handles them itself.

Also I was thinking of creating some kind of request manager so the 30 calls per minute rule is easy to enforce. Use of this could be optional though.

"	creesch	3	1	11	"I am currently working on an php script to access the json formatted information that is on some pages. 
The code for that script can be found here: https://github.com/creesch/reddit-api-frankenstein-wrapper/blob/master/reddit.php

Since I'd like to use the information in an array I used 

    json_decode($reddit_json, TRUE);

To convert it to an associative array and for most pages this seems to work just fine. However some results give me NULL as result, 'message/inbox' is a good example. At first I thought I might had requested the wrong adress but when I try it with 

    json_decode($reddit_json);

I do get the right information but in an object. 

Since receiving the data didn't seem to be the problem I had a look at the data itself with json_last_error() and this gave me a clue. The result came back as JSON_ERROR_SYNTAX. So I decided to again check the information, this time I didn't change anything about the data I got I just wrote it to a text file with the intention to get it through a validator. But when I do that I get the following 

    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Found&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Found&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The resource was found at &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/login.json?dest=%2Fmessage%2Finbox.json""&gt;http://www.reddit.com/login.json?dest=%2Fmessage%2Finbox.json&lt;/a&gt;;
    you should be redirected automatically.

    &lt;!--  --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr noshade&gt;
        &lt;div align=""right""&gt;WSGI Server&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

And that is where I get lost, when I decode the json to an object I get all the information, when I try to decode it to an array I get NULL and when I do nothing with it I get send this html code. 
If I following the link I do indeed get to see the json formated information but when I try to use the url given in my script it does not return anything. 

So basically: **Why am I able to get the information if I decode it to a object, but do I seem to get a redirect page if I try to decode it to a array?**

edit: 
I have found that my problem is not limited to that page. If I try to do the same on moderator related pages I actually get an array containing a 404 error, if I convert to an object it works just fine.

1348889881.0	10njpx	Help with oauth2 access_token	TheLordB	2	0	6	"I have tried and tried and tried... I am trying to setup grails to use it.  I can't find any examples of anyone using grails with it.


Where i am having great difficulty is with the access_token.

I did get it to work with the rauth python example, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what I have to do to custom code it.

I am working on adding reddit to this oauth java lib https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java.

Anyways I can't get it to work.. so I figure I would try just getting the url working manually as a good first step then I can just monitor what the code is generating and compare it to something I know works.  Problem is I can't get it to work outside of the app either.

So I guess the first question is to make sure the request can be sent as a get.  I do have the url form to get an access code down pat.

This is the URL I have built:
&gt;https://ssl.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token?code=vbla6zKhckQDRVpwSIBRh7EitHU&amp;client_id=MY_CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2FRedditApi%2FbuildApi%2FtestReceive&amp;client_secret=MY_CLIENT_SECRET&amp;grant_type=authorization_code

Anyways if someone could give me a url format that would actually work I would greatly appreciate it.  I have been banging my head against this for hours... I suspect the answer is really simple, but it has eluded me thus far.  I have seen some things that suggest I might need to do:
&gt;https://CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET@ssl.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token

But that hasn't worked with me trying it along with the various parameters from the other url.


Also just in case someone else gets stuck on generating the authorize link this url is working for me:  https://ssl.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2FRedditApi%2FbuildApi%2FtestReceive&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=identity&amp;state=aaaabbbb"	t5_2qizd	True

I'm trying to approximate the number of submissions made to reddit by time and I noticed that there are some inconsistencies in the submission IDs. As I don't have access to the database, can an admin confirm I have correctly identified the inconsistencies?

 * 2005-06-23 11:43:53 through 2006-01-17 23:49:23
    * IDs [87](http://www.reddit.com/comments/87/) through [28128](http://www.reddit.com/comments/87/) and grow in a base10 manor
 * 2006-01-18 01:00:41 through 2007-10-14 01:43:26
    * IDs [sqh](http://www.reddit.com/comments/sqh/) through [2zyj4](http://www.reddit.com/comments/2zyj4/) and use only the base36 numbers that have at least 1 a-z character
 * 2006-01-24 10:10:22 through 2007-07-25 04:38:09 (WTF section)
    * This section is anomalous as the IDs are base36 but in reverse chronological order from [5xowi](http://www.reddit.com/comments/5xowi/) to [5yba0](http://www.reddit.com/comments/5yba0/).
 * 2007-10-15 01:16:02 through the present
    * Starting at [5yba1](http://www.reddit.com/comments/5yba1/) and continuing to grow as base36 numbers.

Going backwards I see that [5yba1](http://www.reddit.com/comments/5yba1/) is a post jedberg made about the new comment system on beta.reddit.com. Can an admin explain the anomolous section? Also what prompted the switch to base36 numbers in the first place? I'm guessing to keep the urls short?

This brings up another question- does that mean when the base36 system was put into place, all the old ids had to be updated in the database to their base10 equivalent of the base36 number? For instance where the first post (id 87) would have been key 87 in the database, it would have to be updated to key 295?

Finally is this an appropriate approximation? Each million submissions (including doubles and spam) since the new comment system has been in place occurs at the following times:

&gt; Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is  correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"". 

But according to http://www.reddit.com/help/voting :

&gt; Upon voting, the highlighted score will have changed +1 or -1      depending on your vote up or down, respectively. Regardless of individual karmas, all votes affect submission scores equally.

So which is it?  In an upvote a single person upvoting?  If so, then it's NOT ""fuzzed"", but then again, it says it IS fuzzed.  Oh reddit...why u so confusing?!"	t5_2qizd	True

1298140438.0	folld	Reddit VM setup question	wundie	4	2	4	"For background, I’m exclusively a Windows user although I suppose you could count Dos as my experience with command line execution.  I’m here because I recognize an opportunity to implement a Reddit clone internally at my office.  I downloaded the VM image and was able to achieve the basics of accessing the site by modifying my host file with ‘reddit.local’.  This is well and good to get me started but I have absolutely no idea had to do much anything else within the VM.  I reviewed the ‘The One Page Linux Manual’ but I’m still not sure how to do the most basic of things.  I realize by not relying on the pre-built VM I could better learn what’s actually happening but at this stage I’m looking to do something along the lines of a rapid proof of concept.  For this, the VM is perfect.  I just need a little bit of assistance to allow me to delve deeper.

Do I need to be able and login the Reddit VM as a super user?  I tried ‘su’ but I guess I don’t have the right password.  I haven’t been able to find anything about this on the Reddit blog.  I wanted to create my own user account and explor that aspect of the system.  

What are the commands to read/edit files? (Such as INIs)  I was looking for something like ‘type example.ini’ or ‘edit example.ini’ but with no success.  

I hate feeling so helpless on a computer.  If someone could just help me with these simple inquires I bet they would get me on my way to better understanding the environment.  Any recommendations for getting more familiar with the Reddit VM build would be appreciated.

1295549917.0	f5yrf	Clicking on Comment Context Link Causes Out-of-Memory Exception	vogon_poem_lover	3	1	10	"**TL;DR** – paster process dies w/ MemoryError when comment context link is clicked. This is repeatable. The “*parents*” dictionary variable containing child-parent comment ID references is corrupt/incorrect. Is this a known issue and/or has this been addressed already?

Once my dev environment was functional and loaded with test data I set about trying to learn more about the architecture and inner working of the application. However, before making any changes I decided it would be best to put together some simple test scripts which would allow me to gather some before/after metrics to ensure that any attempted changes don't make performance noticeably worse.  While running an early version of the testing script I was also simultaneously randomly exploring the application where I was checking out the admin/moderator features and evaluating the links/comments being added by the script. At one point I clicked on the “context” link on a comment displayed in a test user's inbox (comment replies). The page took a very long time to return and when it did the following error text was presented:
    File '/home/reddit/reddit/r2/r2/controllers/validator/validator.py', line 135 in newfn
      return fn(self, *a, **kw)
    File '/home/reddit/reddit/r2/r2/controllers/front.py', line 280 in GET_comments

    File '_builder.pyx', line 203 in r2.models._builder._CommentBuilder.get_items (r2/models/_builder.c:3346)
    MemoryError: 

At that point the *paster* process running the Reddit server had ab-ended. I am able to repeat this issue and when monitoring the system using *top* I found that indeed one *paster* process would continue to suck up memory to the point it would eventually max out and die. I did do some digging in the DB and didn't find anything anomalous with any of the link's comments. However when I put some debugging statements in the code (_builder.pyx), it did reveal that the “*parents*” variable used by the “*get_items*” function  and populated by the “*link_comments_and_sort*” function does contain circular references (i.e. the child and parent ids for some entries are the same).

I'd love to dig into this some more, but I feel compelled to ask if anyone else has experienced this and if they are aware of a fix for this situation besides resetting the system? I'd hate to spend any more time on this and find that this has been addressed or is going to be addressed shortly.

&gt; too many IDE controllers - virtualbox only supports 1

Looks like a conversion to the OVF format from vmware didn't go so well... so I cracked open the OVF file and commented out the second IDE controller there like so:

	&lt;!--
      &lt;Item&gt;
        &lt;rasd:Address&gt;1&lt;/rasd:Address&gt;
        &lt;rasd:Caption&gt;ideController1&lt;/rasd:Caption&gt;

This seemed to fix it as the vm imported and booted up.  Note that I had to exit the import window and go back into it for it to actually reload the OVF file after I modified it.

1277899782.0	ckigm	New Installation: Using the Ubuntu 64-bit.vmdk but on startup of the Sun Virtual Box I get a black screen and no prompt.	slavishmuffin	3	1	1	"Apologies in advance for my thickheadedness. First time trying to get reddit up and running on VirtualBox. 

A couple of questions:

* I've got the VMDK up and running but I get no prompt, and certainly nowhere to put the username and password as suggested on the [Get Code](http://code.reddit.com/) page. 

* I also have the reddit-vm.mf and the reddit-vm.ovf files, but have no idea what to do with them. Suggestions?

Many thanks in advance.


EDIT 1: Now I'm importing the OVF and getting everything set up that way (File &gt; Import Appliance). However I get one of two errors. 

* The appliance import wizard doesn't like that the OVF has two instances of a Hard Disk Controller. Both of type PIIX4

* If the OVF is changed to have only one Hard Disk Controller, the appliance import wizard explains that the SHA1 digest of 'reddit-vm.ovf' doesn't match to the one in 'reddit-vm.mf'. 


EDIT 2: I have upgraded to the latest version of VirtualBox and this seems to have done the trick. The two instances of a Hard Disk Controller are accepted and I'm creating the appliance now.


EDIT 3: Now the reddit-vm exists in VirtualBox. However, on starting it up I get:

* Failed to open a session for the virtual machine reddit-vm. The VM session was closed before any attempt to power it on. 

* Result Code: E_Fail (0x80004005)

* Component: Machine

* ISession: {12f4dcdb-12b2-4ec1-b7cd-ddd9f6c5bf4d}


EDIT 4: This was caused by the VM machine having assigned too much memory. Not enough was left for the 
host OS. 


EDIT 5: Now: Failed to open a session for the virtual machine reddit-vm. 

* VD: error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED opening image file 'c:\...\Ubuntu 64-bit.vmdk'(VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).

* Unknown error creating VM (WERR_CFGM_VALUE_NOT_FOUND).


EDIT 6: I removed the reddit vmdk from the list in the VirtualBox settings, exited and restarted Virtualbox. Now, the VM appears to be running. However, with black screen and non-blinking cursor.

Things seemed to be ok at first, which is why I'm also wondering if I'm already falling behind on some housekeeping operations (but there have just been two people posting things for a day). Any thoughts? And thanks. I'm going to put in the time to learn things, but I know I'll need the help."	t5_2qizd	True
1272324932.0	bwgi3	wrong 'awards' table name?	vafada	2	0	1	"in the RedditStartToFinishIntrepid wiki page, there's a:

    postgres$ createdb -E utf8 awards

but in example.ini, the award database name is:
 
    award_db =       award,       127.0.0.1, ri,   password

see the inconsistency with the 's'?

This is the error i get when i run paster shell example.ini without fixing the name.

1264098667.0	ashz1	Ask Proggit: Help with using GreaseMonkey + Reddit API to hide resubs on other sites?		3	1	2	"I'm creating a GreaseMonkey script to hide obvious reddit re-submissions to Digg, so I have less of a reason to cringe while browsing around that site. My first thought was to just blacklist anything from imgur on Digg, but then got to thinking that the reddit API could prove useful in cross referencing stories and such.

Anyone have suggestions on how to utilize the reddit API to hide stories on Digg (and other sites) that appeared on reddit the day before?"	t5_2qizd	True
1256842758.0	9z3nv	Rate Limiter Help	chwilliam	3	1	7	"I'm having trouble finding information on how the rate limiter works.  Basically what obscene number of requests is required to trip it?  I ask because I turned the dial on my obscene number of requests generator from low to moderately ridiculous and flipped it on.  It seems that, part of the way through, I start getting 503 errors.  As a side effect I seem to accumulate some sort of fun ban timer as a result.  I tried to look into how it works in the source, but it wasn't immediately clear, and there's no explanation anywhere in code.reddit as far as I can see.

Edit: Obscene request generator is an app with a purpose.  I'm not arbitrarily pounding reddit."	t5_2qizd	True

1252884135.0	9k75r	Is it possible to pick up the icon for a subreddit from the json?	marnanel	2	0	2	"I'm writing a reddit client for the Nokia N900 as a hands-on tutorial.  (You can read more about that at http://blogs.gnome.org/tthurman/2009/09/06/n900-tutorial-contents/ if you want.)

I'm going to be adding support for subreddits to a forthcoming version.  I would like to give the user a selector showing the images from the top left-hand corners of the reddits, but there's no copy of the URL for these in the json for each subreddit, nor in the json for www.reddit.com/reddits/.

It did occur to me that there might be a rule that they appeared at a url on thumbs.reddit.com which could be deduced from the ID of the subreddit, just as thumbnails of posts appear at an analogous http://thumbs.reddit.com/t3_*.png address.  This does actually work for many of them:

http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh1i.png is /r/AskReddit
http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh61.png is /r/WTF
http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qhh7.png is /r/lgbt
http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qhhn.png is /r/marijuana

BUT
http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2fwo.png is a false negative for /r/programming; it does have a custom image but it's elsewhere
http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh0u.png is a false positive for /r/pics, which doesn't have a custom image

Is there any way of working this out from the API, or should I just offer them a plain list without icons?"	t5_2qizd	True

I'm running a reddit and serving it through nginx. Occasionally I get the error in the title when opening some pages, and I have no errors in the paster's output. As far as you know, is this error printed by nginx? How could I investigate and get rid of this? It happens fairly often, especially after paster's been online for a while."	t5_2qizd	True
