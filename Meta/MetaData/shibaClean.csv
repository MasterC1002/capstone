This morning, Spock was staring out the window while in the coveted window seat, and Kirk knew that Spock would have none of it if he tried to steal the spot from him. Kirk dragged a toy into Spock's view, and once he knew that Spock was looking at him he began to put on a show of enjoying it. The little devil danced about with it and jumped up and down on it until Spock decided that he wanted to give it a go too, since it's obviously better than window looking!

The second that Spock was out of his window seat Kirk dropped the toy and jumped up there. Spock was left with a boring toy wondering what just happened while Kirk got to watch people walking by.

1365253559.0	1bslgj	Yesterday we lost our best friend of 3 years to a freak car accident.	wondermonkey2k	48	6	19	"I don't know what else to do, so I'm just putting this down to get it out. I don't post much, mostly lurk, but I'm not sure how to handle this right now. I don't mean to upset anyone, so please, if you don't want to hear a horrible story right now look away.

Yesterday evening, our 3 1/2 year old Shiba named Phineas ran out a door that was opened for a split second in the house. In all of our time together, he has **never** done this. Doors have been open and he's just stared at them. But last night, for whatever the reason, be it the first day that's felt like Spring in NJ or something else, he took off running and didn't stop. He only looked back once, and headed down to a cross-walk we cross the street at every day when we walk. Some folks tried to help me grab him down there, but he ran into the street and a truck we were trying to stop ran him over 5 feet from my eyes. It all happened so fast. My wife in I were covered in his blood while pedestrians tried to find the closest vet but he was gone immediately.

We sent our 2 1/2 year old son to his grandmother's house (he was going anyway) but we're not sure how we're going to tell him. Phin was a fixture in his entire life so far.

Anyway, I just needed to get it out. If anyone has any tips on how to get that 5 second loop of the car crushing my best friend out of my head I'd sure appreciate it. Or how to stop the ""what if"" game that I keep doing.

[Here are pictures of him](http://www.fluidr.com/photos/wondermonkey2k/sets/72157622690789227). He was a great friend to everyone. We miss him so goddamn much."	t5_2s5ny	True
