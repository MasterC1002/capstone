1359496159.0	17iqsu	PSA : Catching the Boomerang	Higgelhiggel	119	3	8	"As of the newest update, there exists a new weapon : **the Boomerang**.
It is a new ranged weapon, which is no effects, but damage on hit and coming back after hitting the target.

 **You are able to catch it, while it's coming back.**

**Twist**: It hurts you if you can't catch it and it loses 10% more durability.

Catching the boomerang is possible by clicking it, if it returns.

**Twist2**: It's very difficult to click, because it's small and fast

**Solution:** As it's getting close to you, hit spacebar -&gt; Spacebar performs the next available action, like picking up stuff, cutting down trees(only if axe is equipped) or **catching the boomerang**, thus taking no damage and preserving the boomerang's durability.



**TL;DR**: Press spacebar to catch the boomerang"	t5_2v1jr	True

You can press (and hold) the space bar to perform the action of your selected tool, and continuing to hold space bar will have your character pick up the drops.  For example in a large group of boulders with pickaxe selected will make your guy break them apart, collect the loot, and continue on to the next boulder. 

The same idea with picking grass and twigs, holding space will make your character just keep on collecting.

Before this discovery I was pointing and clicking every single drop.  Using the space bar is way more efficient!  Hope this helps someone!"	t5_2v1jr	True

Being struck by lightning heals him, makes him glow, lowers his sanity, and makes him run fast. in the world settings, max out lighting, so it will strike every 30-ish seconds, raining or not. This mans that you will be constantly healed, but always minimum sanity, and moving fast. You will also be able to survive night most of the time without a fire. The challenge is: Build a standard base, with farms, walls, etc. It should be rather hard when the lightning is setting everything on fire near you all the time. &gt;:)	t5_2v1jr	True

It all went pretty good. I had tons of materials, but no food at all. I started starving. I came across a tombstone but I had not made an shovel yet and I had no idea what it kept.
I made a campfire for the night and finally made a shovel. Suddenly my health started decreasing and I lasted with just one seed. I gotta say that it saved my life because when the morning came I didn't have any plan at all so I ran out in the wild hoping for a miracle. I went to the tombstone and desperately digged it. I was wearing my backpack what came from the ground was an ""Amulet"". I had no idea what the item did but as the last seconds of my life were running out I put it on. I died.
I thought it was over in just that second. But my mind was blown up when the amulet I just put on in that VERY second I died, brought me back to life.
That has probably been one of the most intense gaming experiences for me. Ever.

I am loving this game! I can't wait to get on with my first playthrough now that I am still alive!

Unchanged  
  
**Willow**  
Positives:  
  
* Gets a sanity bonus near fire
* Impervious to fire / heat damage (this is not too useful now, but wait for lava caves...)
* [Gets a lighter](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=9029&amp;d=1371076630) - Can light things on fire, and be used like a torch. Has infinite fuel, but a very small light radius.  
  
Negatives:  
  
* Lower default sanity
* Lights random fires when low on sanity  
  
**WX-78**  
Positives:  
  
* Can eat spoiled food with no penalty (as before)
* Can eat gears to boost max stats (Hunger 100 -&gt; 200, Health 100 -&gt; 400, Sanity 100 -&gt; 300). It takes 15 gears to fully upgrade yourself (they carry over between teleportates). (specific numbers subject to change, of course!)  
  
Negatives:  
  
* Sparks in the rain, causing damage (and flashes of light)  
  
Lightning:  
  
* If you are not near a lightning rod, and you are not using an umbrella, any lightning that happens will hit you and cause a SYSTEM OVERLOAD
* Lighting that hits you will catch your surroundings on fire.
* Lighting strikes heal you, and hurt your sanity
* While the overload lasts, you will glow in the dark, and run faster
* Overload currently lasts 4-8 minutes per lighting strike (again, pending tuning)  
  
**Wes**  

Negatives:  
  
* Doesn't talk (less feedback)
* Stat penalties (as before)  
  
Positives:  
  
* Has an unlimited store of balloons in his pocket. He can blow them up to make balloon animals (probably to a max number at once). They are pretty, and monsters might attack them.

Wendy, having lost a sister (a female friend), says she feels a strange kinship with him because they have had a similar loss in their lives.

Tallest treeguard spawns, my army is decimated. Takes half the day to kill. And then it gets worse. I walked to Mactusk to find he wasn't there, and went down to find a Spider Queen that spawned, and I thought it killed Mactusk. I kill this over the dusk. Night comes along, and the treeguard is aggro'd to me again. 

I make a campfire. And then hounds. I'd went insane because of the insanity auras of the queen+tree so three shadow hands were trying to put my camp out. After running in circles for the longest night of the year, day comes. And then  Mac-Fucking-Tusk charges at me and I retreat to my base.

1367230038.0	1dbvkx	WX-78 is possibly a human	Zaner-Boy	59	15	25	"So I went to check something on the Wiki and someone brought this up.

""WX-78 is a person trapped in a metal suit.

People put him there, maybe people that he trusted. Everyone and everything he knew just betrayed him by locking him in that suit.

Your empathy would disappear, too.

After many years of being locked in the metal prison, he kind of snapped and his mind began to trick itself into believing that he was, in fact, a robot. That's why he speaks and acts like he does.



Conslusion: WX-78 is indeed human. [The skull found in the deep system files proves this](http://images.wikia.com/dont-starve-game/images/6/63/WX78%27s_Skull.png), and my explanation provides a reason for everything.

There you have it. WX-78 is a human. This explains his sanity better than the corrupted coding bit, as well as his not shortcircuiting in rain or smoking when he dies. If WX78 were not human, how could he chew meat like he does? If his stomach were really a chemical processor, he wouldn't need to chew.""

So what do you guys think?"	t5_2v1jr	True
1366685782.0	1cwt6r	The story of my last playthrough and the Beefalo	spellsy	45	2	11	"Hello, I know to experienced players this may not seem that amazing, but I just wanted to share the story of my last playthrough experience, where I got the farthest I've ever got. 

The round started normal, I had gotten to about day 10 or so and started my base camp up near some beefalo like I typically do to make farms and fertilize my plants. However, suddenly the Beefalo started getting mad at me and had red butts, I did not know what this meant but since they had been so loyal with their poop and they defended me against these demon hounds, I wanted to somehow heal their butts. After searching for a possible remedy in the recipes I found this magic flute that I thought could soothe them. I had all the materials except for a mandrake, and while I had seen and gotten these before I did not know where to look. I set off on an adventure to find a mandrake and cure the red butts, I spent several days away from my base camp to try and find a mandrake, scouring my entire map from swamps to forests. I was unsuccessful, I failed my friendly beefalo :(, so I returned to camp. However, when I returned I discovered a new member to our family that I had never seen before - the baby beefalo! Maybe this was why they were so angry! Either way I adored him, always looked for him whenever I returned to camp to see how big he had grown. 

Over the next 10-15 days or so I returned to normal, trying to gather materials and build cool things. I had seen the baby beefalo grow up to be a full adult beefalo! Then I reached day 22, winter had come. This was my first time ever experiencing winter. I was horribly unprepared. My farms were not producing anymore crops and the days were so short and the snow slowed me down so much that whenever I would find berries they would only get me through the night. 

So, there I was in the night of the 25th day, with my stomach wrinkled up and no food in sight. I did the unspeakable. I had my own little sustainable forest set up to harvest wood, and tonight the beefalo all slept together in the forest. Desperate, low on health and food, I lit the forest on fire. It burned so bright that it seemed like it was already day; however, when the fire subsided there was only burned trees, ashes, and meat. I rushed for the meat; however, in a spiral of emotions i ran right through fire finishing off my low health bar. It was karma. I still think about you, beefalo :(.

RIP Beefalo. RIP Wilson. "	t5_2v1jr	True
1366468821.0	1cqqd4	I feel like a monster...	SmugleafSnivy	48	3	13	"So I was camping with a bunch of Beefalo when I realized that I didn't have any Beefalo Wool. So obviously I shave them all, right? Well, before I can pick any of it up, my campfire spreads its flames to the wool, then to the Beefalo. I suddenly start to panic, running amok in the flames. I couldn't do anything as all of the Beefalo slowly died from the fire. There was only one survivor.

On the bright side, I now have 20 ashes, 24 meat, and 3 Beefalo Horns.

**/EDIT**

So, the awesome guys at Klei sent me an amazing popup Christmas card, which you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/dPv8I)

**Even better, it's a musical popup Don't starve themed Christmas Card.**

When you open it, the Don't Starve theme starts, but midway through it [some wild morse code appears!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8vmbordv362h06/Voice%20003.3ga)


Thing is, it doesn't make sense at all!


I was catching up with falpatricks LP and I noticed on his 24/dec video [that he got a card too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2vAD_s5--A&amp;list=UUvDnxcoHikAbH29_U_YbCAQ), but he doesn't mention anything about morse code. I though perhaps mine was the only one with a code in it, but then I read this comment on youtube...


&gt;DjC4

&gt;Did your card play audio? The one RipTide got had﻿ mores code in it, did yours? Can you post it? We're trying to figure out what it means!


...so that means there where, indeed, several codes spread around, and that we should put them all together.



Anyone knows who this **RipTide** guy is or how to contact him? I'm gonna message falpatrick and see if he can share his card with us.

""*This hotfix adds a world customization preset called ""Default Plus"". This preset is a more challenging version of default that gives you a couple of treasure chests full of low-level materials. It allows experienced players to hit the ground running, and skip the early ""collect rocks and twigs"" phase of a new game in favour of more mid-game challenges.*""

Version 76878 Changelist:

* Added ""Default Plus"" preset
* Fixed issue where death menu buttons could become unresponsive
* Gold-vein rocks always drop at least one gold
* Increased Nitre drop rate on nitre rocks

So, when you generate a new world, press ""customize world"" and press the arrow beside the ""Default Don't Starve Experience"" And it will change to a new world type!

But honestly, this game has given me some of the most fun I've had in quite some time. When I first saw this game, I didn't think much of it. But seeing it grow has been amazing, it's a completely new title, and it's still in beta. It has so much depth and yet it's such a simple idea. My money couldn't have been better spent elsewhere.

1362169384.0	19hdft	Preparing for winter adds challenge to the game, but winter itself is tedious.	AsskickMcGee	42	8	17	"The title pretty much sums it up. I just played through my first winter, and the *threat* of an impending cold season with long nights made those initial ""easy"" summer days nice and challenging, knowing I had to make good use of each long day to hoard resources and build up a camp.  

When winter hit, though, it was just boring. I had properly prepared a camp and hoarded food, and with nearby trees and plenty of boomerangs I had plenty of morsels from birds and wood to stock the fire. But my time spent actively playing the game was only ~1/4 of a day cycle, and I just surfed reddit during dusk/night with the game volume on in the background in case hounds or eyeclops showed up. I think that's a pretty pitiful way to ""play"" a video game.  

I think winter should be much shorter when compared to summer. I mean, either you're prepared or not. No need to spend 20-30 full days siting by a fire and eating from time to time.

Anyone else annoyed by the lack of bridges in the game? 


I feel like it might be a neat way to make floor material more useful/relevant (make wooden flooring not just for aesthetics, but also for function) and I feel as though it would be balanced. After all, every convenient route you make across the water is a convenient route that deerclops could also take. There's also potential, if Klei was feeling particularly devilish, to add some sort of sea monster that would have a small percent chance to attack you any time you were over water.

Yeah, whatever, I'm hard as nails me.  I equip my spike, my helmet and my log suit, and I whisper into the evening darkness, ""bring it"".

A mass of hounds pour through my base entrance and I bravely run around in circles taking pot shots until they are all dead.  If only I had noticed the red tint of the last hound to fall.

I could hear the spiders hissing all night long. Their nests where growing higher with each day. As I went to investigate the nesting grounds, one of the nests acsended into a Queen form before my very eyes! Fleeing with shivers down my back, I decided ""enough is enough"".

I grabbed the trayfull of stale frog legs from the ice box and dashed to the nearest pig village. Their friendship, as I've discovered earlier, is rather easy to buy. Not an hour later I was galloping back toward the spiders' den with six joyfull pigs at my back.

At first sight of the silky vermin the pigs charged forward with valor. I myself donned my Logsuit and jumped into the fray! Alas, the queen was nowhere to be found, but still, nest after nest we fought! The pigs, barbaric creatures, would smash in a spiders head and then devour its raw, bleeding remains whole. I couldn't watch! 

When the dust settled, only three pigs remained standing. Suddenly, one of them became aggitated, extremely hairy, and then started clawing wildly at me. My two companions fled the scene, shouting for home. Of course, the beast was no match for my skill with a pike.

Returning home, I discovered that the cowardly pigs had, in their carless flight, stumbled into a spider den we had missed earlier, and were quickly overun. Serves them right!

At the end of the day, my home is alot less spidery, has a new stock of pork, and a large patch of leather from the hairy beast. I think I'll make a helmet out of it.

Step 2: Change settings to 'always night'.

Step 3: Try to survive!

My first game, I got to day 4. The constant darkness brought the already slightly off the rocker Willow to complete insanity by the third day. Foraging for food by torchlight was difficult, so of course I chose to set the entire FOREST one fire, and search that way. That's a good idea, right?

By day 4 I was out of food, fighting off hallucinations, and had only a few meager supplies... but I had managed to build a crock pot, and was looking for a way to leverage that in some sort of permanent manner.

This is by far the most fun I've had with the game since I learned how to beat normal survival. Sanity is a constant worry, resources are scarce, and few regrow, especially food.

Some tips:

* Twigs and grass DO regrow, so farming them to keep your torches going will still work.
* The fires that Willow starts will sometimes catch things on fire, be careful early on!
* You can dig up bunnies for food, since they will fall asleep in total darkness and die easily.
* Birds never spawn, so neither do seeds. Farms only grow during the day anyway.

The next few updates will be more focused around Adventure mode, and they are working at getting a full-on narrative and plot for the game, which should be really cool.

It's gotten to the point where I'm not really mad or upset when I die honestly.  Which is weird.  I usually do NOT like permadeath games or overly punishing games.  I always thought this kind of thing would make me really upset.

Now I'm just sort of surprised (as I imagine many other people are) when I die.  You get so good at it that you think you're invincible, you forget you can die.  The cool thing is every time you die you say to yourself ""well I won't do that again"" and you're better for it.  You will survive THAT much longer.  Dying is actually a really important and constructive way to teach you the game.

1368049957.0	1dyk3i	Tip: Best Way to Hunt Pigs	Keebix	32	4	15	"I got this from the wiki, but it works a charm.

You will need:

* 4 monster meat
* A spear or tentacle spike
* 2 free slots in your inventory (for drops)

Step 1) Feed a pig 1 monster meat.

Step 2) (optional) hang out close to the pig to regain some sanity if you need it.

Step 3) lure your pig away from other pigs if they are nearby.

Step 4) Feed the pig three more monster meat. This will prompt it to turn into a werewolf.

Step 5) **As the pig is transforming,** wail on it with your weapon. The transformation animation is long enough for you to easily kill the werewolf. 

Step 6) Gather the loot. They drop 2 meats and 1 pig skin.

This technique is good for a lot of reasons.

* Very easy to kill
* Doesn't contribute to your ""naughtiness"" 
* Consistent drops of both meat and pig skin, which is a good trade-off for 4 monster meats. 

Just beware, because if you do it too close to regular pigs, they may attack you which could end up with you having a werewolf and army of pigs to deal with."	t5_2v1jr	True

1367350587.0	1dfisu	How to turn all that awful Monster Meat into something you can survive on	AustralianWinter	31	2	12	"Monster Meat is bound to be something you'll have too much of, if you're the sort of adventurous go-getter who likes to live on the edge (of a few Spider Dens). And taking a bite out of the stuff, be it cooked, jerkied or lasagna-ified will soon lead to you hurting for health and sanity, but there's a damn good way to get around this to keep yourself fed, sane and even healthy!

First of all, jerky all of your Monster Meat. Turning it into Monster Jerky turns it's time-to-rot up from 6 days to 20-- and you can actually trade it to a Pig King for 1 Gold Nugget if you HAVE to get rid of it. Putting it into an Icebox will make it save for 40 days even! Best of all, Monster Jerky still counts as Monster Meat in Crockpot Recipes.

Next up, acquire some Honey. Bees take a little finagling to get and require a decent amount of Silk for the Bug Net and Beekeeper's Hat, but once you nab those you're well on your way to building your own Bee Boxes. Once you have a few, harvest lots of Honey. The stuff keeps for 40 days on its own and 80 when in an Icebox.

Build a few Crockpots. 2 Is good, 4 is better, but it's really up to you. Stick 1 Monster Jerky into them alongside 3 Honey and within 40 seconds you will have a safe, delicious and healthy serving of Honey Nuggets. They'll give you 20 health, 37 Hunger and 5 Sanity. They last 15 days and you can get a BUNCH of them, very easily, if you have access to Monster Meat and Honey. I've made it to day 120 with it alone, survived 3 Winters because of it, and swear by it as a damn good meal."	t5_2v1jr	True

It is a boomerang that calls down lightning from the heavens on all burnable targets within a certain radius of the target (the lightning is kind of hard to see in the picture since it happens so fast but it looks great in game). Spiders are also considered burnable, haha. In the second picture there is one spider that isn't on fire and that is because he was hiding in his nest when the picture was taken. If you lure the spiders out the nest first and then use the boomerang all spiders on screen are struck with lightning."	t5_2v1jr	True

From what I can tell, you cant freeze while its warm if you have a Winter Hat on. No idea about it without a hat. You can have it in your inventory and stand by a fire, and that will also warm it up. If its warm and in your inventory, then you'll have a small amount of light surrounding you at night, not enough to see, but enough to not get attacked.

2. The Spider Gland can be used by itself as healing. It heals 8 health when used. If you combine it with 2 ashes and a rock, you get Healing Salve. It heals 20 health.

3. The Lightning Rod, when struck, will provide free light and warmth for a few days. Its easy to craft, since all it needs is 3 gold and cut stone.

And a side note: Picking up a backpack will instantly equip it. You cant carry backpacks in your hands at all anymore.

1372878525.0	1hl2ie	Thoughts on Science Machine Recipe	malacor17	27	2	18	"I've found that when starting new games, one of the most frustrating thing is being unable to locate a golden nugget. And without a golden nugget I can't build a science machine and prototype essentials like a shovel, chests, and crockpot. 

However, once I do located an area with golden rocks I can usually mass enough nuggets to build not only a science machine but an alchemy engine as well. 

Now what if the science machine required 1 nitre instead of a golden nugget? Nitre drops off of every regular boulder at 40% which means I usually have a few at the end of my first day. I think this would allow players to set up a base a little sooner and spend time in tier one instead of jumping straight to tier two.

I don't think it would affect the balance of Wickerbottom too much as the change would allow her to put off searching for golden nuggets for a much longer time.

I'd be interested to hear what you guys think. Do you think it would make the early game too easy? I rather have the option to set up a early camp if I'm having bad luck exploring. I've had games where it took me 7 days to find one. 

Have you found that you normally skip the first tier? Or do you have games where you get a couple gold nuggets before you get enough for the alchemy engine? "	t5_2v1jr	True

Maple trees would be able to be tapped for sap, and 4 of these sap would be put into a crockpot for maple syrup, an excellent health food. It would also fit with Woodie's canadian theme :)

You could use a razor on a fully grown birch tree for birch bark, an excellent fuel, and could be used on signs so you can write on them.

The existing pine trees would drop needles upon harvesting, and could be put into a crockpot for pine tea.

A tropical biome could be added along some shorelines with palm trees, which can drop coconuts.

1366808488.0	1d08td	Storytime	BillyMays3	29	4	6	I was playing as Wendy (she has terrible perks which is why I play as her) and I was on day 42.  Decide to take on some tentacles so that I could get the tentacle spike.  My gear breaks, I get one tentacle spot, and I almost die.  So the next day I heal up, recruit a pigman and try again.  We manage to kill two tentacles before he dies and I'm almost dead, but I got the tentacle spike and another spot.  Start making my way home.  The hounds are baying.  I have no health and it's getting late so I try to gey back to camp.  On my way back however I manage to get too close to some spiders and they follow me.  They came.  It started off small with one hound (which I managed to kill) bit the second one got me.  As I lay there the two hounds on screen began attacking the spiders.  I respawned at a touchstone beginning day 44.  I made a garland so I could get my sanity back up. Decide at that moment that I will swoop in and grab tentacle spike so that I can kill the remaining fiends.  So I approach the site and was greeted by six hounds on top of my gear (one ice hound and one fiery hound).  Instantly killed.  Respawn at my last touchstone and formulate a plan.  I headed back to base to grab some monster meat and recruited two pigmen.  We made our advance from the south and engaged the hounds.  The beasts ignored me and the battle began.  In the confusion I grabbed all of my gear and equipped my armor and tentacle spike.  I returned to help my friends fight the hounds but thwre was no-one around, only monster meat.  I grieved the loss of my friends and returned home to Chester (who had respawned).  As I was cooking up dinner and planting some crops a strange figure came into view.  It was the fiery hound.  He had eaten my friends, and was back for vengeance.  He attacked Chester.  I charged him, tentacle spike in hand, and slayed the beast, sending flames erupting from his corpse.  I survived the night and now I'm on day 46.  RIP my pig comrades.	t5_2v1jr	True

Most all of my play time has gone onto one game save. Recently when they came out with the progress update and the walls, I was happy because I now had a way to protect all of the farming materials I had gathered (About twenty plots, all of the bushes in the world, saplings, and grass). When the update occurred all of the walls were reset to their shortest height. I was a little distraught, but I had some saved in chests in case they needed repairs. After using almost all of the walls, I finally had everything back to the way it was before the update. As soon as I finished the hounds attacked, and in came a fire hound. 

Everything burned in seconds, and I just took my hands off the keyboard blinded by rage. I survived 276 days.

1375333460.0	1jh438	For those worried about Krampus, I did some tests.	EmergencyTaco	26	5	16	"I did some tests as to how long it would take to deliberately summon Krampus, and to do this I systematically murdered rabbits every couple of minutes from the start of the game until he spawned.  

Krampus spawned after 60+ bunny kills without me leaving any time for my naughtiness level to decrease. He managed to pick up a total of three items that were lying on the ground before I was able to chase him down and kill him. He took 6% of a tentacle spike to kill and hit me twice before I dropped him, doing about 45 damage without any armor on. Also, for a LONG time before he spawns you will hear a gust of wind after doing a naughty task that gets periodically louder until he spawns.

I performed this test because I was:  
1. Bored  
2. Scared shitless during my last winter because I thought I was killing too many innocent creatures to survive, and I didn't want him spawning at day 100+.  

My consensus on this matter is this: Krampus doesn't even lift, and unless you are a brutal, rabbit-killing warlord of the outdoors he will probably not spawn. If he does, run him down and punch him until he falls over, he's not to be feared.

I realized that I could ""carry"" around structures before or during travel and save space in my inventory, or ""prebuild"" structures to have ready when I wanted them.

""Could the legends be true?"" I wondered. Next, there were piles of loot where once there were pengull tribes. ""huh, maybe they just keel over dead after a while."" Finally, I saw that the snow was melting. ""Welp, guess all of my winter troubles are over!"" Then Wilson's line which I knew to be significant: *That sounded big.* Shit.

I was close to my base and so he must have been too. I couldn't let him kill my nearby beefalo (but he was welcome to the pengulls. screw them)! So I went back to chopping my small personal forest but this time with a new mission. *Chop Chop Fall* nothing. *Chop Chop Fall* nothing. *Chop Chop* We got a live one here! I've summoned a monster to fight a monster. This is some Pacific Rim shit right here.

Now the issue is to get these two lovebirds together. I head toward my beefalo and sure enough find ol Clopsy about to take a swing at them but I run into his range and he turns his sights on me. I bring him back to the Ent (much faster than the other way around, you know) and run circles around the two of them (thank you, baby jesus, for this walking stick which you have bestowed upon me) until they engage. Then I sit back and watch, taking only [one screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/yEXuFTT.jpg).

The Deerclops won then continued his way toward my camp. I was lucky that he stopped to knock down a pig house before reaching my boundary proper. As he continued, I whipped the boomerang at him in order to aggro before he got there (that bastard is a good deal faster than I thought he'd be). He turned around, I donned my logsuit, and the newly displaced pig and I landed one hit each: enough to finish what the Ent started.

I just encountered Deerclops for the first ever time - I've been playing Don't Starve since the start of the year and this is the first time I've ever seen him. I began to think he was just astronomically rare and that I'd never encounter him, but he appeared today. I was REALLY unprepared and thought I was going to die, but the big old dummy decided to walk right into my panic room (I wasn't even in there at the time). He set off all 30 tooth traps and drained his health right down, so I only had to hit him with the spear a few times and he died! I'm so happy!	t5_2v1jr	True

I really need help filling in the last gaps in my idea.

Here's what I have so far:

Black (Maxwell's side):
King - Maxwell (Duh).
Queen - Spider Queen.
King's Bishop - Mechanical Bishop.
King's Knight - Mechanical Knight.
King's Rook - Obelisk.
Queen's Bishop - Tallbird.
Queen's Knight - Hound.
Queen's Rook - Treeguard.
Pawns - Spiders.

White (Wilson's Side):
King - Wilson. 
Queen - Wendy.
King's Bishop - Science Machine.
King's Knight - Chester.
King's Rook - Pighouse.
Queen's Bishop - Teenbird.
Queen's Knight - Beefalo!
Queen's Rook - ???
Pawns - Pigs!

So, what do you think?

Edit: Beefalo, how could I have missed that?

Edit 2: Just got back from the workshop, made [this](http://imgur.com/SQ320cz).
This is the start for the Obelisk and the Tallbird. Pieces will be 3x4.5x9 cm so it's gonna be a big board!
This might take awhile because I don't have access to the workshop all the time.

The problem is, they keep coming before I can set up reliable defenses. I get maybe half my walls done, or it's dark so I can't run to a nearby pig village / bee hive / lureplant.

I have tried turning them on ""less"", yet they still come on day 6 or 7 without fail, and destroy my everything.

I see other dapper gentlemen posting their panic rooms in this subreddit, long stone hallways with tons of tooth traps. However, I don't see a way to *get* these tooth traps without first killing hounds, and if the first pack has more than 3 hounds in it, it annihilates me.

I'd like to develop a more mobile playstyle at the least.
 
If you're familiar with Civ think of an ICS approach.

Relatively new to the game though so I don't know just how possible this'd be or how to best go about it. I assume you'd want the science lady to cut down on the amount of science structures which are expensive material wise early on.

After the a few days you start to be really good a farming things, you farm grass, twig and berries at first then you discover how to get honey, meat and gold. You start to realize that this game is really interesting because is not only about survive the longest time but is about having fun while you do it. 

After the day 50 you feel really great because you have reach your goal and you decide you are gonna make into the 100 days. Now you have farms, crock pots, a whole pig village to work for you ans chest full of everything.

After a while you are just farming everything you can and you realize that the whole map is already explored, there is nowhere else to go, you realize you are alone, you are farming just for you, you are very rich material wise, but you have no one to share it.

You have chests full of food, full of gold, full of wood, grass, twigs, weapons, armor, insects, tools. You have everything, you have every hat that you can use in the game , you already kill a lot of creatures, ents, pigs, werepigs, beefalos, bees, jackalopes, spiders, swamp monters. You have done everything.

You reach your 100 goal and you realize that you have nothing else to do, then ideas of suicide start to get into your head, *it would be easier to play a new map, you will have a new character, you reached your goal there is nothing to prove, you have nothing to prove to anyone*.

Finally you decide, you are gonna do it, you get all of your pinecones and you start to plant them all over your base... every little corner. You go to the pig village and bring every pig in town with you, they have no idea, they don't know you are insane, you are not that great little guy that feed them before anymore. You craft a torch, they see you, they said ""you friend you good"" they have no idea. Finally you start to run like a crazy man, igniting everything in your pass with your torch, all of your work is burning, everything, the pigs are scared, they don't know what is happening you are on fire, your hp is reaching the 30 points, it reaches the 10 points, you see everything you have done and for one moment you regret what you have just done....

**Wilson:** Unchanged.

**Willow:** 

Positives:

* Gets a sanity bonus from being near fire
* Impervious to fire / heat damage (this is not too useful now, but wait for lava caves...)
* Gets a lighter - Can light things on fire, and be used like a torch. Has infinite fuel, but a very small light radius.


Negatives:

   
* Lower max sanity
* Lights random fires when low on sanity (like the night ones currently)

**WX-78:**

Positives:


* Can eat spoiled food with no penalty (as before)
* Can eat gears to boost max stats (Hunger 100 -&gt; 200, Health 100 -&gt; 400, Sanity 100 -&gt; 300). It takes 15 gears to fully upgrade yourself (they carry over between teleportates). (specific numbers subject to change, of course!)



Negatives:


* Sparks in the rain, causing damage (and flashes of light)



Lightning:


* If you are not near a lightning rod, and you are not using an umbrella, any lightning that happens will hit you and cause a SYSTEM OVERLOAD

* Lighting that hits you will catch your surroundings on fire.
* Lighting strikes heal you, and hurt your sanity
* While the overload lasts, you will glow in the dark, and run faster
* Overload currently lasts 4-8 minutes per lighting strike (again, pending tuning)


**Wes:**


Negatives:

    
* Doesn't talk (less feedback)
* Stat penalties (as before)



Positives:

    

* Has an unlimited store of balloons in his pocket. He can blow them up to make balloon animals, for a small sanity cost. They are pretty, you can push them around, and monsters might attack them. Popping balloons cause nearby balloons to pop.



**Wolfgang:**


Positives:

    
* Larger stomach capacity



Negatives:

    
* Faster sanity drain in darkness and near monsters



Mightiness:

    
* The more full his stomach is, the more health he has and the harder he hits. If it is low, however, there are negative penalties. Calories burn faster with increased mightiness. The current mightiness level is reflected in the the character art.


**Wendy:** 


Positives:

   
* Less sanity drain from night and monsters



Negative:

    
* Lower combat damage



Abigail:

    
* Wendy spawns with ""Abigail's flower"" in her inventory. After a cooldown period has expired, can place it on the ground. If something dies near it at that point, Abigail will spawn and wear the flower in her hair.
    
* The spawning takes some sanity.
* Abigail will follow you and protect you from threats / attack your targets until she falls in combat or you attack her.
* Abigail moves fast enough to keep up with you.
* Abigail will get along with other 'pets', and doesn't damage Wendy.
    Abigail causes more damage during the night than during the day.
* Abigail slowly regenerates health, and has a higher max than she used to.
* Abigail drops the flower when she de-spawns, so that you can pick it up again


**Wickerbottom:**


Positive:


* Gets a bonus tech level
* Has a higher max sanity
* Starts with some papyrus



Negative:

    
* Insomniac - can't sleep at night
* Picky eater - higher penalties for eating spoiled food



Books:


* Has a unique crafting tab and create several consumable books (reading them costs some sanity):


    
* Birds of the World - call down a flock of birds
* Applied Horticulture - Makes nearby pickables, trees, and crops grow
* Bedtime Stories - puts everyone around you to sleep for a while
* Conflagration - Calls down a cluster of lighting.
* On Tentacles - Summons some tentacles from the deep.

I just died on day 31 in the heart of winter. I was at a pig village about 3 minutes from my base. We were destorying spider nest and ofcourse, the sun goes down. ""Uh oh, better make a fire"" I pull out the map to see where the nearest grass is... 2 minute walk. Okay, I start walking when I get the first stage of freezing. I pull out the one torch that **I ALWAYS HAVE ON ME** and continue running. I get to the grass, pull up 3 pieces and go to make a fire when I don't have any logs. Right this moment, it gets dark. Unsure of whether or not I can chop wood in the dark, and with 50% torch left and another minute long run, I decide to just high tail to my base. I get 2nd stage freezing 2 seconds later. Then 3rd stage. I pull out a healing poultice that I always have on me and heal myself, then I use 2 spider glands. I get to the entrance of my base with no less than 20 health left. I run to light the fire I use when under attack, and my torch runs out... 2 ft from my fire pit. Complete darkness.

The first time I saw Krampus when I killed a few rabbits and a Beefalo and he came running towards me, stealing all the meat and beefalo hair. I chased him for a while but then he jumped in his bag and disappeared.

The second time I had killed a lot of rabbits, 2 beefalos, a lot of birds and pigmen before he spawned. Unfortunately I was in my camp so he tried to steal all my equipment. I killed him while he was looting pne of my chests and he dropped everything he stole + 1 Charcoal &amp; 1 Monster Meat. I was playing as Wolfgang and wielding a Spike Tentacle, he went down in 2-3 hits. http://imgur.com/qo8LG

Hey guys! This run is still going strong. My goals are to finish off research and face the Spider Queen and Krumpus. 

Some tips for making a little further: 

**-Spend your first few days roaming and collecting.** 
Setting up a base can be done once you have sufficient supplies. I found that roaming the grassland and picking up as much grass, twigs, berries, carrots, and doing some mining when you can on rocks you come across.

**-Once you are ready to set up camp, set up tree farm and science machine.**
You will need to go science crazy on your first playthrough to unlock things. I would highly advise aiming for the Spear, Log Suit, and Football Helmet. The tree farm will give you something to do at night (clear-cut and replant), and that wood will fuel a lot of other objectives.

**-Catch a bird, build a cage, get agricultural.**
I would work on getting a bird cage (need to head to the swamp for the reeds), and you will be able to use a captured bird to turn fruit that you grow on your farm plots into seeds of that fruit. There is a chance to get multiple seeds from a single fruit. I focused on pumpkins; they fill you up faster than any other non-crock pot food item for hunger.

**-Catch bees and build a few bee boxes.** Honey is an amazing counterpart to pumpkins as a stackable health consumable. Throw on your logging suit, a bee keepers mask, and take down two or three hives. Use a bug net to catches the bees that are roaming around during their roaming time first though! Construct the bees a little distance away from your camp so they don't follow you back to your main area should you anger them. And plant some flowers for the little guys, they need it. 

**-Grow a manly beard, and shed mortality.** By the time I got all of the above done, I had hit my sixteenth night and had hairs. Making a run to your nearest pig village or beefalo area should net you the meat you need. I would advise beefalo, as one can be pulled from the heard and kited, with a much higher yield of the meat you need.

After this, branch out into the other areas of the game an secure your place in the world. Have fun and don't starve!

Starting off with A Cold Reception, I gathered some resources, minded my sanity, and explored a bit. Then I realized... There wasn't any flint. None. Nada. Not around anywhere. [A world without flint.](http://i.imgur.com/zQEirRf.png) Just that one flint I had to make an axe. I got scared. Then my priority was to explore to find flint.

I searched high and low. There was tons of rocks laying about, but no flint. At the same time I searched for the things. It looked like I had to cross a pig guardian bridge for everything. I found a pig village, beefalo, even 3 of the things! and this time I really needed that axe and spear left beside the things. At this point, I did attempt to make a base in between all the good stuff, but I didn't think of anything the science machine could help me with. (I still built one though, found some gold by the graves.)

Day 6, it was getting cold, but I continued my searched. My supply of carrots were running out (I don't think there were any berries either.) Then I came across a spider bridge, thought I'd burn it by some trees and lighting them on fire, but I had to be wary about the cold. Took a couple of days to finally get the job done. During that time I was out of food, starving, going insane, [trying to get killer bees to attack the spiders.](http://i.imgur.com/6gWuvJA.png) Got some honey out of it, but it wasn't gonna fill me up. I finally cross the bridge, hoping for good stuff. I think winter ended somewhere around here.

But then I had to cross another bridge, a hound bridge. Though intimidating, [I got through it easily.](http://i.imgur.com/FPJf738.png) And there was the wooden thing. I quickly assembled it with the things I had, but still needed the last thing. The potato thing. I hated that thing, it seems like the last thing I ever find. (Last run took me 100+ days to find) Had to go through the hound bridge again, but I was so glad the last thing was nearby, I just had to get through the night. Starving, but I had my just in case monster meat, but that might put me over the edge. Then rain, the special kind. Glorious frogs falling from the sky. It was just enough to get me through the search.

Attached the final thing. At this point I didn't care what I was bringing through, I just wanted to get out of there. It ended so quickly, I forgot to see what the last day was, but surely it had to be under 20 days. That's a huge record for me. So nerve racking, at any moment I could've died, but despite the odds I did it! What an experience that was for me. Sorry if it wasn't interesting to read (or if some things didn't make sense), I'm not very good at writing out things, I am just so amazed and happy I got through.

However, I think it would be really cool if you could send ""packages"" to Steam friends or just random strangers.  

Imagine if you could take any item and, say, bury it in a grave you've dug up. And you can write a little note and address it to either a Steam friend or a stranger. Maybe you could even get a sanity bonus for being so altruistic.  

Then, when someone digs up a random grave in their game, they get the message by reading the tombstone and a package from another player. The package might be a backpack full of honey ham, a single piece of rot, or an armed bee mine (mines and traps could be armable, heh). It all depends on if the sender is an experienced player trying to spread the wealth, a cheapskate taking advantage of the sanity boost, or an asshole.  

I don't think this would be considered ""multiplayer"", just an interesting way for the player-base to interact.

Check it out: http://www.skillshare.com/Beginning-Infographics-Information-Driven-Storytelling/1880133038/projects/14803

I'll be posting all visual updates there, please feel free to critique as it'll only make the poster better :) 

AND, if you haven't already please take the survey! Some of these are  It'll stay open as long as possible: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Z8PCJPM

**UPDATE**

Good news everyone! ( Well..Kinda, hahah ) I've reached my limit with Survey Monkey (it caps at 100 responses per survey) and though I initially wanted to stop at 100 I can't help but feel that the poster would benefit from the accuracy of the survey results. 

So I've decided to upgrade my SurveyMonkey account once the survey reaches 250 results. I'm constantly surprised every time I check the survey to see more and more people are taking the survey! I'm already working on the layout for the info graphic and I'll post an update later. In the mean time, I really want this project to be a success. If you could share the survey with friends who play, and others who are interested in the game ( tumblr, klei forums, steam forums, twitter and facebook ) I would really appreciate it! 

------
Inspired by an info graphic poster for Animal Crossing: New Leaf floating around somewhere on Tumblr, I thought I'd try my hand at making one for Don't Starve. 

In info graphic poster starts with info first, so I'm asking the Tumblr/Reddit/Don't Starve community to help out with that! 

I've made a survey here: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Z8PCJPM

Any other questions or things you'd like to see in the poster are definitely welcome!

* Giving pigs meat makes them help you! This includes mining and chopping down trees, as well as hunting tentacles, treeguards and spider queens!

* Farms will *not* help you survive winter. Get a berry plantation as a higher priority than farms, as these beauties will sustain you via meatballs all through the winter.

* One level three spider nest will match around ~4-6 pig houses in power. If you want continual farming of arachnids without all your pigs dying, either destroy a nest once it gets to level 3, or have a vast excess of pigmen to spiders!

* Fighting hounds is for suckers! Since monster meat is abundant, just bring them to your spider farm, and your little arachnid friends will rip the puppies to shreds, and save your traps for deerclops and Krampus.

* The more twigs, the better. Eventually, these will be your main food source for dragon pies, and if living in a plains biome, you now have unlimited twigs and grass for all your basic needs.

* Living near a road is handy for finding your way home, but do get familiar with your map by pressing the tab key! Some of us unlocked Winterbottom before learning about that thing.

* The only thing worth farming is dragonfruit, for dragon pies. These, along with meatballs and jerky, are among the best food items in the game hunger/health versus resource wise.

* Spoiled food? Don't throw it out! Using **CTRL-Click!**, you can split a stack into two, and then down to single pieces, dropping each one and burning it. This is the best way to obtain ash in the game without destroying massive supplies of natural resources.

* Mandrakes don't have to die for you to survive. These adorable little creatures can be picked at dusk and will accompany you till dawn as the only creature cuter than Chester in the game. Defend your little green friends with a wall, however, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than losing all but one to a vicious gobbler attack. 

* Keep track of a dirt pile nearby until the start of winter, and have all your cobwebs and beefalo wool ready. When you first see snowbirds, go out and hunt the first winter koalefant  to save on resources and get a puffy vest. This, along with a beard, can buy you around ~4 minutes of anti-freezing time. 

* Lastly, Wilson. While the others are good (not having to build a shadow manipulator makes the game a LOT easier with Wickerbottom, and the extra health of Wolfgang makes him almost unkillable by conventional enemies) Wilson's charming pessimism and extra challenge to playing the game naturally really puts him up a few notches, plus he has such a charming instrumental voice. Did I mention that he is **immortal**? Oh yeah. Once you start to accumulate beard hair and make it past day 16 for your first two-effigy-shave, you're *pretty much a god.*"	t5_2v1jr	True

So I built a big stockade fence around one end of the wormhole,  and started moving crops in there, building my science machine, alchemy engine, crock pot, and ice box. 

Of course, I wanted to make sure there was enough space inside the fence to hold all the things I needed, so I made it pretty big (24x24). And it takes *a lot* of wood to build that many fences, so I spent a lot of time harvesting trees, instead of, say, building up a reliable food supply.

I neglected my sanity, and got killed by a hallucination. No big deal, though - I had used a touchstone, and my impregnable fortress was *nearly* complete. Just a few more fences to complete, and I'd be totally safe.

I was camping away from my base because I heard a deerclops spawn. Naturally I camp next to the beefalo herd.

And I have no idea how long I'm going to sit here and wait for the deerclops. Well I made my fire RIGHT next to the sleeping buffalo... I craft a razor and get to shaving. I get 3 beefalo shaved before I realize that the fire is spreading to their wool I just shaved off, all of the sudden the 3 beefalo I shaved catch on fire and promptly die, dropping a HUUUUUGE amount of meat. I didn't get any aggro, it didn't even wake the other sleeping beefalo. 

To make a long story short: make a blazing campfire right next to the sleeping beefalo. Shave off their wool starting with the closest and work your way out however many you want to die. Boom, instant death, lots of meat, and all you had to do was make a fire and bring a razor..."	t5_2v1jr	True

Unfortunately, I can't get to any of this because I can't survive past day 13 at most. I usually croak either by stupid mistakes (accidentally attacking a beefalo, etc) or by trying to do combat with anything.

Playing the start of the game over and over and over again is really boring. Is there any advice or tips you can give me so I can maybe survive past 13 days?

**EDIT**: Thank you! Following your instructions I managed to get 10 days in. However, I didn't know about beefalos having mating season and was promptly killed by my farm animals on my tenth day. Still, I feel like I have much more of a chance now. Thank you all again!

[Poor composite of my camp](http://i.imgur.com/aRt8m.jpg)

This was like my 4th go at the game or something and I had ironed out most of the nuances of the game to make it super simple. There were three factors in me committing suicide.

Firstly, my tallbirds died on me and I had only managed to get 4 eggs. The last one died after chasing me around for about two days straight. I had to get back to camp and that was through a swamp. Epic battle between the tallbird, some beefalo, tentacle spikes, and spiders ensued.

Secondly, I hadn't unlocked Wolfgang yet and needed to die to do so. I have no idea how much xp I got at 210 as the game game a message stating that I had reached the xp cap at 5000.

Finally, it had just gotten too easy. I didn't show my nearby areas where I have a couple of bee boxes southwest of my base along with another fire pit close by where I would fight hounds at night in case a red one showed up. Chests full of everything, 3 effigies and enough mats for like 5 more, something like 5 amulets and 15 red gems with all kinds of meat for gold should I choose to get it.

I had cleared out a swamp of tentacles and had a chest full of new ones, mined every rock and destroyed every spider nest in the map (the ones to the right on the map are part of a small arena). There was really just nothing left to do.

Anyway, decided to kill myself and am contemplating starting a new world before hte next update. Not sure if there will be anything new introduced that would require a fresh world, so I'm considering just waiting.

I'm going to try and be even more efficient next time around and do everything in my power to keep the tallbirds alive."	t5_2v1jr	True

* New worldgen setting to toggle on and off cave entrances

**Caves**

* Walls have been replaced with chasms
* There are ornate chests and nightmare lights
* There is a cycle in the ruins, not spoiling too much, but be warned....
* The chests contain something called Thulecite, and some random gems and tools
* Earthquakes seem to sound more terrifying
* Certain statues provide light when you're near
* When hammered once, lightning strikes and in the wake are graveyard items
* When hammered twice, it explodes, dropping some thulecite, a spider, a Crawling Horror, and some nightmare fuel

I'm not going to spoil any more; that's for you to find out....

They're wonderful, and I love em. However, playing as Wilson, I've noticed some are missing, and some could be refined. I think that my suggestions and improvements would be easy changes. 

(This all comes from a Wilson point of view. Let me know about the other characters in the comments)

**Periods**

I've noticed that some quotes lack periods. This isn't too bad, but it would be an easy to fix problem.

Quotes that lack periods:

* Stone Walls (placed)
* Fire Pit (unlit)
* Spear
* Pitchfork
* Cobblestones (aslo each words is capitalized)
* Papyrus
* Compass Directions 
* Others, but I can't remember them all.

**Missing Quotes**

Some things lack quotes. Wilson just says ""It's a... thing.""

Items that lack voice lines:

* Dapper Vest
* Ice Staff (fire staff has a quote. . .)
* Blow Dart


**My Suggestions**

I think should items need their own, specific quips.

* Individual Quotes for some clothing items (Wilson just says ""What a nice hat"")
* Different Levels of beeboxes
* Individual crock pot recipes (some have their own, most don't)
* Proper quotes for feathers
* Mushtree stump
* Different spider ten tiers
* Turfs
* Traps, when something is inside

Also, when in movement, examining something shouldn't stop the player for a moment, and the noise should play.

2. Christmas tree, all you need for a Christmas tree, is 4 logs a pine cone, a berry bush and a red blue and purple gem, being around the Christmas tree restores sanity, and it gives of a small amount of light. i also thought it would be cool if after day 25 a Santa hat could be found under the tree (basically a warmer winter hat) the tree starts to wilt after 25 days

3. candles, like torches, but last a very long time and can be re light and placed on the ground, these would be made with bees wax and silk.

* ~~To cut trees with zero risk of a Tree Guardian spawning, only cut dead trees and then dig the twigs to get a log. It's about as efficient as normal logging because all dead trees fall in one hit.~~ EDIT: THIS DOESN'T WORK, TWO SPAWNED AT ONCE FROM NEARBY TREES, OH GOD HELP ME.

* When the hounds are about to attack stick near the beefalo, when the hounds come, run like hell. They'll eventually lose interest in you and attack the beefalo, which will easily kill them.

* To get meat, take three pigs and go attack a beefalo. Run like crazy away from the heard. You then have one beefalo to kill (fairly easy) and you can go back and pick up all the meat from the pig/beefalo carnage. 

* If you ever can, plant a spider's nest near the pig village, then every day you can go and attack the spider nest with the entire village of pigs to back you up. Warning, this also gives the pigs lots of monster meat to eat, which leads to werepigs...

* Don't bother too much with the crock pot, many of the recipes yield less food value than their ingredients.

* To easily hunt rabbits dig all the holes you can find during the day then run around with a torch at night and kill the rabbits that are then forced to sleep out in the open. (2 torches will last the whole night) This also means no more rabbits will spawn because the holes are gone, but this is a good method to use in an area you won't be going back to or in the very beginning just to stock up on meat.

* Don't be a hero.

1356100459.0	1587m3	Trapping Tips and Tricks	lamentz25	15	1	11	"Here are some things I've discovered that can help with trapping Rabbits (Jackalopes) early in the game effectively:

1. The most effective way to take down a rabbit is to wait until it's a fair distance from its hole, then attack it from the opposite side of the hole. Only use this tactic if you come across a lone rabbit and there are no other rabbits around. If there are, the screams of the first one dying will scare them all away.

2. Don't bait a trap because the net gain in food isn't worth the loss of a carrot (or whatever you use).

3. Drop traps near a rabbit (without scaring it) and then back up and drop a carrot so the trap is between the carrot and the rabbit. The rabbit should hop right into the trap as it goes for the carrot. Don't put the carrot too close to the trap or it will get eaten anyways.

These are just a few tips I thought I'd share. Please feel free to share your own or just critique mine, I'm open to constructive criticism."	t5_2v1jr	True

I'm a diehard fan of don't starve in more ways than one and it always made me wonder what some of the world customisation options meant- namely, the world branching and the-other-one-whatchamakallit. 

I'm kinda thinking the branching controls how many 'peninsula/islands/arms' from the central landmass you get while the other controls the connection of the lands via roads and worms. 

Am I correct in assuming so? If so, how does different combination work with each other? I'm really poor when it comes down to math so if someone, anyone could draw up a simple chart/diagram of the overview I would really appreciate it.

1372546508.0	1hc21l	[Discussion] Beefalo Hunting / Farming	omnirusted	13	1	16	"I've heard a lot of methods on the best way to hunt/farm Beefalo. After not seeing a thread for this on here, I thought it might be good to start a discussion on it to gather relevant data. I will also update this list with relevant facts and responses from people who have tried methods I have not.

* Hit one, run away until the rest stop chasing you, run back, smack it to death.

&gt; The **simplest** method. The problem I've found with this is that sometimes the other beefalo don't stop chasing you, and if they are scattered enough you can keep drawing more in, until you just run out of daylight.

* Plant trees/hay fences around a herd (possibly fenced in) and light it on fire when they have grown up enough

&gt; Pros: They won't attack you, due to the fire damaging them instead of a weapon. Cons: Due to the space required to be close enough to a burning tree / hay fence and do damage, as well as gathering them all in to one space, is highly difficult to pull off without a horn. Unreliable. Note: Putting items (grass, charcoal) under them and lighting it on fire will damage them, but not very much, and will take many tries to actually get a kill. It is better if they are fenced in.

* Shave, then light the hair on fire.

&gt; Confirmed by [u/Ch-Shire](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ch-shire) to work. They might have to be in a large size herd to get the right amount of hair though.

* Pig Army

&gt; Beefalo usually outnumber your pig men, and destroy them pretty quickly. Good way to gather meat from both sides I suppose, but only effective late game rather than early game. 4-5 seems to work.

* Tooth Trap Line (credit: [u/vectorscopexy](http://www.reddit.com/user/vectorscopexy)

&gt; Highly effective, if you have enough of them and can run Beefalo through a line of them (panic room / walled hallway). Traps do 60 damage each, so a line of 8 should kill off a Beefalo.

* Tooth Trap Placement (credit: [u/TeoSS69](http://www.reddit.com/user/TeoSS69))

&gt; The **safest** method. Place a tooth trap at a Beefalo's feet. It will go off and deal 60 damage. Pick it up, do it again until dead. Tooth traps [do not agro Beefalo](http://i.imgur.com/VJGIl9B.jpg).

* Spiders / Hounds

&gt; Not reliable that they will actually kill any beefalo. At day 100+, killed Fire Hounds flames will kill a few Beefalo (thanks [u/TeoSS69.](http://www.reddit.com/user/TeoSS69))

* Gunpowder

&gt; I haven't seen anyone else do this yet, but plan to do it myself to a herd of sleeping beefalo. The only problem I can see is that Gunpowder does 200 damage, while Beefalo have 500 hp. It might just injure them and make them easier to take down. However, Gunpowder does more damage when stacked, so a stack of 3 should be able to kill an entire herd. Further testing is required.

* Lureplants (credit: [u/Ch-Shire](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ch-shire))

&gt; Adult Beefalos do quite a bit of damage and can take some punishment, so hitting one and leading it through a field of Eyeplants will most likely result in the Lureplant getting killed. Beefalo HP: 500, damage 34, Lureplant HP: 500, Eyeplant HP: 30, damage: 20, would take 25 hits by Eyeplants to kill one adult Beefalo, where as Eyeplants die in one hit. Baby Beefalo however will run away from the player, and thus can be 'herded' in to a field of Eyeplants which it will not retaliate against, and will only need 15 hits before it dies (Only [3 morsel, one fur](http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Baby_Beefalo) per kill though)."	t5_2v1jr	True
1372387915.0	1h82e1	[Spoilers/Discussion] So let's have a bit of a talk about our new character!	georgebullis	16	1	13	"Let's talk about what we know about our new friend [Woodie](/spoiler). 

He starts out with 150 health, 200 sanity and 150 hunger.

Next, a list of his pros and cons (that we know of)

* Starts with Lucy the axe, which has infinite durability
* He can cut trees at an accelerated rate
* Cutting trees too quickly will cause his curse to manifest
* His curse is a gift in many ways, as his were-beaver form allows him to cut trees, dig graves, mine boulders, uproot plants, destroy pig houses, regenerate beaver-health using the new ""Wood Meter""
* You can see very well at night in were-beaver form
* You cannot look at your map while in were-beaver form (at first I could but it seems now that you can't open the map)
* You can't pick anything up, only eat or gnaw it (gravedigger items go straight to the inventory, but this is undoubtedly a glitch. Going to the main menu and resuming the game will cause your inventory to be re-ejected from you)
* All it takes to return to his human self is time or damage
* Transforming back to human form causes him to lose 75 health, 75 hunger, and 100 sanity

So far, I think that Woodie is a bit too far on the powerful side as you can regain lost health extremely easily while fighting things, and cover tons of ground easily. He's almost too hardy to die, because any trees around him can easily give him a ton of health, making his were-beaver form very sustainable. This was before the ""no-map nerf,"" which I'm still not sure really exists. If it does, I think that it should be reconsidered or removed because the map's function is too much to be removed, no matter what kind of curse you have. If it does not exist, Woodie may need some sort of nerf to make him less of a powerhouse, but the map shouldn't be what we lose. I think maxing his wood-meter out at 50 would be enough, as a significant damage dealer will KO him more easily, and he must stay near trees to keep his form.

This is just what I think. What do you think about Woodie?"	t5_2v1jr	True

1371977284.0	1gwg69	Intense winter experience	MrJellly	14	1	6	"Ok so this was my 5th game and I was playing as Wendy. Everything had been going pretty good, I had set up a large patch of berries, had a few farms going and was farming the ponds for the frogs and fishes. Basically I had all the food I needed, until winter hit. This was my first time that I had gotten to winter so I was kind of surprised when it stated snowing. 

Anyway up until this point I had found only 1 Gold Mine and I had explored a lot, desperately trying to find more gold so I could get an alchemy machine and more tech. By the time deep winter had set in I was on my last legs. I had a meat stew and some jerky. I hunted some snow rabbits with a boomerang I found and made myself some earmuffs. I put on my breezy vest I had found while exploring and set off to try find some gold. If I didn't leave I was going to starve to death, I could barely leave the base without freezing and if I didn't get the tech from the alchemy I figured I was going to be forced to sit in my base for fear of freezing and just wither away.

I had to keep making fires every minute or so, but eventually I reached some gold. By this time my sanity was getting pretty low as I had to live off the monster meat from killed spiders. I set up a temporary base in a pig village and mined as much gold as I could. I tried to get the pigs to follow me around for sanity bonus but it wasn't enough and I was seeing shadows everywhere. I was under 50 on health, hunger and sanity. By now it was the middle of winter and my  breezy vest was on 1% so I took it off, hoping that if I made it back to the base I could repair it. I took off again, trying to make my way home.

I managed to make it back, though only barely. I struggled for the rest of the winter, many times only eating some food as the screen was pulsing red from lack of food. Also had an encounter with the ent thingo. Tree guardian? Whatever it was that was a crazy fight, especially because it was at night time and I had to kite around the fire. When the lakes thawed I could not have been any happier. 


TL;DR: I wasn't ready for Winter at all and got fucked really hard by it, made worse by not having any gold to make alchemy machine. Went on quest to find gold, only barely made it there and back again. One of the most satisfying experiences in a video game ever. All I can say Winter is brutal. "	t5_2v1jr	True

That's my idea, at least. 

""Abigail! Come back! I'm not done playing with you."" 

Think about it. All of the characters are captured by Maxwell being, well, horrible people. We don't know what all of the characters did quite yet, except for Wilson and Willow (a little). In the original promo video, there are skeletons in Wilson's lab. We can assume he was human testing, murdering people in the name of ""science."" For this, Maxwell plays Satan and decides to fuck with Wilson. Or, ""They"" put Maxwell up to it, and sitting on the Shadow Throne automatically turns him into a hellish judgment figure. We also know that Maxwell brought Willow from an insane asylum— she was probably there for her pyromania. 

Why else would Wendy be so cynical, but that she's a dark and twisted child? Is it not possible that she was ""playing"" with her sister, and ""accidentally"" killed her? Not understanding that Abigail was dead, despite having— possibly— wanting to kill her, Wendy constantly asks her to come back and keep on playing. Abigail, pissed as hell about being murdered, haunts her sister, causing her great harm whenever she can (whenever she gets close). The murder, however, was enough to get Maxwell's or ""Their"" attention and coerce Wendy to follow Maxwell to his Hell.

Furthermore, Kevin mentioned during some live stream that ""Abigail died under mysterious circumstances.""

So, I think that Wendy was too young to understand what she did to Abigail, and that her death means that Wendy doesn't understand death— yet. 

TL;DR Wendy murdered Abigail, but doesn't quite understand that whatever she did killed her. This was her sin, and why Maxwell picked her to fuck with."	t5_2v1jr	True

(Day 14) Been playing for a couple of days learning the ropes, started out fresh this morning. I was really feeling this map, building my little base in a nice spot near some beefalos, making farms, scavenging for food and what not. 

I was planning to bring some loot to the pig king, along the way I got a little detoured into a forest. In front of me is a small glade, I spot a chest, an ice box and temperature thingie. Cool! I thought to myself! I'll have to break down this shit later. I move over and peek into the chest, Oooh warm clothes, some material ...and why is it snowing!? Crap. Ok ok, I got this, just have to scramble up some meat racks and plant some more traps. I bug over to the Pig King, determined to make the most of what is left of the day. It's dusk when I get there, spiders are fucking everywhere, I decide to run back home before anything stupid happens. Spiders had already destroyed my log suit. At least I had the gold in my pocket. I got this.

Winter is coming!

I run back, I'm almost there. I just have to do a short run through the herd of beefalos outside my base. But why is that beefalo looking so happy..? Maybe he's having a good day, hell if I knew. I ran through the herd and quess what, they are happy, horny, terriorial and DANGEROUS. I didnt stand a chance. SHIT! Instantly killed. Ok, this is not over yet, I activated a respawn earlier. Aaaand I'm dead again. I'm brutaly murdered and smudged into the ground by yet another herd of horny beefalos before I can properly load in.

Last chance.. the second respawn point.. far far away from my base, no supplies nearby. *Screen crack!* I panic and run for my life, I pray to Maxwell, save me! *Second screen crack!* I stop in my tracks, gaze upon my reflection in a frozen marsh and accept my faith, there is no coming back from this. I froze to death before I was even a third of the way home.

I was blown away by how quickly the game spirled out of control! Triggered an early winter, I was almost murdered by a throng of spiders, got killed twice by a pack of beefalo and then froze to death as icing on the cake. Heh. All in just one afternoon. Those four mandrakes in my chest are laughing at me now.

1365954522.0	1cbv39	[Q] Advice for Someone With their First Possible Stable World	FlowerpotJason	14	1	33	"Hi all, I'm new to Don't Starve and loving the game. I'm currently in a world with Wilson and seem to have been able to survive 2 winters so I think this might be sustainable. My world is rich in rock, wood, and spiders. My tactics have been:

- Move lots of berry bushes to my base, which also have 3-4 pigs living nearby. Fertilised with manure/rot and keep a boomerang on hand for gobblers.
- Farm silk, spider glands and monster meat from the nearby spiders
- Silk makes bird traps and birds are stored in chests for winter
- Collect many berries into the ice box, toast them when they're about to expire
- Make Meatballs using berries, morsels and monster meat. In desperate times, eat cooked monster meat and use refined spider glands to heal.

I can get wood nearby without too much problem. So I have two questions:

1) Should I be doing anything different?

2) Should I enjoy the world I have until I accidentally die somehow? (I also have touched a stone and could make meat effigies.)

3) If not, I have found 4 of the things, what are the benefits of moving to a new world? Is it just the same as starting again? To me it seems that the only real non-replenished resource is boulders and I have many many boulders at the moment.

I tried to get Beefalo to gang up on it, but their mating season ended the day before the Deerclops attacked; so, they got slaughtered.  I ended up running away from the four-story-tall beast to a wormhole that leads back to my home.  I'm safe(ish) for now, but how can I really deal with this thing?

He moves too fast for me to reliably use Boomerangs, and his AOE damage radius is too big for me to get out of the way of it after attacking with a spear.  I've got too little health to risk rampantly attacking.

It's only Day 33 now; so, it's not like I'm rich in hound teeth.  I'll make some tooth traps as my next action when I get back to the game later today.

A video of somebody killing one of these in actual combat would be majorly useful.

It's almost like I can't die even if I wanted to. Not only does he have more health and hunger, he also hits harder. Take on a tentacle monster with Wilson and your health will be down to almost nothing and your log suit down around 20 something percent. But with Wolfgang I can kill 3 tentacle monsters in a row in only one log suit.

And what's worse is that you unlock this character after playing long enough to become an expert.  

The progression from Willow to Wendy feels good. You survive for long enough by taking care to always have light and you unlock a character which removes the need for that grind, but comes with a danger of burning down your camp. It makes sense and is balanced. 

I haven't played Wendy much, but she is also seems balanced with having a benefit and a down side.

Wolfgang on the other hand just seems OP. So here are my suggestions:

Wolfgang should perhaps starve faster and require more food? It seems odd, as in odd compared to real life, that the strong guy is less susceptible to starvation. Maybe we should have a chubby character with that benefit? 

Or perhaps Wolfgang should be the first character you play, and as you learn to play the game you unlock other characters. And then Wilson, the one who can help you survive death, should be the final unlock-able characters. I feel that paradoxically the first characters is also the hardest to survive with and the last the easiest.

1371697262.0	1gpbg0	The Great Spider-War of Day 94.	bigreddot44	15	2	8	"The great spider war of day 94 has ended with many casualties. I had a pig army that went down in defeat after two waves of attack. They would have taken the spider dens and their queen had they not played their trump card and sent out a 2nd queen. Suiting up in log armor and a football helmet I took to the battlefield to aid my swine companions only to be unable to save them as they were swept up in the arachnid horde. So I shot them all with firedarts and watched them all burn away.

 I suppose a memorial place should be put into place after I destroy all of the other dens in appreciation for my fallen friends. It also didn't help the spiders cause that I was enraged that a koalaphant killed my smallbird right before that. Pips shall be avenged!

I had placed two spider eggs near-ish my base and barricaded it with stone walls to harvest silk and glands for some time now, seeing that the pigs would keep the spiders at bay, but I guess I forgot to set up a contingency plan when I left for some time to explore the world and I came back to that. Does anyone else feel epic when something like this happens?"	t5_2v1jr	True

To be honest I'm not a big Willow fan (sorry!) but it was neat to get to know her personality and try someone different.  I had a few failed runs due to stupidity (""Here stream viewers, let me show you how to fight a deerclops!"") or distractions, etc.  I finally got a successful run (and all in one go too) tonight.  It took me about 9 hours but I did it.

I'll probably be taking a break from Don't Starve tomorrow but I stream pretty frequently if you guys want to watch me attempt to beat the game with the rest of the cast.  I will also probably break my left-to-right rule for Wes since I think it would be best to save him for last as he will be the most challenging.  I usually don't get much viewers (mostly people I know IRL) but anyone is welcome to come hang out and I try to respond to everyone who chats.  I also sometimes stream me playing instrumental acoustic guitar arrangements of video game music and other low-spec games that my crappy pc can run :).

There have been a few post about different console commands and I figured I would put them all in one place for everyone. Most of this content comes from the [Don't Starve Wiki page on console commands](http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Console) [and useful functions](http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/User:SKnight/Modding)

* **How to unlock [Maxwell](/spoiler) is at the bottom of the post**

* **How to enable console commands:**

1\. On Windows &amp; Mac go to *&lt;Documents&gt;\Klei\DoNotStarve\settings.ini* On Linux go to *~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini*

2\. In *settings.ini* change

    [MISC]

    ENABLECONSOLE = false

to

    [MISC]

    ENABLECONSOLE = true

(On a Mac use TextEdit to open settings.ini if you have to manually select an application for settings.ini to open on.)

* **Console Commands:**

Use the ""~"" key in game to open the console

Use the Enter/Return key to execute the command

**Warning: All commands will wear off upon leaving the game**

Replace the 15 with the number corresponding to the number of days you want to skip. Be aware this is very slow because the game saves once everyday.

* **Reveal Full Map:** First execute

*minimap = TheSim:FindFirstEntityWithTag(""minimap"")* 

* Next execute

*minimap.MiniMap:ShowArea(0,0,0, 10000)*

Wilson went through some pretty harsh stuff this time around:

- Discovering the Hand in the dark for the first time (easy peasy stuff, but at first I thought it was the shadow of the Deerclops and had a huge panic attack)
- Setting himself on fire and resurrecting *facepalm*
- Having the visit of a Spider Queen at his BASE
- Almost freezing to death
- Almost getting killed by the Koallefant
- Almost getting killed by spiders
- Having hardly ANY rocks to mine... still didn't find a single field of rocks

But there were also  some wonderful accomplishments:

- Building his first bee-box
- Stocking up a full icebox with all sorts of yummy recipies
- Catching a Koalefant and creating a puffy vest (YESSSS! Getting all that silk almost got me killed twice -_-)
- Having a nice stock of gold (in the two digits, after building both science machines)  


After being well set up for the second winter (puffy vest, beefalo hat, food, etc) Wilson went exploring to find Things (only had a Ring Thing so far)... he got attacked by spiders on his first night away from ""home"" aaaand died. No resurrection this time around =("	t5_2v1jr	True
