1366055703.0	1cers3	Please stop shouting, I'm scared.	neph001	248	34	141	"Hi there. I'm mostly a lurker. I contribute to conversations when I can, but more than not I just check out awesome news updates posted here and read the discussions to get other peoples' takes on information about the game that has been presented.

I'm pretty excited about this game. I saw that video that was leaked recently. The one we're not supposed to talk about. You know what I thought? Looks cool. Players a bit special, but that's okay, it's a glimpse of something I'm excited for.

Lately, this subreddit, and perhaps the forming ESO community at large, has started to feel like an active war zone, dominated by a few extremely vocal, extremely pessimistic minorities. It seems to be mostly extremists: hardcore MMO raiders (who in my opinion are going to whine no matter what because if they really got what they're asking for they would whine about how it's a grindfest and/or just a copy of WoW) and, much less so on this subreddit but elsewhere on the web, hardcore TES lore scholars upset about some things we know to be redacted by the writers; these are the two I can think of off the top of my head, but I think there might be others.

I *think* I'm part of a majority of the community, but it's hard to tell, because we're a quiet majority if we're a majority at all: **fans of ESO.** We might also be veteran TES fans. We might also be veteran MMO players. We might be completely new. But whatever else we are, we're not so extremist or passionate about one SINGLE aspect of a vast and inclusive game that we have that much to say besides, ""Eeee can't wait!"".

If I'm indicative, we're starting to get scared off from all the shouting and pitchfork waving. So if you're one of the people that's been yelling and shouting about how betrayed you feel over the absence of some feature or the form of some other feature, I have a question for you:

What are you still doing here? If you're so offended by one aspect of this very big, multi-aspect game, why not just leave, and ignore it, and play games you do like? Why make such a scene?

The rest of us just want to talk about cool things, and wait to enjoy whatever it is the developers *do* come out with. We don't like all the shouting."	t5_2tqi0	True

I have watched most of the videos and listened to many of the podcasts, but i will inevitably miss something and spell things incorrectly. If you come across a detail you think needs to be here, post it and i'll add it. I'll also restructure the post as more info comes in.

Also this is not a Beta information thread. Only for facts that are released by Zenimax Online. 



					**The World:**

* The entire continent of Tamriel, on the world Nirn.
* Not all areas will be available at launch
* each area will be as large as they are in the other ES games.

				**The Alliances(Factions):**

* All three factions are battling for control of a single PVP area, Cyrodiil


* Aldemeri Dominion

 * Altmer(High Elf)
 * Bosmer(Wood Elf)
 * Khajiit

* Daggerfall Covenant

 * Breton(Human/elf)
 * Redguard(Human)
 * Orc

* Ebonheart Pact

 * Nord(Human)
 * Dunmer(Dark Elf)
 * Argonian


				**Game Systems:**


Combat:

* All classes will have Health, Stamina, and Magica as the primary stats
* Secondary stats will include weapon, armor, and other skills
* Classes are loose systems that will get you started down your path, and can be adjusted as you see fit.
* Combat actions will have no cooldown
* Combat actions will cost stamina, magica, or both.
* Combat will be the balance of managing the stamina and magica resources, as well as class based skills at the correct time.
* All classes will be able to use stamina to break stuns, if they choose, at the cost of stamina
* Players will have access to an 'ultimate move' after filing the 'Finesse' bar, which can help or hurt other players/enemies
* Combat is intended to be about strategy, not pure output.
* Targeting will be a combination of free aim and soft lock. Attacks are still subject to the classic damage modifier that other MMOs use. A swing is a hit, and roll for damage no mater where you hit.
* Any class can use any weapon/armor combination, thuogh they may not have the skills to use them as deeply as other classes. 

PVP:

* PVP will be done completely in the area of the imperial province.  The city will be locked on release.
* They will be cut into “Campaigns”. Likely timed battles you will be locked into until the battle completes. This will help avoid battle jumpers. 
* There will be no open world PVP in leveling zones. Factions are locked to their areas.
* The faction that conquers the PVP city will have an “Emperor”, who will gain a yet undefined reward.
* The faction that controls the PVP city will get a yet undefined reward.
* There will be a PVP progression system - [Matt Firor iterview] (http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2013/jan/29/elder-scrolls-online-characters)


PVE:

* There will be dungeons and hard mode dungeons
* “Raids” look like they will be in open world and dungeon PVE areas built for Solo, small, or large groups. 
* “Smart AI” enemies will not just sit and watch you kill their friends without attacking. This differs from the area of attack and leash model other MMOs use.

Questing:

* Questing is open. You can get a quest, and continue on it, or without penalty, go pick up another one you happen to find on the way.
* Questing will have tangible results in the game world. This is done via phasing
* Any player, grouped or not, can take part in your quests and reap the full rewards.
* There is a Mage Guild that you gain favor by collecting books in the world, and are rewarded with items and quests.
* There is a Fighters guild as well. Breaking ""Dark Anchors"" gains favor
* Other guilds will be available post release

Guilds:

* Players will be able to join multiple guilds
* Likely cross faction guilds as well

Other:

Crafting:

* Very little is know of crating at the moment.
* Smithing, Enchanting, Alchemy are known options
* Interviews have hinted that it will be the known crafting style of Skyrim, with specializations
* Orcs “weapons and armor are prized by warriors everywhere “


					**Plot:**

* The character learns immediately that their Soul has been stolen by a currently unknown force. This is the driving force behind the death/rebirth * system that all MMOs have
* the Daedric Prince Molag Bal is the primary antagonist of the main Plot.
* A magical explosion took place, which killed or drove insane many mages, as well as opening up planes of oblivion to the world.

I have noticed recently that many people come on here asking questions and that nobody wants to help, instead they criticize them for asking the question. I know there is a search function, and I know that people don't know how to use it well or at all. That and it can sometimes be very difficult if you're using your computer, I have experienced issues using the search function before and it's not very user friendly.  

That being said... When people come here to ask a question we don't need people criticizing or getting angry, you're not helping anyone at all anywhere. We do have people in the beta and some of them have openly admitted to them being in it right now. I myself am in the beta along with many of my friends that I met on various websites.

If you have questions feel free to ask them. If you are answering questions be polite about it, don't be an asshole. We don't want the community Of Elder Scrolls Online to be full of assholes and fuckheads right from lunch, that's how games with huge potential die really fast. 

So again, over the next few months until the game comes out of closed beta there will be many questions that are asked. Direct them to resources and websites and the like if you know the answer for them read up on. There is a lot of content to the game already and you should know that there will be a lot of information coming soon as the beta becomes an open beta, eventually. 

Be friendly that's all I think we should be doing right now. 

We can take a prime example from World of Warcraft and looking at how the community has gone to shit over the past few years. A new expansion comes out everybody comes back and there's a lot of new content to learn, and nobody's willing to help out the new folk who have no idea what's going on. Give people a chance before you tear them a new asshole. I say this because TESO is one giant mega server, the community will all act the same as its basically one ""realm"". We really don't want this. 

If you look at Guildwars 2 and how many people are coming in and out of that community and look at the PVP system and everything (the groupings and the teamwork and the community as a whole) it is all very friendly and very user-friendly and has a lot of support behind it. It's a strong community, giving the support the developers need to continue to make a great game!

Let's learn from past mistakes that other communities have made and fix them, for ourselves. We should all stop acting like snobs, get our heads out of our asses and continue the good work we all do in The Elder Scrolls universe.

This is very important considering a big name companiy like Zenimax studios or in this case Zenimax Online Studios/Bethesda (part of their team is working with ZOS) have come together to create a great game, and we need to make sure that we as a community can continue to support the studio by making a strong community for old and new players alike to give the devs a reason to enjoy their job. Think of us like rock concert fans and they are the band, if no one shows up then why should they care?

Stop being snobs, be friendly and kind to your fellow gamers, and show them the respect you would like in kind when it came time for the help you will need down the line.

What goes around comes around, and a strong helpful community is what makes a great game last for years.

Thanks for your time.

1358960037.0	174onf	How to kill an MMO community (3 lessons from WoW)	name_user321	129	46	115	"**1. Give players unrestricted flying mounts.**
In order to make sure your players engage with the game world and each other as little as possible, you must first give them the option of bypassing all content completely by flying over it. Nothing is more fun than mounting up, pointing your character in the right direction, then going AFK while your character soars through the open sky towards its destination. Who wants to discover new caves or engage in random PvP when you could be eating some chips instead?

**2. Allow fast-travel to become the main mode of transportation.**
There's that pesky open world again, always getting in the way. And what's with all these idiots asking for help with a quest or trying to kill me? Am I supposed to actually care about other players from my faction? And am I supposed to hate players of opposing factions? Of course not, all that lore is a formality the developers only included to attract more nerds. Just like flying mounts, fast-travel should be there to let you skip that annoying content so you can get to the next piece of epic loot ASAP. Participate in whatever end-game content you want, all from the comfort of your favorite major city!

**3. Tailor the game to meet the needs of solo players.**
Just because it's an MMO doesn't mean people actually need to socialize. You should do everything in your power to make sure there are very few benefits to forming guilds or friendships with new people. Allow players to join a queue for group PvE and PvP content, then match them with 5-20 random strangers and give them some sweet loot just for showing up. Not only will this make friends and guildmates superfluous, it will also ensure that people are as lazy and annoying as possible when grouped together. Little Johnny doesn't need to worry about pissing off his groupmates by going AFK when there's an endless supply of random strangers who will automatically be grouped with him whenever he wants.

But what we don't want is for this subreddit to become is a haven for beta testers to come in and break the NDA. Beta testing is a privilege, and the people involved should follow the NDA that they agreed to. To me, it's not a matter of legality, it's a matter of respect. We're simply not going to provide a supportive atmosphere for that kind of behavior... It's our choice as moderators, and our task to police it.

Therefore, we reserve the right to remove NDA violations. We'll also comply to ZeniMax requests to remove NDA violations.

Why? Because we respect their art. Much like filmmaking, video game development is a long process that really only comes together in the final stages. There's a good reason you didn't head out to the megaplex to see the latest rough cut of The Avengers.

Also, regarding ""censorship""... I've seen some comments that are basically comparing us removing NDA violations to the Watergate scandal. Reality check to those folks: This is a video game. There is no grand conspiracy. We're just respecting the work of the development team and doing what we think is best for the community overall.

It's my personal belief that the community can and will police itself (see the first paragraph under Rules) and to that point, I'd like to thank the people who have reported NDA violations to us so far. Please keep doing what you're doing. We appreciate it.

The ""nerd raging"" you're referring to was meant to be humor but we can see how some may take it as being serious. 


The problem is that we didn't realize the pull we had with the community at the time and how much trouble it would cause for a company we love. 


So from the ShoddyCast, both Josh and myself, we apologize for our ignorance on that subject. And will bring information to you guys more sensibly in the future should it avoid all out hate storms.


We now ask that you stop harassing people that are simply thanking Zenimax for taking the time to add a feature that was wanted by so many TES fans. Continue hating us if you wish. That's you're right as individuals, but to criticize people who watch and enjoy our show is in no way appropriate.


Thanks all that have taken the time to thank ZOS and we hope those with issues against us can move past it and concentrate on the game itself.

For starters, graphics are almost on par with skyrim.


Definitely buggy as hell right now. Partying up bugged out on us and we weren't able to have more than 2 people per group, probably a 10 minute fix from the developer.
Also, looting containers on the ground, such as crates or bags on the ground worked but was buggy. 

We we're able to play as any three races on the daggerfell side. Of those, we could play as a sorcerer, dragon knight or a templar. I played as a sorcerer, friend was a templar and girlfriend was a dragon knight. All classes had some spells. There we're three different pools to put our 5 available skill points in: weapons armor and combat skills. Both passive and castable skills we're available from every pool. 

I fought humans, killed a couple rabbits, spriggans look different ( tree trunks instead of legs ). Also fire imps, lots of fire imps. 

I'm an idiot and forgot to try out first person view.

1370923050.0	1g3jbb	After so many accounts of them claiming a 2013 release date, it has been pushed back to spring 2014.	aDumbGorilla	124	54	142	"http://elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/06/10/eso-on-next-gen-consoles-and-new-gameplay-trailer

This entire announcement just pissed me off honestly. I know being this sub-reddit this will probably get downvoted into the negatives, because anyone anti-ESO is a heathen. 

On a game this large, a game that they have had 6 years to work on it, a game that they had confirmed a 2013 release date countless times, and now they push it back. Seriously, this better not because they have to port to consoles because papa Zenimax is telling them to make as much money as possible. Also, ESO better not have console watered down graphics. I know the *next-gen* consoles have updated hardware, but most gaming grade PCs are already generations faster. I don't want low resolution textures and a console optimized UI on my PC(Skyrim). They just took a huge turn south for me. 

Consoles are being marketed to kids, anyone who plays or played CoD will know that. All big *online* games are filled with little teenagers and preteens that think they are hot shit. I don't want to have to deal with little kids when I am trying to take my game seriously. In casual multiplayer games(CoD), it's fine because little to no teamwork is necessary. But if I am trying to organize a raid on an enemy fort in Cyrodiil and some little kids go and do their own thing while claiming they had sex with my mother, it's ZOS's fault.

In the wake of the hugely successful GW2 I'd like to share some of the things that I've learned. These may not necessarily apply to you, and by all means feel free to contribute your own.

* Beta is beta

Being a beta tester isn't all fun and games, it's a voluntary job. You get to ensure that people who don't play have an awesome time at launch. It isn't just an invitation to play the game early though it should definitely be fun, that's what the game is all about after all.

* The subreddit **will** change after launch

I can't stress this enough. The GW2 subreddit was a peaceful interactive place where everyone was bursting with fan art, patch notes and general game suggestions were posted. The smallest bugs were exploded way out of proportion and people began demanding money back and complaining about being banned for ""no reason"". It was no doubt a vocal minority, but please remember to keep things friendly and not spam reddit or their fb page or the forums about bugs and stupid shit.

* Too much media can be a bad thing

I used to check the GW2 subreddit 15 times a day. I would watch every video I could find on youtube and Gamebreaker Tv, and I read every blog and forum post I could find. By the time I actually got to the play the game I already knew everything about it and I became jaded very quickly. Overexposure, especially before launch, can ruin the game for you.

* A happy community makes a game better

This game will be pulling in a lot of players who are fans of the ES games and may not have any MMO experience. This may lead to some seriously whiny and generally inexperienced players. I'm a little worried about this myself, but if you keep an open mind and are willing to contributed **positively** than the game will be a more fun place.

TL;DR Don't be the kind of player that you hate, and contribute positively to the community. "	t5_2tqi0	True

1371053559.0	1g7beo	I got two hours on ESO at E3 and spoke with Paul Sage from Zenimax.	xaraan	81	10	27	"First, the gameplay:

(I'm coming from an Elder Scrolls background, and have never played an MMO.)  I really enjoyed the game.  It did have a slightly different feel to it than say Skyrim, but still felt Elder Scrolls.  Part of the feel may have been because the game felt bigger, there seemed to be a bit more going on in the cities, it felt a bit better than the somewhat empty feeling of Skyrim's cities.  (I started in Daggerfall, playing a Breton Dragonknight, they had three tables set up, one for each faction.)

The graphics looked good (we've all seen a bit online before, some may have even seen the beta look that was made to not look so good).  The graphics were a bit more... cartoonish? than we you get with a good build of Skyrim, but I don't say that in a bad way.  In fact, details, scenery, everything looked great.  I think for me, it felt like a mix of 75% Skyrim and 25% Fables in the feel of the graphics (which was fine for me being that I loved both games).  Everyone has their own opinions, but considering what they have to work with in building an MMO, I thought the graphics were fine.

Gameplay felt good, the character seemed like he had a bit more weight to him (physics wise) than you do in Skyrim.  Combat wasn't too hard (they started us at level 5) if you paid attention and didn't get sloppy (I have no idea how that beta leak guy died so easily) and used your powers wisely.  In my play, I fought assassins, wolves, spriggans, and some sort of flying imps.  After fighting them more than once, you did get a very predictable set of actions to expect from them.  I don't know if AI is still being worked on, but for now there wasn't a lot of change in tactics to how they fight - though that change may come more when facing larger groups instead of just a single player.

Interaction with other players worked alright.  One player using a sorcerer was in the same area as me at one point so we helped each other out as we made our way through the assassins.  He died at one point, becoming a ghost (I'm not sure what became of him as I kept on going), but it was kind of neat to run into someone to work with for a bit.  It seems like when you both get to NPCs to speak with, chests, or killed villains, you both get to loot/speak/interact with them separately.  So no one can steal your loot after a kill.  But I did notice if you ran up and helped someone with a fight, just to land a blow or two, you would not get any loot option, which seems fair.

As for view, I play Skyrim in third person, so I enjoy the 3rd person of ESO myself.  It felt good to me, dealing with the targeting was fairly easy.  I did play in first person for a little bit, but they still don't have the animations built in for this build, so it was a bit odd no seeing my weapon yet.  They also offered the option of zooming in or out, so if you want to have the camera set further back in 3rd person to see a lot of what's going on around you, or right up (almost) over your shoulder, you had choices there.

I think I covered everything I could think of, now onto Paul Sage:

I'm sure we will all hear any big news coming out of E3 everywhere, like we all know about ESO coming to consoles now.  He did say that the console players would be on their own servers each, separate from PC players.  Also, the game will not be dumbed down for console.  With the new consoles, they will run games better than most average PCs of today, remember, (ESO is not being targeted at only high end PCs) so with the game coming out during a new console launch it gave them an option that wasn't there before,  ie, not something they would try on 360 or PS3.  I can't see how ESO coming to console is bad, it will offer ESO a bigger chance of success, with the end result being the game will be supported better for PC.

When talking to him about 50+ content, I didn't really get new info, just cleared up or verified some assumptions.  You will not see enemy players, even if they are on your friends list, in other faction territory.  So if you want to play with a friend in a different faction you will have to make up a character in their faction.  The quests will be very similar to what you would get in that faction, just on a whole other level of difficulty.  So if you had played in that faction with a starting character, you may see an almost identical quest, just expect it to be much more difficult.  

Things they could not answer yet.  Still no solid answer on multiple characters, he seemed to agree with playing multiple characters in different factions, yet wouldn't give an official answer on how that will work.  Also, I asked, with the console announcement, does it mean they've decided how the pay structure will work on PC and got a negative on that one as well."	t5_2tqi0	True

Today I launched [eso.guildex.org](http://eso.guildex.org), which is part of an expanded version of GW2Guilds.org (Guildex).

In the run up to GW2's launch there were several different attempts made to list which servers guilds were rolling on, but eventually they all became out of date and contradicted each other, so I built GW2Guilds.org to use as a central database. It proved to be very successful, with around 2,000 guilds registered before launch, and now has over 8,000 guilds registered.

The keyword is probably simplicity. It's not a social network site or any kind of organisational tool, it's just a searchable database of guilds that allows searching based on a wide range of criteria.

If you had an account on GW2Guilds.org you'll be able to use that to log in to the new site, and you can also use the existing GW2 guild entries and expand them to include TESO.

Feedback is more than welcome.

I'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan that's played since Morrowind. I'm familiar with a lot of the lore, but unfortunately didn't get to explore any of that in the demo. As per MMO knowledge I've played the original version of WoW, Guild Wars 1, and Warhammer online.

A few random tidbits:

* I played an Argonian Sorcerer
* I primarily played first person, but did watch others play third person.
* The class added three additional trees of skills to my skill screen, unfortunately I've forgotten the names. They're basically destruction (lightning starter spell), conjuration (included scamp and atronach spells), and one other tree I didn't use. I think it was a form of healing. I recall one spell called Blood Magic or something like that.
* My character started with a small sword or dagger and a shield. Both of which I used when my Magika was too low to cast.
* The demo took place on a small island which was part of Skyrim.
* As shown in the live stream, the character creation includes a ton of sliders! The staff encouraged us to use a preset look so we could have more time running around (I did this)
* I was able to complete one of two quests I was given. The first involved gathering 12 claws from some sort of bat/demon like winged creatures. The second was better, it involved gathering three totems (featuring the whale, snake, eagle symbols from Skyrim) at three shrines near the ruins/burrow. Then talk with a Dragon Priest ghost to gain entry to the ruins. Inside the burrow was a small area that featured a few mobs, including a Necromancer the Priest wanted you to defeat. He was fairly easy for me and my buddy to dispatch. The ruins interior appears to be instanced.
* Towards the end of the demo me and my friend decided to just run and explore. We followed the coastline and discovered a ""Prodigious Mudcrab"" which dropped an Ice Staff for me. The staff could shoot quickly by tapping left click or charge up and shoot a larger attack which was really cool.

Overall I left excited about the game, it felt like an Elder Scrolls game with other people (as it should) and really can't wait to play some more!"	t5_2tqi0	True

I don't understand why they would do something like this. Ignoring the fact that they've said previously that there will be raids, how can they possibly not include large scale content for PvE? I think this is a serious mistake and I hope it's just an over zealous writer for IGN.

Garythegrand	75	18	85	"Okay, so I see lots of people around that accuse this game of ""ruining"" the lore of TES and there are three topics people hone in on. Now, I am a bit of a lore fanatic. i'm aware of GODHEAD, and CHIM. I've studied the 36 lessons, and I've read MK's writings. However I still find some of the things people say absolutely ridiculous. I am also a game designer, so I have a more pragmatic view.

Now, before I get responses saying, ""YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND"" please, read my entire post, it's the least you can do.

Jungle Cyrodil change:

Now the first point, Cyrodil. One of the most obvious ""lore breakers"" for people, now let's look at how this is honestly just a needed compromise. Everyone always quotes the first edition guide to the empire and it's statement of a jungle Cyrodil. ZOS has retconned this by saying it was a transcription error. Now, this is a weak retcon, but let's look at why it makes sense.

Something people ignore repeatedly is that Bethesda has retconned as well, however, they have set their lore in an intensely clever way to not only make retcons and messy lore mesh cleanly, but fit perfectly. How you ask? CHIM. GODHEAD, and dragonbreaks. All these metaphysical properties people love so much are implemented in lore so Beth have a way out when it comes to messy lore, and how does this work? Beth only moves forward in time, not back like ZOS. So while ZOS has to deal with the tangles of going back, Beth can continue to move forward.

Now I will stop rambleing about the metaphysical being a tool for the developer as that could be a post of it's own. Back to why it's acceptable in ESO. In 1998 Redguard was released with the first edition of the guide to the empire. As said this is the one people quote. Now from a lore standpoint this means little, but the thing people forget is lore isn't some organic thing, it is made by people and so it will change and there will eventually be issues.

Fast forward to 2006 and we have Oblivion, in which Cyrodil is no longer this supposed jungle paradise, but instead is a typical european style landscape. How did Beth explain this? They used CHIM, their get out of jail free card.

Now as for ZOS, why did they not make it a jungle? It's because of Oblivion. Oblivion sold a good number of copies, and like Skyrim, brought a large number of people into the franchise. In fact the majoraty of ES fans came in at Morrowind or later. And, if they do not go into MK's writings and such and all this external metaphysical nonsense, they would have no idea that Cyrodil used to be a jungle. So to appease this majoraty demographic of people ZOS had to make the call to keep Cyrodil as it is in oblivion.

Honestly, that's a call not even I would want to make. But it is a fair one.

Now the second point, Elder scrolls having stat bonuses in pvp:

This one boggles my mind when I see people saying this breaks the lore, as frankly it breaks it less then finding modern books in ancient Nord tombs in Skyrim.

It's a game mechanic simple as that. And if you want a logical reason why? Well war looting. War looting has been a thing since war was invented essentially. It's a simple thing but t makes perfect sense, especially for the elder scrolls. During a war if a country gains control of a territory, even for a short while they will steal all they can, whether it be resources, wealth, or in the case of an Elder Scroll information, not to mention something beyond the mortal mind.

Want examples of common war looting in history?
After the siege of Constantinople in 1204, the crusaders looted the city and transferred its riches to Italy.
Between 1804 and 1814 Napoleon Bonaparte engaged in massive looting in Europe.

And finally the most recent example:

During World War II, both Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan engaged in massive and systematic looting of valuables worth tens of billions of dollars. The Soviet Army also operated official trophy brigades to loot valuable artworks from Germany in retaliation.

And so there you have it. People in the real world loot things less valuable then the Elder Scrolls. As for the stat bonus they give? Moral boost. if your nation stole something that was part of creation, that would probably excite you a bit.

So for this one I personally find this a moot complaint, rather silly to me. Gameplay doesn't have to equal lore, and if one assumes it does then that is entirely silly.

And now the final point the Ebonheart pack, and hell the orcs, and how their alliances don't make sense:

This one also boggles my mind as again, if you look to real life there is nothing odd here. Yes, some of these groups despise each other, and yes, some have actively been at war.

Does this make their alliances make any less sense? Absolutely not.

Now I would put down a list of examples, but this post is getting wordy as is, so I will simply point out World War II as the perfect example. The number of countries that allied together during this war, that hated each other, is really something, if you haven't I'd recommend reading up on it as it really is very interesting.

Now sometimes people aren't worried about alliances during the game, but they are upset because, ""Why aren't they allied after the threat is gone?"" And this is entirely silly. being in an alliance during war means nothing for after it. Again WWII, during this time America and Russia were allies, huh well that's odd, they weren't on good terms. Oh but after the war relations went back to as they were, hostile and well, we all know what happens after.



And so there we have it y'all. One retcon that was needed to please the majority over the minority of the playerbase (an unfortunate part of game design), a game mechanic that is just that, with a bit of logic thrown in for flavor. And a nit-pick that when examined has no reason to be nit-picked.

Now no doubt the comments will devolve into people saying how wrong I am and how this game has ruined the lore, but let me just end with this:

For one, this is a video game made by human beings. Bethesda didn't have the foresight in 98 to know what would happen in 2006, no company does, but they were smart enough to build in a system of lore that let them get away with sneaky edits. As well in 98 they couldn't have known that an mmo would be released in 2013.

Now ZOS is not an entity unto itself, Beth has been in close contact with them, and to say they haven't is silly, I mean at Pax east next week ZOS doesn't even get their own booth to show the game, they are showing it, you guessed it, in Bethesda's booth. So it's safe to assume some of Beth is involved with the making of this game, so if you dislike the changes, some blame has to be put on Beth too honestly.

And so I just want to say, calm down. Take a step back and be pragmatic, look at this not only as a lore issue, but a practical issue and how these human beings are treating it.

And finally, stop saying that this game ruins the entirety of lore. The game is not in fact out at all, and so if you say this you are blatantly exaggerating. until the game is out we can't judge it in such a way, that's like trying to judge the quality of the main campaign, or the amount of end game before it is released, we do not know, and it is unfair to make such judgments.

Now I hope you have read this all and if you have thank you. There are a few other points I will talk about in a comment below, but for now this is long enough. Thank you for your time, and see you in Tamriel adventurer.

TL;DR read the damned thing. That's how discussions work.

Everyone wanted it to live up to Skyrim, but it's not. It's not even a # in the series, and it's made by a different company. It's the Online world for the ES. Not THE elder scrolls games themselves.

Also, this game is going to be massive. If I can recall correctly, the entire size of Great Britain? It's hard to fit a game of Skyrims standards into an online world like that. Corners have to be cut. Graphics aren't going to be revolutionary. In an MMO, graphics have never been a huge factor. MMOs are all about gameplay mechanics. The fighting in this footage is bad, but its beta.
 
A few things I noticed right off the bat is that it appears to be running on the lowest settings, perhaps they limited it to that for beta - perhaps the high res texture packs are still being build. These are placeholders. I've seen a lot of what I believe to be placeholder textures and mechanics, such as the menu system at the start. Very basic, appears to be a placeholder menu.

Yes it will have endgame content, but ES has always been about its lore and immersion, rushing to max level by skipping quest text, not exploring and just running around to get ""World First"" is only going to get boring quickly.

This isn't WoW where they have the budget of a small country to fork out huge patches and endgame raids right off the bat.

I imagine all that will come later.

If you want to rush to max level, do so but don't complain its ""shit, no end game content, bethesda have no idea what they are doing, dont get it."" and put off the people who are awaiting to hear what its like before buying it.

People might love it but people wont buy it if handful of diehard MMO gamers try to ""beat"" it and complain there is nothing to do and put people off buying it.

**What is ESO?**

Elder Scrolls Online is the next installment of the Elder Scrolls franchise in MMO form. It has been stated that it will be an Elder Scrolls game first, and an MMO second. Elder Scrolls fans should find themselves at home, while MMO players will be offered a new experience with an MMO that is doing its best to not follow the status quo.

**Who is making it?**

It is being made by Zenimax Studios rather than Bethesda, so there will be differences between ESO and the previous games.

**What is the payment model?**

We don’t know it yet, as they haven’t told us. Unfortunately we will have to wait for that information.

**Will there be co-op?**

Yes, it will be similar to a typical MMO. PvE will take place in your alliance territory, where you can quickly group up with people around you, or just play side by side with a random player. When you wish to play PvP, you simply go into the province of Cyrodiil where the Alliance War will take place. AvA is the initialism for this, Alliance vs. Alliance.

**What will AvA be like?**

In Cyrodiil, there will be keeps to defend and battlefields to be bloodied. The alliances will be able to buy siege weapons to assault keeps and other various tools to defend keeps when they have them. It will be a jump in jump out type of system (source?) where you may enter Cyrodiil and run to the aid of your alliance. The so-called “best” PvPer will be crowned Emperor.

**Who are the Tharns?**

The Tharns are the current ruling body on the ruby throne. Clivia Tharn is the empress regent, and her father Abnur Tharn, an old battlemage, is the chancellor of the elder council. They are secret Daedra worshippers. They enlist the aid of the Daedra and the necromancer Mannimarco, Molag Bal’s agent in Tamriel to defend themselves against the growing alliances surrounding Cyrodiil.

**Do we fight the Tharns?**

So far there is no information about that, but it’s possible. PvP is said to allow battle with Molag Bal and his armies later in the game.

**What’s the story of the alliances?**

Cyrodiil is a large province in the center of Tamriel. Each of the young alliances wishes to gain control of Cyrodiil because it’s a symbol of power over the continent. The alliances have various reasons to take control of Cyrodiil. They are the Daggerfall Covenant, the Ebonheart Pact, and the Aldmeri Dominion.

**Daggerfall Covenant**

The Daggerfall Covenant consists of Bretons, Redguards, and Orcs. Lead by High King Emeric the Breton, he thinks the empire is weak, and there will be peace when it is strong. In short, he wants the humans to take back control to keep the elves out.

**Ebonheart Pact**

The Ebonheart Pact consists of Nords, Dark Elves, and Argonians. They see that the Daedra are a threat to Tamriel. Jorunn The Skald King, a Nord, leads the Ebonheart Pact. Almalexia, one of the living gods of the tribunal and representative of the Dunmer, feels they must stop the Daedra as they are a threat to Nirn.

-Thanks to /u/Nokutisu for pointing out the true leader of the Pact

**Aldmeri Dominion**

The Aldmeri Dominion consists of the High Elves, the Wood Elves, and the Khajiit. Queen Ayrenn of the High Elves suffered at the hands of Abnurr Tharn. She believes the elves should retake the tower her kind built themselves, and kick out the humans who are warmongering and self-destructive.

**What areas of Tamriel will be available to exploration?**

[This is a fan-made map of where you can most likely explore. UPDATED FOR ACCURACY]( http://i.picresize.com/images/2013/01/23/eRlkj.jpg) As it is very lengthy to explain, if you wish to follow his/her process, read [this.](http://www.tesof.com/topic-available-areas-on-teso-release)

**How will magic work?**

“Magic in ESO will behave much more like Oblivion wherein you can still cast a fireball from a hand with a sword in it. In ESO, magic abilities will be tied to hot bar items and magic staffs. When you fire off a hot bar spell, it will fire immediately regardless of weapons. Staffs will work similar to the way they did in Skyrim, except now in ESO, there is a concept of holding down the attack button with a staff to make the staff cast a more powerful attack.
Example: A Destruction staff may shoot 1, 2 or 3 fireballs depending upon how long the attack button was held and ""charged"".” -/u/ignore_this_comment

**Can I play with a friend playing a race from a different faction?**

Unfortunately no, you cannot. The races are restricted to their own territory and Cyrodiil, and in Cyrodiil the alliance war rages on. You can chat with your friends from different factions, but you cannot fight alongside them. When you reach the level cap in your territory, you have the option to proceed to another territory.

**What do we know about dungeons?**

[For all the information you need, click this link!]( http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/07/15/ask-us-anything-dungeons)

[This is a previous article on the official page, and you can read this one too.]( http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/07/01/inside-eso-dungeons)

**How does fast travel work?**

There will be some price (non-disclosed) when using shrines, but you are able to travel to them as long as you can pay the price. [Traveling *between* shrines is free.](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/04/08/ask-us-anything-variety-pack-3) -Thanks to /u/OperaNero for pointing this out.

**Classes**

There will be Templars, Dragonknights, Sorcerers, and Nightblades at launch. That being said, these are just starting points when building your character. You can put skills in your character however you want to progress them. These classes will have specific abilities, but for the most part you can build your character how you want.

**Weapons**

There will be one-hand, two-hand, dual wield, destruction staves, restorations staves, bows, and shields at launch. Unfortunately there will neither be spears or crossbows, nor unarmed combat as far as we know. They could be added later.

**Armor**

“The Elder Scrolls Online features a very familiar armor system. Armor is divided into 3 categories: light, medium, and heavy. Light armor is generally good for magicka users. Medium armor is good for stamina users, and heavy armor is good for keeping yourself alive as long as possible. Within each category, there are many different types available; some are specific to a particular racial style (though you can wear any armor regardless of your race), and some are the iconic sets you might recognize from past Elder Scrolls games such as Daedric, Dwemer, and more.”

**How will the inventory system work?**

[Slot based, but in list style. No weights like in previous games.](http://elderscrollsonline.info/gameplay/inventory)

**How will the combat UI work?**

[There is a hot bar with 6 total abilities: 5 regular and 1 ultimate. These cannot be changed in combat but can be changed outside of combat. You will have a main attack on left click, and a charged version when held. Right click is for blocking.]( http://elderscrollsonline.info/combat)

**Will there be crime?**

At launch there will be no crime system, and there will be no Thieves’ Guild or Dark Brotherhood. That being said, it was mentioned that they will likely appear later on after release.

**Will there be mounts?**

[There will only be horses. You can upgrade your horses in various ways like increased bag space, sprint duration, sprint speed, and normal speed. No mounted combat as of yet. This link leads to a quick interview source for information on mounts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NTq77x-rH-k&amp;t=272)

**Will there be dragons?**

No there will not be dragons, not as far as we’ve been told.

**Is everyone on the same server?**

Playstation gamers will have their own server, Xbox gamers will have their own, and PC gamers will have a server. Each platform has its own “megaserver” where all players will be located, though probably in shards or what have you.

[*EDIT: OperaNero pointed out that it has been mentioned that there will be a megaserver in each region, e.g. one in Europe and one in the U.S., but you can pick the server you want to play on, albeit you may find some latency involved.*](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/07/29/ask-us-anything-roleplaying)

**Can we use controllers on PC?**

[No, but you can use third-party tools to do it.]( https://twitter.com/TESOnline/statuses/354247306486349824)

**Getting into the beta**

[Apply at the beta application page.]( https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/beta) Some people have gotten confirmation emails, some have not. I never got one and I’ve applied many times. The application is simplified to make it easier to apply. I’ve applied three times and I eventually got in about a month ago.

EDIT: [This post just made it to the front page of our subreddit. Thanks to /u/Vinshati for the information! Apparently they are not always receiving our information when we sign up. Read this post for extra information. That being said, I never got my confirmation and I just got invited again for today. I don't know what to believe!](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1k4omb/attention_if_you_did_not_receive_a_confirmation/)

**How will combat work?**

“To put it simply the game feels like an Elder Scrolls game. You have to manually attack using your spells and melee weapons. You also have to manually block; you can parry as well on some of the attacks. The combat might feel a little clunky at first but you get used to it and when you get very good at it, you can do some serious damage to mobs much above your level.” - /u/Lazuraz

“It is just like Skyrim really except that ranged combat (bows and ranged spells and the like) are mostly auto aimed (you have to point at the target, but you can’t miss if you use it on them, there’s no arrow drop in mid-air or moving out of the way of projectiles mid-air)[but they do not have infinite range]. All in all I would say it is MORE action combat than traditional Elder Scrolls because there is no pausing combat to use potions, switch weapons, think about what to do next, etc.” - /u/erlexx

**Explain lock picking**

[There will not be a skill tree for lock picking but it will skill level as your character levels. The locks will be more similar to those of Oblivion rather than Skyrim. They will range in difficulty like previous Elder Scrolls games. If you fail, you’re locked out for a while so the other players around you can tackle it. Last question in the link explains it.](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/05/20/ask-us-anything-gathering-and-exploration)

**Explain gathering and exploration**

[All is explained here. Check both this page and the link where it says *new video* in the first sentence of this link.](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/05/20/ask-us-anything-gathering-and-exploration)

*Crafting Edit: [This link shows a different look on crafting.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=7ercrYSVaqU&amp;t=754) I don't know where the previous quote came from, but I thought it was the site I linked. My mistake! It is true you can work all five professions, according to this interview. -Thanks to /u/OperaNero for pointing out my mistake!*

Takes place in a jail-like dungeon, really nice atmosphere with nice music, good lightning/shadows, prisoners grabing bars and calling to you from their cells.

Some kind of holy spells is used, lights up the area around it as it flies at the enemy and when the enemy is set ablaze he lights up the area aroudn him too.

You can hear most melee swings hitting the enemy, but the enemies still do not react to every hit(i.e. they continue to attack and perform no recoil animation) same goes for when enemies hit the player.

Talking quest NPC with some good, not great, facial expressions.

2H weapon swing animation look good, there is a slight visual effect for the path of the swing, but animations like character changing directions rapidly look bad, they need to implement some animation smoothing when you change from one animation to another.

I was really impressed by the combat, although I do agree that some animations do need to be tweaked (first person bow needs to actually be drawn). The way in which the player switched between the bow and melee was really fluid and nice and reminded me a lot of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (which had an excellent combat system).

I think a lot of the people on the stream haven't played an MMO and were expecting an single player RPG. That is REALLY NOT what this game is about. It's an MMO and I think it really reflects the good qualities of the genre.

1366506114.0	1crvst	Rewarding Elitist Accomplishments in TESO	squidmanphilosopher	57	13	67	"Yesterday, I was talking to my good friend about the glory days of MMO-ing, when the genre was still relatively fresh. We got into a discussion about Star Wars: Galaxies (pre-shitstorm), specifically talking about the risk vs. reward of becoming a Jedi, and how cool of a concept it was to become this vehemently overpowered character who has to retain some semblance of anonymity and not flaunt his powers or weapons in order to survive. This added an element to the game that not many other games provide; reality. Not everyone has the same opportunities, and not everyone cares as much as everyone else. The same held true for vanilla WoW during the AQ days, during the event for the gong that not only opened the raids for the server, but also granted one player per server a unique mount and title of ""Scarab Lord"". The same concept still applies, but to a lesser degree. It really just comes down to rewarding hard work and making it so that not everyone has access, or we run into a ""you need this in order to be viable end-game"" farm type scenario. 

Before I address how TESO could make this work, I first want to say that I think this concept is really missing amongst the more prevalent MMO's today. And I TOTALLY understand why...players whine. A lot. If they can't have what he has, why should they even be playing the game in the first place? Equal opportunity in a VIDEO GAME is an immensely foolish notion and, in my opinion, enables this self-entitled attitude in people that if they bitch about something enough, they can get whatever they want. I understand that most players are casual, and you need to please them; I am no an elitist. I was never Scarab Lord, nor did I ever become a Jedi. But the potential of becoming one was overwhelmingly cool, and it helped immerse me in ways that I don't even think I can communicate. 

So, for the love of Sheogorath, implement something like this in TESO! Someone talked about using the Voice on here the other day, and that could be implemented in cool ways. The same goes for becoming the Emperor of Cyrodil (not sure if your faction leader becomes Emperor or a player does, if someone could clear that up for me that'd be cool). Once again, this would have to be something that not everyone could do. It's unrealistic if everyone is Dragonborn, just how it's unrealistic when everyone is ""THE HERO"" (a common theme in MMO's nowadays). Set up prerequisites, and reward the hard work. 

How does the community feel about this? "	t5_2tqi0	True
1363781793.0	1anpty	A question for the community: Do you want the same old thing?	wedge1378	56	8	62	"With the flood of information in the past day, and upcoming weekend (PAX), there is bound to be some kickback in both directions. People sold on, or swearing off the game. no instanced PvP, no Instanced PvE, no true cross faction zoning(1).

Before you make a judgement about this game which in truth, no one has really played much, please ask yourself this question:

***Do I really want a game that truly breaks the MMO mold, or do I just want a game that follows the pack that I am comfortable with?***

If the answer is the latter, that's fine. We are all comfortable and successful with what has been successful in the past. It's safe, fun, and entertaining. But we've been there before, and no matter what it will be called a clone.

If you are into trying something new, that is what this game and their developers are going to try and do. Go into this game with an open mind. As a raider from Vanilla wow through ToR, I was really disappointed that there would be no instanced PvE. But I had to ask myself this morning, ""Do i really want the same?"" Part of me does, and part of me doesn't.

The crux of all the interviews and info released so far is that they want to make their own original system. Matt  Firor said himself that they tell themselves not to follow the standard MMO archetypes. They seem to have a holy trinity system, but in their own style of combat. PvP is a huge draw, and there will be small party instances. So in the future, who knows? They do tend to listen to the community.

tl;dr: The developers are doing everything they can to make this mmo an original. In the months leading up to the game, judge it as such and stick with it or leave it based on this game and this game alone. Just like the others it will sink or swim on it's own merits, clone or not.

Can we talk about other class types? 	bit_shift	53	5	116	"I keep reading so many posts about being a thief, stealing, pick-pocketing, and the dark brotherhood. I'm sure those features are neat and some people want to see them but can we talk about other things we are excited about?

I personally really want to make a sword and board Orc that is as unstoppable as can be. I loved the skill tree for shields in skyrim; especially shield charging and bashing. I also really want to see what could be done with the different types of summoning magic in the game. I loved making an evil, frail, old necromancer who could kill someone and then raise them to kill their used-to-be allies. It was great how you could also be a non-evil summoner and make atronarchs and spirit wolves.

Sugarrnuttzz	46	4	30	"Right now, our community is in a **really** good place; mostly text posts, insightful discussions, polite debates. I'm sure that a few of you remember about a year ago, the Borderlands subreddit was very much in the same situation. If you visit it now, it's awash with complaints, reposts of the same jokes/questions and ""Let's go back to being like *before*"" posts. So what happened?

The game released. 

People had their own preconceived notions of how X was going to work or how Y would look, and if you multiply that with hype, you get a disaster. Now, a lot of this falls onto the shoulders of you. Speculation if **fine**, but you need to remember that no matter how cool it sounds, or how well it could work in game, it's still *just speculation*.

Beware the honeymoon period. When BL2 launched, all was well for a good week. Then we had our first terramorphous (end-game raid boss) kill, then our first terra solo, then the world record (30 second) terra solo, and people freaked out because the majority of us where still leveling through our first playthrough, which brings me to my next point.

What other redditors did/can do/are doing is neither the standard nor the rule, but the large exception. Move at your own pace, just because they are ahead of you, or ""better"" than you does not mean that you're bad. It just means that they've played more/had better luck with gear/rushed/cheated. You are you, they aren't. Do NOT be afraid to sit back and smell the roses, enjoy the dialog the quest giver has, chat with another player And trade some gear. That's what gaming, especially co-op and MMO games are all about. 

And now, my last point: whining. **Don't**. We get it. Nobody likes a nerf, or that *one* quest is relly slow/annoying, and gankers in that one zone do suck, but whining on reddit won't help. A great example, which I can really think of as the turning point in the Borderlands' fall from grace would be, ""The Bee"". The bee was a (being completely honest) absurdly overpowered shield with a bonus that made it possible to kill terramorphous (the ""hardest"" enemy at release) solo in less than a minute. Many people loved this. Now they could faceroll for the best loot, but other purists screamed nerf so that the difficult content was actually difficult. Regardless of your opinion on the matter, the whining and bickering tore that subreddit apart and it never quite recovered.

Anyways /rant.

Up until the Oblivion Crisis, it was sat upon by a member of the Septim blood-line. That blood-line ended when Martin Septim, the last Septim, sacrificed himself in the Temple of the One to stop Mehrunes Dagon from conquering Tamriel. The Throne has never been shown in an Elder Scrolls game so far, but will appear for the first time in The Elder Scrolls Online.
**The Ruby Throne plays a special role in The Elder Scrolls Online. When a faction conquers the Imperial City, their highest ranked player will be crowned Emperor of Tamriel. This title may not last forever, but it will bring special attributes to the ""New Emperor"" when he/she fights in the PvP environment of Cyrodiil. The Ruby Throne has become a symbol for power amongst the 3 factions' mission statements. They all view the Ruby Throne is the key to conquering/pacifying Tamriel.**

This got me to thinking... It would be pretty cool if you could purchase guild colors and possibly crests on your arrow fletchings. I would love to design my own fletching (per player), but that might be a bit too much, idk.  
  
  
It would be cool in pvp arena's for pride. It would be cool in open world, when you want to track a player. It would be cool for roleplaying. It would just be cool... at least I think so.

1365184980.0	1bqwwx	Idea for legendary weapons	ponchoman275	49	8	37	I think the game should have legendary weapons that only excellent players could obtain. The way these weapons could be implemented would be like in Arena, you travel all across Tamriel collecting fragments of the weapon (or in TESO it could be recipes, artifacts, crafting materials etc). You would have to beat the hardest dungeons, search for clues and collect relics from all around the world. Finally you would assemble your weapon. It should be hard to obtain and require a lot of time to complete but not just make it a farming award. To make it a personal achievement there could be one final dungeon where you have to assemble the magical weapon, but it would be guarded by a extremely hard mob in a solo instance, so you would truly have to be a good player and not just ride shotgun while your friends win the fight for you. Everywhere else help is okay, even encouraged but the final test has to be your own personal achievment. Each weapon would have it's own personal story and lore.

* Only posts relevant to The Elder Scrolls Online.
* No meme pics, rage comics, reaction pics, or guild recruitment threads.
* No race/gender/politics/religion/sexual orientation topics unless directly relevant to The Elder Scrolls Online
* Reddiquette, please!
* Self-promotion is fine, but should be balanced with participation in the subreddit.

*****

**Answers to Common Questions**

A few answers to some of the most common or repeated questions asked in this subreddit. Most material taken from /u/beginner-'s wonderful [Elder Scrolls Online FAQ thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1j48pc/the_elder_scrolls_online_faq/), within which you can find a more detailed array of frequently asked questions. The subreddit itself also has [an FAQ with even more information](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/wiki/faq).

**What is ESO?**

Elder Scrolls Online is the next installment of the Elder Scrolls franchise in MMO form. It has been stated that it will be an Elder Scrolls game first, and an MMO second. Elder Scrolls fans should find themselves at home, while MMO players will be offered a new experience with an MMO that is doing its best to not follow the status quo.

**Who is making it?**

It is being made by Zenimax Studios rather than Bethesda, so there will be differences between ESO and the previous games. Some names you may see come up in interviews and news posts include:

* Matt Firor - Game Director
* Paul Sage - Creative Director
* Brian Wheeler - Lead PvP Designer

**What is the payment model?**

We don’t know it yet, as they haven’t told us. Unfortunately we will have to wait for that information.

**When is it releasing?**

According to the [most current official information](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/06/10/eso-on-next-gen-consoles-and-new-gameplay-trailer), Elder Scrolls Online is intended to come out in Spring 2014 on console and PC platforms.

**Getting into the beta**

[Apply at the beta application page](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/beta). Some people have gotten confirmation emails, some have not. If you're having trouble with confirmation mails, check out [this informational thread about lack of ESO beta confirmations](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1k4omb/attention_if_you_did_not_receive_a_confirmation/) from /u/Vinshati.

**What's the status of beta?**

Elder Scrolls Online is currently in closed beta under a Non-Disclosure Agreement for its participants. There is no news of open beta at this time.

**Will there be co-op?**

Yes, it will be similar to a typical MMO. PvE will take place in your alliance territory, where you can quickly group up with people around you, or just play side by side with a random player. When you wish to play PvP, you simply go into the province of Cyrodiil where the Alliance War will take place. AvA is the initialism for this, Alliance vs. Alliance.

**What will AvA be like?**

In Cyrodiil, there will be keeps to defend and battlefields to be bloodied. The alliances will be able to buy siege weapons to assault keeps and other various tools to defend keeps when they have them. It will be a jump in jump out type of system (source?) where you may enter Cyrodiil and run to the aid of your alliance. The so-called “best” PvPer will be crowned Emperor.

**Which Classes Can I Play?**

There will be Templars, Dragonknights, Sorcerers, and Nightblades at launch. That being said, these are just starting points when building your character. You can put skills in your character however you want to progress them. These classes will have specific abilities, but for the most part you can build your character how you want.

**Will there be dragons?**

No there will not be dragons, not as far as we’ve been told.

**Is everyone on the same server?**

Playstation gamers will have their own server, Xbox gamers will have their own, and PC and Mac gamers will have a server. Each platform has its own “megaserver” where all players will be located, though probably in shards or what have you. Each region (NA/EU) will have separate megaservers.

In my opinion, a buy to play model is the way forward for this game, if it is done correctly (No pay to win etc.) But I wanted to hear your views. "	t5_2tqi0	True

We are all eager to play and hopefully we can still do so later this year by participating in the beta. Really, please feel free to take all the time you need. 

Also, good work overall. The game looks very pretty. Please use this extra time to really tighten up the character animations, which I thought could look more fluid and natural, and polish up a long list of other things. Perhaps you now have enough time to add the thieves guild and a fully implemented crime system at launch?

Although I will be playing ESO on my PC, thanks for including the console gamers. Skyrim was great example of a multiplatform success and I know your team can do it again. There has been some talk of the ease of porting it to the next gen consoles because of the x86 architecture and I certainly hope this is the case. We were all expecting the game to be delayed anyways, so I firmly believe that the game was not being delayed solely due to consoles. 

That said, by the divines please make sure that you have a UI specifically designed and separate for PC/MAC. It was obvious that Skyrim UI was crippled for PC because it was designed for both PC and Console. Thanks to SkyUI it is better, but I really hate it when you are playing a PC game and it is obvious that compromises were made to make the UI for both PC and console. I know we can mod the UI via LUA but you still need a very strong UI out of the box for PC. I think the UI looks sexy and unobtrusive but don't be afraid to redesign it even late into the development of the game. 

Lastly you really need to make sure that your game has something unique because I've played Neverwinter and it seems that they beat you to the punch. They have very similar style of combat. So you really have to think critically about what is going to set your game apart from the other games that are in this Genre. Having a high quality true TES first person combat will go a very long way to keep players feeling immersed and make the game feel unique. 

One reason why I stopped playing other MMOs was because I did not take them seriously as a premium product I could see myself playing long term. This is mostly because the lore behind the game was sparse and I did not feel immersed. That's one reason why WoW was so successful was because of the depth of lore behind it, and I know that the lore for Tamriel is just as big if not bigger than the amount of lore WoW had before launch. 

A lot of people myself included are watching this game and we think your game is either going to be a massive success, game of the year etc etc, or a lackluster title that did not live up to its full potential. only time will tell which one it will be! Again, having oodles of meaningful end game progression content for both pve and pvp can go a long way to keeping people hooked and retaining subscribers, but it is the experience, the total immersion in the world of Tamriel, that is your #1 selling point. 

Thanks"	t5_2tqi0	True

One of the things I posted on the ""Skyrim"" subreddit was that Argonians need a more distinctive swim animation; but really I feel the choice of race should have a greater impact on gameplay than the little bits of text that explain the distinction in lore - they are different beings with different physiologies and this needs to be explored to a greater extent in all future Elder Scrolls games.

There are a few mods I would recommend installing if you want to play the game and not be frustrated by the clunky decade-old gameplay.

*****************************************

[**Morrowind Overhaul - Sounds and Graphics**](http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/36945/?): This is really just a massive compilations of mods. It is on the nexus, but you do not need the NMM to install. Just open up the file and run the installer and you'll be good. [Tutorial.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuOeWG4BXLI)

[**Always Hit Morrowind**](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=7898): The Morrowind combat actually features a hit/miss system based on percentages, something we don't see anymore. This system is extremely infuriating in low levels because you never actually hit anything. Installing this allows for a smooth transition from future TES games back to Morrowind.

[**Magicka Regeneration**](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=4991): As it states, this is a mod that allows your magicka to regenerate. It also gives you options to increase or lower the rate at which it regens. This will help all you mage-like characters.

[**How to install mods.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0y3BHVpjYQ)

**********************

No this is not ESO related, but with the post yesterday notifying us about the sale I thought it would be common courtesy to help the newbies who never played Morrowind. Yes, there are **tons** of mods out there. I have at least a dozen more on top of the three above, but I thought these to be the most essential to a new player.

Good luck and have fun you future Nerevarines!

**Do Not:**

* If you are a beta tester, do not post AMAs, Q&amp;As, ""show-n-tells"" or reveal any other type of NDA violating material. Just don't do it. You will be banned.

* Do not link to leaked beta information or material.

* Do not link to sites whose primary purpose is revealing leaked beta information or material.

* Do not promote breaking the NDA, ask for others to break the NDA or request information leading to NDA-breaking material/sites as defined above.


**You Can:**

* Discuss leaked information, but only while observing the rules above.

* Link to major news sites (PCGamer, Massively, MMORPG.com, etc.) that report on leaked material. Moderators reserve the right to remove these links if they violate any of the rules above.


And please remember -- the NDA is only temporary. It's not exactly fun for us to enforce, but we feel that it's the best option to build the foundation for a long-term community.

it's a very good at explaining basically what the NDA consists of and that it's a fairly standard one. But i wanted to point out some stuff that i feel like he missed(and echo some he said) in a very simple and straight forward way. And mostly in terms of what you need to do to KEEP you in the BETA.

* If you get in, you cannot say anything about it. To anyone. Don't come to the Subreddit and be like ""OH hey, awesome day. I got that '*pony*' i wanted to buy! Wink Wink, Nudge Nudge. Talk to you at launch!"" That could get you booted.

* Feedback becomes theirs: If you make an amazing suggestion or feedback regarding some aspect of the game, and they adopt it, you get nothing. Good day sir. Yet you are still in beta, and just maybe they will internally know who you are and what you said that got something changed.

* in regards to the verbiage about badmouthing the game: This obviously applies to on the internet and in the media. But even more so, in the BETA testing world. You will have access to private forums to discuss the beta as well as in game tools to report bugs and thoughts. you will have access to the developers. If you have a good relationship with them based on constructive feedback, they will know you as a group. If you post feedback saying, ""This beta is  shit, how do you expect to make a profit on this shitty game!?!&gt;!"" or ""OMG why haven't you fixed this gamebreaking bug. do your jobs."", you will likely find yourself out of beta. 

* in regards to and screenshots: Don't take them. Chances are the in game bug reporting tool takes one and other information when you submit. Don't take them. Don't take them, put them on IMGur, and then post it on the Beta forums so a developer can see the broken bug. Seriously. That crap happens. You will get booted from beta if you do that.

This is pretty much it. The NDA is straight forward. Say NOTHING. Plain and simple. 

The privileged of beta is making the game better, you do not deserve and will not get anything in return for playing a beta. In previous betas, lots of people wanted some special reward for playing. And it was always a split decision with the beta populations. The TESO FAQ said they want to make a gift for beta testers. I assure you this is a first. It's all good, but in the end if they decide not to give a gift, that would be fine too. 

You are not a unique and special snowflake. Enjoy your time if you get in, and some pride at being one of the lucky few who can really help the game. Don't expect more. Hope this post helps.

EDIT: This is general guideline for new people who do not want to break NDA. if you do, I can't stop you, though I don't think you should.

(I would personally put hits out on all of my friends and be rengar up in this bitch) I think a mechanic that auto flags the target would make the prey aware that he is being hunted but also make it so that the db assassin can kill his prey in any location. This would be an interesting mechanic to say the least and seems as if it would be simple to implement if there will also be same alliance duels just a simple tweak of dueling can make this assassins fantasy a reality!!	t5_2tqi0	True

* Something Slightly different but nothing drastically revolutionary?

* Something completely new that we haven't seen before in an MMO before or very few at least?

Guild Wars 2? It was gold rather than challenging content that gave you the best items to flaunt. 

So where do we draw the line between accessibility and competitive game play? Do others feel the combat system will prevent advanced mechanics coming into play and mainly focus on mobility? What are your thoughts and expectations for raids?

Still, the Nazis were real, and they did terrible things that leave scars to this day. There are many who feel uncomfortable about the name being thrown about so lightly. I know those of you who have been making the comparison mean no offense, but perhaps a subreddit for a game is not the best place to stir up those emotions.

I won't be censoring anyone, as long as the discussions don't get overtly offensive, but I'd like to ask everyone to exercise some restraint with this issue.

- The graphics were great, incredible for an mmorpg
- The environment was grand, beautiful, and diverse
- The combat looked difficult which is good. When the guy was alone he struggled with killing 2 enemies. A positive in my mind
- The GUI was great. There was very minimal UI and the UI that was there can be removed (in case people were complaining about that)

I'm not even sure if this is possible with the hotbar they've talked about over and over again but I think about how some of the coolest and most entertaining spells in previous TES games weren't the ones that did damage. Some that immediately come to mind are those that fall under Mysticism and Alteration in Oblivion like Water Breathing and Telekenisis.

I know a lot of these kinds of spells couldn't be implemented in a MMORPG format but the idea that everything I can unlock HAS to serve a combat purpose seems kinda. . . bland to me.

Also the voices you hear while fighting are very repetitive and get pretty annoying. The game also doesn't seem to follow the traditional ""less GUI is better"", there's a hotbar and some names on the side that are kind of distractive. The combat and animations are very disappointing but the game itself looks amazing. The magic looks nerfed from other games too.

I don't want to sound like a pompous ass or 'I are higher then though', sorry if it comes off that way. Yet I've looked into two threads so far and seen violations all over the place.

Please remember, you mentioning these things starts implanting the ideas into peoples heads. You may think you are mentioning minor details or it won't hurt, but it does and an idea can quickly spread and grow into it's own behemoth. Whether people vocally call for the system/mechanic, or it's just a common consensus that 'that's how it'll be done', the more we passively or aggressively support an unofficial system the more likely it's to not be changed/removed (when necessary). They are reading what we say, and they are trying to figure out what we want.

For example, the idea of first person, I believe this sprouted from Matt Firor or Paul Sage's small comment on TESO being a TES game first. This lead many to instantly assume we were getting first person, among many other things. When many found out this was not the case, a shit storm occurred, we now have first person, but we forced the developers to implement this. Hooray for first person, but this isn't always a good thing for us or for the devs. This most likely draws from their resources elsewhere which will over all hurt the game and the pipeline for their work. 

We don't want another SWTOR now do we?? Let's let them finish the game and not have to worry about meeting new expectations we set by revealing key bits of information and leading others to believe this is permenant. Your words can do a lot more damage then you think, so please give them (the devs) the freedom to work with the game. 

TL;DR: Remember YOU got invited to beta test to give them your input! You are the voice of what features TESO could have. Implanting an idea into the community that something will be in the game will only deter Zenimax from improving, altering, or removing such features when necessary, especially when the community becomes vocal about the system, or everyone starts off-handlely saying it's going to be in the game.

Just wanted to remind you what we're here for, and let the newer beta testers know the extent of their disinformation. Thank you. Hope I wasn't a douche.

What should we worry about and then? Anything core mechanics related. Did you enjoy or dislike the way the different skill trees worked, or that you gain experience from exploration. Do you find the soft targeting or quick weapon switching neat and good for the game, or a bit distracting and taking away from immersion. Was the over all feel of the locations and story elements they showed on or off base? Do keep in mind that this is an MMO, and thus they do have to step aside from traditional TES games to make it work.

What should we not worry about? Polish. Any animations, or textures, or GUI features. I noticed with the bow, it felt a bit strange with the animations as the guy switched between his bows and the spells, with the animation canceling early to switch over. Some of the attack visuals felt a bit off as well, and the sounds in battle seemed repetitive. This is not something to worry about though! Most of these seem to be temporary place holders. As the core game is finished and balanced, they will be touching these up and putting a bow on everything. 

TL;DNR: Don't worry about the little things, like the animations, sounds, or textures just yet.

My question would be ""Why?"", is it because people have not seen all 3 leaks and they are forming their opinion on the latter, or do ppl enjoy jumping on a negative bandwagon more then positive, or perhaps the 20 min leak was purposely done badly and leaked way more because ppl were dying to say ""hey look look this game sucks"".

I would like to hear what you guys think.

------------------------------------------


I have not been in the Betas, so the dates below are all educated guess assuming events are on weekends as they have mentioned they would be in the beginning. Dates are purely conjecture based on Past Beta experiences: 

**Facts:**

As of this post(10:20 am EST April 23) we have had 2 beta events. 

* Invites Tues March 26 for 30/31 event
* Invites Tues/Wed April 9/10 for 13/14 Event

**My Theory:** 

Amendment 1(5/1/13) - been a few weeks since an event. Next event will have large changes in the gameplay to reflect data and feedback from the 2 events.

That schedule puts us on for invites to ~~go out this evening~~. I fail, no invites tonight

If this schedule keeps up with expanding groups, my timeline looks like this:

* Bi weekly beta events through the **middle of June**

* **Mid june,** they will need to start testing leveling. So while small events may continue, they will need to have a group of people leveling higher and higher. At this point we will start seeing extended tests.
* **mid summer**, a true long term Beta will open for leveling, dungeons, etc. Occasional wipes, but long term goals and players will be used.
* **Early September** will see a broad invite heavy test of Cyrodil. This will still be covered under NDA, but will generate a lot of hype either way as they ramp up for launch.
* **Late September** or early October will see open beta and Stress test. NDA is lifted. 

All of this leads to a late November release, possibly early December. Publishers like to get their games available for the Xmas season sales. This is all unless of course there is a major problem with development and  a delay.

--------------------------------------------
tl;dr: Beta phases through the end of summer, Open beta in autumn, release late November.

So a small question: for you, **what makes healing fun?**


For me, what makes healing fun is actually quite similar to what makes 'doing damage' fun, but with a different attitude and management priorities.
Single target healing spells necessitate that we almost create a small 'rotation' for our healing, and this is so much more enjoyable than simply pushing a button when I'm around a lot of people.
In PvP scenarios this is especially challenging and fun, because you have to manage your resources constantly. Not only for healing, but your CC tools and damage abilities. ESO is a different game, don't get me wrong, but if there are single target damage abilities with soft targeting, there should be single target healing abilities with soft targeting.
Why? Because its fucking fun to skill shot heal specific people, and an incredibly skilled healer can differentiate themselves really well.


I personally think it's a huge mistake to have a simplistic healing model similar to Guild Wars 2. Not hating on the game, but that style completely discouraged me away from my favorite role because the skill-cap was incredibly low, and it was just boring to be honest. 


Adding some soft targeting single-target healing spells that are powerful, that we can aim, would be incredible. "	t5_2tqi0	True

Personally, I will either choose Armorsmith or Enchanting to specialize in.

Is that going to give you viable gear for the endgame?

The reason that I gather that ppl want RNG is they want the top weapon but have it different than other ppl that have the same weapon, and they also feel it adds longevity to the game, cause ppl will continue to grind to get that piece of gear that has slightly better stats than what they have right now, but it also brings in the issue where you can get some really bad gear that is worse than other pieces that are a lower tier.

Now for gear with Static results like WoW, once you get the gear, there is no longer any reason really to run that raid, other than just for fun or to help guildies. 

So now that I have rambled on for a little bit, here is my idea, What if you did get your static gear that you got from raid bosses, like most other MMO's, but when you run the raids you also have a chance for some rare drops that you can use in crafting to further customize your gear, so you can add more stats of your choosing, all of it based on your crafting profession, so it will still give you a reason to raid even after you have all of your gear, and it keeps crafting viable and useful endgame."	t5_2tqi0	True

I would like to present a question of minor interest that I have been pondering for quite a while.

As we all know, just about all the Elder Scrolls games have included the dark side of Tamriel known as *skooma*, whether it be with random encountered dealers coming up to you and offering the narcotic, or you finding it in a addicts house, or even on your way in a questline.

Now, since we will be able to travel through most of Tamriel in ESO, such as the province of Elsweyr, home to the Khajiit who use one of the main ingredients of skooma, *Moon Sugar*, on a daily basis. Or even Morrowind, which is presumed to be a major manufacturing area for producing skooma and its varieties.

So, I ask you this question, do you think there will be any large quest, or even side quest, on the topic of narcotics, particularly skooma? I mean, what's an Elder Scrolls game without skooma?

Playstation 4 is second in line as expected, and will house a substantial amount of players.

Also, these results could very possibly be completely meaningless! No doubt this sub-reddit holds some bias, existing long before the announcement of a console port.

And finally, do these results make you want to change platform? Are there some PC players who were worried about empty PS4 servers, but are now willing to change? Are there some Xbox One fans that now see that their server will comparatively abandoned and want to make the switch to PC or PS4?

I see a lot of terminology that I've had to google to check if my guess was right about what it meant here and there, so do more people come from other MMO's?  From playing Skyrim?  Or playing all the Elder Scrolls games through the years?  And how deep are you into the history and lore of the world?

The reason I ask is that I'm trying to figure out whether I'll enjoy the game or not.  I come from Skyrim (though have played a little of Morrowind and Oblivion in the past) and I've never played an MMO. The only online team games I've played is COD on xbox with a clan for a couple years.  I've seen concern among lore-focused folks over this game and even though I do love the rich history, I haven't seen anything that has turned me off in that way yet.  And although I enjoy fighting against people sometimes and playing as a team, I enjoy the exploration part of ES games more than fighting other players.

So in other words, I can't figure out what to expect in ESO and I'm trying to judge where some of the people hyped for this come from game wise to find some common ground.  I sometimes feel like, with all the MMO talk that flies around quick here that I'm out of my element.

1363826963.0	1ap9zk	Concerned that First Person Perspective with visible hands will be a huge waste of time and money	ForceStrategy	32	12	82	"Hear me out.

I am fully aware of the fact that first person perspective is how nearly everyone has played Elder Scrolls games in the past, but for ESO I'm afraid its going to be a wash.

The fact of the matter is when playing with groups of people in any MMO situational awareness is of the utmost importance. First person perspective by its very nature severely limits your moment to moment awareness. While engaging in combat you simple cannot see what is taking place to your sides or behind you, and anyone who has participated in group play in MMOs knows that seeing what is going on beyond the thing directly in front of you is key.

Certainly people could spin around in circles to see what is taking place...but when doing that, you're not exactly being effective in combat (ie. hitting your target). While first person has worked perfectly fine in prior Elder Scrolls games, I feel this is largely due to the fact that combat is quite basic, and has you facing only a few enemies (1-3) at any given time. This is easy to manage while just seeing what is in front of you, my expectation however (and this may be wrong) is that like most other MMO's, ESO group play will include a higher volume of enemies and dangers to be avoided (fire, traps, additional mob spawns) then what we've seen in other Elder Scrolls games, which will make first person perspective inefficient and ineffective. 

This all leads me to believe, that upon realizing how useless first person perspective is in group play (and don't even get me started on how terrible it will be in PvP) a majority of players will simply play in third person. Making all this time and money Zenimax is spending on the inclusion of arms and weapon/spell animation a huge waste, which is likely the reason they opted to exclude it in the first place. Time and money that could be spent on improving other aspects of the game.

Thoughts?

AFAIK we're not sure how it will be, but I feel it's an extremely important topic.	reid8470	21	1	19	"To me, movement is one of those key factors that makes or breaks MMOs. Take a look at a game like WoW, for instance. You have, albeit unrealistic, 100% free movement. It gives you a sense of complete control, and has no sense of limitation by the default game movement. I've tried several MMOs that don't have 100% free movement but still looked very promising during the beta, such as TERA. TERA's movement was slightly 'realistic' in the sense that you couldn't turn in mid-air or off of a jump--you kept moving in the direction that you initiated the jump with. It also had slowed/realistic turning, whereas WoW has instant turning in any direction. 

There's been some speculation (if anyone has a confirmation, please do share) that the movement will be similar to Skyrim, and this part has me slightly worried. Skyrim's movement is great for a PvE game but the slight delays on turning and such could be problematic in a PvP environment. 

Again, maybe my worries are wrong and once I try it i'll find that it's alright, but I really hope the devs put a ton of focus into a very responsive UI and clean, quick movement control. It's one of the first things you notice when you start a new game, and having players feel like they have complete control of their character should be a huge priority."	t5_2tqi0	True

That being said, I'm seeing a lot of red flags that make me very wary of this game (based on [these details](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=472749)):

Voice acting (starts interesting, becomes mind-numbing),  generic PVP, themepark hand holding, quick leveling (120 hours?), a questing system identical to what we're all bored of with slight differences, button smashing, faction grinding.. ugh.

Surely I'm not the only one tired of developers taking WoW or its clones and forcing a game that doesn't fit the genre down its throat.

&gt;  If I'm tapped out, I’m high level. I've played through all the alliances, or I want to take a break from playing through the alliances and I want to go to some other high level content, I'll go there. And I'll know there are people soloing at max level. We probably won't use the term “raid” but a large group, large encounter, there will probably be people there recruiting for one. There’ll probably be a looking for group system so you can just go right there; those are the things you're doing. I can go do a daily, get a quest to do something right there, that's the kind of stuff you're talking about.

This actually doesn't sound like a terrible idea. The only thing that concerns me is how far out from launch these adventure zones will be implemented. If you look through my comment history for the past few days you can see I've been passionate about including traditional style raiding, and I may have been belligerent. I like to think and say that I'm open to new things, but Firor's choice of words in the interview where the stated there would be ""no raids"" set me on edge. 

All we needed was clarification, and now we have it. At least I think we do. I am slightly uneasy about the lack of any mention of instanced raid content, as I still think this promotes competitive progression raiding, but I do like Firor's concept. That being said, let us raiders take some advice from our fellow ESO players and wait and see how this develops."	t5_2tqi0	True

This would pretty much mean that instead of them just appearing, or being instanced, everyone in the area would see a cut-scene of the portal open up and a huge anchor shoot through, or maybe make it real-time (and possibly do damage if they hit you?) I just think it would be a cool feature and also make people want to go after them if they just happen to be walking by.

Adventure Zones are endgame areas that will contain PvE elements such as: Non-storyline quests, open world dungeons, instanced dungeons, and group bosses. They will add to progression at max level, and can be repeated multiple times for xp.

Now, I paraphrased of course, I don't even recall the specific place where I heard it (I listen to a lot podcasts and the info gets jumbled together in my mind). Does anybody have a legitimate source for this? Or even a non-legitimate?

That is when I stumbled across this post on TamrielFoundry.com made by Terminus Zaire (Aldmeri Dominion, goes to show that we are the smartest). His map consist of what areas are confirmed to be accessible along with speculation using lore. 

For instance, many wonder if the city of Leyawiin would be a conquerable city in Cyrodiil but the history of the city suggest it may still be apart of Elsweyr and doesn't become annexed by the Imperials until the 2nd Age.

Then I remembered PvP has the highest ranked PvP player crowned Emperor.  
  
So I ask this: Do you think everyone should be able to join these guilds and become the Arch-Mage/Master, or should the title be given to only the highest ranked member of the guild? Or more strangely, have the title reserved for NPCs? 
I know this requires some sort of ranking system for these guilds, but do you think this would be a good idea?

One of the reasons I'm so excited about playing ESO is because of the 3-faction system they've adopted, which leads to massive amounts of fun when it comes to PvP.

My first encounter with this system was in Dark Age of Camelot (DAOC), which was easily the best PvP experience I've ever had. In DAOC, there were three factions: Albion, Hibernia, and Midgard. When you entered the PvP area, you entered from the ""gate"" between your faction and the PvP area. The gates were spread wide and far with many a castle/capturable points in between. (Note: the castle raids could take hours, but were so satisfying.)

The 3-faction system is incredible because it breaks the mundane mold of fighting for control points, which basically turned into a tug-of-war. It's infinitely more fun when you introduce a third party. There would be times in DAOC when Albion and Midgard would be in the midst of a huge battle only to have a pack of Hibernians storm in and wipe everyone. It adds an element of complexity, strategy, and pure fun (not to mention the rivalries and notoriety formed between factions and by individually strong/sneaky players).

So, that's my take. Just thought I would share my exciting with all you fine people. I can't wait to see you all in Beta!

**TL;DR** Three factions means there's a hell of a lot more to do/stratagize for/whatever when it comes to PvP. It's an all-out 1v1v1 funfest."	t5_2tqi0	True

I was wondering if someone could clear this up for me. If the ESO story begins in 2E 578 and Tiber Septim begins the Tiber Wars in 2E 896 does this lead to the possible assumption that the Ebonheart Pact eventually wins? The reason I ask is that we don't know how long the Alliance Wars cover, but we know in 300 years a son of Skyrim unifies the entirety of Tamriel. Shouldn't it stand to reason that at the least we know that either the Ebonheart Pact was not defeated or that the Alliances merely fought to a draw/were still fighting come 2E 896?

1364967522.0	1bkl5q	Quick question on the function of potions.	Lord_Z	19	3	6	"So I believe we know that you can bind a potion to a hotkey (q by default or something?) but how varied and diverse will the effects be? If it gets its own hotkey i would think that it will offer more than just health/stam/magika gain/regen. Do we know if there will be utility potions like speed boost, temp damage mitigation, attack speed, etc. I think that if the potion hotkey can function like a utility skill it will make alchemists more important and let you have a more interesting character setup. It would also be cool to see potions that have trade-offs, for example a potion of stoneskin may reduce melee damage by x% but slow you by x% and have visible character visuals.

1372285461.0	1h506y	See who you are/what you play	misobumblebee	15	0	10	"So I was thinking about the weapon swapping in the game and how it gives you the chance to be more than just a one role character. But wouldn't it be nice to show it off?
When you played Borderlands 2, you'll probably know, that you're able to have 4 weapons in choice bound to the hotkeys from 1-4 and everytime you swap to one of those, your last weapon of use will be resting on your back.
Or in Arma you're able to see what your loadout is (As much as you can carry).
The Elder Scrolls sample is found in the Skyrim mod ""armed to the teeth"". You're able to equip all your weapons at once and look like an arsenal of bad-ass (mule :P).
For me, this kind of optical choice, gives me an immerse feeling and other people will also know, what type of character I might be.
But how should it work? Well pretty easy in my opinion. If you have two twohanded you'll have them as an X on your back when you don't wield them. For 4 onehanded weapons you might have a set on your belt and the other one on your back (which we all love =D). And for the tanks... I mean the shield is on the back already I guess, why not add the sword/axe/mace to it?

I understand graphics are heavy nowadays and it can slow down frame rates drastically if it isn't done right, but it also pulls me out of the game to walk in a dead town that is technically packed with people, only having them ghost in on you when you're ten feet within their space.

For example, let's say you're a blacksmith that just started.  You have the knowledge to make a very basic and boring sword.  While exploring, you stumble across the plans for a new type of pommel.  Now you have two possible options for your sword's pommel.  Do you stick with the original one, or do you try out the new plan you discovered and have a sword that looks exactly the same except it has a different style pommel?

As you travel across Tamriel, you slowly build up your smithing plans.  You also discover new methods of smithing that allow the infusion of colors into your work.  You have even started to be able to mix and match styles to create your own unique sword.  As a member of the Daggerfall Covenant, you wield a sword that is largely of Redguard design, however it incorporates an Orcish cross-guard that you learned from an Orcish smith.  Or perhaps you use an Elven handle with a Khajit blade.  The possibilities are limitless.

I'm not sure if this is not possible for some technical reason, however CoD players get to customize their guns, why the heck can't I customize my sword?  It seems like such a no-brainer but I've never seen it done to the full potential.

I just feel this would make smithing so much more fascinating and introduce all sorts of possibilities.  Instead of crafting a generic sword, I could create something that is entirely my own.  So what do you all think?

Historically, third party VOIP programs (Team Speak, Ventrillo, Mumble, Skype, Axon, etc.) have been used in MMORPGs for voice communications. These programs definitely help with organized groups, but in many situations in PVP and PVE - you have to get somebody's attention, ask for help, or offer aid; people in your proximity are rarely in the same VOIP channel as you. Some devs have added voice chat systems that really just didn't turn out well. 

Will we be seeing a proximity voice chat, at the very least? Or possibly a more complex voice communication system?

1360490683.0	188pqc	Lessons learned from Guild Wars 2 and Diablo 3	tsarnicky	23	9	33	"I love the skyrim style open world, and I think the same idea worked beautifully in GW2.  After having played GW2 and Diablo for a while though there are a few suggestions / wishes I have for TESO. (I haven't had a chance to watch TES uncovered episodes so some of my suggestions may be redundant, please bear with me.  For the rest of the post I'll assume TESO will resemble skyrim).    

* I loved the Diablo elite system, unlike veterans and bosses in GW2 and other rpgs the diablo elite system allowed for genuinely different and unique experiences in each fight.  I remember the dev team mentioned something along the lines of making players employ different strategies versus different mobs.  I hope the dev team won't fall into the GW2 trap where they advertised the same idea, but in reality you could use the same weapon / strategy against every mob.
* I also loved the Diablo item system, please include some stat randomization in TESO! When I find a rare in GW2 I check AH and the 50 other listings remind me my find is nothing special.  In contrast the endless grind of Diablo was made rewarding by the fact that each item I found was -- or at least appeared to be -- unique.  
* The skyrim and GW2 style open world environment is great.  I think it could be improved though, I like the GW2 concept where some areas are definitely enemy territory.  In skyrim talk instead of one forsword camp there should be a whole forsworn territory.  The GW2 implementation should be improved upon though.  The OP in [this](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions/Taking-the-Dynamic-to-a-whole-new-level/) thread, and [my post](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions/Taking-the-Dynamic-to-a-whole-new-level/first#post1409089) summarize the changes I'd like to see.
* Gathering and crafting are unimpressive in GW2, this will probably require the most innovation to solve for the TESO team.   In my opinion the TESO team should concentrate on improving the gathering system.  As I mentioned in the thread I linked above, I think the crafting materials you find should improve as you move into more dangerous territory.  Elite mobs should drop special crafting materials. 
* I love the skyrim multi-class set up.  Please, please TESO team stay true to that system.  Again GW2 promised a great combat system with combo fields and weapon swapping, but it amounted to nothing (combo fields don't matter in most situations and weapon swapping isn't necessary).  The skyrim system as it stands is great, but in an ideal world I'd love to see TESO implement an improved version of GW2 combo fields and vindictus combo chains.  I have a (GW2) dream that I could start a fight as an elementalist, lay down combo fields then switch to warrior and wield a frozen or fiery sword by interacting with my elementalist AOE with warrior greatsword skills.

1359464411.0	17hrqr	Lets discuss how to break the mold of the standard MMO economy	wedge1378	17	2	31	"With all the changes to the ""Standard"" MMO schemes(1) that TESO is planning on challenging, I was noticing how there has been little word on economy. The only thing that has been mentioned is the death system. If you revive at the set spots, there is no cost, if you want to revive on the spot you died, there is a cost. 

Inflation is inevitable to a point, but the current model that previous MMOs generally use it similar:

* Gold IN: Quest completion(PVE/PVP), Monster kills, Selling ""Grey"" items

* Gold OUT: Gear repair, crafting reagents, travel, auction house deduction, extravagant yet pointless items(2)

In theory, if gold in is slightly higher than gold out, this will allow enough people to have money to start trading, which will in turn get the smart traders on the path to the top of the bell curve of wealth, and the poor traders on the bottom.

So i ask you fellow readers, how can TESO, or any MMO change this standard system? Is this a factor of an MMO that simply cannot be changed? What are your opinions.


1 - rotation based combat, hub and spoke questing, etc.

2 - This is an indication that some players have so much money, they couldn't spend it all, so i spend a lot of gold, for example, on ""dalaran brilliance"", which is a purely cosmetic thing."	t5_2tqi0	True

* To our older subscribers, what questions are you seeing a lot of in the comment sections. 
* To our new subscribers, what questions would you like answered.

**EDIT 1:**

This is the current list. Please give them a look and let me know if I have any wrong or incomplete information, or if the general structure and flow needs work. There is one question in particular that I can not reliably answer, and if anyone has more information on it I would love to hear it. I'm certain they discussed it in the OTR special podcast, but I'm hesitant to listen to the whole two hours this late at night. I will certainly do so over the weekend if no one else finds it.

**When will beta start?**

We don't know at this time, the official statement is soon^tm

**Are races restricted to one faction?**

Yes, all races are faction restricted. The Nords, Dark Elves and Argonians belong to the Ebonheart Pact, the Bretons, Redguards and Orcs belong to the Daggerfall Covenant, and the High Elves, Wood Elves and Khajiit belong to the Aldmeri Dominion.

**Are the Imperials a playable race?**

No, at launch all Imperials will be NPCs, many of whom will be hostile.

**Can a race leave their faction?**

No, races are tied to their faction.

**Are the territories faction locked?**

At this time territories are faction locked.

**Will there be PvP outside of Cyrodiil?**

There will be no PvP outside of Cyrodiil at launch.

**How big are the zones?**

There has been no official statement on the size of the game world.

**How will the controls work?**

WASD will control movement, and the mouse will control how you look. Main attacks and blocks are performed with the left and right mouse buttons, respectively. A hotbar consisting of five skills and one ultimate skill is controlled by the corresponding number keys. There are additional hotkeys for other actions in game.

**Will the holy trinity be in the game?**

*I need more info on this, if anyone has any*

**What will the system specs be?**

They have not yet been announced.

**Will the game be available for Mac?**

Yes, it will.

**What is finesse?**

Finesse is a resource that builds as a character performs well in combat, i.e. making contact with its attacks while avoiding the attacks of the enemy. Building finesse is essential for performing an ultimate skill, a very powerful ability. Building finesse also increases experience gains and may lead to a special chest.

**What is Synergy?**

Some skills have synergy. This means that a group member can perform special actions when your skill is in effect. An example of this is a channeled AOE lightning field cast by a mage that a warrior can enter and use to cast a powerful direct damage attack. Enemies are also able to utilize this.

**How will stealth work?**

A stealthed character will be rendered invisible to enemy NPCs and Players. At a certain range the character will become visible but obscured. When attacked, the character is completely revealed.

**Will the game be in first or third person?**

Both, the game will be third person by default, with an over shoulder view to assist in aiming. A first person mode with rendered arms similar to previous TES games will be made available, but the developers warn that respawns make this view dangerous.

**Will there be raids?**

The developers have stated there will be raids, but have not given more information beyond that."	t5_2tqi0	True

Will Skyrim and Morrowind have the same magnitude they do in their respective games, or do you think it will be condensed versions of each province?	theknightwhosays_nee	15	0	17	"I'm riding the fence about this game.  For one, Skyrim was my first ES game, and then I played Oblivion.  One thing alone stood out about these games than any other games I have played on xBox, respectively:  their maps are huge.  Recently I started re-playing Red Dead Redemption, and I smugly giggle at how I used to think it was a huge map.  Not hating on it, but comparatively speaking, it takes about five minutes to travel from Austin, TX to Mexico.

All of that aside:  I'm wondering what ES online will offer us in terms of Tamriel's size.  Will Skyrim be smaller, condensed down along with the other provinces in order to fit everything in, or will it hold the same massive beauty it does today?

At first I thought, ""Oh no this looks really cheesy and cartoonish.""  But not long after I realized that as long as the massive stature or Skyrim and other provinces are kept true to nature, the lesser quality of graphics won't bother me nearly as much as they do based on the most recent screen shots.

If these provinces are scaled down, I will be extremely disappointed.  But this is of course my opinion and by no means does it speak on behalf of anyone else.  I'm just curious as to what you might think about the issue?

So, lets talk about what type of system we would like to see implemented.

In a recent interview with Paul by Curse, ideas for a future crime system are briefly discussed. Paul makes a remark that he would like to see a way for players to get involved in tracking criminals down. This immediately got me thinking about Red Dead Redemption in which players would hunt each other down for bounties.

It's one of the things I loved in Skyrim and draws me into MMORPGs. That sense of wonder when you can see a mountain in the distance and then actually be able to walk to it. The last MMORPG I really was drawn into was World of Warcraft and one of the big reasons was that I wasn't always confined to an instance, unlike so many other MMOs right now. (Well, I was but the instance was all of the Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor). I loved that sense of awe  when I first walked through the gates of Iron Forge and didn't have to wait for a load screen.

I think this game has great potential, I'm just wondering if it will have one of the aspects I've always wanted in this style of game.

Now for my issue. The last game that I was super hyped for SWToR and I could find almost no bad comments or press about it leading up to release and I was in love. I ended up stopping playing because of lack of endgame and friends left.

I want to be super hyped and go crazy for ESO but th swtor release is making me nervous about being hyped for it. I understand that no game can live up to hype and I understand that, I just love beig excited for an mmo. And of course here and here I read negative things about ESO and it makes me a bit sad but that's to be expected.

I'm not sure if this is an easily answerable question but what should I do? Should I try to stay not excited? Should I let to and let ESO take over my brain to have more fun with anticipation?

1359573864.0	17ksxb	RE: No Pickpocketing	myskaal	15	2	20	"After reading part one of The Guardian's interview with Matt Firor yesterday, I wanted to bring up a point of discussion and see what others' think about this:
(the interview -&gt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2013/jan/28/elder-scrolls-online-interview-matt-firor)

""Pickpocketing's something that we have thought about doing,"" chuckles Firor. ""But there's a lot of complicated interpersonal relations stuff with that feature, and basically what it comes down to is the world's divided into these three alliances, where everyone in your alliance is your friend and everyone else is the enemy, and if you pickpocket one of your friends then can you fight them?""


The entire development team for ESO should be extremely familiar with EverQuest. I am not afraid to wager that many of them (including Matt and Paul) played it when it came out and for a very long time after. I would like to urge them to revisit that game's pickpocketing mechanic and argue that it is proof pickpocketing can be included in ESO without making interpersonal relationships as complicated as they think.

While pickpocketing in EQ was at first exactly the bit of a problem child Matt is thinking it can be, it was altered over time until eventually it worked off a separate loot table from what the victim had available to drop for players who killed them - so that no one felt cheated out of their loot. From what I am understanding about the loot system in ESO, this wouldn't ever be an issue because each player has their own loot table per enemy. The other way it was changed was to be made usable only on NPC's (and I actually don't recall if it ever was actually usable on players).

Granted, allowing the inclusion of same faction NPC's - such as city guards and towns people - could very well indeed open up a variety of complications (and/or possibilities dependent on your view point) but for the sake of simplicity it could be limited to commit on enemies.

You see, I want my girlfriend to play this game with me. We played EQ together. For a while we played WoW together. We haven't played a MMORPG together in a very long time. There just hasn't been one good enough for us to invest our entertainment time into again. I miss playing MMORPGs with my girl and I want ESO to be the one that brings us back to it again.

My girl loves to play a thief. It is her play style. It is how she enjoys games. She has accepted the limitations of roguely characters, as MMORPGs have progressed, to be less thief and more assassin ninja and she has had fun with them but she has never been able to invest herself in them the same way she could a thief who nabs the guards coin purses or nicks a goblin necklace as she sneaks through their camp. It's one of her top 5 favorite things to do.

So, I'm imploring you, ZOS. Please. Make my girlfriend want to play this game with me.

1370732689.0	1fy9bm	Will TESO break from previous ES games with concerns to magic, in favor of typical MMO effects?	neinmeinstein	26	15	40	"Usually when I play ES games I'll create at least one ""magic-hating barbarian"".  This is a persona that has had a long and proud history in fantasy.  It has always fit well in ES, since all I have to do is... *not use magic.*


However one of the most baffling trends in MMO's is to give *every* attack a magical effect.  It doesn't matter if you're a mage or a knight, thief or barbarian; inevitably all of your attacks will feature magical flashes of light and rainbow animations.  The worst part is that it begins right from the beginning.  You don't have to enchant weapons or cast spells.  Simply doing something that *should* result in a mundane effect (for example swinging an unenchanted sword), will result in this magical particle light show instead.


From what videos I've seen, this will be the approach in TESO.  Why is it that they're breaking from what has worked perfectly fine in every past ES game, in favor of something that makes no sense and just doesn't seem to fit the world?


Furthermore will special attacks in TESO automatically include this nonsense as well?  For example, Dragon Knights will be able to do the Scorpion-style ""get over here!"" chain attack.  Okay.  Will my character carry a chain around with him/her to explain it?  Will it be magical, and therefore completely out of place for my magic-hating barbarian?  


Perhaps I'm naive, but I've always felt ES games have been very good about explaining why you have the abilities that you do (shouts, spells, enchanting, alchemy, etc.).  It just seems so lazy and out of place to adopt the MMO magical light show.

I played abit of Morrowind, but oblivion was the one for me, anyway, Skyrim came out in 2011.

Say anyone who bought skyrim between the ages of 15-20 might not have played oblivion, and most proberbly not Morrowind.

So, say someone now is 17, take away 2 years for when skyrim came out, they were 15. I doubt they were playing oblivion when they were 10.

I'm not saying everyone, i'd say a high number.

So for alot of people, Skyrim *IS* The Elder Scrolls.

If they were a pc gamer, and had a good rig, to them, Elder Scrolls looked like this: http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/11/iBnczUueCozRc.jpg
Where as for me, elder scrolls graphics are: http://xbox360media.ign.com/xbox360/image/article/695/695763/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-20060314020608317.jpg

Again, stay with me abit longer. 

Somewhere, i forget where, there is a number of how many people wan to join which faction, and the one with the Nords (i forget the name) is the largest by like 10-20%.

Another point to factor in is that Skyrim is slightly odd compared to other ES games.

I can only really talk for Oblivion, so somone needs to let me know for Morrowind, but in Oblivion you were a prisoner, you got lucky and escaped and got caught up the Tiber Septum storyline thing. 
Tiber was the magic hero coming from modest background and he was the ""chosen one."" 
Skyrim you WERE the chosen one with a modest background.
Any decent writer will tell you that in fantasy, the ""modest background, oh wait you are the chosen one yay!"" story is cliche, old hat and ridiculous.
Oblivion (and i presume to some stretch, Morrowind) differed in that in Skyrim you HAD to become the chosen one, you HAD to learn the shouts because ONLY YOU could save the world. Oblivion i just kinda got caught up in it all and helped alot. 
My point is, Skyrim felt more like modern AAA games of ""go here, do that, you are the chosen one you have to do this!"" Where as the rest felt less forced. I know Skyrim you could go anywhere, but i've spoken to a few and i'm not the only one who thinks this.

This is where my theory all comes together. I have a feeling, alot of the hate is coming from these late teens who to them, elder scrolls is a heavily modded, beautiful looking Skyrim game where you are the dragonborn. So to them, yes the graphics look AWFUL, i mean why would anyone play it?! And to them, the Dragonborn is amazing, and is a nord (by the official videos/screenshots ect), so they will all want to be Nords. The nord thing only helps strengthen my idea the hate is coming from jumped up pc teenagers (here on known as JUPT)

So yes, to the JUPT, the game looks really bad, the gameplay isnt ""traditional ES"", aka: Skyrim.
But to everyone else, the graphics in Es games havnt been amazing outside of Skyrim, so we have grown up with lesser graphics but amazing storytelling to the point clunky animations and sometimes clunky gameplay havnt bothered us as much as they do modern day gamers.

TL:DR:- I think the hate is coming from ES gamers who only experiance has been Skyrim, and maybe modded at that, while the love is coming from older ES gamers who get that immersion and story makes up for lesser looking graphics.

this is the part of the conversation that i want you guys/girls to discuss about. Do you think its a good idea for a faction to be able to be completely pushed out of Cyrodil. Remember to take an Elder Scrolls from another faction you will probable need an army and siege another factions main keep. In order for an army to even get that far you will probably have to push a faction all the way back to their main base or you risk that faction becoming able to spawn at a keep that's at your back. Effectively trapping the army in between a keep and another army. So it's a good idea to take out all the keeps on the way to the main fortress each faction will possess. "	t5_2tqi0	True

1375996216.0	1jzdnv	You guys probably already figured out a ballpark average but how long does it take to traverse TESO in real time?	PhilxBefore	18	5	25	"According to [this question with a developer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-ZpNe5iredw&amp;t=1269)

You run at 6.5m/s and there are 9 'zones' each being about 3km.

If each zone were setup linearly, in a row, it would take 2770 seconds, or 46.2 minutes to run across the entirety of that area.

This is given that you can run in a straight line from end to end and there are no obstacles to go around. This also assumes that bodies of water do not slow you down, nor do different grades of elevation.

I doubt there is a current map of where each of these zones will be, but does anyone know what the realtime equivalent of running the longest, straightest route in Skyrim and Oblivion were?"	t5_2tqi0	True

How in depth will they all be?

The schools of Alchemy and Enchanting are crafting professions should translate really well from other TES games, maybe just tweaking for levels or strengths.
Same could probably be said about the other schools as well I guess. 

Well now to the reason I made this post: Personally I'm a big fan of the Illusion school, how will the Illusion school be used in TESO? How will the Calm, Fear, Courage, and Rage spells work in a PvP environment? Like buffs and debuffs? What about Invisibility?  Or sneaky for that matter. Yes they've said sneaking is in the game and that you get a bonus when striking from behind, but how will that translate into PvP? It's a lot easier to sneak around a NPC than it is around a player, even more so a player in 3rd-person? They said a player is harder to see when sneaking so does that mean that sneaking gives a innate level of invisibility or translucency? Which brings me back to the schools of magic, if sneaking makes you harder to see then will you still be able to use Invisibility spells or potions? Will the Muffle spell be in the game? Will we be able to get a perk to secretly cast spells while sneaking like in Skyrim?
One thing I would love to see is the Illusion school make actual illusions, an example can be for use as decoys Maybe some kind of persuasion spell, use NPC enemies to fight for you kind of thing. They have said that NPCs will be fighting players as well in Cyradil so I can see it being used in PvP.

Something that did make me squeal in joy was that ESO **does feature killcams**. I don't know how slowmo killcams work in a live game, but oh well.

So far, the system we have heard of is a *soft-lock*. So essentially, you aim in the general direction of your target, the game detects what you are aiming at, and the arrow flies right at him. The cons of this system include: essentially no skill in aiming, no special hit damage(ex. headshots do no extra damage), and you cannot evade the arrow once it is let loose and no one can intercept the arrow.

**Questions/Topics**

* Should the NightBlade have special bow-related abilities?

* Do you like the sound of the soft-lock system?

* Do you plan to run an archer character?

* Is the concept of no raids synonymous with ""No PvE Endgame"" for some of you?

* (For those of you who really want to see WoW/EQ style raiding in ESO**) If ESO has PvE endgame encounters requiring a larger group (~10+) of well geared and skilled players with a lack of instanced zones containing them, would it still turn you off of the game?

* When you consider an MMO's PvE endgame 'boring', is it the actual content, or a result of a boring combat system? 

* How well do you think EQ/WoW style raiding would feel in a game without targeting, auto-attacks, single-target healing and a rigid and defined trinity class and skill system?

* When starting an endgame experience in an MMO, what is more fun? Actually doing the content and performing the mechanics, or the social aspect of doing it with a group of your friends/peers?

* **How would you feel about a raid instance the size of whole zone, with quests related to the zone found in a town in that zone, with raid bosses of varying difficulty found throughout the zone, trash mobs and all?**

Indeed, at least one (Tjurhane Fyrre) was alive as late as 2E 227, and was known for writing about contemporary Ayleid culture.

To fill in a bit for the less lore-knowledgeable among us, the Ayleids were a type of mer or elf distinct from the Orsimer, Bosmer, Altmer, Dunmer, and Dwemer that we are more familiar with. They were a tribal society and probably did not possess a single monarch. They lived primarily in Cyrodil and formed an empire there based partly around the enslavement of the Nords and the proto-Human inhabitants of Cyrodil. They were overthrown by their slaves and their civilization was gradually wiped out in Cyrodil. Many or most fled to Valenwood or even Summerset Isle and were integrated among the Bosmer and Altmer, but some were rumored to remain, hiding in seclusion among the wild places of Cyrodil.

Discovering Ayleid remnants in the wilds in ESO seems far more likely to me than finding living Dwemer (with the possible exception of our friend [Yagrum Bagarn](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Yagrum_Bagarn)).

So I'll use EVE as my example. Dying in EVE sucks. Firstly, you lose your ship, which could cost anywhere from hundreds of thousands to billions of isk (currency) depending on what you're flying. On top of that if your safety pod  is blown up after that, you die and are cloned back, losing stat implants and possibly skills if you haven't upgraded your clone recently. This leads to interesting situations with pirates who sometimes hold people hostage for money or blow them up for the loot in their hull.

I don't personally feel a system quite like that truly fits in a hero based game but I do feel getting killed should carry loss. And really a repair bill and spawn wait just doesn't make you care, it's just inconvenient. As for another example,.back in Everquest, if you died you had to go find your body or your lose all the gear on it. So you could allow people to drag your body for you to help you out.  And this was a danger, when I was new I had some nice gear a guy gave me and died, some dude whispered me to help. 

He dragged my body deep into the woods and I never found it. I totally got scammed, and it was thrilling.

As for scamming, ninja looting, guild bank theft all seem to be attacked and punished, even by devs in some cases. I kind of don't get this.

Now hacking someone's account, perfectly legitimate reason to punish someone, but jacking all the money from the guild and joining another it's just in game espionage. And ninja looting is just screwing over people in s group or raid, but no rules were broken, only trust.

I'm not stupid, your one downvote won't make me think everyone hates this and since you've destroyed any chances of seeing whether people agree or not, I'll never know. So stop being a dick, let me see the 'light'**

What do you want from TESO?

 I'm interested to see what the general MMO community is interested in mainly ( that includes anyone now interested in this game [ one of us... one of...us]). After all this trinity talk it's made me wonder if people want a new game or a reskin of WoW (or something all too similar)? 

Speculation:

Sorry to put it so bluntly, and many of you WoWheads will take huge offense because you've played it for 10 years and you think that's what makes an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online 'X'). Understandably many of you think you are MMO veterans now, and think you know what makes a proper MMO. I know I sound like a huge dick, but it needs to be said. You are not, those of you whose experiences are limited to that game and similar implementations are heavily limited by the MMO world that has now surrounded you by Blizzard's game and successful business model. Many games have imitated WoW and that makes loads of people believe this is the only way to do an MMO properly. Yet what many of you forget is that this a business, and the people following that trend only do so to make a quick buck. So as we can all see, the market has been flooded with these clones. Do you really want another game with a threat system where one person holds every mobs attention while they conveniently ignore the dps/heals? We all know the trinity works, but that's my case with this question. It's been done, and perfected, we've seen it before. If it's done again you guys will be the loudest ones complaining and saying it's just like WoW and you'll be the first to jump ship and head back to WoW. So now that I think I have made the haters critically think before posting their heated responses on why it NEEDS to be in this game. Think please,  why do you want the same game?? 

P.S. After extra thought, maybe some of you are just tired of the content WoW produces, you're looking for new stories with the same game play. Yet, WoW cannot keep up with your consumption rate, if that's the case I don't think anyone will succeed and you probably need a break because you fail to realize the behemoth of all mmos cannot keep up with your addiction. (Remember guys! MMOs **are** addicitive and you have to remember why you're playing, is it for fun? Or are you trying to escape? If it's the latter you'll never find fulfillment in an mmo because it will never be able to supply you a real dynamic experience your soul yearns for. So go outside, fuck some shit up. Source: 13 years mmo experience) If this sounds like you, go ask Blizzard. 

Let other people have their game with new experiences and gameplay! If you want a better written WoW, I'm sure you could round up all the people you've brought to hate on anything that's different from WoW and beg Blizzard to hire new writers. Just some additional thoughts for you WoW people to think about before you come shit up what us TES fans want. I'm tired of you guys going to every MMO and pushing the developers to make the same game you're already playing and then hate on it once they give you bastards what you want. I'm sorry to anyone that can sense my hostility, but these things need to be said, you guys are douche bags.

Edit:

**TL;DR for the P.S.: Stop pushing developers to give you what Blizzard won't. Keep feeding Blizzard your money and gain support on their forums. We all realize it's easy to flood in and manipulate perceptions of what a new community wants on new MMOs. You should realize you're addicted and probably will never get what you want out of an mmo again, because an MMO will never continuously deliver what you are lacking in your real life. Stop being assholes and go ask for what you want from the people you've been paying for the past 10 years, they owe it to you. Stop shitting up other peoples hopes. This isn't WoW 2.0, it's THE ELDER SCROLLS *ONLINE***

Remember I'm asking for your opinions, so please tell me what you are looking for. All the dribble besides the questions is just for the WoW people to critically think.

DarthNibbles	12	0	16	My question is this:  During the 2nd era in which this will take place, how does the scope of race relations look?  There's a ton of lore and history put into these games, and at different times I'm sure the races of Tamriel have behaved differently.  For example, I know that later in the lore the Dark Elves have enslaved many Argonians for a labor force, and the Aldmeri Dominion took over much of Valenwood, the Wood Elves homeland.  When I see the different factions in the Elder Scrolls Online, I see these geopolitical conflicts come together, and I'd really like to know how each race came to be in an alliance with others in their faction.  So, when I see the Ebonheart Pact, for example, being comprised of Nords, Dunmer, and Argonians, I can't help but wonder how it is they came to work together, how they feel about each other, and how they feel about other races.  The same goes for the Daggerfall Covenant and the Aldmeri Dominion of course.

When this rule was removed, many players simply swapped to their characters on the realm that had the most relic bonuses or was ""winning"" at RvR at the moment.  Even with a moderate log in waiting penalty, any sense of realm community and motivation to RvR to bring victory to your ""side"" eroded quickly.

Personally, I plan on supporting the Daggerfall Covenant as a Redguard.  Ever since Morrowind I have loved playing as redguard and gotten a kick out of the racial bonuses as well as the lore.  After reading accounts of the Great War in Skyrim and seeing how the Redguard fought and punished the Aldmeri Dominion into a stalemate single-handedly after the white gold accord.  When I looked further into their lore and came across the history of Yokunda, the religion of the Ra'Gada, and the details of the Sword-Singers have all made me a faithful Redguard player.

How are some of these aspects going to fit into the game?

 **Ingredients**
 
* Some of the plants around the game are used for ingredients but how are they going to work in the mmo? Will they still only respawn after a couple days or will they have an infinite amount of uses and never need to respawn?

**NPCs**

* My favorite part of the game is that in most cases, I get to choose what npcs live and don't. I can just walk into town and slaughter a ton of the people. Will it be the same way in the mmo, will only some of the npcs be attackable, or will it be like most mmos?

**Combat**

* Will other players be able to walk up to an enemy I'm attacking and steal my experience? In situtations like this will experience be divided equally or only to a certain person?

**Loot**

* Is it going to be free for all? Will people only see their own loot similar to how Torchlight 2 works?  
Are chests going to make a return and if so, how are their content going to be divided up?

* What race do you plan on using for your first roll? And with that, what sort of playstyle will you attempt to go along with?

* What's on your agenda? Will you be grinding out levels until 50 to hop into the good fight at Cyrodiil? Or are you going to delve into the depths of some of the nastiest dungeons that Tamriel has to offer, spearheading through and felling the mightiest of subterranean foes? Or perhaps something different than the two?

* Will you join the ranks of some powerful and massive clan? Or will you go lone wolf, fulfilling your own agendas and abiding by solely your own word?

* What will the focus of your quest be? Going straight through the central questline? Maybe perhaps put off the main questline and go straight for the guilds, and knock those out of the way?

* Or will you be a sort of TES scholar? Slurping up, ( Perhaps even drowning in ) the massive sea of lore that will be provided in TESO? 

Either way, this game is going to have **massive** amounts of activities to partake in, bosses to be crushed, players to demolish in the blood-stained fields of Cyrodiil and the simple camaraderie of it all will just add onto the immersive and magical experience TESO is sure to provide.

Here's looking at you kid, may you take hours upon hours, days upon days, and perhaps months upon months hopefully of our precious free time.

This topic comes from /u/wedge1378, [the comment itself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1b0bll/with_a_torrent_of_new_information_i_would_like_to/c92n2sp)

The term combat queuing really means lining up attacks. Just like in a real queue(not to be confused with Qué or Cue) people wait in line for their turn at whatever they want to do. So in a game, you press *1 2 3* and your 3 action skills will line up and wait their turn to be executed.

Pros: This will allow for some interesting macros. From some alpha testing, we heard of the DK's fiery reach and slam abilities. So in theory you could press *1 2* and you would pull the enemy towards you and instantly stun him with slam. Macros have been a big part of MMOs in my experience, you see mice like the Razer Naga with 12 macro keys and keyboards with 20+. This also allows for very smooth chain attacks.

Cons: So far, once you cast the ability, there is no taking it back. You you hit your *1 2 3* macro expecting it to work, but suddenly the enemy is out of range and your fiery reach fails. Now you are forced to execute the other two moves, expending stamina/magicka and you accomplished nothing. 

**Questions/Topics**

* What experience do you have with macros in MMOs?

* Do you think combat queuing should even be in ESO? Would a truly live combat system flow better?

* What other combinations could you think of with macros? (ex. A Dk places a trap and then pulls a player into it with FR)"	t5_2tqi0	True

Healing in ESO is not like WoW, it is based on Cone AoE and not single target. Why they chose this? I really don't know, it may work, and it may not.

**Questions/Topics**

* Will you be playing a Templar?

* What abilities should the Templar have?

* What weapon/armor loadout would most fit the Templar?

Guild Wars 2 and League of Legends have shown that a company can stay afloat relying only on micro-transactions. Even smaller companies like Grinding Gear Games(Path of Exile) have been profiting from purely aesthetic items bought with real money.

GW2 however, introduced a hybrid system. The Gem System. You can buy gems with real money, but you can also buy them with in-game gold. This allowed all players to purchase all items, but micro-transactions allowed players to accelerate the progress.

ESO has no publicly announced payment method(other options we will discuss over the next few days), and a real money store could be a viable option. Yesterday it was clear that a real money AH would be a *terrible* addition, but maybe something more official would be taken well.

**Questions/Topics**

* Would you condone a micro-transaction store if all items were purely aesthetic?

* What if you could buy stat boosting items(armor, weapons, etc.) that were available by normal methods?

* If you played GW2, did you appreciate the hybrid system that it implemented? 

* Do you think ZOS could be stable relying only on micro-transactions? Why or why not?

&gt; I think sneaking will be effective up to a certain level distance like in WoW. So if you’re very under leveled, you will probably still be spotted. I also believe sneak will drain stamina but this is where sneaking is upgraded. All classes will be able to sneak and initially it will cost a large amount of stamina to do so which limits duration for all classes to begin with. But certain classes will have passive bonuses within stamina so that as you add points into it, sneak will cost less and less stamina to use. Also, sneak cannot be used while in combat so opening attacks are important; BUT as before, certain classes may be able to sneak DURING combat after reaching a high level in stamina and at a much larger stamina cost. There may even be certain abilities available to specific classes that will put you in sneak if you choose to evolve the ability that way. As stated before, this is just a theory but one I’ve been thinking about for a while.

People can check out the zone and not have to deal with the world pvp. And the other side can have hours of fun with ganking people or keeping a small village like in other games. One simple solution 2 issues. It can bypass flagging for pvp completely. With some regulations on phase switching and some simple game ideas as city guards and stuff.  This could work and open the game up to not have faction locked zones. So people can experience the full game and have the immersion that is needed. Even the questing does not need to be unlocked in an enemies area just to be able to check out the scenery and it can give the feel of ""scouting"" or ""Invasion"" on an enemy factions territory for the pvp phase so to speak which is logical in a war when 2 sides are battling and i do not think it conflicts with the lore at all"	t5_2tqi0	True

So every time I make a character on an MMO, I usually tend to consider both these aspects.

Or do I want to make a character made to be as optimal as I can, even if it makes absolutely no sense (e.g.: heavy armor bow wielder, mage Nord), even if it is good.  
  
I am going to probably be making an Orc blacksmith, focus a lot of crafting and hammer wielding. It's a mixture of having an optimal character with following somewhat the lore of the game.

So as you all probably know, I'm the guy responsible for the CSS stuff. I want to preface this post by stating that I've never done CSS before in my life, and this was my first experience with it. Before this, I was mainly just a designer, that did templates and other small things, never any coding stuff. So, with that said, let me tell you where I've been, and what I'm doing.

- First off is the updated comment trees. RES decided to use a very silly method for comment trees, which makes it difficult for me to code around them. I've fixed this by limiting comment trees to around 10-15 comments before it asks if you'd like to ""continue reading) with a link to a context page.

- I'm looking into the Live Preview issues that are display a live background, that stuff is annoying to me, and I'm sure it's annoying to a lot of others as well.

- The big ""momma"" - RES.key-navelement. This is the stupid white background you see when you click on a comment and it basically blinds you. I have been trying to figure this out for months, and I haven't had any luck contacting any other subreddit designers to see if they know the issue. I've tried multiple methods that I know of to over ride the style, but I still can't figure it out. If you think you know what is making that display, please don't hesitate to send me a PM with the code correction!

- The notorious ""Light Theme"". So, back in May I told everyone that I was working on a Light Theme concept for you guys to switch between, similar to /r/leagueoflegends. Since then, I haven't really worked on it, mainly because since then I've gotten a full-time job as a UI designer. However, this isn't an excuse for me to cut the cord on something for the community. If anyone would like to help out with a light theme, or provide resources, or insight, please contact me via private message, or use modmail and we can discuss it.

- I also saw some people asking about flair. I believe we are going with console flair over faction, but I'm not sure yet - I would prefer faction flair. This has been tossed around for some time, and none of us can really make a decision. Maybe a community vote? :)

If you guys have any questions or concerns about the current theme, please post them here and I'll do my best to answer them.

Thanks,

I can gather that it DOES exist in some forms, but as to the exact extent, that seems unknown. Can everyone fast travel to waypoints the way they can in skyrim/oblivion? That seems likely from what I read, which is sad because that really kills MMOs immersion in my personal opinion.

Do we know if ""lore immerse"" forms of travel are still expected to be the dominant travel mode? (I. E., fast travel takes you to only a few, very broad areas and you will still be required to mount up/ride a boat/hire a real time carriage to get around mostly?)

It seems like what I've read points to them wanting to minimize linear travel as much as possible, all but forcing players to take the long road and get distracted by tons of content all along the way. I 100% support this and find that games which allow players to afk past all the content (cough cough WOW) are not nearly as immersive as the games where traveling and exploration are just as important/fun as any other function of the game.

Will they implement an arena? I know many are turned off with this but many people i play with share the concern. Hey if it doesnt it doesnt, its just a concern with me. Other games have Arenas, however those are not Elderscrolls! Im going to play wildstar just based on the fact it has arena but i see it as a side game for me. ESO will be my main focus to play in the long run. My concerns come based on that fact.
_______
Secondly, knowing they will have certain zones locked for future content, will ESO ever develop more areas for an expansion? It seems like they wont be able to due to lore restrictions. this takes place 1000 years before the original games and the maps are already made. They cant really just add a new continent and say it was forgotten.

In Oblivion, we aided the emperor and in Skyrim we killed him. But we have never stood atop the White Gold Tower and gazed at our Empire, until now.

ESO will feature a system that will crown the MVP of the winning faction as Emperor. We have heard that a single campaign could take *months*, so once you win your title, you aren't leaving anytime soon. They system they use is called *Alliance Points*. I assume it is similar to Honor from WoW, so the more you participate, the more points you earn.

Being emperor will bring bonuses to your Alliance. They have been pretty vague about the details, so we just have to assume.

**Questions/Topics**

* Do you like the idea of a player emperor?

* Can you imagine a scenario where one guy(or guild) is emperor indefinitely? 

* Do you think healers will have a chance at becoming emperor?

* What bonuses do you think being emperor should give you(if you are emperor)?

* What bonuses should the winning alliance gain? Should they be limited to Cyrodiil and PvP?

1363975769.0	1at908	Doing End-Game Right - how TESO should change	artie290	18	11	55	"I have been an MMORPG/TES player for the last 12 years, actively playing, beta testing some of the best MMOs out there. I have listened to most of you address the recent news of no raids and wanted to contribute my thoughts.

I was not surprised to hear that there are not going to be large raid content for launch. It was hinted earlier when they described healing spells as only cone and aoe. It is hard to design raid content when you can't single heal your tank. ZOS has major flaws within the current design of the game, and it is going to be difficult for them to change the game enough to introduce raid content. This of course makes me sad, not because I wanted to raid in this game, but because it will reduce the overall population of the game. I know my friends are hardcore raiders will not even get this game because of that.


**The Solution**

**option 1 (not likely or preferred) Release game as currently designed with a B2P model with a shop similar to GW2. While this is not my preferred solution, it would still make for an amazing TES game. It would also make a great RvRvR game that I can play anytime I feel the pvp/crafting bug, because lets face it most mmo players demolish single/group player pve content quickly.**


This option will make them enough money to recoup most of the costs of development. This is unlikely to happen due to the business model ZOS had in mind when they started this project. It is also unlikely due to developers desire to create additional content post launch in a non expansion format. I can offer no proof of this, as ZOS is not a public company, I don't have access to their financial statements. I can however based on the size of their studio, the years this game has been in development, their marketing expenses for the game and the collected information to date make this educated guess.


**2.(likely and preferred) ZOS will launch TESO with an online subscription model costing anywhere between $12-16 USD per month with 30 days free when you first buy the game. Furthermore they will most likely offer beta access to pre-orders much the same way that GW2 did.**

In order for this game to be successful as subscription based. They have to cater to EVERYONE. This of course puts TESO in direct competition with the most successful MMO of all time World of Warcraft. This means that TESO will need to introduce the following content post launch.

a) PVP Arenas (lore friendly)

b) Structured PVP (can be lore friendly faction v faction pve objective based)

c) Raiding (lore friendly,  Matt Frior is wrong, he is not a TES expert. How about actually asking TES fans?)

It will be difficult but possible for ZOS to change TESO enough to support these systems. I believe WOW does all of these things fairly well, but there are areas for improvements where TESO could really shine. The problem us non raiders have with raids is that they get better items through raiding then we do through gathering/crafting/pvp/group content. I believe that this problem can be fixed with a loot system that equalizes the time spent on each activity. Raiding instances shouldn't drop gear, but rather quantity of mats to be used to craft or improve gear horizontally or vertically through professions. The same mats can be gathered through questing, pvp, spvp, apvp and rvr pvp albeit at a much slower pace to reward the raiders for their ability to play well in a group and defeat functional, fun and challenging raid content. I realize the loot drops are not lore friendly but I just don't see how anyone can find it unfair.

I was going to include #3 postpone the game, but I realize that is not an option for ZOS as their publisher is on their backs to release.

I would also wish that people would be more tolerant of each other. Threads saying x should be a priority over y are insulting and not helpful. To succeed this game is going to need to cator to both x and y, so stop the fighting and give ZOS solid feedback on how to improve both.

What are your thoughts?

Edit 1: in an interview with Zam on March 22 game director Matt Frior stated there will be no adventure zones or raids at launch. The focus will be on getting existing systems up to date and launching a good core gaming and building from there. He did say that they are experimenting with Adventure Zones and that he didn't want to say too much as it may change. I am sad to hear this but at least elated to think that Adventure Zones are being seen as a priority post launch.

My only frame of reference for a 3 faction pvp is the current GW2 model. While I enjoy GW2, there's a trend that has one server zerg itself to a huge lead, the 2nd place server then feeds on the lowest hanging fruit which is the 3rd place server who then vanishes until the next match.  A quick glance at the 8 NA matches, it looks like in all but 1 match, the leading server has close to %50 of the available points earned.  Now, this scenario doesn't play out EVERY match but it occurs too often imo. 

Edit: I was thinking about what, if any, game mechanics might buff a losing side or debuff a winning side and whether any game mechanics might 'kick in' due to faction populations within a specific zone reaching x threshold levels. For example, huge numbers of troops in a small area would drain supplies faster than a smaller force and be more susceptible to AOE  attacks.  

Edit 2: Ok, so I'm not convinced overall faction populations will be huge issue for ESO given that a huge faction will have lots of territory to defend, essentially spreading itself thin OR defending key strategic areas.  Where it gets tricky is when that massive population faction is able to MOVE a critical mass of people to a specific zone AS FAST AS a smaller population faction as to nullify any counter moves.  In other words, it doesn't always matter how much u have it's where that asset IS and where you can place it in x time.  "	t5_2tqi0	True

1358395552.0	16qd2q	Spellmaking? My take. 	sapo444	12	3	7	"I know that this is a topic thats being thrown around and I wanted to give my 2 cense, so to speak.

First off, this system works off the principle of ""Perfect Imbalance"". A system where all the pieces are unbalanced and no one strategy reins supreme. Take Chess vs League of Legends. 

LOL has little balance and the players themselves develop new strategies to counter each others strategies. 
Chess on the other hand, has all the pieces balanced and their is a handful of strategies used to win. Its perfectly balanced. 

Now that thats squared away, on to the reason your still reading. 
As we know, each school of magic has ""sub categories"" within them. Destruction has Fire, Ice, and Lightning spells. Restoration has Healing, Wards, and Turning undead spells. And So on and so on. Imagine if you will, a system where you start with no spells and instead have to create your own from these sub categories. Take 2 Fires, and maybe some components, and make a basic fire spell. Then mix and match the spells with other spells to make more and more. Sounds unbalanced right? Well I have a few ways to help make it Perfectly Imbalanced. 

First, the more powerful/complicated the spell is, the more mana needed to cast the spell. So no lvl 5 player goes around casting a healing ward while shooting flaming ice spikes. 
Next a proficiency system. Lets say we have two lvl 5 players, each with a fireball. lets say damage 10, mana to cast 15. One player has been using the fireball more than the other, so the mana to cast might be 7, and manage may be 12. The more proficient you are with a spell, the more DMG and less mana will be needed to cast. 
Finally, 1000's of different spells and combos. With a incredible array of spells, and differing proficiency in those spells, players can stand a chance against each other. Someone got a healing ward? Use a new type of exploding thrall or lightning/fire spell. By making some op and some underpowered spells, you can create our word of the day, Perfect Imbalance. 

Now for a fun thought I had: A spell market
Players could write the newly created spells down of scrolls for others to buy. You could make a market on scrolls for any type of situation. Now, I don't believe that this will work with books. if players start putting these powerful spells in books, it defeats the purpose of making your own spell tech tree, so to speak. most players can just buy the new spells and learn them permanently. The market could dry up once everyone knows all the spells. Besides, the point if this spell making is to make your own spells, not buy them from others permanently. scrolls can be useful, one time only things. ( and keeps the market alive, and gold in your pockets )

This concept can make the RvR battlefield more dynamic. Imagine different types of spells flying across the battlefield. Mages would be at an arms race to make and perfect new spells to use. Scrolls for knights would sell like sweet rolls. 

Thats my 2 cense. Thank you, and happy arguing.

I'm concerned. It's literally the strongest player on whichever Alliance dominates the Imperial City. That's the only mechanism by which the ruler of Tamriel is chosen.

What if the strongest player is an asshole? Or a total idiot? I don't think it's a good idea to give away such a title on a power basis alone. 

Also, awarding the title on a power basis alone means that anyone who waits a short time after the release date before buying the game drastically reduces their chances of being the highest rank in their Alliance.

It seams as though this game is going to be very similar to Dark Age of Camelot, which I honestly couldn't be happier about. I'm hoping that each faction will have different classes like we saw in DAoC, though it would be better if there weren't quite as many (There were 45 total classes in DAoC if I'm not mistaken, 15 for each faction). I would love to see 5 to 10 different classes for each faction. I really don't like how most new MMOs have 3 playable classes that the factions have to share.	t5_2tqi0	True

1376662151.0	1khl89	TESO Ecosystem	Vignarg	11	2	17	"One of Skyrim's biggest charms was its ecosystem - a world that interacted without you necessarily being the catalyst to that interaction. You could hear the roar of a dragon, take cover, and discover it was battling with a camp of giants; you might run smack into a pitched battle of Stormcloaks and Imperials and either loot the pickings like a vulture or take part and choose a side; or you might happen upon a pile of corpses and be left scratching your head, save/reload and rush back to that spot only to find if you'd gotten there a minute earlier, you would have found bandits and necros killing eachother. The world felt ALIVE.

To me, this was the obvious charm of Skyrim, and what makes it my favorite game, and the game that ruined MMOs for me. Much of the game was scripted to stand still until you progressed the story, but so much was not - to the point that I often wonder how many personal adventures I may miss out on by using the fast travel option as opposed to hoofing it. It was so obvious to me that this was integral to Skyrim's success that I thought ""well, obviously that same ecosystem would be part of any attempt to convert TES to an MMO."" To me, this is what would set TESO apart from the stale theme parks that saturate the market. Obviously this would be more complicated to capture in an MMO - or would it? If the ecosystem is defined by its interaction being independant of player activity, then shouldn't it be more attainable, not less? 

But I haven't seen any mention of it in interviews or teasers. Or if there is, I am looking for the wrong key words or missed the right interview. 

Would it be a violation of the NDA for someone to speak to this? It seems like a pretty huge feature, like admitting there are dungeons or crafting. Or maybe there's some leaked information that would set my mind at ease? Am I in the minority to even want this feature integral to this MMO?

One of the things that MANY people have commented on is the lack of meaty combat.  Like most MMO's, the combat animations are totally divorced from the impact/death animations, to the point that they seem unrelated.

Whenever someone points this out, though, someone immediately responds ""It'd be nice, but that's impossible in MMO's.""  This smells like total bullshit.  In fact, multiplayer games like Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, as well as Chivalry have shown you can have meaty combat even with dozens or even hundreds of players running around.

It seems like MMO designers have become so comfy with fanboys willing to defend their lack of innovation that not only have they become incapable of raising the bar, they're actually fine with releasing games that look more awful than past ones.

At this point, it is about how the developers capitalize and build on those possibilities bringing them into fruition, regardless of our own personal expectations. I would like to, if the moderators will permit, open up a topic for people to offer constructive criticism on what they like or do not like **from the content we have seen so far.**

Following the recent flare-up, I have been both encouraged and disappointed by different aspects of what I have seen so far. I am sure that many of you have seen the rage-storms swelling in many common forums. I am not here to cut anything down or spew falsities, but simply to inform and offer constructive feedback on a topic that I am genuinely concerned about.

That being said, of the content that I have seen thus far, I am primarily worried by the apparent lack of fluid and engaging combat. For a game supposedly based on **active reflex timing and hit recognition,** the obvious flaws in this system seen in the leaked video are insanely alarming to me. For a game based on immersion in a seamless world, the seemingly lackluster mechanics behind hit registration is insanely alarming to me. These are things that need to be addressed by the developers for this game to have a chance at success. Graphics can and will change, but if the simplest mechanics of the game do not function properly, then the game will ultimately fail. This is supposed to be an action MMO, every swing, spell cast, and shot should provide a feeling of satisfaction and weight to the player, and equally so when said attack connects with a target or the player himself. I have been extremely eager to see Zenimax incorporate the concept of fluid real-time combat into this title. After watching the leaked video, I do not get the feel of any real weight behind the combat, especially the scenes that show the player being hit from a seemingly extreme distance, even taking damage when no threat was remotely close to being within striking distance. (If you don't understand what I mean about putting weight behind combat, check out Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.)

For those of you who agree with me and would like to see some of these changes to the combat system before release, please continue to voice these concerns on forums. With increasing concern, hopefully this will be something that will be addressed by the developers. If these combat animations and hit registrations looked terrible and seemed to not function properly when the person in the video was simply fighting wolves, (I'm sorry but I really do think so!) **imagine trying to accurately time hits and blocks against a real live person in  end-game PvP with this currently shown system.** (or any PvP for that matter) In my opinion this needs to be addressed for the game to be ultimately successful. Keep drawing attention to this and we can hope (unfortunately maybe fruitlessly) that this will be addressed by the developers in the coming months prior to release.

One possible solution to this problem without drastically changing game mechanics could be to reduce the range of attack. I want to know that I am hitting what I am trying to hit because my weapon passes through them and there is accurate hit registration, but if this is not the case then it could at least **make an attempt** to give that illusion.

I want this game to succeed, and since you are here I am sure that you do as well.  While my post focused on combat, there are obviously many other topics that can be addressed at this point. It might be too late at this point in development for any serious changes, but I can at least try to believe that the developers may take our concerns into some consideration as we move forward."	t5_2tqi0	True

I have been following this subreddit for a couple of months now, reading every bit of information I can get my hands on, but there is still something I am quite unsure on.

When it comes to healing, it doesn't sound like there will be a class skill tree dedicated to it. I assumed early on that Sorcerers would have one of their skill lines dedicated just to healing, but a couple weeks ago the 3 Sorcerer skill lines were revealed to be DPS trees (a Daedric Summoning tree, a Lightning tree and something else). 

Does this mean that the only healing abilities available are obtained from Restoration Staves? Does this also mean that if we indeed want to be a dedicated healer, it doesn't matter which class we pick?

I've read 2 different articles now (albeit of the derregatory kind) that mention exploration is not as robust as in Skyrim and the game is just another linear themepark.  While I personally love themeparks better then sandboxes (not to derail here) but an open-ended exploration centric world is what I loved about TES games the most and it is the reason, the only reason, why I can continue to play Skyrim and Oblivian years after there release whereas the linear games endup sitting on my shelves, never to get replayed.

1359587358.0	17lb6q	An interesting quote from the guardian article discussed.	Devlin1991	10	4	5	"&gt;We found as we played the game we liked certain character builds, so we've made enemies that essentially share some of those character builds. We're trying to simulate, basically, how players fight in groups – we want enemies to be using those tactics against you, so they'll help each other out, buff each other, heal each other. One might throw a pot of pitch and then a mage sets you alight – so now you're on fire and you're slowed down.

This seems very like the Guild Wars 1 system in which certain mobs had and actively used abilities that were obtainable by the player. Most of the time using an item on the corpse of these enemies allowed the player to obtain one of the skills used and it was a key part in creating character builds.

ESO seems to have taken it one step further and will have enemies using player abilities in combos just as a player group would do. This seems every exciting, it should feel fresh for a while at least. Being able to understand and abuse enemy AI is a key part of playing any game so I expect some very clever stuff to be done by baiting enemies into using combo attacks so that they lock into animations that leave them open to attack etc.

I would love to have abilities picked up on the defeat of certain bosses and enemies. Although I hate artificial gating of content(e.g. attunements from previous raid needed for next) I think requiring at least a few members of a raid to have an ability from a dungeon boss in order to beat the encounter(e.g. A freeze/tranquiliser to use on berserking adds) would make the game feel more dynamic and would help different fights feel different not just though different mechanics but because you have to use different abilities in order to complete them."	t5_2tqi0	True

1359230967.0	17bw6a	Predicting Alliance Population Balancing	ardikus	9	0	31	"A few people have already predicted that the Ebonheart Pact are going to have far more players than the other two alliances. It is tempting to say this based on the fact that Nords and Dunmer are the main races of Skyrim and Morrowind, and people are very familiar with them for that reason. 

I do think, however, that the Daggerfall Covenant may come close to or exceed the Ebonheart Pact in numbers for several key reasons:

First of all, it contains two human races - Redguard and Breton. People always say before a game is released that ""nobody will play humans"" because it's boring or some other reason, yet in every MMO humans are the most popular race, or very close to it - just look at the statistics for WoW and GW2 for example. 

This happens because when people play an RPG, they want to identify with their character as much as possible to get the best immersion experience, and this is more easily achieved by playing a human. This doesn't apply to all people obviously but is a very prevalent phenomenon.

The third race in the Daggerfall Covenant being Orcs will likely draw in many people who played Horde in WoW.

I do have some concerns for the population of the Aldmeri Dominion, though. Elves and Cat people are cool and all, but they will mostly draw in a niche crowd while the vast majority of players will choose the other two alliances."	t5_2tqi0	True

For instance, if you were in charge of determining invites would you rather invite someone who gave a answer like:

or 

* ""I have beta tested a few MMOs in the past and even more games of other genres. I feel that beta testing a game and sending tickets when I find glitches/exploits is one of the best ways I can give back to the developers when I find a game I know I will enjoy. People often use and treat game betas as a glorified demo and do not even bother sending in tickets when they run into problems in-game. I have the opposite mindset, and believe that your major role as one of the few selected in the beta is simply to do all you can to help make the game better and make it easier on the developers.

I don't really have any ideas that would be good, because if there were a few hundred people in the same area, i would have a hard time seeing how you'd be able to hear yourself think with all the noise pollution from random people screaming, or mics buzzing.  

This kind of also goes along with a question about how the multiplayer aspect will be handled on the next gen consoles.  From my understanding it should be the same as the computer, but i have no idea.  Maybe they could make a game chat feature that allows you to talk to people close to you, or turn off the ability to talk to people all together.

I'm skeptical about the console version, primarily because I've never seen an MMO on console and I'm worried about the social aspect not matching up to what I would get on the computer.  I like both pc and console equally, i would play more computer, but frankly mine can't handle the games which is why i hope that everything is in tact on the computer version.

I really think this is important so I sent them a long mail with my thoughts:

I'm going to try to answer a slightly different question: Why are the Elder Scrolls games so much more immersive than generic MMORPGs?

Lets start at Morrowind. First of all you have a big, borderless world to explore freely, without being told what to do too much. Secondly the way the quests and journal information is designed you are forced to read dialogue. While the amounts of text seemed daunting at first, like when reading a good book you got sucked in, thanks to the well written quests and dialogue. Finally the fact that you can solve quests in different ways, and have to figure out the best solution yourself, and then see the consequences of your actions affect the game world is what I think makes the game so immersive. In a typical MMO on the other hand, you will go from zone to zone, doing the same things over and over. Even if the quests are well written and voice-acted, very few people will be motivated to listen to it when it just ends with a quest to kill another 10 enemies.

Moving on to Oblivion, some new features were added that helped with immersion. Better AI, and specifically NPC and monster behavior when not in combat are very important. In MMOs you typically see lots and lots of the same kind of monster standing in small groups in the designated area and not doing anything. For the game world to be believable, there must be reasons why the monsters are there, and they should at least have some non-combat behavior.

Playing Skyrim, the world felt very much alive, and it had improvements in many of the areas I have already mentioned. Details in the game world are also important, and in Skyrim there were plenty of them. It's hard to define exactly, but the attention to detail that went into making the environments of Skyrim is very clear.

Immersion is definitely one of the most important aspects when it comes to any role-playing game, and to maintain it all the time the game world must also be consistent, without sudden changes in style, or contradictions in the story and lore. If you met some author when playing Morrowind, you shouldn't find his books lying around in the second era when playing ESO."	t5_2tqi0	True

WingnutLegit	11	6	8	It has been confirmed that after reaching end game, the player will have the opportunity to venture into an opposing faction's territories. However, you will not be able to see any opposing faction's players, even though you are in their areas. I don't understand how this makes sense, unless your faction has near enough wiped out the other populations. I know there will be NPC's, but wouldn't they be extremely hostile, seeing as though you have probably killed so many of their race? I also don't understand how they will adapt the quests and dialogue to match the current events, such as how we saw in TES V - Skyrim, how the topic of the civil war and the dragons were always found in conversation. We know that there will be no final victorious faction, and no peace, because that would eliminate the PvP in Cyrodil. Finally, wouldn't it be possible to level up entirely in PvP, without touching the main storyline, and then be able to wander around in an opposing faction's land?

1. Multiple Cyrodiil Instance's each with their own Emperor
2. Que time's to get in to Cyrodiil

The first option i feel would hugely reduce the impact being ""Emperor"" is and what would happen if you spend hours in one instance log off then come back later and you are unable to get in to the previous instance. This would also cause people to try and find the instance that their Alliance is holding for any vendor's/rewards holding the capital may bring. I feel that it would also make the zone less competitive as if your Alliance start's losing ground all you have to do is go to a different one

The second option i feel would be extremely frustrating for people that don't have long to play and have to spend half their gaming time in a que.

Yes i understand that Cyrodiil is the same size as it was in Oblivion but the amount of people that will buy ESO having 1 Cyrodiil just isn't viable

Will TESO feature any of these weapons? Or will we be limited to maces swords bows and axes? I feel like, even if the differences are mostly cosmetic, these weapons should still appear in some form for variety's sake. We know that the Templar has a spell that attacks with a ""Spear of light"" of some sort, so an actual spear weapon shouldn't be that far-fetched.

The combat system. 

In fact, if Neverwinter has something done well it's the combat. 

It's responsive, fluid (for the most part, it's still beta after all) and there is a real sense of hitting. I think that is very important, because it really makes the combat feel real and fun.

On the other hand, I think the aim is very forgiving in that game, and the fact that the game kinda holds your hand when you try to cast an ability out of range also let me down a bit. 
I think the game shouldn't stop you from wasting an ability/resource if you do it wrong.  It's your job to time it right and judge the distance.

1366200634.0	1cj086	To all the haters.	NerdEngineering	56	48	45	"So I'm not sure if this breaks the rules or not referencing the leaked footage as I'm more interested in the player response than discussing the video itself.

However, I'm just curious as to how many of the crazy its all ruined for me people are just too ignorant to know that the scene was recorded in poor quality on a shit rig or if there is just an enormous amount of trolling going on.  I'm guessing a 50/50 split.  As per usual the trolls scream the loudest and the ignorant ones (probably a younger crowd) jump on the bandwagon.

To all you who are genuinely looking forward to this game you need to stop feeding these knuckle heads.

1) Anyone who looks at a very early unoptimized beta leak and draws any conclusions good or bad is jumping the gun.

2) Short of the player trolling the mechanics looked fluid and dynamic despite a non-melee class pick and starting off at level 1.

3) The world looked massive.  Just utterly huge.  Not since EQ1 have I scene an MMO world that was just like wow this really is a Massive MORPG.

4) It looked very very Elder Scrolls.  (News flash you don't kill elder dragons at level 1 in Skyrim so quit hating on the mudcrabs)  Even to the detail of scropions crawling around on pipes.  No other MMO has yet to add this level of fine detail.

5) Just running around and exploring was possible.

Is this a hype thread?  Absolutely; however, everyone knows that it is usually the whiney crowd that dominates the forums and the few who are content are often the silent crowd who browses.  This is for them and I say to you all who don't base their personal self worth on their ability to generate drama on the internet ""keep faith"".  Will this be the MMO to end all other MMOs?  Probably not, but I'm betting it will be a fun gaming experience that will bring countless hours of fun into our lives.

Diablo attempted to curb it through their RMAH, this didnt work to well. Gold farmers were simply willing to go as low as the RMAH was. Although it was easier/safer to obtain gold through the auction house, it was still cheaper to obtain it from farmers.

Other then actively scanning/banning those who engage in it.. Im not sure much can be done. The issue that arises is account theft and then banning players who truly arent involved in the process (This happens alot in wo)

Is there really any way to stop it? If so, what do you think can be done?

Some questions to get the discussion going:

- what armor type will you use (light/medium/heavy), and which will be most popular in pve and pvp?

- what secondary skills will you use to give your healer more flavor? (are you going to be sneaky? use a shield and mace? use a bow? use offensive magic?)

- do you think main healers will be required to focus only on health + magika? what sort of breakdown will that look like? do you think there will be a lot of pressure for healers to invest an uncomfortable amount into magika relative to health in order to be competitive?

At this point I am leaning towards light armor and making the character more ""sneaky"" with maybe a bow to help out with damage dealing."	t5_2tqi0	True

1360771444.0	18g7mv	PvP Idea: a New Approach to Keep Things Challenging, but Also Reward the Best.	nthm94	9	4	35	"A lot of the concerns I've seen regarding PVP for ESO have been rather focused on the formats belonging to GW2 and WoW. Some people do not desire a gear treadmill, due to the fact that the people who play most/longest will be too powerful for others to contend with. The issue with this is: Where is the incentive to PVP with no reward? One of the ideas I had to counter this was to keep steady with WoW's gear treadmill, but tweak it a bit with some of GW2's qualities, however before I elaborate, allow to me to explain both games systems. 

In WoW PVPer's would earn credits which they could use to buy powerful sets of armor, these sets included stat bonuses, set bonuses, and minor character enhancements (Example; A Druid in full PVP gear would possess a higher movement speed while shapeshifted.) this was a great format at first glance because you felt your character become more powerful with each set piece you acquired. The con's were that you were so much more powerful than a new PVPer it was almost unfair, and relatively discouraged newer players from PVP.

Now I'm less familiar with GW2's PVP system, but this is what I've come to understand (Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)... PVP based armor is relatively cosmetic. It doesn't grant you stat boosts that make you the best, but instead shows that you are by having an aesthetic that most people do not. This system is pretty cool, in that it allows you to show off your skill/time spent. Though I suppose the con's would be that it doesn't feel like much of a reward, makes you a potential target, and when you are ganged up on, you don't have any stat boosts to help you put those noobs in their place.

If you're still reading, I thank you for your patience. Here is my proposition: Keep people competitive like in GW2! Don't allow somebody to be overpowered and deter people from PVP. Having an exclusive armor signifying your PVP rank is pretty cool too. But wait, that isn't enough is it? Thats a pretty lame reward, so what could we take from WoW? The character enhancements! Having an armor set that doesn't give you major stat boosts will keep things competitive, but those minor enhancements can potentially give you an edge once the tables begin to turn. Also, you can show off your spiffy new duds so everybody knows your a badass.

""But nthm94,"" you say, ""the class system doesn't work like WoW's. One enhancement may not be good for everyone."" and you're damn right it wouldn't! So before you interrupt me again, allow me to propose two more ideas: An armor perk system! Once you earn a complete new set you may choose from a variety of character enhancements. This would work kinda similar to enchanting from ESO I suppose, in that you would be given the choice of things such as buffs to weapon skills, armor skills, mobility, CC time, stealth, elemental resistances, etc.

Now my second idea to counter enhancements being useless for some people is simply grant enhancements and bonuses to your classes skills. The ones that you are granted based on the class you choose, and not through perks. This sounds more realistic I suppose, but doesn't grant the character customization I would expect out of an ES game.

TLDR: You really should read it, but if you're too dedicated to laziness, be that way. Aesthetic and competitive gear qualities from GW2, and character enhancements from WoW, handled similarly to enchanting from Elder Scrolls."	t5_2tqi0	True

Currently while guildwars 2 promised alot of things about having small groups and strategy involved....look at the current state of things now. The larger server always wins, it's been dissolved mostly into ZERG VS ZERG, any Zerg can respond from the other side of the map before most places are taken and the buff (immunity to non condition damage) that NPCs get after a place is flipped hurts small groups alot worse than zergs. Couple this with jumping puzzles and PvE content within WvW that takes additional numbers away from the battlefield....and you have something that could have been great and flopped.

Jawa57	15	8	8	"The idea is essentially that there is a website in which the modding community uploads their own weapon/armor skins that they have created. Then ZeniMax comes in every once in awhile, checks the top-voted ones, sees if they are up to standards, and lore-friendly, then puts them in their shop so that players can buy them as skins for pre-existing weapons and armor. That could make it follow the Guild Wars 2 model of the player buying the box, then the micro-transactions fund the rest.

1358973662.0	1756ey	Grouping Systems	Charlemagne712	8	1	16	"I dont know what type of system will be implemented for group finding. Im curious as to what kind of system everyone would like to see. Personally ive played a number of MMOs, and by far the best system is the one i experienced on Aion. I would really like to see this system used as opposed to the ones used in WoW or Rift

Edit:
Aion's system was 2 fold. As a group member you could register your group, say what quest youre doing (even make it linkable to your quest journal so you can find more info etc) and explicitly state what class and level range youre looking for. Individuals could then apply to your group and the leader can add them. ""Lf tank, healer todo dungeon xyz""

As an individual you could do largely the same thing advertising ""lvl 35 tank lfg todo dungeon xyz""

Sounds pretty standard, but where aion differs is instead of all this taking place only in a lfg chanel (which it did) there was also a window you could open up ""shift+v"" i believe, that had 2 tabs, one had every group lfm and you could filter by level, zone, quest, lf class, etc. The other had every individual lfg.

It made the grouping less spammy, more user friendly, and because it wasnt automatic grouping, it made you accountable for your actions in the group. Once you earned a reputation for being a douche then you wouldnt be selected into groups, on the other hand if you were a good player people took note, and made it easier to make friends outside of guilds and groups

1358731088.0	16ylm6	My take on Spell Progression.	aDumbGorilla	10	4	5	"So far we have heard that you can level up spells and you have a skill tree for every spell. I also assume this entirely replaces spell making. I think it should work something like this. Take you base fireball spell: let's say it does 30 damage, costs 50 magicka, and takes 3 seconds to cast. I say it works on a system that is capable of 50 level ups to match the player level cap. Every 5th level a primary aspect of the spell is changed ex: The spell now has a blast radius of 3 meters, the spell now flies significantly faster, or even it is now an aoe style firestorm. So you will have 10 spell augments, but there will be more than 10 available so your fireball is different to John's fireball. For the secondary level ups, you can choose to either: reduce the magicka cost by 1, decrease the casting speed by .1 seconds, or increase the damage by 2 (these are all relative of course). These can also change, let's say you changed your fire**ball** into a fire**storm** so it is now an AoE that you drop down and GTFO. Now a new option is available, increased duration. This couldn't really get unbalanced, because if you had your magicka cost down to near zero, your spell would be powerless. So you could tailor your spell to be a run and gun, or a sit back and cast a huge amount of damage.

**tl;dr:** Two types of level ups for spells, one makes the spell better and the other changes the spells affect.

**edit:** Like all skill trees is multiplayer games, this needs to be reset able on the fly. You need to be able to experiment for this system to be successful. 

**late night edit:** This type of progression could also reduce the number of base spells necessary for a good game. Ex: One fireball, one ice spike, and one lightning bolt. All three could be modified to do unique damage, one could be direct damage, the other AoE, and the other a fast cast. This could even work with areas like Illusion and Restoration. One base heal spell that could be modified to maybe buff stats or reduce damage taken."	t5_2tqi0	True

1357746499.0	1693v6	Logistics of Stealth?	kingofthetewks	10	4	22	"Let's be honest, playing as a stealth class is perhaps one of the most badass ways to play through an ES game. Perhaps one of the most overpowered methods as well. Zenimax has mentioned a nightblade class, but I am having trouble seeing how stealth classes will fit into this game. I've never played an MMO with a stealth class, so perhaps that's why I don't understand how such a player would function.

Concerns:  
1. You will have to stay COMPLETELY out of sight for PvP. Often in ES you are ""hidden"", but the enemy npc could definitely see you if they were a player. This makes me think that stealth will be extremely difficult against other players.  
2. Piggybacking on that same idea, I feel that after the first shot or dagger stab your cover will be blown and your role as an assassin will be compromised. Even if you can get a one hit kill, you're screwed if the target brought friends.  And where is there is a place for assassins on a large, open field full of players such as Cyrodiil?  
3. In PvE with a group of players, I also see a lack of a niche for the assassin. After the group engages it you won't be able to get stealth shots. Even though you can change your abilities and gear, it has to be outside of battle. So there will not be anything a long the lines of getting a huge stealth hit and then changing gear. You'll have to run and hide.

As a stealth enthusiast, I'm interested to read your thoughts and inputs :)"	t5_2tqi0	True

1357361126.0	15zqqm	A suggestion concerning race restrictions	daemonpie	8	0	19	"On the whole, I am in favour of the faction locked races; having half of your faction be mercenaries who have defected from the other two factions doesn't seem all that great. However, I can see one way for players to change factions that could be both enjoyable and not mess up the factions, as well as not interfering with the lore: make it possible to switch, but also make it extremely hard.

Imagine if the only way to change factions was a challenging questline that would involve going through multiple dungeons and zones, taking hours of time and being full of interesting npcs and storyline - something similar to the old paladin mount questline in wow which was taken out a few years back. 

Something like this would allow players to change factions, while not destroying the racial integrity of said factions. It would also be a goal which players could have pride in accomplishing; whoever saw them, whether on their new faction or old, would appreciate the effort they had put in to changing factions.

The only problem it would not solve, is what I've seen a lot of complaints about in the comments of youtube videos about eso: people who want to play with their friends, but their friends rolled orcs and they rolled a khajit, preventing them from doing so. Personally, I don't see this as a big issue - at least it wasn't in wow, which I admit is the only other faction based mmo I've played for any large amount of time. Friends either end up rolling alts of different factions to play with each other, or give up on their original race choice for their main and go with one with which that they can interact with their friends.

Unfortunately, It's extremely unlikely that anything like this would be implemented into the game, especially not on its initial release. It's much more likely that Zenimax will simply stick with locked factions, which is the simplest choice. Still, what do people think about this idea?

 Honestly I just hope they don't also go with faction-locked zones, which is crap :p

Then I heard that the megaserver will be split in to phases and currently I fail to see how these are different from different servers. As far as I understand it players are still split up depending on which phase they are playing on. Does this mean it will be possible for two players to be in the same geographical location, say Chorrol, but not be able to interact? Or are all players in Chorrol automatically on the same phase?

1. My wife and I love to play Skyrim, Oblivion, and the Fallout games, but she hates playing with too many people. Is this a game that a party of about three or four can make it through, of will we need more?
2. Will there be a monthly fee on the Xbox One?

4. What class is good for a beginner, and what class will be good for me and our son to pick so we can protect her.

pardon my ignorance if this issue has been discussed before. I wonder, has there been a statement on the issue of (almost) everyone having all stats maxed out after some time? In other RPGs there is a limited amount of skill points you can distribute or some classes roles don't have access to some abilities.

As far as I understand it, TESO does not want to do it that way. Instead of having a mage kinda character and a knight kinda character , over time you can built one guy skilled in both roles.

DariusBlack	12	7	30	"In the last interview we saw, the developer was talking about the freedom to do whatever you want, magic/melee/armor combinations out the wazoo and whatnot. I love the fact that we aren't restricted to tank/squishy classes and can choose the play-style we want.

However, there is one thing the developers need to consider if they are truly going to allow an open skill based game. I saw this happen in another MMO (not nearly as popular, but had a similar archetype) Darkfall. In the end, most of the pro players would choose the best skills out of every available tree - be it fire magic, healing, necromancy, polearms, medium armor, etc. - and would fine tune it into a ""must-have"" build. This wouldn't have been an issue if these builds didn't absolutely wreck the competition, and virtually force other players to adapt and adopt the same techniques.

I'm sincerely hoping that TESO has some kind of skill cap beyond their loose class system, that won't allow people to pick and choose every one of the best skills and abilities while forgetting the rest even existed. This is exactly how Darkfall died (they started to call it Magefall because if you didn't have max magic skills in every school, you were useless) and I don't want to see the same thing happen to this game.

One thing I've found in other MMO's is that they tend to often solely focus on combat, with little to no non-combat activities.  It makes doing anything other than killing things pointless.

I think it would be great if ZES expanded the skill trees they have planned to include non-combat activities.  For example, drinking could have it's own skill tree, with your tolerance to alcohol going up with each use, and your character gaining the ability to drink two-handed, chug drinks, and even the ability to bounce a Septim into a beer.  You get the idea.  Other activities that could benefit from their own skill tree:


-Acrobatics

-Animal training 

-Board games

-Dancing

-Dice

-Feasting

-Foreign Languages

-Gambling

-Hunting

-Ice-skating

-Literacy

-Musical Instruments/singing

-Skiing

-Sports

This could have dozens of applications in PvP, possibly. We heard a *long* time ago in an interview that you can *starve* out enemy forts by cutting off supply lines. But what about something a little more creative? A Nightblade could bypass the guards with a disguise and poison the water source, a much more complicated, but much more fun way of achieving the same goal. This is just one example, a few days ago the idea of assassinating the PvP Emperor came up, and that would definitely fall under this category.

**Questions/Topics**

* What other examples can you imagine where you could use stealth to achieve your goal?

* Should you be able to poison food/water supplies and have it kill the fort's inhabitants?

* Should you be able to assassinate the enemy Emperor?

* What options should only be available via stealth?

Similar to enchanting, almost all information will be assumed.

Hopefully, ESO will have a **much** more complicated system. Guild Wars 2 is a great example.

1364243217.0	1aztup	What I want out of The Elder Scrolls Online (A bit of a rant)		15	8	10	"I'm really tired of people forgetting what MMORPG in MMORPGS stands for. I've seen it happen in countless games such as Wow, runescape, Warhammer, etc. People focus too much on themselves. They want everything. Max every skill, have every piece of gear, have every achievement. 

**What is wrong with MMORPGS**
*Massive Multiplayer Online* The game is a social network. You are meant to work with others, speak with others, help others, etc. There isn't much of that in MMORPGS anymore. On the surface it may appear that there is, Wow has 10 and 25 man raids, battle grounds, etc. But why are people working together? For themselves. They want honor, they want X piece of gear. If they could do it by themselves many would. Sure there are guilds, but what do guilds do together? Run raids so everyone can get his or her own piece of gear? Group dynamics doesn't really matter in games like Wow. Look at battlegrounds. Very little strategy, everyone just runs around and does what THEY want. Sure there are always exceptions I am sure there are some great BG teams. But they are few and far between

*Role Playing*- This one is a big subject for me. RP is dead in MMORPGS. Your race doesn't really matter in many games beyond some stats. Your class determines your playstyle but no one cares beyond what type of dps, healing, or armor you have. Everyone is just a statistic. Why does this occur? Because games are centered around grinding. You grind raids, mobs, battlegrounds. No one cares who you are, only what you can offer (goes back to the MMORPG side). Even on RP servers all there really is a few RP chats going on here and there. You are still just a statistic to other players and you can only join the raid if your stats/gear matches up to what they want. 

*Game*- Seriously guys just have fun don't treat it like a job.

**What I want to see**

I want to see people mattering. We are all sitting behind a screen playing a game, yes, but I want everyone to play a role in the game. Don't be just a warrior looking to get X sword to do X dps. Be a warrior on a quest looking to slay some high elf scum who desperately needs a companion to help him on his journey. Don't just be a bunch of statistics looking to max every skill. PLAY A ROLE. This is what these games were founded on. Be the best damn smith in the world, dont be a level 100 smith, 1 handed, destruction, two handed, block, etc etc etc running around shouting that you have 5 steel plates for sale. 
Dont just think about yourself. Honestly I would rather spend my time (and I hope you would too) having fun then using my time ""efficiently"" like I said this isn't a job. Who cares if you are saving up 100000 billion old for a slightly different looking axe, is that really what you want this game to be? Another grind? Why not take the time to be part of the game? Get to know other players, create a story for your character, etc.

Ever since the release of The Elder Scrolls III: Construction Set, fans of the series have modded the Hell out of the series. It's influenced official content and storytelling, as well, I am sure.

Does anyone know about the chance of User-Created content in ESO? I have played Star Trek Online and it has a modding tool that allows for users to create quests and encounters for other players to experience. There are even contests set up for creators to make content. The winners of the contest are advertised and recommended for users to play. It isn't anything as elaborate as the modding community for a single player game could be, but it attracts more players and makes for a much more vibrant game community.

ESO would flourish under this design. There could even be Lore-Friendly User Created Content Challenges, where users are tasked with creating interesting quests based on past lore or unique rule sets, with the winner being shown on the login screen or community hub.

1362979964.0	1a2foq	Question about AvA...	Cetlas	6	0	6	"Forgive me if this has been covered, but how is AvA gonna be plausable with a megaserver? 

If say, ESO hits the 3 million accounts mark (Like GW2), GW2's WvW, split between many groupings of 3 servers, has queue's getting into the EB every primetime. This stands to be 1 grouping of 1v1v1 with what could be millions of people trying to do it.\

I understand in normal regions it filters you in and out with certain people based on taste and behind the scenes algorithm about your playstyle. But, if they phase the battles in different areas, how can a single group effect the work takeover? There could be 5+ battles for kvatch going on in a phased world. If there is a queue, the map can only be so big, and they've said the battles are for ""Hundreds"". They have the potential for millions of players. If every skyrim player bought it, thats a million+. 

Having a title like Emperor up for grabs is also going to make alot of people want to do it. I want to do it. But if there is atleast thousands trying to queue or even worse thousands in the battles itself its going to be murder to hardware."	t5_2tqi0	True

1362355025.0	19lsk6	Changing roles in ESO, unforgiving?	Chaori	11	5	11	"Zenimax put a lot of emphasis on being able to play how you want to play, wear what you want to wear etc.

Being able to wear whatever you want, whenever you want is what makes the Elder Scrolls franchise so great - but it could have a downside in an MMO environment. This is obviously a great way to eliminate the need to create multiple alternate characters to fulfill different roles in PvE/PvP, but what concerns me the most is that it could be very unforgiving if you do indeed change your mind later down the track.

Say you start a character with the intention of being a Destruction Mage (or whatever the equivalent is in ESO). You point a decent amount of points into Magicka and reach a decent level as a Mage - then you decide that you want to be a tank instead. Since you already have a lot of points in Magicka, will you ever be as good a tank as someone that intended to be one from level 1 - one that has put all their points into HP and Stamina?

Will they offer some form of stat reset? Will it actually matter if you are a tank with a high Magicka pool?

I tend to try and play hardcore in most MMOs I play, and it's a major turnoff to me that my entire character will be gimped if I don't play the one 'class' through its lifetime. If I do decide that I want to try a different playstyle I will end up just creating a new alt so that I can have perfect stat weights.

Is anyone else concerned about this?"	t5_2tqi0	True

1355775270.0	150d7n	Any information about grouping in Elder Scrolls Online?	gtramontelli	6	1	11	"I'm curious if anyone has any information or ideas about the ""feel"" of grouping in ESO.  I've been playing MMORPGs for many years now, and I've been disappointed by the grouping in the last few releases.  I looked forward to Guild Wars 2 and the promise of grouping without being pigeonholed into a ""holy trinity"" type role, but the dungeons in that game are a hectic mess.  

I can appreciate the drive toward giving players more freedom in the way they play their classes, but I think that absolute freedom tends to diminish the importance of group play.  If all I can do is heal, I need to rely on someone to do the damage and take the damage.  If I can heal, take, and give damage it really makes much less difference what's going on with the other members of the group.

On the other hand, when I've played healers - I really hated that I was basically playing ""whack - a - bar"" with the health bars, and half the time I had no idea what was happening in the fight.  I think the best balance of the two have been the games where you can switch builds (Rift, DCUO) and play a more balanced character when solo but switch to a build that min/maxes your ability to do your role in the group.

Any idea where ESO will fall on the spectrum between fixed roles and the more ""free-for-all"" type roles?"	t5_2tqi0	True

**Real Arrows and Real Archery**

The archery system in Skyrim was simple enough that one could reliably kill enemies from medium range with little to no skill, but also left room for someone with real talent to pull off incredible long range snipes. The secret to this was that the arrows launched were real, they sank with gravity and if you shot them straight into the sky they would arc down and land headfirst. They also required you to aim, and to understand how they would fly.  Making this the archery system for TESO wouldn’t stop new players from picking up archery and enjoying it, but it would make talented archers prized and sought after in PvP guilds, and would make room for tactics involving ambushes and assassinations. It would give a commander pause as his army approached a canyon pass that leads right to the enemy keep, and perhaps encourage him to take the longer, safer route.

**Lots of Spells**

TES lore is rife with examples of generals using mages in creative ways to overcome their enemies. [Prince Juliek]( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/2920,_vol_06_-_Mid_Year) used Alteration mages to cast water breathing spells on his army and circumvent Vivec’s forces during the assault on Ald Marak. This is the breadth of possibility that should be available to mages in TESO. The limited hotbar will make skill selection precarious and only the most organized of groups would be able to spare room for specialized spells, but they would be rewarded with a new realm of tactics. Does one take mages with water-walking spells so he can mount a surprise attack across a river, or water-breathing and swift swimming instead so that he can take the river past the enemy entirely and attack their stronghold? As the walls begin to crumble at a fort do the defenders call for Frost Atronachs to slow the enemies charge as archers and mages destroy them from afar, or Dremora to join the warriors in bloody battle? Allowing this range of “flavor” spells will reward organized groups and help them distinguish themselves from the bands of pick-up-group marauders they’re sure to encounter.

**Truly Customizable Characters**

Zenimax has been talking a lot about how their character development will allow for varied characters, and that their limited hotbar will force characters to choose their skills wisely. If this is true, players will be able to develop a diverse range of roles that will help develop a flourishing metagame. A warrior type can choose to supplement his skill with the two handed sword with medium armor and a bow to become an adept skirmisher. A mage can focus his studied on point blank destruction spells and debuffs, then combine them with proficiency in heavy armor and maces to become a specialist in crumpling hard targets. This diversity also helps with balance issues as it shift the focus from “Class X has no counters to Class Y” to “Spell A and Spell B are just too powerful when used in conjunction.” The ultimate boon, however, is the satisfaction felt by players when creating new strategies.

**Unified Command Chat**

Organization of the zerg, that mass of players who don’t follow any specific leader, is paramount to large PvP games. One method is to create a chat channel between the leaders of the factions forces, so that they can strategize, and another channel for talking to the entire faction. While everyone should be able to read this command channel, only a few should be able to use it. The method of determining who these people are could vary. They could be the Guild Leaders of the top PvP guilds or people who have spent a lot of time leading PvP groups. Perhaps both. It is an important feature that allows a faction to work in a smoother manner.

**Routs**

There must be situations in which one army is totally bested by the other through super numbers and arms. No artificial barriers should be put in place to enhance fairness. Though it may seem unfair to allow ten defenders to fight against one hundred attackers, it is indicative of larger strategies at play. It allows forces to break up into smaller forces without forcing the enemy to do the same, and makes it more meaningful when there are truly large engagements. If a commander is able to field more numbers, or use the environment to his advantage, then he has outplayed his enemies, and they would do well to learn for him. This is not to say that truly unbalanced features should be left in, but one must examine if a feature is unbalanced, or if the wrong counter is being applied.
