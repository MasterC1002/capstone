I built this thing for about $300 and with some spare parts earlier this year. The CPU, RAM, and motherboard were scrounged together from eBay. I had to mod the case because the motherboard is a nonstandard form factor / bigger than ATX (the fun challenges of being on a budget).

Originally 2 12 core Opteron 61xx CPUs but was upgraded to Opteron 62xx a couple of months after Interlagos was released

24GB triple channel memory(6 sticks, 3 per bank)

2 WD Black 2TB Drives

4 Intel X25 industrial SSDs(Hardware raid 0+1) where the OpenEdge database lives

SuperMicro case with Triple Redundant PSU

And a few months ago I built a hot spare with the same CPU+memory+case configuration but only 1 2TB drive(budget)

1313224381.0	jhkob	Where to get started in this field?	xboxsosmart	15	3	28	"So I'm under 18. I've always been fascinated by networks and computers. Currently I'm training for Microsoft A+ certification (I know they are a joke, but I got e-learning free). I was looking at the CCNA classes, but it costs 6k for the two parts. I'm truly dedicated - throw me anything and I'll finish it. 

What I really want to know is:

How much on average do you guys make?
What is the best way to learn about the field besides experience?
How did you get started?
Are there any reasonably-priced ways to get CCNA?

Thanks!"	t5_2sb9o	True

1371168049.0	1gazjm	DC Rack move and rewire	melophat	13	4	2	This is our previous rack at our DC in Downtown L.A.  We were experiencing hardware failures, mostly from heat buildup due to the wiring situation and the fact that for some reason the DC has a 2 row wide HVAC dead zone that we happened to be in.  So i spend 10 hours alone 2 weekends ago moving racks and rewiring.  We're now dead center to a HVAC outlet, the wiring is much cleaner and better, and we're not experiencing any of the issue we were before.  I was tired as fook, but my OCD loves this so much that one of the switch pictures is now my phone wallpaper..  Hope you guys enjoy!  http://imgur.com/a/gvVpj#0	t5_2sb9o	True
