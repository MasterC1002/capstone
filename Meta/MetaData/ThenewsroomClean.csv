1343023357.0	x059r	As an Egyptian, who has been following this magnificent show from the 1st day, I couldn't be happier with the 5th episode.	AmiroZ	81	1	8	"I love to watch comedy &amp;/or drama shows, especially if they're mixed up within one show. From the top of my head, my favorite shows used to be (&amp; still are): Scrubs, Boston Legal, West Wing, 30 Rock, Prison Break &amp; other similar shows. That's why I quickly got hooked up to ""The Newsroom"" after its 1st episode.

Aside from the topic of tonight's episode being related to my country, &amp; aside from the witty conversations &amp; the dramatic/light comedic moments that highlight through the show so far, I hate to admit that I'm a big sucker for big speeches/rants (like Dr. Cox in Scrubs &amp; Alan Shore in Boston Legal). 

The following rant by Will McAvoy to Nina Howard, after trying to blackmail him into giving her money in exchange for not targeting her TMI show on the personal lives of him &amp; his staff, was my favorite moments of this episode...

Nina: Hey Will .. we're journalists.

Will: I wish you hadn't said that.

Nina: What?

Will: Everything would have been cooler, if you hadn't said that. You talk too much.

Nina: You have a problem calling myself journalist?
Only the elite few who cover stories nobody cares about, get to call themselves... 

Will: I got a guy in my staff got hit in the head with a glass door Thursday. His forehead wouldn’t stop bleeding, but he wouldn't go to a doctor, coz I got another guy got beat up covering Cairo, and the 1st guy wouldn't see a doctor until the 2nd guy saw a doctor.

I've got a producer who ran into a locked door, because he felt responsible for the 2nd guy. I've got an 18 year old kid, risking his life half-way around the world, &amp; the AP who sent him there hasn't slept in 3 days.
I've got 20-somethings who care about teachers in Wisconson. I've got a grown woman, who has to subtract with her fingers, staying up all night trying to learn economics from a PHD, who can make 20 times the money 3 miles downtown. 

They're JOURNALISTS!

Come after me all you want, Nina. Come after me every day. Look through my garbage, invent things out of thin air. That's what you're paid for. But you touch my staff, &amp; you're walking into a world of hurt. I have an hour of primetime every night &amp; I will rededicate my life to ruining yours.  

I also want you to send a message up the chain of whatever backroom machinery is driving this, that if I so much smell Leona Lansing's perfume in any of this, I'm going to make a meal out of both of you and I won't stop until I'm done. Look at me .. and see that I'm dead serious."	t5_2rd6i	True

Interesting how he danced around the question of what happened to the death threats by just focusing on Terry Crews. But I'm sure he has  a bigger plan. In an AMA apparently Crews said he was coming back for an episode

I understand that we get a lot of information that would be in the show from the ""process"" scenes, but I always love seeing Will behind the desk. I don't think it would hurt the show one bit to dip into the relationship stuff a little, and spend that time ""doing the news"".

BicycleCrasher	40	5	36	"I'm guessing most of you haven't watched other Aaron Sorkin shows before.  Having seen everything the man has ever put on camera, most of what he does has things like this.  However, Jim/Maggie feels a little forced.

I agree that the best episodes have been those which focused on the news.  I also would really like to see an episode where Will messes up.  BIG TIME.

In ""Sports Night"", Sorkin's first TV show, he had a pair of characters named Casey and Dana who had similar a dynamic to Will/Mackenzie, but also shared characteristics of Jim/Maggie.  These romances failed in comparison to those Sorkin wrote for ""The West Wing"" and ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" where some of the romances were between people who weren't so obvious.  These didn't feel forced.

Here's to hoping the romance gets better."	t5_2rd6i	True

I expect more from Sorkin. 	ghalfrunt	62	27	47	"I got to say I'm a huge fan of Sorkin's work and I'm pretty left leaning in my views but I don't believe Will is well portrayed as a republican. Sorkin knows how to make the arguments for the other side. Ainsley Hayes and Joe Quincy were well written moderate republicans who made good points on The West Wing. I get how picking on the Tea Party's idiocracy makes sense and that's great but I'd love to see Will make more arguments for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, you know, what the Republican party use to stand for and what it seems like the character should believe. The rants he could make and the responses from his liberal staff would be gold and they wouldn't even have to resolve the debate just present both sides. Currently they say he's a republican but leave it that. I love the idea that a republican stands up to what the party has become. They do that and it's great but let's see some arguments that prove he still holds the other ideals. 

Seriously, I don't necessarily buy into the arguments but I love the debate and Sorkin has the ability to frame it and write it so well. It's what makes him a great writer. Additionally, it would showcase Sorkin's ability while helping him shrug the image of a solely liberal writer. When the show was billed as having a republican lead I was grateful as it's what I've wanted to see for so long from Sorkin and it's the part of the show in which I'm most disappointed.

There have been plenty of mentions throughout the season of how Mack is the best EP in the business. The season premiere was filled with those sort of mentions. But I haven't seen jack shit in regards to what makes her the best EP. 

In my opinion, Don is a far better EP. To me, Don is incredibly calculated. He's smart, he's on the edge, and he's rational. No matter what anyone else thinks of him, he is quickly becoming my favorite character on the show. But that's beside the point. My point is, Don has demonstrated far more characteristics that would enable someone to be the best EP in the business. Mack hasn't demonstrated shit. 

Sure, Mack has the principles. She has always been the one aiming for the likes of Don Quixote. But one should never confuse enthusiasm for action. And I haven't seen much action from her. But from Don, I have. Just reference the most recent episode during the meeting scene where Don is breaking down Nancy Grace's coverage of the Casey Anthony trial. Sure, we hear the protests of Mack throughout the meeting, but at least Don knows HOW and WHY the business works. "	t5_2rd6i	True
1342502834.0	worls	[Major E04 spoilers!!!] My Conspiracy Theories 	Franks2000inchTV	40	6	29	"I'm rewatching E04, and I think I'm 100% sure that Sloan is Leona's mole. I'm interested in what you guys think...

Okay there's the obvious stuff:

1) Sloan tells Will to go talk to the gossip columnist, who writes the teardown piece on him.

2) Sloan sets Will up on a date with her friend who she knows who is crazy, and who cajoles Will into smoking weed, and brings a gun.

3) These two people are the people who set up the teardown piece on will.

But! The thing that kinda tips the balance for me is in the party scene,  during the countdown to midnight they cut away to Sloan who is texting on her phone. Who is she texting? Maybe the Page 6 columnist?!?

I think they've also set this up in some more subtle ways. For instance when Will is getting yelled at by MacKenzie about the women he's dating, he refers to her in a derogatory fashion, indicating that he doesn't take her seriously.

Then, at the party, in the conversation where Sloan sends him over to talk to the gossip columnist, Will keeps cutting her off, and shows no interest in what she has to say. They're setting up her motivaton. She thinks he's a dick, and wants to take him down.

Keep in mind that it was Sloan who first told MacKenzie that she thinks that Will is an ass -- of course she actually said that everyone else thinks he's an ass, but you only say that sort of thing if you think the guy is an ass in the first place.

I'm just guessing, but maybe Leona has offered Sloan Will's spot. this is her chance to make it into prime time.

Anyway, I'm excited to see how this shakes out. This could all be an elaborate misdirection, and this could just be a set up for a whole false-accusation, with-us-or-against-us storyline. 

What do you guys think? Is Sloan the mole? Or is this all an elaborate set-up?!?

1341969934.0	wczth	What is it about The Newsroom?	Franks2000inchTV	33	5	29	"I have to start by saying I'm not a person who becomes a super-fan of things. I enjoy movies and shows, but generally leave them behind pretty quickly.

This show is crazy though! I have watched the premier 5 or 6 times at this point, the second episode at least 4 times and the latest already 3 times. This is not rational behaviour!

So I've been thinking a lot about what it is that has capitvated me about this show.

There's something about the combination of the language and pacing, the high-minded idealistic characters and the way Sorkin isn't afraid to go straight at big, political questions. 

I don't care that it's preachy sometimes, or that it falls back to predictable tropes at other. I actually enjoy those parts of the show.

Aaron Sorkin does something interesting in that he creates these hyper-realistic enironments (the white house, the newsroom) and drops in characters who are almost implausibly idealistic.

That's what bothers me when people say ""but no one is *that* perfect."" When did it become a rule that characters need to be gritty and realistic and full of flaws? I think there's tremendous value in presenting characters as *what they ought to be*, instead of what we all cynically believe that they will end up as.

Our culture lacks positive role models in media -- and it's not only kids who need role models. We all experience reality in the context of what we've experienced before and nowadays so many of our ""experiences"" are virtual, or mediated. I'll never go to a newsroom, but I have an idea what they're like because of shows like this one, or The Wire, or Network. 

Yes it's important that realism exists (*The Wire* is a perfect example of realism done right) but I think shows like The Newsroom are equally important. They give us a glimpse at a world that's within reach. Something that isn't real now, but that *could be* if we all acted on our best impulses all the time. 

I think that's why I find this show so compelling and so great to watch. I don't believe that there are any MacKenzie McHales or Will McAvoys in the world, but when I'm watching this show I believe that there *could be* a Mackenzie McHale, that there *could be* a Will McAvoy and most importantly that *I* could be a person like that.

BlueLaceSensor128	38	18	16	"Finally was able to watch this. Was very hopeful after seeing the first episode. Had some deep concerns along the way, but finished because of the acting and writing otherwise. Was very disappointed by the creative choices. Most of the time the show felt like listening to your liberal friend shout Huffington Post talking points at a debate or something. They really made it out like they were actually going to go after the ""real"" stories, but ironically enough, they couldn't even do it here. There were lots of other examples, but that one in the finale really had me shocked. Plus the compromising all along the way.

Anytime there was a screwup by the Administration, the pronoun ""we"" is thrown around an awful lot. And then of course the barrage against the other side to remind everyone who the real bad guys are. If this should would have taken place 8 years ago they would have lambasted Bush for Katrina, but Obama gets complete absolution for not cleaning up MMS.

It was mentioned elsewhere, but he didn't touch NDAA, the drone strikes, the toothless finance industry overhaul, the underside of Obamacare -namely all the promises that ended up being broken for backroom deals with the industry and other major lobbies, his continuation of Bush's approach with other civil liberties and foreign policy. 

In fact, if they didn't constantly defend him, I wouldn't be sure he was the president in this imaginary world where a guy who claims to be a Republican only seems to have a thirst for oxygenated blood on his hunt. It's completely unrealistic and this show is downright criminal in its attempt to present itself as remotely balanced or genuine in its approach. It's more liberal mud-slinging before the election. Why not a single serious question for the other side? The part about Clinton overturning Glass-Steagall? When he finally presented that fact, it was done so tritely. He wasn't shouting or raving. She mentions it; He kind of acknowledges her dismissingly.

I haven't really seen a lot of his other stuff so I approached this one with fresh eyes and though I've heard he writes the other side well, I expect to be disappointed again.

For those of you who have also watched the West Wing (there are probably many of you, and sorry if this has been mentioned already), I'm wondering if Maggie's trip is going to turn out the same way Donna's trip did. See if this sounds familiar:

Young blonde female assistant/secretary who is feeling under appreciated, wants to prove herself, and get away from her work environment for a while, pleads with her boss to let her go overseas somewhere dangerous. She is somewhat naive and idealistic and doesn't consider the risks involved.

She is determined to prove she can be independent and not rely on their boss/coworkers. Boss eventually caves in to the request despite misgivings about the safety of the mission.

Now if it turns out like the West Wing, the following will happen:

_________________

Now, I haven't spent much time perusing critical reactions to the most recent episode, other than reading the review on the AV Club site; I'm writing this up at the suggestion of a friend to whom I shared a few thoughts after watching it.

Also, before I start, it might help to point out that I was in somewhat of a media blackout around the time that the news of Osama's killing came out, and so didn't get to see anyone's reactions – not even friends' or family's.

That being said, I had pretty strong 'artistic' objections – and maybe *ethical* objections – to what I considered to be the centerpiece of Sunday's *The Newsroom*. 

The reviewer for the AV Club writes that one of the main stories the episode tried to tell was ""how America felt when Osama Bin Laden was killed, a sentiment marked by relief, jubilation, solemn reflection, and a wide range of other emotions."" While that might be an accurate representation of the gamut of emotions that Americans experienced in *reality* (again, I really don't know), you would have never known it from the episode. 

What you saw instead was *unreserved jubilation* at the breaking news, with only one exception: someone for whom the news made her think of her father who died in the 9/11 attacks. Yet minus this one incident, to all of the characters of *The Newsroom* Osama's killing was an occasion for celebratory high-fives and – literally – a running motif of characters becoming almost childishly giddy from being the first to break the news to people who were unaware.

While not wanting to speculate too much about what this unreserved joy says, psychologically, about the characters on the show or about real Americans who celebrated his death with flag-waving and glee, I did spend a little bit more time thinking about the 'artistic' dimension of Aaron Sorkin's decision to include this, and how much of a contrast this was with some of his previous writing depicting similar incidents.

I think mainly of a story arc from the third season of *The West Wing* which – importantly to note – ran from October 2001 to May 2002. In this, evidence comes to light, to President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) and his cabinet, that the Minister of Defense of the fictional nation of Qumar has himself been implicated in several terrorist attacks against the U.S.; further, he is due to visit soon on a diplomatic trip. During a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the suggestion is raised that they use the opportunity of his visit to assassinate him (one of the 'justifications' invoked is present in the title of the episode itself: ""We Killed Yamamoto""). 

The evidence against Abdul ibn Shareef, the defense minister, is ironclad to be certain – Sorkin is at pains to assure us of this; and yet up until – and well beyond – the moment that the President gives the green light to indeed assassinate him, the decision is cast in the light of extreme ethical ambiguity:

Yes, sir.

BARTLET

I recognize that there's evil in the world.

What is your objection exactly, sir?

Doesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?

I just dug this up from my final semester at UGA. Their Grady College has one of the best broadcast programs in the US.

On election night last year, 100 students and student-volunteers got together for a 1-hour, unscripted, live special. I'm still getting the actual show synched to the control room feed, but I do have the feed before we went live.

The Pre-show
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN3Filo6zWs

This was an ambitious, completely student-run effort (the two professors were only there to babysit). It involved using a second studio that was never meant to work together with the first, two floor crews, 3 audio engineers and soundboards, 4 live-shots, and a lot of stress. But it was insanely fun to be a part of (I'm in master-control sound). My good friend is directing the whole thing.

EDIT: First bit is just a roundup of what we're doing. Control room shot is at 4:24 in.

Anyway, I'm hoping that they talk about the Colorado shooting at the movie theater. I mean, they already had 2 Batman references (at least I noticed 2) in season 1, so I don't see why they would omit this. Also, if I don't see anything in season 2 about what Clint Eastwood did at the RNC, I'm going to be really disappointed.

According the wiki page of The Newsroom, the last episode of the season took place between August 1 and August 8. So I'm thinking, maybe they should say something about Steve Jobs since he died in October of last year. Why not? I mean they could just talk about him briefly and then pan out into the Occupy Wall Street protests since both event happened around the same time. AND, Gadhafi's death was in October as well, so I think it'd be interesting to see what Sorkin has to say about that.

From /r/Thenewsroom, I'm Divtya Budhlya.

We bring you this special bulletin to make quick announcement about the the spoiler tags that we've been using on this subreddit. A few hours ago, we received some feedback from our reporter /u/Redditor8472, leading us to change the way spoiler tags work on this subreddit. Let's take a look at this clip from a few hours ago showing us how the old spoiler tags used to work:

`[This is the spoiler text](/spoiler)`

Going forward, /r/thenewsroom will be using the following spoiler tag format:

`[Spoiler](/s ""This is the spoiler text"")`



####Why the change?


Those of you who're also active on other subreddits will recognize this new format right away. This is the ""new"" way of handling spoiler tags and has its own advantages.

* The new format lets you specify what type of spoiler it is. For example: [Spoiler S01E01](/s ""Will takes vertigo medicine""). Instead of just `[Spoiler]` you can use `[&lt;anything descriptive&gt;]`
* The old format only used to work with the styling of this subreddit. As the spoiler text was in the link text, if you were to view it in your inbox or anywhere else, it would show up without being hidden. In the new format, all that would show up is the tag itself. 

The old format will continue to work in places where it has been used, but please make sure you're using the new format from now on. Here are some more examples:

`[Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")` becomes [Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")

`[Spoiler S01E01](/s ""OH MY GOD"")` becomes [Spoiler S01E01](/s ""OH MY GOD"")

`[Storyline Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")` becomes [Storyline Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")

You've been watching ModNight on ACN, I'm Divtya Budhlya.

Good night.

With Sorkin's style of retelling a major event and then having his characters play it out he way he would've liked to have seen it treated by the media.  I liked that.  A lot.  So what if it was an imaginary liberal paradise?  This show isn't out there to please every demographic/political persuasion, or be realistic.  This show has (or at least had) a very specific gimmick, and I enjoyed that.

I think the criticism of the show has made it much more mellow, judging only by first episode (so I may be completely wrong).  It seemed like Sorkin was offering this Genoa scandal to the group as sort of a mea culpa, to bring them down a few notches.  As if to say, look at them, they're not perfect, so please stop hating me....please....

Don't misunderstand me - I'm not coming from the left (not entirely anyway) to say this show is now not liberal enough for me.  But I enjoyed the second guessing and seeing the characters succeed where the traditional news media has failed.  I like Sorkin a lot because of the West Wing.  He doesn't always give the audience what they want or expect, and gives us something we never thought we'd like in the first place.  But I'm not liking where this season is headed.

Neil is incredibly smart and we all know that. He's can think analytically and on his feet. Why in the world would be push SO HARD for them to look at/consider a show about Bigfoot while the entire staff is working to report credible news? I'll tell you my theory...


He has been working the troll story since day 1 practically and part of his real initiation was verifying that he eventually got Will to look at his Bigfoot presentation and even consider it. Am I out of bounds here or does this seem to be in the realm of reality? He also briefly suggests contact with alien life so that kind of suggests he may be a mild conspiracy theorist, but just think about how quickly he jumped from Bigfoot to the troll story and let me know what you think.

1345095560.0	yb1l1	3 episodes in and somewhat disappointed with the politics	Pennoyer_v_Neff	35	24	63	"I loved the first episode.  Thought it was inspiring.  But now that I am three episodes in I've become somewhat jaded by the left-leaning politics that I just can't seem to avoid.

Let me also say that I'm a liberal, always have been,m and will be voting Obama.  I agree with all the stuff about the Koch brothers, tea party, and that stuff, but it annoys me that the ""new"" direction of ACN is to attack republican policies (don't get me wrong, they deserve it).  They even admit that they are becoming ""msnbc's older brother.""  

If you're reporting facts, why not throw in some stories about Obama's failures?  His secret attack drones?  His medical marijuana crackdown?  The questionable enforcement policies of the RIAA abroad?  There might not be as much to attack with Republicans but there is still stuff there.  I feel like this stuff could have been added it in to make it feel more real while still maintaining this underlying corporate interest antagonist plot.

I dunno I guess I just feel like the show is trying to pass itself off as intellectual and moderate but I'm not buying it.  The paint the main character as a republican who is growing displeased with his party but in reality he turns into Don Lemon literally overnight.  I just hope that the show doesn't continue down this path because it dilutes what could have been a pretty amazing program.

Special bonus from the pilot: The pilot episode of Newsroom was thematically similar to the pilots of The West Wing and Studio 60 in that they revolved around an important character making a public, controversial, politically incorrect, but true statement about the country and/or its political divisions and the ramifications thereto, with a loveable boss stepping in to defend the statement and using it as a launching pad to effect some kind of positive change.

1374894370.0	1j52hi	Just started watching The Newsroom. My thoughts.	Cakey123	40	29	13	"Initially I was a little bit put off by the very artificial dialogue. The constant bantering and (hyper)articulate way in which the characters expressed themselves is a little off-putting at times; people just don't speak like that. I had the same problem for House and that's why I never liked it -- that and I despise the character of House who is not lovable but arrogant and *dogmatic*. (The latter is the most annoying thing because we are supposed to believe he is at all times rational and possessing ridiculous intelligence.)

This show won me over because unlike House it is not mean-spirited. The show is corny but it's a good kind of corny that you can't help but love (I just finished watching the episode ""Amen"" were they cover the protests in Egypt and I couldn't help but get a bit misty-eyed at the end despite of how *deliberately* corny it was). Now starting the next episode and hearing the theme song play I am charmed by the show. In House you just don't feel the love. You are fed that this character and that other love each other in this certain way but you just don't feel it; it's never there. The bantering in that show is always hostile and mean-spirited which makes it unenjoyable 
on that alone but also it further decreases credulity that the situations could ever happen in reality. Any human would not live in such a hostile environment for long.

The last thing is that the character of Will is a bit of an arrogant prick but he's well-intentioned so you can't help but like him, and more importantly he's a believable character. He is a well-rounded human character with human flaws. In complete contrast the character of House is this Mary Sue with really artificial flaws that do nothing for the character. What's more he is supposed to be this rational modern-day Sherlock but more often than not he gets the solution to his medical mysteries from ridiculous epiphanies; and sure they will fit but there is no reason why it should be certain except that the character is dogmatic and will believe whatever he has decided to set his mind to (just so long as it is not self-contradictory). What irks me about this is that everyone I know who loves that character does so because despite his prickly attitude he is such an astounding genius! It truly is a poor man's Sherlock, and a shame because I love Hugh Laurie. But why am I ranting about House? It's just that I feel Will is what the character of House done right is like."	t5_2rd6i	True

GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may, 

Old time is still a-flying : 

And this same flower that smiles to-day 

To-morrow will be dying.


The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun, 

The higher he's a-getting,

The sooner will his race be run, 

And nearer he's to setting.

That age is best which is the first, 

When youth and blood are warmer ; 

But being spent, the worse, and worst 

Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time, 

And while ye may go marry : 

For having lost but once your prime 

You may for ever tarry.

* Jeff Daniels-Will McAvoy - Just killing it so far. I like the idea that he is a brilliant conservative doing this show. I would like to see a few sequences of him taking liberals to task on air (as he did in the immigration debate they were having in the show planning, for example) but overall he is the best part of the show. 

* Emily Mortimer-Mackenzie MacHale - Something is off so far. I really want to like her, because I enjoy Mortimer a good deal. The balance of ""talented professional"" and ""quirky lady with real problems"" is way off here. Her ""issues"" tend to ruin any illusion in my head that she is a strong, capable person. I really enjoy her rousing speeches though, so I'm hoping they can move her more towards the way I felt about Dana in Sports Night (not perfect, but very likable).

* Sam Waterston-Charlie Skinner - Sorkin will never not nail this role apparently, and neither will the actor cast in it. I love the balance between grizzled veteran boss and drunken smart ass. I hope they get into some of his work that does not relate to News Night going forward.

* John Gallagher Jr.-Jim Harper - Again I am on the fence with this character. The balance between brilliant and socially inept is not sitting well here either. (Tangent: I really, really think they should have made his Halliburton contact in the first episode someone he met in Afghanistan. This makes it seem like less of a fluke, and makes him seem more capable). I really would like them to back off the heavy handed love triangle, if only to build some tension and chemistry. Having Alison Pill's character be in a mildly abusive relationship while coming into her own professionally is interesting enough without an obvious foil.

* Alison Pill-Maggie Jordan - Probably the most problematic character for me thus far, which is sad because I like Pill quite a bit. I just can't buy that capable people act this way, and to pile a panic attack moment on top, complete with rescue from the knight in shining armor, is just inexcusable. There is a way to write a strong woman with a shitty boyfriend without making the woman seem unrealistically weak. There is a way to write drunken breakups, work mistakes (the boyfriend phone call?) and anxiety disorders without ruining a character, but Sorkin has struck almost none of the right notes. Ironically, I think she has fairly good chemistry with both the guys in this triangle, but I would like to see it end, if only so I can respect her character again.

* As for the others, I have been pleasantly surprised with Dev Patel and Olivia Munn in limited time. The decision to put in Jane Fonda, and then have her silent for ~ 45 minutes was sheer brilliance. I personally have no problem with the show being preachy. They are doing the news with the benefit of hindsight, so of course it is going to be a tad know-it-all-ish. To me, that is the basis of the show, so I never expected any less. Were people expecting them to do a news show set in the past where they made all the same mistakes the news actually made? Would anyone watch that?

* Overall, the show has been wildly entertaining, with some serious flaws. How are you all feeling about it?"	t5_2rd6i	True

Well, in S02E03 we see Maggie is now on medication to get out of the country, the medication causes hallucinations, paranoia, mood swings, and all sorts of mental problems. Instead of something happening to her in Africa, could the medication just make her lose it for a bit? Just some tinfoil/speculation I suppose... input?"	t5_2rd6i	True
1366900484.0	1d31p0	The Newsroom's Flaws	CUROplaya1337	12	6	40	So this is a relatively small community clustered around a television show that I love. A lot of the posts here, however, are fairly tepid. One or two lines of text about how much we love a particular aspect of the show has become a normal contribution to the sub. Instead of that, I thought it would be a good idea to discuss the widespread criticisms of Season 1 before Season 2 emerges. Emily Nussbaum at The New Yorker [wrote what I think is a representative collection of criticisms](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2012/06/25/120625crte_television_nussbaum) that was echoed by many.

So assuming she actually sticks around for season two (which I see as a 50/50 chance right now) this is what I think her characters direction will be. 

We know already from the season finale that she originally wanted to be a reporter before eventually settling into being a gossip columnist. It's also fairly likely that she still has some attraction towards Will as evident in her leaking the pot story to Mac. With these two points I think Nina will either end up working at News Night or will move on to reporting for some other news organization, possibly a compeditor. This change in career path will open up the possiblity of her and Will dating which will supply the Will-Mackenzie romance with needed drama as their older wounds begin to heal.

The Northwestern speech was there to setup the news show. Sure, it may have also been used as a mouthpiece for Sorkin, but it still had a purpose that is relevant to the show. Sorkin uses it to point out the two, arguably, biggest problems in the country: (1) Demagogue pundits and incumbents who polarize the country with dogma and vitriol (2) An uninformed, misinformed, and dogmatic electorate. The purpose of the speech is to make explicit these problems. The speech also convinced Don that Will's show is a ""sinking ship."", forcing him to leave. This is *very* important because Don's leave makes room for Mackenzie. Then, thanks to Don leaving, Mackenzie convinces Will to fundamentally change the show. She wants to address those two issues, whereas Will planned to continue running the same neutral, ""Jay Leno"" kind of business.  Lastly, while he's onstage, you can clearly see how neutral he is (until he has the outburst of course). Will was constantly dodging questions with humor, the host onstage mentioned that nobody knows his political allegiance, he was referred to as the Jay Leno of news, etc. Again, I do think Will was being used Sorkin's mouthpiece in the scene, but I also think it was critical in setting up the show. I've never watched a Sorkin show(born too late), but I'm beginning to see his brilliance. He's capable of creating scenes full of character development and drama, all the while preaching to the audience. 

I just feel like a lot of people watched that scene and thought it was entirely unnecessary other than being Sorkin's mouthpiece, but I think it's one of the most critical scenes of the pilot."	t5_2rd6i	True

Almost the entire cast came and they were all incredibly smart and well-spoken. We saw 10 minutes from the Season 2 premiere and there is absolutely no quality loss from Season 1. Very very excited to see what else is in store. Sounds like season 2 will run through [Spoiler](/s ""the end of 2012 and possibly get into Sandy Hook. Sorkin was really timid about talking about Sandy Hook because he doesn't want to belittle it."")

It's going to be an incredible season. I've seen some really bad moderators at PaleyFest, Piers Morgan was not one of them. He knew and loves the show and was able to give all of these real life anecdotes about how the show is real-to-life.

Audience was thoroughly engaged the entire time and probably the best part of the night was when a woman in the front row stood up and ask Jeff Daniels, ""Why is America the greatest country in the world?"" Perfect. Deadpan delivery. The entire theater erupted into laughter and clapping. It could have gone so horribly wrong but it was perfect. Once the laughter died down, Jeff Daniels says with a straight face: ""It's not. But it can be""

In the original airing, I recall that line being, ""... a centrepiece of the Mike Lee's stump speech is repealing the 14th Amendment.""

[Anthony Bologna pepper spray](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-29-2011/democracy-on-the-lurch---wall-street-pepper-spray-incident)

So a couple takeaways:

- First: The Daily Show website deserves an award for it's complete accessible archive of all it's videos.
-  TDS also does a really great job of reporting on stories while giving an editorialized perspective on the content much like Will McAvoy does, but does so via the lens of comedy and satire.
-  Other cable news organizations clearly do report what's happening in the world.  For example, if the Newsroom universe was real, I'd be pretty damn pissed that Lawrence O'Donnel did a Sorkin-esque take down piece on officer Anthony Bologna but ACN *didn't make one mention of the entire incident*.  This was a pretty huge story that I remember vividly front paging Reddit as well as being on many news outlets for days.  Even Fox News covered it, as was shown in last nights episode, albeit mockingly.


So basically, the idea that ACN is the only news outlet that's doing their jobs properly is completely fabricated, and yes I realize it's a fictional show but it's aim is to place itself squarely in the middle of the real world 2 years ago.  By contextualizing the happenings of those days with a 30 minute comedy show that airs on the same network as Drunk History and Tosh.0, you start to understand just how great a job TDS really does and why it wins Emmys year after year.  That said I'm still a fan of The Newsroom, but I'm going to have to stop pretending that their own newsroom is as cracked up as they make it out to be."	t5_2rd6i	True

1340653731.0	vl6dp	I figured out what's been bugging me about the pilot episode of The Newsroom...	flossdaily	9	6	13	"I think they started the show from the wrong point in the dramatic arc. 

At first glance it looks like we open up with our main character having an epiphany and breaking out of his mediocre lot in life.  But as the show progresses it becomes clear that this is a misinterpretation.  He hasn't had a change of heart, he had a slip-up.

It's clear, then, that this is not a story about a man who is taking a bold step forward.  It's about a man who has to be dragged kicking and screaming towards his own destiny.

I think the show would have been vastly more satisfying if we'd spent some time watching him suffer in his daily routine.  I could appreciate his character development more if I could understand how his life made sense before our story started.

The pilot should have been about his old life as a boring anchor finally making him snap.  The episode should have ended with his great speech instead of opening with it.

The show we just watched should have been episode 2, and it should have involved a little more soul searching on the part of the anchor, instead of having everything be driven by his returning love interest/producer.

“We're seventh in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, No. 4 in labour force, and No. 4 in exports,”

“America leads the world in only three categories: Number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending.  Where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined.""  

These are the comments a news anchor yelled at a college sophomore during a conference held in at Northwestern University.  It was all fiction: the anchor, sophomore, and the conference.  Those stats are very much real, so is Northwestern University.

The first episode of Aaron Sorkins latest project ""The Newsroom"" has the speed and tensity of his debut series ""Sports Night"" and the emotional ties that came with the 7 years of ""West Wing"".  

After the opening scene and some character melodrama we learn that the day is that of the BP oil spill.  While the other news organizations are reporting a massive auto wreck and the new iPhone prototype had been left at a bar; our heros are putting together that this blast isn't simply a search and rescue, but rather a massive corporate debacle and natural disaster.  

As always Sorkin breaks cerebral ground, this time by causing those who are willing to question the data provided.  Who was at fault for the spill? Where contingencies for this in place, and failed?  Two points of conversation that I enjoyed were the of linking Halliburton to negligent homicide for the deaths of the workers, and the numbers of government officials to drilling wells; 56:35000. 

The show stands on the perception that nightly news is spoon fed through corporate sponsors and watered down for the masses.  What Sorkin delivers is what would have been the news without the laundering.  Would the standard news room have more than just the fear of reprisal, but the fear of loss when running that story?  When a sponsor buys add time on a network, are they also buying their silence? 

Hopefully Mr. Sorkin will also be able to shine the spotlight on the Aztec two-step turndot once again.

1375154454.0	1jbp6v	Why Season 2 has been disappointing so far	BeerIsMyFriend	11	11	9	"There's practically zero news being reported! The reason season 1 was so good IMO was watching the team actually go through the process of gathering facts, then watching them as Mac and Will delivered the broadcast.

THAT was riveting television. We've seen countless dramas on TV before that cover the interpersonal relationships. What Sorkin is doing with this season is no different. It's not even interesting!

The approach of telling the end of the story (how the Genoa reporting will ""destroy"" the team) and then revealing the details progressively isn't new. It's been done well before, but removing the news gathering and reporting has left this show as a shell of itself.*

I'll continue to watch just in hopes that we'll see it return to its former greatness.

*caveat... I'm well aware that Sorkin decided on a different approach to the season with an over-arching theme and storyline; not to mention the massive rewrites and reshoots for the early season episodes.


Anyway, just my two cents. 

EDIT 08/05/13: So last night's episode was a little redemption for me. It's still heavily focused on the drama and interpersonal relationships more than the news gathering, but it was the best of the season I thought. "	t5_2rd6i	True

That roommate has got to feel a little trashy b/c Jim lied to Maggie, right? Or is she just being considerate by hiding sex from Maggie b/c of her crush. 

But in the end, it seems like that's the direction of the show for those two. Or is the show trying to make it so predictable, only to M. Night Shyamalan the audience. Same with Will and Mac. Don't we all know they'll end up together?

Some scenes she just seems stiff and awkward.  Maggie just seems to childish to be taken seriously as a producer.

JimmyJamesincorp	2	3	5	"When I saw the first episode I found it amazing, the idea to tell about how the news work for ratings instead of telling what is true and important is something that had the potential of being a really big thing. 

Instead all I'm getting is this guy's ego, people always being nervous like squirrells and Maggie's relationship problems (why exactly do I have to care about her again???)

I dunno, I thought this was going to be an important piece, like The Wire, instead I'm getting banal human interactions of people who work on the news. I'm kinda dissapointed. I still enjoy watching the show, and I'm willing to give it a chance to redeem itself, it's just nowhere near as groundbreaking as expected it to be after the first episode.

1340750401.0	vnk9k	One episode down and I already have a theory.[Pilot Spoilers]	SuitedPair	8	7	5	"We see Mackenzie at the end of the episode with the cue cards.  The obvious theory would be that she was actually there and encouraged him to speak the truth at the college.

  
What I am thinking right now is that after being asked the question(where he clearly does not look well), Will has a psychological break and enters a world in his head where he is the journalist he wanted to be when he joined the profession.  A woman who he is in love with(and hasn't seen for years) shows up with big sheets ready without knowing the question the college student was going to ask.  He flashes back and forth between Mackenzie and another woman.  He has absolutely no reason to imagine the other woman if Mackenzie was actually there.  And at the end of the episode, you see Mackenzie with the cue cards, so in this universe, she was there.

  
And then you have the BP storyline where he might have regretted not following risky leads and instead gave out vanilla reports and interviews.  In his mind, he has a new guy(Jim) with unbelievable connections and extremely accurate information.  You also have Charlie ignoring the corporate bosses and turning his Jay Lenoesque show into something you'd see Edward R. Morrow doing.

  
It's all seems way too perfect to me.  This is the kind of dream you have while lying awake in bed hoping to turn back time just so you could make all the right decisions with the benefit of hindsight.

  
Does this make any sense to you guys?

last week's episode was the nail in the coffin for me. 90% of the episode was soap opera, with sprinkling of 5% nationalist ""fuck-yeah-usa"" for the feel-good factor, and maybe 5% of insightful to newsroom decision making. After last week's telenovela I decided that I am officially done with the show. 

I feel betrayed by it. emotionally hurt that a show could start off so strong and descend into such garbage so quickly. 

I realize this is probably the wrong place to be complaining, but does anyone else share my sentiment. 

Does anyone else not give a shit about the personal lives or love interests of Jim or Maggie or Don? Unless it has relevance to the media industry (like McAvoy's fling with gossip columnist, or even his fling with the chick that was carrying, to highlight gun control) why should I give a shit.

During that there is a clear view of the basketball shot clock.  [Spoiler](/s ""The edited voice is fine, but the numbers in the shot clock jump the few seconds he edits out"")

WHICH is exactly what happens in my book released November 2012.  The name of the book is Investor. Here is the passage:

**Peter rewound and watched the game. Sal saw it at the same time that Peter did.  The game went from pre-snap to the huddle for another play.**

**“How did that happen?” Sal asked.**

**“This tape has been tampered with.  We are missing about 16 seconds of game time.**  

It was important to my story and it is going to be important to this story.  It is going to be [Spoiler](/s ""Jerry's undoing of why he gets fired.  He messed with the tape."")

So the question is, should I be trying to get a royalty check from Sorkin (I am kidding, I know he probably never touched my book unless he was one of the 20 people who bought it, which I seriously doubt).  The more logical thing is we both came up with the same idea independently.  And if he thinks it is good, then I guess I was on to something."	t5_2rd6i	True
1376523485.0	1kdu3s	The recurring theme of violence	ElmoOnLSD	2	4	14	I'm a big fan of The Newsroom. My one hang up about the show is how there has been a recurring theme of woman on man violence. Almost every episode has an example of a female character punching a guy, kicking him in the groan, pushing him against a wall, or throwing a drink in his face. The female characters are downright physically abusive of their male counter-parts and it's very distracting from what otherwise is a great show. My opinion is that, barring situations protecting life/limb, violence is NEVER acceptable regardless of the genders involved, and it's disturbing to see this sort domestic violence being promoted in the media.	t5_2rd6i	True
