All the bands were really great, I especially enjoyed Fit For A King. I could have enjoyed more bands' sets if it wasn't for all the douchebags who think its cool to randomly flail your limbs and start fights with each other. Hardcore dancers give hardcore music a bad name. Nobody wants to be jamming out to an awesome band (like Gideon on their home turf) and have to watch their backs at the same time. The pit is supposed to be a good natured thing, not somewhere a kid can purposely get elbowed in the face or take a kick to the stomach. The crowd in general at that show sucked, mostly because of the idiots trying to hurt everybody, and the people who were just trying to enjoy the show but had to watch themselves or get seriously hurt. Seriously, hardcore dancers, you are the reason that metal gets a bad name. Screw you guys.

Edit: Alright, alright. If you are a hardcore dancer but you are respectful about how you go about it, this wasn't intended for you. If you're a crowd killer and have nothing better to do than target people, you're the ones that suck. "	t5_2rfut	True

1367335741.0	1deyo2	THE KOREA - ultra assholes, avoid at all costs.	xzaox	131	14	25	"Let me tell you a story about a russian band called The Korea. They play a pretty good blend of modern metalcore, djent and whatnot. Technically intriguing, well produced etc. They have gathered some attention all over the world, they have over 32k likes on Facebook, and are generally respected in Russia. I've seen some of their vids posted here.  
  
Well guess what, THEY ARE MAYOR TWATS. I mean seriously. Recently they had a tour across Central and Eastern Europe, including 4 shows in Poland. Now, here's the summary of these gigs:  
  
Warsaw (capitol city)- they didn't play. Apparently some guy who booked that show didn't show up on his own gig. Well, he was from Germany, so perhaps that might be the case. Anyway, the band was really upset, because only about 10 people showed up, and allegedly they didn't get any money for the show. Let's say I was able to understand that they didn't want to play. Moving on.  

Wroclaw - they did a full, normal show. Except the fact they were constantly making fun of the local bands, showing absolutely no respect. I understand, that not every band has to be a world class metal supergroup, but for fuck sake, Korea is NOWHERE near being big, not the mention being in the position to pick at LOCAL SUPPORTS.  

Bielsko Biala - The band didn't play. They decided that there weren't enough people for a proper show, so they were just hanging around the club, eating food provided by the guy who organised the gig, making fun of the local bands, you know, the usual stuff. At this point I was starting to get really pissed, and needless to say, their reputation in Poland has reached the fucking ground. Therefore:  
  
Katowice - fucking ace in the hole. The Korea was the headliner for this show, so they played last. In the meantime they managed to:  
- draw dicks and random shit with a sharpie on one of the supporting band's cars  
- Detune other band's instruments (WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?)  
- the vocalist got in a fight with a fan.  

Finally the crowd was so pissed, that almost everybody left before The Korea was about to play. The band was apparently being gracious enough to play a 20 minute show.  
  
Now, I understand that playing for empty rooms might be painful. I know that, when the show manager fucks up, all you can think is how to beat the shit out of him. But come FUCKING on! The KOREA even posted a facebook post about all these situations, and guess what? Almost everything is made up, and written in a way to show, that they are innocent. Want proof? All negative comments on their profile posted by dissapointed fans WERE IMMEDIATELY DELETED. 
   
Douchebag rockstar attidute, complete disregard of THEIR OWN FANS, WHO DROVE for 5 FUCKING HOURS just to hear that the band will not play, because they don't like the crowd, mocking local bands, destroying their property, FIGHTING their own fans, and lying to our faces afterwards. This is what THE KOREA is, and I don't care how good their music might be. I seriously doubt they will ever show up in Poland again, after all that shit they've done.  
Now this is a shoutout and a fair warning to all of you guys - booking agents, promoters, and simply fans of good music, be it in Europe or in the US. DON'T SUPPORT THE KOREA, or you might end up being dissapointed. If you feel like it, please share this story with your friends. That is all.   
 
ps. There is a video footage of the fight, I'll post it later. "	t5_2rfut	True

1365459605.0	1by4op	Guide to one of the best metalcore bands of all-time: As I Lay Dying	jglobal	127	18	51	"As I Lay Dying is one of my favorite bands of all-time and I consider them among the best metalcore bands. While not one of the founders of metalcore, As I Lay Dying can definitely be credited with helping the genre become popular. It's true that they have changed throughout the years, but in my opinion, it has always been for the better. I will now discuss their discography, starting from their first album. Enjoy!



**Beneath the Encasing of Ashes (2001)**
If you only know As I Lay Dying from their most recent work, this will sound like a completely different band. This era of As I Lay Dying is more on the hardcore side of the spectrum of metalcore, and here Tim Lambesis sounds very much like Dan Weyandt from Zao (which is not a bad thing). While good, this is not a perfect album and some songs start to sound the same. 



Top tracks: Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, A Breath In the Eyes of Eternity, and Behind Me Lies Another Fallen Soldier(the latter track was re-recorded in the band's next studio album).



**As I Lay Dying/American Tragedy Split (2002)**
This is more of an EP than an album, but it contains some great songs including one of the band's most popular songs, Forever. All of the songs here were later re-recorded for other albums. I personally prefer this version of Forever over the one from Frail Words Collapse because of the faster tempo.  



Top tracks: Forever, Reinvention.



**Frail Words Collapse (2003)**
This is when As I Lay Dying started to become popular in the metalcore scene. Frail Words Collapse is definitely a classic metalcore album. The songwriting is just much better compared to their earlier work; the songs are able to be differentiated from each other and the album has a nice flow to it. The guitars while simple, have a nice sound to them but the standout from the album is definitely Jordan Mancino, the drummer. When I first got into metalcore, I remember listening to 94 hours and the part when the double bass came in blew my mind. Tim Lambesis' vocals improve even more and he no longer sounds like Dan Weyandt. Overall, a great album. 



Top Tracks: 94 Hours, Distance is Darkness, Elegy.



**Shadows Are Security (2005)**
As I Lay Dying really got popular after this album was released, and deservedly so; Shadows Are Security is awesome. The band really started to change up their familiar sound here; the guitar riffing is more intricate and heavier, there are a few guitar solos, and there is some actual singing in some of the songs, courtesy of Clint Norris, the bassist. Norris would leave the band soon after, but the singing would remain and become even more prominent in later albums. 
To me, Shadows are Security is the definition of metalcore; there are actual metal riffs present, complete with many hardcore style breakdowns and harsh vocals. Some bands that are considered metalcore lie closer to the hardcore style, but this album seems to be in the middle. Speaking of breakdowns, this album is chock-full of them, my favorites being the end of Through Struggle and the middle of Reflection.



Top Tracks: Confined, Reflection, Through Struggle.



**A Long March: The First Recordings (2006)**
This is a compilation album, but if you are a newer fan or don't have these songs it is highly recommended to pick this up. This album contains Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, the AILD/American Tragedy Split songs and re-recordings of those songs. The re-recorded songs are the same songs on Frail Words Collapse with the exception of Illusions, which is the same version from Shadows Are Security minus the intro, and Reinvention, which was released on this compilation for the first time.



Top Tracks: Reinvention(re-recorded), Forever, Behind Me Lies Another Fallen Soldier(re-recorded).



**An Ocean Between Us (2007)**
To me, this is As I Lay Dying's career defining album. Up to this point they were a really good band. I feel that this is the album which made them truly great. Nick Hipa and Phil Sgrosso, the guitarists, really come into their own here; there are more solos throughout, and the guitar work is much more complex than it was in the band's earlier albums. This is the point where the band started to shift to more metal-influenced metalcore. Sure there are still breakdowns and other hardcore elements, but it sounds so much different from their earlier albums; Within Destruction, for example, sounds like a thrash song in places. There are absolutely no duds here; from the opening riff of Separation to the piano-ending of This is Who We Are, this album shreds. I will give recommended tracks, but really the whole album is worth having; it's that good.



Top Tracks: Nothing Left, Forsaken, The Sound of Truth.



**The Powerless Rise (2010)**
The Powerless Rise sounds like a continuation of An Ocean Between Us, and that is by no means a bad thing. The band sounds even tighter and more technical than before, and the songs are very good. I may prefer An Ocean Between Us slightly more, but that's just because that album is ridiculously good. I will admit that there are a couple songs on The Powerless Rise that I didn't necessarily love (Without Conclusion and Condemned, if you want to know), whereas every song on An Ocean Between Us was great. Overall, a very good follow-up. 



Top Tracks: Anodyne Sea, The Plague, The Blinding of False Light.



**Decas (2011)**
Another compilation album, but this one is definitely worth a listen. Decas contains 3 new songs, and they are not just new songs but some of the best work the band have ever done, including Paralyzed, which might just be my favorite As I Lay Dying song ever. There are also 3 good covers, a medley of the song Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, and some remixes which I don't care for. Decas is worth it alone for the new songs, in my opinion, and the covers are pretty awesome as well.	



Top Tracks: Paralyzed, From Shapeless to Breakable, Moving Forward.



**Awakened (2012)**
This is As I Lay Dying's latest offering. The band chose to change a few things up this time around: Adam D, the legendary metalcore producer who had produced their last 2 studio albums, was not chosen to produce the album, but the Bill Stevenson did a good job in his place. Also, it's a small thing, but this is the first studio album in a long time to not feature Jacob Bannon's awesome artwork, which is disappointing as a long-time fan. The sound is pretty similar to their last 2 albums, but in my opinion it's lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. Some of the songs on Awakened are among the best of the band's career, yet there are a few that I do not care for at all, which really hasn't happened since their first album. I still think Awakened is a good album, just not up to the high standards set by its predecessors.

In ancient times, constellations and star charts were serious indicators of future events, like changes in weather patterns and in some cultures, actual events. 

So a man tying down the stars would be a metaphor for man's natural desire to want to control his own fate. 

Just my interpretation, anyways.

Parkway Drive is one of my favorite bands and I've been following them avidly since *Killing With A Smile*.  I know that many of you guys like them too, so I figured I'd make a handy little guide for those who haven't really gotten into Parkway yet. 

**Something to note:  The ""Must-Hears"" at the end of each segment are not necessarily the most popular tracks on that album. Rather, I chose songs that I personally think showcase the tone, variety and themes of the album as a whole.**

Split CD with I Killed The Prom Queen / *Don’t Close Your Eyes* EP (2004)

The split CD with IKTPQ consisted of only two songs, but I included it because it essentially began their recording experience.  The two songs on the split CD were “I Watched” and “Swallowing Razorblades”.  These were both remastered on the *Don’t Close Your Eyes* EP.  The EP immediately garnered the band a following in their local area; its recording quality is somewhat lesser than following albums, but this lends a raw depth to the music that goes in tandem with Winston’s screams, which are a bit higher and looser than any other PWD album.  The raw tone of this EP makes it sound angry and dark, and many of the lyrics coincide with that tone.  It deals with death and hopelessness in a unique manner—the lyrics give the listener a sense of “me against the world”; I compare the writing in this album to that of a story about an anti-hero.  He is battered and broken, but will keep fighting simply out of anger and spite.  This tone and theme is extremely prominent in following works.  Even in the song “Don’t Close Your Eyes”, it addresses friendship and love in a uniquely dark but still positive way.

**Must-hears: “Smoke ‘Em If You Got ‘Em”, “Flesh, Bone and Weakness”, “The Cruise”**

*Killing With A Smile* (2005)

This album is what got me personally into metalcore.  It is crushingly powerful but blends melodic riffs and clean guitar into the music to perfectly compliment Winston’s voice.  I got hooked right away after listening to “Romance Is Dead”.  It also provided PWD with a more diverse fanbase and pushed them further into the Australian metalcore scene.  It is worth pointing out that this album is the best example of Winston’s voice as it transferred between the raw, higher scream on the EP and the heavier, deeper screams we hear on *Deep Blue* and *Atlas*.  This CD features harmonious guitar riffs in almost all of the songs, giving this album a special tone to the music that, while present in following works, isn’t quite as prominent.  Song themes are very heavily based on lost love, pain and religion.  However, the overall theme of this album is exactly what the title suggests:  Killing with a smile.  It deals very cynically with attention-whores and the materialistic nature of modern society and suggests that they don't deserve to live if they are going to live in that way.  Several tracks feature snippets from popular movies, like Pirates Of The Caribbean and Die Hard that overlay the theme of the song.  
	

**Must-hears: “Romance Is Dead”, “Gimme A D”, “A Cold Day In Hell”**

*Horizons* (2007)

*Horizons* was not only PWD’s international breakout album, some consider it their best.  I’m going to say right now that I love this record.  If KWAS got me into metalcore, *Horizons* made me a full-on metalhead.  This is one of my all-time favorite albums.  But let’s talk about the music.  The styling is extremely similar to KWAS; melodious riffing mixed with powerful breakdowns and a commanding vocal performance on every single song.  Winston’s voice is authoritative and potent; his singing on this album is among the best I’ve heard on any hardcore CD.  The themes continues from KWAS as well, bringing a cynical, angry perspective on modern society and its hollowness as well as revenge and personal struggle.  It reflects, many times, the writer’s desire to wipe out the entire world and start over fresh.  It heavily utilizes metaphorical language, especially referring to winter, snow and the cold (seriously, think “The Grey” with Liam Neeson, except in music form). 
	
**Must-Hears:  “Carrion”, “Idols and Anchors”, “Boneyards”**
^Seriously ^though, ^just ^listen ^to ^this ^entire ^album.  ^You ^won’t ^regret ^it.

*Deep Blue* (2010)

*Deep Blue* was, in my opinion, an excellent follow-up to *Horizons*.  The style of the music changed somewhat to reflect the darker and more intrinsic material in this album.  While a handful of songs still dealt with the sour, shallow direction the modern world has taken, *Deep Blue* focuses on the inner struggles of a person lost in the same shallow world that KWAS and *Horizons* has depicted.  What I loved about this album is that it almost has a story-like quality to the lyrics.  **I know, I know, but hear me out on this one.**  As I said before, as you listen to each track, it gives you the impression that you are following a man through his life as he desperately tries to reconcile his personal anger and fury with the crushing pressure of the outside world to conform to the greed and indifference of the general populace.  It often implies that he wishes he were never born so that he didn’t have to undergo this battle and, in his confusion, turns inward, to his own anger.  The first 6-7 tracks convey his hopelessness and loneliness in the world that he considers so disgusting.  In “Deliver Me” (which I view as the climax of the ‘story’), he turns away from all religions, beliefs and people, instead canonizing his own fury and lashing out against the world.  In this moment, he returns from the brink of death, possibly suicide, which is detailed in “Karma”; he then gathers himself in “Home Is For The Heartless” and asks for forgiveness for the war he will begin in “Leviathan I” and “Set To Destroy”.  This idea of war is again perpetuated in the beginning tracks in *Atlas*.  This is all my theory, of course, but I think because of these story-like qualities, this album has a depth and strength not found in earlier works.  It’s also worth mentioning that while *Horizons* featured metaphors mainly concerned with the cold/snow/etc., *Deep Blue* (as the name suggests) is focused on metaphors dealing with the ocean, water and drowning.

**Must-Hears:  “Sleepwalker”, “Karma”, “Home Is For The Heartless”**

*Atlas* (2012)

As *Deep Blue* was a mature, subtly dark, step in the right direction for PWD, *Atlas* continued heading in that direction while still evolving the basic sound and tone of the music.  Containing more versatile sounds than previous albums, *Atlas* featured a very wide range of styling and tone, especially because they bring in several new mediums—notably a full string quartet, a female vocalist and trumpets—throughout the album.  You will also notice that there aren’t as many breakdowns in this album, instead substituting more melodic bridging and the afore-mentioned new musical mediums.  Thematic elements in this CD also varied greatly, addressing religion, death, love, friendship and loss.  I think of all the preceding works, *Atlas*’ themes are most similar to the *Don’t Close Your Eyes* EP; it has a very strong presence of the anti-hero mentality I spoke about earlier; it often gives you a feeling of you against the world, but making you feel like you’re not alone in your struggle (“Forever the underdogs!”).  This part of the thematic element is, I think, the main connection between *Atlas* and *Deep Blue*.  There are two more themes I’d like to discuss briefly as well.  PWD showed a political side as some songs talk about the harm to the environment that humans are causing, especially “Dark Days”, warning against the rapidly deteriorating state of the planet.  The other is the distance between the band members and their loved ones.  I think this is especially powerful because it shows up on one of their later albums; it shows the downside to finally achieving the fame that they have been working for their entire lives.  I know that it’s not one of the more popular tracks on this album, but I personally love the song “Atlas” for that exact reason:  It grapples with the distance and disconnection between the writer and his loved ones while acknowledging that he’s been working for his entire life to get here.  The line towards the end (“A thousand eyes stare back at me but the ones that I’d die for are the ones I can’t see”) gives me chills every single time.  I really want to just break down each song on this album because I have a lot to say about each of them individually, but you should listen to them yourself and discover its meaning to you personally.  I would also like to say that I think that Winston’s vocals in this CD are his best ever; they perfectly convey the message of each song all while being just as crushingly powerful as in all previous CDs.  

**Must-Hears:  “Dark Days”, “The River”, “The Blue and the Grey”**


I could go on and on about this band, but I seriously encourage you to sit down and listen to all of these albums.  You will find a lot more meaning in them than I can tell you, and the music will absolutely blow you away.  

Comments, critique and all that is perfectly welcome, but keep in mind that much of this is my opinion.

Edit: Thank you, u/bhoward19! That was my fault.

1365659389.0	1c4b1o	First, AILD, then TDWP, then Parkway Drive... Now here's mine about August Burns Red...	TamponTunnel	89	12	21	"Here's a beginners guide to another heavyweight of the metalcore world: August Burns Red. Widely known for their use of unconventional meters in their music, as well as instruments not normally heard in the genre, August Burns Red is a staple of metalcore. Current members include Jake Luhrs (vocals), JB Brubaker (lead guitar), Brent Rambler (rhythm guitar), Dustin Davidson (bass), and Matt Greiner (drums).

 ***Looks Fragile After All*** (2004)

The bands first EP, at the time Jon Hershey was the bands vocalist. The EP has a very notable heavy metal influence, and it launched the band into the scene. It has a noticeably darker feeling than the albums of late. Hershey's vocals are a low point of the EP, being that he was not an experienced vocalist at the time of the recording. The rest of the band was very clearly more talented than him, and it shows in this EP. Hershey left the band shortly after the EP was released and was replaced by Josh McManness. The band signed with Solid State Records in 2005.

Key Songs: ""Accidental Shot Heard 'Round the World"", ""Glory Thrives""

***Thrill Seeker*** (2005)

The bands initial full length album, released under Solid State Records, showed a noticeable growth in the band. Face melting lead guitar riffs from JB, and explosive drumming from Matt is what really drove this album. This album is the first big show of ABR's use of odd meters in their music. Audibly challenging to comprehend at first, this isn't your typical headbanger album. A beautiful blending of powerful breakdowns, mind blowing riffs, and confusing, bizarre meters, *Thrill Seeker* was an album unlike any so far in the genre. The complexity of this album takes more than one listen to fully take in. The instrumentals still vastly overshadow the vocals, but they are an improvement from *Looks Fragile*. *Thrill Seeker* finally gave ABR a national fan base, and from there they toured non-stop.

Key Songs: ""Speech Impediment"", ""Your Little Suburbia is in Ruins"", ""A Shot Below The Belt"", ""The Seventh Trumpet""

***Messengers*** (2007)

This is the first ABR album I heard, and I was completely blown away. The quintessential August Burns Red album, this is the one that made them a household name in the metalcore community. This was also the first time Jake Luhrs fronted the group, and the new vocals were a huge piece that was gained in *Messengers*. When you thought JB couldn't write anything more complex than before, he blows you away in the first song of the album (""The Truth of a Liar""). Matt steps it up as well, laying down some of the most rhythmically complex drumming you will ever see or hear. Jake brought to the band something they were dearly missing, powerful vocals. Till this point, the band had the instrumental talent, but lacked the vocal power they needed. Jake was the gunpowder they got, and he brought forward some of the most charged and in-your-face vocals I've ever heard. This is largely considered to be the bands breakthrough album, and many consider it to be ABR's best album to date. I find it hard to disagree, this album is what got me into metalcore. 

Key Songs: ""Back Burner"", ""Composure"", ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""An American Dream"", ""The Truth Of A Liar""

***Lost Messengers: The Outtakes*** (2009)

An EP released after extensive touring following *Messengers*, it contained songs that are considered a departure from *Messengers*, most notably ""Piano Man"". A 7 song EP, it included two demos from *Messengers*, as well as their version of ""Carol of the Bells"". It's one of the lesser known releases of the band, with the exception of ""Carol"", and is quite underrated. It shows a much more ""metal"" side to the band, and is definitely worth a listen.

Key Songs: ""Carol of the Bells"", ""Chasing the Dragon"", ""To Those About To Rock""

***Constellations*** (2009)

To me, the largest improvement of this album over the last is Matt's drumming. I didn't really think it could improve skill wise, but what he did do was improve his congruency. In *Thrill Seeker* and *Messengers*, his parts would sometimes sound a little broken, or forced. Matt really stepped it up in this album, and this is definitely my favorite of his album performances. I also feel that this is a shining point for Jake's vocals in the band. It finally feels like Jake is leading the band in this album. His vocals were powerful in *Messengers*, but here, they blow away the listener. The band as whole feels more powerful in this album, as well as some new intricacies with the guitars, most obviously in ""Ocean of Apathy"" which features a jazzy, clean guitar and drum ""breakdown"". This is a huge shift for a band in this genre, as clean guitars and jazz stylings are almost never heard mixed with heavy, pounding riffs. This would eventually play onward into *Leveler*, and be a shaping factor in ABR's departure from the ""mainstream"" bands of metalcore. As if confusing meters weren't enough...

Key Songs: ""White Washed"", ""Marianas Trench"", ""Meddler"", ""Rationalist""

***Leveler*** (2011)

...starts with ""Empire"", an in-your-face explosion of musical force. ""Empire"" is a great catalyst of what is to come in ABR's fourth full length album. A distinctly upbeat start to the album, ""Empire"" is very different from the ABR of the past. This album is one of the most shining examples of the musical brilliance that resides within this group. This album lends to the feeling that, even though on the surface, everything looks okay, underneath something is very, very wrong. Though it may not be considered to be the best of their albums to date, it marks a distinct change in the band. In *Leveler*, they make a full departure from traditional ""mainstream"" metalcore. Not only do they bring back the combination of clean and distorted guitars, but a more expansive drum repertoire as well. Matt is heard using various latin instruments in ""Internal Cannon"", bringing a new flavor to metalcore. One that is more worldly, and far less close minded. Leveler is a true tour-de-force of August Burns Red, and it marks a separation point for future bands. They have set the bar, and now everyone else is playing catch up.

Key Songs: ""Empire"", ""Internal Cannon"", ""Pangea"", ""Carpe Diem"", ""Poor Millionaire""

**New Album** (2013-2014)

The band is currently in the process of recording their fifth full length album. JB was quoted as saying that their new album will ""...push the boundaries of our genre more than we ever have before. We set out to write a record where every song stands out from the last. There is a lot of ground covered here and a ton of meat to this album. It’s full of odd metered rhythms and breakdowns, unexpected twists and turns, and some of our most technical riffing to date. Each of us have parts that make our heads spin and we have had to practice like crazy to get some of this stuff together. I know we always say this, but this will be our most ambitious album yet.""



I know I left out *Home* and *Sleddin' Hill*, so I'll provide brief synopses of them here:

*Home* is a live album done by the band in 2010, it features selections from *Thrill Seeker*, *Messengers* and *Constellations* performed live.

*Sleddin' Hill* is a fully instrumental holiday album done by the band in 2012. It's a 13 song album comprised entirely of interpretations of famous Christmas songs, recorded by the band.

The vibe I get at shows now is totally different from when I was in high school (2001-2005 era). I love metalcore, I grew up with it.

Right now I'm having a musical crisis, and I am having trouble understanding if I am outgrowing the music, or the music is just changing in a way that my personality doesn't mesh with. So, any perspective on this would be much appreciated.

I feel like the climate of metalcore is turning into one of pure attention-seeking, as opposed to unity. The culture very much reminds me of the days of hair metal, a genre based solely off of fashion, conformity, groupies, hair, and maybe the music as an afterthought.

I think the instrumentals are good example of the regression that's happening. It seems in order to attain praise, your only requirement is to learn, literally, the easiest technique there is on the guitar. Seriously, 6 months of effort and you are on par with most of the guitarists that are in the spotlight. This speaks to a lot of kids I think. The genre began turning itself into something that every fan has a chance of achieving. 

Vocally, I feel it's becoming really lazy. The lyrical style, as well as the intonation of the vocals has made that apparent. Have you been noticing that many lyricists are changing their writing into a ""We"" style?

""We are the promised ones and nothing's in our way,
They can try but they'll never stop us.""

Just one example, but I'm sure most of you probably recognize this feature many lyricists are using. It's an ambiguous message used to generate mass appeal, because the listeners are the ones filling in their own theme. It's a marketing tool.

The live shows also demonstrate that desire for instant gratification. It's about the attention, and not delivering a well-rehearsed product. I hate the fact that I assume most clean singers can't actually sing live, or that most metalcore bands really don't measure up to their studio sound. Before recording software was so easily accessible, bands had to rely on their live sound to gain notoriety. Now, it seems the opposite is the case.

It just seems like there is an elephant in the room which never gets addressed. People fly off the handle about a band that does a decent breakdown, even if they just sound like the hundreds of bands that came before them.

Maybe I'm just pessimistic. Maybe I'm totally wrong about everything. I have loved this genre for 15 years, and I am hoping a new band will change my mind about what's happening. 

EDIT: u/xBBTx posted an incredibly eloquent and poignant article that touches on the very thing we have been discussing in here. I encourage any of you to give it a glance (http://myrandomcontemplations.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-belgian-scene/ ). But here's an excerpt which speaks volumes to me:

""I often get this feeling that bands are unsatisfied because they feel like they deserve better. There’s an unshakeable conclusion I draw from most of these bands, and that’s the idea that they’re not doing music for the sake of music. It’s rather that music has become an excuse to seek fame, and that creates egos that feel like they ought to be further along than where they are. Again, NOTHING is owed to any of us. Music is a field where you take your chances, and lay it all on the line. There are no guarantees for making it anywhere, but let’s be clear: The ONLY reason you SHOULD be a band is because you love playing music. If you’re intent is to become “big” then your intentions aren’t pure, and your music probably isn’t honest either.""

Me with today's daysheet in the HOB Greenroom.

Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like about the shows, music in a live environment, jobs in music, what it's like to tour, etc.  I've spoken with the moderators and let's keep this a positive time.  As I'm sure you can guess, I'm mildly busy babysitting these guys, so I will answer as I get time and as the bus internet keeps working.

I will not answer any questions that call for opinions on others.  I will not say what bands I think suck, questions about former members, who is an asshole, etc.

Also, I speak only for myself. I am not in AA! and can't read their minds, they only make my checking account bigger every Friday.

1327248308.0	oriym	Just got back from an August Burns Red concert even though I've never really got into them.....holy shit....	roastedbagel	62	6	78	"So last night I went to go see Silverstein, who was opening up for August Burns Red. 

Now, I actually have an album of ABR's but never really got into it, not because I didn't like it, but because I was just always listening to something else, and never got around to it. 

I have a hard time getting into a concert while a band is playing that I'm not familiar with the songs. Im the type of person that loves singing along, moving around, and really just genuinely getting into the music, so I only have a great time when I'm seeing a band I enjoy with songs I recognize (with the exception of it being a band I really like yet they're playing a new/unreleased song, that I can get into as well). 

With that said, after Silverstein was finished, I ended up staying for ABR, and I'm so glad I did as I was completely blown away. Despite not knowing any song they played, I found myself moving to the music and enjoying every bit of it. I'm sad to now realize that I didn't listen to their stuff earlier so I could have possibly enjoyed the show even more than I did last night, but there's always next time. 

So just wanted to rave about ABR for a moment I guess, and I'm not even sure if r/metalcore is a fan of ABR, but if you've been on the fence about them, I have to say, go see them live if anything. They put on such an amazing show I walked out of that concert almost enjoying them more than I did Silverstein who is one of my favorite bands. Also, I plan on buying all their other albums in the next couple of days so any suggestions on what I ""need"" to listen to first, let me know! 

Oh, I already have Leveler, so any other album I'll be purchasing. "	t5_2rfut	True

1367376275.0	1dgh6w	Important to keep in mind, for potential screamers of Reddit.	orechase	68	16	29	"I've heard this argument so many times, surprisingly, I feel the need to address this.

Often I have heard much dispute over the effects of cigarette smoking on scream vocals. I've heard some people come to claim so much that their screams sound better because they smoke, because of the distorted sound it creates supposedly. Also I've heard that there isn't any reason not to, as a touring musician, because part of the rockstar lifestyle so often involves drinking, drugs, smoking, etc. Though I'll never advocate drug use, this is not specifically anti-drug. This is a warning to those of you, who are prospective/practicing screamers, that this thinking is incredibly wrong and can lead to directly opposite effects on your vocals.

For example, with the claim that screams sound better with so-called “distortion” associated w/ cigarette smoking. People with “smoker's voices” often don't develop their distinct-sounding smoking voice, if at all, for years, or unless they smoke upwards of a pack a day for long periods of time. Also, the distortion is really non-existent in the sounds of aiding your screams. Intense vocals can be achieved (and have been achieved) without any use of cigarettes, and this can be proven in countless examples of straight-edge (or not necessarily straight-edge, but at least screamers that haven't smoked cigarettes regularly) vocalists with outstanding vocals, and even they would admit that smoking cigarettes, as a professional vocalist, is harmful to performance, tone, and the length of your career.

This also is not meant in particular to be anti-smoking. I don't mean to come off as the wise above-all guru waggling my finger down at you who do smoke but hope to be a vocalist. I just mean to show you the inaccuracy of such claims. You can take examples of famous vocalists that do smoke or did smoke, and it's evident the effects throughout the span of their career.

For example, Mike Hranica (TDWP) is one of the most influential metalcore screamers because of his ferocity and stamina. You can see him [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5WZlkhMUCA) in a near-perfect performance, endurance-wise, and tone-wise, from the post-With Roots/pre-Zombie time of the band. The most recent release from TDWP, two years later, was the live album Dead &amp; Alive, where [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSHUD-4mz_c) his voice sounds much more weary and shot. I understand that this was one of the last concerts of their tour, but also does not negate Mike's clearly-lacking performance in contrast to previous energy. His voice cuts short several signature screams in the song. You can especially tell in his performance of the opening song from the first concert link I gave you, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajz8kF9fIG4) is the same opening song as the other show. Even TDWP fans, if you are not one of them, would agree, despite your opinion of Hranica. Mike has been a smoker throughout his years in the band, and the effects on his voice have been especially strenuous as a touring vocalist.

This is because smoking cigarettes does not affect the tone of your screams, but more importantly, the stamina. It is as if someone tells you that smoking cigarettes will help you run a marathon. Cigarette-smokers know that their cardio tends to be much worse after they've started smoking than how it was before they started smoking. Especially for the engaging job of being a lead vocalist in a band w/ scream vocals, physicality is important for stage presence, and being able to use your full lung capacity when powerfully screaming night after night is essential.

I don't mean for the focus to be directed solely at Mike Hranica. You can see this in performers like Jonny Craig, Andy Biersack, etc. (Again, not everybody that I mention I am fans of, I use them for examples). Some performers do manage to pull it off, though I'd assume it would be a much easier job without the extra work your lungs are having to do, with less access to oxygen.

Even if you do not want to be a performer, and just want to be a studio vocalist, professionals and amateurs alike will advise you against smoking. YouTubers like Ryan Strain and J.T. Cavey advise against it in vocal training and recording, just as much as a touring musician would. Again, I would like to stress that the aim of this is focused on cigarettes, and less on marijuana, even though the affects are less severe, the tar in marijuana still will affect your lungs as a studio vocalist, still yet not nearly as badly as cigarette-smoking damages your performance. Because of the countless amount of professionals who are open in recreational marijuana use, it's hard to argue against as fervently as tobacco, but that is another discussion. Smoking neither would be ideal, but in the community especially for this kind of music, this can be an unrealistic hope, and several vocalists openly do. This however doesn't make it good for you in any way, or the good thing to do as a screamer.

To address the defense re. the rockstar lifestyle, just because the guitar player does, or the bassist or drummer does (though I doubt drummers would, because their job is just as physical if not more physical than any of their band members' jobs) doesn't negate the argument. The singer has a directly vocal-related job, and with the stresses of screaming, the intensity and demand for optimal lung capacity is critical. The guitar-player doesn't have to scream and jump around and engage the audience nearly as much as the singer does, night after night, and doesn't have to preserve his vocal ability and treat his voice to deal with touring. 
Apples are different than oranges; step down from your horse and join the twenty-first century.

**TL;DR** So just in case you're thinking that starting to smoke will help you be a better vocalist, don't start smoking, because it won't make you a better vocalist, it will make your vocals (or their potential ability if you haven't started yet) worse."	t5_2rfut	True

Tazthewonderdog	69	18	21	"Hey guys. I'm from a smaller city in Canada called Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Every year, our local promoter organizes a big-ass festival called MazzFest, with around fifty bands and three stages. Normally nearly 2,000 people show up.. not bad for a city of 200,000 ;) but anyway. Back on topic- every year, the festival looks for sponsors. More sponsors = bigger bands = more profit = more bigger bands in years to come. So, I figure, maybe if I get the word out and post this here, not only will more people in surrounding provinces hear about/attend the festival, but also more bands will hear about it and apply to play here (details coming in a sec)! And, maybe, just maybe, there's someone here with a label connection or something that would be willing to sponsor future MazzFests! That would be awesome. 

In the future, the guy running the festival wants to make into a Canada-wide tour, kind of like Warped only with more metal acts. If he gets sponsors, that will be sooner rather than later. So I'm just plugging a local festival hoping someone will be awesome enough to help out and spread the word :) 

AND. if you're in a band that would want to play this festival, hit up their facebook page and inquire [here](https://www.facebook.com/mazzfestival?fref=ts).


I hope to see this festival grow to the point where it's not just local anymore. I want it to come to the point where it becomes a concert tour with huge headliners like As I Lay Dying and Killswitch. This is me doing my part to spread the word.

Thanks for reading this, guys.

If this seems like a total dick move, sorry, and props to /u/shoesonshoes for taking the time to make it anyways.


For the purpose of this guide, I'll only be focusing on ""proper"" releases. While there are remix albums (Suicide Season Cut-Up and The Chill Out Sessions), as well as the Deathbeds ""EP"" (just Sempiternal b-sides), which you should definitely check out, I feel like the full releases should get the spotlight.


**This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For (2004):** Heavy and chaotic are definitely two words I would use to describe BMTH's first EP. It delivers an abrasive mix of deathcore (which was just picking up steam as this came out), mathcore riffing and some *slightly* more melodic metalcore stuff. Oli's vocals are less polished than future releases, which really adds to the speed, technicality, anger and overall messy sound BMTH achieves here. A pissed off record from pissed off teenagers which put BMTH on the radar, and laid the foundation for their next album.

Notable tracks: [Rawwwrr!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeky9agc2g&amp;list=PL35FB590D50EC4F9F), [Re: They Have No Reflections](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4OGXdxxNNA&amp;list=PL35FB590D50EC4F9F)


**Count Your Blessings (2006):** BMTH's debut, a heavy, ripping album that builds on the sound crafted by their EP. This album is very much old-school deathcore (as in, when it was just death metal and metalcore, and nu-metal wasn't in the mix at all). Breakdowns are definitely the star of the show here, and they are as heavy as they are numerous. Oli's vocals, as well as the whole band, get a much needed polish, and the instrumentation takes a slightly less mathcore turn. While the band have said that this is their least favorite album, as it is very much a show of how technical and brutal they could be, rather than about making great songs, they do slow it down for a few instrumentals (*Slow Dance* and *15 Fathoms, Counting*), and the album's outro certainly gives a hint at the melodic songwriting they are capable of.

Notable Tracks: [Pray for Plagues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWggPLXeOkU), [Braille (For Stevie Wonder's Eyes Only)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7vCgH-0P6k), [Off the Heezay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmOpCEhPZjI)


**Suicide Season (2008):** This is BMTH's bridging album, bringing in elements of their first two releases, as well as introducing things that have stuck since. Notable is the emphasis on being melodic. BMTH bring in choruses and singalongs, often accompanied by catchy riffs. Breakdowns still live, and they don't shy away from getting very heavy. Oli's vocals (which people were piiiiiissed about) get very much more metalcore, as he yells his way through most of the record, compared to showing off his range on CYB. Aside from that, I think that the guitar work on this album, which shows off the band's Slipknot influence, is one of the most major changes. The style of riffing is very groove oriented, and emphasizes quality rather than technical quantity. Electronics are also brought in in this release, though more in a ""nu-metal"" way than they are used now. The album is a lyrical step up, as well, as Oli begins to write about personal issues and feelings (that aren't just anger!). If there was any real ""starting point"" for the band, I believe that this would be it. It provides a nice mix of their different sounds throughout the years, and allows you to go either backwards or forwards in their catalog. 

Notable Tracks: [Chelsea Smile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiGrO1-hxk), [Diamonds Aren't Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJXReHSBpBY), [Sleep With One Eye Open](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FENo6gIWrk), [Suicide Season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLkgO3N6blM)



**There is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There is a Heaven, Let's Keep it a Secret. (2010):** This is the album where BMTH began to hone the sound that makes them unique in the metalcore scene. Electronics (programmed by artists like [Skrillex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6lVhGeyXuw) and Liam from KC Blizt throughout) come to the fore, creating musical textures that complement the heavy riffs and pounding drums. Jona Weinhofen also makes an appearance on guitar, which many believe pushed the band to take the extra steps toward their own sound. As a whole, this record is a lot slower and more melodic than past releases, but is not without some very heavy, scrappy tracks. [LIGHTS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5S1QxF-a6Y) lends her voice a few times on the album, giving the songs a softer female component. Oli's voice doesn't change much, aside from the exclusion of almost all CYB screaming and growling. Lyrically, this album deals more with Oli's personal issues, which lend to the deeper music the band created. Frederik Nordstrom, who also produced albums from bands such as InFlames and Opeth, gives the album a very organic, yet polished and professional sound, which helped to further differentiate BMTH from the metalcore scene.

Notable Tracks: [Crucify Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2_VVAmprxU), [Fuck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINPg7-w6yg), [Alligator Blood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShYBjIfJX1A), [Blessed With A Curse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH9Cyu51WdM)


**Sempiternal (2013):** The most recent, and in my opinion best, Bring Me the Horizon album, *Sempiternal* truly perfects the sound that the band was moving towards. Full of melody and depth, added in part by the inclusion of Jordan Fish, a proper keyboard player/programmer, each song on the album is incredibly catchy and well-written. (I know I'm raving a bit on this one). The instrumentation is fairly simply, a complete antithesis to BMTH's older albums, and the focus is definitely placed on showing off with good songs, rather than instrumental skill. The shift in instrumentation, coupled with Oli's ""cleaner"" vocals, can cause the album to sound a little poppy at times, which can definitely turn off people who really love CYB. Heavy tracks do still exist, but they are usually coupled with extremely catchy parts, making them a whole lot more dynamic. Singing is used again on this album, but it's all Oli, as no guest musicians (aside from the choir and orchestra) are brought in. This ensures a very ""pure"" BMTH experience, which I believe helps the album sound the exact way that they want it to. I would very much recommend this album to anyone, whether they like metal or not.

Notable Tracks: Honestly, this is one you should listen to [front to back](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5aibZNVqS4&amp;list=PLcZMZxR9uxC8x1b-IqehsFsSWemdLJWgk).

Iamlionrawr	62	12	36	"Well, after a long hard night of partying, I was sitting out on the balcony of my friends apartment, enjoying a cigarette before I went to pass out. I decide to play some music, and finally decide on some good old August Burns Red. 

As I'm leaning against the balcony, watching the city awake, I hear a noise to my right, and my friends ~45 year old neighbor walks out and sparks a smoke. He takes a couple introspective drags, and turns to me. 

""What you listening to there? It sounds pretty good!""

I'm fairly surprised, as this gentleman seems far too old to enjoy music such as this. I drunkenly mumble to him

""Oh this? They're called August Burns Red. "" 

I watch him fish his phone out of his pocket and boot up what I assumed to be notes, he asked me to clarify. I did so. 

""Thanks man,"" he said to me, ""I'm always on the look out for new stuff."" 

With that, he pitched his smoke over the railing and went back inside.

1365554313.0	1c12cs	After seeing the AILD guide yesterday, here is one on my favorite band here, The Devil Wears Prada.	SHITTINwhileTHINKIN	56	13	31	"As the title says, after seeing the [As I Lay Dying post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/1by4op/guide_to_one_of_the_best_metalcore_bands_of/) yesterday, I thought I’d tackle my personal favorite metalcore band, The Devil Wears Prada. As one of the biggest bands in this scene at the moment, TDWP is at the top of their game right now. TDWP formed in 2005 in Dayton, Ohio. The current members are Mike Hranica (vocals), Chris Rubey (lead guitar), Jeremy DePoyster (clean vocals, rhythm guitar), Andy Trick (bass), and Daniel Williams (drums). James Baney was the original keyboardist, but left the band on 2/22/2012. All other members are the original members. Now on to the discography. Enjoy!

**Patterns of a Horizon, 2005, The Foundation Recording Studios**

POAH is a raw demo that showcases the band’s early style. Every song that appears on this demo was re-recorded for Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord with minor lyrical and musical changes. The song that sounds the most different is Swords, Dragons, and Diet Coke, which I linked below. This was the first album Joey Sturgis produced and Mike Hranica was 16 years old when he laid down the vocals. There are very few hard copies in existence; if you have one, I’d love to buy it from you! 

Key tracks: [Swords, Dragons, and Diet Coke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2acZ7jPcwM); [Who Speaks Spanish? Colon Quesadilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUO0VAqhoI&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PL63846D13A67C0AAD)

**Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord, 2006, Rise Records**

Dear Love is essentially POAH, plus two new songs, Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over and Texas Is South. Once again produced by Joey Sturgis, Dear Love sounds like nothing that TDWP has released since. The rawness and emotion conveyed by the band here makes it a must-listen for all true TDWP fans. I would argue that this is their most melodic album, and is definitely not your typical Rise-core album. Yesterday I said that AILD’s 94 Hours was one of two songs that got me into this genre. Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over is the other. This is the album that James Baney had the most influence on; his keyboard takes center stage multiple times throughout the album. Unfortunately, the band doesn’t play any of these songs live often anymore.

Key tracks: Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over; Swords, Dragons, and Diet Coke

**Plagues, 2007 (rereleased 2008), Rise Records, Victory Records**

This is the album that TDWP became a heavy hitter in this genre. DePoyster’s singing improved greatly for this album, and as a result, there is much more singing on this album. Hranica’s vocals also gained a wider range, mostly in his deeps. This album has some really great breakdowns, such as the one in The Scorpion Deathlock. The most underrated song by the band is also in this album, Reptar, King of the Ozone. Craig Owens of Chiodos appears in You Can’t Spell “Crap” Without the “C”. Plagues also had great commercial success, peaking at #57 on the Billboard 200 and two songs, Hey John, What’s Your Name Again? and HTML Rulez D00d, made the Rock Band video game series. Joey Sturgis produced this album as well.

Key Tracks: HTML Rulez D00d; Hey John, What’s Your Name Again?; The Scorpion Deathlock

**With Roots Above and Branches Below, 2009, Ferret**

If Plagues launched TDWP into popularity, WRAABB turned them into superstars in this genre. Daniel Williams and Andy Trick really stepped up their games for this album. The chords were heavier, the vocals were heavier, the album was a monster. I remember sitting in my first hour class in 9th grade listening to the album the day it came out for the first time; to this day, the album feels fresh and exciting. WRAABB is definitely my favorite album. Danger: Wildman features a then-16 year old Trevor Wentworth (Our Last Night) trading screams with Hranica. Assistant to the Regional Manager raises the hair on your neck with its guitars. Louder Than Thunder helped the band reach yet another new audience. Lord Xenu is an absolute monster to finish the album. I’m really out of words to describe how much I love this album. If you haven’t sat down and listened to this album yet, all I can say is that you’ve been missing out. WRAABB hit #11 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Top Independent, Top Hard Rock, and Top Christian charts. Joey Sturgis produced yet another TDWP album.

Key Tracks: Assistant to the Regional Manager; Danger:Wildman; Lord Xenu

**Zombie EP, 2010, Ferret**

Zombie EP is hands down the heaviest music that TDWP has written. Hranica’s vocal technique changed a little for this EP, becoming more powerful but a bit higher in pitch. The first song, Escape, brings three massive breakdowns in under five minutes. The second song must be more chill, right? NO! The sound of a chainsaw lets everyone know that Anatomy was here to rip your eardrums out. Outnumbered, not to be outdone, begins with an ominous PSA that quickly turns into a fast paced three minutes of desperation and epicness. Revive begins with a nasty guitar riff that drops into some heavy chords and vocals. This song also has one of my favorite choruses by DePoyster (“we cannot restore/we cannot recover/all is lost in the flood of the risen dead”). Survivor finishes with Hranica telling about the few remaining survivors of the zombie apocalypse. This EP was recorded in under a month and was produced by Joey Sturgis. Zombie hit #10 on the Billboard 200. Nothing gets you in the mood for slaying zombies (or really anything, for the matter) like these 23 minutes of sheer brutality.

Key tracks: Escape; Outnumbered

**Dead Throne, 2011, Ferret, Roadrunner**

Thought by most as a letdown after the Zombie EP’s greatness, Dead Throne actually showed further maturity by the band. The songwriting improved, and all-in-all the musicianship became more fine tuned and layered. The songs don’t quite match Zombie’s intensity through and through, but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have its moments. Hranica’s viciousness in Vengeance and Born to Lose turns any live show into a pitting frenzy. Tim Lambesis (AILD) also lent his anger to the end of Constance. TDWP also channeled their inner Underoath with Kansas and Chicago. Adam Dutkiewicz (Killswitch Engage) produced this album, breaking Sturgis’ stranglehold on the band. Dead Throne reached #10 on the Billboard 200, #1 on the Christian and Independent charts, as well as #40 on the 2011 year-end Hard Rock Albums chart. If I had to describe this album, it would call Dead Throne a mixture of the quick and heavy pacing of Zombie and the melodic elements of WRAABB. 

Key tracks: RIT; Mammoth; Chicago; Born to Lose

**Dead &amp; Alive, 2012, Ferret, Roadrunner**

This is a CD/DVD combo that features 16 live recordings from the band from a March 8, 2012 Worcester, Massachusetts show. I just picked up a copy recently, but the quality is great and it is the last time James Baney is featured on any TDWP record. Definitely worth a look IMHO.

Key tracks: Kansas; Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over; Mammoth

**New Album**

TDWP’s fifth album is set to be released sometime this fall through Roadrunner Records. Matt Goldman is set to be the producer, and Adam Dutkiewicz will be the executive producer. The band has been playing a new song, Gloom, while on their most recent tour with As I Lay Dying. Hranica has said that the album will be darker than Dead Throne, both musically and lyrically.

Shreddit had the same thing full of popular metal bands that used to spam the subreddit and I thought it was a good idea and I was wondering what everyone else thought about one here.  

No one seems to care to search if songs have been posted or not, for instance I think I've seen Follow the Signs by BOO posted here like 10 times.  I like the song and the band but seriously, we get it.  I love August Burns Red and The Devil Wears Prada and they are probably two of my favorite metalcore bands, but I don't come here to circlejerk about how great they are I want to find new music.

However this just goes for past songs or their really popular stuff, but if ABR announces a new album or releases a new song then yeah that should be shared.


So what do you guys think?  I figure if this gets enough interest I could message a mod just in case they don't see this thread and ask them what they think about doing something like this."	t5_2rfut	True

It'd probably be best to get some people posting videos of their talent and stuff! We could vote on it! I think it'd be fun to do something like this every few months, kind of bring the community together a bit.


**EDIT** People willing to participate should have a means to record their music, of course, in a semi-clean fashion. AKA No sound recording from the laptop.

Bayonetworks	49	5	107	"I like finding new bands as much as the next guy, but random youtube links are hard to sort through. Plus, I love talking about bands that *I* think are good, and I'm sure you guys do to.

So lets get this started:

**1. Name your favorite band.** Or favorite band at the moment, whatever you like. Tell us what artists, if any, they are similar to, so people can get a feel for the style of their music. I know comparing bands is frowned upon sometimes, but let's face it, metalcore can be very diverse, and this helps new listeners identify a sound they like.

**2. Tell us what makes this band awesome.** Every band has a thing, whether it's a certain way they do breakdowns, an awesome vocalist, or a unique composition style. Brag about why you think this band is one of the best.

**3. Post a youtube link to their best work, and dissect it.** ""Listen to these guitar lines"", ""The atmosphere they create in this song builds up awesomely"", ""Dude listen to the breakdown at 1:37"", etc. Talk about why this song is awesome in your book or gives you the chills every time you listen to it.

**Affiance** - Fuck man, these guys are so good it's crazy. They got their shit together! Spot on, especially vocally, with every song! It's to bad that so many people weren't there to check em out, really missing out when people don't get to a show to see the openers. The singer was taking pictures with people afterwards and just walking around talking with people for the rest of the night. Some of the other members were hanging out around the merch area as well. I honestly felt like I was the only one belting out the lyrics to these guys, which was kind of unfortunate. Waiting for everyone to yell ""GET UP OFF THE GROUND!"" except no one knew it was coming, kinda sucked, oh well, fuck em. My voice was pretty much blown after them haha.

*Setlist*

Kings of Deceit

Piece of Mind

You Will Be Replaced

We The Machines

Call of the Warrior

Pretty sure that was all of them, short set with the intros to the songs and the talking in between. What a shame.. would have loved another half hour of these guys.


**The Word Alive** - For me personally, I was looking forward to seeing these guys, but really just wanted to hear Casanova Rodeo (which they didnt play) but anyway. Really fucking cool guys. Great stage presence. A lot of the younger kids really seemed to dig these guys. Lots of crowd participation. The coolest thing was that, since As I Lay Dying couldn't make it out on this tour, they decided to do a cover of one of their songs. They picked **94 Hours**. Holy. Fuck. Me and this guy next to me looked at each other and were like ""FUUUUCK YEAH!"". It was crazy. Nice circle pit going for that song.

*Setlist - incomplete*

2012

Epiphany (i think.. don't hold me to it)

94 Hours

Evolutions

Life Cycles

One or two others maybe.. they had about a 30-40 minute set.

**Darkest Hour** - Fuck yeah! Seeing these guys was fuckin crazy! I overheard some kids saying ""I've never listened to these guys"" and whatever, damn, I bet they bought an album after seeing them. They ripped shit apart. You could really tell the maturity of the band and they brought a certain Metal element to the show which was badass instead of the newer wave stuff. Only one thing pissed me off and some other guys I was talking with while getting beer after their set: THEY DIDN'T PLAY DEMON(S). I thought that was a standard at their shows! 

*Setlist - incomplete*

Doomsayer (SO SIIIIIICK)

Love As A Weapon

Violent by Nature

Savior the Kill

The Sadist Nation

Again, about a 40 minute set. Can't remember the other songs, to busy raging.

**Miss May I** I never listened to these guys much before going to this show. But goddamn, tons of energy. Holy shit. I stood back with a beer for these guys since I didn't know lyrics to sing along with and when tracks drop and whatever. They opened with **Hey Mister** which is like one of the only songs I knew, and they crushed it. 

*Setlist - incomplete*

Hey Mister

Relentless Chaos

Forgive and Forget

Opening Wounds

Bleeding Out (i think)

Sorry, not really sure on the other songs they played. Job well done though. Some haters were there for this band, but again, the younger crowd really got into them. I'll DEFINITELY listen to them more often, holy shit, they did a great job. Fuck yeah.

**KILLSWITCH ENGAGE** - Here we go. Clearly everyone was here to see these guys absolutely annihilate the place. I got right up to the front, there was only one person in front of me up against the gate and it was a chick. Felt really bad for her, because she was getting crushed up against that thing. That's actually one of the things I first noticed, there were a TON of chicks on the floor. This was my 4th time seeing Killswitch and its always funny to see how many more fans they have and how diverse the crowd gets. The first time I saw them open up for In Flames and Dark Tranquility you wouldn't have seen a chick there, now adays it's like 30% chicks. Well anyway, anyone who's ever been to a show, especially a Killswitch show, knows that before hand is a calm before the storm. I felt bad for the girls because it was a straight fucking bumrush as soon as KSE came on, almost all of the girls left after the first 2 songs, they were just getting beat up as fuck. Anyway, usual antics from Killswitch, spot on playing, crazy crowd interaction. Jesse is just a fucking machine man. He nails it every single fucking time. It was awesome seeing the crowd know every word too. Fists in the air all over the place, damn am I bruised as fuck though! 

*Setlist*

This Hell In Me

The New Awakening

Beyond the Flames

In Due Time

All We Have (fuck yeah, wanted to see this one)

No End In Sight

Numbered Days

Self-Revolution

Fixation on the Darkness

My Last Serenade

Life to Lifeless

The Arms of Sorrow

This is Absolution

Take this Oath

A Bid Farewell (i think? for some reason i can't 100% remember this one)

Rose of Sharyn

The End of Heartache

My Curse

Only one thing really kinda disappointed me about this show, I think it was the first time I haven't heard **Vide Infra**. I was really hoping they'd at least keep ONE track from the original Self-Titled album, but nope, not one song. No Temple, no In The Unblind, no Vide. Eh, just kinda sucked being a fan of the band since the beginning, was really hoping for one.

**Conclusion** - Get out and see this fucking tour you guys. It's an incredible line up and you'll meet some cool ass people. Beers for $5.50 for a pint. Can't complain. You'll be deaf as fuck, beat up as fuck, and won't be able to talk normal for a couple days and it will be the best $35 bucks you ever spent. Epic time.

Let's have a discussion on the importance of the history, definition, and varieties of metalcore.	lotkrotan	49	8	38	"In middleschool I started branching off from mainstream music and found underground music. I've been listening to, analyzing, and participating the punk/metal/hardcore/whatever bands for over a decade now, and feel like I have a good understanding of the progression of trends and styles in music. I have ambitions to create a historic record of some sort (documentary, essay, etc) to document what I consider an important part of my life, so I welcome your input, corrections, differences in opinion, etc.

To me the [metalcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore) genre itself is as broad of a term as Punk or Rock. My understanding of the criteria of a metalcore band is that it mixes the aggression and rhythm of punk with compositions associated with metal. It also may or may not incorporate riffs designed for crowd reactions ([breakdowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL5azV8bE64), [2-step riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug29j_auwqI), [sing-alongs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48SHwVZJh6c), [mosh calls](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mosh+callout), etc). If you trace back the roots of punk and metal, the first merging of the styles was considered ""[hardcore punk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk)"" or ""[thrash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal)"" or ""[crossover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_thrash)."" Hardcore was a lot of punk with a little metal influence, thrash and crossover being more metal than punk.

Then comes the early 90s with bands like [Earth Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Crisis), [Converge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converge_%28band%29), and [Zao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zao_%28American_band%29) adding more metal textures and variety to their songs. I'll take a moment now to mention that Zao's vocals from ""[Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest and Peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Blood_and_Fire_Bring_Rest)"" onwards were extremely influential to the genre. The gnarled, hissed, [Carcass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_%28band%29)-inspired high vocals can still be heard in most metalcore bands today and have inspired legions of deathcore, prog, and other forms of metal bands.

To me, the focus of hardcore, thrash, and crossover were narrow in their scope and didn't allow for much variation from the accepted standards of the genre. Metalcore opened up new ways to incorporate punk beats, speed picking, solos, and harmonies for a fresh sound.

Some bands like [Ringworm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworm_%28band%29) or [Strife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strife_%28band%29) are considered metalcore even though compared to today's offerings they seem more Thrash or Hardcore oriented. Back in the early days of metalcore they stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the strictly hardcore or thrash offerings of their contemporaries.

This early era of metalcore can see it's influence in later staples in the genre such as [As I Lay Dying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying_%28band%29), [Killswitch Engage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killswitch_Engage), [Avenged Sevenfold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenged_Sevenfold). While I don't really enjoy a lot of the newer interpretations of the classic metalcore sound, there was another shift in the genre in the late 90s.

When bands like [Coalesce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalesce_%28band%29), [Training for Utopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_for_Utopia) and [Botch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botch_%28band%29) came onto the scene, no one knew what to think. While some metalcore bands were starting to get more into what I consider ""tough guy"" or ""moshcore"" hardcore (more focus on 2-step and breakdown riffs), these newer bands were taking the accepted sonic qualities of metalcore and incorporating noise, ambient, and even jazz to produce more complexly timed riffs, chaotic dissonance, and intricate progressions. The term “[mathcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcore)” was born and I'd like to think these early underground offerings paved the way for more successful “[math rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock)” bands to come later.

This is probably my favorite style of metalcore and quite possibly laid the ground work for the influx of [progressive metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal)/metalcore in the 2000s. Some of the more successful bands along the lines of this shift in trends include [Daughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_%28band%29), [Norma Jean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Jean_%28band%29). [The Chariot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chariot_%28band%29), [The Dillinger Escape Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chariot_%28band%29), [Every Time I Die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Time_I_Die), [Curl Up and Die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_Up_and_Die), and [Breather Resist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breather_Resist).

While some bands in the genre were pushing the limits of what a metalcore band is, others continued past traditions while blurring the distinction between Hardcore, Punk, and Metal. Bands like [Full Blown Chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Blown_Chaos), [Sworn Enemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sworn_Enemy), and [Black My Heart](http://us.myspace.com/blackmyheart) kept churning out songs with crushing breakdowns and hardcore/thrash influenced riffs.

Also appearing on the scene at this time was an influx of more melodic metalcore, or metalcore lite if you will. Bands were toning down the aggression and visceral brutality in favor of clean melodies, singing, and undistorted guitars. The genre of [Post-Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hardcore) was going strong and metalcore bands started to incorporate it into their sound. [Poison the Well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_the_Well_%28band%29) is probably the closest thing to a forerunner for this variation in metalcore with bands such as [From Autumn to Ashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Autumn_to_Ashes) and [Chiodos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiodos) continuing the trend.

Another example of the branching out of metalcore is the [southern rock style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWAgwPKsUiw) incorporated namely by Every Time I Die and imitated by bands as far ranging as [Maylene and the Sons of Disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maylene_and_the_Sons_of_Disaster) to modern namesakes like [Vanna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanna_%28band%29). While not a huge shift in style, it's still worth mentioning seeing as a fair amount of modern metal and hardcore still use this gimmick.

While there definitely are still bands making metalcore today, I think the genre as a whole has run it's course and morphed into new genres. From the mid to end of the 2000s, you see a huge rise in popularity of bands that brought more [grindcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore)/[death metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal)/[tech death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_death_metal) influence into the genre. [The Red Chord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Chord), [Despised Icon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Chord), [Ed Gein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein_%28band%29), [Killwhitneydead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killwhitneydead), etc. Nowadays people consider those bands [Deathcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathcore), but at the time the label didn't exist.

While some metalcore bands were becoming more and more like deathcore, some were reaching more towards the post-hardcore side of things. If you think of bands like Vanna, [Trivium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathcore) [Coheed and Cambria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathcore), or Avenged Sevenfold, you conjure thoughts of clean hooks mixed with heavy breakdowns. This style of metalcore most likely influenced modern heavyweights like [Protest the Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_the_Hero) and [Periphery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periphery_%28band%29).

Nowadays progressive metal bands are as common as ever, and you can thank metalcore for that. Bands like [Between the Buried and Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_the_Buried_and_Me) completely changed the genre by adding a level of virtuosity never before seen. The simplistic punk riffs of the past were long gone, replaced by unpredictable progressions and rich textures and themes. By the end of the 2000s, progressive metal became a genre of it's own rather than a handful of bands inside the realms of metal and metalcore. I do want to add that metalcore alone didn't pave the way for progressive metal and credit is due to bands like [Neurosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis_%28band%29), [Mastodon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28band%29), and [Cynic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28band%29) for being way ahead of their time.

Fast forward to today and metalcore is certainly a dying genre, but it's influence is felt in almost every popular genre of metal. Dare I say there would be no Progressive Metal, [Djent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent), or Deathcore without the foundation metalcore created? How would the recent influx of [melodic hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_hardcore) bands like [Defeater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeater_%28band%29) or brutal pop-punk bands like [Four Year Strong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Year_Strong) or [A Day To Remember](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_To_Remember) have come to be without the example set by the more melody-laden metalcore bands of the past?

I wouldn't say there was a start or end of metalcore. It was birthed by experimentation and pushing boundaries, and eventually evolved or assimilated into modern genres. Metalcore is more of a description of the metamorphoses of underground music during a certain time period than a defined genre. This shift in music is mainly attributed to American bands, but there are some great offerings from around the world that I'd like to touch on at a later date. I'd also like to put emphasis on some of the seminal record labels that helped promote and distribute metalcore across the world. The early days of [Victory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Records), [Trustkill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Records), [Ferret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret_Records), and [Deathwish Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathwish_Inc.) produced some of the best albums in the genre.

Like I said at the beginning, your input is much appreciated in order to help me create a more complete understanding of what metalcore is/was. Thanks for taking the time to read all this, and more importantly I hope you support some of the bands mentioned above for their years of dedication to making music.

**TL;DR** Metalcore started as a blending of punk and metal, but due to the flexibility allowed by the genre, it began to incorporate a variety of influences to produce a spectrum of bands vastly different from each other and whose influence can be traced to popular bands of today. 

**TL;DR2** Metalcore is more important to music than most people realize


**edit** I think I should make a mention of how youth-driven the culture is, and how it leaves room for multiple opinions and perspectives. From militant vegan [straight edge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge) to bong ripping riff masters, there's a metalcore band for a wide variety of social, political, and religious points of view. 

It'd also be worth mentioning that the thrill and energy of live metalcore bands is one of the most positive experiences I've ever had with large groups of people. There's a sense of danger and adrenaline in the pit while at the same time an unspoken code of ethics to pick up fallen moshers or crowd surfers so they don't get stomped. There's unity and community present in every gang vocal or sing along, and a feeling that the whole room is alive with the energy the band is conveying. The band may be on a stage, but they're not the source of this energy, merely channeling it instead. The crowd has the power to bring the energy to huge levels, and it's an almost supernatural experience.

**edit 2** Thanks for all the input so far guys! I added some context links so people can look up references to bands/terms they aren't familiar with."	t5_2rfut	True

Bands and songs connected to life experiences, band members I idolize and connect with,  a fire and rush I get from the screams and cleans pulsing through my veins. It seems as if the artists of metal/metalcore all have a purpose and create music with a meaning. I'm not sure if any of you feel the same, and I'm not trying to be an elitist, but sometimes I feel like other genres are empty, hollow songs, meaningless lyrics and false idols. 

I grew up listening to Metallica and rush with my dad, and my musical tastes evolved (as did his because he is quite the August Burns Red fan) and I started listening closer, with the drums pumping my blood and the guitars stimulating my senses and the vocals speaking to me. I don't understand why we're a minority. 

How do you on r/metalcore explain the genre to people caught in the stream of pop/rap and other generic musical tastes?

Edit: felt the need to edit because I wrote this after being questioned and ripped on by friends who listen strictly to pop/rap so it came off quite biased and douchy sounding. So apologies to any offended, I do enjoy other genres I was just feeling pretty biased towards metalcore at the time. A post mentioned that every genre has their creep of the crop and their garbage, this I'd true and I should have taken it into consideration before hand. "	t5_2rfut	True

Sammy_the_Wise	47	12	142	I am just looking to have a discussion here, not get in an argument about religion. Myself, being both a Christian and an avid Metal listener, was at first somewhat skeptical as to what I would listen to. But, as I grew as a person, I became much more tolerant to other people's beliefs and, obviously, the way I approached music. A few years ago if you told me I would be going to a Slayer concert in a few summers, I would have laughed at you. (I am aware Tom Araya is Catholic) I have started to get into a lot of heavier stuff, including bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Slipknot, As I Lay Dying, Children of Bodom, All That Remains, etc. which used to scare me as a young kid. I have since realized the error of my ways, but still stay away from things like black and death metal, but mostly because I just don't like the music. If anyone else has any opinions on this, like if you have ever stopped listening to a band, regardless of what your religious perspective is, because of that bands views, I would like to hear from you.	t5_2rfut	True

Thrill Seeker, Messengers, and Constellations are 3 of my top 5 most listened to albums. Leveler was disappointing in some aspects, but still had some great songs (see Internal Cannon, Salt &amp; Light). I loved the direction they were trying to take, but they couldn't execute it quite right. Rescue &amp; Restore is a wonderful culmination of the awesome band they used to be, and the more awesome band they are now.

My favorite songs right now are Treatment, Creative Captivity, and Beauty in Tragedy.
