1363609788.0	1air46	Hi Reddit! I have some more HTC's to give you, including a brand new HTC One!	shenye	9111	6022	1061	"After the last [giveaway of an HTC One X+ and a One S](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/15dea8/hi_reddit_htc_have_given_me_a_few_more_phones_to/) which had over 30,000 entries over 2 days, I've managed to get hold of a silver HTC One to give away to you guys! 

There is a catch, however, there is no available stock at the HTC offices **yet** so the winner will have to wait until *mid-April-ish* when stock does arrive and it will be shipped to them directly from HTC (to anywhere in the world, free of charge). You will get to choose which variant you want, whether it be US LTE, Global GSM or EU LTE (all LTE variants come with GSM).

I also have a *white* **HTC One X+** (limited edition colour) which I will add to the prize pool. I will have to charge shipping for this as it's already in my possession (I'm a student, can't afford to spent £20 to ship phones to another country on recorded delivery). If this thread doesn't achieve either goals, I will just hand it out to someone in the streets I see with an old smartphone (e.g. HTC Wildfire). Oh, upvotes on this thread don't give me karma.

I also have a handful of Desire X's which I'll be handing out to people in the public I see with an old smartphone. I'll be hanging around the Soho (London) area next week ;). You can also Follow me on [Twitter @shen_ye](http://www.twitter.com/shen_ye) to keep up to date with any **future giveaways**!

I posted this on XDA as well so refer to this thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=44055783#post44055783

This phone is not truly waterproof/resistant!!!!!

First off I want to start this off buy saying a few things. I work for AT&amp;T so before anyone says its from improper usage remember I had to watch training videos on how to properly use it. Also, before anyone says well, you aren't really supposed to be using it in the water, you are wrong. The first thing we are trained on is how to properly close the back cover and how to show the customers Aqua mode to take pictures underwater. We actively use this as a main selling point, this is per Samsung.

Here is my story. I bought the Active on Thursday. The first thing I did with it was ensure the back was closed and made a video in my fish tank so I could show customers how it works underwater, and how good aqua mode is. That worked out perfectly except the video was a little dark, so I figured I would retake it.

In this time I had a customer swap out the phone they bought because it were defective, the bottom buttons stopped working on it. She was very vague when the water question came up but I thought nothing of it.

Now cue today. It was sunny outside so I thought it was the perfect time to reshoot the fish tank video. I ensured the back was secure, yes, including pressing down on the back where the AT&amp;T logo is. I then submerged the phone in the tank while taking the video. Almost instantly the phone screen went black and said dock mode was enabled so I took the phone out of the water and everything went back to normal. I double checked the USB rubber to be sure. I just chalked it up to the phone doing crazy things in the water. I have read almost everywhere that the phone will say headphones are plugged in, etc. So I thought this was normal. I then put it back in and took a minute long video. Everything was fine. I even played back the video and it was fully working.

This is where everything went wrong. About 2 minutes later the phone started tweaking out, Google now opened on its own and the buttons were really sensitive. Then the buttons completely stopped working other than the power button and that's when I freaked out. I opened the battery cover and there it was, everything was soaked. but luckily none of the water damage indicators were colored. I then opened the USB door and it was like a fountain, so that's where the breach happened. The flimsy, rubber USB door. I did not tell a soul what happened and went back to work and swapped it for a regular Galaxy S4.

So please listen to my warning. There are way too many people getting this phone damaged, including me, a fully trained AT&amp;T employee who took the proper precautions before doing anything.

Samsung should not be able to get away with calling this phone water resistant or water proof, and they should especially not include an Aqua Camera mode.

Also the warranty DOES NOT, I REPEAT, DOES NOT COVER WATER!!!!

I want Samsung to see this, we seriously can't have them get away with the advertising on this phone, there are way too many cases of this phone getting damaged with correct usage!"	t5_2qlqh	True

Some of you may know me from previous post I've made concerning my first free Android app - [**Saving Made Simple**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ootpapps.saving.made.simple). 

From posting on Reddit, I've found many of you have a desire to create your first app by learning Java/Android. I know how overwhelming it can feel to get started, especially as someone who's not a programmer. This being said, I put together a [**public Google Doc with every single resource I used to create my first Android app**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aiakq5EFgZZTdGlmblFNMFZLN3huRnNUNzdkWDRoekE&amp;output=html) and publish it!

Last night at about 3:15am EST (about 1 hour after i plugged it in and went to sleep) I was awoken by a loud noise and a weird squeaking sound. (I charge my phone while I'm sleeping on my bed right next to me)


So, I woke up, and saw a ton of smoke coming out of my phone -- it also smelled REALLY bad. Half asleep, I jumped out of bed and turned the light on, only to see that my phone was just beginning to go on fire. I dumped a glass of water I had in the room on it to stop it from burning...then woke up my brother to come help.
The smoke smelled so bad and wafted through the entire second floor of my house. I had a foam mattress pillow top that had a hole burned through it too--which we later threw out because it was still burning throughout. Also, some of the plastic on my phone was melting and kind of shooting out of it, and some landed on my pinky finger and burned some skin off (very small burn though).


Does anyone have any suggestions what I should do? Call Verizon? Samsung? Have a lawyer call them? I'd also like to get some type of replacement phone in the meantime...

I've been in contact with a Samsung representative since the event happened. As requested, I mailed in the exploded phone/battery so they can investigate the situation. In the meantime, they sent me a 'loaner' SGS3 until the situation is resolved.


That's really all there is for now. The person I am in contact with said it will take 7-10 days for their engineers to 'examine' the device. I am cautious, yet hopeful, that they will do the right thing. I will post more updates as they come. Thanks!


**UPDATE:** Samsung has contacted me to inform me of the preliminary investigation of the phone/battery. I was told that the battery in question was not a Samsung battery. However, I had never purchased or used a separate battery. The one in the phone had said ""SAMSUNG"" on it and appeared to me to be OEM. They are going to further investigate how/why this is the case. To be honest with you, I thought they were going to come back and tell me it was my fault for charging the battery overnight and on my bed.  I am very confused at the moment...


Despite being very angry and befuddled, I could not speak more of the level of respect, kindness, professionalism, and transparency in the company's communications to me since the event took place. Moreover, Samsung is still going to appropriately take care of me because, as I was told, ""they care about their customers and still would like to offer me an act of kindness."" 


That being said, I am really unsure where to go from here. If I had used a 3rd party battery, I would have contacted the 3rd party, and not Samsung....Considering I never purchased/used a 3rd party battery, I just don't know what to do....Perhaps, just be grateful Samsung is taking care of me, forget about this, and move on--happily that I wasn't REALLY injured, as in the link /u/ixrs posted..."	t5_2qlqh	True

The mods have changed this over the last few months by holding onto the belief that we should use other lifeless subreddits to have Android discussions and then letting 4 of the same news item through, sometimes from the same source and even though /r/androidnews exists.

The result is that /r/android has become a human controlled RSS feed for a handful of favoured sites. What is the point of that when we could just use Feedly? I come here so I can discuss Android issues, sometimes news related and sometimes not news related.

My suggestion: Let more posts through. The best ones will rise to the front page and the others will dwindle. Why mess with reddits formula by introducing an unpredictable human moderation element?

I'm not sure how to go about appealing this. After all it's true that reddit content includes NSFW content. Not sure exactly why my app was singled out and the other reddit apps weren't, though.

Any thoughts? Should I even bother appealing? As always I appreciate your input, /r/android. Thanks.


**EDIT:** I posted on Google Plus: https://plus.google.com/108576990588738594191/posts/8LfJmKX48R2 maybe it would help to gain awareness through that avenue? Thanks for all your support, guys.

**EDIT2:** Dave Nicponski, a Google employee, commented on that Google Plus thread, saying the right people at Google are going to contact me about what actually triggered the issue:

&gt;+Andrew Shu So i've spoken with the appropriate people here @ google. There seems to be some (very large) confusion about what actually happened. Expect to hear back shortly.

&gt;To the masses decrying ""censorship! Oh noes!"" That's not what happened here at all. Hopefully Andrew will be able to confirm this shortly. It really is a very tiny thing that seems to have caused this. Just be patient.

Still awaiting their response...

**EDIT3:** I thought it was funny that the situation is somehow getting coverage in China: http://it.sohu.com/20120320/n338298872.shtml

**EDIT4:** The Google Play appeals team have responded to my appeal. They asked me for more clarification on a few points all surrounding the inclusion of NSFW reddits in the default list. So that, as many of you already guessed, is what concerns them about the app. I replied already and will update when I hear back a second time.

**EDIT5:** Thank you everyone for your support! Google is giving me a chance to reinstate the app, provided I fix the Content Policy issues. The primary issue is the linking to sexually explicit reddits and potentially other policy-violating reddits like any condoning hate speech, gratuitous violence, etc."	t5_2qlqh	True

So [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/z306y/someone_awesome_gave_me_an_htc_sensation_on_the/) happened a few months and and HTC decided to hand me a few devices to give away, a few of which I decided to [give away to Redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/zuj68/hi_randroid_htc_have_given_me_a_few_phones_to/).

So [here](http://i.imgur.com/pyGHD.jpg) is what they sent me: (specs posted at the bottom of the thread)

* 2x HTC One X+ International - Black
* 4x HTC One S International - Black [Micro Arc Oxidation finish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPZ7y1EDKvk)

So here's what I'll do, I'll give out a One X+ and a One S to 2 random Redditors. Last time I did this, I counted each comment as an entry, but my python script ended up spending 10 minutes digging through all the comments to fetch the usernames; so this time I'll be using a Google Docs form and use a random number generator to select the rows before verifying the entry. The rest of the devices I will be randomly handing out in public to anyone I see with an old HTC.

Here are the rules: **Sorry, the contest has closed now. Follow me on [Twitter @shen_ye](http://www.twitter.com/shen_ye) to get info on future giveaways!**

I have a Galaxy S2 running CM10 and the iPad (3rd gen) running iOS 6 since yesterday.  Android phones are just better for me, so I have an android phone.  The iPad is an unrivaled tablet, so I have an iPad (though i'm looking into getting a Nexus tablet because it works better with Google services that i use constantly).

I compared iOS 6 maps with Google Maps on my phone last night and the difference is night and day.  There is no nicer way to say it other than to say.....it's horrible.  A huge step back.  I use Google Maps everyday and all the feature I use constantly is no where to be found in iOS 6 maps.

I keep hearing people say that Google is going to bring a Maps app to iOS, but those are all wishful thinking.  They have never said anything like that.   I've been seeing lots of ads for Google Maps http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrS9AVPUMFQ&amp;feature=plcp with no sign of a iOS app.  They said they would release a YouTube app which they did, but never said anything about a maps app.

I look at it both ways, there are 2 ways of doing this.  Release an app because it makes good business sense, or don't release one, which forces people over to Android.

1365252335.0	1bskqz	I've just released an open source client for Reddit, with a Holo UI and some other awesome features. Details and screenshots inside.	QuantumBadger	4531	1963	749	"I've just released [RedReader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.quantumbadger.redreader) (my first Android app) - a client for reddit. It's completely free and [open source](https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader), it has a Holo UI, and it has some unique features (like swipe actions, and storing past versions of things).


**Some screenshots:**

* [Swiping posts](http://i.imgur.com/HgobuWM.png)
* [Tablet mode](http://i.imgur.com/z7WHxeQh.png)


**Features**

* Free and Open Source - no ads/tracking.
* Swipe posts left and right to perform customisable actions, such as upvote/downvote, or save/hide.
* Support for multiple accounts.
* Advanced cache management - automatically stores past versions of posts and comments (customizable).
* Streaming - shows posts/comments as they download - good for slow connections.
* Two-column tablet mode (can be used on your phone, if it's big enough).
* Image precaching (optional: always, never, or Wi-Fi only) with ultra high-res thumbnails.
* Built in image viewer and GIF player (works for direct image links, and imgur/quickmeme/livememe links).
* Compression - both during downloads, and in cache storage.
* Night mode (i.e. a dark theme).
* Holo theme on every device.
* Support for Android 2.2+ (but works best on Android 4.0+).


**Beta**

This is still in beta, so there may be a few bugs (and missing features). If the UI thread crashes, it'll write a crash log to the external storage, and if a network thread crashes it'll pop up a message asking you to email a report. Please do - the reports don't contain any data other than the exception which was thrown (and you can view it before sending).


**Source**

If you want to add a feature/fix a bug/learn how to do something in Android, the code is available on GitHub:

https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader

It's built using Maven - personally I couldn't get it working in Eclipse, so I've been using IntelliJ IDEA, which handles pretty much everything automatically. It even has an option to checkout directly from GitHub.


**Download from Google Play**

I've also uploaded it to Google Play:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.quantumbadger.redreader

It's free, there are no ads/tracking/etc, and the only servers it talks to are reddit, imgur, quickmeme, and any websites you visit.

Let me know what you think, and feel free to suggest features/etc (or add them yourself!)


**EDIT**

Thanks for the amazing response! I'm doing my best to read all the comments/suggestions, and I've put up a new version (1.3.1) on Google play with a few additions - it takes about an hour for Google to accept new versions after uploading though. Working on the next one now.

**EDIT 2**

If there are any developers here who'd like to work on a feature/bug but don't know where to start, let me know and I'll point you towards the right bits of the code.

**EDIT 3**

Version 1.3.4 should show up on the Play Store in a few hours - it adds a few new features and fixes a few bugs, including the single line reply problem everyone's reporting :) Thanks again for all your support!

**EDIT 4**

The awesome people from F-Droid have been in touch, hopefully it should be on there within the next few days.

**EDIT 5**

I'm off now, thanks to everyone for your comments (I've read almost all of them). I'll try and get some features and bugfixes done tomorrow, and I'll post updates to /r/RedReader."	t5_2qlqh	True

Really annoyed that, as far as i can tell, there are no cars with android support.

The cars that I've seen that allow you to bluetooth music, don't allow control of the device and don't interface perfectly.

If this is an android issue, than it needs to be fixed as well.


**Edit:** ftr. we've had a Cadillac that we traded for an Acura that were both post 2010, my dad has a BMW and i rent cars very frequently. All of the cars that we've owned have had iphone connection that pops the songs/albums/artists/playlists on the screen and allows steering wheel control.


the Cadillac and Acura would play music/apps sound through the speakers with no control and no visual pop up. and the Acura's bluetooth is very delayed reaction.


Any cars that i rent that have ipod support literally never have android support. Even the fords that have a sync icon but no navigation screen.


To answer the ""there's too many phones to support"" argument. I don't know much about programming android, but i don't think it'd be impossible/improbable to for google to create a standard that can be utilized to for all cars (and preferably other peripherals.)

ftr. this stems from the fact that I finally got my wife to get an android (sg3 if it matters)  and now she's annoyed, and rightfully, that she's going to loose the simple usability that she had previously."	t5_2qlqh	True

Android developers are adding 'add to' in front of the app names in the Android sharing menu, so that their house will float to the top. This creates a poorly organized share menu, which normally would be sorted alphabetically by app title.

1364700785.0	1bc9tx	Thank you, r/android	thndrchld	3918	1650	455	"A few months ago, I was perusing /r/Android, trying to find a use for my old Galaxy S phone that I had retired.  Browsing through threads, I came across the idea of using it as a dash camera for my car.  

I thought about it, then decided that this was what I wanted to do.  I picked up a windshield mount for the phone, and went to setting up the apps.

Today, about an hour ago, I was hit by a hit-and-run driver while heading home from playing tennis with some friends.  He sideswiped me, then booked it up the road before anybody could get any information off his car.

After cursing profusely and pulling over, I contacted the police department to file the report.  The police came, and told me that somebody else had called in and reported that I had hit them and sped off.

I produced the video for the officer, who watched, complimenting me on my forethought.  He radioed back and told the other officer to hold the other driver.  ""Stay in the car,"" he said, ""we're going to McDonald's.  That guy's about to feel like a real moron."" 

Thank you /r/Android, you've saved me a $500 insurance deductible, and allowed me to stick it to a complete asshole who tried to make me out to be the bad guy.

As soon as I finish getting everything situated, I'll upload the video to YouTube, so you can all watch and laugh at him with me.

1357626104.0	1665en	My app is getting 1-star ratings from another dev	elBradford	4354	2207	521	"I purchased an app, Justin.tv Viewer, in September. It was $2 at the time. It was a simple Justin.tv player for Android, and it worked. But it had a terrible interface and a stark absence of features.  Despite this, he was selling it like mad. I noticed that he had inflated his app's rating with fake ratings.  Most of the 5-star ratings were from 1 of 3 devices, and that raised a red flag. Dozens of 5-star ratings. I left a poor review on his app because of this - maybe that was a bit unfair, because it did technically work. But I only left 1 review. Like a normal person.

I decided to develop an app and compete. I had never developed for Android before and though this would be a fun project to do.

*Fast forward a few months:* I published my app, right before Christmas.  That night (at a family Christmas party no less) I looked up my app to see if anyone had left reviews.  My stomach dropped when I saw 19 1-star reviews.  I had to assume the other dev saw my app and spammed it, using the same method he used to boost his rating. 

It was easy to verify this. I suspected this particular developer, so I looked up the whois on his publisher website. And there his name was, naked and exposed. It matched perfectly with a recent purchase of my app.

*There are 2 big issues at hand here:*

**ISSUE 1: it is incredibly easy for *anyone* to game Google Play ratings**
This is the method used to game Google Play's rating system:

1. Buy app.
2. Rate app.
3. Sign into another Google account.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as you have fake accounts.
5. (Optional) request a refund within 15 minutes. The ratings stay even though a refund was issued.

**ISSUE 2: It is incredibly hard for anyone to get good and timely developer support from Google Play.** 
The available communication options are:

1. Webform

That's it. And then wait for a *possible* response. I would **pay** to talk to a person who could help with this. I wouldn't even mind it. But that's not an option.

***To help bring these two issues to the attention of Google, please see the link at the bottom of this post***

He used this arsenal of Google accounts to eventually give me 20+ 1-star reviews and to mark all the positive reviews as spam to make them disappear. Some of his reviews just said it was bad, some said that it had a virus, etc.

*Fast forward to last night*: I recently re-released my app under a new name. My old app was suspended because its name was too close to another entity (probably Justin.tv), so I redesigned it (enter Streamie :) and republished it.  It takes a couple hours for a new app to appear in the play store, *and he spotted my app even before I did*, and started giving them 1-star reviews. I had only sold a single copy, to him (which he was refunded for anyway), and I already had 4 1-star reviews.

**What should I do?** I don't want to play dirty, because I'll get dirty as well. He won't quit, I tried to reason with him in an email. No response.

**Update** Thanks so much everyone for the words of encouragement, good advice, and honest feedback on my app. I appreciate all feedback. I don't even mind 1-star reviews if I deserve it. As requested, I'm posting the link to my app here. Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. I know it's not perfect, and I'm always trying to improve it. So let me know what I can do better either here, in a review on the app, or in an email to me through Google Play.

[Streamie Online TV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.bantamstudio.streamiefree)

I love you all. You turned a terrible night completely around.

**Update 2** Looks like he woke up and saw your response reddit. There are a few posts expressing doubt about whether or not this was a scam just to get my app rated. It wasn't, but I understand the doubt.  It's kind of hard to prove without publishing a bunch of this guy's personal information and I don't feel comfortable doing that. However, at the beginning of this epic, the paid version of Streamie had 4 1-star reviews. [Now it has a whole lot more](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.bantamstudio.streamie), with one weird review from Ben Joe (?) that I'm posting because it's a good example of a fake review with a vendetta: 

&gt;Complete trash. This developer is stealing content. This app has been removed multiple times for infringement. google play has been notified about the matter. Save your money as this app will be removed again.

Further, many of the positive reviews written were marked as spam and buried. ***I'm not posting this to ask you to buy the app, but as perhaps a little more evidence.***   I hope I'm not the only one who can see the insanity in this. Google? Please fix these 2 issues!

**Update 3** The other developer emailed me. This is his email:

&gt;Hello Bradford,
&gt;
&gt;I have read your reddit post. I really do hope you and the people on reddit understand that you attacked me first with multiple 1 star ratings and defamatory comments. I am done with what ever nonsense this has lead to. I ask that you do not release any of my personal information. I am sure it is illegal to do so. I would go to a lawyer if you did. I am not threatening anyone in any way. You may respond if you would like or we can just drop this as is. I have no intentions or desires to publish any more streaming TV applications or to compete with you in any way.

This was my response:

&gt;I'm sorry that this happened the way it did. For the record, I only left your first app a single 1-star review. That was a bit harsh, since it did work, it just wasn't as polished as I thought it should be.
&gt;
&gt;After I released my app and you hammered it with 1-star ratings I did retaliate in like fashion, but not to the same extent.
&gt;
&gt;But we will probably never see eye to eye on this.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the email.

(Regarding the above 'retaliation' - I did use another of my accounts to rate his app again. It wasn't the right thing to do, but it was how I found out how easy it was to game the system) 
Wanting to post an update, I sent another email:

&gt;I'll go ahead an post it. Some for my credibility and to maybe get them off your back if they are bothering you.
&gt;
&gt;Again, I'm sorry that it happened like this. I wish it didn't, I wish we could have coexisted. Good luck in whatever you do.

to which he replied:

&gt;I am sorry this has taken place as well. 
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for keeping personal information out. 
&gt;
&gt;I did mark the two apps as suspicious. I marked them last night and this morning around 10 A.M. (many hours ago). I am sorry if the apps are suspended, I cannot undo marking them as suspicious. You may want to un-publish, at least your free one, and re-publish it under a different package name. That way you may be able to save the suspension. I am trying to help at this point. Too many suspensions will result in a banned account.

I don't know if this could have ended any better. Of course, hopefully Google doesn't ban my account. That would be a nightmare. But at least this issue, for me, is behind me for the time being.

*Please don't go after this guy. If you have posted personally identifiable information, please edit and remove it.*

I think more and more developers are starting to build tablet specific apps or making their apps scale to tablets well, on the back of the Nexus tablets being so successful.

I can confidently say that (compared to maybe 6 months ago) on my Nexus 10, I have **almost** every app that I could possibly want which has a great tablet interface. Granted, I'd love to see more devs taking Android tablets seriously (especially in the games department), but I also feel that the Android tablet market has only just become serious with the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10.

**EDIT**: Some great comments here. I just want everyone to keep in mind that I'm not defending the shortage of tablet apps on Android. There are a great many already available but we're far from being spoilt for choice. My point is that it's funny that on every review, the Verge writers complain about the problem while being part of the very same problem. "	t5_2qlqh	True

We have revised the submission criteria for posts to /r/android as outlined below. We have been removing up to 250 posts a day and to improve the quality of the subreddit please adhere to them. 

It is important to note that /r/android is for Android NEWS &amp; DISCUSSION only.

Okay - here they are:

* **Questions.** 

/r/Android is a forum for Android-related news and discussion. As such, most questions should be posted to /r/AndroidQuestions or a device relevant subreddit. 

*All general support questions or topics looking for help will be removed, including but not limited to the following:*

* ""What phone should I get?""
* ""Why should I get an Android over an iPhone""
* ""How do I root""
* ""What ROM is best""
* ""What tips and tricks for my device are there?""
* ""What app is best to do x""

Have a question about Android? Search here first -/r/MoronicMondayAndroid/

Still didn't find the answer? Try /r/androidquestions

If you are new to Android or do have a question that relates to your device please wait until /u/onesixoneeight 's weekly Moronic Monday Thread and post there.

Thought provoking questions and community discussion is welcome. Simple 'Google-able' questions are not.

* **Content.** 

For more information on pictures, please refer to the rule on pictures below. 

You may post anything Android related with a few exceptions. An easy way to determine if an article is Android related is if the article or video discusses - or at least says ""*Android*"" once. Pictures of a robot, your child dressed as an Android, an ice cream sandwich in the sun, a bag of jelly beans, or anything else similar to that are not Android related. 

Outright Apple bashing and ""Android is best because..."" submissions will also be removed. 

Look for the original source of content, and submit that. Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another, and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually deserves the traffic. Linking to stories via blog posts that add nothing extra will also result in removal. Repeat offenders will be banned.

Also consider pictures of themes to go to /r/androidthemes and gaming content/questions to /r/androidgaming.

* **Post Titles.** 

Do not editorialize titles of posts. You may, however, give an accurate description of the article or quote selections from the article. Intentionally or not, putting misleading, inaccurate, of inflammatory information in a title of post will subject your post to removal.

""Dear Google/Motorola/HTC/Samsung/Sony:"" posts or ""Attention (Insert App Here) Developers:"" submissions will be removed. Make the effort to contact the company directly, not moan about it in /r/Android.

* **Piracy.** 

Do not post any links to anything pirated. This includes, but is not limited to games, apps, movies, music, proprietary ROMs, leaked closed betas, and any material you are not authorized to distribute. Even if an app is free or on the Play Store doesn't mean users can post links to APKs you didn't create. Piracy is taken seriously and will result in your submission being removed and a ban against you.


* **Device/Carrier.** 

Device troubleshooting and carrier specific posts must be posted in the appropriate subreddit. For instance, a post or link about Verizon should be posted in /r/Verizon. Carrier complaints about service or lack of will be removed.

* **Spam.** 

This applies to bloggers, developers, or others engaging in marketing on /r/Android. Have you created an app and wish to promote it? Wait until /u/onesixoneeight's Sunday APPreciation Threads and post in there. Submissions promoting apps that have been submitted from a relatively new account will be removed. If you *do* create a post to promote your app please ensure that you state you are the developer of it in your submission title.

* **Referral Links.** 

Do not post referral links to Amazon or other websites in comments or main posts. A referral link is any link that the linker may derive a profit or commission from if you purchase from that site. You may post links to websites to purchase things so long as you will not directly or indirectly benefit from someone purchasing the item. Developers linking to their own apps must clearly state it is their work. New accounts created for the sole purpose of linking to an app will be removed. Violations to the above may result in a ban.

* **Sales.** 

Selling of phones, hardware, or other merchandise is strictly forbidden. Giveaways, however are acceptable so long as there is no value paid for the actual device. If you wish to sell a device, tablet, or other hardware, please visit [Swappa](http://swappa.com/reddit). Swappa will also reward you with a Reddit Gold for doing so.

* **Pictures and Videos.**
 
All pictures and videos, or the link to pictures and videos, must be posted in a self post otherwise they will be removed. Memes, [FIXED], karma whoring, and reactionary photos/gifs (""What I did when the Nexus 4 was released"") are strictly prohibited even if posted within a self post. The general rule of thumb is this: if you take away all of the text, is the picture still Android related? The appropriateness of a screen shot is on a case by case basis.

* **Flairs.** 

Your flair is only permitted to have your ROM type, device type, and if you want, your wireless carrier. Irrelevant words or comments are not permitted. Developers are allowed to add an app-name, developer-name, team, or company to their flair. Continued violation of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Rude, Offensive, and Hateful Comments.** 

Rude, offensive and hateful comments have no place in /r/Android. Depending on the offensiveness of your comments, you may be warned or banned.

* **Personal Information.** 

Posting any personal information (email, phone numbers, real name, Facebook, physical address, etc.) about another user or any other person will result in you being banned from the subreddit and your post removed. 

* **Witch Hunts and Rants.** 

Do not start any ""witch hunts"" through a 'call to arms' against a private person or company. Reddit is not your private army. Please avoid submitting rants, and instead frame topics in a way that encourages discussion. If there isn't more than one side to a topic, it probably isn't discussion material.

* **Read the Sidebar.**
 
Please read the sidebar before posting. Most questions are answered via the sidebar. Also, if you still have questions, try searching google as well as /r/AndroidQuestions before posting.

1348114739.0	106dao	Developers! STOP making separate 'HD' titles of your apps &amp; charging people twice! A tablet UI is NOT a 'feature'!	Ayman07	3548	1606	554	"I am a big advocate for Android tablet apps. I love them! But something about this really rubbed me the wrong way. Here's one example (but there are many)! The app, [Package Buddy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psyrus.packagebuddy&amp;feature=search_result), is a package tracking application that has a nice phone UI and judging from the screenshots, has a pretty decent tablet UI as well. So like most people (who don't necessarily read the description word for word), I just downloaded the app to give it a try. Lo and behold, the tablet UI is nonexistent on my Transformer Prime.

I emailed the developer a couple of months ago saying that I could not activate the tablet interface. Just yesterday I proceeded to give the developer a 1* feedback for his unprofessionalism and neglect. Of course, miraculously, I received an email from the developer the next day essentially saying, **if you want fragments, you're going to have to pay for that 'feature'.**

Are you kidding me?! Since when is designing your app properly for tablets a feature? I have to pay to have the app look like how it was meant to look? That seems like a money grab by the developer. It's ludicrous. Another example is [Reddit Sync Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync.pro), which, even though the tablet UI is not done yet, plans on charging for the optimized tablet interface. Really dude?

Don't get me wrong, I pay for all my apps because I know how it feels to get my apps pirated and losing out on potential revenue. If an app is worth it, I pay for it. If the free version is good and I don't find the additional features worthwhile (like in the case with Package Buddy), I simply reward them with a good feedback and ad clicks. But to call a tablet interface a 'feature' is absurd.

And another thing, what's with these apps and games (like cut the rope) that have a separate 'HD' version? Why are you charging people twice for the exact same game? It's total bullshit! If you want the HD version of the game for your tablet, you have to purchase it separately from the phone version. Madfinger *use* to do this with their THD games but recently, have been doing things right by releasing one version which is compatible with various devices. My biggest gripe is with developers that are too lazy to combine their standard and HD apps. Having both versions combined will only reach a wider audience. I don't care, charge me twice as much if that makes you feel better, but don't make me download two different copies of the same app!

I am curious as to what you guys think about this? I think it's time we put some pressure on these devs to do things right."	t5_2qlqh	True

http://www.cultofmac.com/133246/apple-could-knock-the-worlds-biggest-android-maker-out-of-the-u-s-tomorrow/

its ridiculous and I sent the following to google today:

I have found preexisiting features in 1980's software invalidating a claim on apple U.S. Patent N 5,946,647 to shut down all android phones

The whole apple claim is infuriating to me because the claim is something that was implemented in at least one common software I used from 1983's called Sidekick from borland.

Furthermore I believe it was a fairly common feature in many programs that read internet mail and messages from bulletin boards.
The 1980's DOS software ""sidekick"" from Borland International could recognize a phone number in text and highlight it and if you clicked on it call that number using your pc's modem.

The software is generally described here:
from [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SideKick[/url]
""Sidekick v1.11c

SideKick was an early Personal Information Manager (PIM) software application by Borland launched in 1983 under Philippe Kahn's leadership. It was notable for being a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which enabled it to load into memory then return the computer to the DOS command prompt, allowing the user to load another application, but still activate SideKick using a hot key combination (by default: Ctrl-Alt). This approach allowed instantaneous task switching in the otherwise-single-tasking DOS operating system. Although a text mode program, its window-based interface echoed that of the Apple Macintosh, and anticipated the eventual look of Microsoft Windows 2.0. It featured a personal calendar, text editor (with WordStar-like command interface), calculator, ASCII chart, and address book/phone dialer. According to the Borland IPO prospectus, SideKick sold more than one million copies in its first three years.""

While that description doesn't cut it i can tell you it could auto recognize phone numbers from text and highlight them and if you clicked them it would dial your modem.


The original sidekick software is available from

(link removed so the site isn't overwhelmed by redditors beofre google can download a copy)

in the zip file you will find the help file called sk.hlp where the previous quote was taken.
you can open that hlp file with a hex editor if nothing else.

In that original copy of the software downloadable online, in the archive is the help file sk.hlp and the following description:

""More..Dialer  takes phone numbers from its own phone di-

rectory or directly from the screen.  You may find

the number with your database program,  and  Side-

kick will use your modem to make the call!

               ""


Additionally in that help file it described how the software used special characters thatnormally appeared in phone numbers to recognize them as phone numbers

""The phone number may contain digits, parentheses,
hyphens,  and spaces, and it must contain either a
parentheses or a hyphen to be recognized.

The number may also contain the following characters
with special meaning""

It relates to the claim cited by apple in

The apple patent ""infringed was filed in 1996"" so this software clearly predates that.



a general discussion of the apple patent is below from

[url]http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/07/these-tables-show-how-android-infringes.html[/url]
U.S. Patent No. 5,946,647
""covers a ""system and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data"". Like most patents, this one consists of multiple claims. In a way, each patent claim is like a patent of its own when it comes to the question of infringement. The ITC judge found that the accused HTC products infringe claims 1, 8, 15 and 19 of that patent. If you see that claim 1 of a given patent is infringed, that means in most cases that the broadest claim in the patent -- or at least one of its broadest few claims -- is infringed. (Those are the kinds of claims that can be as easy to walk around as the Great Wall of China.)

In its complaint, Apple described this patent (which was applied for back in 1996 and which will expire on February 1, 2016) as follows:

   The '647 patent generally relates to a computer-based system and method for detecting structures and performing computer-based actions on the detected structures. In particular, this invention recognizes that computer data may contain structures, for example, phone numbers, post-office addresses, and dates, and performs related actions with that data. The '647 patent accomplishes this by identifying the structure, associating candidate actions to the structures, enabling selections of an action, and automatically performing the selected action on the structure. For instance, the system may receive data that includes a phone number, highlight it for a user, and then, in response to a user's interaction with the highlighted text, offer the user the choice of making a phone call to the number.'

ridiculous!

I submit this for open dissemination and hopes someone in a position to do something about stopping this ridiculous patent claim will file a motion to do it.


disclaimer:
I am not a lawyer.
this is not legal advice.
I am a researcher with some experience in patent research.




I sent this to google to prevent the great harm to the millions of android users that could come from enforcement of this ridiculous patent claim by apple.

viewing apples claims table from

I beleive this sidekick software invalidates ALL of the ""647"" patent. most of the claims are so generla and ridiculous they would be predated by any computer of the 1980's when combined with recognizing and doing something with a data structure liek a phonenumber which the pc running the sidekick softare did in 1983.

**EDIT 3**: Here's two videos showing it (camera ironically crashed during the first one). [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ3wE1rjYUU) and [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDmISlmwZY0).

**EDIT 2**: Thank you everyone for your feedback and suggestions. Someone from HTC saw this and has reached out to me to expedite getting this resolved. I'll keep everyone posted on how it goes!

**EDIT**: This is not an attempt to garner reddit justice or anything like that. I just want to share my experience for anyone that's considering purchasing and HTC device down the line, and what it's been like dealing with warranty support.

I took a chance. I had a Nexus 4 that I loved and sold it to my sister because she is moving abroad and needed an unlocked phone. I bought an HTC One developer edition (better deal than the GE since I could flash a GE ROM and get 64GB of memory). Below is a rough outline of the events since then:

- Got a new HTC One (developer edition)
- Camera is broken ([purple tint low-light in photos](http://i.imgur.com/2DGXEGT.jpg), known issue with some devices)
- Here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kKOWPyb.jpg) when the camera's covered (it should normally just be black)
- Call customer service, get a warranty repair order set up, told it should take a week tops
- Ship to service center in Houston
- Get email with service ticket
- Status update site doesn't show me any information, ever
- Call to find out what's going on, HTC rep says they have no record of receiving my device
- Call RMA the next day, they say it's already in repair
- Still no updates on website
- Call next day, told there's no record of them having the device again
- Get called back the next day, told they had the serial number wrong and have made a new repair ticket
- Call back a few days later, repair still hasn't started, new information still gives no updates on the repair status site
- Repair finally starts after a week and a half, I call for an update and to tell them to ship it to my Austin address since I'm moving back.
- Repair completes, ships out with fedex
- Shipping to wrong address (old, not the new one I told them)
- Call HTC, RMA people already gone for the day, and it's supposed to arrive the next day, told to call back that day.
- Call the next day, they have it changed (and have no record of the address ever being changed), now shipping is bumped back 4 days.
- Finally get it 4 days later (this past monday), after having been without a phone for almost 3 weeks.
- THEY DIDN'T EVEN ADDRESS THE CAMERA ISSUE. All they did was replace a defective speaker they apparently noticed in diagnostics. No explanation on camera.
- Call to find out what the fuck happened, after telling the whole story again to a customer service rep I finally reach someone in RMA and am told that the camera issue is a ""software"" (I think he meant to say firmware) issue with the camera that will be fixed in a future update ""eventually"". And that my phone never should have been sent in for repair since it ""wasn't hardware"". Why I was never told any of this? Who the fuck knows.
- I tentatively accepted this explanation and was just willing to deal with it (camera still works fine in daylight), but then I find out that they've locked the bootloader while it was in repair as well! Now it just says ""Re-locked"" in the bootloader.
- The whole purpose of getting a developer edition is that the bootloader is unlocked out of the box, and now they've just relocked it.
- Tried unlocking with HTCDev and revolutionary, NEITHER work.
- Tried RUU-ing, can't even get the RUU to recognize my device.
- On top of all that, periodically google-related services just start force closing continuously, rendering the device unusable until I reboot.
- Can't hard-reboot either (holding down the power button forever brings up the dialog counting down, but never gets past 1 second and just hangs. Basically have to plug it in and do adb reboot instead).
- Call angrily again, at this point I just want answers, and am now waiting ""3-5 business days"" for a response.

Yet they still can't figure out why they're a failing company. I'm at a loss for words with how incredibly incompetent their customer support has been, and don't really know what else I can do at this point.

TL;DR: I sent in my developer edition One for camera repair, they lost it, found it, didn't repair the camera, said they did, (seemingly irreversibly) relocked the bootloader, and sent it back. Still no explanation."	t5_2qlqh	True

I work a normal 9-5 shift, and Google Now's traffic alerts are always, and I mean ALWAYS, right for me. 

Friday mornings I usually get to sleep in because there is no traffic. Especially this week for whatever reason I've gotten to work 15-20 minutes earlier every day, so I planned on sleeping later than normal. What happens when my alarm does go off and I look at my phone? A traffic alert saying it will take over an hour to get to work! (Normal time for me is about 30 minutes, no traffic is about 18 minutes). I had no idea it was snowing so I jumped out of bed, ran out the door, and got to work 45 minutes late. Luckily my boss is off today, but having Now integrated into my alarm would have saved me this trouble.

TL;DR: Having Google Now integrated into your alarm could save you from being late when there is unexpected traffic."	t5_2qlqh	True
1349187651.0	10tf4s	[Update]  I just switched from a GNex to an iPhone 5.  Spoiler:   I switched back.  Here's a list of reasons why.	mph1204	3252	1495	955	"Hey all.  I posted about a week ago about switching from the GNex to the iPhone 5.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/10gvfr/i_just_switched_from_a_gnex_to_an_iphone_5_heres/) is the original post.  

After about 3 years using various Android devices, I switched back to an iPhone 5.  I did it because I was missing the ""just works"" aspect of the iPhone and I missed the huge library of apps and games that came with iTunes.  I wrote the last post because I wanted to give people an idea of what they might experience when going from Android to iPhone.  This post, I'm going to tell you why the transition was harder than I expected and why I switched back.  I hope this will save some people from the hassle of transitioning if they're on the fence.

Well, after 10 days of using my new iPhone, I switched back to Android.  I returned the iPhone and got myself an S3 last night and am quite happy with it.  (I had sold the Gnex to pay for the iPhone)  Why did I do it?

Reasons I switched back:

* Control:  After a few years, I've really gotten used to full control of my phone.  I switched from an unlimited plan to a shared data plan and I didn't realize how bad the iPhone is while using a shared data plan.  The damned thing switches off wifi after about 15 min of inactivity!  i blew through about 700mb of background downloads before figuring that out.  Even if you don't deactivate background downloads in Android, at least you can set a persistent wifi connection.  Apps like Tasker and Llama can help you limit usage as well.  Now, you can restrict background downloads on the iPhone, but it's much more complicated and you have to do it for each individual app instead of phone-wide. Settings in iOS are scattered.  You can find app settings either in the System Settings or in each individual app.  It gets confusing.  

* Easy access:  I had gotten used to easy access to all of my information.  When I first switched to iPhone, I figured I'd have an easy time.  After all, the only widgets I was die hard about keeping were my stock ticker and my weather widget.  Both were integrated well into the iOS notification area.  I forgot about my music widgets, news widgets, GTasks widget and my (how could i forget) reddit widget.  

* Home screen:  One thing that I didn't think would annoy me as much as it did was the iOS home screen.  I've gotten used to Android's homescreen that showed only the apps that I use on a regular basis.  With the iPhone, you really don't have many options other than hiding the app in a folder or just uninstalling it.  Not to mention certain apps like Newstand still can't be uninstalled, hidden or put into a folder.  I thought they would have figured something out for that by now!

* Integration:  I realized after a few days that I am now REALLY hooked into the Google environment.  Gmail, Cal, Tasks, all that crap.  Although iOS has some integration with the Google apps (which really aren't that bad), it's nothing like what I've got with Android.  I rely on my calendars and tasks lists to get things done.  It was pretty hellacious not having them one or two clicks away.

* Expandable storage:  I had a GNex with 32GB of nonremoveable storage.  That was fine.  I could live with it.  I paid about 300 bucks for it at the time and was happy with it.  When I bought the iPhone, I purchased a 64GB one.  I immediately regretted it.  I couldn't believe I spent an extra 200 bucks on 48GB or storage.  I couldn't console myself with the fact that there wasn't a lower storage option like the case with the Gnex.  I'm happier with the S3's expandable storage.  I was able to add 64GB to my phone for only 50 bucks.  Thank goodness.

* Notifications:  Jesus fucking christ.  I knew the iOS notifications were bad, but I didn't realize HOW BAD.  First off, they interrupt during anything you do, which is nothing new.  However, I didn't realize how much that went on in the phone that you just were not notified about.  In Android, I appreciated notifications whenever there was a podcast downloaded in the background or I uploaded something to a cloud storage device.  In iOS, you don't get those notifications and therefore your data usage can be unexpectedly high in this era of limited data.

Things that I thought were important to me but turned out not so much:

* Screen:  I was very attracted to the screen on the iPhone 5.  I could look at it in the sun and it still maintained the brightness.  This is still not the case with my new S3.  It's brighter than my Gnex for sure, but it's still not to the same level as the iPhone 5.  This isn't something that I can really affect, but I also realized that it's not as important to me as I thought.  Squinting a bit in daylight is a small price to pay for functionality.  The large screen and display are far more than adequate as long as you're not comparing the two screens in direct sunlight.

* Ergonomics:  I really liked the iPhone's aspect ratio.  I thought the ability to use the phone with one hand was great.  You can say what you want about Apple, but they definitely did a good job combining ergonomics with increased screen size on this one.  I could reach all of the keyboard keys easily and typed with one hand easily.  It's something that I miss on the S3, which I think is a bit too wide to use with one hand.  I do have to say though, that the Swype-like functionality on the S3's keyboard makes up for it.  Another point for Android:  swappable keyboards.

* Apps:  The big one I thought was going to be apps and games.  I own an iPad and can see what games are available on the iTunes store.  I was envious of all of the options that iOS device owners had.  After a few days in the iOS environment, I realized it wasn't that impressive after all.  Most of the top games are unique and fun, but many of the others are clones or full of in-app purchases.  This isn't all that different from Android, but then, why switch if there isn't a difference?  All of the major big name games (notable exceptions include Infinity Blade) are available on Android and run smoothly on current gen phones.  I still have an iPad that I can install the games on and I've realized that the Play Store is more than adequate for me. 

* Lag and stutter:  My GNex stuttered a bit even on JB.  My S3 currently is on stock everything, but even so, the ICS is pretty smooth.  I expect it to be smoother in JB.  I still expect input lag and stuttering if I have a ton of programs open, but at least this is something that I can control.  It's a small price to pay for the rest of the benefits from Android.  I've also changed my mind.  I no longer believe the stuttering can't be improved by hardware.  I figured it was just inherent in the OS, but I see now that there are ways to mitigate it using fast enough hardware which has only recently been introduced.

* ""iPhone:  it just works"":  NO. IT. DOESN""T.  And I'm not even talking about Maps.  We've all heard the horror stories, but I never used Maps in a way that the change would affect me much.  I didn't use the public transportation information in Google Maps and I didn't find anything important missing in the new iOS Maps.  What I'm talking about is virtually every other one of the iOS default apps.  The Podcast app is atrocious.  You start a download in the Podcast app and where does it start downloading?  Not the Podcast app.  It downloads in the iTunes app.  But if you want to cancel the download, you have to cancel it in both the Podcast and iTunes apps.  WTF.  The new iTunes layout is horrible and laggy.  On the brand spankin new hardware of the iPhone 5, the new iTunes is about as speedy as the Amazon App Store is on most Android phones, which is to say not very.  There are other examples too.  The Mail client is buggy syncing with Gmail.  It also automatically stops syncing at low battery levels, which I guess could be nice but can also be problematic if you rely on emails for work.

Things that were surprisingly important to me:

* The cable connector:  That fucking cable connector.  I figured, who cares that they have a new cable connector.  It won't affect me all that much.  It's just another proprietary charger, what's the big deal?  Well, after the first day of using it, I realized that it was a huge detriment.  The iPhone's battery can last all day, that's for sure.  However, I had one busy ass day at the office and was using my phone constantly.  What didn't I have at that point?  A way to charge my phone.   I wasn't initially too concerned but then the reports came out that there was a embedded microchip that made it difficult to buy cheap cables online.  No way in hell I'm paying 20-40 bucks for another charger when I have 10+ microUSB cords at home already. 

* Google Talk:  I use GTalk as pretty much my primary mode of communication.  Wow, the GTalk clients for iOS suck.  I haven't figured out one that can maintain a persistent connection.  I guess that's a real world example of the drawbacks of iOS's ""multitasking"".

* Syncing/Access to file system:  I know, I know.  I shouldn't have been surprised to miss this so much.  I figured, I will still have access to my media on the iPhone and how bad could iTunes really be?  Well...it's bad.  It's really really bad.  Syncing takes forever and god forbid you decide you want to sync your podcasts and videos along with your music.  It'll do the whole process all over again with the music before getting to the rest.  And there's no god damned reason I need all those apps taking up space on my computer hard drive.  Most of them, I deleted and won't ever use again.  However, they're still stuck on my computer and will sync to my iPhone unless I go through the tedious process of checking and unchecking the apps individually.

So that's my story.  I gave iOS a shot, but decided the few benefits were not worth all of the hassle.  I now know that I use my phone more as a computer than an appliance and iOS can not meet all of my needs at the moment.

1346066575.0	ywd81	Reddit Sync has been removed from Google Play	ljdawson	2586	1041	482	"Just woke up to an email from Google Play informing me that the free version of Reddit Sync has been banned without warning for the following reasons:

-----

&gt;REASON FOR REMOVAL: Violation of the intellectual property and impersonation or deceptive behavior provisions of the Content Policy.

-----

I've checked the [content policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html#impersonation) and am at a complete loss as to why it has been pulled. If it's just for having the word Reddit in the title I'd be surprised. All images and assets in the app follow their respective licenses so I doubt it's that either.

The app was even previously [reviewed by some guys at Google](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXUsPAGWd4&amp;t=30m43s) who didn't seem to think it was deceptive...

I have no idea what to do, I have been working on this app for just under a year and it has been a complete labour of love. Would appreciate any suggestions, thanks.

1352254704.0	12rn7u	Titanium Backup just became 1000% more useful!	abqnm666	2315	796	301	"A few weeks ago I sent a suggestion to Titanium Track, the developers of Titanium Backup.  I liked their function to create an update.zip for installing Titanium Backup, but felt that they could do more.  I suggested that they give us the ability to create an update.zip with the current backup set so that when flashing ROMs, we can flash our entire Titanium Backup at the same time so that when booting the first time, all apps and data would already be there, eliminating the need to take 20-40 minutes to install them all from the app.

Today, Titanium Backup was updated with the following changes:

What's in this version:
• [PRO] Can create update.zip containing apps+data, apps only or data only. Both user &amp; system apps are supported and the file can be signed.
• [PRO] Can upload files &gt;150 MB to Dropbox.
• Improved ""Overview of app storage use"" screen, shows app location &amp; supports refresh / click / long-click.
• [PRO] Improved fault tolerance for Dropbox upload.
• Fixed failure to un-protect backups on ext2/3/4.
• Fixed possible FC when importing a backup.
• Misc bugfixes &amp; improvements.
• Updated translations.

This means that now we can flash a ROM and all apps at once and have a fully running system on any ROM in just a few minutes!  Of course, this is with the paid version, but for any rooted user, this should be the first purchase made anyhow.

Thank you, Titanium Track!

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup

Update:

I have been working with the dev for the last few days to help work out the issues.  There is an update live in the Play Store that should help with the update.zip files, especially with data restores.  The app didn't seem to install data correctly from the hidden directory where the update.zip flashes the data to.  I was noticing that TiBu was not asking for root when the phone first booted, which led me to contact the dev again about root at boot.  Now it will ask up to 10 times at 10 second intervals to try to get root so it can complete the data restore from the update.zip."	t5_2qlqh	True

&gt;That's led some to believe that the current Nexus 4, a device advertised with HSPA+ connectivity, might actually be hiding LTE support to be unlocked in a future software update.

Notice how they've intentionally left it as an open possibility. The date of the article hasn't changed, although the title has changed slightly from 

&gt;No, your Nexus 4 won't magically grow LTE support

to

&gt;Why your Nexus 4 won't magically grow LTE support

I put this in the comments of the article but it was deleted, as have other user comments critical of the issue.

I just thought this was interesting because the article got quite a lot of attention at the time and made very strong, definitive conclusions and predictions which have turned out to be false, and now they're trying to make it look like the predictions they made were less definitive.

**EDIT:**

Seeing as this has hit the top of /r/Android, I'll point out another (more minor) grievance with the Drive app. Holding down on an item brings up a list of options, and pressing the little arrow beside it brings you to a [separate screen with this weird text-selction top bar](http://imgur.com/TA5CJte) and **all the same options in a different arrangement**. They could've just had a button to the right for a popup menu of those options, like in People and Google Music, and had hold-down be used to select multiple files, like in Gmail.

**EDIT 2:**

Enough with saying Google doesn't want file browsers. I get it. I'm only looking for it to work as well as it would if you went to drive.google.com in your browser and downloaded the files from there. It does not do that. That has **nothing to do with file browsers**.

**EDIT 3:**

I know you can download from Drive in a web browser. **This is about the Android app,  not the website**.

________________
 I've seen a few posts surrounding this app called Pushbullet recently. The idea of this app is to push things like text and files from desktop to Android. Its popularity highlights a vacuum of a better way to do this. And while I in no way want to detract from the hard work or deserved success of the Developer, the primary function of this app wouldn't be necessary if Google allowed users proper access to their own data.

In the [Google Drive app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLmRvY3MiXQ..), you can readily make files available offline, but this doesn't work the same way as downloading from a browser, or Dropbox. Making available offline only makes it available to interact with through the Drive app.

So if you want to download a file to do anything with other than Google Drive, you have to turn off encryption in the settings, make the file available offline, then use a third party file browser to delve into sdcard/Android/data/com.google.android.apps.docs/files/pinned_docs_do_not_edit/ and then search through one of many folders whose names say nothing about their contents until you find your file and can copy it somewhere where it can be found.

I see people here criticising things like the design of Google Music or the lack of unified messaging, but never the astonishing lack of this basic, incredibly useful feature which is readily available on the desktop but withheld from the Android app.

1359393025.0	17fqgz	Groupon is misleading customers with its deal on the 16GB Nexus 7 tablet.	andrewwithnumbers	2284	857	409	"Groupon is misleading customers with Nexus 7 'deal'. The Nexus 7 16GB model is $199, but they are advertising it as normally $260. I emailed them asking where they got the $260 price from, let them know you can buy one brand new from Google Play or Staples for $199.

EDIT: Here is reply #1
&gt;(**GROUPON**) Sorry for any confusion. It is never our intention to mislead anyone about the value of a Groupon.

&gt;The value and discount percentage listed on each deal reflect the regular full price for that product or service. If the business offers other temporary discounts or decides to change their standard pricing after their deal is featured, the relative savings and value might change.

&gt;Unfortunately, we cannot foresee or control these changes. That said, we work very hard to make sure that the deals we feature are the best in town.

To which I replied,

&gt;(**ME**) The price hasn't changed since the Nexus 7 was released by Google. It hasn't gone on sale. The full price of the 16 GB model has always been $199. I can understand an honest mistake, and I assume this is one. However, you really ought to update the information in your offered deal to stay honest. 

and,

&gt;(**ME**) So, apparently when the device originally came out, it was $199 for the 8gb model, and $249 for the 16gb model. But they changed the lineup a while back. It's $199 for the 16gb model and $249 for the 32gb model.

&gt;It is still misleading to your customers to suggest that a 16gb Nexus 7 is $260 elsewhere, but you're offering it for $70 cheaper. It's actually only $10 cheaper. 

EDIT2: Here is reply #2

&gt;(**GROUPON**) List prices may be based on a survey of other online merchants, tied to a particular merchant’s current or former price, or suggested by either the manufacturer or our supplier. It is not necessarily representative of current prices of other online merchants or the prevailing retail price in every area

&gt;We try to offer a variety of deals that interest our diverse list of subscribers. I'm sorry that the deal offered today didn't appeal to you. Fortunately, we offer more than one deal a day in most cities, and every day brings a new deal!

To which I replied,

&gt;(**ME**) Well by that logic, you could pick a price at any point in time--no matter how egregiously overstated or totally non-comparable to today's prices--and use that as your advertised savings. You are advertising a  $70, or 30% savings, when it's actually only a $10, or 5% savings (if that). Not to mention this is comparing a refurbished model to a brand-new model. There is likely no savings at all here.

&gt;This isn't like a clothing or entertainment or food offer, where prices are wildly variable across markets and retailers, and some variance can be expected. This is a clear, easily identifiable, commonly-priced product across retailers. And the difference between what you're advertising and reality is materially misstated. This is apparently not an oversight; you are intentionally and purposely misleading your customers.

&gt;I was hoping Groupon would take the opportunity to keep themselves in honest territory, but apparently that's not going to be the case. Therefore, you have lost at least one Groupon customer, myself. Additionally, I have posted this whole ordeal including the back-and-forth comments/replies on Reddit. So far most folks are in agreement with my position.

EDIT3: If you click on their 'Ask a Question' button towards the bottom of the ad, it takes you to the Q&amp;A section. Looks like they posted my question, albeit edited, in their questions section. So I will give them credit for that. But they're still advertising total misinformation about the price/savings. Hope savvy consumers click the 'Ask a Question' button and see that it's a bad deal...

I usually don't mess with your files in your apps data-dir, so go crazy there, please don't do that in the space where I'm trying to organize my photos, music, ...

Quite a lot of widely used apps don't even let me choose the folder used for backups or additionally downloaded data. This clutters the view, accounts for excessive and unneeded scrolling and generally makes all processes involving file management a more time consuming task and also makes it harder to create custom backup scripts.

So please, I ask you kindly to clean up. Since the XDG spec already exists for the desktop, I'd be ok with just using that. I know, that not all filesystems in use, espacially FAT-XX, support hidden folders, I could live with visible folders as long as they are organized.

So please, drop your files in /{sdcard-path}/[.]{config,local,data}/yourapphere/stuff or at the very least, let me choose my own folder structure by giving me the chance to configure your storage paths.

1369232241.0	1eu28n	Since nearly every site just ignored I/O after the Keynote was over, here are some little facts and speculations I find interesting.	axehomeless	2054	690	144	"If you're like me, you probably had a lot of anticipation for Google I/O. And even though there wasn't a new N7 or Android 4.3, there was a whole bunch of nice stuff in the sessions that could have warranted for a few articles from our loved bloggers. But they never came. So I thought I throw around some stuff, see what sticks. Let’s jump right in.


**1. What's up with the next version of Android?**

I'm fairly certain that when the I/O sessions were planned, a place for the 4.3 announcement was in the keynote. Under other circumstances, Google would have never held that graphics talk the way they did. What went wrong and when the decision came to pull the 4.3 announcement and why, we don't know, but there are a few guesses that don't sound too far fetched, but more on that later.


 - What do we know about 4.3?

First, we pretty much know that it's gonna be 4.3 and still be called Jelly Bean. AP discussed this in their podcast, all the usual signs are there, server logs, leaked builds, benchmark stats (IIRC). The reasons for that could be pretty simple, A year of new versions of Jelly Bean makes the Android Ecosystem seem less fragmented (an area ""critics"" love to adress) and they can reserve the big number (5.0) and a new name for a new major release, which isn't coming or needed right now.


 - What do we know or can reasonably guess is coming with the new update?

The next step in project butter is here, we know that much. I don't understand enough in computing to really grasp this, but in that one session, Googlers announced that they will change the way 2D graphics are drawn. Th GPU apparantly hates when it ""changes states"" (I'm guessing that means doing different stuff than before) and therefore it is much more efficient and faster to regroup things to draw so that first all the white space gets drawn simultaniously, then all the text, then all the pictures etc. and not from top to bottom no matter what you draw like it works prior to 4.3. Don't nail me to the cross on that, I don't really understand this, so I could very well be wrong.

It will however make all existing apps much smoother, there shouldn't be a need to change code or recompile anything for this to take effect. So when we get 4.3, everything 2D will be smoother. Also, developers get awesome new tools to check if their app runs smoothly and if not, why not. Why I think this is project butter is because they announced it back at last year’s I/O as a project to make the UI consistently run at 60FPS, and they talked about exactly that throughout the talk this year. In the Q&amp;A, they specifically stated that project butter hasn't finished with 4.1 and most likely will never be finished. So this is it. And it's coming now, they said it will be there in API level 18, we're at 17 right now. So brace yourselves for smoothness.


 -  Another project like Butter exists

Something much more speculative but still very interesting: In the same Q&amp;A (I think it was the fireside chat with Morill and Duarte) they were asked if there are other projects like butter going on in Android. The answer was yes. This could mean anything, from design to low touch latency, but the most important thing for users is battery life, without a doubt. We all know it, and Google knows it too. Woodside and Schmidt said this when the last batch of Motorola phones were announced, Google released a new low-power location API and I think the Android team is working at their project roadrunner. We don't know if this is really a thing, we don't know if this would be included in 4.3, we don’t know how it’s called. This is obviously the most nebulous point here and I won't eat my own dick if this doesn't surface in the next year, but I think Google is working on this, and I think they're doing this for quite awhile, it just feels right to get that out there now. *I want to believe*


 - bluetooth improvements and new features

It already has been announced that new bluetooth stuff is coming, finally BLE and more information like ID3Tag for Audio over bluetooth. I only use bluetooth for my keyboard so it doesn't really affect me, but from what I hear, the change in the bluetooth stack didn't go as smoothly as hoped in 4.2 so this should fix some of the existing issues as well. For you who use bluetooth in the car, it will be pretty great for music to see what's playing and we finally have native support for all these little bluetooth gadgets to consume less power. We know this for sure.


And finally my biggest hope for 4.3:

 - A comprehensive and reliable way for App-Data sync.

Another reason why it seems that 4.3 was pulled last minute rather than two months ago, the new play service that rolled out shortly before I/O had this in it, without doing much on Android right now.

But I hope to the gods it will be a reliable and widespread way to backup and sync everything between devices that isn't backup-ed and synced right now. Imagine you could choose what data just miraculously stays on your phone but is backup-ed, what also syncs to your tablet, what will be restore when you get replacement phone or a different one. I could finally tell my dad that he doesn't have to use helium and cumbersome processes and just doesn't need to worry anymore. Phone broken? Tell Google and get your new one, enter WiFi and Google Account and everything will be like yesterday, send your old phone back when you got the time.

I think for this to work properly, there need to be some changes in Android directly, and the fact that they launched the option/function in play services already means that this should come soon. And if it does like we hope, this will be the last major gap in Android closing for normal consumers. 


So the question now is:

 - When do we see the new version of Android?

My best guess is 10th of June. That's the rumored date for the white Nexus 4 launch. The leaks about this device are substantial, it looks very real and it would be perfect to launch with the new version of Android. We can assume both the N4 in white and 4.3 seem pretty ready, so I don't think it will take long to see both, and the rumored date for that is in two and a half weeks.





So the first big chunk is done, what could we gather from the sessions that wasn't covered by usual 
techblogs?

 **- high performance audio**

I had high hopes for that talk, maybe you did too. I like music, I love the garage band experience on the iPad, I really would have loved if they just came out and said “we did it, you just need to do this and that with your app and it’ll be perfect.” Sadly that wasn’t the case.

This talk didn’t mention anything new for API Level 18 like the graphics talk did and it didn’t seem like they made enough progress since 4.1 for any real improvement to be implemented in 4.3. They remained very enthusiastic and told time and again that they are working on it and want to get all audio related latencies down to unnoticable. So I/O told us that there is hope, we need to hang in there but there won’t be anything like on iOS anytime soon. Also it became quite clear that with audio apps, the fragmentation really is a big problem. Yes, Rubin and Schmidt called it differentiation, and most of the time that’s true, we surpassed the point where fragmentation is a real issue most of the time, but here it is. I won’t go into the details because again, I don’t understand them, but it seems to me that if an audio app works great, it depends on hardware and software, means your app has to adapt to a lot of the different hardware (and maybe test for it) and even kernel specific stuff can ruin your day. That’s why this team works with OEMs to get the non-AOSP versions of Android in the right directions. Bottom line: Android high performance audio is still a mess but they’re trying hard. But it’s not nearly on the verge of become good enough. And if it does, it will take a long time if we ever get as much and as good of audioapps for android as iOS does.



Moving on to something we completely forgot about after the keynote:

 **- the redesigned webversion of the play store and the services**

Yes, we talked about Google Play Music All Access and the redesign of music and the upload of books, but I think  the redesign fell short.

I think the webversion of the play store is ugly and we still don’t have wishlists. They kind of announced a redesign at the keynote, and I’m very surprised that it isn’t there yet, because they never said anything about when it’s gonna launch so I just assumed it was right away.  I just want to ask the question: When are we going to see this? 

Also, the Play movies section needs some serious work besides the availability and the very limited selection. It’s astonishing to see that the company that owns youtube has not even figured out how to play their content in 720P in the browser, let alone support for 1080P or 4K. I hope to the gods that when the new movies web section launches, this will be fixed. Also, with upload for music and books, it would be awesome If we could upload movies and TV Shows to some extent (hopefully with playtime-syncing). This would make chromebooks a lot more appealing as a secondary device to me and very handy for my tablet use. This might be due when the new web play store hits.



And here we go with the last big bit of speculation, and it involves the big screen.

 **- Google TV and devices**

I think the “Android: as seen on TV” session was the most interesting thing to speculate about from I/O.

You may notice that the session didn’t include the term “Google TV”, which is a good thing, this term needs to die, the brand (not the technology) has failed, it’s dead. Android on the other hand is strong and a lot of people do know it and associate something positive with it. But Android as seen on TV won’t be just another name for a butchered version of android on TVs, I think it finally describes Google TV getting completely integrated into AOSP. It will detect  the TV and switch to a Google TV UI. Google achieves a few things with this. They will make it easier for people and corporations to get Android working on a TV and they will counter all these smart TVs from manufacturers that warp android into their own little weird Smart TV. If Sharp or LG or Samsung builds a smart TV with Android and most of the software  pieces are already there, the incentive to cram in their own stuff in isn’t that pressing, it would be fully functioning without it and has all the advantages of normal AOSP that TV manufacturers already use.

Alongside with this comes a “high end device this summer” that we know for sure. They said it in the Q&amp;A. I would speculate that this is the Douglas-Adams-reference that passed through the FCC a week ago and is supposed to be a Nexus Q successor. And I think It will be. But it also will be a ~~Google TV~~ “Android on the big screen” device. I still think they will update the Nexus Q when this launches with 4.3 that now also is Google TV.

It’s important that it’s a high end device because Google demoed Asphalt 7 on such a device and said that some other guy was upstairs and showed cloud gaming. So it will be powerful enough for Android games and reach into the market of OUYA, but it also may be that Google is preparing, what I already suggest in /r/chromeos, a cloud gaming service.
This would fit in nicely with Google’s strategy to make cloud computing mainstream and would give chromebooks, Android in the livingroom and portable android devices an enormous boost. Everybody complains about Gaming in Google’s garden, this would address everything with a bang and put them directly into competition with one of microsofts biggest footholds and cashcows, the XBox.

Also would it get Google into our living rooms which could finally pave the way for Android @ home.

I think this has been holding 4.3 back, it’s a big step both technically and from the relevance to the ecosystem, I think Google wants to get this right. Cloud gaming seems like it’s still too far away but the rest should be announced alongside 4.3, the white Nexus 4, the Nexus Q successor and if we are lucky, a new Nexus 7 at June 10th. I’m giddy already.

So there it is, my crazy assumptions and thoughts expressed in a lot of text. I hope you enjoyed reading and tell me what you think.

HTC saw this and contacted me asking if I wanted to have a few phones to give away to random people I encounter! They're sending my a few Sensation XL's at the moment ([FedEx says](http://i.imgur.com/uf0s3.png) it will arrive on Monday) and I believe some HTC One V's some time in the future. 

I decided that I'll give 2 fellow Redditors a Sensation XL each! Here are the rules.

* Post a comment below and you will be entered to win (unless it's rude or offensive). Upvotes would be appreciated but are not a requirement :)
* Anyone can apply for the draw. I won't be paying for postage (still on a student budget) so if you win, you will have to pay for the shipping. If you refuse, I will just pick another person.
* Only accounts created before the creation of this post are qualified (sorry! make sure you're registered by the next giveaway!). *12:15AM 14th September 2012, GMT+1*
* I will randomly pick the 2 winners on Monday 17th September at 11:59PM GMT!

**Good luck!**

1350769098.0	11tcv8	The greatest feature Android could have but has been abandoned by Google: Google Voice	donrhummy	2056	699	690	"Anyone who has used Google Voice knows that it's about 75% of the way to being the perfect communication tool. 

* It can do VOIP. 
* It has transcribed voicemails and integrated texting, it has spam control for texts *and* calls. 
* It allows different greetings *and* rules for how to handle different callers (e.g. you can set it to send all calls from your family to your mobile, and all calls from your colleagues directly to voicemail). 
* It enables you to have one number that can ring **all** your phones.
* It has free, unlimited text messaging

But it's missing just a few things (MMS support for one) and has been all but abandoned over the last year in terms of new features. 

So why is this the greatest possible feature for Android? Imagine if this was fully integrated into Android - you'd have the possibility for a fully unlocked, VOIP-calling phone that could work without a carrier. Google could do what Amazon does with Whispernet and buy a certain amount of data to cover calls (which require very little data) that would come free with the phone so you wouldn't always need a wifi network. Then Google could sell a Nexus phone without the need for a carrier at all."	t5_2qlqh	True

The purchase of the smartphone handset needs to be separated from the carrier. Carriers have long proven themselves to be terrible at bringing good phones and features to market, although they do reasonably well at maintaining a network. Having the two tied together is not in the best interests of the customer. It means relegating carriers to a dumb pipe, and this is their worst fear, but I really don't care. They don't deserve my money when it comes to smartphone purchases.

The only reason the carriers continue to be a significant barrier to the advancement of mobile handsets is the 2-year customer contract lockdown; the only reason the two-year customer contract lockdown exists is because of the need for consumers to subsidize expensive phones. 

If Google could introduce a worthy $200 phone that would work on several carriers, contracts would die. They would be forced to offer better coverage and rates.

So, Google, I don't want Siri. I've seen the commercials, I've used it myself, and it's not something I want on my own device. I want something **better**.

The idea of Siri is clever but it's cumbersome because you have to physically interact with the device, an annoying extra step. Press a button and talk to find out the weather? Shit, I've got a widget for that. Also, it sounds like a transgender Speak-N-Spell.

You know what would really blow peoples' minds and change the game? You know what would really be a feature that would be the perfect merriment to an OS called Android? For it to be *aware*.

I want a device I can name, and a device that is always listening for *my* voice and ignores others. Without having to press anything or activate any app, I want to be able to say ""Hey Steve, what's the weather look like for this weekend?"" and I want my cleverly named phone to answer me back.

I know the whole naming thing goes against the Star Trek vibe that's been discussed, but I want to name it, damn it. Think of HAL, think of GLaDOS, think of Master Control, think of almost every interactive AI in sci-fi history. You know it needs it, and if not for that, then at least for the fact that most people probably interact with their phone as much as they do anyone else in a day's time.

Seriously, Google. Leave the catch up game to those other guys. Blow our minds.

Lilday	2382	1076	360	"I'm sure we have plenty of programmers, artists, developers and a large community to test the apps.

This would all just be in our free time. We set up an IRC or something to discuss a few ideas and begin developing them. I'm sure this place is bursting with ideas for great apps - or even improvements/replacements to current apps.

**Edit #1** Okay - this took off significantly more than I expected, which is great. There is a lot of feedback already and this was just a simple idea. Your constructive criticism is what will move this idea forward. This is 100% community driven, so here are a few points to make:

- The ""free"" idea was just that - an idea. It would definitely be more practical to follow the path of most developers and offer 'premium' versions of our apps, with more features and/or expiry dates. Of course this brings other obstacles to over come - if there are say 30 developers...how do we split the money evenly? But I'm sure we can make this work.

- In order to stay organized I'm thinking we have a subreddit specifically for this purpose. ""AuthorityAction"" thought of the name *R*eddit *A*ndroid *D*evelopers, which I think is great. Right now we will run with that but of course - this is community driven and so it is open to negotiation. Right now I'm taking his +25 upvotes to say most people agree with him/her.

- The consensus seems to be towards open-source (as I expected to be honest), and I think this should be one of the main attributes of this community.

- It is going to take a lot of organization but we're working on it. Keep the suggestions and criticisms coming! If you think its a good idea - join in! if you think its a bad idea, point out the problems and we can address them as a community.

1363353216.0	1acjd4	My two cents on the Note II, and smartphones in general. 	LaFiero	2012	711	975	"Quick background: I'm probably what most would consider an average smartphone user.  I use my phone for fairly common things: email, text, weather, YouTube, browse the web, Google Reader (RIP). Nothing too heavy.  I’ve owned an iPhone 3G, a Samsung Captivate (OG Galaxy), Atrix 2, and a HTC One X.

I recently upgraded to a Note II (refurbished for $0.99 from AT&amp;T, woot woot) and it's completely changed the way I use my phone, but not for the reasons you might imagine.  

Yes, the large screen is nice and has changed the way I browse the web.  I can open up the desktop version of a website and read all of the text without having to zoom in, at all.  But the real thing that has changed how I use my phone?  Battery life.  And this isn't even bespoke to the Note II. The Razr Maxx (HD) gets great battery life.  But I wanted to post this to let people who are in the market for a new phone know that battery life really will change how you use your phone.  

From the moment I leave for school in the morning until the moment I go to sleep at night, I never, ever, even think about my Note II’s battery.  No matter what I'm doing. Watching 20 minutes of YouTube?  Don't even think about it.  Using Maps with GPS turned on?  Don't think about it.  Streaming music during my 45 minute commute?  Nope, don’t think about my battery.  In the past, all of these things would have had me frantically checking my phones battery.  It wasn’t until I got the Note II that I realized just how much I had been worrying about my phone's battery.  I used to constantly check it because below about 50%, all the phones I mentioned above would plummet. 

Here’s the interesting thing.  I think that battery life, more so than screen size, or software, or hardware, can actually change the way you USE your phone.  No matter what size screen you have, or what processor or what version of Android (or any other OS for that matter) you have, it won’t matter if you’re worried about your battery and you limit your use based on the fear of ending up with a dead phone.  Of all the phones I've owned, the biggest difference between them was the battery life of the Note II (minus iOS to Android).  

Obviously I realize you can bring a charger with you, or an extra battery (personally I hate carrying around more than I need), but there is a sort of freedom knowing that your phone’s battery isn't going to die. 

I read a lot of reviews and most of them say that the particular phone’s battery life is “adequate” or “should make it through an entire day.”  I won’t ever buy another phone that “should make it through the day,” because that’s all I’ll ever think about.  Maybe I'm just paranoid, I don't know.

[edit 1] Completely forgot about this, the Note II comes with a 2amp charger (as compared to the more common 1amp chargers). So even though it has a 3100mah battery, it actually charges as fast if not faster than most of my other electronics. 
That brings up a question I had: is charging speed determined by the battery or cpu? Because it seems like my other electronics don't charge any faster on the 2amp charger.

TL;DR - Battery life is the most important spec on any phone (within reason).  Buy your next phone based on its battery life because it actually determines how you use your phone.

[edit 2] (Made tldr more clear)

[edit 3] Thanks for upgoating this. It's nice that we can raise some awareness for our battery life woes. Hopefully Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Sony, and especially Google are subscribed to r/android. "	t5_2qlqh	True

So I decided to write my own.

After about a year of development, I feel it is mature enough to announce on Reddit!  Full source code included.  ***Requires rooted devices.***

**Edit: Some of you may have tried this app in the past only to discover that it didn't work on your device.  This is most likely because the ROM on the device did not have the netfilter/iptables LOG target built, but instead had NFLOG built.  Network Log now has support for NFLOG, and I encourage you to give it another try.**

  * https://github.com/pragma-/networklog (screenshots and source)
  * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.networklog (Google Play app page)

Wondering when and to where your Android apps are connecting across the Internet? Look no further! Network Log is for you!

Network Log monitors iptables-logging to display a real-time list of which apps are making network connections, and provides statistics about those app connections.

★ **Real-time log display**

The log tab shows the network packets being transmitted and their details such as:

    * source and destination addresses/ports
    * network protocol and interface
    * bytes transmitted
    * timestamp 

★ **Real-time network usage statistics**

The applications tab lists installed applications along with network usage statistics such as:

    * total packets and bytes sent
    * active network throughput speed in Bps/Kbps/Mbps
    * timestamp of last connection
    * list of all the unique connections made by each app
    * sortable and filterable 

★ **Real-time connection notifications**

The statusbar icon's up/down arrows will highlight when upload/download traffic occurs, and the notification drop-down shade displays the connection throughput speed in Kbps.

You can also configure toast pop-up notifications on a per-app basis that will pop-up a temporary notification containing connection details no matter which app you are in.

★ **Graphs**

Click an app in either tab to see time-lines of its connections.

Select the 'Apps Timeline' menu item to see an over-all time-line of all apps.

Adjustable interval from 1 ms to 48 hours for summing data:

    * to see each packet, set to 1 ms
    * for Kbps, set to 1 second
    * for Kb-per-hour, set to 1 hour; etc "	t5_2qlqh	True

You may already know a bunch, but I’m going to still type it because I want to practice typing. Yeah. That’s why. 

An Android Phone has multiple Partitions in it’s memory. The ones we will be facing usually are - 

1) /data - Here resides your personal data, wiping it will ‘factory restore’ your phone, removing all the data that is yours. 

2) /cache - Stores temporary files creates by the OS. 

3) /system - All ROM data, no UserData, wiping this will turn your phone into a $600 paper weight. Don’t worry, it’s not permanent, you can always flash a ROM/ Restore via some Official utility (RUUs for HTC, Odin for Samsung, etc) to fix it up.

4) /boot - This is the partition that enables the phone to boot. It includes the kernel and the ramdisk. Wiping this will also turn your phone into a $600 paper weight, but with the ROM on it. Again, MAY be fixed by flashing. 

5) /recovery - There is a stock Recovery in every device, but it does’t allow you to flash custom ROMs or do other stuff that Custom Recoveries allow you to do. This partition, usually booted by a combination of keys (For Example:  VolUp + Power), can save your device if you do something stupid, even if you wipe /boot.

6) Dalvik-cache - Not a partition, however important. Android apps run on a Virtual Machine called the Dalvik Virtual Machine. The Dalvik cache stores the temporary files for apps. When Android is “Optimizing Apps” after booting up, It’s actually creating files in the dalvik cache so apps run better. 

_____

‘Rooting’ is an incorrect term, grammatically, however widely used and yet, not far off from the truth. Basically, you gain root access (Admin Access) by ‘hacking’ into the phone. Once you have root access, you can do basically anything. There are multiple ways to ‘root’ a phone. Including flashing a Custom Kernel that is already ‘rooted’.

Unlocking the Bootloader, allows you to modify your partitions' data by flashing unsigned zips. Fastboot is a nice utility that allows you to flash stuff from the Bootloader menu in a phone. It can be a life saver. More on Bootloaders - [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/hkbf3/so_you_want_to_know_about_bootloaders_heres_the/)

ADB - Android Debug Bridge, allows you to send commands through USB, it’s like Fastboot, but it works over the OS. ADB is also used by Developers to Test Apps, you can also push or pull files using it. 


____

Okay, you’re rooted, now what? What can you do? 

1) Rooted Apps

2) Custom Kernel

3) Custom ROMs

4) Turn your phone into a Live Grenade. &lt;- For Advanced users only.


1) Rooted Apps - 

These apps give you abilities non-rooted apps can’t. Like Gesture Controls, Turning on the Phone by just Swiping the Screen, Getting rid of Ads, etc


AndroidPolice made an excellent list of Apps that need Root. - [Link](http://www.androidpolice.com/topics/features-2/best-apps-for-rooted-users-series/)

The apps I use are - AdAway, GMD Gesture Control, AutoFlasher, Goo Manager, Titanium Backup and Greenify.

Always remember - Giving root access to app will give it access to do EVERYTHING. This can be dangerous if you download random apps from the Internet. Never download apps from 4Shared or something like that.

2) Custom Kernel - 

Kernels are the bridge between your Hardware and Software. Having Custom Kernels CAN give you cool features, better battery life, better performace, and customization abilities to change low level values. 

Features like BLN - Which will turn on your Button Backlight when you get a notification. Turning on the phone by Swiping the screen. Changing the colour preset. Changing audio quality.  And in your case, turning the HTC Logo into a Button. 


It’s best to get a well known Custom Kernel and not fuck around too much with the settings for a beginner. There are a lot of kernels, with a lot of different stuffs, you just need to find the one that suits your usage.

When you install a Custom Kernel, NO NEED TO WIPE FUCK ALL. They’ll tell you to Wipe Dalvik Cache, doesn’t matter. Only partition affected is /boot, which has nothing to do with dalvik-cache or cache.

3) Custom ROMs- Think of them as Linux Distros. They're built on Android, however they have additional features that enhance user experience. Custom ROMs give you all kinds of cool shit. 

Ranging from better stability, battery life and simple additional features, to cool mind blowing features that may not be as stable, yet fun. 

Again, lots of Custom ROMs, just pick the one you think is right. Experiment. You need to WIPE /data, /cache and dalvik-cache. If you’re updating your ROM, just wipe dalvik-cache, unless told otherwise. 

Some ROMs don't have GApps (Propitiatory, Closed Source, Google Apps like the Play Store that are essential) inbuilt, for those, you'll need to flash the GApps zip separately. 

Custom ROMs come with their own kernel, so if you want a Custom Kernel with a Custom ROM, flash the kernel after the ROM.


I currently use Paranoid Android as my Custom ROM, they provide stability and really cool features. You’ll find Custom Kernels and ROMS from XDA


Well known Custom ROMs are - Cyanogenmod, Android Revolution HD (They are Sense Based however), AOKP, and Paranoid Android. 

4) Turning your phone into a Live Grenade (Warning: Advanced Hackery Ahead)

Tips and Tricks - 

Always do a NANDroid Backup of your Stock ROM from your Custom Recovery before flashing a ROM, in case something goes wrong.


WARNING- Never flash ANYTHING if you don't have enough battery! Make sure that there is atleast 25% battery before flashing. If the battery dies during the flashing/ backup/ restore process, it may cause severe issues that MAY brick your device.


Go to Developer Settings, if not there, go to About Phone and tap on Build Number until you get a Toast Notification saying “You’re now a Developer!”. 

There are a total of 3 things you need to set from 1x to .5x -

Window Animation Scale

Transition Animation Scale

Animator Duration Scale

After setting them to .5x it felt a bit weird, but everything was much faster, and now I've gotten really used to it and 1x seems very slow.
Not all phones are as fast, and the animations actually kinda cover up the processing that goes while opening an app. But this can work well in decently fast phones.


Easter Egg - Tap on Android Version in About Phone repeatedly for something cool and then tap on that too.

All this is a bit overwhelming in the beginning with all this jargon, but once you get used to it, you’ll learn to set up your device to unleash its potential. 


I may have missed some things, or something might be incorrect, please do comment, and I'll edit the post. Some of the information above may not apply to some devices.

1367502508.0	1djtab	My take on S4 and HTC One after some time of owning both.	fahren	1717	508	530	"I would like to share my opinion on both phones, as I figured out there aren't many simultaneous owners of both models. Hopefully someone will find it helpful.
In fact I've owned HTC One for over 1 month already. I was using it entire April, and 6 days ago I bought S4 i9505 (qualcomm), and since then I keep comparing both - buying and playing with smartphones is kind of a hobby for me I guess.

Ok, so let's go:

***

### **Hardware (case)**

Obviously H1 is aluminium, and S4 is plastic. To my surprise, I actually prefer to hold S4 because it's considerably lighter (perhaps it's just the weight balance, not the weight figure itself). Also somehow S4 lies in my palm more comfortably (more rounded corners?) and - what's a killer thing to me - I have less problems using it with just one hand than HTC One.

On the negative side, the buttons at the bottom of S4 are IMO poorly located; I hit the back button with my palm quite often, and pressing the home button is not comfortable.

So, to my very surprise, despite the ""premium quality"" of H1 build, I actually prefer S4 when it comes to the build/box, just because it lies more comfortably in my palm.

Also, S4 has full RGB notification led, which is also quite big, while HTC One has a tiny two color dot, and applications can use only one color: green. So the S4's notification led is way more useful. Also, Light Flow works just fine on S4, and doesn't work correctly on HTC One.
 
***

### **Display**


It's a tough call IMO. I definitely prefer colors and brightness on the HTC One; the white is actually yellowish on S4, no matter which display profile settings I try, and even at maximum brightness it's nowhere as bright as H1.

But on the other hand, those two phones have almost identical sizes as far as I am concerned, and yet S4 has considerably bigger display, which in my opinion is a huge win (for S4). Thanks to that, I can use smaller fonts on S4 than on H1, and still see everything easily, what means I can see more data at once on the S4 screen than on H1.

Also, I really love the very thin left/right bezels on the S4. On H1 the bezels are quite huge, and thus the display seems (in comparison to S4) ""limited"", surrounded around by black blocks. Quite a different feeling as far as I am concerned, S4 being much nicer here.

I believe adjusting to uglier colours is easier than giving up really pleasing bezel and bigger screen. I guess when (provided I will) I stop using H1, and thus I won't be comparing the colours every few hours and seeing how ugly the whites on S4 are, the S4 won't have any considerable negatives anymore. So again, to my surprise (I traditionally preferred IPS displays, never liked AMOLEDs), so far I prefer the S4 display to the H1' one.

***

### **Software/UI**


UI on HTC One is much, much smoother than on S4. I guess there's some bug in touchwiz that causes occasional UI jerkiness which simply is not perceivable on the HTC One. I owned Nexus 4 before HTC One, and UI on HTC One is IMO smoother than on the Nexus. That's quite an achievement.
The worst part on S4/Touchwiz is opening/closing applications (returning to the launcher). Very often those animations are jerky, just as the phone was capable of only 5 fps or so. And I'm not using the stock launcher - I'm using Nova launcher (on both phones).

That said, I disabled those animations in the Developer options (Window, Transition and Animator animation/duration scale) and pretty much I have no problems with S4 anymore (but of course I don't have opening/closing animations anymore as well ;). As I wrote, I suppose it's either some bug in touchwiz that's causing it, or some general problem in Android 4.2 (maybe some garbage collector issue, resulting in more frequent global pauses?)

Another strange lag on S4 is when I'm trying to unlock the screen with pattern lock. Sometimes (quite often I would say) when I wake up the device using the power button, the pattern shows, I'm trying to unlock the screen, and.. nothing happens. I repeat the unlocking pattern, and only then it works. It seems as if the display was not accepting touch input for a short moment after waking up. This is not the case on HTC One, I can unlock the screen instantly there after waking up the screen.

Otherwise, the only Touchwiz feature I'm using are the quick toggles in the notification area. Those are missing on the HTC One, and I find them really helpful (especially for disabling/enabling screen rotation - using a widget on the home screen is way more uncomfortable for that).

I'm not using any other Touchwiz specific features, though I can see how Multiwindow could be occasionally useful.

One - huge to me - advantage of the S4 software is that it doesn't link the Notification and Ringer volumes. I can set the ringer to be really loud, and notifications to be very quiet. Not possible on the HTC One. This is quite a big advantage of the S4 as far as I am concerned at the moment.

That said, soon enough there will be Cyanogenmod available for both phones, so I wouldn't put too much weight to the software differences if I was in the market for either phone.

***

### **Battery**


Yet again to my surprise, so far it seems my HTC One has slightly better battery life than S4. Most of the battery on S4 is eaten by the screen, somehow H1 manages to conserve battery better there. Also H1 has some fine power saving options built in (like disabling data transfer after some time).
I expected the opposite, as S4 sports 2600mAh, while H1 only 2300mAh. The difference is not huge, a few hours more on H1 so far, both phones comfortably make it through full day (24 hours).

***

### **Speakers**


No contest here. HTC One is worlds better, in a different ballpark, nothing really to compare here. I can hear H1 ringing while I'm a few rooms away, and S4 is like a typical phone with speakers on the back; not really loud and kind of muted.

***

### **Camera**


Again, tough call. Generally I would say I prefer the S4 camera, because at good light it's simply much better than the H1 one, and at low light situations I can use burst mode on S4, select the sharpest picture, and later scale it down to 4MP eleminating some noise in the process, while making it even sharper.
I definitely prefer Point of View on H1 - it's simply wider, 28mm for H1 and 31mm for S4. Optical image stabilization on H1 is also nice, but honestly, those low light pictures still are far away from being usable for me - from either camera - when compared to any recent APS-C/Full Frame sensor. I'm also quite into the photography, so I can't really stand bad quality pictures ;)


***

That's it.
I hope I won't start any flame wars here. It's just my honest opinion, I couldn't care less which model ""wins"", and I have zero brand loyalty to Samsung and/or HTC. 
My plan is to use S4 exclusively for a week or two now, and then decide. So far I'm rather inclining towards S4, as I believe software issues will be fixed either by Samsung or by Cyanogenmod, and I really like the bigger screen (in roughly the same sized box) + it's more comfortable to hold in my palm ;)"	t5_2qlqh	True

The reason was because I had created a custom boot animation proposing to my girlfriend.

After a ton of help and great suggestions I finally got it to work perfectly. I was even contacted by Google about the Glass idea! It never took off, but that was so cool to even recieve a message about it.

1. No more multitasking support?! What are they doing? What I mean is I will be navigating, will go over to Pandora. When I touch the navigation app to get back to my route map, it takes me to the set a destination screen! Does not allow me to get back to my current route map. If I touch the notification bar icon, it does the same thing! Once I'm at the damn set a destination screen, if I press back or any other button, it takes me to a blank map!? I am SO mad about this. 

2. Why does it lag? The previous version didn't lag a bit! I'm using a GNEX, very clean, no excess garbage on it. There is a very noticeable judder whenever I touch and move the map around. 

3. Avoid toll roads used to work fine - I just got off the freeway because it took me to a toll road even though it would not before. OK seriously, this is ridiculous. 

I will think of more things and will update this as I continue to use this damn thing... I just don't understand how they can release an 'update' which is a downgrade. Uhhg. And sorry for typos/formatting, typing on phone from side of the road.

Update: uninstalled / reinstalled, cleared data / cache. The toll roads thing seems to be fixed, its not giving me the toll route anymore. 

2. To replicate the multitasking issue: use the navigation arrow app rather than Google maps icon. It does not happen with the maps icon, which I'm obviously going to use from now on. 

3. Lag... Not fixed at all lol. 

Edit again: got it on my Nexus 10. This is what I think is agreed upon to be a top of the line tablet. All stock. Lag is still present and very noticeable. If you'd like to compare performance, test Google maps vs. Google earth. The performance used to be similar. Now Earth is buttery smooth still, while Maps is a lagfest. "	t5_2qlqh	True

Captain_Biscuit	1757	622	318	"This is one of those things that starts as a minor annoyance and steadily drives you more and more insane until something inside you snaps and you set fire to an orphanage full of puppies in a fit of software-fueled rage. Or something.

I'm a big fan of swipe keyboards but when I first used them I noticed that by default they wouldn't recognise words like 'fuck', 'shit' etc. Not a big problem, you'd just add the word to the dictionary and then it's all yours to swear away as much as you like. 

A minor annoyance, but I guess I understand why. No software dev wants a bunch of enraged parents bollocking them for enriching their kids' vocabulary, after all.

However, along came Google's own swipe-enabled 4.2 keyboard. Now I personally think this is on of the best keyboards available now. I like it more than Swiftkey, Touchpal, Swype or anything else I've tried - it's a little lacking in options but the swiping is superb.

However, the 4.2 keyboard has a particularly dumb way of dealing with things. It *recognises* swear words, but doesn't let you swipe them. Which means you have the option of breaking your nice swipey flow mid-sentence to type out a word manually. 
There is an unintuitive little workaround, which is to add your words manually to the dictionary, but if you want to swipe swear words like you would any other, you have to jump through hoops.

And the worst part? Some of the words that are blocked are legitimate, innocent words that happen to have alternate meanings, like '**suck**' and '**screw**'. I'm sorry, but that just takes the pass.


The one keyboard I've tried that should be singled out for praise is Keymonk. The dictionary is absolutely huge and contains just about every expletive you could ever hope for. Good work guys.

Anyone come across particularly stupid examples of words that get blocked? 
Is there a better way of dealing with it? What the hull is wrong with a ducking checkbox in the options that says 'filter profanities'?"	t5_2qlqh	True

Most of my collection is in V0 or 320 CBR *.mp3 format.

For the past year or so, Music Manager failed to upload them because of the format, but it looks like they now allow it.  All files that are not in 320 CBR format are auto-converted by Google Music, but I thought this might be good news for people who have bought a lot of music through iTunes.

One of my ideas was an App of the Week that would be placed within the sidebar somewhere for one week. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/iafdj/developer_slightly_disappointed_with_the_small/) post kind of pushed me to make that idea materialize.

To begin I was thinking as a threshold rule that the developer, or at least one member of the development team **must** be a redditor.

These are the biggest pros and cons I see thus far.

**PRO**

* Promotes apps that otherwise wouldn't get much traffic

* Aids fellow redditors

* May help others discover new apps

* Creates an interactive and dynamic element of the subreddit



**CON**

* May appear as if /r/Android favors one developer/app over another

* There is always the possibility of people ""gaming"" the system we set up

* Choosing apps of the week would either need to be random or by merit. The former process would be faster but less quality apps may end up being the App of the Week. The latter would be longer but then  the process would be longer and there would need to be app evaluators.

Google Maps	yomama84	1736	659	328	"I use maps everyday.  Everyday!  Driving to work in the mornings and class in the afternoons.  It has saved me dozens and dozens of hours of sitting in traffic because I know what my journey is like up ahead.  There are a lot of things I love about the Maps app, but there are a few things that I hate in the app. 

**Problem 1** - In the morning when I click the navigate button in Google Now to navigate to work, the nav app just takes me directly to the route it chooses.  Sometimes this route is longer with more traffic, longer travel time, etc.  

**The Fix** - Why can't you just show me a list of routes that I can take with estimated time, miles, etc as soon as you load everything up.  This way, I don't have to go into the settings to choose routing options because you chose a bad route.

**Problem 2** - When you're driving and there is an accident, emergency notice, etc, a really small *'caution'* sign pops up on the route.  You'd never see it if you don't actually look for it.  When you zoom in to the 'caution' sign, you can click on it to display whatever it has to say about what's up ahead.  Very helpful stuff.  But, if i'm driving, I really shouldn't have to look at my navigation screen to see if there is a sign, then zoom in to click it, then read the notice.  This is very dangerous if you ask me.

**The Fix** - How about we use that nifty text-to-voice function and alert the driver of this notice.  Example: (Driver is on route, and a notice pops up about his route) -**bing bong**- *'alert, blah blah blah'*.  While currently you can turn voice direction off, it would be better to have 2 options.  Turn all voice direction off or turn voice off except for notices.  This way, you can use the nav for daily commute without the constant *""turn left, fly right""* but hear necessary info about accidents, closures, etc.

I just did 2 problems even though there are more.  I want to hear you guys chiming in too.  We should all stick with the formatting that I used (**Problem #, The Fix**).  Please refrain from complaining without offering a solution to the problem.  I'll update this post with the popular 'problem and fixes' so that hopefully a Googler sees these post and maybe use our ideas.


We could call this weekly segment (Tuesdays?), ""Fix That App: App name"".  Or offer a less corny name for this segment.  

**Teardown Tuesdays** by Jamma27

**Redditors suggestions**

**Problem:** Speed limit signs, all major GPS systems like a GARMIN nuvi for example has the speed limit posted on the bottom of the screen as you navigate. The data is out there and I'm sure google can afford it

**Fix:** Add this feature to google maps

**Problem** - Navigation history is useless and appears to be about 10 places

**The Fix** - Why does this have such a small limit? I should get a list of at least the last 100 places to scroll through. And it should be a list that's viewable by ""Region,"" ""Date,"" ""Distance,"" ""Contacts,"" etc

**Problem** - Can't navigate to contacts' places by voice

**The Fix** - I should be able to say, ""Navigate to John Doe's Work""

**Problem** - Cannot change how far in advance you're alerted about turns

**The Fix** - You should be able to make it alert you earlier if you want. Sometimes it alerts me so late, I miss the turn.

**Problem** - Cannot change number of times it alerts about turns

**The Fix** - I should be able to add more alerts. For example, on a highway, I could do an alert at 2 miles, 1 mile and 1/2 mile.

**Problem** - Cannot customize screen

**The Fix** - I should be able to customize what shows up on the screen. For example, maybe I want to see the upcoming turn and a satellite view along with current speed.

**Problem** - Selecting No tolls everytime

**The Fix** - Remember my settings. If I choose ""No tolls"" keep that until I change it

**Problem** - Cannot add multiple destination on a trip

**The Fix** - add option to include multiple destinations throughout trip

**Problem:** If you select public transit/driving for directions to work/home, it will ONLY use that mode of transportation. Leads getting bus directions to train stations when people actually drive to stations, etc.

**The Fix:** Allow us to pick which part of the commute is driving and which part is mass transit."	t5_2qlqh	True

1353797026.0	13qe7r	Alright Google - Why don't we have proper offline mapping?	oreography	1678	631	322	"This is the biggest disadvantage of google navigation as far as I'm concerned. When I heard earlier in the year that offline mapping was coming I was really excited. Having offline maps is fantastic for travelling, and would save me from using a third party solutions like sygic, which I currently use since data connections aren't cheap in my country. Sygic lets me download all of New Zealand for GPS and so I'm not stuck using all my data. However what we got was sub par. Downloading barely more than a city with the inability to even search maps. It's pathetic really, and barely even useless if you can't even search your downloaded maps offline. 

Now contrast this with Nokia Drive on windows phone. You can download entire countries - you could download the entire world offline to your phone and travel anywhere with it. Full offline GPS support. This is Nokia's biggest advantage as far as anyone who travels is concerned. In much of the world data connections are awful and to have fantastic mapping support without being able to use it to its full extent seems pretty poor. I'll be in Sri Lanka for Christmas and will have to get a local sim card and pay for expensive 3G to use google maps. Sygic doesn't offer Sri Lankan maps and using google maps won't be cheap. In Paris it was easier to use the trip advisor app as it came with the ability to search offline for landmarks , than to use the ""offline"" google maps to find my way around. 

If google really want to be king of mapping solutions then this is its achilles heel. It's really making Windows Phone look appealling to me, and I say that as an android lover. "	t5_2qlqh	True

Before I get to a spiel, Play Store link is above, trailer link is below, and under that are instructions to unlock all game modes without buying the in-app purchase (yay, free).

[Hazard Rush - Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=a3SZthQa-7U)

**To unlock everything free:** On the menu, just hit the smiley face (credits) and hold tap the logo until it makes a noise. That unlocks the full version.

Anyway, Hazard Rush took me far too long to make. As my first app/game/thing released for public consumption, I focused on (some) polish and not being overwhelmingly shit. So, tepid, mediocre. Thankfully this is only a hobby (in between my glorious life of paying rent, working, and studying) so any criticism is welcomed.

I hope you enjoy the game! Please post your high scores. :)

**EDIT: Thanks for the positive response guys, didn't expect that! Some additional things:**

1. I got a handful of inboxes asking what scores are good. [Here's some of my high scores](http://i.imgur.com/LrLCqho.png).

2. After the response here, I'm thinking of changing the monetisation method from an iAP to get the full game, to simply free with in-game currency for upgrades/power-ups etc (maybe using the multipliers you pick up as currency). Along with implementing some of the suggested features. Thoughts? Is that something people would consider putting money into?

3. How do people feel about a competition with a prize for the top high score in a mode?

* **Tablet optimization** (dual-pane mode) in pro version
* Rewritten mostly from scratch over hundreds of hours to take advantage of ActionBarSherlock and compatibility libraries. This means **Action Bar support** for all Android versions from 1.6 and up.
* 2.0 is not currently open source. I've already messaged all the contributors on github to let them know that I have not reused any of their GPL code for 2.0. If I decide to open source it down the line, it will be something like Apache License 2.0 and definitely not GPL.

Anyway I hope you all enjoy the new version, I'm sure there are still plenty of changes to make, but I feel it's now in a stable enough state to release.

**EDIT2:** Well, I haven't really responded to the comments here yet but I have responded to all emails and fixed the top bugs, now included in 2.0.1:

* FIXED: ""next"" button not showing up and not going to page 2
* FIXED: refreshing too often

1347880761.0	100nbm	Today marks 3 weeks since Google pulled Reddit Sync from the store	ljdawson	1819	783	345	"Hi everyone, thought I'd give a little progress update since my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ywd81/reddit_sync_has_been_removed_from_google_play/).

Google Play support got in touch and explained that the reason the app was pulled was for using reddit in the title and looking official. They then asked for written permission from reddit and requested that if I added ""unofficial"" to the app description.

I forwarded back permission directly from reddit, agreed to add unofficial to the description and then heard nothing…

So this is where it stands and I have no idea how to proceed from here. Part of me wonders if this is the usual length of time these things take or if the app has just been buried. 

Thanks for all the help and support,

Laurence

I went to the post office to pick up my package that contained my new phone. I was given a HTC Sensation BLACK by a relative on the other side of the country. It may have been used condition, didn't bother me. I was just really happy to get a phone with more internal memory than my desire. Picked up the package, on the bus home i saw a man who looked to be in his teens. He looked like an average person, but he was using a HTC Gratia with a smashed up screen. I had already factory reset my phone as i wasn't going to use it anymore, thought of selling it but doing this felt much better. I handed him my phone and told him to enjoy it at the same time as the bus stopped on my stop. I feel like an anonymous hero, you're the first peeople i have told today reddit. I'd like to thank Shen Ye for inspiring me to do this, i know my desire wasn't much. But i really hope that made him smile, as he was too shocked so he didn't say much. Thank you reddit!! I think i made someones day today and it feels GREAT!

EDIT : The phone was unlocked, i can't get a contract. So i bought my desire unlocked when i first got it, his sim will work.

They consistently produce new, useful, *substantiated* content. I don't see many other android journalists (or even other journalists in other fields) do as fantastic of a job as you guys do.

The APK teardowns, fantastic sources of information. Don't see others doing this. You don't just post ""Oh boy i think this is happening rumor rumor rumor."" You go through the code line by line to see what it could mean. That's dedication.

Every week, the ""x apps of the week."" Awesome! What a great way to find apps. Original reviews, insightful and honest opinions, I love it!

All other general news. Always original content. Rarely do I see recycled ""this rumor happened"" and ""this is coming out"" like I do from literally every other blog. 

Getting to know Android x.x.x. Perfect. Probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever.

Basically, what I'm trying to say, is thank you so much for putting out *actual content.* Thank you for not trying to get pageviews from ""hot"" titles and ""latest rumors!"" Thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post.

LitRes.ru is one of the largest Russian legit online libraries.

In the comments a suggestion was made to give LitRes's applications (they are horrible by the way) low ratings in retaliation, and [it is working](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.litres.android). However, I find it troubling that *Google* would block an application for simply supporting a standard.

You've just spent enormous amounts of time and energy into crafting an app for the public, and you'd like some sort of indication as to how the market has received it. 

**In-app pop-ups and constant reminders throughout the app are not the correct way to handle this.**

I'm aware that I don't necessarily share the same mindset as other developers, but in my experience, I let my software projects and apps speak for themselves. As long as I make sure my app does what it says and provides a great experience for the user, I don't *need* to do any marketing - it'll market itself.

As a heavy Android user, I can testify to this - I rarely download apps because of their rating in the Play Store. I usually do some research, end up downloading an app because a friend has recommended it, or  download it because I've read about it online.

Two apps that constantly behave like this this are ROM Manager and Reddit Sync.

I'm not sure whether it has anything to do with the fact that I follow the subreddit, but even after purchasing Reddit Sync Pro, I still feel as if the developer is constantly reminding me to rate his app. Two things have resulted because of this:

1. I've rated both of the Reddit Sync apps with 1-star, as this behavior has interrupted my own enjoyment of the app, and I do not wish to encourage this behavior.
2. I was the first of my college [redditor] friends to adopt Android, and after having to make a tough call between 'reddit is fun' and 'Reddit Sync', I ended up choosing 'reddit is fun', mostly because I quickly became tired of the 'Reddit Sync' developer's mindset to gather as many ratings as he could. As a result, I now recommend 'reddit is fun' to all my friends, and any other redditors I encounter who use reddit. 

Until developers discard the mindset that they need ratings and constant in-app reminders for users, I will continue recommending alternative apps to friends of mine (and the readers of the sites I write for), as well as giving them low ratings in the market.

EDIT: Those who are defending developers who allow a ""Never Appear Again"" option on their rating pop-ups have clearly missed the point of this post - if you've developed your app well enough that it does what it is supposed to (and possibly even more), you shouldn't ever need to ask for ratings.

For example, Google apps: Sure, they're made by Google, but they're some of the highest rated apps in the market because they're fantastic at doing what they're supposed to. Google doesn't need to ask users (even if it is only once) to rate their apps. (I can list a dozen more non-Google examples if anyone is interested.)"	t5_2qlqh	True

1339449558.0	uws3q	The iOS 6 announcement is killing me!	plazman30	1816	859	1390	"I will admit that I am a huge Apple fanboy.  But, for my phone I chose Android.  I do own an iPad, and 2 Macs, so I have my fair share of Apple branded devices in the house.

So, I am watching the liveblog of the iOS 6 announcement.  And the other fanboys are killing me.

Apple finally introduces a maps application that is on-par with the Android one and everyone screaming like this is something revolutionary.

Then I see VIP.  VIP is pretty much Priority Inbox.  Had that for a while on Android.

Next they start touting how iMessage is awesome and how you can reply to an iMessage on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.  And I see that and I say to myself that I've been doing that with Google Voice for over 2 years now, except I can do it on my PC, my Android phone, my Mac, my Linux laptop, my iPad and pretty much any other device I ever buy.

Then they show the new answer call screen where you can reply via text or send a reminder.  Now I know that send a reminder is new, but I know I have run ROMs on my phone that had a reply via text option.  Again not seeing anything new here.

I'm sure all these ""new"" features will be polished and made to be smooth as butter.  One of things people say about Apple is that it doesn't get it first, but it does get it right.  And I do agree with that.

I do like iOS a lot.  I bought an iPad.  But I really think Apple needs to go fix core OS components like Notification Center.  It might be because I am an Android user, but I never check notification center, because there is no visible notification that there is anything in the notification center (isn't that statement quite ironic).

Ok, my rant is done.  Thanks for hearing me out.

**EDIT:** Ok, if Apple had just come out and said, here are our new features, then I would be OK with it.  What rubs me the wrong way is how they take digs at Android first, and then proceed to show you a bunch of features that the OS you just attacked has had for a while."	t5_2qlqh	True

1342362133.0	wldhm	With the assistant-like improvements in jelly bean, it is now absolutely essential that Google integrate their Tasks functionality into Android.	mattrition	1353	414	122	"Jelly bean has introduced some amazing ways to interact with our phones. Specifically, I'm talking about the automated functionality of Google now and the assistant-like styling of their voice search on top of that. Google have laid a very solid foundation to improve on. But, yes, their are some glaring holes in the interaction that just don't sit well with me.

Today I suddenly realised I needed to renew my TV license at some point in the week ahead. I whipped out my phone and eagerly spoke into it ""Remind me to renew my tv license tomorrow"". I expected this to initiate some sort of half-completed calendar form where I could specify the exact time etc. Instead it started setting an alarm. I really don't want an alarm going off randomly in the day to remind me of tasks. This kind of thing is definitely better suited to notifications. But I also realise why this type of action is not well suited to a calendar appointment.  Appointments happen over a period of time, for example from 10.00 to 11.00, whereas you would only want to be reminded to do something at a precise time in the day, for example at 10.00 exactly.

But there is something that slots very nicely in between the two. [Google Tasks](https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/) is a to-do list of items that can have an optional due date or reminder, allowing them to integrate perfectly into Google Calendar. Setting a task that reminds me to renew my TV license on Thursday makes perfect sense and should be exactly what voice search does with the ""Remind me to"" type of voice interaction.

In summary, this highlights how important it is that Google picks their Tasks suite back off the ground and integrates it into Android. I don't even mean creating an official app. It should ideally be part of the Calendar app, just like it is on the web app. I currently use the Gtasks app, which syncs great with Google Tasks. But the integration with Google Now and voice search is just not there, and as far as I know Google have no plans to open up these APIs (which would also be cool).

TL;DR: You know when voice search sets an alarm when you ask it to remind you about something? It should be adding that reminder to [Google Tasks](https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/), where Tasks itself is integrated into Android.

**EDIT:** The lack of task management in the Calendar app has been a hot topic for a few years now. Feel free to star the [issue about it on the bug tracker](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3705)."	t5_2qlqh	True

Anyhow my first payment from Google Wallet failed resulting in the error message: ""You have no valid forms of payment.

Payments will not resume until this information is updated."" problem is I cannot add a new card as I get the error ""Unexpected Error when processing this"" tried on multiple PC's on different internet connections with the same error.

I have contacted Google about 5 times, 3 times on the phone twice emailing with no replies to emails, when I call them they tell me they are emailing a specialist, the specialist never gets back. 

I have a feeling this months payout will fail on the 15th, without this payout I'll be homeless as I need these payouts to survive and Google owes me a lot of money.

I have no options now, Google won't fix their service or get back to me. I can't access my own money, can any of you guys help me out I'm really desperate now.

*Edit*
I'm based within the UK.

*Update*
Ok so I figured it out, the payment information errors when you don't enter enough digits in the account number, the default UK bank account number is 8 digits; Google accepts only greater than 10, so I just entered empty spaces and vala! The test deposit works and the error message clears, still waiting too see if I get paid though will let you guys know.

*Update*
I can confirm that Google have paid me for this month.

The guy I talked to was very helpful and friendly. I told him what happened and he said that it was showing I only went over my limit by 2gb (odd, considering what youtube was telling me it used on the data usage monitor) and that he would just credit me for the 2gb of data. 

Problem solved!


Thanks for the suggestions everyone, I'm going to make sure to configure a data cap in those settings in the future. 



[A pictorial guide of this whole fucked up incident](http://imgur.com/a/wRpcP)

I have no idea what happened. This evening I was driving across town to meet a friend. I was streaming music from my Rdio app while I was driving.

As I neared the place I was meeting him, I got a text from ATT mentioning that my data limit had been 65% used up (billing cycle ends in 2 days, great, I'll be under my 3gb limit this month!) 

A minute or so later, my phone went off again, and then again a couple minutes later, and continued doing it until I was in the parking lot, at which point I checked the phone to see what all the messages were about. 

Turns out for some reason my Youtube app decided to just go ahead and blow through almost 7 gigabytes of data *without playing a single video*! 


I thought possible something went horribly wrong with my youtube preload settings, but checked those and it seems pretty clear that the phone will only preload videos when the phone is on WiFi *and* plugged in. 


Not one or the other, *both*.

 I don't even know what to *do* about this now... It just put me several gigs (i.e. $10 in overages per gigabyte over 3) over my data limit.

Who do I even call in this case? AT&amp;T? do I have any chance getting this removed from my bill?  Totally ruined my night.


**EDIT** : since everyone's commenting on it, I assure you, my connection speed averages 3-4mbps . I have absolutely no idea how my phone was even capable of this. I have to wait for YouTube videos to buffer just like the rest of you

Update: As 1880 stated "" Please DO NOT comment on the issue. Just find the star on the top and click it. Spamming the issue with comments is very annoying for the developers and is not used a measure to prioritize bugs. Stars are.""

Update2: As Zikes stated:
After starring, you can disable email notifications for comments at https://code.google.com/hosting/settings.

Edit: So Apparently there is a lot of demand for this feature. I please ask as 1880 stated only leave a comment on the developers site if you have ""Constructive"" criticism. All that is necessary is starring the issue (top left corner). Thanks everyone for your support and interest in this feature. Maybe Google will listen, chances are not, but you never know.

1364258359.0	1b0e79	Why the plastic vs aluminum debate is filled with misinformation.	Hunt3rj2	1705	778	438	"Every so often, there is always a debate in this subreddit about this exact question. So far, it seems that the dominant discourse here is that plastic is clearly better in function, and thus arguments favoring a metal unibody are basically summed up with ""form over function"". Some choice threads on this can be found here: ( http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1acbc8/galaxy_s_4_vs_htc_one_quick_comparison/c8wivuv?context=3 ), (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ah7n7/weekend_poll_htc_one_or_galaxy_s4/c8xp9ev?context=3)

While this is only what I have encountered, this is far from the only cases of this sort of debate. So without further riffraff:

1. Plastic is not magically different from metal in how it protects the phone from drops. The difference boils down to yield points (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_%28engineering%29) and ductile vs brittle materials. Both are going to absorb shock just the same. The real difference is the resulting difference. Plastic is going to scratch easier because it is softer, but most of these scratches are going to be much harder to notice because the plastic can be colored the same all the way through. Metal won't scratch as much, but scratches will be much more noticeable, no question about it. When it comes to actual drops, metal has a lower yield point, so there will be more permanent denting/bending, but plastic will have gashes, dents, chips, and possible cracks, especially if you drop it on something nasty like broken concrete/asphalt. The difference is that plastic is brittle in behavior, and metal is ductile.

2. Yes, plastic is RF transparent, metal is not. However, it comes to proper engineering. Either the OEM has to make plastic RF windows, or they have to section off pieces of metal with a non-conductive material. The Transformer Prime was a case of bad engineering, pure and simple. So no, metal does not affect reception unless the OEM screws it up.

3. Yes, plastic tends not to feel as cold or as hot, but this can be a double-edged sword. Because plastic has higher heat capacity, this means that it will stay at a temperature longer than the metal phone. On the flip side, metal can get hot much more quickly, which can be uncomfortable in the hand. This is a question of personal preference.

That's all I had to say here. Hope this helps to clear up misconceptions and helps when it comes to questions of industrial design and functionality.

It's billed as an aggregator for Facebook/Twitter/Foursquare/etc and when you first install it you sign in through facebook and it asks you to select some people from your facebook list that you ""want to be friends with"", which I did. No mention of what that meant or what it would do with that list anywhere in sight which I guess should have been a warning.

First it emailed all of them telling them that they should join path. Somewhat annoying, but after the fact I figured I should have expected that.

Last night though, in the middle of the night it decided to send a ton of my friends text messages that say ""bcore wants to share private pictures with you on Path, visit this link to see them: http://some.url""

Now I've got an inbox full of people who are either annoyed that I disturbed them in the middle of the night or worried that my phone got hacked.

EDIT: I want to be clear here, I'm not complaining about emailing people I select (that's what lots of services do) or accessing my contact list (I was aware that I gave it permission to do so). I'm complaining that it sent SMS to people I selected without being explicit that it was going to do that. In my eyes an app should -never- send texts on your behalf unless it explicitly asks you. Especially not spammy ones that tell people you want to ""share private pictures"" with them. Incidentally I will add that I have not taken any pictures with Path or uploaded any to it, so there were no ""private pictures"" to be shared.

1367280400.0	1ddj2a	Why are Google's apps consistently better-looking on iOS than they are on Android?	D14BL0	1462	541	513	"Google Now just got released on iOS, and I've been playing with it on my iPod, and the interface is significantly nicer than it is on Android. Not only is it way more responsive on iOS than it's ever been on any Android device I've touched, it's got a much better interface combining the ""Google Search"" with the Now cards. Even small little nuances like swiping a card away has a better animation in the iOS app than it does on Android.

Same with Gmail. It looks leaps and bounds better in iOS than it does on Android. Same with Drive, Google+, and even YouTube looks more polished. 

I'm not sure if this is a matter of Holo vs iOS's interface and creative differences between them, but it definitely feels like there's a significant lack of polish in the Android versions of Google apps, aside from the layout differences. The iOS versions tend to have better animations and visuals across the board.

Is anyone else annoyed by this? You'd think that Google would put more effort into their Android apps than iOS, especially considering that Android has a larger market share than iOS right now, and since it's their own platform. 


**EDIT:** A bunch of people asked for screenshot comparisons. I took a few from some Google Apps. I've blocked out my personal information from them, but you can definitely see a difference in the level of polish in each version of the app.

All the Android screenshots are from 4.2.2. iOS screenshots are from 6.1.3.

I just randomly stumbled into one of the apps, recognized it and noticed that the publisher wasn't who it was supposed to be.

[Super Guitar Solo](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.power.SuperSolo&amp;feature=search_result&amp;hl=en) for example is originally [Guitar Solo Lite](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.codingcaveman.SoloTrial&amp;feature=search_result&amp;hl=en). I downloaded two of the apps and extracted the APK's, they both contain what seems to be the ""rageagainstthecage"" root exploit - binary contains string ""CVE-2010-EASY Android local root exploit (C) 2010 by 743C"". Don't know what the apps actually do, but can't be good.

I appreciate being able to publish an update to an app and the update going live instantly, but this is a bit scary. Some sort of moderation, or at least quicker reaction to malware complaints would be nice.

EDIT: After ~~some dexing and jaxing~~ (where did I get these terms..) decompiling the code (with [dex2jar](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/) and [JD-GUI](http://java.decompiler.free.fr/)), the apps seem to be at least posting the IMEI and IMSI codes to http://184.105.245.17:8080/GMServer/GMServlet, which seems to be located in Fremont, CA.

EDIT2: The apps are also installing another embedded app (hidden as assets/sqlite.db), ""DownloadProvidersManager.apk"". Not sure what it does yet on top of monitoring what apps the user installs.

EDIT3: I just received a reply to an e-mail I sent out to one of the developers affected: 

""Yes, thank you, I was aware of it.  I have been trying for more than a week now to get Google to do something about it.  I've contacted them through every avenue I could think of, but haven't had a response yet...until today.  It seems the developer and all his apps have been removed from the market""

So Reddit seems to be Google's preferred customer feedback channel ;-)

EDIT4: As noted in the comments below, the developer account and the apps have been removed from the market, and the links to the apps above do not work anymore. Also I'd like to give credit to the devs at [Teazel](http://www.teazel.com/) for helping in identifying the exploit yesterday.

EDIT5: Some are asking whether something they installed and uninstalled a while back might have been one of the bad apps. According to [Lookout Mobile Security](http://blog.mylookout.com/2011/03/security-alert-malware-found-in-official-android-market-droiddream/) these malicious apps were published on two additional dev accounts on top of the one I spotted. All three accounts have been wiped from the market, but info on the apps is still available on Appbrain: [Myournet](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=myournet), [Kingmall2010](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=Kingmall2010) and [we20090202](http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=we20090202). Kingmall2010's account seems to be the oldest of the bunch, according to Appbrain it started publishing around Feb 11th. The other two around Feb 23rd. So find the app from Appbrain on those accounts and check the publishing date. As for what to do if you know you're infected - I'm hoping docgravel / Lookout can provide some insight soon. Check the comments.

EDIT6: Looking at the download counts for all three accounts on Appbrain. They're lagging behind the real counts, as they don't update daily, so when the Market's real download counts for Myournet yesterday totalled at 50k-200k, Appbrain is only totalling to 10k to 35k. Even so, adding Kingmall2010's download counts from Appbrain (48k to 224k) to those I nabbed from myournet's account on Market yesterday brings the total downloads to 98k to 424k. And that estimate is probably on the low side.

I found this out by changing the date settings on my Nexus 7 (I was messing with them to experiment with another app, and SwiftKey beta opens up a window about this when the date reaches the 23rd).

Here's a screenshot of the window that opens when it becomes the 23rd: [Window](http://i.imgur.com/oFUMtgy.png) and [Window w/ date](http://i.imgur.com/GZ7Q1UH.png)

Especially over the past couple of days. People are taking proactive steps to clean it up, but sooner or later, we are going to get sick of seeing these PSAs announcing all of the crap Devs. To counter this problem of constant posting to r/Android, I've created playstorecleanup@gmail.com, as well as a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsSLdE8Xw3kldGYyZl81cTJNR3FFNHV3UlpoX1ljU1E#gid=0) to keep track of all of these apps that you guys help report for abusing the rules of the less knowledgable. 

I'm sure a majority of you are more than easily capable of spotting these bad apps, but following are a few types of apps in particular that really irk me:

     +Improve your WiFi!

     +Fake or copy games like we've seen the last couple of days here

     +All those blasted Gangnam Style photo booth and other knock-off type apps

     +Emulators that are just absolutely and completely riddled with ads and are therefore unusable

     +WiFi 'hackers'

     +Jumping Boobs / Ass / other sex apps (c'mon guys, it's called pornhub or xvideos)

     +Cell phone signal boosters

     +Etc, etc... I'm sure you all know which apps to report here


So, if you guys think this is a good idea, please help everyone out by contributing the bad apps you find to playstorecleanup@gmail.com in the following format:

     Developer Name:

     Application Name:

     Link to Application on Play Store:

     Reason for Flagging ( Sexual content , Graphic violence, Hateful or abusive content, Harmful to device or data, Other objection):	

     If other, why?:

Every Saturday, I'll report back here with the spreadsheet, or you can just report them if you get board throughout the week, either way will work. I think this is a useful alternative to a separate subreddit, as I think creating would simply result in the same fate as many other 'sub'subreddits do.

I think this can be a really cool way to show Google how moderating their product can improve its quality, even if just ever so slightly. Let the moderation begin.

(PS: Sorry for the weird 'code' formatting. I wanted to tab for clarity and I don't know how to remove that)

The only other option is a slow death.	alreadygonewild	1303	440	405	"Seriously. I don't mean Niue, or nite, or Moore, or mote. I swyped 'now'. How are these words showing up ahead of 'now' and 'more' for that particular finger track?
  
In and Inn. Tike and time. Yiy and you. What the hell is ""Yiy"" and why do android keyboards seem to love it so?
 
I can't even find Niue on a map. Why is it the first pick **ever**, much less for the tracks that include ""now"" and ""more""?
 
This problem has been getting steadily worse with time, I assume as the dictionary is expanded more and more.
  
There is a really simple fix here. Offer a way for users to create dictionaries from scratch, or edit the stock dictionary, or just get off your asses and publish a limited dictionary that eliminates 75% of the English language that isn't used day to day, much less in texts. If you want to be fast, be fast. If you want to be well educated, be well educated, but in this case, it doesn't appear that it's possible for you to do both.

You don't even have to do the work. If you would just open this process up to your users, a call I've heard *numerous* times in the last year, we'll do it for you! Imagine, I could create or download electrical, meteorological, and aviation specific dictionaries that have tons of terms I use every day that aren't in your stock dictionary, all while not having to dodge the useless crap that it's currently regurgitating.
  
Is anybody else seeing this reduction in keyboard accuracy as keyboard projects mature? Swiftkey seems to be a particularly bad offender, though I must admit I've only tinkered with it a little bit so far. I imagine given its flexibility, there may be a fix already in place.

The solution seems so obvious. Why are devs moving away from the tried and true KISS method these days?

I love swype, but I've uninstalled it. It is no longer the fastest method. Regardless of settings, the standard android keyboard is now faster, as I don't have to spend 50% of my time entering a word for the third time because Swype choked on it and spat out something silly, with my desired word buried 4 words past the right screen edge, or increasingly often, not on the list of suggestions at all.

[video](http://youtu.be/01bKbIagIj8) (I mistakenly say i tapped into the yellow line. I pointed to the wrong wire in the video. I am tapped into the red switched line.)

Now...how I did it. First off, if you aren't comfortable [digging into your car](http://i.imgur.com/27A3M.jpg) then I don't recommend this project. I've been working on cars and installing car audio as a hobby for 7 years. You don't have to be a rocket scientist, but just be sure to read read read everything you can before you start pulling things apart. **DISCONNECT YOUR BATTERY AND PROPERLY FUSE YOUR HOT LINES** - Android cars are cool, but it's not worth frying yourself or your expensive toys. 


**Tasker**

The tablet is plugged in to a 12V ignition-switched line. It gets power while the car is on, and runs on battery when the car is off. I did this so that Tasker can determine when the car has been turned on/off. Tasker monitors for DC power or battery power. 

*  DC Power (Car on) - Turn the screen to always on, unlock the tablet, turn on audio, turn off airplane mode, start playing music from an app of choice.
*  Battery Power (car off) - Turn screen time out to 7 seconds, mute, airplane mode, shut up and go to sleep. It uses next to no power in this state. I can park the car for days.


**Signal**

I have no issues with 3G signal or GPS. Google maps is a breeze and the internet connection is solid. Also, I positioned the tablet so that the light sensor and camera are exposed. I haven't used the camera at all...but the option is there. The light sensor does a good job of dimming the screen at night.


**Mounting**

Mounting the tablet was a bit of a challenge. It's ironic because the tablet looks so solidly mounted, and it is. But, you'll laugh when I post pics of how I mounted it. I basically took a dremel and cut out the entire mounting system in the dash kit. Then I JB Welded 4 metal loops at each corner. Finally, I took a nice length of string and lashed it down. It's really quite janky, but I'm not going to mess with it because it works damn well.


**Components**

Here's a list of primary components I used. I'm not including anything in the [audio system](http://i.imgur.com/gImfN.jpg). There's plenty of guides on how to install a car stereo. But, I would be glad to answer any questions. Also, this is just notable items. 


*  [Mazda 3 Double DIN Dash Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Scosche-MA1543B-Mazda-Double-Pocket/dp/B003TSDRPU) - The double DIN standard will fit a 7 inch tablet nicely. When I say nicely I mean Tablet Physical Size &gt; Double DIN hole &gt; Tablet Screen Size. Leaves a nice little black border around the sides. **Make sure your tablet is the proper aspect ratio and screen size - 7"" screen can mean a lot of things**
*  [Samsung GT-P6200 Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-GT-P6200-7-0-dual-core-Honeycomb/dp/B00746GVME/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339090136&amp;sr=1-1) - Be warned the link actually is a GT-6200L (which is what I got). It works fine, and AT&amp;T got it working after a little grumbling.
*  [In-line Volume Control](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FPD3IS/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00) - This is currently residing under my shift stick unused. Eventually I'm going to flush mount it on the dash. I don't recommend using the screen for volume control. This is a safety issue.
*  [Charger](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DBIKOK/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00) - This little guy is quite important. Tablets require 2amps to charge. Make sure you get a charger that will put the tablet in AC charging mode. This is important both for quick charging, and also for Tasker. The device is always on, but only powered when the car is on for Tasker reasons. **Don't try to use an AC/DC inverter unless your musical tastes include AC HUMMMMMMMMMMM**
*  [Wire Harness](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006846C4A/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00) - this clips into the factory harness. I feed speaker lines, and also draw power from it. Get one of these instead of hacking up your factory harness. Because of this guy, I could have the car back to stock ready to sell in about 5 minutes (not counting the wires running to trunk...but not a big deal.)



**Current Issues**


*  Battery overheating - The battery gets too hot while sitting out in hot Kentucky summers (only when the car isnt running). I've ordered a reflective sun shield, and I hope that this will keep the dash cool enough to stop the tablet from complaining. No adverse performance issues noticed yet. I've accepted that my tablet won't live as long as others.
*  Home Screen - ADW and Launcher Pro don't seem to like tablets. It's minor issues, but kind of annoying.
*  Power Button - You'll notice there's no way to access the power switch. I thought about soldering an extension onto the power switch so I could dash mount it. I also considered drilling a hole in the dash so I could poke the switch with a pen. After I installed it I realized that a swift tug on the air vents removes them. So I decided that I need to use the power button so rarely that removing the vents was a fine solution (tasker turns the screen on and off with the car). Works for me, but I bet this will be a challenge for others.

I got a great response from Reddit in my original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11p7ht/reddit_i_just_published_my_first_android_app/). It was so positive, I wanted to institute every improvement suggested, I was really fired up by the positive ratings people left me!

**Today:** I hope I've got it right by listening to your feedback and responding with a much more polished product. I'd be honoured if you'd take version 2.0 of my app for a spin today!

My app helps you save money and meet upcoming payments by creating customized savings goals. In this update I've added robust notifications, support for multiple goals, over 65 popular currencies, bar graph indicators and virtually everything else Reddit asked for.

If you could find the time to leave a positive rating, comment, Google +1, etc. I'd appreciate it a lot! It makes the time spent well worth it.

**TL;DR** Reddit wanted new features, so I give Reddit Saving Made Simple version 2.0. I appreciate any support you can provide me in the form of a positive rating, Google +1 or comment.

- This is my personal list of useful, essential, and recommended Android apps, broken down by category. Not all of you will find these apps useful, and many of you will have other apps that you like. Keep in mind that I am only one person, and fairly technically minded at that. My phone is never used for gaming, so you won't see any games in this list.

**Note**: I rooted my phone on day one. Rooting will *most likely void your warranty* but gives you complete control over your phone. A number of the apps I am about to link will require root access and will not work without it. They will be clearly marked.

**Second Note:** Many of the apps below contain links to paid or donate versions. The prices listed are in Canadian Dollars (Unless otherwise noted), and I consider them worth the price and have purchased them all. You may not wish to or be able to, however, so the free versions will also be linked wherever they exist.

**Because of Reddit's 10,000 character limit, and the fact that my list is ~20,000 characters long, I have no choice but to break it up into two comments on this post.**

**Edit 2:** Added [QR Droid](https://market.android.com/details?id=la.droid.qr), because that app is awesome and I feel bad for forgetting it.

**Edit 3:** Thanks for all the positive feedback, everyone! I've updated the spreadsheet again:

- Removed Root Explorer (in favor of ES Explorer, which many of you have kindly pointed out *is capable* of using 
root too)
- Added [AdAway](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.adaway) as an open source alternative to AdFree. Thanks to the people who brought this to my attention!
- Added [Pure Grid Calendar Widget](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.koxx.pure_grid_calendar)
- Added [Any.Do](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.anydo) To-Do List
- Added [PowerAMP](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer) Music Player

I'm going to try and clean up the spreadsheet a bit too, using tabs for each category. That should make it easier to keep updated in the future, and make it easier for you guys to find what you're looking for.

**Edit 4:** Moar apps! 

- Added [FBReader](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android) (I also tried Moon+, but my experience with FBReader has been more positive so far)
- Added [WidgetLocker](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker) (Can't believe I forgot to include this initially)
- Added [Audiogalaxy](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.audiogalaxy) - Amazing app if you want to stream your music from home. This has replaced the iPod in my car.

The [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsIKaxCKsaL9dE1lY3I0U19oVkhWSVVMUzl6VnFnRXc) has been updated with better formatting and categories split out into tabs. Hopefully it's a little easier to find what you want now."	t5_2qlqh	True

In case you didn't know, we recently posted about our game Doodle Assault here which received a fair amount of attention here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jxdch/built_our_first_android_game_with_some_friends/

First we'd like to say we're really sorry about annoying you guys with the notification spam, and a new version was shipped yesterday morning without the nag. This was largely a misguided experiment at implementing way to increase user retention. We're just a group of students and meant no harm by it, we were just playing around with the different features of the android platform to try to grow our game. Free is a hard thing to support, and we just wanted to try everything within out power to keep the game going strong. 

We admit our mistake in not doing an extensive user test before the latest release. I've gotten some pretty brutal feedback from friends and (ex)fans, so the mistake hits close to home. We know trust is a hard thing to gain back, but we ask that those of you that are still interested in what we have to offer, that you be patient with us as we're still trying to figure out what works and what does not. We're currently focusing on making the gaming experience better using the feedback from the last reddit post, and racking our brains and artists for new content. We completely understand the 1-star ratings on the marketplace, and we wont ask you to change them. 

Lastly we'd like to thank you all for your time and feedback, even if it was negative. We take every comment to heart and we'll try our best to keep everyone happy with our game and coming back for more in the future.

-Four Hundred Games team

Nefarious-	1423	606	633	"**UPDATE:**  After reading all of the horror stories about third party vendors I called this morning to cancel my order.  I will probably go to the Verizon Corporate store.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I go to Verizon today to upgrade my Droid X original to a Galaxy Nexus.  I was looking forward to moving way up in technology as well as locking in unlimited data for the next two years on Verizon's network.  So I began my journey to the local Verizon store.  Little did I know it was also the epicenter for all the universe's retardation.  

I walk in and am greeted by an over excited phone salesman.  He comes at me with a ""Hey man, how are you man?""  Two ""man's"" in one sentence, off to a horrible start.  He asks how he can help, I tell him I am here to upgrade.  He gets way too excited and asks what phone.  I tell him I am here for the Galaxy Nexus.  He then had a look of confusion and disgust on his face.  He asks me what makes me want to upgrade to the Galaxy Nexus.  I start off by telling him I would really like to wait until the Galaxy SIII comes out but that I believe when it comes out on Verizon, they will introduce their tiered data plans and I will lose my unlimited data.  I then go on to explain I believe the Galaxy Nexus is a top phone right now and clearly the best on Verizon's network, discuss hardware, ICS, etc.

He starts off by looking at me with even more confusion and then asks ""The SIII?  That doesn't exist.  There is only an SII.""  He then turns to the owner (franchised Verizon store) and asks him if he had ever heard of it.  The owner (who couldn't be older than 30) scoffs and  says he has never heard of the SIII and Verizon always calls him to notify him of new phones two months in advance.  He then drops the line ""There is no such thing as the SIII.""  In absolute awe, I brush this off as I don't have time to get into a debate over things that exist and don't exist.

We move forward with the killing of my brain cells (and soul at this point).  The original salesman tells me they don't have any Nexus' in stock.  The first thing that comes to mind is it is their best seller.  He then tells me it was their worst selling phone and they don't keep them in stock anymore (despite being Verizon's best and most high profile phone).  He then spends the next 10 minutes trying to talk me out of it, showing me all of their other phones (spending the most time on the Casio Commando).

I then asked why they had such a grudge against the Nexus and why they didn't like it.  Their main reason blew me out of the water:  **The operating system is crap.  It is too hard to use and things aren't in the same place as they are on other phones.**  &lt;---- Holy mother of god.

I continued to bite my tongue until I told them I was going with the Nexus and they needed to order it for me and overnight it.  They did so while continuously reminding me I can ""give it a try"" and ""return it within 14 days when I don't like it.""

Absolutely blown away by this experience.  Can someone please confirm my purchase and restore my faith that I just had a bad run in with uneducated morons?"	t5_2qlqh	True

Saw the rumor about Motorola maybe making a bezel free phone and thought it would be a fun Sunday project to design my own. So I made a quick render after 2-3h of work.

I made a thin rim around it to avoid pressing the screen by mistake. And I added some more room at the top and bottom to make room for the speaker and to hold in landscape mode.

The top and bottom rim is made out of glass and has a notification LEDs that light up the whole glass.

I haven't added any power/volume buttons, headphone jack (don't know how to make that work with the glass) or micro-usb. Might also make the rim less like the iPhone (don't know how yet).

Feedback is welcome!

(Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this)

EDIT: WOW! I never thought I'd get this kind of response to this!

Even got contacted by a company that wanted to print it in a 3D printer, they were on the wrong side of to globe though...

Will continue working on this as soon as I get home from school and post an update next week or so when it is done. Thanks!

An update to Reddit News is only a day or two away. Here are some of the new features to look forward to:

* slide out menu - (not just a bezel swipe because bezel swipes are lame)
* new improved design posts
* load more comments
* multiple account support with fast switching from slide out menu
* swipe comments to go back to posts list
* new overflow context menus for posts and comments (share comment/post, copy comment text etc.)
* mark messages as read and unread in your inbox
* font size options 
* ability to post new private messages
* sidebar that can be swiped away
* youtube api support - survives rotation with hi-res thumbnails
* added ""HD"" button to picture viewer to download a higher res version when available
* double tap to zoom on picture preview plus ""HD"" button to download a higher res version if available
* mapped volume keys to next and previous comment in comments view
* added captcha when submitting posts or pm's if needed
* profile sorting option (top, year etc.)
* RN will now look in sub folders of Reddit emote folder and check that folder first before using its internal emotes
* support for np Reddit domain

Here's a [gallery](http://imgur.com/a/rYNAO) of sample screenshots. 

Some of you may have noticed that updates to Reddit News are not as frequent as they once were. It has become increasingly difficult to find time (around a full time job, family and friends) to implement all the features people want to see and have asked for. So, i've been looking at ways to create more free time to dedicate to development. One option is increasing ad revenue (free version only) to a point where i could work on it for a day or two a week.

I've investigated and/or talked with a few ad networks (not the dodgy push notification ones - it would remain a small banner ad) and it seems like adding the ""approximate location"" and ""read phone status and identity"" permissions would increase revenue enough for me to reach my goal. For those that don't know, the ""read phone status and identity"" permission allows ad networks to get a unique id to better track ad impressions while the ""approximate location"" permission results in ads based on your rough location (i.e city or town). The upshot is that targeted ads = more clicks = more revenue = more development time.

I know there is (understandable) discontent around these kinds of permissions. However, would the option of having the paid version (which has no ads and therefore no extra permissions) be sufficient to satisfy most people's concerns regarding privacy in the free version? I'd really like to hear your opinions and if the majority of people are against permissions then i won't add them.

Thanks for your support and Cheers!

**New Update:** Sorry about disappearing and not delivering. Basically, life made things difficult to continue. School, family, and my main job doing merch design got in the way of pretty much all of my projects, this one included. In the weeks after the original post, I made *some* progress, but I never got a substantial amount done. Most of them are generics, and I was never able to afford the time to learn how to compile them as an actual theme or get the play store thing set up. I am now free from classes for the time being, and I intend on creating a more polished version fit for putting on the play store soon. In the mean time, feel free to download and apply the ones I made before the wave of inconveniences stopped me.

&gt;Old Update: I've finished enough icons going in somewhat different directions. I want to give everyone a chance to play around with the handful I have finished and decide which app's icon direction is the best. In other words, find a few (or even just one) of the app icons that you'd like the rest of the set to look more like. You're almost certainly not going to like all of the icons in this update. Maybe not even half. Should I go towards making it look more like Plasmid icons? Item icons? Or continue evolving it a little separate from the main inspiration? Which one sucks the most? Be sure to let me know!

&gt;Preview: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/EZiWAgn.png).

&gt;Download: [Here](http://www.mediafire.com/?19f92lbb7a2e2re).

&gt;Also note that there are some little issues with the background and whatnot that I'm aware of. None of this is considered a finished product, think of it more like the last stage before everything gets pumped out. Also, they're 96px in the download link. Size up/down accordingly with your launcher for your preferred results.


&gt;[Edit1]: So, I started on the ""real deal"" with higher resolution icons. I've adjusted things here and there to better represent the Bioshock look, but I'm still not there yet. A big problem for me has been the disparity between a lot of the item icons and the plasmid icons (the latter is far looser and looks more child-like). Not to mention the fact that the plasmid icons are all cropped and arranged in a way that doesn't work so well with what android icons have to represent. I'll be constantly tweaking and adjusting to try and capture the feel as best as possible, but just bear in mind these are inspired by Bioshock, not necessarily perfect mimicry.

&gt;[Outdated](http://i.imgur.com/tJbgWpj.png)


&gt;[Original]: Okay, so I've always loved the BioShock art direction, especially that of the item icons, so on a whim, I made these icons. They're still very much a work in progress as I still don't think I've nailed the style well enough just yet. If anyone's interested, I can continue making more of them.

**NOTE:** This is an incomplete *development* build. A lot of stuff is broken. Once development is complete this update will be available in the Pro and Free channels for Reddit Sync on Google Play.


Here is an **incomplete** list of what *isn't* working:

* Night mode
* profiles
* NSFW filtering / labeling
* Messaging / inbox
* New comment notifications
* causual subreddits
* opening links in reddit sync from other apps
* Sync
* Some settings
* Viewing saved posts

*[You can report issues with the dev build on this github page](https://github.com/laurencedawson/reddit-sync-development/issues)*

I just released an update for Reddit News to the market. Highlights include:

1. Landscape Tablet Support(including the Nexus 7)
2. Spoiler support - all the major ones seem to be working, books, movies, skyrim, game of thrones, breaking bad etc. Let me know if you find some that don't work.
3. View the sidebar by pressing menu-&gt;sidebar
4. A completely revamped commenting interface. You can comment as normal from a popup(that no longer disappears on rotation ; ) ) to write a quick reply but now you have the option to go to an advanced screen to do some more complicated formatting. In the advanced screen you can easily choose your formatting from a dropdown list, quote from the comment you're replying to and best of all see a live preview of how your comment will actually look on reddit! You also have the option to save your comment from this screen to get back to it later.

&gt; Hey everyone, Jeff from Humble Bundle here. This is not EA or Popcap's fault at all, I would like to take responsibility for this. That @reply we posted is worded pretty unfortunately. The reality is that the new version of Plants vs. Zombies has a number of in-app purchases in it, and we thought that it would be tough to support that.

Here are some of issues so far I know of already: 

**Security Issues**

* You can remove lockscreen widgets with a security lock in place, even though you cannot add them [(Reported issue)](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39850&amp;q=lock%20screen&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars)
* Face unlock can be bypassed to log onto another user's account [(reported issue)](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39576&amp;q=lock%20screen&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars)


**Stylistic Issues**

* Flashing white rectangles on either side on phones every time  screen turns on, left side for tablet interface
* [Horrible default clock widget font](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39673&amp;q=lock%20screen%204.2&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars), also [here](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39800&amp;q=lock%20screen&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars)

**Glitches**

* Lockscreen occasionally forgets the selected widget page [(report)](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39806&amp;q=lock%20screen&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars)
* Problems with lockscreen music widget missing [(report)](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39725&amp;q=lockscreen&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars)
* Lockscreen glitching with music widget when the music application displaying the music widget is killed. More information required here, but the result is a glitching lockscreen jumping between the default screen and the music widget. 


**Usability Issues (Not really issues)**

* Inability to change the default clock widget when security policies are enabled to disable lockscreen widgets
* ability to customize the number of widget pages in the lockscreen
* ability to lock the number of pages in the lockscreen instead of forcing all users to use 5 (and displaying a big + page in all other instances)
* It is possible to take pictures with the device even with a security lock in place, even though you cannot access old pictures in the gallery until the device is actually unlocked. There is no option to change this behavior. With a third-party application, it is possible to work around this, but this feature needs to be in the system. 


*It is likely that Cyanogenmod and other AOSP custom ROMs will be working off this lockscreen code. It would be best of Google to give a good codebase for custom ROMs to be based off of to save the developers some trouble, in addition to fixing this problem on devices that ship with AOSP such as the Nexus 4, 7, and 10*"	t5_2qlqh	True

Then came Google books and movies: Denied. Then Google Music: Denied. And now it's Google Currents (which I really really wanted and has lead me to write this post.): Denied. 

So why is Google Currents the one that finally pissed me off? Because we're talking about a feed-reader app that deals with content I can already see on the Internet! There are already apps on Android for it that let me see it in a similar format as Google Currents, so why is Google blocking me as a Canadian resident on such a non-controversial app? Anyway, with all these Google apps not even being an option... my Android experience is waning. 

What's the point of having a phone which supposedly is supposed to be more  ""open"" than an iPhone, yet is more closed than Apple to non-US residents? Apple doesn't block Canada from services like iCloud.  I wish MeeGo or FreeRunner were more popular so I wouldn't have to cut through so much hoops just to enjoy apps.

So chances are if you're reading this and you really work for a manufacturer, you're just a marketing ""drone"" and don't have much sway. But *please*, oh ambassador from hives distant, please carry my/our message far and wide:

I'm not asking for you to give up on trying to out iPhone the iPhone or out Blackberry the Blackberry. That's your call, and much as I can't comprehend it apparently people *do* want phones they can shave with.

And that's *OKAY*.

But is it really so much to ask that there be some sysadmin/techie-friendly phone out there?  You know - fully rootable, with a \_good\_ hardware keyboard -- like the G1's (minus that chin) -- and rockin' specs? Maybe one that would have to be bought direct-from-manufacturer -- that's cool too.  In days gone by, that was how manufacturers earned the trust of consumers: tailor to the early adopters and the technophiles with devices ""just for them"".  It seems to me that it really isn't all that absurd to think that as many as one in twenty Android users might want a device like I do:  one that can be used however **I** choose to use it.  One that is extensible. I daresay -- if you opensourced your drivers from the outset and simply said, ""Here's our forum page. Search for your answers to your technical questions here"" -- and then had tech support folks on hand to respond as tier II support after that... that would help you cut down on support costs too. Imagine the massive buzz you'd get if you hired a dev to work on the Cyanogenmod project! (We're talking guaranteed *thousands* of sales. More likely *tens* of thousands, if not hundreds).  If your phone also came in to major versions - an LTE and an HSPA+ -- well, hell... I'd sing your praises so loud and often people would start asking me why I hadn't married you yet.

I would be willing to pay above-average market prices for such a device, dear manufacturers.  I know, I know -- this message probably isn't going to change the world.  But...  a fella can dream, no?"	t5_2qlqh	True

I know we might not be a huge market, but Reddit Mods are certainly one of the most loyal and vocal demographics looking for reddit apps. Unfortunately, we have been consistently neglected. Most apps provide modmail support, but there are none (on Android or iOS) that even provide the ability to approve, remove, or distinguish posts and comments. These simple features shouldn't be that hard to implement, but they are nowhere to be found. I wouldn't expect to be able to do things like changing community settings or editing the stylesheet, but if it's possible, they would certainly be welcomed as well.

Now, perhaps there is something preventing this. I can't program, so I can't be sure. If there is, that would certainly be unfortunate, but I have yet to hear a thing about it, and I've been asking for a while. The only answers I've ever heard are ""I don't know"" or ""I'll look into that"".

&gt; I took the liberty of disabling ""Qe"" which logs all of the differences in the current OS compared to how it comes from Motorola. It's a lag monster on the bootup, and an invasion of privacy.

It caught my attention so I asked him more about it and this is what he said:

&gt; I first noticed it in the RAZR and Droid 4 GB ROMs. The process ""qe"" is started during the initial boot services. It does a full scan of the /system dir and stores the md5 of every file. It then compares that information to a file in /pds which contains the md5sum file listing of the stock ROM as it was originally from Motorola.
As it diffs the 2 listings, any differences are placed in /data/misc/qer and eventually posted back to Motorola.

&gt; You can see the report on any stock phone by looking in there.

&gt; There is no way to disable it in the regular phone ROM without using a 2nd init process to change the ramdisk files as the binary ""qe"" is in /sbin and the service is started in the init.*.rc files.

The idea of my app, ReNotify, is to set notification reminders ridiculously fast when you're on the go. You can take your phone out, set a reminder, and put it back in your pocket quicker than you read this sentence,  seriously. Plus you see the note whenever you even look at your phone. 


I'm aware there are already a couple of apps similar to this but none with the same emphasis on speed. Give it a go, it's something that I have started to use every day.

Suggestions and critiques welcome :)


EDIT - I've released an update. You can now add persistent notifications, and the keyboard pops up automatically when the app is opened. It may take a little time to trickle through google play. Thanks for the ideas &amp; support!


EDIT 2 - Update 1.1 finally seems to be live on google play. Will publish 1.2 soon with holo dark option on 4.0+ and new button layout


EDIT 3 - Update 1.2 published, may be a few hours before it becomes available


EDIT 4 - Version 1.2 now showing up on google play


EDIT 5 - I've published version 1.2.1 with a white/grey notification icon for honeycomb onward, and fixed translations for several languages. Give it a few hours to become available as always


EDIT 6 - Alright, I'm going to bed now (Ireland). I'll be back tomorrow. In the mean time please pass this app on to your friends/family/co-workers if you liked it :-)


EDIT 7 - OK, I'm back

Riddla26	1040	352	179	"There's been a lot of furore over Google and it's data collection and people seem to be worried that if their account is compromised then all this data will be available to the attacker. While this may be true, there are a few steps you can take to ensure your data is extra secure. By enabling two-step verification the attacker will need to physically have access to your phone (or to Google's servers) to get anywhere near your account.

This is the link to the official [Google Authenticator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) app.

To set up the app, [read this guide](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1066447). You will be sent an SMS/text to verify your phone number. Once enabled and your phone is verified on your account you can then go to your [Google profile security settings](https://www.google.com/settings/security?ref=home) and enable two step through the app. From this page you can also add a backup phone number such as a spouse or partner or flatmate and print off 10 one time usage unique recovery codes to keep the physical copy of that you can use to verify, just so you can always get your account back in case you really get in the crap.

When enabled, if you login to your Google account on any machine or device that has not been previously authorised by you in the last 30 days, you will be prompted to enter a 6 digit code from the app that is only valid for 60 seconds before the algorithm changes it. The authenticator app is also available on Blackberry and iOS and probably others.

EDIT: /u/moosemoomintoog has reminded me that this also lets you use application specific passwords. Once two step is enabled you also can use application specific passwords to authorise sites and apps to use your Google account. This means you never put your Google password into a page that's not Google, even on your Android phone.

This subreddit has taught me about new android devices, apps, and things I could do with my phone. I would have never bothered to root my phone or install CM if people here hadn't so strongly recommended it. More importantly, I would never have been able to do these things if I hadn't been able to ask reddit for help. Even if **I** didn't make a thread, I was able to search past threads for people with similar problems.

Mods, you are fixing a problem that doesn't exist. Nobody minds the questions; some of us are happy to help. It simply isn't worth making a new subreddit. No one will subscribe, more questions will be left unanswered, and the community will be weakened. 

Please, let the questions continue.

1348903039.0	10nrjw	Earlier today I shipped my Nexus 7 to be replaced by Google. I just realized that not only did I forget to turn the device off, but there is a high-pitched beeping alarm set to go off in 11 hours. What do I do?	Antabaka	1099	413	280	"The alarm app apparently by default runs the alarm for ten minutes, snoozes for five, then resumes in that pattern forever.

It's within the original Nexus 7 packaging and within another card-board box, but testing the alarm sound with my phone leads me to believe that that won't stop it.

Given that the device is WiFi only, I can't do anything to remotely shut it off. It has plenty of charge, unfortunately.

Any ideas? Should I contact UPS?

[**Edit**: Got a return email from Google. They said to just wait it out.](http://i.imgur.com/ekcsK.png)

I should also note that the alarm should be going off ... right now.

Here is a slightly garbled version of the tracker, which I'll keep up to date. It seems likely, though, that nothing will happen until Monday morning, by which point this thread will be ~~[torn to pieces](http://sadpanda.us/images/311486-C1FCZSO.png)~~ long dead.

As for my problem, turns out that Google two-step authentication was causing it. Here are the instructions on how to fix it in case some Redditor out there is also having problems:

    * Log into your Gmail
    * On the upper-right corner, click on your Gmail address (which has a small triangle pointing down),
      and select Account settings
    * Click Authorizing applications &amp; sites
    * Verify your credentials if prompted
    * Enter GrooVe IP for the name of the application and click Generate password
    * In GrooVe IP, enter this password instead of your Gmail password (spaces don't matter)
    * You should now be able to log in with GrooVe IP"	t5_2qlqh	True

EDIT: If the FAQ doesn't refer to your specific device, then refer to XDA (also in the sidebar), which has Q&amp;As in their forum and a useful (albeit clunky) search function.

EDIT2: There seems to be a lot of controversy surrounding this and the thing I'd like to point out is that users of this subreddit have to at least have some knowledge of how Reddit works to get here. To that end, they should be familiar with this very subreddit's search function. With that in mind, I'm going to suggest that the reason people get frustrated with constant posting of the same question is because they fail to grasp the usefulness of the basic tools allocated to every single subreddit. 

So please, if the sidebar, google, XDA and countless other websites don't have everything you want to know, then please, by all means take a gander at what the search function can pull up for you.

1348054123.0	104q8q	Its been almost a YEAR since ICS. Contact photo sync, what are you doing?	axehomeless	993	314	184	"I thought I could single out a particular feature that desperatly needs fixing from the ""I hate about android"" article.

So, remeber that neat little picture in the people app?
In ICS it was introduced as a full blown big picture and upped to 256x256 pixels (or something along these lines).
People were complaining that GMail contact photos (you know, the source from which the contacts with photos sync on your android devices) only supports 96x96 pixels. The result was that every picture looked like fuck if youve synced it from GMail.
I think Vic Gundotra said ""yeah sure it sucks, well fix it soon.""
That also should be 10 months ago!

If you added it manually (ON YOUR DEVICE, for every contact at a time, (not cumbersome at all)) it was displayed in its full glory, but after a reset, boom, everythings gone again and ""got more jpg"".

Then, with Jelly Bean, they thought ""hey 256 pixels arent large enough for some devices with high res displays, so lets up it to 960x960 and be done with it for a while.

And what does the GMail Sync?

ABSOLUTLY FUCKING NOTHING!!

Why? WHY? WHY? Seriously?

It would be so perfect, you have your pictures indexed by picasa, the face detection sorts them, you take the best of a contact, set it as contact picture and everything is synced properly. But no, we get FUCKING PICTURES A TENTH OF THE SIZE THEY SHOULD BE!

WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?
Im am in no way a developer, neither web nor anything else, but if the OS supports 960x960, why not just go in the G-Mail code, replace 96x96 with 960x960 and be happy?

It cannot be that hard just to do something like this? I dont give a shit if the gmail contact photos are still displayed as small as they are now if the source picture is stored in the right resolution on the server.

The only explanation I could think of is that google doenst want the storage space crammed. But that is so ridicoulous, you can literally upload unlimited amounts of pictures to picasa that are way bigger (1600x1200 I think) than the contact pictures.
Or is it because it would blow up G-Mails layout?

So why doesnt google just flip the switch? It should be that hard?

I want to outrage right now that they implement this shit, it would be so much more of a great experience if this would just happen, I am tired of having to have contacts on facebook to get a good contact picture without manually installing it EVERY SINGLE GOD DAMN TIME!

1341880107.0	watsd	[Announcement] The new /r/Android theme is up!	deodrus	834	160	450	"Hey all,

I'm happy to present to you all the new face of /r/android!

This theme had been in the works on-and-off for several months. Due to both [meinhyperspeed](/u/meinhyperspeed) and me being overwhelmed with life and its many demands, progress on the theme was slow.

The majority of the credit goes to meinhyperspeed for his elegant and beautiful style - it was his brainchild that I worked on. So please make sure to thank him.

Well, it's finally here - so leave your thoughts, suggestions, critique... and most important of all, *bug-reports*, in the comments below!

***

**A few thoughts**

* ~~The banner is temporary. Feel free to suggest a different picture~~ FIXED
* ~~The theme is not compatible with Night-Mode on RES yet.~~ FIXED
* ~~Collapsing comments has some visually-buggy behaviour.~~ FIXED
* ~~Subreddit-logo will be changed to andreddit-alien soon.~~ FIXED
* ~~The font still needs tweaking. I plan to darken the grey-links some more.~~ FIXED
* ~~The ""cancel"" button will be replaced with a graphic to make it synonymous with the submit-button.~~ FIXED

Let me know what you'd like to see tweaked.

***

**NOTE:** *I set Roboto as the default font (if available). Problem is, Google Chrome renders it horribly (doesn't antialias/smooth it). I'll leave it up for a day so you can all see the effect, then take it off).* [See this picture as example](http://i.imgur.com/A40vT.png)

&gt;This is a notification that your application, Hazard Rush, with package ID com.surrealstreet.hazardrushau, has been removed from the Google Play Store.

&gt;REASON FOR REMOVAL: Violation of the spam provisions of the Content Policy. Please refer to the spam policy help article for more information.

I have never heard of this happening before. Have any other developers had this issue? What can be done? I'm devastated.

EDIT: It is 'suspended' in developer console and will disappear from the Play Store in a few hours. I don't know what to do. From an amazing high to crashing lows.

EDIT 2: Response from Google:

&gt;We have reviewed your appeal and will not be reinstating your app. This decision is final and we will not be responding to any additional emails regarding this removal. We are unable to ... provide guidance on bringing future versions of your app into policy compliance.

On top of that, the SGS2 kernel is 100% open source, ie, no proprietary binaries.  With this, and HTC reversing their stance on bootloaders, and LG having sent out some devices to CM developers (including the big man himself) it seems like things are good and only getting better.

Phone lost, missing, or stolen? **Calm down. Take a deep breath. Read this.**

**No Protection Apps Previously Installed**

1. From a computer, go to the Android Market.
2. Log in to your Google Account
3. Go to the [Plan B](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.lookout.labs.planb) page
4. Click ""install""
5. GPS location will be sent from your phone to your GMail. Your GPS may need to previously be turned on for this.
6. After 10 minutes or so, to get another GPS location, text ""locate"" to your phone

By following the above steps you can track down your phone until you finally find it. Do note that this method will not work 100% of the time. But, it is of course, as the title of the App suggests, Plan B. Plan A should have one of the below listed apps installed.

***
**Lost/Missing/Stolen Protection Apps**

Below are various apps to download before your phone goes missing. Test out each one. Each one has different features and works slightly different than the other. Find one that meets your personal preference.

Before looking into one of the options below, some phones already have tracking software pre-installed. Check your device for tracking software before continuing.

I've just pushed an update for Reddit News Free to bring it up to date with the paid version: [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news). This new free version now has added ad permissions. I'll cut and paste the updated play store description below as an explanation.  

---
.    


This version has new permissions to optimize ads (the paid version does *not* have them).

**New permissions:**

""read phone status and identity"" - allows the retrieval of a unique id to better track ad impressions

""approximate location"" allows ads to be displayed based on your rough location (i.e city or town)    

**Why?** - This is a one man project (me - DBrady). Some of you may have noticed that updates to Reddit News are not as frequent as they once were. It has become increasingly difficult to find time (around a full time job, family and friends) to implement all the features people want to see and have asked for. The purpose of these new permissions is to try and increase ad revenue to a point where i could work on updating Reddit News for a day or two a week.

I realize there is (understandable) discontent around these kinds of permissions so i'm making the old version available **ad free** and **permission free** for users who don't want to upgrade. You can download it from my Dropbox here: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ygwkyha8wxq8qu3/Reddit%20News%20Free%20552.apk

You also have the option to buy the paid version which i'm putting on sale for the next couple of days at 1/2 price if you would like to upgrade.

Also see the following link for a discussion on reddit:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/173h5q/reddit_news_update_coming_opinion_on_adding/

.  
Hopefully these options will be sufficient to satisfy most people's concerns regarding privacy in this new version.

Let me know your thoughts and opinions, particularly on whether it's fair or not.

Cheers

Dave

I've followed this subreddit religiously for years, and I've never noticed DLNA being talked about.  TO be sure, a quick search shows me that every once in a blue moon someone has mentioned it, but I don't think it ever got the shout out it deserved:

**What is it?**

DLNA is system of music and file sharing that is integrated into many, many electronics, and you may have a device or two in your entertainment system that is DLNA ready.  I have a bluray player and amp that both have DLNA capabilities-- I had no idea.

Your laptop/PC can very easily be used as a DLNA device for all major OS (mac, linux, windows)

**Okay, but what does it let you do?**

DLNA can let you use your Android device as a remote to play music FROM any DLNA device TO any DLNA device... meaning that you can access music from your PC or your phone (or tablet, or your girlfriend's laptop, etc) and play it directly through your DLNA-enable equipment wirelessly...  This could mean your PC speakers, or possibly even your good entertainment system speakers depending on what devices you have.  Or it means you could play your music on your girlfriend's phone... just.. tons of possibilities.  

So if you've been in the market for overpriced bluetooth speakers, this should give you pause, because DLNA potentially offers you a much cheaper, better solution.

On the android side of things have had a lot of success with BubbleUPnP app.  It is very expensive at just under $5, but the UI is phenomenal.  You can easily search through hundreds or thousands of songs very quickly and easily.  Also it allows you to stream google music, which is awesome in light of the All Access.   

Anyway, I'm just amazed I'd never heard of this.  I'm sure many of you have, but this may be of interest to a lot of people who had no idea this was out there."	t5_2qlqh	True

**As I'm coming to learn, this may do nothing, this may make things worse, you'll need to some trial and error and even if it works fine one day, another day it may make things worse. Also, with the AFWall+/Android Firewall method, make sure it's not set to white list in the main interface unless you know what you're doing, otherwise no app will have internet access. You must also select apply in the menu after inputting the script/making changes or it will not change anything.**

As many of you know, yesterday there was a post here in /r/android about how buffering issues with the YouTube app made someone wonder if Google was killing it, of it was an issue on their end. It was not a case of either of them, but due to throttling of cached videos with many ISPs. The top comment gave you a fix for Windows. I gave an answer about how to fix it with Android, and for visibility sake I'm making a self-post about it.

Onto the fix. You have two methods that I know of, the first is the fix I figured out and it requires a firewall app like [AFWall+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.ukanth.ufirewall) or [Android Firewall](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jtschohl.androidfirewall). If you use Droidwall I highly *recommend* switching to one of these apps as Droidwall is no longer being worked on, and both these apps are based off of Droidwall. We will firstly want to press on the menu in the app, there is an option that states Set custom script. When you press on it you are presented with a page that gives you an area to type your scripts in, you'll want to input these two lines:

    $IPTABLES -A ""afwall"" --destination ""206.111.0.0/16"" -j ""afwall-reject""
    $IPTABLES -A ""afwall"" --destination ""173.194.55.0/24"" -j ""afwall-reject""

The second method is one that I came across [JoshTheDerp](http://www.reddit.com/user/JoshTheDerp). [His method](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1axwab/you_tube_becoming_a_big_pos_load_times_are/c9294co) uses any old terminal app, such as [Android Terminal Emulator](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1axwab/you_tube_becoming_a_big_pos_load_times_are/c9294co), to modify the iptables. Just input these three lines and it will have the same effect:

    su
    iptables -A OUTPUT -d 173.194.55.0/24 -j DROP
    iptables -A OUTPUT -d 206.111.0.0/16 -j DROP

Which one you should use will depend on what you have installed. However, I cannot help you if later you decided to stop blocking these IP ranges with terminal. If you wish to stop blocking with AFWall+ or Android Firewall, all you have to do is delete the two lines from the custom script.

**If you want any help at all, just ask, a gracious redditor has graced me with reddit gold, so I'm feeling good enough to help you with your problems.**

**EDIT:** So it seems that the terminal method is not permanent, but only until you reboot. This will be more useful if you only want to block those IP ranges for a short period.

**EDIT2:** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1a1m3u/the_dreaded_youtube_speed_debate_update_to/) is a post by General-ColinBlue on why this is only a temporary fix.

The refund period is probably still 15 minutes.	martinw89	1240	606	57	"I'm referring to [this recent submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/mhaub/android_market_refund_extended_from_15_minutes_to/), which at the time of me posting this is at 522 points and still at the top of /r/android. The refund period is almost definitely still 15 minutes. If you read the comments, you would have seen that the period for a refund *by contacting Google support* has always been 48 hours, and Google has always given themselves this ceiling. Also, I don't know when, but the original article has been changed to reflect this, yet the submission keeps slowly going up.

The 48 hour period is specified under Section 3.4 of the [Android Market Developer Distribution Agreement](http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html), which is the ***Special* Refund Requirements** section (emphasis mine). Basically, it's allowing Google to have some leeway if an app can't be fully evaluated within the *Market* refund period, [which is still 15 minutes according to Google's Android Market policies](https://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=134336&amp;amp;topic=1100168).

Sorry everybody. Remember, don't just upvote what you wish were true. Let's try to keep the articles here factual.
