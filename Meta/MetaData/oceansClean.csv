[x-post from r/environment]	Soylent_Gringo	32	4	1	"I screwed up Friday afternoon. 

Hopefully, somewhere there's a Redditor/activist in the Galveston area that knows other activists, possibly from one of the local campuses, (UTMB, A&amp;M, GC) that knows who was canvassing Fish Village passing out [these flyers](http://imgur.com/a/w2OVV) Friday late afternoon, 10/26. 


You were on the odd-numbered side of Mackeral trying to get people to help out with a very important issue. I did not respond to your plea. All you were asking was for me to write a couple of brief letters, and I refused you. I don't know if you will ever see this, but I hope so.


Later on, when I realized what I had done, it wasn't the cause you were standing up for, or that you *were* standing up for something good in a world where we have poisoned our garden, trashed our oceans, and mistreated our beasts. It wasn't that at all. It was a look in your eye as you turned to walk away. It was from the side, and I saw it for only the briefest of moments, because I looked away. But, it was a powerful image and now I cannot unsee it. It was one of defeat-there you were, busting your ass going door to door, on foot with the weather turning windy &amp; cold, probably thinking "" what the hell do I have to do to get through to people, and some old, bald, dumbass won't help me out even by just writing a few short paragraphs in a couple of letters that I'll pick up &amp; mail for him anyway."" You didn't do anything wrong in presenting your case. I was just in a negative mood. I don't think I was rude or impolite or anything, I just didn't step up to the plate.


Usually, I like being a cynical old fart, but, for whatever reason, it has become a little more than *glaringly* apparent to me that I need to be more selective in the use of that cynicism, and wield it more responsibly, as it does have a place in certain arenas. I use it often as a coping skill. Yesterday afternoon I failed horribly and miserably.


I am going to make this right for you. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/Yx9GD) are pics of the letters, I will mail them.
You were asking for donations but I had zero cash, I truly am sometimes living paycheck to paycheck, but I make a promise to you now to donate to your cause via your website or other means as soon as $$ permits.


While I of course agree with your cause, it is not what provides the impetus for all this. I am trying to encourage that which I had discouraged, and ask that *anybody* who ever gets shot down by jerks like me to never give up your fight.


Upvote please for visibility. I am posting self. as I want no meaningless internet karma from it-I am trying to keep the real karma merely equal if nothing else.

You can visit [the World Oceans Day website](http://WorldOceansDay.org/ideas) for more info on how to attend or hold your own event.

One thing I wanted to share with the sub is the **Youth Video Contest**! [Visit this site for more info](http://www.oneworldoneocean.com/get-involved/wod_vc_signup). It's a video contest held by [One World One Ocean](http://oneworldoneocean.org) for 7 - 12th graders, and they could win free GoPro cameras and some cash. Please share with anyone you think would be interested.

We're happy to answer any questions you have!

Our regional competition, the Surf Bowl held at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is one of the most competitive of all the competitions in the country.

Concerned about rising levels of plastic waste in the oceans, Ahovi put together a design for an underwater drone that can search for and gobble-up ocean garbage. It's hoped that this device, when used en masse, could dramatically reduce the plastic islands that are forming in virtually all the Earth's oceans.""

""... Once full, the drone will locate and dock with its mothership, where crew members will pull the device out of the water and empty it of its contents.

And according to Beth Buczynski of EarthTechling, the drone features a sonic emitter which sends out an irritating signal to deter aquatic life from getting near, thus preventing the bot from gobbling up living marine animals.""

What about feasability? Such as how it can distinguish between the masses of plastic and a large school of fish? Will the sounds used to deter fish also be dangerous to sensitive marine organisms? Wonderful concept anyway, and one I how is practical."	t5_2s7su	True

Think of devices to capture kinetic energy from waves and tides, or devices build to use the natural temperature and salinity differences. Many of the applications are very high tech and in a purely experimental phase, but some methods are as old as the sun (well, almost) and can be used right now :)

I've *only* included the introductory links here as they already provide for quite a lot of nice reading :)

Feel free to post more in the comments!!!

1360523681.0	189cbt	An Incredibly Weird and Specific Tidal (&amp; History) Question	TheRadGasm	8	2	3	"Here is my incredibly specific question: 

Is it at all plausible that there may have been a **low tide**:

1. At night, 
2. during Spring 
3. of any year in the late 16th Century, 
4. on the Friesland coast of the North Sea?

Data has been hard to come by, so I haven't found any resources I can use to infer anything close to an answer. Also, I'm not even a little bit of an oceanographer. What I do know is that this particular coast was especially capricious re: storm tides (which is why there was so little settlement there), and that it generally followed a semi-diurnal pattern, which makes it possible for a midnight low-tide. Is this correct?

I'm researching the plausibility of a causeway, exposed only during low-tide, that lead to an otherwise inaccessible island. This causeway, if plausible, might only have been accessible at very specific points throughout the year, and if so, might such a point fall during or near Vernal Equinox.

[Here's](http://bushwarriors.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/a-bloody-victory-world-record-breaking-swim-involved-slaughter-of-critically-endangered-sharks/) a long story about killing of endangered (Oceanic White Tip) sharks during Penny's swim. [Here's](http://bushwarriors.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/update-palfreys-husband-talks-to-bush-warriors-about-slaughter-of-critically-endangered-sharks-during-record-breaking-swim/) the follow-up with comments from Penny's husband. [Here's](http://www.dailynewsofopenwaterswimming.com/2011/06/brutal-slaughter-of-sharks.html) Steve Munatones article on it.

I recommend reading the comments on all also to see some of the bile and different opinions. If my very limited experience of press is anything to go by, the truth will more complex than is currently being portrayed.

Some comments I would make as a swimmer:

* There has to be complete trust between a swimmer and crew. The swimmer rarely knows the full story from the crew. Some swimmers want to be told the truth, some want to be lied to. Only distance swimmers and crew will really understand this dynamic. Afterwards or even during you might be angry or disagree with even simple things happening. But as a swimmer you've put your life into the hands of the crew. Make no mistake, distance swimming is one of the most extreme sports and it takes more than just the swimmer to accomplish.

* I haven't met Penny Palfrey (though we have people we know in common). I'm pretty certain that she feels as I do about the sea, that she loves it and all its glory in the way only someone who risks their life in it could. I sure she is very upset at the loss, more so than people that have never swum a metre. I'll be interested in her thoughts but I'm fairly sure she will be deeply pained, but it would be naive to expect her to criticise her crew and her husband. It's entirely possible though that she wishes she'd been pulled but also that she might not say this. But it's also possible that she is happy with the situation. I'm not a mind-reader and can only speculate.

* Any possible legal proceedings will be interesting. Since I swim in water that doesn't have fish (only dangerous sharks are called fish by OW swimmers), I don't know whether they had to get any different permits for this swim. Or, if it happened outside territorial waters, then there will be no proceedings.

* The bile and hysteria toward Penny is unwarranted though. People who wring their hands dump plastic that kill birds and turtles. They flush their condoms to choke wildlife. They throw their shit everywhere and dump their poisons in the sea and still lecture other people while they drive around in SUVs. Environmental improvements will never be achieved by screeching mobs or diktats but by consensus amongst everyone. (The sea led directly to me doing an environmental Master's degree).

* If I was in the same situation, I'd prefer to have my swim abandoned that have an endangered creature killed for my swim. But if a crew told me they killed a shark for my safety, I'd ABSOLUTELY believe them. Those two things are also compatible.

* The fundamental question being asked by many is whether any swim is worth such a price. For this particular swim, I think we still need more clarity, and certainly not a rush to judgement.

Disclaimer: The second article seems to me to imply Steve Munatones is lying. I don't believe this. Steve is the foremost promoter of Open Water swimming in the world, and is always open in his opinions. I know Steve from personal email discussions  and he has featured my writing and interviewed me for Daily News of Open Water. And Steve and I have disagreed also."	t5_2s7su	True

&gt;Download a wind stress dataset from ECCO, COADS, etc. There are some wind files that I have pre-processed here. These already have wind stress curl calculated, too.
&gt;
&gt;They are derived from the:
&gt;
&gt;Grist &amp; Josey climatology,
&gt;The ECCO data-assimilating model iteration 199,
&gt;The Hellerman &amp; Rosenstein Climatology,
&gt;The SCOW Climatology, and
&gt;The NSCAT scatterometer data.
&gt;I have given you the wind stresses and wind stress curls. Calculate the Ekman transports and the Ekman Divergence. What features are revealed? How do datasets differ by month/year/across datasets?
&gt;
&gt;In this assignment, you should also estimate a temperature, salt, chlorophyll, or volume budget. That is, you will take Ekman transport and observed gradients to figure out how to balance the incoming and outgoing sources into a region or into a volume. For the budgeting exercise, you may want to use the ECCO data assimilating datasets, available here.
&gt;

I'm just wondering - what are some interesting potential regions to analyze?"	t5_2s7su	True

1361421064.0	18xohu	What are the best oceanography datasets?	inquilinekea	6	0	4	"So here are the assignment guidelines for my undergrad oceanography class:

&gt;Describe quantitatively the amount and quality of ocean data available to describe a region, watermass, variability, or process of interest. Some examples:

&gt;Subsample a dataset to estimate the sampling error in a bulk measurement, e.g., global mean temperature. How many subsurface observations are needed? Does it matter where they are? Show QUANTITIATIVELY.

&gt;Compare similar measurements from two datasets (e.g., Reid &amp; Mantyla versus eWOCE, or WOCE shipboard CTD versus WOCE drifter CTD). You can do this in a region of interest, or in a chosen bulk measurement (e.g., global temperature, Mediterranean temperature), or in a repeated section, etc. How do you distinguish variability from error? Can you distinguish cycles from trends?

&gt;Compare similar measurements but separated in time. Is there signal above the noise? How can you estimate noise (or has someone else done it for you)? Can you distinguish instrumental noise from ""aliasing noise"", that is, effects from processes you don't want to deal with?
&gt;

I'm thinking of doing the Zapiola Drift, but I'm running into issues with sparse datasets. I'm trying to start out with eWOCE and ARGO datasets, but they're too sparse to be of much use. I know that there are satellite SST observations, but where's a good place to start with those?"	t5_2s7su	True
