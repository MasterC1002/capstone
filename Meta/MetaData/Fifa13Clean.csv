* Relegation Decider in Division 2 (need all 3 points)
* Pick Juve ( I only ever pick Juve)
* Opponent is Brazil. Im sick of only playing Bayern and Brazil so I quit.
* Get paired up with Brazil in the next 9 encounters
* 10th encounter get paired up with Bayern, may as well play him
* He quits &lt;5mins in
* 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th games get matched with Brazil
* Finally give in and play Brazil in the 15th time
* He dances through defence and scores on a triple rebound that Buffon saves the first two times but conveniently deflects to his other 2 forward each time
* He passes it about defence for the next 80 minutes.
* Luckily win the ball back thanks to Dante falling. Yes, falling over and score with Giovinco.
* He pauses 2 times, so I return the favor with all 3 pauses.
* Win the ball back from kickoff and score a screamer in the 90th minute with Vucinic and he pauses the game. Notice the background animation suddenly goes choppy
* Disconected
* I am no longer connected to the EA servers
* Awarded a loss
* Relegated

[GO TO THIS PAGE AND TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED AND JOIN THE REVOLUTION, THE OFFICIAL RULES ARE HERE TOO!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fifa13/comments/1gzx4i/grand_master_championship_update_rules_page/)



Are YOU bored of going on FUT and just playing season after season, with no real objective in the game anymore?  Tired of playing gold tournament after gold tournament, seemingly floating in the FUT abyss?

WELL LISTEN UP, I KNOW WE DID A SIMPLE 'OL TOURNAMENT LAST TIME BUT LET'S MAKE THIS BIGGER AND BETTER AND HAVE OUR OWN FUT WORLD CUP!

My idea is that we get as many FUT players as we can to join in on this sub in a multiple of 4.  We set a deadline, if at that deadline we don't have a total that is divisible by 4, we extend the deadline until we do.  And I'm talkin about a shit ton of players for this, as many as possible.

Since I have no idea who's good and who's not, I'll completely randomly make group tables of 4 teams each.  Each player will play 6 games in the group stages: 3 at home vs the opponents and 3 away, because why the fuck not.  Games will be played as soon as you can possibly get in contact and play the person, I don't want to set too strict of a deadline on that because some people may not always be available when you are!  I suppose when you match up with someone, play them once in your stadium, and then right after, play them at theirs, so you get two games out of the way right then and there.

After the group stages are over, I'll do that to seed for the EPIC DOUBLE ELIMINATION TOURNAMENT.  WHICH EVERYONE WILL PLAY IN.  Seeding will just be made from point totals.  If multiple teams have the same points after the group stage (say 3 teams have 9 points each) I'll just have to choose the ordering of seed A, B, and C at random unless someone has a better idea.

We'll play out the double elimination tournament and I can make as many posts as necessary to update people on standings and the tournament tree.  Just comment below that you're in and I'll begin making the groups.  After that I'll post again telling everyone who they're playing and you can contact each other via PM and share gamertags (so this way only the people you play know your gamertag)

I'll make an Excel Spreadsheet and get this all very organized, but I think this would be an exciting way to find out who truly runs the show in Reddit FUT 13.

Comment if you have ANY ideas on how this could the best possible online tournament ever, and any changes/additions you think should be made.  And I'll say that this is only for XBOX right now, since I don't have a PS3, but hell, I'll organize a PS3 tournament and post results/keep everyone informed if you want me too as well!

So comment below if you think you're man enough to try and conquer us all.  Or woman enough.  Do girls play FIFA?  That's a mystery to me... and lol at whoever's downvoting my comments, I'm just letting people know that they're registration is being taken care of, goodness me

And UPVOTE THIS so it goes to the top, I want AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE to see this and have the chance to join and play in this once in a lifetime reddit tournament.

**Depending on the response this gets, I am setting the initial deadline for sign ups by Thursday June 27th at Noon EASTERN TIME UNITED STATES.  If anybody think this should be changed let me know by commenting.  I want this tournament to have the most people, and be the most fun possible.  And I need your interaction and suggestions to make it as top quality as possible!**

My friends in FIFA!  Welcome to the 2nd of what looks like will be many posts from me regarding the greatest of FIFA tournaments of all time.  As of the moment I type this, we have 87 players currently signed up on XBOX and 37 signed up on PS3!  Incredible!  If you still need to sign up, go to [this post and follow the instructions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fifa13/comments/1gyrod/grand_master_champion_of_fifa_13_xbox_super/) Keep it coming!  You still all have time!

A few things I need to take care of:

FIRST:

[These are the rules.  Give this a good read.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJEapzOleNOvyFrAN1yNL3fVYGwbuy-OJ5KXKxVDuXc/edit?usp=sharing)  If you have any gripes, PM me if you want.  I'm open to minor changes, but for the most part, so we can get going with it, the general rules will hold true unless a large majority dislike something about the tournament.  But I think it sounds fair, fun, relaxed, and EPIC.  Hope you all agree.

SECOND:

I need you all to comment on this post IF YOU ARE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR THE TOURNAMENT, telling me one very crucial thing.  Where do you live?  For uniformity sake, choose one of 5 things, and only one of 5:

West Coast USA

Central USA

East Coast USA

Europe

~~South America~~ LOL Australia/NZ/Oceania/Asia

Only say differently if you feel you live *significantly* elsewhere from one of those 5 options.  This is for group assignment purposes.  So people close to each other can play at good times and have good connections.  Again, only do this if you know I already have your name on my spreadsheet here with me and I can put it down, if you haven't signed up, go to the original post telling me you want in, what console, and where you live.

THIRD:

If you have any more specific comments or anything really, PM me, and I'll try to get back to you.  I'M SO EXCITED!  UPVOTE THIS!

Thanks for the support and the help so far, this is going to be fantastic!

-dlucisan

**First Edit:  Keep it coming guys, as of 11:18 eastern time USA I have upvoted everyone and taken down all of the information provided so far!  Keep commenting and telling me where you're at so you can be placed in the best possible group!  If you don't do this by a time to be decided upon after the registration deadline, your group members will be completely random.  This is something you probably would not prefer, but we we will need to get going.  As of this update, we have 48 PS3 players and ONE HUNDRED TWENTY XBOX PLAYERS HOLY FUCKING SHIT.  KEEP SIGNING UP IF YOU HAVEN'T YET, AND GET YOUR FRIENDS TO AS WELL!  THERE IS NO CAP, AND REGISTRATION IS OPEN ALLLL THE WAY UNTIL THURSDAY AT NOON EAST COAST USA TIME!  I'M SO EXCITED!!!**

1370761147.0	1fyz69	Government Health Warning	dani_1023	94	26	21	"The Government has confirmed today that a new and deadly strain of bacteria which largely began in 2012 has now reached epidemic proportions and there is very little that can be done to save victims once infected.

The bacteria, known to scientists as 'paceitis-352' is highly infectious. The public should be extremely wary when approaching anyone they think might be infected.

**How did it start?**

The source of the infection is unknown, but it is believed that an individual known only as 'Welliton' may have inadvertently spread the infection whilst travelling from Brazil to Russia and back again. In Brazil the infection was passed on to a number of players including 'Luis' and 'Pato'. Similar reports have come out of Russia regarding individuals know as 'Eminike' and 'McGeady'.

**What are the symptoms?**

The first and most obvious sign of infection is a tendency to use fast players in every position, even if it is not logical. An infected player will often use wingers in central midfield, and full backs at centre half. Look for these early warnings signs. Other symptoms include:

- profuse sweating
- a tendency to hold down the run button, or the contain button
- use of so called 'lonely' skill - the player will use skill moves in open space when there is no need to
- loss of the ability to play a square pass
- a propensity for using lofted through ball over and over again
- an inability to use the ball in the middle of the pitch
- tendency to use extremely bright coloured kits and balls.
- playing on narrow and ultra-defensive in order to have at least seven defensive players in and around the penalty box.
- monosyllabic, garbled speech including words such as 'you', 'mad', and 'bro'.
- at every kick off, the player will not be able to resist an attempt at running through your entire defence.
- in severe cases, putting ten players on your goal line for corners is common
- when winning, they will often do keep-ups with their keeper and pass it around at the back
- an early warning sign is the excessive use of the word 'beast' when speaking about their players or team.
- using team names referencing Jimmy Savile





**What should I do if I encounter someone who has been infected?**

The best advice is to avoid an infected person altogether, but if you are unable to do so it is generally felt that clever use of passing, tactics and skill can often cause the person to quit out and attempt to infect someone else.

**Is there a cure?**

there is no known cure for paceitis-352. However, research suggests that forcing a player to use slow players with high technical ability can help. Researchers are currently petitioning the government to enforce a 'auto through ball' ban in order to restrict the spread of the disease.


**What can I do to help?**

Paceitis-352 is a serious affliction and players who are affected should be treated with sympathy and support, not anger. They just like to win and it's not their fault that this is the only way they can do it. Encourage them to start playing proper football, suggest they pass the ball around, or even try putting through balls on manual. With patience and time they might get better, although even those who believe they are cured will often revert to their old style once they start losing a game.

**What's does the future hold?**

Scientists generally believe that if left unchecked the infection could result in the death of FIFA. be vigilant!

1351657430.0	12ds7v	Know your Chemistry	flamingChurro	68	11	15	"Hey guys,

I first saw this information posted in FUTHEAD at the end of FIFA 12. However, since they've moved on to FIFA 13, the information is no longer available there. I think these basic pointers can come in handy when you're building teams. Some of you FUT veterans already know this, but it may be useful for new players.

So as you know, the goal when you're building a squad is to get all your players to that precious 9 chemistry level, because that's when they'll perform the best for your ultimate team. There are several ways to get your players to 9 chemistry, but all roads start with a basic question, which is:

How many chemistry points does a player need to reach 9 chemistry?

Some players need more chemistry points than others, it all depends on how many links a player has in a formation. Different formations have different link arrangements, so let's start with an example. 

[4-2-2-2 link arrangement](http://i.imgur.com/fDrJk.png)

In the 4-2-2-2, both CAM spots need 3 chemistry points because both CAMs have 3 links to fill in. 
The strikers only need 2 chemistry points each because they only have 2 links.
The CDMs need 4 chemistry points because they have 4 links.
The Fullbacks need only 2 points, CBs 4 points, GK needs 2 points. 

All of this provided the players are in the correct formation and position. If they're not in the correct formation AND position, then they're going to need **MORE** chemistry points as I'll explain down below.

So, how are the points awarded?

* A league link awards 1 chemistry point. 
* A nationality link awards 1.5 chemistry points.
* A club link awards 1.5 chemistry points.

However, if players are from the same club, then they are obviously from the same league, club mates get 2.5 chemistry points always (1 point for the league + 1.5 points for the club).

Players from the same league and same nationality also get 2.5 points (1 point for the league + 1.5 for nationality).

Finally, players from the same league, same club and same nationality get 4 points (1 + 1.5 + 1.5).
Here you can see a very basic hybrid with 3 leagues and various nationalities. 

[Basic Hybrid](http://i.imgur.com/uoSCD.png)

[All of them in 9 chemistry](http://i.imgur.com/isfa0.png)

Eto'o gets 2.5 points from Bousouffa because they're from the same club, Eto'o only needed 2 points.

Bousouffa gets 2.5 points from Eto'o, and 1.5 points from Adel Taraabt. Bousouffa only needed 3 points, he gets 4.

Same with Cisse and Taraabt, both meet their required points.

Tiote gets 5 points even with 2 dead links, 2.5 from Santon, 2.5 from Cabaye. Tiote only needed 4 points.

You get the idea. 

**Formations and Position are very important as well.**

When players are one position away from the slot they are placed in (shown as an orange boot), then they need double the chemistry points to reach 9 chemistry. Say you put a CF in a ST slot, in the 4222 for example ST need 2 points, but if you put a CF in the ST slot then he'll need 4 chemistry points instead of 2 points to reach 9 chemistry.

If players are two or more positions away from where they are placed (shown as a red boot), then the maximum chemistry they can reach is 5 chemistry. Even if they have double the chemistry and the correct formation.

[Take Wijnaldum as an example](http://i.imgur.com/AESL8.png)

[Only 5 chemistry for Wijnaldum](http://i.imgur.com/AyZHH.png)

As shown above, Wijnaldum is a CAM in the ST slot. Wijnaldum is getting 6.5 chemistry points, triple what he needs as a striker, yet because he is 2 positions away he can only reach 5 chemistry.  If Wijnaldum were a CF, he would get the full 9 chemistry.

Formations are a bit more forgiving. If a player is one formation away (shown as an orange formation) then the player will need double the chemistry points required by his position to reach 9 chemistry.

If a player is in a completely incompatible formation (shown as a red formation), then he can only ever reach 8 chemistry, even with double chemistry points and the right position. Take Locadia for example. The silver striker gets 4 chemistry points from Wijnaldum, and 2.5 from Roy Beerens, yet he can only reach 8 individual chemistry because he is in the wrong formation.

[Locadia](http://i.imgur.com/S7EKY.png)

[Locadia can only reach 8 chemistry](http://i.imgur.com/EO81H.png)

Lastly, if a player is in an orange formation AND orange position they can only ever reach 8 chemistry, even if they meet double their chemistry requirement. Here is Wijnaldum As a CAM in a 4-4-2, he only reaches 8 individual chemistry even while receiving 10 chemistry points.

[Wijnaldum in a 4-4-2 as a CAM](http://i.imgur.com/j8ald.png)

[Wijnaldum only gets 8 chem](http://i.imgur.com/8t4sg.png)

I think that about covers it, hope this helps you build some fun hybrids in your favorite formations. Have fun."	t5_2smu8	True

1356723564.0	15l4oa	Simple ways to make Manager/Career Mode more enjoyable	djp4516	64	6	37	"Been playing a lot of Career Mode as a manager lately, and there are so many minor features that the devs could probably implement rather easily but for some reason, choose not to. Here's my list:

1) Transfer History screen - Sortable by year/club/league; its just incredibly baffling to me that they haven't added this already. You can only review transfers for the window that is currently happening, and you can't even view any more details on the transfer. How can it possibly be that I can't view my transfer history as a manager? isn't that kind of important?

2) Kit tweaks - Why not give us the option to change the colors (not the design itself, that'd probably be too complicated) of away/alternate kits the start of each season? Would keep the mode fresh, especially for the teams that don't have an alternate kit and only get to pick between two kits. 

3) Training focus - FIFA doesn't need a complex training system like FM, just give us the option to have the player focus on one area more than the others (ie: ball control, attacking, defending, aerobic)

4) Reserve/youth academy game stats

5) More sortable stats in general for your first team

6) Primary/secondary lineups - We've all been there, particularly when you're a big club: It's the first round of the Capital One Cup, and you have three PL/Champions League games in the next week. You want to keep your starting XI fresh, and you know you're playing an inferior team. Why not give us the option before the season of setting a ""secondary"" lineup, which automatically subs in your backups? 

7) Depth chart/auto subs - As an add-on to #6, how about being able to set criteria for fitness subs, so you don't have to go to Squad &gt; Team Management to take out a guy you know is dead tired? ex: I'm playing as Liverpool, and let's say Daniel Agger's ""Auto Rest"" setting is anything less than 95% stamina. The game would then go to the next CB on my ""depth chart"" and sub the player in automatically (talking before the game, but this could be expanded to in-game subs as well) if Agger's stamina was 95% or less.

8) Less dumb interruptions during simulating - If I send my scout out to Brazil for 6 months, do I really need an e-mail 3 days later that says he's going to Brazil? Same with when you hire a scout, why does it say ""Hey, I'm here. Send me somewhere."" Wouldn't it be easier just to give them instructions immediately after being hired? Why not just give me the option to turn those e-mails on/off? 

I'm sure I'll think of more later, but those are just off the top of my head. "	t5_2smu8	True

I don't claim to be a great in-game player, but I like to think that I have put enough hours into the last 3 years of FIFA and FIFA 13 that I am good at managing in Career Mode.

First, I play on World Class and am in my 3rd season with Southampton. My default setting is to receive 75% of transfer fees, which can make a pretty big difference.

Transfer Tips:

1. When you start out, you may be tempted to get old, cheap players with high overall ratings. **Don't**. They will quickly deteriorate into shitty players with high wages and no transfer value. I picked up Nesta, a 36-yr-old defender rated at 81, my first season, and by the end he was a 76 despite being in decent form (everyone else was in good form).

2. Instead of getting a 35-yr-old player with an 80 rating, get a 16-21 year old player with a 70 rating and good stats in key areas. By the end of the season they will have the same stats, but the young player will be worth way more and will have a very low wage.

3. Get players with good stats in key areas, like I just said. By this I mean to get defenders with high ratings in interceptions, marking, and tackling (standing more so than sliding, depending on your game style). Having high stats in areas like crossing will artificially inflate their overall grade. If you like crossing, then go for that.

4. Unless you desperately need cash, you should propose a counter offer for players. This is especially true when they are in good form or have been leading the league in some key stat (goals or assists). Your board will say ""we can from get between x and y for this player."" I often ask for more than the amount Y and get it. There is no need in selling players for low sums. Big clubs will be more apt to accept counter offers.

5. **Free Agency**- I have seen a few people complain that no one is in free agency. Every year, more people will show up in free agency. Check at the beginning of the first transfer window. You can often get players that are 18 and rated at 70, which is worth a couple million. You don't have to pay a transfer fee, and young players have really low wages. Buy them up and sell them later.

Scouting Tips:

1. This is not the way to make big money in FIFA unless you are a small club. You can make a couple million here or there, but this is small for top division clubs. Sometimes you will make more than that, but it depends on your scouts.

2. Hire scouts that are from power-house countries. I have more luck scouting in Brazil and the US than in small countries. Having a scout work in their home country gives them a boost, and it is usually cheaper.

3. When you first hire scouts, get quantity over quality and slowly work your way up by firing and hiring new scouts. The time to upgrade scouts is usually after transfer periods (usually the mid-year period) when you no longer are in need of that money.

4. Don't be afraid to sign players and fill up your youth squad. I usually keep my squad full and cut players as they turn out to suck. If a player isn't rated at least 60 when they are 16 or have potential in the low 80s, I cut them. They also will improve a bit on your squad, so don't call them up unless they demand it, you will use them, or you can sell them.

Loaning Players:

1. Make sure all of your players have the correct transfer/loan listing at the beginning of the transfer window. Getting players sold or out on loan doesn't always work, so try to maximize your chances by making it longer.

2. Sending players to better clubs will boost their stats the most. I sent a 68 defender to Man U and he came back a 72, despite the rest of my loanees improving only 1 or 2.

3. Players in good form will be more apt to be loaned or transferred.

General Tips/ Observations:

1. Your players will be more likely to get injured if you simulate games.

2. Initially you can tailor your formation to your squad, but try to get a formation you like and get players for that formation.

3. Asking for more money from your Board can help, but it often is not much money, so I wouldn't do it unless you are just a few million short of getting a player.

4. Don't get ""Pokemon Syndrome"" and press A as fast as possible when you are between games and news bulletins keep popping up. Players will often ask you to play them or sit them after the news flashes, and it can really help to listen to them for just one game.


I will update this as things come to mind, but please feel free to comment with more tips/observations/questions or if you disagree with anything I said.

If you take only one thing out of this, I hope it is to avoid old players and buy yound players, even though they will have lower initial ratings. I consider 26 to be the cut-off point where I won't buy above that."	t5_2smu8	True

1372398431.0	1h8dsh	The most frustrating thing on Fifa	parzx	73	26	33	To me the most frustrating thing on Fifa isn't David Luiz, 90th minute scripting, passing around the back or near post shots, but how retarded players are when it comes to receiving a pass.. One of the first things you learn as a footballer is that you have to move towards the ball, not stand flat-footed waiting for it to come to you.. In Fifa, when you make a pass, it somehow freezes the receiving player and lets the defender just run onto it.. It's just horrible.. Not everyone has a Xabi Alonso in their team to deliver the ball right to the feet of their players, so the player receiving the ball needs to actually go and get the ball, instead of standing behind the fucking defender hoping for the ball to magically phase through them.. You can't be telling me that world-class footballers would just stand behind a defender, allowing them to intercept every pass bound for them.. It frustrates me no end to see my brainless players unable to complete a bloody 5-yard pass.. Also equally frustrating is when a player starts a run and stops halfway, rendering the chipped through pass or ground through ball a gift of possession to the opposition.. I hope that in Fifa 14 the players will actually play like professionals, not high-school football rejects	t5_2smu8	True

I dont play the CPU, I find it predictable and boring and FUT is not my game - so I play Seasons and have done that since the release of Fifa12. My Win/Loss ratio is 1:1 and I have never won division 1, nor do I expect to. I have enjoyed the game anyway.

But there is something about Fifa13 that really grinds my gears and it is not the game itself, it is how people play it. I play Dortmund, Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and other non-5 star teams. Mainly because I find it tedious to play every match against Ronaldo and Messi. And that is ok, I still enjoy the game and people can play 5 star if they want to. But this time around all matches I play follows a simple template. My opponent has one strong, fast striker and then a parked bus. I hate it. It is boring, predictable and I admittedly cant beat that. I have tried parking the bus, but that doesnt work for me - I play balanced/attacking and I try to create the game through posseision but it is not working for me in Fifa13.

I realized that I dont enjoy the game anymore, not because the game is bad, but because I hate the way people play it. When my wife pointed out I was in a bad mood after each playing session I did the only right thing for me. I pulled the disk from the drive and broke in as many pieces as possible. What a relief.

So here it goes, it's a shooting tip I highly doubt many people know about. 

When taking a shot **IN SPACE WITH THE BALL ROLLING AWAY FROM THE PLAYERS BODY**, point the left stick in the opposite direction you're shooting the shot, once the player is in the shooting animation. It keeps the shot low, with immense power. It is highly useful for longshots when executed perfectly. **It works best when holding LT when taking a shot with decent power**, that's just a normal power shot, but holding back adds something extra to it. 

So here's an example as to how I'd do it if I was shooting to the right goal using Xbox controls: LT+B+direction you want to shoot (I'm going to use a clock for direction, and I'm aiming at 4), power bar appears, once in the shooting animation, switch the stick to the direction of 8 whilst still holding LT the whole time. 

Try it out in the arena for a few minutes to get the hang of it with some longshots. I have known about this since FIFA10, but have never heard somebody else speak about it so I'm unsure whether people know about it or not. 

It also adds some power to finesse shots, but of course it's toned down now in FIFA13. With the finesse shot I've noticed that the player also does a different animation sometimes, where he really opens his body up to accentuate the finesse shot.

Sorry if this is a bad explanation, I can expand further if needs be. It's certainly not the efficient shot, but it's a hidden one (I think) nonetheless and results may be quite sporadic. 

Try it out and please tell me how you get on.

1358064173.0	16hffc	Full review of the World XI	zipko	41	8	17	"I wrote this up for a fan site for FIFA 13, figured I'd post a copy here as well for the reddit community. Hopefully this helps some of you in deciding whether it's worth shelling out the coins for this year's TOTY.

**Casillas:** Of the 11, Casillas is the one I can least justify the high price tag associate with owning a TOTY player. The reason for this has to do with the way keepers work in FIFA 13, and how goals are typically scored. Goals in FIFA tend to fall into various scripted categories. There's low finesse that you get from tapping B twice; sprinting blasts from 20-30 yards out; cutbacks; shots taken running horizontally across goal. It seems in this game that if you do one of these semi-scripted actions then you're going to be guaranteed to score no matter who the keeper. Even TOTY Casillas can't stop a low hard shot. You won't really see anything spectacular out of him that would save you from these obvious goal scoring chances. In UT it seems that there's some obvious bad keepers, ones who let just about everything through, but among the good ones there's very little difference. I don't consider TOTY Casillas to be any better or worse than Hart, Buffon, Lloris and so on. He's a status symbol in your squad and nothing more.

**Dani Alves:** The last time I used Dani Alves was back in FUT 11, where I played him at RM in a 3412 squad. I'm happy to report that he hasn't lost a step in 2 years, and can still properly fill an attacking role for those who prefer 3 defender formations. As a RWB with the proper teammates around him you can get him to 9 chemistry at RM. Very nice shot, good passing and pace that will give defenders fits all match. In a defensive role, he's excellent at tracking back on the ball. Give a striker a 10 yard head start from the halfway line and Alves will still run him down and make the tackle. He's my saving grace to cover for me when I get hit on an unexpected counter and need to catch an attacker who's already behind my backline.

**Sergio Ramos:** Ramos is probably the least noticeable of the players in the World XI. But for a CB, it's usually the sign of a good match if no one's talking about you after it. He does his job in defense flawlessly, never out of position and never missing a tackle. His pace prevents him from being a liability in defense, and despite his high attack work rate I never see him out of position. Of the two CB's in TOTY he's the better defender. At 6'0"", he's also a solid target man in the box for corners. He's got his share of headed goals for me and provides that rare combination of pace and strength that's hard to find in a defender.

**Pique:** Don't be fooled by the card, Pique is a CDM not a CB. He's probably the most interesting of the TOTY defenders in that he plays such a unique style compared to what you would expect from his position. The fullbacks both do what fullbacks do in supporting the attack while being quick enough to track back on defense. Ramos is a prototypical CB. But it's with Pique that you get something interesting. When he's in defending mode he's easily Ramos' equal. His pace isn't as big an issue as others would make out. He won't catch up to an attacker already past him, but he can keep up with all but the fastest running side by side. When he's defending he also maintains very good position in coverage. The tackling radius for Pique is gigantic. It's reminiscent of TOTY Puyol from FUT 11. If someone dribbles the ball within 5 feet of Pique then he's taking it off the attacker. You never see those unlucky bounces where your defender will crash into an attacker only for the ball to squirt out forward and make for an easy breakaway. However, for all the defensive accolades I can give, Pique does have the tendency to roam. He spends about 50% of his time pressed forward into a midfield role. This can be good in some ways, as he gives your midfield an easy outlet for a safe pass back. In keeping possession he'll provide an extra midfield option and puts you almost into a 3 defender formation at times when he's forward and your fullbacks are back. If you play with 5 defenders, Pique is the ideal option for your center CB.

**Marcelo:** Dani Alves with less pace and better dribbling seems to be the best I can describe Marcelo. He's instrumental in providing width to my attack. I play my TOTY in a 4312 and rely heavily on the fullbacks to cover the wings, Marcelo does this just as well as any midfielder or winger could. Dribbling with this TOTY, which is something I'll talk a lot about with the midfielders, is a dream with Marcelo. His tackling is the weakest of the 4 TOTY defenders, but he has plenty of pace to be able to track back in coverage and at least get in the way. His shooting in the box is excellent, however he does have the downside in this regard of being left footed. You won't be able to cut in on the right as is popular with wingers. For crossing, his attempts are serviceable although admittedly I don't do very much crossing so I can't provide too much insight as to which TOTY players would be best for serving balls into the box. One final comment before leaving the defenders, these four all have high attack work rates. When building a team, make sure that any TOTY defenders that you're using are properly paired with other defensive players that have more of a defensive work rate. If you play an entire backline of high attack rate players then your defense will be dangerously too far downfield. When I use the TOTY my defense will often be 10 yards past the midfield line. 90% of the goals I concede are on counters directly related to my defense being pushed too far forward.

**Xabi Alonso:** Alonso is the weakest of the 3 midfielders, but also the cheapest by a good amount. But don't call him overrated. The lack of pace in this midfield means these players are better suited for those who like short, tight passing and dribbling through the defense rather than 1-2 passes and through balls. Xabi has the defensive ability of Marcelo or Alves when it comes to making a solid tackle. He's not quite on a CB level like Pique or Ramos, but if you need an anchor to your midfield this is your best option. When comparing the 3 midfielders, they can all pass, they can all defend well, and they all have amazing long shots. They'll bury anything within 30 yards if you give them an open lane. The big difference between Alonso and the other two is that Alonso doesn't have the dribbling ability of Xavi and Iniesta. With only 2 star skill moves, if you want to attack with Alonso you're going to have to pass to do it. He's still very dangerous in the attack, and a opposing defense better be sure to always have a man in front of Alonso anytime he has the ball. If you're dribbling forward with no defender marking you then just rip a shot and laugh at the lazy defense giving up such an easy goal. For those who have seen my other player reviews, I'll finish by saying that I still think Yaya Toure is the best CDM in the game. But Toure's card isn't blue, so there's always that.

**Xavi:** The middle of the 3 midfielders in terms of rank, I think Xavi is by far the best value of the group. He is noticeably better than Alonso in that he has perfect ball control to go along with great passing and long shots. Xavi is also considerably cheaper than Iniesta, while being a very similar player. Slightly slower than Iniesta, it won't be an issue if you're playing a ball control game with a steady buildup. Xavi can walk through a defense single-handedly with his tight dribbling and spot on passing. His one time passing brings back the ping-pong days that everyone complained about before first touch was introduced. No complaints though when it's your own team that can pick apart a defense with pass and move tactics. Xavi is also well rounded on the defensive front, and will never be a liability playing in the center of your midfield. Like Alonso, if you find yourself walking towards goal with no defender in front of you, don't hesitate to shoot. This midfield all share very high long shot ratings and can bang them in with ease.

**Iniesta:** Iniesta is absolutely the perfect CAM. He has it all, dribbling (4 star skills), passing, shooting with just enough pace that you can even be sweaty with him. His ball control is even better than Xavi's, and if you walk downfield holding LT you'll be amazed at how helpless he makes anyone who gets in his way look. It really takes a double team to take the ball off Iniesta. A single defender can't stop him. When I want to run a One Man Army and just try to beat an entire defense without passing Iniesta is my first choice to do it. You can give him the ball at the midfield line and just let him step through the midfield. Like the other CMs, if a defender doesn't step up once you get into space behind the midfield then just let rip. I'm not sure exactly of the workrates of the midfielders, but I have noticed that Iniesta tends to push forward more than the other two. This will help him in a role as a CAM or CF and is something to keep in mind when choosing the players around him in your squad. The one downside to Iniesta is that he's the most expensive of the TOTY midfielders. This high price tag is largely due to his position change to CM instead of LM, as well as a lower drop rate than Xavi and Alonso. If coins aren't an issue then Iniesta is the must have of these midfielders.

**Falcao:** Falcao is somewhat the Ramos of the attack in this team. What I mean by that is that Falcao will do his job flawlessly all game, but often with little recognition because of how much attention the rest of the TOTY draws around him. I liken him to IF Ibrahimovic as a striker. He has very good dribbling, and an excellent shot while being all the target man one could ask for with his 99 heading accuracy. Falcao's secret weapon that you should be sure to give attention to is his 5 star weak foot. Opponents tend to naturally shade to a strikers strong foot to block oncoming shots. With Falcao, you can cut back to the left and be just as effective, often catching the defense by surprise and getting a wide open lane. While people often tend to think of Falcao as a target man for crosses, be sure to take advantage of his dribbling. He has 4 star skill moves and his control is very responsive.

**Messi:** EA's poster child, Messi is well worth his near 3 million coin price tag. He might as well have all 99 stats, he's such a noticeable improvement over every other player in the game. 4 star skills and dribbling stats that will break ankles, Messi has the ability to destroy a defense even without support. While some criticize his lack of strength, it won't be an issue if you aren't letting any defender touch him. His dribbling is well good enough to pull that off. He can pick his way through a defense untouched, and has an automatic shot that will go in every time without effort. For those who like to skill, it doesn't get much better than this. Shoot from inside the box, outside the box, on the run, facing away from goal... it doesn't matter. Messi hits them from everywhere.... on his left foot. He doesn't have a right, so be sure to get him a look to his strong side. He's automatic to his left, but if you have to pick out weaknesses of a player it's hard to ignore His low rating on his weak foot. He can hit a right footed poke in the box, but not from any kind of range the way Falcao can. Considering that his weak foot shooting is really the only legitimate complaint one can have about him, I'd say Messi is doing quite well in any squad you could make for him.

**Ronaldo:** Saved for last for a reason, this TOTY is without a doubt Ronaldo's show. He's it, TOTY Ronaldo is easily the best player in the game absolutely without weakness. Where to start the accolades, 5 star dribbling, perfect ball control, perfect shooting and passing, 6'1"" with heading that rivals the best clinical CBs and even has a weak foot that won't give a second thought to pulling off a left footed strike from outside the box. I guess if you want to knock something, he doesn't defend, but why are you asking the player who already does absolutely everything else for your team to do that as well? Get 10 defenders and Ronaldo and you're still looking at an amazing team. While there's often argument over real world ability between 1A and 1B in the Ronaldo vs Messi debate, there's really no question in FUT 13. Ronaldo is stronger, faster, better skill moves, taller... the list goes on through every category. Congratulations to you if you can afford his hefty price tag, you'll never complain about struggling to score again. "	t5_2smu8	True

Here's today's thread for the Grand Master Championship of Reddit FIFA.  So so so so many of you have been responding and it's awesome.  If you haven't seen the other two threads and want in on the tournament, comment telling me your console and if you are from:

* West Coast USA
* Central USA
* East Coast USA
* Europe
* Australia/Oceania/Asia

This is important information!  If you haven't told me what region you're in, you won't be placed in groups with people from the same region!

As of now, [here is the tournament](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArAAtYOjrDnidFI4Tlh6SzdpUjF2M0xZVVFjQXZlY1E&amp;usp=sharing).  The first tournament is XBOX, the second is PS3.  If you see ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT LET ME KNOW.  It's been a bit difficult keeping track.  Check spelling and all that jazz.

Next, [here are the rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJEapzOleNOvyFrAN1yNL3fVYGwbuy-OJ5KXKxVDuXc/edit).  Look through them and be familiar.  Also notice some potential changes at the end of them.  Let me know what you think should be done about the last 2 amendments!

Also, if you don't want to read a wall of text for rules and want to hear about the amendments from me directly, then [hello Reddit](http://youtu.be/w9TpCJDccPk)!

Do you guys want a new Subreddit for this?

Also how do you feel about splitting the tournaments up by regions themselves?

Basically, comment on this post if you:

1. Haven't signed up
1. Need to tell me where you are located
1. Want to give me input on rule amendments and have any other thoughts you want to share.

Also, if you are signing up or telling me where you are, an upvote means I've looked at it and have gotten it down!  I want to reduce clutter.

Whew.  Hope this covers all the bases.  Thanks for commenting and upvoting this so it is visible!  Remember, you have until Thursday at Noon MY TIME (east coast USA) to get on the excel spreadsheet!

This is the simply a bad simulator of football. I loved 12 and played it fanatically throughout the year, so much so that when the new game came out I had it preordered and counted down the days to release. Since the release I have been massively underwhelmed.

The game is unbalanced. It rewards simple play as much as it rewards creative, intelligent or methodical play. An organised defense and a vigilant player is vulnerable to the most basic over the top through ball to a ridiculous degree. Even if you are aware the opponent only plans to lob it through to a pacey Welliton or Pato the game can force you to miss the ball and allow them to score.

I know nobody enjoys a rant and I am sorry to submit one. The game is more frustrating than enjoyable, not because the player is bad (I have 6 Div 1 FUT titles) but because the game is poorly designed to allow anyone to win. It is no longer a serious simulation and I'm done with it.

I saw someone else do this and it looked like fun.  These players are on XBOX.  I'm going to make you work a little harder though!  Rather than tell you which players I have, I'd like everyone to do three things.

1. Tell me about the hole in your squad you are trying to fill.
2. Show us your current FUT record
3. Show/Tell us something nice you've done for someone recently.  Visual proof is a big plus.  Doesn't have to be on Reddit or Fifa.  Just want nice people to get nice players.

EDIT: **As it turns out, I have to be friends with you on XBOX to do this.  When I ask for a DM, send me your XBL name and I'll friend request ya.  Then you'll auction a cheap bronze player for a lot of coin.  I'll send you a trade offer with a player.  Unless you can think of a better way.**

* If someone is pace abusing hardcore and I need a goal I'll start spamming lobbed through balls.

Don't get me wrong I like some of them, but a lot of them are without any information or substance. And there seems to be post after post with the same theme. Most now have 0 points because I gather a lot of people also think the posts are irritating. 

If you want help with your squad, tell us where you're struggling, what players aren't working for you etc. This way we can offer actual advice rather than just list the best players for every position. 

I'm not saying don't post, but try and make your posts more interesting. The posts such as ""I have x amount, build me a prem swuad"" are also boring. Tell us what style of play you like, what formation, any key players you like, and what level of players.

1359418251.0	17gna3	Reddit FUT Tournament?	Sarm21	30	3	281	"* **UPDATE: February 02**
The brackets are all up to date. Idle players have been replaced and waitlists have been updated. If all users could please sign up on the website that hosts our brackets (challonge.com), I'd appreciate it. It'll make future tournaments easier to administer. I will definitely not do this again through just reddit - it's too much of a hassle. And please use your reddit username to sign up. 


* **LATEST UPDATE**
Alright I just created the tournament brackets. Unfortunately they had to be limited to 32 for XBOX and 16 for PS3. I gave out spots in the tournament based on first come first serve. Those who were not included will be first on the list for the next tournament. If anybody fails to show up for this tournament, wait-listed players will replace them.

* PS3 Brackets: http://challonge.com/redditfutps3
* XBOX Brackets: http://challonge.com/redditfut360

Please contact your opponent directly through reddit to get his/her gamertag or psn username. Then arrange when you two will play. The loser of the first round matches should pay 2000 coins to the person they were beaten by. The 2nd round loser pays 4000 to the winner, 3rd round pays 8000, etc. I figured this is easier than having somebody hold the money since nobody really trusts anybody else with it. Please try to play your game within the next 3 days.

* **UPDATED**
Once the tournament table is out, each of you will have to contact your opponent via reddit to arrange adding each other on the console and making time to play. You should then play one game against each other and post the results back on reddit as a picture of the final score.

&gt;1. Who gets to be home team is up to you to decide before your game against your oponent

&gt;2. 2000 coin buy in

&gt;3. If any player attempts to photoshop the results of his match, both players will be out of the tournament - guaranteeing automatic advancement for whoever their next match up would have been.

&gt;4. All games will be given 3 days to be played. In case somebody can't play within those 3 days, we can try to work around it. If it becomes too difficult, the person unable to play within the alotted time period will be given an automatic loss (out of the tournament).

&gt;5. The prize money (coins) will be alotted as follows: 1st place - 75%, 2nd place - 25%.

&gt;6. Training cards on players (to improve their attributes) are NOT allowed. IF cards are allowed.

&gt;7. If a game ends in a tie, it must be continued to extra time and penalties.

&gt;8. The winner is responsible for the EA tax on the prize money (meaning the loser only transfers over what he's owed. He must not include the tax amount.)

his name is camara, he is from senigal and plays for valenciennes in ligue 1.
he's 6'2 or 6'3 so in CDM he will win many headers in attack and defence.
he has high strength and easily pushes attackers of the ball
with 83 pace he is quick enough to get foward and back easily, plus 90 or so stamina so he can play many games in a row.
he's 21 years old so he has time to develop.
because he's only 70 overall you can buy him fairly cheap.
to me he is like a cheap version of yaya toure
i like to play him with a high defensive medium attack work rate so he can help out the defence, but when my CAM is on the ball he will make runs through the defence, and with his high strength and pace not manny CB's can catch him.
other players i would recommend and marco rojas (A league), Trapp (bundesliga) and victor (liga do brasil)
if this post does well i may do another post on a different player

So now i have a blank slate, but a good 84 rated team. 
Obviously i've steam rolled people in seasons mode, because ive had a much better team. I know its a dick move, but i wanted to try out my theory.

But more interestingly, in cup matches (which are open to anyone, and you're equally likely to come across a noobie, or a veteran of the game) i've faired equally well...

In the last 30 games or so, i havent had any frustrating matches where im screaming at my own players, because they cant control the ball, or feel like my players are running/turning/reacting a lot slower than they should be. Which was something i seemed to be getting a lot of on my primary account, games i felt i had a big disadvantage in, and could tell straight away my team wasnt going to perform correctly.


So my thinking is that scripting is in the game in some form. I can instantly tell when my team isnt playing how it should, i've played enough games to know and study how my players should play. So when they arent doing that, to me its glaringly and instantly obvious.

I remember thinking on my primary account after i reached 100 games or so, that i was getting more and more of what i believed to be scripted games.

I recommend anyone who can to try it out and see what they think. XBL give out a free month for new accounts, and fifa doesnt require any online pass keys.

*I've invested 950,000 in the market, bringing my total down to 200,000 but successfully made 102,000 back over night. at this rate, it will be close, but I should be able to make the mark*

LEAVE YOUR GAMERTAGS IN YOUR POST!!!!!

i've recently had a lot of success trading over the past month and finally made it past 1 million coins, so i've challenged myself to get to 2 million by January 31. 

Since no one needs 2 million coins after the market crash, i've decided if i accomplish my goal, i will reward 3 lucky redditors. 

I will not be purchasing any new players or teams during the month, only contract cards to keep playing with my team. The only purchasing i will be doing it buying for my trading purposes.

If i accomplish it (i'll give weekly updates starting Sunday 1/13/13) by midnight EST on the 31, i'll give away 45,000 coins.

The Catch... you have to successfully guess one of the following.
My Favorite Player - 15,000
My Most Hated Player - 15,000
My Leading Goal Scorer (all gold players) - 15,000

If two or more people guess the same player, you're gamer tags will be put in a hat and pulled at random. Everyone gets one guess, put your gamer tag at the beginning of your post. I'll announce winners on Feb 1, if I accomplish with a picture of the coin amount.

"	labigmac	31	8	26	"I don't generally post, but I felt that I should be sharing this. I've read a lot about scripting/momentum (match-fixing) on reddit and on other forums online, so I decided to conduct a simple experiment to prove or disprove it.

Before I say anything about the study, let me qualify myself for it. I've been playing Fifa a long time, since Fifa 98. My online level is at 50 (only been online since fifa10), I've reached division 1 on Fifa 12 and Fifa 13 with my wins being 10 times more than my losses. I like playing on career mode more than playing online, I've been playing on legendary since Fifa 10. 

So the study itself, involves an entire season in career mode with a strong team and requires rematch ability in career mode. I played as Bayern Munich (2nd Season) , Inter (2nd Season) and NewCastle (4th season after signing Messi) . The reason I chose later seasons was so that I could strengthen my team. During the season you get to a point where your team is on top of the league and you play a team which is relegation threatened. Eventually in one of these games, the game throws a shocking defeat at your team i.e. you lose to this relegation threatened or lower level team (cup). This is where the study starts: Using the rematch option, you play this same game 'n' number of times. If there wasn't any match-fixing by the game, you would expect to win this game 9 times out 10, since you are the much stronger team. What actually happens is the near opposite. You win 30% of time and lose/tie the rest. You can try changing your formation and doing things differently, but it will not matter, you will lose 70% of the time. 

The other study done during a season is getting yourself to a point where you lead by one goal with 10 minutes left. Note the number of tackles, possession and number of shots taken by the AI in this 10 minute period. You will find this heavily weighted towards the AI in 90% of the cases. 

Repeat for World Class and professional and you'll notice that these numbers change in your favour.

What I have concluded is that the AI cheats to make things interesting, the incidence of cheating increases with difficulty. EA did not put enough time into making the AI smart, instead it uses scripting/momentum to turn things around. Sad. I feel it destroys an otherwise good game. 

Reading this over again, I feel like I may have vented a little bit, but what I would like to see is this experiment repeated by other people so that we can have more data points.

It's getting to the point where I am really annoyed, even though I can defend against it effectively most of the time.  At that point, a lot of it becomes about luck, as AI is  horrible&amp;inconsitent when it comes to responding to those things.  

As if that's not bad enough, a lot people in higher division tend to be jack ass to you too.  I remember this guy making a ridiculous 40m lobbed through ball that would have been an easy intercept if it wasn't for the fact that the game lagged to the point of slide show.  The keeper made a great save only to have it deflect right back at the striker for an easy goal.  The goal was a total fluke, but he decided to do a long celebration, watched the entire replay, and decides to play keepball for the rest of the first half(the goal happend in first 15min).

At that point, I was determined to take a shit on him and humiliate him the worst way possible.  I quickly scored a goal in the 2nd half, and proceeded to score 2 more.  I returned the favor by making him watch long celebration/replay, and played keep ball for about the same time as he did.  After the game finished, I made him watch the entire replay at the end.

I started playing FIFA13 as online noob this year, and I never really thought I'd be this rude about playing a video game.  I skip replays and celebration 99% of the time unless it was a really amazing goal or I was provoked.  All I can say is, playing against jerks really brings out the rage in me sometimes.

I am getting to the point where I am winning like 2-3 matches and losing 1, and I am slowly losing interest in the game.  I face very good opponent maybe 1-2 per 10 game, where they will try to build up plays and play well. I love playing those kinds of games, and I am actually happy when someone genuinely beats me.  I am also surprised that there really aren't that many good skillers even at higher divisions... I was expecting to get my ass handled by the kind of skillers you see on youtube compilations, but that hasn't happened to me so far.  For the most part, the game will look like me keeping possession, skilling&amp;scoring some goals, and block onslaught of lobbed through passes from counter.  rinse and repeat.

When I comment on one of the FIFA subreddits it is usually to discuss tactics or give advice on formations/chemistry but today I wanted to start looking at the diverse mental impact that E-currency, in our case coins/fifa points can have on a game and its player base.

I have been a FIFA player since World Cup '98. Prior to that I played world cup italia '90 on my mega drive, in summary: I'm football and video game mad, which explains my love for this particular franchise. I wasn't a massive fan of FUT at first but in April 2010 I decided to get into it and see what happened. In short, what happened was I lost a lot of real life money buying points for packs.

People buy packs for several reasons. Mostly however, I believe people buy packs in an attempt to ""pull"" an In form or seriously good rare card. The logic behind this is usually ""well the longer I go without an IF/expensive rare the sooner I'm going to get on!!"" This is exactly the mindset I used to take, and it is the mindset EA wants you to have.

I have gotten several good to decent players out of packs, Thiago Silva, Kompany and ibrahimovic in FIFA 12 and I have gotten essentially nothing in FIFA 13. The reasons for this are pretty obvious, I have purchased A LOT less packs in FIFA 13. Infact, I am mostly using my 2 free packs a week from pre-order and season ticket and that's it (as well as packs for winning tournys). The bottom line is, it is paying real money on top of the cost of a game is insane. You are literaly better off buying 300K+ coins from a coin seller because that is guaranteed product for your investment. You could spend double what it would cost you on coins for packs and make nothing. Maybe you'd pull 1-2 decent 40K ish players but the chances of pulling IF's is so damn low.

We want to believe, and there's nothing wrong with that, but the reality is the chances of getting these players is extremely low and IMO if you want guaranteed coins you should stop wasting money on gambling on packs and just buy the coins and build your squad and be happy.

TL;DR - Buying packs can be fun, but expensive. If your goal is to pull an expensive card to build a great team, save money, buy coins.

I couldn't figure out how to get him back from his loan, so I was essentially out of keepers.  I could have signed a young player from my youth squad, but that would have been a pretty poor overall player, so I figured I would let my assistant coach pick a player to be goalie and give it a shot.

Neymar was chosen from my squad to be keeper, and since I play all of the games, I figured I would give it a shot.  Well, the weirdness continued.  Neymar takes my corner kicks when he is on the field, so all of a sudden my goalie was taking my corner kicks, it was wild!

I began to get adventurous, and would go end to end with Neymar, it was pretty awesome.

Anyway, when my goalie was back from his injury, he still wasn't 100%, and I had an upcoming game against Celtic in the Champions League.  Knowing I should be able to beat them, I risked the game with Neymar starting in goal.  I was up 1-0 with 30 mins to go, I figured I should put in a real goalie in case I was challenged.  I subbed my goalie in for Neymar, flipped Neymar back into the game at Left Midfield, and all of a sudden I had two goalie kits on the field at the same time!  Lasted the rest of the game, it was pretty funny.

Give it a shot, it is pretty easy to do!"	t5_2smu8	True
1350480768.0	11mn39	Tips to win more in Seasons	Gameraka	21	0	7	"Hi guys,

In my second season in *Head to Head*, now *Seasons*, I thought it was time to *give some tips to those who struggle*. 

My first tip is to avoid urgency. I see many players applying too much pressure as soon as the game kicks off. This is not the best way to play Fifa 13 if you plan to dominate higher divisions. When you play like this, you may be beating some Division 10-7 players but you will only lose tired if you play like that in higher divisions against better players. **You must first get to know your opponent before you apply your own tactics.** 

You must play *patiently*. I suggest you to take a look at your opponent for the first 15 minutes where you shouldn't be taking too much risk. Just try to stop his offense and try to keep the ball as long as you can. Now there are two types of players when you have the ball possession. Type 1 will just sit back and let you pass around, the second type is the aggressive type.

Type 1 is more dangerous. If he is sitting back, this means he knows what you are doing. At this stage, do not send all your players to the attack. You will only allow your opponent to counter attack. And in Fifa 13, counter attack is really effective. So you should always be prepared for a counter attack when you have ball possession.

Type 2 player which is aggressive is easier unless you don't know how to pass the ball around. Try to make a couple of short passes and then suddenly lob the ball to the opposite wing where your winger is all free. Try to find spaces and once you do, make sure you pass to one of your stronger and faster players. If you can't find spaces, don't try too hard or you will lose the ball and you will be caught off-guard again. 

If you find the space against an agressive player, do not hesitate. Once you have the space, go to the wings and cross. Never try to pass too much outside your opponent's box. That won't work against aggressive players. You will only lose the ball again and give him a chance to score.

To sum up, **First 15 minutes is critical**, watch your opponent and see which type of player he is, when you have the possession. 

See you soon with more tips... In my second post, I will go into ""Where to cross and where to aim your headers""....

1363553282.0	1ahe9h	I've been working on a FIFA14 wishlist which includes a lot of unique features, such as customized supporters sections and deeper storylines (with cut-scenes, even!). I figured I'd share it for others to see, and possibly even contribute to.	digiskunk	23	5	33	"**My FIFA14 Wishlist (excluding online game modes)**

01. Abolish the current league 'prestige' system and replace it with a new, lenient system that calculates the league's level of prestige based on league’s overall average. 

02. When your Virtual Pro gets red carded in the ""Be A Pro"" mode of Career Mode, eliminate the glitch that practically forfeits the match (when you get red carded, the match instantly ends and the other club is awarded 3 goals for absolutely no reason). Replace it with a simulation system instead.

03. When you play a match in ""Be A Pro"" mode, fix the glitch that keeps your player in the match for extensive periods of time regardless of his level of fatigue (currently, you can play a match where a player has exactly 0 fatigue left and the manager still won't take him off the pitch). Instead, make it mimic the mode where you play as the full squad.

04. Add more boots. Also, create a “Create A Boot” system that allows you to create and customize your own boots.

05. Create a flexible system that allows you to create and customize your club’s own alternative third kit. In real soccer/football, clubs frequently introduce new club kits; wouldn’t it be awesome to have the option to create and customize your own?

06. In the “Be A Pro” mode of Career Mode, enhance the manager AI. Currently, managers make silly and unrealistic transfer moves that don’t necessarily meet the needs of the club. Also, managers should be able to change formations prior to a match (as well as mid-game) to try and gain a tactful advantage. At the moment, all managers in the game just stick to the club’s default formation regardless of how much of a disadvantage it puts them in.

07. Add more audio commentary. I’m tired of the announcers repeating the same silly things over and over again from games past.

08. Create more stadiums. Seriously.

09. Referees are often assigned kit colors that either directly mimic or resemble the kit colors of an opposing team. Establish a system that considers which colors each club is wearing so that the referee can stand out independently on the pitch with a unique color of his own (as opposed to blending in as a player).

10. Enhance the “storyline” aspect of career mode by not only adding more stories/interactions, but by also allowing the player to respond in a certain way (i.e. if a manager holds a post-game press conference, give players the options to answer questions in a variety of different ways - each answer potentially yielding an alternative/different outcome).

11. In career mode, enhance the scouted prospects in the youth academy by assigning them with more than just 1 position. It makes no sense to create a game full of real-life players that have multiple positions albeit having generated youth players that can only play 1 position.

12. In career mode, give the role of captaincy more significance. In the real sport, captains are vitally important; however, in FIFA13, the role of captain serves absolutely no purpose. Captains in the game should have much higher chemistry with other players on the field and given more on-field abilities.

13. Add more cut-scenes and post-game footage. I’m tired of seeing the same exact scenes after winning a Cup take place. Create 3 or 4 variations, each of them differing in length and content, and randomize it for the sake of the player’s mere enjoyment. Also, add additional commentary for Cup matches, thus embracing and assuring the importance of the Cup match value.

14. Add an option in the Virtual Pro accessories section that allows you to customize your Virtual Pro so that he only has gloves and/or long-sleeves in the winter season and/or ""snowy"" condition. This way, you don't have to do it manually and it adds some more ""pizazz"" to your look.

15. Create a new attribute: ""Diving Tendency."" It'll allow players like Neymar to play more like they do in real life.

16. In the ""Be A Pro"" mode of Career Mode, allow your Virtual Pro to actually sign a contract with your own choice of wage and length (seasons); also, allow your pro to enter free agency, where you can receive numerous offers from any club interested in your services.

17. Reinstate the ""Player-Manager"" option in Career Mode, but tweak it so that there's more options/features that are exclusive to this career mode choice. Also, allow players to continue their player-manager role from club to club (FIFA12 wouldn't allow you play as player-manager with any other club than the one you started with).

18. As Career Mode plays out season after season, allow managers to retire and be replaced with either new CPU generated ones, or other skippers not currently under contract. Seriously, do you expect to see Sir Alex Ferguson managing in 2022?

19. Give managers their own personalities; some may be more offensively driven whilst others may be more balanced, or defensive.

20. Rename the ""World Championship"" appropriately to the World Cup like it is in real life. Also, have lotteries that decide which country the Cup will be held in next; if it's to be held in the U.S., then have the majority of the matches played in the MLS stadiums, if it's in Germany, play in German stadiums, so on and so forth...

21. Create supporters sections in stadiums where you can clearly see more rowdy fans who actually set off smoke bombs after goals, play drums and chant/sing, throw confetti, etc. Give the ""die-hard"" supporters for clubs their own place in the stadium to help establish a more friendly (or menacing) home-field ""presence."""	t5_2smu8	True

I'm talking about situations just outside the penalty area. Normally the opposition team has 10 men behind the ball in that area. You can't play through balls as it's too close to the keeper, and you can barely pass the ball around as as soon as you take a touch you've got opposition players surrounding you. 

I feel like if you take an early lead you are in such a good position, so many time i've just sat back, intercepted a pass after withstanding pressure, run half the length of the pitch, through ball to a quick striker and he's in on goal.

Personally, I don't see the appeal of using one of the top teams, as there is no improvement to be made. This is going to be a list of some of the players that I bought that are absolutely amazing.

* **Rodrigo** is the first player that I would like to talk about. He is a Spanish striker from SL Benfica, 77 overall. His listed potential on [this site](http://paulvi.nl/fifa/) is only 86, but I have him at 88 and counting. He has scored a ridiculous number of goals so far this season, and I will have him for probably another 3-4 years before he gets old, and I want to sell him. While he is quite expensive, he is definitely worth it, and when I sell him I will make triple my money back.

* **Taarabt** is the next player that I want to talk about. He has 5 star skills, which is a HUGE bonus for anybody, whether or not they generally use skill moves because it means that his ball control and dribbling skills are top notch. He is a little bit older than Rodrigo (23 years old), but he is worth the 4 years that I will get out of him. His listed potential is only 83, but I have him at 85 already. I run a 4-3-3, and use him right in the center of the pitch.

* **Gündogan** is a CM coming from Borussia Dortmund at only 21 years old. He has 4 star skills, which is another huge bonus, and he is an absolute monster on the pitch. I have scored some insane goals with him from dribbling around inside the box and creating a chance for him. His speed is also great, as my style of play revolves mostly around a through ball to a player making a run, and forcing a 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper.

* **De Gea** is without doubt my favorite goalkeeper on both Ultimate Team and Career Mode. He is pretty expensive because he is excellent, young, and has a high potential, but it is *so* worth it. Some of the saves that he makes are completely ridiculous, and he is one of the instrumental forces on my team.

* **Marcelo** is a LB from Real Madrid. Although he is 24, and I will only have 3 or 4 years with him, he was well worth the cash that I spent. He is an absolute rock at the back, and with his high attacking workrate, I have scored multiple goals with him down the pitch. Although his potential is only listed at 85, I have him at 87 already.

* **Diego Capel** is another Spaniard, although he plays at the LW spot. Him, paired with Rodrigo, makes for one of the best offenses on Fifa 13, in my opinion. I first used the two of them together on Ultimate Team with my cheap Spanish squad, and decided to bring them down to West Ham. Again, he is relatively old to start off (24), but the past 2 years with him have been outstanding. As I said before, a lot of my goals come from a quick through ball down the middle, and he can both give those passes to Rodrigo for an assist, or take on the goalkeeper in a 1 on 1 and score.

* **Ekiza** is a CB (and another Spaniard). He is one of my favorite CBs on the game, in that he is such a rock at the back. *Nothing* gets past him. He makes so many interceptions and tackles that the opposition almost never gets a chance at goal while I keep him on the pitch.

These are just some of the players that I have purchased so far in my West Ham Manager Career Mode. All of them are absolutely incredible, and I would recommend each and every one of them for anybody planning to start a Manager Career Mode. Thanks!"	t5_2smu8	True

1364814185.0	1beyo3	i've been requested to do a thread about making up to 150K a week on trading, all trading related questions are welcome	gijsdaboss	23	6	29	"i can make about 150K profit in trading a week, spending just an hour a day on it, but if i were to put more time into it i could make as much as 200K to 250K a week. but first to find a good player to trade in he must have a couple of things:

1. there must be no more than 6-7 pages of that player, otherwise the competition will be too big and your players won't sell since there'll be a lot more cheaper players

2. make sure that the player that you are going to do trading in has a lot of varying prices, you'll make more with a player that reaches 900 coins in an open bid than a player who is selling for the same in open bids as some of the BIN prices

you'll also will need to set a maximum to wich you are going to buy, for me it's 1500 coins since i sell for 1800 coins BIN so theres enough room for profit, looking at my latest trades, i make about 200-800 coins a player, and sometimes there are more than 40 players sold a day, and sometimes you'll wake up and check the web app only to find that 10 of the 40 players have been bought, OVERNIGHT!!!

just one small  tip: trading goes easier on the web app

also it's easier to start off with a much more desireable player, one that has a lot of people wanting to buy that player

also when you have enough coins, go trading in informs, this will take a LOAD of coins (maybe about 200K if you're doing a cheap player) these are much easier to get a higher price, and offentially they'll all sell with profit because the price of informs goes up over the weeks"	t5_2smu8	True

1362864880.0	19zn25	Personal preferance: An insight by a (relatively) long time FUT player.	BreakTheBat	22	4	35	"Hi guys, I made a post a few days back about buying packs and stated I was planning on doing a few more posts like this, so here's number 2!

In this post I want to outline what I feel is a very important part of any community: Influence. Infulence is obtained by achieving certain things. For example, people on this subreddit are more likely to take the advice of a FUT player who has a fantastic win/loss ratio, or wins Div 1 regularly, than someone who plays for fun/casual. Influence is not to be underestimated, as it is almost soley the cause of all of the ""meta"" conclusions that are drawn by hundreds of people on this subreddit everyday. For example, there is an unbelievable amount of hate for pace, or ""sweaty"" brazillian teams on this sub-reddit, because it's a hot topic. What people fail to acknowledge is that the trend stops with them for the most part because everyone has a different experience.

People come to this sub-reddit for advice, but for the wrong reasons. People come here seeking justification in my opinion. For exmaple ""I really want to buy Odemwingie to use for my BPL team, I'll ask reddit"" The likelyhood is that he/she will be told ""ballotelli is op buy him"" etc etc, which makes him do something he ultimately had no intention of doing, just because someone told him to do it. In my (recent) experience, I purchased and built a team around Robben, tried him in 3 different formations (3-4-2-1, 4-3-3 and 4-3-2-1) and had a really indifferent time. Robben who I purchased for around 268,000, played no better than Di maria, who costs almost a tenth of that, but people on this sub rate robben as one of the best RW/RF/RM's in the game (statistically this is obvious as to why, but stick with me here) but is it worth the extra 1/2 stats in 5-6 locations to not just pick Di maria? I don't think so, but it's what happens!

TL:DR - Try being your own ""influence"" for a few weeks. Buy players and try tactics/formations because you want too, not because of what other people have found. For the most part, everyone plays a unique style and has unique preferances. Find players and teams that suit yours, and enjoy yourself!"	t5_2smu8	True

So I spent today playing FUT for the first time ever. Built a bronze team with a Korean back line and the rest English. I smashed my way through the first few Divisions until I got into Div 3 where I just get demolished by all-gold 100-chem teams.

I don't know what to do next. Keeping up with contract costs for my bronze team is bad enough. How on earth do I save the coins to upgrade to gold players AND afford earn enough coins to buy contracts for them all?

Is there a way I can just play with other people with squads like mine? I tried the Bronze tournament, but it never finds anyone to play against.

They've found a good formula and not much needs to be changed. But what I don't understand is why they can't take all the free time from not needing to work on the gameplay that much and put it into making a good career mode. Granted this year they probably put a lot of time into the skill games, but career mode has needed lots of work for years now and FIFA 13's is just as disappointing as previous years.

They treat it like the actual gameplay, merely tweaking it each year when in reality, it could do with a lot more treatment than that. Some of my biggest gripes with the career mode in FIFA 13 are as follows:



* They've added form and happiness to players, both which can affect a players value and you can pick up some bargains if you find an out of form and unhappy player who wants out. The problem is, to my knowledge, there no way to filter a search for unhappy/out of form players.



* Transfers are still unrealistic, I've seen countless posts on here about players selling for over 100 million in the first window and players moving to clubs for ridiculous fees that would never happen in real life. It reminds me of FIFA 10 when Barcelona signed Stephen Carr in more than one of my career modes.



* Speaking of Barcelona, this brings me on to the ability to trade players. It seems this system can be abused because playing as Stoke, I was able to trade John Walters plus a few million for a Barcelona full back: http://i.imgur.com/4vegN.jpg



* On the topic of trading, it seems that it is the only way to get rid of some players. In my first season I transfer listed a bunch of players I didn't want. Now they weren't world beaters, we're talking low 70's overall rating, some coming to the end of their careers in a season or two, but no one would come in for any of them, not even lower league clubs. These players sat in my reserves for a season and a half before I figured out I could just trade them as part of a deal and 80% of the time the club will accept.



* You can no longer invest in clubs facilities like in FIFA 10. This was a really cool feature, you could improve the stadium which led to more revenue, you could improve training facilities which led to your players not tiring as fast during a game. All these little things really added to the experience and yet by FIFA 11 they were removed.



* There is no player interaction. Every now and then you'll get pop ups from players saying they want to start the next game or that they are unhappy and yet you can't respond to them, you can't interact in any way. Also, what is it with players saying how they want to start the next game despite having low fitness from the last game, it would be stupid to play them, yet if you don't, after the game they'll bitch about it.



* This one could just be my game, but when I search for transfer listed players looking for some bargains, there is never anyone good transfer listed. I'm into my third season and the highest rating for a transfer listed player was 71. It's like the complete opposite of last year when everyone and their mother was transfer listed.




So yeah, this may seem a bit long winded but as someone who doesn't really enjoy playing online and puts 90% of FIFA hours into career mode, the lack of improvement to it is very disappointing. There are plenty more problems I have with career mode but those are just the ones off the top of my head."	t5_2smu8	True
1349790100.0	1170wm	Underrated players in ultimate team	parzx	21	5	59	"Some of the most underrated players I've played with in ultimate team 13(I play with a Dutch/eridivisie hybrid btw)

1. Ricky van wolfswinkel: 76-rated gold striker. all his stats are average at best but in-game it's a whole different story. His positioning, finishing, heading and work rate are all impeccable. Also, incredibly cheap, around 500 coins, what a bargain!!!

2.tim matavz: 74-rated silver striker. He may only have 75 pace and 2*skills but his positioning is great and his finishing is unreal. 4*weak foot meaning you can shoot from anywhere outside the box with either foot and the ball will just rocket in. Incredible shot power.

3.george wijnaldum: 76-rated gold cam. 86 pace, 87 dribbling ad 4*skills! He also has a great shot and a high work-rate. Incredible player for less than 1k.

4.douglas: 77-rated gold center-back. I play a 3 back formation and he is the reason why I can. His heading and strength are incredible. He catches up to attackers and muscles them off the ball easily. He also scores tons of goals from corners.

Who are the most underrated players you've played with?

Everyone had 99 fitness.
Gametime, my squad was extremely slow, sluggish, had no control of the ball, missed 1/3rd of all passes between players, and my goalkeeper only had 2 saves, missing 1 which was a goal because sergio ramos passed an incomplete pass. His goalkeeper? 16 saves, motm. His defense? Outran my ""supposedly"" 90+ pace strikers.
I know this topic comes up often and it's often a 50/50 thing with people thinking it's real and it's not.

1354488338.0	14652s	Dear EA	schnoiper	42	27	27	Sometimes, I struggle to comprehend your game. You stress that you're trying to create realistic football, yet somehow you reward the player who runs up the wings with their 99 pace players and bomb in crosses, not the ones who play careful, build-up football. You dazzle us with new features in your trailers, yet when we buy the game, people play it the exact same way, and nothing changes. Sure, it's easy to add some flashy new moves and jerseys, but it takes a quality company to make a real effort towards correcting your game. You need to stop becoming the Activision of football, and do something about it. And it's not like it's hard to find these issues, because I know that I'm not the first to complain. It may be harder work than simply repackaging the easiest game, but you'll make the people who play the game happy, and hell, more people might buy your game. Show us you're not a money whore, and make a goddamn effort to improve your game. 	t5_2smu8	True

Unfortunately I have been cursed by the career mode freeze bug :( I was just promoted to The Championship and had my sights on Nicola Leali, Mbaye, Lukas Andersen and Yassine Benzia. I had signed a bunch of free agents this season and past season ranging between 1m and 4m and was ready to sell off/keep.  As of now I can play games, but as soon as I go to accept/reject a player the entire game will freeze, woe is me !"	t5_2smu8	True

-How defenders suddenly develop super-speed when chasing after opponents with the ball.. In a straight sprint Puyol outran my Bale.. Just wtf

-How through some amazing rebound or own goal, a goal is miraculously scored in the 45th or 90th minute

-How when playing on World Class or Legendary difficulty any player on the computer's team suddenly gets 99 dribbling and can waltz right through my defense

-How players in game don't reflect their real-life abilities.. Like how on Legendary some 60-rated winger can play like Ribery

-How when you get past the last defender and pass it to someone next to you you get called back for being offside

-How when you use the pass and move button to make a run an opponent can just smash your runner, leaving you without an open pass, and not get a Freekick at all

EDIT: -How man-marking doesn't work at all and how sometimes your 90-rated CB just leaves the opponent with a huge hole to pass into when he fails to mark the attackers closest to goal

EDIT 2: -How rebounds are just magnetically attracted to your opponent's player who isn't running onto the ball but just standing there

EDIT 3: -When your own player blocks your goal bound shot"	t5_2smu8	True

I did this a while back in this thread which received great feedback and thought I would do it again because no doubt some people missed out and there's nothing stopping people who posted in the last one from posting again! I avidly play FIFA UT and surprisingly whilst the game is very fun (But also ridiculously frustrating) I enjoy designing and building teams more than I do playing in game.

The was this works is that you folks just copy and paste the format below (to make it easier for me and to be more efficient in getting the squad to you A.S.A.P) and I will go on Futhead.com and design a team. I will then post it as a reply and you give me feedback till i tweak it till it suits your needs.


**Format:**

* Formation: (Preferred formation(s)/Any)
* Budget: (An allocated budget/Unlimited)
* Platform: (Xbox360/PS3/PC)
* Hybrid: (Yes/No)
* Card Type: (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Mix)
* Specific Players: (Any players essential to the squad [The less there is, the easier it is for me])
* Additional Info: (Any extra notes)


**Example:**

* Formation: 442
* Budget: 180K
* Platform: Xbox360
* Hybrid: No
* Card Type: Gold Only
* Specific Players: V.Kompany and Y.Toure
* Additional Notes: No non-rares, High-Low Work Rates on both ST's

Hopefully you get the idea!
I look forward to the challenges and I hope you like the end results.
All I ask in return is an upvote to the thread to increase visibility, an upvote to the comment linking the final team you are satisfied with and finally I ask that you check out my Youtube Channel full of great FIFA Content! (And subscribe if you like what you see! :D)

An idea was brought up to start a pro club supporters league, where each club specific subreddit gets together a FIFA13 club and we conduct and actual season and tournaments and everything. There is already good interest from r/Gunners, r/ChelseaFC, /r/reddevils[2] and a few other clubs. Every club specific subreddit is welcome to join if you can get together enough people to form a FIFA club.

The league will work like any other league (except the MLS), working off a point system with no playoffs. Each team will play every other team a designated amount of times and at the conclusion, we will have the winners.

All of the more in depth rules will be laid out in the subreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFAClubLeague/[3] ) once we get enough clubs in the league. You can message me with any questions you may have about getting your club up and running.

So, everyone go to your respective subreddits, organize your team, and most importantly, go to http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFAClubLeague/[4] and follow the instructions to sign up.

However, what I am just sick of is the Jekyl Hyde nature of my team.  I usually play the same strategy which is on the conservative side and one game my players will play well.  Good passing, creative plays, good positioning, not allowing speed and volley teams to do there bullshit.  

The next game they can't pass, they can't defend the bullshit, completely out of position. 

That's the start, now pile on a team that can no longer handle passes and they bounce consistently to the opponent.  Every time I do get a successful steal the ball bounces directly back to the opponent.  I get auto switched from where I want to be to the last line defender randomly.  

To put it simply it feels like the AI wants you to lose and is playing against you.  I can accept simply getting beat but it feels like other forces are at work and your play has no bearing on the game.

All 3 of my game generated forwards have Acceleration, Sprint Speed and Finishing above 93, and one of them is even 6'6.


So now my new goal is to accomplish the same success, but with **only** English players. The hardest part is trying to scout the English talent since I can only send 1 scout to England per season.


How is everyone else's manager mode going? and do you have any unique foals sent for your seasons?



  **Update 12/22**
I took over as Athletic Bilbao in the January transfer window of the 2019/20 season. They were in 7th place when I picked them up and I just won the league beating Madrid by 2 points. I won the Euro league against Napoli and the Spanish Cup.  6 months and I won the treble with Bilbao. I don't know if I should move on or build up Bilbao for another year. I also am now the manager of Brazil! woo!

Almost all handballs that are called are occurrences of a player going up for a header and for some reason sticking his hand up in the air like he wants to ask the teacher a question or if it's not that, it's the ball flicking up and happening to hit his elbow with his arm completely by his side. And then when you take a shot from outside the box, the defender half way between you and the goal sticks out a hand completely to the side and strikes it blatantly on the hand, there's no call.    
   
I would play with handballs off but it at least *sometimes* gets the call right. It's just so frustrating that often I've given up a penalty because some stupid handball and then the AI does what I just mentioned and gets away with it (although it sometimes goes both ways)."	t5_2smu8	True

My favourite sorta cheap underrated players in Career mode are:

Victor Wanyama-21 y.o 6'2 Kenyan tank of a CDM, has 89 strength and decent speed and passing.. absolutely rips opposing midfields to shreds.. PRICE: 5-6mil

Luiz Gustavo-25 y.o 6'2 Brazilian midfield monster!! strong, good passing, fantastic tackling and competent longshots make him a bargain at 7mil

Alexander Merkel-21 y.o 5'9 German engine.. Can play anywhere in midfield and is a very balanced player.. Grows rapidly and is constantly improving in all areas of the pitch.. PRICE: 5-6mil

Oussama Assaidi-24 y.o 5'8 Moroccan trickster.. This man is an enigma.. When you look at his rating of 78 he doesn't look like much.. Then you start playing with him, and you discover his speed, 4*weak foot and 5*skills which lead to his ability to dribble through an entire defense by himself.. Then you discover the most wondrous thing of all, his tendancy to pop up from anywhere and score goals.. Whether you dribble from your goal to your opponent's, or simply pass it off to him when he magically appears beside you when you need an option, Assaidi will score goals, and he will score plenty of them..

I did this a while back in this thread which received great feedback and thought I would do it again because no doubt some people missed out and there's nothing stopping people who posted in the last one from posting again! I avidly play FIFA UT and surprisingly whilst the game is very fun (But also ridiculously frustrating) I enjoy designing and building teams more than I do playing in game.
The was this works is that you folks just copy and paste the format below (to make it easier for me and to be more efficient in getting the squad to you A.S.A.P) and I will go on Futhead.com and design a team. I will then post it as a reply and you give me feedback till i tweak it till it suits your needs.


**Format:**

* Formation: (Preferred formation(s)/Any)
* Budget: (An allocated budget/Unlimited)
* Platform: (Xbox360/PS3/PC)
* Hybrid: (Yes/No)
* Card Type: (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Mix)
* Specific Players: (Any players essential to the squad [The less there is, the easier it is for me])
* Additional Info: (Any extra notes)


**Example:**

* Formation: 442
* Budget: 180K
* Platform: Xbox360
* Hybrid: No
* Card Type: Gold Only
* Specific Players: V.Kompany and Y.Toure
* Additional Notes: No non-rares, High-Low Work Rates on both ST's

Basically instead of running alongside pacey players on defense, pick a spot a bit in front of them that you know you can get to first and then hold jockey and wait for them to come to you. They will either dribble straight into you, or be forced to slow down and your defenders will be able to close them down from behind. The pure pacewhores usually don't have too many moves when the sprint-and-cross is taken away and will frequently turn the ball over.

If you are unable to do this because you can't get your defenders back before the opponent sprints past you, you need to play your back line deeper. This means going on defensive or even ultra defensive. On ultra-d there is very little space behind your back line and so if you use the tactic above, you should be able to stop anyone from simply sprinting by you.

One more thing: Having speedy fullbacks and decently tall and fast CB's is extremely helpful when defending against pace-oriented players. These guys are frequently very affordable - just off the top of my head, Ogbonna, Santana, Luiz, Sakho, Kaboul, Boateng, Mangala, Boccheti, Koscielny, Gamberini, Naldo, and Dede can be had for not a lot of money and are excellent defenders in FIFA. Once you apply all the above, you will be able to stop pacewhores and make them actually beat you with skill in order to create decent chances. Good luck!"	t5_2smu8	True

1368526503.0	1eb1f4	How many people in the FIFA leaderboards are cheaters, and how much do they affect the UT economy?	pho-sizzle	15	4	11	"I noticed something interesting in the PC version of UT leaderboard today.  If you take a look at the [3 screenshots](http://imgur.com/JlFJyZr,CbtNewa,vzqGFBf#2), you'll see two different origin account with the same club name ""Leipzig SC"" on top 100 ""match earning"" and ""trading"" leaderboards.  I am guessing that origin account ""chensbsb"" is using the auto-quit cheat (how else would you have a 145270-0 record?) and funneling the coins to origin account  ""Maikireton"".  

I've figured out that pretty much all the match coin leaders are rigged, but I am starting to suspect whether the top traders on leadeboards are basically funneling coins from the money the earned from the exploit.  And considering how much money they have I am wondering just how much impact they have on the market, and whether they may be culprit for PC prices being so high.  If you take the negative profit from all the ""match earning"" leadearboard, we are talking about  1 billion+ extra coins in the market that's injected in the economy by cheating.

Can anybody here shed light on this?"	t5_2smu8	True
1368183135.0	1e28wy	I'm getting worse and worse at FIFA, any tips?	LegitMonkey	14	3	29	"I used to be able to win almost every match in D1 but now I'm having a hard time not losing in D2 (UT btw). I can't get past anyone, seriously not even 1 person. It seems they are always able to tackle me and take the ball from me. I can use a skill move, try to nudge the ball past them, pass the ball to someone else but it doesn't work.

On the other hand, my opponent always gets past me. I can use L2, X or try to time my tackle, but he always nudges the ball past me at the exact right time. A millisecond later I would have the ball but they always pull it off. I have no idea how they do it and no idea of how to defend against it.

My players also never seem to run towards the ball, if I pass  them the ball they just wait until the opponent reaches it first, same goes for when they head a ball into the air, on the other hand, the opponent always has his players run towards the ball.

Then we have those sweaty goals, and passing in general. He always has all of his players mark my players, so I can't pass the ball to anyone. My players always gather around 1 person and let 4 men run wherever they want.

Then we have headers, I never win a header. I can use Falcao or Klose, Naldo or Felipe Santana, but even if he uses Giovinco he will win the header. I don't know how I'm supposed to improve my heading skills.

I also really suck at shooting, or his keeper is amazing. Yesterday I used Müller for a bicycle kick, it was about  8 meters from the goal and incredibly hard, into the top right corner. Yet his goalie managed to punch the ball away, whereas my goalie can't stop a simple header. 

Any help is appreciated, I love playing this game even though it has a lot of flaws, I don't know why I'm suddenly playing so bad."	t5_2smu8	True

1364259384.0	1b0fku	FIFA Soccer 13 Career Mode is the best managerial style game mode that I have ever played. 	TxMayer89	13	5	8	"This is my first year playing FIFA Soccer games, and I bought it mainly because I was an NHL and Madden UT junkie. Eventually however I did become bored with Ultimate Team. I do go back and play it once in a while these days, but there is one game mode I simply can not get enough of: Career Mode.

As I said, I used to play Madden all the time and am specifically a fan of the GM/Career Modes of all sports games. I have never played one that is as impressive as FIFA Soccer 13 Career. The closest second would be Madden NFL 2005 or 2006, but that is distant compared to FIFA. 

The best part for me is the player personality part. I started a career as the manager of the NE Revolution (being from New England), and quickly tried to go and get BPL players to bolster my squad. None of them wanted to play for me. Instead of being upset, I was at first shocked. In Madden, you could give a contract to literally anyone and they will accept it no matter how much and how long. Just the personalities of the players was amazing to me.

Another part that I loved was that players get upset when you don't play them. In Madden, you could literally bench Aaron Rodgers and he won't care. In this, you have backups asking for a chance to play, and it's really refreshing.

I don't know if this is the norm for FIFA Career modes, but I just wanted to share my experience of this great game."	t5_2smu8	True

Seriously. I'm new to FUT in the sense that this years Fifa is the first time I've ever played it with dedication. I must admit its extremely addicting. I started out unsure of how to build a team with good chemistry, but quickly fell in love with aspect of building a team from scratch, making it your own. I built a decent squad of Brazilians but eventually decided to get a little creative. By far my most successful team was one I built with Bundesliga players. I started seeing all these beautifully crafted and powerful teams with players from La Liga and the Premiership and thought... hmmm maybe I ought to develop a team from a league that has a lot more talent depth than the Bundesliga. I sold my squad and started fresh. From there I tried teams from different league's, tried new formations, even built teams that were statistically superior to my first in every way. The problem was, I WASN'T WINNING ANYTHING anymore and I got extremely frustrated, to the point where I almost gave up on FUT all together. Yesterday I just said F--- this i'm going to go back to what worked in the beginning. I sold my squad and started resurrecting the team I was originally successful with, adding a couple tweaks here and there. After going 6-1-0 in my first season back with them I'm convinced that it's all about finding a team that you can get in a groove with. I tried all these different formations, but the moment I switch back to my original 4-1-2-1-2 I saw the championship results I was looking for. Not to mention I was dominating teams that were far more powerful on paper than my own. Sure, I'll probably never own the world's best players but I'm fine with that. FUT isn't just about numbers it's about intangibles. It's about learning your squad's strengths and weaknesses so that the moment a player touches the ball you know exactly what his range of ability is. Am I still going to work my up to purchasing the top tier players, absolutely, but I've learned to value what I have and understand that just about any team can be competitive in the right hands.

Is there a different league or country where discard value players have a bit more agility/pace? Any other tips for a noob moving into day-3 of FUT?

1360358884.0	185l77	I hate how I get punished for EA's shitty servers		12	2	18	"I have never, not even once, quit a game on FUT or seasons intentionally. I have sat through 10-0 demolitions where I felt so humiliated because every touch I took seemed to make me look like a noob, simply to keep my DNF % the highest possible.

Then when EA's servers go all shitty on me, it's *my* fault. My internet connection is hard-wired into my PS3 at 60mb/s. It's hardly a slow connection and there is no reason that my PS3 should ever freeze or disconnect. 

Yet, it's happened about 3 times in the last week (and twice today). And now my DNF % is so bad, I got 400 coins from a 7-3 win. 400...I used to get 650-700 for that. As well as the obligatory stain on my seasons, so I now have to fight for survival in Div 1 rather than fight for the title.

Ugh, this just really irritates me. I wish EA would take into account things like *their servers* fucking up, rather than us disconnecting because we're losing.

 If they looked at the score, and our previous history of results (ie; lost 8-0, did not disconnect, lost 10-0, did not disconnect, etc.) they may see that some of us - or at least certainly me, do not rage quit, because I prefer to be an honourable opponent and play to the last.

My way to fix this, if I was the big boss man in charge of FUT, would be to take into consideration all these things (The score, history of disconnections, their internet speed/connection) and run it through some algorithm as to ascertain whether or not they actually raged.

Obviously there would be errors and whatnot, but I just think it's so unfair that I'm blamed every time the EA servers die, when I have consistently proved I do not rage quit.

    and that you are wanting 9 chemistry (which you should be)  
  
Right. Let's say your player is a centre back - [Chiellini, for example.](http://gyazo.com/fe70c14c8879fa95f2889ef5eeda2210.png)  
He has four links:  

* To the LB  
* To the GK  
* To the CDM  
* To the other CB  
   
If you want him to get 9 chemistry, you have to give him 4 'points'. One for each link.  
Here's how to get points from the players he's linked to:  
  
* For 1 point - someone from the same league  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same team  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same nation  
  
[Here, he gets 0 chemistry ](http://gyazo.com/72faecd59478ab18aba6db378fabbdaa.png)because he has no links with any of the players.  
[Here, he only gets 7 chemistry.](http://gyazo.com/e39bc4d21e63a90d50d226964e5c3dde.png) That's because he only has 3 points - 1.5 from both the LB and GK because they're from the same nation.  
[Here, he gets 9 chemistry ](http://gyazo.com/640fabd1d73fa2061d55a27893062c32.png)- despite having three red links - that's because De Ceglie is from the same league (1), the same nation (1.5), and the same team (1.5).  
1 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 4.

Now, I never 100% believed this ""handicap"" in FIFA, primarily spoken about in FUT. For those who do not know, the handicap is when your team (generally a higher rated/ higher chemistry squad) plays very poorly against a much weaker team.

I have lost and/or struggled versus a few weaker teams, but most of the time I chalked it up to that player simply being a good FIFA player. Until today.

Today, I played against 3, all Mexican, silver and gold mixed teams. I use a French/Italian hybrid rated 83 with 95-100 chemistry. I lost these matches 5-0, 
6-1, and 4-1 respectively.

I tried telling myself that these 3 different FIFA players were very skilled compared to me, but watching my strikers miss every shot, my midfielders mess up 75% of their passes, my defenders losing every tackle, and my typically strong Joe Hart letting long shots in so easily, I became a believer.

I looked up my opponents' player stats of futhead. What I found made no sense. Sure there were a few of his attackers with high pace, but none of the players had finishing over 80, or long shots over 70. Yet Rojas was scoring off-balance, left-footed long shots like it was nothing. This one was the worst. Rojas was out-muscling Kaboul, and while under pressure, not fully facing goal, he launches one from 30 yards out. Hart got a piece of it, but he was no match for a rocket propelled torpedo.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I needed to explain how I now believe in the FIFA handicap."	t5_2smu8	True
