Hah.  

It took me well over an hour to go from game installed to actually playing. A sample of some of the issues I ran into on the way:

* Entering the product key multiple times in different forms. Whoops, hope you didn't put anything else in the clipboard. GFWL also breaks the Steam overlay so you're not getting it from there either.

* Impossible to quit the game before logging in to GFWL - have to kill the process manually.

* Password field does not accept paste. I use a password safe and long, secure passwords - repeatedly typing this in while alt-tabbing back and forth is an exercise in frustration. [Side note: Steam used to do this as well but pulled their heads out of their asses sometime recently and fixed it.]

* I ""cleverly"" thought I could work around this by pasting into the email field (which does accept paste, oddly) and manually copying from there...but changing the e-mail field erases the password field. This is probably the worst login form I've dealt with in my life, and I've built some pretty terrible ones myself. Worse than Lotus!

* Password was wrong? Thanks for waiting to tell me until after I filled out a bunch of information and making me do it all over again. Start over from the beginning.

* X-box site gives up server errors when trying to login - turns out logging into live.com to change my password completely breaks the xbox site. Start over from the beginning multiple times until I discover the problem.

* Trying to find my old X-box id was an exercise in futility. No practical mechanism for recovery as far as I can tell. Start over from the beginning multiple times before giving up.

I've probably forgotten some other issues, as well. I did finally get through it, but the game still takes forever to launch (granted, this may not be entirely GFWL's fault) and the Steam overlay is still broken (trying to use it just causes the game to ignore gamepad input for a while - lovely).

That's my rant. If you're thinking about playing Arkham City, do the console option if you have it to avoid all this crap."	t5_2t3ad	True

A little bit of back story. I never really had a lot of video games. When I was a kid my parents never bought me stuff. I'd cry and yell and nothing, my Dad was stubborn as hell and he never bought me games/toys or anything. When I was around 4 or 5 I would see commercials for the N64 and I would ask my parents for one and they would say that Santa might give me one if I was good. Surely enough Christmas comes and there it is, an N64 with Super Smash Brothers.

I played the hell out of that game, but I think they bought it for my sister because she got to put it in her room and I could only play when she let me. BUT SANTA SAID IT WAS MINE! She probably went with them and helped them pick it out, then they put my name on it so that I would be happy. I would sit in her room and watch her play SSB every chance I could, and whenever she wanted to play against someone I was so happy to be able to play.

Well after the first month since we got it she stopped playing, and I was able to take it to the living room where the other TV was and play it myself. I played the crap out of it.

Then I wanted more games. I would bother my parents about it all the time and for about 3 years all I had was SSB. The most they would do was rent me a game when they went to Block Buster but they hardly ever did that. Plus how am I supposed to beat Ocarina of Time within a week? That was the game, OoT. When my mom rented that for me, I found what I was looking for in video games. A complete escape, a fairy tale. The third year I talked to my Dad and asked him what it would take for me to get a game? He said if I did chores, washed the cars, and got good grades at school he would buy me one game per school semester.

With that contract he bought me OoT. I never beat it on the N64, but man I played the hell out of it. I got frustrated too because I didn't have a clue what I was doing. But it was the fantasy that kept me going.

About a year later one Christmas I find that Santa brings us a PS2! A year since launch but still welcome. My parents bought it  because they wanted a DVD player (we were still using VHS).

My parents didn't buy me games because they thought they were bad for me, but when they saw that the PS2 came with a DVD player, they said what the hell. But my dad started to wise up and eventually he started giving me an allowance of fifteen dollars every two weeks for helping him at his real estate job. Now, I could go to Game Crazy, my local video game store, and buy used PS2 games. 30 Dollars a month was plenty for me, and a lot of the time I saved up.

So I bought PS2 games, but my Dad wouldn't let me buy M rated games still. So I had to suffice with the Jack and Daxters, and the platformers. I even bought my self a 12 week subscription to their monthly video games magazine. That's when it took off.

I wanted to to play games. I wanted to play all these amazing titles I was seeing. My friends at school all had lots of video games, my cousins were loaded with things I would dream about.

I sold my N64, worst decision I ever made. Why? For a few ps2 games.

Anyways, I kept buying, and enjoying games, even though I had a small library. The PS2 games you will see in the picks are all the games I amassed through those years.

Skipping ahead to 13 years of age (oh, I bought a game cube and an Xbox (not 360, ) within that time from craigslist, and got a copy of Halo2 from a friend that gave it to me) my dad finally said he would let me buy M rated games. Also, he had increased what he had been paying me. I was getting 15 dollars a week now.

I bought a Wii. I actually camped over night at Best buy with my Dad to get one. I also bought a 360 a few years later, after I had amassed enough money. I would buy games every so often but I still had very little. I got into the MGS series because I could play M rated games. Halo Also.

Then I get my Job at subway when I'm 18, senior in high school. 200 Dollars, every two weeks. I never had this much money before.

Ever since I was in 8th grade I had always wanted to play games on the PC. I would see how good they looked and how much people talked about them being so much better than console games, but I never had the money. I bought HL2 on the original Xbox and it blew my mind. It was like playing your favorite game, for the very first time. Between that and OoT I don't know which is better. When I got my 360 I rented the orange box. At this point I Knew I had to get a PC. I bought an inexpensive 200 dollar one from cyberpower.com. It was just powerful enough to play HL2 on max settings at around 60 FPS. That was my PC until I got my job at subway. The only games I had for it were the orange box, and L4D, oh and Far Cry. My dad didn't like using his credit card, so I had to give him money whenever I wanted to buy a game from steam, so that only happened once, to buy Far cry. I have the box cases for L4D and the Orange box in pics.

When I got my job at subway, and I was making 200 dollars a week, I got a credit card. And that is where everything went to shit. EVERYTHING. Up until this point, I would savor every game I had because I had so little games. When I got my credit card and job I decided I was going to build a PC. I did. I got a monster of a PC. Then the steam curse befell upon me.

Whenever there was a sale, WHENEVER: I would buy games, even if they weren't good, if they looked interesting, click, I had it. I did this for so long. I amassed a large amount of games that I had never even touched. I also kept buying games for my consoles. My brother won a PS3 from his school raffle so I would buy games to play for that as well.

Then one day I said I would stop. I'm not enjoying this. I enjoyed playing a game every week, or every two weeks if the game was long,taking my time with it, and savoring every second. Now I had so many games I couldn't enjoy any of them. So I said I would stop and beat them all. I would not buy more games until I beat all of the games that were in my house, even my brothers games. Even games that I got from a cereal box that I never played when I was a kid. Even games that my friends had given me because they didn't like them or think they were particularly good.

It was a struggle. It was fun. It was amazing, it was enlightening. Some times it was a chore But here I am, about a year since I stopped buying games, finished them all. All of them. Every. Single. Game. In my house.

I made this post because I wanted to celebrate. But no one would want to celebrate this with me. So, I've come to the only place that would give a damn that I've beat all my games. That I can now buy new games and play them on release because I'm not obligating myself to play games I bought two years ago.

I'VE BROKEN THE STEAM CURSE! I'VE BEAT ALL THE GAMES I OWN. So strangers on the Internet, ask me anything about these games. Ask me which one's I hated. Ask me which ones were my favorite. Ask me why I own all the COD's? Ask me what Games I would recommend.

Because after this I'm going to not play video games for a very long time. I'm going to wait until I feel like I can go back to gaming one game at a time like I used to before I got a job. I want to savor the games. I don't want to have a bunch of games on my steam account that have zero hours logged into them.

**TLDR**

*Because I never had games when I was little I bought a lot of games when I got a job at subway. I bought so many that I wasn't enjoying gaming like I did when I had very little games. So I decided to stop buying games until I beat all of the ones I own. Here are pics of all those games.*

It was a nice little game, but every single joke from it, from ""the cake is a lie"" to the companion cube, to GlaDOS' banter was all spoiled for me by the gaming culture for the last few years. 

Is it really my fault all these things were non funny anymore? This felt like the time I saw Borat after everyone had been repeating the best jokes from the movie for months before I saw it.

Lately there's been a lot of discussion around here on the topic of posting deals on games (sales, % off, etc...)

Every time a post like this happens there are some complaints to come along with it. So I'd like to get the opinion of you all and put this issue to rest. In the past I've taken this position: 

&gt;Post any game deal you want, just don't post a direct link, make a self-post, and SAY SOMETHING about the game. *Why* should people buy the game, did you enjoy it? etc..

So let’s get some conversation going, here what I'm asking.

Should posting direct links to ""game deals"" be against the rules of this sub?

Let us know what you think.

Thank you,

1373708567.0	1i7m3h	What's up with Dark Souls? [I gave up]	SwordLaker	172	57	128	"Dark Souls had a $7.5 sale yesterday, and I pretty much spent the last year waiting for it. But here's what happened:

6 hours into the game, and I have spent 5 hours respawning from the same bonfire in Undead Burg. I have ran through the same castle walls, beating down the exact same undead on the exact same spots for 5 hours. I grew sick by the third hour and tried to rushed through enemies without fighting, about one thirds of those attempts I got killed or badly injured on the way. Every twenty attempts I got half a step farther, but in short, I'm back to zero every five minutes. The farthest I've gone to is the courtyard in Undead Parish with two swordsmen and one archer, and I haven't even managed to get back there again.

The last time I checked by the 3nd hour, I lost about 20k of souls. I having stopped counting since and just wanted to reach the next bonfire, but I have been doing the exact same things until now. I finish 95% of the games that I started, and after seven years of gaming, these 4 hours of exact the same things with close to zero progress is easily the worst gaming experience I've ever had. Even Minesweeper gives variety each time I fail. I knew I had to die, I heard too much about it, but this is beyond tolerance.

That is without mentioning the irresponsive control (I play with an X360 gamepad) and the horribly optimized performance that runs  80% of the times at 15fps and the rest at 30fps, without any other framerate in between.

That would be fine with a random game I picked up on a sale, and I wouldn't give it two hours. But I had waited for this game for far too long, I wanted to love it and had too much expectation from it. I feel badly hurt, quite a bit betrayed, and totally dazzled. I kind of want my $7.5 and 6 hours of my life back.

I'm posting this expecting downvotes, and I know you will. But for every two or three downvotes, I hope one of you would give me some kind of explanation of what went wrong back there with me. Because none of what happened make sense to me, considering what I've heard about this game.

In case anyone is interested, my Wanderer is now at level 16. My primary weapons are a claymore and a longsword. Except for a couple of Hollow Soldier Clothes (which I don't think would be helpful at all), I haven't ran into any proper armor yet. I'm mostly on starting equipments without any ring or amulet. I did quite a lot of farming to reach level 16, and I would give up if I have to do more.

Edit: structure edit

UPDATE ON MY PROGRESS: It's so embarrassing that I actually missed the ladder near the Undead Burg bonfire, making my life a tad harder. I farmed a bit more and is now at level 21, greatly thanks for the help of the Drake Sword. Things look quite good right now, and I'm heading to Firelink Shire. Everything was in just one hour. Looks like I'll be back onto the road and actually finish this. On the other hands, performance also seems quite a bit better now. Very much thanks to r/patientgamers. I hope this would help other people who picked up the game on the sale as well.

Edit 3: Thanks for the warning, I have the Drake Sword but I'm definitely not abusing it (the repair cost sucks). My longsword is still my primary weapon and is now at +2."	t5_2t3ad	True

When I started Bioshock Infinite I was hooked almost immediately by the atmosphere and graphics, and sense of mystery.

PSBlake	119	23	201	"After a few fruitful trips to local thrift stores picking up titles I couldn't find anywhere else, I found myself wondering: What are some other great PC games which can't be legitimately purchased through any digital download service?

A few which prompted me to ask this:

* Tron 2.0 - I'd [recently posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1fdl84/tron_20_any_reason_this_game_never_caught_on/) about how unusually good this title was, and expressed my surprise at its relative obscurity. It's a true ""hidden gem,"" in that it is obscure, good, and not easily obtainable firsthand.
* Diablo 1 - This is one of the most surprising ones. One of the defining hack-and-slash RPGs, the game which nudged the rougelike genre into a vastly more approachable form, and you can't buy-and-download it anywhere.
* Warcraft 1 &amp; 2 - Another big surprise. Blizzard is just completely apathetic with anything they did prior to Starcraft.
* The Homeworld Series - 3-dimensional space-based real-time-strategy at its finest. These games spawned countless imitators, none of which managed to capture the same coherent flow of these games. The closest available game today is Sins of a Solar Empire, but its lack of a campaign mode and addition of 4x elements make it a completely different experience.
* No One Lives Forever 1 &amp; 2 - Thief's spy-fi cousin. Not as deep as Thief, but an absolute blast to play.
* Star Trek Elite Force 1 &amp; 2 - It sounded like something that would be a train wreck of bad licensing, but was surprisingly good. And it's still only available on physical media."	t5_2t3ad	True

 * We are not listing any consoles before the ps2/gamecube/xbox era, since before that games start to become more retro and less about being patient. 
 * The survey will ask what type of game you would like to get. Please don't be too specific or your santa will be limited. For example i listed that i would enjoy a racing game. **this question is optional, if you would rather be surprised**
 * The survey will also ask what games you already own that fit that description. There's no need to list your entire collection. Just list those that are in the genre or style you requested

5. You may give a game from your personal collection instead of buying one, but please be considerate and don't just grab a junk game.

I played probably an hour or two into SR2 and I simply could not get into it.   SR3 on the other hand - just starts out running and before you know it you're just saying WTF over and over again.  It's a zany over-the-top GTA that's actually fun.  I put in more game time in one weekend than I ever do normally.  You don't feel like you're working through something or trying to get somewhere - you just want to see what the next crazy ass thing they're going to throw at you is.  Character customization is pretty top notch.  The amount of varying tech they put into the game makes almost every mission unique in it's own way so you never get bored.  With every GTA I felt like I was doing the same 3-4 missions over and over again.

Having played Morrowind for hundreds of hours, I knew Oblivion would be the same affair. At the time of the releases, I did not own a PS3 or 360, and my PC could not run the game either. This summer, though, I spent 3 months saving and put together a good gaming machine.

After a weekend of modding it out, I put in almost 50 hours. I love it. Sadly, I'm still in need of a graphics card. After the Oblivion gates began to spawn, my FPS was obliterated on the Sandy Bridge integrated. It's either turn down all the settings or wait a little longer.

Oblivion has been out for five years and I've owned it on Steam since the summer sales of 2010. I promised myself that I'll play TESIV entirely before Skyrim. This means I'll also have to remain patient to play Skyrim.

The game received positive reviews from critics, but I'm not sure if that was for the right reasons. From gamers I heard nothing but scorn. I think Far Cry 2 is an acquired taste that fans of a very specific type of game will find immensely enjoyable if they go into it with the right expectations. If Far Cry 3 is like Skyrim, Far Cry 2 is like STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl (but with a huge budget and set in Africa). It also has a level of immersion on par with Metro 2033 thanks to its first person animations. It's full of design decisions that most gamers despised, but they aren't present simply for the sake of realism - they make the game much more tense and challenging:

* Fast travel is limited, forcing you to strategically plan your movements to maximize benefits and minimize costs.
* Enemy checkpoints respawn. C'mon, you're one mercenary! You shouldn't be able to clear out an entire war zone - you *should* feel overwhelmed and outgunned!
* You don't get rewarded for killing enemies. This encourages you to avoid combat whenever possible and focus on survival.
* Your weapons jam. This keeps you from finding one super nice gun on an enemy and using it for the rest of the game. Not a big deal if you make regular trips to the arms dealer.
* You have to take pills for malaria. I have no idea why people complain about this. You seriously just hit ""H"" when the game tells you to. Occasionally you have to smuggle travel papers for the underground to get more pills, but you can do this on the way to other missions.

The story is mature, believable, dark, and full of compelling twists. Exposition is minimal but the characters (many of whom are randomly assigned to the various roles and can be killed off at any time!) are very easy to become attached to (or loathe).

The best part of the game is definitely how little it relies on scripted events. Not only can you explore the map and tackle missions in the order of your choosing, you have an immense amount of freedom in how you accomplish objectives, and whether you bombard camps with mortars, use Molotov cocktails and flare guns to start brush fires, snipe targets from extreme distances, or equip silencers and camo to sneak past patrols, the action is just as tight as in linear games like Call of Duty. It's the game that Crysis tried to be for a few hours before giving up and going back to being Halo (and it's just as pretty). AI is also excellent - enemies will immediately flank you if you stay in one position for too long and they'll search for you where they last saw or heard you.

Basically if you like STALKER and other emergent survival games that force you to plan, be patient, exercise caution, manage resources, and feel like you're constantly in extreme danger, you'll love Far Cry 2."	t5_2t3ad	True

We all get our games long after their release when all the pre-order bonuses have come and gone... or have they?

I would say almost every time I go into a game store and ask for leftover codes I leave with at least a small handful for my console of choice.

Of course this depends on your local stores, so YMMV, but many times stores will get an abundance in preparation for what they think will be a big crowd, or if they run out they're often sent new stacks well beyond the release date that rarely get picked up.

From what I've gathered (and the age of some codes I've gathered) these just sit around in drawers for an obscene amount of time until they're thrown out, so don't feel shy about asking for them.

Don't be specific, just take whatever they have. If it's not a game you have, maybe you will have it in the future, or maybe it's a code for a game a friend has that you can share.

Hope this helps you guys as well as it's helped me.

Let me pick for an example a game highly revered by the gaming community. Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I never had a N64 as a kid, and I recently picked it up on the Wii shop along with Majora's Mask. I tried playing, but found the controls to be a bit cumbersome, and the textures downright hard to look at. This I guess is why a lot of acclaimed PS2 or PS1 games are getting HD remakes where the only things changed are some graphics and textures. I'm not just talking about that. I'm talking about mechanics and controls as well.

*Hear me out*, I'm *not* trying to shit on your favorite games. I just want to hear about your disappointments for playing ""classic"" games again or for the first time, but can't get past the aged-ness. 

I think the problem of aged games is more for people who have just gotten around to playing these games for the first time *and not as a child or a young teenager*. I find that nostalgia forgives a lot of shortcomings. "	t5_2t3ad	True
1364998594.0	1bl6c9	Can we get a list of popular games for each console for the sidebar?	serfis	88	12	36	"Hey fellow Patientgamers!

I really like this subreddit, but one thing I notice is there are way too many people posting questions like: 

""I just got Console X, what games have I missed?""

There's one for the PS3 on the frontpage right now, even. Now, if you go to the search bar and type in PS3 and search /r/patientgamers only, you'll notice there are *a lot* of posts with that exact question. Same pretty much goes for every console, there's ones for Xbox360, PC, PS2, GBA, 3DS, PSP, etc. 

So what if we did a thread for each one and put it up in the sidebar? We can make it a weekly thing so that each one gets a good amount of time. In it, we could come up with a list of games that we feel should be played for each console/PC. 

Hell, we could even arrange the games by genre, age, price (this varies, but I tend to use Amazon for a rough idea of how much a game normally costs), etc. to make it so that if somebody has a question like ""Which JRPGs from 2008 that are under $20 should I get for the PS3?"" it can be easily answered. 

If we make it into a table, we could also include a column for rating/reviews from places like Metacritic.

[**Death Rally**](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/28518/Death+Rally.html) (1996) [(pic)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p6XZtUdNPJQ/TI6wZkHeEtI/AAAAAAAAAA8/pKr_o9BRCCs/s1600/Death+Rally+Intro.jpg) (*Windows compatible*) . Top-down racer with guns and upgrades. Period.

[**Sonic CD**](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/28051/Sonic+CD.html) (1995) [pic](http://www.sonic-cult.org/imagebin/soniccd.gif) (*Windows compatible through patching and compatibility mode*). By many considered the best Sonic, and it's available on PC... Just amazing. This version has no CD audio, but the forums have an ISO version with audio (registration required).

[**Discworld**](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/878/Discworld.html) (1995) [pic](http://pics.mobygames.com/images/covers/large/1109631409-00.jpg) (*compatible with dosbox*). A great point-and-click adventure game, from famous author Terry Pratchett. It is incredibly funny, especially since the dialogue is done by [Eric Idle](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001385/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) from Month Python. If you liked Monkey Island, you'll love this.

[**Rollcage**](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/29319/Rollcage.html) (1999) [*pic*](http://www.gamewholesale.com/ebay/rollcage.jpg) (*Windows compatible. guide in description*). Futuristic racing game with weapon pickups. It was very innovative because the cars could race upside-down. This enabled them to drive in the ceiling, then drop down to the ground and continue like normal. It's actually quite hard on the later levels.

[**Jazz Jackrabbit 2**](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/294/Jazz+Jackrabbit+2.html) (1998) [*pic*](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8akywymRP1qlftu9o1_1280.jpg) (*Windows compatible*). Sidescrolling plattformer. One of my all time favorite plattformers. Most of you have probably heard of it so...

[**Ignition**](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/107/Ignition.html) (1997) [*pic*](http://www.juegomania.org/Ignition/foto/pc/0/642/642.jpg/Foto+Ignition.jpg) (Windows compatible). A very unique fully 3D racing game. The camera is in third person but above the vehicle. The formula is simple: choose from a set of cars with different stats, hit gas, then boost to make the car go faster.  The trick isn't the driving itself, but moreso knowing when to boost and avoiding the myriad of hazards and jumps along the courses. It is seriously some of the most fun I've ever had at LAN parties. Pick this up if you know what's good for you

To be honest, I'm still not going for this one myself as I've yet to play the first, I use it to illustrate my point: I just can't justify buying a brand new game at anything close to retail anymore.

1366135444.0	1ch42l	I stopped playing Serious Sam:BFE.	ggabriele3	91	18	43	"Some of the games in my Steam Library are there as ""palate cleansers"". These are old school or simple games that don't have much story, kind of like a mindless sitcom, that lets me get ready for the next AAA title that will consume all my free time.

Serious Sam:BFE was one of those. It was advertised as an ""old school FPS"" and boy does it deliver on that promise - the guns keep getting bigger, the story is non-existent, and the characters/voice acting is enough to make you feel bad for the voice actors.

But that's not the point - it's mindless fun. Lots and Lots of trigger pulling and exploding aliens. It's exactly what I used to love about Doom and Hexen and Wolfenstein and Quake years ago.

I got most of the way through, and I had to put it down. At some point, their only method of increasing difficulty is to increase the number of enemies. Some levels are just giant (really huge) arenas where you have to deal with waves of well over 1,000 enemies with no breaks. Your health does not regenerate.

It's very self-aware, which is good - at one point, Sam goes ""damn, i must have killed half of the known universe back there.""

For much of the game, this was great. It's frantic, it's challenging and it forces you to improve your skill. it's unapologetic, mindless fun.

But I'm near the end of the game, and it's just gotten ridiculous. I spend an hour killing 1000 of the same three or four types of enemies, and my reward is another giant open space with the same enemies, only now there's no cover and no health packs.

The one problem with throwback games like this is that they don't fix the most obvious problems of the old games.

**For example, the enemy audio.** Each type of enemy has a unique sound that they make. This is helpful in some instances, since it signals to you the type and number of enemy you're up against even if you can't see them. But multiply the same few grunts by 1000, and it becomes nothing more than a really annoying soundtrack.

**the worst** example of this is a guy that runs at you with a bomb in either hand. If he reaches you, he explodes. From the moment he spawns, he has a NONSTOP scream - ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH"". In big arenas, you may not be able to even find these guys to kill them, so it becomes a constant drone. It got to the point where I was hearing the scream in my head all day, even when I wasn't playing the game.

So, I recommend this game as a summer sale ""few bucks"" nostalgia-with-HD-textures download. Just don't expect it to hold your attention forever."	t5_2t3ad	True

1361666068.0	193v1s	Just finished Fallout: New Vegas for the first time	MurrayL	83	12	42	"I just finished New Vegas (hardcore mode) with my first character after 96 hours of gameplay! Feels like something of an event, after playing it on and off for the past 7 months.

I made sure to visit almost every location, and did every sidequest I found, as well as all the DLC content. If you're curious, I ended the game on the side of the NCR.

Overall I found the game to be a far better experience than Fallout 3, but it had its fair share of highs and lows.

**Highs:**

* A really interesting storyline, with lots of crossing paths (especially between DLCs).
* A mature tone, in keeping with the series. New Vegas has more 'silly' moments than, for example, Fallout 3, but there are plenty of times when it doesn't shy away from a sensitive subject.
* The weapon modding system worked really well. The expensive nature of the mods made it feel very rewarding to make your favourite gun a bit better.
* A lot more variety in the environments compared to Fallout 3. Shame about the interior repetition, though.
* Working iron sights!
* The new companion interaction wheel is a huge improvement on the Fallout 3 dialogue trees.

**Lows:**

* Stealth, as in every Fallout/Elder Scrolls game, is the most OP ability when paired with ranged weaponry.  
I abused this copiously, but it does make the game significantly less challenging when you can kill even the most 'powerful' enemies in a couple of sneak attack shots.
* The AI is still pretty appalling.
* It crashes fairly frequently, so you'd better learn to use that quicksave button.
* I found the hardcore mode to be something of a missed opportunity. It was more of an annoyance than anything else, but I'm not really sure what I expected.
* Almost all of the Dead Money DLC. By the end, I was just glad to return to the Mojave.

I'm tempted to replay it as an evil character, but I think I'll leave it for a while first.

1358874334.0	1729z2	Kindoms of Amalur: Reckoning....a good game buried under Skyrim and Schilling	ggabriele3	87	15	25	"I don't know if I'll be any good at writing a review, but as a patient gamer, I hope I give you some good info.

I just finished Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. It took about 86 hours (the main quest, nearly all the side quests, and the Dead Kel DLC). I decided to leave the second DLC (Legend of Dead Kel) and a few of the other side quests to some potential future date.

My god, talk about bad luck. A new open-world fantasy RPG with crafting, alchemy, blacksmithing, elves, and dwarves comes out right around Skyrim...and then gets lost in the 38 Studios debacle like a neglected child caught in the middle of her parents' ugly divorce. **I won't compare the game to Skyrim or say anything more about the studio's collapse...except to say that it's a damn shame that external factors cut off this franchise's future.***

I was interested in this game when the demo came out, but much more interested in Skyrim, so I put this off. I think a lot of people would feel the same. Then a work trip landed me with a lot of free time and my laptop...so I got into KOA.

**Where I'm Coming From:** I'm a 32-year old gamer with limited free time. When I was younger, I played single-player first person shooters almost exclusively. Then Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, GTA4 (not an RPG, i know), and other big open-world games grabbed me and I was hooked. these games are my favorite genre...300+ hours into Skyrim and I'm nowhere near done. I don't care for multiplayer (never had a good experience, now i don't have the time), MMOs, and I generally complete only one play through of a game. I like being overpowered by the end of the game.

**KOA's world:** visually, Amalur is beautiful. Plenty of colorful and detailed scenery, relatively glitch-free, and big. The different environments feel different and pretty well realized. Quests will often send you running for quite a long time through a world that can be very much like a maze, varying height and twisting/turning all over the place. After midway through the game, I was basically sick of exploring (didn't feel the need to either) and just started fast traveling. The DLC environments renewed that exploration interest, though.

**The NPCs:** Very well done here. The human and elf races are basically the same, but the Fae and Dwarves were very interesting. The characters had personality, dialog choices made sense. I found all the dialogue interesting, even though I didn't feel the need to listen to all of it...they make it clear which is ""necessary for quest"" and which isn't.

**The Story:** no surprise, you're saving the world. However, the idea is relatively fresh - the world is bound by fate, and so were you, until you died - and you came back Fateless. As the only one whose fate is not determined, you alone can save the world from the Threat. 

**The Enemies**: Good and bad news. The **bad news** is that there are relatively few enemy types, and often difficulty is adding by simply adding more enemies to the fight. At the end of the game, where you would encounter mobs large enough to overwhelm you, the AI seemed to break down a bit, where some enemies would just stand there and watch you fight while you engaged others. 
**Good News:** sometimes the AI feels smart. different enemies must be approached differently with different weapons and abilities. Enemies will be paired together in ways that complement each other's abilities, increasing the challenge. *For example*, later in the game you face groups consisting of a few large ""Tank"" enemies and maybe 2 magical enemies. If you use purely ranged weapons, you'll get taken out by the magical enemies. If you go in to kill the magical enemies, the Tanks will block you to protect the mages. 

**The Combat:** Excellent. I put this separately from the Enemies because, in this game, there is a little more to discuss. **Weapons and Abilities** are nicely varied and magic (towards the end of a game) can be fun. No weapon or spell is ever universally effective or overpowered. Each job has an ideal tool.  Weapons have weight and spells have charge time, but it never feels artificial.

There is a **rhythm** to the combat that I learned over time. It varies from enemy to enemy, from weapon to weapon. Before mastering it, I got my ass kicked by enemies who would exploit sloppy swinging and dodging. I have read other reviews that complained about moves that you can't cancel, leaving you vulnerable to attacks or stuck in enemy combos. Eventually you realize that those problems are USER ERROR. By the end of the game, *I felt almost like playing an instrument.* Though I wish the enemies themselves were more varied, and this combat definitely isn't ""simulation"", it was great gameplay.

**The Loot:** Weapon and armor drops are very common, but the overwhelming majority of it is Junk. Luckily, there is an ""add to junk"" option which makes selling the junk simple. Once I figured out the weapons I liked, I would go long stretches with the same weapons. However, when you do find a new unique weapon, it looks and feels unique. As for armor - there appear to be many unique armor sets in the game, but I almost never found full sets, despite a good amount of searching. I assume that more searching would have found the missing parts, but ultimately i just moved on.

**Blacksmithing / Sagecrafting / Alchemy:** I may have missed out on something here, but I found these uninteresting. I have read that people can craft ""epic"" gear by investing in these skills, but I got through the entire game (relatively easily) without them.

**Greatest Crimes:** This game commits some common design crimes against the player. 

(1) making me run forever across a huge world, do something, then run back...for the entire game. this shows a lack of respect for my time. I like open worlds, but there's a limit. Lots of places were BEAUTIFUL but EMPTY.

(2) **Combat Sounds Over Voice** - this is one of my biggest complaints across multiple games. Many times, story dialogue will be trampled by combat sounds. In KOA, for example, there are a million Lore Stones that you can find, hit A, and it'll play some audio to add to the lore. These were always interrupted by combat (combat sounds louder than the lore audio). You can replay them, but they'd still get overridden by the next battle. 

The worst offense: an endgame conversation that's supposed to take place while you're running to the final battle. This conversation, i think, reveals a lot of back story...but takes place during some of the most intense battles. So I heard none of it. At one point, I had a lore stone audio + the end game back-story conversation + combat audio all going on at the same time. Ugh.

**Worth Your Time?** Yes, if you're a fan of big fantasy RPGs, but I wouldn't spend $60 on it now. Wait to see if it ever goes on substantial sale.

**EDIT: Being Overpowered** - by the end of the game, I was overpowered. I had about 4 million in gold, almost 100 health potions, no need for mana potions, no need for any of the Gems or better gear. So long as i watched my health bar, I could outlast any fight on health potions alone."	t5_2t3ad	True

I usually enjoy a good action-roguelike- but there simply doesn't seem to be anything behind this title.  The character progression is uninteresting, the combat is completely clicky/grindy, most of the loot is just garbage to be hauled up for sale, and I don't think I've seen anything different in the past 10 levels or so.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all of the suggestions on where to start. I think I'm going to work my way through the 3D part of the series starting with Ocarina of Time first, then work my way to 2D and start with A Link To The Past. The games look great and hopefully I will be able to understand a lot more of the Zelda references on r/gaming.

EDIT 2: I lied. My computer is too much of a potato to handle a Gamecube emulator. So I will be starting with the 2D version of the Zelda games. I started playing A Link To The Past and so far I really like it. I'm not very good at it though, I die a lot.

EDIT 3: I lied again. I tried the Nintendo 64 version of Ocarina of Time with the Project64 emulator, and it works flawlessly. I got it going and a smooth 60 fps. So far, I fucking love it. I'm also playing Link To The Past on my Jailbroken iPod when I'm away from my computer. I can tell already, this series is going to be worth it.

1325712901.0	o30hk	[Discussion] How to Best Enjoy Fallout 3/New Vegas	stellarfury	69	5	69	"18 months ago, I played the PS3 port of Fallout 3 for about 12 hours before getting bored and annoyed with it and shutting it down for good. The farthest I got on the main quest before giving up was Vault 112, but I ignored most of the sidequests because after spending 4 hours combing through the DC Metro for the exit to GNR, I just wanted to be done.

Flash forward to today, my brother sent me a copy of New Vegas as a present. Thinking ""well, maybe I should actually finish the other one this time,"" I also picked up the Fallout 3 GOTY edition during the holiday sale.

Lessons I learned the hard way from my first bout:

- Every skill point poured into Energy Weapons is a colossal waste.

- Always more Science.

- Always more Lockpicking.

- The PS3 port is terrible.

Anything else I should keep in mind? Any tips for keeping the game fresh? There's only so many shotgun blasts you can pour into Super Mutant heads before it becomes a bit of a chore. For reference, my current character is at Megaton (level 3, poured skill points into Science, Small Arms, Repair and Lockpicking so far), did a couple of Moira's quests, and about to head for GNR.

1357588313.0	164wu0	[Review] Just beat Red Faction: Armageddon, here's what I thought.	kevin24lg	81	22	16	"Picked up a ton of games from the recent Steam sale and Humble Bundle (58 total), so I thought I'd give a review of the games I've beat. So far, only 1 - Red Faction: Armageddon. 

In case you don't want to read this big block of text, I give the game 5 out of 10.

**Story**

Basically you are a military guy named Mason and you are in a military unit on Mars. You have some pretty cool gadgets namely the nanoforge, which is this little device that can repair steel structure back to brand new. This is entertaining as all hell, I found myself destroying buildings and then putting them back together again throughout the whole game. Anyway, you aren't in the military for very long, something happens and you leave and do  odd jobs on mars. I don't remember the details of what happened, the music was louder than the voices during the cut scenes so I couldn't keep track of what was going on. This is a negative to me because the story just makes a leap in time so it was like ""ok, so he's doing this now, got it.""

On one of these jobs he gets contracted to go clear this tunnel and make a path, in the process he unravels a seal which releases these creatures onto Mars. Later you find out that the main bad guy had this planned all along, so the rest of the game is trying to get generators online, trying to kill all of the alien bugs and then trying to kill the main bad guy.

The game was very long, it felt like it took forever to beat; I beat it in 8 hours. Sounds contradicting but here's what I mean. When I was away from my house, I didn't long to play this game; hell when I was at home I didn't really long to play the game, but when I did play it I would play for about 3 or 4 hours at a time. So it's not all bad, it was entertaining while I played it, it just felt like getting through the story was an eternity. 

I really liked the main character, he seemed like an actual human with his personality; kind of like a regular guy found in a bad situation. He wasn't all like *deep voice* ""I didn't ask for this"" He was just like ""well, shit is messed up, it's pretty much my fault so I guess I'll just save the world"". There was a romantic interest in the game too, but they didn't touch very much on it; it was just assumed that he was into her, but it wasn't anything more than a friendship at that point.

**Gameplay**

The game is extremely linear, so much so that you have a GPS that points exactly where you're suppose to go. The format is over the shoulder, similar to Gears of War, and you can carry a max of 4 weapons with you. You also have that little Nanoforge device for fixing metal structures and you can also use it to pulse launch creatures away from you or make a big hole in the buildings (think energy blast DBZ style). It has limited range, but you can upgrade that.

Scattered throughout the whole game are stations where you can upgrade your skills and change out what weapons you want. Skill points are gained by finding little glowy canisters around the areas; takes about 1000 points to really upgrade anything. I could tell the game was rushed a bit because in the first 4 hours of gameplay I managed to upgrade 4 skills, but the second 4 hours I upgraded close to 15 skills. Also seems like for the main boss fight they just started sprinkling ammo and skill points all over the place to give you a fighting chance. I never once ran out of ammo at the end. The boss fight was not difficult, fighting the minions at the same time as fighting the boss was challenging. I will say the creatures are definitely unique, many different types with different abilities that make it challenging to kill them.

**TL;DR Final Thoughts**

Overall, like I said earlier, I give it 5 out of 10 stars. Good/entertaining for what it was and would probably make for a decent movie (Ghost of Mars style movie). I would pick this game up if it was maybe $8 or under, otherwise pass. I'm sure there are better games out there that offer similar gameplay, I certainly wouldn't drop $60 on it.

1337879374.0	u30gc	So I spent this last week playing Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City	WolfDemon	67	7	54	"Just beat City yesterday. Seriously these the most well done superhero games I've ever played. Obviously this couldn't have been a Batman game without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill playing as Batman and The Joker. Both games are really great at showing off how dark the Batman universe can be while still being the typical campy Batman we all know. They went to lengths to really make sure Batman doesn't kill anyone. When you do a ledge takedown you think he's just gonna toss them over the edge but he manages to tie them to the ledge and they just hang there. And when you knock people out, in Detective Mode they are shown as unconscious. And then obviously you have everything bat related, the batarang, when he sprays explosive gel he does it in the shape of a bat, his computer is called the Batcomputer.

What I was really impressed with is your encounter with multiple of the big bad guys in the Batman universe. You're trapped in Arkham Asylum or Arkham City with just about every bad guy and his henchmen who want Batman dead. It's like the equivalent of throwing a normal person into a pit of rabid wolves. And in usual Batman fashion, not a single fuck is given and he defeats everyone. Along the way your suit gets torn up to reflect how much shit he has been through in a single night.

If you like Batman even the slightest, and maybe if you don't like Batman so much, you should give this game a go if you haven't already, it's well worth the time. I did everything possible in Arkham Asylum except the challenge mode, and I'm working on doing all the side stuff in City now."	t5_2t3ad	True

After a bunch of hours, I'm happy to report that it IS juvenile and over-the-top, completely ridiculous, and lots of fun. There have been a few moments where i had to stop and explain to my fiance what was going on (notably, the mission where i'm shooting dozens of women in lingere, and the scene where my guy is replaced by a toilet with a cannon on the side), which was a new experience for me. 

Combat is appropriately crazy, though it goes from extremely easy to extremely frustrating (hordes of enemies, ragdoll-ing, etc) pretty suddenly. Dialogue is fun in a ""Rated-R summer comedy"" sort of way, and the randomness of the missions has kept me engaged and interested.

My 13-year old brother (COD gamer) asked me if he should play it, and I was surprised to find myself telling him no - he's not old enough to fully understand the satire going on in this game. Too few years and too many hormones under his belt, IMO.

I signed the petitions for it to be ported so I wanted to support them for doing that and I just couldn't wait.  For those of you interested, its a 3rd person action RPG with probably the best combat system I've ever experienced in a game.  Also, the game is incredibly beautiful and the atmosphere is amazing.  Its just the right amount of challenging to where you will get your shit stomped regularly, but through persistence and skill you can overcome stuff.  Very rewarding.  Maybe the best game I've ever played.  10/10 

I just got finished with **The Witcher 2** which I got for a great price (-66% during the steam summer sale I believe).  another 3rd person action RPG.   A lot of people talk trash about the original Witcher saying it hasnt aged well but I played it late last year (for the first time) and loved it.  Playing the first isn't necessary but it will give you a lot more context for whats going on and a greater appreciation for the story.  And the story is amazing.  This is the first game I've ever played where you make choices that actually matter and which affect future events.  There are whole zones and important characters which you will miss on your first playthrough, and theres about 16 different endings I believe.  On top of that, the combat system is awesome and much improved over the Witcher 1.  This is one of the best games I've ever played, and it may seem like I throw that around lightly but I don't.  9/10, because some of the battle sequences and cutscenes were cheesy, and because of a bullshit bossfight: [I was FULL alchemy spec and then they don't let me use potions for the Draug fight?  What the fuck were they thinking?](/spoiler)

Up next for me is **Dead Space 2**, which I got for $5 I believe.  I loved the first one, and am excited for more carnage.

I own a fairly high end PC, and an aging laptop. This setup did it's job for Left 4 Dead, but left much to be desired in terms of comfort and togetherness.

We got the idea, that perhaps an X-Box 360 or PS3 would do us nicely. This would save the money of having to buy each game twice, she prefers using a gamepad, and couch-gaming seems generally much more conductive to a ""bonding"" atmosphere.

All that being said, I have never owned a current-gen console - and I don't know exactly what to expect, which console to pick, and which games to choose.

For me, it's the price. Somehow, I can rarely justify spending a game's full cost when it first gets released, around $60 here in the US, but I know it gets even crazier in other parts of the world. When you add up DLC and games that are full-priced sequels when they should be expansion packs (I'm looking at you, Assassin's Creed), it gets hella expensive to get games as soon as they come out, especially with only a part time job.

I find it's much less stress on my wallet to wait for a months or a few after the game comes out, and to buy copies on Ebay or Amazon that people may have already beaten. You can usually get them for anywhere between $20-$40 cheaper this way.

The last controller I bought was sometime around 2001 and it plainly sucks.

My question is kind of twofold - for modern PC games should I be looking for a controller that has two sticks on it like a PS3 or 360 pad? Similarly, should I just be looking to buy one of those console gamepad adapters that connect your current gamepads to your computer?

Secondly, what are some recommendations for a real quality controller that won't break in a month and whose d-pad isn't so unresponsive you can barely play Super Mario 1 with it?

1360707958.0	18ekkd	I am starting to become a patient gamer. I have only recently learned how badly I can get screwed when buying games and DLC.	Apex-Nebula	59	12	38	"Codemasters seriously messed up with the DiRT 3 DLC . Long before the game was even released, there was trailers advertising ""Group B"" rally cars (some of the most famous rally cars of all time, so long sought after by players) and some other cars as if it implied that these cars would be included in the main game.

Then when it was released, the cars were nowhere to be found. In the menu's for the car selection, there was a picture of the car that SHOULD have been there, and when you selected it, a message saying that the car had to be purchased as DLC appeared. And the cars were then released weeks later as DLC. Then after I reluctantly purchased the DLC that was basically advertised as being on the base game, Codemasters releases a ""Platinum"" version of the game with all the DLC included for the same (AND SOMETIMES LOWER) price than I paid for the original release game with no DLC included. I was fuming and still am very annoyed about it.

Now, with the recently annouced details of a choice of pre-order DLC at launch announced for GRID 2 (even though it was confirmed on the codmasters community forums that the options the buyer didn't choose would be available as DLC later (not confirmed if it's free or not) I have decided to hold off buying GRID 2 at launch (A game I have been waiting years for, GRID is my favourite game of all time) because I don't know if they're going to pull the same trick that they did with DiRT 3 and release a ""deluxe"" or ""platinum"" edition further down the road.

1354760843.0	14czmf	Finally got a PS3 a few weeks ago and have been playing the Batman games. It's been 8 years since I've gamed. What else should I play?	whatevrmn	66	16	85	"First, a few words about Asylum and City: Holy Shit Snacks, Batman, these games are the best. They remind me of Zelda OoT and MM in that they're huge, fun, tons of side quests, and complete game changers for me. They are just amazing games.

So what's next? I've been out of the video game market for probably 8 years. I have a PS2, but used that mostly to play FFVII and the first 3 Resident Evil games. That's basically all the gaming experience I've had in the past few years. Oh, and running NES and SNES ROMs on my tablet.

I've tried to play Metal Gear IV, which was the main reason I wanted a PS3, and I got my ass handed to me in a second. Same with Resident Evil 5. It seems like most of the gaming world has changed a lot while I haven't had the chance to keep up. 

Edited to say: Apparently I'm Marty McFly from Back to the Future. When the inmates in Arkham City start calling me a chicken, I drop whatever the fuck I was going to do and beat the crap out of them. It takes me a long time to get anything done since *all* the inmates shit talk The Batman.

**EDIT** - Some good points from comments made:  

* They don't ship to Canada  
* If you buy an old PC game the serial has probably been used, I tend to buy games with solid single player or LAN play since I assume the servers will be down or the serial will be used  
* Shipping charges can get high on this site, keep an eye on it if a good item finishes up and is still cheap, it might be because of ludicrous shipping."	t5_2t3ad	True

Bought off the Red Orchestra pack the other and i had to say, that is one game very worth buying and playing with strangers. Best played online though, single player was very ""bot match"" like. 

So now, im looking at Natural Selection II, havent played the first one but i was very intrigued by the game style. Are the servers well populated? I really enjoyed Red Orchestra more than Rising Storm due to the much more diversed range of combat available.

For those who haven't played it, you get to memory sequence 11 (out of 14), then the Animus has a glitch and you skip to chapter 14.  Seemed kind of odd, so I looked it up and sure enough their are 2 DLC items ($4 a each on PS3) that provide you with sequences 12 and 13 respectively to fill in the story.

**What I've downloaded and played for at least 20 minutes:**

* [SpaceChem](http://www.spacechemthegame.com/)

* [Team Fortress 2](http://www.tf2.com/freetoplay/)

I only had my laptop handy during the sale, since my desktop is in the (3- 6 month) process of being upgraded, so I'll have to wait to play Dear Esther and Krater, I think. All in all, I only dropped around $40 and gifted Myst to a friend.

I'm about 20 hours of gameplay into ME1 and it is becoming a bit of a chore now, where I'm mostly playing to get to ME. I figure I should ask if ME2 or the latter part of the game would be more to my taste or not before I continue.

First of all, let me clarify that I don't *hate* the game, it is a great game, the plot is intriguing, the lines are well written, and despite what I heard before buying the game, I actually enjoyed the combat a lot (well the AI could use some work, my squad mates like shooting at walls, but that's a small problem). There are just a lot of small things that rub me the wrong way.

My main complains are:

- Subquest characters disappear once the quest is done. It makes the persistent world feel not quite so persistent.

- Dialogue choices don't really give me a clear idea on what Shepard would say. I'd want to give a slightly ""meh whatever"" response, and what I get is a long tirade, it's a nicely written speech but not ""my words"". New information comes from Shepherd mouth so often that I don't feel like it's ""my"" character. Which wouldn't have been a problem for me if this were a shooter, but I was playing with the mindset of a RPG.

- My squad members don't seems to like each others, especially Ash. And I can't seem to do anything about it, bringing them on missions together doesn't look like it helps. Why can't a leader try to resolve the member's conflicts, and why working together doesn't help on trust issues. This is making it difficult for me to like some of them. [Let's just say I didn't feel very bad when I picked Kaidan over her.](/spoiler)

- And speaking of Kaidan, why the hell can't I talk to him without going into flirting mode? It's a bit painful to go through that every time. I just wanted to keep up to date with my team and learn some background info. 

- Elevator rides, does it really need to take that long every single time?

Just wondering if these things would change later in the game / in ME2, or should I just give up now and come back later to see if my feeling about it change instead?

I just want to quickly ask: How do you deal with side quests in a game? I mean, sure, we call ourselves patientgamers but I'd say that - at least for me - it has more to do with the way I buy games and not how I play them.

Right now I'm tackling *Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings EE* and I'm sloooowly getting swamped by side quests. I don't get to play *that* often and when I return I usually have to spend a bit of time reading up on stuff via the journal (what a godsend!); aka ""What the hell was I doing last time?? Why am I here - and why are those dudes after my grey-ponytailed head?? WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU! Guys!? GUYS???""


So I'm thinking I should just skip all the side quests for now and focus on the main quests, just so that I can enjoy the game a bit more and maybe even, you know, finish a playthrough for once. ;)

Of course, you never know what you are missing out on: there could be this amazingly well-scripted / well-written mini-story hiding beneath the usual drivel of ""Go there, slap beasty around, collect X troll arses""...

**TL;DR: How do you handle side quests? Are you a completionist, work through every nook and cranny or do you purposely skip stuff because of reasons?**

PS: I know, it may vary from game to game but I've started to see a pattern with me: I can't be bothered to do ALL the stuff. I'm more of a ""oooh main story. Yay!"" guy."	t5_2t3ad	True
1375598892.0	1jo4n6	My thoughts on Max Payne (1) - Still playable and enjoyable, but frustrating at times	EpicCyndaquil	54	9	23	"So, I just finished Max Payne 1, and here are my main thoughts. For some background, I've yet to play any of the others; I purchased all three on the most recent Steam sale. I had to install a sound patch someone made, but otherwise everything is stock (and arguably, that isn't really a modification since it brings the original sounds to the point where they should be).

1. The bullet time works, and it works well. I'm pretty impressed by it, actually. It's a unique mechanic that was a very risky move at the time (as opposed to now, where we have advanced physics engines), but I don't think I have a single complaint about it. 

2. A couple parts of the game are absolutely awful. First, [](#s ""his wife's death"") (Only a spoiler if you haven't played through the first ~10 minutes) is told in an awful way. [](#s ""I can understand tragedy, but showing it over and over the way they did is very stupid, and nullifies the point more than anything, in my opinion."") Related to this are those [](#s ""stupid dream scenes""). Adds nothing to the game except frustration. Other than that, there aren't too many issues.

3. It's a **very hard game** in comparison to a lot of current games. There's higher difficulty levels offered too, which I'm pretty hesitant to try. The game isn't worth playing again *immediately*, and the gameplay is pretty repetitive. It even [](#s ""repeats levels a couple times"") (not a big spoiler).

4. The story is pretty good for the mostpart, but I did want to skip over some of the parts from time to time - the interruptions are a bit too frequent.

5. QUICKSAVE ALL THE TIME, BUT DO IT *CAREFULLY*. The first time I played through, I did a quicksave by accident in a bad spot (not too far through), and there was no way out of it. So, I had to start all over again. However, I got the hang of checking that my surroundings were safe, quicksaving, attacking the next room of enemies, repeat. There were a few parts I was angry because I didn't quicksave when I should have.

I think it's a game worth playing if you haven't, but keep in mind that there will be frustrations, and you'll have to repeat some areas upwards of 3 times. Some might even call it the Dark Souls of its era, because you die so incredibly often."	t5_2t3ad	True

I love all kinds of games, and open world RPGs/FPS are always hit or miss with me: I loved KotOR 1+2, but I didnt enjoy mass effect as much for various reasons. Borderlands has taken it in a way that I dont feel bad about doing sidequests, because the main quest really isnt that prominent at the moment, so it really gives me the feeling of ""I'm just killing shit loads of bad guys/creatures because I can"" and the main quest is just sort of in the background, I honestly havent thought about it, because all the quests are similar, and the other quests are necessary to level up, as opposed to in Mass Effect (for example) I was too sidetracked with completing every single world and every quest that the main quest got left behind and I didnt really want to go into it. It suffers from ""THE WORLD IS GOING TO END... but let me do some shit on the side before I get to saving the universe"" syndrome. Borderlands doesnt do this because hey, the vault isnt going anywhere.

I should mention that I love both linear games that focus entirely on a ""main quest"" i.e Bioshock series, and Open worlds (FNV, Oblivion, KotOR etc) but I really think that Borderlands has nailed it in terms of keeping the gameplay relevant to the world. (so far)

However, I do see 2 options when buying from Amazon. For example: [AoE III](http://www.amazon.com/Age-Empires-Complete-Collection-Download/dp/B00AR05D78/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359590056&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Age+of+Empires+III+Complete+Collection). One says *Standard* and the other *Standard-Steam DRM*.

Are there any upsides/downsides to using one over the other?
From what I understand, if I delete a game from my computer, I can re-download from both Steam and Amazon... so that seems equal.
Of course, I always hear DRM bad, but Steam good... so what does *Steam-DRM* mean?

I had this game on my backburner because everyone said it was boring to play alone.  I've leveled up to lvl 20 alone (so about 10 hours), and it's a shitload of fun.  If you've enjoyed the Diablo, Torchlight, or Phantasy Star Online games where you kill bad guys for ever-increasingly awesome loot and strength, then this is absolutely a fun single-player game.

I really don't understand why even in our own [/r/borderlands](/r/borderlands) , this is still treated as a multiplayer-only game.  I'm sure it's loads of fun with friends, but it's incredibly fun if you love the thrill of leveling up and acquiring loot (there are over a million guns for you to find in this game).

1371813578.0	1gsed1	First impressions - Alan Wake, Bioshock, Super Metroid	Thundahcaxzd	56	12	34	"**Alan Wake**

I just played the first episode and although it seems like a decent game that I might one day finish, I have yet to pick it back while also in the midst of Bioshock and Super Metroid.  Its a cool premise but here are my problems:

* from a storytelling perspective - everything is waaaay too explicit and narrated.  This is a videogame not a movie - how about letting me figure some stuff out some of the time?   If the past decade has tought us anything about videogames as a unique vehicle for narratives, its that you dont have to shove them down the player's throats.  You can leave clues and morsels scattered to be discovered at the player's whim.    Alan Wake shoves the plot down your freaking throat and for that, it suffers.  Also, I found it incredibly difficult to find myself immersed as Alan Wake.  He had such a strong personality and endless voice that I couldnt get into his shoes and imagine myself in his situation.  I couldnt *become* Alan Wake, I was merely controlling him periodically.  This sort of mistrust inthe player to find and understand obvious hints/plot devices int he game world really killed it for me, and Alan Wake is sucha  plot heavy game that it was a huge turn-off
* the combat needs work.  enemy encounters are unneccasarily prolonged and can be kind of unfair.  in a game like this the combat should only serve the purpose of advancing the narrative, instead it feels a bit like a chore


here are some things that I liked:

* this game got the hair to stand up on my neck.  It certainly had its moments that made me tense and afraid.  enemies are difficult to see and come from nowhere. I found myself running through several areas of the game out of fear rather than exploring 
* although I disagree with the way that its told,, the plot seems interesting and engaging.  this is what will eventually bring me back to this game
* beautifully voice acted, beautiful environments, excellent atmosphere

**Bioshock**

So far I'm loving Bioshock.  Ive only put about 3 hours into it (Im in Neptunes Bounty).  The combat is fun and interesting but I do have some problems.  Mainly, Im dissapointed at the lack of penalty for death.  Big Daddy fights are difficult but as it stands, I can choose not to use my first aid kits and just eat some deaths because why not?  Theres no cost to respawning and enemies are still at reduced health when I get back to them.  I think I still really suck at this game which is why I have trouble with Big Daddies but Im working on it.  Absolutely loving the atmosphere in this game and supposedly there is a great story too but Ive yet to understand it.  Please dont reply with any spoilers.  

**Super Metroid** 

fuck this game is hard.  This is a game that Ive wanted to play for a loooong time and Im finally getting around to it.  but its so cryptic where you're supposed to go and so many necessary rooms are hidden with no direction whatsoever. Its definitely designed to sink a lot of time into (If you know where to go, I dont think it takes very long to complete) but Ive been using guides when stuck to see where to go.  IF you appreciate it as the genre-shaking game that it was when released then its definitely a n experience to behold.  Im loving it, even if I cant spare the time to spend hours shooting random blocks hoping it opens a secret passage that I need to find before progressing.  It definitely helps me appreciate the Metroid Prime series more which was my introduction to Metroid.  Loving this game, I *will* beat it.  "	t5_2t3ad	True

EDIT: I'm a Brit so any of those Japanese or US only titles would probably be impossible to get ahold of...don't think any have appeared yet but just a heads up. Thanks for all the ideas so far though :)

EDIT 2: Got the PS2 with no games (the guy refused money for it) and a friend is selling me 12 games for £8 and some food (about $13). There's Okami and R&amp;C3 and Jak &amp; Daxter 2 and SSX Tricky and a number of other things in there; with that and the 300 other games I have I should be busy for some time :)

1371135330.0	1g9qzw	Good Time To Get a Wii U in the Next Few Months? Or Just Get a Wii?	_Lyrebird_	54	12	43	"So, new consoles are rolling out, and I'm opting out of PS4/XBO and instead just sticking with PC for the big releases. I don't have a Wii but I was looking through all the games I missed that I've really wanted to play and Wii games are getting pretty cheap on eBay, as is the console. I'm wondering if it would be better to just spring for the Wii U, though, as there are only like ten games I really want to play for the Wii.

A few questions: Is there going to be a price drop for the Wii U in the next few months, like before 2014? And more importantly, how is the backwards compatibility on the Wii U? Is it spotty, like X360 playing XBox, or does everything pretty much work? If the backwards compatibility is good I might go for it, as there are more games I'd be likely to play with the Wii U and Wii libraries combined than just the Wii.

In summary: Wii U good value in the coming months or just buy a dirt cheap Wii for the ten games I want to play?

EDIT: I'm gonna wait a few months and go for the Wii U. Backwards compatibility + future proofing is great and I hear they're trying to get core gamers back, so I'm cautiously optimistic about future titles. Thanks for the help, everyone.

It seems that many people are truly patient gamers, in that they want a game but they will wait until it's cheap enough to buy it. I'm slightly different. 

Growing up I'd buy a new game ASAP if I could afford it, I couldn't wait to play the latest game. Now I can afford it if I really wanted to but it's just not as important to me any more. Since I don't play games all that often I find that I'm continually playing old games.

Now, that said, if that wasn't an issue I'd still wait for the price of a game I wanted to drop. I'm happier to wait a few months to get a game half-price. I'm a patient gamer who happens to be late to the party anyway.

Tularemia	44	6	21	"Thanks, r/patientgamers! Hopefully at least one of you might enjoy checking out one of these games for the first time.

&gt; - **The [Freedom Force](http://store.steampowered.com/app/8880/) series**: These games are an unholy and amazingly fun mix of a tactical strategy game and squad-based RPG. The [art style](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9e0E45ipTs) of these games is unlike anything I've ever seen in a game.

&gt; - **[Stronghold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronghold_%282001_video_game%29) and its pseudosequel [Stronghold Crusader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronghold:_Crusader)**: A mix of castle-building sim and RTS, these two games are a lot of fun. The soundtracks are solid, and the 2D graphics still hold up surprisingly well.

&gt; - **[Tropico](http://store.steampowered.com/app/33520/)**: Hands down, one of the most fun sims I've ever played.

&gt; - **[DEFCON](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mef2qRua4Oo&amp;feature=related)**: I know a lot of people picked up this up during the [Steam sale](http://store.steampowered.com/app/1520/) or the Introversion Bundle, but for any fans of strategy games who didn't pick it up, I can't recommend it enough. Online play was relatively active last time I played around Christmas, since many people have recently bought the game.

&gt; - **Darwinia and [Multiwinia:](http://store.steampowered.com/app/1530/)** If you're looking for a weird new strategy game that is [completely chaotic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INYBHqRqGY0), this is a must-have. Another Introversion game a lot of people may have picked up recently.

Skyrim: £9.99, Dishonored: £14.99. And also a lot of other games, some of which can be redeemed in steam. You get an additional 20% off if you use the coupon code NOV20OFFUK (Skyrim will then be £7.99 which is around 10 euro, and Dishonored £11.99). They will send you the retail keys by email, which you can activate and redeem in steam! Voila, you have both games in your steam account.
(To make this perfectly clear, you only get the key, not a physical copy of the game.)

Country Requirements: The offer is valid in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom, Iceland, and Norway.

Downside: You need to open an account on gamefly, and you need a credit card for the purchase which will then be linked to your account. Also, don't make the mistake I did and buy other games on there which can NOT be activated on steam, because you will need gamefly's crappy proprietary client to play it.

List of games which are redeemable on steam even if bought elsewhere as long as you have the activation key: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7480-wusf-3601

IMPORTANT EDIT: Despite what I said in some of the comments, some people reported the keys DO work in the US, too! Sorry about that. You can apparently also use a proxy for the purchase. I just wasn't sure and din't want to make people buy stuff and end up with an invalid key. (Coupon code: NOV20OFF, without the UK bit at the end.) Thanks to kevinwit and clavicle.

Weapons seem to break after a dozen hits and the inventory system is equally stupid (why can't I just select weapons!? I don't want to drag them to a slot). To top it off, the mouse in menus is slow as hell but everything in game is too sensitive.

The whole online thing confuses me too - I can join games...but not gain progress? I've ragequitted a few times so far but I don't want to judge it based on the hour I've played (done the intro; onto the 'clear the lighthouse' bit), but I don't really want to slog through it if it's just all going to be as bad.

EDIT: I gave it one more shot (rerolled as the sharp weapons woman) and went back in. I think most of it was a thing of getting used to (movement at least) as well as the Dead Island Helper to reduce the stuttery-ness. I mapped the quick inventory to mouse down, so I had some kind of scrollable weapon select. I'm now a few hours in and enjoying it quite a bit - I guess it was mostly a matter of getting into it.

1324453317.0	nl13v	Running a few game giveaways to celebrate our involvement in Steam's giant holiday sale and treasure hunt.	AragonLA	53	16	188	"**UPDATE**: The contest winners have been picked, with all details in the applicable giveaway comment threads below. Thanks so much everyone for making this an awesome experience. Hope everyone has a safe and fun new year!

**Original**: Hi r/patientgamers, one of the Arcen Games guys here. To celebrate our involvement in Steam's Holiday Sale and Gift Pile Treasure Hunt we're stopping by some of our favorite medium-sized gaming subreddits to run a few giveaways of our games now through December 31st. (We'll also be hitting r/gaming at some point, if you happen to be one of the near 1 million subs over there as well.)

What we'll be giving away, and where you can get it if you don't win it:

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10, make sure to take advantage of the hefty discount.

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, Impulse, and GamersGate. Currently in public beta the game is not yet available on Steam, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads). The AI War and Tidalis demos are also available through Steam, though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime in the next day or so, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, points, and participants to add some incentive for those participating to upvote and get everyone here involved. Basically, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates and discussion.


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love,

[Arcen Games](http://twitter.com/arcengames)

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, rather than find the closest number submission. Shouldn't everyone get an equal chance? If 3 people choose 13, 14, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*"	t5_2t3ad	True

My own benchmark is 50 cents per hour. I put together a spreadsheet of my Steam library and I'm averaging 36 cents/hr played across all purchases, including unplayed games in my library. This is probably representative of all my purchases in recent years.

Do you have a dollars (or other currency) spent/hours played benchmark? Have you tried to track it?

Magicka is £8 on Steam and £1.30 on Android. I also prefer Anomaly: Warzone Earth on Android to the PC version because they removed the tedium of looking for the abilities.

It can easily be said that was and amazing experience and story.


The ending was unforgettable mostly because it was just 30 minutes if pure **glory**.
It showed all the heroes getting out of the evil baddie's hideout and gave you a voyage over the whole world that i fought for the whole 40+ hours that i invested in it.

It accompanied by an unforgettable orchestra which gave the feeling that the world is finally saved and  could have finally time to recover and start anew.


Those who didn't see it or just want some nostalgia can see it here:

That leads to my question:

Why don't more games do this kind of glorious ending orchestra stuff?

And if you know  more games that do - please don't hold back and post it :).



Reasoning of this question:

I guess this is derived from the thoroughly disappointing ending that FF VII had (finished this winter).

Pretty much 100% as well - only thing I need to do is max all Arts and get more Affinity Coins for best possible Skill Links.

But other than that I've killed all the superbosses, refined all the rare and most valuable VI gems at their highest percentage, trudged through the *hefty* 480 quest list, all characters level 99, all character have at least the best end-game gear.

And you know what? I'm excited to play through it all again in New Game +. The only thing that bothers me is that aside from my characters - everything stays the same. None of the mobs raise in level to match mine (would've been so much fun and challenging) but I'm using this round to listen to the English voice acting (as a Brit, they make me *freaking cringe*. Also, *any Doctor Who fans here? Melia's voice actor is Oswin Oswald, The Doctor's newest companion!*) and I actually made my poor SO print out a spreadsheet for me of all the Unique Mobs so I could gleefully tick/cross them off the list once I've killed them.

I love this game. The only thing that bothers me about it is that sadly it suffered through Nintendo Wii's maximum graphics (would've loved to see Eryth Sea in HD...) and that the English subtitles were English voice acting subtitles - not Japanese translation (wish you could choose.)

1334338052.0	s87ez	Hello patient gamers!  I invite you to a new subreddit, /r/Videogamereviews.	illreditlater	52	10	16	"I have spent the last month or two coming up with ideas and the subreddit is now finally open.  [/r/videogamereviews](/r/videogamereviews) is a place where you can post your own reviews and read other reviews on games.  I believe that [/r/patientgamers](/r/patientgamers) is a cool community and I know a lot of people are always coming here for suggestions on games and I'd like to make [/r/videogamereviews](/r/videogamereviews) a place for people to read reviews by other redditors.  

There are only two major rules we would like people to follow.

One is a grading scale.  This might change in the future and is up for debate, but we would like people to use a specific grading scale for the title of their post.  Inside the review the writer can use whatever grading scale they would like, but in order to keep things unified we are going to try and have everyone use the same scale for their title post.  The grading scale is as follows:
***
5/5 - A game you would recommend to everyone regardless of a persons tastes.  You think that everyone should play this game and that most people will like it.

4/5 -A game you would recommend to most people, more specifically to those who enjoy the games series, genre, or to new comers of the games series/genre.  Represents the ""best"" that series/genre has to offer.

3/5 - A game you would recommend to people if they enjoy the series/genre.  Represents a good game of the series/genre.

2/5 - A game that is not recommended due to it's flaws.  Represents a title that can only be enjoyed after over looking major flaws.

1/5 - A game that is not recommended to anyone.
***
The other major rule is the title format.  The title format is pretty simple:

[System] Game - #/5  - Title of review (only if you want to add one)

for example...

[PC] Minecraft - #/5 - A fun multiplayer building game!

or 

[Multi] Skyrim - #/5 

Before posting just give the sidebar a quick read so you can read all the other smaller rules at [/r/videogamereviews](/r/videogamereviews).

Besides that, you have freedom to write the review however you feel fit!  I'm currently writing a guide/FAQ on writing reviews with different ways you can do so, but I'll need more reviews from other people so I can link some examples and add other styles over at the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/videogamereviews).  You can write short reviews, long reviews, detailed reviews, a review that breaks everything down, or whatever you feel like!

We currently don't have any reviews except the reviews I have written.  I'm really hoping that we can get the word of this subreddit out there and get more people to post!  Our goal is to have a nice community where you can look at others opinions on a game before purchasing a product as an alternative to big unreliable websites like IGN.  In about a month we will see how things are going and change, add, or remove rules to shape the community how people want it to.  We are open to all suggestions and criticism!  We also have some ideas for the future that we will discuss once we see how the reddit expands.

Thank you everyone who has read this all.  Your reward is this picture of a bunch of [cute corgi puppies](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbv8hpG9pE1qbwakso1_1280.jpg).  Have a good day and I hope that some people post some reviews!"	t5_2t3ad	True

Of all the games I have so far, Here's what I think about them:

* Skyrim: Probably the game I have enjoyed the most. Have at least ~60 hours on that game. Skyrim looks amazing and I love how it's super easy to get into for a person who has not played RPGs before.

* Borderlands: I think it's okay. The story is rather dry at times and since I am so bad at comparing weapons I spend alot of my time doing that. Also, I feel the gameplay gets sort of repetitive.

* CODMW: I found this game to pretty good. Fun, but not shell-shocked when playing. I like that it doesnt try to be too much. 

* MW2: I thought this game was sort of a let down. I can't really put a set category on why I didn't like it but I can't.

* TF2: This is the only multiplayer I play. I think it is fun. Not much to say.

* Portal: I loved this game almost as much as Skyrim. It is short, sweet and provides a lot of mind-bending puzzles for 19 levels. GLaDOS is hard to beat as well.

* BioShock: I am about halfway in this game. I like the gameplay and think it is very enjoyable. But I find the story quite frustrating as I am often turned around and told to go somewhere else because something went wrong. As a result, I feel like I am making no progress and somewhat ruins the fun.

* Fallout 3 (I just bought this at the Summer Sale): I just started the game and am liking it. However, I having trouble getting into it. Also, for someone who is used to shooters, I find the gameplay...weird. The VATS system makes it easier to shoot but harder to kill people. Also, if you dont want to use VATS, at least in the beginning, you cant shoot with a scope. Maybe if I understood it more, I would enjoy it.

Games I havent played yet:

* Bioshock 2
* Fallout NV
* Portal 2 (very excited to play this)

Hopefully you guys can help me find some games before the sale ends.

EDIT: I have decided to get Chivalry, CS:GO, Organ Trail, and the various Half Lifes (havent decided whether to do Black Mesa vs Half Life with the HD mods and such).

Is it worth playing through if I hate the combat to the point where it sickens me? Or is there an easier way to deal with it? I was also wondering if the 2nd provides a better combat experience.	t5_2t3ad	True

Seeing as how Skyrim has been at $60 for so long, I promised myself that I would only consider buying it if it ever went on sale - and now it has!

A large number of my friends got Skyrim when it came out, and I would like to have shared experiences with them. But at the same time, I have a nice big backlog to play through, which includes two other Bethesda games (Oblivion and FO:NV) that I haven't even touched. Is nearly a year patient enough for TES:V, or should I convince myself to wait longer?

On a similar note, Morrowind is also on sale (for $10); with the recently released overhaul mod, would TES:III be a good purchase?

I'm in the Big Brother/Big Sister program and my lil' dude is turning 13. We've been paired up for almost 5 years now! I can't believe how time flies.

Birthdays used to be pretty easy for me. I'm a Nintendo fan and he had a Nintendo DS, so I could make a quick stop and have a pretty good idea what game he would like.

Sadly, his mom hocked his DS around 6 months ago and I can't afford to get him another one (she'd probably pawn that, too). However, I just found out that his mom's boyfriend (they've been together for 3 years or so, so he probably won't be disappearing overnight) scrounged up enough cash to get a PS3.

Unfortunately, I have no idea which games for PS3 are worth playing. So, my request from all of you patient gamers:

**You have the entire PS3 back catalog at your disposal. What are a few of the MUST HAVE titles that are age appropriate for a 13 year old boy?**

For example I have a strict rule about buying games on steam, I will only spend a max of $10 on a game I expect to play now, or a max of $5 on a game I expect to play soon.  

The way I make up for this a lot is to watch Let's Plays.  For example, I am watching [Jesse Cox's Far Cry 3 Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lufk-R1cuok&amp;list=SPFx-KViPXIkG98ljzGGAjpq_IeFnsy86z&amp;index=1)  and having a great time with it.  

I've also recently joined [r/LetsPlay](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/) and been enjoying finding new and smaller Let's Players who have introduced me to many cool games both indie and AAA titles.  

In the end, I also use Let's Plays as a way to decide if I want to buy a game, because I can see actual gameplay and make educated decisions about if I would enjoy what the game has to offer.  This is compared to written reviews or PR trailers which I have found to usually provide very little actual information about the gameplay.  

So do any other patient gamers take this rout to spending less on games?"	t5_2t3ad	True

Now to the main subject.
I posted a question on r/patientgamers(so this makes me think the person came from there, but you never know) asking if anyone still plays Borderlands 1 PC Multiplayer. Cause, you know, curiosity. About 5-10 minutes later, my Reddit messages thing was orange. I jumped with joy, I love seeing that turn a beautiful orange. Hopefully others can relate! I looked at the new message, and it was a Private Message. Not a comment, a PM. It was just a code. It didn't have anything like ""Have fun,"" or ""Had an extra code, here,"" just a simple little code. I didn't understand at first, but then thought it looked like a Steam Game code. Decided I'd experiment, went to my Steam account(ShyDash88, by the way, if you want to add me!), put in the code.
I got RAGE (NA) which is North America, if you don't know for some reason.
Some guy on Reddit. They bought me RAGE, and I have absolutely no idea why. I haven't said the word RAGE in any of my account's comments OR posts. How did they even know I didn't have it?
But...thank you. I won't say your username, because people will probably spam you saying I WANT A GAME TOO!!! or something, but I'll just say thank you. Thank you thank you thank you. I know I already sent a message saying thank you, but I wanted to say it again. Even if it WAS just a code for a game you already have, it's just very unlike our humanity to see a person give some random person a game for absolutely no reason.
If there is a reason though, please tell me. I would really like to know. I just can't believe someone would be so kind! If there is ANYTHING I can do to return the favor, I will try to. Thank you very much.
One last time, thank you.

I like the idea of a modern, hardcore RPG with genuine challenge to it. I've certainly never played or even really seen one before, but I want to. But there are two impressions I've gotten about Dark Souls that really scare me.

First: It supposedly has a lot of cheap deaths. i.e. dangers you could never have foreseen that kill you instantly, stuff you can only get past through trial and error after suddenly dieing. I distinguish these deaths from ordinary challenge or difficulty. Pointless stupid deaths take me out of a game.

Second: It looks like it might be highly scripted. By that I mean a lot of the encounters I've watched kind of look like raiding in an MMO, but singleplayer. Combat amounts to moving in the correct, pre-determined pattern and pressing buttons in the right order, again figured out through trial and error. Not very dynamic or replayable.

So how true are either of these impressions of mine, would you say?"	t5_2t3ad	True

""what are you playing this week"" time again.

I finished up **Dues Ex: HR**. Great game, so glad I gave it a second shot, the sneakiness...oh the sneakiness.

Next up for me is **Mass Effect 3**, I took a break from it a few weeks back after having to play the first 5 hours twice due to starting with a save file I never intended to use. I should also add I loaded up **Titan Quest** for the first time this past weekend.

**When:** Saturday March 2 @ 3PM EST.

**Where:** Trading 1 and the SMNC community mumble - fish.mumbleboxes.com Port: 36063. Look for the temp room titled Newb Nights.


**What:** The goal of Newb Nights is to help new players learn the game so they'll hopefully stick with it and boost the population. We will be pairing up new players with experienced players who will offer advice on overall game play and pro specific advice. A lot of us have extra products, so some of us will be sharing those with new players. (Completely optional for our experienced players. Don't feel compelled to give up your extra products if you dont' want to.)


Please show up **BEFORE** 3pm so we can make up teams. We'll try to swap out the players so that all the newbs who show up have a chance to play and each newb gets a chance to work with a different experienced player. New players, please show up and be ready to learn


And even if you don't have a mic, you need to be on Mumble. We need to be able to communicate with you and give you pointers and tips. Players can't stop to type in the middle of a match.

If for some reason you signed up for secret santa but did not receive a pm please pm me and ill look you up. 

Remember the shipping deadline is 12/14 (just got my santees gifts this morning and i think s/he'll be quite happy) but the digital deadline is 12/30 so everybody can make the most of the christmas steam sale. Although the [autumn sale](http://store.steampowered.com/) is going on right now.

As for all the [santa thanks] posts that are appearing. I understand that we are all happy and excited about our gifts but /r/patient gamers will get quite boring if thats all we see the month of december. So starting today we will have an official [Santa thanks] thread where you can post all your great gifts. We will make a new one each week so that it'll always be within the first few pages of /r/patientgamers. 

As for confirmation, were not requiring anybody send  confirmation just now.(it would honestly be to hard to keep track of if everybody sends over weeks). just keep proof that you did send your gift and well just check for any (hopefully none) giftless santee a in January.

For some reason it was overlooked when it came out. I'd give it an estimated 15 to 20 gameplay hours, plus two DLC downloads. The gameplay is relatively fun, plays like a 3rd person shooter with some interesting light-based mechanics. The real ass-kickery in Alan Wake comes from the story. Silent Hill is probably the only game that comes close to the mind-bending level of ""WTF"" that happens in this game.

My one complaint, and it's a minor one, is that I went into the game expecting jump out of my seat horror. The horror in this game is mostly psychological. There are 'jump' moments, but the real horror to this game is a little bit deeper than cheap scares.

Update: Got it a few days ago. Not a huge fan to be honest, worth the $10 though I suppose. Checkpoints Suck, worst game mechanic ever! Upgradable stuff is always cool but it's not very deep.

###                      First off are **online requests** which will be green

 One of the few problems in waiting until a game is cheap to buy it is that the online community sometimes vanishes, or is out of your league. online requests are to help find other redditors for multiplayer, coop, or anything online. 

*Formatting:* put in brackets put the game and what you want to do online, in parentheses put the platform. Then add whatever else youd like. Whether it's specific times, instructions, rules, ext... 

##Examples

                                   [Need For Speed Shift Multiplayer Request](PS3) 

                       [Boarderlands Coop Request](PS3) every Saturday at 9:00 , all new players

                         [Rockband 3 Bandmates Request](360) Just add me and well play anytime


###Also new are **official game discussions** which will appear in orange##

This should make it easier to find a discussion of that game you are currently playing / just beat. (please check if there is an ongoing discussion post of a game before starting a new one)

*Format:* The format here is looser because there are so many different possibilities to discuss.  Some people may want to discuss the entire game, some just one aspect of it. Just put the word discussion in brackets at the beginning of the post

##Examples

                                      [Discussion] The music of mass effect

                        [Discussion] Anybody else currently in the middle of New Vegas?

1357595933.0	1656el	[discussion] Thoughts on Deus Ex: Human Revolution 	rda_Highlander	42	9	28	"Edit: I guess I should've tagged this as a ""review"" but whatever.

   I know it isn't a particularly old release but I got it on Steam for 5 bucks so just wanted to share. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is easily one of the best stealth actions of the decade. (I don't count ""killer simulators"" like AssCreed or Hitman - hiding in plain site is not quite the same as hiding in the shadows)

I really didn't want to buy it because I believed that it's just another overhyped killer-fest with a dash of stealth thrown in - but it's not. Gameplay-wise, it's everything I ever wanted from a stealth game and a bit more. I frankly can't describe *why* it's so great - but it is. It is really akin to Metal Gear Solid gameplay - you hide from the patroling guards, push yourself to the walls, get into air ducts, have an option to kill guards or simply knock them out, there's a close combat and the main hero even somewhat looks and sounds like Snake! Frankly, giant two-legged robots are the only thing that's missing here. And I mean it all as a good thing. Of course, the game also has plenty of other things, the main one being the fact that it's also an RPG - and again, one of the best RPG's I played lately. It's your decision, whether the hero will be a bullet-blazing maniac who simply kills everyone in sight (not that it's going to be easy - you're getting killed after, like, several straight shots), or if he's going to be a silent hunter, preying on everyone with a sniper rifle, or if he's going to simply be a ghost, moving silently and the enemies never even knowing he was there. There are also really complex levels, crazy long dialogue trees and a ridiculous amount of reading material - computers, pocket secretaries, news reports that will absorb you in the world like it's your own. But even better thing about the game is that it supports ANY way you decide to play it. (although, to be fair, achievements require a silent and evasive game style)

As a final word: besides a couple of boss-fights (the only issue of this game, I really don't like how they did it and don't really understand why) you can, in theory, walk through every level without taking down anyone in order to progress. I still have a couple of levels to finish it left, but it's already in my Top ten games of last decade list, if I ever make one.

Edit 2: I just finished it an hour ago and just wanted to add: do these guys rip off Metal Gear Solid on purpose? The final video and narration is basically ripped off final video sequence from any of MGS games.

Edit 3: How do you even outsorce the freaking boss fights?

TL;DR Deus Ex: Human Revolution is awesome."	t5_2t3ad	True

I have a huge gap in my gaming history knowledge from about 1995 till 2008 (when I really started).  Doom's crazy famous, but I don't know why.  What was gaming like before it, and what did it change, and how?  Was it different, or was it just really good?  How does Doom 3 fit into the Doom legacy?  

I'm looking forward to playing it, but I want to have a historical context to put it in before I do.

The other thing I'm interested in is modding.  I've heard there is (or was) a strong modding community, and some great mods that can help bring it up to date, but googling ""doom 3 mods"" just feels like I'm staring at a tidal wave, with no idea where to start, and what's good.

1354630691.0	149g32	"How to get new releases from Gamefly as soon as possible, tried and true, requires minor patience. Copied from my response to the ""Rent now, buy later"" thread. Thought it might be useful as its own topic. "	Scuzzbopper	44	11	16	"I've had a GameFly account for 6 years and I always get new releases a few days after they come out using the following method.

1. Assuming that you have the ""one out at a time"" plan, make sure you send your current game back so that GameFly receives it at least a week before the release date of the game you want. This creates the situation where they have owed you a game for an entire week. Normally they would just send out the next game in your queue immediately upon receiving the one you sent back but then, the magic happens...

2. Make sure that the new release game you want is and has been the only game in your queue for that entire week.

3. Boom.

I usually get an email on Monday saying that the new release game I have in my queue, that is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, has already shipped. I have never received one later than Thursday. I may be over doing it by having the full week buffer of being owed a game but there have been times where I sent back a game late only to have them receive it the Friday or Saturday before the Tuesday New Release day and I have not gotten the game I wanted as soon as I have with the one week buffer. 60% of the time it works every time.

On the subject of buying games from GameFly that you've previously rented and beaten; I have done this many times and there are great deals to be had on GameFly's used section but if you buy make sure you rent it first and then use the ""keep it"" option. It's usually cheaper and they send you the game case, manuals and any codes (like multiplayer) that would have come with it new. My only word of caution is that I have ""kept"" several games that I really didn't play very much after buying and realized that I was purchasing them based on the misguided belief that I would keep playing them for a long time. There is always a new game that I want to try and I usually don't go back to games after I have beaten them and moved on. It has been an expensive lesson a few times but now I just wait even longer and if the desire is still there, you know... Steam seasonal sales. :)

It's come to my attention (from many of you pointing it out, as well as myself noticing) that we're starting to get a overwhelming amount of ""game deal"" posts. In the past we (mods) have always been fine with whatever content the community wants, but now I feel it's reached a point where there have been enough complaints, and with good reason.

It certainly is getting out of control, all I ask is if you want to submit a link to a game at a good price, you add something to it ""is game X worth getting for $10"" -- something like that is actually asking a question of the community.



[Good example](http://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/uox5o/far_cry_1_and_2_on_steam_for_250_ea_today/)


[Bad example](http://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/uqy8x/dungeons_of_dredmor_is_150_on_steam_225_gets_you/)



Please let us know what you all think about this, it really comes down do what the community wants.

cheers,

Change that to read:

*  windowresolution=1280x720

You can set the window resolution to anything you want.  Play around and find the setting that is best for you.

You can also set the game to launch windowed.  Change this line:

*  fullscreen=true

to 

*  fullscreen=false

There are also other changes that can be made in the conf file.  Look and customize what works for you.  You may want to make a backup conf file before you play around too much (although you can always reinstall if you F' it up).

The clerk said that they were the same but SOL was a sort of director's cut, is this accurate? I didn't buy the SOL edition at his recommendation. It's not too late to exchange though.

Also, should I play Metal Gear Solid 1 first, or is it not necessary? I have a ps2, not a ps3 so downloading it off the PSN isn't an option. Realistically the only option would be to get it on windows or pray I find a play station copy. I should note this is my first foray into this series, ever.

I had heard good things about the game but really had no idea what it was about. I got it on a Steam sale and finally got around to playing it a few weeks back. At the start I was a bit miffed by the issues that came up due to it being old and a port, graphics/controls, but soldiered on. After the intro and going to Black Isle I was hooked. The characters were unique and fun, the music was awesome, and the gameplay was straightforward. Pey’j soon became a favorite of mine, I loved how he waves at the camera whenever you pointed it at him!  The game was a great mix of puzzler/action/adventure and I didn’t feel it was a burden to get all the pearls and shots of the animals.

I don’t want to get into the story, which is good, because of spoilers since this is patient games and people might not have played it.

I bought it as soon as I found out and it is an amazing game with some nice Wii controls.

1359079464.0	178acg	Just finished Max Payne 1 and 2 on PC.	IRSgimli	44	13	28	"**Max Payne 1:**  This game definitely shows its age in several ways.  While it may have been creative and original at the time, gameplay mechanics are poor.  Enemies can spot you instantly, which gets really frustrating.   There are also these particular dream sequences that involve following a trail of blood that are extremely annoying.  While the game has a noir feel, the story itself is pretty generic- tied together with a boring conspiracy- and some characters feel like obnoxious stereotypes.

**Max Payne 2:**  A massive step from Max Payne 1 in every way imaginable.  There are still some issues with stealth and enemy problems, along with that same conspiracy that annoys me.  However, gameplay aged terrifically, and the introduction of friendly AI works great.  The story is infinitely better, and some moments genuinely surprised me.  The characters are much more interesting as well, showing interesting transitions from the first game.  The female character is one of the best I've seen in games- Mona Sax nails the 'femme fatale' trope.

Bottom line: The second one is definitely worth playing, as it holds up well.  The first one does not hold up- although I think the second one benefited from the first since:

1) characters were more interesting because I already met them, and 

2) it looked significantly better to me in comparison to the problems of the first.

I looked up Ocarina of Time on Amazon and the resulting items were several hundred dollars each. I hear people refer to emulators on PC all the time and decided I need to stop sticking my head in the sand and look into this as an option, but I have a few questions.

Emulator related questions:  

1. Mostly the games I want to experience are NES and N64 games, is there a consensus on the most popular emulator that I should start with?
1. Do roms cost money and is running an emulator or downloading roms illegal?
1. Where can I go to find a place I can get roms that are safe/trusted?
1. If I do make it this far and actually get an emulator and a rom, can these be played with gamepad (such as an xbox 360 controller) or are they redesigned for kb/m?  

Zelda related question:  

1. If I was only ever going to play one Zelda game, which one would you recommend?

I can't think of any further questions at the moment; I did watch a youtube video just now on 'how to run an emulator' and it looked pretty complicated, but I imagine that after I do it a bit I will get the hang of it. And googling which emulator to get gave me so many results I don't even know how to choose one (the video used emulator-zone project 64).

If this is a taboo subject that I'm not allowed to ask about in /r/patientgamers please let me know of a more appropriate sub. Thanks in advance.

**EDIT**: You've all been a great help and I understand better both the functionality and the legality of emulators. I've decided instead of going this route to get a Gamecube copy of Zelda Collector's Edition which includes Legend of Zelda, Adventures of Link, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.

1342645757.0	ws4b4	Would you recommend the Thief games to someone who hasn't really played stealth games?	lordbulb	35	4	37	"I have a question. I think I don't like stealth games, but I'm not sure because I haven't really played any.

Recently I acquired Beyond Good &amp; Evil which is supposed to be one of the best games ever made. And it's really fun and engaging. Except that I had to do almost a whole mission on something like stealth mode. Crawling and trying to shoot some guards when they turned their backs. I didn't really enjoy it, I died a lot.

The question is, was it not as well made (I feel that the camera was almost awful, changing in very strange positions in very strange times) as a proper stealth game, or do I just suck at this kind of gameplay?

So is it possible that I can enjoy an entire game of crawling, hiding and shooting in the back?

EDIT: OK, I bought the package with the three games on Steam. I'll see when my crappy Internet service will be able to download them so that I could tell you some impressions.

EDIT2: OK, another question. How does Hitman do? It's also a kind of a stealth game, right? But there the point is to murder every one, just not by straight up going and shooting them with a shotgun. It's also sitting in the library waiting to be downloaded.

EDIT3: Oh, it's cakeday... Anyway, I've heard some good stuff about Splinter Cell, too. I guess it will bi on my wishlist for now, but I think 3 Thief games and 3 Hitman games should be enough for now.

And there were some mentions of NOLF. I remember playing this game, but in multiplayer mode with some friends in a game club when it was released. Never played the single player, but as far as I remember from the multi it wasn't exactly stealth. However, I actually wanted to ask if you have any idea where I can get a copy. Amazon/ebay? Because it seems it's not on Steam and not on GoG either. Do you have any idea if it can get released on any of those platforms. Are there usually some anouncements before a game is released or it just happens one day? Should I maybe wait for a digital version?"	t5_2t3ad	True

1337549713.0	twhrr	Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption	InconsiderateBastard	30	2	19	"I just picked this up and started playing.  The atmosphere in the game is quite nice.  The graphics are clearly dated (the game is from 2000) but overall I think the design of the levels and characters is quite good and the way lighting is handled and the fantastic atmospheric sound effects and music make it easy to get sucked into still.

I picked it up on a 2 CD set from Goodwill, so it has a 16 bit installer which naturally doesn't work in my copy of Windows 7 Pro 64 bit.  Like TIE Fighter, it was easy enough to run the installer in [XP Mode](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx) and then copy the game from the VM to a directory on my harddrive.

It detected my vid card fine.  It runs at my screen's full resolution.  It doesn't require any tweaks or compatibility modes to run.  Once it gets above 1280x1024, it does start to smooth out a bit too much for my liking though.  I will probably keep it at 1024x768 because the textures have a grittiness at that level that I think actually makes them look better.

I hear there is a modding kit for the game which I am thinking of looking into.  It has LAN multiplayer which could be fun to mess around with at some point with friends.  It's also available [for $6 at GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/vampire_the_masquerade_redemption) and their version will not require anything special to install on a modern OS.

To folks that have played it before: any tips or suggestions?  Are there preferred mods for it?

**Revised Setup**  
So, I installed in a Windows XP VM, then copied it to the host OS (Windows 7 64bit), but that prevents the patch from installing correctly.  Apparently the installer makes some Registry changes that the patch needs to read.  So, I would suggest installing it into a VM, then installing the patch into the VM, and *then* copy it to the host OS.

1328671902.0	pfpwq	Single player games with 'flow' that keep you 'in the zone'.	lensman00	31	1	66	"Sorry for the buzzword abuse, but I don't know of any other way to phrase the headline. What I'm curious about is this: what single player games have kept you entertained and interested from start to finish, with only a very minimum of micromanagement, stats grinding or slogging across empty screens?

I asked myself this question and could only come up with a few titles:

* Speedball 2 - top-down future sports simulation had great atmosphere, nice physics, good controls and a challenging difficulty curve
* Rails Across America - tight little train/economic sim streamlines management to put the focus on cut-throat competition
* Schiffbruch - freeware castaway sim with nice game balance in a genre (solo island survival) I really like
* Deus Ex - given the size of the game, there is very little wasted time

Of those four most delightful games, only one is really long: Deus Ex. The others seemed to know when to quit and call it a game. I wonder if this era when we measure games by 'hours of play' will yield as many great games that can keep a player not only motivated but truly immersed.

One thing I found interesting about this exercise is how many of my favorite games actually involve a lot of micromanagement, stats grinding and/or screen slogging. Diablo 2, THPS 3 and the Civ series fall into that category. Then there are other games like KOTOR that I've enjoyed a lot but have never completed."	t5_2t3ad	True

I know that the N64 is supposedly the greatest console of all time and all my nerdy friends would flip a bitch when I told them that I've never played Zelda or Mario 64 or Starfox. 

Anyways, I thought that I would never get around to playing those games because of all the awesome new games coming out constantly, but I recently have been living in my van which has a small TV in the back. There's no channels or anything and I don't really like movies (I have my laptop for that anyways) but I decided that it would be awesome if I picked up a N64 and used that to play single and multi-player games alike.

So I guess what I'm asking is... any advice for a N64 noobie? I've played Mario Kart and Super Smash brothers and stuff, but I've never owned one and I don't know many of the game ""essentials"" (ie the games that I absolutely must have).

1373389150.0	1hy0u0	Redditors Review: Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped	ImaginaryMan	36	8	8	"So, something weird happened this previous week.  I did a review of Borderlands 2 and then my front page was littered, absolutely FULL of Borderlands/ Borderlands 2 posts.  Did I cause that?  Most likely no, but it was terrifying for me to the point I decided to do the most retro review I have ever done.  Just to see if I could raise awareness about the VERY game that got me into hardcore gaming.  I say ""hardcore"" because I played games before this one on an old Sega Genesis I found in my parent's basement.  But this was the game that sealed in my love for Sony, my love for consoles, and my love of gaming in general.  This WAS my game, as I'm sure it was for some of you.  And even if you have no idea what this game is, then allow me to educate you on the greatest game of my childhood.


Crash Bandicoot is a Bandicoot that was given a mission by the magical mask of good, Aku Aku, to stop his brother, Uka Uka, from taking over the world with the nonsensical, yet aptly named, Neo Cortex.  He's aptly named because his brain is the size of a deck chair at Honey Boo Boo's house.  You throw up in your mouth a little there?  So did I.  Anyway, Cortex has help from his minions: Tiny the Tiger, who is anything but tiny, Dingodile, the half dingo, half alligator (I know!  I don't get it either), with an insatiable appetite for lighting shit on fire with a comically large flamethrower.  There's N. Tropy who attacks with a laser shooting tuning fork, and N. Gin, a half man, half machine, and who inexplicably has a rocket sticking out of his head.  As I said in my last review, I like diversity in a game.  And this game has quite a bit of diversity in it.  Each level has a significantly different feel from the last.  One minute you could be in the trenches of a medieval war, and the next, you're Crash's sister, Coco, riding her tiger on the Great Wall of China.  And it's actually a very simple game.  You may consider this a bad thing if you're into games where you have to master approximately 79,000 combos if you want to be even slightly mediocre in a game.  No, it's just Square for a spin, Triangle to check your status in the game, O to crouch, and X to jump (as standard with games of that period).  You get a new ability after every boss, like an upgraded spin or a bazooka that shoots Wumpa Fruit.  There's no health bar, but that's because the Aku Aku mask acts as a health bar, and invincibility after you collect three of them.  And when that fails, you always have Wumpa to fall back on.  There's enough challenge to keep you occupied for a long time.  To top it all off, it's fun.  It's a very fun game that will keep you entertained for as long as you need.  Or until the nostalgia factor wears off.  Usually, it's the latter.



But this is not a perfect game.  There is no such thing as a perfect game (cue the fanboy hate from any fandom).  There's plenty wrong with it.  The bosses are a little bland (minus the N. Gin robot fight).  It's a series of dodging and waiting for an opening, and then taking that opening, and if you miss that opening, you'll have to wait to do it all over again.  And, although I mentioned that there is diversity in the level design, the gameplay never really evolves from platforming, minus a few rail shooting levels.  Finally, the difficulty spikes would shame the most avid Dark Souls player.  I got my ass handed to me one level, then the next 6 I breezed right through.  It could just be from my rusted 3D platforming skill, but I had a hard time.


This is one of my favorite PSX games of all times and my nostalgic side is willing to overlook some of the issues.  It can get pretty frustrating at times, but I am willing to look over that.  And I will end with a message to anyone who reads this and works at Sony Santa Monica and/or Superbot: Please get Crash back from Activision and put him in PSASBR AND/OR his own throwback game!  It would be much appreciated and I'm sure there will be a lot of nostalgia dollars rolling in.  Please?  Do it for the fans?  Or the fan because I feel like the only one talking about it right now?


Oh, and I forgot to mention, you ride a baby T-Rex.

The only drawback is the game library, but when I bought the PS3 at launch, it took a year or so before it took off. If anyone remembers, the PS3 was $600 and the library looked like shit and was written as a failure back in '06.

I really hope they pull through this generation. It would be a shame the day Nintendo becomes bankrupt in the hardware industry or goes the way of Sega.

1362816241.0	19yonm	My Fable: the Lost Chapters Review.	ryano1106	38	5	15	"Well, its been a helluva ride, and I am sad that it is over, but I feel that I should share my experience. Fable is a story-driven linear action morality based RPG, made by Lionhead Studios and published by Microsoft in 2004, The Lost Chapters came out later to expand upon the original story. This is a review of the PC version for Windows.

**Environment**

 -Well, the atmosphere and environment of Fable leaves a little bit to be desired, I loved the English characters and the vulgar humor, but everything seemed to be copy+pasted, and the background NPCs were forgettable. The world seems huge, and that you can go anywhere, when really its all a big hallway, guiding you to the next area. I think the game would have benefited from a less linear world, not completely open world like Skyrim, but maybe many ways to go about your mission, or maybe to just explore.

*TD;LR: Good, but forgettable, and very linear*

**Graphics and Aesthetics**

 -I found the game world to be very good looking, as the graphics have aged well, I particularly liked the shading effects, and facial animation seemed to be the weakest link, but you get very used to it. Textures hold up, even up close, and hair is animated well. Flora looks good, but it is very forgettable.

*TD;LR: Very beautiful, shaders good, faces bad.*

**Music**

 -I loved the music in Fable, it fit the situations, and it was well composed, but had one downfall: it didn't have enough music, and I heard the same stuff every ten minutes, and everything was recycled.

*TD;LR: Recycled gold is worthless gold.*

**Voice acting**

 -The game benefited from its English voice acting, but, once again, it was recycled among the background NPCs, on the other hand, the supporting characters' voice acting was top notch, especially Jack's (the games antagonist), which was very nightmarish and smoky.

*TD;LR: Background voices are forgettable, important character voices are wonderful.*

**Presentation**

 -I love the way this game presents itself, and how epic the whole game feels, you never feel like you are unimportant. You know you are being taken for a fantastic ride.

*TD;LR not necessary.*

**Story**

-Now we get down to the meat of it, the game starts you off as a lone farmboy in the small town of Oakvale in the magical land of Albion. It is your sister's birthday, and you haven't got her a present yet. Your father says he will pay you for your good behavior, but, opportunities arise for you to make gold by other means, and even more, this is how the game introduces the morality system. Once you have the money for your sister's present, you go to give it to her, while in a small garden, you see in the distance a man being shot by a bandit, this can only mean the worst, you hide as a bandit clan invades your home and kills your family.They find your sister and mother, and question them about your whereabouts, for reasons to be revealed later. A little after most of the action is over, you sneak out of your hiding place to find your father's body maimed, and your mother and sister gone. A straggler spots you and tries to kill you, when you suddenly see a flash of light behind him, and he falls to the ground. You see a man with blue lines on his body, who identifies himself as Maize. He sees your plight, and invites you to come to the Guild of Heroes, to train and get revenge.

 -I love how this story starts out, and it only gets better from here on in. You feel like you should be there, and you should be doing this. There are plenty of twists and turns, and it really is a dedication to The Hero's Journey.

*TD;LR: Shit gets fucked up, you fuck shit up.*

**Gameplay**

 -Oh where to start, it is in the third person, and you have a multitude of paradigms to chose from, classic RPG stuff: Mage, Rogue, Warrior. This part game has some balance issues, as you could wear heavy armor as a Rogue and still be as sneaky, and there was no benefit from wearing Mage robes as a mage. Everything favors Warrior style, as the other class styles help your combat little. I like the magic system, and everything is very satisfying, decapitations are common, if you have the skill points, and every upgrade you choose effects your appearance, Warrior stuff makes you big, almost to comical levels, Rogue stuff makes you taller, and Mage upgrades put glowing blue lines on your body and your eyes go blue. The upgrade system relies on a God of War-esque experience system, as you kill enemies with certain methods, you get experience corresponding to those methods, along with general experience to spend on anything. Ex: If I kill a bandit with a headshot from my bow, I get Skill (Rogue) points to spend on Skill attributes. You increase your health by finding various potions around the world and upgrading Strength (Warrior) skills. Likewise with Will (Mana, Mage stuff), you find potions that augment your Will and upgrade your Will skills. You age as you upgrade skills, which gives you wrinkles and grey hair. Your morality also effects your appearance, when you are more evil, you grow horns and glowing red eyes, when you are good, you look more fair with a halo glowing above your head.

*TD;LR: Unbalanced, but still fun.*

Overall, I loved this game, and it will always stay with me, but with some issues, it is a flawed masterpiece. If there is anything I didn't cover I will respond to comments.

1360603483.0	18bgfx	My birthday is tomorrow and my brother said he'll buy me any game. Could you help me choose?	ThaiSweetChilli	44	15	63	"I want one of those games where people say is a must-have, a game that you must play at least once in your lifetime even if you can only borrow it from a friend or rent it or whatever. Kinda like Xenoblade Chronicles (if I didn't already have it!)

Games that aren't *too* hard to get.. such as Kingdom Hearts (the first ones) or Shadow of the Colossus. I have never played them.

I have most RPG games - KOTOR, DA:O, FallOut 3/NV, Skyrim.

Only games I can think of would probably be Star Ocean (don't remember which ones) The Last Story and Dragon's Dogma?

Thief fits that category and is currently on sale on Steam. But which game should I start with? The first one, Thief Gold?

1356583107.0	15i4o1	Finally, after many years and many save glitches, I have finished Bioshock. 	dont_you_hate_pants	35	4	15	"I bought this game 2ish years ago, and on my first play through I encountered a save glitch where no matter where I saved the game, the game would take me wayyyyyyyyyyy back to the Fisheries. After this happened a couple of times, I got frustrated because I'm also in school and my free time is very limited.  

Well, I have a week off for Christmas, so I decided to give it another go. I encountered the save glitch maybe 8 or 9 unique times, including after a marathon session where I played from 8 p.m. - 4 a.m., but it also managed to randomly save along the way (There's probably a patch for this glitch online, but I know that if I hook my xbox up to xbox live, my grades will go straight down the tubes),

But anyway, what I really wanted to say is that this game was very enthralling and the ending (I chose to save all the little sisters) was extremely satisfying. I usually play straight up FPSes b/c I'm so tired from school and work that I want something to play that does not require much thinking, but I was rooting around every cabinet and searching for every diary.

1333567496.0	rtcy9	Mercenaries 2 vs. Just Cause 2	wootootee	33	3	36	"It may be a tired formula, but I retain a love for sandbox games. Currently I'm playing The Saboteur, which definitely has its flaws but is also a ton of fun (the Nazis' stunned reactions to a tank I've just blown up is always priceless). 

Which brings me to my next purchase debate. Mercenaries 2 is made by Pandemic, the same now-defunct company that made The Saboteur and the excellent Star Wars Battlefront series. I'm also a humungous fan of the original Mercenaries game, which for my money is the best sandbox game on the PS2 (even better than San Andreas). Just Cause 2 is a seemingly similar sandbox game that implements a rope thing that can attach to virtually anything, which is fucking awesome. 

Both games take place in wartorn tropical environments, both are sandboxes, and both are sequels. Both games have stories that aren't worth paying attention to. Zero Punctuation's Yahtzee said both games were fun simply because they provide the player with a playground for destruction.  Just Cause 2 is a little more expensive than Mercenaries 2, but I'd be willing to front the cost if it's a substantially better game (as its slightly better reviews suggest). 

So I guess my question is: does Just Cause 2 make Mercenaries 2 obsolete? Are these games less similar than I think they are? Is it worth getting both? 

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses guys. From the sound of it, Mercs 2 is fun, but fans of the first one will be angry and Just Cause 2 is just (haha) an overall better game. So I'll go for Just Cause 2. Thanks, you patient gamers, you."	t5_2t3ad	True

ThaiSweetChilli	41	14	33	"I had been playing Tera and having fun up until it officially went Free-to-play (server queues, Guildies mysteriously giving-up on playing, doesn't really seem like much point when the people I wanted to play with disappear.)

My bf and I are looking for a game to play and GW2 was suggested. My main concerns are that it's FLIPPING EXPENSIVE. I totally get it may be justifiable for an MMO not having a monthly fee, it should have a high base price.

Buuuut as a patientgamer, and a total stinge with money, I'd like it to go down to at *least* £30, if not £25 ideally if I could squeeze it. I'd have to buy two copies as well as my bf is currently unemployed.

Another concern is that I realise the longer I wait, the less I'll be able to play it 'prime time.' Who wants to play on a completely empty server? Granted we don't really try to socialise with others and stick to just the two of us, but still...

Really though, this was suggested because we were looking for co-op games, or just games we could play together. But I think there's another subreddit for that? If I'm allowed to ask for recommendations here, I'll edit later and post more details. Please let me know?

**[EDIT]** Going to work soon so will post details anyway. They're all PC games because we're in a semi long-distance relationship. If we weren't I'd be asking for PS3/Nintendo Wii recs as well. The games we have are (or games we have thought of):

He/we don't like short-term games that are too easy or a potential waste of money. Example, Dungeonland

* Saints Row the Third - Too easy. We're playing on the hardest difficulty and it's still a piece of piss. It's gotten to the point where the only fun I have is stealing crappy cars and pimping them up, whilst dressed as a hot dog.

* Borderlands 1/2 - Played the death out of these games. So much that even the mere mention of the game drains me and I get crabby.

* Sanctum - I liked it, but it does sorely get repetitive after a certain point.

* Magicka - he isn't into that.

* Torchlight 2 - this game is very easy.

* Dota 2 - he isn't into that. 

* Dead Island - NO.

* Left4Dead/2 - more fun with a full group + played it to death when we always played on the hardest difficulty.

* Payday: The Heist - he's played it to death with his co-workers.

* Portal 2 - I'll ask him about it. I always see it on sale though, so I'd have to wait for the serious discounts.

* Castle Crashers - this seems more like a console game to me.

* DCUniverse - I really liked this game, but the blocky console UI pissed me off."	t5_2t3ad	True

I just want to know for those who have played the series: How much does/do your rating/choices/levelling affect the sequels? I usually play games for their story, not for completion, because I don't have the time to 100% much of anything these days.

1. Does my paragon/renegade rating carry over between games?
2. Does my level/point allocation carry over?
3. Does my gear carry over?
4. Is any of the DLC worth playing?

I'm not sure I'd like games like Oblivion or Skyrim, I'm more of an action, fps type person. Some past games I've enjoyed are GTA IV on PS3 (roommate's game two years ago) and DOOM 3 (the last game I played before HL:2). I did play Modern Warfare 2 which I thought was very neat, but it was a short game =(

I haven't played multiplayer much, but now I have a fast internet connection so I would definitely consider it. I watched some Youtube game play of Just Cause 2 and I really like that idea, I might try that one.

Are there any classic games I'm missing? I just bought a bitchin new computer, but I have no idea where to start since I'm so far behind. I post here because it seems like most of you would understand my position with just having finished Half Life 2 for my first time!

I was pretty disappointed when my Kinect understood about 50% of what I said. The headset, however, has about a 90% recognition rate. It is definitely a fun way to control my squadmates.

And what squadmates! They're really fun characters. It kind of puts Gears of War to shame that you can actually tell a story that goes beyond RAH RAH KILL, BRO! with varied environments and enemies. Never mind that the voice actors are some of my favourites from Street Fighter and Catherine.

Overall I was quite pleased with how the weapons worked, how reviving works, the upgrade system, and was very surprised by how good the visuals are, particularly the motion capture in the cutscenes.

[Keyboard Combo $150]( http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Keyboard-Software-Bundle-PlayStation-3/dp/B003RS1970/ref=cm_lmf_tit_1)

I just wanted to remind/warn you guys to keep tabs on the prices of the games you're holding out on, especially you console players. You don't want to get blindsided like I did.

another guy has a top post about deus ex human revolution being on offer, but you can get the boxed version from amazon at the same price and it's NOT currently on discount (it was cheaper some days ago and i got it for 4(!)$)

it counts even for new games, that cost an average 59,99 on steam (i recently bought xcom, 59 on steam vs 28 (!) on amazon.co.uk at day1).

Would it be too much to ask to get a list going of maybe some 2012 games that have dropped significantly in price so we can get some good stuff for this summer? I'm new to this subreddit, so if this already exists I apologize, but It would be great to see what everyone else is picking up to play for the next couple of months.	t5_2t3ad	True

1362666579.0	19ugbz	So far I'm hating Metroid Prime 3: Corruption - should I keep playing?  	Thundahcaxzd	39	11	17	"Alright, so I've only played through what I assume is the intro (probably about 2 hours long, for those of you familiar with the game what I mean is everything prior to being sent to Bryyo)

here are my first impressions:  Metroid Prime 3 takes everything that was wonderful and special about Metroid Prime and shits all over it.  Metroid Prime was a serene and beautiful game where you explore the ruins of a lost society of superior beings.  The calming atmosphere provides contrast to the tense moments of battle and emotional crescendos as you infiltrate enemy bases that have been erected on the planet.  The story is told nontraditionally, much of the plot being optionally accessed through panels left by the ancient civilization and by reading the computer logs of your enemies.  

Metroid Prime 3 is some fucking Michael Bay action movie with cringe-worthy dialogue and 1-dimensional, cheesy characters.  Rather than serenity, they try and throw in an explosion every 5 seconds which would be almost excusable if the sound-mastering wasn't so godawful (the explosions that are supposed to put you on the edge of your seat are quieter than opening a door).  There was a cutscene every other room that I entered, and probably more dialogue in the first half hour than there was in all of Metroid Prime.  Oh yeah, and once you get to Bryyo things get even better because you get some Navi-esque ""helper"" that will probably jabber in your ear every 5 seconds telling you what to do and making sure that you don't actually get to explore anything on your own.  And here is what might be the ultimate and most unforgivable crime of the first 2 hours of Metroid Prime 3: they put in a Meta-Ridley fight and its a *dramatic. fucking. setpiece.*  The Meta-Ridley fight from Metroid Prime 1 is one of my favorite boss battles of all time, it requires you to memorize a set of varied moves and the tells she gives before performing them, it requires you to be able to dodge all of these moves effectively, the boss is unrelentingly attacking you, her hitbox is small, and its a true test of skill that is absolutely fair and challenging.  And then the MEta Ridley fight from 3 is an on-rails shooter challenge that is basically ""see you fast you can press A"".  Un-fucking-believable.  As you can tell I'm a little upset because I absolutely love this IP and I can't believe they fucked it up so horribly.  I dont know how this game has a metacritic score of 90, probably due to the novelty of a FPS with wii controls.  However, I bought the trilogy set for the Wii and re-played through the first 2 with wii controls.  The novelty was lost on me, and this is shaping up to be a horrible game.  

I've pretty much given up on it because it has destroyed the main thing that made me love the first Metroid Prime - the atmosphere.  However, if you are a fan of this game and think I should keep playing - please tell me why.  "	t5_2t3ad	True

I'm building up a computer for mostly work purposes, but I'll definitely be doing alot of gaming.  Most of the games I have are older (Morrowind, Oblivion, the Fallout series, etc), and I don't really plan on buying any new titles until they are highly marked down.

I'm mostly concerned about games that already have issues in Windows 7 (like Fallout 3).  I checked some Steam forums but didn't see a whole lot.  I'm leaning towards Win 8, but the only thing holding me back is my Steam library.  Any thoughts?

I know a lot of people find it pretensions and while I certainly see where it comes from I think allowing the game such attitude pays off a great deal in the end.

1352184521.0	12putd	I just finished Assassin's Creed II, but I'm not sure I liked it.	impiaaa	39	12	27	"(I'm just jotting down some unorganized notes here to share. I might cross-post to /r/Games or /r/truegaming if you think it would be better suited there. I might also revise it and put it into a proper review later.)

Let me start with the things I really liked about Assassin's Creed II. First, and most noticeably, it is a *very* pretty game. I mean, I've seen a few awesome looking game environments (in screenshots and in-game), and this is certainly one of them. I imagine that part of that is due to the fact that Italy, the location of the game, is pretty, but the environment is really well modeled and nicely detailed, too. Also, the cities really felt alive. I haven't played many games that were supposed to take place in populated areas, but from what I hear, the problem that many of them have is that they feel dead. Maybe it's because there are too few people, maybe because the people are zombies (literally or not), or maybe it's because the environments don't look ""lived-in."" ACII definitely has very believable cities, with people all over the place, doing things, and interacting with each other and the environment.

Also, though initially I didn't like the multiple progress indicators (like view points, codex pages), I felt compelled to finish them (well, all but the feathers). The game really made me feel the progress I had made so far in regards for these collectibles, for example with view points filling in pieces of the map. I used the map quite a bit, so I like the positive feedback of finding and using a view point/checkpoint.

Again, surprisingly, I really liked the Villa management mini-game, where you put money into upgrades that make your town more valuable, bringing in more income. I thought it would be a hassle, but I ended up playing the game excited for my next building upgrade. Maybe it's more positive feedback? Maybe it's a break from the action? I don't know, but I liked it.

Now, let me continue with what I didn't like.

Oh boy.

Well, I should say first that I realize that ACII is considered a ""good"" game, both by critics and /r/gaming gamers. I'm here to say that it's a bit more complicated than that. Also, I never played AC (one).

The first (and last) complaint I had, while playing, was the ""over world"" plot. For those of you who don't know, the story goes something like, there's a corporation (secretly the Templars) who uses a genetics-based history-replay device, called the Animus, to try and find important stuff. The main character is Desmond, and he, in this game, helps other people working for the Assassins, to find the same important stuff before the Templars do.

Got all that? Neither did I. To me it seems like an incredibly contrived and unbelievable way of tying together a series that didn't really need it in the first place. I would be perfectly happy if the game was *just* Ezio's life (Ezio is the history-replay character Desmond plays as). Why do you need to play a game about somebody (essentially) playing a game? Just play the game! Also, DNA-based time-travel makes 0 sense. Finally, I could never really tell how far I was into the main quest-line.

My second complaint was the control scheme. I'm used to FPSs (a little), where camera control is on mouse, and movement control is on WASD, while you look from the inner-perspective of your character. This game plays similarly, but it was obviously a direct console port. It's third person, which makes sense for a game with parkour/street acrobatics, but it means restricted camera control. Not only that, but much of the camera control is automatic. Meaning, if you left the mouse alone, the camera will make some effort to follow your movements. This *would* be good, if the camera always knew exactly where you were going (which it doesn't). What results is a constant struggle between you and the game engine.

Another way it shows the console-port-iness is the context-sensitive and modal keys. For example, you'd think that spacebar, bound to ""legs"" by default, would make you jump. In fact, alone, it does nothing. To jump, you would have to use the right mouse button to *change your stance*, and *then* pressing spacebar jumps. Similarly, pressing ""hand"" (shift) will either activate, open, drop, grab, push, or tackle, all depending on where you are, what you are doing, what other keys you have pushed down, where you are looking, and the phase of the moon.

Next, even with this complex control scheme, there's really only one thing you need to know to get around: auto-run.

Auto-run.

*Auto-run.*

I mean, it's fun and all, jumping from rooftop to rooftop automatically, but taking control away from the player is a bad thing to do no matter what. It makes matters worse that the computer (already with its shown competence at the camera AI) gets to decide what you want to do. Argh.

The combat system kind of ties into this, too. (Melee) combat is incredibly boring, tedious, and linear. Basically:

1. Attack.
2. Hold defense stance, and counter-attack when the enemy strikes.
3. If that doesn't work, dodge instead.
4. Goto 1.

Any interesting, fun, or innovative moves are all carried out QTE-like by the (super-intelligent) computer. You can't tell it to move behind and strike their head, or trip them, or stab the guy behind you while he's not looking.

The reason this ties into the combat system is so: when I'm trying to run away from a fight, *do NOT* faceplant into a wall. Please.

The more technical problems I had deserve a mention, too. Always-online DRM is bad. Uplay is a tad annoying through Steam, and spending achievement points for in-game stuff is stupid. Mac-PC saves are only compatible through a hex edit. Mac version is unoptimized, but at least it's not WINE/Transgaming (doesn't look like it anyway) (also, be warned, Mac version takes total keyboard control, so no cmd-tab for you).

Anyway, the game was fun, and took up a good 30 hours, but I guess I just wanted to know I wasn't alone in my criticisms."	t5_2t3ad	True
