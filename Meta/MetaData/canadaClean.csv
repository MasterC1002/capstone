This is an attack on our civil liberties and the speed bumps we have built into our law system to protect them (like warrants). 

The government will also fund these private companies to spy on your internet use, making our own tax dollars spy on us. The bill is not being put to an open debate in parliament, or allowing the public to be informed about it. Please watch the video below and sign the petition.

Over the past year or so, I've noticed a decided shift in the dialogue here that is certainly more politically  polarizing than in the past. Despite all the discussion about /r/canada being leftist, I see this place as becoming hostile to any progressive thinking, with no healthy debate over ideas, just mindless attacks on segments of this country that don't fit nicely in a neo-conservative ideology.

I'm tired of reading about how everyone who lives in the Maritimes should just up and move and stop being an economic drain on everyone else. I'm tired of reading about how Natives are a problem. That rural Canadians and Northerners are a problem; that greedy boomers are a problem; that entitled young people are a problem; that immigrants are a problem; that basically every goddamned group that is not already making good money and working in the best economic areas of this country are a problem to those who do.

The idea that everyone should look out for themselves and fuck everyone else bothers me. Ayn Rand's philosophy has never bolstered a country to success as far as I am aware, but it sure helps people who don't care about others to justify their position. Moreso, the underlying mean spirit of hatred and disgust towards others just because they don't live or act a certain way is what really upsets me. I'm trying to raise my son to be tolerant and hold values of compassion, tolerance and understanding. Why are these considered weak or ridiculous?

I know this rant will just spur on more of the same, but I'm fed up with what I see. Yes - I am a bleeding heart, and I see nothing wrong with being someone who gives a shit about other people. Perhaps this post deserves to be downvoted into oblivion, which is fine. I just have sat back and watched this place become a cesspool devoid of actual, respectful discussion. 

**EDIT**: I want to thank craycraycrayfish for summarizing why this matters to me so much:
&gt;But people are getting more and more polarized and that terrifies me for the state of political discourse.

To be clear, I am not trying to state my viewpoints are more important than opposing ones. I put them out there to frame my experience and how I feel. The point is that we don't debate points here anymore, and that extremists from both sides shut down debate by using ad hominem attacks or downvote brigades before anyone can engage in discussion.

You may not agree with my rant, and that's OK! I embrace you for responding, and to everyone participating - this has been a good example of discourse.

**EDIT 2:**Well, this post has blown up far beyond my imagination, and I'm genuinely impressed by the dialogue in the comments. I've also enjoyed being taken to task by those who saw the room for discussion. I'm also not surprised that I've been called scum, retarded and the usual adjectives, or having every comment I've made (not only in this thread) downvoted by a throng. I'm honoured that this post has also made it to r/metacanada. I feel the response here warrants some acknowledgement about the state of political discourse in general, and for that, I'm glad I didn't delete my thoughts. Thanks for participating."	t5_2qh68	True

The letter reads as follows:

The Conservative government is getting ready to pass a Copyright Act that has one of the most restrictive digital lock provisions in the world. This bill will make it illegal to copy a DVD so you can watch it on your tablet - even if you are not infringing on copyright.

Liberals have listened to consumers, educators, artists, creators, innovators, and ordinary Canadians and acted transparently to propose amendments that strike equilibrium.

In just 72 hours, Bill C-11 will be reviewed clause-by-clause in a Special Committee before being passed.  This is our last chance to amend this bill and defend users’ rights. But we need your help to make them law. Now is the time to stand up for fair and balanced legislation. That's where you come in.

We have seen in recent months that, united, we can force the Conservative government to listen to you.

Please click here to sign right now - and tell the Conservative Government that it should not be illegal to circumvent a digital lock for a purpose that does not infringe on copyright.

Then please forward this email to friends and share the petition on Facebook and Twitter as widely as possible before the committee meets.

Okay, the letter ended above, but there are some things that it doesn't mention:

The Book Burning Provision:

27. The Act is amended by adding the following after section 30:
 
(5) It is not an infringement of copyright for a student who has received a lesson by means of communication by telecommunication under paragraph (3)(a) to reproduce the lesson in order to be able to listen to or view it at a more convenient time. However, the student shall destroy the reproduction within 30 days after the day on which the students who are enrolled in the course to which the lesson relates have received their final course evaluations.
 
Basically, it says 30 days after you have to destroy any copyrighted material you were given.  If it isn't done, all students in Canada will technically be criminals.


The Enabler Provision:

Section 27. (2.3) states:  “It is an infringement of copyright for a person to provide, by means of the Internet or another digital network, a service that the person knows or should have known is designed primarily to enable acts of copyright infringement if an actual infringement of copyright occurs by means of the Internet or another digital network as a result of the use of that service.”

This is the provision which allows websites with pirated works, and websites with links to pirated works to be taken down SOPA style.

Friday follow-up: [Final follow-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/ff69a/final_followup_to_today_rcanada_we_write_letters/)

**Update 8:00AM EST Monday**:

* Keep writing letters today!
* On Tuesday (and again Thursday) I'll make a thread where we check up on which papers printed our letters.
* Friday in Toronto and Vancouver, you will [get out on the streets](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fc4o3/attention_toronto_stop_ubb_rally_this_friday/)

So, those of us who are very internet savvy are pissed off about UBB, but for the moment the general population is in the dark because our news media has let us down. It's time for us to let them know this is an important issue.

**Here's what I need from you today and Monday**:

1. Pledge here in this thread with the name of the newspapers to which you will be sending letters to the editor (it's best if you live in the same city as the Newspaper). We'll make sure that **every major newspaper receives at least 5 letters**.

2. Spend the day writing a kick-ass opinion piece (150-300 words or it might be edited for length).If it's a financial newspaper for example, make sure to explain the economic repurcusions on small businesses. If you're in Saskatchewan, praise SaskTel!

    **Templates**: (See [my comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fbv3k/today_rcanada_we_write_letters_to_the_editor/c1erpdv) below)

3. You now have a unique letter written up, so you might as well send it to the following addresses (make sure you let them know it's been submitted as an editoral to your list of newspapers, **and that this is an election issue for you**):

   a) [Your federal MP](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/compilations/houseofcommons/memberbypostalcode.aspx?menu=hoc)

   b) [Your provincial party](http://www.accessibilitynews.ca/acnews/politicians/)

   c) Tony Clement (Minister responsible for the CRTC): minister.industry@ic.gc.ca

   d) Idustry Canada: info@ic.gc.ca

   e) Heritage Canada: Moore.J@parl.gc.ca

   f) Stephen Harper: Harper.S@parl.gc.ca

   g) Liberal Party: info@liberal.ca

   h) [Others places](http://www.antiubb.com/what-can-i-do/)


4.  I'll do a follow-up on Tuesday/Friday.

.

Very important: **Make sure you include your full name, address, and your phone number** (When you send the letter, not here on Reddit)

One BIG duck would probably, ya know, scare me enough to just…freeze while it came down on me with its big angry beak.

Of course, the latest offense being the re-introduction of the ridiculous surveillance legislation. Soon, Canada will join countries like the People's Republic of China, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia in having warrantless access to subscriber information about internet users. 

The reason this pisses off so many Canadians is because we are among the most voracious internet users in the world. In Canada there is no pressing need to take steps toward a surveillance society, yet we seem to be getting pushed in that direction. I am quite frankly tired of this shit, so let's talk.

How can we make this bill as politically costly as possible for Harper? 

Edit begins below this line 
---

Firstly, I cannot believe this thread got so many upvotes, to me it's a real surprise but it also feels good to know I am not alone in my thinking. I'm really glad that people are taking the time to write their own MPs, even though I am personally skeptical that all MPs actually read their mail. I hope that it's just the beginning of an actual relationship with your elected representative, and that you all keep an eye on what they say and how they are voting. 

My own ideas weren't that great. However, if I may nominate one post out of the thread that I think deserves extra attention, because it's buried underneath so many others, I will quote user Kedive right here:

&gt; ""I think we should hit Mr. Harper where it hurts and mobilize people to spread Mr. Harpers message of diminishing freedoms to where it can hurt him the most. In his home riding of Calgary Southwest. If we can convince enough people from his riding to contact him on this I think it might possibly make him do a double take on this bill if he feels his support from his major center is not behind him on this.""

I say take this one step further, and make a (roughly 5-minute) video interview of voters from Harper's own riding, in front of a local landmark that's well-known (any ideas?). Use one of those fancy video cameras that shoots crisp, 1080p professional-style footage. I would emphasize the Conservatives that disagree with the bill, because after all, these are the same people who want to abolish the gun registry and the long form census. It's a logically consistent position to hold. I think we can actually find common ground with each other on the internet, which is a great way to bring people of different political views together. 

I'm absolutely sure you guys could come up with a winning script for this hypothetical clip in another thread, but I think if we do it well, and the video becomes popular (I don't want to say 'shoot a viral video' because you can't, either a video goes viral or it doesn't - plus I think the term is kind of annoying). We could even upload the interview footage and crowd-source the editing. We need to show the public directly that almost all Canadians that use the internet are against this bill, not just the young people. Personally speaking I have talked to students, older people, a soccer mom and even someone studying to be a police officer that think this bill is a bad idea. However, I will admit I live in Québec so maybe I have a little sample bias. Either way, I would love to see this ball get rolling. Writing your MPs is one thing, but all too many times the message you put effort into writing falls on deaf ears. The internet, however, the very thing we're trying to defend - can reach millions of Canadians at home almost free of charge. I'd like to think we have nothing to lose if we make a good case against this bill in a simple, widely-viewed video. In terms of our democratic values, though, we all have a lot at stake. I'm all for protecting our children, and I would hope that my children will grow up in a Canada that has a free and open internet.

The woman in front of me asked him what he did to get sent to the back of the line. He replied that he went to go find a seat for his grandmother before and had lost his place.

Almost everyone originally behind him then offered him back his spot. At first he politely refused saying he would just wait. Of course everyone continued to insist that he takes back his spot in line for being such a good grandson. In the end he was forced to take back his spot closer to the front of the line.

My father was slowly loosing vision in his left eye. Being as how he kind of old school, he just kept it to himself until he was completely blind in the peripheral vision area of his left eye. He went to see an optician, who immediately sent him for diagnostic imaging. One CT and one MRI later, he was diagnosed with [Pituitary Macroadenoma](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPituitary_adenoma&amp;ei=tS8LUcmrKO2byAGUoYHAAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBjzb-E1S680MktJYZkou5LmeWMQ&amp;bvm=bv.41867550,d.aWc).

Now it has been about 4 days since this diagnosis, he has already seen a specialist in brain surgery at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. He was told that the tumor is growing upwards, which apparently is rare. It has pushed his optic nerve to the left by almost 1cm, and is starting to press on his carotid artery(the main blood supply to your brain). The artery issue is that it can lead to a stroke. So he is now on the top of the list for having surgery to remove the tumor. 

On to why I am happy to be Canadian, is that thus far....$0.....I am proud to have served 11 years in the Canadian Forces reserves so far, and get to see the positive effect of my tax dollars. Also being in school for health care makes me happy to see a system working well. The person that needed the care gets it.....no waiting for weeks to see if your insurance clears, or getting bumped by people paying cash upfront. Just the person in need, gets the help.

That's my rant for the night. Also, big thanks to all the medical personnel out there, especially the nurses, you kinda get the short stick with thanks."	t5_2qh68	True

I wanted to go to Vancouver, but it didn't end up working out. 

It was one of the most amazing things I have ever done. The whole country had amazing and beautiful scenery especially ~~except for parts of~~Manitoba. Despite what everyone says about Saskatchewan I enjoyed seeing the prairies. Ontario and British Columbia were my absolute favorites though. They both reminded me of where I'm from and it was a big motivator to get home. 

My trip consisted of

Ottawa to Sault Ste Marie
Sault Ste Marie to Kenora, ON
Kenora to Calgary
Calgary to Seattle

I'm currently in Seattle right now and I intend on making the rest of the drive home tomorrow. I just wanted to say thank you, Canada for the amazing experience you've given me the past four days. Your country truly is one of a kind.

Most Quebeckers are sick and tired of being a constant recipient of transfer payments and the resultant scorn from the rest of the Country.  The tuition hike kicked this off, but people are actually fighting for change so they can one day travel to other parts of the country without encountering a condescending ""How's it going spending my tax dollars there, eh?"" attitude.  You may not agree with the methods being used to protest, and there is a valid argument that this puts Canada in a less than shining spotlight and reduces tourism, etc, but those are temporary things.  The corruption in Quebec is world-class, and your transfer payments are going to gangsters, corrupt unions, thugs and politicians.  Students, and more and more, the general population have had enough of this, and are trying to turn things around.

This exchange can be found in the [Hansard](http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1) from yesterday's debate in the House of Commons. I'm rather stunned by his response to what was an extremely straightforward question, particularly for someone who has been given the position of Minister of Science and Technology. I'm not sure how else to interpret his insult other than he's suggesting the MP from Thunder Bay performs autoerotic asphyxiation? Someone help me out here... maybe I'm missing something, because that just seems way out of line.

The exchange:

&gt;**Mr. Bruce Hyer (Thunder Bay—Superior North, Ind.):** 
    Madam Speaker, there are many Canadians who do not understand the difference between science and technology. There are profound differences. I have no doubt that our government and the minister understand and support technology but I wonder if they really understand and support science.
    I have a broad question for the minister. Does he really believe in science and the implications of scientific inquiry? I have a more specific question that will put a fine point on it. There is a vast bunch of science out there that says that life was created on this planet three to four billion years ago, and there are other theories. Does the minister believe that life was created on this planet through evolution three to four billion years ago or does he subscribe to a different theory?

&gt;**Hon. Gary Goodyear:**
    Madam Speaker, what I would recommend to the hon. member is that when he tightens that towel around his neck at nighttime that he not do it for more than 20 seconds. It actually ends up causing cerebral anoxia that leaves permanent brain damage.
    What I can say is that we obviously support basic research all the way through to applied research. In fact, we are looking at particle accelerators that can create the next generation of medical isotopes. We are working on the CERN project, which is the Large Hadron Collider where we are trying to smash together protons. In Canada, we are investing in i basic research for the pipeline of the future and applying it so that we can create jobs today.
    The question is this: Will that member support this budget or reject it like he always has?

**EDIT: I am fully aware Canada is a federalist state, meaning provinces act with their own sovereignty over certain areas like natural resources. Thus, Canada only benefits secondarily (some taxes,  spin-off economic growth, wealth transfers to other provinces). I would suggest Alberta could much better manage its resources (financial and natural) by saving more of the profits by raising royalty rates and slowing development. This would increase the savings from the oil sands leaving corporations with less of their giant profits. Oil is scarce, they won't run away.**

My friend has a long story. Of canadian origin, he is now stuck in Pakistan.

Already abused as a child, no one would ever take care of him. He was and is still being physically and mentally abused. This goes from forced hormon treatments to stop growth, to beating him down with a stick. 

Asking his father for helping him with living expenses (he is a student), his father agreed under one condition. He would have to leave Canada for the time of college, getting his degree in his' mothers homeland Pakistan. As he agreed, he was imediately flewn in to Lahore, Pakistan. He can live with his uncle. In Lahore, his father took away the canadian passport and got him a fake pakistani one. New name, new DOB. One time he was in such a bad condition that he tried to commit suicide. He broke both of his legs, bringing him into the wheelchair. As the father (which is the canadian part of the parents) refuses to pay any therapy, it will take about 8 months until he will able to walk again. 
His uncle and his daughter hit him every day. The daughter hurts his already injured legs, risking to break it again. His uncle beats him daily with a stick, for at least 30-40 minutes. He called the police, but since there was not enough evidence they couldn't do anything for him. Other family members are on the uncles side or refuse to listen to his problems. He can go to college and has his own cellphone, computer time is limited. He doesn't know who to contact.

Social service? 
Canadian embassy?

Who can help him, and is there a way the he can be brought back to Canada?"	t5_2qh68	True

WTF!!!	Bayunco	1284	302	329	"I put a post on here a few days regarding Rogers sending my billing information to a different email address and I got pointed into PIPEDA ACT which is great information. when I called today to rectify all that, Rogers wouldn't even take my call. Apparently my personal information had gotten switched. when I tried to verify the information I gave was wrong. Rogers had changed my Information with the information whom they wrongfully sent my billing emails to. so Rogers made me go a Rogers rep center to very my information, the girl at the counter at the Rogers center was very helpful but clueless as to why I was there. she had no Idea why Rogers wasn't able to help me over the phone.

so I finally got my information verified and cleared so now I get to talk to a representative who kept asking me how my information got switched, this was kind of frustrating because this is the reason why I am calling to find out how this happened. the representative was polite to say the least but he wasn't able to help me. so I asked to talk to a manager. 

this is where I hit a road block. The manager reassured me that even though my billing information was emailed to the wrong person that none of my personal information was given out but according to PIPEDA this is not the case. when I argued this fact he asked me what I felt entitled to I find this really unprofessional. because I am not the person to do that, and I actually explained this to the manager. The manager also told me that the mistake is that the system level and that all they can do is fix the information. so he kept giving me the brush off and kept reassuring me that my rights under PIPEDA were not violated. at first he offered a 25 dollar credit voucher. then 3 months unlimited Data. I find this really bad business specially coming from a corporation that big. but that does not still excuse the fact that my information was sent to the wrong person, and then switched to that persons information. In the age we live now any information can be used for identity theft I don't know how the manager can reassure me that stuff like that doesn't happen in their company when even governments are targets of phishing scams and theft of personal information. this has happened to me personally to the point where my license was suspended from someone stealing my Identity. So I don't appreciate the fact that Rogers has try to down play this and telling me to deal with it.

More Updates to come

EDIT: I asked the manager to let me out of my contract without penalty, that's when he offered me the $25 dollar voucher I asked for 2 gigs data until my term is up he said he could do it for 3 months only. He told me the conversation was going in circles that's when the conversation ended."	t5_2qh68	True

1295883303.0	f83pu	To all of you who still don't understand what UBB is all about. Bell's on demand service charges $6.99 PER MOVIE, NetFlix is $7.99 UNLIMITED PER MONTH. That is all. 	panek	1564	596	433	"Older movies on Bell still run at $4.99 per. 

Now available to Canadians:

* [Boxee](http://www.boxee.tv/)
* [AppleTV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/)
* [NetFlix](http://www.netflix.ca)
* [NHL Gamecenter Live](https://gamecenter.nhl.com/nhlgc/secure/gclsignup?&amp;intcmpid=nhl-gcl-HS-CA-978x24) (all other major sports leagues provide similar services)
* [Google TV](http://www.ctv.ca/generic/generated/static/business/article1879356.html) (coming soon...)
* iTunes
* PS3 store
* Xbox store

All of these will impact your bandwidth. By Bell imposing ridiculously low caps and further charging per GB, you will not be able to afford these services (meanwhile Bell's on demand and Internet TV services will magically not count against your cap). This is an obvious financial disincentive to prevent you from accessing these services. If everything were on equal footing, then the cheapest service would win out, wouldn't it? 

--------------

Great comment by [Graysdir](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/f83pu/to_all_of_you_who_still_dont_understand_what_ubb/c1e07a6) to those hating on Netflix (yes, we all realize that Netflix is in its infancy and that the selection sucks):

&gt;Netflix has been adding new titles [weekly](http://app.whatsnewonnetflix.com/).

&gt;But with UBB in place, Netflix will never have a chance to grow. Therein lies the problem. With 25-60GB caps with our ISPs, Netflix won't have enough subscribers to be able to afford to buy new content. Exactly what Shaw is hoping for.

&gt;I've heard rumors that Hulu was considering coming to Canada, but now that UBB is in place, they are reconsidering, because with these caps, it makes web video unavailable to the average Canadian internet user.

Seriously, how do you expect there to be any form of competition if Canadians won't have the bandwidth available to access these services? From a business sense, these services will just overlook Canada. It's not just about today, it's also about tomorrow.

--------------

Not available to Canadians, but may one day be:

* [Amazon On Demand](http://www.amazon.com/Video-On-Demand/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16261631)
* [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com)
* [Roku](http://www.roku.com)

The reason many of us Canadians don't even know about these products is because we have not yet been exposed to them. The second you actually see the type of content that our American counterparts have access to, a lightbulb goes off and you begin to question, ""why don't I have access to these services?"" It's a beautiful tragedy thanks to the likes of the CRTC and Bell. 

------------

The sad part is that they are killing more than just our access to Internet TV by attempting to limit our Internet in the ways that they have/are. 

[Case in point](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/f83pu/to_all_of_you_who_still_dont_understand_what_ubb/c1e02ku):

&gt;You know what else? Skype, streaming radio, Facetime will be impacted as well. Open Source, cloud computing, steam, console/pc video games and even app stores (ever use your wifi to avoid the high price cell data use?). and just forget filling your house with smart appliances. UBB is going to put us behind the rest of the world in content delivery of all kinds.

excerpt from page 25 of report. 


""Minster of Finance’s refusal to allow two major bank mergers in late 1998. The proposed mergers were the subjects of intense public scrutiny for most of that year. The proceedings of the MacKay Task Force were shaken by the announcement on January 23, 1998 of the proposed merger of the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal, followed three months later by the TD - CIBC merger plan. These merger proposals were not and did not become part of the mandate of the task force. However, the task force recommended that mergers should not be rejected out of hand through the maintenance of a general policy of ‘big shall not buy big.’

The banks worked feverishly to present the mergers as both desirable and inevitable. They argued that the mergers were necessary for them to compete and inevitable given global trends of internationalization and consolidation. Yet, evidence that the banks needed to be bigger to compete internationally was not particularly convincing.""

I know wind mobile is trying to challenge this but I live in a small city that is not covered by wind mobile and probably never will be, we need a national change not just one tiny company that covers large cities. It is pretty bad when you can get a cell phone (plan) in a third world country for 10% of the cost we pay here. 

[Relevant, old but hasn't changed in the last 2 years](http://wirelessnorth.ca/2010/08/27/its-2010-and-canadians-pay-the-highest-cell-phone-bills-in-the-world/)

[Also somewhat relevant, this has changed but we are still more expensive than anywhere else in the world](http://www.thomaspurves.com/2007/04/09/canada-worse-than-3rd-world-countries-when-it-comes-to-mobile-data-access/)

***Edit: Damn, wasn't expecting this big of a response, a very mixed response as well. I want to clear up a few things.***

People seem to be very confused about a few poor excuses put out by the CRTC or phone companies to make excuses for our high costs that simply are not true.

The largest misconception seems to be that ""Canada is huge and it costs way more to cover such a large area""


***&lt;1&gt;***

I do not mean to steal credit for this there has been a ton of great comments that explain why this is bullshit I am just trying to put this right up at the top to clear this issue up and inform the public of a very common bullshit excuse for expensive costs. 

Did this using stats from the 2006 Census:

Population of Canada: 31,612,895

If people still want to argue after this I can break down the exact population density of every province but I am lazy and going to use the stats available for all of Canada and a few of the super under populated provinces. 

Canada = 9,252,161km^2 large with ONLY 3.73% population density that is 35515.61km^2 a MUCH smaller land mass that requires cell coverage, I could break this down even further to get this point across but Nunavut alone is 1,936,113km^2 large that is almost 21% of our landmass alone and guess what only 32,435 people live there, a lot of which are government or army employees which use a completely different communications system. I can't say for sure because I've never been there but I am willing to bet MAYBE 1% of that land mass if at all has PUBLIC cell coverage. 

There is still the north west territories which is almost as large and under populated so another 20% (rough estimate getting sick of math) of area that maybe 1-2% of has cell coverage. 

So right there is about 40% of our land mass that only has/requires 1-3% cell coverage, so with hardly breaking down anything at all already there is 37-39% of our Country that doesn't have or require cell coverage, this can be broken down to a much higher percentage accounting for all the other uninhabited land. 

So while yes Canada is a HUGE land mass, a huge percentage of that land mass is uninhabited, uninhabitable and has NO cell coverage, using our size as an excuse for expensive service is just nonsense. 

***&lt;2&gt;*** 

Wind mobile has some awesome plans BUT they are not available everywhere nor do I think they plan to ever be available everywhere, if you are unfortunate like me and live in a small city it is going to be years if ever before they are available in your area unless we do something to speed it up. And even wind does not offer true unlimited data packages, they throttle at 5gb (this was made clear to me by a comment posted by imgram). And the big telecoms are already doing and planning things that if not stopped by us will put companies like wind mobile out of business (please see website at bottom for more details about this and how you can stop it). 


***&lt;3&gt;***

Some of the retarded excuses I've heard people make on part of the telecommunications companies for price gouging us seriously have made the schizo in me think there are PR people from those companies making up bullshit in this thread and I don't think I even have to point out which ones those are and why they are wrong. 


***&lt;4&gt;***

I don't mean to sound arrogant or seem like I am not listening to both sides of the story by posting this edit, I do value the input by everyone from both sides of the argument and have actually even read / learned a few things that explain a little bit but not to the extent of what we are getting price gouged (pythonpoole had a good point about not being able to compare fully to other continents, although still doesn't explain why we pay so much more then USA).

If you do the research into any excuse given by the CRTC or the big telecom giants for why we are paying so much you fill find holes in all their bullshit excuses, it is impossible to deny we are being price gouged and we NEED to do something about this! 

Sorry if I missed a comment on how we can do this but so far the only thing I've seen suggested was by kidl33t and while I think his idea would give me some self satisfaction knowing we are costing the companies money it does not address the actual issue and will probably just raise prices or force them to stop offering free call hours. 

Please if anyone has any actual ideas on how we can try to fight this send me a message for my skype or other contact information so we can organize and finally take a stand! 

I know openmedia has been questioning the CRTC but I see no easy way to get involved with them and address the pricing issues head on. 

[They do have this going on right now, which is trying to prevent us from paying even more big telecom are pretty much illegally trying to force companies like wind mobile out of business!, so please use the form to send a letter to parliament.](http://stopthesqueeze.ca/) 


One more quick edit

Since this got such a good response and a lot more people will be reading this tomorrow, I want to throw this up here to warn people CHECK your phone bill EVERY month, I have been hearing about more and more people who are being over billed or charged for things they should not be, I have no idea how this is legal but I assume this goes unnoticed by a lot of people, if you call about it and complain they will obviously fix the ""error"" but I wonder how many people don't notice and how much extra money they make from these ""errors""...
  

***Another edit I feel I should put here that is a very important point brought up by a few people in comments (I apologize this is turning into one hell of a long post, got a much better response then I expected just wish more people would step up and help make some changes)***

Part of the telecommunications act has been brought up by a few people this is very basically what it does (one evil part of it anyways, it is not all bad has some other very important and non-evil things) :

""The Telecommunications Act limits foreign ownership to 20% of a company's voting shares, while restrictions on direct and indirect control are set at 46.7%."" [Wind mobile actually had a law suit launched against it because of a 500 million dollar investment from Egypt](http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3002088) 

It is VERY expensive for the initial start up costs to put the infrastructure in place required to provide cell service, this makes it very difficult as there are few Canadian companies that have the money to do this.

The telecommunications act combined with the ban hammer the CRTC has over everything are a HUGE part of why we are paying so much. 

And because of this a lot of the ""alternative"" cell phone companies have no option but to lease usage of the infrastructure already put into place by the 3 big telecom giants in Canada (Bell, Rogers and Telus). 
This limits their ability to set prices at exactly what they want or offer services not offered by those companies. 

I think it is a great idea to have Canadian companies do things in Canada **in theory**, in reality protection laws like this limit competition and give companies the power they all abuse to charge us what they want because we have no other option but to pay or not get service.

I have been avoiding the topic of wired broadband / internet prices but it also suffers from the same flaws because the same laws apply to these services as well.

It was quite funny. The weather was pretty overcast in Alaska the entire time from Anchorage to Ketchikan, not to mention everyone in the towns we visited were really rude for the most part. Our fellow travellers were mostly American and equally unpleasant to be around. 

We then went to Prince Rupert. It was as if we reached the promised land. The sun finally came out, the weather was beautiful and warm, and everyone on shore were so incredibly accommodating and friendly.

And Vancouver - beautiful city full of culture. I was so comfortable and happy travelling to the airport straight from the dock. I wish I could have spent some time looking around.

And then there was Victoria in Vancouver Island and I just fell in love. I love it so much here, in fact, that I am strongly considering doing a year at Victoria University just so I can stay here for an extended visit. I'm sad I am only here for 2 days.

I love Canada. I love Canadians. You guys rock. Keep it up!

Cornyfleur	1181	331	367	"I want to thank you all, New Democrats, Liberals, Bloc, and Greens, for not letting the Conservatives assume they have the right to walk across Canadians without input from anyone outside their ideological sphere.  To imagine any legislation that is not open by the Prime Minister to amendment, correction, or debate is ludicrous.  The image of every Conservative voting as quickly as they can so as to give the appearance of being closed to anything that would speak truth to their power, was striking.

The devil, annoyed, storms away and goes to Hell's boiler room, where he turns up the temperature. He goes back to the Canadians' room, along the way being begged by all sorts of people to put the heating back down. He enters the room to see the Canadians having a barbecue. Furiously, he asks them what they're doing.

""Well, we can't pass up this wonderful weather without getting out the barbecue!""

The devil realizes he's been doing the wrong thing. He goes to the boiler room and turns it down until it's at a colder temperature than ever seen on earth. He knows he's won now, so he goes back to the Canadians' room, only to see them jumping up and down in excitement. He shouts at them in fury, ""WHY ARE YOU STILL HAPPY?!?!?!""

For years the Canadian telecom companies have been running away with record profits on the back of questionable and sometimes downright predatory practices. The rates have been going up, and the service levels have not.

A few particularly egregious examples:

(1) Does anyone else remember when cell phone companies used to send out a text message to warn you when you were near or over your data cap? Well apparently not any more. A couple of recent surprise bills are what put me over edge with Rogers. The same exact thing just happened to my wife on Bell. There is no other way to describe this than predatory.

(2) Data caps for high-speed internet are still pitifully low in Canada. Why do we still get the same service level that they were selling in 2003? Price goes up and you get the same thing. We are falling behind the rest of the world on this one.

(3) All of these companies have one price that they advertise, and then another that you pay, and a third that you can get if you call and complain.

(4) 3 year contracts... WHY?

(5) Not sure if this is the case for anyone else but when I signed up I got an amazing deal, but they attached all of these discounts that needed to be renewed every year. So even within my contract time I would have to call in and complain to get my discounts reinstated. A blatant attempt to leverage laziness of the customer. 

(6) How does Bell justify charging $30+ per month for home phone in 2013? Check out Fongo, and see how cheap it actually is to move voice around the country in this day and age. 

These are just a few of the nightmarish examples of being a customer of a big telecom company in Canada. But it doesn't have to be this way, we can do something about it. 

**These are symptoms of a system without any real competition or oversight.**

So what can we do to really hurt these giants? All we need to do is put a small dent in their bottom line and they will listen up!

Recently, I switched to one of the new alternate carriers (Wind). The downside of these companies is that they only offer service inside of Canada's major cities. Luckily I fall within the service area for Wind, but given that they cover so many of the major Canadian metropolitan areas now, I bet they cover your area too.

In my experience the service has been impeccable. And while some might worry about how much they might spend when they travel outside of the home coverage areas, they will only draw on what funds you have put on your account to cover these extra charges. So far I have spent only a couple of dollars on extra charges, but even if I spent $20 extra every month it would still be way less then I paid with Rogers. More importantly, I don't feel like I am dealing with a company trying to screw me every chance they get. 

**The service is good, but in the end the main reason you should switch is because Fuck Telus, Fuck Rogers, and Fuck Bell (and if my experience with these companies is at all typical, you probably agree with me)**

**EDIT:** A lot of people are commenting on the fact that people in small towns have only 1 option for these services. You have just as much to gain if the big telecom companies start to see real competition from new upstarts. You should be telling anyone you know who does have alternatives to take advantage of them!

Also turdovski gave a link to [this company](http://mobility.petro-canada.ca/default.aspx) that has ultra-cheap prices but still runs on the national Rogers network. 

**EDIT2:** Added (4) and (5). Also some people have suggested that missed text warnings are an error and you just need to call an complain. Did that recently with Bell and they gave a small concession and forced my wife into a more expensive plan with no more MY10. This was the last straw that forced me to make this rant.

1311681953.0	j0348	Good Luck Mr. Layton	PhedreRachelle	1196	410	54	"""My fellow New Democrat,

I wanted to share this with you first.

On February 5th, 2010 I shared with Canadians that I, like 25,000 other Canadian men every year, had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 

I have received overwhelming support from my loving family, my friends, my caucus and party, and thousands of everyday Canadians. 
Their stories and support have touched me. And I have drawn strength and inspiration from them. 

In the closing days of the most recent session of the House of Commons, I suffered from some stiffness and pain. 
After the House rose, I undertook a series of tests at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. 

My battle against prostate cancer is going very well. My PSA levels remain virtually undetectable. 

However, these tests, whose results I received last week, also indicate that I have a new, non-prostate cancer that will require further treatment. 

So, on the advice of my doctors, I am going to focus on treatment and recovery. 

I will therefore be taking a temporary leave of absence as Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada. I'm going to fight this cancer now, so I can be back to fight for families when Parliament resumes. 
To that end, I have requested that the President of our party, Brian Topp, consult our Parliamentary caucus and then convene a meeting of our party's federal council to appoint an interim leader. 
The interim leader will serve until I resume my duties. 
I intend to do so when Parliament meets on September 19th. 
I am also making a recommendation on who the interim leader should be. 

I suggest that Hull-Aylmer MP Nycole Turmel be named interim leader during this period. 

Ms. Turmel enjoys unanimous support as the national chair of our Parliamentary caucus. She is an experienced national leader in both official languages. And she will do an excellent job as our national interim leader. 

Let me conclude by saying this. 

If I have tried to bring anything to federal politics, it is the idea that hope and optimism should be at their heart. 

We CAN look after each other better than we do today. We CAN have a fiscally responsible government. We CAN have a strong economy; greater equality; a clean environment. 

We CAN be a force for peace in the world. 

I am as hopeful and optimistic about all of this as I was the day I began my political work, many years ago. 

I am hopeful and optimistic about the personal battle that lies before me in the weeks to come. 

And I am very hopeful and optimistic that our party will continue to move forward. 

We WILL replace the Conservative government, a few short years from now. 

And we WILL work with Canadians to build the country of our hopes

Of our dreams

Of our optimism

Of our determination

Of our values...

Of our love. 

Thank you. 

Jack Layton""

It is the only real mechanism to enforce fair wages and working conditions.  Yet in recenet years, every time there is a major labour dispute it is immediately ended with back-to-work legislation.  In BC the government decided to legislate teachers back to work because they weren't marking report cards.  This is getting ridiculous.

To make matters worse, every time workers are legislated back the government comes down on the employers' side.  They impose a contract worse than what was on the table. to punish workers for striking to begin with.

We have lost our right to strike.  People fought for this right, they bled for this right, they even died for this right, and now it is gone.  What are we going to do about it?

Edit:  OK, OK, I get it.  We haven't technically lost the right to strike.  However if you can only strike when it is politically convenient, or when it doesn't affect the public, or when it won't have an economic impact - you don't really have the right to strike at all do you.

"	freedomcanada	1187	451	329	"For the longest time, Canada has been perceived as an impartial mediator, a peacemaker between countries. That has all but been undone now, which is why we lost our seat on the U.N. Security Council. Officially, we have become subjugated to US/Israeli foreign policy, which ranges from crippling sanctions and supporting terrorist groups and assassinations inside Iran, to advocating for a full-scale military strike.

I have no doubt that should there be an attack on Iran, Canadian military forces will be involved some way, whether in a support role, if not actually involved in the attack itself. Allow me to explain why this would be a stupid idea.

Indeed, Iran's human rights record is spotty. So is the United States'. Both countries have executed people that were later found to be innocent. You can argue about the scale, but do not think for a moment that the US and Israel will attack Iran out of their concern for 'human rights'. Furthermore, bombing Iran would pave the way for a military coup which would further worsen the human rights situation for Iranians. So surely, that can't be the reason.

Iran supports armed groups outside its borders. So does the United States. So do any number of countries. This is nothing new, and yes while some groups may be listed as 'terrorists' by governments that have no idea how to even pronounce their names, it is a meaningless gesture. One man's 'terrorist' is always another man's freedom fighter, and internationally speaking, there is no consensus on whether groups like Hamas or Hezbollah are terrorist groups or political entities - it depends on your point of view.

Lastly, the Iranian nuclear program. If this excuse doesn't smell like bullshit to you after what happened in 2003 then your nose must be stuffy from the cold. Canada is more capable of building a nuclear weapon today than Iran is, yet nobody is asking for UN inspectors at Pickering. Don't give me the line that Canada is a democracy and Iran isn't - they have an elected parliament too. Quite honestly, if people are willing for fall for the same trick twice they deserve what they get - but I hope Canadians are more intelligent and skeptical than the United States was during the Bush years. 

So what is the real reason? Why is Iran such a target? One need look no further than beneath the soil that they're living on. 

Iran has the world's 2nd largest reserves of natural gas and 4th largest reserves of crude oil. It may sound cynical but I think we all know in the back of our minds that there are many regimes that get away with much, much worse - for example you can look up the African country of Djibouti, a staunch US ally.  

Now is a critical moment for us to all wake up and realize the true danger of what is happening. The ""War on Terror"" was planned. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, now Syria - all stepping stones to the ultimate prize - Iran. We are one false-flag event, one Gulf of Tonkin incident away from a shooting war with Iran, and coincidentally our biggest ally has carrier groups sitting in the Persian gulf awaiting orders. 

Iran is not a threat to global peace. They haven't attacked any country. I don't know if I can say the same for our southern neighbour. 

I truly hope Canada doesn't fall into the trap, but it seems we're stepping right into it this time. Only time will tell. 

Your thoughts?  

edit: I didn't expect this post to get so many upvotes, so I'd like to clarify some things:

1. I don't believe Canada would ever unilaterally attack Iran, or any country for that matter, but would be roped into supporting a US/Israeli strike *were it to happen*.

2. The top voted response says that a war with Iran is unlikely. I would caution against being complacent about this. You have Israel's right-wing PM repeatedly saying that a military option may be the only one, Obama claiming that ""all options are on the table"" while sending carriers to the gulf, and steadily-increasing sanctions all point to an escalation. 

3. A war doesn't mean an invasion - in fact I think the top military brass would agree with me that it's a terrible idea. Bombing Iran and destroying nuclear as well as oil, gas and transportation infrastructure would cripple their economy without having to set one foot on Iranian soil. 

Lastly I'd like to add that I was born and raised in Canada, and I have never seen it as in our interests to attack a foreign county, whether Afghanistan, Libya, Iran or anyone else - I truly believe that it makes us all worse off even if our heart is in the right place. That is just my opinion, and I welcome a thorough debate on the merits of Canada becoming a junior officer in the world police.

1375570354.0	1jnezh	"Telus ""Loyalty Department"" told me it was in my best interest to pay an extra $30/month for the same amount of data I have now."	Fauxtella	908	178	629	"I went to Telus today to buy out my old contract and pick up a new Note II on a 2 year contract. I'm so naive. I thought I could keep my current plan (the student 55- 1g data, 350 daytime minutes, evenings and weekends for $55). The rep informed me that my old plan was ""no longer valid"" if I wanted another contract. There is now a $70 minimum with ONE QUARTER of the data included in my old plan (250mb per month). In order to get the same amount of data as my old plan, I would have to pay an extra $30/month. I thought this was insane, and told him so.

When I left the store, I called the customer service line and the rep transferred me to the Loyalty Department. The rep at the Loyalty Department said (paraphrasing): ""We asked our customers if they would prefer to pay more up front for the phone, or if they would like to pay more per month, and they chose to pay more per month. Not many people can afford to pay $400 up front, but everyone can afford $70 a month.""  (I was really surprised to hear that ""everyone"" can afford $70/month for a smart phone).

I retorted that I had never been asked my preference and that I, in fact, could NOT afford to pay $70 per month for a quarter of the data. He told me the rate plans were made in ""the best interest"" of the customer and there was nothing else he could or would do for me. 

To me, selling someone a pocket computer on which they can only use 250mbs of data before starting to wrack up overage charges is pretty fucking unreasonable, especially when you want $70 a month for it.

I ended up cancelling my contract and signing up with Bell. My new plan with them is not great, but I'm getting 2g of data for $70 instead of 250mb!

I know this is a long, boring story, but I feel frustrated and impotent. I don't want to pay almost $100/month for a cell phone. It's not that I can't, but rather that I don't think I should have to. For my bill to increase by $30/month for the same amount of data seems totally iimnsane.

If anyone else is thinking of switching to Bell, do it by August 8th to get the 2gs of data. Otherwise, you only get 1. Good luck, fellow fleeced Canadians.

My name is William Kowalski, and I'm an author and member of the National Affairs Committee of PEN Canada.  PEN Canada is a nonpartisan organization of writers that works with others to defend freedom of expression as a basic human right, at home and abroad. PEN Canada promotes literature, fights censorship, helps free persecuted writers from prison, and assists writers living in exile in Canada.

We would like people in Canada to know about their right to take photographs in public--especially of police officers, since this has become a contentious issue of late.  [This is our latest article on the matter.](http://pencanada.ca/blog/public-photography-is-not-a-crime/)  We have had this information vetted by criminal and Charter lawyers and are confident that it is accurate.  Please share it widely.

Thank you.

**Edit 1**:  I'm being asked many questions about particular situations involving photography and the law, some hypothetical and some real, so I need to make it clear that I am not an expert on the law or on law enforcement.  My main purpose here is to inform you of your rights.   I'm not ignoring you, but I don't want to mistakenly give bad advice here, so it's better for me to say nothing.  Other redditors who know what they're talking about can offer their input.

**Edit 2**: We are working on making a downloadable sheet with a list of photographer's rights printed on it available on our website as soon as possible.  I'll announce it here when that happens.  We also hope to have a wallet- or pocket-sized card available very soon.

**Edit 3**:  [Here is a link to a wallet-sized card](http://pencanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Photography-Know-your-rights-card.pdf) you can print out as a .pdf.

1296486980.0	fcest	Just called the Competition Bureau re CRTC's UBB ruling... good news!	lingben	1201	488	213	"I called and spoke with someone to complain that the CRTC's ruling has removed the possibility of competition by imposing Bell's pricing structure on all Canadians, whether they like or not. I also stated the usual stuff: marginal cost of GB vs. what Bell is charging, effect on Canadian economy, Bell/Rogers' conflict of interest via online media vs. satellite/cable TV, etc.

I was glad to hear that they've been getting a lot of calls about this.

**So keep it up!** 

Please take a moment to call the Competition Bureau and file a complaint to reverse the CRTC's recent ruling.

I suggest people be polite and calm. The person on the other end is trying to write down your complaint. They are not the enemy, they are our potential ally. Keep it succinct and get to the point. Let them know this is an URGENT matter (will come into effect on March 1st 2011) and vital to all Canadians' interest.

Make sure to use these terms: ""Anti-Competitive"" and ""Conflict of Interests"". For example: 


**""it is a conflict of interest to allow our Cable TV provider who is also our ISP, to limit our access to their competition, ie: Netflix""**

or... 

**""It is anti-competitive to allow our ISP to use UBB as an excuse to limit our access to their online TV competitors, such as Netflix, by making them cost-prohibitive to use.""**

Doesn't matter who you vote for, but please get out and vote.    Our turnout numbers from our youth are very poor.  

The last election was 58%:

The lowest turnout at the polls are in the 18-30 group at around 36%.   That's honestly pathetic.   Get everyone you know to vote.   It's pathetic the amount of youth who show up to protest, but don't show up to vote.

Voting is your voice, and a right for every Canadian citizen.

Get off your duff and vote.   There's no excuse not to.  There's advanced polls, and your employer must give you four hours to get out to vote.

Its time to hit Bell in the one place they actually care about: their bottom line. If you are with Bell cancel your services and switch to an independent. When you cancel let the Bell representative know exactly why you are doing so and make sure s/he documents this reason. If you are already a customer of an independent provider try to get as many people as you know to switch over. This will put much needed revenue in the pockets of these smaller companies which they can use to develop their own infrastructure while at the same time sending a message to Bell that we will no longer stand idly while they rip us off.	t5_2qh68	True

It was written by Canadian-Cree Anthony Sowan and can be found here: http://www.facebook.com/tim.graham.1840/posts/10152413555635652 Since the post requires a Facebook account to view, I am copying pasting the entire piece here. As a Canadian, I think this is an complex issue and this piece provides a good starting point for discussion]: 

___________________________
I've been #IdleTooLong about this whole topic, and I feel like I need to express my point of view without disrupting innocent travelers on highways, and cargo carrying freight trains.

First, allow me to clarify that I am a Cree man with full status. I have family in positions of political power in this very province, and should declare that my opinions are my own. While everyone needles over the finite details of the current situation, I'd like to paint my thoughts for you with much broader strokes.

I'm so very proud of my culture. The way the plains Indians lived on this land was a fantastic example of community, art, respect for our environment, ingenuity, and spirituality. I'm proud of the native inspired tattoos that I sport permanently on my body. As a father, I'm teaching my son that same respect and understanding of where his blood derives from, in the hopes that his pride will outshine the prejudice he will inevitably experience growing up, or at some point in his life.

I'm also very proud to be Canadian. Our vast mosaic of cultures, languages, and beliefs make up this welcoming land of opportunity for all. Whether you like it or not, we all have the same citizenship, but some have a different view on the value of it.

I don't pretend to know all the ins and outs of the government bills, documentation, or policy that is driving the current protests, but I've intently watched news stories, read columns, and have regularly monitored the comments being made on facebook. Based on all of this, I feel the need to break my silence on this issue.

1 - It's embarrassing how the #IdleNoMore protest is being handled.
Blocking major traffic thoroughfares does nothing good to bring support and awareness to your cause, it creates immediate animosity towards you. Protesting freely in parks or in front of government buildings seems like a much more productive way to attract the attention of those you seek. The politicians. Not the regular welder-Joe who's just trying to get to work. Hold him up and cost him money? See how much support you'll get out of that guy...

Clarify what you are protesting for, or against. I've never seen such a passionate group of people go forward in protest in such disarray, and without clearly stating what it's all about. If it's generally about your need to be consulted, respected, justified for being mistreated, or the preservation of your culture, then let's be out with it and start a constructive discussion.

Understand that you do not need to be consulted for anything any more than the Canadian citizen next to you does. Your opinion on things doesn't count ""more"" than anyone else's.
Respect is earned, not given.

There's no question that the native people of yesterday were brutalized, hunted, tortured, and humiliated for decades. It's awful, and no one should ever have to suffer like that. The elders of the time signed those treaties to bring peace, and offer what they hoped would be a leg-up in a new world that they realized couldn't be held at bay. But those days are long over. It defies logic to have the current population pay for the tragedies committed by people that came so long before them.

The preservation of your culture is YOUR job, not anyone else's. For example, Polish, Irish, and Ukrainian societies thrive all over the country with very little or no support from government coffers. They celebrate traditional dance, language, and food all by simply passing it down from generation to generation. Native communities can do the very same thing (and generally do), but without financial support.

2 - ""This movement is about the whole environment, it's not just about the treaties....The bill that passed now un-protects the rivers, lakes, forests, land, etc, so we need this bill to further protect our children's futures. Thanks to Harper Govt, rigs and development will pollute the air, waters, etc...""

It's no secret that our Canadian economy is driven by the oil and gas industry. Yes, there have been some awful environmental blunders due to a plethora of different reasons. I heartily agree that we need to protect our natural areas that support wildlife, but I also know that there is aggressive legislation, and powerful government offices in place that already have that very same sentiment at heart. Millions of Canadians support green technology and research, as well as lobby for stronger federal policy. So if that's what this is all about, there's no need to blockade anything, as a majority of people would already agree with you.

3 - ""It is about the 480 page Bill that the government has passed without you knowing about it. It went through the house of commons and the senate in 2 wks. 480 pgs long...do you think that many people had time to read it? It says that under age criminals can be punished as adults. It makes more budget cuts. The librarians at schools are being budget cut. It is about A LOT more than Aboriginals, it's about everyone in Canada. The Aboriginals are the ones who started to realize the Bill was gonna to do irreversible damage!""

Back in the days of copying notes off a blackboard or projector in school, I'm certain I've WRITTEN 480 pages in two weeks, let alone read that many. In a political world where literacy at a high level is demanded, I'm willing to bet that most could plow through that many pages in a very short period of time. I suppose the content would be laden with bureaucratic jargon and would need time to fully interpret...but that's why you have a legal team.
Quite frankly, I agree with underage criminals being tried as adults, and I'm willing to bet that a landslide majority of Canadians will agree with me.

Budget cuts are a reality of our democratic world. I'm not sure if this means that librarians from schools are being removed, or the library itself, but the fact of the matter is, our schools rely on a healthy economy for funding. When money gets tight, things get sacrificed. I truly hope that the readily available knowledge in a library would be the last to go.

4 - ""It's not about the Aboriginals! That is what they are doing to distract you from what it really is about! It only affects the aboriginals- just like it will effect ALL of us!""
This is very confusing, but seems to sum up the general knowledge about what is going on. Who is ""they""? Are we going into conspiracy theory depths here? Do people not realize that we have an official opposition in place as a natural government watchdog to debate everything that in-power government is trying to enact? If there were truly earth shattering implications in the bill in question, the opposition would be whistle blowing and bleating into any available microphone available so fast it would make your head spin.

First and foremost, I'm a human being just like you. I believe in equality. Across the board equality. Our country is so multicultural, that to give any specific group levity over everyone else is completely ridiculous. I'm not familiar with the particulars of old treaties signed, but I get the gist because I have used some of the special privileges provided to me. I do not pay for health care. I did for awhile in my young working life, but then the government discovered my native status and sent me a HUGE apology letter, and a cheque for every dime I had put into the system. Odd. I lived just up the street from my fellow truck driving friends, did the same job, paid the same taxes...yet there I was with this benefit because of my racial background and some papers that were signed all those years ago. I've used it for eye wear. This was particularly handy when I was “up against it” financially, but had broken my glasses welding. Here's the thing though, why should I have an advantage on a co-worker who might be in the same situation? It's not fair, and it needs to stop.

I move that Canadians start their own march towards coast to coast equality, or at least the serious discussion of it. Our country should offer no free rides to anyone. No help for those who refuse to help themselves. No quarter for those who would inhibit the lives and success of others. No limit to what anyone can accomplish with a steely resolve, and a great idea. It doesn't matter who built the first camp fires and communities on this land, it's those that work hard to continue to stoke the flames of collective well being that matter.

As a man that stands by his word, I pledge to never again use my native status to further myself in a way that isn't available to every other Canadian. I will leave my son unregistered, and will teach him the importance of keeping it that way. I am a proud native man, and a hard working, forward thinking Canadian that believes the opportunities and advantages this country has to offer should be available to everyone equally.

First, I'm happy to see you're all getting angry. This is good. Too long have I watched my fellow Canadian sit back and remain apathetic about the political dangers ahead that could undermine our freedoms or outright remove them.

We are dealing with... Complete corruption. This is absolutely draconian, this Usage Based Billing. Last I checked, there was a record on how we're among the worst internet carriers on the planet - worse than most emerging economies, actually! Here's one case study http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BT03M20101230

This shit has got to go. But as far as I'm concerned, all this complaining and petition signing, while it's good for rallying... Will not get anything done.

The CRTC is essentially in the back pocket of the two telecom conglomerates of our country, Rogers and Bell. They have abused us in too many ways to count. What makes you think our screaming now won't be tuned out either? That's the way I see it.

Therefore, the only way we can truly bite back is to attack these companies where it hurts most - their stock price. It's not enough to boycott them.

We could always log onto our brokers en masse and naked short their stock until it goes to 0, but that's not only risky, but requires an unbelievably concentrated effort by the public. An impossibility at this point I believe. Namely because I don't think you're all angry enough (prove me wrong.) Perhaps when there's a catalyst, such as a market crash.

However, what about just reaming them again and again with lawsuit after lawsuit until their wallets pucker?

We can either go the class action lawsuit route, or as someone else suggest here in the comment section, nail them with small claim after small claim after small claim until their stock price dwindles.

I just wanted to know if this is viable... Or if you're all angry enough to participate in such an endeavor. 

I know I do.

Vive la Revolution.

""the act of reproducing all or any substantial part of [...music...] onto an audio recording medium for the private use of the person who makes the copy does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the musical work, the performer’s performance or the sound recording.""

Further, on December 12, 2003, [The Copyright Board of Canada further clarified](http://news.cnet.com/Canada-deems-P2P-downloading-legal/2100-1025_3-5121479.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb) that P2P filesharing is a legitimate source of music for copying.

Stories [like this](http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/politics/story.html?id=3074841) where Industry Ministers think format-shifting music is illegal are either examples of gross incompetence or obvious propaganda for the music industry.

Do not let them convince the public that music copying in Canada is illegal.  It is NOT.  Point this out wherever and whenever you can.  I have provided the top link to back you up.

**edit**: The Conservatives are about to introduce proposed legislation, which is speculated will **remove** your existing rights under Canadian Copyright law.  The media will be pushing stories about how it will allow you to copy music for personal use under certain restrictive conditions, which is actually *removing* your current rights under law.

Do not ignore the media. Call bullshit. Post clarifying comments on their websites. Call the reporters who wrote the articles. Write letters to the editor. Call your MPs and set them straight. Do anything but ignore the grape kool-aid they want you to drink.

**edit 2**: Here is the Copyright Board clarification from December 12, 2003 with regards to the internet being a legitimate source: [pdf link](http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/decisions/2003/20031212-c-b.pdf), look at page 23, second last paragraph.  (And for my Quebecois friends, the french version is on the right side!)

I concur with the Canadian Bar Association's [views](http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/1086785--10-reasons-to-oppose-bill-c-10). 
&gt; 
&gt;As you are well aware, the Conservative government has been trying to push much of this legislation through both the House of Commons and the Senate for several years now.  Senators have made many thoughtful amendments in the past. The government rejected all of them.
&gt; 
&gt;Recently, when confronted with the latest crime statistics which continue to show a steady decline, Justice Minister Nicholson [replied](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/though-canadians-feel-safe-conservatives-move-ahead-on-crime-bill/article2257568/) ""We don’t govern on the basis of statistics.” I  am therefore, not optimistic that the government will see reason to modify its position this time round either. 
&gt; 
&gt;Traditionally, senators acted somewhat independently of the government to give Canadians the benefit of our traditional sober second thought (click [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/though-canadians-feel-safe-conservatives-move-ahead-on-crime-bill/article2257568/) for examples). That is no longer happening with Conservative senators who vote the way Mr. Harper tells them. Now that they have a majority in the Senate, I anticipate the Conservatives will pass Bill C-10.
&gt; 
&gt;Nevertheless, it is important for Canadians like yourself to continue to speak out.  We must be diligent in reminding one another that our nation fundamentally values compassion over coersion, ideals over ideology and rehabilitation over punishment.  Thank you for taking the time to do just that.  Please don't stop.
&gt;
&gt;Best regards, Elaine McCoy
&gt;
&gt;Alberta Senator
 
There are still small 'c' conservatives out there.

**http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/201979--missing-teen-michelle-yu-located-in-b-c**

**FindMichelleYu's Status:**
    Thank-you for joining us this past week in prayer and in action. This has been a difficult time for the Yu family and they have been overwhelmed by all the support and love they have received.

We are ecstatic to let you know that contact has been made with Michelle. She is safe. The family requests that you respect their privacy at this time.

Thank you again for all your help.

***
On Tuesday April 17th, [Michelle Yu](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/537960_399529360068399_398192830202052_1378154_836722935_n.jpg), a grade 12 Toronto student went missing. She was last seen in person at 2:30pm at York Mills Station and on camera at 6pm in downtown Toronto. She was on her way to meeting a friend and attending a girl guides meeting at 3pm before communication was promptly cut off.

None of her family or friends have heard from her since. Here are the important details:

1. It is uncharacteristic of her to run away. Her family and close friends do not believe this is likely. There were no major conflicts or disagreements in the family - and close friends have attested to this.

2. At 6pm on Tuesday, a camera captured her image at a bank at Bay and Queen St (downtown Toronto), where she had withdrawn money. This was not her usual bank and was out of the way of her planned route.

3. Her phone has been off since 3pm on Tuesday the 17th.

4. She has a heart condition that requires daily medication, which she is currently without because it is at home.

  Considering the circumstances (especially her heart condition), this is a VERY URGENT situation. At the moment, **police are NOT organizing ground searches**, and there are only a few minutes of local news coverage every night about this. This is why we NEED the internet to help spread her image, so that citizens can fill the void and effectively be this constant search party. It has been 4 days, and she could be anywhere in Canada by now if she has been abducted, so we have to inform people in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Hamilton, Halifax, London, EVERYWHERE, in order to stand a chance. These first few days are crucial and may very well be the difference in a life or death situation.

***What can you do?***

**1. Upvote this, then go on Facebook and ""share"" this page:**

**https://www.facebook.com/FindMichelleYu**

(Press the gear icon on the top right, and it will present to you a menu option to ""Share"" to your timeline)  

Though liking the page will give you updates on the situation, the most important thing you can do to help is **""sharing"" the page on your facebook timeline.** This will spread her image to **new social networks**. Currently, her image is being passed through networks of mutual friends and mutual-mutual friends. However, we need **strangers** - people that are not closely connected to Michelle's friends' networks - to **really spread awareness and have the ""virality"" take off.** **This is why reddit may actually be *the* most important resource right now.** If you have not seen this story in your fb newsfeed recently, you actually have the greatest ability to help her. More degrees of separation = More unique people and more exposure, the better chance we have of finding Michelle.


Please upvote and ""share"" the linked facebook page. Also **consider copy and pasting this message** when publishing the ""Share” to directly provide some context. Thank you for your help.

I'll hit the pillow now and sleep the Canadian way for the first time!

**Edit 1:** Thanks all for the gracious replies. It's a bit overwhelming going through every post. I'm at work now, I'll try to answer some questions later... Canadian morning breeze smells differently today, I have to say :D

**Edit 2:** Here are my answers to some common questions asked. Sorry for the in-lines, it's faster and the answers would be more exposed.

&gt; **What was your former country?**

I should have known this would be mostly asked and should've mentioned it before. I am Lebanese, born and lived my first 8 years in Kuwait, and moved in to Canada at 22. A bit of a weird mix I guess.

&gt; **Can you vote right away? Will you vote? Who will you vote for?**

I can, I will, and I'm voting NDP. Liberals are a close second. Basically, I'm voting ABH - anything but Harper.

&gt; **How long after the exam is the ceremony? Do you get the citizenship as soon as you go the ceremony?**

I had the ceremony two months after the exam. And yes, I got the citizenship certificate the day of the ceremony.

&gt; **Did you steal our jobs?**

Yes, sorry, I have one stolen right now. Hopefully, I'll make some jobs back once I have my own business. :D

&gt; **would you care to share your story to the citizenry so one can get a good idea of what to deal with?**

I came here first with a student visa to pursue my master's degree in computer science. I was not sure at first if I'd settle for good in Canada. But then made up my mind and  started learning French to obtain my permanent residency status. The permanent residency application was the toughest if you ask me, and expectedly so, as it makes an assessment on whether your education, skills, and work experience qualifies you for living in Canada. I got accepted and three years later, I would apply for citizenship. Flash forward 18 more months, and I'm a Canadian citizen, after passing a citizenship test two months ago.

Why did I decided to live in Canada? I landed first in Montreal and there is some charm in city that makes it feels like home only few months after living in. I loved the city, it's people and the wonderful land, nature, and culture (or multi-cultures) I've seen so far in Canada. I wouldn't say that settling in first was a breeze. It was not. But looking back where I was and where I am now and what plans I have for my future, I do realize I'm a different man now than before. Different as in better...


**Thanks everyone for the upvotes, upboats, and uplifting comments. You really made it even a better day by showing your genuine Canadian politeness. I guess it's time to go out for some real-life celebration, eh?**

To quote loyalblood, who commented below:

Brash and rude are not synonomous of any part of what I would consider Canadian culture, least of which rural Canada.

I don't vote Green/NDP myself but I think the people who do have a right to be represented in parliament. I see why majority winners have no incentive to give a more proportional representation (and I'm saddened by the fact that no political party is willing to look past their own good and do the right thing) but a coalition government might be the right environment for such a reform to take root.

What do you guys and gals think?

While I only spent two days there I had a tremendous time and quickly grew to love the entire region. The people are kind to such a level that it was almost disorienting - even folks in the streets acknowledge your existence, will talk to you, and can quickly befriend you. The first night we had such a great experience walking around the city in the wee hours with a Canadian, smoking and discussing our countries. We really leveled with each other over the misrepresentation of Americans by the media and spent hours laughing and learning from each other.

Everywhere I went the people were friendly, even in convenience stores and taxis. The drivers are so courteous and laid back that I felt almost ridiculous for ever having experienced road rage in the US. Just being around calm drivers makes you calmer yourself. People take their time, don't seem to rush each other as much, and are willing to make compromises. Every now and then someone would drive slowly or hold up traffic a bit and most of the time I never heard the angry honking I am used to back home.

What surprised me most was how my view of the US changed - our laws seem draconic in comparison, our people live in social vacuums and only recognize one another when we have to, we're focused on ourselves in the majority of cases, and we're much more unwilling to compromise for the good of others (even in shit as minor as letting someone merge into traffic). 

Going across the border into the US was like entering a prison - dozens of cameras watching your every movement, swathes of borderline paramilitary cops running up and down lines of cars shouting commands, and doing it all with a demeanor that was so distant and accusatory that it almost made me not want to go back. I seriously joked that they were going to issue us an orange jumpsuit at the booth. The first greeting to America when we got through was... a cop who set up a speed trap on a bend of the road. In Vancouver I saw multiple groups of people smoking weed on busy sidewalks and only saw one cop pull a car over for a traffic violation and heard some 18 year olds bitch that cops are harsh on underage drinking.

It seemed like every 30 minutes we would look at each other and ask 'Why the hell do we not live here?' Canada is so much more representative of my beliefs and genuinely made me want to be as nice and outgoing as natives of BC. I intend to visit other cities and provinces in the future to get a real sampling of the whole country, but from my short experience all I can say is that I would never turn down an offer to visit your country. The landscape of BC and the city of Vancouver are beautiful and will always hold a place in my heart as somewhere that true humanity and generosity shine brightly.

* Some of this goes back to simply being by the ocean again, but everywhere I've been has a great sense of mother nature and you can see the ""old"" Canadian wilderness.  I've went whale watching in the Bay of Fundy and see Humpback Whales.  I've been to the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.  Even driving to see friends and family I'm treated to great views. Lakes, rocks bursting out of the ground, hills filled with trees into the horizon.  

* I know it's still illegal, but *everyone* here seems to be comfortable with weed.  It's brought out every time someone is over.  You're always offered and if you don't smoke then it's just passed over without another thought.  Even around family members it's looked at no different then a cigarette.  The comfort level around the stuff was a huge surprise to me and not something I ever felt in the states. It aways felt shady to me until I moved here. 

*  The thing I love most is the patriotism.  I moved here from the states and just never really felt or believed patriotism there.  It's all ""We're #1"" just because we're America while all around me I saw anything but.  Bush ran the place for 8 years, we constantly fell behind in education, got deeper in debt, went to war, and just did worse and worse as a country.  Canada doesn't have that.  They don't say their number #1, and when they do it's because they earned it.  Take the Olympics.  They didn't go in their assuming they'd win at everything.  They knew they'd been lagging behind in previous ones and invested millions of dollars to train athletes and ""own the podium"" and were one of the most dominant countries at the Olympics.  Even being outside Canada at that point it was amazing to watch.

The odds of a random citizen on this Earth being Canadian is about half of one per cent. 

It's a long shot that delivers a hell of a jackpot. 

A citizenship, that for most of us, costs nothing to aquire, but yet is our most prized possession. 

Being Canadian means we have freedom of mobility. If you want to change your name to a symbol and move to British Columbia... You wouldent be the first, and you won't be the last. 

Being Canadian means we can worship whoever and however we want. 

Which is why when we meet a member of the world wide church of scientology [who worships an alien named xenu and beleive we evolved from a clam, and that they have alien ghosts living in their bodies], we shrug and say to each their own. 

Being Canadian means that if your finger comes into contact with a band saw, you pop it into a plastic bag along with some ice, and it gets sewn back on for free. 

Being Canadian means that in many places there is now a five-cent surcharge for shopping bags to encourage cloth bags. 

Don't use these for a severed finger though. In that case, pay the nickel and go with plastic. 

Being Canadian means we are each protected under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

In Canada, Harold can marry Samantha, Carol can marry Johann and Achmed can make an honest man out of Frank. 

Being Canadian means you can vote. 

And when we do, governments come and governments go - and yet not a single shot is fired. Which is appropriate because in our nation's capital, the Canadian flag flies proudly over a tower that we named Peace. "	t5_2qh68	True

As Canadians we are paying more for less. We endure poor internet price points and poor cell phone price points, the regulation of which is all derived from two main corporations (Rogers and Bell). We need more competition to spark more innovation and provide better price:service ratios.

War forced my family to flee. I was four years old when I arrived here. I remember that night very well, I remember Pearson Airport, the lights, the noise, it was a new world to me. I remember the apartment we lived in, I drive by that building occasionally now. It is much smaller than I remember. 

I have lived in the GTA since, Scarborough to be more precise. I have been all over the city, I have explored all of the Greater Toronto Area's vibrant communities. I have also done a bit of traveling and I have slowly learned more about the world we live in. 

I can't help but admire the values and character we try to uphold. Even though sometimes we should try a bit harder.

Of course we have our issues, it is quite a big list. We'll slowly get there by working together. Hopefully.

I am Canadian, and proud. Let's get back to what we used to do. It seems like everybody stopped caring and we did too.

Stay classy Canada.

(Details inside)	VinylCafe	626	135	66	"I am Stuart's son, and am participating in a charity event to raise money to send kids to summer camp. He has agreed let me exploit his position to help my charity fundraising efforts. Please see [this post for details](http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1f59z2/this_saturday_we_are_portaging_across_downtown/)

**EDIT:** Thank you to those who have donated (although I have to say most of the donations are from family and friends thus far.... *Guilt Trip*... but even the exposure is appreciated). I just achieved my goal of $1000. This is enough to send a kid to camp for summer so go team! You get your AMA! However, I would ask that we keep going... 

Here is the link for those who would like to go straight to the donation page:
http://my.e2rm.com/personalPage.aspx?SID=3741904&amp;LangPref=en-CA

**Edit #3:** He's agreed to Wednesday the 29th at 3pm EST. I will post it to r/IAmA  but will provide a link here as well. If you are interested by this, please donate... http://my.e2rm.com/personalPage.aspx?SID=3741904&amp;LangPref=en-CA. I believe allowing kids the privilege of experiencing life beyond the city is important, as are leadership skills, and the life-long community that camp provides. Again... thank you for your support.

**Edit #5: AMA live: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1faa32/hey_everyone_im_stuart_mclean_host_and_writer_of/**


**Reddit has so far donated a total: $329.99** (Thank you Craig, Joey, Kevin, Anna!, Nicholas, Robert, Kookyguy, Adrian, Alistair, Oliver, Greg, Pete, &amp; Michael!). While I am thrilled that you are excited by the AMA (Which will happen regardless) I would ask that you honour the spirit of this by giving a couple of dollars (tax receipts are emailed back). It is uncomfortable to ask so bluntly but I am passionate about this organization and would feel I am doing it a disservice in not trying.

1288827220.0	e0w1e	Hey Canada, I just wanted to say, I love you?	hakuna_matata77	726	233	638	"Hey canada.  I am an American.  this summer I was driving cross country and got to Seattle and was like, fuck it, Canada is just a few hours away... I've never been there... I'm gonna gun it and check it out for the night.  I got there about 3 am, not knowing anything.  Crossed in through BC and went up to Vancouver and slept in my car for the night.

OK well when the sun came up the next morning and Canada awoke, I also awoke to this fucking amazing country.  I don't know how I fell in love with it so fast.  I had a plane to catch in Seattle that day but I didn't want to leave.  I just hit the highway and drove for about an hour down trans Canada 1 to a little town called HOpe.  I listened to the news and felt peacefullness.  It was crazy to hear the radio saying something like : ""this is fun 101!  For chilliwak!""  holy shit I never felt so happy, just seeing the mountains.

Well I had to jet.  I went back home, which is very close to Mexico.  But I couldn't stop thinking of Canada.  It was just special. My summer travels were supposed to be over, but I had found this amazing place and I wanted to share it. I called my mom and said... mom listen... you've never been to Canada... I know you'll love it, we're fucking going!  About a month later we hoped in the car and drove up into Quebec, which took us about 3 days to get there.  I fucking loved Quebec.  I listened to French songs and walked around Quebec city and felt like this was a place I wanted to be.  I caught a cirque de sole show and couldn't believe the enthusiasm those guys had for the city and the enthusiasm the crowd had for them. I drove on throuhg Quebec, into New Brunswick, Nova Scotia.  I rode a horse in Nova Scotia, this little tiny town.  I galloped, for the first time!  It was amazing!  I got a coin with a tiny little red maple leaf in the middle and thought it was so cool and kept freaking out making sure I hadn't lost it.  In Nove Scotia I came across a guy in a tiny little town dressed in raggy clothes who owned this almost dilapitated gas station who was telling us about the Shriners and how everyone should donate to them.  On the end of the Cabot Trail I found a place called Joe's Scarecrow Village in which somebody had gone ot the trouble to erect scarecrows on a plot outside a trailer, give them all clothes, nametags, and life histories.  Can I just say, wow?

I didn't want to leave Canada.  I loved every minute.  I don't even know what it was I loved so much.  

So i came back home.  And now I miss it.  Next summer I want to go back.  I have plans to drive up to Alaska and just enjoy my time in B.C.  That place just had a beauty of its own.  I would love to see whats in the middle, I guess Alberta and Manitoba?  I hear its beautiful close to the border there at the International Peace Park.  I loved the people up in Canada, yes I met a few dicks, as you would anywhere, but generally I found Canadians relaxed and understanding.  People didn't tend to yell, or get edgy, instead just spoke in a calm voice, and were very helpful.  One guy gave me his parking pass out of the blue because I didn't have any money.   I loved listening to the radio.  There was a radio drama playing all through New Brunswick about some soldiers, ""Afghanida"" or something.  A radio drama.  Really?  Fuck!  That is cool!

I just wanted to say I guess, I know Americans can sometimes be dicks and make fun of Canada, but I aplogize on their behalf.  I really really love your country a lot.  It's a beautiful, relaxing, and nice place to be.  In the states, people often act like I don't belong here because I'm a Muslim girl, even thouhg I'm born and raised here.  In Canada I felt more accepted and I had only been there a few weeks.  Do I think it's perfect, nah, no place is!  It's just... you guys, and your country, is special, and I just wanted to say that."	t5_2qh68	True
