EDIT 1: 

r/AdventureTime and Reddit, this has been a fantastic experience. My kids can't figure out if this makes me the coolest dad or the most embarrassing, but now that I've been here, I'll be sure to check back soon.
Now comes the hype. Please subscribe to [Cartoon Hangover](http://youtube.com/cartoonhangover) on YouTube. We need as much help as we can get.
Thank you all for the great questions!

I figure if I can tell him about how many (as long as its a big number) people would be interested in having a Q&amp;A with him, via number of upvotes, I might be a bit more persuasive than just one person emailing him. If you clicked my link, you must want it too, so please upvote. Yes, there have been a few requests on [/r/IAmA](/r/IAmA), but it's a lost cause there, I figured here we would actually get a good representation of the number of interested people.

TL;DR upvote if you want an AMA with Pendleton, enough and we might get it

EDIT: I have now emailed him, letting him know of the 1,400+ upvotes in the first 24 hours and the 10,000+ subscribers as well as asking for his team to join in. I will make a new self-post if he decides to with the time/date, and then add a link to it on that day."	t5_2s54g	True

--------------

* up-vote, down-vote buttons

* search bar

* background image

* user flair

* lots of stuff in the sidebar

* header (which will be changed)

* and last of all (I think) is EMOTES ARE HERE...kinda.

I was a bit busy and didn't get to finalize the emotes. But don't worry! Everything will be up and running (along with updated flair) tomorrow.

\* as /u/AtTheMAGNETO pointed out, this sentence is more likely to end in ""diet"" than ""die"" considering the episode.  Additionally, there is a tiny mark that appears to the right of the ""e"", that is likely a ""t"" - it's too close to the ""e"" to likely be the start of a new word.

\*\* as [revealed](http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/17j0we/completeish_transcription_of_lemongrabs_brain/c86p73w) by the creator of this particular piece, /u/pirateclub, the section covered by the logo should read:

내가 왜 그랬을까. (Why did I do that!)


걔네들 찾았어요? (Did you find them?)


걔네들 안전할까요? (Will they be okay?)


제이크가 실종되기 전에 내가 월남국수 면이 질기다고 말했어요. 아, 내가 왜 그런 말을 했을까. 무슨 나쁜 일이 생겼으면 어떡해! 걔가 만든 국수 맛없다고 한 게 우리의 마지막 대화였어요. (I told him that your Vietnamese noodle is too tough before he gone missing. Why did I say such a thing! What if something wrong happens to him! It was the last conversation we had that his noodle is bad.)


미안해요. 내가 국수를 너무 많이 먹었나 봐요. (Sorry. Guess I've taken too much noodle.)


그놈이 칼을 들고 덤비면 어떡해요! (What if he attacks you with a knife!)


그놈이 공주님을 해치려고 하면요! (What if he tries to harm you!)


아.. 맞아요. 내가 걱정이 좀 심한 편이죠. 저는 반 살은 시체들이 우리집을 공격하는 악몽에 시달려요. 우리 삼촌, 외숙모, 사촌들이 다 집에 있었어요. 저 위층에서 우는 소리까지 생생히 들린다니까요! 우리 가족들을 지킬 수만 있다면.. 그 꿈꾸는 동안 얼마나 스트레스를 받으면 이빨까지 무지하게 갈아요! (이빨을 감) 다음날 일어나면 이빨들이 금 가 있어요! 보통 전 그냥 그런 것 꿈이려니, 내가 걱정을 사서 하지 않나 하면서 잊어버리려고 해요. 제가 그 반 살은 시체들에게 두 번이나 공격당했었잖아요. (That's right. I'm little bit too worrying sometimes. I always got haunted by the nightmare that half-dead corpses attacking my house! My uncle, aunt-in-law, cousins were all present, I even hear the crying coming from the upstairs. I just wished that I could protect my family.. I become too stressful during that dream, I even grind my own teeth! (Grinds teeth) When I wake up in the morning, all my teeth are cracked up! I usually try to forget about it, thinking that it's just a dream or I'm being paranoid, but I was actually attacked by these half-dead corpses before, twice!)




**In the dark room**



으으, 잘 안 보이네. (It's hard to see things)


뭐에요? (What was that?)


으! 아아! 그만해! 도와줘요! (Ahh! Stop it! Help!)




**after escaping from the hands**



공주님 무기들! (Your weapons!)


공주님 저 땀나게 만드시네요. (You're making me sweat.)




**In the eye-chamber**



와, 이 방은 예쁜 새 소리에 대한 내 사랑보다 더 크네! (Wow. This chamber is bigger than my love for pretty birds' song!)

으, 네. 걱정 마세요. 저 완전, 완전 괜찮아요. 자, 가요. 일어납시다!(넘어짐) 으, 안되겠네. 혼자 가세요. 전 짐만 될 뿐이에요. (Eh, Yeah, don't worry about me. I'm perfectly, perfectly fine. Let's go, get up!(Falls down) Ew. Not gonna make it. You should go alone, I'm just a burden for you.)



**Back at the castle**

제이크 깨어났어요? (Is Jake awake?)

괜찮아요. 비밀로 한 제가 잘못이죠. (It's fine. That was my bad for hiding it.)

자기야, 나 완전 중요한 할 말 있어. 나, I'm pregnant! (Honey, I've got something terribly important to tell you. I, I'm pregnant!)

**Edit 2 :**

The storyboard of this episode shows some differences with this quotes, like Vietnamese noodle was originally Vermicelli noodle.
I can assure you that my translations are correct in overall, but there could be errors cause this is technically double-translated. 
Here's a link for the original storyboard :
