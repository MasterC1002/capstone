1361466561.0	18yo6k	Hi! I'm an omnivore, but I recently started dating a girl who is vegan.  I love cooking and would like to be able to make appropriate food to share with her.  Can you fine folks recommend a good cookbook that I can start with that has a wide variety of recipes to choose from?

BUT unfortunately, I punched the recipe into my nutrition/meal planning software and it turns out that a serving (1/3 of the recipe) is a whopping 671 calories.  And since we halved the recipe, we each got 1006 calories for breakfast.  Oops...

1374171814.0	1ikpjb	My basic lentils and rice + stir fry recipe	Maklodes	33	7	5	"This recipe is honestly nothing special (it's a basic rice and lentils dish), but /u/ThereIsNoMountain recently did a post asking for simple recipes with good amounts of iron and protein, so I did a search on veganrecipes to see if something like this was already around, and didn't find anything. I figured that rather than just replying with a recipe, I might as well post it here.

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup rice (I prefer brown; white basmati, multi-grain, etc, also works)

* 1 cup of lentils (any lentils other than red lentils work)

* 1 teaspoon ground cumin

* 1/2 teaspoon salt

* juice from 1 lemon

* 2 tablespoons of olive oil

* 1 medium onion

* 2 cloves of garlic

* 1 bell pepper (colors other than green preferred: red, orange, or yellow)

* 1 potato (I prefer yukon gold or red; russet also works)

* 1 carrot

* 1 pack of Upton's Naturals seitan

**Instructions**

1. In saucepan, heat 4 cups of water to boil. Add rice, lentils, and salt.  Reduce heat to the point that the water is just barely boiling. The rice and lentils will cook for about 30-40 minutes, to taste: periodically check to see if the water has evaporated too much before the time is up. If so, add more, until about the last 5-10 minutes of cooking (you want the water to evaporate eventually).

2. While rice and lentils are boiling, chop up onion, bell pepper, potato, carrot, and garlic. Heat olive oil in large frying pan. Add potato, carrot, pepper, and onion. Stir-fry for about two minutes. Then add seitan and garlic. Cook until vegetables are lightly browned.

3. About five minutes before the rice and lentils and done cooking, add cumin and stir in.

4. Once rice and lentils are done and the water is mostly evaporated or absorbed, combine rice and lentils and stir fry in large bowl. Pour lemon juice over the dish, and mix together. Let stand covered for 10 minutes.

**Notes**

This dish is fairly flexible. The seitan isn't necesary if you have trouble finding it. Also, you might consider adding diced eggplant to the stir-fry component if you're leaving something else out.

If you haven't tried to make it yet, you really should!  Here is an even more simplified version I have just made:

Almost fills a 500g pb jar

1/2 c unsweetened soy milk

1 1/8 c canola oil

1 - 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar

1/2 - 3/4 tsp salt

Put everything in the blender and process until thick. In the Vitamix this takes about 10-15 seconds.

Note - don't sub in olive oil for canola - I did and the flavour is too strong.

EDIT - there is a lot of discussion here about needing an emulsifier.  I can only say, I did it without one.  No lecithin in my milk, no mustard or lecithin added to the recipe.  I don't know why it worked.  Maybe the Vitamix is so powerful, it can't help but emulsify.  I would be interested to hear if anyone else tries this recipe - nothing else added - and if it works for them."	t5_2s5ei	True

We call them magic cookies in this house because there's no egg, butter, processed sugar or flour.  All the non-vegans who try them are skeptical at first but of course they love them.  

**Chocolate Chip Cookies**

* 1 tbsp ground flax seed
*  4 pitted dates
*  1 1/2c. walnuts
*  1/2c. pecans
*  1 tsp baking soda
*  salt
*  2 tbsp coconut oil (melted)
*  1 tsp vanilla
* 1/4c. unsweetened shredded coconut
*  1/4c. vegan chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350F.  Mix 3tbsp water with your ground flax seed and set aside (this will be your ""egg"").  In a food processor, blend dates.  Add walnuts and pecans and process until crumbly.  Add baking soda and salt and pulse briefly.  Drizzle in melted coconut oil and vanilla, then add your flax seed which should be nice and gooey.  Transfer the whole mixture to a bowl and stir in coconut and chocolate chips.  Bake on parchment lined cookie sheet for about 13 minutes.  They need a few minutes to set after they come out of the oven, then enjoy!

Notes:  I've only ever made this with the flax seed as an egg replacer, but there are tons of other things you could try.  Let me know how it goes!  Also, I use carob chips (I find they have a bit of an earthy taste).  Feel free to experiment with that too though.  Vegan chocolate chips, cranberries, raisins...why not?  You could probably use different kinds of nuts too, I've replaced the pecans with almonds and it turned out just fine.  

Anyways, hope you love these as much as I do!"	t5_2s5ei	True

I know that classes can be overwhelming so I want to make a bunch of meals ahead of time that can be reheated on the stove top or oven (no microwave). So far I'm planning on a few soups, enchiladas, burritos and lasagna. Any other ideas for meals that are easy to make in bulk and freeze well or have a long shelf life would be really helpful.

1 box brown rice rotini

2 tbsp margarine

4 tbsp almond flour

1 cup rice milk

1 cup dairy free cheddar cheese (I used Daiya brand since I can't have soy either)

1 tbsp dijon mustard

Salt, pepper, and basil to taste


1. Bring pot of water to a boil and cook until desire texture is reached.
2. In another pot over medium heat, melt the margarine and then add the almond flour and stir.
3. Add the rice milk and bring to a simmer for a few minutes.
4. Add the ""cheese"" and stir until combined.
5. Pour drained cooked pasta into the sauce and stir.
6. Add the djion mustard, salt, pepper, and basil to taste
7. Om nom nom and rejoice.

I was pleasantly surprised with the results! Of course any of the ingredients could be substituted (almond milk, soy milk or regular milk for the rice milk, etc). Let me know if anyone tries it :)"	t5_2s5ei	True

Cookies:
In a food processor pulse flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, and baking soda to combine. (This can be done by hand too. It's just needs to be a very fine powder by the time it's done.) Add margarine, milk, vanilla, and mint. Pulse a few more times until the mixture comes together. Transfer to large bowl and knead with hands until it comes together and all the flour is incorporated. Chill the dough for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silpats. Remove dough from refrigerator. Roll a heaping tsp of cookie dough into a ball and place onto prepared sheets leaving about 3 inches between each ball. Evenly flatten the dough with your fingertips so that it is about 1/4 inch thick and bake for 12-14 minutes. Let cool completely. 


Chocolate Coating:
Melt chocolate chips and margarine in a double boiler or microwave. Stir in mint extract and mix until completely smooth. Dip completely cooled cookie into the chocolate and remove with a fork, gently scraping off excess chocolate using the side of the bowl. Place cookies on a parchment lined plate or tray and refrigerate until chocolate coating sets. Store in refrigerator until serving"	t5_2s5ei	True

http://imgur.com/A7JITFP

Wonton:
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
¼ cup Soymilk
½ cup water

Filling:
2 cups kale
½lb of Yves Veggie Ground
¼ of an onion finely chopped
4 tablespoons of Taco Seasoning
2 teaspoon Smart Balance Light with Flaxseed oil.
Oil: Vegetable 

Items you’ll need:
2 mixing bowls
1 small bowl
1 pan
1 sauce pan
Cutting board or baking sheet
Dough Roller (I used a cup to flatten the dough)
2 handtowels/kitchen cloths
1 medium cup	
Measuring utensils 


1.	In a bowl bring together flour, baking powder, salt, and mix well ( I cheated and used a blender which made the mixture fluffy) In another bowl combine soymilk and water. Pour the water soymilk combo slowly into the four mixture kneading as you go. Your dough should not me super wet/dry. If it is add flour/water til it’s easier to manage. Put aside dough bowl after kneading.  Place a cloth over it and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
2.	Prep your onion, cut it finely. Fill a saucepan halfway with water and put a dash of salt in. While you bring it the saucepan to a boil, take out your frying pan bringing it to medium heat. Place the onion, Yves veggie ground and heat up until onions have caramelized and become soft. Put in the taco seasoning and add ¼ cup of water, mix and coat evenly. By now your saucepan should be ready, add the kale and take out of water when wilted. 
3.	Kale prep: After finishing cooking (water is probably green) drain water. Bring out your second hand towel and put kale on it. Roll the kale like you make sushi, and wring out any excess water (takes out a majority of the bitterness), set aside.
4.	When the veggie ground taco mixture and the kale is cooling down. Take the dough and roll it onto a floured surface (cutting board or baking sheet). Start at the dough with a rolling pin, making sure you get the dough as flat and evenly as possible (don’t go too thin). Think circle when rolling. After you’re done, get your cup and use it as a guide, cut out 6 circle pieces. 
5.	Bring the kale and veggie ground taco mixture together and combine. On the cookie sheet distribute mixture evenly to each wonton circle. Fold in half and pinch close. Think pie edges when pinching them, so your mixture doesn’t fall out.
6.	When your finished take out another pan (or wash the one you used) and add a palm size amount of oil in pan. Swirl around and heat until oil is hot. 
7.	Take out your small bowl and add the butter to it, put in microwave and liquefy it. Dip wontons in butter and add to pan, pan fry until golden brown on each side and then serve! Makes 6 yummy Flower Boys!

-1 lb white potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes

-1 1/2 cups green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces

-12 oz fusilli (I just used spaghetti) 

-1/2 cup raw (unsalted) cashews

-2 garlic cloves, crushed

-1/4 cup water

-3 Tbs fresh lemon juice

-2 Tbs olive oil

-1 tsp finely grated lemon zest

-1 Tbs nutritional yeast (I didn't have any)

-1 tsp dried basil

-1/2 tsp onion powder

-1/2 tsp salt

-1 1/4 cups plain, unsweetened soy milk

-3 Tbs minced, fresh basil

Steam potatoes for 5 minutes and then add green beans and steam until potatoes are tender, about 8-10 more minutes. Set aside when done. In a large pot, boil fusilli for about 10 minutes or until al dente. While pasta is boiling, grind cashews to powder in blender, add garlic, water, lemon juice, oil, zest, yeast, dried basil, onion powder, salt, soy milk, and blend until smooth. Adjust seasonings as needed. If too thick, add water. Set aside. Drain pasta, return to pot, and add green beans and potatoes. Add sauce and fresh basil and combine. Serve hot!

I would have taken pictures but this pasta went fast!

Tomorrow (Tuesday) is my one-year as a vegan!  I went from eating a completely shit, cheesey, meaty, diet to an amazing vegan one!  I have absolutely reaped the benefits and I'm so proud of myself!

Anyways, tomorrow i'm planning on making a dinner for my friends and I.  None of my friends are even vegetarians but they have always LOVED my vegan cooking :D

I was wondering if you all could give me your FAVORITE recipes!  I'm thinking of doing an appetizer, main course, and a desert.  I want something new and tasty to try!  Maybe something with fall produce?  A pizza? (although i'm not really into cheeze) A cake? A dip?  Ahh!  Help me out ya'll!  Thanks in advance guys :)

Edit:  Also, i'm a pretty broke college student.  I have a decently stocked vegan kitchen but i don't want to have to go out and buy a TON of stuff.  A few things here and there won't hurt but nothing that calls for 7 different types of flour or anything."	t5_2s5ei	True

1 block of firm/extra-firm tofu

1/2 cup any Miso ( I used red )

Rice Vinegar

White Wine

  
I'm not entirely sure about the amounts, as I was just experimenting and didn't write anything down.

Basically, you just mash the tofu and miso together until they are pretty evenly mixed. Then add the vinegar and wine ( not too much! ) until the mixture is at a more spreadable ( but not liquid ) consistency. Mix it up and you're ready!

This cheese comes out with a sort of cheddar taste to it. It can be pretty strong on its own, but the flavor isn't as powerful when it's on other food. Try it with a light miso! Put it on pizza, crackers, on top of soups...

I plan to try marinating an entire block of pressed tofu with this stuff, to see if I can make a ""block"" of cheese.

Hope you are able to try this out .. Enjoy!

E_pubicus_unum	21	3	6	"I needed a last minute recipe for my co-op's dinner, and I made this even though they generally hate lentils and I didn't know how to describe it. It didn't look very appealing either, like just orange goo. Despite everything working against it, *everyone*, meat eaters included, loved it. 

Red Lentil Thai Chili

* Olive oil (1 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons, however much you feel like using)

* 1 large yellow onion, diced medium
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced medium
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 ½ lbs sweet potatoes cut into ¾ inch chunks
* 1 cup red lentils
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 15 oz cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
* 1 15 oz can lowfat coconut milk
* 28 oz can diced tomatoes
* ½ cup fresh cilantro, plus extra for garnish
* Limes for garnish (optional)

Preheat a 4-quart pot over medium heat. Saute onions and pepper in oil with a pinch of salt, for 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and saute a minute more.

Add chili powder, sweet potatoes, lentils, salt and vegetable broth. Cover and bring to a boil. Let it boil for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. When lentils are cooked and sweet potatoes are tender, add the remaining ingredients and heat through.

Taste for salt and seasoning, top with cilantro and lime and serve!"	t5_2s5ei	True

(I probably used about 3 tbsps of white-wine vinegar, a teaspoon or two of salt, and then about a teaspon of maple syrup, but really this isn't an exact science).  Let them sit in the vinegar stuff for an hour or so then drain and pat dry.  

Now throw the cucumber in a baking dish (*toss in oil and spice) and throw said baking dish in a 450 F oven for 30-45 minutes.  

Now your cucumber is delicious.  "	t5_2s5ei	True

I wanted to try a new recipe for supper tonight. So early this afternoon I made these burger buns. 

http://www.holycowvegan.net/2011/09/whole-wheat-burger-buns.html

Although they are time consuming, they are by no means difficult to make. Easy to freeze and use later. 

Then I made up a burger recipe with what I had available. The result was pretty spectacular. My wife and daughter who are very picky eaters both enjoyed the results! So I wanted to come here to share. I hope you enjoy. 

---------------------------------------------
Makes approximately 10 burgers. Can be cooked and frozen for later use. 

    2 tsp garlic powder
    1/2 tsp cumin
    1 tsp turmeric
    1 tsp sea salt
    1 tsp onion power 
    1 tsp smoked paprika
    
    8 dashes liquid smoke (optional) 
    1 12oz block silken tofu (extra firm) 
    2 C chickpeas
    1 C oats
    1 1/2 C rice flour
    
    1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (for frying)
    
Puree the chickpeas in food processor. Add the tofu and blend together. In a separate bowl mix together the spices. Add the spices and remaining ingredients to the food processor and blend until even. The mixture will be very moist. Add olive oil to frying pan and preheat pan on medium heat. My suggestion is to drop a **large** spoonful into your preheated pan. Once the bottom starts to brown, flip the burger and press down with a spatula to form the pattie. Cook on medium heat until golden brown.

I've tried several recipes from the internet, and the last one I tried was from The Happy Herbivore Abroad. Although a lot of the recipes in this book are delicious, that one was absolutely *disgusting*, and I wasn't able to form crêpes with the dough; they would just break off, stick, etc. 

Anyone know of a good recipe? Fat free is preferred but I think amazing crêpes are worth eating some fat now and then.

1333469984.0	rrcfe	Vegan Cooking Tips	lugubriousmoron	20	3	13	"I thought it would be fun to start a thread were we all share our general vegan cooking tips. Cooking as a vegan can mean making modifications to classic methods, but also I think cooking vegan means getting the most out of your ingredients, specifically fresh vegetables, herbs, and spices. There is a lot to go over, and my knowledge is sparse, so I'm really excited to see what everyone else has to offer. I'll lay down some thoughts and maybe we can start organizing things in to something more coherent to list on the sidebar!

**Vegan Cooking Utensils:**

* Quality Chef's Knife - Since you'll be chopping vegetables pretty much 24/7, having a nice sharp Chef's knife makes a world of difference. This pretty much goes for all cooking in general.

* Food processor / Blender - This opens up all the wonderful worlds of hummus, pesto, veggie burgers, dips, aioli, and countless other dishes you can only truly make well with the power of machines!

* Cast Iron Pan - You want to sear some tofu? Perfectly grill seitan? Make insane home fries? You pretty much need a cast iron pan! Proper care and maintenance is also important. 

* [Nut Milk Bag](http://www.amazon.com/Nut-Milk-Bag-New-Improved/dp/B00158U8DU) Essential for making almond milk and straining cashews and other types of delicious things.

**Know Your Vegetables**

I feel like when people make the lifestyle change to vegetarian/vegan they eschew the beauty of vegetables for the ease of tofu pups and daiya. Since we eat a plant-based diet we really need to be experts on what grows in the ground. I suggest loading up Youtube and watching as many episodes of Good Eats as possible to learn the exact science, history, and cooking methodology of many vegan friendly types of food. Here are some of my favorites.

**Replacing Eggs:**

We have a few options here and it depends on what you're doing.

* **Ground Flax Seed** (1 TBS + 2 TBS water = 1 egg) - This has an amazing eggy consistency that produces a lot of volume but also a nutty flavor. This is great when making cookies, waffles, and even cornbread, but be aware that it does add a nutty flavor which may not always be desirable. Also Omega 3's are awesome and flax has a buttload.

* **[Egg Replacer](http://www.ener-g.com/gluten-free/egg-substitute.html)** - Great for not leaving any noticeable taste but doesn't have as much volume as the flax. Follow the instructions on the box and use a whisk to get better volume. Try not to make too watery.

* **Apple Sauce** (1/4 cup applesauce PLUS 1/2 teaspoon Baking Powder = 1 egg) - A healthy alternative that can be used in recipes requiring a sweet touch. The volume isn't as good as the flax, but it adds a unique apple flavor.

* **Tofu** - This is perfect for making tofu scramble, frittatas, and quiche. Add a little (just a little!) turmeric, mustard, or nutritional yeast for coloring and flavor. Also smoked salt makes for an amazing eggy taste that tofu absorbs quite well.

**Replacing Milk**

There are so many different kinds of milk substitutes out there, it can be staggering! 

* **Soy Milk** - To me this is the thickest and best used if you need a lot of texture in baking or making a sauce. When cooking savory make sure to get unsweetened. I try not using soy milk because there is already so much soy in everything.

* **Almond Milk** - My personal favorite. A little less viscous than soy milk but it makes it up in taste. I love using it in cereal and also when making pancakes and waffles.

* **Rice Milk** - I don't have a lot of experience with it, but it's out there!

**Replacing Meat**

* **Tofu** - One could write a novel about tofu. There is a lot to discuss when exploring the wonderful world of soy bean blocks and all their potential tastiness. First and foremost is prep. Draining tofu can be a pain, but it's essential to later imbue it with as much flavor as possible. You can buy tofu presses, but really all you need to do is cut the block in half, wrap each piece generously in paper towels, place them between 2 plates, then put a heavy object on top. A tea kettle half full of water does the trick. Wait 20 minutes or so and you got some tofu ready to suck up any flavor you got. Freezing tofu overnight will deplete the water even further, but is not necessary. 

* **Tempeh** - Tempeh can be a little tricky. If not cooked enough it has the potential to make you sick and give you an upset stomach. When I buy tempeh in the store I try and cut it as thin as possible and then fry it until it's a deep golden brown. If it's cooked enough you're good to go and it's a great way to break up the monotony of eating tofu!

* **Seitan** - Seitan is a god send. It's not made of soy and you can make it in bulk. You can make 3lbs of it and freeze huge chunks for months. The [Post Punk Kitchen - Vegan With a Vengeance Recipe](http://www.theppk.com/2009/11/homemade-seitan/) is pretty much the standard. There are a million ways to cook seitan which you will find out there in the internet. I personally love making the PPK version then marinating it in BBQ sauce overnight. Fry it/grill it, slap it on a sandwich!

I tried making some tonight with almond milk and strawberries. It froze okay-ish (it turned out I didn't look through the strawberries well enough before freezing and accidentally got one too many spoiled ones in there so it wasn't good).

Anyway, I'm curious which milk you prefer for icecream making. I have some canned coconut milk I keep on hand for making some of the recipes from VeganStoner.com.

Saffron - to taste and budget. A few threads.

Rose water: 1/2 cup, or to taste.

1 cardamom pod (optional)

1/2 cup soymilk or almond milk

1 cup pistachio kernels or pistachio kernel pieces - I get a bag of kernels from Trader Joe's for $5.99 and it lasts for several quarts of this recipe)

1 quart vanilla soy ice cream (I use Trader Joe's Soy Creamy Vanilla - $3.49)

1 tsp sugar (any coarse sugar; this will be used for grinding the saffron)

Directions:

1) Put your saffron threads in a mortar. Add a tiny amount of sugar and grind with the pestle. (Optional: grind a pod of cardamom seeds into it as well. I do this, but it isn't crucial.)

If you have an ibrik or a tiny, tiny pot, follow 2a. If you don't, move to 2b.

2a) Pour into an ibrik. (I bought mine from World Market - $20) Pour soymilk on top of the dry mixture. Heat until hot. DON'T LEAVE THE IBRIK! If you have one, you probably already know this, but it will heat and rise very quickly. Take it off of the stove as soon as it does so. Stir a bit and let it sit for 5 minutes. Move on to step 3.

2b) Pour the spice mixture and soy milk into a cup. Microwave for a minute or until hot. Take it out and stir it. Leave it be for 5 minutes. Move on to step 3.

3)Empty ice cream into a bowl. Stir rosewater into the saffron milk. Mix this mixture with the ice cream; blend it well to distribute it evenly. Stir in pistachios or pistachio pieces. Enjoy or freeze to enjoy later!

So I wanted to create a dish that had a real meaty quality but staying vegan. My roommates and I are newish to the vegan diet and we have pretty high expectations on food. This came together really well last night.

Roasted Green Beans, Broccoli, and Red Bell Pepper with Tempeh and Mushroom Hunter Sauce with Mashed Sweet Potatoes and Garlic Toast

* 2 heads of broccoli, cut into florets
* 12oz green beans, trimmed and cut into 2"" pieces
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 2""x1/4"" pieces
* 12oz white button mushrooms, cleaned and sliced 1/4"" thick
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 1 tsp of salt
* 1 block tempeh, crumbled
* 1 tbs tomato paste
* 1 cup red wine, divided into 2 1/2 cups
* 2tbs soy sauce
* 2 tbs worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbs balsamic vinegar
* 1 tsp dry thyme
* 1tbs chopped fresh rosemary
* 1tbs chopped fresh parsley
* 2tbs coconut oil/vegetable oil
* 1 tbs flour
* 1 onion, diced
* 2 carrots, diced
* 2 ribs celery, diced
* 4 cups vegetable stock (If you were ever going to do home made, this is the place. when reducing boxed/canned/bouillon cubes they tend to become very salty and taste kind of like ramen. Home made vegetable stock which only takes about 45min-1hr of walk away cooking time will make this dish truly amazing)

* 1.5 lb sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1"" pieces
* 1/4 cup smart balance vegan margarine
* 2tbs brown sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup almond/soy milk

* 1 loaf french bread
* 1/3 cup vegan margarine
* 6 cloves garlic minced
* 1 tsp salt
* fresh black pepper
* 1 tbs chopped parsley (fresh)

 Heat the pan and the oil and saute the mushrooms until well browned. Add 1/2 cup red wine, 2tbs soy sauce to the pan and deglaze until all the liquid has absorbed. Remove the mushrooms and set aside. Heat 2tbs more of coconut/vegetable oil and add the carrot, onion and celery. Sweat for 3-4 min over medium heat. Add the tempeh and crank up the heat and saute over high heat until the tempeh browns lightly. (You may need to add a  touch more oil to the pan, you're supposed to be pan-frying the tempeh at this point. If when you're getting color on the tempeh you have a more than 2 tbs of oil in the pan, simply pour out the excess oil.)
Once the tempeh begins to color, add the tomato paste to the pan and cook over med-high heat and toast the tomato paste. The tomato paste will begin to darken, 1-2 min. Add the flour to the pan and toast for about 30 seconds. Add the vegetable stock and stir to mix everything in well. Bring to a boil and drop to a simmer and reduce for about 30 min. You know you're there when the liquid has reduced down to a very saucy mix. You want a good amount of liquid left but it will be rich and thick on the tongue. (if you're having troubles getting it saucy enough you can add 1 tsp of cornstarch mixed with 2tsp of water and it will thicken it up a little more).

While the sauce is simmering bring all the sweet potato ingredients together in a small pot to a simmer and cover. cook over low stirring occasionally until they come apart, about 30-40min.

Heat your oven to 450. Put a sheet pan in the oven to preheat. Toss the broccoli, green beans in olive oil. Once the oven/sheet pan are hot put the vegetable on the preheated sheet pan. Roast in the oven tossing once or twice for ~12 min. If after 10min the vegetables haven't colored put them under the broiler for the last 2 min. They should have a little bit of browning by the end.

For the garlic toast, add all the ingredients to the margarine (sans bread of course). Spread the mix over the bread and bake in the oven (already set to 450) for 6-10min depending on how cripsy you like it.

To plate: Sweet potatoes go in the center with the roasted vegetables and the sauce poured over.

Enjoy!

I'm sorry the ingredients are out of order, but as I was writing out the directions I kept remembering things I'd forgotten to include...

A little about myself: I'm a 20yo male endurance athlete (distance running/triathlon). So suggestions higher in iron, protein, and calories are better. 
I've been a vegetarian for a year now. 
I want to go vegan (moral, health, and environmental reasons though not the subject of this post). 
I tend to thrive on simplicity. For example, the core of my lunch for about 13 years of schooling was PB&amp;J. 
I don't have any food allergies that I know of.

What I'm looking for here is help constructing a simple, nutritionally sound, vegan meal plan for while I'm at school (UCLA).

Breakfast seems simple. Lately I've been going for Quakers oatmeal with banana, blueberries, and walnuts. Love it.

Snacks are trail mix (homemade: almonds, walnuts, dried cranberries, raisins, and sunflower seeds.), hummus (with carrots, broccoli, bell peppers), avocado with chips and salsa (recommendations?), and any and all fruit I can get my hands on. Has anyone had any experience with shopping for (organic) fruit in wholesale in the Westwood area? Are delivery services like FarmFreshToYou any good?

Lunches seem to be a combination of the snacks above with an almond butter and something sandwich or leftovers from dinner. Are there any good fruit spreads (ie no HFCS, CS, or added sugar)? I tried just putting a chopped banana in there and it seemed pretty good. Also, any good whole grain (wheat but willing to try other grains) bread brands? If I'm home instead of packing a lunch I will sometimes go for rice, beans, and avocado with tortilla chips.

Dinners have the most room for variation it seems. I like to have a green leafy salad for starters (spring mix, spinach, kale). And then I can make a pretty mean stir fry. Thing is that on both of those I can toss in virtually any vegetables and use white rice, brown rice, or quinoa. I can sprinkle on some nutritional yeast for B12. Is there a baseline set of vegetables I can/should use to always get all the nutrients I need? I have also taken a liking to cooking whole grain pasta, using some spices mixed in with some organic tomato sauce and again tossing in whatever veggies are lying around. On the more processed side, Dr. Praegers veggie burgers have grown onto me.

I feel lucky that I don't really crave most animal products any more. Desserts are more fruit (blackberries!!) or some dark chocolate.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: What is the simplest set of veggies I can toss on a salad and in a stir fry for dinner to be sure I'm getting all the nutrients I need as a male endurance athlete in college."	t5_2s5ei	True

[This is a **""Zucchini, Beetroot and Pumpkin Terrine with Cashew Cheese.""**](http://www.vegiehead.com/main-meals.html) You will need to ctrl+f this recipe, because it does not link directly to that point on the page. It also gives the recipe for cashew cheese.

2. [This is an **""Autumn Terrine.""**](http://vegananddemanding.com/2009/12/02/decadent-autumn-terrine/) From the recipe, I gather the primary tastes are from mushrooms, chestnuts, and shallots.

3. [This is a **""Carrot Chevre terrine.""**](http://www.ifood.tv/recipe/carrot_chevre_terrine) The recipe calls for chevre, but you can make the vegan equivalent of chevre by following [this recipe.](http://kitchen-apparel.com/2/post/2013/02/rejuvelac-and-vegan-chvre.html)"	t5_2s5ei	True

I'd say within about the past 6 or so months, I've slowly started weaning myself off of meat and have successfully not eaten any meat or dairy for the past month.

Here is what's hard for me: I'm not a big cook, and pre-made vegan food is expensive (at least where I am). So, last night I did some research. I absolutely LOVE seitan, so I tried to find a way to make it at home. I'm not sure if this is old news or if anyone is interested, but i thought I'd share this link:

**[How to make Seitan at Home](http://www.eatingrules.com/2011/10/how-to-make-seitan/)**

I made some last night and while it wasn't very flavorful, I attribute that to my inability to cook/spice things :D

Hope this helps some people!"	t5_2s5ei	True

So if someone could enlighten me about the different kinds of seitan and textures you can get from different ingredients. I've seen a recipe that incorporates mashed potatoes, and recipes with beans, and some recipes that are incredibly simple.

The only kinds of seitan I've had are ones from a vegan chinese restaurant -- I was afraid it was meat haha, it had a wonderful stringy texture and was soft (I guess), and the other kind I had was store bought (really gummy and I didn't like it that much).

The dish is basically like a creamy, saffron rice that's prepared by simmering rice in cocunut milk &amp; pureed tomatillos or tomatoes (further experiments are required).  Not quite paella, not quite risotto, not quite arroz rojo.  Sort of its own beast.  Last night I made it with some seitan chorizo, but I'm working on it for a big community pot luck and I'd like to make it gluten free.  I'm thinking tofu.  Something crispy and colorful that will contrast with the color of the saffron.  Any suggestions on a good way to prepare it?  

Edit: Additional potentially relevant dishes -- It's mostly latin-type spices."	t5_2s5ei	True

I was wondering if there are any good meals that i can make and freeze ahead of time so that we can just pull it out and have dinner ready? we both have busy schedules and i can't always be around to cook for him, i thought it might be nice to have some readymade stuff kicking around.

**Ingredients:**

-1 pound pasta (penne rigate is preferred; ziti, rigatoni, etc, also work; others may work too)

-1 bunch of swiss chard (about 2/3rd pound, I think?). You may also substitute kale or spinach for swiss chard.

-1 medium-to-small cauliflower (brocolli may also work)

-1 medium yellow onion

-1 bell pepper (colors other than green are preferred: yellow, orange, red)

-3 cloves garlic

-1 tablespoon of rinsed capers

-1/4 cup olive oil

-1/2 cup bread crumbs

-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.

**Instructions**

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
Chop up the swiss chard and divide the cauliflower into small florets. Rinse them both.
Meanwhile, chop up onion, garlic, and bell pepper.

2. Once water is boiling, add swiss chard, cauliflower, and pasta.

3. Saute bell pepper and onion in olive oil. After about two minutes, add garlic and red pepper flakes. After another minute, add breadcrumbs and capers. Occasionally stir the pasta and shift the saute. Continue to saute until the breadcrumbs and moderately browned.

4. Drain pasta once it has cooked until al dente. Combine pasta/swiss chard/cauliflower with onions/garlic/pepper/breadcrumbs/capers and toss together. Once the two components are thoroughly combined and the pasta is coated in breadcrumbs, the dish may be served."	t5_2s5ei	True

Most of that time's not active, though, so you can make your own tortillas (and you really should be making your own tortillas -- they're super easy and delicious) or some guacamole or whatever, or just sit back and enjoy a cerveza instead.  I didn't really follow a recipe and was just sort of winging it, but here's basically what I did.  You'll need:

* A beer
* 5 or 6 canned chipotles in adobo sauce
* A couple tablespoons of tomato paste
* Half an onion
* A few cloves or garlic
* Vegetable bouillon 
* 2 drained cans of young, green jackfruit in brine (NOT mature, red jackfruit in syrup)
* Salt and pepper to taste

And then... Put the first 5 ingredients in a blender and liquefy them.  Add them to a sauce pan with the jackfruit and bouillon.  Bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally.  When the jackfruit's tender and the sauce is sufficiently thick, mash them with a potato masher.  Stuff it inside some tortillas and top with your taco fixings of choice.  (I used onions, cilantro, and avocado, but you know... whatevziez.)  Et voila.  You're done.  This makes enough for probably about a dozen tacos.  So if you want less, just halve the recipe.   

I forgot to take a picture, but these look delicious.  Kind of like pulled pork or something and they're super meaty, too.  This would be a good dish to serve to an omnivore you're trying to get on the team.  

And really... you can just wing this with what you have on hand.  I had the onion, garlic, beer, and chipotles already so that's what I used.  But you could really use water and whatever your mexican seasonings of choice are or just whatever you have on hand.  Next time I think I'll try roasted fresh chilis and then some toasted, ground dried chilis with maybe a little cumin instead of the chipotles in adobo.  I'll probably add some oil, too.  These were good, but could have been improved by some fat.  And remember, these are tacos, not angel food cake.  It's going to be hard to screw these up.      "	t5_2s5ei	True

I've made them before many times, but everything went wrong that day - my broth was too hot, I waited too long to roll it up in foil and get it steaming, and then I steamed it for too long (in a pressure cooker, no less). 

My question: what should I do with it? It's still edible in its present form, just not particularly good. I'm thinking of tossing it in the food processor to chop it finely, but I have no idea where to go from there. 

Also, I was experimenting with an Indian curry-flavored sausage (cumin, coriander, turmeric, etc), so throwing it in pasta sauce or something isn't really an option."	t5_2s5ei	True
