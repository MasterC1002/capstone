Unfortunately, the popular plugin has been banned by Facebook and its developer, Arkadiusz Rzadkowolski has received a letter from the Facebook law firm, Perkins Coie, asking him to immediately cease development and publication of the plugin as well as use of Facebook and any of the services and APIs provided by Facebook.  This ban turns Arkadiusz into a Facebook outcast, but it also seriously limits his chances of finding employment as a programmer.  What makes his story worthy of investigation is the fact that Facebook hasn't seen anything wrong with the plugin for over 18 months. It's page had 135 000 fans, who encouraged Arkadiusz to add more and more features. The plugin won two awards and its source code has undergone security audit that found no malicious code.  Does no good deed go unpunished?

The users of FGS have already started an online petition to force Facebook to revert their ban.  You can sign the petition here:

1348511329.0	10ek6r	Facebook DOES NOT publish your private messages on your timeline - this is false information	ossij	30	5	26	"[Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/reports-facebook-users-seeing-private-messages-pre-2009-showing-up-on-timelines-as-posted-by-friends/#038;utm_medium=twitter&amp;%23038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29) made a post today that ""Facebook Users Report Seeing Old Private Messages Showing Up On Timelines As ‘Posted By Friends’""

This is false.

This has been in the news in Europe earlier, and it's proven false. One example is PCWorld Finland (MikroPC) who [wrote about this matter already in december](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mikropc.net%2Fkaikki_uutiset%2Farticle742440.ece) after the identical matter was  all over in the news in Finland.

The truth is that people have been posting to other people's WALLS, not using PMs. And now they can see their old wall posts, thinking they send the messages via PM.

Also, a person in the TechCrunch's comments mentioned the French press talking about the same matter already. I tried to Google, but with no French skills, couldn't find a source.

I though googled another link [claiming the exact same reason](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=458458): those are the wall posts, NOT private messages. This is just a [misunderstanding](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=34165364&amp;postcount=29).

Edit: Also Jussi Pullinen, the news editor / head of news in Helsingin Sanomat (the biggest  daily newspaper in Finland and all the Nordic countries) just [tweeted about the same matter](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://twitter.com/JussiPullinen/status/250297549292969985&amp;usg=ALkJrhjfsErB4Ky30Qhnly2aGJxpvDT3WQ).

Edit2: Here's a Google translate explanation [what really happened](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkari.haakana%2Fposts%2F10150542110657189), and yes, this was confirmed by the Facebook staff. The link doesn't seem to work at least for me, so (slightly edited to make it more-English) copy-paste of the post is here:

""One of the FB-mails affected by a bug is found. It's harmless, but it did yesterday for a moment the situation seems to show that the Private Messages would be leaked to the public. If the dreaded, serious leak bug exists, the parties should collect the evidence.

My case went like this:

1. Yesterday, when we started to hear rumors timeline ended up in the old PMs, I went first to panic just resign ourselves to remind my friends and the fact that the old FB's debate on the cultural and the user interface were different. However, I went on to examine their timeline. Nothing obvious was not found, but a few post aroused my suspicions.

2. I went to the inbox and I did search the senders name. In three cases, the search found the same messages from the Inbox, which were reflected in the timeline. I went to the timeline to take a screen shot from one of those posts. I went to the inbox, but there is no longer found in the 2007 messages.

3. I came here to tell the wall Håkan business. Were tested: Kari saw also taking control of the message, even if he was not involved in the debate. At this point, were proven that a) FB's explanation Private Messages, which are visible only to the sender and the recipient, but not the other, it was wrong, b) some of INBOX and timeline of the border leak / leakage, but we do not know, either way, because I do not remember whether the question. Messages initially on the wall or the inbox.

This discussion thread probably moved to Finland last night of the debate on the direction, because the bug discovery gave credibility to rumors, and discussion attended by a slew of the editor.

4. FB's representative asked Jussi Pullinen through contact, and I gave them permission to explore my profile. **I found an old FB history-a zip file, from which it became clear that the question of a year ago. messages have been the wall. We ended up FB with a representative of the fact that my in my case the mesages were initially public and, to a bug in the leaked through my inbox, not the other way around**. I do not have any reason to doubt this explanation.

I hear the horror stories still very secret messages that people were found from their walls, but so far I have not seen them - I hope, however, they are delivered to FB for review.""

**Disclaimer: I am a tech journo in the magazine quoted in the first link. I saw this whole thing unwrap in last December already and recognized the same thing happening again, thus posting this to Reddit, since that was the first article/source I could think about. Otherwise I would not link to our own magazine: I feel linking to our own content would be possibly against reddiquette. I usually avoid this.**"	t5_2qh8o	True

1332881370.0	rgej4	How to see who you interact with most		24	3	26	"A little trick to find out the people you interact with most is as follows (I want to put a disclaimer here that this is based on conjecture seeing some files and knowing the people I interact with most on facebook.)

Interactions are profile views, chatting, wall posts, likes etc.

Things you will need:

* chrome or firefox with firebug installed on a computer you use regularly. A clean cache, in chrome uncheck everything but the clean cache option in clear browser data.

* A facebook profile

To see who facebook thinks you interact with most and who they thing you are searching for you need to do the following

* Sign in to facebook

* Right click on the facebook page, inspect element

* Switch to the network tab (it's at the top of the inspect element partition) then switch to the XHR tab (this is along the bottom now)

* Hit f5 to refresh the whole page. (if this doesn't work clearing the cache then hitting f5 works, signing out then back in, or visiting someone who doesn't have timeline, or hitting enter in the url are ways I've seen bootstrap.php appear)

* Some files will start appearing in the partition now we are looking for bootstrap.php (usually the second one that shows up) or first_degree.php

* Click on bottstrap.php and open up the payload (bootstrap.php can contain groups/pages/etc so keep looking until you find one that has friends in it)

* The top entries show you who you interact with the most the more negative a number the more you interact with them.

This will show you everyone who you have interacted with recently (I do not know how long a time period recently is) there is more weight given to people who you don't know/people you have recently added.
Here is where it gets interesting I think this is a two way system, in this list there will be people who you have never interacted with, at all ever. I can only assume these are people that have viewed your profile.
So reddit who are your top people you interact with? And how many people have been stalking your facebook?

My top people aren't surprising best friends and family, people that appeared who I haven't stalked included the owner of a coffee shop I frequent."	t5_2qh8o	True

1328286262.0	p9e06	7 things people most lie about on Facebook.	MSaadJilani	28	6	4	"It's very easy on Facebook to present to the world the person you want to appear to be. Even if 90% of that is a lie. Well maybe lie is too strong of a word. How about white lies, exaggerating, fudging, and not telling the whole truth. It's less jerky to fudge than to lie, right?  I hope. Here are 7 things that people lie about most on Facebook.
 
**Going Offline**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-10.jpg)

'GTG! My mom's calling me to dinner!' or any variation of this excuse is a big fat lie. These people are not going offline. They just don't wanna chat anymore. They wanna play games or look at sexy pictures without being interrupted by your attempt at LOLs.  If you're gonna go 'offline', just be sure you don't do anything on Facebook that'll show up in the scroll. It can be kind of embarrassing to get busted in an 'offline lie' because you 'liked' Taco Bell. 
 
**Most Things They Say In Their 'About Me' Section**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-9.jpg)

Highlight the one cool job you ever had. Fail to mention you are currently a burrito slinger. Say you went to a prestigious university, fail to mention you flunked out after one semester. This section is full of little white lies. My favorite are the cocky mofos, who use it as a personal platform to talk about what badasses they are. These people are usually the same ones who post desperate for attention status updates or post photos of themselves where they claim to think they're ugly. 
 
**Their Age**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-3.jpg)

My 14 year old cousin and all her friends love to say they're 16. I love to inform their mothers of this. I feel bad, but not as bad as I would if they fell in love with a 22 year old creeper, who is really 38, that they met on Facebook because he was trolling for 16 year olds. Back in my day we had to meet creepers the old-fashioned way, in the 7/11 parking lot. Luckily, I knew to never accept free Slurpees from strangers.
 
**Their Profile Pic**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-4.jpg)

It's one thing to put your most flattering photo up, I mean we all do that. But if you're actually doing the equivalent of photoshop plastic surgery, you need to get a grip. Or at least take a goddamn photoshop course! DAYUM!
 
**Surprise At Receiving So Many Birthday Wishes**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-5.jpg)

Are we really all that surprised anymore that on our birthday we get a ton of birthday wishes? I'm usually surprised when I don't get a ton. I'm not the only one who sits there all day refreshing my page and making mental notes of those you didn't get wishes from, right? Hope those a-holes don't think they're getting a meaningless birthday wish from me this year!
 
**Responses To Invites**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-6.png)

There's only so many crappy band gigs and cringe-inducing improv shows one can go to! For me that number is zero. But I always put maybe and then change it to 'no', 30 minutes before the show starts. I wanna be more supportive, but right now I'm in the middle of re-watching the entire run of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Buffy &gt; everyone. 
 
**Their Interests And 'Likes'**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-8.jpg)

These sections are LIE central! Just because you took hundreds of blurry pics of your shoes doesn't make you interested in abstract art. And you can't 'like' Bob Dylan when you only know the Miley Cyrus cover of ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonsesome When You Go' .  I know you're trying to look 'mature' but he kind of looks weird sitting in between Justin Bieber and Lil Wayne. "	t5_2qh8o	True

After a while I do, so I login, try to find the ""change language"" option, set it to English, change the password and delete the profile.

Facebook doesn't delete it instantly, but only after 14 days. Initially I shrugged it off as a mistake, as she must have simply mistyped her e-mail without noticing. But a while after I noticed someone had created an account again. It must be deliberate.

Three puzzling questions arose for me:

- How do I escape from this loop other than by creating a Facebook profile of my own?

1350234289.0	11gsw9	Facebook experts - is there ANY way to use initials as a first name?	misterleisure	15	0	4	"I finally started using Facebook a couple years ago, and was sort of bummed out to find that it wouldn't allow me to use initials as my first name. My name is J.R. and that's all I've ever been called since I was born, but when I try to enter that in the first name field, Facebook forcibly changes it to J.r. - which is just wrong. As a result, I use my full first name (James), but that results in new friends that I meet not being able to find me on Facebook (or not recognizing my name when I friend request them).

I understand they want to ensure that people are using their real names, but J.R. *IS* MY REAL NAME! When I have a handful of people in my newsfeed using bizarre aliases that don't even resemble real names (some of them vulgar), there's something wrong with the system here. The worst part is, I know they used to allow names like mine because another J.R. I went to school with has his name displayed properly - it seems he was grandfathered in before they changed the way names work. Equally depressing is that, according to Google, there used to be a way to petition Facebook directly to allow a specific name change, but that also seems to have been phased out.

I'm begging you Reddit. Does anyone know how I can get my real name to display correctly on Facebook? I'm sick of using my full first name when nobody knows me that way."	t5_2qh8o	True

Did a quick search of /r/Facebook and didn't find anything similar. Not posting this to say 'wow it's a bug' or 'exploit proof of concept' or anything at all, just merely sharing info. I feel it is relevant as FB says that no one else can ever see if they are on a Close Friend's list.

Anyway, very simple: If you are on a friend's Close Friends list and they share a photo to that list, by hovering over the Privacy Settings (It will say 'custom'), the other people that appear with viewing access are that person's Close Friends list."	t5_2qh8o	True

But I'm really starting to get fed up of the whole Facebook thing.  I think its going to go down in history as one of those early 21st century fads like how they had pokemon in the 90s.

Why? Well maybe I don't have interesting friends. But here we are, on Saturday night during a holiday period. What news about my friends does facebook have to tell me?:

* One of my friends has cleaned up her rooms and now doesn't feel very well.
* Another friend posts a joke that we've seen a million times before.
* Another friend says how much he enjoyed watching Britains Got Talent. Ie (I've been sat in front of the TV all night)
* Another friend is totally fed up.
* Another friend says ""this book is amazing"" and doesn't reveal which one she has been sat reading.

Now is it just me? Or is that just all so bloody boring!?  Thats all scattered inbetween endless shite of ""which celebrity do i look like?"" , ""Share this 1000 times and he gets the operation for free"", ""I got Levelled up in Bewjewlled!""

Its all just all shite!  I am wasting my time reading utter shite and nonsense. 

I'm noticing more and more of my actually interesting friends who do have lives, never post on there or go on there at all. 

Everyone hates Timeline.  I give Facebook a couple more years before it ends up like Myspace and Friends Reunited.. its hay day is over.  It'll end up just becoming a Windows Messenger replacement.

Now that EVERYONE is on Facebook, there's a lot of crap on there I don't care about. I haven't REALLY used Facebook since maybe 2009, mostly because there are a lot of things I don't want to share with the whole world.

I use Twitter to send out little quips about stuff, and I don't really care who sees that. But with all of the integration with Facebook and privacy options and stuff, I'm really weary of things being posted on my behalf that I don't know about.

There's also the problem of having these people I've only interacted with maybe ONCE that I'm ""friends"" with and all their crap is all up in my feed. I just don't care about all of these narcissistic nimrods posting all of this vapid garbage.

I found myself checking it compulsively, awaiting the little red notifications like Pavlov's dog...

It began to occur to me how ridiculous it was to maintain these virtual relationships, and to have what once would've been private conversations in ""public""; to worry about who would see what and what their reaction would be, and then deleting comments when the response was not what I wanted or expected. I hated the idea of having a persistent online presence that needed to be maintained and monitored. Even when you're not logged in, people can comment or tag you... and I realized I could be sitting in my room, alone, and feel the effects of social anxiety just by being on Facebook.

I found myself judging people and myself - are they more successful than me? More clever? It seemed to amplify and feed into every neurotic tendency I already had.

In addition, it has caused trouble in a new relationship. It seems that if there are any jealousy issues at all, FB has the ability to compound them.

Anyhow, it feels good not to be on FB. Things have slowed down a bit. I'm more interested in authentic experiences and relationships, not communicating to 200 people how I'm feeling or what I ate for lunch (nor do I want to know these things about them)."	t5_2qh8o	True

All you have to do is find the third last number in the link:

1320814350.0	m5r00	"""Friends +"" tagging on Facebook is a HUGE privacy issue that nobody seems to be talking about"	goonie037	15	2	10	"OK Reddit. I've been diligent about trying to keep my profile friends only on Facebook. Recently I uploaded an album from vacation that I specifically set to ""Friends Only,"" or so I thought. Then I received a photo comment from a random stranger, and Facebook notified me that they were a friend of someone tagged in that photo. I went into that photo and the setting now said, ""Friends (+)""

Upon further investigation, I found out that anytime you select ""Friends Only,"" Facebook actually means ""Friends and friends of anyone tagged."" So, potentially thousands of people can see those photos and albums. **I have found no way to turn this off.** Every privacy setting explanation regarding tags on Facebook now indicates, ""tagged photos can be seen by friends and friends of friends.""

Has anyone else felt outraged by this? More importantly, has anyone found a way around this to maintain a true Friends Only profile?"	t5_2qh8o	True

&gt;Hello to all of you who are on my list of contacts of Facebook. I would like to ask a favor of you…. You may not know that Facebook has changed its privacy configuration once again. Thanks to the new “Graphic app”, any person in Facebook anywhere in the world can see our photos, our “likes” and our “comments”. During the next two weeks, I am going to keep this message posted and I ask you to do the following and comment “DONE”. Those of my friends who do not maintain my information in private will be eliminated from my list of friends, because I want the information I share with you, my friends, to remain among my friends and not be available to the whole world. I want to be able to publish photos of my friends and family without strangers being able to see them which is what happens now when you choose “like” or “comment”.
Unfortunately we cannot change this configuration because Facebook has made it like this. So, please, place your cursor over my photo that appears in this box (without clicking) and a window will open. Now move the cursor to the word “Friends”, again without clicking and then on “Settings”. Uncheck “Life Events” and “Comments and Like”. This way my activity with my family and friends will no longer be made public. Now, copy and paste this text on your own wall (do not “share” it!). Once I see it published on your page, I will uncheck the same for you. Thanks so much!

1370392860.0	1fou4j	"Don't wanna ""Happy birthday"" spam your friend? Post a link instead!"	penguinfinity	12	3	3	"I've been doing this for about a week. I used to just post ""Happy birthday!"" on their wall, even though everybody else just does the same thing. It's kind of annoying, but that's how people do things. So I thought, ""How can I make this better?""

Test Subject A is _obsessed_ with the music group 311. She's met them a bunch of times, and goes to their shows whenever possible. I'm not a fan of the band, but I did like _Down_ and _All Mixed Up_ when they came out in the mid-90s (who didn't?). And I'm also big into _Rockband_ games. So I found a video of a team of experts playing the song on all instruments, and posted a link of what my favorite song by her favorite band looks like to me when I play it. (It's not me playing, but I didn't have 3 people handy to make the video.)

Next up was a _Doctor Who_ enthusiast (and Briton) who especially has a crush on former Doctor, David Tennant. So I found a skit he and DW co-star Catherine Tate did, where she's a student and he's a substitute teacher. I'm actually going to link that [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxB1gB6K-2A), because I know a lot of Redditors love DW (also, it's funny as hell regardless of who you are). And I posted that on her Wall.

Subject C was a guy I don't really know. He's made a few Android apps and is a fan of the platform, so I just searched ""funny Android"" and came up with a foreign (Serbian?) commercial for Android phones. It's funny, an Andy the Android robot ""pet"" wakes a guy up, takes him jogging, helps him at work, stuff you would use a smartphone for.

Maybe they're not great birthday gifts, but I think they're a little less impersonal than just spamming ""Happy birthday!"" like everybody else.

I'd like for this to catch on. I'm not going to ask on Facebook because that would seem... I don't know. Self serving or something. And I don't want it to be like that at all. So if it's somebody's birthday and you know what they like... feel free to post a link. You can say happy birthday in the description, that's kind of the point, but have more than just the two words. (Of course if they're family, something heartfelt might be more appropriate -- I just mean for friends.) So, feel free to run with it. Mix up the idea any way you like. Claim it as your own for all I care. Just dare to escape the banality of spamming the same two words on somebody's wall. Dare to stand out and make them smile rather than rolling their eyes.

Just a thought. Open to suggestions as well. For now I'm only posting YouTube links, but I suppose web comics (e.g. The Oatmeal -- Inman is freaking hilarious) would work too."	t5_2qh8o	True

I am in a program in college that around 70 or so kids in my grade (college freshmen) are enrolled in. I was trying to make a page today that could be used for questions, planning get togethers/parties/study groups, whatever. First issue, I didnt have all these people as my friends. No problem, I got a roster from class and will go through and add them. Kind of a nuisance but whatever, it has to get done one way or another, since you cant add people to the group that arent your friends. Turns out, facebook doesnt really like when you do that alot (understandbaly) so i got about halfway through or so before facebook told me to slow down with that feature unless i wanna get my rights to using it revoked. Also, another thing that annoyed me, if the people I was adding didnt have any mutual friends with me, (and since along with the friend request, I was sending a message telling what i was adding them for and the link to the page), then I would have to Pay a dollar for the message to go to their actual inbox, where you actually get the notification. Otherwise you have to send it to their ""Others"" mail box, where you dont get a notification. Gah. Like I understand the reasoning behind all of this and I get it, I just wish I could like confirm with facebook in some way that this was for a legitimate reason. Hahah.

Hi jeannie, I am the admin of that page you are interested in.
Are there any terms you would like to discuss?
Also what is your website id be glad to check it out  if you send me your email i can send a Paypal payment request. As soon as the payment has been received I will allow you complete access and admin rights. i would no longer have any privileges, deleting myself completely. I will be glad to sell you the page for AU $1950.
just for your own piece of mind, I have utilised the page for promotion of friends products and they receive tens of thousands of views from one post alone. I think it would be a great asset to you

This is my email angeljenny140@yahoo.com, you can send me an invoice right now.

10:35pm
Jeannie Rachelle
Andrew, let me tell you how i buy pages. This may be your first time selling a Facebook page but i buy regularly. First you will send me the invoice after that you will make me admin on the page. We both will remain admin until you receive the money. Once the money is received you will remove yourself from the page.

10:38pm

okay the payment request has been sent to your email

10:41pm
Jeannie Rachelle
Ok. Now kindly make me admin

10:44pm

this is my second time I've sold a page, with all due respect I would be more comfortable to receive the payment before I add you as admin, is this okay?

10:45pm
Jeannie Rachelle
Sorry, i have bought many pages and this is how i deal. You have to add me as admin first. We both will remain admin on the page and then i will send you the money.

10:49pm

okay i have added you

10:50pm
Jeannie Rachelle
Andrew, i am paying you for the complete admin rights of the page. Please make me Manager first

10:51pm

You will receive full management rights after payment
or if you want to be fair at least half of the payment now and half when I add you as manager, just as a sign of goodwill
i am willing to cooperate 100% as long as i have a piece of mind

10:52pm
Jeannie Rachelle
you can remove me from the page once i send money. I have many pages and i can make you admin on pages to justify myself.

okay there you go, i have held up my part of the deal

I'm sending you money now

you have undertaken misleading and deceptive conduct which would result in a void of contract. you led me to believe that you were in a position of experience and knowledge - you told me you had purchased numerous pages. i would appreciate if you unbocked me and re-made me admin

I tried logging in, hoping to see a message similar to ""No such account exist, would you like to create one?"" or something to the effect of acknowledgement that all information has been deleted and it could not find it the system.


Instead I got a welcome back message, along with a list of previous e-mail addresses I used in the account I requested to be deleted two months ago - and the same two-week notice as before


*""Your account will be deleted on Sunday, January 22, 2012. Your account is scheduled for deletion. Are you sure you wish to permanently delete your account?""*


So their two-week notice is an indefinite two-week notice? You are always two weeks away from having your account deleted? To test how far they have **not** deleted my account I clicked ""No"". Received an e-mail with subject ""Welcome back to Facebook‏""


My profile was reactivated, in full, with all pictures, wall posts, friends, etc. Everything. Two months after I specifically requested everything to be permanently deleted, with confirmation, and blocked everything Facebook.


I went through the whole procedure to have it ""permanently deleted"" again today, but I doubt it will ever be truly ""permanently deleted"" just 'deactivated' with all information waiting until I may log back in someday.

Is there a way to permanently delete your account, and all information?


***TL;DR: Requested to permanently delete my account, received confirmation to that effect and blocked everything Facebook for two months - turned out information was not deleted, just deactivated.***

TempAlt	9	0	8	In the past, when Facebook has made major design revisions, the userbase has always complained and hated the changes. Then inevitably a few weeks later the change is totally forgotten and everything goes back to normal. However, if facebook does this now, users have a legitimate alternative to switch to in Google+. Every time they make an initially unpopular design decision, they may drive more and more people running to Google. Furthermore, if they happen to make a particularly disastrous decision, it could trigger a mass-exodus from Facebook, similar to what we saw when people left Myspace for Facebook. People could start to perceive Facebook as outdated, uncool, or possibly desperate and that could be it for them. They gotta be careful switching things up now that they have a real competitor.	t5_2qh8o	True

Obviously, the URL was freshly bought so I pinned the problem down to previous owners using it for the wrong reasons. I submitted a few forms explaining that the site was now nothing more than a Wordpress blog, and left it for a while.

Now, eight months on, my site still remains blocked.

1370879152.0	1g1tcf	Am I crazy, or did facebook delete my post about the NSA Snowden leak?	cadansereau	6	0	14	"Last night I shared this link: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance on my facebook wall around 12:30 am, New York time. I was posting comments about it, elaborating my thoughts on the matter. Suddenly, as I tried to post another comment, an error message showed up telling me that the content I was trying to comment on did not exist (if I recall correctly it said that it had been deleted by the original poster (myself)).
I have nothing to prove any of this - the post disappeared without a trace.
If this is just a glitch, I have never experienced one like it before--and it seems very strange that it happened to this post in particular. A friend told me that someone else he knew also had an NSA post mysteriously disappear.
Though I'm usually very skeptical, I am tempted to jump to a conspiracy theory right now. Is there a reason I shouldn't do so? 
If my post was intentionally deleted by facebook, or the NSA, or whoever else, it would seem to be highly ironic, since the issue at hand is the incursion of the NSA into our private information, and one of the fears associated with Prism is that it constitutes (or foreshadows) a Orwellian thought-police scenario--which is exactly what would seem to be implied if my facebook post were really censored. 
Am I crazy? Can people think of other ways to interpret the disappearance of my post?

When you go onto the actual album and it gives the thumbnail previews of all the pictures in the album, the particular picture I want to use for my profile picture is actually still really good quality, it just seems that when I assign it to my profile picture if you look at it from my profile the picture looks blurred.

I feel like there must be a way to fix this, seeing as though the album thumbnails are pretty much the exact same size and are perfect quality. Is there a way?"	t5_2qh8o	True
1352026939.0	12lwca	Need to make an alt account because of family drama, and almost getting kicked out. But I don't want to lose the information/memories on the original account, what's the best way to go about doing this?	name_taken_	10	3	3	"I don't want to post up a long story but I'll try to summarize how seriously my family takes facebook. My parents first made an account about 2 years ago, and started stalking me, thats fine. Its good to check up on your children. They noticed I liked a page that relates to my ethnicity, they get upset and say, I shit you not, ""People will see that and try to fight you over your race. Gangsters will kill you for repping it."" I'm in a little trouble, what ever. I start unliking things that seem even remotely incriminating. Fast forward about a year, all my aunts get on the bandwagon and make facebook accounts, start commenting on everything (which is fine), but they instigate on every post. That's not really social, but its fine. I guess. Then my aunts who aren't that great at english misread everything and exaggerate everything and start spreading rumors. I block my wall from them, this is getting out of hand. I can't delete them because the drama will get worse.

Now the other day shit hit the fan and I decided I can't take it anymore; as a joke ""I'm engaged"" on facebook. Everyone does it right? its funny, its cute, its for when you're in a serious relationship so ""in a relationship"" just doesn't say how much the relationship means to you, and ""engaged"" does because its more serious but since its online its just pretty cute. Anyway, my parents noticed this (my wall is blocked from family, but my gf's wall isn't) and started yelling at me. I calmly told them it was a joke but then they just blew up on me. Demanding to know where I would get the money to support her, let alone a family, you're not even done with school and you're planning on getting married, you're stupid to be engaged without even a job, if you're ready to be engaged you're ready to get out of my house, etc,. I also took out swear words, watered it down, and shortened the yelling from about 20 minutes to a few sentences. I updated my facebook to be more honest, they're still upset that it still says ""engaged"" (the GF's page still says engaged since she hasn't logged on yet) and repeat what they said and berate me for about another 25 minutes pointing at their computer screen yelling about how it says that my GF just got engaged and earlier that it probably had my name on it.

so yeah, if its online, it must be true. I completely regret letting my relatives as a friend, you add one, then they all get jealous, then you add more. They start drama, online of all places, then bring it to actual get togethers, then get confused and butthurt when people delete or block them.

Anyway, facebook is pretty much the main way I use to socialize and what have you, I use it to run a school club page, its my main source of contact between friends (especially those without a cellphone or can't text), I use it to find about upcoming events, and every once in a while I'll catch up with old friends I haven't heard from in a while. To put it shortly, I use this social tool as a social tool. I honestly don't want to start a new account (unless its for family) because of all the memories kept on it. Facebook is literally a time capsule since freshman year of college. I was looking through it the other day and it was full of all these memories since the beginning of college,..and spam from relatives that think tagging people in their ""funny and cool"" photos makes them hip.

I've had an alt account, I just never got around to using it but now I feel compelled to; just so I can have an account to actually use and not worry what my relatives will see and one to leave as an empty slate so my relatives can go wild on it without me worrying. The thing is though, what would be the best way to go about doing this? I want to transfer all of my relatives and all of their stuff that they have me tagged in (all spam) onto a new account. I know this probably isn't possible, but I'm hoping through some stretch of luck someone can help me out with this. I really don't want to start a fresh account because honestly, looking back from just a few years ago I've changed a lot and so much is on my original account. I can't delete my relatives and re-add them because well, I'm sure they'll notice if they do and they'll assume and gossip.

**TL;DR** I typed up the previous paragraphs while not in a clear state of mind, so I'm sorry if it may seem illegible but I guess I'll keep it up for context. Throwaway account for the sake of anonymity. I need to make an alt account because my relatives use facebook in all the wrong ways and take it WAY too seriously. Is it possible to transfer them and all their tags (spam) onto another account without them knowing? I know its a long shot, but I'm hoping that someone on here might actually work at facebook to help me out. Or maybe someone even went through this and could tell me how they handled it and what went down. I'm seriously considering reposting this on askreddit since there's so much people subscribed there, but I'm cautious that people I know may see this.

**Still TL;DR** I miss when you needed a college email to make a facebook account."	t5_2qh8o	True

Seemed like a simple enough task, just really tedious (they have something like 2500 friends).

I've been getting at it, and occasionally noticing large gaps where no one has an email listed. This happened to me again today. Befuddled, I went back to someone whose email I had picked up five minutes earlier to see if it was still listed. It was not.

Does Facebook send your profile into some ""spammer block"" feature if you scour too many info pages in too short a time? I'm now able to see all basic information: bio, favorite quotes, movies, TV shows, music, books, relationship status- just not contact information.

TL;DR: Making e-mailing list of office's Facebook friends. Facebook stopped showing me the emails of users. Why is this?

I don't know my next door neighbour's first names or how many children they have but I have memorized the outfit Sherry was wearing in her engagement photos posted on one of her ""Facebook albums""-Sherry was in my kindergarten class and I haven't seen her since.

When my landline or cell phone rings I ignore it and let it go to answering service (note, I never return a phone call). I am always MIA when the phone rings but if you log onto ""Facebook"", you will notice that I have updated my status 45 times in the past 30 minutes. 

When a woman smiles at me while walking past me in the hallway at work, I blankly stare ahead. Smiling, what's that? I never have to smile at my computer or I-phone. 

Jessie's birthday yesterday, Krista's birthday today-wished them both happy birthday thanks to the friendly reminder on ""Facebook""-when is Mom's birthday again? I wish she would get a ""Facebook"" account so I would know these things.

My neighbour just left a message wondering if I would drive her to a doctor's appointment as her car is in the shop. Thank god I can just text her back ""no"" without seeing her face and feeling guilty. God I love not having to face people with text!

How many friends do I have on ""Facebook""-347! How many goals did my son score in his last hockey game? How would I know-I was too busy checking my I-phone during the game. 

Some friends wanted to go out for a coffee tonight, not going! Three reasons:
1) I never have anything to say to these people, I know what's going on in their lives they are on my ""Friends List"".

 2) They are not laid back about texting during our get-togethers, I'll get so antsy not being able to check my I-phone, I might start shaking and spill my coffee on my shirt! 

3) I'm so tired, I was up until 1 am looking at my boss' photos from her Hawaii trip on ""Facebook"".

Its widely known that facebook records your every single click, so it could be because you go to their profile more often so you get their updates.

I've noticed a that a lot of the event's I've come across have their links redirecting to my Facebook events feed, and won't let me look at the event that I clicked on unless I'm directly invited, or Facebook suggests it to me. My own links for the band pages I manage are having the same problem fans of the page who aren't personally invited. I'm not friends with every fan of the pages, so I can't invite them. I haven't been able to find any news or blog articles addressing this change.

I did a little digging and trouble shooting; what I've found is that for events that my pages create, I don't have the ability to edit privacy settings. The privacy settings by default seems to be that only fans can see the events. I don't have the option to make them public like I'd want to for web links to be effective.
I do have the ability to edit privacy settings for personal events though. Strangely, I can not add a page that I'm an administrator for as an event host. It seems to me that this update is the latest effort by Facebook to cut down on event spam and keep people from circumventing the 300 outstanding invitation rule.

Why? Are they insensitive, heartless jerks? No, it's because if they spam their friends, they get points, and they get more if you bite. Some will respect you, but most will not.

Aggravatingly, Facebook makes it harder and harder to actually block these requests. You can always ignore them, but actually blocking them is much harder. So, I don't know how long this tip will be good for. Until then...

[Go to this URL.](https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/requests) If you had to sign into Facebook, close the tab and click again.

See where it says, ""John F. Kennedy invited you to play The Grassy Knoll""? Point at that and hit the X that appears in the upper right corner. Now you will see two options. ""Block all requests from The Grassy Knoll"" and ""Block all requests from John F. Kennedy.""

Now block both the friend and the app. This won't affect your friendship status with the friend, but when they go to select friends in the app, your name will not even appear. The app will look at your friend's contacts, but since you have blocked the app, you won't be there. Blocking the friend rather than just the app means that no matter what app your friends use, they will not be able to send you a request.

At this point it is impossible to block everyone at once. It would be nice to make a simple Facebook game that does nothing but tag all of your friends, and then do nothing with the data. So you would tag all your friends, and ask them to do the same. Then you would just block each other. But if everyone did this, Facebook would lose a ton of money. And that's why it isn't easier."	t5_2qh8o	True

When I got back on March, I found out that my valuable Facebook notes were deleted. Not all the notes, just the valuable ones between September 2011 and January 2012. 

Among these notes was a constantly updated vocabulary list, joke list, happiness theories list, and my personal aphorism list.

I looked back at these pages a lot. It had a good number of comments and likes. And the notes had a very high word count. Somehow, Facebook statistics must have picked up on how valuable these notes were to me.

So because I reactivated my account, I'm thinking Facebook deleted these notes on purpose so that I wouldn't deactivate my account again (On the threat that I would loose the older still undeleted notes).

I know it sounds crazy,  but it's the only explanation.

I have reported the problem to them countless times, and they have not responded to me once. The problem isn't on their known issues page. And I can't find one person on the internet who ever shared the same problem as me.

I'm guessing that because Facebook knew I was a marginal Note lover, they figured that they could ignore complaints from people like me.

story is ahead but the TL;DR is that I lost 24 hours of communication on Facebook. No biggie, but the threat of the 3rd violation and the silliness that I have two unfair ""warnings"" on my record are a concern to me.

I'd love any and all assistance in bringing this to the right people's attention.  if this isn't the right subreddit, please point me in the appropriate direction.

------------------


A week ago I was given notice from Facebook that a post, where I said verbatim: ""No, Frank, REAL advice"", somehow violates Facebook community standards.  I later wrote on that page in the middle of that conversation ""apparently it somehow violates community standards when I say 'No, Frank, REAL advice""  

Funny thing is, the kid and I aren't Facebook friends but know each other through a revival campaign effort for a television show.  Here's my perspective on him.

-I am an admin assistant and often get chosen to handle big stuff.  out of 11 thousand people, a few hundred actively post on Facebook, and a few dozen would kill to be where I'm at. anytime an official admin mentions me there's at least one kid who will yell ""WHY AM I NOT ONE?"".

-the kid once publicly said ""WHY IS Ginger_Shepherd and *insertothernamehere* in charge of getting better merch released?!"" before having a mini-bitch fest about taking matters into his own hands wanting to start his own ""mini-project/mission"" thing with the other members, one that any admin would tell him is...shall we say inadvisable?  (something about spamming the fuck out of youtube.  which is against our rules)

that day I told him ""I didn't appreciate what you said in public, and that's a big reason you're not going to get the kind of responsibility you want.  and honestly regarding your idea: meh.  it's not really a mission, it sounds like what a lot of kids already for us on their own. I think you're a bright kid and can come up with better""

He bitched out even more.  swearing and yelling privately.  never apologized.  weeks pass and he's sucking up like nothing happened.  

the rest of the admin and I, just from observation alone (they don't even KNOW about his bitchfest) have reason to believe he made the report.

sounds to me like he provided added details in the report saying something to the effect of me being a cold, controlling, high-standards, condescending, meanie or whatever.  

edit: just got a 3 DAY BLOCK because the kid reported when I said ""dude...buddy...amigo.....stop copying every thing I say...it's creepy"""	t5_2qh8o	True

There is the main newsfeed, which is now only showing posts from about half of my friends and pages I follow, and the stuff it is showing is out of order (when I first logged on this morning, it was worse than the image I posted-- the first five posts were in this order: posted 12 hours ago, posted 53 minutes ago, posted 6 hours ago, posted about an hour ago, posted 13 minutes ago). 

A second, smaller newsfeed also appeared to the right and is telling me some stuff I don't care to know, such as when my friends like or comment on statuses of people I'm not friends with-- the most disturbing part of this is when I hover over these newsbits it shows what the complete original status of that non-friend. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? My husband's Facebook still looks the same as it always has (well, since the last update). Also, is there a way to switch it back or at least turn off the smaller newsfeed and get ALL of my friends/liked pages to show up in my main newsfeed? I usually don't have a problem with Facebook redesigns and updates, but this one makes it pretty much useless to me and it worries me that in the secondary feed non-friends may be able to see my statuses when my friends comment on them (even though I have my page and status set to friends only).

Black_Apalachi	6	0	1	"The ideal system would be to allow the user to choose which page to link to -- if any at all. There are often multiple duplicates of the same fan page but it somehow decides by itself which one it wants to link to and this may or may not be the most popular page.  
  
When connecting pages to my profile, I like to make sure there is a thumbnail and if there is more than one option, I'll usually go for the most popular page. However, a lot of the time I'd much rather the freedom to just write exactly what I want instead of being forced to display a misspelled or badly written title (I know you can add your own new title, but it usually ends up linking itself to a page later on and changing the characters in the process).  
  
I can live with all the problems mentioned above, but the most irritating thing is when the author of a page constantly spams it with tons of irrelevant ""updates"". This mostly came to my attention when I added the ""Favourite Athletes"" section. For example, I added Lionel Messi so Facebook linked my profile to a Lionel Messi ""fan page"" created by some randomer, so now my main homepage is constantly spammed with photos and other shit about Messi.  
  
I understand that this is a side-effect of joining a group/becoming a fan, but I didn't -- I merely wanted to add an entry to my favourite stuff. I also realise I can hide posts from specific sources too, but still, the old Facebook layout was so much better in this respect."	t5_2qh8o	True

*Finding you on Facebook
To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your contact information (such as email address or telephone number) to find you through the Facebook search bar at the top of most pages, as well as other tools we provide, such as contact importers - even if you have not shared your contact information with them on Facebook.
You can choose who can look up your timeline using the email address or telephone number you added to your timeline through your privacy settings. But remember that people can still find you or a link to your timeline on Facebook through other people and the things they share about you or through other posts, like if you are tagged in a friend's photo or post something to a public page.
Your settings do not control whether people can find you or a link to your timeline when they search for content they have permission to see, like a photo or other story you've been tagged in.*

It sounds like it's no longer a feature they have any more? Apologies if this is dumb, it's only now I've had to worry about it.

Instead, they make it a game;  you have to try to *figure out* why it was rejected.  

So, the latest ad, I figured had to much text so I kept cropping out the text until there was NOTHING LEFT and it was still rejected (guidelines say less than 20 percent of the photo should be text... well, ZERO percent got rejected.)  The girl in the picture (totally clothed) was smoking a ciggy and drinking a beer.  So, I photo-shopped out the ciggy and the beer... STILL REJECTED!  What the fuck??

Why do I want to 'promote' a post rather than buy an ad?  Good question!  The answer is that I am in Japan and almost *everyone* is on FB mobile.  Ads basically don't show on FB mobile, so they are a complete waste here in the rising sun land.  Promoted posts, given we have quite a few likes, would be the best way to go.

Any idea what that's about? She says she doesn't care because she doesn't send out friend requests, but that the messages are annoying.

I'm thinking you would normally get that if you send out a ton of friend requests and an abnormally high number of people report that they don't know you. Everyone is telling her to change her password. And that's good advice, but I haven't seen anything weird coming from her account. No funny links, no ""like/share/comment or you hate your grandmother"" crap, nothing. Just typical auntie stuff, I guess.

So... any other explanations? Or is it actually likely that somebody hacked her account just to send off thousands of friend requests?"	t5_2qh8o	True
1355871564.0	152r2c	Privacy settings and posting by apps (twitter, phone, etc.)	irresolute_essayist	6	1	0	"Question:

When I post on facebook by twitter, my phone, ANY OUTSIDE application it automatically only allows a group of 5 of my friends to see it. (Coincidentally(?), it's the same 5 friends I allowed to see a certain Christmas party album last year). 

It's been going on for a long time, and-- while my default setting is for ALL friends to see my posts-- whenever I use an outside app the default setting is the same as I entered for that one album. I have no idea why.

I'm wondering what the potential down side to this would be.  Does facebook limit the amount of storage space each person gets for storing photos?  (I've got almost 200 GB of photos!)  Do they ever delete photos, like if nobody looks at them for a year or something? (Like I said, I'm using this for backup, so I'd probably not access them too often.)  Anything else?
