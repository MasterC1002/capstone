Alright, men. You've been working damn hard lately and the Green Dawn Army is growing every day. We're proud of you. So, time for some R&amp;R for our men.


Operation: LepreDawn


This operation's goal is to get a massive troop deployment out to as many bars as possible on March 16th. They've earned it. 

For those of you participating: get some nice shots of your troops placed strategically around local bars, maybe enjoying a nice beverage, and if it's impressive you will recieve one rank promotion. 

*Please note the bars you visit and place troops at must be marked on the map.*


This comes also with a badge for participating in the operation

I've noticed a lot of you slacking off around here lately, so we're going to have an operation that will provide more troops in the field, and a little friendly competition.


Welcome to Operation: Pickle Vs. Banana.


Pick your side. Do you prefer the crisp, succulent feeling when you bite into a pickle on a hot day? Mayhaps you prefer the feeling of unwrapping a banana like a child with a present on Christmas morning?


Perhaps you like both? 

Too bad. For this operation, you must decide which team you will be aiding.


**Mission:** 

*  Invade local supply distributors (read: supermarkets, grocery stores) and provide defense for your team. 


*  Place troops detaining/attacking the enemy in the same supermarket.


*  Do you keep a safe HQ? I know I do. Make sure there is a troop next to your pickle jar/banana hanger at home base.


Provide photographic evidence of these things in a post to comm base 001 Mike Delta ^^^/r/GreenDawn Charlie one-two, as usual.


Our operations in the past have been swift deployments, sometimes lasting only a day. This will be different. Operation Pickle Vs. Banana will be a prolonged engagement, lasting two weeks. 06/17-07/01.


**To The Victor Go The Spoils:** At the end of the battle, we will count up how many posts there are for each side. Every officer that has posted for the winning side will recieve a rank promotion and a badge to show they have fought and won the great battle of PVB. You may notice this is kind of similar to the whole Orangered Vs. Perriwinkle debacle in April.


When posting recon photos, please start your post title with [Pickle] or [Banana] to make it clear which side you are on. For instance:


[Pickle] Bananas detained in Sector 1:541. VIVA LA PICKLE!!


or


[Banana] Pickle scum destroyed in S1:503. Better dead than a pickle lover!


Officers who have posted in favor of *both* sides in some sort of lame attempt to weasle into a promotion will be disqualified and recieve a **demerit,** so you know, don't do that.


Also, don't let color make your decision for you. Just like our tan, grey, blue soldiers out there (I even saw a pink one the other day. I'm...not really sure what kind of terrain he was camoflauged for, but that's not the point) they are just camoflauged for their mission. They're all green underneath, to the depths of their bones. They still sweat and bleed green, and just like those soldiers, all Bananas were green once, too, so keep that in mind.


There are high ranking officers on both sides as well. I can assure you there has been no small amount of shit talking in the ~~mod mail~~ War Room while planning this operation.

Remember our **main objective* here: 

*  Strategically place soldiers **in the public**. Posts of an army man skewering a banana on your kitchen counter will **not** be counted for the competition. We are looking to hit the commisaries.


*  Have fun. If you're not enjoying destroying your enemy, we're not enjoying your post.

**Note:** Admittedly,~~Mods~~ The upper brass has been slacking a bit as well. If you have earned a rank promotion and not recieved it, please message the mods, or [Vice Admiral Echo_Bravo](/u/euphoric_barley), he *loves* giving out ~~flair~~ rank promotions.


We may post updates here in case there is anything I've forgotten, other than that I think that wraps up this briefing.


Questions? Post them here. 


**Claim your side. Place your troops. Bring glory and victory to your team.**

Things have been a little slow with the revolution lately and we're hoping to kick things up a notch with an operation everyone can have a little fun with. This operation will most likely last a couple weeks, differing from previous operations we've had that were in and out one or two day operations, so we'll have more time to accomplish our goals.

Be warned, this may split the ranks of Green Dawn for a couple weeks. Everyone please keep your comms tuned to channel five niner Hotel Zulu http://www.reddit.com/r/greendawn Mike seven four four two for further instructions. Also, start thinking of what you like more: Pickles or Bananas.

The lobby is this huge, open glass room with  a second story walkway. I had placed some really good troops in the lobby. About 15 total. Most were really well hidden, but I got a couple placed in such a way that I couldn't imagine how someone could remove them. For example, on the second floor walkway I was able to slip them down through the crack onto the steel beam. You could see them pretty well from below. Another example was the best troop ever. Since the lobby is vaulted I was able to climb up this beam and place a guy on the 2.5 floor window sill. It was so obvious and I couldn't see how someone could take it down without some long pole or being able to climb better than me. Well this week I noticed they were all gone. All of them. Like even the fucking hidden bastards. The rest of my troops were still in place. E.g. Sgt. Bobby Shaftoe. Pissed-off to say the least. I stayed late on a friday to get that fucker up on the window without anyone seeing me. I thought maybe the janitor was noticing and finally decided to do something about it. This kinda made sense but i don't think a janitor gives a shit enough to spend 30 minutes taking down army men. Then I heard the truth. There was a camera crew taking hi-res pictures of the lobby for some marketing bullshit and they kept finding army men in the images. Totally worth it. Over.	t5_2v4g8	True

S:1-867), in the description fill out the troops deployed or any other relevant information (I.E. 10 troops deployed), click OK. Then over on the left click [Save and Done](http://i.imgur.com/6hQvFVx.jpg)

If you can't see your troops once you have edited the map, have no fear! They are still there, you need to scroll down to the bottom of the placement list and [click on the last page](http://i.imgur.com/svCc5ot.jpg). As of this edit we are up to page 3! 

If you accidentally move someones marker you need to fix that right away. To do this look at the [top of the map and click undo](http://i.imgur.com/sI4W6aE.jpg). You **can not undo** if you do/click anything else, so please be careful when editing the map, respect other peoples markers, if things get moved we get confused, if we get confused then the enemy wins!

Schuuugg	58	8	8	"Reporting from a VERY small town in NW Florida, which is the official record holder for more churches per capita than anywhere else IN THE WORLD!  Years ago, before I got old, my bitch pack decided to do this one night - super glue army men in odd locations around town.  There just wasn't anything else to do - drink a little Boone's and glue a few army men.  Most chicks in our town would be drinking a little Boone's and nailing a few army men.

The streets were dead, it was a Saturday night, our main target was phone booths, sidewalks, park benches, playground equipment... nothing major.  We glued some dudes, got a buzz, laughed, and went home.  

Monday rolls around, and I leave work to go into town and grab a burger.  As I'm driving by one of the gas stations, I glance over to gigglewatch one of the phone booths we ""GreenDawned.""  That mothereffer was crime scene taped, road coned, 2-3 sheriff's officer vehicles, officers standing around, the effing crime scene big ass square van, some chick in gloves was dusting the whole booth for prints, some dude was taking pictures!!!  I shit you not, mang!

I went back to work all freaked out and talked to my boss (who was an attorney and a member of the sheriff's task force board thing).  She laughed her ass off and called ""Wendall.""  Made me explain to him on speaker phone and confess while she laughed hysterically.  Come to find out, they thought it was gang activity.  Ummmm, no.

Sadly, that's the second time I had to explain myself via speakerphone to the sheriff while my boss laughed her ass off in the back ground.  This subreddit made me remember that, and I hadn't thought about it in a long time - kind of makes me want to go buy some cheap wine, some green army dudes, and some super glue..."	t5_2v4g8	True

**Ranking Promotion:** Updated 02/02/2013 0900 hrs.

If you are not posting, you are merely an observer of the glory that is Green Dawn. Do your part. The Admirals and Vice Admirals, along with Captain Voraidicon, had a meeting at the war table last night and decided how exactly you may be promoted through the ranks of the Green Dawn Army. This is for initial promotions. Please note: Promotions to higher ranks will increase significantly in difficulty.

**CWO RANK PROMOTIONS:**

*Chief Warrant Officer 1:** Submit your first post to /r/GreenDawn. Must be of a troop in the public. Repost someone else's picture, you're dishonerably discharged (read: banned.)

*Chief Warrant Officer 2:* Post and document one full squadron (42 troops, since they seem to come in this amount in standard issue bags.) Try to keep these in albums as much as possible to provide ease of confirmation. We appreciate it.

*Chief Warrant Officer 3:* Targeting. We need to make sure we are securing key points of interest in our home towns. If we're not protecting our civilians, we may as well be tossing them into the gaping maw of the enemy to be shredded to little green bits. We're not gonna let that happen. It's your job to place no less than three troops in these three locations in your town:

*  Post Office

*  Cour House/City Hall

*  Library

These must be in the same album and the three locations must be marked on the map.

*Chief Warrant Officer 4:* Before you reach the last level of CWO4 and get ready to achieve the respected rank of Ensign, you must achieve two things to show your dedication to the case.

*  *1:* Mark at least 20 of your troops on the map in the sidebar. You should be doing this for every troop you post, but we understand that we're all busy people and there's a lot of posting and fighting going on for you to be bogged down with paperwork. Ensure you've marked *at least* 20 on the map. 

*  *2:* Document that a troop in the field has lasted 30 days. We need you to show us that you have learned the skills for placing troops stealthily. Throwing troops about all willy nilly is not recommended behaviour in our soldiers. 

**Please note:** These tasks can be combined. You can include the Targeting task force map placements in your 20 for CWO4. Your first troop placed in your initial squadron could be the one that lasts 30 days. That way, you can be getting the others done in the meantime and before you're done, you've already gotten CWO4 rank in the bag. Also, you cannot jump ranks. If you hit the Primary Targers for CWO3 but haven't deployed a whole squadron yet, you will not be jumped up.

Also, we may have periodic contests or other ways to skip jump rank. Monitor the comm link (/r/greendawn) for updates on this. 


Godspeed.

AFTER ACTION REPORT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING:

On the morning of January 18th, the deployment of troops to a classified location in sector 650 (herein referred to as Operation Invisible Shield) commenced with great enthusiasm from the troops. A pair of reconnaissance units were deployed in grid Echo 2 to keep tabs on an enemy command post in the immediate vicinity. Less than one week after the initial deployment, contact was lost with the recon team. Upon sending a patrol to investigate, soldiers reported that one man (Pvt. Green) was MIA from the recon patrol. His partner *name withheld* was spotted in an overwatch position, but attempts to raise him on the radio were fruitless.

Command wasted no time in organizing a search and rescue operation. Before laying out a search pattern, HQ radio operators made a second attempt to contact Pvt. Green's partner. This time the efforts were successful, and he relayed a report that gravely concerned S650 intelligence.

*Name withheld* reported that at approximately 1400 hours on January the 25th, 2013, Pvt. Green's location had been compromised by an enemy patrol. Outnumbered and outgunned, Pvt. Green was forced to surrender. *Name withheld* continued to observe as his partner was captured and transported to a holding facility kept under constant guard by the enemy.

Now knowing the location at which Pvt. Green was being held, S650 command immediately organized a rescue attempt. Selecting an elite team of 7 highly trained soldiers, Ensign CT999 ordered an infiltration and raid to begin at 1500 hours January 29th, with the goal of liberating Pvt. Green from his captors. At this time it was not known if Pvt. Green was still alive.

At 1502 hours, the raid kicked off. Moving swiftly and with diligence, the rescue team navigated the treacherous terrain of desks and shelves under the watchful eye of *name withheld*. After encountering minimal resistance, Pvt. Green was located, unconscious, and moved to the extraction point. He, along with the rescue squad, were safely extracted to a nearby field hospital where Pvt. Green was examined and found to bear signs of torture and malnourishment. He underwent immediate surgery, and, upon regaining consciousness, informed command that he had been tortured in an attempt to learn information about Operation Invisible Shield. He informed a relieved panel of officers that he had not compromised any information, and had survived his grueling experience only revealing his name, rank, and serial number. He also informed Ensign CT999 that his execution had been planned for the next morning.

In the face of extreme danger, Pvt. Green exhibited qualities in keeping with the most noble traditions of /r/greendawn. Following his medical release he is scheduled to receive the Silver Star for his diligence, and a Purple Heart for his wounds.

*Name withheld* remains deployed and in cover. A reinforcement unit is scheduled to strengthen his grid sector tomorrow. Without the intelligence he gathered or the guidance he relayed to the rescue team, Pvt. Green would have surely been KIA at the hands of a ruthless enemy. After his deployment ends, *name withheld* is slated to receive a Bronze Star and commendation for his actions in the face of danger.

1364596604.0	1b9qfi	[Announcement] Operation: Fool's Errand. You have three days to prepare!	Kvothe24	49	5	8	"Hello, soldiers.

It's time for another mass deployment to commence. Thank you everyone who participated in our last one, Operation: LepreDawn. The footage from that was amazing and I hope those who participated are enjoying their new rank and flair.

April Fool's Day is in three days. What bether day to confound the world than to rain green army men upon them?

The main goal here is numbers. Those of you who get a full squadron out (42 troops) *on April 1st* and update the map with their location will recieve a rank promotion. You will also recieve a ribbon for your uniform that will signify participation in the op. If you put two squadrons out (and update the mapping center) we will bump you up two ranks. 

*Please note these rank promotions are only available to thouse still in CWO status. You cannot reach Ensign with these this op.*

The idea for Operation: Fool's Errand is to keep soldiers on you at all times as you go about your day, spreading them far and wide in your workplace and every stop for any errands you run. 

Getting some fuel? Leave some troops at the gas station. 

Grocery shopping? Army men gotta eat too.

Stopping by the liqour store? Our troops are known for their thirst, as Operation: LepreDawn showed.

You get the idea. Carry as many on your person as you can, then when you've placed them, fill your pockets again for the next stop.

If you have any questions or thoughts, post them here.

Alrght, soldiers. Get out there and makes Green Dawn proud!

Much to our surprise/dismay, there were no troops at attention at the front entrance. We entered the facility with a great deal of caution, and luckily we encountered no hostiles. No hostiles present, but all of the troops on duty were gone. Just *gone.* 

We searched the entire rec center Southtowne Lanes and foudn that no less than 12 soldiers were missing. We found one (1) soldier that had been placed to guard the rec center, and he was unconscious in his post facing the rear entrance. He doesn't remember anything.

We put our intel team to work at once. At about 0:19 we had discovered that our troops were alive. Captured and being held hostage. After a lengthy, tedious negotiation, I convinced them to hand over our POW's in exchange for a promise to not decimate their entire organization. NBD, nbd. Troops should be in hand tomorrow.

The rec center will be guarded again ASAP, but currently remains with only Private Johnson guarding the rear entrance and Private Ryan guarding lanes 1 and 2, and we are recommending you keep an eye out for hostiles if visiting the rec center until reinforcements are in place. Now that their positions have been compromised, we are going to have to position them much more carefully in very covert, isolated areas, but I assure you, the rec center **will* be under Green Dawn protection again.

Being an operator in Sectors 1-718 and 1-212, I've come to the realization that large population areas would require a more coordinated effort between members of Operation Green Dawn to better conquer territory and secure objectives, particularly landmarks. Therefore, I will be engaging in OPERATION BIG APPLE within my sectors. Any other members in these sectors I hope will coordinate their efforts within the Joint Task Force, as well as those in other cities to make an effort for theirs. 

Hopefully, the Task Force can use this thread as means of communication. My troops have arrived today and shall begin deployment asap. I hope I have fellow men and women who can work to complete OBA.

Some of the posts I've seen lately would be much better off if they were done on a street corner or at the shopping mall and left there rather than setup on the kitchen table and dismantled. 

Keep some army men in your car so they're always ready when the opportunity presents itself. Don't have a car? How about a bag or purse or backpack? The easiest way to place your troops is to always have some at your disposal and if they're always with you then there's no excuses. 

Get out into your city and make it Green! This is the perfect time of year to do it so what's holding you back? There'll always be a place for a humorous post but most of them can keep their humour while still following orders from superiors...

November Oscar Golf reporting from Sector 1-512. My troops have been in reserve until a recent rash of hostile activity on our immediate borders. The trouble began when enemy spies dressed as carpenters were working on the roof and severed our comm link to Green Dawn. As a result I mustered the troops in order to secure our perimeter. Our base lies on a busy road, frequented by vehicles and pedestrians alike, so I've deployed recon units to gather intel. My advance scouts have taken up position on a bridge to the West of our base, and have reported sighting enemy armor, which explains all the noise. My primary objective as of now is to fully secure the bridge, and if possible to have my scouts reach the enemy armor units South of the bridge.

1358099655.0	16hznh	Tips on Troop Placement		24	5	7	"Okay, so we all support the great cause here, but are you doing everything you can to support it? Do you frequently notice that you troops go missing? Or perhaps you can't find suitable places for your troops? If so, I'm here to help you with this tips and tricks.

**1: SCOUT YOUR LOCATION**

This is the mot important tip, but you'd be surprised at how many soldiers ignore this rule. Before placing your troop, you should survey the location, and think about it. Does it offer a good view of the enemy? Is it concealed well? Do people pass by it a lot? Can you access it easily? These are all questions you should ask before placing a troop.

**2: USE CAMOUFLAGE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE**

This is another important rule that is easily ignored. Choose your men wisely. Greens do well in forest or jungle conditions. Yellows do well in the desert or beach environment. Greys do well in urban locations. This isn't all to consider. Camouflage can be attributed to location as well. Placing a troop against a wall means it has a better chance of survival compared to open ground. Corners help, because only 90 degrees of the troop is exposed. Dark corners are even better, because as we know, it's harder to see things in in the dark.

**3: SPREAD YOUR TROOPS OUT REASONABLY**

This is one of the least common mistakes, but one of the most catastrophic ones. It is imperative that you place your troops together reasonably. Concentrated troop masses can be a real threat. If you place troops together, just one discovered troop can jeopardise the whole squad. If a troop is found, the enemy will be suspicious at first, and may look around for a short while. This can cause the enemy to notice things they normally wouldn't, and search vigorously in places they normally wouldn't. Normally, searches will be conducted around the immediate area where the troop is found. Troops far away from the action probably won't be spotted by the enemy. But if they are too far away, your forces can be spread thin, and it becomes impossible to track their statuses.

**4: MARK YOUR TROOPS**

Tisis one more closely followed rule, but there are still some soldiers out their that neglect the importance of insignias are markings. Markings allow fellow soldiers in the field to identify fellow troops. It helps stop cases of friendly fire, and allows, god forbid, fellow allies to identify killed troops. At the very least, you should put /r/greendawn on the base of your men. Personally, I prefer to carve mine in with knives, because the sharpie marks can wash/rub off sometimes. Besides, chicks dig scars. The carving will toughen your men up, and give them a real taste of the stress combat can cause.

I'll add any more tips if soldiers put them in e comments."	t5_2v4g8	True

Soldiers of the Green Dawn, what good is having a war if there is no enemy to fight? We all know who the real enemy of the Green is the Tan. If an army were created in opposition to the Green Dawn, maybe call it the Tan Dusk, there could be a total global war. Think of the possibilities! Custodial staff would only be a minor nuisance compared to hunting down enemy posts in your sector, using intel gathered through espionage on the opposing subreddit. Say you find an enemy, you capture him, and replace him with your own. Prisoner exchanges could be arranged. Battles could be fought! 

Really just curious about feedback on this idea. I'd go ahead and do it, but I'm still a newbie. Well that and I'm enlisted in the Green Dawn already.

P.S. A rule came to me as I was writing this; so we don't have a fight of 'I take yours then you take mine', a soldier can not be captured if he is covered by another soldier. Defender must provide photo evidence of this cover (and maybe mark him with a ""C"".) For the covered soldier to captured the soldier covering him must be taken first.

1357664692.0	166wei	Another injured soldier...		18	4	1	"Today, at 1430 hours, I found one of my injured men In England, Sector 028. Recently, a considerable size of my force, around 15 men out of 50, have gone missing. This men have all been presumed KIA, but the truth is far more sinister.

I found one of my men gravely injured on a desktop. Upon examination, he was unresponsive and unconscious. Three of my men were pinned down, and could not exercise an evac because they didn't have fire superiority. Eventually, external help came, and the injured troop was evacuated via call sign dustoff.

The medics did their best, but needed to get him back to HQ. The return trip took 2 hours, but as soon as he was through the doors, he was rushed to surgery.

Quickly, he underwent specialist surgery, and plastic limbs were attached, and the open wound closed via causation. The surgery left him looking worse for wear, but it looks like he may walk again, at least.
The causation left large scars and marks across his body, but he is alive for now. His condition is critical, but consistant. I will post a visual update in a few minutes, once the all clear is given.

But onto more pressing matters. The soldiers, once presumed MIA, but now declared KIA could have received a similar treatment. It appears that he was sliced in half quickly and with great force. Perhaps this could be the work of an explosive, but only one large body fragment was found, and his body was strewn apart in an unnatural position. His legs were flung halfway across the room.

It appears we are dealing with a ruthless and savage enemy, that has no qualms about capturing and torturing our men. This is clearly defined, under NATO law, as a war crime. Swift and immediate justice will be conducted. We will find those responsible, and we will kill him.

In the meantime, I face a dilemma; should I abandon patrols in the area? My men are at terrible risk, and even the most concealed men fell prey to this terrible and unkown warlord. I feel as if a total evacuation is in order. Or do I press foward, and deploy the commandos to find this monster and kill him? If we want justice, we have to take this risk. The men are all for it, fearless as ever, but I still am reps oils for them, and must make a rational and level headed desicions.

What are your opinions, over?

**DECRYPT SUCCESS!**

**TRANSMISSION START**

Apologies from CWO Charlie Sierra. The encryption of the report was necessary as a top level of secrecy is needed to conceal the sensitive information from prying eyes. After the transmission is finished, copy the file and encrypt it again with standard military protocols. Afterwards, destroy the original with interaction. Leave no trace of evidence.

Also, apologies for the incorrect group naming system in the previous post. I previously stated that there were two companies. This is incorrect. In reality, there is one platoon (Alpha) consisting of four twelve man teams, (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta) To recap, the previous teams, Alpha and Bravo, set up a FOB and secured the foward perimeter.

At 1000 hours this morning, Operation Hemingway was launched. The main objective of this mission was to secure a safe passage to the design and technology block for an infiltration team, provide intel on the block, establish a rear guard for FOB Alpha, Provide intel on the whereabouts of the three MIA soldiers (An increase from just the one last report), and station a fireteam at waypoint Alpha (the main road outside).

At 1000 hours, Operation Hemmingway begun. One missing soldier (Codename Coyote) from the Alpha team needed to be located. I posted three men in even more concealed positions around Coyote's old post. If any evidence is found, even the smallest trace, the men had orders to notify me.

At 1240 hours, the operation was out into full swing. Multiple fireteams were placed to the rear of FOB alpha. A specialist suvalist team was placed between the post of MIA soldier codename Gunslinger and the post of MIA soldier codename Lincon. As of yet, I have not received word of any leads.

By 1630 hours, a safe passage for the infiltration team had been secured, and a stable rear guard for FOB alpha had been achieved. All that remained was to position a fireteam along the main road. By 1645 hours, a fireteam had established a recon link on the main road. Hopefully, this new development will prevent father soldiers from going MIA.

Tomorrow, Operation Dawnbreakwill commence, and an elite infiltration team will make their way into the main design and technology block. From there, they will spread out in the most secure areas, and provide any intel on the enemy, and the whereabouts of the three MIA soldiers.

List of casualties:

Codename Gunslier, MIA, presumed KIA in 48 hours.

Codename Coyote, MIA, presumed KIA in 72 hours.

Codename Lincon, MIA, presumed KIA in 72 hours.

Codename Wolfenstein, sprained feet and hips, administered painkillers and declared fit for duty.

Men deployed: 48

**TRANSMISSION START**

At 0830 hours the mission officially started, although some prior planning was conducted. I made my way into the main reception with twelve men split into two teams, Alpha and Bravo. In the main reception, the first part of the plan was put into action. Team alpha was strategically inserted into position, and constructed a small foward operating base.

At 1500 hours, the foward operating base was complete, and the immediate area secure. Two scouts from team bravo took this as their cue, and attempted to tap into the server network connection via cable. However, one soldier fell down on the cable, knocking out any hope of inter and intra net surveillance. An immediate and risky extraction was conducted, and the scout was retrieved minus injuries. Although electronically IT surveillance was now put of the question. I reassigned the scouts to a more concealed, low-down position and requested that they provide any IT related visuals to me. In the future, more rigarous risk assessments will have to be made.

At 1530 hours, the remaining four members of team bravo looked to secure a 25 meter premier around the foward operating base. Moving into positions in the trees, the rest of bravo successfully camouflaged themselevs and took concealedvpositions. Any suspicious activity is to be reported to me directly, and the soldiers may only engage in fire only if fired upon, as we don't have enough intel on the enemy yet. Currently, it is unknown if they are aware of our presence even.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, photographic intelligence is not available as of yet.

In summary, the mission went well with only a minor mishap. An urban forward observation base has been constructed, a secure woodland premeter established, and visual IT intel is being relayed back to me in real time. As of current, the 12 men deployed are active.

For my next target, I am looking to establish a rocket firebase in the local woodland area. A fireteam would prove effective in taking out large groups of enemies, and will raise morale amount the local men.

Charlie Sierra, over and out.

Alright soldiers. You may or may not have heard that reddit's Best Of 2012 is a little bit different this year. I can tell you this much: we will be having categories for Best Of specifically in this sub. Winners will **most likely** receive reddit gold. I can't tell you what all of the categories are, but I can tell you that one will be Best Post and one will be for Best Comment. Another will **probably** be Best Poster which will go to the officer who has had consistent posting with consistent quality, as opposed to the Best Post award which will go to specifically the most awesome post. Along with reddit gold, you will be assigned a medal in your flair, a badge you will wear to show the honor in your dedication to the cause.

You might be thinking, ""why is he telling us this now if things may be subject to change?"" I'll tell you why. 

As you all know, this ~~subreddit~~ movement is very new. We haven't been around all year. Our ""Best Of 2012"" is going to be the ""Best Of the last three months."" That being said, we've had a lot of great posts in the last two months, but there is still almost a whole month left to get posts in. This is going to make our Best Of a bit different than other subs. So get out there and keep up the good work. Most importantly, have fun. That's what this revolution is all about.

Well, that and global domination.

**TRANSMISSION START**

At 0800 hours a member of the Charlie team took up posts on the local bus stop. His mission is to relay any incoming enemy transport activity, and give a heads up to the main teams. This way, the FOB has time to prepare their defences.

At 0830 hours, a member of Delta team was posted in the toilets. This would gives us an idea of the level of healthiness in the enemy camps, and their hygiene levels. A poor hygiene level could save room for exploitation.

From 0830 hours to 1050 hours, the remaining five members of Delta company were posted in the FOB, along with the obviously referenced Alpha and Bravo squad. These vanguards will allow for a better defensive capabilities. The FLB now looks to be 100% secure. At 1100 hours, four of the five members of Charlie team were posted outside the design block. Their mission is to provide overwatch and intel for the upcoming invasion tomorrow.

At 1100 hours, the last member of Chalrie team was posted in the design block. Initially, his position was thought to be concealed, but not well defendable. Because he was only conducting recon, this was thought not to be a problem.

At 1145 hours, disaster struck. On the way out from the design block, it was noticed that code name Gunslinger was not in his designated post. Constant attempts to establish radio contact have failed, and the information that Gunslinger has gone MIA was posted to the four squads that consisted of the newly designated alpha company. Due to the nature of the mission, a search and rescue can only be conducted tomorrow at 0730 hours from the earliest.

It is unlikely, but possible that Gunslinger is alive. If one of the kids got a hold of him, he is most certainly KIA. If a teacher got hold of him, then he is most certainly a POW, with no chance of him being retrieved in the foreseeable future. However, if capture by a teacher, then he may be treated well, assuming that they don't bin him.

It saddens me that I chose such a poor position for Gunslinger, and although war does have its casualties, that doesn't make it any easier to send young men to their deaths. A formal inquiry will be held, and his family in fort freedom will be notified.

If any of you see Gunslinger in your local place of study, alive or (hopefully not) dead, could they please update the situation ASAP. He can be identified by the engraved /r/greendawn marking in his base, he green colour, his crouching stance and his sniper rifle. He is most likely indoors somewhere in a design and technology block, and if not, immediately outside the block. 

If he isn't found within 72 hours, a funeral will be held in his name with full state honours. At this point in time, I. Contemplating resigning from my position. It isn't easy losing a college, lent only a friend and family member. I can only imagine what his friends and family are going through at this point, all due to my poor desicions. In war, there will always be causalities, but everything must be done to ensure tha they are kept to a minimum.

On the bright side, I have at 24 men deployed. Unfortunately, only 23 are active.

This is Chalrie Sierra over and out rather mournfully."	t5_2v4g8	True
