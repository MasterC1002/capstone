So yesterday I was going to make just regular old burgers when I got an amazing idea! In fact, I might start creating new burgers weekly! I present...

The ""Bleu Man Group"" Burger
(Stuffed with bleu cheese)
5.95

* Get some hamburger meat.
* Throw it in a bowl.
* Throw in some Worcestershire Sauce.
* Throw in some Soy Sauce. Just a little bit.
* Throw in your favorite steak rub.
* Get your fingers in that cow flesh and massage, baby!
* (I also felt crazy and put in a little hot sauce and BBQ sauce)
* Make your patties.
* Cut them in half.
* Put a big clump of Bleu Cheese in the middle.
* Close that pattie up.
* Seal the deal by sentencing those patties to burn, you arsonist!
* Cook for your desired length! (Rare like Rambo!)
* And enjoy! (Like you had a choice...)

1355882005.0	153280	How I decided to introduce some friends to Bob's Burgers	FacetiousBeard	41	1	7	"Not to long ago, a friend of mine hosted an [Edible Cinema](http://www.ediblecinema.co.uk/) style party, where you show a film and, at regular intervals, introduce food related to activities on-screen (It may be what the characters are eating or drinking or that the foods relate to dialogue for example) as a way to further enjoy a film. A few days later, whilst watching Bob's Burgers, I concluded that something similar could be done with the show. I thought that you could show five episodes and, on the odd numbered episodes, give everyone one of the 'Burgers of the day' from that episode. I thought people on here might be interested so I thought I'd show a few pictures of what I did.

There were only the five of us for the evening, and none of them had seen more then a couple of episodes, which turned out to be quite a manageable number. Here's the order of the episodes, picked from my favourites, and burgers, all of which were home-made, I picked;

1. S1E1 - Human Flesh. The accompanying burger was, of course, [The Child Molester](http://imgur.com/cFxyq), a [minted lamb burger](http://imgur.com/vOSUf) (The top row) served with candy.

2. S2E2 - Bob Day Afternoon.

3. S2E4 - Burgerboss. The accompanying burger was [Papaya Was A Rolling Stone](http://imgur.com/dY6gm), a [spicy beef burger](http://imgur.com/Z4SMp) served with a [Papaya salsa](http://imgur.com/KTS6R).

4. S3E6 - The Deepening. 

5. S3E2 - Full Bars. The accompanying burger was [The Jack-O-Lentil](http://imgur.com/b7WAj), a [beef and lentil burger](http://imgur.com/vOSUf) (The bottom five burgers).

All of the burgers were really simple to make, I had never made burgers prior to the evening, and were recipes cobbled together from various sources on the internet (Though I must thank the people responsible for [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9gs_ESjGtM) video as I had never eaten papaya before, let alone cut one properly). All of the burgers were served with store bought wedges and onion rings, and none were served with any cheese on them, and the buns were store bought too. Everyone enjoyed the burgers, even if one or two were not overly blown away by the show.

I am certain that I will do something like this again in the future, may be with friends of mine who are fans of the show and we can turn up in costumes and the like, so I would greatly appreciate tips and ideas of how to go about improving on this idea."	t5_2s9k9	True

*Ketchup in the Rye (Ruben sandwich sliders)*

*100 Deers of Solid Food (venison chili)*

*The Ground and the Curry (crockpot beef curry)*

*A Mini-Bleu Feast (turkey bleu cheese cranberry sliders)*

*A Confederacy of Lunches (paper bag lunches including half a sandwich, fruit cup, and cookie)*

*Smothering Bites (triple chocolate candy truffles with butter)*

*A Pitcher of Dorian Earl Grey Tea (early grey tea)*

*The BFG (big fucking garden-salad)*

*Wings Fall Apart (crockpot pulled wing meat)*

*The Caramelized Onions of Naan-ia (caramelized onions and naan bread)*

*Lard of the Fries (poutine)*

*One Brew Over The Cuckoo's Chest (beer-battered chicken)*



Feel free to steal any of these. But what I'd really like are some other suggestions! Or point me somewhere that could. These are good but I thought of them within ten minutes and I know there are some great minds on here who could do better! Thanks.

1350000229.0	11c791	A big (overdue) thanks to the team that runs the Bob's Burgers blog! (story inside)	gill_outean	43	4	0	"Back in June, I was planning for my girlfriend's birthday present, to be delivered in early August. We had been perusing the Bob's Burgers blog together a few weeks before and she had gone crazy over the [character silhouette t-shirts](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m61hj5hW4Q1r7e0mc.jpg) that the site was giving away for a contest. 

I emailed the site operators and asked if they'd be interested in selling me a couple of the shirts. They replied (quite quickly, I might add) that the shirts are for the contest exclusively, and it'd be unfair to other fans to sell me the shirts. I responded, asking if I could buy directly from their supplier. 

Well, imagine my absolute delight when they replied with a compromise: if I would make a $25 donation to a charity of my choice and give them proof, they'd send me a few shirts for free! I promptly made a donation to the [Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada](http://www.llscanada.org/) and a few weeks later, I was able to give my girlfriend two t-shirts - Louise and Linda! She was tickled pink.

And, to top it off, they also sent a Bob t-shirt for me! I loved this show before all of this t-shirt business, but now I freaking adore the people behind it. Just a happy little story to share with my fellow Bob-lovin' brethren :)

The managers of the page kicked both of the admins that were trying to stop the spam and they banned me from posting on their things.
The two admins and I (I was never an admin on ILBB, but I was really trying hard to help stop the spam, because the last thing Bob's Burgers needs is a fan page run by fat cats) started our own BB page, my friend refers to it as I Love Bob's Burger's' replacement. If you would be so kind as to like the page, I would really appreciate it. If not, I understand completely and respect your decision.

It's not at all like BB's, but it's still very funny and original: the two reasons why many of us got into BB in the first place.

For a range, I'm a pretty huge fan of Archer, American Dad, and apparently the only person that enjoyed the Cleveland Show. I didn't enjoy Drawn Together or Brickleberry, and I only watch Family Guy and South Park out of some twisted masochistic loyalty to the time I've already wasted on them.

Frostrich	14	0	17	"For those of you who don't know, a power hour is a drinking game in which a shot of beer is taken every minute over the course of an hour, usually to the switching of a song or video clip. I'm a huge fan of video power hours. Love the ones out there for ""The office"" ""The Simpsons"" ""Always Sunny"" and the many more I've come across. I would love to make one for Bob's Burgers. I'm working my way through the episodes that have aired to find the best clips that are close to 60 seconds long, and this subreddit has already aided me in my search. 

What I'm asking of you is, what is one of your favorite parts that are close to a minute? If you could include episode season/episode number that would be wonderful!

Also, this power hour needs that one special word or phrase or audio clip that a character says/sound they make that sums up Bob's burgers, that gets played at the end of each 60 second interval. I would love input on this as well.

**Edit:** Thanks for all your suggestions so far! I'm piecing some of them together between bouts of work. Among a few others I just added-

Gene as Bob scene *""Too many Bob's In the Kitchen""*

Your the One! Turkey scene *""An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal""*

Tina Hits Parked Car *""Tina Rannosaurus Wrecks""*


Working on some of your other suggestions! And of course I plan to make this available to all those who enjoy this show, and beer."	t5_2s9k9	True

episode two she tries to throw the cell phone back into the girl's (whom she stole it) car, time slows down, she misses.

episode 12 she tries to push Tammy under Zeke as he poops from high above in the rafters of the auditorium, time slows down, she misses.

1352128815.0	12o47o	Maybe I'm asking too much here...	thepezzyone	2	2	0	... but every week after a new episode airs, people post links with a quote from the newest episode.  Since I can only watch on Hulu, I see everything just a day late so it's kind of spoiling some of the funny stuff.

1368105614.0	1dzz11	So what's the appeal of bob's burgers if the bad guy wins, Bob's family mocks him and refuses to support him?	jabberworx	4	5	3	"Just finished watching Season 3 ep 19.

What exactly is the appeal here? That bob despite his competence has a family that seems to hate him and side with the other guy who cheated them out of a minivan which his family really wanted? Suddenly Louise went from threats about anal rape with a banana to ""that's mean""?

The whole Bob is down on his luck idea is getting really long in the tooth and for some reason the shows writers have decided to just keep stretching that to even more implausibly stupid and depressing limits. It doesn't make the show good, it just makes its concept warn out, I don't want to watch a show week in week out where the bad guy wins hands down then the protagonist is kicked in the proverbial balls by his family which not 30 seconds ago was completely on his side.

That just makes me hate his family and hate him for being a wimp, there is no redemption here, I know people will try to reply with the good old 'but this is why the show is so good! you expect a satisfying ending but aren't given one!', yeah I get it, I also expected a good show but didn't get one, so I guess it's a bit too edgy for me. Bob doesn't have to win, but he also doesn't have to be completely and utterly brutalized at the end either.
