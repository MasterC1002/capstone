1366789939.0	1czxq2	"can a landlord give 30 day notice to vacate, ""just because""?"	sifron	31	4	20	"I am at an impasse with my landlord. I have been renting a ground level suite on a 1 year lease, which is about to become a month-to-month lease. She insists that she can now give me 30 day notice to vacate without any reason (such as late payment or excessive damage, etc). 

From what I've read online and in the BC Tenancy Act, a landlord must have CAUSE to evict a resident. It does not specify if this applies to both term leases and month-to-month leases.  

She wants to add ""landlord has right to give 30 day notice to vacate"" on the new lease, and I don't want to sign a contract that I believe to be 'illegal' and non enforceable. 

I'm looking for local common knowledge and personal experiences with this issue. I've only been living in BC for a year so I'm not sure if this is normal or totally wrong. 

Thanks for your help guys!

edit: I dug my heels in after getting confirmation from everyone that this is incorrect, and she decided to give up on the issue. Thanks everyone!"	t5_2qnc6	True

1368603701.0	1eddmo	We need to start talking about a Proportional Representation system.	Iblueddit	40	20	75	"I just looked at what the legislative assembly would look like with proportional representation (the popular vote % for each party determines the % of seats for that party) instead of first past the post. 

38 seats for the Liberals
34 for NDP,
7 for the Greens
4 for the Conservatives
2 for the Independents.

This means no one gets a majority, which would result in a coalition government, but more importantly shows how inaccurate the FPP system is in reflecting what the electorate actually looks like. One can pretty safely assume the Conservatives would join with the Liberals, and the Greens with the NDP. This makes:

Liberal/Conservative coalition: 42 (1 short of majority)
NDP/Green coalition: 41 (2 short of a majority)
Independent: 2

This election would literally come down to which side the independents join. First of all, how much more exciting is that? Secondly, the FPP system is pretty clearly a poor system. Why is it that 8% of people vote green, and then only get 1 seat (1.1% of seats) in Victoria? Why is it that the 44%, a minority of people, that voted Liberal get 59% of the seats and now make all the decisions for the next 4 years? This seems unfair to 58% (a majority) of people that didn't want a Liberal government. Just sayin'.

EDIT:

Just so everyone's clear, you can find the BC-STV system here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC-STV

I would propose a less complicated, but similar system. This alternative would be the following:

Each district has 10 seats in it (for this example), like the BC-STV. However, the seats are not determined by ranking the candidates that you want.

Instead, when the voter goes to the booth the ballot is presented to him with which party he/she wants to vote for across the top of the ballot. You simply check the box for which party you want to win the election.

Beneath each party would be an optional section where, should you choose, you can vote for a candidate you want to have a seat. The party will have chosen people for that riding already, and you get to vote for which one you want to have a seat. The ballot would like as follows, where the # below represents a persons name. The X where this individual voted.


Liberal [X] | NDP [ ] | Green [ ] | Conservative [ ] 
              |            |              |
#1 [ ]      |#1 [ ]    |#1 [ ]      |#1 [ ]
#2 [ ]      |#2 [ ]    |#2 [ ]      |#2 [ ]
#3 [X]      |#3 [ ]    |#3 [ ]      |#3 [ ]
#4 [ ]      |#4 [ ]    |#4 [ ]      |#4 [ ]
#5 [ ]      |#5 [ ]    |#5 [ ]      |#5 [ ]
#6 [ ]      |#6 [ ]    |#6 [ ]      |#6 [ ]


The first thing counted would be the number of votes for each party. These would be tallied and then put into % for each party.

So hypothetically:

42% Liberal
38% NDP
10% Green
10% Conservative

This would directly determine the % of seats for each party. SO;

4 seats for Liberals
4 for the NDP
1 for Green
1 for Conservative

OK, great, now to determine the candidates that take each seat for each party. We'll use the Liberals as an example.

Liberals fielded 6 candidates. The first person to get a seat is the Liberal candidate who received the highest amount of votes from the ballots. The second highest gets the next seat, etc. Should there be a tie or no votes for the remaining candidates, the party will have predetermined the order that the candidates get a seat - this is the order that appears on the ballot.

Boom. Just as easy as the FPP system, but with the option to be more specific as to which candidate you want. And is much more accurate as a representation of the electorate.

The more seats you have in a district, the more accurate you can be % of votes --&gt; # of seats for each party. If you want to keep out small extreme parties, all you have to do is adjust the number of seats to set a % a party needs to obtain to get a seat. In this example, with 10 seats in a district, you could need a minimum of 5.01% to get a seat - the number rounds to the nearest 10. Personally, I think 10 works because it allows for diversity without a crippling number of parties."	t5_2qnc6	True

1374158224.0	1ik73l	Driving from South Ontario out to Field, British Columbia!!! [FIXED]	GauchoMoney	18	0	24	"Hey guys,

In less than a week I will be embarking on a road trip with my dog. I will be driving from southern Ontario, across the trans-Canada highway, out to Field, BC. I'm hoping to be able to do the 3700km drive in about three days. 

I was hoping for some advice; suggestions on places to stay along the way, places to avoid. Things to bring that one may overlook. Anything else that could possibly be helpful! 

Also wondering if buying gear here or there would be a better idea? I will be able to make trips to cities around Field, as I'm told its quite a desolate area. 

Thanks for any and all help!!! 

[EDIT] Thanks for all the input guys, I will give myself 5-6 days now, and will keep other suggestions in mind! THANKS!"	t5_2qnc6	True

I am meeting a friend with all the gear the next day in EC Manning Park so I won't have my tent or sleeping bag yet. I'm sure there is a motel or something like that I could stay at in Hope, but I thought it would be more interesting to crash with a local. I am a 26 y/o male from Toronto.

I thought postcards would be a great way to show the students I will be working with how diverse Canada is, even within the provinces.

Edit: Before I go to sleep I'll add in a few things. We have a truck that's capable of going off roading with 4x4 and is equipped with winter tires. We are trying to find scenery kinda stuff, like lakes, mountain ledges, view points and such stuff to take photos and just admire the place. We are also trying not to spend to much money either, between gas and hotel in banff we are getting pretty pricey as it is, so some furgal/free places to visit would be preferred.

While we've taken a look at various regions and their benefits I thought I'd ask my fellow Redditors who actually live in BC what it's like, if it's really worth it for us to move and what region you guys think is best to live in. Both of us have jobs that are easily transferable although part of the biggest reason is that the craft/micro brewing industry is blowing up in BC and that's a sector that I'm really trying to get into. We're both active people who enjoy the outdoors and we're very artistic in various mediums. Any feedback would be great!

My wife and I will be driving from Vancouver to Calgary over three or four days.  Does anyone have any suggestions on a route to take, sites to see, places to stay, or hikes to do?  I know next to nothing about either city or about the route.  All I know is that we definitely want to go through Glacier National Park.  We'll have a tent with us, and ideally will be sleeping under the stars at least two of those nights. Any information, websites, or forums that you can point me in the direction of would be hugely appreciated.  Thanks guys,

*Edit-- Thank you very much for all the comments.  We're going to do it over four nights and five days, which is the max that we can do.  After looking over the comments below (especially krazykoo), here's what we're thinking:

Day 1: Take the 1 through Hope then the 3 to Manning Park we're we'll camp at Lightning Lakes. (2 hours 45 minutes).

Day 2: Continue on the 3 to the 97 through Princeton and Penticton and spend the night in Kelowna (3 hours 38 minutes)

Day 3: From Kelowna take the 97 to Kamloops and then the 5 to Jasper (8 hours 3 minutes).

Day 4: Spend the day in Jasper and drive to Banff in the afternoon on the 93. 

Day 5: Spend the day in Banff, and drive to Calgary on the 1 (1 hour 35 minutes).  

On day 2, would it be better to drive all the way to Kamloops?  We're planning to camp at Lightning Lakes, Jasper, and Banff.  Since I know nothing except what google or reddit tells me, any suggestions on particular places to camp in those areas?  Any particular hikes?

Lately I have had a really bad case of headaches, which are not migraines, I had to go to ER on Thursday night, I had 2 CT Scans on Friday and Tuesday as well. The good news it they didn't find anything big (no tumor or cancer). However the really bad explosive headaches are still there. I have an appointment with the Neurologist until May 23rd, and the only thing it can make feel good right now is this Percozet (Oxycodone 5mg) medicine which is making me really high all the time, making me unable to go to work, or to do anything basically. And if I don't take his, the headaches become so bad I can't do actually anything (they feel like Cluster headaches or maybe a Neuralgia).

Also my CareCard is still in process so some neurologists decided to cancel my appointment because of this, I called my HR  department today and she told me she sent the letter for my CareCard renovation in the middle of march, so they probably lost my documents or something.  HR had faxed the documents today again, so I will probably have it tomorrow because this is considered an emergency.

My question, if you guys know any doctor that might have an open schedule before may 23rd, or any recommendation at all, anything. Because I am getting really anxious/depressed for this constant headache =(.

I currently live in Vancouver, I am a male 27 years old.

Thank you for your attention,

1368493423.0	1ea8aq	Planning on moving to BC next year from Saskatchewan. Major questions about autism services out there for children.	AssNasty	14	3	12	"Hi, my family and I going to be abandoning our home province for greener pastures out west; if you've ever lived through a Sask winter, I'm sure you can guess why. We were lucky enough to have had our 4 year old severely Autistic boy in a specialized ABA preschool (and afterwards ABA kindergarten) where he is receiving 4 hours of therapy a day. It's towards the lower end of the optimal amount of therapy, but there's no other real option in Sask without forking over 70k for private therapy.

Anyway, long story short as of fall 2014 he will be done with the ABA school (funding issues) and we are planning our move to coincide with elementary school next year. Here are my questions:

I read that the MCFS caps autism funding at $22k a year until age 6. After that it's $6000 a year. How expensive (and accessible) are services out there for autistic kids (i.e. speech and occupational therapy)?

Once in the public school system (Probably fall 2014), if he requires an Educational Assistant for one on one learning, would that be available for him? Would it be available for the entirety of his time in school if he needs it?

I will probably post more after (kids need a bath) but if someone who has gone through all of this could share their experiences and knowledge of the systems with me, it'd be incredibly appreciated!

I've heard wonderful things about the Coast and I know some people who regularly visit but I have some specific questions so I'm wondering if someone with a general understanding of the area could help me out.

1. Which towns have decent/any public transport? I don't drive, but I work from home and would use the bus for groceries and to get to the ferry on occasion. Any places that would be impossible or very impractical?

2. I keep seeing these beautiful, cheap cabins and cottages that I guess are being rented out over the winter. What's the catch with these? Moving out in the summer is fine, being totally secluded is not-again, no car.

3. How does the cost of living compare to the lower mainland? I can see rents are much cheaper, but what about food and utilities? I'm primarily concerned with the cost of produce and dry goods.

4. I'd be interested in finding work trimming certain trees, any particularly good towns for that?

Player_Four	8	0	14	"Hey BC, I'm planning to spend two weeks on a motorcycle trip pretty soon in a few weeks, July 14-28. I dont really have a plan right now, I decided I was not going to worry myself too much with an itinerary. However, I do have a couple things I want to do.
 
Ride along the ocean, and go in the ocean. Nice small town somewhere? I'll be trying to camp mostly, either in campgrounds or just wherever i decide to stop.

Go to Whistler, Rent a bike and gear and spend a day or two downhilling or MTB. Advice here on whistler would be greatly appreciated.

Cross over onto Vancouver island and spend a few days maybe?Puttering around. Advice on Vancouver Island again, appreciated.

Thats really all I got. Motorcyclists who have experience driving SASK&gt;BC or even AB&gt;BC, I'd love to hear a good route. I'd enjoy getting off the Trans-Canada.
I don't know how interested I am in Vancouver, I'll probably check it out but I'm not exactly a big city guy.
I wont be carrying much in the way of food or cooking gear, I plan to eat at establishments mostly. Honestly I expect to go to sleep and wake hungry a few times. Thats ok.

So ""when in Rome"", and all, by the time I was halfway between Hope and Chilliwack I gave up and just started going with it. Doing 100 and watching traffic back up behind you while they wait for their turn to blow by you is unnerving.

I didn't end up with any speeding tickets or anything, but it's got me wondering, would a cop actually pull one person out of dozens to give them a speeding ticket?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. What we're hoping for;

- Affordability. We're no rock stars, so average prices, or less than, would be great (Going to be less than 50 people there)

- Scenic. We're hoping for the Rocky Mountains (even AB), or the Kootenays, or the Thomp-OK regions. If it's awesome enough, we will consider the island or somewhere in the South West (populated) end of BC.

- Ideally outside. While inside a small town would be fine, ideally not in a city. Straight up in nature would be pretty awesome. 

- No church required, but we are looking for a place that can maybe do the ceremony and reception in one area/package.

Again, thanks for the advice!

My travels also deliver me to Canada right in time for SHAMBHALA!

This is where reddit comes in! I haven't got a sob story or do I feel that I deserve a ticket more than anyone else, I was simply too late and therefore missed out.

So if any redditors or people you know have a couple of spare tickets (one is for my little brother who will also be travelling with me), let me know now or closer to the date and we can sort something out!

Since real estate in the Lower Mainland is completely fucked (I can think of no better description for it, to be honest), I've decided that I want to take my cash and buy some land somewhere away from the GVRD and build a small cabin in the mountains somewhere.

Requirements:
1. Just be within a 4-6 hour drive of the Lower Mainland.
2. Power is not necessary, but a nice bonus.
3. Must have relatively decent road access (can be unpaved).
4. Must be in the wilderness.

His parents are extremely concerned that since I am uninsured while living here, if I have to go to the hospital for anything, they will stick him with all the financial costs and if he can't pay, then they will go after his parents to pay my bills.

(Crossposted from /r/canada)	specialk45	7	3	14	"I run my web design/graphics business out of my home in BC for a few years now. My insurance company who supplies both my home insurance and business insurance has decided that offering insurance for a home-based business that deals with the US (some of my clients are there) is too risky and just sent me a letter saying they are cancelling ALL my insurance. Not even a phone call—nice touch.

They didn't even offer me a price, just saying they won't insure my home or business anymore.

I find it hard to believe that anyone in Canada doing web-design out of their home can't buy home insurance and proper business insurance.

Can anyone offer advice on this issue? I'm trying to do the legal and correct thing here.

PS - I think the issue revolves largely around the fact that there used to be a large amount of fraud when dealing with websites and credit cards, etc. Still I would have thought you pay a higher premium or something, but could still be insured properly for both the business and the house."	t5_2qnc6	True

BirdzAndBeez	5	1	15	"My husband and I moved from the states this winter and we received provincial health care (which we were required to do after a few months). We are paying a set fee per month for it. We are applying for permanent residency, and have our physical exams coming up.

In the next year, we plan on trying to have a child. So, I guess I'm looking for some guidance on that, specifically. Do I need to have a family doctor to get an OBGYN referral? Am I then stuck with that OBGYN unless I get another referral? Do I have to stick with one doctor/OBGYN, or can I ""shop around,"" and if so, how does one do that without having to have several exams? Can my husband and I have separate family doctors, or is that the whole idea: just one per family? (I think he might be more comfortable seeing a male, while I would be more comfortable seeing a female) Are family doctors like paediatricians as well, or will I have to find one for my child once they are born, or before? How do walk in clinics work and when should I see them instead of my regular family doctor?

I am really confused trying to find a family doctor who accepts patients currently. I have looked into a few, and a lot have one glowing review and one horrible review, so what the hell am I supposed to think? Is there a shortage of doctors? Why are so many not accepting new patients at all? How am I supposed to ensure quality care for my self and family when I can't seem to get even a basic care provider I can trust?

If your too shy to post please pm me, I will not share your information. 

edit: clarifcation

(1)Thank you VERY much for all your comments. I really appreciate them as picking an MBA program is important to me. Recent trinity western MBAers input is extremely appreciated. I am looking at their non profit mba because it would allow me to juggle work and give me a work related employment edge (or at least i have an in on how to leverage it). I ask questions related to religious influence because I don't want to be involved in business theorycrafting that discriminates because they are founded on religious principles. I want to know i can get an objective learning experience of a non profit nature with different inputs and not have my progress be hindered by policy control of information or censorship. 

(2) pre-emptive: i realise i could probably get that specific specilization in other business mbas but i just like to do research on this sort of matter. Obviously if Trinity's Mo conflicts with mine at an extremely fundemntal level (as in my personal principles and code of ethics) i'll move on. This isn't the only channel i'm seeking inputs from, but they are extremely appreciated!

I'll be on my way though to Englishmans Creek park on Lake Koocanusa from Edmonton in a week or so, and would rather not bring 700lbs of water along for the ride if I don't have to.

Does anyone know of any places where I can fill up the fresh water tank along the Crowsness Pass?  I'll be coming in through Sparwood to Fernie to Elko.

He lives outside North America now and only comes back to the States for one month out of the year- July.

Since we don't currently have jobs in BC, we're concentrating our housing search to Maple Ridge/Pitt Meadows, and the Tricities of Coquitlam/Port Coquitlam/Port Moody, and these towns are more affordable than Vancouver (we prefer small communities anyway) and  would shorten the commute if we get jobs farther south in the Abbotsford area.

I'd like to hear your recommendations/warnings on neighbourhoods in these areas. We are a professional couple in our mid-50's; don't mind diverse communities, families with kids, etc. Mainly trying to avoid gang/drug/high crime neighbourhoods.

My friend who is trying to get her work permit has tried doing all the normal routes to permission using online resources, etc. but is stuck.

My name is Patrick, and I'm a bit of a Twilight character. When I saw the Kelowna brony group meeting up in a... less than desirable manner, I set out to organise, plan and make lists. The previous admins have done a fine job making BUCK (Bronies Under the Care of Kelowna) into what it is, but have made some choices I found a bit frustrating; lack of publicity, awkward dates/times for meetups, and a focus on just Kelowna. I offer to you, a bit of a rebirth;

On August the Twelfth, a Sunday following this weekend, we will be holding a meetup for both Kelowna and all surrounding areas. It starts at 1:00 PM, at Parkinson Recreation Centre, and goes until people feel it's done. This is just the first meetup, focusing on the people aspect of the community; we won't be up to anything more exciting than meeting fellow fans and bronies. I'm pretty excited all the same.

Please bring a blanket or a lawn chair, if you plan to attend. We're meeting outside, and I have found no way of providing proper seating for everyone. Hopefully, enough people will be able to bring *some* kind of surface, that we can have everyone sitting on something that isn't grass. Blankets would be best, seeing as they're small and can seat 2-4 people, but lawn chairs are more than welcome.

I have the highest hopes for this meetup, and the ones to follow.

Hello again- here's another in a continuing (2 so far) series of requests for input to help us settle in BC. We're moving up from California at the end of August, and will be in the Lower Mainland at the end of July looking for housing. Since we don't currently have jobs in BC, we're concentrating our housing search to Maple Ridge/Pitt Meadows, and the Tricities of Coquitlam/Port Coquitlam/Port Moody, and these towns are more affordable than Vancouver (we prefer small communities anyway) and would shorten the commute if we get jobs farther south in the Abbotsford area.
I'd like to hear your recommendations/warnings on neighbourhoods in these areas. We are a professional couple in our mid-50's; don't mind diverse communities, families with kids, etc. Mainly trying to avoid gang/drug/high crime neighbourhoods.
I'm aware that the area south of Haney mall in Maple Ridge has had problems with drugs and crime, and I've noticed some nice looking houses in the Albion area, but that's about the extent of my knowledge.
Thanks in advance for your help!
(I may post on other areas, depending how our search goes- other ""Newbie to BC"" topics sure to come in the future!)

A.) Take advantage of the lowered drinking age

B.) See some beautiful Canadian wilderness.

So for a few questions: 

1.) We'll obviously need passports, any further ID besides drivers' licenses?

2.) I've heard a rumor that some establishments won't sell to American's under 21. Do any of you have recommendations on bars, etc?

3.) First night we'll probably grab a cheap motel and walk around since we plan to consume alcohol. How safe is Vancouver at night?

4.) Is it likely that we'll encounter snow or ice en route to or around Vancouver? Oregon DOT has a trip check website with snow reports. Is there a BC equivalent?

5.) Any obvious things I may not be considering? Currency exchange? Etc?

6.) Finally, what would you consider to be the must-see locations in the Vancouver area? Planning on driving to a few, but I wouldn't be opposed to a short hike. :)

1369894213.0	1fblp5	Advice for a renter with a cat	missnaughtypuss	3	3	14	My situation is this: I moved into a house with the girl that owned the house. She had never rented a room in her house before and I had never rented a room before, nor did we know each other prior to moving in. We never signed anything and basically took care of everything verbally and through trust.  I paid her a damage deposit when I moved in, but not a pet deposit as she said she didn't think we needed one since I only had a cat and she had several cats and dogs. I've been here for just over 3 years and things have been fine, but now that I am moving out we have some things we don't see eye to eye on. So my cat has scratched a small area of carpet, it's basically the strip of carpet under my bedroom door that he can fit his paw underneath. The carpet is a bit frayed and worn now in that spot, but it isn't worn right down or anything. Aside from this my cat sits on this one very large window sill that is white, I've cleaned it but it would need a coat of paint to make it look like it did when I moved in and finally my cat has scratched the front door so there are some very shallow marks on the lower part of the painted door. She thinks the damage deposit should cover the sill and door to be repainted and to replace the strip of carpet. I think some of this might be considered regular wear and tear rather than neglect, but I don't want to screw her over in any way so I would like some opinions from people who have rented or been landlords.

The party, which opposes the pipeline, sits at 40 per cent in the polls, ahead of the Liberals at 31 per cent.

&gt;The Liberals took the last election by neutralizing the NDP; in implementing a carbon tax, they earned the support even of Greens like David Suzuki. This time around, the NDP, which is already putting out slick, direct mailers pairing images of rusty, hulking tankers with pristine coastline, is making sure the Green vote remains with New Democrats.

&gt;Two days later, on CBC’s The House, Clark deviated from her carefully neutral Northern Gateway path, attacking the project’s critics as “foreign groups, coming in and meddling in our politics.”

Madam Premier, are you insinuating that the BC NDP is financed by ""foreign groups that are meddling in our politics?""

If so, can you please provide proof of such an assertion, and to be fair, can you please open the books for all Liberal donations so we can be sure the Liberal Party of B.C. is not taking from ""foreign groups that are meddling in our politics"" as well.

Further, I challenge your assertion. I, [as a British Columbian](http://i.imgur.com/wsQHc.jpg), [have donated $150](http://i.imgur.com/V9bEG.jpg) to the [BC NDP](http://i.imgur.com/Ry9u3.jpg) so they can defeat you next election.
