1353206120.0	13dpwx	Some problems that need to be fixed in order to keep this game alive.	TheChrono	89	36	104	"I have been a long time halo player for years, usually on the competitive side. I really like this game, it feels like a halo game, when I join regular games with my buddies, I can start with a DMR. When I play with my more serious friends, I get slayer pro (I'm assuming MLG is working on a playlist).

I’ll put *’s next to the biggest issues that need to prioritized first.

Generics:

* *When a game is created and starts, the teams need to be even. Period. I can't even play CTF if I don't have a team of 5 because the game will end up being a 4v5 for the ENTIRE GAME. I just played one where the other team won simply because they had one more team mate for the entire game. Sometimes when I am playing a 4v5, I’ll spend my in game time to find a friend to come fill the spot. When I do find one, they can’t even join the game, they sit in the lobby as if our game is full.

* Medals really need to be cleaned up, they are a joke right now, you get a MEDAL for a generic kill. I shouldn’t be spawning, getting one kill, and seeing 4 medals pop up on my screen. It completely takes away the actual reward for doing something great. In the postgame top medals section, the medals need to be sorted, right now my rampages are being hidden by my generic kills and my overkills are being covered up by my headshots.

* Armor Unlocks: The Stars are all backwards, a star pops up when a new piece of armor is revealed, not when you actually unlock one. I randomly get pieces of armor but I don’t know why or when since the only time stars pop up is when they are revealed.

* Spartan ID: When it says New ID’s unlocked, you scroll through them to see what you unlocked, this doesn’t mean you want to change your current emblem, so if you press B it should go back to what it was, right now it just goes to whatever you left it on.

* Boltshot: This secondary weapon that people spawn with should not be a one shot kill, one shot plus melee, I’m fine with but it’s too powerful.

* *There needs to be a ranking system ASAP, I know it’s coming soon but it needs to be SOON, this is what killed Reach for a lot of players and what kept people around for YEARS on Halo 2 and Halo 3.

Game Modes:

Regicide: Let people play real FFA, I don’t want 5 people running at me and team shooting me the entire game just because I have a crown above my head. (FFA was added for a very short while then removed, I'd assume it's coming soon)

* *CTF: One HUGE problem is not being able to drop the flag. It's a huge problem and has been game ruining(single game) for me. I understand not wanting people to struggle picking up the flag in those close situations with vehicles/weapons on the ground. You might not want people to juggle/pass the flag, but there's other ways to prevent that and not allowing flag drops is a huge flaw in the gametype.

* *CTF: Another huge problem with CTF is that you are rewarded for suiciding your way across the map, returning the flag is very hard to due since it's a 30 second return time. It should be at MOST 15-20 seconds if not standing on it for 5 seconds should return it (yes even in casual games). Maps like complex make suiciding for a flag a viable strategy, especially since you don't even have to hold X to pick it up, it just automatically goes into your hands.

* *Oddball: The maps are extremely unbalanced, the ball isn’t even placed in the middle of both teams, ontop of that, on complex for example, someone who spawns on the upper side gets a huge advantage of not only being closer to the ball, but having time to setup and sit back and shoot while someone else can go and grab the ball and just throw it back if they are about to die.

* *Slayer Pro: It’s the closest thing you have to competitive matchmaking right now. There's no excuse to have instant respawns and assault rifles involved. I don’t think instant respawns should be ANYWHERE in this game, but if that’s not an option, at least take them out of this.

* Oddball, KoTH, CTF need to be in one playlist, Team Objective used to be one of the most solid playlists.

* Big Team Slayer should just be Big Team Battle and include CTF and maybe some other gametypes, but mainly CTF.

* There really isn’t a solid playlist yet (the most consistent being Flood), all of them have flaws and none are consistently fun. Examples from previous games are Griffball, Team Snipers(NO FUCKING SHOTGUNS), MLG, and a few others.

Like I said, this game has massive potential but there are a few tweaks that in my opinion are necessary.

I will edit as more things come up.

EDIT: Weapons should not despawn so quickly. It's ridiculous how fast they go.

EDIT2: ~~FFA~~ and Team Snipers added, this is good. But with the addition of Team Snipers, radar shouldn't be included. It just doesn't work well with the close range aspects of sniping.

Please go make your own sub called /r/complainingabouthalo4 or something.  Do you realize that your bad attitude contributes to the bad experience you are having?  We should try to keep this sub about gameplay discussion, pwnage stories, questions, etc.  I'm not saying the game is without problems, but we just don't need to keep slamming and beating the dead horse as a community.

This is most likely the work of bots. They're programmed to scour the internet for the format of Double XP codes and automatically redeem them.

There is a way to trick them, though. Give out riddles that only a human can solve. For example:

WML9N Z6B6R

That's a fake code, but it's the right format. Upon posting this, a bot will immediately have scanned that code and attempted to redeem it, leaving absolutely no chance for any of you honest souls to make an attempt. However...

WM( )9N Z6B6( ) (First blank: HA_O; Second blank: First letter of my username.)

Easy riddle, but enough to stop a bot.

I suggest everyone take this into account. Honestly, I'd even recommend making it a sidebar suggestion/rule. It's a simple fix that nobody seems to be using, and it would solve a lot.

Or using prearranged misdirection to call attention to another part of a base, i.e.: anything that starts with ""Hey you guys"" is a lie. My team knows its it, but if the other team hears, ""Hey you guys, I'm crouched in back of base now – going for flag"" they'd fall for it every time.

Honestly it seems to me that these guys just want to play another version of Halo 3. Personally I think 343 did a pretty good job with H4, the weapon drops make it so the pro players don't just camp the power weapons and it balances the game. They're constantly tweaking and trying to improve the multiplayer experiences for everyone who plays H4 not just the pro oriented players.

When you release the light shield your secondary weapon will be out thus skipping the time and animation it takes to switch and the need for dexterity which is slower than this trick anyways. 
I find this kinda cool if you are set up with fire power, light shield, ammo, suppresser, storm rifle, frag grenade.

Everything looks good as far as I can tell. This seems to do a good job explaining both of the Didacts whereabouts.  

 I still get confused with the Halo count at the end of *Cryptum*. 
The general consensus is that there were the 12 original Halos, 5 of which were destroyed by the Forerunners, leaving the 7 Halos.  [Halopedia](http://www.halopedia.org/Halo_Array) presents an 18 Halo theory that seems plausible, especially considering that the original 12 Halos were 30,000km in diameter.  This also explains the ""shortening"" of Installation 07 in the events of *Primordium*.  This gives us the 7 -  10,000km Halo network from the games.

&gt;We’re excited to deliver a brand-new experience to Halo 4 Matchmaking that will focus on even starting weapons and map control, with players fighting to gain control of all rifles, power weapons and each map’s power positions. The Legendary Slayer playlist launches Monday, July 15, on the following maps, which have been custom-created specifically for this playlist:
&gt;
&gt;* Haven
&gt;* Solace
&gt;* Adrift
&gt;* Abandon
&gt;* Landfall
&gt;* Monolith
&gt;* Skyline
&gt;* Shutout

------------------------------
&gt;* 4 vs. 4 Slayer
&gt;* Default starting weapon (Assault Rifle)
&gt;* No Armor Abilities 
&gt;* Motion Tracker enabled
&gt;* All weapons and grenades located on map (no initial, random or personal ordnance)
&gt;
&gt;The singular loadout is:
&gt;
&gt;* Starting weapon: Assault Rifle 
&gt;* Secondary weapon: None 
&gt;* Armor Ability: None
&gt;* Grenades: Frag x2 
&gt;* Support upgrade: Explosives 
&gt;* Tactical package: Resupply

If you ask me, this is a great comeback for ""classic"" Halo gameplay. No armour abilities and whatnot, equal starts, small arena maps (Still sprint, but I have mixed feelings on that anyway)

If you get a bad weapon, it sucks to be you!) which I have created in all previous Halo games.  This game type is a big hit with friends over, or in custom parties online, or both.  The problem is that in Halo 4 it appears you cannot set the starting weapon to random!  This ruins the whole game type since the point of the game is to play your best with the random weapon you start with.  Am I stupid?  Is there a way to set the starting weapon to random?

I dont consider myself to be very good (1.08 kd) but I had to stop playing and turned my Xbox off after a round of team throwdown. The entire time they just talked shit, not one callout the whole game, saying Im trash after I died weakening the guy they just killed, and more.

Plus, it's fun! The main game modes you want to play are Binary Slayer and Fiesta. Binary Slayer will get you the Binary Rifle kills, and Fiesta will get you Scattershot and Incineration Cannon kills, plus a few Binary Rifle kills. I have only been doing this for 3 days, and I'm already Expert in all of the Forerunner Ordnance weapons! I Hope this helped out, because the Believe stance looks epic.	t5_2sjls	True
1361747455.0	195o8s	SWAT would be a lot better...	ThoughtToPost	26	9	7	"If they brought back the option to let you vote for different modes occasionally instead of just always going with slayer. Halo 3 for example would let you do oddball or CTF in swat and it added a lot of variance to the playlist. I know I could go play those modes in their playlist, but playing them in swat feels completely different and it was a lot of fun. I think I actually like those modes better with swat than normal settings.

Also, it could definitely use more maps. I don't understand why 343 left some of the stock maps out of the mode. Ragnarok for example plays pretty well in swat and I feel like the design of a few other larger maps would still provide a solid game pace. It's awesome they added Shutout but there are still a lot of maps that would work well

I love swat and it's the main reason I got the game. But I feel like it could've been a whole lot better with minimal extra effort from 343"	t5_2sjls	True

In blops2 there is a level that is glitched really badly, you have to kill everyone to continue but sometimes the AI can glitch out.  I spent 2 hours one night and an hour last night just trying to find that one glitched enemy just so I could progress.  I almost quit but finally I did it(I don't know how I did it it just let me reach the checkpoint).   I almost wanna play legendary again just so I can have a true, good SP experience.

""CSR – Competitive Skill Rank

We have been working closely with several internal teams on optimizing the ranking system, and working to integrate it into your Waypoint player profile, accessible on web, phone and tablet.

More Details:

• You will have a unique CSR visible per playlist.  
• Your highest CSR across all playlists will be promoted in the player profile on Halo Waypoint.  
• CSR uses familiar 1-50 scale.  
• When CSR launches, everyone will start with a fresh rating.


Our targeted launch date for CSR is April 2013, and we will be re-configuring some of our most competitive playlists to accommodate the launch of the feature. ""

So back in the days of Halo 3, me and some friends played a special infected game. It was usually played on Sandtrap due to the openness of the map. Humans have the choice between BR, Assault Rifle, and Magnum/pistol, then there are warthogs and mongooses. Zombies move at 180% speed (about mongoose speed) but die very easily. The objective is to live but due to the quickness of the infected, you have to vehicle up. I tested this in halo 4 yesterday with a group and it was AMAZING. I need to forge a map to play it but it seems to work fine on Exile/Vortex/Ragnarok. The more people the more fun, it sounds very simple but until you are a lone warthog with a gunner being chased by 12 super fast infected, you haven't given this a chance. Anyway, I was trying to get a larger group because the game becomes increasingly fun with higher numbers. I am at work until 5 but we will be getting a game going around 6 PM EST.

Also I will NOT send you the codes on the caps since I already entered all of them, you just get the matches. By the end of the month I should have around 800 matches because im still getting the caps so that's around 80 people I can give these to.

All I ask in return is you subscribe to my YouTube channel or follow me on Twitter. You don't have to, ill still send you the matches, but I would really appreciate it since im just starting out and have big plans for YT.

If anyone knows anything about this, thanks!

Edit: I guess it's dumb that I commented here, but I asked the lady who wrote the Facebook post how this happened. Apparently Cade used his Make-A-Wish to visit the studio where Halo 4 was being made and got to meet the creators and see the game.

The ending was very unsettling to me. I have always read a lot into Chief's and Cortana's relationship, and I would argue that in past games, it was heavily implied, not neglected. That almost made it more powerful, in a ""forbidden love"" kind of way.

Anyway, after going back to re-watch the cutscenes, I noticed something in the very first one: Cortana is visibly upset when she first awakens Chief. The first time I played, that made virtually no sense to me. After realizing what happens to her, I think she was so upset because she knew John would now have to watch her rampancy grow. At the end of Halo 3, she was left without John. Now, before Halo 4 even begins, she realizes he will be left without her.

TL;DR Cortana was so upset at the beginning of the game because she knows she is becoming rampant, and now, John will have to watch.

P.S. If Cortana doesn't survive some way or another into the rest of the series, the games are ruined for me."	t5_2sjls	True

I'm keyyys, and this is something that I have been wanting to do for a while, but I always felt that /r/halo was maybe not the venue for a post like this (maybe it is? Let me know if I should x-post), but I would like to do weekly loadout challenges for you guys, much like /u/Almkrona has been doing over in /r/truetf2.

Here's the idea: Each week, I post a new loadout option. Just one new weapon, AA, or any other loadout option. However, I'll probably stick with Weapon and AA since they are the most game-changing.

to copypasta from /u/Almkrona's thread:

**RULES**

* You have to play with this challenge loadout item for at least 1 hour

* You can't change loadout in the middle of the challenge

* You can use it in any playlist (that allows loadouts), with any other parts of a loadout you choose. When you post here to discuss the weapon, post the rest of your loadout as well if you feel it has any significance to your discussion.

**The Storm Rifle**

The ""spiritual successor"" to the plasma rifle, this automatic weapon tears down shields, leaving enemies defenseless, but may seem to fall short on the *killing* aspect which is, after all, what halo is all about.  
I haven't seen this weapon used nearly as much as the Assault rifle in game, which is why I am beginning with this weapon. Is there more to the Storm Rifle than the general public imagines? Does this function as a great CQC Support weapon? We've gotta play it to find out!

* Note that you don't necessarily have to make this the only weapon you use, just make sure you focus on playing with it throughout the hour.

I'm also using the storm rifle because of the ""Fully Automated"" weekly challenge. Hopefully this will give you a chance to try out a new weapon *and* get some challenge XP!

**After you have played with the storm rifle for an hour, report here to discuss the pros and cons of the weapon and its general playability. Good luck, Spartans.** 

EDIT: I now realize that the title may have caused confusion with the official weekly challenges, and therefore I will from now on call them the ""Reddit Weekly Loadout Challenges"" if that helps"	t5_2sjls	True

I'm an enormous fan of the Halo Universe, one of the best Sci-Fi stories being told presently.

Yesterday, I picked up and beat it on Legendary, the first time playing Halo since I beat Reach.  It was a blast!  I was probably one shot dozens of times.  Still amazing.  

I still can't believe what happened to Cortana, it was heartbreaking.  But, if she had to go, I'll be damned if I can think of a better way of removing her from the storyline.  Showing that in the end, she was more human than John has been since becoming part of the Spartan program. 

I still don't understand why we're fighting the Covenant again, in the beginning, unless I missed it, it was explained, just we both stumbled upon a Forerunner world and decided to fight over it?  If there are any lore officianado's here and would like to clear up the ending of Halo 3 and how it plays into Halo 4, I'd be forever grateful.

I made a map that I named Failsafe.  It is on my fileshare and is designed as a damaged spaceship docked at an abandoned research facility.  The idea behind this map was to have a great deal of Dominion and Extraction activity take place on the ship as the crew tries to initiate repairs and activate the internal defenses.  Infection and slayer gametypes will take place on the map as infected survivors (and infected non-survivors) attempt to hijack the ship.

Each section of the ship is color coded.  Blue for the Bridge, green for the Cargo Bay, purple for the weapons control room, red for the walkway/docking clamp, and yellow for the space station.

I haven't finished loading out the map with power weapons and I haven't finished deploying spawn points on the space station.  At this time I am looking for feedback on the balancing of Spawnpoints for Dominion, Extraction, Capture the Flag, and Infection.

Anyone wishing to take a look and give some constructive feedback after playing a few games; please feel free to download the map from my fileshare.

The BR should be good at mid-long range and the DMR at Long-Very Long range. This is not the case however because right now the DMR fire rate is too fast to counter the BR at the lower power rate they have given the BR(notice you can't 4 shot anymore?). The BR either needs to be given a slight increase in power so as to make 4 shots possible again, or the DMR bloom needs to go back to the speed it was at in Halo:Reach.

1370408098.0	1fpbto	Weapons update (mainly dmr, br, movement) thoughts.	Iamrohe	15	3	18	So I've played halo since way back, blah, blah, die hard fan, you know the story. When halo 4 came out, alot of committed player said 343 ruined it and they wanted halo 3 back, or the reach ruined it with the dmr. That brings me to two things. first, Halo changes, it always has. Halo 2 was way different than CE, 3 was way different than 4, reach brought major changes and so did 4. personally I've loved them all. Things change, if bungie ( and 343 ) had just reproduced halo 2 over and over with better graphics it would get really boring really fast (sound like any other massive game franchise?). secondly, regarding the dmr. Alot of people said it ruined halo starting in reach, yet the drm is very similar to the br from halo 3 (mid to long range rifle). In halo it seems that the common complaint is the dmr ruins everything and is way to powerful, yet you still see mlg players using both the dmr and br based of of personal choice. But If the dmr is really that much better than the br, then why keep using the br? As for the update regarding the two, all I noticed (As a player who uses both) is that it only brought more of a difference to the two. the br isn't very effective as a mid-long range weapon, the burst has two much spray. The dmr works quite well as mid-long range, but it doesn't have the same fire rate as the br. the way I see the update is the br becomes even more of a mid (maybe mid-close) range weapon, and the dmr becomes used more for only long range. By powering the dmr down I suspect it will become used for more of a long range weapon, people arn't going to want to challenge a br with dmr if the br is in range due to the update. For the rest of the update, I didn't notice the speed change really (not enough to change gameplay), rest of the weapon changes AR, SR, LR, carbine,and suppressor all still easily lose to either the dmr or br. So for everyone saying the update ruined it because you keep losing battles, give it some time, change up the way you play a bit. Did you play halo 3 the exact same way you played halo 2, I doubt it.	t5_2sjls	True

I spend a lot of time consuming mass amounts of information and observations. For everything it's worth my OPINION of this game is that yeah it needs some tweaking in a few places. However, people need to realize that this game brought a lot of potential to the table and created an entirely new world. I can't honestly say that I wanted another (and improved) version of Halo 3. I wanted something different and challenging. This game has been exactly that.

Now for the concept of how 343 did. Seriously take into account that you added a lot of different people into the creation process and that the gaming population has been horribly exposed to the CoD franchise. With that corruption (yes I mean exactly that) of a different style being spread through casual conversation to seeing it on commercials and adding celebrities to the mix. It was destined to worm it's way in.

Being 100% loyal to the original over so many years and an entire handover is hard. We live with it and move on. All we need to do is come up with ideas and changes and put them on the table and let 343 learn the hard way if they do not listen, and for them they adopted way to many halo children to not be able to hear all of our voices.

But I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the good old days.    
But anyways... So, there's a pretty big division in the Halo community among which game is the best, which game is the worst, which game ruined the franchise, etc. Some people say it died when they changed the (amazing) Halo 2/3 gameplay and use the low population as proof that the changes made people stop playing. What I think should happen is update Halo 2 in the same way they did CEA, but also put in the multiplayer exactly as it was (or maybe put a carbon copy of H3 multiplayer, to have it slightly more mdoern? i'd be fine with that as well). If it becomes a big hit and revives the franchise, awesome we get an amazing game to play for many more years. If it turns out people are only remembering the games through nostalgia-tinted glasses, or Halo just simply isn't a mainstream game anymore (the industry is quite different than it was in even 2007) then the fanboys still get their wet-dream, and we learn that, no, 343 did not ""kill"" Halo. It just seems like a good idea to me. Since they are most likely going to do a H2A anyways, it's not even like it's a financial risk. At the very least, it could provide some useful input for 343 to learn from regarding what the fans want the franchise to be like."	t5_2sjls	True

I took a Binary rifle to the face the other day from a buddy who was cloaked and perched up on a rock on the Abandon map.  Prior to getting painted by a red triangular beam followed by complete disintegration; I caught a glimpse of how creepy and Predator-like the kill was.  Now that the giddy 12 year old within me has awakened by some of the cool features the H4 sandbox has to offer, I searched the internet for collective ideas on a Predator-like custom game type.  Unfortunately they're mostly ""Flood"" gametype copies that revolve around invisible pumped infected and I can't help but think it can be done better.  The Preds aren't just melee masters, they use sophisticated weaponry too.  They need Binary rifles, railguns (upgrade) and swords for the full Yautja effect.
    
TL;DR - Is there a way to custom create a kickass Predator game type which meets (or comes close) to the criteria below?

- Two Teams (Predators vs. Marines)
- Preferably not Red and Blue, but other colors that blend better? (Beige and Brown maybe)
- Two Preds on a team max vs. at least 6 marines (3/1 ratio)
- Predators need: Primary: Binary Rifle, Secondary: Sword, Ordnance: Railgun, Good Camo, Unlimited Promethean Vision
- Marines need: Assault Rifles, BR's, Shotguns, Pistols, knives, sharp sticks... (Maybe 2 loadouts to choose from?)  
- Needs to be round based (1 life per player) 3 Rounds (objective = survive)

If I use the ""Flood"" Gametype as a template like everyone else, then Preds can't carry weapons which is a total buzzkill.
If I use a Regicide or Juggernaut game type as a template then there would only be one Pred with no regulations on loadout selection, plus no teams.  What keeps the marines from killing each other?
What are some of your thoughts for a Predator vs. Marines game type?
Does anyone have one created?

""Match-making"" is slower than a 50ft shit coming out of an ant's ass.  You just sit in the lobby and wait and wait and wait.  First of all, is this common or is it just happening to me?  I'm on a 15Mb connection with AT&amp;T uverse.

Finally, once the game begins, in the middle of the game, the screen goes black and I see a loading screen, as if the server just had a brain fart.  It happens several times during some games.  How can you enjoy this?

When I get killed, it shows me a replay of the enemy (from their first-person view) as they killed me.  In the replay videos, they're not even aiming at me.  Person shoots the wall/sky/ground and I die.

I'm sure they did when they killed me, but why would the developer ""show"" you a replay of you getting killed when the replay of it isn't even accurate?

Lastly, the ""leveling"" system seems pretty much useless.  I'm not used to playing with the controller, but I'm getting much better.  However, in 75% of the games or so, it's like one team completely dominates the other team...

Another bug I see is that in the team games, if people start to leave in the lobby, it'll still start the game with a completely unbalanced team.  Wat!

Is this all normal in Halo 4 or console online gaming in general, or am I just seeing some weird stuff???"	t5_2sjls	True

* Are all the armor types cosmetic or do they serve a function in protecting you more?   For instance, does the air assault armor give you a boost to jet pack?  

*  How do you avoid laggy games or people?  I have been hit after I retreat behind a wall more times than I can count.

*  Do head shots before their armor goes down give you more damage to their armor?  

*  In SWAT, how can someone one shot you with a pistol at long range?  

*  Also in SWAT, does it only take one shot to the head with the BR?  I've only used DMR.

*  How do you avoid being shot in the back when on a bad team?  I am a run and gun kinda guy, but even then I find myself being shot in the back constantly.

*  What are your thoughts on the people that use XIM?  I played PC for a long time, specifically CS:S and I can't hit anything with a controller.

I excel very well when I start to play the game because I have no record and no expectations of myself. I perform very well and play to a high level; my kill to death ratio at the start (Level 1 to 40) was ~2.0, a little higher or lower at times, but overall consistent. Then after I do this and continue playing I think myself stupid. I feel like there is pressure on me to perform at that level constantly and then I start making stupid decisions and playing poorly.

In Halo 2 and 3 I did the whole Lone Wolves thing and was able to get up to level 40 in a very short amount of time, but then I just plateau and stop gaining levels because I get too anxious and can't play anymore. I know it sounds unreasonable and petty but I just want to get past this because this is not a problem in just video games but also elsewhere in my life. When the pressure is on I rarely rise to meet the challenge and I'm quite frankly sick of being a second rate person. 

This probably could be better suited to another subreddit but I have been playing Halo quite a bit recently and I feel like there have to be others out there that have either been in my position or can relate. If anyone has any helpful tips or things they do to help themselves get over their own self inflicted plateaus I would love to hear them.

I'm on all the time, and would play matchmaking, customs, or even just appreciate any feedback.So please hit me up, I'd love to see what everyone else has come up with too, get some Ideas.

My latest and greatest map is called AIR-DEFENSE. It's set up for extraction based on ""Impact"" This ship type structue is attacking the smaller island(of the two on Impact"") which has structures and ""Anti-Air Cannons."" If nothing else its pretty fun to explore!!!!!!


Looking at my file share now and realizing that it could be confusing recomendations are:

-fig8dom -built on impact blocks in the shape of figure eight, is oblong with two tiered play inside and above ""station pieces""

-dominion-Forge island, Small map simple plays well. Slayer or dominion. Symmetrical, two bases and two Ascension(from Halo2) satellite pieces at the four corners. Each has a dominion point. Small map for small groups. 

-barrel of monkeys- Impact- Ship build from station pieces is docked on space/base/island/thing. pretty sweet idea, needs refining.

-TP - medium slayer mape 2-6 players. teleporters, grav lifts, balance, rocks, buildings, and a hidden saw in the center are all on this square arena.

Airdefence- so proud. please try.

Cylinder- older map built on impact around circle base on bigger island. its a big cylinder with walkways and what not, reminds me of halo1
Yall better respond now. I just spent alotta time typing this up.

1359748819.0	17pnoi	Customizing controls	submarine_sam	8	1	7	"   I think custom controls are a feature that 343 should seriously consider for Halo 4. They offer many variants of the default controls which is great, but it's frustrating that none of these have the aspect I'm looking for. 

  I switched to bumper jumper in H3 for the ability to jump and aim at the same time. This was a serious edge on competitive play or at least I felt a serious difference. My problem with bumper jumper is that my armor ability is now on (x) meaning I can't use my armor ability and aim at the same time. This puts me at a serious disadvantage when trying to use light shield or jet pack. 

So to use either of those abilities optimally I would need to have my armor ability on the bumper, but to have my armor ability on one of the bumpers I have to sacrifice my ability to jump and aim at the same time.
You can probably see my point now, with custom controls I could optimize my controller for my own game-play."	t5_2sjls	True

I have noticed a lot of the halo communities are pretty plagued with negativity. I understand criticism but there are constructive ways to discuss your frustrations and desires for things to be changed.

I have also noticed that halo community has slacked in supporting other players. This can be anything from watching a livestream to montages, to sharing custom maps and gametypes.

For these reasons I have started www.Halomatic.com . You guys are the first people to see where it is at, and I would love to have you guys help guide where it goes. Being that you guys are the first, I really need your help and support to get this thing up and running. It would mean the world to me if you would register and make a post or two.

I truly believe that this could be something huge! I hope you join me on this journey :).

I have found this to be a great advantage in all of the following Halo games as many players seem to freeze up when you are able to consistently jump and accurately hit them at the same time. Some people might say the introduction of Armor Abilities in Reach evened the controls out a bit since it essentially made Jet Pack useless with Bumper Jumper because you couldn't aim while holding the 'X' button but I disliked that ability anyway and used Evade or Sprint almost exclusively. Most of my friends use either Default or Recon which don't seem to offer much upside outside of them being used to these controls and I constantly try to convince them to switch (it took me all of 10 matches to become very comfortable using Bumper Jumper). Do most of you use Bumper Jumper and does it offer as large of an advantage as I feel it does? Do other button layouts such as Boxer offer any significant advantages that I am unaware of?	t5_2sjls	True

1364672396.0	1bbfhr	Looking Ahead		13	7	7	"I'd like to not rant. I know people hate rants unless everyone's heads are in line with each other. But here's a few things I'd like to point out based on recent events. 



* **343 is trying to catch the ball they dropped.**



By this, I mean they have recognized the damage done to the Halo community, and they want to repair the damage. Thus, they gave us Forge Island (a couple days early, as you all know). They implemented the ability to balance weapons based on community input. 


* **Spartan Ops is likely not returning.**



I'd like to know the reason for 343 investing so much time and effort into Spartan Ops, only to have the entire thing called off after just one season. They destroyed Requiem not to take the story to the next level, but so they could put a clean end to Spartan Ops. 



I know people will disagree on this, but I find Spartan Ops to have a low replay value, other than to go work on commendations.



I was expecting this to continue, so that we'd have a better idea about the story of Halo 5. The only thing that Spartan Ops changed in the story was the destruction of Requiem and Halsey going along with the Storm Covenant. Other than that, **very little has changed.**



* **Execution of promised fixes has been sloppy and slow.**



The File Browser was a mess at launch. Long story short, it didn't work. This was an elementary piece of the Halo 4 puzzle. 



Many gametypes are still MIA. Grifball came back, but it took them a long time to implement it into Matchmaking. 



We were all so excited by the return of the infamous ""Red X"". I actually laughed when I saw this feature return in Matchmaking. First of all, they're white. And they last for three seconds if you're lucky to see it as it happens. **This is not the Red X we know and love.**



Weapon balancing will now commence thanks to the recently added backend tuning system, but I found the announcement vague. Will they let us know in advance? And if they change something, who will they listen to? 



Now that we know that CSR will only be available via Halo Waypoint, I can't help but feel that 343 is trying to drown out third party stat providers like HTR. I know this is going far, but in [this](http://i.imgur.com/eqoRGk5.png) post by *bs angel*, I have to call bullshit on not being able to view CSR ingame because of limitations. 



I believe 343 doesn't want players getting scared of seeing a bunch of 50 ranked players on the other team and leaving. Well, guess what? Players do the same thing when they see their opponents are all SR-130 and have good stats. So, they should **hide all stats in pre-game lobby.** That way, **no one would leave unless they recognized a gamertag on the other team.**



TL;DR: Too bad. Read it. 



So, this post was titled 'Looking Ahead'. Here's what I see. I can see our population never rising above 100K ever again. I can hear the thousands of voices disagreeing on what weapons need to be balanced.
 


After all that, I don't think Halo 4 is a bad game. It is, within reason, a relatively stable game and it is *good*. I refuse to give it better than that until the big issues are resolved and we see people coming back to the servers again.

secondly, seeing as i haven't read the books, and i know a fair few people haven't, it would be good to know why the forerunners want to kill the humans so badly?

Wtf, don't tell me splazers are part of the ordinance drop? Why would that be there? Slayer maps are usually small (except for Harvest) so spawning anti-vehicle weapons aren't necessary?

I got Halo 4 for xmas and tonight is the first time i put it in the xbox, but when i started the game it prompted me to 'resume campaign' instead of 'start campaign'.

I went into the campaign menu and it looked like somehow both 'prologue' and 'dawn' had been completed on normal difficulty.

I pressed 'resume campaign' anyway and sure enough it put me at the beginning of 'requiem' where he is asking her about a crash.

I thought this was pretty weird so i went i to system settings&gt;storage and deleted both saved files i had there and restarted the game.

That time it actually prompted me to 'start campaign' (that option wasnt even there the first time i started the game) ...but it still says that i have completed 'prologue' and 'requiem' on normal difficulty.

There isnt really anyone who could have played the game on my xbox that i know of.

I propose a system that would give each player a rating, lets call it a quit rating, that matches them with others who quit as frequently as they do.

For instance, lets say you start at 100/100 quit rating. Every time you leave a game, you get deducted 5 points; every time you stay through the entire game, you get 1 point added.

This would make it so the people who frequently quit games are matched with others who frequently quit games. This gives them a taste of their own medicine and they will have to learn to stick through games in order to match with people who actually stay to the end.

It seems harsh but as long as you only leave 1 out of 5 games, your fine. Nobody wants to sit there and get pummeled on, or maybe you just got disconnected. The point is, there needs to be something that damages people for leaving their allies to die.

1355265753.0	14ouuj	Why people aren't good at Halo/how to get better.	Cleric187	11	8	25	"So, after a painful and prolonged losing streak while playing the crimson DLC for the first time, my friend EAGLE 117 rage quit before going on an uncontrolable rant on how horrible our teammates were.

This led me back to the age old question of ""HOW do people become ""good"" at Halo?""

Well here is what I have seen in regards to why people are NOT good at halo.  

1.  You're just born that way.  
-It's true, some people are just naturally good at it for no obvious reason. But that's no excuse to suck.
2.  You make bad decesions.
-the majority of halo combat revolves around decesions.  ""Should I fight this guy even though he already has a shot on me"", ""Should I charge right now"", ""should I reload or switch to secondary"", ""should I stay in an open or closed area"", ""should I guard base or capture the objective"", ""should I stay near my team or go lone wolf"" ""should I hijack that mech, like a boss"", ""I'm gonna be a hero with 3 kills left.."", ETC...

Now, let me answer these questions for you.
""should I fight this guy even though he already has a shot on me""
-No, take cover and call him out.  Only fight when you have the advantage.  This is 90% of why people tend to suck.

""Should I charge right now?""
- If your K/d is under 1.25, then NO.  If it is over 1.25, then you make the call.

""Should I reload or switch to secondary?""
-When in the heat of battle, switch to secondary to save yourself with the boltshot instakill or finish someone off with the pistol.  If you take cover, then just reload.  Don't get killed reloading in a 1v1.

""Should I stay in an open or closed area?""
-closed area's are generally easier for lesser skilled people to get kills or assists.  Why?  Because you can spaz out on someone in a small room by throwing grenades everywhere while ARing them.  This works to get kills.  So, get an AR and stay in a small area.  Skill always wins in a 1v1 in a field...stop putting yourself in that situation.  Put the odds in your favor.

""Should I guard base or capture the objective?""
-you will guard the base if you know what's good for your score and your teams chances of winning.  It's so easy to be succesful at defending the objective in H4.  Get active camo and an AR, and stonewall the enemy's advances on your flag.  Your K/d will rise, and you will have more points than normal due to all the wonderful defense medals, commendations, and awards.  But, if it's KOTH...then run to the hill 24/7 with a hologram.

""Should I stay near my team or go lonewolf?""
-yes, please go ""lonewolf""...we all love your 6-3-18 stat line...NO! don't go lonewolf!  Stay near your teammates and earn those wingman medals...there is a medal for a reason!  Pick up what the better slayers can't finish off, and assist them in their kills.  Always be the ""2"" in a 2 v 1 scenario...

""should I hijack that Mech, like a boss?""
-NO! You will just end up getting killed like the 3 other times you already tried this game!  Spawn with a plasma pistol and EMP that mother so someone else can...You even get a special medal for doing so.

""I'm gonna be a hero with 2 kills left...""
-No, No, NO!  Be the hero by staying back and team shooting people!  The best way to be a hero is to play consistently and provide your team with a valuable and dependable stat line.  Even if it is slightly negative, it can be really good.  Like 8-5-10, or 6-7-7.  You're still going positive when you consider assists, and that's a wonderful thing!

 3. You try to be everything.
-Don't.  Only be 1 thing.  Have a set plan as to what you want to accomplish on the map, set your loadout to do so, and stick to the plan.

1354763178.0	14d2ar	Custom Map: OBSERVATORY	crimsonflux	9	4	2	"GT: Crimson Flux

Map: Observatory [Ver x.x]

Canvas: Impact

Version at post: 1.8


Players: FFA 6-8+, Team 8-16 (double, triples, possible but untested)

Gametypes: FFA/Team Slayer, King, Ball and Team Flag
(Download tailored gametypes from my fileshare) 


Notable features:
- Asymmetric (not your cut and dry MLG map) 
- Single level with multiple slopes
- Extensive use of cover
- Balanced travel times to heavy combat areas/ordnance drops
- Teleporter (holds true to balanced travel times)
- Wreckage zones with hazards
- Center room with ladder mechanic
- Ascetic docking/circling space crafts
- Fantastic flow with easily distinguishable features (again, no need for team colors on every wall)


Design: 
This stellar observatory has suffered heavy meteor damage. Some causeways are exposed to the hazardous radiation of space, draining shields in a soft kill zone with 50% gravity, but they are easily navigated in under 3 seconds. Both red and blue team have equal travel times to the central core room where initial ordnance drops (SAW and Damage Boost). While the map has a somewhat linear flow to the central room, a teleporter prompts perpendicular travel to low ""heat"" zones on the edges of the station. The teleporter not only serves to put traffic in all zones on the map, it is also an added escape route if you suddenly become overwhelmed, especially in objective game types. During playtesting, most of the ""heat"" has been located in the center and near the teleporters, which means it doesn't take half the game to find out where the fight is. The multiple approaches to the central room make for fantastic flanking and rewards well-organized teams.

The Promethean was supposedly scanning Master Chief for possible weaknesses. This is what I think - Master Chief's weakness is his childhood. As a child, he was kidnapped by Dr. Hasley for the Spartan II program and it doesn't seem as if he had a childhood to remember. I'm sure as a child, he wanted to see to see his family and friends, but was forced into Dr. Haley's program AND she manipulated his entire family. With his family most likely dead, how would Master Chief react to this? He has done so much for the survival of the human race, but what has the humans have done for Master Chief beside kidnapping him and using him as a war machine? 343 also said that they were going to bring the ""human"" side of Master Chief which could mean Master Chief might have second thoughts so to speak. Humans are not perfect, and all because Master Chief went through augmentations, training, etc. doesn't make him less human than anyone else. 

In conclusion - Master Chief's weakness is his childhood (family, friends, disappearance, kidnapping, etc.)"	t5_2sjls	True

I believe the issue is that there is no timer to respawn when someone dies. For whatever reason this was put in, it completely changes the flow of the game type. It's even more concerning that there are 5 other teams all over a possibly small map. I'm not completely sure about other game types, but SWAT I know for a fact has the no wait respawn time.

Where they mention it is better to install Halo 4 on the *console* than on another storage device.

I'ma bit lost on terminology there, doesn't *another storage device* mean an external USB hard disk or a flash memory card? How else would I install it? Do they mean *cloud* installation would be a trouble?

So here are two codes. I saw an earlier post about potential bots scooping up and redeeming posts like this. I'm not sure if this is something wide-spread enough to be worried about, but not a lot surprises me these days - so I figured it would be fun to post the codes in ~~Wingdings~~ I mean ~~strikethrough font and make you work for em. (Plus I'm too lazy to upload a screen capture or work out some elaborate code... although I thought making people copy/paste into Notepad and swap Wingdings for another font was rather clever. Luckily Reddit's lack of font support has preempted such desires.)~~

Apparently pasting Strikethrough into the Mt Dew Dbl XP Redemption field will un-Strikethrough it... proving that both Mt Dew and Reddit are either smarter than I am, or I am not as smart as I thought I was... perhaps both.

(Anyone who points out there are bots capable of grabbing imaged text and redeeming it will be stabbed repeatedly by a glittery white faux icicle Christmas tree ornament.)

As always I will keep the caps to be sure I didn't copy the codes down wrong, although after all this trouble I will be stabbing MYSELF with said faux icicle Christmas tree ornament if this turns out to be the case.

1355352804.0	14r1yj	Spartan Ops Awful Respawns?	Sirnacane	4	0	3	I've been playing a while but only started completing Spartan Ops yesterday. I'm playing on legendary, and while legendary is hard it isn't impossible as you all know. The only problem is that once I eventually die, I seem to always be randomly respawned in the worst possible areas. It's either 1) Directly in the middle of multiple enemies or 2) Extremely effing far away. The former option happens most often, and it's so annoying. It doesn't make the game hard, it makes it impossible and aggravating. I was just now going through a mission and I got to a point where like 4-6 Elites dropped in, each with it's own power weapon. I was doing fine but accidentally fell off the map while walking backwards (it seems this is a lot easier to do on Halo 4 than the other ones. I do it ALL the time). Instead of respawning me like 10 feet back from where I was, it respawned me in the middle of 4 elites. Literally in the middle, on in front, one in back, one to the right, one to the left. I died before I could even look around to see where I was. You just can't live when you're being sniped, concussion rifled, fuel rod gunned, etc., and not to mentioned grenaded the second you've respawned with 0 zero cover and not good enough weapons to kill your enemies because they have ridiculous health. Has anyone else noticed this spawn problem? There's a difference in making a game hard and making a game borderline impossible.	t5_2sjls	True
1355261871.0	14opze	[Discussion] How does everyone feel about really pushing 343 to make CTF fun again!	andrewrhodes_	8	3	7	"
Now in past Halo's, when you picked up the flag, you were invisible to the enemy, and that was where all the skill came into the defending part of the game... FINDING and killing that enemy as a TEAM.

At first I thought the big ""KILL"" marker above flag carriers was neat...
I realized it takes so much away from CTF in Halo 4 which lets be honest, is one of the best Halo gametypes.
You no longer have to communicate with your team about where the enemy is, you're all just always moving towards the objective, doing your own thing... very COD-like.

1354902750.0	14gcby	Best Longbow Dominion Strategy	Cleric187	4	1	6	"When playing Dominion, it is always best to have a plan before hand.  The plan should involve a basic strategy for the specific map while taking into consideration the individual skills and strengths of your team.  After this has been established, a team should then adjust their loadouts to maximize the strengths of their specific role during the match.  The goal of this strategy is for a team of decent players to win 90% of the time, even against higher skilled players.  How?  Because it is designed to put you at a tactical advantage over the enemy team at all times.  Thus, decreasing the advantage of individual skill for the opposing team.  

So, let's assume you are red team, starting at C base.  The majority of teams out there will send a couple to C and everyone else, if not all, to B.  This is not what you should do, unless you are a team of elite slayers. Instead, you should focus on countering this universal strategy.

The best way to do this would be to send 3 people in the hog to A base, 2 people to C base, and 1 person to B base.  This will define the basic roles for everyone in the match.  The hog team is responsible for holding A, and the other 3 are responsible for holding C.  We are basically going to give B up.  So, let's discuss how to best execute this strategy.

HOG TEAM:
The hog team should rush the enemy's base (A Base).  Their goal is to clear the enemy base, take it, then hold it for the duration.  The best way to do this is to rush with the hog around the back of the map (water side).  It is important that the passenger in the hog is the teams best slayer and that he grabs the rockets beforehand.  He should also be outfitted with a jetpack, mobility, and ammo (for extra rockets).  The other 2 guys in the hog should have loadouts designed to capture and hold the base, such as active camo, the grenadier perk (to bombard the base with nades before entering), and possibly the wetwork or dexterity perk as the support upgrade. 

When the hog rushes A base, the passanger should jump out as they are pulling up, jetpack to the roof, and rocket the enemy inside as they try to capture the base.  At about this time, the gunner and driver should have exited the vehice and started to throw nades inside the base.  The gunner should go in through the side door near the rock structure in the middle, and the driver should go through the back door.  You should be able to take the base with ease due to the surprise of the rush, the firepower of rockets, and a combined 8 grenades.

Once the Hog team has secured A base, they should get ready for the counter attack.  This is where the active camo comes in.  With 3 people camping with active camo, and maybe a hardlight shield, the base will be incredibly difficult to take back.  Especially if you still have rockets....and if you are halfway decent, YOU SHOULD.  Another suggestion in holding the base would be the firepower perk with a suppressor for close range action.  Suppressor &gt; DMR at close range, so use that to your advantage.

B man: (guy who rushes B)

One person should rush B base in the beggining in order to apply pressure to the enemy team and stall them while the rest of the team captures A and C.  The B man should be the teams 2nd best slayer.  His job is to delay the enemy occupation of B.  The recomended loadout would be DMR, Boltshot, jet pack, Mobility, dexterity.  He should use mobility to get to B pronto, and then either the jetpack to gain the highground on the roof, or go inside the base before the enemy get there to camp with the boltshot.  The ideal scenario would be for the B man to get a few kills and hold the enemy off of B until the cap on A base is initiated.  Once B man dies, he then switches his loadout to hardlight shield, shielding, and wetwork and joins C team to camp C base.

C Team:

C team has the easy task of capping the closest base and camping it until the end...  Seems boring, right?  NO!  Winning is not boring!  C team should be prepared for an enemy rush, and certainly an enemy push eventually.  C team is also responsible for utilizing the sniper that spawns with the rockets at start.  As soon as the match starts, one guy should grab snipe, and one guy should initiate C base ASAP (in order to get the reinforcement weapon drop quicker).  The sniper should get to the top of C base where he can somewhat assist B man, and also help defend C if need be.  For camping C, the loadouts should be the same as described for camping A base (suppreser, active camo, hardligh shield, shielding, grenadier, etc.)  Make sure to utilize the shotgun and rockets on the weapon drops. 

Midway through the game, both the Hog team (camping A base) and C team should have secured the rockets and shotgun weapon drops.  Therefore they should now be camping invisibly, inside a small base, secured by shield doors and turrets, with close range power weapons, and with up to 3 teammates.... this is a situation that is heavily in your favor and puts you at a big advantage over most players, and a decent advantage over players that may be more ""skilled"" than you.

Important considerations:

It would be benificial for 1 guy camping A base to grab the Wraith when it's available.  
Patience and percesion are key to winning this map/gametype consistently.
Make sure to call out kills.  If A base gets a good double kill, and C base calls out a kill, then it may be a good idea for the best slayer to take advantage of that and rush B base, just to keep the enemy on their toes...

Do this well, and do this right, and I guaruntee that a decent team will win 90% of the time.  Elite Strategy beats Elite Skill.

1372013868.0	1gx6f7	Can't make Flood game with 1 life?!	AtomicAcid	4	1	5	"Hey guys, I've been having trouble for quite a while with making a Flood gametype similar to the old ""Predator"" from Halo 3, where there is a single zombie that is invisible has to sneak up and kill the humans one at a time. Back then, the life count was set to 1, and the round would end if someone managed to kill the zombie. Now in Halo 4, if the alpha zombie is killed, the round doesn't end, and the game just remains in a perpetual state of waiting for the timer to run out. 

There are multiple solutions to this but none of them are very favorable for my gametype:

* Humans turn to regular flood (Would kind of ruin the suspense of a single scary predator)

* Keep all the new flood trapped in a box somewhere (Wow this would be boring as hell for killed humans, because they can't watch their team-mates run around while they're dead)

1368819702.0	1ejbfb	A few things that makes it impossible for me to enjoy the multiplayer as a Halo game	MrTra1tor	17	13	11	"* **Loadout system:**

I hate this feature because it's far from what Halo is about! Halo had a special thing compared to other FPS and that feature was Weapons around the map! Sure we can get ordnance drops (Aka killstreaks) and sure there is a few power weapons on some maps. But that's not what I mean! I mean that everyone starts with the same kit and have to pick up a weapon that is somewhere on the map!

* **Matchmaking:**

It's good that they improved it so you can get in a match pretty fast even if it's low player count you can get into a game with people in the middle of the game! The really bad thing with this is that this causes people from different places around the world to come in the same game as you! For example: I'm Swedish so if an American would join me he would have over 300 ping! And if an Australian would join he would have mostly 900 ping! This leads me to...

* **Netcode:**

The netcode in Halo 4 is terrible! Especialy when a high-pinger comes to the same game as you! This means that even if you take cover from him, he will still kill you! You'll probably think it's hack but it isn't! It's extremly annoying lag wich will cost your life! To improve this, 343 should make a filter settings (and perhaps dedicated servers?) so you can choose what region you want your search to be!

* **Theater:**

I know that it's only in 3 Halo game (only counting the multiplayer) but this feature is so buggy that it's almost impossible sometimes to record! [Example video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGmtUtNYKxE)

I want the old Halo 3 theater back!

* **Hackers:**

Halo 4 is super easy to hack (much easier than Halo 3 was!) and this is really a huge problem! I've seen people firing a shotgun and killing me through the entire map! I've also seen alot people who apperantly have unlimited armor abilities an rapid rocket launchers! It's really annoying that 343 did not include an anti hack service for the game!

* **Vehicle design:**

[SPOILER ALERT]

This may be content from the campaign but it's still bugs me.

The redesigned version of the Pelican is horrible! It's far from what a Pelican should look! When I played the level where you could actually fly one (Reclaimer?) it didn't feel like I was flying a pelican! It felt like I was flying a reskinned version of the Falcon! The old Pelican version looked awesome and there is no good reason to change the design!

Just comment to let me know which code you used, so I can cross them out, and try to let others snatch them up so everyone can benefit. Also, I'm not going to run around cherry picking favorites.

The friends I played with constantly over the first few weeks have all scattered and the random players I've been finding are...  Abominations.  It would be bad enough if they just sucked.  But the rampant team killing on Ragnarok, complete idiocy, and random screaming player that is mediocre at best...

It's been keeping me away from it.  So I'm looking to find some new friends.  I play objective games, enjoy CTF and Dominion the best atm, but I miss Big Team objective games.  I 'specialize' in vehicles and aircraft in particular.

I miss the shit outa the Falcon and got some of my greatest enjoyment out of Halo 4 before they removed the Banshee from CTF Ragnarok.
