1363919655.0	1aryha	Can someone please explain why technology in the universe of LOTR does not develop beyond the iron age?	Papatato	974	220	773	I just don't understand it.  It never bothered me until my recent watching of the fellowship where we find out that about 3000 years pass between the time Sauron was defeated and when the ring came to Frodo.  3000 years.  At the time of that battle, they had what was clearly advanced mastery of iron and steel, so they must have been at the level of technology similar to our late iron age which lasted about 300 years.  Then ten times longer than that passes and they are at the same level of technology!  Almost no innovation took place for 3000 years.  And it isn't because they had magic instead, because most peoples did not.  Only the five wizards and the elves had any mastery of magic and even that had not advanced.  And as intelligent as the dwarves are in the universe, they never invented the drill, which would have revolutionized their mining capabilities and advanced their culture by leaps and bounds.  So someone who is more versed in this universe, I beg of you to clarify why nothing in their world had changed in all that time. 	t5_2rnel	True

Whan would happen if someone SWALLOWED the ring? If Gollum swallowed the finger by accident, or Frodo in desperation swallowed the ring to save it from capture?

I know it is a silly question, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately. They are captured, no ring is found. Hardly eating, it could stay in for a good week or so. Or would it make the bearer (swallower) invisible?

He carries those things around with him the entire trilogy. When he is fighting the giant spider or climbing up mountains, he never ditches the pots. He keeps his backpack on and seems to keep all his supplies with him, but Peter Jackson keeps these pots hanging from his bag, in plain view whenever they show Sam. 

I assume it symbolizes hope. Sam loves food like most Hobbits and he fantasizes about roast chicken with Frodo. Hope was a major theme of the trilogy. 

But the thing that gets me, is when Sam throws them off. They are thrown [directly at the camera](http://i.imgur.com/VRwdWTX.jpg) shortly after Frodo complains that the ring is too much of a burden to carry because it's so heavy. 

Is that the point where they lose hope? Right before they reach the ultimate destination? I'm struggling with the meaning because when they are about to reach the pinnacle, I feel as if hope is greatest. But the pots are gone. 

I wonder if it symbolizes the point where they lose their boyish character, and the pots represented that purity. After that shot, Frodo's face look tattered as all hell. 

I'm struggling to put my finger on their meaning. Any other ideas? "	t5_2rnel	True

But on every hit i got it all seemed to stem from the same text so in a way i only got one hit and it wasn't a particularly good one.
So my question is, can you find me a good paper or essay about him, and what are your thoughts on his mental state.
The one thing i found interesting about the text that i had found was this
""On initial consideration schizophrenia seems a reasonable diagnosis. However, in the context of the culture at the time it is unlikely. Delusions are false, unshakeable beliefs, not in keeping with the patient’s culture. In Middle Earth, the power of the ring is a reality. The passivity phenomena Gollum experiences are caused by the ring, and these symptoms occur in all ring bearers. Gollum does not fulfil the ICD-10 criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia…""

I read all the books growing up and loved the LOTR films and the new Hobbit film, but there is one thing that always gets me about these stories: the Eagles. This fantasy mechanic really doesn't make sense to me. These Eagles show up and literally save the day whenever Gandalf calls them. It always seemed a little far fetched and sort of a crutch. For instance, in LOTR, why wouldn't Gandalf just use the Eagles to fly the ring right into Mordor from the backside. They show up right at the end during the black gate battle, and just in time to rescue Sam and Frodo from scolding lava. Then in the Hobbit we see them rescue Thorin &amp; Co from death and drop them off a little ways away from the misty mountains. That's nice, but couldn't they have just flown them straight on to the lonely mountain?

I guess what I want to know is what are the rules with these Eagles? They can only help for a short time or something? They can't carry people long distances? "	t5_2rnel	True

Now, we all love ""The Hobbit"" and we all love what Peter Jackson did with ""The Lord of the Rings."" And it's not exactly impossible for him to do it, given how he crafted three films of nearly 4 hours' length (especially for the recut DVD versions) from the Rings books.

Did anyone see it in IMAX? Did that effect the film in a bad way or did it make it seem normal? Like you were watching a movie shot at 24 FPS? And those who saw it in not-IMAX, did that whole 48 FPS effect on the film have presence the whole time? I heard some people say it was like watching a super HD version of the move and some people who said the movie looked...well, fake because of it. I'm just curious about others opinions before I go see the film. Edit: *OR* did you just not notice anything at all? 	t5_2rnel	True
