1345742243.0	ypdri	Browncoats, do not be fooled. [A Warning about a current revival campaign]	mkgorgone	370	64	42	"Recently a press release appeared about a team attempting to ""bring back"" Firefly in a project called ""Firefly: A New Beginning"". 

Press Release: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/8/prweb9823805.htm

Via an Indiegogo campaign shooting to raise $1,000,000 these people are trying to film a pilot for a reboot of Firefly set 10 years before the original series. Details here: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/206788

Now, seeing a revival campaign is nothing new to us Browncoats. Hell, there have even been a few sweet fan made movies over the years that have been accomplished through projects like this, though never on this kind of scale. All and all, this would not be an overly bad thing if not for a few troubling facts.

Firstly, Rights. 20th Century Fox (curse them forever) still owns the rights to Firefly and all of the properties therein (Title, characters, setting, etc.); so how do these guys intend to go forward with a project where the title and one of their main characters (Yes, they intend to cast someone as a young Malcolm Reynolds) is the intellectual property of another company?

Secondly, Price Point. Very few things like this (I.E. Indiegogo and/or Kickstarter campaigns) go for a goal of $1,000,000. In fact I can't think of one off the top of my head. Sure there are campaigns that have *raised* over $1million, but to shoot for that right off the bat? It brings me into my third noggin'-scratcher.

Credibility. With fan-funded campaigns like this, especially ones trying to do something grand and impressive, the creators should be able to point to their past work and say, ""Here, look at this, this is why you should trust me and let me make this awesome thing!"" This is not the case with ""Firefly: A New Beginning"". On the Indiegogo page we are instead treated to 38 minute video that amounts to nothing more than a few cast interviews and the man helming this project saying ""Mel"" and ""Josh Wheadon"" a few times. 

Now, you may be saying to yourself, ""But Gorgone, why not just ask these guys all of these questions? Clear the air, as it were?"" And oh, faithful Reddit, if only you knew... Not two hours ago I asked some of these same questions (albeit far more politely and innocently) on this projects Facebook page only to have the questions deleted not an hour later. Suspicious? Perhaps.

You have been warned my fellow Browncoasts, but I shall let you decide for yourselves. Keep Flyin'.


*TL;DR  New revival campaign may be a load of hogwash. Consider the facts (see above).*"	t5_2qs24	True

1335101245.0	sml30	Pledge to finance Firefly Season 2 if you win the lottery.	Spectre_Taz	458	155	113	"I was just thinking to myself that there hundreds of thousands of browncoats out there, many of whom play the lottery on a regular basis. After seeing how a bunch of people just won hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S lottery recently it got met thinking.

As fans we should pledge that if any one of us wins a suffecient amount of money we should buy the rights off Fox or finance more Firefly through Fox. Perhaps start with a 2-3 part miniseries to test the waters to show it could be profitable and also that way it wouldnt interfere with the schedules of Firefly actors currently working on other TV series. As the DVD sales have shown your investment would pay off eventually, especially if you just started with a mini-series to test the water.

A massive pipe dream on my part but its mathematically possible that one of us might get lucky enough to make this happen. Plus I just watched ""Objects in Space"" and its downright depressing that other than Serenity there is no more Firefly, felt like I had to do something.

Anyways, if I somehow get enough money I pledge to use that money to finance more Firefly :)

EDIT: Nathan Fillion is with us on the idea he said the following in an interview last year ""If Castle had its series finale tomorrow and Fox said to you and Joss: “We screwed up, let’s try doing Firefly again.” Would you do it?
Yes. Yes. I would examine very closely Fox’s reasoning — I’m a little gun-shy. If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing I would do is buy the rights to Firefly, make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet.""

Also Morena Baccarin said she would join him if he made it happen.

1370112312.0	1fh5bx	Is it heresy to be a browncoat but not want Firefly to come back?	mdemouli	392	92	128	"Before you freak, just hear me out. I love Firefly and Serenity as much as the next guy, but I'm in love with the beauty of the original series. If it were to be brought back, either by a kick starter campaign or in a way akin to Arrested Development, it just wouldn't be the same. There would be a number of issues, including but not limited to:
*Shepherd Book and Wash are dead
*All of the actors are much older and not in the same shape as the big damn heroes we remember
*It would be chock-full of CGI, losing that beloved beaten-down old western feel
*Because of new projects the actors have moved onto, despite their stated enthusiasm we don't even know how many we'd get back, do you really want an incomplete crew? And Joss is wrapped up with Marvel for quite some time and it's not Firefly without Joss
*Fox still holds the rights, and as we all know, they're dicks

Now I know many people like to trudge on in the face of adversity and say, ""What about a prequel?"" or ""How about something to fill in the blank between Firefly and Serenity?"" or ""I'm sure we could just bring back Wash and Book and pretend it's all ok."" The problem here lies with the actors, Sir Joss, and Fox (because they're dicks). Even if we could pull everyone together, in order to bring Wash and Book back in, it would either have to take place before Serenity or have many flashback to the times before Serenity. While this would be nice because we'd all like to know the Shephard's story and wouldn't it be great if Zoe was pregnant before Wash died, it just wouldn't look good. The actors have all aged and grown and changed, it's been almost 10 years now and there's only so much that makeup could do. 

I guess what I felt the need to get off my chest is the fact that Firefly will always be my favorite show but I love it the way it is and actually don't want to see it come back. It's so amazing the way it was done I only worry that a come back will be hugely disappointing. While it's fun to shake our fists every now and then and dream of the day when Joss hits that red button, maybe we should take solace in the fact that we have an amazing piece of work that was killed before its time but will always be in our hearts."	t5_2qs24	True

And I would complain about my time there, and every time I’d come in there I’d see Summer doing her thing, kicking something above her head about 60 times. I’d be warming up and doing my stuff, cool down and leave, and she’s in the corner fighting nine guys. And she had to start months before us. She worked really hard .""

Lots of actors would emphasize on how hard they worked but Nathan preferred to highlight Summer's hard training. Very classy and touching!
