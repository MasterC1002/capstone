It's really interesting to hear the back story of the industrial scene, and the bands that lead up to mainstream exposure. All starting with Throbbing Gristle's innovation to start a new genre, to the beginning with Pretty Hate Machine and the end of the NIN chronology with the Slip.

Interviews with a few well informed dudes gives some pretty good insight as to why exactly Trent Reznor is such a groundbreaking artist.  The best thing about it is that it doesn't focus so much on his personal life (actually only skimming over the details). Instead, the documentary sticks to the music, discussing the where it went through the years, some of the thought process behind it, the influence, etc.

I tell everyone who is interested in seriously getting into Nine Inch Nails to start at the beginning.

First of all, as is stated on most albums ""Trent Reznor is Nine Inch Nails"". NIN has always been Trent Reznor's personal outlet for his feelings and struggles at the time of writing, going in chronological order will give you the best idea of his growths, moods, struggles, emotions, etc. The better you know the artist, the better you can understand the art, particularly when it’s such a personal journey.

PRETTY HATE MACHINE (1989) - His pilot project. At the time he was working in a Cleveland music studio doing engineering. The manager would let him use the facility after hours to make his own stuff. He said he was trying to make a pop album at the time, and it does sound much like turn of the decade synthpop. Still, it had a proto-industrial sound. And although the album has the naiveté of someone just starting out, the lyrics were still very dark, a foreshadowing of what was to come.

BROKEN (1992) - Written during his battle with his label TVT and later Interscope over his creativity, themes of slavery and bondage, with the videos becoming even more BDSM oriented. Also Trent was getting hooked on drugs and alcohol. His music got much darker and he began experimenting with dissonance, an influence of industrial founder Peter Christopherson of Coil and Throbbing Gristle, and Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen both of whom he collaborated with during this time. He was even going so far into experimentation as to mess with phasing on the album, hence the warning against listening on mono devices.

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL (1994) - A concept album about a man's descent into nothing. Themes of self-destruction, hate, anger, rebellion, using, ultimately going into hopelessness, misery, and suicide. Trent had already contemplated suicide, and at this time he was an alcoholic and addicted to cocaine, he was stuck in his contract, he had isolated himself in his New Orleans’s and Los Angeles residences. The TDS era is when he was basically hitting bottom. Musically he had perfected ""the beauty of dissonance"" with this album. Grating guitars, de-harmonized syths and found audio all combined to form a darkly masochistic angry sound, interspersed with quiet brooding and ultimately... the bottom.

THE FRAGILE (1999) - Trent's grandmother who raised him had recently died. He was deep into his addiction which had hampered his creativity for five years since TDS. Another concept album, The Fragile was thematically about starting from scratch and building oneself up. Coming to terms with death and defeat, Trent's voice is much quieter and less angry through much of the album. He also became more experimental in his musical structure. Also, having firmly mastered dissonance, harmony began to make its way into his writing.

The next four albums while still personal were much more fan oriented, very collaborative, and were written at a much faster pace.

WITH TEETH (2005) - After two grueling tours to support The Fragile, Trent took a hiatus. He kicked his addictions, got healthy, started exercising and made peace (as best he could) with his label. With Teeth is probably the most rock-radio friendly of NIN's albums. He not only changed his lyrical and writing style but also his musical style. Definitely not as dissonant as his previous works it still had elements of experimentalism, utilizing unpopular and unusual analog sounds. He also became more political. After the world shocking events of 9/11 and the controversies of the Bush administration, songs like The Hand That Feeds hinted at things to come.
 
YEAR ZERO (2007) - The last album Trent wrote under contract. His mind was now clear for a grand project. Year Zero was released along with an alternate reality marketing campaign that started during 2006's With Teeth tour. Painting a picture of a world he believed we were heading for, one with two Americas: The rich and religious oppressing the poor and the minorities. Surveillance, mind control, war, greed, torture, religion, pollution, supernatural intervention, all culminating in apocalypse. A very electronically experimental album yet one still rooted in rock musicality, it reflected Reznor's growing collaboration with Atticus Ross.

GHOSTS (2008) - A completely different concept, this was the first album Trent released under his own label Null. Now that he was free from all restrictions, he and Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder and some of his touring collaborators essentially got together and jammed in the studio as best as an experimental-industrial-electronic-rocker could. Their intention was to make each track as a musical texture. No theme, no lyrics, just to see what they could come up with. After the success of the web based YZ marketing campaign, and after having dealt with major label BS for so long, Trent wanted to release the album to his fans the fairest way possible. The result, was releasing the first fourth of the album for free in MP3 format online, and offering different versions of the complete album for purchase online, each purchase came with a max bitrate MP3 version of the album. With the smallest charge being just $5 for just the MP3 release, $15 cheaper than if the album had been released on iTunes, fans dove into it. The deluxe limited signed edition sold out. Reznor essentially took a major step in changing the game of music marketing and sales in the internet age.

THE SLIP (2008) - With Reznor wanting to move on to other projects (including matrimony) he foresaw the end of devoting all of his time to Nine Inch Nails. The Slip was pretty much a straight forward collection of songs and instrumentals. Somewhat like With Teeth in that there was no overall theme, The Slip was the most broken down and simple of Nine Inch Nails albums. Closing out the twenty year career of ""Trent Reznor IS Nine Inch Nails"" he rewarded all the fans by releasing the entire album online for free in various formats. A limited hard copy printing was also distributed online and through record stores.

In 2009 Trent decided to retire from touring Nine Inch Nails. The final tour consisted of gigs at various NYC, Chicago and L.A. venues across which pretty much the entire NIN catalogue was played.

While this list includes only the studio albums, there have been many soundtrack releases, remix albums, EPs, live performances, and music videos under NIN's ""halo"" numbering schematic. All of which have a story of their own.

Since his hiatus from NIN in 2009, Trent Reznor is now happily married and is a father. He has released music with his wife Mariqueen Maandig, Atticus Ross and his longtime art director Rob Sheridan under the eponym How To Destroy Angels. He has crafted the soundtracks for The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo with Atticus. And is developing a Year Zero based miniseries for HBO. 

But now, in June 2013, Trent Reznor has reignited Nine Inch Nails! A new contract with Columbia records. A new single. An upcoming tour. A forthcoming album. Trent’s journey continues...

**TL;DR: Can't help you there. Can't summarize a summary.**

EDIT: Added dates. Fixed wording.

Painting a picture of a world he believed we were heading for, one with two Americas: The rich and religious oppressing the poor and the minorities. Surveillance, mind control, war, greed, torture, religion, pollution, supernatural intervention, all culminating in apocalypse. A very electronically experimental album yet one still rooted in rock musicality, it reflected Reznor's growing collaboration with Atticus Ross.
 
GHOSTS - A completely different concept, this was the first album Trent released under his own label Null. Now that he was free from all restrictions, he and Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder and some of his touring collaborators essentially got together and jammed in the studio as best as an experimental-industrial-electronic-rocker could. Their intention was to make each track as a musical texture. No theme, no lyrics, just to see what they could come up with. After the success of the web based YZ marketing campaign, and after having dealt with major label BS for so long, Trent wanted to release the album to his fans the fairest way possible. The result, was releasing the first fourth of the album for free in MP3 format online, and offering different versions of the complete album for purchase online, each purchase came with a max bitrate MP3 version of the album. With the smallest charge being just $5 for just the MP3 release, $15 cheaper than if the album had been released on iTunes, fans dove into it. The deluxe limited signed edition sold out. Reznor essentially took a major step in changing the game of music marketing and sales in the internet age.
 
THE SLIP - With Reznor wanting to move on to other projects (including matrimony) he foresaw the end of devoting all of his time to Nine Inch Nails. The Slip was pretty much a straight forward collection of songs and instrumentals. Somewhat like With Teeth in that there was no overall theme, The Slip was the most broken down and simple of Nine Inch Nails albums. Closing out the twenty year career of ""Trent Reznor IS Nine Inch Nails"" he rewarded all the fans by releasing the entire album online for free in various formats. A limited hard copy printing was also distributed online and through record stores.
 
Nine Inch Nails final tour consisted of gigs at various L.A. venues across which pretty much the entire NIN catalogue was played.
 
This list includes only the studio albums. There have been many soundtrack releases, remix albums, EPs, live performances, and music videos under NIN's ""halo"" numbering schematic. All of which have a story of their own.
 
Since retiring NIN in 2010, Trent Reznor is now happily married and is a father. He has released an EP with his wife Mariqueen Maandig and Atticus Ross under the eponym How To Destroy Angels. He has crafted the soundtracks for The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo with Atticus. And developed a Year Zero based miniseries for HBO. And although he has stated he will never again tour under NIN, he has hinted he will release more Nails music in the future...

**TL;DR: Follow Trent Reznor's journey by listening to Nine Inch Nails from start to finish.**

""Sorry for the radio silence lately... I've been busy! There's a number of things to be revealed over the coming months. Some you may expect, others you may not. Patience, my friends.

Today's news is about my band How To Destroy Angels. I'm happy to announce we've formally partnered with Columbia Records for our next series of releases. The first of these will be available in November and it's called An Omen EP. As you may have guessed, it's an EP. It contains six songs, some of which are from our full-length LP which is coming early next year.
We are making some videos, we are going to be performing live, and that's all the details I have for now on those matters.

Regarding our decision to sign with Columbia, we've really spent a long time thinking about things and it makes sense for a lot of reasons, including a chance to work with our old friend Mark Williams. There's a much more granular and rambling answer I could give (and likely will in an interview someplace) but it really comes down to us experimenting and trying new things to see what best serves our needs. Complete independent releasing has its great points but also comes with shortcomings. 

We are all very excited about you checking out the new stuff. Wish I could tell you more, but you know how this works... it would take all the fun out of it!"""	t5_2qhwq	True

In the first half of that section, there's so much depth in the low end, with so many full, round textures.  In the midrange, you have the synth choir floating narrowly side to side in the mix, while the string sample jumps around from side to side with plenty of soft delay, and TR's gentle vocal nestled perfectly into the high-mids.  The highs are largely filtered out, with the vocals being one of, if not the only, things allowed in the frequency range. 

Just as you're taking it all in, TR screams ""And I descend from grace,"" accompanied by the addition of a background 'oooh' in the sonic space of his previous vocal.  The bass is now a quarter pulse, but has lost none of the previous section's depth and fullness.  The roundness of all the textures besides TR's desperation makes it stand out that much more, making it truly the climax of The Fragile."	t5_2qhwq	True

NINwiki states about La Mer: When on stage in 2009 he disclosed that he had rented a house at the time on an ocean with the external intent to write some music, but in reality had contemplated suicide there. This song was the only song to come out of that time and place. He still feels strange playing it live because it serves as a reminder of this dark period in his life.

He then mentions that Adrift and At Peace is like a conclusion to La Mer.

He also mentioned that he was going to get married where he wrote La Mer to Mariqueen in this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USzKCfP6OnY

So now the Ice Age video hits you so much harder. They are in a house on the water, Mariqueen stares out at the ocean from the house with tears rolling down her face saying ""Ocean, help me find a way"".

the video is very haunting. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq3pDuJeMqQ"	t5_2qhwq	True
1350568874.0	11otct	I tell everyone who is interested in getting into Nine Inch Nails to start at the beginning.		59	9	23	"*I had posted this on my old account I deleted, and I wanted to repost it under my new account so it's up here.*

I tell everyone who is interested in getting into Nine Inch Nails to start at the beginning.

First of all, as is stated on most albums ""Trent Reznor is Nine Inch Nails"". NIN has always been Trent Reznor's personal outlet for his feelings and struggles at the time of writing, going in chronological order will give you the best idea of his growths, moods, struggles, emotions, etc. The better you know the artist, the better you can understand the art, particularly when it’s such a personal journey.

PRETTY HATE MACHINE - His pilot project. At the time he was working in a Cleveland music studio doing engineering. The manager would let him use the facility after hours to make his own stuff. He said he was trying to make a pop album at the time, and it does sound much like turn of the decade synthpop. Still, it had a proto-industrial sound. And although the album has the naiveté of someone just starting out, the lyrics were still very dark, a foreshadowing of what was to come.

BROKEN - Written during his battle with his label TVT and later Interscope over his creativity, themes of slavery and bondage, with the music videos becoming even more violent and BDSM oriented. Also Trent was getting hooked on drugs and alcohol. His music got much darker and he began experimenting with dissonance and furious walls of noise, an influence of industrial founder Peter Christopherson of Coil, and Al Jourgensen of Ministry, both of whom he collaborated with during this time. He was even going so far into experimentation as to mess with phasing on the album, hence the warning against listening on mono devices.

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL - A concept album about a man's descent into nothing. Themes of self-destruction, hate, anger, rebellion, using, ultimately going into hopelessness, misery, and suicide. Trent was struggling with suicidal depression, and at this time he was an alcoholic and addicted to cocaine, he was stuck in his contract, he had isolated himself in his New Orleans and Los Angeles residences. The TDS era is when he was basically hitting bottom. Musically he had perfected ""the beauty of dissonance"" with this album. Grating guitars, de-harmonized syths and found audio all combined to form a darkly masochistic angry sound, interspersed with quiet brooding and ultimately... the bottom.

THE FRAGILE - Trent's grandmother who raised him had recently died. He was deep into his addiction which had hampered his creativity for five years since TDS. Another concept album, The Fragile was thematically about starting from scratch and building oneself up. Coming to terms with death and defeat, Trent's voice is much quiter and less angry through much of the album. He also became more experimental in his musical structure. Also, having firmly mastered dissonance, harmony began to make it's way into his writing.

The next four albums while still personal were much more fan oriented, very collaborative, and were written at a much faster pace.

WITH TEETH - After two grueling tours to support The Fragile, Trent took a hiatus. He kicked his addictions, got healthy, started exercising and made peace (as best he could) with his label. With Teeth is probably the most rock-radio friendly of NIN's albums. He not only changed his lyrical and writing style but also his musical style. Definitely not as dissonant as his previous works it still had elements of experimentalism, utilizing unpopular and unusual analog sounds. He also became more political. After the world shocking events of 9/11 and the controversies of the Bush administration, songs like The Hand That Feeds hinted at things to come.
 
YEAR ZERO - The last album Trent wrote under contract. His mind was now clear for a grand project. Year Zero was released along with an alternate reality marketing campaign that started during 2006's With Teeth tour. Painting a picture of a world he believed we were heading for, one with two Americas: The rich and religious oppressing the poor and the minorities. Surveillance, mind control, war, greed, torture, religion, pollution, supernatural intervention, all culminating in apocalypse. A very electronically experimental album yet one still rooted in rock musicality, it reflected Reznor's growing collaboration with Atticus Ross.

GHOSTS - A completely different concept, this was the first album Trent released under his own label Null. Now that he was free from all restrictions, he and Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder and some of his touring collaborators essentially got together and jammed in the studio as best as an experimental-industrial-electronic-rocker could. Their intention was to make each track as a musical texture. No theme, no lyrics, just to see what they could come up with. After the success of the web based YZ marketing campaign, and after having dealt with major label BS for so long, Trent wanted to release the album to his fans the fairest way possible. The result, was releasing the first fourth of the album for free in MP3 format online, and offering different versions of the complete album for purchase online, each purchase came with a max bitrate MP3 version of the album. With the smallest charge being just $5 for just the MP3 release, $15 cheaper than if the album had been released on iTunes, fans dove into it. The deluxe limited signed edition sold out. Reznor essentially took a major step in changing the game of music marketing and sales in the internet age.

THE SLIP - With Reznor wanting to move on to other projects (including matrimony) he foresaw the end of devoting all of his time to Nine Inch Nails. The Slip was pretty much a straight forward collection of songs and instrumentals. Somewhat like With Teeth in that there was no overall theme, The Slip was the most broken down and simple of Nine Inch Nails albums. Closing out the twenty year career of ""Trent Reznor IS Nine Inch Nails"" he rewarded all the fans by releasing the entire album online for free in various electronic formats. A limited hard copy printing was also distributed online and through record stores.

Nine Inch Nails final tour consisted of gigs at various L.A. venues across which pretty much the entire NIN catalog was played.

This list includes only the studio albums. There have been many soundtrack releases, remix albums, EPs, live performances, and music videos under NIN's ""halo"" numbering schematic. All of which have a story of their own.

Since retiring NIN in 2010, Trent Reznor is now happily married and is a father. He has released an EP with his wife Mariqueen Maandig, Atticus Ross and his long time art director Rob Sheridan under the eponym How To Destroy Angels. He has crafted the soundtracks for The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo with Atticus. And is developing a Year Zero based miniseries. And although he has stated he will never again tour under NIN, he has hinted he will release more Nails music in the future...

1373380685.0	1hxq2s	Possibility of Trent Reznor's AMA with the release of Hesitation Marks?	teleekom	46	10	17	It seems kinda like a thing nowadays, doing an AMA to promote new album (clip, movie, whatever..) so I was thinking if there's any chance of Trent doing AMA in the near future to promote his new album. I know he did AMA not so long ago, but that was before he announced Hesitation Marks, tour and everything and I would really like to ask him few qusetions about this. So what do you think? Should we let him know that some people would like to see this happen? 	t5_2qhwq	True

1367375052.0	1dgfie	My interpretation of The Downward Spiral	TrentonJ	42	6	14	"The reason that The Downward Spiral is my favorite album, is because if you listen to each song in order of the albums listing, it's pretty much an entire story of a man's slow spiral into insanity, loneliness leading into dehumanization, sex, drug abuse, and eventually murder. I'll try to tell the story in a nutshell:

An event happens which causes the man to ultimately decide that nothing can stop him because he doesn't care anymore. We assume it's the ending of a meaningful relationship (Piggy). 

Eventually, he loses faith in God and religion in general, and decides he doesn't need religion in his life. He's better off alone (Heresy).

 After this, he realizes how little faith he has in society and realizes that all people are are just selfish animals, he wishes to separate himself from the rest of society (March of The Pigs). 

He cannot trust any women, he is afraid to become close with anybody, but still has a strong desire for sex. So, he has sex with a woman constantly with no commitment (Closer). 

He has a voice in his head that tells him to stop this negativity he's causing on himself, but it's too late, the bad voice has already taken over and tells him that nothing can stop him when he isn't human anymore and can use his own existence to his advantage (Ruiner). 

Over time, he realizes that he is changing into something bad. He's dead on the inside and has no feelings left, therefore his feelings have been replaced with emotionless actions. He is okay with this, it's better than being broken and bruised (The Becoming).

The main cause of his downward spiral is brought up again, he remembers what caused all of this. He again is hurt and starts to feel saddened/angry. His voice takes over again. He becomes angry, he wants nothing to stop him. He wants to feel ultimately powerful like he did in March Of The Pigs. His insanity increases, he doesn't know what to do with himself. So much at once (I Do Not Want This). 

He just.. Snaps. He commits murder with a gun. Violently his built up rage, sadness, and anger is released on an innocent victim (Big Man With a Gun).

He feels calm.. It's out of his system. With this out of the way, he can finally figure out his life. He can finally fix everything. Everything is going to be okay (A Warm Place)

Not exactly.. Slowly, the guilt of what has happened previously kicks in.. He's in denial at first.. But it's there. He knows what he's done, and there's no turning back. He doesn't know what to do with his life. He wants to die, and end it all. He screams to God, begging to be killed due to his strong regret.. Because he is too cowardly to kill himself. He wishes to be erased from the pages of life (Eraser)

Over time.. There's nothing left of him. He couldn't believe how easy it was, how easily his pain and suffering with his life could be ended. It's so simple.. He attempts suicide. However, it's unknown wether he succeeds or fails with his attempt (The Downward Spiral)

Finally.. His final thoughts are brought into play. Depending on if he did kill himself, or if his attempt had failed.. his final thoughts about the entire situation is that he has done nothing but hurt and abuse those around him for the past while. He has nothing to offer the world besides everything that he is worth.. which is nothing. ""If I could start again.. A million miles away.. I would keep myself.. I would find a way."" (Hurt)"	t5_2qhwq	True

The link contains a DL for a .zip'ed file of of mp3s
Some tracks worth noting are:

-Sunspots (never performed s far as I know)

-Home (always a treat)

-Not So Pretty Now 

-Deep (It just sounds REALLY GOOD here)

-Dead Souls 

-Suck (I always preferred this live)

-Piggy

-Right Where it belongs (non-album version)

I've been having a blast listening to them and I figured it'd be worth pointing out.

A guy friend of mine asked me how is it I could masturbate to or get turned on by music. This is what I told him:

&gt;Anyways, about being turned on by a song or music in general:
&gt;
&gt;I'll give you an example: In the song [""Me, I'm Not""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHqm7iVhtEI), the beats are *throbbing*. It's slow, sexual, almost *penetrating* your ears and your mind. You can IMAGINE yourself doing something to someone. A slow sexy striptease maybe? Idk. But he's also *singing* something that can be analyzed as sexual.
&gt;
&gt;He's not screaming, he's sort of speaking in a whispering, slow, sexy, drawn out way. When he says ""And it's hard to bel*ieve*"" he reaches a point where he's practically MOANING the word ""believe"". Like he's orgasming or someone just hit the right spots.
&gt;He sounds vulnerable, and it makes me feel like I'm in control of him. (sounds strange I know). The same thing goes with ""Closer"" except he's in control. But I like to lay in the dark and slowly touch myself to it and that's that.""

For the longest time I've really respected NIN and Trent, but I've never really gotten too into their music. Well, I finally figured, why not! So I did some research and figured that 'The Downward Spiral' would be the best place to start. I got the album, and it's great, but I've listened to it a bunch and I'm ready for what's next. I'm really into the more electronic focused songs on the album, namely Closer (of course), Ruiner, Heresy, Reptile, and a few others (I'm trying not to list the whole album). Which album would you recommend for me next? I also want to throw out their that even though you may or may not consider it cheese, the hand that feeds is fucking catchy and I loved the shit out of that song when it came out.	t5_2qhwq	True

TrentonJ	24	4	66	"My mom named me after Trent Reznor because she was a big NIN fan when she was that age. She listened to a lot of Pretty Hate Machine when I was little, but eventually I think she out-grew it and started to listen to other shit like Christina Agulera and John Mayer. Well, I asked my mom about it when I was about 12, and she said I was named after a guy named Trent Reznor who made music. So, I looked him up. The album artwork of Pretty Hate Machine. I decided to check out a couple songs on YouTube. Head Like a Hole was all too familiar, and nostalgic for me. Instantly loved it, along with Terrible Lie and Down In it. At this point, I liked NIN soley for nostalgia.. Especially Closer. that is.. until my life somewhat went down the shitter. Well, for my age, it seemed like it (even though it wasn't in shit at all. Just mental shit) 

I eventually started high school, got to know a lot of people. Got a girlfriend that I liked a lot. I eventually went to the store and bought ""The Downward Spiral"" because I liked Closer, and Reptile. Wasn't familiar with the rest of the album. Eventually, this girl broke up with me. Threw away everything for some other guy. It hurt me real bad, I felt horrible. I felt like it was my fault, like I could have been better. That night, out of anger and not caring, I threw in The Downward Spiral into my radio and fell asleep to it. I listened to Mr. Self Destruct, and it really related to my anger. Piggy, because I didn't fucking care about anything anymore. 

Eventually, the rest of the album helped me through so much other shit. It helped me realize all of my other problems besides that, mentally. It helped me.

Obviously none can come close, but what are some bands that remind you of NIN or you think would appeal to the same fans? I know of a bunch more, but here are two that especially stand out to me:

**Stabbing Westward** - Easily my favorite of the 90's era industrial bands, aside from their last (self-titled) release, all of their stuff is great.

**The Naked and Famous** - These guys aren't actually industrial, but they named their label ""Somewhat Damaged"" and you can hear the NIN influence in a bunch of their songs. Some moments sound like they were sampled directly from The Fragile or The Slip.

With that said, what is everyone's favourite era?

I'm curious to see if age has anything to do with this.
For me it's Fragility (I'm 23). The combination of AATCHB, the Fragile, Still and then all the live shows including Danny Lohner and Trent having awesome hair.

Plus, I love the little website that was set up for Still, but it seems to have vanished ?

Fe. I love Mr. Self Destruct but there's very little good live recordings of this song on youtube except the Closure (which is insanely great) but it's just the end of the song and the other versions are sort of mixed and weird. Same goes to the Ruiner.

Apparently, the company asked Trent for the rights, but after rightfully refusing due to his artistic integrity, they said ""Fine, we'll just get someone who sounds like you"". 

I'm just wondering where the fuck this commercial is, cause I'm really curious what it sounds like. 

Any ideas?

""Trent: Well, there was a Gatorade commercial. I had a hundred people say ""Why did you do that Gatorade commercial?"" I was like, ""What are you talking about?"" I hadn't seen it.

So I looked into how we can sue these fuckheads. I don't want money. I just don't want them using my song. Well, they changed it a little bit. I remember hearing a commercial and I thought, ""Joe Jackson, I thought he was cool, and now he's done a fuckin' commercial for something shitty."" It was that song, ""Stepping Out"". Someting almost exactly like that, but it wasn't him singing. I remember in an interview he said, ""They approached me to do this commercial, and I said 'absolutely no way'.

I am fairly new to Nine Inch Nails, I have listened to Ghosts I-IV alot lately and I absolutely love it from 1 to 36. Now however, I would like to move on, discover more of their albums, but I have no idea where to start. Is there any 'route' that would be appropriate? I'm asking this because I'm a big fan of Radiohead, if you learn Radiohead in a particular order of albums, you might get the wrong idea of them. I don't want to ruin my idea of Nine Inch Nails. 
Would you have any advice on how to move on?

Thanks in advance 

EDIT: Wow guys, thanks a lot. I never expected so much feedback! :D Most of you seem to suggest going chronologically, that's what I think I'll do. And, I hear Reznor has also made the Soundtrack to The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo? I'll re-watch those two again soon.

There were several moments where I thought ""this is most definitely not NIN"", such as the creepy quiet organ sounds on And the Sky Began to Scream and the glitchy vocals on Too Late, All Gone.

The occasional poppy moments added some refreshing variety that I thought was lacking in An Omen. Obviously all of How Long? falls under this, but also the choruses of Strings and Attractors and Too Late, All Gone.

That said, there were points in the album that I thought it was a little too long. The last four tracks were a bit much to get through. I wonder if a 65 minute album was too long. Not to mention when the vinyl arrives it will be 10+ minutes longer. Also I was disappointed that so much of An Omen was included, especially The Loop Closes, which I thought was kind of boring and lyrically poor.

Favorite tracks:

1. And the Sky Began to Scream

2. Strings and Attractors

3. Too Late, All Gone

The Great Below - I like the mood and ethereal noise.  Calming yet brooding.  Ominous and relaxing at the same time.

The Big Come Down - Gets me pumped up.  Even though it's not a single or well known, I think it stands out.

We're In This Together - The song (along with Happiness In Slavery on Fixed) that got me really into NIN.  You can just hear the shear and urgent desperation in his voice. Reminds me that even Trent can realize a sense of community.  

I hope you enjoy submitting your three.  I want to hear what people think about the songs on the album so maybe I'll think better of some of them.  Over the years and after many, many listens, some of the songs seem more and more irrelevant to me.

* Marilyn Manson, but mostly only his singles... the b-sides are often pretty bland by my tastes... but I loved Kiddie Grinder nonetheless.

* Quite a bit of Rob Zombie's more electronic stuff, and White Zombie's Supersexy Swingin' Sounds

* I've recently started listening to Tim Exile, and have fallen in love with this track in particular: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmw9gsLUHWI

Elements of music that I enjoy greatly are use of obscure time signatures, heavy emphasis on heavy percussion and syncopated rhythm, and non-standard melody. I really like nasty sounding synths, and I have a soft-spot for lofi filters. I like clean (non-distorted, non-verby), but often slightly glitchy vocals. 

So if you know of any artists that really fall in line with what's mentioned above, please let me know :)"	t5_2qhwq	True

I've always taken it to mean that that Thursday was the end of the world ([which is a nice little reference to the Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy, by the way](www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWWiDKKWDQw)), and that the presence ended existence as we understand it because of how bad things had gotten on the planet.

I'm selling it for face value, and you need to be able to meet me at the venue at the early-opening time for the presale. Since my name will be on the tickets, we'll have to go in together.

ZaphodXZaphod	12	2	34	"I've fantasized frequently of certain collaborations - one of the most fabulous ones that fell through was the one with Zack De la Rocha. I was also very disappointed by Perry Farrell's douchebaggery killing the potentially amazing Jane's/NIN collaboration. The talk of Eric Avery, Dave Navarro, and Stephen Perkins working with Trent &amp; friends sounds appealing, though I doubt it will ever materialize - it still seems as though Avery is interested in working with Trent, but that's far less impressive than Jane's + Trent. I'd love to hear Trent work with David Byrne, as well. Ever since HTDA began, I've thought of how awesome Fiona Apple would sound doing vocals on some of those tracks - especially ""Is Your Love Strong Enough?"" I think that if there's another installation of Ghosts, a collaboration with Kevin Shields would be fucking phenomenal. DJ Shadow and Adam Freeland, I think would both be pretty cool collaborations. I'd be interested to see Trent work with Serj Tankian, as well. Devo and Trent, I think would make an awesome duo, as long as it was bitter satirical Devo, rather than kitschy Devo.

1364068966.0	1aviqq	Bear with me here, but what if The Downward Spiral was the sound track to a short film?	natron5000_	23	14	20	"A couple of friends and I were fucking around, listening to The Downward Spiral last night, and as Heresy came on, one of them made a joke about that song making him want to shoot up a school, or a church (he was just being a dick, making fun of the whole 'violent games and music cause criminal behavior' thing) and that's when the idea came to me - The Downward Spiral would make a PERFECT soundtrack to a short film about a person's own rampant story of self-destruction. I started describing what would be in the film, track by track, and my other friend (who had previously shown no interest in the idea) perked up and tuned in. 

So **TL/DR** in advance, **this is just a silly idea for the short film that The Downward Spiral could be a soundtrack to. It's a wall of text, so I apologize ahead of time** 

1. “Mr. Self Destruct”: On a Sunday morning, an overly angst-ridden teenager is becoming taken over by internal primal forces. He is thrashing about his dark bedroom, smashing all of his possessions and acting, well, utterly self-destructive. By the end of the song, the overwhelming impulse to commit atrocious acts of violence has taken over completely, much like the distortion in the song has. Overly angst-ridden teenager has made up his mind. He grabs a set of car keys and makes his way to the garage…
2. “Piggy”: Once inside the garage, he pulls out in an average-looking car and drives coolly and casually as the tone of the song immediately sets in. Our angst-ridden anti-hero looks at the cars passing by, feeling utterly and silently abhorrent towards them, as well as justified for the actions he is about to commit. He nonchalantly passes by a police officer, smiling as he does, only feeling more grandiose about what is about to occur. By the end of the song, Mr. Self Destruct has arrived at a local church nearby…
3. “Heresy”: He walks into the foyer of this place of worship, with an assault rifle strapped to his back and hunting knives sheathed to his belt. He walks with a suave and psychopathic almost dance-like fashion towards the sanctuary as the verse continues along. And when the chorus sets in, he lights them up – everyone. Merciless, and cackling with a sense of twisted retribution, Mr. Self Destruct begins his rampage – his ultimate downward spiral. 
4. “March of the Pigs”: Running out of the building, the slaying of the Christians is over just as quickly as it began. Mr. Self Destruct must escape before the fleet of police cars – the march of the pigs – catches up to him and puts an end to the Golden Spiral of destruction our teenager has initiated. In a string of quick elusive turns getting onto the nearest expressway, and weaving in and out of traffic in his average-looking escape vehicle, the police pull over and arrest the wrong person in a similar car. “Justice” is brought to the city, and now they can all sleep soundly, for everything is alright. 
5. “Closer”: Mr. Self Destruct needs to lay low for a while, and pulls into a strip club right off the expressway. There he finds a dancer he had frequently spent time with, and gets her good and fucked up. They get drunk, he slips drugs in her drink, and they proceed to have questionably-consensual, wildly animalistic and borderline grotesque filthy sex. She lets him violate her, and he feels her from the inside. Again, and again and again.
6. “Ruiner”: After the wild and animalistic, borderline rape session, Mr. Self Destruct comes into a dissociative state of internal dissonance and utter repugnance for that which he dubs to be the ruiner. Is it him? Is it God? Is it the owner of the strip club?..
7. “The Becoming”: …No. Mr. Self Destruct – or rather the resurfacing of the overly angst-ridden that had been consumed – is the problem. But there’s nothing the young lad can do at this point. He is in a state of becoming, and he has been re-circuited. All he can do is sit back and wait, for it won’t give up. It wants him dead. Goddamn this noise inside his head. 
8. “I Do Not Want This”: The teenager enters a reflective state and a state of desire as he realizes there is nothing he can do to overcome Mr. Self Destruct. But even when he feels the desire for alleviation from his control is strong and authentic, Mr. Self Destruct maintains control – don’t you dare tell him just how he feels. 
9. “Big Man with a Gun”: In an effort to make known who is really in control, Mr. Self Destruct sings and acts out Big Man With a Gun, right in the face of the angst-ridden teen. Him and his fucking gun, nothing can stop him now. He’s gonna come all over you, him and his fucking gun. 
10. “A Warm Place”: The teen sits down and enjoys one of his last moments of agency, authenticity, and serenity. He comes to term with his downward spiral, and he knows he has no one but himself to blame. But just as he thinks this, he begins to recall the only other person that had made him feel before. The woman at the strip club…
11. “Eraser”: But as the fond recollection of this woman becomes sheer abhorrence for his own existence, he turns his mind’s eye to her, in a reflection of pure hatred…
12. “Reptile” …He comes to realize that, much like the reptilian woman described in the song, she meant nothing to him. And he meant nothing to her. His beautiful liar, his precious whore – she was all he had left, and now he has nothing. 
13. “The Downward Spiral”: As the joint being – angst ridden, teenaged, Mr. Self Destruct – comes to a moment of beauty, accepting the suicidal fate towards which he has brought himself, he slashes his body with the hunting knives attached to his hips, and shoots himself in the head. 
14. “Hurt”: And as the camera pans away from our anti-protagonist, hurt rings out beautifully and hauntingly in the background.

I'm not able to afford that right now, and I'm sure many others aren't either. So basically I was hoping that together we could make a forum to help people find better prices, offer advice, answer questions, that kind of thing, in regard to the tour and tickets.

For instance, if someone has a ticket and can't attend for whatever reason, maybe use this as a way of selling it? If someone spots a good deal, share it with the other nin fans of reddit? Never attended and want some input on seats vs. ga or wonder what common set lists are? Ask away.

---Email from owner---

Hello,
I'm inquiring to find out how rare the mercer high 1983 yearbook is, and current value. I own one. Obviously it isn't Trent's, but it did belong to a longtime friend of his and former roadie, [name removed]. They graduated same year, and my uncle gave it to me when I was about 13. At any rate, I'm sure you're aware at what original photos are included within, and I am most definitely open to selling it, as I am aware that not many of these original yearbooks are in existence or in circulation. If either you or anyone you know would be interested in purchasing, I will accept any reasonable offer. Contact me via email when it is convenient for you.

Thank you,
[name removed]

Ok, so here are the pics I promised. There are more pics of Trent in here than I thought originally, apparently he was a bit more of a socially active guy than most are led to believe. There are a couple pics I have included that are covered up, because as far as I know they are not currently in circulation (pretty sure they are - Jay), and the same goes for a few more photos in the yearbook that i havent taken pics of, and I will leave it to the future owner of this book to publicize them or not. In the back there is a whole page of senior signatures, and his signature is included in there. It goes without saying, that this yearbook is well worth it to any collector looking to own a real piece of history.

My apologies, but I found something REALLY COOL in here... It's proof of Trent's intentions of developing the trademark NIN logo... It's in the back page where the signatures are. I'm pretty sure his actual sig is in there, but he's also included a little ""Easter egg into the future"" if you will... Check this out...I know it's not something HUGE, but coming from the standpoint of a fan and being someone who loves nerdy little tidbits, I thought that's an awesome thing to share...

I couldn't help but think of year zero and the ARG that went with it and how the protests seem relevant in terms of why they protest and the state of the nation, as well as the feelings of building a totalitarianistic state.

The way the mass media are handling this, the corporations in bed with our government, the attempting of passing SOPA, the wars, the police brutality, it all links up so well with year zero.

Songs like Survivalism, My Violent Heart, The Good Soldier, The Great Destroyer, Capital G, Meet Your Master, and even Zero Sum all sound like Trent predicted this. And lets not forget the ARG events, such as the constant censorship and the police in riot gear showing up everywhere to pacify everyone. The US Bureau of Morality? Almost seems plausible with how crazy the government is getting. I thought it relevant when it first came out, but if this keeps up, his vision of year 2022 may actually become more of a reality than I would have believed at the time.

What do you guys think? Also, do you think any of this will help inspire the legendary ""Year Zero 2""? Trent did say once that the outcome of the few years following the 2008 election would determine what direction he takes YZ2....

ChemicallyCastrated	6	0	6	I'm not sure if I'm asking the right question.  Why is it that any NIN song is always so recognizable?  Is it the key that the song was written in?  The intonation?  It's like when you look at a piece of artwork and you know who the artist is because of their personal style. Like David Carson or Dali. Other than the general theme of NIN's music and their choice of instruments, what am I missing in terms of their compositional stylization?   Am I making sense?	t5_2qhwq	True

1322027861.0	mmfni	What was the best song or show you've ever seen NIN perform and why?	hiero_	7	0	19	"[The Downward Spiral in Noblesville, IN](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNwNrNg8Pk8&amp;list=PLB144D4D23506614C&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plpp_video).

Best song I've *ever* seen performed at any concert I've been to, if only for one reason: During the entire song and the song before it, there was a huge thunderstorm happening which produced a tornado not far from the show. Sirens were going off like crazy in the distance and lightning was flashing everywhere, as you can see at around 2:00 in. The atmosphere was staticy, everyone in the venue was either incredibly panicked or incredibly excited, and all of it just happened to fall right on one of the eeriest and nerve racking NIN songs there is. The tension in the air was palpable as *fuck*.

There really is no other feeling like it. I've never felt like that before and I probably never will again. It was so surreal. But I'm glad I caught it on camera for the most part. 

The tornado sirens aren't in my video, but they started in ""Metal"", and you can hear them VERY clearly at the end of [this sample of Metal](http://www.reflectinginthechrome.com/samples/2009/20090530gladcarrot.mp3).

1376878388.0	1kn2rb	Any way to get to scala? Heartbroken to miss tx. Disabled &amp; havent been to live music for a year	techiebabe	7	2	0	"Hey dudes. I guess those of you who, like me, missed out on Scala tickets, are just as heartbroken.

I havent missed a London NIN date since 99; back in 2005 I wrote about how much their music meant: www.gorge.org/nin 

The thing is, my disability got worse. I used to go to festivals and gigs but no more: I had to take a year out, spent mostly in bed, with accompanying stress for my husband. Now I get help from the council but I still havent been to any live music for a year. This hurts. Music is the one thing that matters, that makes me feel alive...

...and I failed to get a ticket to the Scala.

Can anyone help? I will do anything, so I will spend $150 on a charity of your choice (that is equivalent to 1.5 weeks disability benefit, my only income.)

NIN has literally saved my life at bad times and I would like to help someone in return.

I know Scala isnt fully wheelchair accessible but I will find a way to cope if only I can find a way to get there...

What is gutting is there were fanclub tickets. I left the fanclub (spiral) in 2007 as disabled people were excluded from presales and had to buy separately. No step-free access to a fan meet&amp;greet was the last straw; I left feeling disenchanted. Waste of money as I couldnt access fan events. But now I hear I could have bought Scala tx thru the fanclub! I would have rejoined if only I knew disabled ppl were being included at last!

Please, any help? This sounds sad but im 37 and NIN has been saving my life since I was 13...

Edit: please enjoy my pix from 2009 wave goodbye at London's 02:

1376712439.0	1kj75m	Help? - Orlando 10/31 tickets for sale!	Skreamsayonara	6	1	5	"So, due to financial circumstances (I have to be out of my current house by October 23rd) I will not be able to make the show in Orlando on the 31st. I contacted Ticketmaster, and they cannot refund me because I got my tickets during the pre-sale. However, they did say that I can sell them to whomever I choose, because my name is not on the actual tickets.

So, (unfortunately) I have two tickets for sale for the NIN show at Amway Center in Orlando on October 31st.

I paid $226.25 for them (that's including the Ticketmaster fees) but since I won't be able to go I will sell them both for $170 (no shipping fee, of course). That's $55 off the tickets.

Private message me if you're interested.

If it's not a concept album for TDS, I wonder if it would just be a stand-alone concept album about something else. 

If it's just a regular studio album, I guess Reznor wanted to make it like his older music. "	t5_2qhwq	True

1370643386.0	1fw4g0	The End of Came Back Haunter, Downward Spiral Theme/Motif?	3rdie	14	8	16	"I keep seeing people comment on how the end of came back haunted they hear a variation on the downward spiral theme. I don't hear it at all. Comparing the notes, there isn't any interplay between usage of notes within the same key at all:

Came back haunted: c b, g g#, d# c

Closer: g f, f e, d# d, a# a# a c

The 2 songs are in different keys. In came back haunted, tonic is b, while in closer it's c. If I transpose Came Back Haunted up to C to match Closer, then the notes for that end part would shift up a half step: c# c, g# a, d# c

If you try to play them together in forward or reverse you get dissonance... no real matching up. There's no real mixing of the two.

MY POINT&gt;THERE IS NO DIRECT CORRELATION. I Don't think Trent put the DS motif in this song... but keep your ears peeled later this summer when the album comes out. Maybe another song will have it.
