I then report back to them with the possible problem/solution and they go ""ok... can you fix it?""

""When Oscar Vazquez was 12, his mother smuggled him across the border from Mexico into the US. Vazquez quickly displayed a talent for building things, and in high school he led a group of teenage engineers to a national underwater robotics championship, beating MIT along the way ('[La Vida Robot](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.04/robot.html),' Wired 13.04).

""Last year, after Vazquez graduated from Arizona State University with 'special and unique' honors in mechanical engineering, he asked the federal government to pardon his illegal entry. His request was rejected, and he was barred from entering the US for 10 years.

""It didn’t matter that Vazquez had married an American woman, had an American daughter, and wanted to put his top-notch skills to work in his adopted country. Instead, Vazquez moved back to Sonora, Mexico, where he now lives alone and works as a night manager at a car parts factory."" – Joshua Davis (Wired 18.09)

Here's a [video of him receiving his ASU degree](http://www.schooltube.com/video/4b8a4e66671f5a1a5fa0/Oscar-Vazquez-at-ASU-Graduation) in April 2009 - with President Obama in attendance. The speaker even addressed the problems caused by his immigration status - how he was denied serving in the military, rendered ineligible for govt. scholarships - and how he persevered through hard work. The president stood up and applauded as Oscar’s achievements were recognized.

Mr. President, where are you now?

What can we do to help this man and his family?

Daughter's Friend (DF):  I was going to bring you the game Mystery Date, but I wasn't sure if you would like it.

Daughter (D): How do you play that?

DF: You have to get an outfit and a date with one of the popular boys.  There is also a nerd though.

D: I want the nerd!  Can I get him?

DF: No, no, if you get the nerd you lose!

D: (after a brief pause and a look of disgust) I reject your game and its implications.

Best. Mom eavesdrop. Ever.

EDIT: A little ways down the thread I made mention of some epic barbie disaster movies created by aforementioned daughter.  After careful consideration, and respectfully asking the mini director for permission, I will be posting one of these on Reddit.  I will be realistic and note that this probably won't happen until this weekend, however, that will give you time to purchase popcorn.  Thanks for all the amazing and kind words.  I knew you gals/guys would appreciate this! :D

LordCrap	3409	2126	405	"I just figured it out and since I'm probably not the only one in the situation, I thought it would be a good idea to share. The trick is to follow these 10 steps as soon as you realize you must cancel a print job:

1. Push the cancel button 5-6 times really quickly.

2. Go in printer setting and click ""Pause"" printer, then ""Cancel"" job, then ""Delete"" job, then uninstall printer.

3. At this point, the printer should still be printing so remove all the paper in the tray to make sure it can't print anymore.

4. Turn Off Printer

5. Restart Computer

6. Turn On Printer, put the papers you already printed in the tray so as not to waste paper.

7. At this point the printer will restart printing anywhere from 10 pages up to the entire document you started printing so go back to step #6 every time you run out of paper in the tray.

8. At this point, the reuse of the paper will make the printer jam and temporarily stop the printing process.

9. Turn printer off again, and unplug it.

10. Take it to the backyard and smash it into pieces with your bare knuckles while tears stream down your cheeks.

1261879860.0	aiszf	Sharing is caring: Late Christmas Present, Fresh Bittorent Tracker For Redditors!		1418	238	603	"HELLO REDDIT! We've decided to make a tracker for only Reddit users! Its name is Baconbits.org It's much like the S3 Dropbox that was started on Christmas, where Reddit users can share out of their hearts to the rest of Reddit.

The site does not require a minimum ratio, we trust that most Reddit users will upload as much as possible. The site will only accept Reddit users who have been signed up for at least 3 months, have at least 100 comment karma, and have at least 1 link Karma. We will warn you though if you do go below a .2 ratio. And if you keep deciding not to help out, well then you shouldn't really be on the tracker.

**The only way to sign up** for the site is to PM [Baconbitsinvites](http://reddit.com/user/baconbitsinvites) on Reddit saying invite in the subject and message box. Please only put invite in both. Baconbitsinvite will then check your account for the requirements, and if you pass, he will send you a PM with a link to sign up on the tracker. Then you can enjoy sharing all you want with your Reddit friends! And if you didn't get invited? Wait a couple months more, or get some more Karma.

First, if you don't have an account, create one by using a ~~referral link~~.  This will immediately give you an extra 250MB on top of the 2GB from the free account.

Edit 2: Thanks for using my referral link everone! I'm now maxed out though. Be kind to other redditor friends and use other links like [this one](http://db.tt/CWkQHJO) or [that one!](http://db.tt/ESYczdVW), or possibly even [this third one I'm listing](http://db.tt/sQHi91d4)!!

Second, [take the tour](https://www.dropbox.com/tour).  This will grant you an extra 250MB.

Edit: [goob has stated](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/pm70r/earn_a_ton_of_free_dropbox_space/c3qhrw5) that you need to visit [this page](https://www.dropbox.com/gs) in order to get the free space from the tour.

Next, if you are a student, go to [https://www.dropbox.com/edu](https://www.dropbox.com/edu) and confirm your student email address.  This will double your existing 250MB of extra space (earned by using the referral link), and double any referral space you earn.  Combined with that, use [your referrals](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals) to earn up to an extra 16GB of space! (8Gigs x 2 for the EDU confirmation).

Be a social media whore and use [Twitter and Facebook](https://www.dropbox.com/free) to talk about Dropbox for another 768MB.  You can unlink the apps from your accounts when you are done and the free space will stay.

Finally, install the [recent experimental build](http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=53808&amp;amp;replies=352) posted on the Dropbox forums.  This includes a new photo uploading feature that will give you an extra 500MB on the first photo upload, and an additional 500MB for every 500MB of pictures/videos you upload, up to 4.5Gigs (totaling an additional 5Gigs).  If you don't have many pictures or videos to upload, download [this .rar file](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2814426/img_1559.rar), which will unrar into a 5Gig JPG. You can then drop it into an SD card, pop the SD card into a card reader on your computer, and ""import"" the image into Dropbox.  You can delete all of the images/videos imported and still keep the free space.

If you max out your referrals you should be able to get about 24Gigs on your free dropbox account!"	t5_2qh17	True

1268190408.0	bbev9	RSA encryption has not been broken.	Axiomatik	1427	449	102	"An engadget article recently got hundreds of upvotes on reddit by claiming that RSA has been broken. Engadget may be great for showing you pictures of electronics, but it is far from a scientific publication.

To break an encryption algorithm, you must find a feasible way to produce plaintext given only ciphertext--with NO access to the key.

The article in question was a butchering of a paper about a side-channel attack on a certain CPU. Researchers could discern a key by varying the amount of electricity going to a CPU under certain conditions. That's swell, but it's not at all ""breaking RSA."" Other ways of playing with hardware to recover crypt keys include freezing ram before yanking it out of its socket, and tapping a machine's bus. 

These are essentially hardware hacks. They are not ""breaking (the) RSA (algorithm)."" Your SSL is safe.

The offending article:
http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/09/1024-bit-rsa-encryption-cracked-by-carefully-starving-cpu-of-ele/

More proof engadget is clueless: ""until RSA hopefully fixes the flaw"". Yep, they don't know the difference between RSA the company and RSA the algorithm. Yeesh.

That is all."	t5_2qh17	True

1283651299.0	d9pnc	I made a contest for all redditors; winner gets a prize.	contest	1457	516	329	"It is made using nested TrueCrypt volumes in which the solution to the given clue is the password to the next ""layer.""  You can find the first layer [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?82tsj7dzxlt70rz).  The password for the first layer is reddit.

All passwords are one word, all lowercase, with no numbers or symbols.  Many of the clues will require knowledge of math, science, and computers to solve (hence being posted in /geek).  All clues can be solved using FREE software or websites; in fact, many will *require* software or websites.

Feel free to collaborate, though you must realize that there can be only one winner.  I'm not sure how long it will take to solve all seven clues, but I think the prize for the winner should be $.25 per upvote.  What do you think?

If everyone gets stuck on one particular clue, I'd be willing to steer you all in the right direction.  Good luck, and have fun.

**Edit:** I wasn't sure how hard to make this...maybe I went a bit overboard.  First clue is a simple substitution cipher.  Obviously the spaces are missing.  You have to find a freeware program that will solve the cipher and find the spaces.  Clue number 2 and 7 may be equally devious, so beware.

As to the prize, I originally thought money was a bit tacky.  I thought of all the layers which led me to Inception, but I also thought reddit was over run w/ Inception posts.  Per SquareWheel's request, I'd be up for buying Inception on Blu-Ray for the winner if everyone else is.

**Edit:**  Bed for me.  Also, people were complaining that the prize was money, and now they are complaining that it's not.  Maybe the winner can decide what they want, though I'll probably have to implement a cap on a monetary prize.

**Edit.**  Glad you all liked it, as of 8:38 am central, 17 users have completed the puzzle.  I'm contacting the first place redditor to verify they didn't cheat and to negotiate a prize.

First Place: Self-actualization, 2:11am

Second Place: origin415, 2:33am

Third Place: mattbot5000, 2:37am

**Edit:** Self-actualization indeed completed the contest without cheating...still negotiating a prize.  Here are the solutions for everyone who is interested and is too lazy to piece together all the individual comments.

clue 0 - password was reddit to weed out any non-redditors

clue 1 - simple substitution cipher with spaces removed.  I used [Decrypto](http://www.blisstonia.com/software/WebDecrypto/) to create and test the cipher.  The decrypted message is a quote from Einstein; einstein is the password.

clue 2 - latitudes and longitudes in decimal degree format with the decimals missing.  Leads to Tuzla Island; password is tuzla.

clue 3 - no one that I saw did this correctly, though the got the same answer.  If you know how to do the magic eye pictures, try it with clue 3.  The word ""nothing"" pops out and is the password.  Most other people just overlapped the images in gimp and saw that ""nothing"" was shifted over.  I know we are all sick of 3D, but I think this effect is pretty cool.

clue 4 - an RNA sequence.  Use an RNA-&gt;amino acid chart to find the sequence.  Spells matthaei, the last name of one of the discovers of the genetic code.

clue 5 - picture of a sea cucumber.  use a site such as tineye to reverse look up the image and find out that the genus is enypniastes.

clue 6 - sorry about this one.  The RGB values of each color should be (1,1,2) (3,5,8) (13,21,34) (55,89,144) which is the fibonacci sequence.  some people reported that the colors on their computers did not match this and I am not sure why.  fibonacci is the password.

clue 7 - I tried to make this easy, but I think I made it way too obvious.  The reddit icon was only 38x46 pixels, but the file size was about 20 MB.  You needed to realize that there was a hidden file that could be revealed by unzipping using 7zip etc.  This led to another picture file with the word brobdingnagian, which, by definition is anything of colossal size (and is an awesome word to say).

This led to a txt file with the official reddit contest email address.

Thanks to all who participated; I'll try to think of more potential layers to create a new code sometime in the future."	t5_2qh17	True

Rogue and the blackbird were moving at significantly different speeds, yet Nightcrawler appeared next to Rogue and then back in his seat in the blackbird without any motion relative to either body. This makes nightcrawler insanely powerful! 

For example: he could potentially grab an enemy, teleport with them in any direction a half step, but exit the teleport at enormous speed, then teleport again to mitigate his own speed, thereby sending enemies flying to their doom without even throwing so much as a single punch.

I just sat and listened, he would pause every now and then - hoping for a response. When I wouldn't give a response, he would continue talking about how dangerous the internet is and that I needed to listen to him to get rid of them.  

I put my phone on speaker (I was driving with four other computer literate people) and  
I said ""Please help me, I want these viruses gone and I want my computer to be safe"".  
He says ""Okay, go to your normal screen, your regular screen"".  
I say ""I am there, I am at my normal screen - what do I do"".  
He says ""Click on your start button, it is a button that says start"".  
I say ""I own an Apple computer and I have no start button""  
He says ""Click on start on your normal screen""  
I reiterate ""I own an Apple, I have no start, I know you are lying to me""  
He says ""You do not own a PC?""  
I say ""I own an Apple computer and I know you are lying and a scammer""  
He says ""Are you sure you don't own a Windows computer?""  
I say ""Yes, I am positive""  

He then mumbled something and hung up.

SugerBum	1118	384	415	"I came across this post and thought it deserved more attention. http://www.reddit.com/r/Administrators/comments/bmwy5/scam_alert_compufirm_canada_doesnt_pay_its/ I hate companies that think they can take advantage of people. This Jason Gudmundson guy sounds like a real slimeball. Is there anything we can do as redditors to help here?

EDIT: It looks like [Jason Gudmundson found this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10i540?context=1) already and is defending his company.

Edit2: The owner of Compufirm is [threating llnk with legal action and prosecution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10ijk0?context=3)

Edit3: [Compufirm is suing llnk's company for slander](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10ix7e?context=3) for what Redditors have said!

Edit4: Four more redditors have come forward saying they've been scammed by Compufirm/Jason Gudmundson: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Administrators/comments/bmwy5/scam_alert_compufirm_canada_doesnt_pay_its/c0t3sq5) [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10i1lo)  [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10ib5t) [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10jnn8) - Something has to be done about this guy! Are there any redditor lawyers in Alberta who are willing to take on a class action lawsuit?

Edit5: Someone has setup a [twitter](http://twitter.com/compufirm_scam) account to help spread the word about Compufirm's scams!

Edit6: Tell Compufirm how much you love them by submitting a review on [JobVent!](http://www.jobvent.com/compufirm-canada-job-reviews-C9804?searchType=company&amp;searchText=compufirm)

Edit7; Steve and Compufirm's lawyer are flying to Vancouver on monday to sue llnk and serve him with papers. [Here is llnk's reply to their email.](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/direk/compufirm_canada_hires_private_contractors_to_do/c10lwqf?context=3)

Edit8 Jason Gudmundson from Compufirm Canada has deleted his reddit account and all comments. Luckily llnk grabbed a pdf of this thread just in case that happened. Jason used the following usernames: **Compufirm, jasiojd, and flowone**. [You can download the pdf from here.](http://filevo.com/uqq6oobhzdj9.html) If you're considering doing business with Compufirm in the future, please read the pdf and decide for yourself if this is the type of company you want to do business with. 

**Edit9** [llnk reposted this link in /r/reddit.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/djig2/compufirm_canada_hires_computer_technicians_as/) Please upvote so it gains more attention.


**Edit10** Justice has been served! Compufirm has finally paid llnk! [Read more about it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Administrators/comments/dligg/compufirm_canada_buckled_under_pressure_and_paid/)"	t5_2qh17	True

During the trailers everything was normal until one trailer came up and I was like, Romance movie? that's weird to show during the hobbit premier, not really their key demographic.  Then all of the sudden the words ""Based on a book by Stephanie Meyer"" were projected on screen.  I'd have to say about 90% of the audience let out a groan at the same time. I don't think most did it to be mean, that was just their reaction and all of them were fairly quiet but when combined it was so loud that everyone noticed we all had the same reaction and burst out laughing for the remainder of the preview.  It was quite entertaining and I felt I knew this was going to be a good movie experience. "	t5_2qh17	True

//* email chain between myself and dropbox *// 

Dropbox,

First off, thank you for being awesome, As an IT consultant I've gotten a few of my clients to adopt Dropbox Teams and retire their aging office servers being used entirely for just file sharing, and as a bonus - untethering them from the shackles of their small offices. Personally, I use dropbox on my PC, my mobile phone, my ipad, everything, it's made life simple, less stressful, relaxing - not unlike a daily digital massage...

And it is to that last point that I am emailing you.

Recently I have noticed my storage has hit 23.9 GB, this is a the result of both my dropbox evangelizing, my desire to test the new shiny, and most importantly, the completionist in me which derives from my obsessive-compulsive disorder. This last point is my current issue, see the 23.9 is great, but it has that .9 on the end, which taunts my OCD as it is just begging to be rounded up, pleading with the server for a small mathematical blessing.

Therefore, I hereby submit to dropbox a medical request, that you increase my dropbox to a nice, round, even number.

With Respect,
*REDACTED*

Hi *REDACTED*,

Thanks for referring your friends and colleagues to Dropbox!
I was able to round your storage up to an even 30 GB.

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Best Regards,
Robert

TLDR: Dropbox is full of both win and awesome.

EDIT:  People don't seem to get the sarcasm in the title... Dropbox rocks.

Then you introduce this garbage-ware ""Adobe Download Manager"" and essentially force users to download it in order to install Adobe Reader or Flash Player. 

Sure there are round about ways of getting downloading Adobe Reader or Flash Player with out the DLM but the vast majority of users don't know this and will unknowingly (click, click, click) install this software. You know this full well and it is your expectation that users will download and install it. But we do NOT want this software installed. Why you people continue to shovel garbage (browser toolbars bundled with your already bloated apps) onto our computers is beyond me. You must certainly realize the impact this has on your (tarnished) brand name. 

I openly ask you, Adobe, please come to your senses and stop the distribution of the Adobe DLM (download manager) and bundling of Google Toolbar (yes, I know we can easily opt out) with your software. It makes you look like a $2 whore with no brain or a dirty used car salesman trying to steal the wallet out of our back pockets with your sleazeware."	t5_2qh17	True
