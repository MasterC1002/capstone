1294900902.0	f1emn	[Announcement] With your approval, I would like to transform this subreddit into a great community	MercurialMadnessMan	607	216	116	"/r/pics is the largest of all the subreddits here on this site, with a whopping 500K subscribers.

/r/pictures has a mere 10K subscribers, and the moderator doesn't appear to be an active member of the community anymore.

By upvoting this post, you are supporting me so that I may ask the admins to be a moderator here, and to renovate it towards my vision.

*****

The goal:

&gt;I have long been fascinated by the potential of reddit's wonderful code. This place is amazing. It's a social experiment that is working pretty well, but we need to step up our game and be smart about how we organize our communities. The admins allow and encourage us to create and build and discuss things like this, but people don't really do that.

&gt;Reddit is quickly becoming one of the most trafficked websites on the internet, around the globe, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In my opinion, the largest subreddit--/r/pics/--is moderated insufficiently, and with policies that are either insufficient, or not enforced. Personally, I don't feel safe opening links there when I am browsing in public, due to the lax stance on NSFW content. I also constantly wish that my reports meant something, and that policies were enforced. For the amount of people who view links there, I really feel like it has gotten out of hand, and this is an experiment to see if anyone is interested in a more controlled and logical approach to organization, discussion, and civility. My policy on similar-subreddits will help keep this place have fresh interesting content, and it will also help grow and populate smaller subreddits who are larger than my 2K threshold. I honestly believe this experiment could revolutionize reddit, by focussing on categorization and policies, and it will also help wonderful communities here grow. 

*****

These are the rules that would be used by the subreddit if I became moderator:

* Derivative posts should be kept within the comments of the original post. If the post is simply derivative of another post and belongs in the comments of that post rather than on it's own post, it will be removed.

* Copycat titles will not be tolerated. 

* This is a SFW subreddit. Content deemed NSFW by moderators or users will not be tolerated, even if labelled.

* Vague titles will generally not be tolerated. Titles are a descriptive heading that helps recognize a link, identify the contents of a link, recognize a repost, and greatly help users find the post again using search.

* Direct image links are preferred (if the original source of an image can't be found), as links to webpages can be deemed as 'blogspam'. Tineye.com can help you find the original source of an image, or larger resolutions.  Watermarks are allowed, as long as they are not large, and do not take away from the image.

* Links which are deemed as far too relevant to a particular subreddit with over 2K subscribers will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to /politics, /gifs, /worldnews, and /photocritique. A list of related subreddits will be created in the sidebar.

* Self-posts will generally not be tolerated. Text-only images will not be tolerated. 

* Spam will not be tolerated.

Violations of these policies in the sidebar will result in your submission being removed from the listings, which you may attempt to appeal by messaging the moderators. Multiple abuses may result in a ban from the subreddit. These will be warned ahead of time, and avoided where possible.

Moderators:

* No moderator is permitted to moderate any subreddits with a larger number of subscribers. This policy is to keep moderators fresh-blooded, uncontroversial, and focussed on their responsibilities.

* Moderators are required to message a user the specific reason if they are banned from the subreddit.

* Moderators will be sworn in with a boilerplate comment that promises the users they will act according to their responsibilities, or face the consequence of removal. Nominations will occasionally be made to acquire a new moderator. No more than 10 moderators will ever coexist (subject to change at 100K subscribers).

Users:

* When you report a submission, if the reason is not extremely obvious, please make a comment that describes the issue. 

* Your participation is valuable. Please submit, vote, and comment. Please follow rediquette.

Policies will be linked from the sidebar, and a large effort will be made to notify you if any of the policies change.

The stylesheet of this subreddit may change.

Feel free to leave questions or comments below. This post will not be edited unless explicitly noted in an 'edit' below.

Edit1: point 5 was edited to express preferability to original sources of images, as per `nebopolis`'s suggestion below

Edit2: `Band_B` pointed out ambiguity in what I meant by 'ban'. That part has been revised.

Edit3: `raldi` has suggested that I replace the word 'ban' with 'remove from the listings' to clear up the ambiguity.

Edit4: `raldi` has notified me that a submission should not be reported if a comment has been reported, due to the way they factor into the spam filter.

Edit5: `CrasyMike` has suggested that instead of a 7 day period limit for derivative posts, I should use a judgement-call type of policy. It has been replaced above.

Edit6: Thank you for your support. Hueypriest has instated me as a moderator. I will try my best to keep this place sane. When my goals are reached and this subreddit is in a stable state according to my vision, I will remove myself as moderator.

Again, thank you."	t5_2qhwd	True
