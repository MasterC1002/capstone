1352235009.0	12r09k	Something I REALLY hope they improve with ES6: Thieving	bigsol81	77	5	23	"Okay, I like that enemies can find you, then lose track, search for a bit, and assume you left the area. That's fine.

I don't like that I can shoot someone in the head, they look for me, then say ""Must be my imagination."" with a fucking *arrow* sticking out of their head!


**Stealth Mechanics**

* If an NPC sees an ally get shot down, be it by magic or an arrow, that NPC should go into a permanent ""on alert"" status unless calmed via magic. The same goes for finding the corpse of an ally.

* If an NPC is injured by an attack, it should take a much longer time for them to leave their alert status.

* NPCs should have much, much less detection ability for things behind them. Getting a backstab with a melee weapon is very difficult. With 60+ sneaking, I still regularly have enemies ""notice"" me when I'm still well outside of melee range even without wearing armor.

**Tools for Thieves**

* Allow the player to set mechanical traps for NPCs to blunder into. Magic shouldn't be the only method for laying traps for enemies.

* Grappling hooks and climbing ropes. Daggerfall's wall climbing ability was fantastic and should see a return. Adding in the ability to break into buildings through windows and balconies this way would be an added bonus.

**Thief Mechanics**

* Get rid of the stupid ""stolen item"" flag for merchants. If I steal some silver bars in Markarth and then travel to Solitude, those merchants aren't going to have a clue where I got the silver from, and no idea that it's stolen. I should only need a fence if I'm selling something illegal or exceptionally famous like an artifact.

* Put more valuable items in upscale homes. One thing I used to love in earlier games was breaking into upscale homes and stealing silver goblets, plates, etc., jewelry, and other high-price items to fence.

* More elaborate ""underworld"" type activities. The thieves guild is all fine and dandy, but it just feels like another group of quest-givers. The option to start up your own criminal empire or get involved in ongoing organized crime would be a plus.

* Smuggling: Have some gate guards randomly stop you and search you, with the appropriate options for talking your way out, bribery, etc. Allow you to make money by smuggling Skooma and other drugs from one town to another."	t5_2s2ja	True

Ever since I was able to get on the rooftops in Bruma, I've been wanting the ability to fight from them and sneak along them. So, in ES6, I would really love to see the gameplay options start to change with how many points you have in agility. If you have high agility, you get movement options similar to Assassin's Creed. You can climb to roofs, kick off walls, and jump over people's heads.

So then please, stop with these posts saying, ""This game sucks!"" when you have not even played it. I could have said Colonial Marines will be awesome before it came out. Anyone could have, noone had played it.

I could say this new tomb raider will be the worse then Colonial marines, but again, I and no one else has played it.

And so all I ask is that you pass your judgement when it's actually valid, if beta rolls around, you play it and you hate it, then complain. But when you barely know more the two paragraphs worth of info about about a game you have no ground to stand on for saying, ""The gameplay sucks"" ""The lore sucks"".

RubikL	65	17	16	"In my early days of Skyrim (on the 360) I found myself regularly frustrated with the weakness of starting characters. Sometimes, I want to roleplay an experienced badass, and besides leveling exploits, there really just isn't a way to do this that doesn't interfere with the gaming experience.

Recently, I acquired Skyrim on my PC and found a way to transfer saves from the PC to the 360. **SO**, if any of you pm me with a request for a character (including desired stats, equipment, spells, etc.) then I will provide you a save and instructions for how to transfer the save onto your 360.

If you have any questions or clarification, please ask! I hope this makes somebody's Skyrim experience a bit more fun.

Edit: I've encountered a problem with Skyrim's character creation menu, where I cannot finish the creation process and assign a name for my character. It simply wont allow me to click on the ""okay"" button. Until I find a solution to this, all character requests are on hold. I apologize for the inconvenience, and I'll try to have this fixed ASAP.

**ALSO,** whether or not I am able to resolve this issue, I will be posting an in-depth guide for this process later in the week. Thank you everybody for the upvotes and the requests (there have been some interesting ones). "	t5_2s2ja	True

For instance, take the Ebony Blade: 
According to the [Admonition Against Ebony](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/admonition-against-ebony), the blade should drive its wielder mad.  I think it would be really cool if randomly and only on rare occasion, your screen would go red and get that focused look where the edges are blurred out, and everybody around you would disappear.  Then, Dremora would start spawning from Oblivion and begin to attack you.  You are forced to defend yourself, but are unable to switch from using the blade until this ordeal is over, possibly lasting 30 seconds or longer.  Once the screen returns to normal and you snap out of your delusion, you see that what were once dremora were really just NPC's and a few guards.  Now you have a bounty on your head and need to run, or pay the price.  To onlookers you were just standing in line at the fish vendor when somebody looked at you funny and BAM--you started rampaging through town.

It might seem unfair or tiresome, but that is what used to make TES games so great...consequences!  Why is it that everybody but me goes mad when they use this sword?  If I want to be a badass wielding the weapon of a Daedric prince, I need to be ready to accept the consequences.

Of course this would require a few tweaks but I think it would make for a much more immersive game.  Any thoughts on this?  "	t5_2s2ja	True

**ORIGINAL POST:**

Hi /r/ElderScrolls 

-----

I hope you'll get a kick out of this project. For over a year I've been working on **FRONTIERS,** a first-person exploration/survival game inspired partly by games like *Daggerfall* and *Oblivion.*\* It aims to deliver a relaxing experience that focuses on **exploration** above all else.

- [Here's a trailer, see what you think!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUOImZi1jlc)
- [And](http://i.imgur.com/7DKR1NR.jpg) / [Here](http://i.imgur.com/1JjKx2p.jpg) / [Are](http://i.imgur.com/9n5pjpR.jpg) / [Some](http://i.imgur.com/DwXgFZa.jpg) / [Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/lKTapQD.jpg)

Today I'm launching an [IndieGoGo campaign](http://igg.me/at/frontiers/) to finish this sucker by January 2014. I've been working out of pocket but that has become unsustainable - it's down to shelving it forever or getting it crowdfunded. (But that whole sob story is on the campaign site so I'll spare you the repetition.)

When I started this game I had no clue if there was an audience for it but the reaction on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=145690935) and other places has been a relief - apparently I'm not the only one who's been daydreaming about a game like this.

If YOU'RE one of those people - if you **LOVE** exploration like I do - go pledge!

\*Note: *I skipped Morrowind because even though it's awesome, FRONTIERS isn't anywhere near that weird. Don't get me wrong it has its moments. But nothing like riding a Silt Strider.*

/r/ElderScrolls Message:

This is a cross post but I've got a request for you guys in particular. One of the things I like about ES players is their strong opinions about exploration. Questions like *what makes exploration fun or tedious?* and *is a pure exploration game possible?* can start a debate fifty comments deep.

If you're passionate about some feature or other you have a chance to nudge the game in that direction. Post your thoughts here or on the [Steam Greenlight discussion page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/145690935) and I'll consider them carefully.

I obviously can't implement everything - ideas conflict, there's only so much time &amp; of course I have my own vision for the game - but every idea or opinion helps inform that 'perfect' exploration game I've been shooting for.

Artistic interpretation of the island is replaced with duplication. In the pursuit of a perfect replica, the whole world has entered the uncanny valley.

* Players talk about the wonders of the original game, but it is from memory and imagination. We remember a lush or swampy or volcanic or mushroom clad island. But playing the game required imagination! The fact of the matter is that computers weren't powerful enough to recreate everything and Bethesda required the player's imagination to fill in the blanks, as all games do.

* And yet our standards have increased with technology. Looking at Morrowind recreations don't you ever say to yourself *that's too accurate, they could have taken some artistic license.* 

---

* Vvardenfall was almost destroyed by the eruption of Red Mountain.  Azura destroyed the tribunal.  The Argonians invaded.  House Telvanni was eliminated and slavery ended.  Vivec city got blasted by an asteroid and the ministry of truth collapsed into the water! The place has taken so much damage and we have to accept that. We can't ever go back.

* And yet, there are so many opportunities to revisit the island as it stands now!  

* We should be asking ourselves: *Did the Nerevarine really make the right decision to destroy the heart or Lorkhan? Why didn't he search for opportunities to restore the Tribunal's power and remove Dagoth Ur from Red Mountain? Why did Azura conspire to ruin the tribunal?* These questions have answers, and we must investigate. 

* Impoverished dark elves have fled to Skyrim, but what of the homeless and broken elves on Vvardenfell? They are a people without a land to call their own anymore - their homes are destroyed and they live under occupation. Doesn't that sound familiar to anyone? Isn't it ripe for exciting storytelling?

* What will you do for the people of the island, solidify the occupation by the Argonians, seek revenge for the Telvanni, perhaps help the poor rebuild their lives, or maybe reveal Azura's conspiracy and the Nerevarine's mistakes.

1366509342.0	1crz8b	Idea for TES: 6- making horses more useful	Jimwize	48	9	28	"I have several ideas to actual make horses important, useful, and less expendable.

1. Fast travel can only be done with a horse
I find that while fast travel is useful, it can make things a little too easy and is a little over powered in terms of being able to magically teleport anywhere. So I suggest that horses should become essential to go to other cities and areas. 
    So you'd have to wait to finally earn your way to getting a horse by some means to be able to travel far in the beginning of the game. This would also make the horse be something to guard, protect, and care about instead of something that makes you move a little faster.

2. be able to mount chests and sacks on horses.
    This would make the horse also be able to be used as extra storage, though there would be some limits. Some may include it taking a little longer to fast travel, limited chests on some types of horses, a whole weight system for the horse, etc. 

3. Different breeds of horse with different stats
    Now, I don't want to make this horse sim: skyrim edition. I just want several different kinds of mounts that are good for different things. Like a slow, large horse that can carry a lot of stuff and take hits, but is very slow, or a llama like creature that can carry a ton of stuff but is slow and weak. I feel like this would add a layer of depth to mounts that hasn't been seen yet.

4. (mostly about fast travel) Some risks that come with fast travel

    I feel that the series could have some risks and rewards with the fast travel system that could be extremely interesting. These would work through occassionally emerging from travel on the ground, to be helped up by a stranger who tells you he found you passed out on the ground after some bandits ran off with x amount of gold. A new quest would start about reclaiming your stolen goods and hunting the bandits down, possibly getting even more goods or failing to locate them and losing gold. Little quests like these would make it more exciting and make you think twice about fast travel.

1352168012.0	12pdqf	Magic is starting to go downhill in TES... x-post from r/skyrim.	darkheart86	46	8	39	"I'm just going to throw in my two cents and raise a discussion about magic in Skyrim. If you've played Oblivion, Morrowind, or any of the other games, you might have an idea of what I'm talking about. 

While magic has been balanced greatly compared to the other games, I can't help but wonder if there could have been much more done to improve it.

For those who do not know, previous elder scrolls games all had a ""cast"" button before Skyrim made each spell equip to hands. While this made mages constantly have to press a bumper or a secondary button rather than the primary attack, it gave battlemages more diversity. You could wield magic while still having a shield or a two-handed weapon equipped, and you could still block with any weapon. My mage uses a shortsword in case of magicka burn, and it really helped. I think the idea of using hands to equip spells was a good idea, but there were just too many weapon and action restrictions in my opinion.

Another problem I had was the low number of spells. Alteration was only useful for flesh spells, and there was pretty much a very small amount of spells for each school compared to the other games.

**To justify, here's a list of some (but not all) spells in Oblivion that were not in Skyrim.**

-Absorb Life/Magicka/Stamina/Attribute

-Wound

-Water Walking

-Charm (Made NPC's like you more)

-Cure Disease

-Dispel (got rid of negative spell effects)

-Encumber (Lower's enemy's max carry weight)

-Elemental resistances

-Unlocking Spells

-Long-Range Soul Trapping

-Bound Armor

-A long list of Summons including but not limited to Scamps, Daedra Spiders, Daedroths, Ghosts, and Skeletons


The list is a lot longer, and there are some spells I'm sure I can't remember right now. My point is, there's not a lot of spells in Skyrim compared to the other games (you should try levitation in Arena and Daggerfall.)

There's also the fact that Skyrim is the first game in the Elder Scrolls series to not feature a Spellmaker. This was where you named your spell, chose the effects, radii, elements, and school of any spell you wanted, you paid a fee based on its power, and if you met the requirements to learn the spell, Voila! It's yours. I understand the graphical limitations of the game engine might have been to heavy, but still, the spellmaker was an important part of TES for me as a magic player.

Overall, I think they really devalued magic in Skyrim as opposed to the other games. I just didn't have as much fun as a mage in this game as I have all the others. I think the removal of several useful spells along with the functionality, not to mention the complete removal of the Mysticism school (Yes, I found that school to be useful) made the use of magic boring, and somewhat problematic with my use of a backup sword. Thoughts? Comments? I haven't seen a good discussion on magic so far, and I was hoping other mages out there thought the way I do on this subject.

**TL;DR: Skyrim's magic system is very primitive compared to the other 4 games in the series, with no spellmaker, a general lack of many useful spells in the past games, and the way it doesn't mix well with two handed weapons, shields, or any playstyle other than mage for that matter. Thoughts? Opinions? I'd like to discuss.**

Would it still feel like elder scrolls if you couldn't interact with every person/enter every home?		45	10	17	"I made a comment about this in /r/skyrim and wanted to see what this community thinks. 

Do you remember first hearing about the bustling cantons of Vivec? Or the splendor the Imperial City? If you're like me, you were disappointed when you finally got there. They felt so barren. 

Picture this instead: you're in a small village and you hear talk about a grand capital city. You decide you have to see it and travel across hill and vale to get there. You finally arrive, walk through the city gates- and you're met with *throngs* of people. (picture Assassin's Creed 2's Italian cities for reference) All different races, some alone, some clustered in groups, all going about their daily business. Nobles traveling together, the fighter's guild in their full armor stomping around, thieves slinking in alleys. The crowd noises that you currently hear outside taverns would suddenly make sense, as there would be enough people to create such a din. 

Picture that same city housing hundreds of buildings- if someone asked you ""have you been to [the cloud district]?"" he'd be talking about an actual separate neighborhood, with dozens of homes distinctly different from the homes down by the docks or by the east wall or what have you.(Again, picture the different burroughs of Rome in AC: Revelations to see how this can be done effectively.) Something like Whiterun's ""Grey Quarter"" could be an actual slum, instead of a single alley with a few Morrowind banners hanging limply from the walls.

Of course, the downside would be that it wouldn't be feasible to talk to every person, or enter every building. For some people, this is the appeal of Elder Scrolls games and that's where the immersion lies for them. But  many of the people you talk to in the series don't have a dialogue tree anyway, just a series of random greetings they can spit at you. And many homes are more or less identical inside. So i really don't feel like you'd be missing out on that much if those are your areas of concern. 

There'd have to be a (hopefully) subtle way to tell which people and buildings you can interact with, though I don't know what that might be. And of course the level of detail in NPCs would have to be lower, as they are in the AC series. But i feel like these drawbacks would be worth it in order to feel like you're in a living, breathing city. 

(I don't mean to emphasize AC too much in terms of gameplay or anything like that, I just think it's a good model for what I have in mind, and what I've always wanted in an ES game.)"	t5_2s2ja	True

If there's anything that just makes the gameplay or anything better, I'd be all ears.  Maybe just something you really like and would never play without?

Any advice on a character build for a first time player?  I seen to remember enjoying sneaky builds in Oblivion, but that playing a magic based character was a pain, I haven't messed with the TES class system in several years.  In Skyrim I have a few characters who are all over the map, and they're all fun in their own way.  I don't want to start a build that makes things harder for me to get through the game, since what I'm really interested is the story and just exploring.

So here's what's bothering me...

Uriel Septim set in motion the fulfillment of the Nerevarine prophecy by tracking down someone who met the criteria for being the Nerevarine and sending him/her to Vvardenfell, the main region of Morrowind.

All well and good, but the prophecy states fairly confidently that the Nerevarine will drive the Empire out of Vvardenfell. So why did he do it? What did he hope to achieve? Either the prophecy is false and nothing happens, or it's true and various undesirable things occur.

The Empire loses traction in Morrowind as all the Dunmer - Great House and Ashlander alike - unite. The Empire's main in-road into the belligerent province had been the fact that its ruling Great Houses disliked and distrusted one another, and the Ashlander tribes distrusted everyone. When they unite behind the Nerevarine (as an essential part of the prophecy), suddenly Morrowind is no longer a fractured province but instead a cohesive power bloc with rekindled national and racial pride.

Additionally the Imperial Cult (the Nine Divines etc), which is already an interloper in Morrowind, suddenly risks seeming like so much unfounded superstition in the face of the demonstrable return of Nerevar - tangible validation of traditional Dunmer faith. It's possible that the Nerevarine would cast down the corrupt Tribunal religion, but not in favour of the Imperial Cult, surely?

The only way I can see the Empire gaining from all of this is if the Nerevarine feels indebted to it for sending him/her to Morrowind in the first place - which seems a slender justification for this reckless and potentially severely damaging course of action.

Was Uriel just losing the plot?

1351965850.0	12kmkv	What I really want for ES:VI and how the latest game (Skyrim) compares to the classic Daggerfall.	bigsol81	32	3	24	"I've noticed that they seem to ""dumb down"" the game with each new release. Daggerfall had it right. Lots of skills, lots of weapon/armor/clothing variety, custom spells, alchemy, etc. Let me make a comparison between Daggerfall and Skyrim. I'm not going to count map size, because Morrowind and games after it demonstrate that quality trumps quantity, though I would find larger maps to be pretty awesome regardless.

Also, I'm aware that Daggerfall wasn't the first ES game, but it was the first one I ever played, and the first PC game I ever spent hours upon hours playing.

**Weapons**

Daggerfall had a total of 18 different weapons, each of which could be made from 10 materials (not counting bows). However, the weapon you used in Daggerfall didn't matter as much since the speed attribute was the soul factor in swing speed. Still, variety is nice.

In Skyrim, there are a paltry nine weapons, and even then that's only if you count crossbows, which were added via DLC. Furthermore, each weapon only comes in eight different materials. Skyrim also got rid of staves as melee weapons and instead made them purely ranged spell-casting tools.

Variety is nice. Even if you just think of it as fluff, having a wider variety of weapons to choose from to suit a broader playstyle is a good thing, and let's be honest, it doesn't take *that much more work* to implement three or four additional weapons, especially since many of them use the same animations. Hopefully, ESVI will have a wider variety of weapons.

**Spells**

In Daggerfall, spells could be cast spontaneously, and most importantly: **you had the ability to create your own!** This trend continued until Skyrim, where once again they chose to simply remove the feature completely. Spell creation was one of my favorite activities, and I was disappointed to find out that they'd removed it from Skyrim.

By comparison, in Skyrim spells have to be equipped like a weapon. I don't necessarily have a problem with this, but it would have been nice if there had been a set of spells that could be ""quick cast"" without having to equip them (much in the way Shouts are used). Still, was it really necessary to remove spell creation?

I'm really hoping that ESVI has spell creation. Seriously. That's a feature that absolutely needs to be brought back.

**Item Enchanting**

I liked how it worked in Daggerfall, honestly. I know you could make overpowered weapons, but that can be fixed. I liked being able to pay an NPC enchanter to craft an enchanted weapon if I myself didn't have the skills or resources to do so. I know that's the only way it works in Daggerfall, but the option to do it in later games would have been nice.

I don't like the route that the later games took where you had to ""learn"" the enchantment from another item or know it via a spell. I would rather just have the option of paying gold for any effects that I don't know off-hand.

Item enchantment in ESVI could be the same as Skyrim and I would have only limited complaints, but seriously, having the option of paying a guild enchanter to do the enchanting would be a serious step up.

**Skills**

I like that they condensed *some* of the skills. It doesn't make sense that someone that excels with a sword would be completely lost if they picked up a mace. However, it would be nice to see some form of character creation where it applies to skills come back into the game, even if it's only picking a few skills that will start off with bonuses.

**Perks**

Holy God why? I know some people like the perks, but I feel like they're trying to consolidate the Fallout system with Elder Scrolls. I wouldn't mind if they were just little added bonuses here and there, but making them a requirement to properly use the skill (smithing perks, for example) is just stupid. If I can't fully utilize my skill without a perk, then it's not really a ""perk"" anymore, it's a requirement.

**Setting**

Ah, the much-debated ""where is the next game taking place"" conundrum. 

Hammerfell is a desert, and judging by the manner of dress we see with Redguards, likely has an Arabian Nights style to it. That wouldn't make a bad setting, though I can imagine that trekking across endless desert dunes could become disorienting and monotonous. However, with its numerous ports, such a game would have a wide-open realm of potential sea-faring gameplay, including piracy, sailing, and other activities.

Elsweyr contains both jungles and arid grasslands (I'm imagining a savannah-type environment). It would provide a lot of variety for travelers, and would definitely make for a nice setting for an RPG.

Valenwood, as the name implies, would be a game consisting almost entirely of trees. You basically get to choose between temperate forests and jungles. Lots and lots of green. Not a terrible setting, of course, but we've seen a lot of that already.

High Rock would be an interesting setting. Mountains and valleys means we'd basically see another landscape like Skyrim, but without as much snow.

Personally, I'm casting my lot in with either High Rock, Elsweyr, or Hammerfell."	t5_2s2ja	True

I might be brutally massacring this concept, but you know what I mean, and if you don't someone who corrects me will clarify it.  The basic idea is that the various contradictory endings happened concurrently, in complete defiance of normal time and space.  My question is, what happens going forward from Skyrim?  Timeline and lore-wise, that is.

Many of the storylines have only one real way it can happen, like the Winterhold storyline.  The Eye of Magnus event happened, and it can really only happen in one way.  Similarly, things like the Dark Brotherhood might have multiple ways it can go, but for lore, it's pretty easy to see that the rebuilding of the Brotherhood and the assassination of the Emperor is a more interesting path to go with than everyone was slaughtered.  My big question is, what about the Civil War storyline?

You can't have both sides winning the war, a la Daggerfall.  That would have Skyrim in a constant paradox, with both sides controlling the country, and really makes no sense.  So, unless I'm missing something, they will have to choose a ""winning"" side for that Civil War when they're designing they lore for the next game.  Who do you think will come out on top?  And, as a corollary, are there any other open-ended storylines that you think will have to be resolved one way or another (Blades v. Parthunax, Dawnguard v. Vampires) or do you see ways for them to Break the Dragon and have both timelines occur concurrently?"	t5_2s2ja	True

Subscription - Monthly Cost
B2P - Buy to play, Buy once, play for life.

Thought i'd make a thread to see what you think about it and if you differ from what i think.
 
i think its should be to B2P, like diablo 3 (w/o RMAH). Micro transactions acting as further game customization (like GW2) and future DLC expansions, quests, missions (which could give extra XP, level points, stats for PvE but have a stat cap for PvP, and making sure those weapons unlocked in new DLC is only allowed for PvE and not allowed to be used in PvP), with this i also think they could maybe have a Subscription module, the game comes with a 6-12 month time voucher or be free first 6-16or something. That way those who purchase the game have a good time to decide whether or not they will continue playing and then can support the devs by purchasing a 3/6/9/12/24 month subscription plan. 

I believe that Free 2 Play is the incorrect way to go.That type of game will make it buy to win (if theres a Real Money Auction House) which will ruin the balance of the game.

I love the gameplay of skyrim and it certainly appeals to the majority of gamers, but the old ES players could be, and are disappointed that the game has dumbed down.

1361185907.0	18qutp	Playing a pure caster -  comparison of all TES games. Your opinions.	cyro_666	25	2	14	"I want to ask you two things here. 

1. How did you play your spellcaster in the TES series? 

2. How to play an authentic, non-exploiting pure spellcaster in Morrowind? (Read the Morrowind section. To see what I mean with ""authentic"", read everything.)

I guess  **there will be a lot of spoilers here**... From Arena to Skyrim. So yeah, be advised.

**Arena**: This one was really easy. All you needed was shield and absorb spell. And a decent list of damaging spells. Once you cast shield it was actually permanent, it had ""hit points"". So it was just a barrier that enemies had to get through to hurt you. You just had to cast this when the the enemies started hurting and you were free of troubles. Absorb spell was useful when you fought other spellcasters. It made everything easy once you were level 10 or so, because it was easy to make a spell that had 100% absorb spell effect. The enemies just kept refilling your spell points that way! You didn't even need to rest to get them back. So easy. And awesome. And you're not even exploiting the game that way!

**Daggerfall**: That one was a bit tougher than Arena. What I did was following. I leveled my destruction to 90+ and then enchanted a piece of clothing/jewelry with destruction skill enhancing. That way, you had your destruction over 100. All the destruction spells then cost 5 spell points, which is almost nothing with 300 spell points available. The other way was to enchant pieces of clothing so you had absorb spell. You just cast an area effect spell and that way you damaged your enemies and reabsorbed the spell. I didn't like doing that last thing though, felt too much like exploiting, although other people might say it's not.

**Morrowind**: For some reason I never managed to make a character that would be a cool, ""authentic"" spell caster. You could enchant a number of rings with fire damage, or something and just use them to machinegun everything, but that's not what I'm asking for. For those who didn't play Morrowind: Enchanted items regenerate their charge over time by themselves. You don't have to recharge them yourself. So if you had a number of rings that did fire damage, you just switched to another ring when the first was depleted. And then to the third, and so on. If you had enough rings, the first one had already recharged itself by the time you used all your rings, so you could just use the first one again. As I was saying, this is not what I'm looking for, feels kind of like exploiting. Is it even possible to make a good mage without enchanting? I feel like if I have to use enchanting again, I'll just exploit it again too, so...

**Oblivion**: Contrary to some people's opinion, this one was easy too. You just had to have some brains. And no, you didn't have to exploit alchemy for it. You didn't have to use it at all. I see a lot of people saying: ""make fortify magicka and fortify intelligence potions!"" What the hell? Who wants to always carry around 30+ fortifying potions? Not me. There's a much easier way to dish out 1000+ damage with a few spells. And only Apprentice/Journeyman in destruction.

You just had to make 2 custom spells. First one is weakness to magic 100% for 7 seconds. The other is weakness to shock (or other elemental) 100% coupled with weakness to magic 100% for 7 seconds. In that order. You might be wondering why 2 spells? Wait for it. You cast the first spell on you enemy. For the next 7 seconds, all your damaging spells will do 2x damage. But wait for it. If you cast the 1st spell again, the multiplier will double(or just add?) AND the duration will reset! So you just keep casting this spell if you want crazy amounts of damage. Once or twice is enough though. Then you cast the second spell. The reason you don't just cast the second spell is because the duration of weakness to elemental damage doesn't reset and 7 seconds just isn't a lot. After you cast the 2nd spell, you just use an elemental damaging spell. With those crazy multipliers added by the 1st and 2nd spell, am apprentice damaging spell will dish out crazy amounts of damage. For best effect use a 2 seconds lasting damaging elemental spell and cast it twice if needed. My recommendation. Oh, you might be wondering why use these spells? They are A LOT more magicka effective. You can pretty much keep casting these for quite a while with good stats.

**Skyrim**: They ditched a lot of spellcasting features from TES in Skyrim, but they made it look so amazingly good I wasn't even mad. Not much tricks here though. Just pretty much straightforward damage dealing. 100 enchanting skill made it possible to make fortify destruction clothes with which your magicka didn't deplete at all, when using destrucion magic. Meh, to exploit-y for me. I just played a mage-ssassin. I usually walked around invisible and muffled. With silent casting perk (illusion) and good sneak skill, the enemies barely noticed you when you cast lighting and killed someone with it. Made it easy to make a silent-pure-caster killer. Awesome for dark brotherhood. Also, did I mention how awesome it looks when you double-cast a spell?

**Battlespire**: I'm mentioning this one in the end, because it's more like a bonus. It wasn't like the rest of the TES series, because it wasn't open-world. I'll be honest here. I couldn't play a pure caster at all. Is it even possible?

**EDIT**: I also just realized that most of you probably haven't played more than 2 or 3 titles. Just post your spellcaster experience in the games that you have played."	t5_2s2ja	True

You can join guilds like the Dark Brotherhood, the Thieves Guild, Fighters/Companions guild and Mages/College of Winterhold and each guild that you join and become leader of, eventually, join you in your fight, the Fighters/Companions and Mages/College help build up the bulk of your army, the Thieves guild helps to steal information on troop movements and get dirt on the Leading Thalmor members, and the Dark Brotherhood helps with assassinations on Members of the Thalmor.

On the road you get stopped by Thalmor patrols and if found with an Amulet of Talos, you get taken away for questioning, and carrying an Amulet of Talos will be necessary for a quest.

1355340013.0	14qmwq	Could we actually talk to NPCs in TES:VI?	NeroJoe	37	17	12	"I've been reading various tech blogs lately and I've noticed a popular trend.  Smartphone devices, most notably iPhone, have been utilizing speech recognition software which is incorporated into a knowledge navigator program.  If you've had the opportunity to use *Siri*, *Vlingo*, or *Dragon Go!*, you probably have noticed that this technology is advancing rapidly.


In addition to speech recognition and knowledge navigation, speech synthesis has advanced greatly as well, and will soon (5-10 years) be *nearly* indistinguishable from genuine human speech.


What if Bethesda incorporated a system like this into TES:VI, where a player could simply approach an NPC and speak to them?  The NPC could then draw upon a database (with lore, items, characters, enemies, locations, quest info, player achievements), and the game's AI could construct legible responses, that the speech synthesis could then deliver to you.


You could literally enter a shop and say *""Do you have any swords for sale?""* into your microphone, and the NPC would run a check on its inventory, identify ""swords"", check player achievements, construct a legible sentence, synthesize the verbal reply (all in about 2 seconds) and respond *""Sure, I have several!  I'm told you're very skilled with the longsword.  I have a nice ebony one you might be interested in.""*, or perhaps the merchant could say *""Sorry, I don't carry swords.""*  You get the idea.


Please note, this system would not necessarily *replace* traditional voice acting.  Main characters would still be voiced by professional actors, especially for important quest content.  However, for non-scripted speech an actor's vocal likeness could be emulated.


**PROS**


- A fun way to interact with the game.


- Every NPC interaction would be unique.


- Every NPC would have their own distinct voice and accent.  Next-gen speech synthesis software will be able to create very subtle differences in the tonal ranges, level of vocal pitch, and the variation of syllable stressing for unique accents and speaking styles.  Filters can even be added to make a voice raspy, nasal, guttural, or a range of other distinct sounds.


- You wouldn't have the same ten actors used over hundreds of characters.


- You wouldn't have to hear the same lines repeated over and over again.


- You wouldn't be limited to what you can say to an NPC.  You could ask them anything, and there would be thousands of possible responses.


- You could find information about a merchant's inventory without opening a menu.


- You could give followers detailed verbal commands.


- ZeniMax could package this system as middleware and license it out to other developers.



**CONS**


- You will need a microphone.


- You will feel very silly at first... and look even sillier to others.


- Increased potential for glitches and bugs... many of which might be hilarious though.


- Speech may sometimes sound unconvincing, which might be immersion breaking.


- NPCs may have difficulty understanding you.

1339383705.0	uvjuh	conversation starter for theoretical Elder Scrolls VI	CalebS92	21	1	40	"Just wanting to have a comment thing going on about ideas that would be awesome in the next elder scrolls. Besides the obvious graphics (which are already really good) and combat (which always seems to need a little more).

Some things that I have been thinking about lately is that it would make sense if the next one is the war with the Altmeri Domion. Bethesda could have a whole army/war marketing thing with some of the changes it would bring to gameplay.

I really like to repair stuff, and make the world better so it bugs me to no end with all these forts out there that no one but bandits take over and for the most part are structurally sound but are falling apart. What if you could take over a fort and make it yours. Maybe you could have one per 'hold'/ 'territory'. Maybe have a few quests of getting a stone mason, a blacksmith, carpenter, and some others that would be useful to make a fort better and they would stay there and have 'workshops'. Like in some forts in skyrim have a blacksmith and horse stables. Also all followers that you have would stay at your fort and do their thing.

Also maybe some kind of infrasturture economy in place for the holds. Whenever I go to whiterun the rundown walls and messed up town after the stormcloak attack bugs me. Maybe they could have if you buy/spend 100,000 gold the city uses the ""taxes"" they get from that and walls are repaired, then roads in the hold are repaired, and maybe after doing 200 bounties or whatever number some young citizens are inspired by you and become guards to help keep the hold safe and more of a presence of guards and they are stationed in some towers across the hold.

 EDIT: MORE IDEAS

Some things I enjoyed better in Oblivion was the music, I don't know if the composer was different I didn't check but the ambient music in oblivion is just pretty, relaxing and fantasyish. And I remember the music for it better. Besides the song of the dragon born i don't really remember any music from Skyrim at all. So maybe the music have more of a oblivion tone.

Also I wanna buy a horse for my companion, I feel like a jerk making her/him run behind me with all my junk while i'm riding on a horse with my hair flowing in the wind. Also the companion falling behind.

I have more ideas but don't want to completely swamp people in text. What are your thoughts? Are my ideas whack dog? Any ideas that you have had? Any things you've liked in past games that you preferred? Anything you don't want them to bring back or continue?"	t5_2s2ja	True

The next TES game will not be on the same console generation as Skyrim was, but it also means it will be the equivalent of the Oblivion of this generation. 

Skyrim was almost a generation ahead of Oblivion in terms of technical performance, and I don't think that an early-generation game will do justice for the whole of Tamriel (I'd rather see that being done at the zenith of a generation).

Instead, I'd like to see something interesting done with the Aldmeri Dominion. Here's a map of how big the Dominion is compared to the rest of Tamriel: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111120030753/elderscrolls/images/c/c7/Tamriel_4E.png

I would love to see a storyline that would involve siding with the Thalmor or siding with the rebels (such as how the Skyrim civil war was done). Having such a world-changing point in history (as possibly foretold by the Elder Scrolls) and in the deserts of Elsweyr, the jungles of Valenwood and the magical land of Summerset.

I'd most imagine the Altmer homeland to be similar to the Blood Elf cities in WoW, and I've always wanted to explore the contrasting environments of southern Tamriel.

Once I got out of the imperial prison, I saw the imperial city and thought, (no way I'm going in there, those are the pepole that threw my in jail). So I ran away from the city like any escaped convicted would. (On I side note I did not know what the compas was). After wandering aimlessly in the woods for some time a came across a town. The first thing I saw was a hores in the stables. Without even thinking about it being a crim I climed on it. Then the  guards came to arrest me, but I was not going back to jail. So I made away with the hores, well the guards chased me like fat kids chasing a ice-cream truck. Befor I found the next town I had left my hors on the side of the road. And hears where I made the mistake of of greeting the guard. This time ther was no out runing them.

1374703258.0	1izi5o	The Historical References of The Elder Scrolls (From a History and Fantasy geek)	Jupiterlyght	18	1	12	"I have been a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls since I first lied hands on Morrowind when I was Eight, and was moved even more by the glorious series in Oblivion, and officially dubbed a slight worshiper of the world of Tamriel in Skyrim. I am also a huge history fan, I have mostly studied the Roman Empire and Germanic civilizations (Vikings and other tribes from Medieval Europe). With my love of Fantasy and History crossing often, I love to root out the references to historical events and figures in works of fantasy, namely LOTR and Dragon Age. 
TES is an Interesting subject in particular, because not only does it reference history, but it also puts it into its own perspective and makes it interactive.  

Oblivion does not spare any detail in replicating the Roman Empire; The Legion (even in name) borrows heavily from the Latin Military used from the time of the Republic (from 509 BC, to 44 BC)
to the End of the Empire (1453 AD). The Architecture too is a lot like Rome. It looks mostly marble, with statues of gods and heroes, as was commonplace in the cities. I think the names too, are pretty Roman: Uriel Septim, Cicero Verus (like Cicero, the Roman Statesman and author), Amantius Allectus, Adrian Decanius, and others, reference the kind of styles people of Rome were named. 

Skyrim is really cool for Medieval European History, mainly because of its referencing to Viking-type cultures, perhaps more closely the Goths and Franks, than full-fledged Viking. Sovngarde is a kind of reference to Asgard, the main Germanic Pagan afterlife, and the Hall of Valor representing Valhalla, the great Hall of Othin housing the fallen warriors of numerous clans. 
Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising seems to reference the many Germanic tribes rising up against the Romans around 517 AD, for increasing taxes on ancestral lands, pillaging towns settled by their allies, and other rash actions. Dragons are a HUGE part of Germanic lore. Beowulf (who could perhaps reference Dovahkiin), a Hero of the Nowell Codex, went on a quest to slay an unnamed Dragon, for prompting two other monsters to kill the members of his warrior clan. The Battle was successful, but Beowulf was mortally wounded by the Dragon's bite and fire breath.

Also to make things a bit interesting I wrote a few ground rules for the play through. Anyone who wishes to do the same should try, I've found it adds a great amount of immersion to the game. Here are the rules:
1)You must play through the games with the same race/class as before. 
2)You must use the same birthsign through each game. (For skyrim you are only allowed to use the equivelent standing stone)
3)In order to move on to the next game you must finish the main story quests, finish all expansion packs that you have, finish at least 2 factions, and finally be a minimum of level 25.

Now that I am looking at getting the older games, I notice I can get a few on the Xbox still. With the older ones, are there advantages to purchasing the PC versions like with Skyrim or because they are older and the graphics are a bit behind to what is possible now, is the console version just as good from a gameplay and visual perspective? Is modding an option on those older versions?

More than likely the next non-mmo Elder Scrolls game will have to do with the threat of the Aldmeri/Thalmor, but this will take place even after that. I wanted to bring back Dwemer technology, and I think I've achieved a workable way to do that! Think steam-punk Elder Scrolls, minus the flying machines because they've not developed that yet.

I'd appreciate all of your input! Lore bending is okay as long as it's not major details. I'd be very thankful for comments, suggestions, criticism, and new ideas. I still need to figure out what the actual threat of the game will be, the goal my players will be striving for, so maybe you can help with that too. Without further walling-of-text, here's the lore I came up with.

The End of the Fourth Era
---
During the height of the Skyrim Civil War, a new Dragonborn, a Nord by the name of Fjoldyar Raddin and the Archmage of the College of Winterhold, emerges in response to the return of the dragons and the looming threat of Alduin, a dragon attempting to solidify the destruction of Nirn. With the swift defeat of Alduin at the Battle of the Tongues, Fjoldyar has his say in the Skyrim Civil War, assisting the Stormcloaks in driving out the power of the Imperial Legion, however, ending a plot to assassinate the Emperor by a small sect of rediscovered Dark Brotherhood agents in Skyrim. The War ends with a treaty between the Imperial Legion that declares Skyrim as its own province until the complete removal of Aldmeri politics and standing armies within Tamriel. As a result of the treaty, Skyrim convinces The Imperial Legion to join with the Stormcloaks to drive back the Thalmor presence. However, even with the help of the Dragonborn, the Thalmor prove difficult to defeat. Their defeat is swift when Fjoldyar halted his assistance to follow new rumours about powerful Dwemer artifacts, specifically Aetherium, that may aid in the defeat of the Thalmor.
After finding the Aetherium Forge under the ruins of Bthalft, Fjoldyar was astonished to discover literature that gave previously lost information on the whereabouts of the Dwemer. While nearly all of them traveled across the seas to investigate their origins, some remained in Bthalft and the homes to the Aetherium Forges. Upon visiting the ruins of Kagrumez in Solstheim and using the artifacts he aquired in Skyrim, Fjoldyar discovered that a Dwemer had be trapped in stasis, unchanging for several Eras. With the collected help of the College of Winterhold, they were able to release the Dwemer who revealed his name as Kagrenak. Kagrenak, at the moment of his release, becomes what we call the Ailtire, marking the end of the Fourth Era.

The Fifth Era
---
Immediately, the Dragonborn and Ailtire work together, the Ailtire appreciating the significance of the person who discovered him and his goal. Through several years of study at the College of Winterhold, where the Ailtire has made his home, he has been able to impart to us great knowledge and decrypt countless Dwemer texts. With the new-found information, Fjoldyar and Kagrenak were able to construct several sets of powerfully enchanted armors and blades out of the abundance of Aetherium that was revealed to be hidden under the ruins of Vvarenfell for use by each other and significant soldiers fighting alongside them. Dwarven metal was now just as easy as steel to forge, and quickly filled the army's supply with weapons and armor as its method was learned. The Thalmor were quickly thrown out of Tamriel in a matter of four years, however, they still threatened the seas for several more.
At this, Kagrenak assisted in the creation of a Dwemer steam-ship, a vast Dwarven metal ship that floated on the water with the assistance of the powerful magicka within Aetherium and a marvelous contraption called the Steam-Engine. Using the power of heat and water, steam could be used to power an entire metal vessal, moving at a constant speed faster than any Aldmeri ship could no matter the wind. By the sixteenth year of the fifth Era, the Aldmeri had admitted defeat. In a treaty written personally by Kagrenak and approved by the Empire and Skyrim, Skyrim and Cyrodiil became unified bodies of power, though remained in control of their respectful territories. The Aldmeri were to remain in the Summerset Isles and disband all standing armies. In exchange, they would be considered allies of Tamriel and would be taught the secrets of Dwemer technology. It's been fourty-one years since then, and most all seems well as it will ever be. Fjoldyr and Kagrenak still stand tall as the most influential men of today, having since split up and ventured on their own ways. The last bit of information I have that seems mentionable is the impending coup in Morrowind between the Argonians and the Dunmer, however, its significance, should it follow through, will stay in Morrowind.

I'd like to focus more on lore, plot, enemies, allies, and all of that story-based information here rather than the game-play mechanics. Thanks in advance for anyone who helps!

1355342839.0	14qq73	A list of Ideas i'd like to see in Elder Scrolls VI	HeroicKitten	18	5	17	"Now as an avid video game player and college student for game design I feel like I generally know what features would make a game good or not I thought up this list and think they would make the next Elder Scrolls installment even more epic than Skyrim. We all know Single player games are plagued with replay value so this is what I came up with.

**Features I want in Elder Scrolls VI**

* Deeper customization for weapons:

 *Combine rare materials for the blade, hilt, handle, magic, etc.*

* Spellcrafting
* Better AI

 *AI that remembers, thinks, and does things the player won't expect.*
* Some kind of Multiplayer free mode

  *Just so long as I can run around and do stuff with a few friends.*
* Rare Artifacts

 For weapons and armor mostly.
* Different outcomes

 *oh I'm the dragonborne? so what I'd rather ignore  you're troubles and be a farmer (meanwhile the world goes to shit)*
* Go pure evil

 *Allow the player to choose his own destiny, be a bandit lord, become the next evil, and kill everyone.*
* Destroy whole towns
* Claim towns as well
* Challenge the King

 Allow the player to physically challenge the king of whatever land we are in, fight countless waves of the kings guard, army until they realize you're so powerful they just bow down to you (IF you can actually manage to survive)
* Bring back Wild, Wild Wasteland
* A deeper perk system not just for combat but other random, but fun options

 Like half the ones from fallout (ladykiller, etc.)
* Living world

 *Seasons, when it gets cold the leaves in a tree die, snow covers the ground, ice freezes ponds, etc.*
* Better romance options
* Hardcore Mode




Alright well that's my list as you can see a lot of these options for more geared towards more player freedom and I feel like that's always been the whole point to the Elder Scroll series."	t5_2s2ja	True

1374387958.0	1iqmnh	My game screwed up on me, what now?	WutsUp	15	2	5	"I bought Oblivion for the X-Box 360 and had been playing it for ages. I have never played an elder scrolls game so didn't really know what to do. I was a warrior and did a lot of quests for the Fighter's Guild and closed 3 oblivion gates, I think I was up to the story quest where I needed to get a daedric book for Martin to decipher.

My skills were haywire, two of my primary ones were ""Blade"" and ""Blunt"" which I later found out was probably a bad idea cause the main ones determine your level up, and really i'd only be using one or the other of those types of weapon.

Anyway, I had 20 hours of playtime and I got this quest where I went into a dungeon, saved my game, there was also an autosave. When I came back later to resume both files would go to the load screen, load, go to a black screen and then stay as a black screen with nothing happening. Tried many times, cleaned the disk etc, nothing's worked. I quickly created a new character to see if it was the game itself, game still actually works; only my autosave and actual save game have stuffed up.

Felt pretty bad that my 20 hours had gone to waste, but tried to look on the bright side, I could start again now perhaps taking a different path and being more knowledgeable about how everything works. Being a fighter was pretty simple and I hear being a thief is the most fun thing to do in the game.

If I start playing Oblivion again from the beginning what sort of character should I be? What would be the most fun and what sort of skills would be most ideal?"	t5_2s2ja	True
1374009446.0	1ifvn5	Not sure if this belongs in this sub, but here are my hopes/ideas for TES:VI. Tell me what you think! Criticism welcome.	Coppin-it-washin-it	19	7	12	"The Elder Scrolls VI:

The game opens to your character being awoken by a guard. You are in a large tent with many NPCs of all manner of races and genders. You're instructed to all stand up, and form a line so that they begin taking your names down. As you slowly move closer to the gate, you overhear guards and other people in line talking about the influx of refugees from Cyrodiil, Morrowind and The Black Marsh. As you get to the gate, the guard takes down your name and writes what race you are as well as which sign you were born under (this is where you choose these). After this, he tells you to that your free to go. As you pass through the gate, you find yourself on a hill, from the top of which you can see far into the distance, where the No-quin-al Desert sits between the hills of Valenwood and on the other side meets the jungles of Elsweyr. At the foot of this hill, there is a makeshift villiage, where you can find your first quests and traders. I would like the game to take place in both sections of Tamriel.

As the game progresses, you learn that 100-200 years ago, the Civil War in Skyrim left the Empire weak and vulnerable, which is when the Thalmor attacked the Imperial Council and took control of White-Gold tower. While the remnants of the Empire struggle to stay alive and keep the peace in its remaining holds, It has recently been forced to fight a loosing battle in a two-front war...

We learn that Morrowind and The Black Marsh have been taken by the Akavir Alliance, and have begun their push into Cyrodiil and Elsweyr. The Akavir Civil war ended around the same time as when the Thalmor took White-Gold tower. With the tiger people of Ka'Po'Tun victorious due to their alliance with the monkeypeople of Tang Mo and their enslavement of the snake-like Tsaesci. And now, more recently, they have begun their invasion of Tamriel, and they are winning. The Thalmor are using ancient, powerful magic to protect themselves from most of the Akaviri front as the Thalmor push further into Elsweyr, Valenwood and Skyrim from Cyrodiil, while the armies of Skyrim, Elsweyr, and the Imperial Legion all over fight to push the Akavir out of their lands.

The opening of the game I described would be set in a refugee camp. The game will allow you to pick from all the normal races with their various merits, plus the Imga of Valenwood and the few remaining Snow Elves that survived the war with the Nords and evaded enslavement from the Dwemer, who in recent decades have begun to emerge from their various sanctuaries seeking to return their race to a prosperous society. These races, as well as all of the Akavir races being playable. This could be explained story-wise as they are defectors or ordinary citizens of the respective races just being tired of the constant fighting happening on the other continent, and all making nomadic journeys to Tamriel years before the invasion.

As far as where the story goes from there, Im not sure. I haven't thought far enough ahead to think of the important roll the player-character would play. Perhaps the Elder Scrolls tell of the greatest war ever fought? A war involving each and every existing race and faction. A mortal-only war for the control and fate of Nirn. A war that the Aedra and Daedra are not supposed to get directly involved in. Maybe that could be the player's destiny. Sent as some hero that the Divines or Princes use to indirectly change the fate of Nirn, saving it from those who wish to take control of Tamriel or changing it by welcoming the Akaviri or Thalmor as the new rulers?

Also, I did think of a fun idea for the first DLC... We see the return of the Dwemer from wherever they were taken all those thousands of years ago... I like to think they return as an enemy sent by one of the Aedra or Daedra to purge Tamriel and force society to start over? I can just imagine epic battles with all the other races using magic and catapults fighting the Dwarven armies with their mechanized weapons (semi auto crossbows, cannons, etc.) and robotic allies.
This of course are all things I'd like to see or just ideas I've had, but any feedback on what you all think would be awesome!

tl;dr- Im a giant fucking nerd, Game takes place in Valenwood AND Elsweyr, Morrowind and The Black Marsh were taken by the Akavir, who are in an Alliance and are invading Tamriel. And the Thalmor pretty much crippled an already weak Empire by Taking White-Gold tower and are once again vying for control of Tamriel."	t5_2s2ja	True

I'll start: In Morrowind my first objective was always to steal the gold platter in the first room and drop it before the guard came and took it from me which is worth 700 gold, then steal the warehouse key from the first guard you talk to about Morrowind (it's on a shelf next to him) I would then give the healing ring to the wood elf (Fargoth) outside so my reputation with the merchant at Seyda Neen was much higher, and sell EVERYTHING from the warehouse that I acquired. Once that was done I would go upstairs in the shop with the merchant and get the quest to find the wood elfs hiding spot (the old stump) and take that money.

1364567117.0	1b8qvf	I tried playing through the main quest of skyrim and dragonborn with no quest markers, map, journal, or fast travel, and it completely changed my opinion on the game.		12	0	10	"After playing morrowind I got a glimpse of what an immersive world could be like, and remembered being overly disappointed in skyrim as my second TES game (having played oblivion years ago) because of how repetetive and gamified it was (you just followed the arrow, nothing more): 

So I had some time and decided to start over without all the gamified stuff. Disabled quest arrows from menu and ini, and then decided to not use the map or journal whenever that was avoidable. Created a new character after forgetting enough of the main quest, and jumped into the world. This is how my experience went.

**Skyrim:**

After the attack on helgen, there were no quest arrows to guide me. I had to remember what was told to me to reach each place I was told to visit. Overall it went well, and I was able to reach all but three of the places I was guided to without too much effort without fast travel, map, journal, or quest markers. 

Here are the three points at which I needed the map or journal. It is important to note that no quest markers of any kind were necessary **at any point in the whole game**.

1) Once finishing up my introductory hassles with the greybeards, they sent me to retrieve the horn of jurgin windcaller. The dialogue did not offer enough information to point me in any specific direction. Had to use journal, but map wasn’t necessary. Spent some time wandering around looking for the marshes mentioned by the journal, but eventually found my way.

2) Couldn’t find karthspire and thus the wall of alduin without using the map to check its location. Tried journal first, but that did not provide information either.

3) Couldn’t find the ruins septimus sigmus directed me to to find the elder scroll without checking my map, since neither the dialogue or journal provided the necessary information.


**Dragonborn**

Most of the dialogue didn't provide enough information to get there without using either the journal or the map. Using the map, however, everything was fine. Still no need for the journal or quest arrows. Disappointing, however, as the gamified map still removes from the feeling of the expanse of the game world. I must note, however, that dragonborn would have been possible to complete without the map as well, it just would have required some further exploring, which would have been too much, even for me. This is similar to the other quest lines of skyrim, which aren't as providing as the main quest line.


**Did it work?**

**Yes!** This improved the experience dramatically for a somewhat patient exploration loving gamer like me. Once again, like in morrowind, I had a connection to the world. The places seemed real, not just checkpoints along the path of the game. The world seemed expansive, not overly small as I previously thought it was. Running through the northern icy forests not knowing where the nearest city was, just like in morrowind, provided the immersion I hadn't gotten during my first playthrough. I started feeling like each place was unique instead of it all being the same, as I had thought back when I used fast travel on my first playthrough. All the nooks and crannies of the world got more interesting, and finding new roads and ways to places was an interesting experience. The whole word also felt more alive, as all the NPCs and animals you see roaming around on the roads or near the flowing rivers are something you don't necessarily notice if you just fast travel everywhere. I also used to think of walking somewhere a burden when I had the quest arrows. Not anymore, since it now felt like exploration and finding your way somewhere, instead of arbitrarily walking a huge distance following your boring little arrow at the top of the screen. If you're looking for immersion, just disabling quest arrows (to disable the one on your compass you need to modify your ini) can be quite effective because you don't need them at any point in the game and they just gamify the whole experience.

I no longer think of skyrim as the boring monotonous arrow following minigame that I used to think of it as. I now think of it as a worthy addition to the elder scrolls series.


**Things worthy of noting:**

-My skyrim was unmodded (no extended journal entries type mods)

-I did use the horse wagons that were equivalents to stilt striders in morrowind but those were few and far in between so most of the time they weren't an option. 

-Despite having played skyrim before, I had forgotten essentially everything, to the point where none of my memories helped me in my quest."	t5_2s2ja	True

What does that mean for Tamriel's future, then? It stands to reason that *The Elder Scrolls VI* might revolve around just that.

Could we maybe be seeing Summerset Isles next? And what does the Stormcloak Conflict say for Skyrim's future? Whether it wins it's independence or not, it means a completely different Skyrim in the next installment, one either free from Imperial (and Aldmeri) rule thanks to the death in combat of General Tullius, and no longer part of the Empire, or one that's had it's rebellion crushed and the Age of Aggression ended when the Dragonborn slew Ulfric Stormcloak. 

Even Tullius and the Imperials knew that they couldn't defeat the Aldmeri Dominion if they kept all the infighting up, and everyone in the Empire was basically planning to overthrow the Aldmeris once they were strong enough, having been kind of fucked after that whole Oblivion Crisis thing.

What level do I need to be to attempt the main story dungeons? How can I get up to that level? What spells, weapons and armor should I have? I bought some leather armor, but it does very little good.

1375877139.0	1jvmhs	Tales of Ka-Ran-Chapter 2	Nordic_King	10	0	1	"The very same Martin now lived as a priest in Kvatch, and that is where Ka-Ran was to go. Jauffre provided some assistance however, giving Ka-Ran a steel claymore to protect himself from the wild. Our young nord showed great thanks, before heading off on his next trip. The entrance was blocked to Kvatch by an Oblivion Gate. Looking at his hand, Ka-Ran new this had something to do with him, and after a quick word with the guards, he charged into the gate and into Oblivion itself. The Emperor was indeed right; Ka-Ran had come face to face with the forces of Oblivion that day. Not much is known of what happened inside the portal, only that Ka-Ran came out changed, and with a new blade; Purger.

How Purger came to be, it is said, that as Ka-Ran destroyed the Sigil Stone which kept the portal steady, he infused the power of the stone onto his Steel Claymore, and named it Purger: for with it,  he was going to purge all Daedra from Kvatch and free its people. With his mighty blade in hand, Ka-Ran led the offensive, and took back the courtyard of Kvatch. The enchantment on his blade seemed to disintegrate any weapon his enemies were holding.

Finding Martin in the church, Ka-Ran told him to get to the camp for safety. Ka-Ran then led the offensive on the castle, only to come across a barrage of arrows and a closed gate. Retreating to the church, Ka-Ran took a soldier through the catacombs to the guards secret entrance. With him, came three Imperial Watch soldiers, who had seen Kvatch burning from the road. They were no match for the Daedra however, and fell, along with the guard who had the key. In their honor, Ka-Ran equipped the Imperial Watch Armour, which was superior to his. He took the key, and struck out the Daedra with Purger.

It came as a great shock to the Captain of the Guards when Ka-Ran twisted the handle and opened the gate. The courtyard of the castle was packed with Scamps, but Ka-Ran's bravery and courage inspired the other guards to fight along side him. They took the courtyard, and Ka-Ran disappeared into the smoke, around the entrance of the castle. The guardsman held the court from the Daedra that continued to come. 

When he emerged, he told of how he found the Count, being tortured and couldn't be freed. He destroyed his enslavers, and put him out of his misery. Taking the Count's Signature Ring, he gave it to the captain of the guards. His name was forever honoured as the Hero of Kvatch. He now had to get to Martin. 

Finding Martin in the camp was easy. Delivery of him to Weynon Priory, was a whole other matter. When he set foot on the property, a farmer warned him that the Priory was under attack. Ka-Ran sprung into action, and noticed that they were the same assassins as the ones in the prison. After disposing of them, he located Jauffre in the church itself. His face was a ghost, as he rushed past Martin and Ka-Ran.

Following him, they both soon learnt that the Amulet of Kings had been taken by the assassins. Disappointed with his failure, Ka-Ran took Martin, alongside Jauffre to the blades HQ, Cloud Ruler Temple. Here Ka-Ran was appointed the role of Blade-Brother, and was an official member of the Blades. He was told to take some rest in Bruma. A quick visit to the Armoury and he wore a full set of blades armour, and wielded a Dai-Katana. 

Ka-Ran was sitting in the Bruma Inn, having a drink with a few of the locals. Ka-Ran told of his adventures into the Oblivion portal. In the corner sat a dark man, and when Ka-Ran showed his palm symbol, he struck out and attacked Ka-Ran. Pulling a dagger, Ka-Ran jabbed it between his ribs and twisted it, and he fell to the ground. Guards rushed into the Inn, and removed the body. Another man arrived before Ka-Ran, and gave him a letter before fleeing, for he had seen the attack. It read:

Greetings friend! Tidings from the Imperial City. If you get the chance, return to the Arena at once!
Your name has spread far and wide and you're wanted.

Honours,
Grey Prince

A long trip back to the Imperial city was worth it. Here, it is where Ka-Ran becomes Ka-Ran Skullcrusher. He fights everyday for several weeks to earn this title in Arena. Until, one day, he becomes champion, and fights off against his only friend, the Grey Prince. 

Starting as a measly pit-dog, Ka-Ran was promoted to the rank of warrior by the end of the first week. The Grey Prince always commended him for his work, but in his mind he was scared. He had never seen a nord so fierce as his friend. With his new blade, the Foe-Hammer, an Akaviri Dai-Katana, he struck fear into everyones heart. It is said that he closed an Oblivion gate near Chorrol, and the Sigil Stone enchanted his large blade with Daedra Spirit, which made his blade do more damage then it should. Fully clad in Blades armour, he became a fierce and brutal warrior, and very soon a Hero of the Arena. It was only a matter of time before he became a champion, and challenged his friend.

And that day soon came. Of his two weeks at the Arena, he was the greatest champion the people had ever seen. Ka-Ran initially refused to challenge his friend, but the Grey Prince, was an Orc at heart, and cared little for their friendship. He took it upon himself to publicly speak out, and talked of how Ka-Ran was ""just a little angry orphan, who I want nothing to do with."" Enraged, Ka-Ran stormed into the blood works and immediately challenged his only friend to a fight to the death.

The Imperial City was in uproar. The Grey Prince had been challenged! It had not happened in the last ten years. Few supported Ka-Ran, but the support for the current grand-champion was overwhelming. Ka-Ran was required to take a name to be known by in the arena for his final battle. He chose Skull-crusher, for he had always enjoyed cutting the heads from his foes. The Grey Prince walked the streets encouraging all to come, and watch his great victory. However, on the opposite, Ka-Ran kept quite, training and waiting. Until the battle began.

The fight was a large anti-climax. Ka-Ran came out charging,as did the Grey Prince, but with one quick slash of his blade, Ka-Ran had finished the Grey Prince. This had left the city in shock. They had lost a great hero of theirs, and gained another. After several moments of silence, the crowd cheered and cried his name. SKULL-CRUSHER!SKULL-CRUSHER! Ka-Ran left the arena and received his prize. After leaving the Arena District, Ka-Ran was approached by an Adoring Fan, who Ka-Ran dismissed. He couldn't have a small child following him around, not with what he had done. Killing his only friend? That was nothing to be proud of.

Ka-Ran treated himself to a night at the Tiber Septim Hotel. It is said that this night Ka-Ran got drunk off his head on nord mead, and bedded 7 women in one night. Ka-Ran woke laying next to a wood elf and a nord. Shocked, he left the Imperial City, and headed to Bruma. He begged the Gods for forgiveness at the Altar, and Akatosh appeared to him. Ka-Ran, shocked once again, pleaded with Akatosh to forgive him. 

Akatosh spoke in a hoarse voice:
My son, Ka-Ran, Samuel, as your parents originally named you. You continue to serve me in my own way, although your destiny its self is not yet clear to me. I give you my blessing, and I also give you a gift from the Gods. Until your destiny has been complete, you and your family, will age at a slow rate, so that you can have a long and peaceful life. This, plus your elvish blood, should give you a long and prosperous life, and also to your sister, Lydia. Gods be with you, Samuel Pathmaker, Ka-Ran Skull-Crusher.Restocking his potion and repairing his weapons, Ka-Ran set off to find all four wayshrines of Akatosh. It did not take him long to find them, and from each one he felt his knowledge grow. He managed to stop three muggings along the Gold Road, and destroyed three camps of bandits in the area near Chorrol. He set up a camp in a Ayleid ruin near the Imperial city. He did not venture far into the ruins, and left a day after, when he found that Purger had been stolen, and the smell of smoke was coming from further into the ruins. He feared that someone was stalking him, as there was fresh blood on one of Akatosh's Wayshrines. He left the ruin, and didnt return there for quite some time.

He returned to the Tiber Septim Hotel. He spent a week here, before he was approached by a courier. The courier spoke in a exhausted voice. ""I've been tracking you for weeks. You are a difficult man to find, my friend."" He handed over a scroll, and Ka-Ran threw him 50 septims. ""Here. Spend the night, get a drink."" Unrolling the scroll, his face dropped. It seemed he had forgotten his duties since he had came to the Arena. The Scroll Read:


Dear Ka-Ran,

Your presence is required most urgently! The Blades have missed you the last 5 weeks, and many things have happened. We here that you have be crowned Grand Champion of the arena, and that is why you are the best for the job at hand! I have placed rules that do not allow blades to leave Cloud Ruler Temple, for Martins sake, but you are a Rogue Blade. We need you now.

Sincerely,

Grandmaster Jauffre.

Nebula666	15	5	55	"Hey everybody, just wanted to start off by saying that I particularly enjoy the subreddits dedicated to the incredible world of the Elder Scrolls, a very solid community. I am playing through Skyrim for the 5th or 6th time, played it so many times I lost track already. I have never taken any other side other than the Stormcloaks, I found their cause noble and justified, however I remember speaking to shopkeepers when the civil war had been 'concluded' and feeling a sense that it had all been for nothing, I got the idea that each side was just as bad as each other and that all the fighting had been for nothing, I briefly played Oblivion years ago and remember thinking that the Empire was noble and ruled fairly. I want my character to fight for the 'right' side, I know it is fair to say that there is no right side but for those of you who are extensively versed in the finer details of Elder Scrolls lore, which is the righteous side?

i know that Cosmology was written by the Temple Zero Society, which is a respected fan society dedicated to writing monkey-truth. since they are a group of fans nothing that they write would be considered canon by bethesda. while most of us lore fanatics don't really care what bethesda thinks about what's canon, one thing that this article says has always bothered me - that you can see stars through the dark parts of the moons. i've played morrowind, oblivion, and skyrim and this is obviously not true. i was wondering if there is any previous TES game that does show this phenomenon. did the zero society get this from some empirical source, or did they just make it up because it sounded cool?"	t5_2s2ja	True

I am thinking something like Risk 2042 where the land would be Tamriel, with a sub-land board in a plane of Oblivion.  The board can be broken down into provinces, and further broken down into holds within each province?  There could be commanders and Daedric princes that give you some sort of bonus capability.  


The pieces can be colored as well as cast into different models (the major races that hail from each province perhaps?)


I'm sure there are better game ideas, but with TES: Online on the way it got me thinking like Risk.  Plus there are already video game versions of Risk.

Seeing as how t[he land mass of all or most of Tamriel is already in Skyrim](http://redd.it/ml5vt), I think this might even be possible to pull off as a huge Skyrim expansion. 

Closing out the prophesies that currently govern Tamriel would allow the people of that continent to move forward and try new things (not sure how to work spoilers here, but hover over [this link](/s ""Now that Alduin has been slain, shouldn't time be moving forward again?"") if you've already finished Skyrim).

1361484956.0	18zcdf	End-Times: The Return of Padomay		7	3	16	"So this is what I had in mind for a possible storyline in one of the future Elder Scrolls games. I admit that the scale is a little bit vast, and the idea that one individual could influence the outcome of a situation like this is more than a little far-fetched. However, that hasn't been a problem in previous Elder Scrolls games, so here it is:

*[Padomay](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Padomay) has found a way to escape the Void and, with the assistance of some of the Padomaic entities, has come to destroy the dimension of [Mundus](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mundus), leaving only the realms of [Aetherius](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aetherius) and Oblivion. Padomay is **a being beyond the comprehension of mortals**, and his only equal is his 'brother', [Anu](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu), who is still trapped in the [Void](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Void). Only a being directly connected with Anu could even hope to free him from the vast nothingness in which he currently resides, and that being is Akatosh. The otherwise complacent [Aedra](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aedra) must be convinced to intervene and save the realm of Mundus. However, very few individuals possess the capabilities to commune with the Aedra, and not since the Last Dragonborn travelled to Sovngarde and defeated Alduin has a mortal travelled to Aetherius ...*

Constructive criticism and general feedback would be much appreciated, and, if not useful, perhaps entertaining. Any additions to this would be interesting to hear as well. I also appreciate that some of the lore is a little bit confusing, hence why I've added links to some of the names (the UESP are the best).

EDIT: In order to satisfy all interpretations of what Padomay and Anu are, I have emphasised that they would not necessarily have a physical form and that the idea that they are 'blood-related' is more symbolic than a statement of fact.

For a few years now I've heard about the epicness of Morrowind. How it was the last best TES game of the entire series, that was in some areas made easier but still fairly ""Old school"" compared to the newer TES games.

I've finally built up the courage and am ready for an experience with more depth and hardcoreness (i.e. not a map icon for every single quest ever telling me exactly where to go). However as we all know the default graphics are dated. I'd like to request what the best mods I should apply to improve the graphical &amp; gameplay experience to its maximum possible.

The second thing I'd like to talk about here is what is Morrowind like vs Skyrim? In Skyrim I was overwhelmed in the begining just like Oblivion. After awhile it felt like I was just doing the same quest over and over again with no real reward, though I need to add that this feeling was less so in oblivion."	t5_2s2ja	True

Any TES fan worth his Daedric Armour Knows that the races of man are based off of real-world cultures.

My question is, what about beast and mer? Are there cultures truly alien, or are their any IRL cultures similar to them? My rough list would be:

Ashlanders: Native africans, Babylonesque names

Bosmer: Not so sure, similar to forest elves from other fantasy series. Maybe native american?

Altmer: This one is really hard.  They fall into a kind of a snobbish elder race trope, but i'm not sure what that would be based on. Maybe england like the bretons?

Orc: I'd guess japanese. If you look at their weapons and armor in morrowind and oblivion, it is very samurai styled, but they are usually known to be barbaric, and have nordic looking buildings in skyrim.

Civilized Dunmer: No Idea.

Argonian: Probably some sort of jungle native people, maybe south american.

For the release of Skyrim I am starting an Elder Scrolls podcast. These games are immense, loaded with content and lore beyond most series released to date. The podcast will discuss Skyrim and it's content as we play it. As well as discussions about past elder scrolls games, their ups and downs, etc.

Anyone who loves Elder Scrolls as much as I do and has room in their schedule to podcast about it with me once a week for about an hour, please contact me. The only thing I ask is that you have played both Morrowind and Oblivion to completion of the main quest. Asking that you've done everything in both games is a bit much as anyone knows, but somewhat advanced knowledge of RPGs and Elder Scrolls is required.

Those interested can PM me to set up a skype meeting where we can work out details. Already have an intro and editor set up. I am very excited about this and hope there are a few people just as excited who wish to join me.

So I turn to you now, I have searched without success for some sort of save game editor that would allow me to strip the spells and equipment from my character in a last ditch attempt to save him.  Although he would be naked and defenseless when he reawoke, that would only be more glory to add to his tale when it is told.

Does anyone know of a save game editor that can do this?  I have found nothing in my searches.  It may all be fruitless, its possible my character actually has ventured into lands that simply do not exist anymore, but I wanted to give it every last effort in my last ditch attempt to salvage my Hero of Kvatch.

1375271355.0	1jeytx	Tales of Ka-Ran Chapter One	Nordic_King	3	2	4	"Born under the star-sign of The Warrior, Ka-Ran, or Ka-Ran the Skull-crusher as he was known later in his life, was born just inside Morrowind. He was quickly ushered by his nord mother back into Skyrim, abandoning his dark-elf father. At the age of 4, Ka-Ran was caught stealing a small apple from a market stall. His mother taught him from this day on that he was to never steal again.

At the age of 6, Ka-Ran's life was turned upside down; with the arrival of his father at Riften's gates. His father told him of his great destiny, and how he would be a hero to all of Tamriel. His father was tossed into the Riften Jail, but vanished only days later. Three weeks later, his mother passed away from a strange murderer in Riften. The murderer was a woman, who captured souls which fed her power. He was thrown into Riften Orphanage, where he spent three years. 

At the age of ten, Ka-Ran was adopted by a wealthy Imperial family making a visit to Riften to speak with their friends, the Black-Briars. He was taken to the Imperial city, where he was given the rich life by his parents and his foster-sister, who had also been adopted, named Lydia. Nord children they were, and therefore got into much mischief throughout the city. Lydia was three years older than Ka-Ran. He loved her dearly and took much of what he knows today from her.

At the age of 12, Ka-Ran name was changed to Samuel. It was his original birth name, but his mother changed it when he was brought into Skyrim. Now, living under his two foster-parents, they gave him the name so he could settle in more at the Imperial City, and make some new friends. For a while, it did not seem to work however, as he would only spend his time with Lydia. Slowly, but gradually, his number of friends started to increase, but it changed around a lot. 

One of Samuel's best friends, and most trustworthy of all, was a girl named Jordis. She was a brilliant student at the Imperial City School, and she and Samuel spends many days together. They helped each other learn basic spells, which for children of their race and age was very talented(both being nords). Occasionally, the two would go on trips together, and sit high in the mountains, and look over into their homeland of Skyrim. They would always be gone three or four days, and as much as their parents panicked for them, they were safer then most on the roads.

Unfortunately, this was the last good friendship Sam would ever have. On the 22nd of Frostfall, Jordis was taken by bandits as the two were trekking. Jordis went into shock, and released a spell she had not yet perfected, and it absorbed her. She was gone forever, and Sam had lost his only friend. Depressed and alone, Sam spent the rest of his childhood only interacting with Lydia and his parents.

When he was 13, another shock came upon Samuel. His mother appeared to him in a dream, and she told him that in fact Lydia was his half-sister, and that is the reason she left his father. He had an affair with his mothers sister, and Lydia was the outcome. Shocked by this, he immediately told Lydia, who said that she had known. Stunned yet again, she warned him that their father was not as evil as he seems.

Upon Samuel turning 16, Lydia departed from Samuel. She told him that one day they would meet again, and with the blood of elves flowing through their veins, they would both live to see old days, at least 200, and still look as fit as a fiddle. Sam spent the week crying afterwards, only to have his father approach him at the end of that week. He said few words, but burnt a symbol into Sam's hand. It was the symbol of Oblivion, but Sam had no such knowledge. His father said that he would come to learn what it meant, before turning to a pile of ash.

Now 18, Samuel was into hunting with a local gang of friends, including the Grey Prince, the current arena champion. The Orc and Sam shared many qualities, including their favouritism of heavy weapons and armour. When returning to his mansion one day, he found his parents dead, with their bodies strung up in his living room. He was wrongly accused of their murder, and sent to the Imperial Prison for life. He had spent two years in the cell, dreaming of revenge against his parents murderers. One day, a call came down through the halls, a voice that Sam had not heard before...

""You..You're the one from my dreams."" Was the current emperor, Uriel Septim first words to Sam. It seemed that the cell he had been placed in was in fact a secret escape tunnel to outside the city. The Emperor encouraged his Blades to allow him to follow, which he did for a short time. Sam was then sent his own way, only to met again with Uriel soon.


Sam decided to return to his name of Ka-Ran, as Samuel was tainted with murder. He liked the idea of being free once more, until he bumped into Uriel again.Yet again, Uriel convinced his guards to trust Ka-Ran. Ka-Ran had no idea what the emperor saw in him, for he was but a young nord, who had not even come of age yet. What came as a shock to Ka-Ran was the fact that the emperor appeared to know of his hand symbol, and told him that it was the symbol of the Oblivion dimension, which he would soon see with his own eyes. Then, one of the assassins hunting the emperor appeared and sliced him down. With his dying breath, he gave Ka-Ran the amulet of kings, and told him where to take it. Jauffre, the grandmaster of the blades knew the place of Uriel's last heir, and could crown him emperor.

Baurus rushed into the small room to see his emperor dead. He heard out Ka-Ran and gave him the key to the sewers. He said that he should hurry to Weyon Priory to meet with Jauffre. But before he departed the imperial city, Ka-Ran had one visit to make.

Having no money or belongings, and having lost his former identity, Ka-Ran travelled to the Imperial Arena to find his friend the Gray-Prince, or Agronak gro-Malog, as is his formal name. Upon arrival, Agronak was pleased to see his friend free and well. He could offer no aid to him, but encouraged him to fight in the arena.

Ka-Ran fought two battles in the arena, earning himself 100 gold. Departing the city, he made a stop at the 'Best Defence' and purchased a full set of iron armour, with the gold found in the caves and gold won at the arena. He departed and set out to Weyon Priory, where he would deliver the amulet of kings to the Grandmaster of the blades.

The trip to Weynon Priory near Chorrol was quite easy for the young nord. He had been in wilderness before, and sticking to the tracks made his life easier. Arriving, Jauffre was shocked to see him in possession of the amulet of kings. He told him that he was once the emperor's personal guard, and on a windy Turdas night he was summoned into Uriel's quarters, where he was delivered a small baby child named Martin, and told to keep him safe.

The very same Martin now lived as a priest in Kvatch, and that is where Ka-Ran was to go. Jauffre provided some assistance however, giving Ka-Ran a steel claymore to protect himself from the wild. Our young nord showed great thanks, before heading off on his next trip. "	t5_2s2ja	True

1362778367.0	19xoeq	Some ideas: Going to Akavir and future DLC proposals	ElrondTheHalfElven	1	0	1	"Although it would be completely amazing for the next TES installment, I have a strange feeling that Bethesda will first take us through all, or at least a couple more provinces of Tamriel before we see Akavir. I don't doubt that we'll be headed in that direction eventually, though. I would absolutely love to be a noble Ka Po' Tun, meet the great Tosh Raka, kick some Kamal and Tsaesci ass, hang out with my monkey friends, the Tang Mo, and travel across majestic lands that I've wished to see for so long. Aaah, 'tis but a dream at this point, but one I am confident will come true some day.

DLC Ideas:

As a part of the next TES installment, or as DLC for Skyrim even, I would love to see Cathnoquey, and all those other islands in between Tamriel and Akavir. After reading a lot of [lore on Cathnoquey](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1327126-towards-a-dragond-sea-cathnoquey/), I found myself intrigued at how mysterious and weird its inhabitants seem. My main reason for wanting to see it, though, is that I've heard that unchanged Chimer live there. If my lore is correct here, they don't look all that different from the Altmer, but my biggest fascination when it comes to TES lore is with lost and forgotten races. Also, it's the closest thing I think we can get to a Dwemer return (at least in the near future), unless Bethesda decides to be awesome and either do that, or let us meet our old friend Yagrum Bagarn once again (assuming he didn't die in the Morrowind crisis). That would be awesome DLC as well. The Dovahkiin befriends Yagrum Bagarn, and together, you're able to gather a lot of new and useful information on the Dwemer disappearance, and possibly even get to interact with other Dwemer somehow. The possibilities are endless, really.

Anyways, those are my thoughts. Let's hear yours.

Why can we only have Horses as mounts? Sure we had a dragon but I was thinking more along the lines of land mounts. 

For an example, the Orcs in LOTR rode those Wolfs. Why not be able to ride those in ES:6? Or heck! They could throw in a Saber Cat mount! Or a Bear! 

Now to make these mounts unique in their own way they'd have to have different stats.

A horse could be the base Mount, the most common by far of the NPCs. It's Strength, Speed, and Agility could all be mediocre. But it's Stamina would be the best of the four.

The Saber Cat's Agility would be vastly greater than all of the mounts, and it's strength and speed would be above average. Having it's stamina a little below average. 

Now the wolf's speed would be greatest. But it's strength and Agility would be average. However, it's stamina would be 2nd best.

The Bear, it's the strongest by far, and has greater health than all of the mounts. BUT, his Speed, and Stamina would be lacking in comparison to all of the other mounts. Having the Agility a bit better than a Wolf, but much worse than the Saber Cat.

It would be somewhat of a god sim, where you have worshippers, create your own daedric artifacts, etc...but you could also enter the world and just be a straight badass. Maybe war alliances with other daedra? 

IDK it seems like it would be a fun concept, plus TES could find a way to work into Lore somehow...either with generic names for the character (like Dragonborn) or maybe like a Mass Effect style where your saved game choices have an effect on future games.

1356369381.0	15dpfb	My Take: Elder Scrolls VI: Rebellion rough story outline	deathbydying	5	6	4	"200 years have passed since the incidents in skyrim have occurred. The Thalamor have secured their hold over the entire land of the tamriel except in certain bastions scattered around the world where resistance is fierce.

They even have managed to enslave dragons using some secret magical device unknown to the world.  Thalamor Dragon Riders Patrol the sky, and Thalamor concentration camps where they are slowly purging the non elf populations are springing up over the map.

You start as a prisoner in one of these camps either to be scheduled for purging due to for the crime of not being an elf or something else.  

After that you discover that even though the thalamor have stopped the worship of talos he still has power. This pisses them off greatly. So either you join the thalamor and continue to enforce their will. Destroying resistance, enforcing the status quo until eventually you find a way to fight and kill Talos himself.

Or you can resist, helping the enslaved and belegered human population freeing them from the rule of the Thalamor and finding a way in the end to become an avatar of talos on tamriel himself shatter and breaking the strong grip of the thalamor once and for all.

1341817466.0	w9e1s	Right in the feels!	tetsuraryuuken	8	9	4	"Okay, so Oblivion is officially the first Elder Scrolls game I've played, and currently the only one I've played.  I'm still on my first playthrough (with three different characters) and I've just done the ending quest for the Fighter's Guild.  Bethesda, my emotions! Spoilers follow for anyone who hasn't played it yet.

So on my ""Lawful-Good"" character, I capture the Argonian and interrogate him and then Modryn's like (in egoraptor's voice) ""Infiltrate that @#$&amp;!"" And I'm like ""I'm all over this!"" So I fast-travel to Leyawiin and I'm like ""I want to join the Blackwood Company."" and the boss is like ""Okay, time for some training, here, drink this mysterious potion.""  I hesitate for a second, but I guess I can't go on with the quest if i don't drink it, so I down it and find myself in Water's Edge killing goblins.  So I'm like, ""Okay, cool"".  I murder the crap outta some goblins and I'm thinking, ""This is easy-sauce."" Then the guys tell me ""Hey, there's some in the houses, kill them, too.""  Okay, this is weird, but okay.  Enter the houses, slay the goblins, finish the quest, I'm back in Modryn's house.  Modryn's all like ""What happened? Go back there and check that #$@% out!""

I'm like, ""Okay, fine"".  I figure Blackwood prolly stole some junk from the people. nope.avi. I talk to Marcel. [mfw](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/196/349/1482-epic.jpg). Get on horse, travel manually all the way back to Chorrol, the entire way I'm like [Dat Feel](http://i.imgur.com/MK91l.jpg).
Modryn's like ""I blame the Hist, not you.  Go kill those #&amp;$@ers! Put an end to this #@#$!"" And I'm like, ""Gladly""

Fast travel to Leyawiin, break down the door to Blackwood Company, they see [this](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/384-epic-rage-face.jpg) busting through their door, slaughtering everything with his greatsword, screw the shield.  Kill everyone and everything including the Hist tree. Rage finally subsides as there's nothing left to kill.  My only thoughts are ""Well played, Bethesda.  I cared enough about these characters in your game that it sent me on a roller coaster of emotions.  Shut up and take more of my money!""

**TL;DR** - Did the final Fighter's Guild quest for the first time, got sent on a roller coaster of feels.  Well played, Bethesda.

1358623520.0	16w09d	What would you like to see in The Elder Scrolls 6?	ElrondTheHalfElven	2	3	1	"With the most recent reply to a similar thread being one month ago, I thought it would be appropriate to refresh the subject. What would you like to see in the next Elder Scrolls installment? Here is my input:

A huge focus of mine is with how I would like the storyline to go, so the first priority on my list is I would absolutely love for it to be set either in Valenwood, The Summerset Isles, or Hammerfell. Here's why - As we progress further and further through the TES storyline, I am getting progressively more anxious to deal with Aldmeri Dominion war once and for all. And what better place to take the fight to than The Summerset Isles, or a neighoburing province (Hammerfell, for example, where according to dialouge I have heard in Skyrim, wars against the Thalmor still rage on that I am very anxious to take part in)? The Aldmeri dispute is a complicated and interesting part of the universal storyline that I am completely confident would make a great equivalent to Skyrim's civil dispute in the next Elder Scrolls title. That being said, should there be a heavier focus on the Thalmor in the next Elder Scrolls game, I would not deem it wise to put an end to the whole thing just yet, but to include their downfall in the epic finale of the final Elder Scrolls title. 
This storyline is one that intrigues me greatly, and so I am very anxious to travel to the distant and exotic lands of its origin, and experience this wonder up close. (Or the wide, expasive desters and beautiful coastline of Hammerfell, or the deep, mystifying forests of Valenwood would suffice as well. 

Other things I would love to see: 

-Less loading screens upon entering different buildings and areas. 
Let's admit that though it was not a great nuisance, the loading screens in the previous Elder Scrolls games have been far from a convenience. I am expectant of the next Elder Scrolls title to be capable of handling larger open environments with minimal interruption, considering the no-doubt superb PC specification standards that this upcoming title will have, and also because of the significant hardware improvements included in the next generation of consoles.

- The ability to travel between provinces. 
I cannot count the number of times I have wished for the ability to travel freely to neighboring provinces in past Elder Scrolls titles. Once I am used to the experience of life in one province, I yearn for the opportunity to travel freely to another one, and behold the new and exotic wonders that that one has to offer. Most recently, of course would be in Skyrim. Traveling to the very borders of Morrowind, Cyrodiil, and Hammerfell, only to be restricted by an invisible wall, and taunted by the very sight of a land with so many wonders to discover, is not the greatest feeling. And turning off collisions and running through feels neat at first, but when the textures start to fade, I know that I'm not really there. I cannot tell you what a wonder it would be to be able to walk through one of those borders one day, and experience what the neighboring lands have to offer. And as hope of being able to do that now without mods gradually slips away with each new Skyrim DLC release (the closest we have been thus far is being able to travel to an island that technically belongs to Morrowind), my hope for the ability to travel to neighboring provinces in the next title grows even stronger. I hope that by now, Bethesda has realized what a huge roll the influence of the activities of neighboring provinces could play in their next title, and that they will take advantage of the capabilities of the new generation of gaming platforms, and make it happen.

- More NPC's, a higher level of NPC intelligence, and more general NPC activity. 
I think we can all speculate just how much more life would be brought into the world with the presence of more NPC's. As amazing as Skyrim is (being my current favorite video game in fact), one of the few issues I had with it was the reasonably frequent feeling of isolation, and being one of the few truly active aspects of an otherwise inactive environment. I would've loved to have seen random, spontaneous battles between bands of traveling Stormcloaks and Imperials, or more frequent appearances of hunting parties tracking and killing animals for example. Things like that would no-doubt liven up the environment, and make for a great overall feel of being in occupied and civilized lands. And so, I cannot hope enough to see that in TES 6. How great would it be to be walking in the wild near a roadside, and see a whole troop of Thalmor marching in unison to their destination, but then confronted by surprise by a group of (whichever faction is the rebels in that game), and then having the ability to either jump in, or watch how the battle plays out.

These are the main things that I think would help make The Elder Scrolls 6 a truly amazing game. Tell me what you think if you'd like.


EDIT: I have come to the conclusion that The Summerset Isles would probably be best left to the Finale of the series. I do not think the Thalmor should just be flat-out eliminated in the next game, but rather driven back to their home province, as we simultaneously see the disposal of the White-Gold Concordat, and the regaining of the Strength of The Empire (thanks in part to your role in the story, of course). I have decided that I would really love for the next installment to be set mainly in Hammerfell. Since they are still standing tall against the Thalmor by continuing the war with them in Hammerfell, I think that Hammerfell could be a great setting in which to significantly weaken the Thalmor, but not to finish them off just yet. I would absolutely love to fight alongside the soldiers of Hammerfell, bringing down troops of Thalmor on the hot desert sand. That would be absolutely amazing. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Can't wait for your input."	t5_2s2ja	True

Don't like:

First, the game is very difficult; even on ""easy"" mode.  I can't tell you how many times I got killed by a random enemy encounter - like a wolf, or a random orc or random bandits. 

Second, the interface sucks. Now, when I say it sucks, I don't mean that the design sucks.  And I'm not *just* talking about the fact that it's clearly designed for a controller, and not for a keyboard.  But there are certain things like, for example, choosing dialogue options.  I'll click on a dialogue option and it'll play the wrong one - apparently since I need to both scroll to the right dialogue option AND make sure it's highlighted, or something.  

Also, why I hit tab to hit my inventory, and escape to hit my quest menu, I'll never know.  

Like: 

Boss battles!  In Oblivion, there was really only one ""boss battle.""  At the end of the mage quest, there was a battle with the head necromancer, but that was rather anticlimactic.  But I love the fact that you battle an ice troll before heading into High Hrothrim, for example.  And of course, the dragons themselves are bosses.  I felt this was a big part of what was missing in Oblivion, as it just seemed to be wave after wave of humanoid enemies.
