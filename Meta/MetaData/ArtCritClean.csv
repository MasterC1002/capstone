1358796021.0	1706av	r/ArtCrit redesign and new features! New flair options! New look! please upvote so subscribers see it!	BasicDesignAdvice	51	7	14	"**Thanks to the /r/ArtCrit Community**

**tl;dr: Thanks for everything, make sure you look at the bottom for information about the flair system!**

I took over /r/ArtCrit over a year and a half ago. Back then there was less than 1,500 subscribers and the reddit was dead without a single post in months (well maybe one). Recently we crossed 4,000 readers. We have posts every day. Best of all, it is not rare for a thread to have ten or more comments. A far cry from when I first found it. I took over this reddit with the aim of giving reddit artists a place to talk about technique and craftsmanship, and its been happening ever since.

It isn't always perfect. Posts slip by without a comment at all, people downvote without offering advice, and not every comment is a winner. Yet every day there are conversations and that sense of a place to talk about something is what I think this community is all about.

Best of all I really don't do that much! This community went along and improved itself with only a little bit of marketing by me. So big thank you to everyone in the community! So today I unveil my long talked about plan to make the reddit better. If we've come so far without any changes, I can't wait to see where we're going.

**So now the big news**

Those who go way back might remember me saying that i had plans to add new features and redo the CSS. Well, i finally did it. It took a while as I had zero skill in CSS a year ago and like many I have a busy life.

Anyway I just want to let you know there are a bunch of little changes, a kickass new sidebar, and more to come so snoop around. Oh, and if anyone has any ideas (or complaints) for tweaks let me know. Now that I actually know CSS it won't takes years to implement.

**And Finally, FLAIR**

By far the biggest thing for this update is the introduction of user flair. I split the flair into three groups. The first three are called ""Student Flair"" are all gray scale. Using this flair means you are here just to learn and get feedback, and indicates a level of ability for when you post. 

Next is ""Skill Flair"" and it is for users to show what they primarily work in. All of the flair is customizable. By this I mean if you want you can select the Oil paint flair, you can change the text to say ""Illustration"" (or whatever) so we know you are an Illustrator who uses oils. Feel free to include genre as well like ""Fantasy Illustrator"", ""Plein-Air Painter"", or anything else you like.

Let me know if you want more flairs added for another category and we can talk about it. This is just the jumping off point.

If your discipline isn't included use the 'Other' flair.

**Last of all, an experimental feature, Foundations Flair**

This flair is a bit of an experiment and may be subject to change based on how the community likes it. Foundation flair can only be granted, and it can't be asked for. A user must recommend a critique you have given or comment thread you have participated in to receive it. Selection is based on how in-depth that user is willing to get.

But what does that mean?

Foundations flair is basically there to say this user has previously been extremely helpful and demonstrative to another user. It is white on black to make it stand out a little. Its kind of like saying they have taken on a teacher role. Things like linking to tutorials, resources, and making notes for a user are the sure to get you Foundations flair. In the future this may become the metric which will net Foundations.

As of now, I am the only user with Foundations Flair. [Here is an example post I made some time ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtCrit/comments/s3hye/teaching_myself_to_draw_a_study_on_100_hands/c4but69) to show the kinds of things to look for. This post would earn Foundations flair because I answered follow up questions, and took time to make notes for the user.

[And here is another example](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/rk8ai/can_someone_give_me_a_critique/c46htf8?context=3). Again, making notes (this time on the actual drawing) is one of the most helpful things you can do.

I hesitate to say that I will simply judge comments, so objective things like replying, answering questions, and offering links are (for now) the main way I will judge giving Foundation flair.

**Thanks again**

Hey guys, I am so happy to release all this stuff because I think this subreddit can be really great. I've seen it be great before and I think with the right tools we can launch forward to new heights.

Thanks again to everyone who is a member of this community. Look forward to new features later on as well!

1331655411.0	quow1	The Pros and Cons of Harsh Critiques	cblackula	25	2	16	"This morning I logged onto my Youtube account and saw what was probably the harshest critique I've ever experienced. Not only was the anatomy off on the painting, but the colors were a bit splotchy and I'd cut corners. He then stated that he could do better. My very first reaction was simply ""Who the fuck is this guy?"" I was pretty angry. I clicked on his username and he had never uploaded a single video and didn't even have a website for me to look up his work.

After a few seconds of fuming, I stopped and looked back at the video. He was right. I think that's what upset me more than anything else. I knew that he was telling the truth. He told it to me in the most assholish way possible, but he told me.

Sometimes as artists we get caught up in comfort zones. Most people can't draw. It's easy to take advantage of that. Anything you draw will automatically be considered pretty good by a layman's standards. After getting all of the compliments and accolades, you might find yourself thinking ""Shit, maybe I *am* really good."" This can hurt you. You'll get comfortable not being told the truth, and you won't be any different from a pretty girl who has received nothing but compliments and free dinners all her life.

You and I need to take what we do seriously, as often as possible. Take it seriously and be honest with yourself. You may find yourself in a place where none of your friends, coworkers, or colleagues can draw (or not as well as you). Try and change that. Meet people who'll help you to get better. I feel like it's a good thing to surround yourself with artists who are better than you. If you have the tiniest bit of competition in you, you'll end up improving exponentially faster than you would if you got nothing but praise and ""I could never do that""s from your friend.

In hindsight, I think the *way* the words were said was what bothered me the most. It came from a condescending place, and I still feel a little bitter about it. But I'm glad that he exposed me to these feelings, and I will think about this the next time I draw. I know exactly what I need to improve on, and now it's only a matter of doing it.

When you're critiquing people, please *don't be an asshole*. You shouldn't sugarcoat what you're saying, but don't put it in a way that'll make them hate you. Burning bridges is not good. Even if John Singer Sargent himself had said all of that stuff to me, I would have been upset. Grateful, but upset.

**Don't ever give up if you receive a harsh critique. Ask yourself why they said what they said. Ultimately, this is about your self improvement. May your skin be resilient.**

There's nothing particularly special about it, but I experienced something amazing while I was painting it. It was very difficult to try and get a good likeness- mostly because of her hair, and skin tone, and measuring the distance of her nose (which I still screwed up). In the beginning I thought it was going to be easy, but then I found myself struggling as I often do.

 

About 2 hours into painting this, I felt my mind pulling me into one of my worst habits: not finishing. I find myself thinking ""Alright. You can hit 'save' for the last time and go onto something else. You did fine. Leave it. Don't push anymore."" Once I'm at a point in any drawing where it looks ""good enough"", I usually have this intense urge to simply leave it alone and move onto something else. I somehow *know it isn't done*, but I make myself think that it is.

 

This time, I'd just finished reading a post on [Muddy Colors](http://www.muddycolors.blogspot.com) where [Greg Manchess posted a couple of tips](http://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/03/10-things-to-remember-about-training.html). **(PLEASE go to the link, by the way. Favorite it. Print it out and put it on your wall.)** It was really obvious stuff that I'd heard a million times before, but this million-and-first time, it stuck with me. We need to draw, and keep drawing. And then draw more after that. I've spent a lot of time being scared of working hard, I realized. Mostly because working hard means that you're giving something most or everything you have. And what if it fails? What if you draw a million portraits and you're not where you want to be? It's safe to not try your best, and thirty years from now, you can say: *""I probably -could- have been really good, but I didn't have time/I had other priorities/I was too lazy"".*

 

I'm fine admitting that I'm scared. I'm scared of wasting my time and not having anything to show for it. Maybe sometimes I buy into that lie that the painting gurus were born with extraordinary skills that came naturally to them and would never come to me. I'm also inherently lazy, and I assume that you have those moments, as well. Moments where your body wants nothing but mediocrity and comfort.

 

While I was painting this, though, I defied my inner laziness and pushed through. I wanted to quit, and I wanted to say that it was ""good enough"", but it -wasn't-. I [posted recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtCrit/comments/quow1/the_pros_and_cons_of_harsh_critiques/) about how bad it is to paint and draw for people who don't know how to draw and paint. They'll like whatever you do, and for the wrong reasons. Don't paint for them. And don't paint for your lazy self- the part of your that's willing to accept ANYTHING. Paint for that best part of you. That part that's stubborn and vicious and eager. Paint for John Singer Sargent and Marko Djurdjevic and every painter you want to be. Paint something that they'd smile and nod at.


I pushed through the frustration of this painting and went at it for another two hours. that's twice as long as I usually spend on this sort of thing. Those two hours elevated the painting beyond where I'd originally thought I would go. And the craziest part is that it could use two more hours of work. **It is still not finished. I could have worked a lot harder on it.** I see that now. Being stubborn and going against my will helped me out this time, and it'll help me more next time. Pushing past your laziness is another tool in your artist's bucket.


I'll sum all of this up by saying a few things. Don't be scared of working hard and achieving your dreams. Don't be scared of not playing video games in favor of painting, or bringing a sketchbook in public to draw. When you feel laziness taking over, realize that you're dragging yourself into mediocrity. I realized that's what separates the ""okay"" drawers from the incredible ones. Take baby steps, push yourself, and love drawing as much as you love any of your other hobbies. I hope this helps you guys.

Downvoting is the lowest form of criticism, if you can call it that, it is certainly not constructive.

Why not go the extra mile and remove it altogether?

Downvoting is still helpful against bad critique or comments that don't follow the guidelines. If possible maybe disable it for submissions only.

Just my 2 cents, would like to hear opinions on the matter.

1299640539.0	g07jo	Hello /r/ArtCrit. I am BasicDesignAdvice and i will be your new moderator.  	BasicDesignAdvice	19	3	7	"so i've been on Reddit for a little while with the concept that i would spend my time giving the meaningful, well informed critique that every growing artist and craftsman needs to improve. naturally when i heard of /r/ArtCrit i was excited.

then i got here and found a ghost town.

i was earnestly surprised considering how many artists and art students there are on Reddit, and the potential for growth that meaningful critique could bring.

well, i think we can do better. so i have become the mod in the hope that we can have a place where *thoughtful* and *meaningful* critique are the norm, not the exception. 

before i start making announcements in other art Reddits to drum up activity, or changing the look and feel of anything, i want to see what the active community wants to see. then i'll do what i can to implement what we want. so if you've ever had an idea of what this Reddit could be beyond its current state, let me know."	t5_2qoaq	True

I feel like when I do have ideas, I can execute them with some reasonable technical skill, but I rarely feel ""inspired"". I find that my paintings are nothing special, even when relatively well executed. My subject material is nothing really thought provoking, it's more of a novelty. I am not an overtly political person, I don't really feel like I have anything to say publicly (and often feel that means I don't really have anything to contribute)
Whenever I look at the artists I admire, I feel defeated. Even if I cultivate a technical skill that is in the same league, I feel I will never have the vision to create something ""new"". Is there really anything ""new"" anymore?
While I figure these thoughts out, I have resolved to simply keep working as much as I possibly can. Continuing to make art is the only real answer, I know. I hope I can find my voice in the art world eventually.
What I am looking for here are any stories of people finding themselves and their voice in artwork. How have you overcome mediocrity? Or have you embraced it and moved on?
TL;DR: I am dealing with being extremely average and unimaginative. Can you relate to this?"	t5_2qoaq	True

1308935399.0	i87pc	message from the r/ArtCrit mod	BasicDesignAdvice	16	0	8	"hey everyone. i don't know about you, and its not like its been amazing, but i am happy to see some new life in this reddit. i know i haven't been around since my original announcements, but that was partly unintentional, and partly intentional.

but enough about me. lets talk about our little reddit here. first, some numbers.

[here are some of our traffic stats as of today](http://i.imgur.com/wBN7X.jpg)

most notable, we've had 117 new subscribers since the end of April! i know this isn't a ton, but its a great trend. i don't know about you, but i feel like there has been some decent activity this month, which is great.

most of these were on days i made announcements in a couple other art reddits, which i plan on doing once a month until they tell me to stop. i also tried contacting some mods about getting representation in the sidebar, but no response. maybe in the future.

we also had a little over 15 submissions this month. not bad for a reddit that had a couple months with *no* submissions.

on to new business.

i've noticed that we have some eager young artists submitting (and in the case of spillanya, *multiple submissions*, keep it up!) and looking for guidance.

with that, i would like to introduce the idea of making r/ArtCrit a learning reddit. this idea would mostly include more learning info in the sidebar, and an r/ArtCrit FAQ which would mostly be links to resources, as well as more substantial info on what makes a good crit. i have been building up a library of good links to share, and invite anyone to share their own with me. please don't share links on the main page. when the FAQ is ready it will be editable as well so there won't be a middle man.

this reddit has a dedicated community, so i won't do anything unless people are into it. so let me know what you think on this front, or anything else. also, i should be more active for at least a little while now. 

lastly, i have been working on some .css ideas for the reddit, nothing major. mostly cosmetic changes. if anyone has a great idea or a cool custom reddit alien or an idea for a reddit alien, let me know. 

so anyway, thats whats up for now. keep telling people to come here. keep upvoting so newcomers feel welcome, and lastly, keep up the good critiques!

ButtHurtBrother	16	1	21	"Hello /r/ArtCrit . So I can draw from a photograph and I can draw from real life (like a still life). I've been doing these two things for a really long time and have gotten good at it. What I have never been good at is just using a photo (or real life object) as a reference to draw something of my own. 

I feel like when I draw I am just a long drawn out version of a photo copier or camera, not much purpose in that since we already have copy machines and cameras that could get the job done much quicker...

I want to start drawing interesting things, fantasy and surrealism and even some macabre. The problem is that I go dead in this area. I know that you usually still use images as references, but I can't seem to get a grip on how to change it or how to use the image for my own purposes or something. 

Obviously I don't know exactly what my problem is, but hopefully I was able to give you general idea of it. 

Any tips on how to get out of this rut would be helpful! Thanks!

Before anything else, this is not a rant against ""My sister makes art but doesn't think she's good enough"" type of posts. They have their place.

What I'm getting at is what I call ""critique conversation."" That is to say that any feedback really is a two-way street. The artist needs to be able to say a few things here and there, ask questions, converse. If the artist has to do a lot of explaining before anyone ""gets"" it, then the artist is not doing their job and that comes out more clearly in the context of a full-on critique. The critique is by far the most powerful tool an artist has for improvement. If the artist is not there, then it is not really critique because any feedback needs to be relayed somehow and that means it's subject to a filter of a third party.

Another solid reason is confidence. Granted, an artist must choose which people to trust for feedback in order to nurture the growing creative being inside. That aside, getting your art out there is all about networking. Unless you're going to hire an agent, that means you need to bone up on interacting, selling yourself, finding out what people want. Again, if you do that through a third party, anything that is said is subject to the third party filter. But there's more to it than that... if you are putting yourself out there, you are more likely to listen and learn than if someone plugs you.

I really think you need context in order to appreciate art more. Right now we're critiquing technique and looks. How about we have the artist talk about their art in a comment or something like that?

1360088054.0	17y0ck	Book recommendation thread: What are your favorite art books you want to share with fellow artists?	BasicDesignAdvice	13	3	9	"Hey everyone,

**tl;dr, Look forward on the weekend for an official discussion thread on the lessons and features of Dynamic Anatomy, make your own recommendations below for book of the month. Please upvote for visibility**

So you may have noticed that the announcement sticky changed and we have a new item in the sidebar. I aim to change this every month or so. After a new book is posted I will wait a few days for people to see and check it out and do an official weekend discussion thread where we can talk about it. Additionally, I am posting a thread where people can post their favorite art technique and instruction books and in the future i'll draw from that pool! 

**Only one rule:** Books pertaining to craftsmanship and technique only! No books about a particular artist or art history or specific genres of art or whatever, unless the books focus is getting better as an artist. 

Now, of course I think observing the work of others is important. You should always try and talk about artists and art history. I think we all agree this is important. I won't be posting books like this because I try to direct the conversation on r/artCrit toward technique and craftsmanship in order to keep things objective and focused on getting better. I try to avoid content that is overly subjective in nature like personal taste regarding artists and styles. After all, personal taste is personal taste and if we spend time arguing about it we aren't getting better!

As always, I look forward to seeing discussion of this nature in comments when appropriate :)

One more bit of news. January was the busiest month in the history of /r/ArtCrit with 43,000+ pageviews! Not only that but we have more posts than ever. 

Thanks everyone and keep up the good crits. 

Till next time,

Also, I didn't have access to many paints as a youngster so I had to use what I had sparingly..which mean never.

My friends seem to like my recent string of illustrations but I need third-party feedback that's not afraid to hurt my feelings.

Currently using Winsor &amp; Newton Cotman travel watercolor set with waterbrushes. Sometimes I will use a regular brush if I'm working from home.

BasicDesignAdvice	14	0	7	"so i took over this sub-reddit so we could have a place for meaningful critique on reddit, and i aim to make it happen. i had to stay away for a couple weeks right when i wanted to get started for a new client project, but thats entering a good flow, and i am taking the weekend 'off'.

i will be making announcements about our community in the other art reddits. contacting more mods to get us in their sidebar. redoing the header image so we look a little fancier and more involved. and any other ideas you guys can throw my way. i should also mention i have added more info to the ever evolving sidebar. i'm looking for more suggestions, particularly good articles on critiquing. 

heres where the community as a whole comes in. for this to work we need to be upvoting and being active for anyone we can get over here. **this is key**.

personally, i will be upvoting every new post we get. no matter what. this isn't a place for negativity, its a place for growth and learning. we need to encourage that feeling, and on reddit, upvotes are how we do that.

also be sure to comment. i put up some links about critiquing. glance over the 'checklist for a critique', i thnk it is a good place for us to start, but by all means take what you can and ignore the rest, another important facet of our community is to keep our comments specific and relevant. it may not be smart to talk to someone who is just beginning about flow. 

as always, please let me know any changes you guys are interested in.

1345821396.0	yr9k0	LPT for ArtCrit Posters: Taking better photos.	jenkren	10	2	6	"Just a little Pro Tip for the posters of /r/ArtCrit, before you upload the picture of what you would like us to critique, alter the image so it looks like what it really looks like in real life.

What most artists do when they digitize their work for portfolios and websites is set up multiple light sources using the lamps they use in their studio and play around with Fstops in fancy cameras. Not every one has access to a studio set up and high quality camera but most everyone has a photo manipulation program on their computer. Don't drastically alter the image, just alter it so that it looks like what it looks like next to you. 

**Pre Set Up**

* **Make sure you are taking a picture from a parallel plane.** - Even tilted a few degrees on a wall alters the dimensions and makes it hard for viewers to compare proportions for you. Putting your object eye level makes it easy to see your angles better - I suggest putting it on an adjustable easel or hanging it on a wall.
* **If you have a tripod, use it** not that big of a deal for /r/ArtCrit but if you're making a portfolio it cuts down on a lot of post-capture work. Especially if you are messing around with different exposures. Position your tripod far enough away that you get the complete object in the frame but close enough that (if you're doing a painting/drawing/etc) you barely have excess space around the image.  This is better for cropping and for getting the highest quality picture you can. If you have a 3d object make sure the light and shadows around it are not awkwardly cropped out and you have a good image in your negative space. 
* **Use the best light you can** If you have multiple studio lights that's great. If not take your camera outside and do it at a good time of day. Or point all the lamps you own at your picture before you take it.
* **Take multiple pictures and chose the best one.** This is a pretty obvious one. When I was capturing my portfolio I would take about 30 pictures per image with different exposures, focus points, lighting and angles. That's a little much for every piece you have but you will learn which lighting and exposures are good for darker tones or lighter tones and bigger and smaller pieces. For the hobbiest or if you're not planning on showing it to people professionally I would say take 6 pictures and choose the best one out of that.



**Post Set Up**

* **Adjust the brightness / contrast.**  - a dark image is hard to critique. It's hard to tell if you intentionally made your image dark or if it is just the lighting.
* **Adjust the colors / hues** - make the shade of green the shade you really wanted it to be. faded out green vs a bright kelly green is a big difference in the tone of the piece.
* **Don't crop off the edges of the canvas** we need to see how you are using the canvas in its entirety to give a critique. If you are displaying a finished piece and decide that one portion of your canvas doesn't look good and want to lop it off - that's called Scissors Cropping or Scissors Composition. It's mostly looked down on in art schools because it shows that you didn't plan out well enough, but I think if you know enough to see a better composition after the beginning you are doing well. And each piece is a learning experience!

if you really want to get fancy and know a lot about photoshop I'd say throw on some filters and use curves and threshold the shit out of it or whatever you want, adjust it enough to where it looks exactly like the physical work. If you're not that good at photoshop just adjust darkness and color a little bit to match as close as you can.


If you take a picture in your dorm against a wall with awful florescent lighting where you can barely see any detail - people who would give you critiques would think you weren't taking it seriously enough to give them (This is more ""Look I drew a picture!"" not - ""I really want to know what worked in my piece and what didn't - what should I work on and where are my strengths?"") or the quality will be so bad we can't really get any detail to critique out of it. Take a bit of time in set up and really appreciate the time and energy you spent in making the piece as you're photographing it. 

If I was a little more proactive in my work I would take a  studio picture at several stages during my paintings. It's a great time to see imperfections or see what is the focus point and where your eye tends to go. Also it's great to see progress and changes!

I cheated and blended a few space photos for the background, but I hope to experiment with painting my own ""spacescapes"" in the future. Everything else I painted in Photoshop with brush/smudge tools. Used the pen tool to create the glass dome and spaceship, then several layers of textures/filters/paint to try to get the ship to look decent.

I lack the experience and skill when it comes to fabric/clothes, keeping light sources consistent (being in space confused me especially, since it's dark and yet light sources in all directions), and apparently metallic structures. I was trying to convey a sort of cheesy 60's space vibe with the glitter cape and the simple Jetsons-style space pod. Is it working within that context? What can I improve?

**[The Color Trilogy](http://imgur.com/a/xGtAj)**

This is a trilogy of pieces that can be displayed separately but are meant to be displayed together. (Display instructions are in the album.) I was exploring antique medical illustrations in a surrealist/psychedelic/pop art context.

**[Misplaced Sanguinity](http://imgur.com/8Ih6Q)**

This piece was done in the same style. I've had the idea of doing a piece on the concept of ""rose-colored glasses"" floating around in my head for a while now and decided to take a shot at it yesterday.

I know that some won't consider this ""art"" because it's done entirely in Adobe Illustrator, but I thought I'd take a shot at posting it here and see.

1313566204.0	jldlu	After discovering my Gouache paints of three years aren't, as I'd been using them, acrylic...	Kittles	8	1	6	"I guess Starcraft II has temporarily lost my interest because my art interests have seemingly spiked. Not only have I taken up Flash animation again, I've recently uncovered my old, school paints from several years ago and begun doodling with them. They're 'Designer's Gouache' and I have them in the primary colors, black, and white.

Anyway, because I limit my creativity to the computer, the few times I've used these paints I've used them as one would acrylic. I never really imagined watercolors would come in anything other than a yellow, Crayola clam shell. Guess this explains my frustration with all prior experiences; I had just concluded that I was a studio art failure. And perhaps I still am, but I'm working on that.

Now knowing the types of paints I possess, I'm here to receive feedback on what may very well be my first legitimate watercolor: 

[Ocotopod](http://i.imgur.com/2chXl.jpg)

I'd originally tried to paint it how I'd [conceived it](http://i.imgur.com/mojEx.png) in Flash, but figured watercolors were meant to be blended. I did my best and am happy with the result (save for a few back tendrils that I botched). What say you, ArtCrit? I'm open to anything.

Hey, guys. I'm looking for criticism on past works I've done over my senior year of high school. Whenever I show anything I've made to my art teachers or my friends, I usually just get an ""Oh wow, that's great"" or a ""You're so talented"". Hearing that does make me feel good, but I've realized that those kinds of compliments don't really push me anywhere or help me improve. Plus, my brother has told me that I need thick skin where I'm going to college in September (Savannah College of Art &amp; Design) after telling me about the heavy criticism he's received. 

So what a better way to start receiving criticism than here. What can you guys constructively say about these pieces? Anything I've done well and anything I can improve upon?"	t5_2qoaq	True

I'm new to painting and all artsy creative endeavors. I've been working in acrylics so far and realize I need to put in some work and volume of paintings to get anywhere close to where I want to be. A couple of questions for you folks:

1. Are certain mediums better for building foundations? I've tried drawing as I felt like it would get me closer to reality and let me build out my style from there but all my drawing turn out looking dissapointingly elementary (seriously, like a 7 y/o drew it), whereas with my paintings feel more abstract but I can see movement in a positive direction. 

2. How long did it take for you to find your ""voice"" or feel like you were expressing yourself without feeling like you didn't understand how to make your medium do what you want?

1325975703.0	o77cn	I am devoting 20 hours a week for the next year on improvement so I can make money off of commissions. What areas of my art should I really focus on?	italiciguana	8	2	26	"I have decided to pursue art seriously in my free time. For the next year I am going to devote at least twenty hours a week towards improvement. I have decided to do this with three specific methods: sketchbooks (3 hours), free commissions (3 hours), and comics (12 hours). This allows me to tackle learning, build a portfolio, and work on career projects.

But while sketchbook practices and comics will undoubtedly improve my art, they cannot earn me any money (perhaps comics will after five years or so). I accept that this year will be a zero income year, but by January 2013 I want to have improved enough to actually start charging a fair and justifiable amount on commissions. That means at least minimum wage for the time and effort I put into it, and to justify doing that over working a regular part-time job my senior year of college.

What I am asking you is to rate my general ability 1 to 5 (1 being complete amateur, 3 being semi-professional, and 5 being professional). I think I am about 1.7-2.3 on that scale, but other artists’ impressions might help me frame my ability better, and how much you think someone of my skill level could expect to improve in a year. I also hope to learn from you guys about what areas I am particularly weak in, and by studying I can vastly improve by next January. Any generalized tips about a dedicated period of improvement would be great too, or personal anecdotes about your own improvement are also welcome.

Here are some of the more recent examples of my work:

Huge fan of the third. I just like everything about it, though the colors couldve been a little more solid. Also really like the octopus in the fourth, but you'll have to disregard the background. I know it's apparent, but I don't put a lot of effort into filling the negative space as the focus right now is primarily on the creature. Eventually I'll plan my compositions more carefully. For now though, just practicing colors, which by the way, I'm not too big a fan of in the fourth, but I do like *how* it's colored. I think. I still snarl. 

Terrible with words. Oh, and I fixed the background in the second painting from yesterday. I don't know why I bother. [Double.](http://imgur.com/clXp4)"	t5_2qoaq	True

I highly encourage those with a knowledge of how to apply anatomy to their work to just say whatever you like!

Some recommended talking points:

* So I read the book, now how do i use that information?

* How to apply anatomical knowledge to a gesture drawing.

* Dynamic Anatomy, love it? hate it? what would you recommend instead?

* Does an artist ***need*** knowledge of anatomy?

I've always been a fan of sumi-e style stuff with heavy messy outlines and I'm trying to put a digital spin on it. I have a small series of pieces to do for an art class and I'm just looking for any tips to develop it or what's looking good and what could use some work.

Basic process is I put down the outline stuff in illustrator, then over to photoshop to color.

I'm not really looking for tips on anatomy or stuff like that. Yes this is traced from another image and due to time constraints they'll probably all be based heavily on a reference picture. I'm looking for thoughts on the style please!

RoseyCheekz	7	1	18	"I am a notorious lurker, but have recently been commenting on ArtCrit (two usernames no less! Retired one to keep anonymity). I know people post here to get honest opinions, good or bad, but I cannot bring myself to post negative critiques on posts that I genuinely dislike. I noticed I only comment on posts that I have something positive to say something about, or feel there is a lot of potential to be amazing. 

I realize I haven't posted any of my own pieces for critique at this point. But I am 29 and have had professional oil lessons since I was 10. I have used many mediums: pencil, colored pencil, oil, acrylic, sculpting, and special effect/movie makeup. I feel I have a good eye. And I aspire to be an art teacher. 

My question is: how many of you would actually prefer an honest but negative critique vs an honest but positive critique? If you look on someone's comment history and see only positive comments, do you disregard them? Or would you rather have lots of input even if it is negative? I am insecure myself, and am not at the place where I am comfortable hearing harsh words and losing anonymity. Maybe I am a coward. Although I up vote many posts I do not feel comfortable posting on (I really respect anyone that puts themselves out there and wants to better themselves), I currently only want to add compliments or constructive critiscism on pieces I feel something for. 

This is my long winded attempt at asking: honestly, how many of you that post here really want or are prepared to hear negative (but constructive) criticism on your work? Or would you rather someone post if they can offer compliments and critiques? Please be honest. I lurk, as many others do, because I second guess my opinion and feel like it may be overlooked or disregarded. I'd rather not waste my time writing a long winded, detailed novel (positive or negative) if no one really cares either way. "	t5_2qoaq	True

Be as honest as you want.

I lost myself on this commission, get me back on track with a powerful crit. I tend to prefer the use of bold colors with compliments to dull or force a pop, modern/contemporary styling and lines, and heavy symbology. 

The only thing I see of myself is this commission is heavy symbology. :(

This commission is to be used for a religious occasion of a teenager that will be marked by the reading of a passage in the old testament that discusses the biblical laws and use of the red heifer for purification. I obtained all the symbols and juxtapositions that I wanted by the use of the red heifer, ceder trees, lilacs, and burning fire on the top of a mountain. They are the model commission by not not restricting anything other than the size and cost.

I began the concept with a modeling of the red heifer after the primitive drawings in the Lascaux Caves. The rest fell into place. Now, I really don't think that it retained any contemporary feelings in it at all. 

What can I do, hopefully (I really don't have much time left) without repainting the entire thing or relocating entire elements, that can add back some contemporary life and vigor.

It actually takes a lot to make me second-guess myself and my direction, but today just dealt it out in spades.  First it was an article on Design Taxi showcasing [positive vibes in a can](http://designtaxi.com/news/351789/Passion-Love-Trust-And-Other-Intangible-Traits-In-A-Can/).  I'll admit it's a cute concept in a very kitsch sort of way; even if it strikes me as not particularly inventive, I suppose I can see where the broader common-denominator appeal might come into play.  Whatever.

Then came the article from a local paper about the Lawrence, KS ""artist"" who wanted to [display and slaughter chickens as a public art project](http://www.kansascity.com/2012/02/29/3460440/artists-message-flew-coop-amid.html#storylink=cpy).  While this just strikes me as stupid that this could ever even be considered anything remotely close to a legitimate art project, it also made me aware that there is a ""Center for Transcendental Poultry"" dedicated to promoting “the spiritual advancement of chickens.”

Alright, so now I'm starting to second guess why I even opened up my web browser in the first place today, and then came the (non-art-related) Huffington Post article about the [Teen Girl Exorcism Squad](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/01/teen-exorcism-squad-three_n_1313134.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003), and now I just don't want to live on this planet anymore.

I realize that I don't cater to a broad base of appeal, but I pour every ounce of effort and determination into every piece I lay my hands on to push it further than the last.  But why bother?  Why devote such extensive time and discipline?  I like the work I do, and I try to out-do myself as much as possible with every new one.  Most people have to be told that I'm working in colored pencil, and even then some have still called bullshit until they see it in action.

Granted, I make some pretty hideous shit most times, but I like to think that it's beautifully hideous.  

This is just a moment of personal resolve faltering, and I'll probably be over it tomorrow, but I just have to ask how some of you keep going.  Again, it normally takes a lot to put me in this kind of mood, but today was just one of those days where I'm just seeing all this crap and wondering if I shouldn't just cash in and pick up some sharpies and a hot glue gun."	t5_2qoaq	True

Faulenzerin	6	0	29	"I have my thesis exhibition in April, and I've got a series of monotypes that are fairly large (40""x26"").

I'd be looking at around $700 for frames alone, so would any of you have any suggestions or opinions of the importance of framing or any other ideas?
