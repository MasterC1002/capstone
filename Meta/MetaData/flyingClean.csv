1348537596.0	10fcqm	Whats the most nerve-racking thing thats ever happened while you were flying?	BFB4114	461	63	732	"I know for, as a low time pilot (under 150hrs) the most nerve-racking thing tht ever happend was on my long 250nm x-country for my commercial. Which was recently, maybe 2 weeks ago, anyway I chose to fly up to New Hampshire (KLCI). The flight school I fly out of is at KABE in PA so to get up there i had to fly over New York State and Vermont and a little bit of Massachusetts. All hills and trees. The flight getting up there went fine, was smooth flying and clear skies. I had to refuel, seeing that it was close to 3hrs to get up there in a little cessna 152. It was self serve gas, I had never done self serve before this, but it wasn't difficult and i was fueled up and on my way in no time. So as I am about maybe 1 hr into my flight to my next destination I notice that the fuel gauges are showing a completeley empty right tank and a completely full left tank. Over the course of my previous training I had come to learn that these gauges are inaccurate, but this was a little extreme for my liking. I let it go for a little bit and just kept a close eye on the gauges hoping the right tank would show more than empty and the left would show that it was draining into the engine. But after about 20 min of watching these gauges with intense apprehension they never changed. So at this point I am thinking crap..Im over Vermont and theres nothing but hills and trees for like 20 miles in every direction, Im screwed if this engine quits. I was genuinely fearful that my left tank was clogged or something had happened that it wasnt draining. I thought to myself well the fuel system in these planes is gravity driven so if i fly with a right bank the right tank wont be able to feed the engine and id know if the left wasnt either cause the engine would quit. I flew with a right bank and basically full left rudder for like 10 min just convincing myself that the left tank was working fine. And finally when im about 30 min from my destination airport the tanks start to show something close to accurate readings. I now know that those gauges are complete garbage in terms of knowing how much fuel you have left while flying.

I know this experience wont be anything ner as ridiculous as some of the things that have happened to you guys with tons of hours but I figured I would share this with you and hear about some of the scary stuff that has happened to you, So lets hear it!"	t5_2qm1t	True

1373416609.0	1hz2hc	Former UAL Pilot, talks about Korean Flight Training that will surprise you.	docfate_91351	209	29	53	"From a former UAL check captain.

After I retired from UAL as a Standards Captain on the –400, I got a job as a simulator instructor working for Alteon (a Boeing subsidiary) at Asiana. When I first got there, I was shocked and surprised by the lack of basic piloting skills shown by most of the pilots. It is not a normal situation with normal progression from new hire, right seat, left seat taking a decade or two. One big difference is that ex-Military pilots are given super-seniority and progress to the left seat much faster. Compared to the US, they also upgrade fairly rapidly because of the phenomenal growth by all Asian air carriers. By the way, after about six months at Asiana, I was moved over to KAL and found them to be identical. The only difference was the color of the uniforms and airplanes. I worked in Korea for 5 long years and although I found most of the people to be very pleasant, it’s a minefield of a work environment ... for them and for us expats.

  One of the first things I learned was that the pilots kept a web-site and reported on every training session. I don’t think this was officially sanctioned by the company, but after one or two simulator periods, a database was building on me (and everyone else) that told them exactly how I ran the sessions, what to expect on checks, and what to look out for. For example; I used to open an aft cargo door at 100 knots to get them to initiate an RTO and I would brief them on it during the briefing. This was on the B-737 NG and many of the captains were coming off the 777 or B744 and they were used to the Master Caution System being inhibited at 80 kts. Well, for the first few days after I started that, EVERYONE rejected the takeoff. Then, all of a sudden they all “got it” and continued the takeoff (in accordance with their manuals). The word had gotten out. I figured it was an overall PLUS for the training program.
  
We expat instructors were forced upon them after the amount of fatal accidents (most of the them totally avoidable) over a decade began to be noticed by the outside world. They were basically given an ultimatum by the FAA, Transport Canada, and the EU to totally rebuild and rethink their training program or face being banned from the skies all over the world. They hired Boeing and Airbus to staff the training centers. KAL has one center and Asiana has another. When I was there (2003-2008) we had about 60 expats conducting training KAL and about 40 at Asiana. Most instructors were from the USA, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand with a few stuffed in from Europe and Asia. Boeing also operated training centers in Singapore and China so they did hire some instructors from there.

  This solution has only been partially successful but still faces ingrained resistance from the Koreans. I lost track of the number of highly qualified instructors I worked with who were fired because they tried to enforce “normal” standards of performance. By normal standards, I would include being able to master basic tasks like successfully shoot a visual approach with 10 kt crosswind and the weather CAVOK.  I am not kidding when I tell you that requiring them to shoot a visual approach struck fear in their hearts ... with good reason.  Like this Asiana crew, it didnt’ compute that you needed to be a 1000’ AGL at 3 miles and your sink rate should be 600-800 Ft/Min. But, after 5 years, they finally nailed me. I still had to sign my name to their training and sometimes if I just couldn’t pass someone on a check, I had no choice but to fail them. I usually busted about 3-5 crews a year and the resistance against me built. I finally failed an extremely incompetent crew and it turned out he was the a high-ranking captain who was the Chief Line Check pilot on the fleet I was teaching on. I found out on my next monthly trip home that KAL was not going to renew my Visa. The crew I failed was given another check and continued a fly while talking about how unfair Captain Brown was.

  Any of you Boeing glass-cockpit guys will know what I mean when I describe these events. I gave them a VOR approach with an 15 mile arc from the IAF. By the way, KAL dictated the profiles for all sessions and we just administered them. He requested two turns in holding at the IAF to get set up for the approach.  When he finally got his nerve up, he requested “Radar Vectors” to final. He could have just said he was ready for the approach and I would have cleared him to the IAF and then “Cleared for the approach” and he could have selected “Exit Hold” and been on his way. He was already in LNAV/VNAV PATH. So, I gave him vectors to final with a 30 degree intercept.  Of course, he failed to “Extend the FAF” and he couldn’t understand why it would not intercept the LNAV magenta line when he punched LNAV and VNAV. He made three approaches and missed approaches before he figured out that his active waypoint was “Hold at XYZ.”  Every time he punched LNAV, it would try to go back to the IAF ... just like it was supposed to do. Since it was a check, I was not allowed (by their own rules) to offer him any help. That was just one of about half dozen major errors I documented in his UNSAT paperwork. He also failed to put in ANY aileron on takeoff with a 30-knot direct crosswind (again, the weather was dictated by KAL).

  This Asiana SFO accident makes me sick and while I am surprised there are not more, I expect that there will be many more of the same type accidents in the future unless some drastic steps are taken. They are already required to hire a certain percentage of expats to try to ingrain more flying expertise in them, but more likely, they will eventually be fired too. One of the best trainees I ever had was a Korean/American (he grew up and went to school in the USA) who flew C-141’s in the USAF. When he got out, he moved back to Korea and got hired by KAL. I met him when I gave him some training and a check on the B-737 and of course, he breezed through the training. I give him annual PCs for a few years and he was always a good pilot. Then, he got involved with trying to start a pilots union and when they tired to enforce some sort of duty rigs on international flights, he was fired after being arrested and JAILED!

  The Koreans are very very bright and smart so I was puzzled by their inability to fly an airplane well. They would show up on Day 1 of training (an hour before the scheduled briefing time, in a 3-piece suit, and shined shoes) with the entire contents of the FCOM and Flight Manual totally memorized. But, putting that information to actual use was many times impossible. Crosswind landings are also an unsolvable puzzle for most of them. I never did figure it out completely, but I think I did uncover a few clues. Here is my best guess. First off, their educational system emphasizes ROTE memorization from the first day of school as little kids. As you know, that is the lowest form of learning and they act like robots. They are also taught to NEVER challenge authority and in spite of the flight training heavily emphasizing CRM/CLR, it still exists either on the surface or very subtly. You just can’t change 3000 years of culture.

  The other thing that I think plays an important role is the fact that there is virtually NO civil aircraft flying in Korea. It’s actually illegal to own a Cessna-152 and just go learn to fly. Ultra-lights and Powered Hang Gliders are Ok. I guess they don’t trust the people to not start WW III by flying 35 miles north of Inchon into North Korea.  But, they don’t get the kids who grew up flying (and thinking for themselves) and hanging around airports. They do recruit some kids from college and send then to the US or Australia and get them their tickets. Generally, I had better experience with them than with the ex-Military pilots. This was a surprise to me as I spent years as a Naval Aviator flying fighters after getting my private in light airplanes. I would get experienced F-4, F-5, F-15, and F-16 pilots who were actually terrible pilots if they had to hand fly the airplane. What a shock!

Finally, I’ll get off my box and talk about the total flight hours they claim. I do accept that there are a few talented and free-thinking pilots that I met and trained in Korea. Some are still in contact and I consider them friends. They were a joy! But, they were few and far between and certainly not the norm.

  Actually, this is a worldwide problem involving automation and the auto-flight concept. Take one of these new first officers that got his ratings in the US or Australia and came to KAL or Asiana with 225 flight hours. After takeoff, in accordance with their SOP, he calls for the autopilot to be engaged at 250’ after takeoff. How much actual flight time is that? Hardly one minute. Then he might fly for hours on the autopilot and finally disengage it (MAYBE?) below 800’ after the gear was down, flaps extended and on airspeed (autothrottle). Then he might bring it in to land. Again, how much real “flight time” or real experience did he get. Minutes! Of course, on the 777 or 747, it’s the same only they get more inflated logbooks.

  So, when I hear that a 10,000 hour Korean captain was vectored in for a 17-mile final and cleared for a visual approach in CAVOK weather, it raises the hair on the back of my neck.

This is just a friendly notice to everyone on here, whether you rent or own, a few things about fueling and getting your aircraft fueled. 

* More importantly with low wing aircraft, since you step on the wings, but also in high wings, please stop getting in and out of the plane because it shakes the plane and fuel splashes around. If you are still in your plane before I'm fueling and want to get out, ask me to wait a minute or just stay until I'm done. I've had way too many experiences like this where fuel spills out on the wing and pilots actually get mad at me like it was my fault for missing the tank or something. 

* Even in skyhawks doing something like sliding the seat back from the outside will still shake the fuel around. Just please stop and wait ten minutes for the fueling to be done. 

* Also, it is your (the pilot's) responsibility to be present at your aircraft when it is being fueled. One exception I can think of is a rental plane at its home airport, but if you own a plane or are getting fuel away from home, you should always stay at your airplane when it is fueled. A lot of people just leave it there and run off to go to the bathroom or socialize. While you're relieving yourself in the bathroom, I could be pouring a bottle of water into your fuel tank, or stealing that nice pair of Bose headsets in your backseat. The point is don't trust a random line guy with your life. 

* Lastly, and most importantly, please please PLEASE check your fuel after. You have no idea how many people, even CFIs, that I watch after topping them off, they just start up and taxi away. Mistakes happen. You should ALWAYS take fuel samples anytime before you fly and after receiving fuel. Give it a few minutes to settle though because the process of fueling will stir anything up in there, so give it a couple minutes and take your samples. 

Thanks.

**EDIT:** Another one - everyone should know this, but before fueling begins make sure the **key is out, mags off, master switch off.** Put the key on the dash so whoever is fueling for you can see and make sure the mags are off."	t5_2qm1t	True

      It happened sometime in 1965, in Germany. I was a copilot, so I
knew, everything there was to know about flying, and I was
frustrated by pilots like my aircraft commander. He was one of those
by-the-numbers types, no class, no imagination, no “feel” for
flying.
    
      You have to be able to feel an airplane. So what if your altitude is
a little off, or if the glideslope indicator is off a hair? If it
feels okay then it is okay. That’s what I believed. Every time he
let me make an approach, even in VFR conditions, he demanded
perfection. Not the slightest deviation was permitted. “If you can’t
do it when there is no pressure, you surely can’t do it when the
pucker factor increases,” he would say. When he shot an approach, it
was as if all the instruments were frozen – perfection, but no
class.
     
      Then came that routine flight from the Azores to Germany. The
weather was okay; we had 45,000 pounds of fuel and enough cargo to
bring the weight of our C-124 Globemaster up to 180,000 pounds,
5,000 pounds below the max allowable. It would be an easy, routine
flight all the way. Halfway to the European mainland, the weather
started getting bad. I kept getting updates by high frequency radio.
Our destination, a fighter base, went zero/zero. Our two alternates
followed shortly thereafter. All of France was down. We held for two
hours, and the weather got worse. Somewhere I heard a fighter pilot
declare an emergency because of minimum fuel. He shot two approaches and saw nothing. On the third try, he flamed out and had to eject.
    
     We made a precision radar approach; there was nothing but fuzzy fog
at minimums. The sun was setting. Now I started to sweat a little. I
turned on the instrument lights. When I looked out to where the
wings should be, I couldn’t even see the navigation lights 85 feet
from my eyes. I could barely make out a dull glow from the exhaust
stacks of the closest engine, and then only on climb power. When we
reduced power to maximum endurance, that friendly glow faded. The
pilot asked the engineer where we stood on fuel. The reply was, “I
don’t know--- we’re so low that the book says the gauges are
unreliable below this point. The navigator became a little frantic.
We didn’t carry parachutes on regular MAC flights, so we couldn’t
follow the fighter pilot’s example. We would land or crash with the
airplane.
    
     The pilot then asked me which of the two nearby fighter bases had
the widest runway. I looked it up and we declared an emergency as we headed for that field. The pilot then began his briefing.
“This will be for real. No missed approach. We’ll make an ILS and
get precision radar to keep us honest. Copilot, we’ll use half
flaps. That’ll put the approach speed a little higher, but the pitch
angle will be almost level, requiring less attitude change in the
flare.”
     Why hadn’t I thought of that? Where was my “feel” and “class” now?
     The briefing continued, “I’ll lock on the gauges. You get ready to
take over and complete the landing if you see the runway – that way
there will be less room for trouble with me trying to transition
from instruments to visual with only a second or two before
touchdown.” Hey, he’s even going to take advantage of his copilot, I
thought. He’s not so stupid, after all.
    
     “Until we get the runway, you call off every 100 feet above
touchdown; until we get down to 100 feet, use the pressure
altimeter. Then switch to the radar altimeter for the last 100 feet,
and call off every 25 feet. Keep me honest on the airspeed, also.
Engineer, when we touch down, I’ll cut the mixtures with the master
control lever, and you cut all of the mags. Are there any questions?
Let’s go!” All of a sudden, this unfeeling, by the numbers robot was
making a lot of sense. Maybe he really was a pilot and maybe I had
something more to learn about flying.
  
    We made a short procedure turn to save gas. Radar helped us to get to the outer marker. Half a mile away, we performed the Before
Landing Checklist; gear down, flaps 20 degrees. The course deviation
indicator was locked in the middle, with the glideslope indicator
beginning its trip down from the top of the case. When the GSI
centered, the pilot called for a small power reduction, lowered the
nose slightly, and all of the instruments, except the altimeter,
froze. My Lord, that man had a feel for that airplane! He thought
something, and the airplane, all 135,000 pounds of it, did what he
thought.
     “Five hundred feet,” I called out, “400 feet……..300 feet…….200 feet,
MATS minimums…….100 feet, Air Force minimums; I’m switching to the
radar altimeter ……..75 feet nothing in sight……50 feet, still
nothing….25 feet, airspeed 100 knots,”
     The nose of the aircraft rotated just a couple of degrees, and the
airspeed started down. The pilot then casually said, “Hang on, we’re
landing.”
     “Airspeed 90 knots….10 feet, here we go!”
     The pilot reached up and cut the mixtures with the master control
lever, without taking his eyes off the instruments. He told the
engineer to cut all the mags to reduce the chance of fire. CONTACT!
I could barely feel it. As smooth a landing as I have ever known,
and I couldn’t even tell if we were on the runway, because we could
only see the occasional blur of a light streaking by
     “Copilot, verify hydraulic boost is on, I’ll need it for brakes and
steering.” I complied.
     “Hydraulic boost pump is on, pressure is up.” The brakes came on
slowly---we didn’t want to skid this big beast now. I looked over at
the pilot. He was still on the instruments, steering to keep the
course deviation indicator in the center, and that is exactly where
it stayed.
     “Airspeed, 50 knots.” We might make it yet.
     “Airspeed, 25 knots.” We’ll make it if we don’t run off a cliff.
Then I heard a strange sound. I could hear the whir of the gyros,
the buzz of the inverters, and a low frequency thumping. Nothing
else. The thumping was my pulse, and I couldn’t hear anyone
breathing. We had made it! We were standing still!
    
    The aircraft commander was still all pilot. “After-landing
checklist, get all those motors, radar and un-necessary radios off
while we still have batteries. Copilot, tell them that we have
arrived, to send a follow me truck out to the runway because we
can’t even see the edges.”
     I left the VHF on and thanked GCA for the approach. The guys in the
tower didn’t believe we were there. They had walked outside and
couldn’t hear or see anything. We assured them that we were there,
somewhere on the localizer centerline, with about half a mile
showing on the DME.
     We waited about 20 minutes for the truck. Not being in our customary
hurry, just getting our breath back and letting our pulses diminish
to a reasonable rate. Then I felt it. The cockpit shuddered as if
the nose gear had run over a bump. I told the loadmaster to go out
the crew entrance to see what happened. He dropped the door (which
is immediately in front of the nose gear) , and it hit something
with a loud , metallic bang. He came on the interphone and said
“Sir, you’ll never believe this. The follow-me truck couldn’t see us
and ran smack into our nose tire with his bumper, but he bounced
off, and nothing is hurt.”
    
      The pilot then told the tower that we were parking the bird right
where it was and that we would come in via the truck. It took a few
minutes to get our clothing and to button up the airplane. I climbed
out and saw the nose tires straddling the runway centerline. A few
feet away was the truck with its embarrassed driver.
     Total damage---one dent in the hood of the follow me truck where the
hatch had opened onto it.
     Then I remembered the story from Fate Is the Hunter. When Gann was
an airline copilot making a simple night range approach, his captain
kept lighting matches in front of his eyes. It scarred and
infuriated Gann. When they landed, the captain said that Gann was
ready to upgrade to captain. If he could handle a night-range
approach with all of that harassment, then he could handle anything.
     At last I understood what true professionalism is. Being a pilot
isn’t all seat-of-the-pants flying and glory. It’s self- discipline,
practice, study, analysis and preparation. It’s precision. If you
can’t keep the gauges where you want them with everything free and
easy, how can you keep them there when everything goes wrong?"	t5_2qm1t	True

Like most pilots, I know everthing that's ever gotten off the ground, and this is not of terrestial origin.  No visible means of support.

I don't believe in aliens but there it is.  I turn the plane toward it.  My heart is coming out of my chest, I'm sweating like a pig.  Fortunately the plane was well trimmed out, cause I'm shaking..  

As I got really close, it turned.... And on it's side I can see the word  ""Goodyear""...It's the blimp, seen on end, in the setting sun.. It's probably turning cause some idiot in a Cessna is buzzing it.

Below is TL;DR for anyone who has their checkride on the horizon. More or less copy pasted from the write up I am sending back to my flight school: Okay here it goes. Please excuse the wall of text, this is more or less copy pasted from the write up I'm going to send to my school for other students to read. Also just for reference I am based inside of the Washington DC Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ) and do 90% of my non XC flying inside of the DC Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA). My checkride took place at Stafford Regional Airport (KRMN) in Stafford, VA. I had to fly from Potomac Airfield (KVKX) to RMN and meet the examiner there. He had me plan a XC from KRMN to Charlottesville Airport (KCHO). My oral seemed very short, this may be because he saw I scored a 95 on the written exam and didn't see the need to grille me as much as someone who maybe got a 72. On to the show...


ORAL
AIRPLANE
Asked what kind of inspections an aircraft has to go through (annual, hundred hour for rental aircraft, prop, ELT, transponder, pitot static)

Started off by saying show me we have a legal airplane. I pulled out the maintenance books that my instructor and I tabbed out and we went over the various inspections : propeller overhaul, ELT, pitot static, annual, hundred hour, transponder. He didn’t have any questions on these. Added that of course POH, registration and airworthiness documents must be in plane.

What would happen if the pitot static system were blocked? (airspeed, altimeter, vertical speed would all be unreliable)

What about if you hit a bird and your pitot tube got clogged? (just the airspeed)

What if your static system failed? (use alternate static source)

What would you do if you retract the flaps but only one side comes up and the plane is rolling to the side that Is still down? (drop the flaps again to get symmetry)

Whose responsible if the plane is in an un-airworthy state? (owner or operator, if you are the pilot you are the operator)

What are the four forces acting on the airplane? (lift, thrust, drag, and when I first said weight he preferred the term gravity)

Climb performance: Using the climb performance to chart to determine climbing over a 2200 ft hill 3 miles off the end of the runway (just the example he gave me, know how to use the chart in the POH)

Follow up: How would your climb performance be in the summer? (Worse, higher density altitude)

REGULATIONS
What are the currency requirements for you to carry passengers? (day: three takeoff and landings in the preceding 90 days, night three takeoff and landings to a full stop in the period one hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise in the preceding 90 days)

What if you havn’t flown in a long time? What do you have to do? (every pilot has to go through a biannual flight review)

Inoperative equipment checklists: flow chart, (is it required by the airplanes POH (found in equipment list), is it required by FAR 91.205? how about for the type of operation you are conducting? Finally if it isn’t required do you want to fly without it?)

What do you have to do before you fly? (check the weather, check that you have a legal airplane, and check yourself, am I fit to fly? Am I sick? Am I fatigued? Etc)

CHART
IR routes (military training routes)

Blue dots inside of blue lines ( national parks )

Prohibited areas, restricted areas, warning areas, MOA’s

Some airfields have ticks around them while others are just circles, what does this mean? (airports with ticks have services such as fuel)

What is the ceiling of the KCHO class D? (3100 ft)

Flying from Petersburg (PTB) to new kent (w96) without a radio, how would you do that? (would have to stay clear of class C airspacace by flying underneath the 1400’ shelf)

Isogonic lines, what they are, why they are (the lines that tell you the magnetic deviation i.e. 10 degrees west over KCHO, it is the difference in magnetic north and true north, varies depending where you are on the planet)

What the big &amp; small number on the chart is (denotes the minimum safe altitude in that area, taking into account the highest obstacle with a small safety net added on)

VFR wx req’s in different airspaces, for my flight specifically G, E, and D airspaces. (G uncontrolled 3 miles clear of clouds, E enroute 3 miles 500 below 1000 above 2000 horizontally of clouds, D 3 miles visibility 500 below 1000 above 2000 horizontally)

What can you do if the wx at your destination is below vfr? (request SVFR clearance)

What are the requirements for SVFR at night in a class D? (pilot must be instrument rated and have IFR aircraft)

WEATHER
Looked at some graphic depictions on the computer. Asked what the curved red lines were ( warm fronts ) blue curved lines ( cold fronts ) red H (high pressur system) blue L (low pressure system).

What was a curved line that mixes red and blue segments (stationary front – when cold meets warm)

Winds aloft charts: look at the flag and say which wind the direction is and what the velocity is (long line is 10, short line is 5, flag is 50, double flag is 100 kts)

Using the current weather (45 degrees Fahrenheit) if you took off now and went to KCHO, with the same weather, what would you have to worry about? (Temp may be above freezing here at the surface but in flight it could be below freezing)

Follow up: What temp would you expect it to freeze? (Temp drops 2 degree per 1000 ft = about 6000 ft)

FLIGHT
We went out and he stood around while I pre-flighted, didn’t ask any questions. When I said I hadn’t bought fuel at RMN he said don’t worry about draining the fuel sump. Plane looked good so we got in and I went through the before starting checklists. Gave him my passenger brief, made sure he was wearing his seatbelt: always wear your seatbelt, explain you have PIC authority and what that means, asking for passenger assistance in watching out for birds, other aircraft, the ground, and other hazards and explaining the clock system for calling out ( X at 2 o clock ). Explain where the fire extinguisher is, show them the emergency exits and to exit at a 45 degree angle away from the engine, in the event of an emergency landing to crack the doors so they don’t get stuck. Explain what a sterile cockpit is and when it will be in use.

After getting the weather I briefed him that we would taxi to runway 15 which meant later we would have to be using a right hand pattern. After verbalizing clear left and clear right we taxi’d to the run up area, did our run up. Make sure my radios were set, RMN trfc and my departure frequency on standby, and my VOR’s were tuned in and to the right radial ( he had no questions for me about VORs). Before taking the runway I again verbalized clear on base, clear on final, runway is clear, before announcing my intentions on the advisory frequency. After takeoff we started the cross country I had planned out to KCHO. He had looked over the flight plan and weight and balance sheet just before the oral exam and had no questions about it. It’s mostly a straight shot out of Stafford which is nice, after departing the pattern turned onto my heading and we flew to our first checkpoint (the lake with the dam on it). Here he said ok you know where you are and know how to navigate yourself, let’s do some airwork. 

First we did our clearning turns, again verbalizing clear left, clear right. The first maneuver we did was steep turns. I talked myself through all the maneuvers before I began them. Note my heading, note my altitude, note my airspeed. I’m going to add a little power, then roll into the 45 degree bank, as I pass through 30 degrees of bank I’m going to put in a little nose up trim. If I am losing altitude I will take out just a few degrees of bank, if I’m climbing I will add in just a few degrees of bank. After one complete revolution we rolled right into the next one, same principles apply. These served as our clearning turns for the next maneuver.
After establishing ourselves back in straight and level flight he said we would do slow flight next. Again walked myself through it, noted my altitude and heading, I’ll pull the carb heat and then my power all the way back, immediately flaps 10, flaps 20 as I pass through 80 knots, flaps 30 as I pass through 65, add in nose up trim, hear the stall horn power up. We did a turn to the left followed by a turn to the right, these served as our clearing turns for the next maneuver. Then he had me recover. (He gave me the option to go straight into the power off stall a few seconds later but at this point I had already committed to the recovery).
Next was the power off stall. Set up the same as slow flight. Noted altitude and heading, carb heat on, power back, flaps in, nose trim, backpressure on the yoke. There’s the stall and recover. I left the flaps in until was certain we had a clear positive climb in. After that was the power on stall, I had trouble getting it to actually stall, finally we felt some buffets and I just recovered from that. He said we didn’t actually hit the stall but it was acceptable.

Next we did the instrument portion. I forgot to bring a hood but we made due by putting some tape over my sunglasses in flight, which worked out well. We started with a turning descent (focus on standard rate turn). Then the unusual attitude recovery. We did one nose down and one nose up. After that he had me do some turns to headings, again focus on standard rate turn. Then we lost our attitude indicator and had more turns to headings. Not a problem, watch your standard rate turn, vertical speed, and directional gyro. Then we lost the DG and had to turn off the compass. So watch your standard rate turn, vertical speed, and compass. He was satisfied with all of that, so I took the makeshift hood off and he said ok now you’ve got to do an emergency descent. I drew a blank for a while. I had only done this once with my instructor and that was a good 8 months prior. So I thought through it logically and just pointed the nose at the ground with a little bit of bank. We leveled off at 2000’ and he said ok now you’ve lost your engine. Ran through the emergency procedures. Pitch for 65, pick a landing spot. Try the restart : no good. Squawk 7700 radio mayday on 121.5 and begin shutting off fuel to the engine. Once you’ve made the field dump in the flaps, shut off the master switch and crack your doors and windows. At 1000’ he called go around. Then we did our ground reference maneuvers. He gave me the choice of doing S turns or turn about a point. I chose to do turn about a point. We picked a nice big water tower, entered from the downwind, and did one turn about it. He didn’t need to see it in both directions. After that he said we would go back to Stafford to do our pattern work, and allowed me to use the GPS to get back.

Again on every pattern I verbalized “clear on final, runway clear, clear on base” etc. Our first landing was the soft field landing, I landed a little harder than I would have liked for soft field but he said it was fine. Then we did our soft field takeoff, flaps 10, pull the yoke all the way back, no braking, no problems there. Next was the short field landing. He said you’re aiming for the 1000’ markers (big white blocks on the runway). Land short and you fail cause you’re in the grass, you’ve got a 200 ft window past the markers. That was fine, then the short field takeoff which we should have no problem doing coming out of VKX. Flaps 10, hold the brakes, power up, release brakes, climb at Vx (very important). Final part was the slip to landing. The way he said it was you just have to demonstrate a slip, not necessarily land in one, so if you wanted to add flaps in late you could. I decided to add them in short of the runway threshold. These caused me to balloon higher up than I thought I was and fall down to the runway – coming within a hair of failing me."	t5_2qm1t	True

Edit:  My concern is for the example being set and the one-upmanship.  Everyone is talking about losing an engine.  Read some accident reports, folks.  People fly perfectly good airplanes into lakes because the still water is disorienting.  People fly into power lines and guy wires.  You're more likely to hit birds.  Even military pilots with thousands of hours misjudge their altitude, or overestimate their performance capability.  The difference is that they have training and mission planning specific to low altitude events.  And even then, sometimes they ride it in.  "	t5_2qm1t	True

I'll keep posting as long as there's interest.  You can read the whole series [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/MyFirst1000/submitted/).*

There's an old saying in aviation: “It's better to be on the ground wishing you were flying than to be flying, wishing you were on the ground.”

There are dozens of aphorisms that get passed from instructor to student through the decades. If I had to pick just one to pass on to the students I hope to one day instruct, I think this would be it. It is a beautifully pure distillation of the philosophy behind aeronautical decision-making. It is also frighteningly true.

For about thirty seconds around Hour 288, my mind was flooded with a thousand competing thoughts. I was in the air, flying blind, deaf, and mute. I was frightened---more frightened than I'd been in my life. I had a critical decision to make and only seconds to make it. Quickly weighing my options, with survival seemingly in the balance, a quiet voice reminded me that, at that moment, I was flying while desperately wishing I was on the ground. It's a voice I hope never to hear again.

1362935807.0	1a13l7	Learning experience last night	spudmunkey17	108	11	54	"**TL;DR -** I unintentionally wound up in some severe turbulence and icing last night and need to vent.
-------------------
I figured I would share my experience, partly because I feel the need to tell someone, and I don't want to scare any of my family. Secondly, I think there were a couple things that happened last night that I and hopefully everyone else can learn from.

I was flying from KHDN (Hayden, CO, near Steamboat Springs) to KDWH (near Houston, TX) which is home base. It was me and two other company pilots on board. I'm still fairly new to the Pilatus PC12, so I took the ""empty"" (not counting the other company pilot in back) leg to get some more experience in it. We left around 5:30pm or so, noting that there was a line of storms building across central Texas, but it still looked like we could make our way around or through it.

An hour and a half or so into the flight, the Nexrad was showing That the line had filled in quite a bit, but we might be able to get around it on the south side near JCT. [Radar at the time, we were the pink dot.](http://imgur.com/aDU69LO,U6brsw8)

So, we asked for direct JCT and got it. Check of the fuel and time for the reroute, and we would get home with just over an hour of fuel to spare. That's reasonable.

Darkness fell, and as we aproached JCT the horizon off the left side of the airplane was a light show. The Nexrad just kept showing worse and worse news, as the line was stretching down towards DLF (Del Rio, TX, right on the border.) As we got near JCT, Ft. Worth center gave us a reroute over DLF, and I looked at our fuel. We didn't have enough to go that far. That was a 3 hour flight, we had 3:14 of fuel. Not happening.

A quick glance at the onboard radar showed no echoes in front of us, we were around 40 miles or so north of the line. We're in good shape for now, let's figure out where to stop for gas.

Before we had a chance to discuss much else, I notice the altimeter was climbing, but the attitude of the airplane was a bit nose down. I yanked the power back to idle and put my hand on the yoke. I knew what was coming. Va at our weight would have been around 130 knots, and just about when I got to 150, *WHAM*. My head hit the ceiling, and anything not secured went flying everywhere. Not 2 seconds after that, Heavy rain and/or hail started falling. I managed to reach up and turn on all of the ice protection despite feeling like a marble in a spray paint can.

The next several seconds were a blur, the autopilot disconnected itself, and I wrestled the airplane trying to keep the wings somewhat level and the pitch near the horizon. It was no easy task. 

Now, a quick refresher on severe turbulence. Altitude be damned, just keep the attitude level and watch the airspeed. Keep it below Va, but don't load the wings too much in the process. The goal is to minimize accelerations, navigation and altitude are secondary. DO NOT USE THE AUTOPILOT.

The right seat pilot, throughout this whole mess, just kept reaching up and turning the autopilot back on, making matters worse, and it would disconnect itself after a second or two anyway. I was a bit tied up mentally, so manners were out the window, and I finally yelled at him to leave the fucking autopilot off. I figured the autopilot constantly disconnecting itself would be enough to get the hint after a couple tries, but no.

While it felt like we were in this first wave for 20 minutes, I'm sure it was like 2 or 3 at most. It subsided a bit back to light-moderate turbulence, and I looked to notice we were about 1000' low. Like he was reading my mind, the controller asked us about our altitude. We told him about the severe turbulence and that we may need some block altitudes. He happily gave us discretion on the altitude. I clicked the autopilot back on, and started getting back on altitude.

Another look at the onboard radar, and the Nexrad, and we were still not showing anything. What a helpless feeling. I wanted nothing more than to avoid this shit, but you can't avoid what you can't find. The only thing showing up was the line, still 40+ miles south of us.

I glance out the side window to look at the wing. It looked like a snow cone. Boots were on, not much we could do. Airspeed was still reasonable for the power, airplane was flying fine.

Just as we had caught our breath and started again to figure out where to go, wave 2 hit. It was worse than the first. Same process, and yet again, the right seater just kept turning the autopilot on after it disconnected itself. I don't know if it was stress, fear, or just bad habits, but yet again, I had to snap at him to get him to quit.

[Radar of about where/when the severe ice and turbulence were](http://imgur.com/aDU69LO,U6brsw8#1)

I hear the cooler in the back hit the roof and ice and sodas bouncing around. I've got a death grip on the yoke and am doing all I can to keep the thing level. Despite my best efforts, bank was 45 degrees or more at moments. Pitch and airspeed were a bit more controllable, and I focused on doing whatever I could to roll with it and minimize the loads on the airframe. Again, what I'm sure was a minute or two felt like eternity.

Wave 2 subsided, and we gathered our bearings. Things were smoothing out, and I was able to see a hint of clear sky above. We asked for higher and got it. Ok, time to plan.

I propose we find a nearby airport that has decent weather and go for it. We're over central-ish Texas, where there isn't a whole lot of options. Luckily we happened to be about 40 miles from San Angelo (KSJT.) Quick check of the weather there, and it's good. I confer with the other two pilots, the one in the back agrees without hesitation, but the right seat is still looking at getting around the line to get home.

After a short discussion, we all agreed that San Angelo was our best bet. We wind our way down from FL270, just circling around. The controller was awesome, he basically said ""Do whatever you need to do, own navigation, 4000' or higher until you see the field. This freed us up to dodge what we could see now as there were some breaks in the IMC. 

After a relatively uneventful visual approach to KSJT and a couple of hours of waiting to see what the weather would do, we caught a hotel and slept it off.

**Hour 83**

We were on a 2 mile final and I was sweating. It was a sunny afternoon in May. A few minutes earlier when we’d slowed to approach speed, the reduced airflow through the cabin had turned the cockpit of our Cessna 172 into a sauna. I was concentrating on keeping the runway threshold at a constant point in the windscreen and running through the before-landing checklist in my head. My instructor, Gary, was at my side. 

Fuel selector … both.

Carb heat … on.

The Santa Monica PAPI was showing three white and one red.  I’ve gotta get down there...

Flaps … full.

Seatbelts … fas--

My concentration was interrupted by a sudden whoosh of air in the cockpit.  I looked over and, to my horror, Gary’s window was open!

“Am I allowed to open the window like that?” he asked. I was now on short final. My blood pressure started to rise.

“I-- I don’t know.”

“Is the plane still flying?” Gary persisted.

I started to feel overloaded. “Let’s talk about this on the ground.”

“Good,” he said.

We landed. Once the propeller stopped, Gary turned to me.

“Listen carefully. Lots of things are going to happen to you up there. Maybe a window opens, or a radio starts acting funny, or a light doesn’t work. That stuff isn’t dangerous by itself. What’s dangerous is that they distract you.  Pilots get into trouble when they get distracted by a minor problem and forget to fly the plane. *Your first job is to fly the plane.* Don’t panic. Just fly the plane.”

Gary was right. I would later read about many accidents caused by pilot distraction.  Perhaps the most famous is [Eastern Airlines Flight 401](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_401).  Shortly before landing on a dark night, the crew couldn’t verify that their landing gear was down and locked.  All three pilots in the cockpit diverted their attention to solving the problem. None of them noticed that the autopilot had been misconfigured; the plane gradually flew itself into the Florida Everglades.  Burned-out light bulbs can’t crash planes, but they can distract pilots from their duty fly one.


**Hour 142**

Vegas, baby!  In my own private plane!  Could there be anything cooler?

Several months had passed since the window incident. I was now a private pilot and well into my instrument training. I was also an airplane owner! After months of searching I’d finally brought home a Cessna Cardinal RG.  I’d already gotten 10 hours of dual instruction in my new craft, but my insurance also required me to fly 10 hours solo before carrying any passengers.  I planned some short trips on my own, the last of which was to Vegas and back.  It’s not a fun city without friends, so I hadn’t planned to stay -- just fly up, get a bite to eat at the airport, and fly home.

My plan was to land at Las Vegas International which lies at the center of a mass of Class B airspace.  Learning to fly around LAX, I’d gained plenty of experience flying near Bravo airspace … but into it?  Not as much.  I reviewed the charts and mentally prepared to tangle with complex and unfamiliar airspace and its controllers.

It was a sweltering Saturday afternoon.  The weather was perfect, but the instructors standing around the flight school had a concern.

“Make sure you’re hydrated before you go up there,” one said. The route from LA to Vegas goes through the Mojave Desert.  “You don’t want to get light-headed or pass out while you’re flying!  And make sure you have extra water in case you go down.”

Wise advice, it seemed.  I drank a bottle of water.  Then downed a second just to be sure.  For good measure, I also filled a sport bottle with ice water and stuffed it into my flight bag. I lifted off from Santa Monica and pointed the plane towards the mountain pass to Palmdale.  The plane was operating beautifully -- let me tell you, there’s almost nothing that beats flying 165 m.p.h over a highway while the cars underneath you are stuck in traffic.  I settled in at 7,500’ for the 90 minute flight. Vegas, baby!

As I reached the desert I realized a slight flaw in my flight planning.  All that water was having the obvious effect.  I had to pee. *It’s not that bad,* I told myself. *This can wait.  I’m only an hour away from landing.* Vegas!!

Over the next ten minutes my body informed me, no, this wouldn't wait an hour. I tried to focus on the sectional chart but my mind kept wandering to Niagra Falls and the giant Bellagio fountain.  I’d be tangling with Bravo airspace soon but couldn’t even think straight!

OK, I thought.  What are my options?  I looked down and found the only one: my sport bottle.  Step 1 was to empty it.  The only place to do that seemed to be into my stomach. Have you ever tried throwing back a pint of ice water at a time when your bladder feels one turbulent bump away from rupturing?  It’s not easy!  I finally managed to do it, feeling like an overfilled water balloon.

All right.  Almost there.  Now for Step 2: refill the bottle. The air was smooth and the radio was quiet.  I might just be able to get away with this!

I carefully trimmed the plane until it flew straight and level without control inputs. I took my hands off the controls tentatively -- nothing seemed to happen. *All right, J., you can do this.* I opened the bottle, ever-so-carefully unzipped and got myself into it. The relief that followed was indescribable.  Euphoria!

Relief quickly turned to panic. The bottle seemed to be filling at an alarming rate.  Was it possible that my bladder actually had a larger capacity than this bottle? I really didn’t want to find out empirically.  I’d owned this plane for 3 weeks and I sure wasn’t going to let my own pee geyser erupt from this bottle all over my upholstery!

Alas, the bottle was opaque. I willed myself to stop peeing, pulled myself out and peeked in the bottle to check how much space was left.  This cycle repeated several times, one hand holding the bottle and the other holding myself to prevent pee from spraying everywhere like a loose firehose.  I had no hands free to fly the plane.  The situation was … let's just say: delicate.

The third time through this dance I realized something alarming: my gonads were cold.  Oh no!  Cold gonads must mean there was a fluid leak.  Crap!

Then I noticed something else: a hiss.   *Ssssssss.......*  What was that?  I realized I was cold because of air, not liquid. Where was this airflow coming from?

A moment later, this question was answered.  *SssssssssssssPOP.*  The latch had not been secure.  My door popped open!

Oh.  Holy.  Hell.

My indicated airspeed was about 120 m.p.h. and turbulent air was rushing around the cockpit.  It was also the first moment in my life I remember being afraid of heights.  I sat for a moment, dumbfounded.  My heart raced.  Both hands were still occupied holding my bottle and my junk.  What the hell do I do!?

*Don’t panic*, Gary’s words echoed through my head.  *The plane still flies fine with the door open.*

Oh god. Ok. Let’s figure this out.  First thing’s first: I decided that this was not an emergency.  Flailing around would make it one -- let’s avoid that. The only thing that would make this an emergency, I reasoned, would be if I somehow fell out of the plane. I used my non-bottle hand to verify my seatbelt was secure. I also checked behind me to make sure there was nothing loose in the back seat that might depart the aircraft.

All right. I decided I was safe. What next?  I needed both hands to close and latch the door.  My hands, however, were occupied with Operation PeePlosion. So, I reasoned, the correct next step was to finish peeing.  I would look back later and see this as having been my first major executive decision as a pilot-in-command.  With wind whipping around my feet I filled the remaining third of the bottle, sealed it up, and set it on the floor like a boss.

Finally, with both hands now free, I tried to close the door -- no luck.  The wind was too strong.  I throttled back, slowed the plane down to about 75, and was able to slam and latch it at last.

I made my way into Las Vegas, landing on runway 19R and shutting down in front of the executive terminal where all the fancy private jets land.  I grabbed the bottle and hopped out of the plane to use an actual restroom and find some food.

I took 20 steps and froze: it was Las Vegas.  It was a Saturday afternoon.  Playboys and party girls were descending on the city.  There were two private jets parked in front of me; they literally had red carpets running out to them.  Fashionable men were emerging from the aircraft with women on their arms -- blonde, leggy women in skin-tight clubbing dresses and immaculate makeup.  They were ready for a night on the town.  I was standing there in a ratty t-shirt, unshaven, and holding a warm bottle of my own piss. 

I couldn’t do it.  I turned back.  I found a quiet spot on the tarmac near my tie-down and emptied the bottle onto the ground.  I hoped it would be discrete, but …. I guess I hadn’t had enough to drink after all.  The pee was a radioactive shade of yellow.

“Well, at least this can’t get any *more* embarrassing,” I thought to myself.

Wrong.

“CLEAR!”  Someone parked in the next row started up their turboprop.  The propwash started to propel my giant ocean of shame downwind, spreading it out over the tarmac and spraying warm pee all over me and my plane.

I looked up to see a lineman giving me a icy glare.  He shook his head sadly and drove off.

I returned to Vegas a couple of weeks later.   It doesn’t rain there very often so the ramp was still stained yellow. I hope it's gone by now, but if you're ever there and see a yellow patch, raise a sport bottle and toast the day I learned how to keep my cool."	t5_2qm1t	True

Last chance is to appeal to the Oregon House of Reps. I'm not sure when that vote is scheduled, but let's get busy contacting representatives. Please spread the word.

EDIT: ""Tonight"" was last night.

This just in from the Columbia Seaplane Pilots Association... State senate is voting tomorrow morning on this issue (SB 602) that could prevent state waters from being used by aircraft. If you're an Oregon pilot, ASES or not, chime in to state your opposition to this bill. [Look up](http://www.leg.state.or.us/findlegsltr/) your state (not federal) senator. In my case, my state senator is Richard Devlin. Here's my letter to him:

=====

&gt;Senator Devlin,

&gt;As both a pilot and a canoe paddler, I exist on both sides of the debate for these interest groups who seem to be at odds regarding floatplane usage of Waldo Lake. I can firmly state however, that I wish to see Waldo Lake and other state lakes remain open to floatplane usage and access.  Here's why:

&gt;Floatplanes have a very light environmental footprint, much less so that power boats, because their exhaust does not contact the water. They also do not have a propeller in the water. They are, in essence, just like a kayak or canoe in terms of impact, and they number far fewer than boats.

&gt;SB 602 would prevent pilots from using Waldo Lake and other state waters for landing, which would be a tragedy for many reasons. Since floatplanes must use water for landing, Waldo and other lakes provide very important chain of safety zones should the aircraft encounter engine trouble on a cross-country flight. The number of floatplanes active in the state of Oregon is less than other states, however our state has a large body of active pilots who stand firmly on this issue that our state waters remain open. To deny them access would be unfair, and has few benefits. For example, Minnesota enjoys a very healthy and active float flying population that even contributes to many of the local economies around the state, as do Washington, Alaska, Florida, and Maine to name a few.

&gt;Please vote NO on SB 602 and help preserve my access to public waters.

&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;------ -----------

**Hour 195**

I shut down the plane, my shirt back darkened from having sweat through it. I’d just finished shooting 3 approaches with my instructor, Gary. It was a clear day, of course: there’s no better way to make sure the weather is clear than to go up in the air for instrument training. I’d been flying under the hood for an hour and half and was exhausted.

“Workin’ pretty hard today, were you?” Gary said, noting my sticky clothing as we walked back to the flight school.

“No, it’s not that at all. It’s just so hot up there,” I said.

“Oh yeah? Why isn’t my shirt soaked then?”

I laughed -- he’d caught me. Mental note: wear light shirts for flight training.

“It’s hard, I know you’re working hard,” he said. “But it’s worth it. Someday you’ll be up there, and there will be clouds, and you’ll be able to use your instrument ticket to get home. And let me tell you something, if the weather is low, and you come all the way down to minimums and then pop out of the clouds with the runway right where it’s supposed to be...”.  He got a faraway look in his eyes for a moment, then looked back at me.

“It’s better than sex.”


**Hour 326**

“You should come out! We’re having a barbeque for the Fourth of July!”

We’d gotten the same offer two years in a row. Last year we hadn’t really considered it, but this year we were excited. My girlfriend, D., worked with a woman who lived in Chino. With traffic, it was nearly a two hour drive from Santa Monica; how she ever survived that daily commute on LA freeways I’ll never know. The year before, the prospect of spending that much time on the road for a barbeque didn’t seem all that appealing. But this year I was an aircraft owner.  Once we found out she lived a few miles from the Chino airport? Of course we’ll be there!

The afternoon of the Fourth was a mild, clear day. We made the quick drive over to the airport, preflighted the plane, and started to head east. The sheer size of Los Angeles is just amazing, and I really never appreciated it until I started flying.  Most cities have a tightly packed downtown area that quickly becomes greener and more suburban.  LA, in contrast, is just mile after unending mile of dense city.  We stayed fairly low, at about 2,000’, to avoid entering the Los Angeles Bravo airspace and followed Interstate 10 inland.  After a few minutes we reached the interchange with I-5, my landmark that it was safe to start heading further south.  I punched Chino into my GPS.

As a precaution, I was getting flight following from SoCal Approach. I nearly always get flight following anyway: it makes me feel safer knowing someone is watching me, I have someone I can instantly reach in case of emergency, and I hear about updated areas of restricted airspace and hazards such as skydivers. My plan was to squeeze in between the Los Angeles Bravo and El Monte’s Class D airspace. Flight following was an extra pair of eyes on radar warning me if I went astray.  Plus if I did violate the Bravo, the impact would be minimized since I’d already be talking to its owner. Controllers get much more upset over violations by someone they’re not talking to than someone they are.

It was a perfect day to fly. The air was smooth and it wasn’t too warm. Staying that low, the Cardinal’s engine had all the air it needed to develop full power, so we were fast. Even in straight-and-level flight, the airspeed indicator was creeping into the yellow.

D. and I had a guest in the plane.  One of her co-workers also lived in Santa Monica and wanted a ride. She was soaking it all up. “So you can just fly up here however you want?” “How fast are we going?” “How many airports are there around here?”

The barbecue was great fun. I didn’t drink, of course, but I was never much one for beer anyway. Everyone wanted to hear the story of how we’d flown out there. As 9pm approached and the summer sun set, our hosts dropped us back off at the airport on their way to see the Chino fireworks. 

“Are the fireworks going to hit your plane?” they asked.

Well that was certainly a good question! The briefer hadn’t mentioned anything about fireworks when I’d called in the morning. I called back and still he didn’t mention anything, so I asked.

“It’s Fourth of July, do I have to be careful of fireworks shows?”

“There’s nothing in the NOTAMs about it. I think fireworks usually don’t go above about 3 to 400 feet.”

Well that’s a relief.

I got out my night-flying kit -- flashlights of every size and shape -- and preflighted the plane. The three of us climbed in.  We launched into the balmy, cloudless evening air and into a sight I will never forget:

Fireworks. Fireworks *everywhere.*

Even on a normal day, flying over LA at night is quite a sight. Ground lights seem to stretch out to infinity as the packed city spreads in every direction. But that night there were thousands of people celebrating on the one night when explosives are socially acceptable. Everywhere we looked, every moment we looked, there were literally dozens of fireworks exploding somewhere below us. It was a dynamic, undulating carpet of bursting color that moved as you watched it. It was just stunning. Both my passengers spent the next 20 minutes with their noses pressed against the plexiglas.

“It’s just … oh my god, J. I’ve never seen anything like this.”

I had to pry my eyes off the ground and remember to fly the plane. I tuned in the Santa Monica ATIS and the halting, computerized voice of the automated weather station brought my carefree evening to an end:

“Santa Monica Airport, Automated Weather Observation, 0604 zulu. Wind calm. Visibility 10. Sky condition, overcast, six hundred...”

The marine layer had come in.  It had come in right at minimums. This was getting interesting.

Van Nuys was just 6 miles to the north and was usually a good backup - they had an ILS, which meant lower minimums.  Plus, the Santa Monica Mountains in between the two airports usually kept the marine layer at bay. Their ATIS was still reporting clear skies. I decided I’d try the approach at Santa Monica, maybe even try it twice, and then go to Van Nuys.  We still had four hours of fuel.

“We might end up at Van Nuys,” I told my passengers. “I’ll get us a cab back to Santa Monica if we do. But we’ll try to land at Santa Monica first.”

I told flight following I wanted a pop-up IFR clearance, which they granted. I already had the plate at hand. We were still flying in completely clear air -- even 20 miles away, the marine layer was out of sight.

“Cardinal 15H, 3 miles from BEVEY, turn right heading 250, maintain 3,000 until established, cleared for the approach.” 

Then I saw it: a thick layer of clouds below, in a crescent shape ending about 8 miles inland.  The airport was right in the center of it; there was no way we’d get in visually. I intercepted the final approach course and started down.

“OK guys. I need your help. We’re going to be going right down to minimums, and my eyes will be on the instruments. So look out the front and let me know when you see the runway.  It should be ahead and to our right. I’m not going to talk since I’ll be concentrating on flying.”

The clouds were just a couple of hundred feet below us. I checked the GPS. The status panel had gone from ARMED to ACTIVE -- we had the computer’s blessing to shoot the approach.

“We’re going in.”

We reached the cloud tops and continued down. The plane sank into a thick fog. The wingtips were barely visible and the strobe lights reflected brightly back into the cockpit.

“Whoa,” our passenger said.

We were right on course. I’d done this approach dozens of times in training … but usually wearing a hood.

“One thousand,” I said out loud.  We were at 1,700’, with a thousand feet left to go before we had to abandon the approach.

I worked on keeping my breathing even. The air was silky smooth so the approach was going well.  We were still going right down the center.

“500.”

We passed the last waypoint, CULVE.  I immediately chopped the power back to idle -- this approach was really steep due to the skyscrapers in Century City and Westwood.

“300.”

The cockpit was totally silent other than the even sounds of the engine. We were still in a thick soup.

“200.”

In my peripheral vision, I thought I saw a flicker of black ground beneath me. I tried to push it out of my head and just keep watching the gauges. 

“100.”

“I see the ground!” our back-seat passenger said in an excited whisper.

D. was up front. She was still peering out the windscreen.

“50.”

I had my hand on the throttle to avoid overshooting. I was about to move it when--

“I see it!”

We popped out the bottom. The runway was ahead and to our right, exactly where it was supposed to be. The city lights were all around us and a carpet of low fireworks heralded our arrival. 

Fan...fucking... *tastic*.

I made my last traffic calls on the CTAF and landed.  I pulled off the runway and the moment I stopped, even before I could retract the flaps, I burst into laughter.

It was my first approach to minimums. Gary had been right again.

*Epilogue: Flying on July 4th can be exhausting, stressful, and a lot of fun. If you do it in a high traffic area, make sure you keep your eyes outside for other aircraft. Beware of ""moose stalls"".  Here's a picture we took last [July 4th over Seattle](http://i.imgur.com/L6yuB.jpg) -- the Space Needle is visible at top right.*

Shortly after takeoff from a busy Class D, I noticed a strong, strange smell and light smoke coming either from under the panel or under the seats in my rental Piper.

The smell was not one of burning oil, or an ordinary ""fire"" smell. I couldn't identify it, it didn't smell like what I normally associate with burning electronics. Still, I assumed that an electrical fire was at least a possibility.

I was only maybe a mile upwind, still inside the Class D, so I called the tower, who was clearing another aircraft for takeoff behind me, told them I was declaring an emergency, that I had smoke in the cockpit, returning immediately to the field and landing on the runway I took off from, and that I'd be turning off my radios.

Just before I flipped the master switch off, I heard the tower clear the previous aircraft for an immediate takeoff or to clear the runway for the emergency aircraft inbound. I made a tight downwind and base to final, landed and turned off at the first taxiway. At the end of the taxiway, there was a huge hulk of a firetruck, and a pickup truck from the airport authority. I pulled the mixture, parked the plane, and got out. 

By now the smoke had cleared out, though I didn't know if that was from turning off the electrics or from opening the storm window and the cabin vents. I left the plane, and the firefighters had a quick look around before declaring the airplane safe. I spoke briefly to the man from the airport authority who took my name and address, and radio'ed the tower to ask if they needed any further information from me. ""No,"" was the answer.

So, the flight school towed the plane to the maintenance hangar where I spoke with one of the mechanics. He told me he suspected it was engine degreaser that had dripped into the muffler shroud and started burning off when I applied takeoff power, which generated enough heat. In short, it was benign, and probably would have stopped in its own in a few minutes.

However, both he and the owner of the flight school said I made the right call returning. They passed no judgement on declaring an emergency for it, though I feel comfortable that I made the right decision.

Anyhow, I just wanted to share this story for anybody who has ever felt any nervousness about declaring an emergency. There is no paperwork involved, there's no legal ramifications (as long as you weren't negligent, I suppose). ATC and the rest of the system is there to help you get from place to place safely, and they will do whatever they can to make sure that happens. It was no more than two or three minutes from my emergency call to being on the taxiway, and they already had the trucks there waiting for me."	t5_2qm1t	True

**Hour 34**

Learning to fly in Santa Monica has advantages and disadvantages.  There's certainly no shortage of interesting things to see on the ground -- whether it's the shoreline, Disneyland, the Hollywood Sign, or Griffith Park Observatory, L.A. basin pilots get to see a lot more than student pilots in a random town in Oklahoma.  The congested airspace is among the most complex in the country, with LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Orange County, Van Nuys, Santa Monica, and a dozen smaller airports all packed within 30 miles of each other.  One downside is that training takes a lot longer; it's a 20 minute flight to the nearest practice area and a 20 minute flight back. One upside, however, is that I can confidently fly in dense airspace surrounded by big jets.  This confidence started at Hour 34.

It had been just a few days since my first solo and I was feeling on top of the world.  This was a problem for my instructor, Gary.  He was one part grand wizard of aviation, one part crotchety old man, and one part car salesman.  (He was, in reality, all three of these things.)  With over 8,000 hours of instruction under his belt, he felt strongly that an overconfident pilot was an unsafe pilot.  My recent success required a new challenge to keep my ego in check.

""You're going to get a real workout today,"" he warned.

He first had me fly to Van Nuys, just a few miles north of Santa Monica.  No problem; I'd been there before.  The flight was easy.  But after we landed, we taxiied back, and he said, ""Ok.  Now fly me to Burbank.""

Burbank?  That airport 6 miles away that has commercial service?  737s and MD80s lined up for miles to land? The one in the middle of Class C airspace?  You want me to land *there*?

He sat back and let me sweat.  There'd be just 4 minutes from takeoff to landing; in that time, I'd have to talk to at least 3 different controllers.  I pored over my charts, writing down all the frequencies I'd need and planning my arrival at an airport that surely had better things to do than let me train there.  After we lifted off, I turned east.  Sweating profusely, I got a handoff from Van Nuys Tower to SoCal Approach, then to Burbank.  Before I knew it, I'd landed on Runway 8.  I pulled off the runway just as a 737 roared overhead, departing the intersecting runway.  I had to admit, tough as it was, this was really cool.

""OK, now what?""

""Tell him you want to do some pattern work.""

I looked around.  It was mid-morning -- aviation rush hour.  The airport was buzzing with activity.  A dozen big passenger jets were taxiing around.

""Pattern work *here*?  Really?""

""I told you you were in for a workout.""

The controller was surprisingly happy with the idea.  He'd have us take off from one runway and land on the other, stuffing us in between big-iron departures and arrivals wherever he could.  Occasionally, we'd have to wait for 10 minutes on the ground, but I didn't care -- waiting in line with big commercial jets, talking to the same controllers, and using the same runways made me feel like a real pilot!

Burbank has two [intersecting runways](http://img.airnav.com/aptdiag/w240/02315.gif), but they intersect pretty close to their ends. In theory, one might be issued a LAHSO clearance--- e.g., ""Cessna 123, Runway 15, cleared to land, hold short of runway 8."" But in practice, the distance from the Runway 15 threshold to the intersection is about 5,000', more than any competent (cough cough) Cessna pilot would ever reasonably need to land.

So there I was, doing takeoffs and landings with Gary at my side. We took off from Runway 8 (going east), and the controller told us to turn left and expect to land on Runway 15. We turned north, and a few moments later when we were directly abeam the end of the runway I heard: ""Cessna 831, turn left direct for the numbers now, Runway 15, cleared to land. Traffic on a 4 mile final."" In other words, someone else was also lining up to land on Runway 15 and the controller was trying to sneak me in first.

Attempting to comply, I did 180 degree turn to line up with Runway 15, even though I was directly abeam the threshold.  This left me with virtually no space between me and the runway to descend.  I'd extended the flaps and idled the throttle before starting the turn, but we were still ridiculously high.  Crossing over the Runway 15 threshold I was still 200' in the air. I pushed the yoke, trying to coax the plane onto the ground, but picked up way too much speed as the plane went downhill.  With half the 6,800' runway behind us, I was still 30 knots too fast. I wrestled the Cessna to the ground, bounced high, descended again, and finally got the wheels down as the airspeed bled off. As we rolled out, we got confused about which taxiway we were allowed to turn at, and ended up drifting past the runway intersection. 

""Southwest 624, Go around.""

Awww, crap.

In addition to the guy behind me, apparently a 737 was also landing on the intersecting Runway 8. The controller hadn't given us a LAHSO -- the Southwest jet was far enough away that the controller reasoned, in the *incredibly* unlikely event I crossed the LAHSO line, he'd just have the conflicting traffic go around and try again.  And this is how, one day, I cost Southwest Airlines $5,000 worth of fuel.  Oops.

20 minutes later we were ready to go home.  ""Sorry we made that guy go around,"" I told the controller as we were exiting his airspace.

""Sorry we didn't get you around more times!""

I laughed -- no hard feelings on the ground, at least!  But Gary was angry.

""First of all,"" he began, ""don't admit a mistake on the radio.  They record all this!"" 

Then he said something that's always stuck with me:

""And don't you apologize for using an airport or talking to a controller.  It's your airspace just as much as anyone else's.""

I'll keep posting as long as there's interest.  You can read the whole series [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/MyFirst1000/submitted/).*

I have to open this story with an admission: I didn’t tell the entire story of my [flight out of Winslow](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/wiuah/my_first_1000_winslow/). For every takeoff, there must be a landing, and the landing in Alburquerque would not have happened the way it did if the takeoff in Winslow had gone differently.

**Hour 358**

Even after the engine cooled after our frightening takeoff, the flight was not pleasant. The desert floor was heated by the unrelenting late August sun and made for one of the most turbulent flights I’d experienced. As a passenger, turbulence can be nauseating and frightening; as a pilot, it’s exhausting. During the cruise phase of a normal flight I get to sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the world pass underneath. In turbulent flight, it’s a constant battle to keep the plane on the right heading and at the correct altitude, constantly re-trimming and fussing with the throttle, rarely getting more than a few moments of rest. My stress level skyrocketed as we left Winslow, and the turbulence kept me from ever really relaxing even after the threat of mushing into the ground on takeoff had abated.

By the time we reached Alburquerque, I was ready to be on the ground. The problem was I was scared of the ground. I delayed our descent as long as possible, and made my final approach at nearly twice the recommended speed. I kept thinking, “If I have to abort the landing and go around, I want to make damned sure I have enough speed to climb out.” I’d been so frightened by what happened in Winslow that I was now irrationally hoarding energy exactly as a man who once almost died of starvation might hoard food. My approach speed kept creeping up and up -- the runway is 13,000’ long, I reasoned, so why not?

Touching down at 120mph in a plane whose normal touchdown speed is 65 certainly taught me a lesson. The moment the main landing gear touched the tarmac, the nosewheel came slamming down and the plane bounced 30 feet back in the air. I tried to coax it back down, overcorrected, landed nosewheel-first again, and bounced another 20 feet up. After a third bounce I realized what was happening and, near the top of the bounce, applied full power with the intention of going around. I then had a moment of terror: even at full power, I could not completely arrest the descent. The pilot-induced oscillation was so bad at that point that after the bounce the plane continued its trajectory slowly downward until the mains kissed the ground with the engine blazing. In an instant, I decided this was good enough, cut the power again, and focused on keeping the plane on the runway centerline as I bled off airspeed for the next 4,000 feet. I’ve flown that Cardinal for about 850 hours total now, and that landing in Albuquerque remains, by far, my worst.

Dad and I found a hotel. I had dinner with a depressed cloud over my head and fell asleep immediately afterwards, totally exhausted. During the night I had a vivid nightmare about crashing a plane into the side of a mountain and woke up the next morning with a deep sense of dread, regretting having taken the trip and wishing it were over.

**Hour 359**

The next day I resolved to solve the problems from the day before. Specifically:

* We'd leave as early as possible, while the air was cool

* We'd plan a short segment so that we'd be able to take off without full fuel, lightening the load.

Between the cooler air temperature (i.e., thicker air) and less fuel (i.e., lighter plane), the climb should be much easier. Of course, Dad was fine with waking up early, because he was still on East coast time and didn't want a repeat performance of Winslow any more than I did. We picked Dodge City, Kansas as our destination. My pilot friend Morten, who was also based at Santa Monica, had coincidentally been there the day before on his way back from OshKosh. He'd called to tell me it was a nice place to stop, and I also wanted to be able to say it was ""time to get out of Dodge."" Even the FAA has a sense of humor: the instrument approach has an EARPP intersection.

We were at the airport by 7am, where I put only 10 more gallons of fuel in the plane. By my computations, we'd still have fuel to make it to Dodge with 90 minutes or even 2 hours to spare.

I filed our IFR flight plan and by 7:40 we were holding in position at the end of ABQ's wonderfully long, 13,000 foot runway. I throttled up to full power and held the plane on the runway for as long as I possibly could -- we accelerated past Vr, Vr+5, Vr+10, Vr+15... by Vr+20 the plane was begging to be let into the air. I released the forward pressure I'd been holding on the yoke and we leapt up into the piercingly blue, crystal-clear sky. We climbed at 700 feet per minute! That's almost ten times faster than our climb out of Winslow. In fact, it's not unreasonable performance even for a sea level takeoff, home in Santa Monica!

My mood instantly changed. *Ha, ha-- now I'm getting the hang of this!*

Our trip over the remainder of the Rockies was wonderfully uneventful. The early morning air was completely smooth; we sailed over the mountains at 11,000 feet as if we were being carried along on a cloud. I was in fine spirits, happy about the trip again, and really enjoying looking down at the fantastic scenery. In two hours time, the Rockies gave way to Kansas and the Great Plains. Minute by minute we could see the terrain dropping lower and lower under us. Before we knew it, it was time to land in Dodge City, after penetrating a tiny layer of scattered clouds. I brought us in for a nice landing, which was quite a relief after my terrible performance in Albuquerque.

We taxied to the parking area, and I shut the plane down. But, oops, one more minor task--we had to cancel our IFR flight plan. In other words, we had tell Air Traffic Control that we were safely on the ground. If you don't do this, they send out a search and rescue party. I powered up the avionics, and on my #1 radio, started to announce, ""Kansas City Center, Cardinal 1234H is on the ground in Dodge City, canceling IFR..."" until there was a fizz and a pop and I realized my radio was completely dark.

Wait. What? No radio? Please tell me this isn't happening.

I turned everything off and back on again, hoping in vain that I'd flipped some switch the wrong way, but the sound of the ""fizz.... pop"" was all too distinct in my memory. The #1 radio was dead. My good radio! Arrrgggh!

Dodge City may be a great place to go if you want to see a re-enacted gun fight, or get cheap fuel, but it's not a particularly good place to find someone who knows how to fix a KX-155. Now what?

Well, first things first: after contacting ATC using my other radio, we had some lunch. The fine folks at the Dodge City airport lent us the crew car. We had a nice Mexican meal in town, and stopped by the local auto parts store to buy a fuse and some screwdrivers. Back at the airport, I took my radio out of the panel and confirmed that the fuse was blown... but, replacing it just resulted in another blown fuse. Something was wrong. And the nearest avionics shop was 120 miles away in Wichita!

But how do we get to Wichita with clouds in the sky and only one working radio? And a marginally crappy radio, at that? Its front panel looked more like a 1940s gas pump than like a piece of avionics.

1350998966.0	11y0ps	I watched a plane crash the other day	brotein-shake	86	13	73	"It was the weirdest feeling.

I was at work at the airport, cutting the grass around some hangars while watching the planes take off and land. It was a Sunday, so it was relatively busy. I'll never forget this:

I watched it take off. I saw it was a Cessna with wheel farings, but I was too far away to be able to determine what model. (I later learned it was an old 152). We have a 3,500 foot runway. So the plane takes off, and I'd estimate between 150-250 feet AGL it stopped climbing. Over the noise of the mower I was driving I could not tell if the engine had failed or not. It kind of just leveled off. Then it disappeared beyond the trees. Of course, my initial thought was the worst case - it crashed. But then I got over that and thought *what are the odds that that would happen today?*. I let the thought go and went back to the cutting.

About 15 minutes later my phone started blowing up with calls, texts, and voicemails from my manager telling me to get to the office immediately. I call back and they told me there was an accident.

I couldn't really believe it. I said, ""Like, a car accident?""

""No, an airplane accident.""

""What happened?!"" I asked

""A 152 took off and crashed into the trees. We aren't really sure what happened yet.""

The rest of the day went about surprisingly normal. I had to cover the office while everyone went to see the wreck so I didn't get to personally see it, although I saw pictures after. The airport remained open and operated normally because the crash was not on our property, just a little bit after takeoff. 

So apparently, they took off and could not achieve sufficient climb power. Not sure exactly how that happened, but the instructor realized that there was no way they would clear the trees so he took the controls and successfully mushed it in. I say ""successfully"" on the fact that both of the pilots managed to escape the airplane, climb 30 feet down the tree, and leave with nothing but a scratch or two. The airplane was not as lucky. I saw pictures of it in the trees - all crunched up, completely destroyed. One wing was hanging off and it leaked up to 20 gallons of fuel. Amazingly though, no fire and no injuries. They said they went into the trees, shut the master off, called 911, climbed down the tree, and were on the ground by the time rescue personell arrived. They refused any medical treatment, and then a few hours later someone from their home airport flew in to pick them up and fly them back. 

**TL;DR:** 152 takes off and crashes in the trees - completely destroying the aircraft; both pilots walk away with just a few scratches.

**EDIT: PICTURES.** [In the tree.](http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/d6/0d6a2170-1d28-11e2-ab11-0019bb2963f4/5086ba8f91ebf.preview-300.jpg)

1342468591.0	wnsb2	PASSED MY CHECK RIDE! I'M A PPL AT LAST!	BIG_Python	78	7	19	"I just got home from the airport with what can be described as a huge sense of accomplishment.

I passed the oral part of the exam easily and only missed one question , how high do you have to be from open air assemblies of people? (2000 AGL and 3 mile radius away from.) I was able to look it up so it wasn't a big deal.

I then flew out of centennial, CO (KAPA) and we took off towards the south east in the direction of my 1st waypoint on my cross country flight plan.

I did a little hood flying with no problems, and easily recovered from the unusual attitudes. The examiner had me climb to 8500 MSL and when I was almost there he pulled back the throttle and simulated an engine failure.

I quickly went through my ABC`s of engine failure and recovered. I was then told to enter into a steep turn to the left which I did, and then performed one to the right with only losing about 50 ft of altitude. 

The examiner had me set up for slow flight, and I pulled the throttle back and put flaps to full once in the white arc. I then added enough throttle to keep the plane flying at around 45 knots.

It has always been a challenge for me keeping my altitude in slow flight, but this time I had no problem and even gained a little bit.

I transitioned into a power off stall and corrected quickly with full power and flaps 20. 

We then did turns around a point, an emergency descent, and lost procedures with some VOR`s. 

I got the ATIS for centennial and called up tower for some touch and gos. They told me to enter a left downwind for 17L and report midfield.

I descended to pattern altitude (6800) and reported the midfield and was cleared number 2 after a Cherokee for touch and go on 17R. 

The Cherokee was flying a really wide pattern so I had to extend the downwind a few miles. I pulled the throttle back and put flaps to 10 and then turned base. I put flaps to 20 and then turned final, and put full flaps.

I kept a little extra altitude on the approach and pitched the plane for 70KIAS. I flew the plane right above the runway and held it in ground effect and I held the left aileron into the wind (7 knt x-wind) and used the right rudder to keep me aligned.

I flared and the left wheel kissed the ground with a SWISH followed by the right and then finally the nose. It was one of the best landings I have ever had.

I then did a soft field touch and go, which was also pretty smooth. I called tower for a full-stop terminate, and the examiner told me to make the last landing a short-field landing. 

I had been working with my instructor for the last 6 flight hours on short field landing as it is, and always will be, my nemisis. There is just something really concerning to me about pointing the nose of the airplane at the dirt before the runway and then pulling up right before you turn the airplane into a lawn dart.

I made my descent and slipped the plane forward to lose a few hundred feet and I faced my enemy, the numbers of 17R. They were just mocking me, like they chewed up 172`s and high-wing flyers for breakfast.

I had to land within 200 ft of those numbers to pass, so I went against what every instinct in my body was telling me to do and I pointed the nose of the plane at the bushes 100 ft before the runway.

I pulled the nose up when I hit ground effect and pulled the throttle to idle, I was about to start the flare when I realized I wasn`t going to make the runway.

I goosed the throttle and pointed the nose at the chevrons on the threshold, I eased it out to idle again and started increasing the angle of attack. All I saw out the windscreen was blue Colorado sky and puffy white clouds. 

The wheels set down on the runway buttery smooth and I let out a huge sigh of relief followed by a realization of the magnitude of the sweat puddle I was sitting in. 

I taxid of the runway, called ground and taxid back to parking. After shutdown the examiner gave me a big smile and shook my hand, and I knew then that I had finally done it!

Finally today things clicked in my head and I found the groove.   

When we took off the wind was dead calm and I got several really nice landings and my confidence was up.   Then as the lesson progressed we picked up an ever so slight cross wind and after a couple touch and goes I got some really nice  Goldilocks landings (not too much slip, not too little slip, but just the right amount).  Even had one landing where I kind of had to ask myself if I had actually touched down as I was rolling down the runway.

**Part I: Apple Valley. Hour 116**

Flying is one of my passions, but it’s not my day job. In June of 2003, as I was finishing my primary flight training, I was also finishing my Ph.D. in computer science. This wasn’t a coincidence: I started learning to fly partly because I was going stir-crazy writing my dissertation. What better antidote than spending a few hours a week in the beautiful blue sky, a mile above the nearest computer screen?

My family was planning on flying out to LA from the East Coast for my graduation ceremony. I hadn’t told them that I was learning to fly yet; my mom’s a nervous flyer, and I didn’t think she’d approve. But I couldn’t keep the secret forever. Their visit seemed like the right opportunity to reveal it -- two graduations in one! I also knew my dad would be excited and want to fly with me. This gave me a hard deadline: I really wanted to get my private pilot ticket before their visit.

The weather gods would not make it easy for me. 2003 was one of the worst years for June Gloom in memory, and marine layers don’t mix well with primary training. Normally, the marine layer on the Southern California coastline extends inland just a few miles. By the second week of that June, the unprecedented Gloom was filling the entire LA basin. Every airport for miles was clouded over one day after the next.  My Night Cross-Country had been cancelled so many times that I went so far as to do it in Las Vegas (described in [Death Vortex](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/vroga/my_first_1000_death_vortex/)), leaving just one final hurdle: the checkride. But the unrelenting clouds caused my first three checkride appointments to be cancelled, too. With just a week left until graduation and my parents’ visit, I decided I had to take drastic action: return to the desert.

Apple Valley Airport is a sleepy little untowered field in a small town on the edge of the Mojave Desert. Apple Valley is best known to LA residents, if they know it at all, as a wrong turn on the way to Vegas. I studied weather data and concluded it was the nearest airport that hadn’t had a single overcast day in the past month. I arranged for a pilot examiner to meet me there one afternoon. He told me I'd have to show up early to get a renter’s flight test with an instructor at the FBO -- in the twisted rulebook of the FAA, you retroactively become the pilot-in-command on your own checkride if you pass it!

One gloomy Monday morning I set out for Apple Valley. It was a two hour drive. The clouds didn’t break until I’d driven into the rugged San Bernardino mountains and saw the desert on the other side. I found the airport and quickly learned my first lesson of the day: small-town FBOs are nothing like their big-city counterparts. In Santa Monica, my flight school looked like a dentist’s office. The one in Apple Valley was more like your crazy aunt's basement. A dozen metal shelves were filled with molding aviation magazines, filthy alternators and exhaust manifolds, military flight helmets, and boxes of oil; I couldn’t tell if it was a pilot shop or a badly curated museum. A cat was sleeping on the couch. The owner was a grizzled lady full of war stories told in between drags on her chain-smoked cigarettes.

The plane matched the school. The old Cessna 172’s center panel had nothing in it but a single comm radio and a transponder without an altitude encoder. I asked to see the maintenance logs and flipped through them, pretending I understood what I was reading and hoping to see something that would give me confidence.

“She ain’t that pretty, but she runs good,” the owner told me with a smile from under a purple haze. I was glad I'd only be flying the thing in the desert with plenty of options for an emergency landing.

An instructor took me up for two hours, putting me through a practice checkride: stalls, steep turns, slow flight, emergency procedures, and five takeoffs and landings. By then the afternoon sun was heating the desert floor; the cockpit was stifling and the sharp turbulence was exhausting.

Back on the ground, the pilot examiner had arrived. He grilled me on airspace, regulations, weight and balance computations, and emergency procedures. He wanted to see my cross-country flight plan and describe navigation procedures. It seemed to go on forever--

“What would you do if you lost your alternator?”

“What does this color line on the chart mean?” 

""When do you lean the fuel mixture?  What happens if you lean it too much?""

“Describe how you’d look at a weather briefing and decide if it’s safe to fly.”

“How much does a gallon of avgas weigh?”

“Do I have to wear a seatbelt while we’re taxiing?”

I longed to be back at my dissertation defense from the week before. At least there I was an expert!

Next he inspected my logbook. All seemed in order at first, but then --

“Why does his CFI number here not match the other CFI number in this entry?”

“One of the forms is missing.”

“This entry isn’t signed.”

Finally he brought the hammer down:

“Sorry, we can't fly today. Why don’t you fix these problems and come back Wednesday at 8am.""

I tried to hide my disappointment. Wednesday was the last day before
graduation.  That was cutting it close.  I tried not to brood on the two hour drive home.

Tuesday I filed my dissertation, officially becoming Dr. MyFirst1000, and fixed my FAA paperwork. Wednesday I woke up at 5am and started the trek back to Apple Valley. We were in the air by 8. The morning air was still crisp and smooth.

The checkride itself was surprisingly anti-climactic. We did all the same procedures I’d practiced many times over. My only moment of panic was when the instructor wanted to test my unusual attitude recovery under the hood -- and I realized my hood was in my apartment, a hundred miles away. I kicked myself for letting such a minor detail ruin such a meticulously constructed plan.

“It’s okay, we can improvise,” the examiner said. He reached into the
back, pulled out the bulky sun shield, and used it to cover just my
half of the windscreen.

As we entered the pattern for my last landing, I looked out at the landscape, trying to capture the moment. I noticed a dust devil far away, tearing its way across the empty desert floor. I smiled: I sure knew what that was after my encounter with one the week before!

“There’s a dust devil out there,"" I idly observed. ""I saw one of those last week.”

“So … you’re feeling pretty relaxed about the exam, huh?”

I made my last landing and parked. The examiner pulled a portable
printer out of his bag which clicked and whirred. Then he handed me a white piece of paper. It was a Temporary Airman Certificate with my name on it!

I couldn’t believe it -- I’d done it! *I was a pilot!*

**Part II: Gary Busey**

I said goodbye to the examiner, the FBO owner, and her cat, and started my journey home. The drive went quickly as I turned the recent events over in my head: I was now a PhD. I was now a pilot. What a week!

I tried to call my girlfriend; got her voicemail. Called another buddy of mine; he wasn’t in the office. I couldn’t tell my family; tomorrow was the big reveal. I had my most exciting news in a year and no one was around to hear. How frustrating!

Back in Santa Monica, just a few miles from home, I got caught in
horrible afternoon traffic -- and that’s when the exhaustion hit
me. I’d been driving and flying since 5am. Traffic inched forward one
car-length at a time and I struggled to keep my eyes open. I also
gradually became aware of a really foul odor of tobacco. I’d been in
the smoky flight school for 3 hours, I mused; some had stuck to my clothing.

“Don’t you just want to grab a shotgun and clear all these fuckers out?”

I turned. In the lane to my left was a long, shiny, brand new Cadillac. A man’s arm was sitting on the passenger-side window sill. He was holding a giant cigar. The smoke was wafting into my car. I turned, and there, sitting in the passenger seat, teeth gleaming, was Gary Fucking Busey. I felt delirious with exhaustion and wasn’t sure this was actually happening.

We started to chat. He told me I should watch his new show, I’m With Busey. I told him I would.

“So, how are you doing today, man?”

I blurted out first thing that came to mind: “I just got my private pilot license 3 hours ago!”

Great. I had dozens of friends and family who might like to hear this news, and the first person on earth to hear it is Gary Fucking Busey.

“Congrats, man! That’s fuckin’ great! I’ve got 8 hours in a 172. And my son Jake, he’s got a license too. Did you learn around here?”

“Yeah, right down at Santa Monica Airport,” I said.

“Justice Aviation!” he said excitedly. 

“That’s my flight school too!”

The light turned green and his car started to move. In parting, he stuck his arm out the window, pumping his fist with a giant thumbs up -- “Hey man, don’t fly your car! WHOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOoooooo!” 

That evening, I stopped by my flight school. The whiteboard said “CONGRATULATIONS MyFirst1000 -- Private Pilot!”

“You know, I had the strangest conversation on the way over here,” I told a group of instructors who were standing around. “I ran into Gary Busey.”

“Oh, hey, his son trained here!” one said.

“Yeah, I know,” I said, laughing. “He told me.”

So after about half an hour of chucking hot water on the plane and moving it in the sun I submitted the plan and we got going. Took off 35R at YMMB, and headed to Doncaster shopping town which I almost flew over until I realised it was overhead and I quickly turnt around and made my inbound call to essendon (YMEN). Made a straight in approach runway 26. We taxied to runway 17 and took off heading to west gate bridge then avalon VOR in class E airspace. We left avalon and headed for Skipton but he asked me to divert to Colac which I did no problem. After a precautionary search and landing at Colac (YOLA) we left and did a lost procedure and ended up just south of avalon. From then we left, headed back to carrum and to moorabbin.

Hope to be able to fly in some very mild IMC tomorrow!

**Flight portion:**

Departed IFR from KVNY to KCMA, GPS Y rwy 26 approach.  Missed approach from there, vectors to ILS 25 KOXR.  Landed, taxi back, departed VFR for unusual attitude recoveries.  7nm DME off of the 210 radial from FIM (GPS used for DME), then direct entry hold on R200 FIM.  VOR-A back into KVNY.  Total Hobbs time was 2 hours, about 20 minutes of which was flying in circles trying to get a word in edgewide with SoCal approach coming back in VFR.  Almost would have been better to go back to Pt Mugu's airspace and file IFR!

**Oral portion questions of note**

* LOTS of questions on aircraft systems:  How is each primary flight system powered (specific to the aircraft), what happens when static is blocked, 
* Icing questions: Anti-ice vs de-ice, what do we have, icing temperature ranges, what is the most common type (rime), what to do if encountered on various points on the cross country.
* Identifying failures (vacuum, alternator, DC), what fails and what do you do
* Nav systems, difference between T L and H VORs, reception range on T and L (not specific altitudes on high VORs)
* How does a VOR work, identifying a DME vs a VOR, frequency range for VORs
* GPS questions (components, RAIM, WAAS), alternate airports when using GPS, can you overlay GPS for a VOR approach 
* Couple of questions on IFR currency 
* Talked about my XC, I explained why I chose the route I did and the possible alternative routes.  He liked my explanation and didn't ask much about it. Questions on lost comms on various stages of the flight.
* Go/no go decision, what info based on briefing from the night before and what info would I use now? (pireps, *mets, etc)
* Only a few questions on low altitude map and IAP symbology
* Questions on reading METARs, TAFs, prog charts, surface charts
* If 60nm from a VOR, how many nm is 1 degree laterally? (A: 1nm)
* If on VNY CANOG1 and you can't get in touch with SoCal (due to busy frequency, not lost comms) do you intercept the LAX radial to IPIHO?  No you don't, since it's not technically lost comms, however I pointed out that the phrasing ""if not in contact with socal..."" is a bit ambiguous.
* If an altimeter is reading 80ft off, can you still fly?  I said no, turns out the within 75ft requirement is not in the FAR but in the AIM, so it's not regulatory, so you can just adjust it.  However still a good idea to fix it.
* Localizer back course, when it is reverse sensing?

Hope the notes help someone!  If anyone is at VNY or the area, I highly recommend Greg as a DPE.  Fair and thorough."	t5_2qm1t	True

Well, rewind to about 4 hours ago. My CFI and I went over what to do, what to say for an hour or so before we took our flight. I understood all the information ATC was spitting at me and was able to do it fine enough. What I had an incredible amount of trouble with was repeating the instructions back to them. I felt like a mumbling idiot. Rarely got anything right. Thankfully the controller was patient with me.

Any tips for getting this down?

1371003256.0	1g62hk	I passed my private pilot checkride!	czechgal	65	9	36	"June 11th, 2013 - The day I passed my private pilot practical test! Best day of my life? Pretty close.

I thought other people's descriptions of their checkrides were very helpful when I was preparing. So for anyone else preparing for the practical test, I'll give as many details as I can remember. 

First, I'll give a bit of background. I started flying lessons when I was 18, and my parents were paying for my lessons, I had accumulated 50 hours and I was ready for my checkride! The day before I was scheduled for my checkride, I came down with a cold and determined (using the IMSAFE checklist) that I should not fly the next day. This was very unfortunate timing, because I was about to take a summer course pretty far away, so I would not be able to test any time soon. After the summer class ended, I became responsible for my own finances, and immediately lost the ability to pay for lessons. I went 1 full year without flying, but I was working and saving everything! I started flying again on 05/03/13, and flew for ten hours in one month (my instructor was so helpful, always giving me priority when it came to renting the plane and getting instruction.), and I was ready for checkride attempt #2! That brings us to today.

I was lucky to be able to take my checkride at my home airport (class E airspace and virtually no traffic), so I was familiar with the area (a huge help).

The whole practical lasted from 800-1245.

We began by going over my IACRA and logbook, making sure everything was in order. 

Then he began asking questions about the FAA special emphasis areas, spending a good 15 minutes on ADM and CFIT. (What is ADM? Asking questions leading to IMSAFE, PAVE, and CARE. What is CFIT? What are some of the reasons that this happens? How can you prevent this from happening?)

He asked about what private pilot privileges and limitations were, and gave me a few scenarios. (He offers to pay for the aircraft rental when we fly somewhere together, can I accept his offer?) 

We went over the maintenance logbooks, and I had to show him the Annual, 100 hour, transponder, and ELT inspections (no Pitot-static/VOR inspections on the plane, because no IFR).

Then we moved on to my flight plan, starting with weather. My examiner was really cool about this. He just wanted to see what resources I use (aviationweather.gov, 1-800-WX-BRIEF) and made sure that I was going to make safe decisions about whether to fly or not. He didn't ask me how long things were valid for, but he did want to know how often METARs and TAFs were issued. After weather, we went over my weight and balance calculations, and my takeoff and landing distances.

We spent a lot of time talking about when the airplane is considered airworthy, what documents are required in it, and mostly what instruments we can fly with, and what to do if some equipment does not function (FAR 91.205, MEL, no MEL - 91.213(d), deactivate and placard INOPERATIVE). 

We went through typical airspace questions. (pointing and asking, starting from the surface and going up, what airspace are you in? What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled airspace as far as class G and class E airspace goes? What are the entry requirements? Weather minimums?)

Then we went over aeromedical factors. He asked for causes, symptoms, effects, and corrective actions for hyperventilation, spacial disorientation, and stress and fatigue. He asked me about the effects of alcohol and drugs (over the counter drugs too). He asked about flying after SCUBA diving (wait 12 hours if under 8000ft and no decompression stop. Otherwise, 24 hours, even if the cabin is pressurized).

Then he asked me about airplane systems. Tell me about the fuel system (what fuel, where tanks are, how they work). Which instruments run on the pitot-static system? Which instruments are gyroscopic? Which instruments use electricity (turn coordinator)? How does the vacuum system work? He asked me a few questions about the powerplant (Why do the spark plugs still ignite if we lose alternator &amp; battery power? Why do we have 2 magnetos?).

The oral continued as I did my preflight inspection (ie. what are the counterweights in the ailerons for?), and while we were in the air. We went through every maneuver in the PTS and besides one steep turn with not quite 45º of bank, I did everything to the standards. I'm a little proud of this because we had a fair amount of wind (13kts gusting to 25kts, which is a lot in a C152!)

**Hour 27**

I drove to the airport with my neck craned upwards. There was a low overcast. Before I’d started learning to fly, this only meant my bike ride to campus would be cooler. Now, it meant something else: I was in for a day of ground school.

I was getting close to my first solo flight, so Gary decided to drill me on emergency procedures.

“Let’s say you’re on the ground, trying to start the engine, and the engine catches on fire. What do you do?”

I knew this one! I’d always been a bookworm and had read most of the Cessna 172’s Pilot’s Operating Handbook over the past few weeks.  This exact scenario had been in the chapter on emergency procedures.  I proudly showed off I’d [done my homework](http://imgur.com/3z20F):

“You continue cranking the engine, so if it starts it sucks in all the flames and puts the fire out,” I confidently recited from memory.

Gary looked at me.

“Are you insane?”

I was crushed. I hated letting him down.

“Really? I could have sworn-- let me find the page, I thought it said--”

“I know what it says. But here’s what I say. I’m in a metal tube surrounded by 40 gallons of gasoline, and it catches on fire … do you know what my procedure is?  *I get out of the fucking plane.* I am not going to sit in there like an idiot watching the propeller crank while I’m strapped into a plane that is on fire. My plan is to get as far away as possible and maybe, after I’ve done that, try to find a fire extinguisher.”

It seemed so reasonable when he put it that way.

“Here’s another one. Let’s say your engine has failed and you’re gliding in for a landing, and right before you reach the ground you realize you’re going right in between two trees. What do you do?”

“Maybe pull up, try to balloon over them and then come back down?”

“No. You go through. Maybe the trees will rip the wings off and it’ll slow you down.  Maybe if the wings get left behind there will be less fuel at your crash site to catch on fire.”

That was definitely not anywhere in the manual.

“Listen, here’s my point. If you’re in an airplane someday and something goes wrong, I want the first thought through your head to be ‘This plane now belongs to the insurance company.’  It’s just a piece of metal and it can be replaced. You do whatever you need to do to make sure everyone in the plane walks away. Don’t you dare ever try to save the plane. It belongs to the insurance company. What do you care what happens to their plane? Just save yourself and your passengers.”

That conversation sticks out in my memory more than any other I had with Gary during the year he was my instructor. I bought my own plane a few months later, and in the nine years I’ve now owned it, I’ve never given it a name. I always refer to the plane as “it;” never “she.” I do this because of what he told me on that cloudy day. I resist gaining any emotional attachment to my metal box.  It’s just a machine; in a tight spot, it isn’t even my machine. Some insurance company owns it.

It would be a few hundred hours before I’d be tested on if I’d really taken Gary’s advice to heart. Hour 355, to be exact.


**Hour 355 - Coast to Coast, Day 1**

In August of 2004 I embarked on the trip that most American pilots contemplate at some point: a trip from coast to coast -- the ultimate cross-country! My dad has always loved small planes and was excited to come with me.

My plan was to first cross the Rockies in Albuquerque, head east-northeast for Cleveland, then track parallel to Lake Erie to my final destination of upstate New York.  I spent a long time picking out exactly which airports to stop at on the way. In my fantasy trip, we’d take off from Long Beach and get fuel in Winslow, AZ; head east until the Rockies ended, then east-northeast and spend the night in Liberal, KS; stop for fuel on the 2nd day in Quincy, IL; spend the second night in Youngstown, PA; and finally reach Ticonderoga, NY on the third day. I spent hours selecting those airports with a huge map of the U.S. on my floor, putting together flight plans for every one, and even picking Victor airways in between.

What a waste of time. Don't bother remembering any of those cities because we didn't stop in any of them after Winslow.

The night before the trip I packed all my bags and weighed everything. My big suitcase for 2 weeks away, a survival kit and 8 gallons of emergency water, my laptop, a heavy box full of charts and approach plates, and all the other random odds and ends added up to nearly 100 pounds. With my dad and his small bag the plane was still 150 pounds below its maximum gross weight -- plenty of leeway.  Or so I thought.

The morning of the trip was hot. The temperature was in the 90s on the ground. I’d planned our first leg, from Long Beach to Winslow, at 11,000’ feet; those last few thousand feet, the plane was climbing just a couple hundred feet per minute.

Heading east we tracked directly over Interstate I-40. Looking down and seeing it was emotional. In 1998, my good friend Ben and I both relocated from the East Coast to the West at the same time, so we took an epic cross-country road trip together, driving nearly the full length of I-40 together until we got to L.A. I would never have believed that in a few short years, I'd be on an epic cross-country trip back East, 2 miles above that same spot, in my own airplane!

We passed over the [Colorado River](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40700035/photos/colorado.jpg), easily visible as a thin strip of lush, green land looking very out of place in an otherwise arid desert. We saw a [race track](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40700035/photos/ford.jpg) in the middle of nowhere.  According to the Phoenix sectional, it was the ""Ford Motor Proving Ground"" -- perhaps a place to secretly test new cars, away from the prying eyes of competitors?  Another few hundred miles put us over [Sedona](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40700035/photos/sedona.jpg), where the scenery changed from flat and colorless to breathtaking. Ben and I stopped in Sedona to go swimming during our 1998 road trip, but I don't think I ever fully appreciated how beautiful it was until I saw it from above.

I didn't have much time to admire the scenery, though, as I was concerned about our landing in Winslow. I'd been watching the weather there daily and the wind seemed to really kick up every day at around 1:30PM. The time now was almost exactly 1:30. Also, Winslow airport sits almost 5,000 feet above sea level. Since the temperature was 90 degrees, the ""density altitude""---or, equivalent field elevation at a standard temperature---was reported at an alarming 8,100 feet! With such thin air, the performance of the engine is lousy since it is starved for air. Also, the plane is going much faster along the ground when it lands, since there's so little air to keep it aloft just before it stops flying.

Luckily, we got there just in the nick of time; the wind was completely calm. We lined up for one of Winslow's 7,000 foot runways and started our descent. The landing was stressful, but a ""greaser"" -- one of those landings where you're not sure that the wheels are even on the ground. (I was not able to repeat this flawless performance for the remainder of the trip.) As expected, the plane kept on rolling and rolling for a few thousand feet before finally coming to a stop. Just before touchdown, the GPS was indicating our groundspeed at about 100 knots, or 115 MPH. We taxied back to the self-serve fuel pumps and refilled our half-empty tanks.

1340927398.0	vroga	My First 1000: Death Vortex	MyFirst1000	88	32	15	"*In celebration of reaching 1,000 hours logged, I pulled out my old logbooks and created a novelty account to tell some of my more interesting flying stories.  I'll keep posting as long as there's interest.*


I did my primary training in Santa Monica, California: famous for its fishing pier and 3rd Street Promenade, its indigenous populations of movie stars and the homeless living side by side, and -- unfortunately for aspiring pilots -- its June Gloom.  Every year before summer gets into full swing, a cloud deck settles in every evening and doesn't budge until the following day's afternoon sun burns it off.  Technically called a ""marine layer,"" it extends inland about 1,000 feet off the ground, making visual-flight-rules flight impossible in a land full of skyscrapers, terrain and complex airspace.

In June of 2003 I was still training for my private pilot's license.  The last hurdle was the Night Cross-Country -- a 100-nautical-mile flight performed at night.  I'd scheduled such a flight with my instructor four times in two weeks, only to have the persistent June Gloom scrub each of them in turn.  

One gloomy June weekend I was scheduled to be in Las Vegas for a friend's 48-hour bachelor party.  As I was packing, a clever thought occurred to me: could I finally satisfy my last training requirement in Vegas?  It's hundreds of miles from water, safely away from the infuriating June Gloom.  All I'd have to do, I reasoned, was find a flight school, schedule a lesson, sneak out of the party for a few hours, and come back triumphantly, ready for my checkride.  Brilliant!

I found a flight school based at North Las Vegas airport and gave them a call.  ""Sure, we'd be happy to give you a lesson,"" they said. ""Just make a flight plan and we'll have an instructor meet you there.""  I planned a quick jaunt from VGT up to Mesquite (67L), a tiny untowered airport in the middle of the high desert about 75 miles away.

I arrived at the airport to find a 22-year-old kid wearing a colorful bandana and a lot of rings.

""Uh, are you the instructor?""

""Yeah, man!  You here for the night cross country?""

I realized I'd been spoiled back home.  My primary instructor was on old guy: wise, unflappable, willing to let me learn by making mistakes without ever actually putting myself in danger.  This guy looked like a stoner, but I was determined to press on.

We took off and steered our 172 through the Vegas Class B airspace, then followed I-15 up towards Mesquite.  Once we were away from the city, it was utterly black outside: a high overcast blocked out the moon, and there were no lights on the ground.  I clutched the sectional chart with a white-knuckle grip, knowing the high mountains were out there but that I couldn't see them.  What other unfamiliar dangers might be lurking in this strange land?

""So you're, uh, familiar with this area, right?  Have you been instructing here a long time?""

""No man,"" my right-seat companion told me, to my disappointment.  ""I just moved here a couple months ago.  It's cool though, we're doin' fine.""

We made superficial small talk which did little to calm my nerves.  Finally, we approached Mesquite and began a descent.  It turned out to be easy to spot the airport; there was a casino next door with a piercing billion-candlepower searchlight beckoning all comers.  The light was on final and I was afraid of being blinded by it, so I kept my pattern really tight.  Far too tight, as it turned out: the short final leg plus the nighttime flying illusions caused me to badly misjudge the distance to the runway.  I was also afraid of the ground due to the total darkness and high terrain.  As a result, I kept coming in far too high and having to go around.  My anxiety level continued to climb.

Finally, on my fourth lap around the pattern, trying to put my fears of this alien landscape aside, I managed to fly a stabilized approach and landed with a squeak. As we taxied back to take off again, I noticed the midfield windsock was limp; the evening was totally calm and the deserted airport was dark and silent.

Holding short of the approach end, we programmed the radios and GPS for the return flight.  Before taking the runway, I glanced back at the windsock a half-mile away.  It was now indicating about a 10 knot tailwind.

""It looks like the wind just came up a bit, blowing the wrong way"" I told the instructor.  ""Should we taxi to the other end?""

""You sure man?  Looks right to me.""

I looked at the windsock again.  It was now pointing *towards* us, indicating a headwind.  Was I insane!?  I could have sworn there was a tailwind a moment ago.  

""Wait, a second ago, it was..."" -- I trailed off.  The windsock was now slowly but continuously moving *in a circle*.  What the hell!?  I watched it, mouth open, still mid-sentence.  

""It's going around in a circ-- I mean, do you see --""

Suddenly gravel and dust started swirling around us.  And, as if an invisible hand had flipped a switch, the plane abruptly and violently started to shake.  With a great clatter, as a hundred metal garbage cans being beaten with hammers, the plane was rattling and heaving around us.  Losing his cool for the first time the instructor shouted -- barely audible over the racket -- **""DEATH VORTEX!""**

DEATH VORTEX!?  Did I hear that right?  Now in abject terror, afraid for my life, my first thought was nevertheless ""what the fuck is a freaking *death vortex* and why the hell wasn't I informed this was a possibility!!??  Why would anyone fly here?!  This is the dumbest idea I've ever had!""

The yoke whipped to and fro, hitting me in the stomach. I stood on the brakes but the plane kept being pushed forward, inch by inch, crossing the hold-short line despite my desperate pleas with friction.  We pitched so far up and down that I feared the prop would strike the ground; in a panic, I quickly hit the master switch and pulled the mixture to stop the engine.

And suddenly it was over.

The wind stopped at the same moment the engine stopped.  In a surreal instant, the cacophony of heaving metal and engine noise was replaced by almost total silence, save for the distant-sounding whine of the gyroscopes slowly spinning down.  We sat quietly, saying nothing, listening to their gentle whir.

Finally, after a long moment, I broke the silence.

""I'm going to get out of the plane.""

""Yeah, man.""

We left the plane sitting where it was and walked to the edge of the taxiway.  It was on a bluff overlooking the casino.  We sat, we talked, we bonded as two men after a trauma do.  For two hours we chatted about life, our fears, our aspirations, and why we fly at all.  What we'd actually experienced was a ""dust devil"" -- a miniature tornado common in the desert during the summer.  We contemplated what might have happened if it had come along a few minutes earlier, when we were on final, or a few minutes later, just after takeoff.  Finally, we got back in the plane, wiser.

An hour later, we were back in Las Vegas.  The CFI filled out my logbook and we shook hands.  I never saw him again.  But, years later, I look back at that page and smile at the entry -- nothing but a little drawing of a tornado and a signature.

My original post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/lu396/how_many_hours_before_your_first_solo/

I'm on my 4th instructor, it took just two weeks under 2 years.  I had flights scheduled for once a week for those two years, but only got up to 40 hours.  Mainly because of ""life getting in the way"", bad weather would turn missing one week into missing 2 weeks.  etc...

The bright side of completing my solo now is that I already have a lot of cross country/radio/navigation experience and now with this ""mental hurdle"" clear, I feel like things will pick up and by next year I could be licensed with around 65 hours.

Thanks Again!

 Mine was causing (although I like to pretend it was ATC's fault!) a Ryanair 737 to go around very, very low (minimums or lower) at Liverpool. This was before I got my PPL, and I needed another 5 minutes of solo time, so I went up for one circuit. Unfortunately, due to the traffic, I ended up being in the air for 45 minutes, flying [this](http://i.imgur.com/YeT6W.jpg) rather large circuit, following a PA28, being asked to orbit twice for long periods of time (pretty sure ATC forgot about me for quite a while) while a succession of Easyjet, KLM, Ryanair and FlyBe aircraft landed on runway 27. 

Finally there was a gap, which was open for about 2 minutes, during which time she (the ATCO) didn't talk to me at all - I reminded her that I was there with a quick ""Any chance of getting in?"", at which point she asked me to fly a left base. Flying the base I set up the a/c for landing and slowed to 70 kts; only turning final did she inform me that there was a 737 on the approach behind me that had just called up only 5 miles out. 

She tells the Ryanair crew to slow to minimum safe approach speed, and asks me to keep my speed up on the runway and vacate at [Echo](http://i.imgur.com/cDxTi.jpg) rather than our usual Foxtrot, which is further down the runway but is a high speed exit so I wouldn't have to slow as much. However, I had a bit of a brain fart and didn't actually land long, so I touched down near the TDZ and kept my speed up, desperately trying to vacate at E, but...

 ""Ryanair ____, sorry about this, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge"" - the irritation from the Ryanair guy's voice as he acknowledged was palpable!

 The sight was awesome, but I couldn't really appreciate it - needless to say, I switched pretty quickly onto the ground frequency and Tower's hand off was frosty, to say the least! When I got back into the flying school, my helpful chief FI was on hand to console me, telling me that ""We've got a Ryanair Captain on the phone, he wants your bank account details..."" 

 The annoying thing was that I was actually off the runway itself, but still technically on the active because it extends down the high speed taxiway. I believe that the FR crew were going to continue the landing, but ATC couldn't allow that to happen as she knew I was still technically on the runway. 

One of our veteran instructor's theories was that she forgot I was a solo student, and was probably kicking herself when I landed and she saw one person in the a/c. 

Anyway, I'm sure many of you have stories about causing go arounds but it doesn't feel good when you're some pathetic student pilot in a tiny washing machine getting in the way of two heroes in the flying metal tube! "	t5_2qm1t	True

I went flying after work with a student pilot friend of mine. He's in the left seat, I'm in the right. He starts up and taxi's out and proceeds with the run up. All checks out just fine. Call tower, I take off, and we go flying. 

As we're climbing out I notice my feet becoming extremely hot. I check to make sure the cabin heat is closed, and it is. I enjoy another 30 seconds of VFR window gazing, and at this point,  my feet feel as if they're literally on fire. It was excruciating heat and my shoes were seconds away from melting on the pedals.

My brain makes the connection within a matter of 2 seconds that my feet are hot because of the engine. I look at the EGT and it's pegged at maximum. 

At this point we're at 1900 feet and about 2 miles out.

We shut down and got out. I put my hand on the cowling and it's searing hot. 

I'm a decently-high time private pilot with most of my hours in tailwheel and aerobatic airplanes. I've had a handful of minor problems, but nothing of this kind of magnitude. It might not be a big deal to some other ATP guys here, but the first emergency is always a tough one, or so I've heard. Luckily, I feel as if I did the right thing at the right time! I'll figure out what the problem was on Monday, but me along with an A&amp;P friend of mine suspect it's some type of fuel delivery problem. Maybe some mechanically inclined pilots here could throw their 2 cents in."	t5_2qm1t	True

------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;One day in the summer of 1983, on an overcast afternoon, a small flock of planespotters and photographers milled around their usual spot on the access road beneath the approach to a regional airport in West Texas. One spotter had a radio set tuned to the airport's ATC frequency perched on the hood of his car. The ATCs could be heard through frequent static calmly directing the airport's usual traffic, mostly GA craft, with a smattering of smaller scheduled airliners. As the rain clouds grew darker the spotters cursed their luck, soon the visibility would be too low for most of the VFR GA traffic, and the backdrop too dark and somber to photograph the airliners and IFR traffic that would carry on with any degree of attractiveness. As they began to head for their cars, the radio set crackled and a new voice was heard. A static filled transmission announced ""...tower this is Boeing NCA71 *static* single engine *static* approach... this storm really gave me a beating..."" The tower responded immediately: ""Boeing NCA71... say type and bearing."" The garbled pilot attempted to reply: ""I'm about six miles out, type is..."" then the radio fell silent. ""Boeing NCA71, say again."" The ATC demanded. Nothing. The ATC called again: ""Boeing NCA71, confirm you are on one engine and in distress, squawk 5688."" The tower watched the transponder code for the Boeing flip to 5688. ""Boeing NCA71, make straight in, runway 17, cleared to land. Emergency medical and fire will be standing by."" The spotters hurriedly prepped their cameras, expecting a wounded 737 or some other massive Boeing marvel to soar over them and make a heroic landing on a short, barely adequate field. A tense, electric calm filled the air as they waited for a jetliner to emerge from the clouds. They craned their necks and monitored the approach. Soon the distinct noise of an engine was heard. The spotters sighed, the ATC grumbled, and a battered Boeing Stearman biplane sputtered into view.    "	t5_2qm1t	True

1366006662.0	1cdisr	My First 'Emergency'	godlyjack	55	5	29	"I saw a post like this earlier in the week and am so inspired to post my first incident in the air.

I got my PPL in early February but have barely been up due to the crazy March winds we had in the DC area. Yesterday I went up on my 2nd XC trip as licensed pilot in command with a friend of mine. There was an airmet for modereate turbulence, the flight was a bit bumpy but nothing too bad I thought. Probably 30 miles out from the (destination) airport my friend said ""I feel weird..."" which I took as 'I'm gonna hurl' so he pulled out the airsick bags I gave him before takeoff. He took it out of the little sleeve and was trying to open it (if you havn't dealt with them, think of opening a new trash bag where it's folded up and sticking together.) He then started rubbing his thumb along his fingers and told me and told me he couldn't move or feel his fingers. I  looked over and saw they were completely stiff. The first two thoughts that I had were hypoxia or carbon monoxide. I checked my finger tips to see if they were blue, rubbed my fingers together, flexed my hand and all my fingers knowing it would be extra bad if I was having problems too. I wasn't, everything was fine. We weren't anywhere high enough for it to be hypoxia anyways, and the carbon monoxide indicator was indicating the air was fine. I didn't know what was going on so I added a few hundred rpm to get us on the ground just a little bit quicker. I tried reassuring him ""We're 20 miles out, going 100 knots, we'll be on the ground in just 10 minutes!"" Over the next few minutes it spread up his arms and his breathing became labored. It kept getting worse, his legs started shaking, his breathing got heavier, and this paralysis seemed to have taken over his whole upper body. I really became concerned, having no idea what was happening to him. He started sort of rocking back and forth and just appeared to be in a lot of pain. I was on VFR flight following, as I do with all my cross countries, and decided to ask Potomac departure to arrange an ambulance to meet us at the airport. They asked 'What is the nature of your emergency?' I told them I had a passenger who had numbness in his hands and was having trouble breathing. Potomac was amazing and got the ambulance for us. Over the next ten minutes I kept reassuring him - we'll be on the ground in just a few minutes, there's an ambulance waiting for us! When I had the field in sight I called Potomac, informing them we were changing frequency and thanked them for all the help - as always. Then I made the call I'd rehearsed a million times in my head, but never imagined myself saying so soon: ""_____ traffic, Cessna _______ inbound straight in runway 27, medical emergency, ______ traffic""

Touched down and quickly taxied over to the ramp where the ambulance was waiting, shut down and was met by the paramedics, and quickly got my friend into the ambulance.

As they took his vitals in the ambulance, I chatted with some of the local pilots, including some instructors and the owner of the flight school there, they were all surprised to hear I was a freshly minted private pilot, they all had thought I was the instructor. And they were all very impressed with how I handled the situation, kept telling me how great I did, saying they knew a lot of PP's who would have panicked.

While it sucks that my friend didn't have a good flight (he was really enjoying the view until he started to feel 'weird'), I am very happy with how I handled it. I kept calm, focused on flying the plane and getting him down. Had the foresight to call ahead for an ambulance to meet us, and kept reassuring my precious cargo. I'm sure people have far more interesting stories than this; but for me, this was my real first pilot in command decision making, and I'm so proud of myself for the way I kept control of the situation. 

Fortunately my friend is perfectly okay. As he sat in the ambulance the tension in his upper body went away, they took his vitals several times and they were great, he had no history of heart issues or anything. In fact he jumped out of the ambulance afterward with a big smile and was ready to go back up again - which no one else thought was a good idea, haha. My non-medical opposite of expert opinion is that maybe it was just an anxiety attack. When I did small roller coasters when I was younger I would always tense up to the point of completely locking my body and not breathing as soon as the drop came, and that even happened to me early in my flight training. It was his first time in a small plane and there was a bit of up and down turbulence. My crappy flying probably didn't help any :D But in any event the important thing was that he's fine and can't wait to go flying again. How we got home is an entirely different story that unfolded over the next 8 hours....

If you stuck around to read the whole thing, thank you! I apologize for the wall of text. I'm curious what others would have done in that situation: Would you have called ATC and told them of a medical emergency? While it turned out he was medically sound, in the air I had no idea what could have been going on and feel I made the best decisions I could given what I was seeing."	t5_2qm1t	True

1357087054.0	15spji	Lost visibility out the windshield on takeoff - new checklist item created!	slipnglide	57	7	19	"It's cold out here today for Seattle - 28° F when I woke up and not much warmer a few hours later. The first plane I'd checked out was down (fuel gauge inop) so I went for another, which hadn't been flown since November 26th. It's an older 150 without shoulder straps and sometimes its low idle on the ground is lumpy, but it's a good plane.

The hoarfrost on all of the planes was ridiculous: crystals bigger than skittles covered all of the upper surfaces, and every inch not in direct sunlight had some kind of frost (including the undersides). I turned the plane's back to the sun, brushed off the big crystals, and waited for every speck of ice to melt off.

An hour later it was time to go and sure enough the engine wasn't running great after sitting outside in the cold for &gt;5 weeks. At 1200-1300 rpm it was running rough (sounded like it mighta been missing), and when I selected the L mag it was worse. It had sat for a while though, so I decided to go give it a good diagnostic run up before giving up on flying for the day. Thankfully the run up went well (thrice) and it was time to go.

I taxied onto the big runway and pushed the throttle full forward. Instantly, a huge opaque spot covered the windshield in front of me and started to spread! I waited a heartbeat for it to go away before my ""nopenopenope"" alarm went full blast, and I throttled back and told the tower I'd need to abort (they'd given me clearance with a King Air on 3 mi final). I pointed the air vents from the wing at the windshield and looked around its sides as I slowed down and found a taxiway to exit.

By the time I was stopped and talking to ground, the splotch had disappeared. Everything with the plane seemed nominal, and the gauges were looking good. In the first moments I'd suspected it was the engine throwing oil, but realized it would be hard for it to come through the intact cowl. While taxiing I'd watched it fade, almost like condensation - but how? 

Looking around, I saw a slit on the top of the dash, and a glance down showed the cabin heat was fully open. The engine was warm enough that when I gave it full throttle, it dumped warm air onto the cold windshield which instantly formed a thick layer of fog. Whew! After closing that (and taxiing back and waiting for a wake turbulence delay) the take off and subsequent 2 hour flight was pleasantly uneventful.

**tl;dr** - New checklist item for winter takeoffs: make sure cabin heat or anything else putting warm air onto the windshield is off (unless you've warmed up the whole thing)."	t5_2qm1t	True

I'll keep posting as long as there's interest.  You can read the whole series [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/MyFirst1000/submitted/).*

This story is a little different from the others I've posted so far. It's not really a story about *flying* per se, but about airplanes: the story of how I bought mine.

Also, I'd like to thank everyone who has sent me positive feedback on this story series for the past few months.  I've decided to go ahead and write a book. At first I was afraid these stories wouldn't be interesting; then, that I might not have enough material. First, the material: I sat down and made a list of about 40 more chapters yet to tell.  Based on the average length so far, that would make it about 65,000 words, which is on the short side, but not bad for a memoir.

But more importantly, I've really enjoyed writing all these stories down.  I've been remembering details of old flights by going through my logbooks, finding notes I took, and re-reading years of archived emails I wrote years ago, exchanged with pilots right after some of these incidents happened.  It's been great fun, and even if no one reads the book, it will have been fun to write.  So thank you, reddit, for pushing me to embark on such a project.

After shaking hands I was briskly escorted through the FBO corridor into a dimly lit conference room with well worn chairs, ""I (definitely) wasn't the first one here"", I thought.  
    
""They didn't turn the light on for us"", he explained.  ""It'll warm up"", with immediate confidence, he continued.  ""I see you found the coffee"", referring to my large Hazelnut.
I knew I should have offered...but I figured this was business.  

Moving on.  Logbook, was I qualified, IACRA, test results.  Introduction, a preview of the expectations of me 
and the role of him.  A review of the PTS expectations, a bathroom break and we we're off. 

""The oral exam starts now."", my brain jolts to life.  I hadn't been a tad nervous until then, that brisk 
flutter that'll get ya, but you can get back.  We dove right into the maintenance logs...2:30 later, an exuberant, ""You passed"".  It felt like the second time I flew, mentally exhausted.  

I barely cracked a smile with those words, yet a couple hours later I now feel grand.

I didn't fly today, low lapse rates and a low system developed overnight bringing in light snow.  Guess exactly what I woke up to?  Weather was one of my strong points, couldn't help myself :)  

Well, I'm sure you want to know what I was asked.  Here ya go!  I'll probably update more as I remember.  I'd be happy to answer any questions, just probably not until tomorrow.

You may remember me as the creator of /r/pilots over a year ago. I wanted to create a community centered around the art and joy of manned exploration of the air. After a little bit of ad spend and a lot of hustling the community quickly grew to over 500 pilots. Pics of weekend outings were shared, sage advice was passed down from veterans, people solo'd, the community shared in our collective love for the art. 

Then, sometime last summer, I changed jobs, which involved a much greater monopolization of my time and change in my family budget. This basically clipped my wings, I moved away from the airport and had to stop flying. It didn't seem like I'd be able to fly again for some time. This made /r/pilots a source of pain for me. I'm ashamed to say my grief caused me to abandon the great community at r/pilots.

Fast forward to July 2012 I've discovered a new little airport nearby which I've fallen in love with. I've readjusted my budget to fit in a monthly outing in the plane. I'm scheduling my BFR today and am reinvigorated. Last night I decided to swallow my shame and punched /r/pilots in the address bar. And wow, was I surprised at what I found.

I just wanted to say I'm sorry for disappearing and leaving /r/pilots unmoderated. More importantly I want to say thank you to everyone who is behind /r/flying. This is everything I wanted /r/pilots to be and more. I can't wait to contribute and be a part of the community.

I went back to my old plane today. Yesterday we tried to go up but the brakes were out so we did sim time.

Anyhow, I did three takeoff/landings with full stop and taxi back on 16L and my instructor radioed in that I'd be soloing in this plane. Back to the ramp to drop him off and off I went.

It was awesome! The little Diamond reached TPA well before crosswind, where it usually reaches it turning to downwind. Without someone else to talk to, I talked to myself and the tower only, and it all seemed unhurried and calm.

I was supposed to do three full stop landings with taxi-back. Tower had me on a normal final for the first, short for the second and a very long final for the third. 

It was a blast and all I want to do is go up again alone.

1345947722.0	yu2yi	As a pilot in the US, you are probably not familiar with these unusual general-aviation airplanes in Europe	airshowfan	51	5	14	"Recently, for a variety of reasons, I have learned about some really funky-looking general-aviation planes that have flown in Europe over the past few years. A friend of mine is an aviation photographer over there and he keeps posting pictures of airplanes I had never heard of, such as the [Bulldog](http://www.warbirdalley.com/bulldog.htm), [Robin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avions_Robin), [Piaggio 149](http://www.classic-jets.com/american/piaggio.php), [Tipsy Nipper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsy_Nipper), [Pilatus P3](http://www.aso.com/seller/11580/plane2.htm), [Sequoia Falco](http://www.pilotfriend.com/experimental/acft3/2.htm), etc. Trying to find out what the airplanes are in his pictures, I have run into websites that discuss some really interesting-looking planes. Some are one-off prototypes, some are intended for production. As a private pilot, I would be very curious as to what it's like to fly them. Some of the most intriguing ones so far:

- The [Verhees Delta](http://www.verheesengineering.com/gb/delta.html), a single-seater that looks like a cross between the Dyke Delta and the [Imperial Shuttle Tydirium](http://www.google.com/search?q=Imperial+Shuttle+Tydirium&amp;tbm=isch). The creator says that a kit will soon be available, but... Don't they all say that?

- The FlyNano, a single-seat box-wing seaplane. When I say box-wing, I mean a set of swept wings, and a set of forward-swept horizontal stabilizers that meet the wings at the wingtips. You occasionally see concepts of airliners or cargo freighters using this configuration but I don't think I had ever actually seen a manned airplane with wings like that. And while [the CGI imagery on the terrible website](http://flynano.com/) makes it look like something that will never actually fly... It does fly! [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BZxOmQppw4#t=10s), [pictures](http://flynano.com/galleria/maidenflight.html).

- The [LH-10 Ellipse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sn-YnmGNcU#t=110s) looks like a two-seat BD-5. Only the nosewheel retracts, though. Probably a blast to fly!

- The [Gyroflug SC-01](http://www.airteamimages.com/gyroflug-sc-01-speed-canard_D-ENWG_-private_130797.html) looks like an EZ, but [roomier](http://www.airteamimages.com/gyroflug-sc-01-speed-canard_D-ENWG_-private_130796.html), with a chubby egg-shaped fuselage that probably cuts a few knots from the cruise speed but should make for great visibility and comfort, I would guess.

- If you mix the LH-10 with the SC-01, you get the [Aceair Aeriks 200]( http://www.aero-news.net/subscribe.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=1a97e4cc-03a3-467a-bf88-e75371403d70).  Looks very slick! And [high-tech, too](http://www.over-flyer.ch/aeriks200/aeriks-faq.htm).

- Then there's this thing, the mysterious [CC-02](http://www.airliners.net/photo/CC-02/2068777/&amp;sid=0603f91c3421039ee4faba3aa85be3c7). Can't find much info on it, just tons of pictures on two blog posts ([one](http://lfai.blogspot.com/2009/02/f-psck-chudzik-cc-02.html), [two](http://lfai.blogspot.com/2009/06/f-psck-chudzik-cc-02-part-2.html).) Apparently it has flown, but it doesn't exactly look like the most stable thing ever designed. But you gotta love the pointy nose, tandem seating in a bubble canopy, and the smooth sleek surface that makes it look like one big composite part.

- The [FanTrainer](http://www.airliners.net/photo/RFB-Fantrainer-400/1399557/&amp;sid=efddaabf9fee9a76409a5a4fcdb49404). Unlike the other airplanes on this list, this is an expensive hot-rod that has been considered for military training use, powered by a massive 650hp engine... that spins a ducted fan mounted in the fuselage just aft of the cockpit. Um, ok... It [sounds as funny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZsz260cI#t=39s) as you'd expect.

- On the opposite end of the performance spectrum is the [WoopyFly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6CvycZux0E), an inflatable hang-glider/trike. Apparently it can fold up into a size so compact, you can put it into the trunk of your car, i.e. even smaller and easier to transport than other trikes or ultralights (short of flying a paraglider with an engine strapped to your back). No, it does not appear to make farting noises. But this video of [some Japanese guys trying it out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYlZ2GGk8HI#t=15s) is kinda hilarious

- And finally: France’s answer to the Icon A5 is the equally drool-worthy [Lisa Akoya](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rt7WEfLJbY). Also a two-seat amphib, it has a couple little fins that stick down below it and act like hydrofoils, to make water landings smooth without needing the boat-shaped hull. Muck slicker-looking than the A5, in my opinion, and the cockpit looks even cooler. Ah, and it can carry little skis on the wheels (still retractable) and land in snow, for full tri-phibian action. More videos [here]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7PvOpk18Hg) and [here]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7PvOpk18Hg). Oh, and the wings fold up electrically! Fan-cee.

Of course, it's possible that none of these will ever be seen in the US, or even in any significant numbers in Europe... But I thought they're worth looking at, especially for people who might be getting bored with Cessnas, Pipers, etc.

If you're a tech nerd like I am, you should enjoy this read.	flyingflopdoodle	51	10	25	"Directly from my Gmail account:

Part 1
&gt;I just completed the first pilot training class on the 787 at United Airlines, an airplane which is destined to replace the 767 and live for many years after I retire. Here's what I've learned in 787 training so far. By the way, last night we passed our MV (maneuvers validation) check ride, with emergency after emergency, and the FAA observing. Tonight was our LOE (line-oriented evaluation), again with FAA - this time 2 FAA observers. It's 0200 and I just got back to the hotel and poured a well-earned glass of wine to celebrate. I now have a type rating in the 787. Phew. I'm pretty confident this will be the last one for me.
 


&gt;I've summarized some of the major differences and unique features of the 787 versus more traditional ""old school"" airplanes like the 777 (not kidding) - from the pilot's viewpoint. Our ""Differences"" course takes 11 days to gain an FAA type rating, which is a ""common"" type rating with the 777. The course has been like drinking from a fire hose, but has finally come together. Some of our pilots attended Boeing's 5-day differences course, and deemed it unacceptable. The FAA approved the Boeing 5-day course, but our guys decided it lacked too much information. FAA is observing our checkrides now, and taking our course as well, to certify the training. We're just the guinea pigs.
 


&gt;A computer nerd would describe the 787 as 17 computer servers packaged in a kevlar frame. The central brains is the Common Core System (CCS). Two Common Computing Resources (CCRs) coordinate the communications of all the computer systems, isolating faults and covering failed systems with working systems. When battery power is first applied to the airplane in the morning, it takes about 50 seconds for the L CCR to boot up. After this, a few displays light up and you can start the APU. If there is a major loss of cockpit displays, this may require a CCR reboot, which would take about a minute. Here are a few of the major features and differences from the 777.
 


&gt;Electrics - Though a smaller plane, the 787 has 4 times the electric generating power of the 777 - 1.4 gigawatts. Generators produce 235 VAC for the big power users. Other systems use the traditional 115 VAC and 28 VDC. There are 17 scattered Remote Power Distribution Units which power about 900 loads throughout the plane. The big power distribution system is in the aft belly, along with a Power Electronics Cooling System (PECS). This is a liquid cooling system for the large motor power distribution system. There's also an Integrated Cooling System (ICS), which provides refrigerated air for the galley carts and cabin air, and a Miscellaneous Equipment Cooling System for Inflight Entertainment Equipment.
 


&gt;If 3 of the 4 engine generators fail, the APU starts itself. The APU drives two generators, and can be operated up to the airplane's max altitude of 43,000 feet. If you lose all 4 engine generators, the RAT (ram air turbine) drops out (like a windmill), powering essential buses. (It also provides hydraulic power to flight controls if needed).
 


&gt;If you lose all 4 engine generators and the two APU generators (a really bad day), you are down to Standby Power. The RAT will drop out and provide power, but even if it fails, you still have the autopilot and captain's flight director and instruments, FMC, 2 IRSs, VHF radios, etc. If you're down to batteries only, with no RAT, you'd better get it on the ground, as battery time is limited. Brakes and antiskid are electric - 28V - so you don't lose brakes or antiskid even when you're down to just standby power.
 


&gt;Normal flight controls are hydraulic with a couple exceptions. Engine driven and electric hydraulic pumps operate at 5000 psi (versus normal 3000 psi) to allow for smaller tubing sizes and actuators, thus saving weight. If you lose all 3 hydraulic systems (another bad day), you still have two spoiler panels on each wing which are electrically powered all the time, as is the stabilizer trim. You can still fly the airplane (no flaps, though). If you're having an even worse day and you lose all hydraulics and all generators, flight control power is still coming from separate Permanent Magnet Generators (PMGs) which produce power even if both engines quit and are windmilling. If the PMGs fail, too, your flight controls will be powered by the 28 V standby bus.
 


&gt;If you lose all 3 pitot/static systems or air data computers, the airplane reverts to angle of attack speed (converts AOA to IAS), and this is displayed on the normal PFDs (primary flight displays) airspeed indicator tapes. GPS altitude is substituted for air data altitude and displayed on the PFD altimeter tapes. Very convenient.
 


&gt;If you lose both Attitude and Heading Reference Units (AHRUs), it reverts to the standby instrument built-in attitude &amp; heading gyro, but displays this on both pilot's PFDs for convenience.
 


&gt;If you lose both Inertial Reference Units, it will substitute GPS position, and nothing is lost.
 


&gt;If someone turns one or both IRSs off in flight (I hate it when they do that), you can realign them - as long as one of the GPSs is working!
 


&gt;There is no pneumatic system. The only engine bleed is used for that engine's anti-ice. Wing anti-ice is electric. Each of two air conditioning packs control two CACs, which are electric cabin air compressors. The four CACs share two air inlets on the belly. Each pack controller controls two CACs, but if a pack controller fails, the remaining pack controller takes over control of all 4 CACs.
 


&gt;There are no circuit breakers in the cockpit. To check on them, or if you get a message that one has opened (more likely), you select the CBIC (circuit breaker indication and control) display on one of the MFDs (multi function displays). There you can reset the virtual C/B if it is an ""electronic"" circuit breaker. You can't reset a popped ""thermal"" circuit breaker.
 


&gt;If you have an APU fire on the ground or inflight, the fire extinguishing bottle is automatically discharged. If there is a cargo fire, the first two of seven bottles will automatically discharge also.
 


&gt;There's a Nitrogen Generation System which provides automatic full-time flammability protection by displacing fuel vapors in the fuel tanks with nitrogen (Remember TWA 800?).
 


&gt;Like the 767 and 777, the 787 also has full CPDLC capability (controller-to-pilot datalink communications). In addition, its full FANS capability includes ADS-B in &amp; out. The controller can uplink speed, heading, and altitude changes to the airplane. These show up on a second line right under the speed, heading and altitude displays on the mode control panel. If you pilot wants to use them, he can press a XFR button next to each window. The controller can even uplink a conditional clearance, like - After passing point XYZ, climb to FL390. If you accept this, it will do it automatically."	t5_2qm1t	True

Was ferrying an aircraft back to the main base for maintenance. 3 hours flight to the base from where I am living. 

Its a C206. Got airborne early in the morning, everything was great. 
Beautiful weather, smooth air. With about an hour to go my stomach started to rumble.... Oh shit... literally.

I swear to god I have never been under so much stress. It came in waves and at one point I considered diverting or (using the ""comfort bag"" haha) I was sweating but at the same time trying to concentrate as I was descending and the destination airport was BKN 600 feet.
I turned on all the air vets and pointed them at me. The landing was the smoothest one I have ever made and I taxied off at about 30 knots, shut down and limped into the terminal. Never doing that again.

1370280398.0	1flbwu	Best aviation career advice I ever received: Chase the lifestyle, not the metal!	stygarfield	47	9	39	"Hello!

So, I figured I should share some advice with you all that I received very early on in my career. I'm hoping that this may turn into a bit of a primer for what pilots should expect in different career paths, but who knows that might happen! I'll edit and credit any submissions into the top post and hopefully that will help all of our STs and new CPLs out!


**Chase the lifestyle, not the metal**


The airlines are not necessarily where all pilots should aspire to end up. There is a **ton** of other jobs out there! Make sure you take the time and research what you want to be doing! Personally, I have no interest in the airlines, and am quite content flying small floatplanes for the rest of my career.


What I do (stygarfield, **Southern BC float pilot**):
I'm a full time float pilot on the southern coast of British Columbia. I work 4 days one week, and the next only work 3. I am home every night (barring unforeseen weather/mechanicals that maybe make me spend 1 or 2 nights away from base). On the night(s) I do have to overnight away from home, I am usually put in a 4-5* hotel on the company account (no pulling out my own VISA to pay for the room) with all meals expensed. Benefits are amazing (the best I've ever had), including tons of travel perks, jumpseat agreements, restaurant discounts, etc... My company even has a C172 that it keeps maintained just for licensed staff to rent, we even have one of our employees completing their PPL on it! While I do not make as much as those flying the same aircraft in the bush - I much prefer this lifestyle to living in the far north!


Like I mentioned earlier, I'll keep an eye on the comments to this post, and will edit in similiar ""What I do"" comments! If anybody has any questions, please feel free to ask away!

****
**From Iolar7000**
My considerations, in order of importance, when assessing a flying job:

**Job Security** - Can I buy a house and be reasonably sure I'll still have a job in this area in 5 years time. Will I have to move my kids aways from their school and friends because I've been made redundant and the nearest job is hundreds of miles away?

**Lifestyle Control** - How many days off do I get in a month, and how much choice do get over when they are? Will I get to spend much time with my family/friends? What are my chances of being around for a mates wedding or my kids birthday?

**Salary** - Can I afford to lead a decent lifestyle, own a comfortable home and plan for the future? Can I afford good healthcare for my family, a good education for my kids and perhaps indulge a little in some of my passions outside flying?

**Job enjoyment** - Quite simply, I'd enjoy flying most things. If a job ticks the three boxes above then it is pretty close to the top of my list regardless of whether it's airliners of float planes. I've seen people who've followed career paths that they thought would lead to more interesting flying at the expense of the points above and they've all lived to regret their decisions. They've found that while still enjoyable, the initial excitement fades with repetition. An ex-fighter pilot once said to me that even the thrill of low level flying dulls after you done enough of it. He didn't say it wasn't enjoyable anymore, just that the adrenaline rush he used to get lessened significantly. Ultimately what most people want at the end of the day is a job that they like a lot (if not love) but which will tick the boxes above."	t5_2qm1t	True

I still have to wrap my brain around steering with my feet, think I used the entire width of the runway for my takeoff.  Things seem to move so fast when you are on the ground, once we were in the air and leveled off I felt a bit more comfortable.  The landing shook me up, I told the instructor I needed his help and he coolly told me 'you got it' - well long story short I didn't have it and he had to step in about 150 ft above the surface and set it down.

All in all, I'm not sure if I enjoyed myself or not, I spent so much time paying attention to the gauges and the controls and trying to keep my stress level down that I didn't have much time to take it all in.

I want to give it a fair shot, and it doesn't seem right to throw in the towel after one time up, but I'm honestly on the fence about whether I should go back for my next lesson tomorrow.  Is this a typical experience?"	t5_2qm1t	True

2450: up to 5000, 330 on the heading, brickyard 2450. (moments later). Brickyard 2450 is getting a TA up here, do you have traffic for me?

ATC: brickyard 2450 traffic 1 o'clock 4000 southwest bound

2450: we just got an RA (plane telling them what to do) we are descending now. (moments later) PROVIDENCE, YOU JUST TURNED US RIGHT INTO A PLANE. WE GOT AN RA AND HAD TO DESCEND IMMEDIATELY.

ATC: roger continue your climb to 5000 contact Boston center, sorry about that guys.
2450: no problem, over to center see ya.


That wasn't the real flight number I just couldn't remember what it really was. Kind of nerve racking showing how ATC can be humans sometimes as well.

I get shit from my friends and other pilots, who have said to me: ""I wear a helmet for snowmobiling, riding motorcycles, and skiing, but I'm not going to wear one for flying, it ruins the experience."" That's fine, it's kinda like driving, you have safety harnesses, it feels safe in the enclosed cozy cockpit.

It's not. I have photos of a crashed 182 at Big Creek, Idaho that is balled up in the woods alongside the airstrip, blood *everywhere* on the panel. I don't think an open-face helmet could prevent that, but the combination of good shoulder harnesses could. The helmet lessens the severity of the side-impact.

I had a friend who crashed his '56 172 into terrain in idaho after flying up a terminal canyon. The wreckage was fairly intact, but he bounced his head off the door post and died after a few hours from his head injury. His wife spent a few nights with a broken neck at the crash site until they were found-- she survived.

Numerous accounts exist of pilots who were rendered unconscious for a few minutes post-crash. Those minutes might be all you need for egress from fire. A helmet could make the difference depending on the severity of the crash. The forces involved in an air crash are immense, sometimes nothing will help. There are other safety devices too, like the Amsafe airbag shoulder harnesses that are beginning to show up in some certified aircraft. In the photo I linked, the CubCrafters Sport Cub I am flying has them. 

Why post about it? Because it's something I'd like to see become more popular in GA. Everyone knows that the aviation fraternity is a little on the older, more conservative side, and trading your ballcap for a heavier helmet isn't exactly well received. *Helmets are for crazy ultralight pilots.* I'm not exactly happy to look like a wannabe Wedge or Biggs, but I feel a little better about crash survivability. I'm under the impression that we're a bit of a younger, more progressive pilot crowd on Reddit, so if you haven't given it any thought until now, look into it. Personally, I'm rather excited to plaster mine with stickers.

I have purchased a helmet for my wife as well. For other guest passengers with variable size heads, I'm not sure how to handle that.

Thanks for reading.



EDIT: I'd like to address in my OP a commonly issued caveat that I've gotten in response to advocating several different types of safety devices, including PCAS, ballistic parachutes, and of course, helmets. This is common not just to Reddit, but apparently in the thinking of pilots everywhere. The common argument, paraphrased, is: ""Don't let the use of a safety device affect your judgement or let you relax any vigilance that would be exercised without it.""

My response to that is:  I've been flying for 15 years; Not a long time by the measure of many, but in all those years I didn't consider wearing a helmet, and I've flown light aircraft into some pretty unfriendly and unforgiving places, amidst completely unlandable terrain, one-way no-go-around strips surrounded by 80 ft trees, airstrips at the end of narrow and deep canyons, yada yada yada, I'm not the boldest but I'm not the oldest either. To get to some of those places, one has to simply accept that the consequences of an engine failure or simple shitty piloting will result in the worst. I continued anyway. I will continue to do so. So, there's my judgement. It's a little different in every context, but I'm already practicing an aviation lifestyle that is pretty unforgiving anyway, simply by the places I like to go. The helmet is but a mere measure to increase the odds of survival, something realized when I put 2 and 2 together and realized the some of my friends have died in otherwise survivable crashes. It's something I've only recently decided to employ, in addition to my PLB and my survival pack...things that are relegated the back of the seat, and will hopefully continue to be forgotten for the rest of my career.

Finally, do what you like. If you don't like wearing a helmet, don't. If you feel your fragile judgement is at risk, don't. But there are some aviation-oriented options out there for people who would like to do so, FYI.

**TL;DR: I wear a helmet while flying light GA aircraft in hopes that it'll help me survive a crash that doesn't explode in a huge fireball upon impact. Some people feel that wearing helmets or using other safety gear alters your level of prudent judgement, I somewhat disagree and wrote a lot about it.**"	t5_2qm1t	True

I took two people up to KAFN, the Jaffrey airport in New Hampshire for ice cream from Kimball Farm. The place seems to be famous in the New England area, so I'm sure a lot of you on here know about Jaffrey and what a *nice guy* that runs the show over there...

Anyway, its about 8:30pm and I call over the CTAF that I'm on final for runway 34. All of a sudden the manager who seems to be famous in the region, calls me on the radio and says, ""Cessna on final, will you be staying overnight?""

I replied, ""No sir, we're just stopping real quick for some ice cream then heading back.""

To which he responded with, ""No visiting operations after sunset. Come back another day and plan your trip a little better to get here before then.""

I looked out my window to the left to see the sun had just barely started to set. I was pretty pissed off seeing as I just flew for almost an hour to get there, only to get told to fuck off. I knew it was a privately owned airport, so I figured he had the authority to say that. I just said ""Okay nevermind then,"" and went home.

My question is, what would you have done in this situation? The airport is privately owned but it is for public use. Does he really have the authority to tell me I can't land and take off after sunset? It doesn't say anything anywhere online or in the AFD about his little ""rule."" If he does have the authority to say that, what could he have even done if I landed anyway?

1. What was it like to issue the ""NO FLY"" call to the aircraft you were monitoring? Scary? Exciting? Sad?

2. Did any pilots question the legitimacy of what you were saying? Were they hesitant to divert and land?

3. How tense was the tower during and after the attacks?

4. Did any of the ATCs or yourself stop to watch the news? How were you informed otherwise?

5. Were you allowed to go home at your regular scheduled time, or were you requested to stay after and help manage some of the sure-to-be chaos?

**EDIT**: To those who are offended by this request, I would really like to apologize. I am the son of a flight attendant, but even I had no idea how taboo the general subject was to those in aviation.

I actually did my first try at the checkride last Monday, which I busted for a pretty silly reason.  The DPE ""failed"" my AI and DG right as I was about to enter the hold he had told me to fly.  However, the aircraft I fly is equipped with an HSI, which means that covering the DG also covers the Nav 1 CDI.  Unfortunately, I then proceeded to *completely* forget that the aircraft had a Nav 2 and a second CDI - the flight training device at my flight school doesn't have a second Nav, and the only time I'd ever used the Nav 2 in flight during training was for VOR checks.  Plus, most of my partial panel work was shooting partial panel RNAV approaches, where you can just use the CDI screen on the Garmin.  So I tried to fly my hold based on the GPS information, and the examiner busted me.

Went back out there today, though, and this time I made sure to dial in everything on *both* the HSI and the CDI.  Passed with flying colors.  Kinda neat quirky thing the examiner did at the end of the exam - he simulated a no-gyro PAR approach down to zero-zero conditions.  In other words, I stayed under the hood while he gave me turn instructions (""turn left... stop turn"") and power settings, then told me when to flare, and we touched down right on centerline without ever lifting the hood up.  (I think he was helping out with the rudder to get me perfectly lined up, but still - pretty cool.)"	t5_2qm1t	True

Here is a photo:  http://i.imgur.com/UUBqD92.jpg

It was a perfect day for a solo, calm winds and clear skies.  I had no idea it was getting so close, but I knew something was up when my CFI took the controls just after touchdown and asked me to grab my logbook.  He had never done that before.

Then after clearing from the runway, he stopped the plane, and asked ""So, you want to take this thing up for a trip around the pattern by yourself?""  I was speechless to say the least.  I have never felt so nervous and excited at the same time.  Then I thought.. ""no better time than the present!""

After he stepped out, he looked at me and said ""Why are you sweating and looking so wide-eyed?""  my response ""Well it maybe its just the excitement"".  He then said ""you will do great!"" and shut the door.

He had already explained what I needed to do, so I waited till he gave me cleared the rear of the plane and gave me thumbs up.  I taxied down the long (nearly 3500' taxi) taxi to the end, did my run-up and then lined up.  Said a little prayer right there on the numbers, and went full throttle. The climbout was awesome.  The 172 climbs so well with just one person!

It didn't really hit me that I had flown a plane until the wheels touched down on the first landing.  As soon as I had the nose down, and was on the brakes I had let out a ""WOOHOO"" (maybe an understatement).  

You other folks know this feeling, its one that can't be described.  It was one of the best days of my life, and I will always look back on it and smile.  Such an amazing feeling!

One other was a calculation requiring using the sectional and plotter, and a difference of one degree and 2 miles made the very similar answer different and I arrived at the wrong one.  No big deal.

My instructor said that's better than he did, so it's good enough for me!

Of course, I'm not yet flying anything that can reach those altitudes, but it can't hurt to get familiar with them, I figure.  On the map was an unusual symbol over northeastern Japan, as you can see [here](http://aviationweather.gov/data/products/swh/PGDE29_12_CL_new.gif).

1342765622.0	wv1bs	This has me worried.	FTroop09	36	0	17	"27 days ago Redditor ""NotAsThinkAsYouDrunk"" created [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/vg7da/flying_to_alaska/) about a trip he was planning from the LA area up to Alaska.  I was just watching the local news here in Anchorage, AK when they had a story about a crash yesterday north of Fairbanks.  They identified the two people in the crash and showed the plane that crashed (what looked to me like a piper of some sort) which is one of the types that NotAsThinkAsYouDrunk said they were taking.  They also said that the plane had been identified as being rented from Palo Alto, CA.  This all sounds eerily similar to the original post.

I had given this gentleman some advice on AK flying and I really hope this wasn't him or his mates.  [Link](http://www.adn.com/2012/07/19/2547834/air-guard-responds-to-report-of.html) to the news story.

**EDIT: /u/eagleace21 brought up a good point: I forgot to tell you all about it!**

I was a little concerned this time around since it seemed like I was buried under an avalanche of information during my PPL oral and checkout, yet it seemed ""easier"" this time around. I had to have a couple of conversations with my Instructor and the Assistant Chief Pilot just to be certain I was on the right track (they weren't concerned).

I must give a plug to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) - this flash card software tremendously increased my retention of the rote stuff that IFR pilots need to know. It's cross-platform!

Anyway, the oral went about as expected. I was caught a little off guard by not knowing where to find takeoff minimums (on Jeppesen charts, the DPE asked which I would be using for the flight). Aside from that, we pretty much breezed through the oral, I was able to quickly and confidently answer nearly every single one of his questions.

The flight was equally ""quick"". We headed out to KTNT and did the [KTNT ILS 9](http://155.178.201.160/d-tpp/1305/05744I9.PDF) approach, then followed the published missed before flying inbound again for the LOC 9, then flew runway heading as he coordinated for a pop-up clearance to the [KHWO GPS 10R](http://155.178.201.160/d-tpp/1305/05606R10R.PDF).

I had a small challenge with the hold as there was some weather beginning to move in and started pushing me south (even with 30º of wind correction!) of the localizer.

1339999589.0	v7p15	Had a close call tonight!	frogfoot21	34	3	27	"I was flying a Cessna 172 into KGLS today. After stopping mid-trip to refuel, we climbed back out on our merry way.  After about 30 mins, I watched the left fuel gauge make a  definite beeline for E, and the right fuel tank went straight to F. Seeing as how I was in an older airplane I figured 'great, the floaters in the tanks are stuck.' After staying like that after a few minutes of flying over a bumpy South Texas afternoon, I decided I was not comfortable not seeing my fuel levels and made for a nearby airport. Didn't like what I saw on the ground. The right gas cap had blown off, and the vacuum ( had my fuel selector on both) had sucked all of the gas out of the left tank, which was bone dry. Turned out the fuel gauges were right, the left was empty, and the vacuum made the right tank seem full. There were 9 gallons left in the tank with the open cap. 

My advice from this is: If you see your fuel gauges change quickly and read the opposite, don't assume you've had a stuck floater, assume you've lost the fuel cap. Are there any other strange, not too common instrument readings that should get your gears turning?

TL;DR: Lost a fuel cap, landed with my only fuel in a tank with no cap.

Edit: Thank you all for the words of advice and good commentary! The remainder of the trip went off without a hitch (after we secured a replacement fuel cap). I am now home with a lesson learned in ADM and mid-flight-pre-flights!

1375057668.0	1j8u3r	RV lands wrong way at Oshkosh today.	Darthnomster	39	9	60	Did anyone else see this happen this afternoon?  Somewhat strong winds have been from the west- southwest all day. Busy pattern. Dude sets up a really nice stabilized approach on 9, while everyone else is using 27. The guy touches down while someone else touched down in the opposite direction. Both go around at controller instruction.  One if the scariest moments I've seen. Controllers handled it well. Would love to know what consequences this guy faces. 	t5_2qm1t	True

Shut down real quick, jumped out and saw this KC-10 doing a missed approach! Way bigger than what we usually get, as 9R is only 5004'. From what I could find, KC-10's need a min of 7000'. I hope this was a former Ohio State student doing a flyby of home!
