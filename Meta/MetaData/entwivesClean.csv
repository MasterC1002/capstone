He gave me the biggest smile and said ""Actually, I would love that"" and we exchanged numbers. 

I've been a regular there for over a year coming in at least once or twice a week so we know each other pretty well. Yesterday I came in to get my usual incense and shisha and we start talking about valentines day. He made it a point to tell me he was single and then asked me if I had any romantic plans. I told him no that I was just going to dinner with a fellow entwife. Flirting/conversation continues and then I leave to get to class. 

I nervously go back after class and ask him if he wanted to go get drinks with me when he gets off work. We ended up liking the same beer bars and met up at one of them late last night. It was so much fun! He even paid for my drinks and he was the first guy to ever buy me a drink! We talked forever and had a great connection AND we're doing it all over again tomorrow!

We can't help that seeing some of our bodies make your little peepee's hard. Fucking control yourself. Seriously, do we have to be covered from head to toe just to post something? She is in a double layered tanktop and is holding up this pipe.

If this was a guy, no one would give a shit. It is because she is a woman and has tits that these guys are making a huge fuss. I just unsubscribed from /r/trees. I am done with those assholes and just sticking to us girls where it is safe!

**Edit**: Ok so I was a bit angry when I wrote this but I have smoked and cleaned my Ents turtle tank and have calmed down. I don't mean to attack all men or meant to say all of r/trees is bad. I know it comes off that way and maybe in my mind at the time I just could not find better wording. 

I still believe that we are subjected to be objectified but then we get scrutinized for it at the same time. We can't help that our boobs make us look sexy to you and that the stores only sell clothes that show them off. We are forced into being a sex object because that is what the world wants us to be and then when we are just trying to be normal, we are punished for it. 

I am a bit stoned so I don't think this is the best way to put it. When I am sober, i'll come back and edit again. I apologize if I have made anyone feel guilty about their gender, not everyone is an asshole. Much love. "	t5_2s7a6	True

1365737461.0	1c6nbv	To the entwives, from an ent	vinsneezel	166	14	31	"This girl in Harvard Square got run over by a 24-foot truck a few minutes ago. I didn't see the accident, but I did see the aftermath. She was lying on the pavement, surrounded by paramedics and policemen (and alive). I had just hit the ol' one-hitter and I watched for a minute, thinking about the random violence of life.

And then I saw the boyfriend. I've never seen a man so overcome. He was screaming like an animal as his friends held him back. I could almost hear his heart tearing in half.

I thought about my girlfriend. We have been together 2 years, and live together now. She supported me in my decision to go to massage school and start a new career at the age of 30. She is patient with my working two jobs, even though we only really get 1 or 2 nights a week together. When I wake up next to her, I'm always glad that I did, even though she takes up 7/8 of the bed. She doesn't seem to mind that my hairline is receding, even though I do.

I had never smoked and a little over a year ago, I started. She's a social smoker at best, and I quickly became an every day smoker. I did it because I enjoyed the way it made me feel less grumpy and revitalized my old enthusiasm for life that I lost sometime ago. And she supported me in that too, despite almost never partaking herself.

I love her and if anything ever happened to her, I know I'd be like that boy I saw today. And since she's such a great entwife, I just wanted to thank all of you. I read this sub all the time... I've always related better to women anyway. So on behalf of all the ents, thank you. "	t5_2s7a6	True
1351026396.0	11yudv	So I'm at about a [6] while at the vet...	KeepInKitchen	176	20	29	"So I had to take my brand new baby bunnies to the vet because my neighbor's rabbits got some bunny flu or something, and what I thought would be a TERRIBLE day of sick animals and expensive antibiotics  turned out way better than anyone could have expected!

There was this little girl (maybe 5-7) who was walking around the waiting room telling people what animal they looked like and why she thought that cool. That means every person was getting complimented by this amazing kid. 

She made her way around the room (as far as i can remember it went: monkey, dolphin, moose, cat, gold fish, cat, panda), came up to me and just started staring. I'd seen what she'd been doing so I played along. I started making weird faces and poses and what-not. Well, in the middle of all the silliness I accidentally yawned.

""You look like a lion!"" She shouted, giggling behind her hands.

So I did what any stoned and silly person would do: I roared my indoor roar, slashed at the air with my painted claws, and shook my wild mane in approval. Then she joined in! We roared and pretended to hold her cat in the air like Simba! We were having so much fun, when suddenly she stopped.

""You don't just look like a lion! You look like a Disney Princess if she were cool enough to be a lion! Like if Snow White was more lion-y!""

Let me say right now, that is the greatest compliment I've ever gotten. Not only am I a princess, but I am Disney Princess of the Jungle!!! I can't even think of something that would come close to how awesome that is!

So, I get called in the back. Fun time over, back to being an adult. I finish up with the vet and start to leave. The little girl comes up to me before I get to the door.

""You were the top of the food chain!"" She said, while handing me a friggin' blue raspberry Blow-Pop! Then she initiated a 7 step high five/fist bump/hand shake which we both ended with a big roar!

I do not know who was raising this child, but they are certainly raising her right. My current theory: my child is a time traveler.

tl;dr: I am high, my bunnies are fine, little kids kick ass, and I have candy."	t5_2s7a6	True

1337899853.0	u3iv2	How I've passed every (pre-employment) piss test--ladies only		156	11	67	"1) **Obtain clean urine.** This can be purchased as a [synthetic](http://www.antitest.com/synthetic-urine/ultra-pure.html), or you can always ask a friendly donor.

2) **Pour the sample into a condom free of lubricant and spermicide.** A regular lubed condom will work fine, just rinse it out first. Do NOT use a colored condom--the dye will seep into the sample. Condoms are great because they've already been burst-tested, and they fit naturally for where you're going to put it.

3) **Knot that shiz tight.**  You don't want air bubbles, especially if you  plan on storing the sample for later use (and you'll probably want to use gloves for tying the knot). YOU CAN FREEZE IT THIS WAY.  

4) **Use a glass of hot water to bring up the temperature.** If you freeze the sample in the condom, allow yourself about 60-90 minutes ahead of the test to defrost and bring up to approximately body temp. A drinking glass is the perfect size--drop the piss-cicle in the hot water, and once it's all melted, freshen up the water to make it warm before insertion. Even if you DON'T freeze it, heat it up this way first. It's easier for your body to *maintain* temperature than heat up a foreign object that's room temp.

5) **Insert into Nature's Pocket.** This is the most awkward part, but there really isn't a better way to keep the sample at body temp (or to hide it from pat-downs!) than to do a little clam cramming. The easiest way I've found is to lie on my back with my legs up, and use 3 fingers to kind of 'shoehorn' the condom and push it up in there. DON'T PANIC, you need to be relaxed. It feels weird and you're going to worry about the condom leaking or breaking, but barring any kind of *vagina dentata* condition (and assuming you've knotted it securely) you're safe.

6) **Don't forget your implements!** Stick a bobby pin with a nubbin cut off in your hair, or a tiny set of nail clippers in your pocket. You need to perforate the condom in order to fill the cup, but you don't want a mess everywhere. You also don't want to make the hole so small that it cools significantly by the time it's filled the cup. I'd say no smaller than 1/8"" or 3-4mm.

PROTIP: Stick a napkin or paper towel in your pocket (or bra) so you have somewhere to put the condom when you're done. Clinics have been getting more stringent with their policies--no running water in the restroom until you're done, no flushing the toilet--and you'd better believe they check the trash after you're out. You'll want to wad the condom into the napkin and stick it somewhere on you for disposal elsewhere.

If anyone wants to supplement this, feel free :) Just figured I'd make a post to refer back to, since this topic seems to come up a good bit.

**Edit 1:** As [djspacebunny](http://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/u3iv2/how_ive_passed_every_preemployment_piss/c4s4ny7) pointed out, one can use a plastic travel-size shampoo bottle in the same fashion. It would definitely be easier to insert!

1358376468.0	16poea	Love of trees cost me my job today (random vent session)	trish5713	132	4	35	"Hey. So this is my first every reddit posting thing and I just needed to vent a bit. Two weeks ago I started a new job. I work in the animal medical field and have never ever had to take a drug test. Ever. I love my job and would never go to work under the influence so no boss ever knew or cared what I did in my off time. Imagine my surprise when I'm told I need to take a urine test on my second day. I decided to come clean with my office manager who assured me that it would be fine, that she was glad that I was honest, and that she would do her best to get the practice owner on board with maybe retesting me once a month or randomly or something once I had 6 weeks to clear out my system. Flash forward to today. The results are in and I tested positive for marijuana metabolites. Surprise surprise. But instead of being given the chance to change for them (which makes me sad but I was willing to do it) I get canned on the spot. Apparently it's too much of a liability. So I could go home and drink myself stupid every night and come to work hungover but if I smoke a joint to relax and give me some fibromyalgia relief then I get fired. Cool. And the best part is that the two weeks I was there I worked my ass off and got told by pretty much everyone there how awesome I was to work with and how happy they were to have me. 
Thanks to anyone who read this. It's nice to be able to vent to some like minded people. My ent is being so supportive and I think a tiny little bit of him is happy to have his smoking buddy back since I stopped smoking the day I took the test. No other vet clinics around test (I know people that work at other places) so I'll be fine getting another job. It's just a bummer.

Because I find this sub to my 'home' and love coming here every day, I wanted to contribute something meaningful. Also, I'm at a comfortable [4] while waiting for the husbEnt to come home. So I present to you all:


Why Entwives is Better than /r/Trees

1. A smaller population. While having a larger population leads to increased exposure, it also means an increase in content. More content does not mean better content. While the idea of spreading the message of trees is noble, its larger presence leads to commentary from many of those not aligned with the peaceful Ent way.

2. Fewer teenagers/immature subscribers. Typically on /r/entwives, I see responses to posts that are meaningful. They include helpful advice, commiseration, celebration and all the things the OP asked to receive. /r/Trees currently is harboring a large population of youngsters who love to submit....for lack of a better word [5]....frustrating content. 

3. We love to discuss what it means to be an adult Ent. Legalization, cooking, techniques, money, budgeting, love, etc. are big topics here. We're real people who enjoy the trees, not turd burgulars that OMFG I GOT SOOOOO HIGH LAST WEEKEND. We talk about socializing in the real world as marijuana enthusiasts.

4. Uhmmm.....

I refused to give up and remained in the ring until the last uninformed, closed-minded herb-bigot gave up on me.

I thought it odd that so many people would assume someone as willing to respond to questions and allegations as myself would do so without some knowledge of various CPS laws, or understanding of chemistry, medicine, physiology, general US law, state law, or to be in possession of the skills needed to be a caring, decent, responsible parent. Most told me that if I ever had a child, s/he would grow up to be a loser, a fuck-up, and an all around bad person.

One person, upon getting exasperated with my progression of logic, commented on my maturity level by asking ""how old are you, like, 22?"" It made my day, seeing as how my *kid* will turn 22 this weekend, and I didn't even get into the motherhood business until I was in my 30's. Perhaps the trees keep me young?

I am sure I changed no minds, and I remained relatively polite throughout, so I can only hope that perhaps I helped spread at most a bit of love, at least a little tolerance for Ents, Entwives, and ParEnts everywhere."	t5_2s7a6	True

Edit: Thanks for all the love! I talked to my co-op office.I already knew I wouldn't get kicked out of school and they said they don't contact my job about it either. It's up to my employer if they find out.

1353478190.0	13jyci	On sexism and misogyny in r/trees	STR33TL16HT	118	17	85	"Hi ladies,

I'm frustrated with the sexism in /r/trees. It's nothing new, of course, but I think part of my anger stems from the way Ents don't seem to notice the problem. /r/trees is frequently hailed as a ""safe"" subreddit, where people are free from the hate and petty squabbles you might find in other subreddits. Often, I'll see someone say something like ""chill man, /r/trees is about the love."" Well, I'm not seeing much love for entwives. 

I've decided to start reporting the sexist comments. Even if the comments don't break the subreddit's guidelines, I think it's important to send a message to the mods that we find them unacceptable. I've also [contacted the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees), and I encourage others to do the same. Here's what I said:

&gt;Hello lovely moderators,
&gt;
&gt;I am concerned by the tolerance for sexism and misogyny in /r/trees. Whenever women are shown in a picture, the comments section will inevitably be a cesspool of creepy comments, sweeping (and often negative) generalizations about women that smoke, and misogynistic slurs (cunt, bitch, twat, etc). 
&gt;
&gt;Can we see some action from the mods? For a 'peaceful' and chill subreddit, there's an awful lot of hate spewing from its members. I love /r/trees, but it's disheartening to see such lack of respect for women constantly. Why can't we have a guideline that says something about showing respect and decency towards others? What about encouraging people to report nasty comments in an effort to show the community that sexism (and racism and homophobia and transphobia and so on) will not be tolerated? 

Is there something else we can do as a community? What do you do when you see a sexist comment on /r/trees?

Update #1: http://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/yhwi6/update_ladies_i_have_to_share_my_joy_with_all_of/

Ladies, let us take a moment to say FUCK 2012!!! 

Now that we have that out of the way, I am EXTREMELY EXCITED to be sharing this update with all of you! MY BOYFRIEND BEAT HIS CANCER!!! So let's back it up a little since I see the last update was not entirely accurate. The sperm bank was a bust: there was no sperm to freeze as the cancer had already made him sterile. My boyfriend had to go through 12 weeks of chemo (he was stage 3/3) and then have his left testicle removed. The 12 weeks of chemo were DREADFUL. He repeated this cycle 4 times: week 1: 5 days a week/6 hours a day. weeks 2+3: 1 day a week/6 hours a day. Chemo was like a full time job. He went through 28 treatments and I was there for every one of them! He got so sick after the 5 days weeks, he would throw up all weekend and lose 20 pounds (they weighed him every morning before chemo). He is so strong, and so positive. He is my inspiration. 

He had his last chemo treatment on 11/19/12. He had his first ""good"" CT scan on 11/30/12. The testicle they removed on 12/7/12 came back negative for cancer (the chemo worked!). So, now what? Well, lots and lots of follow ups. It takes a few good CT scans til they will declare he is ""in remission"" and then 5 YEARS of good CT scans til he is declared ""cancer free"".

He is going back to work today, and I got laid off on thursday. I didn't like the job anyway! When you are faced with the love of your life having a possibly terminal illness, losing your job just ain't a big deal! 

So 2013, I hope you are ready! I sure am! "	t5_2s7a6	True

I'm all alone, in the middle of nowhere. No Internet (using my iPhone), no cable. No outside contact other than via my phone. I smoked a rather lot last night, ended up spooning in the bed with my furry beast of a nephew while sleeping. ( he's a big boy, half pit half mastiff all lover) Being able to be completely free of every tiny, microscopic, anxiety inducing problem feels incredible. I have a fridge filled with fresh fruit, vegetables, and tofu. I'm happy. I honestly cannot remember the last time I felt truly happy. My body isn't tense and aching, my mind is calm and cool. I feel so full of awesome. I just wanted to let you girls that are going through the rough times know, that it's okay to put your life on pause, crank some good tunes, smoke trees, paint your nails, and most importantly to spoon with a large breed dog in bed once in a while.

1. Slept in until 11
2. Took care of some stuff that needed attending to (finally..)
3. Made breakfast with my man (college student and we really splurged--bacon, sausage, pineapple, cinnamon rolls..)
4. Been kind of bummed for the past couple of days. A good friend of mine recently passed away and I'm all out of whack because of it. So, like any ent/entwife would do, I'm smoking to cope. 
5. Boyfriend has kind of given me my space, but insisted that I pack the vape while nude. Of course I obliged..
6. Ended up smoking and having the best sex and orgasm that I've ever had in my life. Literally. 
7. Not sad anymore.

TMI, I know. I just know that there's going to be someone on this sub who will appreciate having a much MUCH needed good day.

My son who is 5 1/2 is high functioning autistic. His name is Charlie. This past year he has made leaps and bounds and is doing amazing. This past week he has really started to come into his own and really show he has an opinion. Yesterday while getting ready to take him to his summer camp- Farm school- I put his things in a new tote I had made for him. He looked at me and said ""mom, where's my back pack? All the kids will have back packs and I want mine too."" I stood there a little stunned and then as a tear ran down my cheek I helped him find his back pack and put his stuff in it. I went to put his lunch box in and he said ""mom, I will carry my lunch box, just like the other kids."" And the flood gates opened and I did the happy cry while telling him sure and zipping up his bag. 

This was an amazing thing to experience and when I told my husband he teared up a little and told Charlie what a cool kid he was. So tonight I am laying in bed, listening to my husband read the kids their bed time story (Harry Potter), when I hear the following conversation take place.

Charlie: Dad, I have a question.
Husband: What is it buddy?
Charlie: What's your favorite color?
Husband: I like Blue.
Charlie: why?
Husband: I don't know, just always have!
Charlie: Dad, what's your favorite food?
Husband: Anything mom makes! I like it all! 
Charlie: But what?
Husband: (names off several dishes) What's your favorite Charlie?
Charlie: Muffins!

OMG ladies!!!! OMG!!!! This is THE first ever full on conversation we have ever had with Charlie. This is the first moment he has EVER asked a personal question. He has never asked or done anything like this before. I am laying in bed just crying, listening to his sweet voice and the simple conversation he is having with his dad. This is such a huge moment for us. I want to remember this moment forever. "	t5_2s7a6	True

1359138076.0	179n3i	A rant at a [0]	bride_of_dankenstein	86	3	24	"‎2 1/2 years. The longest relationship I've ever been in. In these 2 1/2 years, I've had 2 suicide attempts. One taking a whole bottle of my anti-depressants [ironic] and the other by drinking Comet, a hard cleaner. I've went from cutting, even carving the word ""fat"" onto my stomach, to burning, to pulling out fistfulls of hair, to leaving bruises all over my body. I've been called worthless, a whore, deformed, ugly, fat, even so far as to going in detail about my competition. We would have fights. Big fights. Why I didn't believe in god, why I didn't fight back harder against my rapist [he was another boyfriend I dated for 8 months at the time], how I destroyed his family and friendships. How everyone hated me. How I should be ashamed of my pansexuality. How I should get over my jealousy. How I should let him drink, even though he was a mean, mean drunk. Even after he pushed me into a towel bar and left a bruise on my backside, I stayed. 
Well I don't want to stay anymore. I don't want to feel worthless anymore. I don't want to have to keep worrying about if he's finally drank himself to death and is left in a gutter somewhere, or still talking to his ex, or making out with some pregnant black girl because her boyfriend is abusive. 
I want someone to be proud of me. For supporting my parents, for working 3 jobs. I want to be respected. I want to be loved and cherished. I want to get presents for my birthday, for Christmas. I want to feel pretty. 
 So toke one up for me, lady. My pipe that he bought me broke. 

tl;dr: You are beautiful and you must never forget that you are a princess. 

Edit: Thank you all for such amazing words of kindess. I really, really appreciate it. If any of you ladies in WV, I'd be honoured to toke with you &lt;3

1367035415.0	1d76ts	Hello Entwives! I achieved something I never thought possible this month and I feel like sharing my excitement!	sjmartin12	86	5	13	"So this year has been a pretty tough one. I struggled with depression. In July my dad died of cancer, two days after he died my mom found out that he was cheating on her, my long term boyfriEnt and I split up while his father was going through chemo as well, and all the while I've been having to look after my mother who struggles with anorexia. I can honestly say that weed kept me sane through this whole process!
But recently, life has improved so drastically and so much has happened! After a long hiatus from studying theatre at my local university, I managed to get a role as a pinup model in a new play that just premiered in March. It was such a great confidence booster, and I rediscovered my passion for performance again, that I had lost over the years due to fear and self doubt. 
Around February I had started writing little bits of comedy material and jokes in my spare time, never having the guts to really perform stand up comedy. I always found that whenever I got stoned at home in the mornings before I would work my night shifts, I would think of insightful, and sometimes absurd jokes that would make burst into laughter on my own. 
Well, just three weeks ago a friend of mine who is involved in theatre encouraged me to perform at an open mic at a comedy club. I was terrified at the idea of it, but somehow I mustered up the courage to do a five minute set. I was the only female performer, amongst fifteen male comics, many of whom were professionals. And I still have no idea how, but I ended up totally rocking the performance.
After the show, I was invited to compete in a comedy competition the following week, by a bunch of the comedians there. And by some kind of miracle, I WON FIRST PLACE! Now I'm off to the finals next week and I have a chance at winning 500 dollars! My newspaper wrote an article about me, and I hosted an open mic night at another comedy club.
Never had I ever dreamed that I could be funny enough to be a standup comic! And now in such a short amount of time, at the young age of 20, and thanks to the help of my good friend Mary Jane, I seem to be doing it. 
It's scary as hell, and as a young female in a male dominated society, I get really overwhelmed by it all, but I also feel very empowered. I got my sense of humour from my Dad. He would have been so proud. "	t5_2s7a6	True

1348834704.0	10m5ke	Why we are called r/entwives	RastaMom	84	7	23	"We're doing some changes to the sidebar. To save space, we are moving most of the text to a .self thread we will link in the sidebar.

The suffix ""-wife"" is meant to imply a curation role, such as in ""midwife"". As midwives (for many centuries) curated the wisdom of pregnancy and birth, so Entwives curated the wisdom of plant lore, which they then passed on to the children of Arda. Ents protected plants by being physical defenders, while Entwives protected them by making elves and men see how useful plants could be if properly cared for.

*""Treebeard says that the Entwives began to move farther away from the Ents because they liked to plant and control things, while the Ents liked to let things take their natural course, so they moved away to the region that would later become the Brown Lands across the Great River Anduin, although the male Ents still visited them. The Entwives, unlike the Ents, interacted with the race of Men and taught them much about the art of agriculture.*

Apparently the male Ents and female Entwives exhibited a marked degree of sexual dimorphism; the male Ents all resemble wild forest trees that they guard (oaks, rowans, etc.), but the Entwives guarded agricultural plants, and it would thus seem to be implied that they resembled the various agricultural plants and trees they guarded: Treebeard remarks that their hair was the hue of ripe corn (grain).

*The Entwives lived in peace until their gardens were destroyed by Sauron, and they themselves disappeared. The Ents looked for them but never found them. It was sung by the Elves that one day the Ents and Entwives would find each other. Indeed, in The Return of the King, Treebeard implored the Hobbits not to forget to send word to him if they ""hear any news"" of the Entwives ""in your land"".""*

She lives out in the middle of nowhere up in the mountains, without electricity or running water, and has managed to rig up and grow all of the things she needs.  Over the weekend my bf's family and I put up a solar panel system so she can get off generators and be totally green, which, speaking of, we ended up talking about lol.  She grows her own, and I ended up pulling out my mflb and my water pipe and showing them off.

I had mentioned that we had some stress in our lives, my boyfriend has been sick lately. So, we went to the beach. The day before our 5 year anniversary the doctor called and advised the CT scan was not good and my boyfriend has cancer. He is 29. Needless to say, our anniversary and trip were pretty sad. We came home a day early. When we got home from the beach the doctor admitted my boyfriend to the hospital for 4 days. After many tests and days of waiting they said he has testicular cancer. They released him from the hospital so that he can go to a cryogenic sperm bank, in case we want kids in the future (chemo can make you infertile). He is going to start 9 weeks of chemo on Friday. The doctor gave a very good prognosis, 90% cure rate. 

I originally came to you ladies to share my joy, now I am sharing my sadness. Our friends and families have been so supportive, but I know there is a hard road ahead. I am going to be there for him every step of the way. 

If you can, take a moment and be thankful that your family and friends are healthy. Sometimes, we take it for granted. "	t5_2s7a6	True

I remember getting angry over certain Mr. Nice Guys posting rage comics on /r/trees. I remember feeling betrayed by Cinsere. I remember the 2011 Christmas exchange, and a million questions about New Years Eve dates, and on and on. Furthermore, I remember **TALKING** about them. A year and half ago, that's what we all did, we talked and discussed and blabbered on about everything. The occasional link would get posted, but in the comments, you bet there was a discussion brewing. I remember sometimes posting links inside a self.post just because I felt simultaneously bad about getting link karma (in a community where nearly nothing is downvoted, it's hard to not get away with more karma than you'd get elsewhere), and hopeful that I would spark some insight. Listen ladies, the new posting rules aren't really... well... new. They're really the rules we all silently abided by back in the beginning. If we all wanted a million pictures of nail polish filling up the front page, we'd all be in /r/RedditLaqueristas, just like we go to /r/aww for cats, and /r/trees for asshats*. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that somewhere along the way, we (that's right, I got my finger pointed at myself too) have all taken advantage of our welcoming nature and our tendency to upvote everything as entwives has grown. The face of entwives has changed; change isn't necessarily bad, but it has to be for the better, and promoting discussion isn't going to hurt anyone.

*this reflects only my opinion and not necessarily the opinion of r/entwives.

TL;DR: Back in the beginning, entwives was much more discussion oriented, and these new posting rules are really meant to increase rather than stifle creativity by steering us back towards our original direction. Trust me, the mods know what they're doing."	t5_2s7a6	True

So I was doing laundry today at a [5] when the highdea struck me to fasten the hooks on all my bras before putting them in the washer.  Lo and behold, it worked!  It made me think of you ladies and I just thought I'd share.

Afterward, we headed to a shop to get a roller and papers. Both the employees were women, and there were a couple of groups of people at the shop, all women.

I've been on a weight-loss kick for a while, and over the summer I dropped from a size 14 jean to a 10 (YAY!).

Went to the cafe downstairs for coffee, and while I was waiting with a coworker, a good looking older gentleman came up to me and leaned in, and said ""you are beautiful"" then just walked away. 

I smiled so big! And I'm still smiling on the inside!! That's the kind of stuff that makes all of these sweat and tears worthwhile.

Today is my birthday. 

My ent of four years (best friend for 2.5 yrs and SO for 1 yr 8 mo) broke up with me three weeks ago and I've been doing all right... but today when I woke up, it hit me like a train. Although I know the break up was for the best (our lives started taking us different directions... no anger, bitterness, or resentment thank god) it's still hard to make it through this day when I know he would have made it so special for me. I miss him more than I can say. Every day I hope to wake up and find him here in bed next to me, and I'm crushed when he's not. 

Anyway, sorry for the sob story. Normally I'd post this in /r/breakups, but I don't feel like being yelled at to maintain no contact, haha. I've been holding strong and doing my best to heal.

1325045126.0	nt5ng	Ladies, please oh please use that Holiday money to shop locally this year! 	IAmDubSteph	77	6	13	I'm really trying not to be preachy but today my heart was broken. I watched my boss, a 48 year old man cry his eyes out. He owns a local, community based party store in a downtown suburb. It was his dream. And for alot of years he made good money, even enough to send his only daughter to Veterinary school. (Which, side note: he is so proud of her!) And then the economy got bad. People slowly stopped spending money on frivolous things like parties. This year his sales are down by $10,000 from last year. (a total of almost $35,000 in the past five years) He can only afford two employees and feels awful when he can't give us raises or Holiday bonuses. Today while apologizing for being un-able to give us a Holiday gift, he began to cry. He explained how hurt he was by his dream dwindling right before his eyes, but that he was willing to do anything to keep the buisness alive. We hugged him, told him it was ok and I got to thinking. I'm guilty of it too. It's easier just to go to Walmart as a one stop shop for whatever I need. But what am I doing to these businesses? Hell, I like them more then Walmart any day, why am I not shopping them at least some of the time? So I beg you my entwives, if you've got some cash to spend think about taking it local.

We went for a cruise, and I end up forgetting about it. I come home at about [4] or [5] to write a paper for an exam tomorrow. Then I see my package! 

So I finally get to open my entwife package and every single thing made me smile...

A hunk of DARK chocolate (my favorite- i don't eat milk choc)
Pineapple cookie things
A chocolate chip cookie

and two other little packages. All I had said in my suggestions as ""baby sealssss"". They are my thing. Anyone who knows me knows I love baby seals"". In fact, if you're someone who I know in rl who uses reddit, you'll probably figure out who I am from this post. Also, I'm glad that this is entwives so I won't have to worry about any ""clubbing seal"" jokes cuz you ladies are so awesome.

My secret Santa got me a coin purse with a baby seal on it and little tiny baby seal ceramic earrings.

This is probably the most perfect gift I've ever received.

1364951820.0	1bk25k	Getting 'Cheeched'	pashafisk	76	8	35	"My mom has chronic pain throughout her body. She's been dealing with different doctors, different pills, and has been on Vicodin daily for the past couple years. She is seeing a doctor to find a better solution, because she keeps running out of pills a couple days before she can refill her prescription. I recently had a minor surgery, where I was given a prescription for Vicodin, I didn't even take half of them. 

I was going to visit my mom today, and she asked if I would be willing to bring my leftovers, but that she hoped she would never have to take them. She also has sleeping pills she has to take most nights so she can fall asleep despite her pain. Last night, she took one of her pills.

She continued texting me even after she took the sleeping pill (which is always entertaining) and the last text she sent me before falling asleep asked if I happened to have any ""green stuff"" because it had been a while (since she was a teenager) but she may be willing to try it.

When I got to her house today we were joking around, I mentioned her text, and she told me that she was rereading it this morning, and couldn't figure out what she had been talking about. I told her I assumed she meant weed, and it instantly clicked.

We sat around and talked for a little while, then we went outside and sat at the picnic table where I packed a bowl. I brought some water outside with me, and told her to go slow, stop whenever she wanted, and that maybe since it had been about 30 years, she may want to just take a hit or two.

She had no problem sharing a whole bowl with me. Afterwards we went back inside, talked a bit, she was really giggly, and ate a couple cookies. I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I was coming out she was standing there with a big smile on her face.

""Its gone. My pain is gone. Even my headache is gone. My body doesn't ache! Why can't this be legal?""

It made me feel awesome that I could share this with her, and make her feel good, without filling her with painkillers. We now have a code word for it, and I'm going to be bringing some back with me every time I visit her.

TL;DR: Mom with chronic pain who hasn't smoked in 30 years smoked with me today. She felt better than she has in years on painkillers. Smiles all around.

I just wanted to share what made me happy today.

Entwives isn't about posting things that are ONLY related to being a female tree smoker. 

It's about US. It's about who we are. It's about our thoughts and insecurities; our hopes and fears; our successes and failures; our dreams and nightmares; our proud moments and disappointments. It's about finding like-minded people to discuss daily life with and knowing that when you come here it won't be judged. 

And if you ARE here to judge we'll downvote you to oblivion and put a ""NO BOYS ALLOWED"" sticker on your forehead. :)

We buried him in the front yard with red tulips all around and a large stone to mark his place. I felt terrible because it was probably something that I did/didn't do which put him in the health condition he was in. We did everything we could to get him better but he was just too far sick to bring back so I made his passing as easy for him as I possibly could. 

I've been heart broken, this all happened around my birthday and my present from my father was a brand new basking dock for him which he hand built. I decided that I wouldn't get another turtle for quite some time so that I could make sure nothing like that would ever happen again, I feel so responsible. However tonight my boyfriends cousin showed up at our house unexpectedly with a baby yellow bellied slider, it was a present for my boyfriend's mother (it's her birthday tonight) but she had no place big enough to put her and so she had my boyfriend come surprise me with [her](http://imgur.com/TSiDS).

I almost cried. [She's so beautiful.](http://imgur.com/JZ8ep) Anyway I just wanted to share something that made me really happy today. We smoked a lot of weed about it.

Now, after these 4 wonderful, enlightened years I can't even believe I used to think that way, and frankly, I can't believe how much better my life is now that I've become a proud stoner. My back and neck hurt less, even when sober, my sense of connectivity with and appretiation for my planet and my fellow humans has flourished, and even the great relationship i had with my mom has improved, as we now share stories of our stoney experiences and views.

I recently discovered /r/trees, and yesterday I realized /r/entwives is a thing that exists, and I couldn't be happier. The entire /r/trees community and its subreddits is full of some of the friendliest, most relaxed, and overall most accepting people I've ever known, and, much like irl when I meet someone who also smokes, I feel like we were all friends before we even met, as sappy as that sounds.

On 2-9-10 she disappeared, her car was found on a rural back road that night, and her body in the river four days later.

Her killer was arrested that October. His DNA matched that found at the site where her body was found, and her blood was found in his apartment carpet. I know the killer as well. I've grown up with him. He worked for my mother. And I have no doubt he is guilty... he IS that kind of person.

Today begins jury selection for the trial. I'm scared because this sick waste of space took a beautiful person away, I'm scared because his attorney is known for winning for guilty clients. I'm scared because if he walks, it will tear this town apart. I'm scared because if he doesn't walk, it could do the same. 

I'm scared that justice will not be served, and Mackenzie so totally deserves it.

No matter the outcome of the trial, I know it is in the greater power's hands. Please smoke a bowl for myself and our little town, getting ready to go through the ugliest ugly that has happened in a long time."	t5_2s7a6	True

Three years ago, I met a guy, fell hard and we were in love. For a while. Then he started to change. And, really, they were positive changes. But one of those changes was that he wants kids. I really don't.

So we broke up. And for two days I cried and barely ate.

But then something occurred to me. He ended things because he knew I would never want what he did. I would have done the same thing. I realized that our friendship was always the main focus of our relationship. That would never change.

So I went on a date with a very nice man who also does not want kids (POF really delivered in this case) and there was no anxiety or emotional baggage.

She brought it to my attention, and I apologized and told her I'd be happy to keep it at the conventional price but I could also void it off and charge her for organic. She said she wanted to be charged the higher price, so I complied. 

Monday my boss pulls me aside and tells me that they received a complaint from her about not being charged enough for asparagus or some apples (conventional vs. organic prices). I tell my boss the story and that I don't remember anything being said about the apples, but I would have fixed those too. We leave it at a 'cool, just be aware of that problem and look to see if a product is organic or not rather than assuming'. I had already started doing that, so I wasn't that concerned and just thought it was pretty funny that a customer actually complained about not being charged enough at a place that is frequently referred to as Whole Paycheck. 

Yesterday my boss has me log off my register early because the complaint was sent to store management and they want me to write a statement about what happened. After I hand it in I ask if I'm going to be written up and he tells me he doesn't know what they plan to do. 

I used to work in a different department where the boss hated me and wrote me up for some complete bullshit that put me on a final warning. This means if I get written up before June I lose my job. There's nothing I can do to defend myself against this.

So I turned 23 yesterday. I've had a hard childhood and birthdays haven't been important to me, because it hasn't been important to anyone else. I've been in a relationship with my ent for the past 2 1/2 years or so. On my 21st bday, didn't do anything. He had to work all day and night, so I understood and wasn't too upset. 22nd bday, he had to go to orientation at his new college, so that was fine. 23rd bday, we're living together now, are kind of in a bad situation (both unemployed, just trying to get on our feet). So, all I wanted for the day is to relax and enjoy myself at home. All I wanted. I even gathered the energy to go buy myself some weed, cotton candy hookah tobacco, alcohol, and a mint creme pie to serve as a half assed bday cake. 

So we go and get these, put everything away, and he starts making dinner and stating we have to talk. We have both been procrastinating with things and that was the subject. I've always been a very independent person, and tend to get a little offended when people tell me how I should be living my life. HE has the tendency to channel his father during talks and comes across as very condescending. Basically, ""you're 23 now, what are you doing with your life, you have no goals"". Which I do. I stated ""I've always been a very independent person"", and he responds, without missing a beat, ""Well look at where that's gotten you."" I was pissed and left the room. We talked over it after he followed me, but I didn't know what he wanted me to do RIGHT THEN to make him fucking satisfied. All I wanted to do for THIS NIGHT IN PARTICULAR was to ENJOY myself. 

That ruined EVERYTHING. 

I was sick was anger and refused dinner to go take a long bath to unwind. Didn't help much. Smoked a bowl with my ent while pretty much ignoring him, to see if that would help me get over it. Nope. A night full of hookah, weed, alcohol, pie, and movies was nonexistent. Now I'm here crying, finally releasing my frustration. I was up until about 3-4 upset, trying to read and fall asleep. I know he feels bad but I don't think he realizes how much he hurt me. 

Well, here's to the hope of an acceptable birthday NEXT year. 

Also, got an email this morning stating I didn't get the much needed job that I thought I had for sure.

I'm used to being in charge of things, being the ""planner"", and keeping track of the details - because who else is going to?

Sometimes - and I've been realizing this more and more recently - this makes me a bit (*cringe*) nit-picky. I'll get so caught up in the ""Did we get caught up in this and this, and I thought such and such, and what about whoozit and whatzit?"" and so forth.

But trees slow me down so I don't get caught up in the details of everything and I finally am moving mellow enough to ask myself, ""Does it matter?""

And 90% of the time, it just doesn't. Or it doesn't right then, or I'm stressing on something that's going to change anyway. Or, it's something my ent takes care of just fine, so why am I worrying except to worry?

So thanks, trees, for helping me be a better partner, and helping me naturally work through my trust issues (learning to trust my ent will take care of things so I don't need to worry/can relax). I'm pretty sure I'd end up a lonely old biddy and an angry, alienating workaholic without trees to help me see things in a broader perspective!

Just thought I'd throw my growing self-revelation out there for you lovely ladyents (yes, you! You're lovely!), and to say that if you are like me and struggle to loosen up your control gears.....well....hi, I guess! You're already an ent so I guess the advice I was about to give didn't really make sense. Oh well.

1360532769.0	189n3p	This just in: my dad's midlife crisis has led him to become obsessed with Jamaican culture.	metaljellyfish	69	7	26	"Alright, here's the scene. I've just put my two little sisters to bed. I'm in my living room with my dad and stepmom. Dad just put on some mellow music and he's kicking back on the couch with his eyes closed. For context: they're kinda the epitome of a white upper-middle class liberal family - well traveled, intellectual, environmentalists (except when CFL bulbs just don't give off the same glow as their incandescent counterparts, then all bets are off), had their ""wild"" days back in the 70's/80's, never seen a day of real hardship in their lives, gigantic house, trendily decorated but filled with too much shit, yadda yadda yadda. And they just came back from a week in Jamaica.

I knew something was up when my stepmom asks my dad to do something, and he just kinda… didn't respond. She asked again and he responds, ""whoa, whoa. Don't come between me and the music, I'm really getting into it."" She looks at him. ""Did you light up after we got home? The fan's on in the bathroom. And you're acting stoned."" No, he didn't, but it sure seems like it.

Then he launches into it. Apparently he had this incredible experience in Jamaica in which he discovered reggae, Bob Marley, and rasta culture in general. He goes on and on about how he really *bonded* with the staff at this upscale resort, and got all kinds of perks after he hooked them up with some free drinks, and he got a fist bump paired with a ""respect, mon"" and it made his life. Then he and my stepmom both go on about how the CIA obviously assassinated Marley for being a revolutionary. My dad gets this wistful look in his eyes and starts talking about profound the colors of Jamaica are... it's as if he has a crush!

I mean, all that's cool. He obviously had a great time, and he's gotten turned on to a pretty cool culture. But I was shocked I was having this conversation with my 60-year-old dad instead of a room full of stoned 19 year old boys who have just discovered weed and rebellion and reggae and have decorated their entire room with stuff they bought from the local head shop.

I tried to explain why this was totally, hilariously absurd to me. They didn't get it.

I could hardly keep a straight face. They were regaling me with stories of how all these dudes calling them ""mon"" and selling them weed had meant so much to them. Awesome, but the reality is that they're tourists in a region known for its copious consumption of weed where the tourism industry puts food on the table. To take it personally is overkill.

Now, I'm not a reggae fan and the green-yellow-red-black color combo doesn't suit me. Overall I'm pretty neutral about the whole matter. But the thing is, where I'm from the rasta thing is super cliche at this point - it feels like folks use it as branding instead of as embracing a culture they love - so it's hard to take it at face value. 

But seeing my dad of all people get so into it was definitely a surprise. And it's my DAD! This is just too weird and waaay too funny. I bet $20 that he's going as a rasta dude for halloween this year.

Naturally I had to regale you with this anecdote, entwives. Definitely a jaw-dropper for me.

1362608723.0	19sy54	I got stuck by a dirty needle at work. :(	wicksa	60	0	39	"I am an RN, and the other morning at work I was drawing some blood and accidentally stuck myself with the needle when i pulled it out. I immediately felt overwhelming panic, ran to my charge nurse with tears in my eyes and started the protocol. I had to go down to the ER, get some tubes of blood drawn, some ""counseling"", and I was offered antiretrovirals to prevent HIV. The patient was rapid tested for HIV and was negative so I declined. (you have to take those drugs for at least 30 days and they make you sick as a dog. the patient had no risk factors and the Dr. even said they werent necessary.)

My number one fear is that I contracted some kind of disease (especially Hep C!), but I havent recieved a call yet, and its been three days, so I am hoping no news is good news.

My number two fear is that I smoke weed a few times a week. It helps me unwind from a stressful shift, helps with my insomnia, and is the only thing that relieves these headaches I often get. 

I never, ever go to work high. I work night shift and wont even smoke in the morning/during the day before I go to work. I take my job very seriously and wouldnt want to jeopardize anyone's safety. 

What I am worried about is, they took about 8 tubes of blood. I know they tested me for HIV, Hep A/b/c, but I am not sure what else. I am scared that I may have been drug tested. It is common to be drug tested after injuring oneself, but I wasnt told I was being drug tested. Normally they urine test for such a thing, but I wonder if one of those tubes could have been for a drug screen.

its driving me nuts. i could lose my job, my licence, everything! where would i work? what would i do with my life? 

i am just hoping that the fact that they havent called me since is a good sign. a drug screen is ready within a few hours max, so if they found something, youd think theyd call me right away and say ""FIRED!"". But-- I havent worked since then either, I go in on thursday night, and part of me is scared they are going to greet me when i get there and tell me to clean out my locker. :( I am too scared to call and get mine and the patients results of the disease screening because of this.

help! anyone been through a similar situation? i have been so stressed out the past couple days, its killing me!

**TLDR** got stuck with a dirty needle at work, got tests done, afraid they drug tested. also afraid im now going to die of a terrible disease.

I saw all the lines that made up everything, and I saw what those lines were made of when I got close enough to them. I also saw forests surrounding me and my frients every time we would cuddle or touch. All but one of my frients took acid last night. The other one ate mushrooms with me. It was all so beautiful and splendid. When it got a little scary, my best frient gave me reality checks. He and I had a very special and beautiful time tripping together.

We're all set.

Except I lost my job today. I was making $9.50/hr at a call center, and I was REALLY good at my job. I felt really secure and enjoyed it there. However, they did a huge layoff of around 200 people today, and I was one of those people.

It's been hard on the family fronts since we've decided to move in. My parents are as supportive as can be expected, but really don't have a lot of money or means to help us out. His Mom hasn't been as receptive to the idea. But today, when I stopped by to let him know the news, although she was a little condescending at first, she came outside and talked to me about a vacant position at the school she works at, and even contacted the principal and gave me a glowing reference. I'm putting in my application tonight, as they'll be doing interviewing next week.

I'm terrified. We have a mattress, $600 dollars to our names, and 3 weeks to get moved and somehow survive the next month. I have my last paycheck coming next week, and I will file my taxes and get a decent-sized return check. I'm just needing good vibes so everything falls into place as I hope it will.

I live in a major metropolitan city, and usually hear this 2-3 times a week. Normally while patronizing gas stations.

Maybe that's just their 'outside' voice. Maybe if I acquiesce, it will be louder and more offensive. I certainly don't want that.

What happens then? Do I holler back?

No, seriously. Here's the plan:

1. Over the next week, take photos of your day. I know some of you wanted to do weekends and this way we can each decide what type of day we'd like to share.

2. Put 15-25ish of your photos in an imgur album (if you are worried about privacy strip the metadata before you upload them, even though imgur does this it's not a bad idea to strip them before they even get there). 

3. Next Wednesday, I'll post a thread that you can comment on with your imgur album links. *Please don't flood the front page with day in the life albums.* 

I haven't yet decided if voting should be done by upvotes or if we should do something externally so downvotes don't become an issue. What do you think?

I'm overwhelmed with the response to this so far and I am to excited to see what you babes have to share!

1326427550.0	oezi3	My dirty little secret	Stellaaaaa	64	4	68	"I really feel the need to get something off my chest, but unfortunately it's just not something that I can tell people I know personally yet. I feel like this is (hopefully) a safe place and who knows, maybe I can find some support here.

I weighed in today at 282 lbs. 

Only my doctor knows how much I really weigh and I don't want to know what people's reactions would be if I told them. This is probably the heaviest I've been in years. About 10 years ago I was almost to 290. The silver lining was that I was told that I had an underactive thyroid and was put on some medication to level it out. I lost about 20 lbs in the next 6 months and then slowly got down to 250 in the next 7 years.  In the past year I slowly started putting it back on and in the past 6 months alone I've put on 20 and finally weighed in at my current 282 at the doctor's office today. When she brought up the option of bariatric surgery (as a last resort if I'm not able to do this on my own) I almost broke down crying right there in the office, but fortunately I waited until I got home. 

I feel embarrassed and disgusted with myself. I know all of the right things to do but I'm lazy and I like food, what can I say? I hate to exercise. I'd rather sit and read a book or play video games. I love to cook and bake for myself and my friends. I like to try new restaurants and have girls' nights where we drink and get the munchies.

So here I sat most of the day since getting home from the doctor, having kicked myself all day and felt horrible about myself. And finally I decided I'd had enough. I did some research on the two top options the doctor told me about (Weight Watchers and Overeaters Anonymous) and decided to join WW on a trial basis. I've also decided to approach my weight problem the same way I quit smoking - like an addiction (since it probably is). I will take one day at a time and I will not use the occasional slip up as an excuse to do horribly for the rest of the day or to throw in the towel altogether. I really want to use this day as a turning point for me. I have known people that have gone through that surgery and it was a horrible experience for them that they've never really recovered from.

So that's my secret. If anyone is on WW and wants a buddy or even if you aren't and would like to buddy up, I would love some company along my new journey.

I'm going to go drink some water now. :P"	t5_2s7a6	True

1314209096.0	jt3jd	I've waited for today since December		60	3	17	"It's been a hard year. Within one month I was inexplicably fired, left by my fiancé, and stranded after my car broke down. I was also commuting an hour to school 4 days a week in the early mornings, before transit was available. I ended up failing some classes and my graduation was delayed - transportation was a huge issue in my absenteeism and I struggled with depression through the rest of my program. I was finally able to get unemployment, but looking for work without a vehicle was tough in my area; busses didn't come anywhere near my apartment. I spent months dime-to-dime, borrowing little bits of money here and there for the occasional bill inflation. My now live-in ent would help me out as much as he could, which was more than I could ask for. It's tough for me to accept help let alone express need for it. Before I knew it I was packing up and moving into a cheap four bedroom house with four other people who had already lived there for 2 years, none of whom I knew. Good ol' craigslist. I am incredibly grateful that my situation was as mild as it was though; I don't have kids, no one depended on me to make ends meet, if anything happened it affected me and only me. I have great sympathy for those in worse situations and will do more in the future to be sensitive and helpful toward others who are having a rough go.

So I finally made it through my courses and graduated. I scheduled my licensing exams. I pored over text for months. I passed and got my license. I moved in with my ent and I got the first job I interviewed for. Today's my first day! It's also my last day on the lease at my craigslist house. From here, I'll go to the house to finish cleaning, then come home and shower, get on the bus, and start my career. Wish me luck guys ;)

Today when I returned to work, I offered to take the garbages for my boss since he had a lot to do still after the lunch rush. When I turned the corner, there was an old man sprawled on the ground in front of the door(which is beside the mens room) with about 4 people gathered around. I sprung into action and immediately got someone to call 911 and checked his pupil reaction/breathing/pulse, kept asking questions though he was unresponsive. Got him on his side and timed his heart beats and breaths while waiting for the paramedics.

Not to mention I did all this at a {5]. I just wanted to share my good deed because I am so proud that I kept my head and potentially saved this man's life. :)

In October a friend and I started the first Hempology 101 Society chapter in Alberta at Medicine Hat College. I'm not sure how to put it into words, but all my life I've felt like I'm supposed to change something about the world. Ever since I was a kid all I really wanted to be was an activist. I admired the people I saw in the newspaper doing something about injustices. I'm just now realizing that it's turning into a reality for me instead of constantly telling myself it's just a pipe dream.

The friend who helped me start the club invited his ""cool friend"" to join when we first started up. He became the secretary, then my boyfriend. We moved in together after Christmas. He's my pot prince. He plays in a band, he pitched the idea of a 4/20 concert.

What started out as a plan for a little concert on 4/20 (our very conservative city's first 4/20 event in years) has turned into a gigantic multi-genre benefit concert with sponsors coming out of the woodwork.

My favourite local punk band has agreed to make our show, in our crappy little city, their 10 year reunion concert. I used to go to every one of their shows without fail. I used to be moshing in the crowd idolizing them in junior high, now I'm talking to them like an events director while I try to hold in my fangirl squeak..

Today we got a call that there was a shipment for us at the post office... What the hell could it be? Donations and donations and donations! Thank you gifts for bands, door prizes, t-shirts, coffee mugs, buttons, hats! We've gotten so much more support than I ever imagined! Even my mom, who doesn't entirely belive in the cause, is donating some of her homemade crafts to hand out because ""they have hemp string and hippies like that stuff"". My mother... My mother who just last summer threw a shitfit upon learning I toke.

I finally feel like I'm helping. Even if it's just the fact that I'm finally giving the cannabis enthusiasts of Medicine Hat, AB their first 4/20 since the ""crackdown"" on drugs and the hiring of practically more police than we have people.

The forms are filled out, the i's are dotted, the t's are crossed, everything is legal as fuck. T- 15 days and counting.

[Here](http://m.facebook.com/events/419095878170816) is the link to the Facebook event page if anyone would like to check it out. I'm proud of this, chillin at a solid [8], and I want to shout it from the rooftops that I will help legalize this amazing plant if it's the last thing I do.

Tl;dr: I organized a 4/20 event in a town that has practically become a police state and met the perfect Ent in the process. I'm helping! :D

he ws 30 years old. my only sibling, and honestly, my world. there were signs leading up to it, and even a failed attempt. I live 3000 miles away from him and my parents, and was never told any of this was going on.
my parents found him on the floor of the bathroom. he had killed himself by overdosing on heroin, that he incidentally got from my parents fucking next door neighbor. i have his phone. he had reached out at 3 am to the neighbor. asking for help, wondering why he just wanted to die, the neighbor threw a newport pack over the fence, with heroin, and needles. (all of this was in the phone, and the box and needle was next to him) cops dont care and dont feel like the dude is at fault.
im broken. im going through the motions but nothing means much. i hate watching my kids play together bc it reminds me of us. ive tried therapy, counseling, group therapy... nothing works. no one gets it. i mention the word suicide and people seem to shut off. my husband wont talk to me about him. hes hurt i guess and doesnt know how to deal. i blame my mother. she let him die. as a mother myself, if my child ever said things like he did, for example my mother would say, as always. ""goodnight john boy"", and she said he would reply with ""i hope i never wake up"" i dont care if hes 13 or 30. id hog time him and take him to every inpatient clinic i can find until someone took him in. she didnt. she turned a blind eye.
and a week before he died? when he called his best friend, to say goodbye, because he had shot up 17 bags of junk in a rite aid bathroom. she found him and saved him. my mom didnt even tell me, or really do anything.
i dont know what to do. im destroyed, my family is destroyed, and ive never in my life felt so alone.... 
i just dont know how to get back to myself. if that can even happen....

EDIT: wow. i am floored by the outpouring of love. Thank you ladies. I truly have gotten more love and more comfort in 2 days from you, then i have anywhere else in the three months hes been gone. the depth of my gratitude can not even be expressed. thank you. and thank you mods..as silly as it is a little flair goes a long way. thank you from the bottom of my broken heart."	t5_2s7a6	True
1357553352.0	1643t8	What was your most awkward high moment?	andstuff	63	7	68	"Hi ladies! Tell me about your most awkward moment while high! Sorry for the wall of text. Mine's long! TLDR at the bottom :)

It was the first time I smoked during college (after not having smoked for years :P). I was at my best friend's Roxy's apartment, and she had a guy over who had some trees. I'm a relatively socially anxious person, so I was already nervous about meeting someone new. Roxy then tells him that I had been wanting to smoke for a while, so he pulls out a bowl and packs it. I had never even used one before, so I was super nervous about that. He had to light it/hold it for me and tell me what to do...So embarrassing for me! And then I ended up hacking because I had inhaled too much -- but I did get hilariously high from it. 

We talked in the kitchen for a while, and I was laughing at EVERYTHING. This made me more nervous which made me laugh even more...It was a ridiculous cycle. Roxy and the boy decided to put a movie on, and left me where I had been sitting on the kitchen counter top to deal with my uncontrollable laughter. By myself!

I somehow got myself onto the ground, and from there, I was literally ROFLing. My nervous laughter escalated once I realized I was the third wheel to Roxy and her boy's hang out. Occasionally during my ROFL-session I would send out a text message telling someone I was dying of laughter. It really felt like it! 

I started to get cold (which happens to me anytime I get high), stopped laughing, and decided I should seek warmth. I awkwardly army crawled to Roxy's closest where I passed out.

After a while, Roxy woke me up to kick me out into the living room so she and the boy could have sexy times. I was too high to comprehend this, and didn't want to move...probably making it especially awkward to her, lol. Eventually, they got me to the couch with a blanket and I slept soundly for the night. :P  

**TLDR; I was the awkward third wheel, was so high that I couldn't stop laughing, and almost cockblocked my friend. :P**

Chillface	60	5	22	"So, pretty good response on the interest post, and since the lovely metaljellyfish who organized the xmas exchange can't do it this time (btw if you haven't seen [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/xt55e/help_your_mod_out_i_think_i_need_reminding_on_how/) send metaljellyfish some good vibes!), I'll be organizing the matching.  Those of you who remember the xmas exchange probably remember how annoying Elfster was, and that the general conclusion was to avoid it in the future, so I'll be doing the actual matching.  Because of this, I promise to not share anyone's address or real name or anything except with their match.  Once the exchange is over, all the information will be deleted.  Essentially, I will respect your privacy.  Here are the exchange deets:

Dates:

Signup: Now until August 30 (may be extended if necessary)

Matching: September 1st

Must Ship By: October 1st

To Sign up:
PM me with your address (and real name if you are comfortable with sharing it and/or need it to receive packages, otherwise it will be shipped with your reddit name), description to help your match with picking out a decor item for your home, and whether or not you can decorate with tree-related items.  

International Shipping:
Our lovely community is mostly in the States, but we have more than a few ladies from Canada and abroad, so there's a real chance of being matched with an international address.  It can cost more to ship this way, so please indicate if you want a domestic address (this goes for everyone, not just Americans).  I will try to do my best, but you still might get an international address.  Also remember that it might be totally rad to ship internationally, and if you want to, please indicate that as well.

What Qualifies As Decor:
Posters, wall hangings, knick-knacks, rugs, magnets, art, mirrors, lamps, throw pillows, candles &amp; candle holders, imagine Pier 1 if it was a head shop... Things can have a use, but should be intended primarily for decor.  Be CREATIVE.  I'm pretty sure all of us can agree on what qualifies but just in case.  

As with earlier exchanges, please keep your gift around $20.  Keep in mind the cost of shipping what you pick out.  Given the nature of this exchange, it will be easy to keep within the price range and then spend twice the amount on shipping.

Please feel free to ask any questions or make any criticisms (constructive, please!), it's early so changes can easily be made if needed.  Also if anyone would like to help me match, that would be great.  Currently, I cannot participate in the exchange because it would not be fair to add myself since I would know who has me (and how awkward would it be to send my match my info and tell them to send me something!).  I am totally willing to sit this out to be able to have the exchange for Entwives, but it would be nice to gift and get gifted too :)

I love how Quentin Tarantino portrays female heroins (for lack of a better work). He makes them kick ass to the max, but at the same time makes them believable girls. A perfect example of this is when they crash and Zoe flys off the hood, they are all crying and freaking the fuck out, cause I know that's what I would be doing. Opposed to the regular 'Tomb Raider' style of female heroins who would be calm and collected the entire time. 

Kill Bill has several very soft 'real female' moments to contrast her killer assassin career (ie, the pregnancy test scene, when the kid comes in on the knife fight)

That being said, I love entwives. I love that we can post about anything, weed-related/female-related or not at all. I love everyone's attitude and warmth towards each other. But I think we can all agree it can get a little slow in here. I love seeing what you ladies have to share, regardless of the content! I'd love to hear from you more often!

We always comment when someone does make a post, so I know we're all here. Maybe we can all be a little bit more active?

1325719216.0	o35hk	I'm changing my life and I feel great!	ellydee	58	5	8	"Grrls,

Between breaking up with my boyfriend of 4 years close to the holidays and trying to decide what types of pharmacy rotations I want next year to complete my doctorate program, I’ve been a leeeeettle stressed. I felt like the biggest disaster during the last few months of my relationship and just didn’t feel like myself at all. Today, for the first time in a very long time, I feel like everything is falling into place. I am shooting for two big, exotic rotations in Hawaii and Alaska and my family has been extremely (and unusually) supportive—I got luggage for Christmas! I also reassessed my plans a little bit and decided to spend two rotations at home so I save money, work, and (most importantly) spend more time with everyone I love. I will ultimately spend 6 months travelling and 6 months at home.

I’m finally doing this! I feel in control of my life, and things are getting better every day :) I feel like myself again and I kinda love being independent and knowing I am responsible for choosing my life’s direction. Tonight I’m off to my cousin’s house to make a delicious dinner and relax knowing everything is going to be amazing."	t5_2s7a6	True

I also smoke but generally only in the evenings and it might be good to note that my tolerance is much lower than his. I want to clarify that I do not have a problem with him smoking at all!  And I don't want to put limitations or controls on him or his usage and be ""that wife"", but at the same time, I've realized that I don't really remember the man he is sober because he is high 24/7.  Don't get me wrong, he's an awesome and fun guy but he goes through (lately) about a 1/2 every week or so which is also a hit to the finances too.  I want to talk to him about it but I don't know how. They say weed is not addictive but for him it absolutely is and I guess I'm worried for him.  What do you ladies think?

So I'm in the market for a new childcare provider, and I was thinking to myself that it would be nice to have someone living with us to watch the sapling while we're at work and help out around the house. In return, we'd cover room &amp; board (house, utilities, food, internets, netflix, transportation maybe?, cell phone maybe?) and provide a small weekly stipend for whatever personal expenses are left over (trees?? haha).

I thought this might be an interesting option for someone wanting to break into the professional nanny world (we could be your first reference!), someone wanting to pursue personal interests while making ends meet (aspiring artist?), a single mama looking for some extra hands (want to take night classes? No problem, I'll watch your kiddo), or someone just wanting to do something/go somewhere different for a while.

We are super laid-back people and have just the one 18-month-old boy. Is anybody else out there looking to do something ""different"" for a while? Or have a (trustworthy!) friend/relative looking for a fresh start somewhere? I'm pretty open to creating a collaborative partnership, if this sounds interesting to you hit me up and let's see if we mesh. :)

1352673097.0	13137m	Anyone else need a friend?	akillertofu	56	6	42	"Hey there, ladies. I have a bit of a story to tell, but I understand completely if you don't want to wade through the entire thing, so I've included a TL;DR, don't worry!

About a year and a half ago, I told my right-wing, Christian mother that I am an Atheist. I admitted that I don't believe in the whole ""Jesus thing,"" that going to church was sort of like story time for me, and that all my Christian friends seemed like they were taking some really powerful drug I wasn't on. She cried. She prayed (of course). She took me to therapy. And then she kicked me out of the house.

Around the same time, she found out I smoke, which didn't help the situation. I got into a serious relationship with my (now) fiance, and I think she was scared she was losing me. I'm not mad anymore, but it was a really tough time between my family and me. My parents sold my cello behind my back. It sucked. Things were said that shouldn't have been. We've since made up.

Soon, though, my heathenism leaked out to my (then) friends, and one by one, they stopped communicating with me. I felt like, one by one, they were breaking up with me. Each time was seriously, *seriously* fucking shitty. But my then boyfriend, now fiance helped me realize that if they weren't willing to love me for who I actually am, rather than who they thought I was, maybe I didn't want them in my life anyway.

That said, I'm down quite a few friends, entwives. I was wondering if any of you guys are in similar situations, or even if any of you all would like an extra friend. Don't get me wrong, my ent is a wonderful, wonderful friend... but sometimes I just need a *girl*friend, you know? :) I'm 25/f, from Dallas, Texas, vegan, work in the mortgage industry... and I'm really hoping I'm not as boring as I sound, although I suspect that is the case. :P I've recently really gotten into hip hop (Scroobius Pip, Sage Franics, P.O.S, Eyedea, etc.), and I really love old school rap. Jason Mraz miiight be my imaginary boyfriend (shhh, that's a secret!) oh, and Tristan Prettyman is amazing, too. I fucking love reading... *Lord of the Rings* is my favorite book, but I'll read anything. Oh, huuuuge fan of tattoos. Before I ramble your ear off, I'll just add, send me a message if you're interested! I'm pretty pumped about some new potential entwife friends!

**TL;DR** Lost all old friends after admitting I'm atheist, and would love a few new entwife buddies. :)

His gf is also my best gf and she and I have really awesome times together, whether it's smoking and watching X-Files and Game of Thrones and pigging out all day, or shopping together (we're slowly cutefying our apartment), drinking with her mom or getting our hair did. Yesterday I spent all day at her job with her, driving around in a golf cart and having a laugh, and after that we grabbed another of our girlies and checked out this truly adorable convenience store that also sells a lot of anime figurines and cute Japanese things: pins, magnets, hair stuff, bags, stickers, stationery, etc. The owner even let us have a go in the photo booth for free! I may have to wave good bye to at least one pay check there.

But yeah, I've just been having a really fun time with my girl lately, and wanted to share. I hope all you entwives out there have someone you can share with, doesn't always have to be another entwife, just so long as you have fun and take care of each other. &lt;3

1362527225.0	19qnnn	My exEnt , future fiancé, baby momma wants me to quit.	ParEntsWish	61	12	69	"So I have been with my beautiful girlfriend for over 5 wonderful years. When we met one of the first texts she sent me the night after we exchanged numbers on a night out, said she had a 2 year old from a previous relationship. I was still in uni so I guess she thought I may have a problem with that, I immediately replied saying I would love to meet her and we could all watch some of my vast collection of Disney films together. I did not have a problem. 
 
I text her after saying that smoked weed and hoped that wouldn't be a problem, she replied she was currently high.... and would later tell me she was a bit of a wild child before she had the lil'u... I knew she was the one.

Every night I went round to hers for the next few months I would bring some green and we would get high together, all was good.

I would go round during the day too, and we would all have fun together, then come night fall when the little'un was in bed me and my EntGirl would get baked and have a magical time. 

I moved in to her flat about 8 months after I met her, started working and soon left uni. And around 2 years into our relationship we feel pregnant. She immediately stopped smoking when we found out, I stopped for a while then started going out and walking around the block to smoke mine. That was OK, I'd brush my teeth and freshen up before I got back to her as she couldn't stand the smell of smoke when pregnant. When we got closer to the birth I stopped smoking and we had the most beautifully perfect baby I have ever seen. 

After a few months I started smoking again, she did not, as she was breast feeding and she was quite proud that she quit smoking green/tobacco too. I would smoke only a little every now and then, then went back to smoking every night. She wanted me to quit, I did not. We carried on. After nearly a year and a half we feel pregnant again (all that shit about green=low sperm count is bull shit) and moved house a nice big house with a massive garden.

We had another perfect little baby. Same pattern, I stopped and started always cleaning up after I smoked and only after the kids were in bed (apart from when Lil baby's were around in the evening, but I wouldn't get too high [2]).

Now for financial reasons I haven't purchased any green for a while and would be given some from my brother who would occasionally visit or from a work mate who smokes also. 

I miss when would both smoke together. 

I suggested that I could grow a single plant in our garden, (after doing weeks of research unbeknownst to her) and was immediately shot down. 

I feels like this is who I am and have always been an she thinks that I should stop as she doesn't want me to be one of ""those dad's"". 

I know I can't afford to buy any more, so would like to make it a hobby (i don't drink/tobacco or watch sports down the pub like all friends/ colleagues do, and would much rather stay at home with my sweetheart and smoke a joint in the evening) to make my own in a safe secure (from prying eyes and kids) fashion. She thinks the kids will grow up and know that I smoke and steal some and smoke themselves like some people she knew when growing up. 

I don't want to just stop, and feel so guilty everytime I do smoke that I don't enjoy it as much. I just wish she accepted me for who I always have been. I want to marry this beautiful woman one day soon but am worried this will always be a problem, If I stop or not. I love all 4 of them (26 year old, 8 year old, 2 year old, 4 month old) more than anything in the world and don't want to lose them. I just want to keep a little bit of me too. 

I feels snappy and argumentative when I don't smoke for a while and know in my head I'm a better calmer dad if I know I have a joint to wind down to when I've finished my day at work and got the kids to bed. 

Can I have some guidance oh wise EntWives....

Please uptoke, even if you don't agree with me, just so I can get more feedback. Thank you."	t5_2s7a6	True

I am strictly a lurker and hardly post anything but I love you guys with all my heart. I had to quit smoking trees due to a drug test for a kickass job, hence the [0]

I just said goodbye to my Ent, my friend and my lover that I've been with since Halloween '10. He is moving across the country for a better job. I am so excited for him but it hurts to have to say goodbye. It sounds stupid but he had such an impact on my life and how I view relationships. 

The relationship we had was something one could only dream of having. He's much older then me and the sex was passionate and intense. The weed we smoked was dank and fresh. The times we had were memorable and some of the best times I've had. We never fought and always adored and respected each other. We were never together, we both have busy lifestyles and separate lives but always made time to intertwine them. We both confessed tonight after a last round of amazing sex how we have both had many partners but we were by far each others best and no one could fuck each other like we could. He was never one for mushy stuff but he said the most beautiful thing to me. And I quote ""I was talking to Mike about you, and we never really talk about this stuff but I couldn't stop talking about you and how beautiful your smile is. I've kissed many girls in my life and If every girl could have a smile like yours I could die happy"". I started to tear up and we both laughed about it and then he ends it jokingly with ""Especially when you're sucking my dick, goddamn girl"" and I just rolled over in pain from laughter. That's the kind of relationship we had.

I just want to say to cherish those who you have in your life right now. Embrace them and indulge in the moments spent with them, take risks with them and never forget to stop and feel what you are actually feeling in the moment. Don't get caught up in the motions and be passionate about everyone you are with and everything you do. It will make life that much better. 


I never cry over guys because they come and go but he was special. I hope one day to cross paths with him again.

I'm not really sure where else to talk about this. I know there's other subreddits I could put it in but usually when I think of support, I think of all of you. 

I had already planned the next post I was going to put on here. It was going to be about how I had gotten a new job (wishful thinking, but I can dream) and that I could join you around our virtual table. I planned on doing this soon, as I have an interview in a few hours that I have a good feeling about.

But last night, my life came *this* close to changing forever. My boyfriend was out with some friends on their bikes and I got the call from his step father and then another one from one of the guys he was with that he had gone down. They were going pretty fast and he went to stop and his wheels locked up and he hit one of the other bikes that was with him. He's pretty beaten up but (and I am so very grateful for this) he is okay. He will not be able to drive his precious car, and he has promised he will never lay a hand on a motorcycle again, but he is okay.

He's having surgery today because his leg is broken, and his foot is in pretty rough shape so they might have to do two surgeries.

So now I have to go to this interview knowing that he is in pain. I would have rescheduled but he's going to be out of work for awhile and our insurance is going to go up and I'm going to need a better income to take care of us.

His family and our friends are insanely supportive, but they have their own concerns about the situation. So ladies, if you have some extra internet hugs to send up my way, I will gladly accept them.


EDIT:
My best friend works at the store where I had the interview and he told the store manager what happened, and she texted me to reschedule the interview for next week. I was really determined to go through with it, but he's a worrywart and now I can get to the hospital sooner.


UPDATE:
I've been at the hospital now for about 5 hours, and I've only gotten to see my honey for about 30 seconds. He is out of surgery, he was knocked out pretty bad for awhile (stopped breathing on his own) but I saw him maybe an hour ago and he was awake and sitting up and talking. Now we're just waiting for them to move him to an actual room so we can go be with him. If they'll let me, I plan on staying in the hospital with him tonight.

ANOTHER UPDATE:
Right after I posted the last update, they finally came in and told us he had been moved to a room. He's sleeping now, and he definitely needs it (he's been really cranky because he kept trying to sleep but then they'd come in and mess with his leg- all necessary, but he's exhausted). So his dad and I are sitting in the room waiting for the rest of the family or for him to wake up. He can sleep for the rest of the day if that's what he needs, but at least when he wakes up this time, I'll be the first face he sees. Ah! And he just woke up! Hug time, ladies thank you so much.

UPDATE:
This post is getting kind of long, so I put up a new one to update his progress [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/1dohx4/update_my_boyfriend_is_doing_better/)"	t5_2s7a6	True

1336190626.0	t7xpq	I had the worst night of my life last night &amp; need to vent. Any other ladies experience a really bad miscarriage?	1triangle	61	9	15	2 weeks ago I went to my ultrasound to verify my pregnancy, and the doctor couldn't find a heartbeat. The next day the severe cramping began, but I didn't start bleeding. This continued until yesterday, when the heavy heavy bleeding began. I bled more in one day than I did in 3 days with my last miscarriage. I fainted in front of my door and my fiance came home from work an hour later to me laying in a pool of blood, physically unable to get myself up. Luckily, we live right across the street from a hospital and they took care of me. I was pale and was covered in cold sweat, so they did the IV thing and gave me morphine to ease the pain. Then another doctor came in and pulled out the placenta, which was the worst pain i've ever felt in my life. After that I got more morphine and was moved up to my room. They drew blood almost every hour so I basically got no sleep, but i wasn't mad because that's what they gotta do. After my ultrasound the next morning I was (finally!!) able to eat ice chips, then a glass of water and finally, breakfast. My fiance brought the baby to the hospital to pick me up, and I was finally released at 11am. I moved to Wisconsin from California and have no family or friends out here, so the feeling of being stranded on the floor with nobody to help right then was pretty scary. Today I have a whole new appreciation for life. Thanks for letting me vent, it's been bothering me for a while today :)	t5_2s7a6	True

After no success trying to fall back asleep, i got up and checked my email, reddit etc. I went to my academic advising page to check on my transfer credits, and I was shocked when i saw they had all been applied. Not only that, but I ONLY HAVE 16 CREDITS STANDING BETWEEN MYSELF AND THAT SWEET SWEET DIPLOMA! I graduate 12/15/12 after lots of struggles and frustration with school. I have finally gotten back on track, getting a 4.0 last semester and getting back into my university (Indiana University, hoosier pride!!!), i'm kicking school's ass once again and it feels so good!

so early morning tokes to you ladies, today is gonna be a good one :)"	t5_2s7a6	True

NailPolishIsWet	57	11	41	"I know the world is unfair, and we all (well, most of us) wish things were different, but I don't come to reddit for the rants, I come for the lawls. Lately, 2x just seems more whiny and ""omg I wish it wasn't this way"" than it is enlightening or any kind of arena for sharing. 

And yes, I realize there's something hypocritical in me ranting about being tired of the rants. 

Posted in r/entwives because I love you way more than 2X. Don't ever change. 

Edit: I'm at work but want to respond to everyone who's commented so far. I'm not the type to bitch n moan about something without being open to a change of attitude or perspective. Discussion without name calling and insults is welcome!"	t5_2s7a6	True
