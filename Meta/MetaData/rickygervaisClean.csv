 I love Ricky, Stephen, and Karl (especially Karl).  I need to listen to them before I go to sleep.  It is part of my daily routine to laugh at them and just forget about all my troubles.  

Sometimes it is the general stress of my every day life.  Other times I just need to escape all the aggravating and depressing news that is going on in the world.  

So the only way I know I would get a good night sleep is that I can just listen to these guys.  When I do listen, things just do not seem so hard or complicated.

Since then, I've started this little project which will basically do this automatically. This may seem impossible, but with a little help, I believe we can go a long way. 

So far I've coded a script which downloads every single transcript of the XFM recordings and then proceeds to parse out all the songs. It looks like only some seasons include these in-depth transcripts (from Pilkiepedia.com, they deserve all the credit). 

If you feel like you could help out in any way, please respond in this thread. I'm going to have to read up on quite a bit of audio analyzing, so if you have any prior knowledge, please let me know. 

So far the script has worked out pretty well. Check out the parsed transcripts:
[Season 1](https://raw.github.com/gist/3206965/f2b23e25c375dfc3798ef6d1c49ef576ffc7d280/season_1)


If you would like to check out the source code, feel free. Just keep in mind it's ugly. https://gist.github.com/3206983

The next step in this project is to use the Spotify Metadata API to get all the proper links. I don't want to get a cease and desist letter telling me I can't edit them back in to the audio and then host them, so I have to think about how I'm going to get around that. 

Anyways, stay tuned. I'll update this thread as I progress."	t5_2rlm2	True

Sorry for delay in choosing the winnners. Part of the reason was being swamped by work but the main reason I took so long was because it's almost impossible. So many good quotes to pick from. A few commenters even mentieoned how impossible this task was!

In the end I went with two that surprised me or made me laugh thinking about them. Some classics were posted which I love but because I've heard them so many times they made me smile instead of actually laugh really hard so I'm going with a couple that might not be the ones others would instantly think of but absolutely classic pilkoid bollocks!

Winner #1 is TheRunawayState with ""When you're a kid, I remember really loving going to bed. There was this one time I actually laughed myself to sleep, 'cos I couldn't believe my luck."" [[link](http://youtu.be/NasYJ6DRawY?t=26m)] 

For some reason the mental image of Karl laughing in bed is hilarious but laughing because he ""couldn't believe my luck"" is just ridiculous. I'm still laughing thinking about it!

Winner #2 jonesey46 with the Christmas Blockbusters [[link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuKAgOhPUpo)]

Perhaps jonesey had an advantage because I'd somehow managed to miss this clip in the past so it was totally fresh but I think it's a totally deserving winner because... well because it just combines classic rockbusters bollocks with the christmas asburdity. All the swearing on air near the end cracks me up too.

Well done to both winners, PM me for your address details and I'll send out the prizes ASAP.

Cheers to everybody for taking part. There were tons of amazing choices and it was really hard to pick just two but there we go. It's done! Monkey backing out of the bank, kicking a duck up the arse and Karl critiquing Descartes were soooo close but in the end were just pipped at the post. Peace out!

**EDIT 2: COMPETITION NOW OVER. NO MORE QUOTES PLEASE. I shall be announcing winners today or tomorrow on this page. Winners will also be notified via private message :)**

Hey Pilko fans!

For reasons that I don't need to go into I have two spare copies of [this product](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/KARL-PILKINGTON-SIGNED-PHOTO-PRINT-AUTOGRAPH-POSTER-GIFT-STEPHEN-MERCHANT-/320894554076?pt=UK_DVD_Film_TV_Autographs_CV&amp;hash=item4ab6ce4fdc#ht_1423wt_1396) which sells on eBay for £5.99. It's basically a glossy 12x8"" professionally printed photograph of the round headed twonk with a replica of his autograph on it. They actually look really cool, I have mine framed but I've got two spare and I want to give them away to anybody who wants them.

I will send them out at my own expense so I'm guessing more than 2 people will want to take me up on this offer. Therefore I thought it would be fun to create a little competition.

We all have our favourite Pilkington quotes but the winners of this competition are going to be the two people who post the quotes that make me laugh the most when I read them! If two people post the same quote then it'll be the person who posted first who will win. I will edit this post tomorrow announcing the winners and will send a private message to the two users for address details.

So who wants a head like a fucking orange in the post for free? AWAY YOU GO! MAKE ME LAUGH :)

Edit: Feel free to also include a link to the youtube video (if avilable) of him actually saying your chosen quote. Especially if you feel like most of the comedy is in the delivery.

&gt;Oh, and good luck to James Franco and Anne Hathaway at The Oscars on Sunday. I know how nervous they must be right now.
&gt;
&gt;They will do an absolutely fantastic job and don't need my help, but I've written a little opening in case they have a few minutes to fill. 
&gt;
&gt;  	(Drum roll) 
&gt;
&gt;V.O.
&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen.
&gt;Please welcome your hosts for this evening...
&gt;James Franco and Anne Hathaway
&gt;
&gt;(Music and applause)
&gt;(James and Anne walk out looking absolutely perfect)
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Hello and welcome to The 83rd Academy Awards,
&gt;Live from Los Angeles.
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;That's foreign for City of Angels.
&gt;And this room is certainly filled will those angels.
&gt;
&gt;(Applause)
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Thank you. I'm James Franco.
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;...and I'm Anne Hathaway.
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;You probably know me from 127 Hours where I play a man trapped in an enclosed space who decides he would rather cut his own arm off than stay where he was. Now that sounds ""way out"" but wait till half way through this fucking ceremony and you'll start to identify with him. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;And I'm the new Catwoman. The first white woman to play that role since Michelle Pfeiffer. I want it to be an inspiration to all white people everywhere. Your dreams can come true in Hollywood too. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;It's a daunting task hosting The Oscars but we're not alone. Presenting awards tonight will be a string of Hollywood legends and some other actors who have a film out in March or April. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Usually they hire comedians to host The Oscars, but tonight, instead, you get us! 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;No comedians tonight. And do you know why? Because comics are ugly. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Especially that rude obnoxious one who played the Steve Carell part in the English remake of The Office. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;But you can all relax because Ricky Gervais is in London...
&gt;
&gt;(Nervous laughter) 
&gt;
&gt;He's doing some charity work.
&gt;Yeah, he's visiting orphans with cancer. 
&gt;He's telling them what bald little losers they are... 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Yeah, cos he's rude right?
&gt;
&gt;(Applause)
&gt;
&gt;Thank you.
&gt;No rudeness tonight.
&gt;It's going to be a night of the most privileged people in the world being told how brilliant they are and thanking God for loving them more than ugly poor foreigners.
&gt;
&gt;(Applause)
&gt;
&gt;That's not to say that we don't care. No, apart from all the great movies we made this year we continued our life-saving philanthropy. Mega stars like Angelina Jolie, George Clooney and Ben Stiller brought light to third world poverty and famine and shocked the world with visions of children so hungry they'd been living off dead beetles all their lives. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Yeah and Yoko Ono said. ""What's wrong with that?""
&gt;
&gt;(Laughter)
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Oh Anne you are naughty. In a respectful, wholesome way.
&gt;
&gt;(Nodding and smiling)
&gt;
&gt;That Ricky Gervais should do more for charity.
&gt;
&gt;(Murmurs of agreement)
&gt;
&gt;Ricky Gervais is now worth $80,000,000. The obnoxious Brit confirmed the figure, adding,""Yes and my dentist hasn't seen a penny."" 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Yeah, why doesn't he get his teeth straightened and bleached like everyone else in Hollywood? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;It's a good question Anne. For the same reason he doesn't have botox or suck up to important producers - there's something wrong with him. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;There must be. Why isn't the stocky, fangy, little slob more like us, right? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;That ugly dude needs to get a Hollywood makeover, big time. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Quite. And even though most of the actresses here have eating disorders, that's better than being fat right? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;You bet it is gorgeous. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;You are so handsome. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Exactly.
&gt;You know Ricky Gervais used to be bulimic. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Really?
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Yes. He'd often gorge himself for hours with cheese and cakes.
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;And then vomit right? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;No he left that bit out...
&gt;
&gt;(Mild laughter) 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;That's because he couldn't get his fat fucking fingers in his stupid mouth.
&gt;
&gt;(Big laugh) 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Anyway let's get this show on the road.
&gt;There were some great kids' movies this year.
&gt;I took a five year old to see Toy Story 3 last week. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Did you enjoy it? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;No it was ruined for me because the little brat was screaming and crying all the way through the film saying, ""Who are you?"" ""You're not my daddy."" ""Take me back to the park where you grabbed me...""
&gt;
&gt;(Laughter)
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Oh James, you are a card. And your slightly risky jokes are not threatening because you're one of us. And you are so handsome. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Absolutely.
&gt;So let's get this show on the road.
&gt;Our first presenter is a Hollywood legend whose boots Ricky Gervais would not be fit to kiss...
&gt;The wonderful...
&gt;Mel Gibson...
&gt;
&gt;(Standing ovation)
&gt;
&gt;

Cubejam	23	9	13	"I'm assuming we've all heard Rockbusters &amp; its absolute brilliance, so why don't we continue where Karl left off and introduce a weekly rockbuster for our amusement. If you don't know, the answer is a band or an artist &amp; you get a little story or clue with the initial of the artist.

Previous Pilkington Rockbusters included: 

A woman fell over in Texas and got her leg wet - **Wet, knee, Houston**

Exploding pet - **Atomic Kitten**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here's mine for the week, intentionally as bad as Pilkingtons of course.

A fella saw the most beautiful girl in the world, he was walking along and he was absolutely stunned, he stopped in his tracks and looked closer at her &amp; realised she was Kiera Knightly, he was really amazed. He was speechless.

The initial is **G**

1. Ain't No Pleasing You	(Chas and Dave)

1. In The Ghetto	(Elvis Presley)

1. Babooshka	(Kate Bush)

1. Just Can't Get Enough	(Depeche Mode)

1. Dreaming of You	(The Coral)

1. Stranger on the Shore	(Acker Bilk)

1. Mack The Knife	(Bobby Darin)

1. Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa	(Gene Pitney)

1. Distractions	(Zero 7)

1. We Used To Be Friends	(The Dandy Warhols)

1. Informer	(Snow)

1. Pinball Wizard	(The Who)

1. The Killing Of Georgie	(Rod Stewart)

1. Wonderful Tonight	(Eric Clapton)

1. Living for the City	(Stevie Wonder)

1. The Purple People Eater	(Sheb Wooley)

I thought this could be a good chance to go a little bit deeper into the K-Man's world. I've just listened to it and I think it was totally worth it.

1272736286.0	bysmk	Feedback to improve this subreddit please?	radiohead_fan123	6	0	8	"Hi everyone, 

Can you give me some feedback on how to improve this subreddit please? 

In my experience, having been a moderator on r/circlejerk since there were less than 100 subscribers, I think the key to developing a fun subreddit is fostering a sense of community - getting subscribers involved and encouraging lots of subscriptions, posts and comments. Then, after a certain stage, it kind of takes on a life of its own and doesn't need as much attention or promotion from the moderators.

So my question is: how can I best do that here? 

Does anyone want to be a mod here and help us grow this subreddit more?

We can do lots of nice css stuff, I've learned alot from ytknows, sephr and r/circlejerk, but again I don't think that would work without a strong sense of community based around it. Same with the circlejerk ""shenanigans"" - not much point without a big community behind it.

Maybe it's just a matter of time. I made a subreddit 5 months ago called [checkthisout](http://www.reddit.com/r/checkthisout/new/). 

It seems like a bit of a silly idea becuase it's a subreddit for ""content worth sharing"" but r/reddit.com does that already, on a much bigger scale.

So I totally forgot about it and didn't even visit it once until a few weeks ago when I saw it had about 300 subscribers and was getting new activity frequently, totally unmoderated. So maybe I should just leave this subreddit alone for a few months and see what happens?"	t5_2rlm2	True

Except more often than not it turns out to be the same piece of gold that keeps slipping through a hole in my pocket back into the creek I am mining! 

A few times (provided I had the money) I found myself searching for DVDs of the show, but FOR THE MOST PART it turned out that the only DVDS I could find wouldnt play on dvd players here! Such a bummer, especially because my brother would love to see it and TopGear as well it doesnt seem likely that we will get to see em soon.
