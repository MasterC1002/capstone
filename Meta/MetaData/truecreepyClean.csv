It is a feature-length remake of a PBS short film I did called ""The Hopewell Haunting"" and for anyone that wants to watch it to get an idea of this new feature remake, it is located here: http://www.vimeo.com/quickhillfilms/hopewellhaunting

If anyone thinks that Hollywood today has ruined the ghost genre with their unrealistic story lines and ridiculous plot twists, then you will love this film. This is not a found footage or voyeuristic film like what we're being subjected to today but a good old-fashioned, realistic ghost story like you would read about in a true ghost stories collection or see on Unsolved Mysteries. 

If anyone would be interested in helping me show the world what a REAL American haunting is like, I beg you to please watch the short film and visit my campaign to consider helping us out. Also note that for anyone that wants to help, you will receive an autographed copy of the film, your name on the site, credits, IMDB and receive other unique gifts. 

The campaign is located here: http://www.indiegogo.com/hopewellhaunting

Thank you all and I hope you can join me!

Nothing was wrong with the song, so I downloaded it via a website I always download music from.

I played it in Media Player, nothing wrong with the song.

But when I played it in Audacity, near the end, it cuts to a conversation held by 2 people, in which sounds like they're speaking Russian.

Here's the song, you need Audacity to listen to the chatter at the end: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l7udpac1t8a4jak/Baauer%20-%20Harlem%20Shake.mp3

1340830010.0	vpd6d	Notes of an /x/ lurker	ChristianTMI	70	25	22	"Okay let me just start off by saying I am not a paedophile, sadist, drug addict or pretty much anything BUT normal. What I am, though, is curious.

Day 1

After weeks of lurking 4chan's /x/ I have grown somewhat obsessed. The deep web. What is it? How can I see it? I need to know more. Everyday at least one thread pops up asking about it. I am dying of curiosity. I don't know if this is just some elaborate troll, a inside joke maybe? Like that shitty triforce thing. I need to know more.

I found [this](http://imgur.com/5So9h) infographic. My mouth is watering. I need to investigate more, but first I need some sleep. It's 4:56 AM and I have to work tomorrow.

Day 2

I got home from work about 5 hours ago. I have been researching it like crazy. I need to know more. I posted a thread for the first time on /x/ but got called a faggot, that was my only reply. The thread stayed on the 15th page for an hour and then 404'd.

I did some more searching around. I am going to need a program called [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). FUCK!!! WHY ISNT IT WORKING!!!!!!!fhjdsohjosdflosdghj kbjds\jkgdhs oif;\

Okay my backslash key broke but I NEED to see these pages. They have to be hidden for a reason, right!??!?!!? There mush be something amazing inside this pandora's box, right???!??

Day 3

I called in sick today. I feel bad for lying but I am so close. I haven't gone to bed yet but I know that I am so, extremely close. I just know it.

I GOT IT!! I FUCKING GOT IT. It's really quite simple... Extract the file. Make sure Vidalia is working, check for anonimity, configure configure configure configure configure configure configure configure configure configure configure, then jsut configure it as a non-exit relay and you are done. Simple. I really feel like passing out from exhaustion but i cant when I am on thee verge of a breajkthrough! It is 2:01 AM, need coffee.

Day 4

I have been trying to find underground websites for the past 7 hours now. I found this piece of shit: http://imgur.com/ACBPZ I am not stopping I WILL FIND SOMETHING!!!!

I found something worth mentioning, 19:18, http://imgur.com/oIY4R . It isnt mych but It is something. Anyone wanna buy some drugs?? LOL!! 

FUCK YES!!!!! I found the goldmine. Well metaphorically. http://imgur.com/tvvtc Not too intense but it is creepy none the less.! I cried, I literally fucking bawled when I found something remotely underground and eerie. I am so happy right now. I need sleep.

Day 5:

My boss has left me 4 voicemails. I think I am fired, I am fine with that. This is my life now. I have foudn the city of atlantis. I didn't get to sleep much last night. I kept hearing white noise and thinking of the deep web.

Breakthrough!!! I found this forum market thing: http://imgur.com/udRtO Super cool I have been reading through the threads, they are mainly about weird things people are selling,  strange craigslist esque things peoplle want others to do, etc. There was this one guy that was selling shit. SHIT, people are buying shit. Then there was this other guy that said we would record himself killing his family and sell the tape to the highest bidder, so far there were 18 people that had made a bid. The highers being $17 Mil. I was considering bidding. I don't have the money but I really wanted to see this guy kill them. This ""place' has changed me.

Day 6

This will probably be my final entry. I was rereading through yesterday's notes. What have I become. I am obsessed. I think I am done with this shit.

Day 7

I tried. I really did. I wanted to uninsteall tor. I really wanted to. But I couldn't. It was calling me. I needed to find something so sick that even I can be put off by it.

You would thing that when I find the sickest thing imagineable I would stop. I would uninstall tor and go outside.

Well I found it: http://imgur.com/DL4c3

I finally found what my, gore loving, sick, twisted, self loathing self would, in theory, be turned off by. A simple ad in a pedofiles playpen: http://imgur.com/jO14H

I really wish this would have got to me. I really do, but, I have become addicted. The boundries of what I though was acceptable have dissapeared.

As it grows we need to have a system to separate what is ""truly creepy"" from those that aren't so that we can distinguish ourselves from it. 

As such, I encourage you to report posts that you don't feel belong here and they will be removed if they do not meet the community standards. I will be doing a bit of removing if need be but at this juncture, I will be going by reporting alone. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO REPORT IT IF IT DOES NOT BELONG HERE!

Again I have stated it is subjective but we will be trying to keep a standard of things that are truly creepy and not just ""meh"" so do keep that in mind when submitting.

Enjoy your stay and remember to report if it doesn't belong here.

I also just wanted to see how everybody felt the content was on this sub. Obviously creepy is very subjective but it seems that we have a tone going here that is fairly consistently creepy.

For example, this image is currently on the front page of /r/creepy: http://i.imgur.com/FUSu2.jpg with the headline ""Interrogation Room"". But it's not an interrogation room; it's a dental chair in an dilapidated building. __But that's creepy still__ - so why give it potentially dishonest context for upvotes?

This is just one clear example I've noticed in /r/creepy today, but I've noticed many in the past. In fact, this is one of less cheesy ones. It's just something I never understood or appreciated.

Don't forget that you have the ability to keep things truly creepy by down voting and reporting posts that don't belong.

So here are a couple of questions we would like you to answer:

1. Are you currently satisfied with this subreddit and its quality?
Y/N (Reason)

2. If you could change one thing about this subreddit what would it be?

3. Are there any posts currently on the front page that you think don't belong there?

I went to the mall about 20 minutes away from my house. The shoe store isn't open just yet, so I'm walking around killing time. I find this game I used to play as a kid. I put a dollar in it and then I realize it is two dollars to play and I didn't have anymore cash. It wouldn't give me my change back so at this point I'm about to walk away then I realize this older guy(50 or 60's) is staring at me. I tell him if he has a dollar he can play it because i can't get my change back. He tells me he's never seen it played so he gave me a dollar to try. So I play and lose, from there on we started making small talk and he says my name is Gary. At this point I don't get a creepy feeling and honestly I'm not really awake so I'm just standing there talking to him. We talked for a maximum of 20 minutes about random shit. After this he asks me to go grab a beer with him and I said I wasn't 21 and  I needed to go get shoes still. He said that's no problem we can go to the liquor store and drink in his car and I could just meet him at that game after I go get shoes. I said okay and as I walked to the shoe store I got this terrible feeling that I couldn't shake maybe it was him patting me in the back a touching my shoulder, or just the look in his eyes not to mention it wasn't even noon. Instead of stopping at the shoe store I just left.	t5_2t8bu	True
