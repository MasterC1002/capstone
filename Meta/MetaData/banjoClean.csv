I know a lot of people know how to do this, but I didn't until recently and it has been an amazing help. You can slow things down to 1 note per second if you want. It really helps break down the different techniques and licks/riffs. 

Just trying to spread a small bit of knowledge I just got. I was having an extremely hard time learning by ear, basically going all off tabs. This little trick has really helped my playing a lot, and has probably doubled the speed in which I can learn a new song. "	t5_2qlrg	True

1349125295.0	10s3lo	I now own an old Gibson banjo. Could you help me understand what exactly I have here?	lumpofclay	27	1	26	"OK, I am pretty stoked over all this, I have ""inherited"" my dad's Gibson Bella Voce 5-string banjo without the him dying part. I play guitar but have never played a banjo in my life so this is an absolute dream instrument to start playing.

Back story: my dad started learning banjo about 20 years ago, bought a few banjos, sold a few and kept only this one.  For a few years the old man plucked away and then lost interest when his banjo teacher moved away. Here in Germany there are very very few teachers around and so his banjo just started gathering dust. Recently I managed to convince him that it is a real shame that his banjo is just rotting away on some shelves and promised to learn playing banjo. He thought about it and told me, it was mine now and to take good care of it. Yay, jackpot! Unfortunately I couldn't string it, because one of the tuning pegs didn't work and immediately lost tension when tightened. So I had to find an instrument shop to repair it and do general checkup. I got it back yesterday and can finally start actually playing it.

I don't know very much about this banjo (or banjos in general), so if you could give me some insight what the technical stuff below means or have some additional information, that would be great. The only hard facts that I have on this banjo are from the purchasing info sheet that came with the banjo (from german/english mishmash):

*Manufacturer: Gibson*

*Model: Bella Voce (TB 3)*

*Year of construction: 1925, pre-war*
 
*Hardware:*

- *gold, engraved*
- *two piece flange*
- *Presto tailpiece*
- *high profile flathead tonering*

*Wood:*

- *curly maple, brown*
- *Bella Voce pearl inlays*

*Some wood carving, painting and pearl inlay work done by Bob Flesher (Liberty Banjo Company, early 70ies)*

Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/NuBaq) for you to take a look. Also [here's a video of me trying my first song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyouDIzOayE) to give you an idea of the sound. I have many years of guitar experience but only 2 days of banjo so don't expect wonders, I know that I need to use my thumb :)
 
I know as much as this is a damn fine banjo and now probably the most valuable single thing in my home but I am confused about the history of the instrument. From what I have researched it seems that Gibson did not build Bella Voce models as early as 1925, general production started 1927. TB 3 is a totally different model altogether and is a tenor banjo. Does this mean that parts of this banjo are from a TB 3 and some are from a Bella Voce? Was/is this common to ""combine"" a tenor and a 5-string banjo? How would you do that? Also, I would like to know if there is a way to tell which parts of the carvings, painting and inlays are original and which were added or modified by Bob Flesher. He seems to be a very accomplished banjo builder, at least the banjos on his website look fantastic, so I guess he knows what he's doing. To my untrained eye the banjo seems to be in pretty good shape considering the age. What do you think such a banjo could be worth?

**TL;DR: Got my dad's Gibson Bella Voce. [Here's some photos](http://imgur.com/a/NuBaq). [Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyouDIzOayE&amp;hd=1). Don't know much about banjos, maybe you do.**

Sorry I just couldn't find a scruggs style for it. If anyone has a scruggs tab, message me and i'll post it up here.


Since this is our first time doing this I figured I would recap our post and what we (seemingly) agreed upon.

* Song of The Week (SOTW) will be posted on the Monday of every week.
* I will try to organize who will pick the song for next week. EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO PICK A SONG just message me and i'll get something going.
* This is supposed to be a fun and supportive place for ALL of us (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) players to collectively learn a song. Try to provide help to one another, so that we can all grow together, and learn some sweet songs. 
* FORM: Form of the post, just for continuity should be how I have titled this one. That way people can find the thread easily.

Now that administrative stuff is out of the way. Lets get picking!

Also, I love this song. I love songs about murder and debauchery, they're just so much fun to sing. I also picked this song because it is relatively easy for beginners to learn, and considering that I'm relatively a beginner/intermediate player it seemed like a great place to start."	t5_2qlrg	True

1355888820.0	153961	The (hopefully) definitive guide to buying a 5-string bluegrass banjo	banjoman74	25	3	17	"I see one of these posts at least once a week it seems. I'm going to try to provide the definitive guide to buying a 5-string bluegrass banjo, breaking it up largely into three categories. If you want to buy a clawhammer banjo, I am of no help to you (though there may be some stuff in here the is transferrable).

NOTE: I have played banjo for over 25 years. I have worked in a music shop. I teach. I have also owned a variety of different banjos, from beginner to professional and in between.

Firstly, there are not a whole lot of banjo makers out there. One company will make multiple banjos and put any label you want. For example, there was the Kasuga factory from the 70s to the mid-90s in Japan that made Epiphones, Aria and, of course, Kasuga banjos and multiple other brand names. Sam Ick (Samick) and Cort were other manufacturer out of Korea, now the Samick brand was sold to a company in China after going bankrupt and Cort is out of Indonesia, I believe. There is no difference between the brands except the name, but each company makes various levels, some good... some bad. So the continual comparison of multiple brands is largely a moot point as you are essentially talking about the same hardware (I will address those in each category that don't fall into that category). Each banjo may sound very different, but set up can play a huge role. The head may be tighter, the neck may be attached tighter to the rim, and also, every instrument has its own sound. EVERY banjo bought should be gone over, heads should be adjusted, screws on tuners should be tightened, bridge should be properly placed, etc. This will greatly impact the sound of any banjo.

Banjo type 1:
[The bracket and shoe banjo](http://i.imgur.com/zyCCh.jpg). These banjos have what is known as a ""shoe bracket"" or ""bracket and shoe"" system to attach the head of the banjo to the rim. The ""shoe"" attaches directly to a multi-ply wood rim. The hook bolt holds the rim, which tightens the head. The hooks are very thin, and if you try to tighten them too much, they shear. The tuners are like guitar tuners (sticking out from the headstock) and they are open back. This is the ultimate beginner banjo. In a store, they are sold for around $250 new, and come with the typical beginner package (soft case, book, tuner, picks). I wouldn't be able to come up with all the names, but they are essentially all the same (Danville, Saga, Samick, Washburn). Even Fender's beginner banjo (FB300) is this type. They have very little sustain. They can be difficult to keep in tune. But they are cheap and easy to find. Don't spend over $250 for the package. Used... if you're lucky you can find them for under $100.00. Again, they are mostly all the same (even the Fender ones... but because of the Fender name, it will be easier to sell once you ""outgrow"" it). They have a very woody sound with little sustain, which makes it difficult for clear slides. The tuners can be finicky, which results in them being out of tune. They tend to be made in China.

Banjo type 2:
[The bottle-cap banjo](http://imgur.com/3RH8Y). These banjos, the flange looks like a bottle cap, hence the name. The flange is aluminum, and so is the rim. The hooks tend to be thin, so the same problem can occur with shearing. The tuners can either be like guitar tuners, but some of the higher ends have banjo-type tuners (not sticking out to the side of the headstock, but directly behind, like the image I posted). These banjos have multiple names as well, and they span back into the 80s. If you notice, they tend to have more hooks tightening the head. These banjos tend to be about $300, but can be found in the $200 range. In my opinion, they are a step above the shoe and bracket. You can tighten the head a little more, the tuners tend to be higher quality (especially if they are banjo tuners) and the aluminum rim give them a brighter sound, allowing an easier time for beginners to learn slides. These can be made in Japan or Korea.

Banjo type 3:
[No tone ring, true flange, typically ""tube and plate""](http://imgur.com/UwJQJ). The flanges are based on the Gibson banjos of the late 20s and are called ""tube and plate"" (the nuts go through a ""tube"", then through the flange). The rim is a made of wood, and there is typically a rolled-brass hoop between the head of the banjo (but not always, sometimes it sits directly on the wood). These almost always have banjo-style tuners. Take the resonator off these banjos as the rim can be either multi-ply (sometimes up to 12 plys of veneer) or three-ply (they actually look like 5-ply, because they use a wood-shim between the plys). The 3-ply banjos are of a higher quality. These are in the $500 to $600 range. Those with a multi-ply rim can sometimes be found for cheaper. These have a woodier sound than banjos with a true tone ring, but they sound a lot louder than the previous banjos I talked about, and are a true intermediate banjo. Set up, these banjos are very good. And, as mentioned they can be as old as the 1930s and up. Some of the 1930s ones can be, as can be expected, quite expensive, even with no tone ring. The banjo that is pictured (Recording King Madison, RK25) is the one that I would suggest. It is three-ply rim and put together well. These banjos can be American made, Japan or Korea. 

Banjo type 4:
[tone ring, wood rim banjo, true flange](http://imgur.com/Nw8g8). The banjo pictured here has a wood rim, a one-piece flange (the bolts don't go through a ""tube"" before going through the flange) and it has a tone ring. That is brass ring that sits on top of the wood rim, and the head of the banjo sits on the brass ring. The particular banjo has an ""arch top"". Banjos such as this can also have the two-piece (tube and plate) flange. These banjos tend to start at $700. They may be found cheaper (some of the 70s banjos, such as Aida and Ibanez, can be found cheaper if you're patient). Again, the rims can be mutli-ply or 3-ply. Always take the resonator off and check. The three-ply tends to sound better. This is the entry into the upper-intermediate banjo. Properly set up, this banjo will last you a long time. They tend to be heavier due to the tone ring. The ""arch top"" banjo will tend to have a brighter, more crisp sound. The ""flat head"" banjo will tend to have a more woodier sound with a little more sustain, but that can largely depend on set-up.

SPECIAL MENTION: 
[The Deering ""Goodtime 2"" banjo](http://imgur.com/0VlRi). All right. I may get some hate here. This is the banjo that gets mentioned a lot in this subreddit. This is an okay banjo. They fall in the $500 range. The main issue that I have with this banjo is the width of the rim (which is the metal rim that surrounds the drum head of the banjo). It is very thin. And the hooks are thin as well. I also don't think, that for the price, it should be a shoe and bracket banjo. Set up, they're a good banjo. But, in my opinion, for an extra $100, you can get a better banjo.

There. That's your intro into banjo. If you want, I can add some more information on the differences between a $1,000 to $3,000 banjo... though I think if you're at that level, you don't need my opinion. Also, please feel free to correct some of the information. I'm sorry if I've offended anybody with my opinion. My main goal is to provide price ranges, so when people stumble onto a banjo, they can have some idea whether they are getting a deal or not. And I truly hope this helps this community.


TOP TIPS ON IMPROVING YOUR SOUND BEFORE SPENDING MONEY ON THE UPGRADE:

Most of these entry level banjos (including the Goodtime) have pretty awful tuners out of the box. Upgrading to a nice set of brand name planetary geared tuners will run you about $110. They are pretty simple to install and you can even switch back when you move up. [These Schaller tuners are pretty nice:](http://www.elderly.com/accessories/names/schaller-planet-pegs-%28set-of-4%29--BP4.htm)

Even on expensive banjos, the bridge greatly affects the sound of the banjo, and is a cheap upgrade. Each bridge is different. Go to a place that has a number of banjo bridges. Swap some out on your banjo and see which ones sound the best. Also, they come in multiple heights, so make sure you get the right one for your banjo. If you don't have a place near you, [buy a couple different bridges with multiple heights here](http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Bridges,_tailpieces/Banjo_bridges/5-String_Banjo_Bridges.html) - if you buy 12, they are only $2.25 each. Once you figure out the height you want for your banjo, [you may want to check out the higher-priced bridges](http://www.banjoteacher.com/Gear/Banjo%20Bridge/index.htm). They run about $25.00. I'm a fan of Scorpion Banjo Bridges by Silvio Ferretti. Silvio is a heck of a great guy - a great banjo player from Italy.

A good banjo tailpiece can make your live easier, and they are cheap and extremely light on cheap banjos. A good tailpiece not only offers an ease in changing strings, they also are important in creating an angle on the strings after they pass over the bridge. This creates downward pressure on the bridge and head, keeping the bridge in place as well as increasing overall volume. The sharper the angle on the tailpiece, the ""sharper"" the sound. It's a matter of personal preference. Cheap tailpieces can't be adjusted. [The Presto tailpiece is the Gibson standard. Some people like the Waverly, and some people like the Kershner](http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Bridges,_tailpieces/Banjo_tailpieces.html). They're under $35.00, and tend to be around $25.00. [These ones are funky](http://elderly.com/accessories/items/BA77.htm). [Or if you want to get real fancy, Fults makes some very nice tailpieces](http://www.banjotailpiece.com/)

More kids play banjo now because they listen to bands like mumford and sons and the avett brothers. And when they get the banjo they discover the true joys of banjo music.

[Intro to banjo - right hand](http://youtu.be/TOLwxcJP1B0)

If you have any questions about the lesson, please feel free to ask. 

Some notes. Practice these two rolls until you can comfortably do them one after another. Alternate between doing an alternating thumb and a forward backward roll (and vice versa). It is important to get that right-hand movement into muscle memory - it will help when you have to look at hand positioning of your left hand (the next lesson).

Also, it's better to practice a little each day. By that I mean it's way better to spend a half-hour of practice every two days then one-hour practice every other day."	t5_2qlrg	True

I thought I would pick a standard that can be played both in the ""bluegrass"" and ""clawhammer style."" I like Bill Cheatham as there are lots of opportunities to play with styles (melodic, straight Scruggs, single-string). Here is a Goldilocks tab (hopefully not too hard, but not too soft either.

Again, hope no one takes offense that I started it. I'll try and record the version I tabbed out with some variations as well.

[Bill Cheatham tab](http://imgur.com/Sjc4M)

(EDIT) All right, so I had a chance to fool around playing Bill Cheatham. The first version I play is pretty close to the tab that I wrote. The second version I start playing a melodic version that I would be more than willing to tab out to anyone that is interested (just ask). Then it's me fooling around.

I would be happy to organize the song of the week. Those interesting in participating, PM me and I'll put you into the calendar. I'll tab out songs for those looking for tab on the songs I know, and anytime there is no one in the calendar, I'll choose a song, if that's okay with everyone.

With all that said, I give you the [FIRST VERSION OF BILL CHEATHAM](http://youtu.be/qwAYiPlh9IM)

Another edit. I believe someone was asking if we could include a brief history of the song. I'll do my best, and please feel free to add. Bill Cheatham, also known at ""Cheat 'em"" or ""Bill Cheat 'em"" is a fiddle tune from the 19th century, popular in the southern states. I believe the first reference to it is in an 1899 fiddle contest (it was one of the tunes required) in Gallatin Texas. The first recording is by Texas fiddler Eck Robertson in 1922. It didn't gain widespread popularity until Arthur ""Fiddlin"" Smith played it regularly on the Grande Ol' Opry in the 30s and 40s. This song was also played regularly by Doc Watson. This song is also the first song on the track ""Fiddle Tunes for Banjo"" by Tony Trishka, Bela Fleck and Bill Keith. All three of them play this song on the track. "	t5_2qlrg	True

So it will get super-cold, but it will warm up again (maybe) and be relatively stable. Will the banjo get destroyed? Is there anything I should do to minimize the damage?

When I was 10 I began to play Alto Sax then the following year I switched to playing Baritone Sax, up until my senior year I remained in Symphonic Band and Marching Band. I feel silly admitting this since I do really enjoy music, though I never made a hobby of it outside of school (even though essentially every friend I have plays music constantly) until recently; I feel like I really didn't learn a lot, I feel lost. I know how scales work (some) and a lot of thing specific to sax but I feel really inferior when it comes to the mechanics of creating music.

I am not sure if all of you guys are traditionalist out there or if some of you are interested in experimental techniques.
 Anyways I just released an experimental bluegrass/folk concept EP titled [Appalachia](http://greatgatzitsmatt.bandcamp.com/album/appalachia) . On the last two songs, [Cicada Hum](http://greatgatzitsmatt.bandcamp.com/track/cicada-hum) and [Mist of the Southern Foothills](http://greatgatzitsmatt.bandcamp.com/track/mist-of-the-southern-foothills) I used an [eBow](http://www.ebow.com/home.php) which is an electronic bowing device. Guitarists use it to get violin style swells and infinite sustain. This gave me a sitar type of sound of out the banjo thanks to the resonating head. Also, on another song I detuned the banjo to an open Db tuning (ab,Db,F,Ab,Db). 
I was just curious if you guys have experimented with non-traditional techniques for the banjo such as effect pedals, eBows, tunings, etc. "	t5_2qlrg	True

1) I would like to learn to read sheet music for the banjo as I think it will help me learn the neck a little better and I would like to read notation instead of tabs. The only problem is, I'm used to reading music on the piano so the transition from piano key to written note is much more transparent than a fret. What kind of things could you suggest to help me learn this effectively?

2) Also, I'm looking for some tabbed exercises to learn the different scales on the banjo. The one scale I have seen for the G scale started on the third string then skipped down to the fourth string 7th fret then up two strings etc.  To my novice ears I'm not sure how I will be able to find that out myself. Now I can count up frets and play it single string, but I think learning both would be best.

Also, what kind of exercises do you guys do? I'd be interested to see how you all warm up and how you progress.

Thanks!"	t5_2qlrg	True

As always, looking forward to hearing everyone's version of this song, whether you're a beginner, intermediate or pro.

This is a song that has been around for over 150 years. The lyrics are from an Englishman, Sir Henry Bishop, and the melody is from John Howard Payne's 1823 Opera ""Clari, Maid of Milan."" This song was a favourite of Abraham Lincoln, and has been heard in movies from ""Amityville Horror II"" to Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp.""

Two interesting facts about the song. It was used by drinking establishments in the 1900s as a signal for closing time. And it was banned form being played in Civil War camps for fear that it would incite desertion.

For banjo, this was one of the songs that was transcribed by Bill Keith for inclusion in ""Earl Scruggs and the Five String Banjo."" The version I play is a modification of this version with a Drop-C tuning (D-string tuned down to a C). Additionally, many bluegrass banjo players learned this in the key of D (with D-tuning) and play the song using ""Keith Scruggs"" tuners."	t5_2qlrg	True

1352091000.0	12nhsl	[SotW] Old Spinning Wheel for week of November 5	banjoman74	14	0	7	"Here is my version of [Old Spinning Wheel](http://youtu.be/q9Yb6JW1JBE) and [the tablature](http://imgur.com/wm1Vj)

Old Spinning Wheel was written around 1933 by William Hill. Billy Hill was a Tin Pan Alley songwriter who also wrote ""The Last Roundup"" and ""Wagon Wheel"" and is likely best known for ""The Glory of Love,"" recorded by Benny Goodman, Dean Martin, Otis Redding and Bette Midler, amongst others.

But back to Old Spinning Wheel. Riley Pucket famously recorded this song. It became a very popular song amongst banjo players, both vocally and instrumentally. Mac Wiseman also recorded a version (which is where I first heard it). This song is appropriate for both clawhammer and bluegrass.

NOTE: To make this week a little more unique, I chose a bit of a slower song, and also a song in C. It allows for different tunings and also a different feel from previous SotW, which lent themselves more to a lot of drive. I hope you banjo players enjoy this week's song. I am thoroughly enjoying picking songs of the week (and working on both playing and writing the tablature). I hope no one minds that I have taken this on. And please feel free to suggest songs for weeks to come if i'm choosing poorly."	t5_2qlrg	True

One of these songs, I wrote for banjo-- 'Heartless' -- and the other was written by Des Ark and is called 'My Saddle Is Waitin' (C'mon Jump On It)' for the tenor guitar. I spent an afternoon sounding it out and adjusting it for the banjo some time back. It was well worth it. I strongly recommend anybody who likes my version, and also anyone who doesn't (hers is much better) check out her version.

I've tried it in the past with the guitar, but I never really stuck with it. It took me a little while to adapt in those first few practice sessions, but there's no going back now.

I just wanted to contribute something from someone in between all of that.  
  
I started playing banjo about 5 months ago.  Aside from a brief 1 year stint with piano lessons, I've never done anything musical ever (I'm 30).  I recently upgraded to a Deering Goodtime Classic after attending Patrick Costello's workshop in Bedford, and I don't know if it was the upgrade or the workshop but recently I felt a lot of freedom just playing.  Not playing anything in particular, but just playing.  Granted it was a lot of simple stuff, because my left hand still needs a lot of work.  
  
Through this playing though, I stumbled into [this song](https://soundcloud.com/iamnotchris/adk).  I feel weird saying I ""wrote"" it, because I didn't set out to make anything.  In fact, it was never my intention to make anything new.  I just wanted to play other people's songs.  It's very simple, because my left hand isn't very good.  It's just a lot of repetition, hammer ons, pulloffs, and slides.  It's sloppy and not done yet, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, but it was fun, and freeing, because I couldn't do it wrong because *it* didn't exist.  
  
It's double C tuning with the 5th string capo'ed on the 10th fret.  It kind of happened by accident because I was practicing Steve' Martin's 'The Great Remember' in Double C, and also happened to be trying out my railroad spikes (my previous banjo didn't have them, I used the good old pen cap method).  It sounded pleasant when I was playing so I kept it like that.  
  
**tldr** stumbled into a simple song.  [here's another link to it](https://soundcloud.com/iamnotchris/adk).  it's far from groundbreaking, or new, or exciting, but I wanted to share it nonetheless."	t5_2qlrg	True

Like just about everyone, I'm still learning new shit every day, and I want to know what other stuff I should be focusing on.

For me it was the basic melody of the song Wildwood Flower. I was deployed to Africa and had taken my banjo, but was just starting out and was struggling to move past Cripple Creek and Boil 'em Cabbage Down. I made a friend who played mandolin, and we decided to jam and discussed what music we both knew. I didn't know how to play WwF, but I went back to my trailer and learned it in about 30 minutes. Those two-person jam sessions evolved into a group of eight playing all sorts of different music just about every day, and I learned real quick how having other folks to play with is the best motivation for progressing your art.

Hey all! Thanks for taking the time to look at this.

My mum got me a banjo for Christmas and I'm currently teaching myself how to play. I've been practicing clawhammer and have one small question-

When ""picking"" single notes of a melody, do I strike them with my nail as I would with the regular clawhammer style? Or am I free to use my thumb?

Buying my first banjo was a daunting task. Read many reviews, guides and opinions prior to embarking on that task, and decided to get a closed-back because you can turn a closed-back into an open-back but you can't turn an open-back into a closed-back... I researched sellers, too, and decided on banjo.com because they set up the banjos before shipping.  As for what banjo, I had decided to buy a Goodtime 2 , based on recommendations, but on a whim checked out some other starters they had. I saw this Liberty 100, the cheapest closed-back they got, and initially skipped it over thinking it's got to be a P.O.S. for that price. Then I checked out the specs and noticed it had 5 geared tuners... That got me thinking because the next cheapest closed back with 5 geared tuners was the Goodtime 2, at twice the cost!  Searched all over for more reviews, there weren't many but one on banjohangout mentioned taking this one to an instructor who said ""That's a lot of banjo for $230."" Well, long story short I took a chance on it. It came set up for a beginner, and I had my first lesson the other day where my instructor inspected it and didn't find any issues. Said it ""felt solid"" and was ""very well set up."" For half the price of the Goodtime 2 I can't think of a better starter banjo!"	t5_2qlrg	True

For now it's just the actual melody, a fun little song to pick along with due to the ninths. I'm hoping to add in some of the chorus of the banjo, maybe a few grace notes and chordstrums later on.


Note: MIDI output seems to skip a couple notes sometimes, make sure to double check the sheet music.

1367890161.0	1du07m	My (short) amateur review of the Banjo Thimble /u/monofonik brought up in a thread a few days ago.	iamnotchris	9	1	6	"A few days ago in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/banjo/comments/1dlbob/how_do_you_get_a_clean_and_crisp_claw_strike/), the [banjo thimble](http://www.banjothimble.com/HOME.html) came up.  I can tend to have a problem with not getting clear sounds from strings sometimes, so I figured I would give it a shot.  
  
First off, I ordered it 3 days ago for 15 bucks, and it arrived at my house today, so shipping was nice and fast.  
  
It basically looks like [a little Iron Man Mark 1 helmet](http://www.banjothimble.com/BUY_THIMBLES_files/shapeimage_4.jpg), and with a little bending fit on my finger pretty nice.  It only adds a few cm girth to your finger, so it doesn't really get in the way of anything.    
  
I have only been playing banjo since the last week of December, and this is my first instrument (stringed or otherwise) so I really have no expertise in the matter.  With my clawhammer stroke, I actually found the thimble harder to get a clean note at first.  If I adjusted my stroke so I was coming more directly towards the head (and not slightly down and out like I usually do), thats when the thimble really stood out.  Gave the banjo a louder, deeper, metal-y tone.  The tip of the thimble is curved, so with some force, the strings really slide and snap off the thimble when you come directly at the head of the banjo. I found myself able to hit the strings harder, and get a clearer sound (when I did it right).  Without it, I usually get a lot of muting when I try to go harder.  On the downstrokes though (again, mostly due to my lack of experience), the way I hit I got a lot of ""scratching"" sound of metal on metal.  
  
I think with practice with it, it could be a pretty useful tool.  I don't necessarily like that I don't feel the strings when I hit them, but I got used to that pretty quickly.  
  
[Here is a video comparing the sound with and without the thimble.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieii2Av9nis)  Please excuse my suckiness, I've only been playing 4 months and spend most of my time with Scruggs style (only 1 instructor in my area, and he doesn't do clawhammer).

I proposed doing a song every two weeks to allow those players a little more time to learn, practice and prepare the song. I also recorded this song as a bit of a tutorial for the bluegrass players. Sorry clawhammer players, I don't know how to play that style. Here is [Old Joe Clark](http://youtu.be/P7QFv-rGTL0)

This song is about an actual person, a rough mountaineer by the name of Joe Clark. He was born in Clay County, Kentucky, in 1839. There was a popular breakdown tune in the area that had no name, and Joe's friends would make up verses, using Joe Clark's name. Joe ran a store and had a licensed still, which made him rather popular in the area. The still and his life also made him be a pretty rough individual.

Joe Clark had recently divorced and was running around with several women around town, including Chris Leger. Joe grew tired of Chris and moved in with another woman. Chris convinced her friend, Jim Howard, to kill Joe Clark so she could lay claim to Joe's farm and general store. Howard shot Joe in April of 1885.

The song gained popularity during WWI, and became not only a popular fiddle song, but also a popular children's song that allowed for many made-up verses. I think the earliest printed version was around 1918. In 1934 it became a huge hit for fiddler John Carson.

I'm just a little tired today. I wrote out the tab and tried to stick to it as much as possible (hence the hiccup in the beginning as I failed to play what was written).

[Here's the tab](http://i.imgur.com/aEEM1Jo.jpg)

History: This song was originally a hymn by Ada R. Habershon and Charles Gabriel. Originally, Ada wrote hymns in German, but in 1901 she started writing hymns in English (eventually writing over 200 hymns). Some of her works include Meet Me In the Homeland and Soon Will Our Saviour from Heaven Appear.

A.P. Carter changed the verses but kept the chorus (and changed the song title to ""Can the Circle Be Unbroken."") To list all the different artists who have covered this song (or portions of the song, as Johnny Cash did in ""Daddy Sang Bass"") would be futile.

But I would be remiss to not include the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In 1972, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band took it upon themselves to unite two generations of bluegrass and country musicians. And what better theme would be this song, ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken."" Notably missing was Bill Monroe, who refused to participate. But Earl Scruggs, Roy Acuff, Maybelle Carter, Vassar Clements, Merle Travis, Jimmy Martin, Bashful Brother Oswald and Doc Watson participated. Every track was recorded in one or two takes. Thankfully, they also kept the tape of discussions of how the songs would be played, or who would come in when, and those insightful discussions were also captured.

Originally, it was a 3 record album, and it is a must-have for any bluegrass aficionado. Nitty Gritty Gritty Dirt Band would produce two more Circle albums. But, in my opinion, none can compare to the original 1972 recordings.

So banjo players, let's hear your versions of ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken."""	t5_2qlrg	True

This is one of my favourite fiddle tunes. This song was originally called ""Jackson's Victory"" after a victory against 8,000 British military man by Jackson with some poorly equipped Americans. Funnily enough, it came after the peace treaty was signed for the War of 1812.

After Jackson was president and time had passed, he wasn't so popular, so the tune was changed to commemorate the battle, not the man. This is a unique older fiddle tune as it seems to have no ties to a modified European fiddle tune. 

In 1936, Jimmy Driftwood (James Morris) wrote lyrics to this melody, called ""The Battle of New Orleans."" The song became a chart topper for Johnny Horton, scoring number one on the Billboard Charts in 1959.

So, here's your challenge banjo players. Let's hear your version of Eighth of January. Some banjo players play it in the key of A (capoed on the second fret) but fiddle players traditionally play it in the key of D.

I'm not huge into bluegrass or country, but I am a fan of indie and folk, which is really where this thought process all stemmed from.  
  
Poking around online, it seems that I am coming across a similar issue many people have.  The only instructor in my area teaches 3 finger bluegrass, not clawhammer.  My question is:  Since I have never played an instrument before, is it worth it to go through the lessons, get a foundation with the left hand and chords, get a foundation with rhythm, and then as I get comfortable with the instrument work on learning clawhammer on my own?

I'm a left-handed musician, and I had wanted a banjo for quite a while. I recently inquired in a music shop near where I live, about the possibility of getting a left-handed 5 string banjo. The salesman immediately told me Deering was the company for the job, but that lefties were special orders only and usually not made for entry-level instruments. In spite of this, he promised me he'd check with his sales rep if anything could be done. To my surprise, he called me back soon enough to let me know Deering agreed to make me a nice open back lefty right in my price range (500$). I was ecstatic.

Since I wasn't familiar with the model proposed (Goodtime), I told him I would do some research and call him back. During the weekend, while I was visiting my dad (3 hours drive from where I live), I dropped by a music shop which I knew carried banjos, mainly to check out the difference between an open back and a closed back banjo (in my dreams, mine had always been a closed back). As soon as I saw the banjo section, I was sad to realize they didn't have any open backs at the moment.

But then my jaw dropped to the floor. Right there, in front of my eyes, was a used left handed Deering Deluxe 5 string banjo (built in 1992) sitting on the first hook in all its glory and my name written all over it. I couldn't believe my luck. I managed to get it for 1200$, which totally bust my budget, but was completely worth the value.

It's been three months, and I'm in absolute love with my instrument. It's amazing.

Finger picks / Tuners / Strings etc ? 
Where do people get music sheets / tabs from ? 
Is there any good websites people know of that have good tutorials on ?

In regards to the actual banjo itself, how hard is it to set it up yourself? as iam UK and i doubt highly there is any Banjo techs around me. Do I need to stretch the skin out myself to tune it ? Should i look for a supplier who does the set-up before selling it?

So I'm getting into Gmodal tuning, and really loving it. Something about that sound is just perfect for the banjo and how I seem to be playing it, and it seems to fit my lackluster singing voice better than other tunings.

Currently, I can play a few tunes. Shady Grove, The CooCoo Bird, Walking Boss, Cluck Old Hen. That's about it. 

Really love the CooCoo, [the ""~~strum~~ Galax lick""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvJ6M0Oz0lU) (not sure what it's called) is awesome. Anything with that type of sound gets a bonus point.

What's your favorite Gm tune? 

Post a video of your favorite version, or just a title will work too. I really need to expand my repertoire. I'd like to be able to play at least a dozen Gm tunes by the end of this summer, it'd be nice to be able to get maybe 45 minutes to an hour of songs before I have to retune."	t5_2qlrg	True

1370544586.0	1ft3zd	New to banjo, want to learn clawhammer: Deering Goodtime or Deering Goodtime2?	Murloh	8	0	17	"I am interested in learning clawhammer.  Now, I have read that open back is the way to go.  So I was looking for a Deering Goodtime.  But, I came across a deal on a used Goodtime2 with resonator - $410.  Seems like a pretty good price.  

I've also listened to both banjos on youtube, and do really like the sound of the Goodtime2.  Very crisp and pronounced notes.  I also liked some of the clawhammer examples done on it that I saw.  I was hoping to ask for some opinions....

1) Should I stick with getting a Goodtime without the resonator for clawhammer?  What exactly would I be missing if I got the Goodtime2 in terms of clawhammer and the sound?  

2) If I do decide to get the Goodtime2, it is supposed to be in great shape, but what should I look for?  Straight neck obviously, making sure each fret is clear.  Anything else?  

3) On the Goodtime2, is the resonator removable?

Essentially I would be getting a used Goodtime2 for the price of a new Goodtime.  (I might be able to get a little lower of a price on the GT2)  Trying to decide if this is the best thing to do given the style I want to focus on.

**EDIT:**
Thank you for the responses everyone.  I got some great insight.  I decided to get it.  So, I got home and was telling My wife that I found a Goodtime2 that I am going to buy tonight all excited.  She then looked at me and frowned and said I do this every year.  I had no idea what she was talking about... I asked what do I do every year??  She said, I am too impossible to surprise because I ALWAYS wind up ruining it.  Then she told me she already bought me the Deering Goodtime Open Back and it should be here tomorrow for a Father's Day present!!  I love that woman!

I've been playing music my whole life, guitar, bass, mostly percussion, vocals, uke (a little). I really want to get into the banjo for two reasons:  
1) I love irish folk and bluegrass  
2) I want to jam with my good buddy's 7 piece band. They already have really great guys playing guitar, bass, and drums, and don't really need anything else I could give them except vocal harmonies. But I think banjo would go great with their style.

I always seem to pick up instruments very quickly, and unless the banjo turns out to be a notoriously difficult instrument, I think I could have some really great fun with it.

My questions to you are; is the banjo more difficult to learn than I'm imagining? Should I start on a cheap beginner instrument and work my way up, or step up to something a bit nicer? Is there such a thing as an acoustic electric banjo and is it worth it, especially since I plan on playing with a bigger band? What are some great songs/artists to jam with for practicing?

Here's a big one; I chew my fingernails, am I fucked? Is there an advantage/disadvantage to using finger picks?

Any other advice you think I could use would be greatly appreciated. Happy jamming!

[UPDATE] So I went with the Dean Backwoods 2 acoustic-electric only because a store around town had one brand new, and sold it to me for $270. Considering it's $380 at guitar center or musicians friend, I think I won out. Now it's time for me to start pickin. Thanks for all your advice!"	t5_2qlrg	True

There is a slight difference between the two. Typically, the B-part in Lost Indian does not go to the relative minor. Though, with the songs being played so often, they tend to get morphed into one another.

Origins of the tune is sketchy. Lost Indian is likely derived from Lonesome Indian. Tommy Magness recorded Lost Indian around the 1930s. The song may predate that, of course. Tommy Jackson is credited with Cherokee Shuffle. Likely, he simply played the tune in A and gave it a new title. 

Cherokee Shuffle is also considered a ""crooked tune"" as the A part and the B part are not the same length.

I've just qualified and am supposed to be looking for a job, but I have decided that an effective method of procrastination would be to have a bit of a holiday/do a bit of travelling before I knuckle down and enter the real world. 

Trouble is that I haven't had a holiday in years, and would be travelling on my own, and I don't really know what to do on a holiday any more, so I've been looking for a holiday with a bit of a purpose.

I started to learn the banjo a while ago now, and I've got the hang of it and am loving the old-time music. So I thought it'd be fun to travel over to the States and experience a bit of the real stuff (oh, I live in the UK...) 

So after all that rambling, where do you recommend for a beginner clawhammer player to go to hear some awesome music, perhaps to play with some folks and to generally enjoy the culture and world that old time music comes from? One town? A road trip? I have no idea here folks, not even to the level of what state it'd be good to go to... 

Help a chap out and point me in the right direction!

I've been playing guitar for around 15 years, and while I'm not a super star shredder, I'm a halfway decent punk/metal guitarist.  I've generally played rhythm guitar in hardcore or death metal bands, and I've always been able to fake it till I make it, so to speak.  With that said, I really want to make sure that I treat the banjo as it's own instrument, and not just a weirdo guitar.  I figure one of the best ways I can do that is to force myself to learn the claw hammer technique over Scruggs style finger picking, because my natural instinct as a guitarist is  to just start finger picking.  I understand the basic idea behind claw hammer, but any sort of resources I've been able to find regarding the technique seem to be for people who have either never touched an instrument before in their lives, or people who already know how  to play a banjo, and neither really suit me so I end up just going back to noodling around with finger picking.  Can anybody recommend some good resources or drills to practice the claw hammer technique for somebody who understands how the banjo works, but isn't really a banjo player per se?  My biggest influence for wanting to play the banjo is Roscoe Holcomb if it makes any difference, but I also have no illusions of being able to play like him for a very long time, if ever.  Mostly i just want to play for my own enjoyment, but still sound okay.  I'm also wondering about fixing a strap to my banjo, can I just tie a guitar strap to a couple of the brackets, or will that make the tension wonky and throw my banjo out of whack?  I don't know if it makes any difference or not, but I have a Gold Tone CC-100R.  I'm also wondering if they come set up the factory in fairly good condition, or if I should take it to a luthier to give it a once over.

RagingElbows	7	0	10	"So I play upright bass and Jazz Tenor banjo. In the same band. It always bugs me that I am going to have to switch, and I always think, well, why can't I do both?

Turns out I can. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzN5K6rX2to was the first successful attempt way back in the 20s/30s. 

There have been numerous modern attempts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAt9uga34JU being one. The problem as you can see is he can't slap it well. It really needs the neck angle that you would find on an upright. 

So my idea is to get a bass drum shell, some sort of block of wood, and a bass kit. Unfortunately atm only Chinese manufacturers sell them: 
http://www.ebay.com/itm/3-4-Upright-Bass-part-neck-with-fingerboard-bridge-tailpiece-Germany-style-pegs-/390590973861?pt=String_Instrument_Parts_Accessories&amp;hash=item5af10947a5

The other problem is that I am not sure I can get a drum shell thick/sturdy enough to hold the tension.  I'd have to use some sort of block to get the neck to the right height and some bolts...and probably an improvised dowel stick between the top and bottom.  Perhaps a steel rod that goes through the drum shell and is bolted into the neck?  

Anyway, anyone tried this? Or are there any luthiers/banjo people around the Sacramento area that would want to embark on the quest to make the largest banjo on the West Coast?

I'm sure you guys get a ton of these posts, but I'm looking for advice on purchasing a banjo and have recently come across the banjo I mentioned in the title at a music store near me.  I was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on it.  This will be my first banjo, but not my first stringed instrument so I'm trying to balance the quality of the instrument with an affordable price.

[This] (http://www.banjo-brands.com/banjo-96601-SIGMA-BANJO-CF-MARTIN-CO-MODEL-SB25) is not the exact banjo, but this is very similar.

Two things to mention.  There is a tiny amount of pitting on one section of the tone ring and there is a small chip in the finish down where the coordinator rod comes out the back of the instrument but it looks superficial.

Any advice would be appreciated and if you have any questions that would help, please ask away."	t5_2qlrg	True

1359603384.0	17lvtf	Mystery tenor banjo	navarond	10	1	4	"pics...http://imgur.com/a/gDdVQ

I have a tenor banjo with no brand name on the head stock, and nothing stamped on the square wooden truss rod under the head either. I bought it from a shop that claims it's old...1930's-ish. Since it didn't have a brand name on it, I was able to snag it for cheap. I still wonder what it might be, if anything. Is there a way I can tell what it is? What I can tell you is that it has a pie-plate style resonator that comes off completely when I remove a center bolt that screws right through the center of the resonator and into the truss-rod. It leaves the banjo looking like a traditional open-back (no awkward flanges hanging out everywhere). Another way of putting it, the bow-tie style flange is part of the resonator unit, not a part of the head and pot. The tuners are new (originals were black friction tuners). Was told it could be a Vega, or a Kay Co/Stromberg-Voisinet. 

Does anyone here know any diagnostic features to whittle it down?

I got a Snowball mic for Christmas, so this is the test drive. And sorry for missing last week, I was doing the Christmas thing with no access to my banjo for a week. I went a little loopy.

For those new, the Song of the Week offers an opportunity for all banjo players to learn and record a version of a particular song. Past [SotW] include Clinch Mountain Backstep and Cripple Creek.

Clinch Mountain Backstep is largely known as a banjo tune made famous by The Stanley Brothers. But I believe it was likely derived from a Henry Reed song ""Breakdown in A."" 

This is truly a ""crooked tune"" with the lengthened bar in the second part. Originally, this would have allowed dancers to come back into position for old-tyme dances. 

Geography wise, Clinch Mountain is in Tennessee and Virginia, in the  Appalachian Mountains.

""But banjoman74,"" you ask, ""are there any lyrics to Clinch Mountain Backstep?"" Why yes, yes there are. You can sing ""The Whole World Round"" to the melody of ""Clinch Mountain Backstep."" The Dillards famously sang this song.

Posts like Dwaligon's Down in the River to Pray make that itch flare up something fierce, but every time I set my mind to trying to learn I end up frustrated and frailing once again. So I ask you - is there some secret to to doing this? I have a few books of simple melody tabs, but when I try to put the standard rolls to them they don't sound like songs. 

How do you take a melody and mix it in with rolls and get it to sound right? I mean, I watch this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m73vH8khEg

He plays the song exactly like I want to, but his left hand seems to be doing so little; definitely less than I'd be doing in clawhammer. I can't see the right one.

I may have got a little carried away, and having now spent almost as much on bits and pieces as I would have on a pre-made neck I have decided to put in some MoP inlayed dots.

Now my problem is that, although I am a reasonable woodworker, I have never used MoP before, and I really have no idea what I am doing in regard to the finish. 

My plan is to drill the holes for the dots just slightly too shallow, but as close as I can get it, then glue them in, probably with superglue, and then sand the whole neck down to a nice finish. I had planned to do this in my usual method of working down through the grades of sandpaper until I am using very fine wet and dry paper, and then finish with some fine wire wool and a coat (or rather several coats) of oil. 

Will this work, or will I just end up with a misty scratched finish on the MoP having wasted my time and meaning I might as well have used white plastic.

Someone suggested putting graphite powder in the nut when I changed my strings, but that wasn't super helpful because A) the strings don't really need to be changed right now, and B) I didn't really want to make a trip to the hardware store to get graphite powder. SO, I just tried loosening the strings until I could pull them to the side on the nut and kind of... dug the tip of a mechanical pencil around in there until I'd gotten a bit of graphite shavings into the slot.

I've heard that Banjo's are notorious for there tuning issues, but I just can't see this being right. Are the tuners supposed to be this loose? Is this something that is fixable on my end or do I have to bring it in to a shop?

Is it true that the heavier, the better?

Those funny things (finger picks?) are those really necessary?

I'm from latin america so I doubt I can find a teacher around here. I was thinking about getting some instructional and song-books, any recommendations?

1306523127.0	hlqd7	I just made a great sounding banjo pickup for under $5.00	rossendale2203	6	1	10	"Used the following:
Piezo buzzer (just the diaphragm and hook up wires) 
Old 1/4"" guitar cable - (need maybe 7 inches)
1/4"" input jack 
Duct Tape
Electrical Tape
Solder
Flux
Heat Shrink
Drill

All I did was solder the piezo to the audio cable and sealed the connection with heat shrink and electrical tape. I then soldered the other end to the input jack. I drilled a hole in the side of the banjo, installed the input jack and used a 1/2"" square piece of duct tape to fix the piezo to the underside of the skin. Works amazingly and sounds perfect. It doesn't affect playability or sound. If you don't want to drill a hole in your banjo you could just attach an input jack to the outside I guess.

I have recently started a jam night at my local hackspace, and it's got to the point where we have a decent amount of instruments (fiddle, banjo, bass, a surprising amount of ukuleles, a caj√≥n, a shuffle dancer and one or two guitars...) and we're starting to find out feet and actually knock out a few decent tunes, some old time some contemporary.

We have started to record stuff and put it up on a soundcloud for all to share, but the quality is pretty terrible, as our recording devices are essentially phone and a cheap dictaphone.

So... my question is does anyone have any experience in recording this kind of disorganised rabble of music. I have seen those Zoom sound recorders, but don't really know if they are any good. We need something simple and (preferably) reasonably cheap, that can sit relatively unnoticed and just record us jamming away, so we can edit out the good stuff into tracks later on.

1366868237.0	1d2el3	my banjo has a cracked neck- is this easily fixable?	zorromarron	5	0	11	"[here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/M4aqKDz.jpg).

As you can see it starts right under the nut and goes about 5 inches down the neck.  there's a second crack directly on the opposite side, but it's only a couple inches long.

I have no experience in woodworking, or building instruments, or anything, so I really haven't any idea how to go about fixing it.  My first idea is just to try to open the crack a little, get some wood glue in there, and clamp it while it dries.  Even if this works, will the strength of the neck still be compromised?

I have a second banjo that works fine, so it's not a big deal if I can't get this repaired.  This one is open back though, my other has a resonator, so it would be kinda cool to have one of each."	t5_2qlrg	True

I've been playing banjo for a few months now and I've been having trouble forcing myself to wear the fingerpicks when I play because I can hardly hear myself play over the scratchy and tingy sound the picks make against the strings. I've got a simple Davison 5-string banjo and a few cheap steel fingerpicks and a plastic thumbpick.

I've already tried rubbing down the strings and the picks, and bending the ends of the finger picks slightly to contact the strings more directly.

I guess my question is if the distracting noise is stemming from cheap factory strings?...or cheap finger picks?...or something else?"	t5_2qlrg	True

1362765100.0	19x8a9	Help choosing my first banjo, limited choices in my country.	ehvo	5	0	11	"Hi!

I've decided to buy a banjo and start learning to play bluegrass on my own. I'm a guitarist for several years now, so I have some basic music notions.

The thing is, here in Argentina, the range of banjos to choose from is really low. This weekend I'm going to check some stores for myself, but from what I've gathered on some local internet stores some of my best choices for a starter banjo are (filtered by price, from low to high):

* Epiphone MB-100 (5 strings, no resonator, guitar style pegs)
* Savannah SB-100 (5 strings, resonator, guitar style pegs)
* Epiphone MB-200 (5 strings, resonator, planetary pegs)

I'll look for better options once I visit a couple of stores myself, but I think this is the kind of banjos I'll find there. 

Could you give me any advice to keep in mind? I'm looking for a starter banjo.

I really appreciate all the help you can give me! :)

[And here is the song](http://youtu.be/L6scn58m2bg)

So this song was originally recorded as a ""cakewalk."" This song's history is a little clouded, to say the least, but it appears to date back to around 1900. The origins of it becoming an old-tyme fiddle number is the result of Charles Seeger. Charles recorded old-time fiddle player, Sanford Rich, playing this song in Aurtherdale West Virginia in 1936 for the Library of Congress. Charles' son, Mike Seeger (of the New Lost City Ramblers) learned the song from this recording, and it became one of the first songs recorded by the Ramblers.

The dance [""cakewalk""](http://youtu.be/AcFQjG3TiBw) is also clouded in its origins. I like the version that it was a parody of the ballroom dances that slaves would have seen as servers. It became a popular dance style in the very early 1900s. At town fairs, the best dancers would win a cake. It also became a regular dance at minstrel shows.

""Colored Aristocracy"" is a reference to the 'black elite' of St. Louis Missouri and dates back to the mid 1800s. 

In 2005, recordings from the first black banjo gathering were released, and this was the title of the album (Carolina Chocolate Drops presents Colored Aristocracy - Sankofa Strings), which I thought was pretty cool."	t5_2qlrg	True
1361042642.0	18nfgz	My take on Steve Martin's The Great Remember	lumpofclay	6	2	5	"Hi, r/banjo!

I have picked up playing the banjo 4 months ago and since the time this song was posted here, I knew that this would be the first real song that I was going to learn. Since I never found a tab I worked it out by ear. But as I am still a beginner and never had any banjo lessons, there are obviously some differences to the original. Anyways, I am really happy to finally be able to play my version of this song. Hopefully you will find that I did it some justice.

I'd like to start learning the banjo but I have no idea what to look for when purchasing one. I've been playing various woodwind instruments for almost a decade so I have a fair amount of musical experience and knowledge - but none when it comes to banjos!
The main things I'm wondering about are:
-Do I want a 4-string or 5-string and why?
-How does the size affect my learning and is there an average or beginners standard size?
-Do I want a new banjo or is a second-hand one a better buy for a beginner?
-Any relatively cheap and good for beginners brand recommendations?

Many thanks!"	t5_2qlrg	True
