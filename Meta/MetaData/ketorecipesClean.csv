1364226560.0	1az87i	MODERATOR ANNOUNCEMENT: Please supply recipes with every post! (Upvote this, I don't get karma!)	Noxrazi	1035	121	20	"Hey everyone! Please upvote this post (I do not receive karma for it).

I just wanted to make a few announcements regarding the rules of this subreddit. Lately we have been getting a lot of ""look what I'm having for breakfast/lunch/dinner"" and often times those posts do not have recipes. 

From time to time, we all want to share our beautiful and tasty meals (because keto is fuggin' awesome), but remember to share that joy with other ketoers and provide a recipe!

I understand that there are some ""recipes"" that are really just a few ingredients tossed in a pan or on a plate, but we could at least use an ingredient list and the method of cooking (was it sauteed, what temperature, how long, did you broil it afterwards, etc...?).

We want to maintain this subreddit as a recipe collection!

So please, if you submit a post to this subreddit, follow these rules:

1. ***Provide a recipe***
2.  If the recipe is not yours, please post your recipes as a link to the source or original post
3.  Include nutritional information if it is available to you ([MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/recipe/calculator) is a great place to generate nutritional information for recipes)
4.  Avoid posting simply what your meal plans are for the day, unless they have accompanying recipes
5. Remember what foods and ingredients are acceptable on the [ketogenic diet;](/r/keto) we have to remove some posts from time to time that have non-keto-friendly ingredients in them (sugar, potatoes, etc...).
6. If your recipe is just a few meats and vegetables tossed in a pan, try to provide an ingredient list, the method of cooking (sauteed, fried, broiled, etc...) and the temperature/amount of time necessary to make the dish.
7. **EDIT: If you purchased a good keto-friendly snack, please be sure to note which store you bought it from and any other information that may be necessary for other ketoers to locate the product**

And this last one is optional, but would help us a lot:

*   Report posts if they do not have recipes, that way they won't show up on the subreddit until OP provides a recipe.

There are still some discrepancies on snack foods being posted as recipes here, and we're not entirely sure how to handle these ones - ***do you guys as a whole like seeing things about new snacks (like ginger-lemon coconut oil, or a newfangled low-carb chocolate bar) show up occasionally?*** They're not technically recipes, but they are good foods to snack on if you have a place to purchase them."	t5_2t46o	True

1372985329.0	1hnyod	Hey guys! We are getting close to 20,000 subscribers and I think we should go over a few things...	Time_Code	178	42	10	"First, I just want to say thanks to everyone who has contributed to this community, you guys are doing an awesome job keeping this place active.


Second, we are getting close to 20,000 subscribers and I think we may need to go over some rules again...


*  Please remember that to keep this community going, we need to post recipes.  If you made something really awesome and decided to take a picture of your creation and you want to share it without a recipe attached, you should post to /r/FoodPorn or maybe we can post to /r/ketoporn? Haha.  Otherwise post a recipe along with your picture.


* We have been removing comments lately that have been pretty rude.  If you don't like something that someone made, keep scrolling.  No need to harass people over a recipe you thought looked disgusting.  Please be polite. 


* Not everyone is a chef, there are a lot of people who have started this diet who haven't really cooked much in their lives.  Please try your best to be as descriptive with your recipes as you can don't just put something like, ""I put garlic, onion powder, olives, beef and sour cream into a dish and that's how I created a taco bowl!""  Gives us more than that, it would help a ton!  


*  If you found your recipe from a blog/user, make sure you credit the user/blog by linking your post to the source, you can leave recipe in comments along with a picture of what you made.


Thank you everyone, keep posting!

1371562630.0	1gl069	Keto Diet Helper Website	kieble	119	18	62	"Hey all,
So I have been looking around at different webpages that help with coming up with recipes for different diets, and using specific ingredients and I couldn't seem to find one that did both.

So in my spare time I have been working on a website that has these features:

 * Login for users to retain information
 * Search for recipes that include (X) ingredients
 * Search for recipes that are part of (Y) diet 
 * Search for recipes that are part of (X ingredients and (Y) diet
 * Keep a list of what you have in your pantry, that can show what can be made from your panty
 * Allow for upvote / downvote of recipes to get the ""best of the best""
 * Sure I'll think of other features in the future

Now I had some intersted when i first proposed the idea, but now that I have some structure to it, I was wondering if anyone would be intersted in helping with the Testing / Development of it.  I'll do the coding (unless you're a programmer too, which would be awesome), but I need a second persons review of ""Hey that feature sucks, and this other one works, and you should add this!""  My creativity has been drained as I implement my new ideas, and I'm looking for an outside view.

You can see the prototype here:

http://kinnett.us/diet/public/index.php 

I'll buy a public domain once I get the site up and running, but I'm just looking for some people that would be interested in giving feed back, adding recipes, and testing features.

If you are I can contact you in PM, e-mail, whatever you'd like.  The more the merrier!


Edit: 

Since I've recieved a lot of feedback about wanting to help, i've created a subreddit where i'll be posting specific information and requesting bugs to be posted, and feature requests.  It can be found at /r/diethelpers

To do list:

* Add in Calories, Proteins, Carbs, and Fibers to address low cal and keto diets more accurately.  I'll do the calculation by the ingredients inputted so the user won't have to put any calorie information in.
* Get the myPantry up and working!
* Add Recipe printer
* Add nutrient limitations
* Sub recipes for swapping out different ingredients"	t5_2t46o	True

1 Egg

2 tsp Psyllium Husk (optional)

~3 Tbsp almond meal (35 g)

1 dash of salt

1 dash of baking powder

1 Tbsp of Coconut oil or 2 Tbsp of heavy cream

Combine ingredients in a cup of your choosing. Use the almond meal to get the texture right...you want a kind of heavyish porridge. Ideally, you think ""if I put any more meal in, it'll clump together"". Stir well. When you're done the cup is about half full.

Put the cup into the microwave, nuke on high for 2-3 minutes; you should see the bun try to rise above the cup, which is normal and completely okay. Upend the cup and behold sort of a rolled bun. Eat!

You'll need: a head of broccoli, butter, and a box of Boursin cheese of your preference (1g carb for 2tbsp. We will be using 1-2 tbsp. I use the garlic and shallot flavour).

1. Haphazardly cut your broccoli into florets
2. Start a pan going on the stove (I used my wok) and put a HEALTHY chunk of buttter it, simmer on medium-low. Don't be shy with the butter
3. Once your butter is melted and goldeny, add your broccoli
4. Let that simmer in the luscious butter until desired tenderness (~10mins)
5. Once it's good enough to eat, turn off the heat and stir in 1-2tbsp of your boursin. Keep stirring til all the florets are well-cheesed

Hopefully you all will not only like, but LOVE this hot chocolate recipe. Now that fall is upon us and its getting a little cooler, its time to break out the hot coco! I found a recipe and tweaked it to my own standards, and I will just say now, that you can play with the proportions of things ( sweeter/less sweet; more chocolately/less chocolately) You get the idea.
This is bascially my *base* recipe:

-1 c. Unsweetened Almond Milk
-1/2 c. Heavy Cream
-1 tbs. Cocoa Powder
-1/4 tsp. Vanilla
-1/4 tsp. Cinnamon
-1 tbs. Splenda 
-1/8 tsp Mint Extract (optional)

First heat the Almond milk and heavy cream until it starts getting warm, then toss in the remaining ingredients and stir constantly with a wire whisk. Do not let it get to a boil as it wil scorch the bottom of the pan and also create a lot of foam. I kept in around 7-8 on an electric stove. Once its hot to your liking, pour and ENJOY!!! :)

**A little bit of Sugar free whipped cream topping (from the spray can)

http://www.amazon.com/100-Whey-Protein-EAS-Resealable-Chocolate/dp/B003UPOK58/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hpc_2
It's $50, but free prime shipping on amazon and it makes 75 servings, so a good deal. There's also $20 tubs.

- 1 scoop EAS Chocolate 100% Whey Protein (2 net carbs) 
- 12oz of unsweetened Silk almond milk 
- 1/2 c of heavy whipping cream (store brand) 
- 1 tbs truvia/stevia
- 2 tbs Nestle toll house cocoa (4 net carbs)

[we use cocoa, not another scoop of EAS because it's less expensive, and he likes the more choc flavor even though another EAS scoop would be 2 less carbs.]

-and that's it. :) 
Ours comes to a total of **6 Net carbs** for a full blender ball canister -approx 16 oz- of creamy chocolate shake!!

obviously, coconut oil or natural pb.. etc..  can be added for more healthy fat, and other tweaks can be made, but I wanted to keep it simple for him. A perfect everyday breakfast/meal replacement shake is what he said it would take for him to go keto, and I did it!!

1. Heat up a pan with a few tablespoons of olive oil, and one tablespoon of butter. 


2. Crush up some pork rinds, once crushed, add equal parts parmesan cheese (I use the shakey, comes in a bottle in the condiments section kind)


3. Coat your chicken breasts in a bit of mayo, then press them into the pork rind/cheese coating


4. Put them in the pan once it's hot. Put a lid over them so they cook quicker, flipping occasionally. 


5. Once the crust is nice and brown, and your chicken is cooked through, put some nice mozzarella on top of them and stick the pan back on. Turn the heat down/off, and let the cheese melt. 


6. Take out of pan, and top with tomato salad bruschetta. I used Classico extra garlic bruschetta. 0.5 carbs per tablespoon.

I realized I was craving something sweet and salty. 

Here's what I came up with:

I cooked a piece of bacon in a frying pan to make the pan all greasy, then I cut up a pork chop into 1"" cubes, seasoned them lightly with salt and pepper and threw those into the pan. I added some green onions when the pork was almost done cooking for some added flavor. 
When it was all done cooking I transferred all the food to a plate mixed a tablespoon of sugar free strawberry jelly with the pork chop pieces. 

If you let the jelly melt a little bit from the heat coming off the pork, it will mix with the salt and make a delicious sweet and salty sauce.

The database opens up to this form: 

[Keto Recipes](https://docs.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/forms/d/10LsB7DmHWJofg_Qyoewgwf4oKygpmHbTJ5KJZpnNARQ/viewform)

If I find a recipe I like, I take all the information you lovely folks provide and stick it in the fields. Easy Peasy.

That form dumps into this spreadsheet:

[Keto Recipes sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgkSIOyv20HMdHhXSENnWWhpRUFCVmtHcmJrNmxfcmc&amp;usp=sharing)

That has a list of all of my recipes I've logged in (It's meager right now...)

The awesome part of the sheet is I can search for a given recipe, or I can have it show only, say breakfast recipes if I need something for a certain meal.

It's pretty easy to make in Google Docs if you have a gmail account. All you do is make a FORM, and when you fill out your fields, you tell it to dump all the results into a spreadsheet. I'd be more than willing to help anyone out if they need it."	t5_2t46o	True

It's not new, it's been posted on /r/keto before. Take a hot dog, slice it lengthwise to create a pocket, stuff with a thin sliver of cheddar and stuff with well-drained sauerkraut. Wrap that bad boy with bacon (about 3 slices per dog when I make them, I seal in that sauerkraut and cheese) and grill until the bacon is done to your liking. 

If the concept takes off, we can schedule a weekly post featuring an ingredient, cooking method (i.e. grilling) or holiday/occasion theme.

This should serve at least 3-4 people. It makes a large or *extra* large pizza depending on how thin you spread the crust before cooking. It is also extra filling due to all the cheese. I made a regular frozen pizza for my non-keto boyfriend at the same time and he ended up scarfing down a couple of my slices because it was better than his. I also warmed up leftovers in the microwave today (made it 2 days ago) and it was still awesome!


Based on the recipe in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/n86ib/i_just_made_a_keto_pizza_crust_that_eats_like_a/) by [Airtech77](http://www.reddit.com/user/Airtech77) with just a couple of modifications (oven bake crust, no baking powder..)


Measurements are approximate, but it's not a difficult recipe. You should be successful even if you give or take a bit.


**You will Need:**

* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (I added a bit of colby jack and parmesan as well)
* ~3 tblsp almond meal
* 1 large egg
* 1 tblsp Italian seasoning
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* Pepper/other seasonings to taste
* Your preferred sauce/toppings


**How:**

* Preheat oven to 450°F
* In a large bowl, add your cheeses and microwave for about a minute and a half, until the cheese is melted. WATCH THE CHEESE. If it gets too bubbly, I suspect it will get hard or rubbery. You want a doughy consistency.
* While the cheese is hot, add in almond meal 1 tblsp at a time and incorporate with a fork. I probably actually used more than 3 tblsp in the end. You're really just doing this for texture, so add to taste and experiment with other low carb flours and meals!
* Once it has cooled down a bit, add in your egg and spices and start mixing well with your hands.
* Grease or spray a large baking sheet or pizza pan.
* Spread your crust mixture fairly thin and into an approximate pizza shape. It should hold this shape while cooking.
* Pop it in the oven for about 6-7 minutes or until golden brown. It will be puffy, gorgeous, and it will TOTALLY look like a real deal pizza crust after baking.
* Pull it out of the oven, loosen from the pan with a spatula, and stick it in the fridge or freezer until it is room temperature or cooler.
* Add sauce and toppings to taste. I found that Walmart's Great Value pizza sauce doesn't have any added sugar and has about ~4carbs per serving, I think? Whatever, I'm broke.
* Bake or broil for another few minutes, until it looks done. I can't presume to tell you what your pizza cooking preferences are. If you broil, make sure to watch it. My crust ended up a little *extra* brown because I wanted PIZZA. NOW. Still good, though.

*1 Cup Mozzarella Cheese
*1/2 Cup Cheddar Cheese
*1 large dollop Cream Cheese ( about 3ish tablespoons)
*1/2 Cup Almond Meal
*1/2 cup Flax Meal
*1 Large Egg

Heat oven to 425. Melt cheese in a microwave in a large bowl. Once melted, quickly stir in the rest of the ingredients. Once thoroughly mixed, line a pan in butter to prevent sticking. Push dough mixture in pan until a nice even thin layer forms. Bake until edges start to brown. After crust is done load up with you choices of toppings and sauce. Bake again until cheese is bubbly. 

For an extra crispy crust, remove from pan and lay on top shelf while cooking toppings. Feel free to modify and post your results! Enjoy!"	t5_2t46o	True

* 2 heads of cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets
* 1 cup sliced celery
* 1/2 c. cut-up scallions
* 4-5 thinly sliced radishes
* 2 Tbsp. snipped fresh parsley
* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 1 Tbsp. vinegar
* 1 Tbsp. whole-grain mustard
* 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard (smooth)
* 1/2 tsp. celery seeds
* 2 tsp. salt
* 1/8 tsp. fresh-ground pepper

Boil cauliflower in lightly salted water for 10 minutes or so, until fork-tender but not mushy. Drain and allow to cool.

Toss cauliflower, celery, and radishes together. In a separate bowl, mix together remaining ingredients until fully combined to form dressing. Mix dressing into cauliflower mixture until evenly distributed. For best results, allow the salad to sit for 3-4 hours or overnight before serving.

Recipe can be halved with no ill effects, but it goes quickly so I recommend making the full amount!

1372638651.0	1he8mt	Keto Mint Dark Chocolate Almond Ice Cream	ketosaves	83	15	12	"Hey all, I posted a while ago looking for ice cream recipes... and actually discovered that the recipes in my ice cream maker's recipe booklet were easily adapted to keto. I thought I'd share!

After experimenting a bit, I give you... my mint dark chocolate almond ice cream!

* 2 cups heavy (35%) cream
* 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (you can also use whole milk, I just happened to have almond milk in the house)
* 3/4 cup granulated erythritol (picked because I don't find it to have any aftertaste at all, I'm sure you could substitute if it's not your thing)
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* Peppermint extract to taste (about 0.5 tbsp)
* 6 squares Lindt 85% dark chocolate
* 1/3 cup almonds
* 1/4 cup vodka

Step 1: Chop up dark chocolate and almonds in a food processor.

Step 2: Add cream, almond milk, extracts, and erythritol to a small saucepan. Cook on low heat until the erythritol dissolves - you'll be able to tell when you scoop some of the mixture with a spoon and you don't see the granulated erythritol and don't hear it grinding against your spoon in the pot as you stir. (NOTE: this step is NECESSARY - no matter how well I mixed, if I didn't apply a bit of heat I had ""crunchy"" ice cream).

Step 3: Chill in the fridge for 2 hours or overnight.

Step 4: Turn on ice cream maker and use to manufacturer's directions. Mine normally takes about 25 minutes. About 5 - 10 minutes before the ice cream should be done, add your chopped chocolate/almonds.

Step 5: Right before the ice cream is done, slowly add the vodka - this will keep it from becoming an impenetrable chunk of ice in the freezer. If the addition of the vodka makes the consistency of the ice cream more liquid-y again, that's fine - just let it churn for another 10 to 15-ish minutes and it'll be back at the ready consistency.

Step 6: Eat or freeze. Your call.

Makes 6 servings.
Each serving has 407 calories, 36g fat, 5g protein, 4g net carbs (even less if you're not counting the erythritol - this count does include)

With the addition of the vodka, this ice cream is much more freezer-friendly and I only need to let it sit out for five minutes or less to be able to have it nice and soft in a bowl."	t5_2t46o	True

Crisy, delicious carnitas that melts in the mouth! I don't have photos but it looks a little like [this.](http://ourlifeinfood.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/carnitas.jpg?w=409&amp;h=614)

Step 1. Slow cook a pork shoulder: 8hrs on low in a crockpot or slow cooker filled with beer/cola/chicken broth, or if you don't have slow cooking facilities try a 'roast pork shoulder' recipe in your oven, like [this one](http://buttoni.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/roasted-montreal-pork-shoulder/).

Step 2. Once the meat is cooked and tender, break it apart into chunks with a fork. You probably want to only set aside 1lb of meat or so for now, as this recipe is best fresh. 

Step 3. Melt 3 Tbsp butter in a frying pan at high heat, and throw the shredded pork in.

Step 4. Add the following to the pan:

* 1 Tbsp kosher salt
* 2 Tbsp hot sauce (Tapatio is best)
* 1 Tsp cilantro (dried or fresh)
* 1 Tsp ground cumin
* Juice from 1/2 of a lime
* Handful of chopped onion (optional)

Step 5. Stir occasionally until desired level of crispiness is attained - I did mine for around 8 minutes and it was super crispy. 

Step 6. Serve with low carb tortillas (or salad) and guacamole (mash up an avocado with salt and lime juice and you're done)

Honestly, this recipe is pretty simple but I was stunned by the results - I live near a lot of Mexican-run taquerias and this stuff outclasses them by far.  And don't even talk to me about Chipotle - their soggy pork is an abomination by comparison."	t5_2t46o	True

Batter turned out amazing, I would use this recipe over floured batter.
Almond meal, 2 eggs, water, a bit of cream for flavor and a teaspoon of baking soda. I didn't measure when I made it, so play around. Consistancy should be pretty goopy. Cube some chicken breast and season to taste, deep fry and enjoy!

Edit: Hey guys sorry about being shit with the proportions, I just didnt note down how much I was putting in. I'm going to remake a small amount tonight with dinner and I'll get you all an exact recipe! Sorry again dudes!

I haven't had any cravings but I have been a little sad that I can't partake in Easter candy this year. Luckily, my super supportive boyfriend was sweet enough to make me a keto version of my favorite: Reese's Eggs! If you're like me and you're sad you can't hop on the Easter Candy train, here is the super simple recipe!

- 3 tbsp natural peanut butter (he used Smucker's chunky)
- 3.5 tbsp almond flour 
- 6 packets of Stevia (adjust according to taste)
- 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1.5 tbsp coconut oil
- 1.5 tbsp heavy cream
- Drops of liquid Stevia to taste

1. Mix together the peanut butter, stevia, and almond flower until you get a thick, kind of crumbly, texture. 
2. Form the dough into egg shapes (he made 4 large ones) onto parchment paper then freeze 1 hour.
3. Melt together the cocoa powder, coconut oil, and whipping cream together in the microwave or over the stove. Add a few drops of liquid stevia to taste.
4. Take the eggs out of the freezer, one at a time, and dip into the chocolate. *he placed the eggs into the bowl of chocolate and rolled it around with a fork. 
5. When all eggs are coated, place in freezer until frozen; 10-15ish minutes.

So I just thought I would share with everyone else. Note that obviously none of these are no-carb, but if you eat these deserts in moderation and only on days when your carb count is low, you should be fine.

1. Strawberry Ice Cream - this isn't ice cream, more like a thick smoothie, but whatever I don't have an ice cream maker so this is the best I can do. I mix about a half cup of heavy cream with 3-4 frozen strawberries, as well as a little bit of sweetner (optional) and a tiny bit of vanilla. Blend it all up in the blender -- soooo good strawberries and cream!

2. No-Bake Cheesecake - I altered the cheesecake recipe that comes on the back of the Knox Unflavored Gelatin box. Basically you take the unflavored gelatin and mix it with the boiling water, like it says on the box, plus the sweetner (I use splenda). Then you take 1 package of cream cheese (room temp) and beat that until creamy. Add some vanilla, and maybe a bit of lemon juice, and some more splenda if you want. Then slowly add the gelatin to the cream cheese. It will be quite thin. Put the bowl in the fridge or freezer for a little while to firm up. In the mean time, make a low carb crust using almond meal and butter and splenda if you want. After ~10 mins in the freezer or ~30 mins in the fridge, take out the mixture and stir it up. It should be much thicker now. Pour it into the crust, or into whatever dish you want to keep it in, and throw it back in the fridge for at least 4 hours, although I generally leave it overnight. A few weeks ago I bought a can of pumpkin and mixed it in along with some pumpkin pie spices...soooo good!

3. Elephany Ears/Funnel Cake - I take a low carb wrap, and cut it into pie slices so there are eight little chips. Then I fry all of the chips. Then I dip the whole thing in butter. Then I sprinkle with splenda mixed with cinammin. Reminds me of an elephant ear. My low carb wraps only have 5 net carbs each, so I feel like you get a lot with this one :-)"	t5_2t46o	True

Chinese Cinnamon Beef soup recipe	WannaBeNord	74	11	9	"This is a recipe from one of my favorite Asian noodle cookbooks by Nina Simonds that I have altered a bit. It's super hearty and healthy and will keep you going for hours on those cold winter days. Also, it's really easy to make and yields lots of leftovers. Noodles are optional - I've been using fettucini-shaped shirataki noodles.

In a large pot:

Fry together till fragrant - 
1 tsp cooking oil
6 green onions, cut into 1-2 inch sections
6 cloves garlic, smashed and sliced
4 slices ginger, smashed slightly with flat of knife
1 1/2 tsp hot chile paste
2 cinnamon sticks
1 tsp anise seed

(you could also fry these in a pan and add to a spice basket to keep them from getting in your broth - you will discard the ginger and cinnamon sticks after cooking)

Add to the pot and bring to boil - 
8 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup soy sauce

Add and bring to boil again -
2 lbs chuck or beef stew meat, cut into bite-size cubes
5 dried shiitake mushrooms (soak in water before-hand and add the soaking water to the pot for flavor) - optional

Let simmer covered on low for 1 1/2 hours
Remove and discard ginger and cinnamon

At this point, it is ready to serve. The recipe says to add 10 oz. spinach and let boil.

I add as much spinach as I want to eat in that sitting and cook until it wilts.

Serve over shirataki noodles or just as a soup!

Reassemble every bowl of leftovers with fresh spinach and noodles.

* doner kebab meat with mint yogurt sauce
* baba ganoush with sujuk
* lamb tikka masala
* corned beef with saurkraut
* korma beef

**Recipe Doner kebab meat with mint yogurt sauce**- cut thin slices of meat of choice around 1 inch in width. Place in plastic bag and smash with a hammer to get super thin. Layer thin slices onto a skewer, as many as will fit, really squeezing them together. Marinade in cinnamon, cumin, allspice, garlic, nutmeg and salt. Place skewer unto a baking rack and bake at 350 F turning every 5 minutes or so. Timing depends on thickness of meat (usually 15-20 minutes). Mix plain yogurt with mint and sere as a sauce.

**baba ganoush with sujuk** Mix ground meat of choice (traditional is lamb and beef, I even use pork) with paprika, cumin, salt and red pepper. Roll into small balls and cook on skewers in the oven. For good baba ganoush slice eggplant around 1/2 inch thick and salt sweat them out. Add salt then pat the bitter juices off with paper towel later. This is very important for good eggplant. Roast eggplant with olive oil in the oven until soft and cooked. Blend well with sour cream, tahini, garlic, salt and lemon juice. One can make their own tahini (blended sesame seeds) but this is a huge pain in the ass and is easy to find.

**lamb tikka masala** I cheat and buy Shan's spice packet of masala, I blend it with yogurt, cilantro leaves and canned tomatoes to make a sauce. I pour this over my meat and slow cook it in. Same idea with the korma, spice packet+tomatoes then serve with yogurt sauce."	t5_2t46o	True

The texture of these cookies is not the best, but these snapped me out of my craving.

You will need:

parchment paper  
a microwave  
 half-scoop protein powder (I used Isoflex peanut butter chocolate, use what you got!)  
1 tablespoon (15ml) butter  
1 teaspoon (5mL)Cocoa, if desired  
sweetener packet, if desired  
a scant tablespoon of water , maybe 10mL 

Get a small bowl and combine the ingredients together, and add water slowly. it should start to form a paste, and you want to be able to pick it up and form it into balls, so not too wet! 

Form into 2 small balls then press onto parchment and microwave for 15 seconds on high, directly on the floor or plate of the microwave. Wetter cookies will spread more

Eat with almond milk with a splash of cream. 
Craving averted!

[Then toss in ~~a little bit~~ a fuckton of mozzarella and parmesan cheese](http://imgur.com/8Jf3S) 

[Reduce it down,](http://imgur.com/yYIKB) a good rule of thumb is if you can swipe your sauce and you can see the bottom of the pan, then it has reduced enough.

I'm lazy and usually look at a recipe on my computer, then wander over to my kitchen and approximate it. If it's not perfect, I tinker. So I was inspired by this recipe over at [I breathe... I'm hungry.](http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/2012/01/low-carb-rosemary-sea-salt-flax.html)




Preheat oven to 400 on bake setting


1 cup flax seeds (whole),

1 egg,

1 tbsp oil (olive, canola, whatevs),

2 tbsp/enough almond meal, ground up sunflower seeds, or coconut flour, or actual ground flax if you have it on hand, to hold it together, but not be too dry.

(optional) for savoury crackers, add Montreal Steak Spice or dried dill, or whatever tasty herbs and spices you have around. I like paprika.


I mix it all together. I roll it between two sheets of parchment paper with a bit of oil on them. I'm cheap and lazy so instead of going out and buying a rolling pin I just manipulate it with the palms my hands into an even thin layer. If I have enough for the pan I'm using, I can get square edges by butting it up against the sides of the pan, having enough parchment to fold over the top so none of the goo squeezes out between the layers. It takes a few minutes to smooth it into an even layer, about a 1/2 centimetre, or a little less, is best according to my experience. Ya follow me?

The thinner the layer, the crispier the crackers. Depending on your oven and how thin you make the sheet, you might need to bake it for only 5 or 10 minutes. You can take it out and flip the sheet over by holding the edges of the parchment paper if your oven has uneven heat. You'll know it's done when you lift the parchment paper and the edges of the flackers look a little dark and crispy. Once it's done remove the top layer of parchment and cut into cracker-sized pieces.  It's important to cut while it's still hot and pliable, or else if you try and cut it later it might break apart into shards.

The flackers are good, but essentially just a vehicle for my delicious [keto cinnamon spread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1eojoi/homemade_keto_cinnamon_spread/) or just some [cream cheese and cukes](http://instagram.com/p/X9DIwdDSCN/). They can be crumbly, or chewy, depending on your finesse in making them. I encourage experimentation and not rigid ""OH MY GOD I DIDN'T FOLLOW THE EXACT RECIPE"" freaky-outey behaviour. Fuck, have a little fun!

The are excellent if you're *ahem* a little *backed up* shall we say? Enjoy! And post any tasty upgrades or modifications for others to see and try :)

**Ingredients**

* 1 pat of unsalted butter
* 2 slices bacon
* 1 egg (2 if you want it heartier/eggier)
* 2 tablespoons cream cheese
* 2 tablespoons Cool Whip
* 10 raspberries

Optional:

* Coffee
* 1/4 cup Almond milk

**Recipe**

* Fry up the bacon!
* Pop the cream cheese into the microwave to warm up (20 sec) in a microwavable bowl
* Whisk the egg(s) and cream cheese together
* Melt butter on different skillet 
* Pour egg and cream cheese mixture on skillet
*Cook and flip (~2 min per side)
* Spread the Cool whip and raspberries on the 'crepe' and enjoy!

You could make this more hardcore keto with 2 eggs, and maybe less cream cheese/cool whip but damn this taste good!

[Picture inside!]"	paranoidhandroid	61	6	11	"Keto has forced me to do something I've never thought of doing: cook for myself. Being in college with a 9am-9pm schedule, on top of a major performance on the way, on top of trying to get my weight down, the obstacle of cooking had become a legitimate fear of mine. 

This was one of the first recipes I had created when I was heavily craving Macaroni and Cheese (a major trigger food for me). I make enough to last me about 4 days, because no one has enough time to make this every day!

* **Ingredients** 

* 2 bags of broccoli florets (I microwave it because college)
* 2 jars of Ragu Double Cheddar sauce
* Half a stick of salted butter
* 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar
* 1/2 cup of shredded habanero jack cheese (Tillamook makes the best, but pepperjack works well too if you don't have access to the habanero kind)
* 2 healthy tablespoons of full-fat sour cream
* 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning
* 1 pound of ground beef, 80/20
* 2 Tablespoons of pimentos (I like to use the jarred ones)
* salt and pepper to taste

* **Cooking Directions**
* Start by melting the butter in a large pan with the cajun seasoning and the salt and pepper.
* Once the butter is melted, add in the lovely ground beef and cook on high until it's all browned.
* Strain all the drippings, so you don't have a mealy cheese sauce
* Add the two jars of cheese sauce, cheeses, sour cream, and pimentos to your browned beef. Mix all of it together on Medium heat to melt the cheese without burning it. 
* Once the cheese is melted, I like to let the beefy sauce simmer on low while I microwave the broccoli. I used Bird's Eye SteamFresh and took me a total of 10 minutes to cook 2 bags.
* Once the broccoli is all cooked, I like to cut the florets into smaller pieces so it feels like I have more to eat. 
* Add the broccoli to the rest of the mix, stir, then portion it all out to make 8 servings! 

* **Time: 30 minutes for prep and cooking.**

* **1/8 of this concoction:**

* 456.75 total calories
* 35.25g total fat
* 13.5g saturated fat
* **7.75g net carbs**
* 19.625g protein

I've tried cream cheese ones, I've tried the infamous cottage cheese one, you name it but they all came out more like crepes. Very flat, very eggy, and not like fluffy, cakey pancakes. So, I tried my hand at my own, and after only a couple tries, I've managed to make a low carb pancake recipe to give regular pancakes a run for their money.


**Coconut Flour Pancakes**

* 6 eggs
* 1/4 cup coconut flour
* 1 TBSP heavy cream
* Pinch of Nutmeg
* Pinch of Cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 15-20 drops of EZ Sweetz/Liquid Sucralose (I like sweeter pancakes, because I feel less inclined to put a lot of topping on it, so feel free to use less sweetener of your choice)

Combine all ingredients in a bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Grease (I put a small amount of butter before every pancake) and heat up a pan, and scoop out the batter using a 1/4 cup. This batter isn't quite as liquidy as normal pancake recipes, so with the 1/4 cup (or a spoon) I gently spread out the batter on the pan so that it made a nice good sized pancake. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, and then flip, and do the same. 

I've made this recipe twice, and was able to yield 7 four inch pancakes each time.

I was struggling to get all my fiber through greens, so I looked for flax meal recipes, leading me to this. Feel free to mess around with the amount of flax, and fat content. 


* 1/2 cup flax meal

* 1 tablespoon butter

* 1 egg 

* Pinch of sea salt

Melt butter in microwave 10 seconds, then mix in remaining ingredients well. Pat down in bowl to make a flat top. Cook in microwave 60-90 seconds. It should come right out. Cut in half to make 'bread'.

You can make this sweet or savory depending on how you modify the base recipe. I omit baking powder since its awful for you and unneeded. Most recipes add it. 

Basic nutritional breakdown:

**Calories:** 390

**Fat:** 33g

**Protein:** 18g

**Fiber:** 16g

**Net carbs:** 0

Depending on what you add, this will change obviously. Adds a punch of omega-3 (ala), lignans, fiber and a bready texture. A great remedy for some keto flu symptoms. Also a cheaper way of getting fiber, rather than solely through greens.

Edit:  I should note I got the nutritional info from mfp so creating your own standard recipe will yield a different nutritional profile. I use bobs red mill for flax meal. "	t5_2t46o	True

1372012697.0	1gx55m	Keto Ice Cream! 3.6 carbs	BeffyLove	54	2	22	"Ingredients: 

*1/2 cup heavy cream

*1/4th teaspoon vanilla extract

*1 tablespoon sugar equivalent (I used a carb-free sugar but you can use whatever you want)

Also needed:

*1 Gallon-size ziploc bag

*1 pint-size (Sandwich) ziploc bag

*Ice cubes

*6 tablespoons rock salt (I used Kosher salt and only used 3 tablespoons of it. I'm sure you could also use regular salt.)

Directions:

1. Fill the gallon bag about half full of ice and add the salt
2. Combined milk, vanilla and sugar equivalent in the sandwich baggy and seal it well
3. Put the small bag with the cream mixture in the larger bag with the ice and seal the larger bag
4. Shake until it reaches desired consistency. Took me about 5 minutes
5. Make sure you wipe/rinse off the top of the smaller bag before you open it or you'll get salt ice cream! It was easier for me to just cut a hole in the bottom corner of the bag and squeeze out the ice cream. Even if I did accidentally squirt half of it on my foot...

Enjoy! :D I'm sure you could also add some cocoa powder, peanut butter, sugar-free strawberry syrup. Finally some good keto ice cream, that's easy peasy! :)"	t5_2t46o	True

I've been drinking these far too often, but they are soooo good, and filling too.	grodon909	62	7	20	"I basically adjusted [this](http://www.lowcarbfriends.com/recipereview/showproduct.php/item/2314_stacyspace%20McDonald%27s%20Shamrock%20Shake) for my needs.

* Some ice cubes (I use around a cup, but mine don't pack well)
* 1-2 Tbs Heavy cream. 
* ~12 Oz unsweetened Almond milk. More or less depending on how much you want.
* roughly 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
* Some DaVinci's Sugar Free Vanilla syrup (I just add whatever I feel like)
* maybe 1/8-1/4 cup of erythiol and 2 drops of stevia. Just guess, make it how you like. 
*optional: 3 drops green food coloring (this is actually from the website, I don't have food coloring, but it probably can't hurt).

Instructions:
Put everything in blender. Blend until its smooth. Drink

If i'm counting correctly, that maxes out at around 130 cals, 125 of which are fat, and 1g carbohydrates (1 fiber gram, so that's 0 net carbs). The only thing I'd worry about is that the syrup says that it is sweetened with splenda, so that might add a couple extra carbs. Either way, very low carb and not too bad on the calories if you want a little sweet snack.  http://imgur.com/382NGqp

EDIT: Also, I occasionally adjust the recipe a little bit incase it's the end of the day, I'm hungry, and I didn't eat a lot of fats. I add a little more cream and instead of syrup, I use peanut butter (maybe 2 Tbs), a dash of cinamon, and a few shredded pieces of chocolate. The PB adds like 4 carbs, but also like 16g more fat. It also has more calories, so I don't usually make it unless I get hungry late at night while studying and need the fat. Its a very easy recipe to edit.

1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Coconut milk is high in fat and low in both protein and carbs and a good replacement for milk/cream. Careful, though - every brand has a different composition of macronutrients. I've seen some with 1g carbs/100ml and some with 5g. 

For my coconut shake I use 200ml of *unrefrigerated* coconut milk. Shake well before opening the can. I love adding frozen strawberries or blueberries - you don't have to, though. Some orange oil or vanilla extract makes the whole shake even tastier. Add 4-8 ice cubes (depending on whether you use frozen fruits or not) and blend well. 

If you need extra protein add some protein powder. Also tastes great with cocoa, vanilla or peppermint (!).

    8-10 Pieces Chicken [Tenderloin]
    1 C Coconut Flour (I only ended up using half)
    1 + 1/4 tsp baking powder
    Lotsa Salt &amp; Pepper
    3 Egg Whites
    Coconut Oil

    Serving Size: 2-3 pieces.

* Heat coconut oil to 360ish (as high as it can go before it starts smoking). Fill the skillet about an inch-but it ultimately depends on how thick the chicken you're using is. (You want it to go up the sides of the meat)

* Mix the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper together well. 

* Dip chicken in egg then coconut flour... and if you want more breading dip it back in egg and then back in flour. 

* Gently set the pieces in the oil, flip after 3-4 minutes. GENTLY. Oil is hot folks. (I did not splash oil on me! How dare you make that assumption.)

The breading resembles chik-fil-a without the pickle-y flavor. Trace amount of coconut in the taste. The more salt/pepper/seasoning added removes any resemblance of coconut. Fry at a higher temp with different oil for crispier chicken. 


**Note:** 5g Net carbs. Nutrition facts account for 8tbsp coconut flour, 5tbsp Coconut oil that I assumed actually stayed with the finished product.

I do this to give the chef some leeway in preparations to make it to their tastes. I have been eating this for about a week, nonstop. I love it and I think someone on here will enjoy it as well.

Ingredients: 

[Cauliflower Rice](http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/lowcarbsidedishes/r/caulirice.htm) - Approximately 3 cups

Chopped vidalia Onion - 1/3 to 1/2 cup

Eggs - 1 or 2 (your preference)

Bacon - About a half of a slab (anywhere from 6 - 10 oz)

Soy Sauce - To taste

Green onion - 1/3 cup (optional)


Directions -  
0. Cook the rice a the night before you make this dish. It works better. (Also, be sure to not over cook the cauliflower when making the rice. You don't want mushy rice, unless that's your thing. If so, go for it.)

2. Cut up the bacon into small pieces. maybe 1/2 inch long or so. 

3. Cook bacon until extra crispy, in large frying pan.

4. Remove bacon from pan and remove about 25-35% of the grease. (I use a wad of paper towels for this as it makes it a lot easier to control.)

5. Cook onions in bacon grease until close to being transparent.

6. Add cauliflower rice and egg(s).

7. Mix these items up, adding soy sauce along the way, until the rice seems to be getting nice and hot and eggs are cooked.

8. Add the cooked bacon (green onions/peas/whatever else) and mix everything up until its all nice and desegregated.

Hell, even if it isn't targeted at a low-carb diet, assume it has the amount of stated carbs + .49g per serving size.

Example: At 0g per serving size, [Aerosol Whipped Cream](http://www.landolakes.com/product/15104/aerosol-whipped-cream) seems like the answer to low carb prayers when you have a sweet tooth, so why not blast away until you're ~~disgusted~~ happy with yourself?

So you think to yourself ""sweet, I can eat this entire can of whipped cream (oh, come on; it's not as gross as it sounds) guilt-free since it has no carbs"". Then you read the label: The 2nd ingredient? Sugar. Chances are, that bottle has a half a carb per 2 tbsp. Eating the whole can might be a stretch, but let's say you mobbed a quarter of the can in a sweet-craving frenzy. You just downed 10g of carbs and you still think you're on 0.

1359346446.0	17erl3	I'm excited to share this: EASY pepperoni dip!	Macelink	54	7	7	"Didn't find this recipe when I searched. Made it tonight and it is heavenly and simple. 1/2 pound of pepperoni (I just bought a cheap half-pound pack at the grocery store) cut into small pieces. 1 8-oz. block of cream cheese. Put it all in a bowl, and microwave. At this point the cream cheese will be orange and look disgusting. But I swear to you. This is the most delicious keto thing I have ever eaten and I could eat the whole batch if left alone...

I use [this](http://buttoni.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/spicy-cheese-thins/) recipe for low-carb cheese crackers with this dip and I omit the cayenne pepper. I think they taste really great. Of course, you could always toast your favorite LC bread or other kind of cheese/keto crisps to use :)"	t5_2t46o	True

Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream
- 1-2 squares of dark chocolate (I used 85%)
- sweetener to taste (I used liquid malitol)

Technique:

1.  Microwave a few tablespoons of the whipping cream and the chocolate for 30 seconds to melt.  
2.  Add the rest of the cream and whip to combine (I used a little milk frother).  
3. Taste and add sweetener to your liking.  
4. Keep whipping until it thickens (looser than full-out whipped cream).
5.  Place in freezer and stir it every 15 minutes for around 45 minutes, scraping the hardened sides.  It is ready when you stir it and it looks like ice cream ;)

I have never made ice cream in my life and this was an experiment, and my non-keto ice cream loving husband has asked for it every night since.  You can make a larger batch of course using the same technique.  Tonight I'm going to try making vanilla ice cream.  And I know there are some issues with malitol, but my body handles it fine on keto so read up on it before you use it.  If you try it, let me know how it turns out.  Beware, this is a TREAT so please exercise portion control... Good luck ;)

1352398999.0	12v9fu	Keto friendly mounds bars/Almond Joys + how to add vanilla extract and liquid sweetener to melted chocolate with out it seizing up.	Bac0nLegs	54	8	28	"Okay, so, Halloween has passed, but my favorite candy in the WORLD are mounds/almond joy (Similarly, Bounty Bars in the UK), but they're definitely not keto friendly in any way....so I found a low carb recipe online, and decided to expand upon it, and make it better. I also found a way to incorporate vanilla extract and liquid sucralose into the melted chocolate with out it seizing up like it normally would when a small amount of moisture is introduced into melted chocolate.

[Home Made Mound/Almond Joy Bars](http://i.imgur.com/TxmzA.jpg)

* 5 Squares Bakers unsweetened baking chocolate
* 6 TBSP coconut oil
* 3 TBSP unsweetened coconut flakes (I used bob's red mill fine/small coconut flakes)
* 1 tsp coconut extract
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Liquid Sucralose (I found that truvia didn't mix well with chocolate, splenda has carbs and doesn't taste good when mixed with chocolate. EZ-Sweets tastes and works the best for me)
* 8 whole almonds (optional)

***Directions***

-Place 8 cupcake cups into a regular sized muffin pan and set aside.

-Place chocolate into a microwave safe bowl, and microwave at 30 second increments until fully melted.

-Take one small spoonful of melted chocolate and put it into a dry and clean shallow cup. Add desired amount of liquid sucralose (I used 8 drops of ez sweets, which gives you a really rich and dark chocolate flavor), and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Mix it all together until the chocolate seizes up (it'll have the texture of fudge, and won't be smooth and melted any more[Here's an example of seized vs properly melted](http://i.imgur.com/a7TlQ.jpg)). Make sure all the vanilla and liquid sucralose is completely mixed in.

-Add the seized chocolate to the bowl of melted chocolate and mix it in until fully incorporated. It'll take a minute or so, and you'll have to mash the seized chocolate into the side of the bowl to break it up to it mixes in completely. After a minute or so it'll be nice, smooth, and sweet chocolate. If it's not sweet enough for you, re-do this and the previous step.

-Spoon a thin layer of melted chocolate in to the 8 cupcake cups so that it lines the bottom and 1/2"" up the sides of each cupcake cup. Once complete, you should have 1/2 the melted chocolate remaining. Place the muffin pan in the fridge for 10-15 minutes until the chocolate is hard and completely set.

-Mix the coconut oil, coconut flakes, and coconut extract into a separate bowl.

-Once set, take muffin pan out of the fridge and spoon coconut mixture into each cup, divided evenly between the 8. Set in fridge for another 10-15 minutes.

-Once set, take out of fridge, (Place one almond on top of the coconut mixture if you desire an almond joy) and drizzle remaining melted chocolate over the top of the coconut mixture ensuring all gaps on the sides are filled. Place in fridge again until set and then enjoy!

It seems like a lot of steps, but it's VERY easy to do, and very VERY worth it. They're also very generous portions (I would say size equivalent to two fun sized candy bars)

* Calories: 195
* Carbs: 6g
* Fat: 21g
* Protein: 3g
* Fiber: 3g
* **Net Carbs: 3g**

Note: The original recipe called for 100g 86% dark chocolate bar and not only wasn't that enough for 8 servings, but it also had more carbs than I liked, so I decided to use [5 squares Baker's brand 100% unsweetened chocolate (chocolate pictured is 1 square broken into two)](http://i.imgur.com/TPH81.jpg) and add my own calorie and carb free sweetener, but I had to figure out a way to add the liquid with out ruining the chocolate. My little experiment worked perfectly  You can make chocolate bark, chocolate bars, chocolate anything this way, and not have to use splenda, or stevia, or any sweetener with carbs in it. 



Anyway, I tried to make this recipe as easy to follow as possible. The photo isn't mine, but they look exactly like that. I hope you guys enjoy!

When I decided to do keto, I knew I would miss my precious noodles the most... until I discovered spaghetti squash! I have totally found keto-friendly soul mate!

I have been making it at least once a week, it is so good and nips my pasta cravings in the bud!

I will share the recipe to tonight's delicious dinner, to help out any keto-ers missing their precious pasta.



Chicken-Cream Im-pasta :)

Take one medium sized spaghetti squash and cut it in half. Scoop out and toss the seeds. Drizzle the hollowed squash halves with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic salt and fresh pepper. Toss in an oven set to 350 F, hollow sides down, for 45 minutes. When finished, set out to cool for at least 10 minutes.

Cube up a couple chicken breast, season with salt and pepper, and pan fry in olive oil (or butter) until cooked through. Toss in a healthy scoop of Philadelphia Cooking Cream (I personally prefer the pesto one, but they are all good.)

While the cooking cream is melting into the chicken, use a fork to scrape the strings out of the cooled spaghetti squash. Toss the strings  into the chicken mixture and mix thoroughly.

That's about it! If you would like, spruce it up with some sun dried tomatoes, or roasted red peppers out of the jar. Sprinkle some Parm on top, and enjoy!"	t5_2t46o	True

BTW - I cheated by adding some spaghetti sauce to the pizza toppings but only about a tablespoon full. It doesn't take much and the pizza is great with or without the sauce. 

You don't need to use an entire block of cheese. Just use about as much as you would normally use to cover a pizza. You really only need enough to cover the pan after it's melted. 

http://imgur.com/q0jWmxP

2) Flipped over the cheese. You can tell it's done by looking at the edges. You can also lift a corner with a spatula. 

It's hard to flip when it's hot. I take it off the burner and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Then I grab the edges with my fingers, lift up one side and flip it over. Then put it back on the stove. 

Flipping over the cheese to cook the other side is optional. I like to do it because I think it makes the pizza crust a bit stiffer and the slices easier to eat with your hands. 

Or you can add the pizza toppings to one side and flip the cheese over it like a calzone.  

http://imgur.com/P8VT0oD

3) Toppings added and pizza is done! (I like to add a bit of extra cheese to the top)

You can pick it up and eat the slices with your hands. You need to fold the slices though. 

This pizza is about the size of a Totino's Party Pizza. 

IMO - It's just as good if not better than a regular pizza.

Basically you cook everything individually.

The noodles I followed the package's instructions

Chicken I cut up into small pieces, put some olive oil in a pan, seasoned, and flipped a bit till done.

The broccoli was frozen. I cut up the Red Pepper and steamed them both.

I shredded the cheese myself (small amount of carbs in per-shredded cheese!)

Cooked bacon in the over (400°F for 2O min or so)

-----------

When that was all done, preheat oven for 350°F.  I put in all the ingredients except for the cheese in a cake/casserole pan. Chicken, then bacon, then veggies, then covered with the Alfredo sauce. Put in oven. I would take out ever 5 min. and stir. After 15 I covered the top with the shredded cheese. Pull out when cheese is melted. Occasionally through the layers I sprinkled on Parmesan  cheese as well.

Perfect Cauliflower Macaroni and Cheese How-To

Serves 6


½ stick unsalted butter, plus more for dish

1cup heavy cream, 2oz cream cheese

¾ tsp guar gum

1 teaspoons kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

2 1/4cups grated sharp white cheddar

1 cups grated Gruyere or 1 1/4 cups grated pecorino Romano

1/2 lb cauliflower

Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a casserole dish; set aside.

Melt remaining 3 butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add guar gum. Cook, stirring, 30 secs-1 minute.

Slowly add cream into gum-butter mixture while whisking. Add cream cheese. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.

Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 1.5 cups cheddar, and 3/4 cups Gruyere. Set cheese sauce aside.

Steam cauliflower for 3-5 minutes, or until just tender but not completely done. Transfer the cauliflower to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well. Stir into the reserved cheese sauce.

Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cups cheddar and 1/4 cup Gruyere on top; (optional: scatter crushed pork rinds over the top).

Bake until browned on top, about 30 minutes (I put it back under the broiler to get the top nice and crispy) Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.

Notes: I adapted this recipe from Martha Stewart's Perfect Mac and Cheese, and have only made it once. It turned out great but here are some changes you may way to try: I used one head of cauliflower for this, I forgot to measure it out but I estimated 4 cups from it. The cheese sauce to cauliflower ratio was slightly off. When I first added the cheese sauce to the cauliflower it was pretty thick and didn't seem like enough to cover it all but after cooking it actually ended up being too much. So next time I will probably add a little almond milk to thin it out and increase the amount of cauliflower. Other than that it was amazing. You can also find this on MFP under the same recipe name.

Stuffed Pork Loin, Wrapped in Bacon
Prep time: 15 mins
Cook time: 45 mins
Total time: 60 mins

INGREDIENTS
- 2 Pork Tenderloins (Fresh or Thawed)

- 1 Package of Bacon (Thawed)

- ¾ Cup of Spinach (Fresh or Frozen – Thawed) * I used frozen – thawed for ours, as I always have it.

- ½ Cup of Cream Cheese (Room Temp)

- ½ Cup of Red Onions

- 1 Tbsp Bacon Bits

- 2 Tsp. Red Pepper Jelly

INSTRUCTIONS
- Preheat oven to 400F.

- Take the pork tenderloins, cut directly down the middle, so it’s almost as if you’re splitting it open. Continue to make cuts into the pork tenderloin, so it’s ‘butterflied’ open. Doesn’t need to be super thin, just enough that you can roll it when stuffed.

- Mix the filling ingredients (spinach, cream cheese, red onions, bacon bits, red pepper jelly) and spread within the pork tenderloin. I just did this by hand.

- Roll the tenderloin closed.

- Take the bacon and wrap it around the tenderloin in sections. If you’re skipping the bacon, move on to the next step.

- Wrap the tenderloin in tinfoil and place in a baking dish. The baking dish is to catch any grease or excess.

- Place in the oven and bake for 45 mins. I used a meat thermometer to get to an eternal temp of 160F. If you did wrap the tenderloin in bacon, unwrap the tenderloin at 30 mins and let the bacon-wrapped tenderloin crisp up for the last 15 mins.

- Enjoy!

Not the prettiest picture, my apologies.  I will never have a career as a food photographer.

Earlier this week, I had a real craving for both thai iced tea and and ice cream, so I decided to combine the two keto-style. And since I was in a decadent mood, I decided to make it a frozen custard.  And the result exceeded all of my expectations.

This recipe makes about a quart of frozen custard that I split into 4 servings.  

Nutrition in 1/4 of the recipe:  366 calories, 37.8 g of fat, 3.3 net carbs (3.7 carbs - 0.4 g of fiber), and 4.2 g of protein.  

**Ingredients**

-1.5 cups of unsweetened almond milk 

-1.5 cups of heavy cream

-3 egg yolks

-0.5 cup of thai tea (actual tea leaves)

-Couple of drops of liquid stevia (I used NuNaturals and just made it as sweet as I wanted it to be)

**Instructions**

1.  Heat the almond milk over medium flame.  Just as it begins to simmer, remove it from the heat.

2.  Stir the tea leaves into the heated almond milk and allow it to steep.  I let mine steep for an hour but you can steep for less time.

3.  After steeping, drain the tea in a sieve or strainer.  I just put a piece of cheese cloth in the mouth of a funnel, washed my hands, and wasn't afraid to squeeze some of the tea out.  Discard the tea leaves.

4.  Add the almond milk tea and 1 cup of heavy cream back into the pan and heat over medium heat until the mixture is just steaming.  Turn off the flame and add your sweetener. 

5.  In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks together.

6.  Temper the egg yolks by adding a small amount of the heated tea mixture to the yolks very slowly while whisking vigorously.  Do this really slowly b/c you don't want to cook your yolks.  Then you can slowly incorporate the rest of the heated tea into the yolks while continuing to whisk.

7.  Pour the mixture back into the pan you've been using and stir continuously over medium heat.  When making custard, you're supposed heat it until it reaches *nappe* consistency where the mixture coats the back of your spoon.  But my custard never quite got to that point, maybe because of the almond milk or i just wasn't patient enough?? Either it didn't make a difference in the end.  I probably stirred my mine over the heat for ~10-12 mins??

9.  Remove the pan from the heat, pour the custard in a bowl with the remaining heavy cream, and stir it all together.  

10.  Strain the custard.  This allows for a smoother texture, but you don't necessarily have to do so. 

11.  Stir custard again and let it cool.  I  created an ice bath and once it was no longer hot, I put the custard in the freezer for a minutes for it to chill completely.

12.  Churned it in my ice maker for 20ish minutes. 

Then my non-keto mom and I bugged out at how rich and delicious it was.

250 grams of butter
1 cup Almond meal
200 grams any dark chocolate, at least 70 percent cocoa
 4 tbs coco powder
3/4 cup natvia or equivalent, alternatively sweeten as you like
4 large eggs
1 tps baking powder
250 grams cream cheese

STEPS:
1. Soften cream cheese and using an electric mixer, whip it with the sweetener till well incorporated and smooth. (The mixture doesn't go fluffy, really)
2. In a separate bowl, melt all the butter and chocolate together.
3. Add  in the eggs, one at a time into the cheese mixture.
4. Making sure the chocolate and butter mixture isn't too hot, incorporate this into the  cheese mixture. 
5. Add in the almond meal, coco powder, and baking powder into the mix and fold in. 
6.  Line a baking tray and fill it with the mix. Bake at 175 degrees Celsius  for 30 minutes   Lowe the heat down to 170 or 165 if the top starts to burn. When a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean, remove from oven and cool. 


 These brownies are best refrigerated and do have a slight cheesecakey taste. I use natvia for baking as it doesn't have that after  taste that regullar stevia has. I use  70 percent cocoa chocolate when I make this which is  roughly 62 grams of carbs per 200 grams, but this is because I can't find any sugar free chocolate whcih would be better. But the ones I make work out to be about  150 calories per slice and 4.5 grams of carbs each if you make 32 slices.

1366606761.0	1cuhi6	Roast: It has saved my life to always have some in the fridge! Here's a simple, never fail way to cook it :)	thriftygal	49	5	14	"Ok, so most of you probably already know how to cook a roast...but I was blissfully unaware until I ate some at my friends house and demanded her recipe. She looked at me like I was nuts, but I insisted. 

It's sooo unbelievably simple that I'm smacking myself for not doing this before. 

Here are the steps...

**ONE** 
Get your roast: This is really ANY big chunk of meat. I don't normally look at the name of the cut, I just grab something big with lots of fat in it (the fat makes it juicy and delicious, but it's not a must if you prefer leaner meat). If it hasn't been frozen then skip to step **TWO**. 

If it's frozen (I like to buy a few at a time and freeze them), then stick it in the fridge several hours before you want to cook it. If it's still kinda frozen when you want to start cooking, THAT'S OK :D It will just have to cook a bit longer.

**TWO**
Put your chunk of meat in a dutch oven. If you don't have a dutch oven that's ok, grab a skillet or pan. I just like a dutch oven cause it's easier and produces perfect roast every time. 

Pour some olive oil or another kind of oil (doesn't matter really) all over it. I don't ever measure, I just drizzle some oil on there till I think it will be enough to coat the whole chunk of meat. 

**THREE**
Take out your spices. You can use whatever you like, but I find these to be the best for me:

Chili powder
Cumin
Paprika
Salt
Pepper
Garlic powder
Onion powder

Now shake your spices over the meat, trying to get most of it actually on the meat and not all over the floor and the counter (harder than it sounds). I add quite a bit...if I had to guess probably 1-2 teaspoons of each spice. But I really discourage measuring at this point. Trust your eye, and just go with what looks right. You can always add more or less next time (that's the fun of cooking!). 

**FOUR**
Here's the fun part (and it's kinda gross). Take your hands and just rub that meat down. Rub it *real* good. Make sure to get everything coated with the oily, spicy goodness. 

**FIVE**
Put your dutch oven (or skillet) on the stove, turn it to high, and sear **all** the sides of the meat. This will take about 5-7 minutes, just make sure that most of the meat you can see is now kinda dark brown and possibly a little crispy. This is gonna seal in all the flavor and juiciness. MMMMMM. 

**SIX** 
If you were using a skillet before, now it's time to put that chunk of meat in a roasting pan, baking dish, or something that is deep enough to add a bunch of liquid to and cover. If you're using a dutch oven, no transportation of meat is needed.

Pour some water or beef or chicken or vegetable stock/broth or whatever liquid you want to fill the pan about halfway up the sides of the meat, maybe a little more. You probably will want to scrape the bottom and sides of the dutch oven with a wooden or plastic spoon now to get some of the crispy bits off once you've added the liquid (MORE FLAVOR). 

*note:* I didn't have any broth or stock last time I made roast, so I just used water and then added some spicy mustard and medium wing sauce to flavor the liquid. UMMM HELLO-- it was amazing. So just be creative :)

**SEVEN**
Now it's time to put that bad boy in the oven. Set the oven at about 250-300 depending on how long you want to cook it. I usually do 250 and cook the meat for 4-6 hours. 

Place the lid on the dutch oven and put it in the oven. Wait at LEAST 3 hours (longer if the temp is lower). Trust me, you will know when it's done. It will fill your house with a glorious smell and when you open the lid to check on it, you will see the most tender, succulent, falling apart chunk of goodness you have ever laid eyes on. Take your fork (no knife should be needed), and gently lift some of the meat (that is by now falling apart). Let it cool (key step here if you want to keep your taste buds). Taste. MOUTHGASM.

**Some tips**

Try not to check the meat really (once is probably ok)...it's best if you leave it in there a while. 

Also, more liquid is better than less liquid. You need to have enough for the meat to stay moist. That's also why it's important to cook it with a lid or something else pretty tightly sealing the top of the pan. 

A dutch oven is SO worth the investment--just get one!

**Serving time**

OMG so there are sooo many ways to eat roast, which is why I love having it all the time. It's tasty just cold as a snack by itself, with vegetables or cauliflower mash for a more traditional dinner, in a low carb pita with mayo and cheese, or however else you like roast.

I have been pretty obsessed with eating it in a particular way for the past couple of weeks. It may sound weird, but it's delicious. 

I take the roast and shred it in a bowl 

Sprinkle cheese (sharp cheddar usually)

Heat until a little warm

Stir

Add some mayo and chipotle mustard (0 carbs!)

Stir

Heat a little more

Stir

I was just doing some voodoo with leftovers. Started out making Daikon hashbrowns... 1 cup riced Diakon radish, 1tblsp butter. Had it cooking in a frying pan and it was starting to get brown on the edges but not in the middle. I didn't want them to scorch but I just used the last of my butter so I just grabbed my olive oil container , not realizing I had grabbed my *herb filled* bottle (Vinegar/oil/herbs/etc.. basically sub dressing) As soon as I saw all the green bits of oregano and pepper it was too late, so I kept cooking. As it stated browning up in the middle I took a sample and it tasted just like the artichokes that I use on pizza, so I browned them out a little more. 

When they were getting golden I put them on a plate, put a thin layer of ranch on, topped with Provolone/Mozerella and some pepperoni mini's and OMFG! It was DELICIOUS!!!, next time I'll add onion and bacon but this is a new staple of mine for sure! 

Playing around with this would yield even better results, maybe 1/2 cup of Daikon instead of the full cup as it was THICK. And saute the onions and bacon in with them as they cook.

1/3c grated Parmesan [3Carbs](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/32)

Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Chilli Powder, Seasoned salt, Cayenne Pepper.

1 egg (0 Carb)

1/4c shredded Parmesan [2Carbs](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/32)

Drain the crab, mix the crab with the grated Parmesan (fingers work the best). Crack the egg into it (don't scramble first), mix this with your fingers as well. The goal is to make the mixture sticky, but not wet.dig a small hole into the mix and sprinkle the spice mix on top of the entire crab-goodness. Into the whole goes the shredded Parmesan. Mix with your hands one more time. Take your skillet (electric one will do great) and start melting 1.5-2 TBLS of butter, and roll the hot and sexy lipid all around that pan. Roll the crab into golfball sized to baseball sized balls and smush them old school, think play-doh. Place these Karbby Patties into the grease and leave them be for at least 4 min on medium-high heat. This will make a nice golden brown crust. After the 4 min you can check on the pattie side and flip it like 4 bed room 3 bath on gulf front property. Do this once more and you are a boss.

All I did was boil some chicken broth (my broth was 1 container of chicken stock with 3 1/2 cups of water). While waiting for that to boil, I grilled some chicken and cut it up into small cubes. Then, I whipped together 2 egg whites and 1 egg (you can use more yolks, of course) and drizzled that into the broth when it was done boiling (it'll cook instantly- you can whip it up in the soup with a fork so it doesn't form into one big mass). 

Then threw in the chicken chunks along with some spices and ta-da! Super easy, low carb soup, perfect for when you're sick and missing that good 'ol chicken noodle. I thought it was even better. I also drizzled some sharp cheddar on top and let it melt in. Super yummy! 

I had a recipe for egg drop soup and just modified it with the chicken chunks, spices, and cheese. I think this is a good recipe to modify with whatever you want- feel free to add more veggies- I think celery and carrots would be really good in this!"	t5_2t46o	True

"	almsaysdreams	48	9	7	"Not quite sure of the exact carb amount, but I know it's not much! After looking over the ingredients it seems to me there aren't carbs in much of anything! 

Cauliflower (I don't go by exact amounts so however much you plan to eat)

Chicken or vegetable stock (I use either campbells premade or Knorr 'homemade' stock)


Cream Cheese (I have Philadelphia cooking cream cheese, savoury garlic flavour)

Parmsean (I prefer Saputo Parmesean petals. But you can use whatever you'd like.

Small Onion.

1.) Chop onion into small pieces and cook in a frying pan until translucent.

2.) Grate cauliflower using both small and large grater holes, as this will
give you a really nice rice consistancy. 

3.) Remove onions from pan, set aside in bowl.

4.) Add your cauliflower to the pan, with enough stock to cover the bottom of the pan. 

5.) turn heat to about 4-6 and cover pan with a top or a plate to allow the cauliflower to steam. 

6.) Check back frequently to add more stock when the first stuff is soaked up. Do this for 5 minutes or until the cauliflower is rice soft. (You can find this out by tasting it as you go along)

7.) Once all liquid is gone, add in onions, cream cheese and parmesean. 

8.) Turn to low heat 2-4 and stir until you reach the risotto consistancy. 

Since I didn't add any amounts, here is my thinking with this recipe...
For an indivdual sized portion (a fist sized amount) I used aprox 1/4 of a cauliflower, 2 tblsp of cream cheese, about 1/3c of stock, a palm full of parmsean petals (well, okay a palm and a half full) and that's it. No need for salt, unless you really want. I found with salt was too much. I hope someone else can enjoy this recipe as much as I have! I miss rice, especially risotto. This gives me the closest thing i've had to risotto consistency and taste."	t5_2t46o	True
1374766352.0	1j169d	Easy Enchilada Chicken	septicidal	46	8	5	"This is a super-easy dish to satisfy those Mexican-food cravings... Serve with cheese, cauliflower ""rice"", sour cream, and homemade guacamole for ultimate enjoyment.

 * 1 lb package of chicken breasts or tenders (white meat is best)
 * 3 TB butter
 * 1 10-ounce can of enchilada sauce

Dump the above ingredients into a slow-cooker, cook for 10 hours on low.  (Alternatively, you can cook it for fewer hours on high - you want the chicken to be fall-apart tender and the flavor from the sauce to permeate the meat.)  Shred chicken, mix well with sauce.  Makes 4 servings - the carb/calorie count will vary depending on what brand of enchilada sauce you use, mine comes out to around 5 carbs per serving.

For Cauliflower ""Rice"":

 * 1 head fresh cauliflower
 * Seasonings (I use salt, pepper, a little cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder)
 * 1-2 TB olive oil

Shred or finely mince the cauliflower (I often remove the core and run the cauliflower through my food processor).  Heat the oil in a saute pan on medium-high until hot, add the cauliflower.  Add seasonings to taste.  Stir/flip the cauliflower so that it cooks evenly and the seasonings are evenly disbursed.

1363673702.0	1akv81	[recipe] simple keto chocolate ice cream	alysonfun	41	3	3	"I used a Magic Bullet blender for this recipe.

Put 1 can of coconut milk (I used Aroy-D) in your Magic Bullet cup in the freezer for 1.5 hours (until it's almost solid). Remove from freezer.

If it gets too solid, nuke for 30 seconds at a time to get the sides melty, or add some heavy cream (yum).

If you have no room in your blender cup, set some of the coconut milk frozen goodness aside in a bowl and just mix it in later.

Put in 2 scoops of Vega chocolate protein powder and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

Blend that shit up. MMM. If it's a little runny, add a 1/4 tsp of xantham gum. It'll thicken up like a charm. That stuff is a lifesaver!

I'll get shit for this but I crumbled up a couple Atkins peanut butter cups and mixed those in too, tasted fabulous. Enjoy!

Carb Count:
* 4 for the Vega powder
* 2 for the coconut milk
* 3 for the Atkins PB cups

Net carbs was about 3 per serving, as I got 3 reasonable servings from this recipe. I froze some after making it. I tried adding a splash of vodka to prevent total freezing but it didn't work, so had to nuke it and re-blend it to get it the proper consistency again.

I used this as a recovery treat after Bikram yoga and it was sublime.

Hint:
The trick to this recipe is to stop your Magic Bullet every couple blends and really shake and tap that bad boy on your counter, as it gets really thick and doesn't want to blend."	t5_2t46o	True

3 eggs, separated
3 tablespoons whole milk cottage cheese or 3 tablespoons cream cheese
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar (I didn't use this, but they did go a bit flat, it's used to stabilise the egg whites so if you've got it use it!)
1 (1 g) packet artificial sweetener

1. Preheat oven to 150 degrees C. (300 F)

2. Separate the eggs very carefully, there must be no yolk in the white.

3. In one bowl, mix together the egg yolks, the 3 T. of Cottage Cheese OR Cream Cheese and the one packet of Sweetener until smooth.

4. In the other bowl add 1/4 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar to the whites and beat the whites on high speed until they are fluffy and form nice peaks.

5. Very carefully fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites until mixed, but try and not break down the fluffiness of the egg whites too much.

6. Spray two cookie sheets with Pam or other fat-free cooking spray.

7. With a large spoon, ""scoop"" the mixture into 10 even rounds on the sheets (about the size of the top-half of the McDonalds hamburger bun; roughly 3/4 inch thick and 4 to 5 inches across).

8. Bake on the middle rack. Here is when you have to watch them, because the cooking time the same on any two batches. It is somewhere around 1/2 hour, but it could be less or more. You just need to watch them until them become nice and golden brown (again, the color of a McDonalds bun).

9. Remove from the pans and cool on a rack or cutting board.

10. While warm they are crumbly and similar to cooked meringue - but don't let this fool you! Once completely cool, seal them in a ziplock storage baggie or a tupperware over night. They will totally change their consistency, to something much more like bread - a softer texture that is nice and chewy. If you do not like softer chewy bread, then eat them as they are, nice and crisp.

11. Since the sides that were facing the pan are perfectly flat, you use these to spread things on, or make sandwiches, or even as a burger bun! The choice is up to you, and you will be quite amazed at how much like a bun these really are!

Here's my first sandwich for three months. http://imgur.com/7thkwUj

I decided to I had to concoct my own keto version to put on my flackers! (flax crackers, [recipe in another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1eqraf/flackers_essentially_carb_free_whole_seed_flax/)).

1 tbsp (rounded) salted butter, soft

2 tbsp (rounded) virgin coconut oil

a squirt of honey or agave nectar or some splenda or stevia to taste

2 tsp of cinnamon or 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice :)

Mix all ingredients well


I keep it in a little sealed container at room temp. This batch lasts a pretty long time, a couple of weeks if you have it on few flackers, celery sticks, or whatever every other day as a treat.

Apply liberally to flax crackers, or just eat lick it off your finger!
 
Because I use such a small amount of the spread, I just use honey, it's a negligible amount of sugars/carbs, but if you are very strict, or want to eat a lot of it, or want it SUPER sweet, use a lower carb sweetener. Since quitting sugar I've found I'm a lot more sensitive now to the taste of sweet after being keto for months and months, and the coconut oil is already a bit sweet, and cinnamon is quite sweet too, so only a teaspoon of honey is needed for me. Enjoy it!

This recipe yields (according to myfitnesspal.com)

2600 calories, 192g of fat, ~208g of protein, 20g carb (13 net carb)

Serves 4-6 sane people or 2 insane people


It was my second and final meal of the day because I ate half of it and that about maxed me out. It's a high protein dish so be careful if you already have eaten enough protein for the day unless you're bulkin'.

**Ingredients:**

2 7-8 Oz Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts

2 Celery Stalks

3 cups chopped romaine lettuce 

3 cups chopped kale

2 Oz Smoked Gouda

2 Oz Pepperjack

6 Slices of Bacon

3/4 cup of mayo

2 tbsp olive oil

2 tbsp red wine vinegar

Salt to taste

Pepper to taste


**Preparation:**

Season two (2) 7-8oz chicken breasts with salt, pepper &amp; cajun seasoning, bake for 25-30 mins @ 350 Degrees

slice the celery thin

dice chicken into 1/2-1/4 inch cubes

in a large bowl, add chicken and celery and toss with mayo to coat, add salt &amp; pepper to taste

once done, throw it in the fridge while preparing the next couple things

In a skillet or frying pan, get that bacon going, make sure you get it cooked nice and crispy, because this adds the ever underrated salty crunch element.

while the bacon is frying up dice up the cheese into 1/2-1/4 inch cubes

Once bacon is done, let it sit on a paper towel or two and then crumble it.

The chicken should be nice and cold now so pull that outta the fridge

In a large bowl, toss the lettuce and kale in the olive oil and vinegar, then add the cheese and the bacon.
Scoop the chicken onto individual servings or just toss it in like I did.

In the end you will have an extremely delicious, high fat/high protein chicken salad to end all chicken salads.

Should look something like this when its all said and done: http://i.imgur.com/iHoVT.jpg

****I like my curry verrrrrry spicy so you may want to use less spice than I recommend here. Remember, you can always add more spice, but you can't take it out!****

____________________________

So without further ado, here is my recipe for **Thai Chicken Curry**.

* 2-3 Tbsp olive or coconut oil (more as needed)
* 1 medium onion, quartered, then quarter the quarters

* 1 stalk of lemongrass, [sliced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exe3Aa1d7Ro)

* 3 cloves garlic, minced

* thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated

* ~1 pound chicken breast, sliced in strips (you can use thighs if you prefer. I used a little more than 1 pound for extra meatiness)

* 2-4 Tbsp curry powder ([this](http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/product/oriental-curry-powder-3-oz?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=base&amp;gclid=CJD-hNeWiLICFSdjTAod1AMA7A) is what I use.)

* ~1 Tbsp red cayenne pepper
* ~1 Tbsp paprika
* 1 zucchini, halved, then sliced in ~1"" slices
* 1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
* 1 Tbsp fish sauce
* 1 Tbsp lime juice
* 1 can light coconut milk
* 1 tsp cornstarch (optional)
* 1 Tbsp brown sugar (optional)

1. Toss chicken in olive oil and a bit of curry powder, cayenne, and paprika. Set aside. 

2. Heat oil in large pan or wok over medium-high heat.

3. Saute onions until translucent (4-5 minutes). Add lemongrass, garlic, and ginger. Saute 1 minute longer.


4. Add chicken to pan. Stir fry 3-4 minutes or until cooked through. Add desired amount of spices.

5. Add zucchini and red bell pepper. Cook 4-5 minutes, until tender. Add fish sauce and lime juice.

6. Meanwhile, whisk cornstarch into coconut milk.

7. Add coconut milk to pan. Stir well, bring to boil, then let simmer at med-low.

8. At this point, taste and add additional spices or sugar if needed.

9. Let simmer for 10-20 minutes (the longer the better in my opinion)
_____________________________

**Cauliflower Rice**

* 1 small head of cauliflower, grated
* 1 Tbsp butter
* 1 package chicken bullion powder (or cube)

1. Use a cheese grater to grate cauliflower, or the appropriate food processor attachment.
2. Melt butter in pan over med-high. Add bullion.
3. Saute cauliflower for ten minutes or so, do not let it get brown.

_____________________________

My Fitness Pal is only giving me limited nutritional information, which is irritating, because I know there is some offsetting fiber in this recipe. But anyhow:

**Per serving: 365 calories, 14 carbs, 23 fat, 26 protein**

There are ways to reduce the carbs (leave out fish sauce and sugar, skin the zucchini, use green bell pepper instead of red, use only 1/2 an onion, possibly a lower carb curry powder or just less spice overall) but I presented the recipe the way I made it.

It was delicious and I have leftovers for days!

(I got the Cauliflower ""Rice"" recipe from a blog, but I cannot find it again! If anyone can give credit to the original, please do so!)

Maybe the flavors remind me of being a kid, maybe I like the portability, I don't know. But I do know that I used to pound these back when I was a vegan (for shame!) and the real thing made me super sick (not surprising looking back!) 

I have finally cracked the case an solved my PB&amp;J craving with my keto kitchen magic. Here you go!

Coconut flour muffin tops

1 cup coconut flour
1/2 cup softened butter
6 eggs
1/2 tsp baking powder
6 - 8 drops vanilla stevia (if desired)
1 tsp cinnamon (if desired)

Mix all ingredients until the mixture is halfway between doughy and a thick pancake batter. Scoop into a greased large muffin top pan and bake on 350 degrees for 15 min of until finished. Makes 6

Raw Chia Strawberry Jam

1 large package strawberries
5 tablespoons chia seeds
1/4 cup water

Blend diced strawberries with water. Stir chia into strawberry mixture, and chill overnight. If you want it thicker, stir in more chia and wait a few hours to thicken. Makes 12 servings

I chill the muffin tops and jam overnight, and in the morning I spread cashew butter and the raw jam on top. 

Holy hell. :) 

Watch out for folks with sensitive stomachs - each serving has LOTS of fiber.

I have one of these for breakfast *and* dinner every day in order to meet my required macros. This milkshake contains 585 calories, so it is a meal replacement.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/LP4qREhh.jpg) is what the final product will look like.

##Ingredients:

^An ^asterisk ^means ^that ^an ^ingredient ^is ^optional.

**Heavy Whipping Cream** (*4 oz*) - [I'm using Meadow Gold Old Style Heavy Whipping Cream.](http://www.fatsecret.com/Diary.aspx?pa=fjrd&amp;rid=506745) This is where all of the calories are coming from, but also all of the fat. I adjust the amount I use based on how much fat I need. Four ounces usually does the trick, but don't be afraid to bump that up if necessary. Just be aware of your calories if you are on a caloric deficit.

**Unsweetened Almond Milk** (*8 oz*) - [I'm using Silk Unsweetened PureAlmond Original.](http://silk.com/products/unsweetened-original-almondmilk) This adds some substance to the milkshake. I like almond milk, but you can use whatever you like. Just be sure that it is unsweetened, or else there will be added carbs!

**Unflavored Protein Powder** (*2 tbsp*) - [I'm using MLO Super High Protein Powder.](http://www.vitacost.com/mlo-super-high-protein-powder) Protein powder is optional, but since I use this as a meal replacement, I always add it. MLO Super High is my favorite because it is carb free, but it is somewhat hard to find ([unless you look here](http://www.vitacost.com/mlo-super-high-protein-powder)), so you can use whatever you like, just be aware of added carbs!

**Orange Flavoring** (*1 tbsp*) - [I'm using Sodastream Diet Orange Soda Mix.](http://www.amazon.com/Sodastream-Diet-Orange-Sodamix-Syrup/dp/B003ZFOEEK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367798962&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sodastream+diet+orange) I use this because it is Aspartame-free, but it does contain Sucralose. If you're looking for an artificial-sweetener free alternative, you may look into [Orange Extract.](http://www.mccormick.com/Spices-and-Flavors/Extracts-and-Food-Colors/Extracts/Pure-Orange-Extract) You can also use [Sugar-free Orange Jello](http://www.amazon.com/Jell-O-Sugar-Free-Gelatin-Dessert-0-3-Ounce/dp/B000E1FYF6) as an alternative to Sodastream, but Jello does contain Aspartame.

**Stevia*** (*1 packet*) - [I'm using Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia.](http://www.wholesomesweeteners.com/organicstevia.html) Stevia is completely optional; it just adds extra sweetness.

**Vanilla Extract*** (*1 tbsp*) - I do not use Vanilla Extract, but it can be added for extra flavoring. Just be aware of carbs.

To make things simpler for you, [this is everything that you need.](http://i.imgur.com/V5RTeq6h.jpg)

##Instructions:

* Place your Heavy Whipping Cream, Unsweetened Almond Milk, Protein Powder, and Orange Flavoring into the blender, and blend for 15 seconds, or until satisfied.

* Add ice for cold-ness and to achieve a substance similar to that of a milkshake.

* [Take a picture for Reddit.](http://i.imgur.com/ITOt85Xh.jpg)

* Enjoy.

Are you ready to have the most AMAZING and filling winter dish? So amazing that you end up eating this perfect winter dish in the spring, summer and fall? Get your butts ready for some mouth amazeingness!

Okay! Get started by prepping your food.

* Mince the onion
* Slice the chorizo into coins (really as thinly sliced as you can manage. i suggest removing the skin from the chorizo then chill the meat in the freezer for 40-50 minutes to get the thinest slices.)
* Cut the chicken into about 1""x1""x1"" cubes 
* Cut the broccoli into small pieces. not shredded. 
* Dice the tomato into small pieces

Alright, is your food all ready to go? Put your broccoli into a medium sized pan/pot and start boiling it. At the same time, have a large skillet (2-3 inches deep with a lid to use for simmering at the end) set up, add a little bit of cooking oil (I use sesame oil, it has a high cooking temp before burning). Once the oil is warmed up, add the minced garlic and onion. cook them in the hot pan until they start to turn a little golden and the onions have become a little transparent. It should take about 2-4 minutes if your heat is set to around a medium low.

Now your skillet is warmed up and ready to receive some glorious diced chicken. Increase the cooking heat to around medium add the chicken and let it cook, stirring it and making sure it doesn't burn. Once the chicken is white (surface cooked), add the spices over the chicken. Paprika, red pepper, ground pepper (Onion powder optional if you aren't using a minced onion.) Be careful about over seasoning. the chorizo can get spicy. so just add a little bit right now. Once the spices have cooked onto the chicken, add the Alfredo sauce. stir the chicken and sauce around until it turns a slightly red/orangish color. 

Now stir in the sausage and let the meats all cook in the sauce for a moment or two.

Your boiling broccoli should be all finished by now. typically it will cook between 6-9 minutes. Drain the water and add it to the cooking meats. so, at this point the meats have been coking in the sauce. I would suggest to taste test the Alfredo to check to see HOW spicy it is. This is where I would either add more spices, or leave it as it is. Its up to you how spicy you would like it to be. 

Once you have decided the fate the spiciness of the dish, cover it and let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes over a low-medium heat, until the sausage is throughly cooked, stirring occasionally. Once everything is all cooked, add in the parmesan cheese, stir and let the sauce thicken up a bit. The added parmesan cheese is just for thinking up the sauce, if you're feeling you don't need it, you can opt to not use it. The more Alfredo sauce you use, the more likely you'll want to use it. Also add in the diced tomato. It will shrink as the dish cooks, it should be added last and cooked for a few minutes. 

Serve in a dish and put it in your mouth. It goes great with a spring greens salad with caesar dressing.

* 2 cups of chopped Cabbage

* 1 cup of chopped Celery 

* 1 tablespoon of Olive oil and 1 tablespoon of Sesame Oil

* 1/2 cup of chicken stock

* .5 lb of any meat (I used turkey). Beef/Chicken/Pork/Fish/Shrimp... etc will work fine.

* Adobo for seasoning.

------------------
* 1 Tablespoon of Olive oil and 1 Tablespoon of Sesame Oil in a pan on med-high/ high heat. Heat till a drop of water in pan sizzles. 

* Add chopped celery and cabbage (I used Chinese Cabbage, but any is fine). 
Add protein (I used turkey, left overs from turkey day). 

* Stir fry for about 6-8 mins. You'll see some of the bottom of the pan is browning (if you are not using non-stick.)  

* Add half a cup of chicken stock to reduce this and infuse all that fat/flavor.  Cover after putting in stock to steam the veggies a bit, and evenly warm up your protein for about 2-3 mins. Longer if you want softer veggies, I prefer mine a bit crunchy. 

* Open cover away from face, let steam come out.  Add a dash of Adobo seasoning (1/4 tsp). 

* Fry for additional 30-45 seconds, just mixing, evenly distributing the flavors.  

Drop into a bowl and eat.  You will have 'liquid' on the bottom of the bowl, but this is to avoid the symptoms of the keto flu (for those just starting). It's a very small amount of calories for great flavor as well.

I apologize for the lack of a picture. I ate it before I even remembered to put up this recipe.

1366695699.0	1cx41h	Yet Another Keto Meatloaf - Our Kids New Favorite!	DiabolicallyRandom	41	9	3	"This is our families new favorite meatloaf recipe that I developed over a couple of tries. Everyone likes this better than our old school meatloaf with oatmeal / crackers / whatever.

**Ingredients:**

1. 170 Grams (6 oz) Raw Jimmy Dean All Natural Ground Sausage
&gt;Nutrition facts only list cooked weight, but we have calculated the average raw to cooked weight conversion to be 3:2, so it comes out to ""4 oz cooked"" if you are calculating nutrition. We buy this at Costco, but I am sure it can be found elsewhere - http://jimmydean.com/products/test-product-name-01.aspx

1. 500 Grams (17.64 oz) 88% Lean Ground Beef
&gt;We buy this at Costco as well, just from their meats cooler - however any ground beef of 88% will do. You can use other % as well, but need to adjust nutrition accordingly. This is listed as ""

1. 50 Grams (1.76 oz) Parmesan Romano Dry Grated Cheese
&gt;We buy this in the bulk foods section at Winco - however Kraft Parmesan Romano mixed cheese would be a close analog if you can't find anything close in your bulk food section.

1. 2 Large Grade AA Eggs
&gt;These are pretty normal things, no need to explain here

1. (Optional) 3 Packets of Truvia Sweetner (or other Calorie Free Alternative)
&gt;We add this to get a bit of sweetness in our meatloaf that we would normally get from Ketchup. I have also used liquid Stevia and Liquid Sucralose to achieve a similar taste. We use the packets for ease.


**How to Cook:**

1. Put everything into a bowl (except your egg shells ;] ) - If you would like to add extra spices of your own, now is the time. If I am in the mood, I sometimes throw some dill in, or paprika, or garlic - however the sausage does add a lot of flavor on its own.

1.  A) EASY MODE - - either with bare hands, or, as is my preference, with gloves on, dig in and mix that meat and cheese and egg up really good so everything is well mixed. 

 B) HARD MODE - Same as above, but instead of using your hands, use a spoon or something to mix it. This will take longer.


1. In a medium size baking dish (I usually use a 5x9 Pyrex glass dish) form your loaf - again, easiest with your hands, but its your loaf!

1. Add a small amount of water (2-4 tablespoons) into the bottom of the baking dish - this keeps your pan from scorching and helps keep it moist. Place in a preheated oven @ 325-350 (When I make a thin loaf, I use the higher temp for quicker cooking - however if I am not in a rush i use the lower temp - if you make a thick/tall loaf, you need to lower the temp a bit to prevent overcooking the outside).

 NOTE:If you desire, you can also cook this covered with foil, or, in a roasting pan with lid - this will keep more moisture in, and keep the outside from crusting.

1. Start checking your center mass temperature at about 30 minutes in, and every 5-10 minutes thereafter - center temp needs to reach 165 since there is pork in the loaf. Once you have reached temp, its done!


We love to serve this along side some mashed cauliflower to get the classic ""meat and potatoes"" meal feel. This recipe is also really adaptable - we also use the same exact methods to make meatballs - the only difference is we form the meat into balls before placing into the pan, rather than into a loaf.

Now for the important details:

1373697729.0	1i7gdq	Chocolate Muffins with a Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Drizzle	PathogenVirdae	37	7	4	"Ingredients for the Muffins
3 eggs (room temperature - important)
1/3 cup coconut flour
¼ cup melted butter
½ teaspoon vanilla
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ cup sugar substitute equivalent (I used 8 packets of Truvia)
½ teaspoon baking powder (I add just a touch more than this, no idea if it helps)
2-5 Tablespoons water (see below)
1 Tablespoon Hersey Cocoa Powder

Ingredients for the Drizzle (This is for a double batch of muffins, or extra topping for 6)

• 3 blocks Cadbury Special Dark Chocolate
• 2 Tablespoons Natural Peanut Butter (Mine was pretty runny at room temp.)

Preparation:

Heat oven to 375° F. Prepare pan with a generous amount of butter. This recipe makes six ""regular""-sized muffins.
1) Whisk or beat the eggs until whites and yolks are well-mixed. Stream in the butter while continuing to whisk. Add salt and vanilla and mix until combined. 

2) Mix the remaining dry ingredients -- coconut flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and sweetener.

3) Mix the dry and wet ingredients together. Now you will whisk in water, one tablespoon at a time. The coconut flour will absorb the liquid from the wet ingredients like crazy. I usually end up using about 4 Tablespoons of water.

4) Divide among 6 muffin cups. Bake for about 15 to 18 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Drizzle Preparation:

Place all ingredients in a microwavable bowl. Microwave for around 45 seconds. Stir to combine, find a way to drizzle. I used a makeshift piping bag, but I lost a lot of the mixture to the bag. Might drizzle with a spoon next time.

MyFitnessPal Calculations per serving (if only making 6 muffins and using the drizzle that should cover 12 muffins)

Cal 161	Total Carbs 8	Fat 13	Protein 5	

I'm not exactly sure what the net carbs are, but they should be lower than 8. The Truvia really spikes it up, but I think it's all sugar alcohols so substitute your sweetner if those don't agree with you!

Skinny Spinach Dip (3-4 servings)

6-7 oz frozen spinach (half a 12-oz bag)

1/3 c fat free Greek yogurt

2 green onions, finely sliced

1 clove garlic, minced

1/2 c shredded part skim mozzarella

1/4 c shredded Parmesan

pepper or red chili flakes (to taste)

Completely thaw your spinach either in the microwave or by letting sit for a day in the refrigerator.  Squeeze out as much liquid as you can by hand and then press between two paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible.  

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and spray a 4x4 dish or four 1-inch ramekins with non-stick.  In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.  Transfer to prepared baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, until dip is bubbling and the cheese is starting to brown around the edges.  Serve hot.  

This dip can be stored in the refrigerator for a day or so before it is baked.  Just cover a ramekin to store and pop it in the oven when you're ready to eat it...easy as spinach pie.

-as much cheddar cheese diced or shredded as you prefer (I usually use 4 oz or so)
-diced garlic (1/2 clove)
-salt and pepper

1: Heat the heavy whipping cream in a saucepan on the stovetop until it just starts to boil.
2: add butter and let melt (stirring constantly)
3: add rest of the ingredients
4: stir until all cheese is melted

Remove from heat and pour over steamed broccoli!

- 1 lb of fatty ground beef
- Some peanut oil or canola oil
- 1 T butter
- 6 strips of bacon
- 6 slices of american cheese
- 1 whole avocado
- Seasonings

Take the ground beef and roll it into several equally-sized meatballs. I usually can get 4-6 depending on how big I want to make them. I leave the meatballs on a plate and sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and a little cayenne.

Heat the oil until it's around 325-350 degrees and drop the tablespoon of butter in. Place the meatballs in the pan to fry and mash them down with your spatula to create a flat hamburger shape.

While the burgers cook on one side, dice up the avocado and toss it in a little bit of olive oil to keep it from browning.

Flip the burgers and let them brown for a minute or two before throwing a slice of american cheese and a strip of bacon over each patty. Let the cheese melt and the burger cook through.

Place the burgers on a serving dish and top with a generous scoop of avocado, divided equally amongst the patties.

We had one false start when we realized we needed to do more research about how to log our nutritional intake as well as preparing a weeks worth of keto friendly meals. 

We are doing pretty well after a few days. However, my husband is picky eater and the recipes he likes are few and far between. We are enjoying the bacon and egg breakfasts, but I'm nervous about the impending boredom for him and lack of sweets for me. 

The good news is that I really enjoy cooking. I was reading over a few recipes and realized that there seems to be a lot of kitchen ingredient staples for Keto cooking that I just don't know about. Like the powdered erythritol in the one cupcake recipe that was posted recently - I decided to look up the ingredient and will be buying some to use, but my lazy self has a tendency to just skip over the recipe of one of my favorite treats. 

So I'm coming to you all - what are your kitchen staples for keto cooking/baking? I'm thinking like spice alternatives or ways to add sweetness, or things along those lines.

Also, I need a quick on-the-go breakfast when I'm running out the door, late for work. Any ideas on that?"	t5_2t46o	True

-1/2 cup almond flour

-Pinch of baking soda

-1 1/2 tbsp olive oil

-1/4 cup mozzarella cheese

-1 tbsp (or more) of garlic powder

-1/4 cup shredded/cut spinach (I use baby spinach and just shred it with my fingers so it's in small pieces)

-1/4 cup chopped artichoke hearts, dried completely on a paper towel first

Directions:

-Mix completely egg, almond flour, baking soda and olive oil

-Add cheese and mix

-Add artichoke hearts and spinach. Stir / mix completely

-Microwave for 80 seconds or until thoroughly cooked


I actually took it to work today for lunch and it was delicious! Let me know if you try it and if you like it.

Edit: Updated to stress that the artichoke hearts need to be dried on a paper towel.

Edit 2: I made jalapeno almond bread last night to take to work today. It looks good - I'll add some pictures at lunch. Here is my recipe:

-1 egg

-1/3 cup almond flour

-Pinch of baking soda

-1 tbsp olive oil

-1/4 cup mexican style shredded cheese

-1 tbsp (or more) of garlic powder

-8-10 jalapeno slices dried on a paper towl (or more, if you're daring) from a canned jar - Old El Paso jalapeno slices work great

-Several good shakes from Frank's Red Hot

Directions:

-Mix completely egg, almond flour, baking soda and olive oil

-Add cheese and some Frank's and mix

-Add jalapeno's (and some more Frank's) and mix

-Microwave for 80 seconds. If the middle is still goopy, you have a couple of options. Microwave for another 60-80 seconds, or you can put it under the broiler for 1-4 minutes or until firm.

I originally posted this in /r/keto, but it seems like folks over there don't get that excited about recipes, and it's probably better served here, anyhow... Extremely happy with how these turned out. They taste just as good if not better than regular chicken strips. I've tried several recipes to make chicken strips, but to be quite honest, they all sucked. The texture just wasn't there, because their entire base was mostly just flax or almond meal. Well I figured something out today while having a snack. Pork rinds when ground up have the perfect texture. So you want to make these? Here's how...

What you need:

* 1 lb of chicken breast cut into strips
* 1 cup ground pork rinds crumbs. I used the Baken-et Hot n Spicy brand, but you can use whatever kind
* 1 cup flax seed meal (almond meal would probably work too)
* 2-3 eggs
* Whatever spices you like. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika
* Whatever kind of cooking oil you like

Making the breading...

I used an immersion blender with a chopping attachment. A food processor or blender would work too. Basically what you want to do is chop them up into a bread crumb consistency. You don't want it super fine like flour though, otherwise you won't have that course crunchy texture when fried. Once you get a cup of pork rind crumbs go ahead and throw that into a bowl. If you make extra, that's fine. My measurements are not 100% precise. Now mix in half a cup of flax seed meal and your spices. Mix that up thoroughly.

Take your three eggs and whip those up into an egg wash. and put that in a bowl.

You're going to use the rest of the flax seed meal as a dusting before you put the chicken into the egg wash. Make sure you pat dry your chicken with a paper towel before you begin the process. 

Now piece by piece... a nice dusting in the flax seed meal... then into the egg wash to coat the chicken with egg, hold above the bowl and let it drip the excess back into the bowl... then drop that coated chicken into the pork rind mixture, coat both sides... then directly into your oil. I honestly don't know how hot my oil was. However a good test is to just get your finger tips wet, and flick some water droplets into the oil. If the oil looks mad and starts bubbling fiercely, it's ready.

Fry for approx 3-4 min per side. Try not to disturb it too much except for flipping over. Take out and let it cool a couple min on a bed of paper towels (to soak up any excess oil).

That's it. Enjoy!"	t5_2t46o	True

*Greek Rhubarb Breakfast Yogurt*

First you will have to prepare some rhubarb mousse/marmelade. Its real easy and you can store it up to a week. 

U will need: 
*7-10 stems of rhubarb, cut into small pieces
*Sweetener of your choice (Liquid or Powder)
*Water

1. Put the cut rhubarb into a big pan and cover it with a cup of water. (Lesser water, thicker marmelade/mousse- don't take to much because the plants will shed some water too.) 
2. Add Sweetener of your choice. 
3. Heat up until the water boils. Then let simmer for at least 30min until everything gets real soft and kind of mushy. 
4. Now purée the mousse with a food processor and store it in marmelade jars. Finished! 

Now as soon as you have the marmelade, you can make all sorts of things. For example you can eat it with almond butter bread and butter or you can use it for ice creams, panna cotta or cheese cakes. Here now comes how I use it for my breakfast. 

You will need: 
*1 greek yogurt
*4-5 tbsp of rhubarb mousse
*Additions of your choice (like chocolate chips, nuts, berries ...) 

Mix the yogurt and the rhubarb mousse so it looks like marble. Add whatever you like, I usually take some walnuts or some berries to go with it. Enjoy! Real easy, super tasty and sweet breakfast!

edit: Just for inspiration, here is a picture of the dessert I did today for our family lunch.

CROCK POT CHICKEN PARMIGIANA

6 whole chicken breast (or 6 halves)

2 eggs

2 tsp salt

1 tsp ground black pepper

1 cup pork rind crumbs

1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese grated

1/2 cup butter or margarine

1 small eggplant, peeled, cut into 3/4-inch slices

1 can (10 1/2oz) low carb pizza sauce

12 slices Mozzarella cheese*

1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top


Cut whole chicken breasts into halves. In bowl, beat egg, salt, and pepper. Mix pork rind crumbs and Parmesan Cheese into separate bowl for dredging the meat in. Dip chicken into egg then coat with crumbs.*
In large skillet, sauté chicken in butter or margarine. Arrange chicken and eggplant in crock pot with eggplant on bottom. Pour pizza sauce over chicken. Cover and cook on low 6 to 8 hours. Add Mozzarella cheese 15 minutes before serving. Top with Parmesan cheese.

This dish was delicious. I will most certainly be using the dredge next week to make some tasty fried chicken.
