1297107337.0	fh174	Dear CheatAtMathHomework...	SenseiCAY	26	4	16	"I have a request for frequent submitters on this board. I hate to get on a soapbox/high horse/what-have-you and lecture, but I feel the need to do so. Also, I'm bored at work. This is mostly for those of you who are either in high school math, or perhaps taking a math class in college as a requirement.

From high school onwards (it's been 10 and a half years since I started high school), I have been a participant in math competitions (a ""mathlete,"" as some would call it), a private math tutor, a swim coach, and an instructor for a college programming class. I majored in computer science with a minor in math in college. Suffice to say, I love math, and I love to teach others about various things, including math. I don't claim to be great at math, or better at it than you are, by any stretch of the imagination, but I feel like this needs to be said.

I love to see a concept just ""click"" for students, but when that doesn't happen (and I don't always expect it to happen), my second choice is always to see them ask for help after having tried several approaches. At times, I've forgotten how to do certain problems on exams or contests, but I managed to find a solution through a little bit of lateral thinking. As an instructor, I absolutely hated seeing an e-mail with the subject line ""Help"" and the body saying something like, ""Where do I start on this problem/program,"" especially if that person had been skipping class or had a habit of asking that question.

I think Reddit (and the internet in general) is a great tool for asking for help, since you will, without a doubt, find someone who is knowledgeable about your topic. If you want to ask for help, though, don't be like this guy:

http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fgloj/help_hw_due_in_2_hours/

...or this guy...

http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fgu3e/find_the_area_of_these_figures_for_me/

Rather, give some indication that you've at least tried to do your own homework, and where you got stuck, like this guy (yes, I up-voted this one for effort):

http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fghcs/need_help_with_a_precalculus_problem/

In conclusion, I sincerely believe that the U.S. lags behind so many other nations in education, especially in math and science, not only because teaching towards standardized tests can discourage students from exploring the beauty that is inherent in mathematics and science, but because many students are afraid to try different approaches to solving problems. I'll leave you with the following thought. Most of my students in my programming class were majoring in mechanical, aerospace, or nuclear engineering. In the real world, a failure on the job could result in catastrophe. On an in-class program, if they didn't know where to start, or what to do next, they could save their work, take a stab at a solution, and the worst that would happen is that their code compiler would complain about their syntax. I even had a few students discover a few cool techniques by playing around with the code until something worked.

Good luck to you all, and enjoy your math.

Sincerely,

SenseiCAY

things can get confusing. If you don't put a space after the exponent, the rest of the equation gets lumped in with that exponent.

e^(ipi) = -1

We have been able to understand it enough to figure out that:

e^(i2pi) = 1

Because of polar coordinates of vectors and stuff.

However, we also know that if a^b = c, then log base a of c = b.

Rearranging the first equation (the one from the video) gives

 ln(-1) = i pi

And when I type ln(-1) into my calculator it tells me that it equals i pi. This agrees with the formula. However, rearranging the other one gives

ln(1) = i 2 pi

And this makes sense, except for the fact that I know ln(1) = 0.

Does this mean that:

i 2 pi = 0?

I work for a mining company and I am in charge of calculating our reserves. I have recently moved from using Access to using ESRI's ArcGIS.

Each mining area represented as a 10'x10' point of data. Each point of data is given a cost specific to that point. The points are congruent, in such a way (in this case) that 700 points make an entire ore body.
The given points show a mean cost of $27.42. Is there anyway, given the numbers in the image, to quickly determine what number would be the cutoff to give a mean of $25? As it stands now, I just guess and check...there's got to be a way!

9 are arranged in a 3 x 3 grid as in a standard calculator. Prove that if you start at
any number, and go around to form a 2 x 3 rectangle, then the 6 digit number that
results is divisible by 37. Examples: 214785, 478965, 541236 are all divisible by 37.

I think I've made some progress on this problem, but I'm curious if anyone else has any ideas.

What I have so far is let's call the 6 digits that form a 2x3 rectangle a,b,c,d,e,f. Then the number abcdef can be expressed as 100000a+10000b+1000c+100d+10e+f. If we do this with all possible permutations (eg fabcde=100000f+10000a+1000b+100c+10d+e) and sum up all of those integers, we obtain (111,111)(a+b+c+d+e+f). And 37 divides 111,111.

This shows that this sum is divisible by 37, but how can I prove that any permutation of abcdef is itself divisible by 37?

A. 10 hours

B. 20 hours

C. 30 hours

D. 40 hours

E. 60 hours

Explanation in the back states: If Raymond takes x hours, then Peter will take 2x hours. Therefore, the rate of work is equal.

1/x + 1/2x = 1/20 -&gt; x=30. 2x=60 hours.

(By the way, this is my first post here, so I'm not sure whether I've done everything completely right with the LaTeX plugin.

There should be a plus sign between the f(x) on the right side, I don't know why it is being omitted)

We are given a function from some interval D to R with the following property:

`[; f(tx_{1} + (1 - t)x_{2}) \geq t f(x_{1}) + (1 - t)f(x_{2}) ;]`

Let `[; f \in C^{2}(D, R) ;]` and `[; f''(x) \leq 0 ;]`, prove that f is concave for all `[; x \in D ;]`

1302983287.0	grmih	One more related rate question, this is really confusing.	iamthatis	9	1	6	"I've asked a few here, and you all have been a massive help, this is the last, though. I tried and tried, and sort of finished a, but (b) is just incomprehensible to me.

The volume V cm^3 of water in a container at time t seconds, when the depth of water in the container is x cm is given by the relationship

V = (1/3)(x+3)^3 - 9, 0 ≤ x ≤ 5

(a) Find the rate at which the water level is increasing after 5 seconds if water flows into the container at 1.2cm^3 /s

(b) Find the rate of change of the area of the surface of the water after 5 seconds if water is still flowing into the container at 1.2cm^3 /s.

For a, the answer is 0.095, which I can get, sort of. I have V = 1.2(t), which at 5 seconds would be 6cm^3 /s, so I set that equal to V in the original equation and get 0 = (x+3)^3 - 45. Looking it up on Wolfram|Alpha, the only real root there is 0.56, which when plugged into the derivative formula, I get 0.095, the answer. But that can't be the correct method, as how on earth would I get 0.56 as a root non-algebraically.

(b), I have no idea. I've mulled over it and came up with the equation dA/dt = dA/dx * dx/dt. The latter derivative is the answer to the previous question, 0.095, but the former, dA/dx, I can't get. I need to take the derivative of the surface area with respect to x, but I have no formula! I don't even know the shape. (The answer is 0.6747cm^2 /s)

1264090700.0	asfuw	Not a homework problem, but one I'm struggling with nonetheless.. averaging state based probabilities	seidaku	8	0	1	"I originally posted this on /r/math, where they indicated that markov chain calculations are the way to solve it. However, having no experience working with markov chains, I'm hoping that some kind redditors will take pity on me and help me figure this out.   

The problem:

An event has a base probability (p) of happening on any given time step (t). This base probability is increased by a constant value equal to x times the number of time steps since the last time the event happened.  Assuming an infinite number of time steps, what's the average chance the event happens?

For example, if p = 0.75 and x = 0.05, the event has a 75% chance of happening when t = 0. At t = 1, if the event happened during the first time step, there's still a 75% chance of it happening. If it *didn't* happen, there's an 80% chance of it happening. At t=2, there's the following probability map:

    0  1 
    y  y  = 75% 
    y  n  = 80%
    n  n  = 85%

Then, at t = 3:

    0  1  2 
    y  y  y = 75% 
    y  y  n = 80%
    y  n  n = 85%
    n  n  n = 90%
    y  n  y = 75%
    n  y  y = 75%
    n  n  y = 75%
    
At t=4 and beyond, the possibilities become unmanageable in a grid format. 

Brute forcing the problem programmatically (averaging number of times the event happens per time step over a large number of time steps), I find that average is about: 0.76461 

If p is lower, the difference is greater:

    base         actual
    p = 0.00     0.15958
    p = 0.05     0.19021
    p = 0.25     0.33055
    p = 0.50     0.53631

So, does anyone know how you would calculate this without the brute forcing? Is it going to be ugly, or does an elegant solution exist?

Laura measures the length and width of a rectangle, which is longer than it is wide. From these she calculates the rectangle's area as 68.25 square centimeters. However, the rectangle's actual area is 60 square centimeters.

Part A

The absolute errors of Laura's measurements of length and width are the same. It's actual length is 10 centimeters. What does Laura measure as the length and width of the rectangle?

This is how I would solve it:

A = l * w

60 = 10 * w

w = 6

A' = l' * w'

68.25 = (10 + e) * (6 + e)

68.25 = 60 + 16e + e^2

e^2 +16e - 8.25 = 0

(e + 16.5) * (e - 0.5) = 0

e = -16.5, 0.5

e = 0.5 (lengths cannot be negative)

l' = 10 + 0.5

l' = 10.5

w' = 6 + 0.5

w' = 6.5

Laura measures the length as 10.5 centimeters and the width as 6.5 centimeters

It is filled with 36 kg of water, but has a leak and all the water runs out by the time it is pulled to the top of the 12-m well. Calculate the work done on the bucket.


It seems pretty straight forward. I draw a bucket and rope, my y-axis has 12 on top and 0 on the bottom. I cut the rope into an interval, delta y, within which there is a point, yi which is at height yi. The mass of the rope is then 0.8 kg/m * yi m. The mass of the bucket is 10 kg. The mass of the water is (36-3yi)kg. The distance moved is the distance from yi to the top of the y-axis, (12 m-yi m). So I should just add up the masses, multiply by 9.81, and integrate from 0 to 12.


I must be missing something since I cannot get the right answer. I understand that I need to cut out an interval, which has some point yi on it.

El_SeaStriker	7	1	1	"A calculator is broken so that the only keys that still work are the sin, cos, tan, cot, sin^-1, cos^-1, and tan^-1  buttons. The display initially shows 0. In this problem, we will prove that given any positive rational number , show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will yield . (Assume that the calculator does real number calculations with infinite precision. All functions are in terms of radians.) 

(a) Find a sequence of buttons that will transform x into 1/x . 

(b) Find a sequence of buttons that will transform sqrt(x) into sqrt(x+1). 

(c) Now show that you can get any positive rational number.



This is what we have so far:

(a). First, taking the cot(x) will give the reciprocal of tan(x). Then it seems like taking the arctan of the result would return 1/x.

(b). I'm not sure how to approach the rest of this problem, although it seems like we could use the fact that sin^2 (x) + cos^2 (x) = 1 here.

Formalism:

3 is a consequence of the specific intepretation of to the rule of addition, applied to 1 and 2.

The succesor of 1 is 2, so the successor 2 must be 3, and so 1+2=3.

My wife needs help formulating an advanced Operations Research problem using linear programming for her ‘Deterministic Quantative Analysis’ class, tonight.

She has ‘Lingo’ and if someone could help her figure out what variables to use, how to write the objective function and how to write the constraints, she could put it in Lingo.

I’ve posted the two questions (A3-1 and A3-2) here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nngVsN_ITQsqkJM7sRCMwcZupeydVq-Yq-QC1NUPNxE/edit

If there’s ANYONE out there that can help my wife with this, please get in touch with me!

**Why:** name your charity, name your price (please be reasonable, I’m desperate, not rich)

**Long story long:**

My wife is trying to get her Masters in Management Science with a concentration in supply chain management.  She’s studied SCM in her honours undergrad and has post-grad certificates in the subject as well.  She got top of her program in all cases.  She is a smart cookie.

She is not good at math (and prior to this program, her courses have NEVER been math centric in the past) and it is proving to be her undoing.  She is not afraid of hard work, she’s done nothing be eat, sleep and school work for the past few weeks and it is REALLY burning her out.  The school has no support structure (TAs, teacher office hours, etc) so she is on her own.  There are only 2 other students in the program and they only want to work alone, so group-work isn’t even an option for her.

It’s been my wife’s dream to teach SCM, and she’s hitting a glass ceiling at work that she needs this degree to get past.

I'm trying to find the (3-dimensional) fourier transform of the function:

f(x,y,z) = z/(x^2 +y^2 +z^2 )^(3/2)

I tried using a method of residues, but it didn't work out because of the 3/2 power (which i wasn't sure how to get rid of). Also, i know that the 2- dimensional fourier transform of this (ie, $F(k_x,k_y,z) )$ is

exp(-\sqrt(k_x^2 + k_y^2 ) z)

Some context: I'm trying to find Aut(Zn) for any natural number n (Problem I.2.15c in Hungerford, if you're wondering), and I'm using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to deduce that if n=p1^(r1) *...* pk^(rk), then Zn iso to Zp1^(r1) x ... x Zpk^(rk), and since Aut(Zn) has the same order as U(Zn) (I'm thinking they're isomorphic, too, but I can't think of a way to prove it), I'd think U(Zn) is iso to U( Zp1^r1 ) x ... x U( Zpk^rk ). That's the source of my question. From there, I know U( Zpi^ri ) has order pi^ri - pi^((ri)-1) , but I'm hard pressed to determine general structure. I know U( Zpi^ri ) is a product of cyclic groups (since it's abelian) of orders of powers of p with the last cyclic group of the product having order p^j * (p-1) , but I have no idea what else I can say about them specifically.

1366298044.0	1clya1	Real Life Math Question Relating to Maximizing My Playing Time on My Indoor Soccer Team	UnderstandMeaning	8	2	2	"I play on a 6 v 6 (including goalie) co-ed indoor soccer team.  

Quick notes:

* We don't sub guys-for-girls, or sub the goalie during the game.  
* The game is comprised of two, 23 minute halves on a running clock.
* We typically have three guys on the field and two guy substitutes waiting to come in.
* Typically if you are on the field before the end of the half, you don't start the 2nd half (unless you subbed in with less than one minute to play before the end of the half)
* However, players typically won't leave the field with less than 2 minutes on the clock in either half
* Our average shifts tend to be ~5-6 minutes...however, if the solution to this problem dictates, I could increase or decrease my per-shift time to increase my overall playing time
* We always sub in order, with the person who's been on the bench the longest being the next substitute to join the game
* Assume I am starting every game (unless your solution recommends not to start)
* I am looking for a solution to maximize my playing time, not to create an ideal substitution structure for the team


So Here It Is:
**How can I time my shifts in relation to both the running clock and when other players on my team are coming off the field to maximize my playing time?**

*Potential Issues:*

* If I start and come off the field third, I will miss the next shift (given 2 subs on the bench waiting to come in)
* If players stay on the field longer than our average shift duration, this could affect the solution strategy


Thanks everyone!  If this problem is too confusing, I will definitely clarify or just try to figure out on my own.

As (a,b) = 1, there exist integers x, y such that ax+by=1.
As a|(bn), there exists an integer k such that ak=bn.
So (ak)/n = b, which we can do as n &gt; 0
Substituting, we get ax+by=1 becomes ax+(aky)/n=1

I'm trying to show that if a certain power of the nilradical of a commutative ring with finitely many prime ideals is zero, then the ring decomposes as a product of local rings.

In an earlier exercise I proved the fact that if the conditions necessary for the Chinese remainder theorem to hold are satisfied for a commutative ring and a set of ideals, then the product of the ideals is actually equal to the intersection.  The hint for the problem is to use both this exercise and the Chinese remainder theorem.

This is exercise 1.3.3 from ""Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra"" by Siegfried Bosch.

_

What I've got:

Since the nilradical is the intersection of prime ideals, the zero ideal is that intersection to some power n, which contains the product to that same power n, which is the product of the individual prime ideals each to that power n - zero is a product of powers of prime ideals.  Then taking the product of these powers of the prime ideals minimal with respect to inclusion (there's probably a better way to filter out the unneeded ones) will also give zero.

If I can prove that these powers of remaining prime ideals satisfy the conditions for CRT, then their product zero is (because of the exercise mentioned above) equal to their intersection and CRT can be used to decompose the ring.  If I can also prove that each one of those powers is contained in only one maximal ideal, then I would have the problem finished.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to make much progress on either of those steps.

I know that when finding a derivative, the constants drop off, so I got rid of the 5, leaving me with the definite integral.

I was going to attempt to use the first fundamental theorem of calculus (*derivative of integral of f(x) = F(b) - F(a)*). Doing that would require me to find the antiderivative of the function e^-t^2.

My teacher never taught me this, so I went to [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integrals_of_exponential_functions) to try and find the way to do it. The intergral I was looking at on that page was 7th from the bottom on the list of indefinite integrals. It involves something called the ""error function"" and all of it seems too complicated to be correct.

If i were to find this antiderivative, I would have used it with the first fundamental theorem to get something like F(2x) - F(2) and then i would have taken the derivative of whatever that answer was to give me the derivative of the original integral.

Suppose we wanted to know if people get more nervous before flying in an airplane or taking a ship to their destinations. In other words, are people more afraid of falling from the sky or sinking in the ocean? Because stress levels vary a great deal across different people, perhaps it would be best to ask the same people to rate their nervousness before flying and before sailing. Nervousness will be measured by number of breaths per minute.
before flying: 14, 20, 22, 12, 14, 25, 21, 8 
before sailing: 12, 15, 23, 16, 9, 21, 17, 9

b. Write the null and alternative hypothesis for this example.

My thoughts are to look at the prime factors of each and how the fact that those sets are disjoint leads to a contradiction.  Since any divisor of mn would have to be some combination of those prime factors multiplied together (that is, if d|mn, then d cannot have a prime factor not listed in the factors of m and n), it can't possibly divide m+n evenly because it would either ONLY a) divide m evenly, b) divide n evenly, c) divide neither evenly depending on what combination of factors d is.

1343851926.0	xiv93	Traveling to Andromeda in twenty years using binomial expansion and probably a rocket of some sort.	occasionalphysicist	6	1	6	"Hi there, I've posted a couple of times here before. I'm not actually a student and this isn't homework. I am however a physics/astrophysics enthusiast and I'm currently working through the textbook: *Spacetime Physics, An Introduction to Special Relativity: 2nd ed, Taylor and Wheeler.*

The question below is the last question in series of four. It recommends using binomial expansion to obtain the answer. Unfortunately I haven't retained much of my knowledge of that subject from my school years so I'm posting here in hope of receiving a quick walkthrough of how it should be done in this question. I think I have the correct answer to the question from using 'my own' method of calculation. I've included the lead-in to clear up any possible sources of misunderstanding.

Assume the Earth-Andromeda distance to be exactly two million lightyears in the Earth frame, treat Earth and Andromeda as points and neglect any relative motion between Earth and Andromeda.

**d** Set the rocket time for the one-way trip to 20 years, which is all the time you want to spend getting to Andromeda. In this case, what is your speed as a decimal fraction of the speed of light? Solutions to many exercises in this text are simplified by using the following approximation, which is the first two terms in the binomial expansion

(1+z)^n ≈ 1+n*z if |z|&lt;&lt;1

So as I mentioned above I didn't use that approximation, my method was roughly:

20 years in rocket frame. Space separation for rocket is 0.

Using *(earth time separation)^2* - *(earth space separation)^2* = *(interval)^2* = *(rocket time separation)^2* - *(rocket space separation)^2*

*interval*=20

*earth time*=20*sqrt(10000000001)

So now we have the time and a distance. Divide the distance by the time and you get 0.99999999995000 which is the decimal fraction of the speed of light at which the rocket would be travelling relative to the Earth frame.

So, there's a method that successfully arrives at the correct answer - however I'd be really keen for you guys to show how it would be done using binomial expansion.

So, there are items, tags and users. Users may vote on items (upvote or downvote, like reddit), which adds or removes points to/from the item.

Now what I want to do is reduce the effect users have on the score of items who consistently upvote or downvote items with particular tags.

Currently I'm looking at all the tags the item has, and then for each tag, looking at how many times the user has upvoted and downvoted items with that tag. I end up with a value from 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being that the user votes on that tag entirely in an upwards or downwards direction and 1.0 being that the user upvotes that tag half the time and downvotes the tag the other half of the time.

Don't worry, it gets worse...

Once I have this value for each of the tags attached to the item, I average it (cue screaming) and use that result as the amount of points to add or subtract from the item's score.

I am quite terrible when it comes to maths (you don't say), but I know enough to know that my solution is very flawed.

For one thing, a seldom used tag could be attached to the item that the user has only voted on once before, so you end up with 1.0 or 0.0 depending on if the vote direction matches the previous vote direction. I think this value shouldn't be considered as useful as the value for a tag that a user has voted on thousands of times.

---
The text I'm using (well, lecture notes, actually) defines the differential as follows:

* Let M1 and M2 be regular embedded surfaces in R3 and f from M1 to M2 be a smooth map.  Then for every p in M1, we define a mapping dfp from TpM1 to Tf(p)M2 (tangent spaces at p, f(p)) as follows: Let v be in TpM1, and let Yv from (-e,e) to M1 be a curve such that Yv(0)=p and Y'v(0)=v.  Then we set dfp:=(f o Yv)'(0)

Then it asks to show that dfp is well defined (independent of the smooth linear extension) and linear and gives the following hint: let g be a smooth extension of f to an open neighborhood of M.  Then dgp is well defined.  Show that for all v in TpM, dfp(v)=dgp(v)

---

The text next defines the shape operator Sp:=-dnp where n is the normal vector at p (it's not really clear on this point), and asks to show that the Shape Operator can be viewed as a linear operator on TpM.  I don't think I can tackle this part without understanding the previous question.

Before I change it for the final submission, I want to a) know that he's right and I'm wrong, and b) understand why, because I'll have to do Shell Method problems on the final exam and I've struggled with them all along and I want to really understand the material.

[Here's a screenshot of the problem with a 2D graph of the region being rotated](http://i.imgur.com/7uH5u.jpg)

[Here's a screenshot of how I set up the integral in Mathematica (using the Shell Method)](http://i.imgur.com/fuSh2.jpg)

Setting it up this way gives an answer of 455pi/3. My logic was that the region being rotated is 2 away from the axis of rotation (the y-axis), since the region I'm rotating starts at x = 2.

My group-mate says that the integral should be set up this way:

2pi * the integral from 2 to 3 of x*(0 - (16 - x^4)) dx. Setting it up this way gives an answer of 425pi/3. He says that it should be 0 - f(x), not 2 - f(x), but wouldn't tell me why (he mentioned something about g(x) being 0, but refused to explain it further). If this is true, an explanation would be helpful!

I'm using log base 10 here because it's easiest to represent my question. I understand why the natural log makes the most sense for doing this because of the relationship between complex numbers and e.

I found out that log(-x) = log(x) + log(-1) (about 1.364i) if x is positive. This makes sense, but it runs into problems when using the log product property.

log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)
log(10) = log(-2) + log(-5)
= log(2) + log(-1) + log(5) + log(-1)
= log(2) + log(5) + log(-1) + log(-1)

It seems there's two ways to evaluate this. The first way is to just evaluate each term and add. This gives 1 + 2.729i. 

The second way is to group log(-1) + log(-1) into 2log(-1) = log((-1)^2) = log(1) = 0. Evaluating it like this gives simply 1. 

So, my question is this ... which way is ""more correct"" to do? Is there some other definition of log(ab) when using negative numbers that accounts for the 1.36i that pops up if you take log(-1)?"	t5_2rbfw	True

1331240975.0	qnul4	[Real Analysis] Sequence of functions, uniform convergence	wrigleysextra123	9	5	0	"Define a sequence (f_n) of functions on R by putting  f_n(x) := x/(1+nx^2 ) for each natural number N and for each real x. Let f(x) be the limit of the sequence (f_n(x)) and g(x) be the limit of the sequence (f_n ' (x)) (the derivative of (f_n(x))). Find f and g. Find all intervals I where the sequences are uniformly convergent. For what x is f'(x) = g(x)?

Here are my thoughts on the problem, from beginning to the end:

It seems that lim_(n -&gt; infty) (x / (1+nx^2 )) = 0 for all x so f(x) = 0.

(f _ n '(x)) = (1-nx^2 )/(nx^2 +1)^2 so lim_(n -&gt; infty)(f _ n'(x)) = lim _ (n -&gt; infty) ( (1/n) - x^2) / (nx^2 + 2x^2 + (1/n)) ) = 0 as well.

So far it seems that g(x) = f(x) = 0.

When I look at solutions of these sort of problems it seems like the maxima of the sequences are found. By inspections of (f_n ' (x)) we see that (f_n ' (x)) = 0 when 1-nx^2 = 0 i.e. when x = +/- 1 / sqrt(n)
From plotting or a few calculations we see that the sequence takes its maxima in the positive solution.

Now, the standard procedure is apparently to insert the maxima into the absolute value |f(1/sqrt(n)) - f_n(1/sqrt(n))| = |f_n(1/sqrt(n)| = 1/2*sqrt(n) -&gt; 0 when n approaches infinity. From this we see that f_n is uniformly convergent, although my textbook doesn't have any theorems or definitions that incorporate any suprema or maxima (I'd greatly appreciate some insight in this matter).

Similar calculations give that (f_n ' (x)) takes its maxima in sqrt(3/n), but here |f_n ' (x)| = 1/8 so f_n ' (x) is not uniformly convergent.

The last question is the one that raised a warning flag. Assuming all my calculations are correct, f'(x) = g(x) for all x since both are the zero function. I think it is suspicious how trivial my answer is.

1324510191.0	nlvjn	[Linear Algebra] Pretty sure my textbook is wrong for this determinant question but I'm not sure why (a bit long, bear with me)	speenatch	6	1	3	"I've summarised my problem in the **tl;dr** tag at the bottom, so check that out first if you need to.

So the question is: Using the determinant, find conditions on *a* and *b* for the matrix

        [1  a   b ]
    A = [1 a^2 b^2]
        [1 a^3 b^3]

to be non-singular.

This question is practise for calculating possible determinants, so the method we're using is to find when det(A) = 0 and simply say that whenever those conditions aren't met, the matrix is non-singular.

Using the diagonals we find:

det(A) = (a^2 b^3 + ab^2 + a^3 b) - (a^2 b + a^3 b^2 + ab^3 )

= ab (ab^2 + b + a^2 - a - a^2 b - b^2 )

And all of this is straight out of the textbook. The book then ignores that mess in the brackets (I'll be referring to this mess again, so let's call it D) and says that we can find the other factors by knowing that det(A) = 0 when any two columns are identical, ie when

    a = b, or a = 1, or b = 1.
So, the remaining factors are

    (a - b), (a - 1), and (b - 1).

And I'm still following along fine. But then it makes this jump in logic, and here's where my issue is. It says that these represent the factors of D (that bracketed mess), so

    det(A) = (ab)(a-b)(a-1)(b-1).

But I've expanded these factors and found that in fact expands not to D, but to -D; it's all negated for some reason. Where did the textbook go wrong? Or have I not understood it properly? Or maybe the fact that it's negative doesn't matter?

**tl;dr: The factors of a long expression ""D"" were found using an alternate method, but multiplying out these factors gives -D instead. What's gone wrong?**

1321410315.0	mdva6	Help with Matrix Transformation Interpretation -- Physics	NuneShelping	5	0	6	"Hi.  

I am working on an optics problem in the lab I work in and am running into a bit of mathematical confusion and was hoping someone could verify a theory I have about what is going on or shed light on a new one.  

In essence, I am tracking how a 2-dimensional complex vector transforms through an optical device.  I have run physical simulations and experiments to verify, and am now trying to model the phenomenon in a more elegant mathematical manner.  As such, I am trying to construct a transformation matrix.  

My initial methodology for constructing this matrix was to send through the simulation the two states which describe the basis, that is [1,0] and [0,1].  In doing so, I created my transformation matrix with the output of those two states as the columns.  This works for all input states, however does not generalize as much as I'd like because it still requires the simulation.  

Next, I began to think about how my resultant matrix could come about, and determined that it is the product of a series of rotation matrices and a singular ""phase"" matrix, which is a diagonal matrix of the form exp(i*t1) and exp(i*t2).  

In constructing my transformation matrix in this way, I am getting a resultant matrix which differs from my initial, simulation-constructed matrix, by having its indexes ""cross-swapped"", as if being multiplied on both sides by the row-exchanged version of the identity matrix (diagonal in / direction, not \ direction).

My question for you all, then, is what does sandwiching a transformation matrix with this identity-cousin matrix do?  I am curious if this serves as a means to change ""handedness"" in some way, because after simulating the phenomenon, I end up with the light pointing antiparallel, and consequently need to ""adjust"" the results to switch its handedness back.  

In essence, I know how to make the transformation matrix work, but I want clarity on whether or not I have geometrical justification on the matter.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Please ask for further clarification if anything is confusing -- I didn't want to get into the nitty gritty of the physics if I don't need to, but can if desired.

TL;DR: Does multiplying a transformation matrix by the row-exchanged identity matrix on both sides serve as a transform to ""flip handedness""?"	t5_2rbfw	True

I think my problem lies in the fact that you need to somehow set up the series so the summation is only adding every other value (for parts a and b, part c would be every third value). As in, the series 1/(2^n) represents the series in part A, where Man A eats the summation of all odd values n, and Man B eats the summation of all even values n. I don't know how to express this formally, or even necessarily how to compute this sum. If I could even figure out how just problem 1 works, I think I'd have no problem with the other two.

I'm using Maple 15 to obtain the determinant using this equation:

Determinant(C) * IdentityMatrix(4) = C * Adjoint(C)

Where Adjoint() basically means to take the adjugate of C, and yes, I know that's not how you multiply matrices in Maple 15, I'm just demonstrating the equation.

Naturally, I want the determinant of C, which I know is 30 from previous problems on the assignment. When I multiply C and the adjugate of C, I get the Identity matrix scaled by 30, which is great! That's good! But maybe the professor *coughwho'sneveravailablecough* wants me to have it so that the result of my commands is a big number 30.

So basically, it's this; I have an Identity matrix scaled by 30. It looks like this, just so that we're on the same page here:

This is not a math question, it's more of a program usage question. If there isn't a function that can do this for me then that's fine, I guess, I'll just turn this in as my input function:

30 * IdentityMatrix(4) = C.Adjoint(C);

This creates the same matrix on both sides and proves that 30 is the determinant, but it isn't really *finding* the determinant per se as it is showing that I know that I can divide C.Adjoint(C) by 30 and get the identity matrix (hah, is that what I'm supposed to do or what?)"	t5_2rbfw	True

""Ms. Adams, Ms. Saunders, and three other players on a women's softball team are know by their first and middle names together, rather than by just their first names; one is known as Ida Lee, and one name of another is lou. One of the five plays third base. From the clues that follow, can you determine each woman's full name and team position?

1)   No two of the five middle names begin with the same letter

2)   The one whose first name is Mary plays shortstop.

3)   One's middle name is Sue; she is not Ms. Irving

4)   Marie is one name of the woman who plays second base

5)   The one whose first or middle name is Jane plays first base; her other given name is not Lou

6)   One of Ms. Luce's given names is Sarah

7)   One's first name is Anne, and another's middle name is Anne: one of the two is Ms. Madison, who doesn't play first base, and the other is the catcher

8)   The middle and last names of only two women begin with the same letter""


-Problem by Margaret Shoop



I got far as finding all the names ---&gt;

First: Ida, Lou, Mary, Anne, Sarah

Middle: Lee, Sue, Anne, Jane, Marie

Last: Ms. Adams, Ms Saunders, Ms Luces, Ms Madison, and Ms Irving

I also figured out that one person's name is Sarah Jane Luces who plays first base. Other than that, I have pretty much nothing. And I'm not even sure what I have is right. Any thing in particular I should look at that I might be missing? I'm sorta ashamed I can't figure this out. Thanks for the help!

Which grows faster: (n!)! or ((n-1)!)!(n-1)!^n!

My first approach was to replace n-1 with n in the second formula to get (n!)!n!^(n+1)! which would clearly grow faster than than the first formula, but I realized that this argument was using some iffy logic.

The back of the book merely gives the solution with a small hint: Take logarithms to show that (n!)! wins.

Well ok, let's take some logarithms.  We get

    log[(n!)!]

        = log[n!(n!-1)(n!-2)...(n-1)!((n-1)!-1)((n-1)!-2)...3\*2\*1]

        = log[n!(n!-1)(n!-2)...((n-1)!+2)((n-1)!+1)((n-1)!)!]

        = log n! + log(n!-1) + log(n!-2) + ... + log((n-1)!+2) + log((n-1)!+1) + log((n-1)!)!

and

    log[ ((n-1)!)!(n-1)!^n! ] = log((n-1)!)! + n! log(n-1)!

Alright, well this means that all we have to show is that

    log n! + log(n!-1) + log(n!-2) + ... + log((n-1)!+2) + log((n-1)!+1)

increases faster than

    n! log(n-1)!

I can't really say that this is much simpler.  In fact, removing the logs we get back to the original problem of showing that (n!)!/((n-1)!)! increases faster than (n-1)!^n! .

Now, without going into too much detail, you are a double agent (a cylon) if you possess 1 or more ""You are a Cylon"" cards. So, you could potentially have a couple non-cylon cards, and one cylon card, and that will make you a cylon.

During this game, there were 6 players, and there was a pool of 13 cards, 2 of them being ""You are a Cylon"" cards, the other 11 not. Everyone but 1 person had been dealt 2 cards, and the last person, the person I'm interested in, had been dealt 3 cards.

At one point in the game, 2 of the cards had been shown to not be ""You are a Cylon"" cards, and the 2 cards I was holding were not Cylon cards either. So that left 9 unknown cards, 2 of them still ""You are a Cylon"" cards.

So, what are the odds that the person who possessed 3 of the 9 remaining unknown cards had 1 or more ""You are a Cylon"" cards?

I want to just divide 3 by 9 and say 33.3%, but I know that's incorrect. I was told that it's something like 58%, but the explanation given to me didn't make sense. Could someone kindly explain to me the logic behind determining whether a person holding 3 of the 9 unknown cards was holding either one or both of the 2 ""Cylon"" cards?"	t5_2rbfw	True

Exercise: determine a formula for the number of distinguishable waysto color the edges of a regular pentagon using q colors, up to symmetries of pentagon (including rotations and reflextions).

Sol. 1/10 ( q^5 + 4q^3 + 5q)

explanation: q^5 accounts for the 'identity' element with q possibilities for colors for each of the 5 sides unchanged, 4q^3 is accounting for the 4 rotations of an edge(72 degrees, -72degrees, 144 degrees, -144degrees) which each leave 3 sides unchanged, and 5q is accounting for the 5 reflections (1 through each vertex) which leave 1 side (the side opposite the vertex) unchanged.

A fault line is a vertical or horizontal line along which the tiling may be divided into two parts without splitting a domino in half.  The following is Brualdi's reasoning that all tilings of a 4x4 board have a fault line.

----

Assume that a tiling with no fault line exists.  Let x1, x2, and x3 be the number of dominoes split by the three horizontal lines on the board.  By hypothesis, x1, x2, and x3 are all positive.  **A horizontal domino covers two squares in a row, while a vertical domino covers one square in each of two rows.  From these facts we conclude that x1, x2, and x3 are even.**  Hence

    x1 + x2 + x3 &gt;= 6.

That is, there are at least 6 vertical dominoes in the cover.  A similar argument can be used to show that there are at least 6 horizontal dominoes as well.  However, the board can only fit 8 dominoes in total, a contradiction.

1367470967.0	1dj8tx	Graph Theory Question -- Sophomore Undergrad x-post from r/math	graphtheoryquestion	4	0	4	"So this isn't actually a homework question, but more of a curiosity I was hoping for some input on:

My discrete mathematics course just finished a unit on graph theory, and there was one question that was thinking about recently. It asks you to prove that given a tree T on n greater than or equal to 2 vertices, prove that there are at least two vertices of degree one.

Now the obvious way to go about this is to do a proof by contradiction: Suppose there are NOT at least two vertices of degree one. Suppose there is at most one. So we have then (n-1) vertices with degree 2 and at most with degree 1. Then we have (2*(n-1)+1)/2 edges (since each edge connects two vertices). Now this works out to having n - (1/2) edges, so we need n edges. But we know a tree on n nodes has exactly n-1 edges, so we have our contradiction and thus T needs to have at least two vertices with degree one. (the case is clear if none of T's vertices have degree 1 -- that is they all have degree greater than or equal to two).
So that wasn't bad. But I thought of a different way to prove it and was wondering -- just out of curiosity -- if it worked as well. It goes as follows:

Suppose for a contradiction T has no vertices of degree one. Then all vertices have degree greater than or equal to two. Then pick a vertex, b. Start from b, and walk around T in any direction. At every vertex, we will be able to ""come in"" and ""come out"" since all have degree greater than or equal to two. Sooner or later we will end up back at b or at a vertex through which we have already passed. Thus T will have a cycle, which is a contradiction since we assumed T was a tree. So T must have at least one vertex of degree 1.

But now we look at the case where T has just one vertex of degree one.

Suppose for a contradiction T has just one vertex with degree one, call it v. Then we have v connected to a subgraph, call it H, of T where every vertex will have degree greater than or equal to 2. Vertex v must connect to some vertex in H. Call that vertex x. Now remove v. If x still has degree greater than or equal to 2, H must have a cycle (as we can imagine ourselves starting a walk at x and going into and out of each vertex until we end up at x or some other vertex where we have already walked). Since H has a cycle, T could not have been a tree and we have the desired contradiction. If x has degree one after the removal of v, then H still must have a cycle. We can see this by noting that we have a second subgraph where x connects by one vertex, call it z, to all the others. All the others must have degree greater than or equal to 2 and by the same argument must contain a cycle and again we have a contradiction. So if T has just one vertex of degree one, it contains a cycle, is not a tree, and since if it had no vertices of degree one it would also be a tree, T must have at least two vertices of degree one.

we aren't taught explicitly how to do that, and looking it up, it's an extremely difficult improper integral regardless...

we're taught to look at what the laplace transform of y(t) looks like and try to relate it to functions we know the laplace transform of, and play a stupid matching game.

The vertical seam on the cylinder is welded together and the top and bottom are attached by a pressing/sealing machine. The pressing/sealing process requires approximately 13/16 inches from the top and bottom cylinder and 3/4 inches from the edge of the disk to be curled together and hence these inches are lost in the final dimensions.

Can someone explain why the y(t)= sin(pi*9)+pi*cos(9*pi)*t function is incorrect? 

[SOLVED]

If you simplify the sin(9 * pi) you get 0 so the first equation x(t)=cos(9 * pi) 
 
For y(t) you need to change t so that at t=9 you get the equation of the given line. To do this you have to change (t) to equal (t-9) so plugged in with cos(9 * pi) simplified to -1, the result is -pi(t-9)

if we apply this change in t to z(t) we get
z(t) = 27 + 3(t-9) = 27 + 3t -27 = 3t.

So that's the reason why y(t) was false and the others were correct. Thanks for the input!"	t5_2rbfw	True

a) sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) &gt; 1

b) If n is an integer such that n^2 is even, then n is even.

c) If n= m^3 - m for some integer m, then n is a multiple of 6

----------------------------------------------------------

I will rely on P - &gt; Q and not Q - &gt; not P to try and prove the above statements.

a) I think I cant use direct proof (P - &gt; Q) here, because no matter how true Q is, it wont say anything important about P which is the statement sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) &gt; 1. Instead, I will use contradiction.

Contradiction: not P - &gt; Q(false), not Q - &gt; P

sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) ≤ 1

6- sqrt(24) + 2 ≤ 1

2sqrt(12) ≤ 3 (false statement). Negating this statement makes sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) &gt; 1 true.

b) n^2 is even - &gt; n = 2m for any integer m

If we assume not P, then n^2 can be assumed to be odd: (1+ 2m)^2 = 1+ 4m+ 4m^2 = 1+ 4(m+m^2 ) which is false because we are given that n^2 is even.

From here it's obvious that n should be even to avoid contradiction.

c) not P: 1+ 6m = m^3 - m where n is not a multiple of 6.

To force n to be a non-multiple of 6, we can divide n by 6 such that it yields remainder of 1 or 2. Then n = 1 + 6m is the non-multiple of 6.


1+ 6m = m^3 - m

0= m^3 - 7m -1 ( I will assume that this result is false because solving for x introduces imaginary numbers which I am not sure if I am allowed to work with).

Obviously, n is a multiple of 6.

This is quite easy for some compartments that only require, for example, the deck to be worked on. My problem is with calculating surface area of a bilge. Bilges are the lowest compartments of a ship. In bilges there are usually countless pipes, compartments of all sizes and shapes, rails, beams etc. Taking actual surface area measurements takes me about 2 hours per bilge. I am looking for advice on ways to expedite this. 

Here is an example of what a bilge might look like. Imagine a 20x40 room where the work area is 3 ft high. So just the deck alone would be 20x40=800 square feet. Above the deck imagine that there are cubes which are all 2x3. So in a 20x40 room you would have 100 cubes with no ceiling ( as the deck plates revealing them are removed). Each cube is 2x3 thus each cubes surface area would be 30 square feet. Since there are 100 cubes this would make 3000 square feet. Thus total square footage of the bilge would be somewhere close to 3000 square feet. 

The problem is that the usual bilge is nowhere near as nice as this. Can anyone think of something to help me estimate surface area of the entire bilge (including rails, pipes etc)? Ive thought about finding volume instead and multiplying it by 1.5 if there is not a lot of ""other""  structures above the deck and 2.5 if there are a lot of structures above deck that would add to the total surface area.

1356387945.0	15e6nu	Sturm-Liouville problem, finding eigenvalues/functions	trm90	5	1	3	"Hi guys. 

So I've been given the equation 

(1 - x^2 ) y'' + xy ' = ky

I have three tasks. The first is to rewrite this differential equation in the form L_x [y] = kwy where w is a weight function and L_x is a differential operator in *self-adjoint* form. I'm then asked to show that using a substitution x = cos(t) I can rewrite the differential equation in the form

d^2 y / dt^2 = -k y

And the final problem is to solve for the k eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors, given the boundary conditions y(-1) = y(1) = 0

So far I think I've done the first task. My working:

First I divided the equation by (1- x^2 ) to get

y'' + [x/(1 - x^2 )] y' = -ky/(1 - x^2 ) 

Next, I want to multiply each term by a weight function which is determined by w(x) = exp[int b(x)/a(x) dx], where a(x) = 1 and b(x) = x/(1-x^2 ). By using a substitution u = 1 - x^2 , I fairly quickly determined w(x) to be w(x) = rt(u) = rt(1 - x^2 ).

Multiplying everything by w(x) we can now rewrite the operator in the form

-d/dx (rt(1 - x^2 ) y') = ky/(rt(1-x^2 ))

Working backwards, this seems to check out, so I feel like I've done this part fine. The next part (to rewrite in terms of t using the substitution) was also okay. But I'm a bit stuck with solving the equation.

From y_tt = -k y, the solution clearly has the form 

y = A cos(rt(k) t) + B sin (rt(k) t) 

from the boundary conditions we see that y is actually an even function, so the sine term cannot exist. Thus we have y = A cos(rt(k) t). From the boundary conditions, y(x = 1), y(x = -1) transformed is y(t = pi), y(t = -pi).  Thus we know that A cos(rt(k) * pi) = A cos (- rt(k) * pi) = 0, so that rt(k) = (n + 1/2) -&gt; k = (n+1/2)^2 . 

However, I'm stuck on the normalisation condition. For Hilbert spaces we know that that inner product &lt; y_m | y_n &gt;_w = 1 (i.e. with respect to the weight function), which is the integral

B^2 int(-1 to 1) rt(1 - x^2 )  cos((m + 1/2)t) cos((n + 1/2)t) dx. 

As x = cost, we rewrite the limits as -pi to pi, dx = -sint dt, and w(t) = sint. Thu we have the integral:

 B^2 * int(-pi to pi) sin^2 t cos((m + 1/2) t) cos((n + 1/2) t) dt = -1

I have no idea how to evaluate this integral though! I'm aware that n must equal m for the integral to be normalised but I'm totally sure it's not right. Can anyone point me in the right direction? "	t5_2rbfw	True

There is a little trick to this problem. In general, the surface of intersection of two other surfaces is the set of points that satisfies the equations for both those surfaces, as you probably figured out.

In this particular problem, if you look at the equations for the given surfaces, the quadratic terms are the same, except for a factor of 2. Thus you can replace the quadratic terms in one equation with a linear quantity in the variables, that you get from the other equation. Then you will get the equation of a plane, which is the intersection of the surfaces. "	t5_2rbfw	True

She's in the advanced math group so she thinks it should all come easily to her, and she gets super frustrated when it 'doesn't make sense'. 

The problem was figuring the area of a square field that was 1/2 mile on each side.  

She expects area to be a larger number than the length of a side, since that's what happens when you work with sides that have a length greater than 1 unit.  

The fact that the answer to this math problem was a smaller number than the length of the side was simply impossibly wrong in her mind.  

We tried drawing a diagram to explain it.  We tried talking about multiplying fractions of apples to explain it.  I tried an absurd vignette where I was trying to sell her a square mile of field for $1,000,000 to explain it.  Just before we left for school, she started asking about dividing the drawing of the field into 1/8 mile squares &amp; then adding them up, but then we ran out of time &amp; she had to leave (in tears because it didn't make sense, still)

I told her just to trust the math &amp; not worry about understanding 'why' or having it make sense, but she's not having any of that - she must understand!

How would you explain this concept?  Does anyone out there have any other ideas for ways we can approach this?  

I'm hoping her math teacher makes it make sense for her today at school.  Or, thinking that it may be one of those things that just needs to fall into place in her mind, once she calms down &amp; stops trying to force it to fit with her preconceived expectations.  "	t5_2rbfw	True

I find the cross product of the normal vectors:

I've been casually reading some General Topology over the summer and despite going through several chapters, I am having trouble building up a good list of potential examples and counter examples.

For example, I read in a textbook that the derived set is closed and I couldn't believe that was true from what I learned in Analysis. I eventually found a counterexample:

X = {0,1,2} and T = { {}, {0}, {X} }.

My problem now is that I don't know how much bang for my buck I'm going to get out of this example. My question is, if you had to choose up to 10 examples of topological spaces to use as either examples or counter examples to a statement, what would you use?

I ask because in the past, I've come up with a pretty crappy list of stock examples in past topics and my studies suffered for it

PS. I feel really bad about asking this because there is apparently a book called Counterexamples in Topology. Is that precisely what I am looking for? I don't like the examples in Munkres because I feel like at times the examples are more complicated than they need to be.

I can solve using a graph and everything alright, but with these two qustions (and a few that are like them) I just don't know how to make the equations so I can solve them because they are so confusing!

Question:

""Laura is 3 times as old as Maria was when Laura was as old as Maria is now. In 2 years, Laura will be twice as old as Maria was 2 years ago. Find their present ages.""

- For this problem I get lost at the first sentence. So at one point L=3M, but how long ago?? the next sentence comes out to be L+2= 2(M-2) if I'm not mistaken.

Question 2:

Mary is 3 times as old as Linda was when Mary was as old as Linda is now. Find the relationship between Mary's present age (m) and linda's (l).

- So again, M = 3L, but the answer says M=3/2 L.. where did the 2 come from? Because there are two people??

* 33 pairs of switches in a line, lets say each pair has a switch A and a switch B
* If both switch A and B of any one pair fail, the system fails
* If switch A of any pair fails as well as switch B of an adjacent pair, the system fails

I need to calculate the chance of complete system failure given a number of failed switches. So for example:

* 1 failed switch: 0% chance of complete failure
* 2 failed switches: C(66,2) = 2145 combinations. 97 (33 pairs + 2 * 32 adjacent) lead to complete failure. 97 out of 2145 = 4.52% chance of failure.

Find points of relative extrema, the intervals on which the function is increasing &amp; decreasing on for k(x)=x^4 + 2x^2 -4, f:R-&gt;R.

This is a real analysis problem, so I want to know how to make my solution rigorous in the appropriate way. Find points of relative extrema, the intervals on which the function is increasing &amp; decreasing on for k(x)=x^4 + 2x^2 - 4, f:R-&gt;R. 

The First Derivative Test for Extrema states: Let f be continuous on the interval I=[a,b] and let c be an interior point of I. Assume that f is differentiable on (a,c) and (c,b). Then:

1. If there is a neighborhood (c-d,c+d) subset of I such that f '(x)&gt;=0 for c-d &lt; x &lt; c and f'(x)&lt;=0 for c &lt; x &lt; c+d, then f has a relative maximum at c.

2. If there is a neighborhood (c-d,c+d) subset I such that f '(x)&lt;=0 for c-d &lt; x &lt; c and f'(x)&gt;=0 for c &lt; x &lt; c+d, then f has a relative minimum at c.

Doing it the old fashion Calculus way first I obtain,

k(x)=x^4 + 2x^2 - 4

k'(x)=4x^3 + 4x

Find the critical points:

k'(x)=4x(x^2 + 1)

set:

4x=0 =&gt; x=0

x^2 + 1 = 0 =&gt; x is not a real number

So, the critical point is x=0.

To test whether 0 is a relative max/min

I check numbers to the left/right of it so:

1. f'(-1)=-8 
2. f'(1)=8

So, this meets condition 2. f has a local minimum at x=0.

The funciton is decreasing from (-inf,0) &amp; increasing (0,inf)

Given the old calculus way to do it, how do I prove this result using the condition :

2. If there is a neighborhood (c-d,c+d) subset I such that f'(x)&lt;=0 for c-d &lt; x &lt; c and f'(x)&gt;=0 for c &lt; x &lt; c+d, then f has a relative minimum at c.

Addition, and multiplication don't require proof since they are given as axioms.

The following is my progress:

Let `[; P_n = \{X \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}^+})| \; |X|=n \};]`, thus `[;P = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} P_n;]`.

If P is denumerable, for all `[;n \in \mathbb{N};]`, then  the countable union `[;\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} P_n = P;]` of countable sets is countable.

Now, I show that `[;P_n;]` is denumerable for all `[;n \in \mathbb{N};]`.

For n=0, `[;P_0=\{\emptyset\};]` so `[;P_0;]` is countable.

Suppose `[;n \geq 0;]` and `[;P_n;]` is denumerable, hence `[;P_n \sim \mathbb{Z}^+ \sim (\mathbb{Z}^{+})^n ;]`. I must show that `[;P_{n+1};]` is denumerable.

Since `[;P_{n} \sim (\mathbb{Z}^+)^n;]` and `[;P_1 \sim \mathbb{Z}^+;]`, then `[;P_n \times P_1 \sim (\mathbb{Z}^+)^n \times \mathbb{Z}^+ \sim \mathbb{Z}^+;]`.

All that remains is to somehow relate `[;P_{n+1};]` to `[;|P_n \times P_1|;]`.

EDIT: My step-by-step calculations got botched in coding (I'm horrible with TeX) but I guess the methods and the results are clear

$d(F, G)/(d(y, z) = 3$

so according to the implicit function theorem we can proceed:

in the point $(1, 0, -1)$ we get


$dy/dx = - ( d(F, G) / d(x, z) ) / ( d(F, G) / d(y, z) ) = 0$

and in $(1, 0, -1)$ we get

$dz/dx = - (d(F, G)/d(y, x))/(d(F, G)/d(y, z)) = -1/3$

What occurred to me was to take the equation $x+xy+z^3 = 0$ and isolate $z=(-x*(1+y))^{1/3}$  and then put it into $sin(xyz)=0$ to gain $sin(x^{4/3}*y(1+y)^{1/3}) = 0$.

[WA Link](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%3Dx%2C+x+%3D2%2C+x%3D4%2C+)

I believe I have it solved with the shell method (ended up with 2pi*(38/3) doing it that way), but this is from the section on the disk method. I can't seem to figure it out with the disk method for whatever reason. 

The work I've done so far mostly consists of splitting the integral up into two parts, with one integral going from y = 0 to y = 2, and the other going from y = 2 to y = 4 to account for the fact that the bottom of the region is just a square with side length 2 and thus the radius remains constant. This yields the integral from 0 to 2 of the constant 3pi, which, after doing the definite integral, equals 6pi. I'm not sure this step is correct, but it's what I have so far. I can't figure out what to do after this step. I don't know what area I'm trying to integrate from y = 2 to y = 4. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So here is what I have so far...

1. I know that the subgroups of a group have orders corresponding to the divisors of the order of the group (if |G|=12, the the subgroups have orders of 1,2,3,4,6, and 12), so this would mean that if there is only one nontrivial proper subgroup (only one of them has more than one element), then |G| must be a prime number (call it p) squared so that its only divisors (and thus the orders of its subgroups) are either 1 or p (it can't be p^2 otherwise it isn't a proper subgroup). This would make it have only trivial subgroups or subgroups of a single other order (namely p).

As for the showing that it is cyclic part I don't have very much to go on yet. Any revisions that can be offered to my reasoning above would be appreciated and any insight into the cyclic part of the problem would also be great!

2. I have no idea where to start on this :)

3. Based on a google search, I found that the answer to this problem is that |a| is either odd or infinite, but I have been just trying some numbers for |a| and wonder why it is that |a| couldn't be even?

For instance, if |a| = 3, then a^3=e, and so for (a^2 )^3 = a^6 = (a^3 )^2 = (e)^2 = e thus |a^2 | = 3 also.

But I can make a similar argument for an even order of the element a... if |a| = 4, then a^4 = e, and so for (a^2 )^4 = a^8 = (a^4 )^2 = (e)^2 = e thus |a^2 | = 4. 

This seems to contradict what I think is the right answer, so I want to know where I went wrong with this reasoning. Any other help that you can provide on this would also be really appreciated!

""The usual ordering of Z (integers) by &lt; is transitive and behaves nicely with respect to addition. Show that there is no ordering of Z mod n such that:

i) if a&lt;b and b&lt;c, then a&lt;c;
ii) if a&lt;b, then a+c&lt;b+c for every c in Z mod n.""

It gives a hint: 

If there is such an ordering with 0&lt;1, then adding 1 repeatedly to both sides shows that 0&lt;1&lt;2&lt;...&lt;n-1 by (ii). Thus 0&lt;n-1 by (i). Add 1 to each side and get a contradiction. Make a similar argument when 1&lt;0.


So what I've tried doing is setting 0&lt;(b-a). Then I generated some inequalities by adding 1 to both sides, getting 1&lt;(b-a)+1, 2&lt;(b-a)+2, etc. I then ordered them, attempting to get something similar to the hint, so I have now 0&lt;(b-a)+2. Adding 1 to both sides gives 1&lt;(b-a)+3, which appears to not be a contradiction. Another thing I can think of is that since it's in mod n, [0&lt;(b-a)]=[nk&lt;(b-a)].

I'm getting a little mixed up with [these](http://imgur.com/T52kS), and don't know if I'm screwing up the integral or the anti-derivative, or if I'm forgetting some nuance of algebra.

 So from what I understand, the anti-derivative is just the reverse of the derivative, or the 'original function'. 

To calculate an integral, I take the function of the integral, get the anti-derivative, and then use antiderivative(t) - antiderivative(a).

..but it's not quite working out that way for me.

Here's a starting problem that will hopefully set me on track to do the rest of these on my own:

-------------------------
**int(t,a) e^(-x^2) 2x dx**

-------------------------

I know that the derivative of e^x is e^x, so the above becomes -2e^-x^2 , right? But then there's the 2x. I know that the anti-derivative of *that* is x^2 . So that would mean F(x) = -2e^-x^2 * x^2.

   ...but then if I use the fundamental theorem for the integral, that makes -2e^-t^2  t^2 - -2e^-a^2  a^2 .

But the software that I'm using to check the problem says int[t,a] e^-x^2 2x dx = -e^-t^2 - (-e^-a^2 ).

Where did the -2s go?  For that matter, where did the 2x go? Did it bring it outside the integral? But then how do I account for it?

2) Consider the integral 0∫2 sin(x^2 )dx. For what value of n do you need so that the approximation to the integral, Tn, is accurate to within .01? (Recall: |Et| ≤ K(b-a)^3 / 12n^2 , for |f’’(x)| ≤ K on a≤x≤b)

3) A trough is filled with a liquid of density 757 kg/m^3 . The ends of the trough are equilateral triangles with sides 2 m long and vertex at the bottom.

[1] Prove that the order of *b* is finite.

[2] Specify each possible order of *b*.

---

The first part I have under control: to show the order of *b* is finite, I must show there exists any positive integer *n* for which *b*^*n* = *e*. Knowing that *a*^2 = *e*, I know that *a*^-1 = a. So, *b* = (*a* *b*^3 *a*) and *b*^3 = (*a b a*).

* (*a* *b*^3 *a*)^3 = *a b a*
*  *a* *b*^3 *a* *a* *b*^3 *a* *a* *b*^3 *a* = *a b a*
*  *a* *b*^3 *e* *b*^3 *e* *b*^3 *a* = *a b a*
*  *a* *b*^9 *a* = *a b a*
*  *b*^9 = *b*
*  *b*^9 *b*^-1 = e
*  *b*^8 = e.

But this does not necessarily mean that |*b*| = 8 as |*b*| is the *smallest* positive integer *n* for which *b*^*n* = *e*, meaning 2 or 4 *could* be |*b*| (unless I overlooked something which says they can't).

**My question**: Does this satisfy the requirement to ""specify each possible order of b"" or do I have enough information to show that 2 and 4 do or do not work as |*b*|?

1318269249.0	l7abf	Simple question of vector fields and flow lines	whaleman89	4	1	0	"This should be a simple question, I don't know why I'm having trouble with it. I just want to know if my answer is right or wrong.

Consider C(t), a flow line of the vector field (del)V(x,y,z), where V is some scalar function of class C2 (meaning it's first mixed partial derivatives are equal). Suppose C(0) = (0,0,1), C(3) = (0,1,0), V(0,0,1) = -1. If |C'(t)|=e^t for all t, find V(0,1,0).

So what I have so far, from the definition of a flow line,

C'(t) = F(x,y,z) = (del)V(x,y,z). Also, V(x,y,z)=V(C(t)).

We have d/dt (V(c(t)) = (del)V(C(t))*C'(t), which from the definition = |C'(t)|^2 = e^2t, by the given information. Now if d/dt (V(C(t)) = e^2t, V(C(t)) should be found by integrating. int(e^2t)dt = (1/2)e^2t. Evaluating at t=3 we have V(C(3)) = V(0,1,0) = (1/2)e^6.

Does this look right? Any obvious mistakes? Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.

Find all solutions (x, y) such that x&gt;=0, y&gt;=0 to the equation 
199x + 449y = 449 000

Solution:

1 = 46 - 9 * 5 = 46 - 9(51 - 46) = -9 * 51 + 10 * 46 =
-9 * 51 + 10(199 - 3 * 51) = 10 * 199 - 39 * 51 =
10 * 199 - 39(449 - 2 * 199) = -39 * 449 + 88 * 199

x0 = 88 * 449000

y0 = -39 * 449000

All solutions:

x = 88 * 449000 + 449n

What is the second to last digit in 7^199202?

Solution:

7^2 = 49

7^4 = 2401

7^199200 = (7^49800 )^4 ≅ 7^4

7^199202 = 7^199200 * 7^2 ≅ 7^4 * 7^2 = 2401 * 49 = 117649 
= 49 mod 100

The second to last digit is 4.

Is it correct?

1318201565.0	l6ft8	Help with voting methods and satisfaction of the Pareto fairness condition.	BlixQuoy	4	0	0	"Hey everyone, this is my first post here, I was curious if something like this existed on reddit and, well, of course it does. Anyways, my math homework is dealing with four voting methods (plurality, plurality w/ elimination, Borda count, and pair-wise) and figuring out whether or not they satisfy the Pareto fairness condition. 
The Pareto Condition states that ""if every voter prefers candidate X over candidate Y, then a voting method should not prefer Y as the winner"". So, I worked through the problems with my logic and concluded the following.

1) Does the plurality method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition? Explain.
The plurality method states that you count the first place votes for each candidate and the one with the most votes for first place wins. The Pareto Condition states that if every voter prefers candidate X over candidate Y, then a voting method should not prefer Y as the winner. Because of the rules and definitions of the plurality method and the Pareto Condition respectively, if candidate X was preferred by every voter over candidate Y, then there is no possible way that candidate Y could have more first place votes, thus making the plurality method satisfy the Pareto Condition.

2) Does the Borda count method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition? Explain.
The best method of figuring out if a voting method satisfies a fairness condition is to try and form an instance in which that voting method violates it. If you are able to make one, it violates it, and if not, it satisfies it. Although that is true, I found the logic of the rules to be fairly straight forward with the Borda Count method and the Pareto Condition. Because the Borda Count method is based of off the logic that the candidate that is generally preferred (not necessarily with the most 1st place votes) will always win. Due to the strict rules of the Pareto Condition (if every voter prefers X over Y, then Y should not win) there is no way that a candidate who is generally less preferred than another candidate could beat that candidate.

3) Does the plurality with elimination method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition?
When using plurality with elimination method you count the first place votes, and if someone has majority then they win. If not, the candidate with the fewest first place votes is eliminated. This is continued until a candidate has majority vote. Because of this, like the normal plurality method, if one candidate is preferred over another candidate by every voter, it would be impossible for that less preferred candidate to win.

4) Does the pair-wise voting method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition? Explain.
In a pair-wise voting method each candidate is paired head-to-head with every other candidate. 1 point is received for a win and ½ point is received for a tie. The points are added up and the candidate with the most points wins. Again, as with the other three voting methods questioned, there is no possible way that a candidate who is less preferred by every voter than another candidate could win against a more preferred candidate. The more preferred candidate would at least have to receive more points than the less preferred one.

*TL:DR* All four methods satisfy the Pareto Condition.

I was wondering if these answers could be reviewed for accuracy, and if they are incorrect, if someone could direct me in making a preference schedule that would violate the condition. Thanks to everyone in advance."	t5_2rbfw	True

**EDIT** I TeXed it up for you.

Let A be a 2x2 matrix (not necessarily diagonalizable) and define

`[;\begin{bmatrix} x_n\\ y_n\\ \end{bmatrix} =A^n \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};]`

Assume `[;\lim_{n\to \infty}(\frac{x_n}{y_n})=1;]`

Show that `\begin{bmatrix} 1\ \ 1\ \ \end{bmatrix}` is an eigenvector of A.

Hint: explain why we can find `[;c_1,  c_2,  c_3,  c_4;]` with

`[;A\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix}=c_1\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix}+c_2\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};   A\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix}=c_3\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix}+c_4\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};]`

What do you need to show about `[;c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4;]` so that `[;\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix};]` is an eigenvector of A?

Now compute `[;A^n \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};] and compare with [;A^{n+1} \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix}=A(A^n \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix});]`

I started with the hint. I suppose that for the part of the hint, the reason why we can find values for c_i is that, for instance, 

    c_1[1] c_2[1]
       [1]    [2]

Is the same as 

    [1 1][c_1]
    [1 2][c_2]

And since that matrix is invertible there must be a solution. 

So from there, it seems that I need to show c_2=0. 

But I have no real clue how to do that. I would be eternally grateful if someone could shed some light on this for me.

The only strategy of proof I can imagine is to assume that a = m/n and evaluate cos(n pi a) and try for a contradiction.  However, doing this and applying the binomial theorem gives us an expression of the form

1/3^n sum(k=0 to n) (n choose k) (1+2 sqrt(2) i)^k.

We can work with either the complex or the real part of this expression; the complex part must be zero and the real part must be +/- 1, depending on the parity of m.

If we work with the real part, we find that we have an expression of the form 1-8(n choose 2)+64(n choose 4)-512(n choose 6)... which we must show is not equal to +/- 3^n.

1315953482.0	kepg6	Poker Probability Question	iasksillyquestions	4	0	2	"I'm trying to understand the probability of getting poker hands. Specifically the hands full house and two pair. I'll use C(n,k) for binomial coefficient. 

Wikipedia says the number of ways to get a full house is C(13,1)*C(4,3)*C(12,1)*C(4,2) which I understand as picking your first card and then picking the 3 suits that card will take, then picking the second card and picking the two suits that card will take. 

That makes sense to me. 

Now, the problem is when I look at the number of ways you could draw two pair. C(13,2)*C(4,2)*C(4,2)*C(44,1) which I understand as you pick your first two cards with C(13,2) then pick the suits of those two cards C(4,2) and C(4,2) then you finally pick the last card which can't be on of the first cards you picked. This also makes sense to me, but it conflicts with my mental picture of how you get the full house. 

Why is it when you pick the two cards for a full house is it C(13,1)*C(12,1) instead of C(13,2) like it is in the two pair hand. I don't understand how this is working at all, and It'd be great if someone could help me.

1315535044.0	k9keu	Markov chains help. (xposts)	MyNameCouldntBeAsLon	5	0	0	"I posted this in r/math, and although this isn't my homework, i got downvoted without reasoning (as of this posting), so I thought I would get better luck here:


I would like to build a Markov Chain with the following characteristics:

P(x(t)=1)=1-p, P(x(t)=0)=p, which in every state t is just a Bernoulli (a success, try again distribution), as you go 'forward' in time (t+1,t+2, ...), the probabilities are adjusted as follows P(x(t+1)=1)=p^2 , P(x(t+1)=0)=(1-p^2 ).

I am currently reading ""A Markov-Binomial Distribution"" by Omey, Santos and van Gulck (2008), and I have a pretty clear idea of the 'behavior' of a chain with these characteristics of the chain I am triying to build. A basic computational approach of the previously stated probabilities shows that at t=6, P(x=1)~1, so this should be a very fairly small chain, with desirable characteristics. Whether the probabilities do not match the convention [P(x(t)=1)=1-p instead of the usual P(x(t)=1)=p], is currently irrelevant, I want the success to be marked when x=1, and the probability of that outcome being ""forced"" by (1-p^2 ).

Ozekici (1997) ""Markov Modulated Bernoulli Process"" discusses a Bernoulli process with ""adaptative"" probabilities, that followMarkov chain's formulations. I am pretty sure this is the equivalent of what I'm looking for. Also, would a 'success' trial in any state 'reset' the probabilities to their original setting ((p,1-p) instead of (p^n , 1 - p^n )?
