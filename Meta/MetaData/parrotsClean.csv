She used to poo everywhere, but she has figured out the purpose of the bathroom and now waits until I go in there with her on my shoulder before sticking her bum out and squeezing one out onto the floor. I've not made any effort to train her to do this, she just decided to start doing it.

I got a call yesterday around 5:45 PM while cooking dinner and my wife was working on her laptop and someone asked ""Are you the one who lost the bird?""  

Basically the guy told me he was outside about to start his his leaf blower and Alex landed on his shoulder.  SO he walked into his garage with ALex and then put him in a pet carrier while he went notfiy his wife.  SHe said "" I saw flyers for a missing bird on the stop at the end of the street""  so they called us!  

Feels good to have the effort we put into making, printing , and hanging flyers pay off! And registering on all the online parrot lost and founds as well.  And best of all, my wife wont be crying anymore over her lost baby!!

I knew the chances were slim, but we got our bird back and thats what counts, we are totally relieved!"	t5_2qhyf	True

1363718832.0	1alxio	Greetings, r/parrots! I'm a new mod and I'm planning on giving this place a facelift. Mission 1 = flair!	tehfinch	76	2	135	"I'm trying to get user-chosen flair setup in this subreddit. I think it would be a nice and fun way for people to display their flock beside their usernames. First, I have to draw a bunch of birds in Photoshop (photos don't scale down very well). I plan on doing the following:

-sun conure**

-green check conure**

-african gray**

-amazon

-eclectus (male and female)**

-budgie, probably green and blue variants**

-cockatiel**

-sulfur-crested cockatoo**

-white cockatoo (probably applicable to goffin's, umbrella, etc. remember, the image won't be any larger than 30 px max).

-scarlet macaw**

-indian ringneck**

If anyone has any other birds they'd like to see added to this list, please let me know in the comments. Also, if anyone has any good profile pics of the birds listed, feel free to post them. I might use some as the basis for a sketch.

That's all for now, folks!

EDIT: sample [sun conure] (http://i.imgur.com/HJ5DKi4) and [IRN] (http://i.imgur.com/9c203h2.png) so you can see what I mean.

**EDIT #2** The new additions to the list:

-lovebird (peach and fischer's)

-parrotlet**

-caique (white belly and black cap)**

-hahn's macaw**

-meyer's parrot

-senegal**

-pineapple gcc**

-pionus (blue head and white cap)**

-galah**

-gold cap conure

-DYH amazon

**EDIT #3: [This](http://imgur.com/a/YZcjb) is what I've done so far.**
 
-B&amp;G Macaw/Major Mitchell/white-faced cockatiel** also added to my to-do list. This was far more popular than expected! I'm off to bed, will work on these during the remainder of the week. 


**means that it's done. I may/may not have also posted it somewhere in the thread. 

**EDIT#4 [It's alive!] (http://i.imgur.com/p0ScspC.png) Go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/1ar4xj/mission_1_mostly_successful/) for comments, questions, and complaints.** "	t5_2qhyf	True
