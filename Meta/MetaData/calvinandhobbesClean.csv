    This film is not a quest to find Bill Watterson, or to invade his privacy.
    It is an exploration to discover why his 'simple' comic strip made such
    an impact on so many readers in the 80s and 90s, and why it still means
    so much to us today.

The film interviews those involved in the world of comics, those who know Bill Watterson, and avid fans. The initial kickstarter campaign was made and funded in 2009. In order to get the final funds needed to create this DVD, they've started another kickstarter fund for those that didn't get a chance to donate last time, but would like to be a part of a special documentary about Bill Watterson/Calvin &amp; Hobbes. If you'd like to donate, [go check it the kickstarter!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fingerprintfilms/dear-mr-watterson-a-calvin-and-hobbes-documentary)

BTW, I'm in no way involved in this project (other than having donated to the initial kickstarter), just so you guys don't think I'm spamming. Just a C&amp;H lover who wanted to spread the news of something new &amp; exciting!"	t5_2qtxs	True

1338482400.0	ue2un	Am I the only one who's actually glad Calvin &amp; Hobbes ended when it did?	MelancholySpork12	249	46	56	"I can think of so many cherished objects from my childhood that have been completely ruined when they overstay their welcome. For instance, Arthur was my favorite PBS show. I caught one of the newest episodes the other day, and it was about Arthur buying his first cell phone. WTF happened? A lot of other obvious names spring to mind, like Star Wars, Scooby Doo (remember the live-action movie?), Garfield, .etc. Because of their mainstream success, the creators had to keep coming up with ways to make the source material compelling, and it doesn't take long for them to forget what made the original idea so endearing.

Bill Watterson is one of those rare geniuses who sticks exactly to his creative vision, monetary gain be damned. When the strip was starting to run out of material, he recognized it and bowed out with dignity. No coffee mugs, no new characters, no live-action movie adaptation. He wanted people to remember his work when it was still fresh, and full of life. Other comic strips like Dilbert, Garfield, and god knows how many others keep grinding out comics that are all pretty much the same joke with a new coat of paint. I don't even read the funnies anymore. 

But Calvin &amp; Hobbes will never be like that. I will always remember it exactly as it was, and that's something of a relief in this day and age.

1342637661.0	wruzy	Remember the calvinball sticker? I flew one to 88,000 ft today.	WalterFStarbuck	171	28	21	"I'm a graduate student in engineering and helping with a summer camp for kids interested in science. They've been building experiment boxes and they launched them on a weather balloon today. 

I recently bought a bunch of the [Calvinball stickers](http://www.redbubble.com/people/thisisjoew/works/7191502-calvinball?p=sticker) that I think I found here. As they sat waiting to launch, I asked how many of them had read calvin and hobbes. There were 12 kids there and every single hand went up. I asked them if someone would be willing to put the sticker on their box and I clearly didn't have to ask twice. 

[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/A6TjF#aIGiR)

The balloon flew to an altitude of over 88,000 ft before it burst and the payloads floated down under a parachute and into a rural cornfield where we soon recovered it. Most of the payloads included cameras set to a timer to take pictures every minute throughout the flight. When they get their data, I'll get to see if they got good pictures.

I was so happy that young kids (high school age) are still enjoying C&amp;H. I was afraid I'd have to explain what it meant. But of course, everyone knows calvinball."	t5_2qtxs	True
