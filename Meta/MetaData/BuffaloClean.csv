1374189244.0	1ilex5	I am Sergio Rodriguez, and I am running for Mayor of Buffalo. AMA.	SergioForMayor	227	28	183	"Hello, 

My name is Sergio Rodriguez, and I am running for Mayor of Buffalo this coming November. I am very excited to have this chance to reach out to Buffalo redditors. 

You can find out more about me and my platform on www.sergioformayor.com.
I will be answering questions live on Friday, July 19th 2013 at 5PM eastern. See you then!

EDIT: That's all the time I have right now. I am heading over to the 44th annual Grease Pole Fest. I will try to answer the questions I did not get a chance to answer today, in the near future. 

Please feel free to visit my facebook page :https://www.facebook.com/SergioforMayor or my website www.sergioformayor.com. 

I will continue to check this thread and answer as many questions as possible during the following week. 

Thank you /r/Buffalo for your time and great questions! 

Take care!"	t5_2qi6i	True

So as per the previous discussion, we are meeting today starting 5:45 at Bidwell Park. 

Address: 56 Bidwell Pkwy Buffalo‎ New York‎ 14222

[Google Map Link](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=56+Bidwell+Pkwy+Buffalo%E2%80%8E+New+York%E2%80%8E+14222&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=52.68309,83.408203&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=56+Bidwell+Pkwy,+Buffalo,+New+York+14222&amp;z=16&amp;layer=t)

What we have so far: 

Grill and and Soda (or Pop) - sunnydelish

[Homebrews and Hookah](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/v8ft8/yo_are_we_meeting_on_625_or_what/c52phvl)

[Kan Jam](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/v8ft8/yo_are_we_meeting_on_625_or_what/c541brg)

I know someone had mentioned cupcakes. 

Everyone is welcome to bring stuff to eat, or just themselves and their appetites. I know some redditors were going to bring their canine companions, so that's cool too. 

After the meetup we can break out into groups - those that want to go to hoyt lake, those that want to go for coffee, and those that might want to hit up the bars. (Disclaimer : do not drink and drive).

Hopefully this would be a great way to meet fellow redditors - and who knows, maybe make some new friends. 

So come one, and come all !!!

PS Upvote this so everyone else can see. Self post, so no karma for me.

Last year it seemed a bunch of people really liked Bidwell, so maybe have a regular thing there, like the first Monday of the month, or more often, whatever.

I'd also like to get a few going in other parts of WNY, Isle View, Squaw Island, South Buffalo, Chestnut Ridge.

Also various activities, biking kayaking, sports, boardgames, etc I'd like to set up monthly things at least. I think I'll have a day during the week and do an evening paddle, and also a few 'Urban Hikes' mostly near Grain Elevators and stuff.

If you have something you are interested in make it happen. Us Mods will help facilitate it with stickies and a possible calender, but it's up to you guys to help.

Not sure what we can sue to help organize, meetups.com, or facebook? Google calender? What do you guys think?

A Line to connect the airport and downtown should be a no brainer. A stop at the Galleria Mall could be a conduit to lure Canadian shoppers downtown. [Not to mention 30% of the traffic of Buffalo-Niagara comes from Canadians.](http://www.centreforaviation.com/analysis/us-border-low-cost-airport-attracts-canadian-passengers-8564) 

There is also a line connecting UB South with North.

A line connecting the Tonawandas with an extension to Niagara Falls. 

And a line going South to the Ralph and the Fair Grounds.

Is there a market for all of this? [Apparently Buffalo has the 19th most popular light rail line in the US.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_light_rail_systems_by_ridership)

Even though half of downtown is a parking lot, I think traffic and the price of parking would be more than motivation for a successful park and ride system; which has already proven to work.

##please upvote for visibility

Sergio Rodriguez  is a Mayoral Candidate for City of Buffalo. I got to meet and talk to him for a bit, and I think he is has a very good idea of what should be done in Buffalo moving forward. He is running on the Republican Ticket, but he is not your typical republican – being very socially progressive. 

He has agreed to do an AMA with the Buffalo Subreddit, because he wants to know what our generation wants, and that is something we need in our local leaders. This thread is to collect questions for his AMA, and setting up a time for it. 

Please sound off with your questions below. I think the AMA will probably take place on a thurday or Friday evening, but lets get our questions ready. Of course, redditors are welcome to drop questions during the AMA. 

Sergio’s website is here : www.sergioformayor.com.  Please look through it to know about his platform. We all complain how things in Buffalo don’t work, or how you think certain thinks could be made better – what better way to get into the ear of a person who might be Mayor come November 5th.

Tuesdays in Artpark are amazingly strong this year with some huge classic rock acts. Also a few good Wednesday shows there too. Thursday in Buffalo is better than last year. Lockport looks good as well. Some have the venue denoted if it's on an off day or when TITS switches to the harbor in the second half of the year. I also included some paid shows that will be at Artpark and the harbor. 

I'll be at most of the Lockport shows because I live close. If you haven't been there, it's an awesome time. The venue is great, good sound, lots of facilities, and places to buy cheap $3 beers, and easy free parking. The people and security are all friendly. I'll be at every free Artpark show I can make it to.

I have a suggestion, why don't we all meet up at Spot on elmwood around 6:00ish, and then the grown ups can make their way over to any of the bars closeby (Blue Monk, Cecilias, etc etc)

Let me know what you all think. I am okay with whatever after 5:00 pm as I have to work before that.

I came back here to focus on my education, and now that I'm nearing the end of a terminal degree, it's becoming very clear to me that I need to leave the area to have any hope of a successful career. 

I'm excited and disappointed by this at the same time. It's really easy to live here, the people are generally great, and it's inexpensive. On the other hand, there is just absolutely nowhere for me to grow professionally here, and that's disheartening.

My whole life I've been listening to people either talk about our legendary past, or our predicted epic future, but it seems that few want to admit that we don't have a lot going for us here in the present. As I get older, I get increasingly frustrated hearing about waterfront development, how next year is ""our year"", and the usual chatter (art museums, Delaware Park, etc). I'm not hating on Buffalo or Buffalonians as I am one and I love my city, but I guess I don't understand the general thought process here. Why as a community do we keep this fighting/resilient mentality when things are plain and simple just not working, and haven't been for decades? Sure, there are some nice, gentrified areas and pockets of culture here and there, but overall it seems like everything is a struggle. "	t5_2qi6i	True

Myself and 9 friends had a VIP table at the Paul Oakenfold show at Rendezvous the Niteclub last night.  Paul, the VIP setup, pretty much every thing was amazing.  We had a great time, up until it came time to pay our tab.

In order to secure the VIP table we put down a $500 deposit.  Any drinks or bottle service would be deducted from that and we'd be charged again for anything over $500 at the end of the night.  When our server brought us our tab at the end of the night she explained that we had only spent $348 of our $500 deposit and suggested we get another bottle.  Not wanting to throw away money, that is exactly what we did.

We get a $130 bottle of champagne and enjoy it.  The server then comes back with a receipt for $615.  She apologizes and explains that the computer screwed up and one of our previous bottles was not on the first bill.  We politely refused pay the extra $115 as we had been conned into spending it.  She goes to get her manager.

The manager refused to correct their mistake.  His line was you drank it, you pay for it.  Normally I agree with this mentality, but they were in error.  He was quite hostile during this whole encounter as well.  This ended with the cops showing up and basically telling us to pay, or spend the night in jail.  We didn't think $115 was worth sitting in a cell all night.

We will not be going back to Rendezvous, even though we had a great time.

tl;dr; Rendezvous doesn't fix their mistakes and bring in the police when paying customers refuse to pay for the club's errors."	t5_2qi6i	True

Today he remembered my name and where I lived, even though the first ride was three weeks ago. ""Did you leave Buffalo for some time? Ha ha! Welcome back! Are you going to Chippewa this week? I will drive!""

He's a friendly, interesting guy trying to make his own way. He quit Liberty Cab a few days ago to drive solo, and he's saving up to replace his Taurus with a van, so he could probably use a little publicity. Do yourself and your bag of thawing freezer pizzas a favor and call this guy up next time you need a cab in Buffalo. He says he'll make trips downtown, to the Galleria and airport, and even up to Niagara Falls. His card says he'll go to Canada but I dare you to take a taxi across an international border and back.


His card reads:

**TAXI SERVICE BY SINGH**

**Available 24 hours, on-time service, offering special discounts for students**

**Serving Buffalo, Niagara Falls, &amp; Canada**

**G. Singh (716) 913-6563**

Although we had to spend Saturday morning at her office, we spent the rest of the afternoon bumming around the *Allen neighborhood*. Per your recommendations, we stopped by *Gabriel's Gate* for a late lunch (wings!) and ate an even later dinner at the *Blue Monk* on Saturday night. It was really good. 

Sunday we went to *Betty's* (we forgot it was Mother's Day, but we were able to sit at the bar almost immediately) and my lush of a girlfriend proudly proclaims that the Betty's blood mary is the best she's ever had. We drove to Niag**A**ra for the afternoon, and walked around the park on the American side. We grabbed a cup of coffee, then went at saw Wicked over at *Shea's* at 6:30. 

We really wanted to go to *Amy's Place*, since so many of you recommended it, but it was closed by the time we made it over there, so we went to the *Thirsty Buffalo* and had another round of good (and hot!) wings. We'll make it over to Amy's Place and Anchor Bar and Orchard Park when I come out again, after the election.

Thanks again for all your recs-- we were really happy with all of them. Here's a [photo of us playing at Niagara Falls](http://imgur.com/5rKHI)

http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/i4uss/reminder_rbuffalo_part_of_global_reddit_meetup/

-----

Hueypriest, the pope of Reddit, announced [Global reddit meetup 2011 will be on Saturday, June 25th](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/h1p8c/circle_the_calendarsglobal_reddit_meetup_2011/) (Arbitrary Day) over in r/Meetup a few days ago.  

I have not been as active in Reddit this week as normal.  And I recently was made a mod at r/Worldnews.... so, that's eating a lot of my time as well.   

So, I'm still making up for lost threads and what not these past few days. 

But I was thinking that we should do a local Buffalo/WNY Meetup.... And since it's on a Saturday, maybe we should get out in the open air somewhere.  

So, toward that end..... where do we want to do this at?  I was thinking we could get together at a local Park like Delaware Park or Beaver Island and picnic, drink pop and/or beer, cook some hot dogs, maybe play a little football or something, etc.  

And some of us could bring some cameras and take photos and upload them so other Redditors can see what we  all look like, and some highlights of the fun time we had. 

Back in the day, I was involved in BBSing in WNY, and we used to do a lot of picnics.   Normally they were pretty fun.  

But that's just my idea.... perhaps others with have a better one.  

If you have an idea, this is a call for you to put it out there.  

Thanks,

-dnr666

I found this little girl running around in the middle of Amherst St last week, no collar or tags and she's about 12 weeks old. I've called the shelters and animal control and no one has been looking for her, so we have been giving her a temporary home. Unfortunately, we are both too busy to give her the attention a puppy deserves.  

She is insanely smart. Seriously. In one week, she already knows basic commands, is great on walks down Elmwood Ave, she is now housebroken and crate trained and she gets along well with other animals. I have taught her to sit when being approached by people on the street and to sit and wait at intersections until given the ""let's go!"" command. She is also learning to ring a bell when she needs to go outside. I work with dogs but the owners won't allow us to bring our own dogs to our facility. 

She is a really fantastic dog, a big lover and great cuddler and she plays nicely with my yorkie. We've been calling her Tesla, or Tess for short. Highly intelligent dogs do require a lot of energy, but are well worth the effort. I would love to keep her myself but I have been overruled on this by my roommates and it is true that we really just don't have time right now. 

Tess will go to her new home with food, a crate, collar and leash, lots of treats, bones and toys. Please PM me with any questions you may have! Thanks so much!

If you grew up in the Buffalo area, nothing comes close; it's like manna from the heavens. If you're not a native, odds are your opinion of Buffalo-style pizza ranges from ambivalence to hatred.  Those from downstate are outspoken critics of Buffalo-style; consider that Zetti's locations are near UB and Buff State, where there's a potential customer base of tens of thousands of Lawn Guylanders.

Whenever I've taken out-of-town guests to decent local pizzerias -- La Hacienda, Casa di Pizza, etc, they always left unimpressed, if not a bit disgusted.  Their thoughts: bland, sweet, and not a fan of the grease that pools up in the Margherita pepperoni.  Consider that efforts to export Buffalo-style pizza have largely failed.  Buffalo-style is nonexistent in Rochester, Syracuse, Ithaca, and even just across the border in Fort Erie.  

Outside of the rare Buffalo-based chain or transplant baking up Buffalo-stye to homesick expats in the Charlotte or Sarasota areas, you can't find anything like the pizza back home anywhere else in the country.  I personally know of one transplant from Tonawanda that started a Buffalo-style pizzeria in suburban Austin.  The reviews were awful.  He ditched the Buffalo-style, started serving up Midwestern chain-style pizza, and business took off.

Although, Buffalo lacks in this department of good establishments with amazing outdoor patios with a good share of shade and sun to accommodate patrons and allow people relax with friends and enjoy at tasty beverage.   

The top 3 listed in the article are good. There are few many more:  

* Blue Monk's beer garden is pleasant, but it often is overrun with snobs.  
* Swannie house is a great borderline first ward bar and has an airy patio.  
* Doug's Dive at the small boat harbor is a good escape, although often crowded in the height of summer.  
* Liberty hound is a great river side spot, the 'pier' can quickly become crowded, but they do have great beers.  
* Nobody can beat a baseball game and few drinks in the stands, let alone playing some cards in the outfield bar.  
* a big secret is del denby's where they have a huge yard in the back, good for pitcher's of blue.  
* Pearl Street's back deck patio is nice on sunny days.  
* Templeton's can be nice, yet a bit pricey.  
* Rumor has it, that the Parkside lodge will have a new owner to the cafe in the lodge and may be acquiring a liquor license to sell beer to golfers.  
* has rendezvous reopened? they have one of the most comfortable garden patios in the city.  
* Mother's is great.  
* DBGB's has a cozy patio.  
* Gabriel's Gate's patio is better suited for dining, and lounging.  
* Miss Buffalo Friday happy hour cruise is always a great time (when she's put to ""sea"").  
* may have forgotten a few other spots around the city, fill them in...

I'm not a huge fan of street side patios, though, they can be good for people watching, therefore there are cecilia's, bullfeathers, essex, blue monk, goodbar, cole's, gecko's, shadow, 

For those who like to getaway from the city from time to time, there are a fair share of beach bars along the lake, one favorable spot is ZeBro's in Barcelona, NY.  

Or if you're an angst under legal drinking age downvoter, you can get somebody to buy your liquor or steal it from your family and go to some obscure location, or any park.

For those not familiar with the new law, [read this](http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/buffalo/article723898.ece). Now, I don't blame the cops (although they were certainly being bigger dicks than their jobs required)-If the Common Council passes shitty laws, it is the officers' duty to enforce them. 

Here's the kicker: Two bouncers from two different bars were telling the officers it was okay for the truck to stay. These bouncers then proceeded to tell the officers that none of the surrounding bars served food at this time (it was around 1:00am) so there were no issues with competition or ""stealing"" customers.

1333933566.0	s01gh	NEW: Edit your own User Flair!	leaveluck2heaven	24	0	15	"I've been meaning to do this for a while, but I finally got around to it! You can now edit your own flair to show up next to your name. It's text only but it can say whatever you want! (Within reason, if I see someone with inappropriate flair I'm going to remove it.) It'll show up to the right of your name the way mine does.

Some suggestions, if you're not sure what you want for your flair: why not choose a favorite building (central terminal, city hall) or the neighborhood you live in (elmwood village, first ward, etc)?

For visibility, please upvote this self post, for which I receive no karma. And enjoy your flair!"	t5_2qi6i	True

Just to clear it up  Paula did want to stay at the current location, but actually expand the store, which is another reason in itself, it is very cramped in there. Everyone barely has room to turn around during the work day. Also only one fryer, so the Clarence store actually has to supply a lot of the donuts during the day.

Also, the plaza was sold, and Paula tried her hardest to find a way to stay, but eventually is being FORCED out. So either way the store has to move. 

The new store is coming along well and is much larger. We hope that people will understand. It's just something that was needed."	t5_2qi6i	True
1372144101.0	1h0wls	Hello Buffalonians, join Restore The Fourth on July 4th to protest the NSA and their breaching of the Constitution!	killawhallle	29	9	22	"http://www.facebook.com/events/267874656686223/

http://www.restorethefourth.net/

This is our official press release on June 18, 2013 —

Restore the Fourth is a grassroots, non-partisan, non-violent movement that seeks to organize and assemble nationwide protests on July 4th, 2013. Protesters in over 100 cities across America will gather to demand that the government of the United States of America adhere to its constitutionally dictated limits and respect the Fourth Amendment. http://www.RestoretheFourth.net provides a detailed list of protest locations.

Restore the Fourth maintains that justification of the Fourth Amendment beyond the original text need not be given; the legitimacy of which is self-evident. ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."" The Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights clearly protects all citizens’ assets, both digital and physical, against searches and seizures without warrant; they aim to assert those rights. They insist that the proper channels of government work to ensure that all policy complies with the supreme laws of the United States of America in their entirety.

Restore the Fourth requests that American citizens’ right to privacy is respected and stands with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and StopWatching.us on their open letter to Congress. As informed members of the American electorate, they endorse and echo the letter’s demands.

1. Enact reform this Congress to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the state secrets privilege, and the FISA Amendments Act to make clear that blanket surveillance of the Internet activity and phone records of any person residing in the U.S. is prohibited by law and that violations can be reviewed in adversarial proceedings before a public court;

2. Create a special committee to investigate, report, and reveal to the public the extent of
this domestic spying. This committee should create specific recommendations for legal
and regulatory reform to end unconstitutional surveillance;

3. Hold accountable those public officials who are found to be responsible for this
unconstitutional surveillance.

The July 4th demonstrations seek to demand an end to the unconstitutional surveillance methods employed by the U.S. government and to ensure that all future government surveillance is constitutional, limited, and clearly defined.

Restore the Fourth aims to ensure that the will of the people is reflected in the government of the United States of America. This movement intends to bring an end to twelve years of Fourth Amendment abuses, and demonstrate the need for a return to the Constitution. All Americans should stand with them in this cause to protect the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution."	t5_2qi6i	True

Got to the park about 11 AM and AdmiralNorman was already setting up his stuff.  I guess he beat me there by 15 minutes.  But he did claim the one picnic table in the area.  

I thought I would get a thread up while I am still somewhat awake.  

I took some photo's myself.  I know others did as well.  Please post links to them in this thread.   Then they will all be in one place.

Anyway, we then broke up out of the picnic part around 1 PM if I remember correctly.   Some of us then went down to the BlueMonk for some beers and munchies.  I know there are others with photos from that part.  And then a few more of us went to Wegmans for dinner. 

The rest of them were then planning to go bar hopping I believe.  But i kind of bailed then around 6:15 PM.  As I am too old to bar hopping now. 

Thanks.  It was a good time.  "	t5_2qi6i	True

1305769060.0	heoo0	r/Buffalo do for a Global Reddit Meetup Day on Saturday, June 25th @ 11 AM Buffalo Time -- looks like Delaware Park has the votes. 	davidreiss666	26	5	31	"[Original Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/h3mnj/what_should_rbuffalo_do_for_a_global_reddit/).

[Original thread about Global meetup day](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/h1p8c/circle_the_calendarsglobal_reddit_meetup_2011/)

Since Delaware Park has the most upvotes, I am going to make an executive decision here that Delaware Park wins the battle.  (I would have preferred Beaver Island, but majority votes has to count for something.) 

So, now. I have not been to Delaware Park seriously in 10 years or more.   Where in the Park do we do this?  Is there somewhere near the Zoo that can still accommodate this?   Does anyone know if we can reserve a shelter or anything?  

I'm going to need help, so will somebody please step forward and help me out here.   Message me from my [userpage](http://www.reddit.com/user/davidreiss666/). 

It will need to be a BYOB event -- Bring You Own Beer, where beer means anything, including pop, chips, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, pizza or whatever it is you will want.    I'm sure people will be willing to share, but don't count on them having enough for you.  

If we need to, I'm pretty sure there is still a Wilson Farms on Parkside Ave, across from the Zoo.    I think there might be a Pizza place there too.  

Hope to see some discussion here and in messages about making this successful. 

Oh, and I just thought of this.... We're going to want to make up some signs.  With a Reddit Alien on them. 

Thank you,

It's one of the two locations that people seemed to like (The other was La Salle Park), and the mods here seemed to like the Riverfest Park location.  

I think maybe later in the summer we could try and have another meetup in the suburbs somewhere, like Beaver Island (on Grand Island) or Ellicott Creek Park (Tonawanda, but borders with Amherst). 

This is pretty much a Bring your own everything event.  So, if you have a portable grille, and folding chairs and stuff, please be kind and bring them.

1366901114.0	1d32i6	New Buffalo Stadium Idea, non waterfront, reuse project	sevenoneSICKs	24	5	81	"So with that ridiculous proposal of taking all the waterfront space and throwing a stadium down there with little to no plan on how people would even be able to get to and from, I wondered, why not use one of the more iconic (and impossible to do much with) landmarks as part of a new stadium?

So [this](http://i.imgur.com/iCn1K2k.jpg) is my idea. Please excuse the terrible photoshopping. [This](http://goo.gl/maps/FmGB0) is the Concrete Central area. Using the entire building as the western side of the stadium (ala Soldier Field in Chicago) there is more than enough space that is and has been completely vacant for some time. This land is wasted and dirt cheap, and also extremely close to downtown.

The yellow arrows you see are new and some existing roads that would need to either be built or upgraded. Green checkmarks are surface parking lots, and the red arrow is a spot for the training facilities.

I only used the Ralph as a size comparison to show roughly what we would be looking at as a footprint. I imagine a little bit smaller of a stadium when all is said and done.

As for displacement, there is one active rail line that runs through the site, but could easily be re routed all around there. Local businesses that would be affected are nothing with any major ties there. The propane/liquid nitrogen place (formerly airco) and the tractor trailer training school are the only ones that have been fixtures for quite some time.

With this plan, running the metro rail right to the site would not be very costly and could also push expanding it into the south towns finally. Highway access is closeby from the 190 either Hamburg st or Smith st. Other routes could be easily brought in from Rt 5 as well.

There are a lot of flaws and infrastructure issues to be dealt with obviously as I am not an engineer or city planner by any means, but I really do see this as a very sensible, cost effective, smart plan. It brings the stadium into the city, it saves waterfront space to be used for something other than a few times a year, it re uses one of the most awesome structures in the area (in my opinion) and doesn't impose on hardly anything local. I really see zero downsides with this plan. 

If anyone is interested in helping me with some design work to make this a bit more presentable, I really would appreciate it. Once I have more costs/facts figured out, I do plan on sending this to whoever it needs to go to, just to at the very least, open up the idea.

My husband and I just moved into an apartment on the Elmwood strip , is this area known for flooding or anything? I don't really even know what to do if flooding happens.

    I proudly present:
 **The Summer Movie Explosion BBQ Spectacular!!!!**

Hello /r/Buffalo! I enjoyed meeting those of you who attended Global Reddit Meetup Day! At the park and at Spot I mentioned hosting a meetup in August. Details are as follows:

**Date:** ~~ August 13th, 2011~~ August 20th, 2011

**Rain Date:** August 20th, 2011

**Time:** 5:00PM - 11:00PM(ish)

**Movie start time:** 9:00PM(ish)

**Redditgifts link:** [Clicky clicky](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/summer-movie-explosion-bbq-spectacular/)

**Facebook Event:** [Clickity click](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=218910191485878&amp;view=wall&amp;notif_t=event_wall)

**Location:** ~~5413 Genesee St, Lancaster, New York, 14086~~ [19 Angela Lane, Cheektowaga, NY, 14225](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19+Angela+Lane+cheektowaga+ny&amp;gl=us&amp;z=16)

**Description:** There will be a bon fire and possibly fireworks (I have a few left over). I'll be grilling, but if you want you're own specialty meat, you're welcome to bring it. I'm turning the grill on at 6:00PM. Around sunset (8:22pm) we'll set up a bonfire. Its good for making s'mores and spider dogs. Around that time I'm going to project a movie on the back of the ~~garage~~ house drive-in movie style. Movie title TBD.

**What to Bring:**

- For the movie and bonfire; fold up lawn chairs and/or blankets

- Bring your own beverage (other than soda)

- A reusable cup for drinks

- A dish to share (dessert, salad, whatever)

- Specialty foods to accommodate allergies

- Bug Spray

- Outdoor games/activities

**Alcohol:** It is most certainly allowed (BYOB), and if you are under 21 you are still welcome to attend. But no drinking if you're under age, yadda yadda.

**I NEED HELP**: I have the setup covered. I'm providing the propane, hamburgers, and hot dogs. (there will be a tip jar by the grill. $2-$3 bucks would be appreciated, but by no means required) I could use some people to commit to bringing a few items. For each item you should have enough to cover everyone attending (#tbd):

- Soda Pop

- Chips and dip

- Plastic ware

- Paper Plates

**Contact:** If you want text message updates, send a text to **716.222.0669** stating that you're from Reddit and your name. I'm on Reddit every day, so you can always message me here as well. wordsarelouder is my roommate and is also available.

**R.S.V.P.:** Posting in reddit gifts is preferred. But you can also respond to this post, send me a message, or text me. Please please please RSVP in some way so I can plan for you.

**Car pooling:** wordsarelouder has started a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/jfdcb/meetup_who_needs_a_ride_to_the_summer_movie/) about carpooling for the event. Please post if transportation is an issue!

----

##Delaware Park, Saturday June 25th @ 11 AM, Amherst-Colvin side of Buffalo Zoo --  If it looks like a weird group of odd people from the Internet, it probably will be.  Come over and ask and talk to us!

* [HP's Original thread about Global meetup day](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/h1p8c/circle_the_calendarsglobal_reddit_meetup_2011/)

Delaware Park had the most upvotes, which is why it was decided to do it there.  I made that  executive decision a while back.  So, any complaints about that should be directed at me, and no one else.   The date was picked by reddit Admin and General Manager HueyPriest (AKA, the guy who is pretty much in charge now that Jedberg is gone.  Well, independent of the CN overlords above him.)   

Right now, I think we want to do this on the **[Amherst St-Colvin Blvd](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=amherst+and+colvin&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.938344,-78.854434&amp;spn=0.008703,0.01929&amp;sll=42.938438,-78.852503&amp;sspn=0.008703,0.01929&amp;z=16)** side of the Zoo!    I'm going to get there at 11 AM and claim some picnic tables and sit and read and stuff while I wait for YOU!  

**Yes, YOU!**

Nobody really messaged me volunteering much help.  So, this is going to be a pretty big ""I'm gonna Wing it"" come Saturday Morning.    If you want to help message me from my [userpage](http://www.reddit.com/user/davidreiss666/). 

It is a **BYOB event** -- Bring You Own Beer, where beer means anything, including pop, chips, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, pizza or whatever it is you will want.    **I'm sure people will be willing to share, but don't count on them having enough for you**.  

If we need to, I'm pretty sure there is still a Wilson Farms on Parkside Ave, across from the Zoo. (Other side from where we will be at.)   I think there might be a Pizza place there too.   There is some stuff on Colvin, but I think it's mostly dead until you get down to Hertel (and then your in the middle of the Hertel area).  

We're going to want to make up some signs.  With a Reddit Alien on them.    I'm going to try and make some stuff up, but I don't know if I will have time.   So, if somebody wants to do them, please do so. 

Please comment here and lets try and have a good safe picnic experience.  And sorry, but I have no idea where I am going to be able to park or where you will be able too either.  Like I said, I am winging it.   Maybe one of us knows some info and they will comment to us all here.

My fiancee and I are considering a move from Brooklyn to your city, motivated by the lower cost of living, being over nyc, and family considerations (she is originally from the area), and I'd like your thoughts. Where is a nice area to move to? How about bars, restaurants, cultural stuff? I know the economy isn't the best, but I've heard rumblings that parts of the city are on the way up - any truth to this?

Also, I noticed a few posts on here about developer meetups. I'm a developer (PHP/Python web stuff mainly), and another important part of the deal is being able to find work. So Buffalo devs, what is the job landscape like? Are there jobs, and if so, what is compensation like?

Really anything you guys can tell me would be great. I'm doing my own research and we'll be visiting to poke around, but I regard the opinions of other redditors pretty highly, so I'd like to hear what you think.

I was carrying equipment in from my car so my hands weren't free to try and take a picture, and the object was moving pretty fast through the sky.  My only imaginative guess is that it could've been a meteorite?

Humboldt Parkway is undergoing a $1.2 million makeover, which is part of a larger plan for its surrounding East Side neighborhood.

Both sides of a 2.5-mile stretch of the parkway, from East Delavan Avenue to Northampton Street, will be resurfaced. The west side of the parkway from East Delavan to Main Street will also be resurfaced.

Bike lanes will be added, as will wheelchair-accessible ramps and traffic signal upgrades.

Now this recording was from 1978, and since I was bored I decided to do a little late-night internet sleuthing to see if it was still around.  

Assuming that it is the same restaurant, I very quickly found that Mother's is a bit of a local Buffalo institution but unfortunately I also found that Mr. Chandler died in 1992 from colon cancer.

So with that in mind I just wanted to place this clip here.  I figure that you locals just might appreciate this little piece of Buffalo history preserved in a Tonight Show clip, in addition to remembering this giant, kind man.

1370885041.0	1g218j	What can you tell me about West Buffalo?	Jews-R-Us	17	1	41	Hi all!  I am going to be moving to Buffalo from Philadelphia soon to start a PhD program at UB and am currently wading through the quagmire of craigslist apartment postings trying to find housing.  Apartments that are directly in both Allentown and Elmwood Village, on the whole, have higher rent than I would like to pay.  However, it seems like there are some really good deals to be had west of Richmond which, it seems to me, is in very do-able walking distance from these more desirable neighborhoods.  I looked at the FAQ and there isn't a lot of info about West Buffalo.  Is it a good place to live? Based on crime reports I've looked at, it doesn't seem that unsafe, but, from my experience in Philadelphia, I know that rent is usually low for a reason.  Many thanks!	t5_2qi6i	True

I live on the South Buffalo/West Seneca border so the fields are right behind people's homes and they aren't too fond of us. It wasn't a big deal when we were younger but now that we're all in our late teens/early twenties they don't take too kindly to us yelling and shooting BB's everywhere and have called the cops on a few occasions. I'm not looking for an official place to play just a wooded area where we can dick around and act like children for a few hours. Any suggestions?	t5_2qi6i	True

I'm asking $0 for them, only that you come pick them up by the end of Saturday.  After Saturday, I'm putting them out at the road, where the weather and bugs are.

[Couch](http://i.imgur.com/m4Keq.jpg) - sorry for the bad lighting.  This light brown couch was $300 brand new, and it's still in good condition. The only pitfall is that a fat guy(me D= ) sat on this couch for 2 years and the cushions ain't what they used to be.  Still usable I feel, just not new off the truck.

[Loveseat](http://i.imgur.com/pVXxn.jpg) - This flowery pile of crap was given to me by my crazy aunt.  She gave us a kitchen table and chairs too...but then she wanted them back.  She didn't take back the loveseat though.  This loveseat is terribly uncomfortable and sitting on it makes me sad.  I know what you're thinking, ""is that wood on the loveseat in this blurry photo obviously taken by a cell phone held by a sweaty guy?""  YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT'S WOOD!

Either way...I have some pop tarts for whoever picks it up.  I think I have some strawberry, blueberry, and at least one cinnamon left.  Or I have a few cans of warm mich ultra left.

May 19th 10am Canalside	jconsumer	16	1	15	"It's official, I will be organizing the First [/r/Buffalo](/r/Buffalo) Paddle Meetup on May 19th at 10am, at Canalside. We will meet at the Commercial Slip. I have a rack we store my boats at, they will be available for rental at a very discounted rate. Probably $10-15 for the afternoon. usually the rate is $30 for half a day. I probably only have 10 at the start of the season available, so not sure how you guys want to pick who gets them.  Hopefully some other folks have extras and we can find a boat for everyone.

This will be the first of many so if you can't make it or we can't find a boat we will be doing this often. As I mentioned before I work at [Buffalo Harbor Kayak](http://www.bfloharborkayak.com/), and do this all summer long, so there will be plenty of opportunity, as well as many other meet-up events.

**My only concern is allocating the boats, the first post it looked like a lot of people need boats but I won't have enough, but maybe a few others can help out too.**

So if you think you'd like to attend mention if you have boats (Kayaks or canoes) and any extras. It's still a month away so we can figure it out as we go.


About the Paddle: We will be going from the Commercial Slip down to the Grain Elevators, where I should be able to get us docked at Marine A and give us some time to tour the Grain Elevators and the Malt House. 

Depending on turnout afterwards we can meet at the Swannie House or have a picnic. So everyone even if not on the paddle can attend.

**Please give this upvotes so people see it, it's a self post so I'm not getting anything from it except more people to attend.**

1320422979.0	m0eop	Just a heads up. Never rent from The Kissling Interests.	somuchdeath18	18	2	22	"Here's the story.

My friend and I wanted a place in the city, preferably Allentown this past June. After searching and looking at places we decided upon an Apartment owned by the Kissling interests just one street away from Allen. We had read reviews that were not favorable about the company, but after looking at the apartment, we decided that a few bad reviews could just be from a few disgruntled people and rent from them anyways.

Over the summer construction and renovations began, how very convenient that this was not mentioned during our tour that they would begin a complete overhaul of building. Whatever, no big deal, we can deal with a little inconvenience. Then we heard rumors of eviction, and that apartments were to be renovated. After contacting the landlord we found out yes it was true, they are renovating apartments, but they have concessions in place to  help with tenant retention.... ok, we can deal with this too I guess.

Well... I just got out of that meeting. Apparently we their plan is to move us for 2 months minimum into an apartment free of rent (free just for two months, more than that we had to pay the standard rate while waiting for our place) and then moved back in. Upon moving back in we would sign a new one, two, or three year lease. Heres the catch, those renovations need to be paid for right? They busted out their excel sheet with pre-crunched numbers and our rent which was currently 975/month was getting just a little bump to 1475. Oh and that parking we pay 25/month per car? yeah that goes up to 50/month. Electric included in rent? nope, not any more. The director Rose, happily informed us that this 'slight' bump would take care of undesirable tenants (how many undesirable tenants pay a thousand dollars a month for a building which does not take advantage of government housing programs?).

Granted they did offer incentives to help 'ease in' to these new rates. 10% off for a 1 year contract would put us at 1237/month but that doesn't include the new parking costs or the newly added utility bill. I'm sure that the renovations would be very nice, but its a little ridiculous to assume that tenants who just signed a lease with you would willingly accept a 300$ increase in rent.

Please don't rent from them. If for purely fiscal reasons alone and not just those mentioned above, its almost a guarantee you will read this review and remember it when they try and get you to smile while being sodomized forcefully.

TL;DR In the city of good neighbors, Kissling Interests main interest is being the 1%. "	t5_2qi6i	True

[UPDATE] for anyone who cares to check in -

Spent the afternoon at Caffe Aroma with a good book. The coffee was fair and the noise-level suitable for reading. It was sweltering for a bit but they remedied that by opening all the large glass doors which let in a nice breeze.

The music was perfect - I recall hearing ""Quiz,"" a Polish future-jazz track by Skalpel. (I approve of any cafe that spins Ninja Tune artists.)

Took a walk from Bidwell Pkwy to Allentown and explored the Elmwood neighborhood.

Rust Belt was my favorite stop of the day.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions. It was nice to spend the day outside checking out my new town.

I met this girl online and we have known each other for almost a year now. She lives in USA and I live in Canada. We have decided to meet mid-way in your awesome city. Neither of us 
has been here before and I would really appreciate some local help.  

###About Us###

- We are in our 20's.
- We don't have a car.
- We'll be visiting late Feb.
- We'll be staying for about 4-5 days.
- We aren't rich. We are using some of our savings for this trip.
- Things we like: History, architecture, art, nature, food, walks.
- Things we are not into: **Neither of us drinks** or smokes and we don't care much for clubbing/partying either.

###Accommodation###

- Which neighborhood should we stay in? We are leaning towards downtown since we don't have a car, but I am reading mixed things about staying downtown. I've also heard good things about Amherst and other such neighborhoods. So, I'd like to get your opinion on this.
- Do you have any specific hotel recommendations? How does the Hyatt compare to the Holiday Inn? (We want a nice hotel experience, but all these hotels are so expensive!)
- Since we don't want to live in a dump and because all these hotels are a bit of a stretch for us, I was looking at Priceline/Hotwire. Has anyone tried them? Is this a bad idea?

###Transit###

- How reliable is the transit system? 
- How late can we stay out while relying on the transit?
- Is there some kind of week pass/day pass we should get?

###Things to do###

- Keeping in mind the things we like and the fact that we don't have a car, what places and activities would you recommend? We have a day reserved for Niagara Falls on the Canadian side.

 
 
###Food###

Like I mentioned, we are both foodies. The only caveat to this is that she is a vegetarian.

- What are some good places (not super expensive) to eat which have good options for vegetarians? 
- What's a good pasta place?
- What's a good Indian restaurant?
- What coffee/tea place would you recommend where we can just sit and chill for hours and have a nice conversation? Bonus points if it has a good dessert menu. :)

###Other questions###

- I am not a Canadian citizen but I have a multiple entry tourist visa for USA. She has a US passport. Is hopping between USA and Canada multiple times within the trip a problem?
- I'll take the bus and she is gonna reach Buffalo by plane. Is there a waiting area at the arrivals where I can receive her?

Any other suggestions to make this trip awesome and memorable would be great!

Sorry, I know that's a lot of questions! But your opinions will be really valuable.

Would people be interested in this?

How long should it be? 10 miles? 5? 2-3 hours?

General agenda? Start at a park, stop at a bar for a drink, stop for lunch? 

Theme? Olmsted parkways? Wing Runs? Food Trucks? Start at City hall and go whichever direction?

Days? How often? I'd love to have a weekly thing, even if only 3-5 people show up. Seriously I don't care if only 1 person shows.

PaeTar	17	4	56	"We are coming from Kitchener On, to visit for a couple days, and were wondering if there is anything must see while we are down here. We love good food, and cool food trucks, and beer. 

Friday night we are going to try a Bisons game. Do they sell out? 

Any tips would be handy!

We are staying in the downtown core.

Edit:
So far we walked to perry st and hit the brewpub for lunch after crossing the border. Picked up their growler and pint glass beer souvenir. That will be yum for later.

We then hit up the city hall observation deck. Besides being a giant middle finger in the sky, it was pretty darn cool. Lots of neat architecture in and out of the building' and in fact all of downtown is pretty majestic. 

Been taking tons of of building pictures. 

Prego wife is taking a power nap before Bisons game for pre-beers (for me).

Any editors going tonight? She might pass out early and I will want to go try some wonderful beers after.


edit 2:

Well turns out the game was a double header, that was cool. Afterwords we went for a walk and then got hungry. Turns out we only made it as far as Chippawa. Nonclub good food wasn't showing up much on yelp so we ended up in that giant multi story Irish bar. Food was Ok, beer selection was lackluster at best. Oh well, Waddles was tired and hungry so we had to make a quick judgement call. 

Sat we spent the morning we went and saw the Navel Park quickly, but it started pouring rain. Went doing some shopping then hit up Allentown Festival when it dried up a bit. 

WOW. Just Wow. Picked up some cool prints and pieces for the babies room (Space and Robot theme). 

Then  in the other Allen St festival we found Loyd's. HOLY SHITBALLS. soooooooo good. 

5 hours wandering there and swollen feet later, we were on the road and back across the bridge.

Thanks for hosting a wonderful quick visit. There is so much more we could have seen and spent time doing. We will definitely come back again!

How hard/expensive would it be to synchronize your traffic lights? Nothing is more annoying, not to mention causing wear and tear on your engine/brakes, then getting a green light on a major street and be able to move forward for a block than having to stop again, over and over and over again.

I just moved here from Pennsylvania and was hoping you guys could give me a little feedback! I am trying to find a vet for my awesome dog, pictured [here](http://i.imgur.com/KbZ82.jpg). I did a Google search and received 370+ search results. My dog is a 9.5 month old German shepherd. I am hoping someone here can recommend a vet. Our previous vet had been my family’s vet for 10+ years; I loved the way she conducted herself and her business. She was friendly yet completely honest. She also had experience with large dogs, and owned GSDs herself. I’m hoping to find these same traits in my new vet; especially one that has owned/experience with shepherds. Driving distance isn’t too much of an issue for me; I’m willing to drive for a superior vet experience. Thanks everyone- I am really enjoying Buffalo so far!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the suggestions! I'll be making lots of phone calls this weekend for sure. If you see my dog (Bismarck) or I out and about or at the dog park, feel free to say hello (he loves attention)! Everyone has been so helpful; thank you so, so much! "	t5_2qi6i	True

Why do you choose to live there, and what makes it so great? Make me want to become your awesome Redditor/neighbor! Here are a couple of considerations/questions:

1. I have never lived outside of the South. I spent some time in the Northeast in the summers and know my way around the areas and people. I have never experienced a Buffalo winter, but I know it will be cold... I get that... It's okay.

2. I have friends in the area so meeting people is not going to be a problem at first. I would still love to hear what you do for fun day to day, not just on special occasions. Is there a local hangout out you go to? Do friends come over? Do you drink yourself into oblivion?

3. I want to sell my wife's car and become a one car household. How practical is this? How safe is the transit really?

4. I hear all about the urban plight and housing glut and all of that stuff on the news. People keep saying Buffalo is like Detroit. I KNOW this isn't true but what is the real skinny on crime? Are there any neighborhoods you wouldn't even let your enemies go in to?

5. What is Downtown like? Is it empty on the weekends?

6. What is the art culture like outside of Elmwood? I know Buffalo was always known for it's art and architecture. Are those things still really alive?

I am sure there is a bunch of other stuff I would like to know but I can't think of it. If you think of something you want to share, go ahead and post it. Thanks in advance for your time and I look forward to hearing what you think.

I had to go into work at 6 am today, so at around 5:30 I was awake, watching TV in my living room when my doorbell rang. I put clothes on and answered and it was this girl (probably 18 or so), crying, and asked if she could use my phone. She came in the house and sat on my couch, clearly didn't get through to the number she tried to call (I tried later, it had been disconnected), thanked me and my wife (who had now also woken up) and got up to leave. I asked if she lived close or if she needed a ride, she kinda nodded no, kept saying thank you, was still crying and left. 

In hindsight I feel like I should've been more persistent or asked what was wrong. I'm sure she made it to whereever she was going safely, but I have no way to know, and it's kind of messing me up. If anyone happens to know a girl with a similar story (in the Amherst/Tonawanda area), I'd just like to know if she's ok.

So i survived my trip to Buffalo.  [Original Post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/h9dtz/buffalo_business_trip/) Some observations:

1. Everyone I met was very nice. Much friendlier than in Philadelphia, which is where I'm from. 

2. You can buy beer in gas stations here. And its half the price of take out beer where I live. Amazing.

3. I went to Duff's with a few other people. The Buffalo native who took us said it was the second best place next to the Anchor Bar ( I did not mention that I got the impression from you guys that Anchor bar was a bit overrated). The wings were good. They were no different than good wings I have had anywhere else though. I was a little disappointed because I expected something different. But they were good nonetheless.

4. Tim Horton's coffee was great, there was one near my hotel. Also I got to try a Ted's hotdog on my last day here. Very good.

They have Wegman's in PA and I have been to the falls a few times, so I skipped these. All in all, even though I barely left the airport, it was a good trip.

Thanks for all the advice and offers of help!

1373660978.0	1i6dt4	New craft brewery planned for downtown Buffalo	BBulaga75	13	3	7	"A group of entrepreneurs are planning to start a small-production craft brewery called the Big Ditch Brewing Co. on Ellicott Street in downtown Buffalo to make and sell its draft product to local bars, restaurants and retailers.

The trio behind the new company has selected the two-story former Verizon Communications facility at 337 Ellicott St. as the location for their new business.

It plans to start operations early next year and will be the first production brewery in more than 40 years to locate in downtown Buffalo. Unlike Pearl Street Grill &amp; Brewery not far away, it will not be a brewpub or restaurant.

The business will be operated mostly by Matt Kahn, 37, and Corey Catalano, 27, but the group also includes Wesley Froebel. Kahn and Catalano each have “extensive experience” in manufacturing, engineering, research and development and project management in the biotechnology and consumer products industries, which share similar practices with brewing.

“Biotech is very similar to making beer,” Kahn said. “It sounds kind of funny, but happens to be true. It’s a manufacturing operation, so we have plenty of experience to be able to run the brewery and to be able to make good beer.”

Froebel, 42, who is chief sales officer for Stereo Advantage, has also been an active shareholder and advisor for Flying Bison Brewing Co. for more than a decade.

The building, which is owned by Iskalo Development Corp., is located on a little less than three-quarters of an acre at the corner of East Huron and Ellicott streets. Plans call for the new business to occupy a portion of the first floor of the building that fronts on East Huron.

Besides selling the beer to eateries and retailers, Big Ditch also plans to include a tasting room and retail sales outlet in its space, possibly with limited snacks available to accompany the beer.

“From the outset we were committed to establishing our brewery operation in Buffalo,” Kahn said. “The neighborhood where the 337 Ellicott St. building is located is emerging as the next up-and-coming district in downtown, and the building serves our needs well.”

Iskalo bought the 32,878-square-foot former Verizon fleet maintenance and warehouse facility, including a small service bay, in May 2011, and converted the warehouse portion into indoor parking for the nearby Electric Tower, also owned by Iskalo.

But the facility still has some extra room, including on the second floor, and officials are considering options for the 7,000 square feet of space. Those possibilities had included apartments or office space, until the Big Ditch group began looking around for space downtown. Iskalo is going before the Zoning Board of Appeals later this month to seek a use variance to permit the brewing activity, which would take up about 4,000 square feet.

The new business is named after the pejorative nickname for the Erie Canal during its construction in the early 1800s, before the waterway turned into the catalyst for Buffalo’s economic growth into one of the nation’s largest cities by the early 1900s.

Beer brewing also has a long history in Buffalo, which has been home to more than 100 breweries during its existence – including 35 that operated simultaneously in 1872.

“Craft beer is growing rapidly across the country, including Buffalo, and Buffalo could use some more breweries. There’s plenty of room to grow in Buffalo, and it’s a good fit with our background. And we both love beer. It took a little while to come to the realization of what we want to do, but it made sense and we’re pretty excited.”

The pair have been “brewing and working on this plan” for over two years, but have primarily just made beer at home, in five- to 10-gallon batches to test their recipe and production.

“We sort of jumped into it thinking we might start a business, and learn from scratch, but it wasn’t a steep climb in terms of learning, because the process is so similar to what we do in our daily work that we would pick it up pretty quick,” Kahn said. “We work around big tanks all the time in our current jobs, and it’s the same for brewing. We’ve installed those systems, we’ve tested them repeatedly, so it shouldn’t be too much of a jump to operate the brewery.” "	t5_2qi6i	True

In June my wife and I will be moving to your fine city.  We’ve been apartment hunting for a while now, and have gathered advice on areas to look, and areas to avoid from my new coworkers and from various threads on here.  We’ve narrowed in on a property, the Horsefeathers building on Connecticut and Normal St., that’s currently under renovation; [Here’s there website](http://www.horsefeathersmarket.com).  I know that according to conventional wisdom this is venturing outside of the gentrified Elmwood area and headed into the West side. My question for you who actually live in this city, what do you think of this location?  I’ll be working at Buff State, which is just a couple miles north, and it seems easily accessible to Elmwood, Allentown, and Downtown areas.  I am fine with living in a poorer area, and where I live currently looks a lot rougher than this does by Google streetview, and I’ve never had any problems. At the same time I don’t want to be stupid about it, and move someplace unsafe. So, do you live nearby? Have you been to the winter market they’ve been holding here? Attend D’Youville down the road? Or regularly pass by this area?  If so what are your impressions.
Also any advice for soon to be Buffalonians?  Thanks!

**Edit**: some additional information.  We'll be moving from Texas, but both of us spent several years in Michigan so we should be at least somewhat prepared to handle winter.  We will have two cars with us, and we'll likely be street parking one of them initially.  Where we're at now public transportation is nonexistent, so anything will be an improvement. Will be sure to keep valuables out of the cars.  Thanks for all the advice so far."	t5_2qi6i	True

Some fuckers stole my scooter last night from downtown near the arena while I was at work. It was in a gated area but they cut the fence. Complex does have video but doubtful anything was caught based on their angle of attack and camera setup. 

Here is an album of some shots of the scooter: http://imgur.com/a/NBMUV

I left the plate on purpose since it's stolen at this point. If you happen to see this around your neighborhood shoot me a PM, I would love you and give you a nice picture of a kitty. The only difference is the stand I have on it now is black, otherwise identical on the outside to the pictures.
