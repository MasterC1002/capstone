Ramadan this year falls on a special time in the Jewish calendar - it aligns with the start of the Jewish month of Av. This month also has special significance and Jews refrain from eating meat for the first 8 days and then fast on the 9th.

From what I understand Jews and Muslims fast for different reasons (we usually do it for purposes of mourning) but it's nice to think that on July 16th we'll be fasting together.

1323899713.0	ncwql	I am not a Muslim.  I am in fact an athiest.  But something simple just gave me immense pleasure, and I wanted to share.		294	41	111	"I live in Alaska.  There are two halal shops in Anchorage that I know of, but otherwise, any signs of an Islamic presence here is extremely minimal (sadly, as I am fascinated by other cultures).

Stepping into an elevator just now in one of Anchorage's few ""skyscrapers"", I was joined by what I assume (based on dress) were two Somali women and a young boy of 2 or 3 years.  I don't know a single word in Somali, but I wanted to appear friendly, and offer a simple gesture of human decency - an act which I imagine may be exceedingly rare toward Muslims in modern America.  

The best I could conjure up was ""As-Salaam-Alaikum"", which seemed to please the women.  The boy looked at me with a silent smile, and I waved to him and smiled back.  As their floor arrived and they exited, the boy continued looking back at me, smiling (I'm a white guy with a big beard - probably funny looking to this kid).  I kept smiling and waving, and the women had to drag him a bit to get him moving.

It was a simple, probably soon forgotten gesture.  But making small connections like that, especially in this current climate of Islamophobia, gave me an immediate sense of gratification.

To Muslims everywhere, but especially here in the US: we're not all bigoted, racist assholes.  Maybe not even most of us.  You're as American as I am.  Peace be with you."	t5_2qhbp	True

Even though I don't understand a lot of Islam (due to ignorance mostly) I have found redditors here who are willing to explain, debate, read up on/inform others in a respectful way.

I fear for you on this day.	momentum77	211	41	97	"It has become clear from many of the posts throughout /r that there is a serious issue with the way some Muslims are framing this, and previous incidents. I'm actually disturbed by the self-victimizing and self-pitying that has been going on in our nation for the past century or two. 

Are we seriously continuing to blame the West for all our problems? Are we that shallow, to think that we are not responsible for our actions because so-and-so did this-or-that to us? I'm appalled. There is no excuse for causing havoc and mayhem, and disrupting people's lives. This ""fassad fil ard"", this corruption upon the Earth is unbecoming of you my brothers and sisters. I refuse to think along the lines that, ""well they were bad to us, so we can be bad to them"". Is that what the Prophet's life has taught us? Is that how he would've thought about this? Is Islam so threatened that we need to go ape-shit crazy because of some low production piece of crap video? This goes to show that our problem is much deeper and scarier than anyone has thought.

Applying psychological and anthropological theory on all this betrays the fact that we are more frustrated with ourselves and our Ummah, rather than angry at some obscure world power. It is our sense of defenseless-ness and disunity that makes us react this way. Like a rabid dog that has no other means to react to an insult. I believe that our Prophet would have taken the high road, laughed at this, and continued to focus on self betterment, self cultivation, and the advancement of society as a whole. That is the greater Jihad, the greater struggle.

It is not enough to pray five times a day to be a good Muslim.

It is not enough to go to Friday prayers, or fast Ramadhan, to be a good Muslim.

It is certainly not enough to wear your beard, and not wear ankle covering pants.

These are external gestures that can be taught to anyone, and can be repeated often without a thought. But is that what Islam has become? Is that what we've relegated this great religion to? Are we as a nation throwing all the advancements that our predecessors have done in the name of Islam?

You must strive! You must strive to take the higher road. You must strive to better your own self and how you react to others and their insults. You must, must, must improve how you treat your fellow human, regardless of creed. Muslims are not superior to anyone as long as they have not raised their character and their civility, as our fore-bearers had done. You must resist the urge to blame everything wrong with our existence on those who oppose us, for they have no power over us except for what Allah has ordained. And in order to honor our Creator, our Islam, and our Prophet, we must represent them with the highest values that Islam has brought. Anger, hate, violence are not what the civilizing mission of the Qur'an had brought to the savage Arab tribes and Quraish. It was in fact the very opposite. 

And so brothers and sisters, I leave you with this potent ayah to reflect upon...

1375455064.0	1jkem6	So, I visited an Islamic cultural center yesterday...	rustedkeys	199	40	100	"All I have to say is wow. :)

I introduced myself here before. A refresher to my story is that my boyfriend accepted Islam while in a relationship with me. I've been interested in Islam for some years, but never did I shift my focus to it to such an extent until it was put in front of me again. I do believe that it was put in front of me for a reason and I chose not to ignore it..

Well, fast-forward to the ICC visit yesterday. We both went. We didn't know where to start, so we went to the Masjid. A nice older man spoke to us and then took us to the main office. There, we were greeted by an Imam. He led us to his office and we asked questions. I was the one with more questions, of course. He explained Islam so beautifully. I already had had a sense of what Islam was, but there were some things I fully did not understand and know, as well. He also told us about their Arabic courses and Salat(Salah?) courses they have for new converts that will begin sometime this month. We both plan on attending those in the future.

When it was time for prayer, he invited us to go to the masjid and watch. The sisters helped me dress accordingly to be able to enter the masjid. Everyone there was so warm and welcoming to us. It was almost like everyone in there was family and even we, as strangers , were family, too. It was so beautiful. When we were there during the prayers, I had this overwhelming sense of peace that I've never had before. I almost wanted to cry.

That was when I knew that that day was the day. I did not want to put it off any longer. Upon returning to his office, we spoke a bit more and I took Shahada. My boyfriend had done it privately, but he took it in front of him shortly after I did.

I'm immensely happy with my decision to convert. I have been feeling happier and more at peace since my visit. They gave us Qurans, books, CDs and pamphlets as well. With what I have plus the internet, I will do what I can to become a better Muslim. 

We also spoke to the Sheikh about marriage. He came at a later time. He was also very nice. We just have to speak to him about everything at a later time and have an appointment with him.

Very quick: I did not convert because of my boyfriend. I would have converted eventually with or without him.. There were times when he even thought I hated the fact that he was Muslim. But that wasn't the case. I was just taking things slowly. I was at a different level than he was and I was questioning everything because I didn't know.

So, here I am. A fresh convert with a lot to learn. I hope to become the best I can be as Allah has willed for every Muslim to be.

**A)** A few hours after the Boston bombings, two men followed my youngest brother (he's fiiiiive, omgasdkjf) and I around the grocery store making all sorts of antagonizing remarks. My brother had no idea what was happening, and even tried to talk to them as we high tailed it out of the store...

**B)** On Monday, I was on campus, waiting for an advising appointment. A tall, well built man wearing a Wounded Warriors Project t-shirt comes into the advising office, and takes the only free seat: next to me. He takes out his phone to make a call, and in the finest stage whisper I've ever heard, starts bashing Muslims: 

""I didn't go to Iraq to come back here to see them."" 

""I didn't fight for her effing freedom""

The secretary at the desk literally started hyperventilating when she realized who he was talking about. 

He went on in that vein for a few minutes, including a lovely comment about being stoned if I were in my own country, even calling me illiterate and insinuating that I wasn't practicing my religion properly because my ""burkha didn't cover her face"". The entire time, he'd alternate between thrusting his upper body towards me and mugging me down. 

**C)** Also on Monday... I was driving down a street in the middle lane, only one other car in sight. The driver was constantly tailgating, nearly fender to bumper. I sped up a tad, and she veered into the lane to my left, lowered her driver's side window, and started screaming like a banshee. It was a beaautiful day, so my own windows were down. She was spewing the usual ""git back to your country"" and flipping the bird. She then swerved in front of me and abruptly came to a complete stop. My brakes nearly gave out trying to avoid a collision. She has the nerve to a) continue shrieking and b) slag down my driving skills. Um, hello, check your privilege pls, you're crossing a line there, buddy. And the entire time, I'm thinking that she's going to jump out of the car with a baseball bat and smash my windshield. But he carries on driving, and it just so happens that we're both making a left turn. And oh my Allah, she was still going at it. Meanwhile, cars have pulled up around us, and bewildered drivers, myself included -_-, were gobsmacked and staring at her. 

**D)** Tuesday.. I was filling up gas, and noticed a guy a few pumps away snarling. It'd be comical if it weren't so unnerving. Shaken, I got back into my car and pulled away. I noticed that hardly a minute passed and that he was doing the same, and a few moments later, he was behind me. I didn't think much of it, and zoned out for the drive home. By chance, shukr, while idling at a red light, I glanced in the rear view mirror and recognized the driver of the car behind me. I have an overactive imagination as it is, and ignored the ""omg nancy drew, you're being followed"". But a few lights and two turns later, he was still there. A trick that my dad taught me to figure out if you're being followed (don't ask) is to use your indicators. For example, you're in the middle lane. Indicate left, but merge right (of course, being mindful of traffic around you). [DON'T DO THIS THOUGH, OKAY, IT'S NOT SAFE] So I did that (the street was empty), and the guy started going left and realized I wasn't, then sharply swerved into my lane. Promptly drew up to a red light (oh great), I was shaking, shamelessly ran it omgomgomgomg I'VE NEVER RAN A RED LIGHT BEFORE, got caught by a speed-trap camera :c, and booked it at sixty mph in a forty straight to the freeway. Every light was green after that, alhamdullilah. 

For the first time, I don't feel so safe going out anymore. May Allah SWT protect us all.

1347567819.0	zu8ti	A Message from a Moderator in light of recent events at /r/Islam	h4qq	218	72	301	"May the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you all. 

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 

May He send His peace and blessings upon our beloved Prophet Muhammad, his companions, their families, and the generations after them. 

In light of recent events in /r/Islam, it is first, with strong praise, do I speak of our general population of /r/Islam subscribers. A majority of you have shown a level of calm and respectful discussion, and that is always highly encouraged here in /r/Islam. 

It is also noteworthy to state the opposite: there were a few that spoke with disrespect, insulting manners, and ignorance - such things are never allowed in /r/Islam, **Muslim or not**. 

After some deliberation amongst the moderators, a particular user was also banned from /r/Islam for comments being made in defense of the attacks on the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, and others - which happened to include Muslims that defended the Ambassador and died doing so. This user also happened to be quite abusive to several other users, which was also a primary reason before the more recent incident occurred. Let it be very clear, the rules of /r/Islam apply to non-Muslims and Muslims equally - while even on top of this, these rules are incomparable to the rules laid down by Islam itself upon Muslims. 

Excerpts from a message the Sheykh at my local mosque sent to the community in regards to recent events: 

&gt;It is on these grounds that I say firmly to the people of Egypt: what a group amongst you did was wrong. There is no justification within the teachings of Islam that would permit you to, in response to a derogatory film, storm an embassy and burn its flag. You know as well as I do that only the perpetrators of an injustice may be held accountable for that injustice. The US Embassy in Cairo, or anywhere for that matter, has nothing to do with the acts of a small group of Americans. I understand you were seeking to uphold the honor of the Noble Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and all the Messengers of God), but I urge you to consider that the legacy of the Prophet is not upheld through the storming of an embassy but rather through the embodiment of the noble character and principles with which he was sent.

&gt;I also say to those who perpetrated the assault on the US Consulate in Libya: you too were wrong and you do not represent the Libyan people. The attack of a Consulate cannot be justified and the killing of innocent people is not only unacceptable, it is deplorable. Again, there is no justification for this action and what you did is not only a crime against the victims but also a crime against the teachings of Islam and the noble value of respect for human life which is shared by all religions and all people.

&gt;I say to Muslims all over the world (as I write this new incidents are on the brink of occurring): the attacking of US Embassies is not permissible and your actions are not a defense of the message of our Prophet, but a betrayal of it. If you truly wish to defend his legacy then be the people who embody his message of mercy and righteousness and do not be a people of destruction.

&gt;I say to the producers of the film which portrayed the Noble Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in a disrespectful way and which lays at the heart of many of the protests that we have seen: freedom of speech is a right and a responsibility. It is not preserved in our Bill of Rights to be abused and used with negligence, hateful provocation, and belligerence. The use of such a right for the denigration of the religious beliefs of others is irresponsible and every human being will ultimately be held accountable for their actions.

May God reward you all with what is good. Keep doing what ya'll are doing. 

Sincerely,

h4qq

1369191533.0	1et6lw	As a Muslim, I find myself becoming intensely critical of Islam	shakenet	191	51	75	"Background: I am a Muslim, born and raised. I was born in a Muslim household and have a strong foundation of Islam, it's believes and pillars, it's history, and its practices. 

I consider myself a Muslim. But as I learn more about Islam, the state of the Ummah, our actions in the last century, our growing population, and our economic, social, intellectual, and political failures - I find myself becoming ashamed of being a Muslim.

There is not a single Muslim nation on this earth that isn't corrupt to its absolute core (except for, perhaps, Turkey). Muslims are leaving their nations, in droves, to live in the North America and Europe. Most import their customs and political ideologies to their host nations and refuse to assimilate, all the while praising their native homeland and striving to establish their Islamic political ideologies - which have utterly failed them back home. 

There are 1.2 billion muslims on the planet - and yet the scientific output from the so-called Islamic nations is near non-existant. It astounds me that 1.2 BILLION muslims cannot come together to strive towards improving the world for all of humanity (non-mulsims included) - instead we are:

1) Killing each other (Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Palestinians (factions killing each other)... etc) the list goes on

2) Living off of the aid from the west (Pakistan, Palestine, Egypt)

3) Immigrating in droves, to western nations and then working towards establishing Sharia in societies that are traditionally christian (the UK is a prominent example, the netherlands, parts of Toronto, Canada)... allthewhile refusing to, or being unable to institute appropriate reforms back home.

It amazes me that Muslims, a society meant to embody peace and tolerance, can react so violently. Muslim society is almost biopolar. For example, Muslim/Arab hospitality is amazing. Arabs have a tremendous culture of making guests feel welome. There is a tremendous sense of honour in the act of being generous and giving to  others in ones social circle - however, if you are wronged, or if your honor is questioned - all decency and respect is thrown out the window - and the situation quickly deteriorates into hatred, disrespect, violence, and oftentimes assault or death. 

Perhaps what really irks me the most about Muslims is the ""George Bush Mentality"" when it comes to islam. There is a lack of tolerance when it comes to differing point of views. Many (if not most) Sunni's consider their Shia brothers and sisters as Kaafirs (the reverse, on the whole, is not true). Any ideological deviation is considered Bidaah. This exclusionary approach to islam is tearing the Ummah apart - being ripped into pieces. 

From an ideological point of view - I have come to realize the majority of muslims have barely read the Quran - most don't even read arabic. And most have not read the hadith in any depth. The foundation of a muslims beliefe system is often based on what they are told - not what they have read or learned on their own. This saddens me because there is a tremendous volume of conflicting literature in Islamic history and theology to be discovered and reconciled - but instead we ascribe to viewpoints based on what sect or madhaab we were born in.

On the topic of Allah - I am beginning to ask myself some serious philosophical questions. 

1) A God who is all powerful, all knowing and all mighty obviously does not need a race of humans to worship and idolize him. However, I can understand why Allah will offer paradise to those who recognize him. However, what absolutely astounds me is how Allah can damn a people to hell if they refuse to recognize him him. How can Allah be insulted to the point of damning someone to hell for all of eternity for for not being recognized by his creation - a creation that, by comparison to Allah, is insignificant, to say the least. This sounds incredibly egotistical, and petty - to say the least. Almost tyrannical. 

2) Furthermore, Allah repeated states in the Quran that he guides whom he wills and he misguides whom he wills (Surah Yasin) - How can Allah, who is Just, misguide someone, and then damn him or her to hell? It makes little sense. Furthermore, there are ahadith that state that at 40 days from conception - the destiny of a newborns souls is pre-written. Weather that persone will live a good life or a wretched life will be determined before birth. Obviously we are not all created equal - and yet there are certain inalienable sins in islam, (homosexuality, adultery, murder, shirk) that will guarantee hellfire - yet these acts are predetermined and still we have to pay for these sins. 

I know that the prophet SAW got pissed off when the Sahaba asked him about predestination. But in all honesty - it is an excellent question, and I don't see how Allah can instill insomuch intelligence in man for him to entertain the concept - and yet deny him the right to ponder the question. If I were Allah  - I would have far more respect for those people of that used their judgement and arrived  at a logical conclusion, rather than blindly believed in something without any justification.

Finally, there is the idea of the logical rejection of Allah. I think most of us agree that there is no reasonable way to prove that Allah exists. If Allah does exist, which I believe he does, he has made it the option of disbelief equally believable, from a purely logical point of view. If a persone rationally chooses to disbelieve in God, which may or may not be correct - can he be held accountable for such a rational beliefe on the day of judgement? Will he be denied paradise if such a person was actually a tremendous source of good and yet denied the existence of god?

I'll admit I was hesitant to come here and read the articles on /r/islam. I've been on /r/Christianity, and /r/atheism. It was a huge flame war, constantly. 

Always about who is right and who is wrong, and why the other side sucks.

You people are wonderful. I've read the occasional "" WTF are those other guys thinking?"" but mainly it's about peace, love, and how to strengthen the bonds you have and forge new ones.

I'm actually an agnostic/atheist. You guys have given me some second thoughts about that. The message of Islam is very pure and strong. Sure there are the ""crazy's"", but I've found other religions to be much worse in that regard, especially over history.

Your religion has melted my cynicism.

1367031158.0	1d72tr	We have a sickness in our community. We need to face it head on, and deal with it. Enough.	ftothem	185	45	157	"Assalamualaikum everyone. 

Head over and read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1d6eb7/you_treated_her_like_a_piece_of_meat_judges_fury/). And then go to the comments, and Ctrl-F ""Muslim"". So yea, between Egypt's rampant sexual harassment, gangs that groom non-Muslim girls for prostitution and rape in England, Imams talking about how women bring on rape if they dress a certain way, 80% of women in Pakistani jails because of completely wrong rape laws, we've got a crisis on our hands. (Yes, there is media selection bias - but nonetheless, still a problem).

And you know what it starts with? ""Wow, look at how tight her jeans are, what a hojabi"". ""Yea, we went out, she's such a slut"". 

Frankly it comes down to this. If a woman is not dressed the way 'we' consider to be appropriate, if she doesn't follow the norms we think are right, she is undeserving of respect. In some places, this even translates to 'she is deserving of rape'. This is part of rape culture. 

But what hurts me, beyond being a woman and a feminist, is the way my **religion** is used by some of my brothers in Islam, to twist rape culture even further. These men, they may be few in number, use the religion to justify treating women like shit, like their personal target for ridicule and violence if they don't meet ridiculous standards. And if a woman is a non-Muslim, suddenly all of the ""the Prophet (saw) treated his wives with respect, Islam gave women rights"" stuff just vanishes into thin air. It's not just that she's a slut, it's that she's a non-Muslim, and somehow inferior. 

I've heard it time and time again, how Islam honors women, how we are placed so high. And yet, I've heard brothers coming out of the same khutba that I was in, come out and talk about dating a non-Muslim girl but marrying a 'pure' Muslim one. This is degrading to both the non-Muslim women, who are frankly treated like a hole to be filled, and Muslim ones, who are treated like objects that'll give you the Muslim kids and get you into heaven. 

I've heard Imams scold women for being a fitna for men, for seducing and luring them, as if a man holds no personal responsibility for how he chooses act. This is bullshit. This is the exact mentality that leads to forced burkas in Saudi. 

I've heard mothers reinforce this Madonna/whore stereotype by telling their sons not to look at so and so, because did you see how she talked to that one boy? She must be a ""bad girl"". No matter what the sons of our communities do, the double standard must be upheld. 

I cannot speak to the hatred that seems to exist in Muslim men in England towards non-Muslim women. Thankfully, I have not seen that in my community. But it's all rooted in the same thing. It's rooted in women being seen as sexual objects before being seen as human beings. This is not Islam. But this is the attitude of too many Muslims. And it needs to stop. 

I've got some ideas about how. My question to /r/islam is, what can we as a community do to better this situation?"	t5_2qhbp	True

1369326115.0	1ewsnc	Message to all violently radical Muslims	thethinkingmuslim	168	37	144	"The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said:

“Do not be people without minds of your own saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well, and that if they do wrong you will do wrong to them. Instead, accustom yourselves to do good if people do good and not to do wrong (even) if they do evil.”  [Al-Tirmidhi](http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=188389)

Based on the above, it is not appropriate for a Muslim to cite evil done by the western governments to inhabitants of Muslim lands as justification to do evil to western inhabitants. We have our own principles and standards, mentioned in the Qur’an and Sunnah, with which we abide by and need not lower ourselves to their standards. We even have rules of respectful engagements with prisoners of war! During the Prophet’s (pbuh) time, when a Muslim was captured, he was tortured, beaten, murdered and even mutilated, but the Prophet (pbuh) never returned this type of behavior towards non-Muslim prisoners. And if you have trouble understanding or believing any of the above, then you have never studied his biography and you need to enroll yourself into a seerah program and study his life from beginning to end.

So enough of your emotional arguments rooted in ignorance and more practicing the faith with actual knowledge and understanding. You can never truly understand your religion unless you sit at the feet of the scholars, and thus far every self proclaimed holy warrior against the West is so ignorant of his religion that he cannot even answer basic fiqh questions. Prophet (pbuh) called the scholars of Islam the inheritors of the prophets for the very reason that we should go to them and learn! And you will find this self-proclaimed holy warrior against the West take everything from a particular scholar except his fatwa on terrorism and killing innocent people in the West. Afterwards, he has the audacity to call this scholar, whom he takes everything else from, a sell out! This goes further to show that these guys are not really rooted in knowledge or understanding of their faith but are infected with serious emotional problems, ignorance of basic principles of their religion, and wanting to fulfill their false fantasies of adventure and danger.

It is also interesting to note that during the Prophet (pbuh) life, a man by the name of [Abdullah bin Ubayy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd-Allah_ibn_Ubayy) was a confirmed munafiq (someone who pretends to be Muslim but does not really believe in its doctrines) who was always causing trouble for the Muslims and plotting against them with their enemies. When Umar, one of his companions,  advised him to have him killed, he [“turned down his proposal on the grounds that it did not become of a Prophet (Peace be upon him) to be accused of killing his people.”](http://abdurrahman.org/seerah/SN/sealednectar/30.html)  This goes further to show that the Prophet (pbuh) did not want people to have a bad image of Islam and Muslims including himself. This notion is even more clearly stated in the following narration from his wife Aisha:

“The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, placed me on his shoulder so I could look at the Abyssinians [[who were playing with shields and spears]](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/13#2) until I felt tired and turned away from them.” Urwa [Aisha's nephew] said: “Indeed, I heard Aisha say that the Messenger of Allah said on that day, ‘So the Jews will know that there is flexibility in our religion; verily, I have been sent with a lenient, upright religion.’” [Musnad Ahmad, Number 24333, Sahih](https://www.facebook.com/DailyHadithOnline/posts/482035315151529)

The Jews are pointed out specifically in this version of the narration while in [other versions](http://islamport.com/cgi-bin/w/alb/search.cgi?zoom_query=%C3%E4+%DD%ED+%CF%ED%E4%E4%C7+%DD%D3%CD%C9&amp;zoom_per_page=10&amp;zoom_and=1&amp;zoom_sort=0), idol worshipers (mushrikeen) and Christians are mentioned. However, these self-proclaimed holy warriors go around giving a really bad name to Islam and its followers without thinking twice. Not only that but they’re actually proud of it! So I say to them, wake up and get your act together!

The man said thanks, but didn't take it and continued to ask passers-by for money. I immediately started to wonder to myself why a homeless person wouldn't want free food. Was he really not homeless? Was he doing drugs? My assumptions all lead me to judge him in the worst ways, and simultaneously fed my ego a high dosage of condescension. After a minute I wondered why those answers were the first to pop into my head and then realized the only person who could answer why he didn't take the food was him. So I asked him.

When I asked him why he didn't want the food, he said that he has no place to keep it. He had four sandwiches in a plastic bag that would stay good for a couple of days and taking more food right now would just be excess. Why would he take something knowing that he might not be able to eat it? Then it would just go to waste. He then asked God to bless me and I, in turn, asked God to bless him for teaching me to not assume.""

The fact that it takes a demented and psychopathic individual to kill innocent people is ignored. Instead, the extremists are portrayed as cold-blooded and rational killers driven singularly by Islam. 

Reports in the media suggest that the perpetrator of the Norway attacks was extremely hostile to Islam and felt that his nation's Christian identity and heritage was being eroded by multiculturalism. In one of his posts on the anti-Islam site Document.no, he states that the Protestant church (he identifies himself as a Protestant) must go ""back to basics."" But, Christianity, like Islam, preaches love, compassion, and tolerance for others. Let us look past his claimed religious fundamentalism and see him for what he is - a psychopath who killed nearly a hundred innocent individuals.

I'm a recently appointed mod over at /r/exmuslim.

It seems that there is a palpable atmosphere of disconcerting, mutual misunderstanding between both our communities.

I'm here to extend my hand in hopes to rectify that.

It is my hope that we will someday be able to understand each other better, and have the capacity to treat each other with due respect and dignity.

I want to be absolutely clear with the following:

Leaving Islam does *not* make me a better person than any of you. I am still prone to more error, fallibility, and lapses in judgement than I am comfortable with.

I'm quite confident that if you and I were performing Umrah together, and one of us tripped during the Tawaf, neither of us would hesitate to pick the other up and get them back on their feet. I hope you realize that we have far more in common as human beings than you might think.

I wish you all a very happy Ramadan, and an even happier Eid.

This is not how our Prophet (pbuh) would ever react to these kinds of things, and I'm sure were he alive today he'd be begging the people to dismiss their anger, and reach out with peace and understanding, and attempt to educate the ignorance we see from our fellow humans. Rather than destroy life and property to express your anger at this stupidity. The great overwhelming majority of Muslims would never imagine or dream of acting this way. How is that improving our lives? How is that improving Islam? How is that defending the honor of the Prophet? I'm sure 200% that he dealt with worse insults and defamations in his lifetime, yet he was merciful. So don't tell me they're protesting in defense of Islam. Their actions speak louder than your words. There is something deeper behind this that the Ummah is in denial about.	t5_2qhbp	True

I posted in r/converts but got no response.  

I am converting to Islam tomorrow.  A little backstory.  I have been contemplating this for years after being introduced to the religion by my close friend from high school.  After recent events in my life, I decided that I need spiritual guidance, and read more and more about the religion. Started reading the quran and felt a connection.  

I am going to the mosque tomorrow with 2 friends and am going to say the shahada.  Any advice?  It is also my first time inside a mosque so any helpful advice would be most appreciated.  
 
Also,  I only know minimal arabic, my only fear is that I mess up the shahada.  Anyone know where i can find a good translation of it?

Thank you brothers and sisters.

Edit-  Thank you all for the kind words and advice!  I am about to head to the mosque now so everyone take care!

Edit 2-Thanks again everyone!  It went well.  Here are some pics

1341835827.0	w9mog	Ex-Atheist, now Muslim	hydrohash	162	58	144	"Hello all, I will try to explain a few things that lead me to come to Islam. Some more controversial than others. Firstly I was born in Islamic culture, but I never clicked with it until now.

* Life had no meaning when I was an Atheist. I had to live the *""American Dream""* which is not something I was after, as it's too dull in nature.

* I found that many western Media sources have anti-Islamic views; since the dawn of Media. I've always wondered where the ""live and let live"" approach was when it came to Muslims. If you're thinking ""But terrorists are what Islam leads to"". I'll come out and say 1.7billion Muslims out there, but the world seems to think the ones that are acting **against** Islam, are the ones that represent it. 

* Also, western Media seems to be a fan of subliminally implanting thoughts into our subconscious about Judgement day (Inception in a sense). As an atheist, with an extreme interest in the brain, NLP, Hypnosis, subconscious behavior, was intrigued by the messages the Media would slip at subliminal levels that held strong anti Islamic views. 

Example: [Aladdin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SV04ilOvJY)

* I've also taken interest in ancient civilizations. Why were they advanced beyond their times? How was there accurate astronomical calculations? They were precise and it was impossible with the naked eye to come up with the calculations that they did (they being advanced civilizations globally such as the Pharaohs, sumerians, Babylonians, early civilizations in Cambodia etc. 

* Overnight boom in Sumerians agriculture system, scripture and a full-on language system, proper military system, the use of wheels, their proper astronomical depiction. It all came to that part of the world ""out of nowhere"", and the best reason has been (up until now) [Aliens](http://gatesthecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Giorgio-Tsoukalos-hal-hefner-ancient-aliens.jpg). 

* Where as the Quran has specific mentions of these areas, and it will not explain them fully, but you will briefly understand why they became advanced. Also, none of these amazing ancient civilizations lived to explain their history, they all became ""extinct"".

* Sacred geometry symbols that have been omitted from most historic text books, including the flower of life, which seemed to be the source of ""Knowledge"" for most ancient civilizations. There are specific and exact same patterns appearing all over the world. The ""Flower of Life"" in Osirian Temple seems to be LASER printed onto stone, check it out.

I found most *people* explaining these phenomenons were not fully satisfying, but they were all spiritual people. I did not find a credible scientist explaining them without resorting to something ""out of this world"".

* I found Religion (in general) is receiving negative publicity, when in essence, it is soothing and relaxing (think of meditation). It is not meant to be evil (only misinterpretation and misunderstanding leads to chaos)

* I found many virtues and statements to live a good life can be found in Islam. Since adopting it, I've been the happiest with my life, happier than when I was partying up until 6:00am, with lots of drugs and alcohol in my system. (I still believe everyone has the free choice to do what they will, I will not come to someone and blatantly say ""you're going to hell because...*reasons*"". I have no right to blatantly judge someone).

* Judgement day signs (the small ones) most have a check mark next to them on the list. The are depicted with fair accuracy. 

* There are many other reasons, but I felt like keeping this short (to a degree).

Hope this helps. Yes the points I made in essence can all be wrong, like the time in life when the earth was believed to be on back of tortoise shell. But I believe that Islam teaches us patience, and that good deeds will be rewarded, and justice will be served.

**Update**: Thanks for the positive feedback everyone. Jazakkom Allah Khayr Jamee'an. Please continue to strengthen your faith. If you feel that you can do more good deeds that help your family, neighbors and strangers then please do them. Think of the joy you bring Allah (SWT) when you do good to the world, and you help people with love &amp; peace (Islam). He will reward you for your patience and faith.
---------------
For those not satisfied with the answers I have given, I have to apologize. I did not mean to let you down. You must understand that I can not answer all questions, otherwise there would not be room for faith, and all the nations would be Religious &amp; Faithful if I had the hard proof answers.

* I have raised points that have helped me find my faith. I encourage you to continue research on these points that are unanswered by science. Please view as many sources from as many cultures, from as many languages (with translations), and different publishers as possible; to avoid &amp; weed out bias information.

* As I stated earlier with my disclaimer towards the end, all I say might be wrong. But I find religion tackles some of the hard historic-world-wonders with explanations that defies science. 

* I've also found many scientific Miracles in the Qur'an. I might do a post later about the science the Qur'an carries.

Thank you again all, and peace.

1329056427.0	pm1jz	Since Muhammad was very tolerant towards insults, then why aren't some of his followers?	MarinP	132	24	121	"I've had many discussions with Muslims and I've been reading stories from the Qur'an about Muhammad, and it seems very clear to me that he was a very vise and tolerant man.

When people insult him by putting trash infront of his door and wishing death upon him, he does not retaliate nor does he condamn it, rather he shows compassion, understanding and extreme tolerance.

I dare to bet that if you'd ask him about the ""Muhammad pictures"" issue he'd just say ""Don't give it any attention"" and that would be the end of it.

This man, as far as I can see, seems to have known that ""haters gonna hate"" and dealt with it as a true gentleman.

As an atheist I was surprised to find out that Muhammad was so extremely tolerant and cool with his ""haters"" so how come some Muslims believe that he needs to be defended against all forms and shapes of insults?

I almost find that notion condescending since it implies that Muhammad was a sensitive and petty man who needs to be defended nonstop to not have his fragile ego hurt. 

I have seen no evidence that supports that Muhammad was a sensitive and petty man, rahter that he was very good at dealing with critics and that he always answered hatred with peace and understanding.

So whence commeth the anger?

Please enlighten me :)

I was brought up in a very Christian home.  Church every Sunday morning, evening and every Wednesday evening.  I hated to go to church.  The reason for that was because when I was old enough to understand and ask my Sunday school teacher (and the preacher) questions, I got punished for asking questions.  I was told I was bad for asking, that I was sinning for questioning things.  I was a kid!  I didn't understand what they were teaching me.  I didn't understand how it could be wrong to ask for someone to explain to me why we believed this or that.  I learned quickly to shut my mouth and just deal with it. 


Years later, I moved into a neighborhood where I made acquaintances with  two women.  They always needed something and would ask me for things.  (Cigarettes, money, etc.)  They were not my friends, I just knew them.  They were two of the meanest women I have personally come across.  Both had killed people, for whatever reason. (I do not know who they killed or why they killed them.)  Suffice it to say, every time I saw them, they were rude, obnoxious, threatening, scary.  They never gave ME any trouble.  Nobody usually ever does.  I knew of these women for a couple of years.


One day, I noticed a BIG CHANGE in both of them.  They separated themselves from the other people they used to hang out with; they were no longer looking to hurt people.  They were no longer vulgar and disgusting in the way they talked or dressed.  They were quiet and calm.  They had a look of peace about them.  They actually sought out their victims and apologized to them.  They tried to help others.  I wanted to know why they changed.


I approached one of the two girls. I asked her what caused this drastic change and she said she converted to Islam.  I just nodded.  I had no real idea what it meant.  She was very happy, this I know.  I accepted her answer and left.  Even though she wasn't the mean girl I knew before, I was still scared of her.  


I mentioned the Quran to my mother one day.  She told me it was full of lies and hate, it was evil and those who followed it were born of Satan.  I was skeptical of this.  I approached that same girl and asked her if SHE had a Quran, and if she did, could I look at it . . . she did, and she allowed me to look at it. I paged through it, reading verses here and there.  I was shocked!  It mentioned prophets that I knew of from the Bible!  What little I read that day spoke of love and peace and kindness.  I never saw anything about hate and evil and cruelty.  My Mama was wrong.  I thanked the girl and gave her back her Quran.  I wanted to ask her more questions, but  I was still scared of her.  


A couple of years went by.  I was trying to find my place and I couldn't.  I was not content, I was restless.  I tried to attend church, I tried many different ones.  Each one viewed me as an outcast.  I wasn't really ever quite welcome in them.  This is most likely due to me being a single parent.  I'm not married, but I have a child.  (That is a horrible story, not a long one, but horrible nonetheless) So, I quit attending church.  Even reading my Bible never truly brought me any peace.  I felt as though my prayers were going unheard.  I didn't know what to do, I didn't know who to talk to . . .  


I quit going out with the friends I had, what they did and where they went wasn't right for me any longer.  I didn't know why, but I didn't question this, either, I just knew it wasn't right for me.    I began a Facebook.  


I wound up meeting a handful of people that would wind up being like brothers and sisters to me.  They happened to be Muslim.  They didn't ""preach"" at me or try to shove Islam down my throat as all the Christians always tried to do, but they didn't mind me asking questions.  For several months, as I talked to these friends, I saw how they were like that girl I knew . . . and every time I talked with them, it was in my mind and in my heart . . . why don't I ask them how to convert to Islam.   I was afraid, though.  This went against what I was taught growing up.  It was different from my family, different from my friends.  Very different from my community.  


I was afraid to convert even though I KNEW without a doubt that it was the RIGHT thing to do.  I was afraid I would be disowned by my family.  I was most afraid my Mama would quit speaking to me altogether.  She was what we call a ""die-hard Christian.""


It was on my mind day and night.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.   Wasn't it more important to do what God (this was how I was thinking that day) wanted for me?  I knew the answer was yes.  I decided to stop waiting, stop putting it off, stop questioning whether I'd be disowned.  From the very moment the words passed my lips, my heart felt so much lighter, I felt so much peace, and it's never ended.  I always feel this way.  I'm still new and I still don't know a lot.  Honestly, I really do not know much at all.


Allah, Islam, the Quran, my Muslim friends, are what helped me make it through the death of my Mama this 2 March.  I won't say I didn't cry, because I did . . .

I feel alone sometimes because, in my community, there are no other Muslims, not to my knowledge.  The nearest mosque is a 2 hour drive (one way).  Most of this town, if not all, are Christian.  And the friends I have here, in this town, I keep them at a distance.

Stay Strong and remember you aren't just abstaining from food, the hunger is the reminder that Allah is all great and powerful, humble yourself to the experience and use this month to build stronger bonds with your fellow brothers and sisters, friends, co-workers etc.

The hunger is love! The love of Allah and your religion, the love of the people around you, the love of your personal struggles and betterment, the love of life. 


Don't start getting into arguments about semantics between other Muslims and how they view/practice Ramadan. It isn't about that. Fixating on those differences is the problem, embrace others and just smile and laugh and love the diversity!

It was a long email where I gave some of my theological reasons and some of my experiences that led me to this point.  His response was fairly civil in tone I guess, but it was far from positive and this was the last line of his email:

""Lastly, when the time comes and your mother and I refuse to renounce Christ, will you lop off our heads or will it be some bearded stranger yelling Allah Akbar?""

Ugh.  And my wife hasn't been that cool about it either.  I found out that she posted on her livejournal account that I'd converted and it was ""weird"".  She's said a few times that she thinks fasting is dumb and asks me, ""Now, when are you going to be done with this fasting stuff??""

Brothers and sisters, this is a pretty lonely place for me right now.  Sometimes my wife will sit with me when I break my fast at night (I don't live close enough to the masjid to be able to make it to Iftar often), but most of the time I'm by myself.  I'm always on my own for Suhoor because everyone else is asleep.  I once made the mistake of telling my wife that I really wanted a cup of coffee and was hungry and she said, ""Don't complain to me, this is your problem.""  Since that time I try to keep my game face (and a smile) on.  It is what it is, and I will persevere, but I needed to get this off my chest."	t5_2qhbp	True
1335277647.0	spzfe	Convert Stories Thread.	hiddenmuslimah	119	15	146	"Asalam Alaikum Brothers and Sisters,

I wanted to start this thread because I feel like most converts had a tough time getting to where they are today as Muslims. It's empowering to hear these stories as well as share my own about the trials and tribulations Allah has set for us Alhamdulilah, in order for us to find the truth and hold on to it, no matter what. I'll share my story, and insha'Allah, whoever else wants to share, please share, I love to hear your stories.

My story starts about 4 years ago, when I was only 15. A bit of background about myself, I come from an Arab family. My family are Iraqi Arabs that follow the Christian faith. We came here in 1993, as a result I was born and raised in Canada. I have one brother who is 2 years older than I am. We are very close Alhamdulilah.

I used to be a partier, I was into heavy drinking, and dancing, typical teenager stuff. My brother was the same, we used to go to house parties together and hangout with our friends. I was very popular and accepted everyone, I was also very involved at school, teachers loved me, I was strong academically. 

My story begins one night when I was out partying at a house party, my brother was there as well but he was with his friends and I was with mine. As it got late into the evening, more and more people showed up, it became really crowded and I didn't know a lot of people that were coming in. I paid no mind and kept drinking until I was barely coherent. I was still aware of my surroundings but things were slow moving and I was woozy. A guy began hitting on me, and I welcomed it, as was my usual routine. He was pretty tall and built, he looked like he played football. I danced with him for a bit and then he lead me upstairs and I followed. I don't want to get into too much detail at this point, as it is difficult even now, 4 years later, to talk about. 

He made a move and I rejected it, and he tried again, I said no. I made it very clear that I didn't want to continue, but he continued until I had to kick him off of me. At this point he became angry and forced me down, I began screaming and he choked me. I don't remember much after that, everything went black. I woke up in the same room, my brother sitting over me, his eyes were teary and his jaw was swollen, and there was blood. I knew he must've fought the guy, but he was nowhere in sight. I was in a lot of pain, and at that point I knew I had been raped. 

What followed this tragic event in my life was years of depression and insomnia. I became reserved, I didn't talk much, my grades dropped, and I was suicidal. My brother didn't speak about it, he was messed up like me, maybe even more because he saw it happen. I used to stare at the ceiling for hours non-stop. I avoided going to school and my friends would call my phone and I would just let it ring. As time went by I progressed through my extreme depression to a non-responsive reservation where I was physically with people, but mentality I wasn't there. My parents took me to doctors, but I would blow it off, make up excuses. The most painful part of the rape was not being able to do anything about it. If I called the cops, my parents would find out I was partying and not being a virgin would devastate them and their honor. My brother knew this too and so it became our secret, though we seldom talked. 

This went on for two years, until one night, I heard my brother walking around in the hall way in our house. It was around 5 am, and it was odd to me that he was up at that obscure time. I listened to him go into the washroom and turn on the tap and it was on for at least 2 minutes. Weird. He left the bathroom and went into his room. I was up because I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd go in to talk to him. I approached his door which was open just a crack and peered in at him. He was standing with his hands over his rib cage, looking down and whispering to himself. I watched for another minute, and as soon as he prostrated I knew what he was doing. I threw the door open all the way and scowled at him. He sat up fast, and looked in my direction. He sighed a little, in relief I think? I was visibly upset and I started shouting at him. He shushed me and I kept going on asking him what the hell he was doing and why. He put his hand over my mouth and tried to calm me down a little. I started choking up, and while his hand was still over my mouth, tears began forming. For the first time in a long time I cried.

But this is /r/islam, not /r/talkaboutmyopinion. If you aren't a Muslim or somebody interested in Islam, why are you here? Do you really think we haven't taken the time to think about our faith and you're enlightening us with your intelligence? You have better things to do with your life if you don't believe God exists. Enjoy it while you can. If you're right, and there's no God, well, good for you, you'll cease to exist after you die. If you're wrong and we're right, well, you'll be recompensed for your arrogance and you won't have anybody but yourself to blame. Just stop bothering us with your petty orientalism. You won't accomplish anything besides wasting both of our time. If you want to argue about religion with people, there's a subreddit called /r/debatereligion. If you want to learn about Islam or discuss the faith with other people like mature adults without of screaming out ""THERE IS NO GOD YOU STUPID MUSLIMS"", that's what this place is for.

I honestly feel like a subreddit should be created where only Muslims are allowed so we can actually discuss our faith, as much as that prevents us from doing dawah.

&gt;Whoever Allah guides - he is the rightly guided; and whoever He sends astray - it is those who are the losers. And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless. [7:178-179]

TL;DR Does anybody else want a subreddit about Islam for Muslims?

I'm so proud to wear hijab because I understand it's for respect and protection. My mom didn't necessarily agree, but she still supports me. I told my dad yesterday and he completely flipped out and asked if I was going to strap a bomb on myself and that jihad means kill all white people and it says hateful stuff like that in the Qur'an. My dad is white, my mother black, they've been divorced since I was seven. I get texts from him later pulling specific ayah to back up his point of view, and he tells me how I will be seen as less than an animal by men in islam, simply a possession.

This is all pretty hurtful and stressful because I'm in college and now it will be more financially difficult without his help, but I trust Allah swt will guide me and provide for me. I just don't understand why we don't have groups that try to get out the truth of islam in america. The LBGT community have been very vocal about themselves; sure it can be annoying to some, but others are siding with them because they are learning more about their plight. So why don't we try the same? I know there is a lot of islamophobia and outright blind hatred for us who are simply trying to be obedient to Allah, but what about those people who simply don't know anything outside of what they see on tv?  

It's sad that I've been reduced to less than human and I ""deserve"" because I choose to follow Allah swt. It's sad that I face discrimination because I wear hijab. And it really makes me disappointed in American people who blindly follow the media and say loudly ""God bless America,"" but they really mean God bless WASP (White Anglo Saxon Protestants). They've left all of us out because they simply don't know us and we don't fit their view of an ideal American. I know all Americans aren't this way, and some just don't care, and others are making good effort to understand, but I'm just sad that my dad turned out to be that way. For anyone who has converted and not faced any family rejection, I thank Allah that it has been easier for you. For anyone who is thinking of converting and is afraid of rejection, I am with you and I pray that you find the strength to believe even if you never confess to your family. Allah Akbar.

1333391505.0	rpurz	Studying Islam, as a catholic, and having doubts within my own religion due to this	therealslimJJ	113	15	128	"A little back story to this:
This past summer I was placed in jail for a couple of months, in all honesty I should not have been in there, but I will not get into details. But, while in there, I became friends with a group of muslims, one being a convert from catholicism, and the religion really appealled to me. Also, while in jail, I would regularly attend church, and it was normally christian, and the emphasis they placed on believing in Jesus or you are going to hell, really deterred me from my own religion.

So, after getting out, I was entering into my third year of university, and religion being my minor (history my major) I decided to take a course in Islam. The course really opened my eyes, as I am from Southern Alberta, Canada, and we are generally close minded people, with a huge christian base, and everyone here only believes what they see in the media (which is absolutely terrible). Since this class I have become close with my professor, who is Muslim, and have begun to love the religion. Everything about it fascinates me. I love the teachings of Muhammad.

What has begun to bother me though, is that I am begining to want to convert, but I am afraid of the effects this may have. My mom is very open minded about the fact that I am studying Islam, but when it comes to the rest of my family, they constantly ridicule me for it, and take it as a joke. Especially when I was learning the Arabic alphabet, and reciting it outloud, they made fun of me. (the class I am in now is Islamic art and science, and we have been learning calligraphy) 

Are there any catholics, or christians, or jews, that have converted when their family is devout in their previous religion?

And are there any tips that any Muslims may have?


Also, right now I am working on a large paper on Reza Aslan's No God, But God, and I absolutely love it!!!

EDIT: I have taken many of your comments to heart, I am still studying the religion and learning more about it. My professor is asking me to take his next (and final course of Islam offered by my university) on Islamic Mysticism, which goes more into Sufism, Shariah and Ulama, and more on the interpretation I guess you could say. 

It is nice to hear so many people who have converted to reply, and this has helped me greatly, and I am going to discuss things with my fiance. 

Another question, mainly for the converts, what was the most difficult inner struggle you had with your conversion, for example, giving certain things up like pork and alcohol, Ramadan, or the 5 daily prayers?

A question for born Muslims, for those of you growing in the west, and possibly growing up around non-muslims, what were some of your greatest temptations, such as drinking or eating pork, or hanging with friends instead of prayer? One question I asked my professor was had he ever tried veggie bacon, and he kinda laughed and asked if they actually made it, and yeah they do because my fiance eats it, so he said he does not know if he would ever eat it, but would not consider it haram, and would have difficulty placing it in a category, what do you think?"	t5_2qhbp	True

While I was young my mother would read the Bible to me and I would attend church. This would die off over the years due to the family being busy.
I never had anything against Islam as far as I remember but I remember I didn't know anything on it at all. About a year ago I decided to learn about the world's various major faiths. I was tired of people burning Qurans saying Islam was a religion of hate so I decided to start with Islam. I bought a Quran and read the first couple of chapters over a period of a few months.
I finally quit my job and was able to attend Dr. Mazhar Kazi's (father of Yasir Qadhi) Islam classes at the Islamic Center of Greater Houston on Sundays (I always worked on Sundays and could never go.)
After three classes I was invited over to Dr. Kazi's house for dinner where he invited some other people who joined Islam. We had a deep discussion on my view on my faith. I kinda wanted to convert but was a bit in a halfway point. 
The next day when I awoke I had the great urge to join Islam. So a bit over a week later, I took my Shahada and I am now a proud Muslim.
I was a bit scared of what my family would think of me afterwords but God has blessed me with a caring and loving family.

I used to come to this subreddit in order to learn about Islam, to interact and learn about different Muslims of different cultural backgrounds, engage in theological discussions, and discuss Islamic topics with non-Muslim redditors. There were great topics on history, civilization, and current event topics directly relating to the practice of Islam around the world. This community also hosted a tight knit group pf anonymous friends. We didn't know each other on a personal level, but we knew each other and offered support to each other in a largely anti-theistic reddit/Internet world.

However, lately this subreddit has turned to r/worldnews - Islamic edition. I'm looking at the top submissions in the past hour right now and **out of the top 25 posts in r/islam 13 of them have to do with politics!** That's more than half of the topics!

I understand that many of us are distressed by the political situation in the Muslim world. The loss of innocent life is something that deeply pains us all regardless of religious or national background. Being aware of the pain and suffering of our Muslim brothers and sisters (as well as the many innocent non-Muslims) is definitely a part of our faith.

I'm not saying that we stop with the political topics, but can we please, for the love of almighty Allah stop flooding r/Islam with this?"	t5_2qhbp	True

1362941886.0	1a19z7	Silence on Iraq.	controlledascension	127	30	111	"Salaam. I am an Iraqi/American, and this has been bothering me for a couple months now. I have a very important topic to bring to your attention.

Very few people know what is really going on in Iraq right now. Many media outlets in the U.S. simply refuse to talk about it. The impression that this gives to the American people is that Iraq is no longer relevant - now, a decade after the initial invasion, the current government is peaceful, people have no problem with it, and the war is totally over. Sure, there are a few suicide bombings here and there, but they're starting to die down.

None of you is at fault if you do not know Iraq's true current situation.

In late December 2012, over two months ago, demonstrations against the government started in the city of Ramadi. These demonstrations spread very quickly into most of Iraq's major cities - Fallujah, Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, Hawija, Kirkuk, and so on (even Baghdad, especially on Fridays). The Friday on which this really picked up (around Christmas, I believe) was named the ""Friday of Honor."" There are literally million(s) of people out on the streets in peaceful demonstration against the current Iraqi government. These demonstrations, to give you an idea of them, bear many similarities to the Arab Spring (Libya, Syria, Egypt, etc) protests in 2011. The protestors in Iraq right now are even using the same slogan - ""the people want to topple the regime."" Not to mention, in many cities and universities, general strikes which basically close the city.

Now, what are these demonstrations about? Let's take a look.

Aside from phrases like ""foreign occupation"" and ""corrupt politics"" I'll try to describe this to you. The Iraqi government forces regularly, and very frequently, launch these ""search-and-raid"" operations in cities across the country. They break into people's homes, targeting the demographic of (Sunni young men - these are the people most likely to oppose the government) and, without charges, drag dozens of people away to locations that aren't revealed. They're detained into Iraq's prisons. Iraq's prisons are filled with things like neglect, mistreatment, brutal torture, and - in the women's prisons - even rape, which all lead fairly often to the deaths of the prisoners. Remember, these prisons are filled mostly with innocent people.

This might be the worst brutality of Maliki's government. Not to say there aren't many others, but you get the idea. The demonstrations shouldn't be so surprising.

Now let's look at how the government has handled the peaceful demonstrations. The demonstrations are mostly Sunni (the current Iraqi government is Shi'a-led), so they are taking place mostly in Sunni cities. In the cities which are well-mixed (such as Zubair), the government forces detained hundreds of people just at hearing talk of demonstrations. In Baghdad, they keep cutting off all the roads to split up the districts, and prevent unified Friday prayers. This is what happens in most of the cities. A thick distribution of government forces, with the military surrounding the demonstrators, denying them entry to the mosques on Fridays and blocking off cities to non-residents. In Mosul, just yesterday, the Federal Police opened fire on the demonstrators, [killing and wounding 12](http://www.heyetnet.org/en/index.php/guendem/item/196-maliki-forces-kill-innocent-iraqis) (the local police aren't as bad - check next paragraph).

January 25, the military opened fire on the peaceful protesters - who were carrying no more than their prayer mats - in Fallujah, killing and wounding over a hundred people. You can hear in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHB8qlYhnb8) of the shooting, some people shout ""where are the police?!"". Also, some policemen resigned after hearing about this, and joined the demonstrations. Granted, the local police might not be the *best* of people, but they can't compare to the military or special forces.

Speaking of that, a lot of the government crackdown is performed like that. The sheikhs and imams who support the demonstrations are detained regularly, to silence the voice of the people. Others are killed with civilian hitsquads (a defected army brigadier actually revealed the location of these, some time ago). Gunmen have gunned down these sheikhs and imams and later been seen passing freely through numerous government checkpoints.

So that's what I wanted to say. I'm not asking for anything but recognition. I don't even live in Iraq. I just don't want your eyes to glaze over it on a map, like a forgotten country, when it contains the struggles and hardships of so many people. And, if you can, spread the news.

Shukran.

After being bored on the Internet today with nothing else todo, I decided to lookup Islam to see what it was all about. Turns out I kind of like it, and am considering converting.  

So far what I like about Islam is: 
-Qu'ran is written in first person / ""Allah's"" word
-Allows us to question it, unlike the bible 
-No concept of original sin (one of the main problems I had with Christianity) 
-Less contradictions compared to the bible
-Qu'ran is not really meant as a bible or reference 

Things I don't like / have questions about: 

- ""Infidels"" / leavers or non-believers can be killed 
-If somebody leaves Islam, why is it up to the believers to take action against them? Why can't Allah deal with them on judgement day?
-Supposedly we get 72 virgins or something if we go to heaven? Or is this misrepresented in the media? 

**tl;dr: Atheist wanting to convert to Islam. My main problem is the fact of believing in a 'god' and 'heaven'.  Can I be a Muslim Agnostic, i.e. the fact I accept Islam as the true religion, but will not believe in Allah until judgement day?**"	t5_2qhbp	True

We then break for suhoor, and pray Fajir then each and everyone of us returns back to his daily business. This time, however, things were different. 

I stayed after fajir prayer speaking to my friend, inside my car which was parked outside the masjid. We spoke for a very long time concerning many topics, Fajir prayer is at 4:30 am, and I remained after till 8 am. While we were speaking, a person approached my car and knocked on my window. I rolled down my window and said, ""How may I help you?"" The man replied, ""Peace be upon you brother"". Realizing he was Muslim, I replied, ""and upon you be peace."" He then began to explain how we works the graveyard shift during Ramadan, and he takes the bus home, however, he realized that all the bus drivers are on strike (after waiting for two hours), and has no means of going home (he lived approximately 10 miles away). ""..so you need a ride"" I said, finishing off his sentence, to which he nodded slowly. 

I looked at him, then back my friend. I had just washed my car, and this man smelled really bad from the sweat which he was drenched in (it gets really hot in AZ really fast), and his clothes were dirty as well. I felt ashamed however, to prostrate to Allah seeking mercy from Him, when I can't show others any mercy. ""Sure thing, hope in!"" 

While driving, he told me he wanted me to drop him off next to a highway. I looked at him and said, ""Then what? you take another bus?"" 
""No."" he replied, ""I'll walk home from there."" I looked in my mirror and said, ""Not while you're fasting. I'll drop you off right at home."" 


The somali man sat there quietly then said to me and my friend, ""This brotherhood between us [Muslims] is what I cherish the most in this life."" 

We dropped him off, and asked him to remember us in his supplications.

FAST FORWARD. AZ gets really hot really fast. I was really really thirsty. I thought, ""I'll just sleep till iftar."" Even though I was exhausted, I wasn't sure how I would sleep feeling this dehydrated. After laying on my bed for a few minutes, I was able to fall asleep. By Allah my brothers and sisters, I will never forget what happened. 

I dreamed I was sitting in front of a banquet of food. I heard a voice call out saying, ""Eat and drink as you please."" I was overjoyed! ""I'm going to start with the water."" I thought. I sat there eating and drinking, till I quenched both my thirst and hunger...I then woke up to my youngest brother waking me up saying, ""Wake up, it's time for iftar."" 

""Iftar?"" I thought...but I wasn't hungry, nor was I thirsty.

I lost a loved one recently, and today has been pretty tough. But the most comforting response I received tonight, in response to a post on /r/Christianity, was from a Muslim brother:

&gt; Rest in peace, and may God have mercy on her soul. These words always help me when I lose somebody close:

&gt;&gt; O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, God is with the patient. And do not say about those who are killed in the way of God , ""They are dead."" Rather, they are alive, but you perceive it not. And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient, Who, when disaster strikes them, say, ""Indeed we belong to God , and indeed to Him we will return."" Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the rightly guided.

I have had many friends who are followers of the prophet Muhammad, but never have I been so touched by the hopes and prayers of a Muslim brother. I request your prayers for the soul of my deceased cousin... But I am eternally grateful for at least one individual of your faith reaching out to me in love as our family copes with this loss. I hope and pray that we will all see each other on a distant shore someday, praising the One True God.

&gt;#CAIR Statement in Response to Attack on Soldier in London

&gt;The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, said today in response to an attack on a British soldier in London:

&gt;“Anyone of any faith with a sense of humanity is repulsed by this brutal and cowardly murder. The American Muslim community condemns this senseless attack in the strongest possible terms. The only response to such inhumanity is for all people of conscience to unite and ensure that the rule of law and justice prevail.”

**Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR)** (https://www.facebook.com/CAIRNational/posts/10151474128482695)

&gt;The Muslim Council of Britain this evening spoke out, in the strongest possible terms, the news of a horrific murder that has taken place in Woolwich, London. Eye-witnesses suggest that the murderers made Islamic slogans during their heinous action and were thus motivated by their Islamic faith. 

&gt;This is a truly barbaric act that has no basis in Islam and we condemn this unreservedly. Our thoughts are with the victim and his family. We understand the victim is a serving member of the Armed Forces.  Muslims have long served in this country’s Armed Forces, proudly and with honour. This attack on a member of the Armed Forces is dishonourable, and no cause justifies this murder.

&gt;This action will no doubt heighten tensions on the streets of the United Kingdom. We call on all our communities, Muslim and non-Muslim, to come together in solidarity to ensure the forces of hatred do not prevail. It is important we allow our police authorities to do their job without speculation. We also urge the utmost vigilance and ask the police authorities to calm tensions.

**Muslim Council of Britain** (http://www.mcb.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2333:pr-template&amp;catid=40:press-release)

&gt;As we slowly learn more details about the terror attack in Woolwich, UK, our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of the victim. 

&gt;It is important to remain calm during a time such as this and remember that injustice cannot defeat injustice.

**Abu Eesa Niamatullah (1)** (https://www.facebook.com/AbuEesaPersonal/posts/175802939249548)

&gt;I'm so sad to hear about what happened in #London #UK today :( #Islam is innocent of the horrific crime that these deranged murderers committed! Two wrongs will never make a right. Our prayers are with the murdered man's family and with the Muslim community in the UK who are going to be under a lot of pressure after these savage mindless acts by these lunatics.

**Maher Zain** (https://www.facebook.com/MaherZain/posts/10151628830937970)

&gt;The news report out of woolwich is chilling. Authu billah. How heartless do you have to be to do that!

**Omar Suleiman (1)** (https://www.facebook.com/imamomarsuleiman/posts/582315838455128)

&gt;Same garbage, different pile:

&gt;1. A psycho murders innocent people 

&gt;2. Islam gets blamed

&gt;3. Fox news anchors pee their pants out of happiness

&gt;4. Imams condemn the brutality

&gt;5. Kids with no knowledge or adab jump on the Imams for not speaking out on on Syria and Burma because apparently they were born 2 days ago (ie. the day after that imam spoke about Syria and Burma)

&gt;How do you change the channel on this thing?

**Omar Suleiman (2)** (https://www.facebook.com/imamomarsuleiman/posts/582322151787830)

&gt;Islam didn't murder the man in Woolwich. It was perverse criminals using religion to rationalize their indefensible barbarism

**Wajahat Ali** (https://twitter.com/WajahatAli/status/337321893919076352)

&gt;A man was hacked to death in broad daylight in the name of Allah. What has the world come to? What kind of exposure to Islam drives a person to kill. Who are such people exposed to that they feel justified in carrying out murder? The man even came up to a camera to rant about what he had done and make out like he was doing it in the name of Allah and to defend Muslims.He murders a man in cold blood and then takes Allah's name. What a disgrace and what an insult to Allah! 

&gt;Please be vigilant as one extremist's action is another extremist's fuel. Already extremists have come out and tried to take advantage of this and divide our community. They will not succeed inshaAllah. 

&gt;Not only do I condemn this act, but the process of indoctrination that has led to it. The madmen in our community must be exposed and our authorities must do more to take action against them. 

&gt;Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family of the victim.

**Shams Adduha Muhammad** (https://www.facebook.com/shamsadduha/posts/201633613318502)

&gt;'Woolwich murder' can only be perpetrated by someone not right in their head... Just makes life difficult for us 'normal' Muslims!

**Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari** (https://twitter.com/Mufti_Muhammad_/status/337341560708534274)

&gt;So, a day later, we can report from #Woolwich:

&gt;- Two murderers had the gall to pollute the minds of hundreds of millions of people by shouting the sacred words of ""Allah is Great"" whilst doing nothing great, and doing nothing related to Allah.

&gt;- They slashed a man to death whilst quoting BIBLICAL passages.

&gt;- They do this and then walk around the manor as if they were shopping in the shampoo aisle of the local supermarket.

&gt;- An act which was clearly meant to terrorise everyone has just confused everyone instead.

&gt;- Thus what is clearly an act of isolated deranged criminal freakishness has been magically transformed into a Muslim terrorist invasion of Great Britain. Obviously.

&gt;- Who's signed up to ""defend their country"" against said invasion? The English Dummies League - a motley crew of true criminal terrorist thugs who worryingly don't know their pint glasses from their a****. #EDLthat

&gt;This is just ridiculous. Time to move on. Where's Premier League Football when you need it?

While this is a correct answer as the Qur'an and ahadeeth are the two main resources of Islamic knowledge, can we be a little bit more specific please?! The Qur'an has 114 surahs and there are like hundreds of ahadeeth.

I felt so bad for that poor army soldier who posted asking for where there was peace in the Qur'an because all he hears where he is at is the violence. So many just posted ""read the Qur'an"" instead of listing specific verses or surahs. As if he has time and understanding to ponder over the whole thing and figure it out for himself. If he did, he wouldn't have asked! 

Context and tafsir are important too! I saw that one redditor did post a specific verse but unfortunately it was taken out of context and the wrong part of the verse was focused upon. 

Alhumdullilah, many of us were blessed to be born Muslim and we can't understand the struggle that non-Muslims go through to find the truth in quite the same way. So let's use the knowledge and understanding that Allah swt has blessed us with Alhumdullilah to help others as much as we can.

I'm not going to take too much of your time, insha'Allah, but after the last week or so of posts, it's evident that it has become necessary for someone to say, **""Keep calm and say subhan'Allah.""**

With all due respect to everyone here--Muslim, non-Muslim, Troll, whomever--it's really sad to see this subreddit devolving into what is, essentially, an Islamo-centric version of the frontpage.

Weak anecdotal evidence taken as a general standard. Ad hominem and straw men arguments. **Arguing without *edeb*.** (And in a lot of cases, knowledge or context). And overall harshness.

It's a turn-off, r/Islam. So just imagine what someone who stumbles into this subreddit might think. I've been in enough communities to know the old gag about how some of our *masajid* are too busy with the ""*Fiqh* of Parking"" to get anything of real substance accomplished--for themselves or their communities. And honestly, it's not hard to see why when this little, teeny, tiny internet forum is, really, a microcosm of all that.

Threads and posts just throwing around *fatawa* like it's confetti at a wedding; saying this person or sheikh or Redditor or that idea or whatever is *kufr* and just throwing around the Haraam Hammer like you're Thor; non-stop arguments baiting atheists or about atheism; and 100 threads dedicated to the same asinine conversation that, ultimately, goes nowhere and solves nothing. And it's sad that no matter how many *ahadith* or *ayat* I could post to support my points, it still wouldn't register with some of you.

There is so much more we all could be doing with our lives than argue about things that, subhan'Allah, we might never agree on. (Meaning, for example, if you want to be *zahid*--or more conservative--then be conservative with yourself and leave others as long as what they are doing is permissible within Islam.) And this subreddit could be so much more than what it is. (Meaning, just because something happened in the Muslim World geographically, doesn't necessarily means it belongs in this subreddit.)

That said, two quick final points (in case anyone is interested, insha'Allah):

-[Islam is a moderate way, a practical way.](http://quran.com/2/143)

-[Haters gon' hate. Get used to it.](http://quran.com/3/186) And if you can't get used to it in a civilized manner, then channel that frustration and [do something positive to undo what was negative.](http://quran.com/13/22)

The more I see people attacking Islam with such passion the more i get drawn to learn more.

I must admit though; few years back it was fun (even for me) to make fun of Muslims and their belief but as i started to learn more i found more flaws in my Christian church belief than in Islam.

I considered atheism first then I started reading here and elsewhere about evidence of GOD that I always think of.

I do not believe atheism is the answer. That is my feeling.

&gt; Religions

I have been always a supporter for the Palestinian cause (the west is very bias against them) when I started asking questions about them I could not believe that some of the answers I got from people of my church is that the sooner Palestine is wiped out the sooner our lord will come. I was speechless. So I stopped going to church and started reading about the faith of Islam among other religions.

I learned about the sharia and first I though it was terrible.. then again I learned it was in the bible all this time but we were told that did not mean anything.

That got me more intrigued into Islam.. I remember there were nights i stayed up reading most of the night fascinated with the teachings of Islam.

There was something holding me though. I could not put my hand on it. I think it was not time yet.

Today I came checking on /r/Islam and saw the same people here that come daily to attack Islam pointing out how many Muslims leave Islam. That reminded me of that I met a nun in my old church that later became a Muslim.

It may have been the nudge i needed and now i feel a strong rush of my blood and my heart pumping hard as I take the decision to declare that I TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT THE ALMIGHTY GOD ALLAH, and that his prophet who i learned to respect his teachings is a wonderful prophet of ALLAH.

I know this is going to be tough for my family to accept. But I have made up my mind and May Allah help me.

EDIT: I can not believe how many atheists here have been posting and PMing me hoping to change my mind. it's like vultures here. Same names I see for the past few months but this time coming after me.

1350226712.0	11gmty	The Prophet (saws) &amp; the Alcoholic	tazb	104	21	37	"There was a man named `Abd Allah who loved Allah and His Messenger so much that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had to declare about him: ""Indeed, he loves Allah and His Messenger."" [Sahîh al-Bukhârî (6282)] 

This man named `Abd Allah so loved the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he used to delight in presenting the Prophet with any delicacy that came to Medina, so when any merchant caravan arrived with something like butter or honey, he would take it for him as a gift. Later, when the seller demanded payment, `Abd Allah would bring the seller to the Prophet and say: ""Give this man its price."" 

The Prophet (peace be upon him) would then say: ""Didn't you give it to me as a gift?"" 

`Abd Allah would say: ""Yes, O Messenger of Allah; however I cannot afford to pay."" 

The two of them would laugh together and then the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have the merchant paid. 

This was the type of close and jovial relationship that `Abd Allah and the Prophet had with each other. 

It remains to be said that `Abdullah was an alcoholic. He would often become so drunk that he had to be brought staggering through the streets before the Prophet (peace be upon him) to be sentenced for public drunkenness, and each time, the Prophet would rule to have the prescribed punishment carried out. This was a common occurrence. 

After `Abd Allah had departed from one of these all too frequent sentencings, one of the Companion's declared about `Abd Allah: ""O Allah curse him! How often he is summoned for this!"" 

The Prophet (peace be upon him): rebuked that Companion, saying: ""Do not curse him, for I swear by Allah, if you only knew just how very much indeed he loves Allah and His Messenger."" [Sahîh al-Bukhârî (6282)] He then added: ""Do not help Satan against your brother."" 

We can learn a lot from the Prophet's attitude. 

We should reflect first upon the close and affectionate relationship this Companion enjoyed with the Prophet (peace be upon him), in spite of this Companion's shameful fault. Though the Prophet (peace be upon him) was who he was, it did not prevent him from relating to `Abd Allah in a familiar manner, of being his friend, and joking with him. 

This shows us that in the society envisioned by the Prophet (peace be upon him) people were not segregated into the pious and the sinners, with social interactions debarred between the two groups. Rather, it was a unified, inclusive society, where each person could be at a different level of piety. Some were at the forefront of righteousness, some were moderately pious, while others were prone to fall into sin. However, no one lived aloof from society, nor was anyone shunned. Everyone remained part of society. 

This inclusiveness meant that when some members of society fell into error, the effects of their mistakes were limited and short-lived. No one was marginalized, so there was no chance sinfulness to grow on society's ""fringes"". When anyone made a mistake, there was no end of brotherly support from others in society who were more than willing to lend a helping hand and get that person back on track. 

Another lesson the Prophet's conduct shows us is the importance of maintaining a positive outlook. In spite of the fact that `Abd Allah was frequently being summoned before the Prophet (peace be upon him) for public drunkenness, the Prophet drew everyone's attention to one of Abd Allah's positive qualities – that he loved Allah and His Messenger. Yet, when we think about this particular quality, we find that it was not something unique for `Abd Allah, but a quality that all believers have in common. Nevertheless, the Prophet (peace be upon him) chose to praise `Abd Allah for this reason. In doing so, the Prophet could cultivate, encourage, and strengthen this quality in everyone. He also reminded them that if someone slips up, that person's faith and love of Allah is still intact. 

We can imagine how `Abd Allah must have felt when he learned that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this about him. He must certainly felt it as an immense honor to have Allah's Messenger declare this about him. It served to help him overcome his bad habit and gave him hope, by confirming that his essential being was not permanently marred by the mistakes. 

It was the Prophet's way to point out the good qualities of those who sinned and fell into error. We sometimes forget this, and treat past sins as impenetrable barriers to future good. A person who commits a shameful deed is never allowed to live it down, but is instead often remembered only for that sin. We need to realize that this helps Satan to avail upon the sinner and get that person to sin again. The Prophet's approach, by contrast, inspires virtue. When reminded of `Abd Allah's frequent drunkenness, he boasted of that man's possessing the greatest virtue of loving Allah and His Messenger. 

Finally, `Abd Allah had done something that was clearly wrong. There can be no doubt that `Abd Allah committed a sin. Imbibing intoxicants is a major sin, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) had often cursed wine. Nevertheless, after the Prophet had the prescribed sentence carried out upon `Abd Allah for his public drunkenness, he did not seek anything further against him. He saw any further reprimand to be helping Satan against the man. Rather, he turned everyone's attention to his merits that compensate for his shortcomings. 

This should give us pause, when we consider how harshly we sometimes behave in our disagreements with others whose transgressions are far less serious or certain than `Abd Allah's were. Sometimes, it is merely our opinion that someone has done something wrong and the matter is really open to other points of view, but we still have no hesitations about railing against our opponents with everything in our verbal arsenal. How far this is from the example set by the Prophet (peace be upon him), who when faced with a person committing an obvious sin, still found it better to speak good about that person. He still kept up his good relationship with that person, despite his shortcomings. 

The Prophet's conduct with `Abd Allah is an excellent example for us, full of valuable lessons regarding not only how we should treat one another, but how society can foster social bonds that are strong, wholesome, and nurturing, bonds which can serve to dissuade people from falling into sin.

Long story short, I'm agnostic who was raised Catholic (very laxly). I looked at Islam once or twice when I was young, but without removing my blinders of cultural prejudice. I really didn't read anything but what I wanted to, that is, I took in no new information, but forced everything I saw on Islam into pre-conceived mental channels, which, now that I see Islam in a very different light, I realize is all-too-common in America. 

I actually have been reading the Bible and studying tons of philosophy, theology, science and history books in the last 3-4 months, looking for answers. I got into reading about Islam to defend my argument with you lol! But the more I read about Islam, the more it appealed to my logic, and the more surprised I was. Also, your willingness to engage me in debate with kindness no matter how forceful I was, versus /r/Christianity who deleted my posts and banned when I questioned the trinity or divinity of Jesus, made a very big positive impression too.

Here is a thread on debate religion that summarizes my tipping point on reverting and what is influencing me, for the curious.

and Dr. Laurence Brown's books MisGod'ed and God'ed really affected me strongly as well - highly recommended reads for ANY cultural Christian.

I felt like I had to share this with a Muslim population, and since I don't have many close Muslim friends I can share this with, I decided that this would be a fair place. Also I believe that  some non Muslims may have had this experience as well.

A bit of my background first since I'm not aware of the demographics here. I'm from West Bengal, in India. India is a country that has a large population of Muslims and we have a long history of interaction with Muslims. We are a nation that prides itself on religious tolerance and we have members almost every religion there are. Though there have been religious violence in the past in India, for the most part we are staunch defenders of religious freedoms and I'm proud to say that no government has been elected in India at the center on the basis of communalism.

Ever since my childhood I treated Muslims as just regular people like me with a different set of beliefs. I was told that the burqa was worn by Muslim women and I just accepted it as a dress system. There are two mosques and temples withing walking distance of my home and every day from my childhood, I have heard and still hear the sound of prayers over the microphone. So you can imagine that there was no chance of me being intolerant of Islam. 

Then 10 years ago, 9/11 happened, and the newspapers were awash with descriptions of  the 'evil' terrorists. This gradually grew into 'evil' Afghans and 'evil' Iraqis, and then every Muslim around was seen as a threat by the US media. Let me emphasise that this was the accounts from the US media that swamped the channels. This was hardly the stance of India.

In college, where I'm currently studying Media, I learned how the media forms a dominant opinion. So being aware of their methods I considered myself immune. It was around a year or so back that one day I saw a Muslim man and a woman in a burqa walk down the street and the first thought that went through my mind was 'terrorist' and 'oppressed woman'. This made me freeze in my tracks. I realised that I was hardly immune to the conceptions of Islam that the Western media wanted me to have without any knowledge of my own. 

I immediately made a decision to overcome this influence as much as possible and I've become successful, though work needs to be done. I started talking to Muslims on the internet to clarify misconceptions and then gradually moved on to broader studies of various religions, which led me here. The process is ongoing, and I will keep going.

1322033644.0	mmias	Why did Muhammad marry a nine-year-old girl? 	DesertDude	121	43	322	"Being from Arabia, this was never an issue to us. But I noticed recently a lot of comments and threads about this issue, so I found a small book (25 text pages) explaining this issue. 

[The Booklet (PDF)](http://media.rasoulallah.net/rasoulallah.net/Why-did-Prophet-Muhammad-Marry-Aisha-the-Young-GirlEN.pdf)

TLDR for this book and other sources:

1. The kind of marriage between girls 8-9 to men 50-60 was common throughout the world.

2. If it was something perverted or out of the ordinary, the prophet's enemies would have seized this priceless opportunity to tarnish his image, name and message. But not a single one of them said anything. It was very natural and common.

3. The idea was not the prophet's in the first place; a woman he knew (by the name of Kholah bint Hakim) suggested Aisha to him.

4. The purpose of the marriage was not pleasure. The prophet never married anyone else as young as her. In fact, his first marriage was to a woman 40 years old, when he was 25. If he was interested in young girls, he would've married many of them during the peak of his youth and manhood, before the enormous pressures and pains of prophethood and all the wars, politics, and troubles that go with it, including his older age.

5. The reason he married Aisha? To strengthen the bond between himself and his closest, most loved companion: Abu Bakr, Aisha's father.

6. These ""bond marriages"" were common then and still common today, where tribes inter-marry to tighten their relations, sometimes following feuds, and sometimes just for the purpose of bonding for more tight-knit communities, e.g. a city is comprised mainly of three main tribes, so they inter-marry so the whole city would practically become like one family.

7. The prophet married other women for the same reason. For instance, he married Ramlah the daughter of one of his greatest enemies, Abu Sufian, after which Abu Sufian's enmity greatly subsided and hatred and wars between Makkah and Madinah lessened.

8. Aisha was already considered of marriage age: she was engaged to another man by the name of Jubair bin Mut'im before her marriage to the prophet. 

9. The prophet married a woman by the name of Sowdah bint Zamo'ah, who reached menopause. His marriages don't have even the remotest pattern of someone who marries for pleasure; he marries for higher reasons: to bring people together, to avoid bloodshed, to strengthen the community, and so forth."	t5_2qhbp	True

The Muslims of the Golden Age were literate, open to new ideas, and studious. It seems like now, if you have a religious look, perform the basic rituals habitually, and shun anything not deemed ""religious,"" then you are respected. I don't think this is what Muhammad intended. (salalaahu alayhi wa sallam) And sometimes at a lecture or muhadarah, you ask a question and you get such a bad answer (even from people who are purportedly VERY well educated in Islam.) It just seems like scholars aren't willing to develop an understanding of the cultures within which they preach.

Religion in the hands of the ignorant is very dangerous. I respect the people who wanted to get away from Islam because it was being so terribly misrepresented to them (by mixing it with oppressive cultural values alien to Islam). I feel like if I can't speak Arabic and read the classical sources fluently, I am just pretending to know Islam. If we don't concern ourselves *daily* with the plight of the downtrodden (the poor, disabled, drug addicts) then we are just pretending to be Muslims. Let's not kid ourselves. We aspire to be Muslims and it is an honor to live by the chivalrous code of Islam but we fall so short that it's like we're making fun of it by saying we're a part of it.

What I would like to see more of:

1. Be good to your family
2. Serve others and take helping the downtrodden seriously
3. Make sure you're on the right track to becoming fluent in Arabic
4. Don't try to seek out people to ""convert"" to Islam when 99% of the people who were born Muslims have no clue what the religion even requires. Go to them and educate them about manners and serving others. Our rituals are hollow if we don't understand them and if we aren't surrounding them with service to others.

/rant

I'm not good at responding to posts so forgive me if I don't interact much - I'm very busy but I wanted to get this out there. I hope someone who considers him/herself ""religious"" gives this a serious read. Personally, I consider myself so shamefully uninformed about Islam that I barely feel comfortable calling myself a Muslim. The title of Muslim is an honor we don't live up to.

1375754460.0	1js7k6	So I witnessed the death of muslim during the month of Ramadan	shakenet	93	16	30	"I work as a gastroenterology fellow at a major North American city. It just so happens that today was a hospital holiday, however I was scheduled to be on-call today. 

Our emergency department is divided into three sections: Ambulatory care (walk in), Monitored care (where patients need continuous vital sign management) and Resuscitation (where the major traumas and unstable patients go).

It just so happens I was in the Resuscitation area talking care of a patient when a trauma case arrived. A pedestrian sustained a head trauma from a construction site accident. He was probably dead on arrival, but the ER staff went through the motions of chest compressions, intubation, chest tube, etc... eventually they called his time of death, the resuscitation room quickly emptied out until it was just me and him.


As a gastroenterology fellow, I am rarely involved in the care of critically ill patients (I wasn't involved in his care), however I have been involved in countless resuscitation attempts and witnessed many deaths during my training. It is just a part of becoming a physician. 


Out of curiosity, I decided to walk over and take a closer look despite the fact that he wasn't my patient. I saw a young man with a well trimmed beard, probably from the same ethnic background as myself. However after death, when the blood starts to pool and the skin becomes pale, it becomes difficult to ascertain a person's true skin color (and hence, ethnicity). However, when I read his name, I knew he was a muslim. 


Death does not usually affect me. Especially the death of a patient or other third party. I have never been personally affected by death. However, knowing that this man had died while probably fasting had an unusual affect on me. I too was fasting. Both of our bodies were deprived of nutrition for the sake of Allah. He lay there before me, lifeless, persevered in an eternal state of worship. 


I stared at him for a good three minutes. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to think. I eventually carried on with my business. A few minutes later I saw a few members of his family arrive. Some of the women wore a hijab, some of the men were bearded, all were crying. His mother, who was in a tremendous amount of emotional pain said something that shook me:


""God, on the day of judgement, you and I shall fight"" 


I was shook because I finally understood the pain of mother losing a child. Although I did not know the gentleman, I later learned that he was a friend of a friend. His family was friends with people I knew. He was a teacher. Over the course of the afternoon, it all became very human for me. 

Because the gates of heaven are open and the gates of hell are closed during the month of Ramadan, some people say that dying during this month guarantees paradise. I believe that regardless of when one dies, paradise or hell will depend on how Allah judges us based on our beliefs and actions. However, I could not help but feel that his death, during this blessed month, holds some special significance, especially if he died while striving to come closer to Allah. "	t5_2qhbp	True

**edit: this is a rough idea of how we can organize this initiative. If we need to we can use the r/Islam mumble (voice and text chat) for faster planning**

[This is how I feel right now](http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/determined-serious-chiseled-not-okay-l.png)... I'm making a sincere intention that for the sake of Allah SWT and for the sake of teaching others about our way of life that we get a FAQ section in the sidebar organized and working. Since it's being (largely) ignored by much of the community and has only been mentioned in short bursts, I'd like to gather up some r/Islam members and talk with the mods about creating an *organized* and *categorized* section on the sidebar about Islam and the various subjects that go with it. 


**These are things we have right now:**

* r/IslamFAQ, a clustersmush of posts linking to posts by the r/islam community
* we have an open IRC channel
* we have a FREE voice/text chat network available through br deebstr called Socal United Muslims (SCUM), more info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/pd6yn/muslim_gamer_we_have_our_own_voice_chat_server/)
* theDailyMuslimRage actually does [amazing da'wah](http://slacktory.com/2012/02/muslims-are-making-rage-comics-on-reddit/) mA!


**Possible objectives (rough ideas):**

* A few people (NOTE: few) to create an outline. Preferably those with experience in da'wah (spreading the message of Islam through invitation not solicitation). These can link to videos, transcripts, or very well written posts by our members explanations given by notable and easy to understand da'ees.
* A large group of dedicated individuals to hunting down content and submitting it. These can be submitted gradually (like 3-5 posts a week).
* A team to cross-reference submitted posts and review submissions
* Probably the most important: select a team lead (my vote is h4qq if he's not too busy).

**This is a serious concern of mine and some other people who have expressed the same feelings. I think it's absolutely critical for the success, growth, and education of this community as with all communities. Knowledge is power.**

**Please do not volunteer if you are extremely busy and have many many other commitments. The last thing you want to do is take on too much and spread yourself thin.**


**Possible resources (so far):**

* [Why Islam](www.whyislam.org) - I know we have more than a few da'ees here.
* [Very large, digital collection of searchable ahadith](http://msawest.net/islam/76-sunnah-and-hadith)
* Your du'a (prayer)

It is used primarily by Muslims, and often, albeit not exclusively, used by Bahá'ís, Arabic-speaking Eastern Catholic Christians, Maltese Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, Mizrahi Jews and Sikhs.  
  
Allah is the pivot of the Muslim faith. Islam’s holy scripture, the Qur'an, constantly preaches Allah’s reality, his inaccessible mystery, his various names, and his actions on behalf of his creatures. Three themes preponderate: (1) Allah is the Creator, Judge, and Rewarder; (2) he is unique (wahid) and inherently one (ahad); and (3) he is omnipotent and all-merciful. Allah is the “Lord of the Worlds,” the Most High; “nothing is like unto him,” and this in itself is to the believer a request to adore Allah as the Protector and to glorify his powers of compassion and forgiveness.  
  
Allah, says the Qur'an, “loves those who do good,” and two passages in the Qur'an express a mutual love between him and humanity, but the Jewish and Christian precept to “love God with all thy heart” is nowhere formulated in Islam. The emphasis is rather on Allah’s inscrutable sovereignty, to which one must abandon oneself. In essence, the “surrender to Allah” (Islam) is the religion itself.  
  
Allah can be best described in the following Qur'anic chapter:  
  
&gt;**The Fidelity (112)**  
Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; [1]  
Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; [2]  
He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; [3]  
And there is none comparable unto Him. [4]  
  
**Adhan**: The call to prayer. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUHDYlJHaOQ&amp;feature=related) is how it sounds like.  
  
**Ahl al-Kitab**: “People of the Scripture,” or followers of pre-Islamic monotheistic religions with some form of scripture believed to be of divine origin. It refers to Jews, Christians and Sabians.  
  
**Akhirah**: Hereafter.  
  
**Alhamdulillah** is an Arabic phrase meaning ""Praise to God.""  
  
**As-Salāmu `Alaykum** is an Arabic greeting often used by Muslims around the world. It literally means what is close to ""Peace be upon you,"" but is considered the equivalent to ""hello"" or ""good day"" in English.  
  
**AstaghfirAllah** is an Arabic phrase meaning “I seek forgiveness from God.”  
  
**A`udhubillah** is an Arabic phrase meaning “I seek refuge in God.”  
  
**Ayah**: literally means “a sign.” A verse of the Holy Quran.

I've taken a history course on Islam, and I loved every moment of it, especially learning of the Islamic historical acts of charity and tolerance.  

The Mogul Empire was an fascinating study! While most Islamic high courts allowed a wide array of individuals, the Mogul's let in even certain strains of Atheists.  

Some of my favorite figures, besides the very wise Mohammad (Not just saying that for brownie points, everything I learned about him from the Qur'an, and Hadiths were great. :D), The legendary Akbar the Great, and his grandson, Shah Jahan, were very wise rulers.  Also the legendary traveler Ibn Battuta was an extremely interesting individual!

I've heard that there are some Islamic scholars that are arguing for including Hindu's, and Buddhists into the Islamic Brothers of the Book.  I remember only hearing one line of this, and cannot cite anything (&gt;&lt;;). Talk about tolerance, and looking to grow as a religion.  

Oh man, I could go on.  Religiously, Islam is one of the most refined that I have found.  

Personal time. :(    I've gotten into heated debates with my father about Islam.. he is a pretty radical Christian.  Thinking about my first line, about how it is easier to judge, than to understand, it pains me to talk to my father even to this day.  I've seen his eyes darken, his voice thicken on one more than one occasion.  He very literally just regurgitates what his radio pastures say.  Mind you, it wasn't just about Islam, but politics, social matters, and other general things.  I haven't even told him that I'm not a Christian... 

I strive to bring understanding and compassion to all, whether they are liberal, or conservative, religious or atheist.  To spread a bit of wisdom, to bring peace.  Only through wisdom, through peace, can we hope to understand ourselves, and others.  Through compassion, we can look across the aisle, and see not an enemy, a opponent, but to see family.

EDIT 2: my first day is finished, I just ate my second meal. Don't worry, I didn't gorge myself, I was already counting calories before starting Ramadan, so I took exactly as much as I needed for my day! I must say the hardest part was drinking, not eating.

My dad has non small cell lung cancer, and is currently undergoing chemotherapy rounds. I am so terrified and scared out of my mind and it's harder to keep it together with each day. My dad is just passed the age of 60 and has spent his life working hard for his family and has taken great care of his health and is a man of good character. He is someone I wish to be more like and I look up to him. He has not had a chance to enjoy his life and retire and do the things he loves because he has spent the last 20+ years breaking his back earning a living to put me through school and support us. It's not fair for him to be taken by this disease now. All I wish is that he get the chance to enjoy his life and retire with my mom and have that pleasure. I know so many others must be in my shoes and it's so horrible. Please make a sincere dua for my dad. I would give anything of myself to give him that chance to enjoy life he deserves. Please pray that he is one of the small percentage of people who overcome this illness. Your prayers are the most precious thing you can do for my family and myself right now.

We quickly became close friends and spent everyday together. I opened up to him about my decision to renounce my Christian upbringing. He then told me about the importance of religion and prayer in his life. 

I became very inspired by his deep Islamic faith. A few months later I got up the courage to ask him if he could show me how to pray. He explained how to make wudu and the entire process of prayer. I had a special moment during my first prayer, something I never felt before when I prayed at Church. It is hard to describe but the best I can say is that my mind was still. At that moment I felt such deep connection and bound with him. 

As a gift, he bought me my own Qur'an. I have enjoyed reading but I feel that some verses may be altered after translating to English. I visited Algeria that summer and plan to visit again this summer. After meeting so many wonderful people, I feel Islamic communities would be accepting of me.

I'm a 20 year old Muslim female. I won't go into too much detail, but my first year of college I was assaulted and raped by someone I barely knew.  It was obviously a very distressful situation for me, because at the time I had never had sex or dated anyone. Basically I believed (and still believe) in the Islamic way of waiting until marriage and maintaining chastity. 

But I've always been so worried about this because I don't know how I'd approach this with a future husband. So my question is, would you marry a girl who was raped? Would you want to know that she was raped? I've heard scholars say that you don't have to disclose that, and that it's haraam for a husband to question his wife's virginity.

I'm not torn up about it anymore. It was close to 3 years ago and I've gotten a lot of support and counseling and I've really moved on from it. But once in a while the question is raised. 

Sorry if it's a silly question but it always crosses my mind if anyone will want me after this fact, and it upsets me because like everyone else I want a good Muslim husband and I want to be able to have a special ""first time"" with him since I didn't feel like being assaulted should count as losing my chastity., "	t5_2qhbp	True

""So what?"", responds Mike. 
""Well"", Ian continues, ""If we're Christian and they're Muslims, they might not accept us into their shelter...so I think we should change our names to make sure they treat us well. I'm gonna change my name to Muhammad"".
""Eh, I think I'll just keep my name as Mike"", Mike decides.

1369296037.0	1ew4wd	Regarding terrorism and terrorists' justifications	Logical1ty	90	24	71	"**Regarding jihad and legal rules of warfare**

http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/wiki/jihad_2

The above is the basis for the following regarding the attack in the UK on the former soldier: (In other words if you don't read that link, the following won't make sense to you)

1. The verses on an eye for an eye refer to judicial sentences (death penalty for murder).
2. The British armed forces do not go around beheading people with knives in the middle of the street. This wasn't an ""eye for an eye"", which makes this, in Islamic terms, an act of transgression and a failure in the logic of the person in the video. If we want to be literal, then the only way to commit an eye for an eye would be with an air force dropping bombs from the sky. Anything else is not truly ""an eye for an eye"" and thus becomes transgression (this isn't the Islamic view of warfare, it's just the flaw in this person's ""an eye for an eye"" reasoning).
3. The verse which says to fight them as they fight you does not override *every other verse in the Qur'an*. The clear understanding, as evident in all the collected narrations above, is that you fight your enemies as they fight you without breaking Islam's other rules. You don't split apart the Qur'an into individual verses and only pick out one and act on that in a context void of all the other verses of the Qur'an. That is *stupid*.
4. Abu Bakr (ra), in the narration provided above, prohibited not just destroying inhabited places but also being cowardly. Attacking a soldier when he is not on active duty and is in his home and is unarmed is, without question, cowardly. If you question whether such an act is cowardly, you may be a coward or you lack a total understanding of what honor means. And you probably do believe in honor (as many extremists do) so you should also realize you can't abandon honor in war. The Afghan Taliban let their entire country get overrun by an invasion so they wouldn't have to turn over a Muslim guest under their protection (OBL) to non-Muslims, not just because of Islamic rules, but because of their own culture and honor code: [Pashtunwali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtunwali). So abandoning honor in any context is unacceptable by the reasoning of the ""warriors"" such people idolize. (Edit: regarding defining ""cowardly"" strictly to running away from the battlefield: this person had abandoned the battlefield by such a great distance that he was nowhere near Iraq or Afghanistan, hence he was a coward by that line of reasoning as well)
5. A clear hadith from the Book of Jihad in Sahih Muslim forbids mutilation. Killing someone and cutting up their body afterwards is mutilation. An actual beheading is where a person is executed by the act of beheading. A technical difference, but one with religious implications since mutilation is categorically forbidden and will be punished by Allah.
6. The same hadith forbids treachery. As the BBC article link elaborates, it's forbidden to break oaths/contracts unilaterally, even in times of war and this includes the trust of citizenship. A British person who objects to Britain's involvement in Iraq or Afghanistan is forbidden from reneging on their citizenship agreement and attacking civilians in Britain. They have to leave the country, renounce their citizenship, and take up the fight where it is actually taking place. The scholars saying this are from the same school of law in Islam as the Taliban and the most conservative Muslims in Asia, and this same school of thought was used in the Abbasid, Mughal, and Ottoman empires. This carries more weight than a random person off the street (or it should to a thinking person).

**Regarding coexistence with non-Muslims**

http://www.deoband.net/1/post/2008/02/tolerance-and-coexistence-with-non-muslims-in-islam.html

Allama Anwar Shah Kashmiri (ra) says: 

&gt; ""In India and in every non-Muslim majority country every Muslim is responsible as much as he can to maintain the rights of peace and freedom which Islam has allotted for common people. Obviously, to fulfill this target every Muslim has to take part in the political, economical and civil activities of his country so that with his political and economical power he can discharge the responsibility of safeguarding the rights pertaining to life, wealth and belongings of common citizens. If a Muslim is only a spectator and keeps aloof from the political and economical activities of his country then how he can discharge the duty of serving the people.""

Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani (ra) said: 

&gt; ""We as Indians are integrated and have an alliance which perpetuates in all conditions along with the differences in religions and cultures. In the same way, being different in complexions, castes, colours and heights has no impact in our mutual humanity, we all are Indians as per holding same nationality. Hence, Muslims are equally dutiful like other communities to avail the national interests and make attempts to remove any kind of harm and damage. If the inhabitants of a village do not extinguish the fire together in case it catches, then the whole village will be engulfed by the fire and all people will be badly affected. Likewise, the inhabitants of a country, whether Muslims or Hindus, Sikhs or Parsis, all are equally obligated to strain every nerve jointly to guard their country in case of national calamity. 
&gt;
&gt; This responsibility implies all and being different in religions causes no hindrance. Everyone can discharge this duty having full allegiance to their respective religions. The same collaboration is prevailing in municipal boards, councils and assemblies. Member of different religions perform their duties related to a city, a district, a state or a country. This is what called 'composite nationalism'.

Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani (ra) also said,

&gt; “If Muslims cannot form a nation with non-Muslims, if Islam does not permit it…then how was it that the Prophet formed a composite umma (nation) with the Jews?…
…The view that Islam is an inflexible religion is beyond my comprehension. To the extent that I can understand its laws, [Islam] can live together with non-Muslims in the same country; it can be at peace with them; it can enter into treaties with them; as well as into commercial transactions, partnerships, tenancy, the exchange of gifts, loans, trusts, etc. Muslims can interact with them, participate in matters of joy and grief, and dine with them…”

If you don't know who these men are, look them up. Sir Muhammad Iqbal (the poet who thought up the idea of Pakistan) said there wasn't anyone like Allama Anwar Shah Kashmiri (ra) in the past 500 years of Islam. Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani (ra) was from the same school/group as he and struggled against the British for Indian independence, check their Wiki pages or Google for more. There isn't a member of the Taliban or any Islamist group in Asia who wouldn't say ""rahmatallah alayhi"" after the mention of their names, even whilst they might disobey them.

According to Abu Sa'd (radiAllahu anhu), the Prophet [](/pbuh) once rebuked the wife of Sarwan ibn al-Mu'attal for being over-zealous to the detriment of her marriage. She used to read long suras during her night prayer, keeping her husband waiting, and she fasted frequently without his permission, which made her tired and prevented any opportunity for enjoying sexual relations during the day. The Prophet recommended that she limit her recitation to one surah and only fasted with her husbands permission so that they could enjoy each other. Similarly, when the Prophet [](/pbuh) heard that a zealous Companion, Abdullah ibn 'Amr (radiAllahu anhu), was in the habit of praying all night and fasting all day, he told him to moderate his devotions, pointing out that “your eye has a right over you, your guests have a right over you, and you wife has a right over you (in this case sexually)' (Bukhari)

**Foreplay**

The Prophet [](/pbuh) said ""None of you should fall upon his wife like an animal; let there first be a messenger between you.""

The Sahaba (radiAllahu anhum) then asked ""And what is that oh messenger of Allah?""

He [](/pbuh) replied: ""Kisses and loving words"" (i.e. foreplay) (Daylami)

**Orgasm of a woman**

""Three things are counted inadequacies in a man. Firstly, meeting someone he would like to get to know, and taking leave of him before learning his full name. Secondly, rebuffing the generosity that another shows to him. And thirdly, going to his wife and having intercourse with her before talking to her and gaining her intimacy, and satisfying his need from her before she has satisfied her need from him."" (Daylami)

And Ibn Qudamah and Al Ghazzali (rahimahumullah) are of the opinion that it is *mustahabb* (recommended) for a man, if he climaxed before his wife, to continue to stimulate his wife until she also climaxes, out of love for her. And this is possible by continued coitus since the man does not lose his erection immediately after orgasm for some minutes. And if this is not enough he may stimulate her by hand or mouth. 

**Reward**

Narrated in Muslim, the Prophet [](/pbuh) said: ""In the sexual act of each of you there is a sadaqa.""

The Sahaba (radiAllahu anhum) replied: ""Oh Messenger of God! When one of us fulfils his sexual desire, will he really be given a reward for that?""

The Prophet [](/pbuh) replied, ""Don’t you think that were one to act upon this desire unlawfully, he would be sinning? Likewise, if he fulfils this desire lawfully he will be rewarded."" (Muslim)

Having intercourse on the night before Friday is desirable as the Prophet [](/pbuh) said,

""Whoever makes ghusl on Friday to clean himself from janabah (i.e. after having intercourse), then left for salah, it is as if he offered a whole camel in sacrifice."" (Bukhari)

**Multiple Times**

Narrated in Muslim, the Prophet [](/pbuh) said, ""If one of you has intercourse with your wife and then wants to come to her again, it is better for you to do wudhu first, for it revives you with more vigor to go again."" (Muslim)"	t5_2qhbp	True

I think she handled it beautifully.	soapywaterandbubbles	84	21	43	"This his HER story, not mine. She posted it on FB and I am changing names of the church and the person who asked her to leave. I just wanted to see what anyone thought of her experience.


""Today I went to First Baptist Church of _________ to volunteer. They were having a feed the homeless event and I signed up to help as a student from Iota Kappa Chi which is the nursing club at ________ College. After serving food to several people, the person in charge, a woman named 'Linda', came up to me and told me she had to ask me to leave and that I am not allowed to help out. I asked 'why not?' And she says because they are a Christian church and therefore cant allow ""someone like me"" to be there and help out. I told her it was not as if I was imposing my beliefs on anyone, I just wanted to help feed the homeless but she wouldn't have it. I was completely speechless and did not know what to since I haven't dealt with such Islamophobia especially being completely alone and not knowing anyone at the church. So with tears in my eyes, I went outside and headed towards my car.
I was going to leave but then I realized I did not have to accept being treated with such intolerance from anyone. Who was that lady to tell me to leave just because I'm a Muslim. So I wipe away my tears and walked back into the church. I asked another lady who was in charge and she pointed to 'Linda', the lady who kicked me out. So Linda comes over and I asked her why wasn't I allowed to help. She just repeated what she said previously. I asked how do she know any of the other students from ______ were Christian? How did she know they weren't atheist or something? That's when she revealed her true reason for kicking me out. She said ""if you were dressed in normal street clothes, we wouldn't have a problem with you but we can't have here dressed like that."" I said ""but these are my normal street clothes. This is how I dress everyday. It is a part of my beliefs."" She kicked me out because I looked like a Muslim. She then said ""well your beliefs are completely different than ours."" At this point I realized how ignorant of Islam Linda really was. I told her our religions were really similar, that we both believe in God and Jesus. She then said the most ignorant thing ever. She said ""No, the Jesus and God you believe in are different than the ones we believe in."" I told her If someone wanted to help Jesus with something, I'm sure he wouldn't reject them just because they not christian. She agreed but still wouldn't let me help. I realized how ignorant she was of her own religion so I couldn't blame her for being ignorant of Islam. So I told her I wanted speak to whoever was in charge of the church. She told me the pastor was in charge but he wasn't there today so I asked for his contact information. She went and got me the church's business card and I left.
It is 2013 and I live in Southern California which is one of the most diverse places in the US so I never thought I would the be recipient of such tolerance, especially from people who claim to be followers of Prophet Jesus. I don't care if a place does have a right to kick out anyone. I would have gladly left if I was being disruptive or disrespectful but I was simply kicked out because I wear a hijab (headscarf). After controlling my emotions, I realized this is an education opportunity. May Allah is testing me to see how i react. How I handle this situation. I can't sit back and have people be ignorant and intolerant of Muslims for no apparent reason. I thought about what I should do. I visited the church's website and since tomorrow is Sunday, they will be having a service. I am going to go there and see if I can talk to the pastor. If the pastor can make things right then Alhamdulillah, but if not then further action will be taken. I'm writing this experience just to make everyone aware of how intolerant people are even though we are in 2013. Experiences like these just make me proud to be a Muslim and make me stronger because it motivates me to stand up for what's right. I make dua that Allah makes something positive come out of this."""	t5_2qhbp	True

Wasalmolaqum warahmatalah whobarakatu, Fellow brothers and sisters, from an 18 year old man who used to smoke weed, cigarettes, drink alcohol, sell drugs, please learn from my mistakes. You are so blessed to have found Islam at a young age, and Islam in general.

I used to make more money selling drugs in a month than the average person did in 2 years. I was buying take-out food everyday, smoking as much as i wanted, getting all the girls, and bought a beautiful car, 

but there was one thing that I could not buy, it was happiness. It was the calmness in my heart i was missing, it was the most important thing because i thought the money was there to make me happy. I was wrong.

As i have converted to the most beautiful religion, the most truest religion in the world, Islam, and reading the most sacred writings of allah, sent by  muhammad sallah wa allayhum wasallam, I became a changed man, there is no denying I am a changed mans, 

these are only some ways islam has changed my life, keep in mind their is a lot more change, and brothers and sisters, there are changes that are so amazing, that it is unwritable, i cannot speak about it.

- I have found new friends who are there to make fun, in a halal way, to go play cards, to sit down and tell stories, make a campfire and some smoke there argilla (flavored tobacco), some drink shay(tea) its a wonderful environment.

- I have become a much nicer, appreciating person

- I have more patience than i could have thought i ever have

- I do not judge people in any sense, and I am nice to all people, muslim and non-muslim

- I help out as many people as i can, and go out of my way to bless somebody in the smallest or biggets manner

- I am more relaxed

- I go to school, and I am doing extremely well

- Girls are my friends now, I do not look at every girl i see and think (o if only i can ______) I talk to them as i talk to boys.

- My mother and father are proud of me

- i am proud of myself, proud of whom ive  become, although I am not proud of my past, and what i did I am happy because it has created, moulded the person I have become.

Another thing I have come to realise is that of course islam helps the inner peace, I have came to realization that in every culture, in eveyr society, in every religion there is some people that will be good, good at the heart, and some people who are bad. even though there are some muslim i see who like to stare, and who give dirty looks and are mean people, there are the NICEST muslim who are wonderful, appreciate, understanding, Just like there are kafirin who are the same, (good and bad)

I'm a 20 year old practicing Muslim. I was born Muslim and went to Sunday/Arabic school for years. I don't know much about Islam but I do know enough to tell right from wrong. I was put into Arabic/Deen school growing up (once a week for a few years), although I've never really had the urge to pick up a Qur'an and read and UNDERSTAND it up until now. 

 About two or three years ago I had a friend who was a devout Atheist. He always would talk about how science disproved Allah (SWT) and me, with my limited knowledge of Islam at the time, really had nothing to say. Eventually, I myself declared that I was an Atheist for a short period of time. About a year or so later I took shahada again but not because I truly believed in God, but because that's what was expected of me. Only a handful of people knew that I had become an Atheist. 

Recently I've become more curious about the religion and have been active in the community and praying 5 times a day etc. 

Anyway, I was reading Surat 'Ali 'Imran and it states in 3:90 ""Indeed, those who reject the message after their belief and then increase in disbelief - never will their [claimed] repentance be accepted, and they are the ones astray."" This has truly shaken me on the inside. Is that it for me? If someone can shed some light here, that would be great!

On the other hand, women were given the right to vote in the United States of America in 1920. 	h4qq	96	34	171	"A very small glimpse at the lives of a few notable female scholars in Islamic history: 

‎""Amra bint Abdurrahman was one of the greatest scholars among the second generation of early Muslims. She was a jurist, a mufti (gives legal opinions,) and a hadith (Prophet’s sayings tradition) scholar in the time of Ummayyad Caliph Umar ibn Abdul Aziz, who encouraged Muslims to learn with her. 

Aisha bint Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqass was a jurist and scholar who taught the famous Muslim man jurist Imam Malik, the founder of the Maliki juristic school. 

Sayyida Nafisa, the Prophet’s great granddaughter, daughter of Al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib, was a teacher of Islamic jurisprudence whose students traveled from faraway places to learn with her. One of her students was Imam Shafi’i, another great founder of the Shafi’i school of law. She actually financially supported him as well. 

Another Muslim woman scholar who taught famous Muslim men scholars was Aisha bint Muhammad ibn Abdel Hadi in Damascus; she possessed the shortest chain of narration back to the prophet of any other scholar alive in her time. She taught Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, the greatest latter-day Hadith scholars. 

Umm Darda was a female scholar who taught at the great Ummayyad mosque in Damascus as well as in Jerusalem; one of her students was Caliph Abdul Malik ibn Marwan himself. A 12th century woman, Shuhadah bint Ahmad al-Ibrii studied in Baghdad with the latest scholars and became herself a great scholar of hadith and jurist. She was known as “the pride of women.”

1329135026.0	pndri	I don't mean to offend anybody, but I think Muslims should be more open to criticism about their religion and lifestyle. Without criticism we as both a culture and individuals become more isolated from the truth and rule the possibility of improvement	secular_humanist	101	36	197	"Before downvoting me, please read what I have to say carefully. I am neither a Muslim or an atheist. My belief is that individuals and cultures should be more open to criticism; internal and external. It seems to me lately that Muslims get very defensive when their faith or the prophet becomes questioned.

Without criticism, it is impossible for age old institutions to change. We must have open debate about morality: What is right and what is wrong and WHY. Let us for example look at Hindu society. If Hinduism was insulated from criticism (from the West and from Islam), the age old caste system would still be rigidly in place. The practice of sati (bride burning) would also be active. When faced with criticism, many Hindu reformers fought to end the practice. Sati is currently non existent in Hindu society, but there are still pockets of casteism (which is declining).

If Islam continues to remain insulated from criticism, it would be impossible for Islamic society to modernize. 

I know this criticism will in itself come off as harsh to some people, but I do not wish to cause offense. I wish to open civil discussion."	t5_2qhbp	True

""Olajuwon has had great success in the Houston real estate market, with his estimated profits exceeding $100 million.

""Olajuwon was still recognized as one of the league's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month), which occurred during virtually every season of his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.""

1336648110.0	tgb1g	Does Saudi Arabia represent Islam?	balqisfromkuwait	80	15	194	"* Saudi Arabia implements an [interest rate of 2%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/saudi-arabia/interest-rate) in it's banks. Islam forbids interest/usury and Qur'anic attitudes towards interest are:  
  
&gt;That they took riba, though they were forbidden and that they devoured men's substance wrongfully – We have prepared for those among men who reject faith **a grievous punishment**. **[4:161**  
&gt;**Those who consume interest** cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except **as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity**. That is because they say, ""Trade is [just] like interest."" But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah . But whoever returns to [dealing in interest or usury] - **those are the companions of the Fire**; they will abide eternally therein. **[2:275]**  
  
The Prophet also said:  
&gt;Jabir said that Muhammad cursed the accepter of usury and its payer, and one who records it, and the two witnesses, and he said: They are all equal. *[Sahih Muslim, Book 010, Number 3881]*
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
* Saudi Arabia does not permit any religion other than Islam to be practiced. On the other hand, Islam guarantees freedom of religion:  
  
&gt;Let there be **no compulsion in religion**: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in God has grasped the most sure hand-hold, that never breaks. And God is Hearing, Knowing. **[2:256]**  
&gt;This is a reminder, so **let he who wishes** take a path to his Lord. **[73:19]**  
&gt;And if your Lord had pleased, surely all those who are in the earth would have believed, all of them; **will you then force men** till they become believers? **[10:99]**  
&gt;We know best what they say, and **you are not one to compel them**; therefore remind by means of The Quran who fears My warning. **[50:45]**  
&gt;You shall **invite** to the path of your Lord with **wisdom and kind words**, and debate with them **in the best possible manner**. Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best who are the guided ones. **[16:125]**  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
* A recent AMA featured a Saudi Arabian former child-bride who was forced into a marriage, and this was legal by Saudi Arabian standards. However, Islam is against forced marriages as the Qur'an says:  
  
&gt;O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit the women by **forcibly/unwillingly**... **[4:19]**  
&gt;And if you divorce the women, and they have reached their required interim period, then **do not prevent/hinder them that they marry their partners** if they **mutually agree** between themselves in a kind/equitable manner... **[2:232]**  
&gt;And the divorced women shall wait for three menstruation periods; and it is not lawful for them to conceal what God has created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the Last Day. And their husbands would then have just cause to return together, **if they both wish to reconcile**... **[2:228]**  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
* A while ago in Saudi Arabia, a man divorced his wife on the radio granting him immediate divorce. However this is in blatant contradiction of the Qur'an, which says:  
  
&gt;For those who are discontent with their wives, **let them wait for four months**. If they reconcile, then God is Forgiving, Merciful. And if they insist on the divorce, then God is Hearer, Knowledgeable. **[2:226-227]**  
&gt;If a couple fears separation, **you shall appoint an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family**; if they decide to reconcile, God will help them get together. God is Knower, Aware. **[4:35]**  
&gt;O you prophet, if any of you have divorced the women, then they should be divorced **while ensuring that their required interim is fulfilled, and keep count of the interim**. You shall reverence God your Lord, and do not evict the women from their homes, nor should they leave, unless they have committed a proven adultery. And these are God's limits. And anyone who transgresses God's limits has wronged his soul. You never know; perhaps God will make something come out of this.  
Once **the interim is fulfilled, you may reconcile with them equitably, or go through with the separation equitably**. You shall have two equitable witnesses witness the divorce before God. This is to enlighten those who believe in God and the Last Day. Anyone who reverences God, He will create a solution for him. **[65:1-2]**  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
* There are several Saudi Arabian women who believe it is haram for their husband to their faces. A women recently [divorced her husband of 30 years for lifting her niqab while she was sleeping](http://marebpress.net/articles.php?lang=arabic&amp;id=2682). I think it goes without saying that this is not condoned in Islam.  
  
  
Moreover, Saudi Arabia is one of the richest countries in the world yet it has a 20% poverty rate due to the fact that its 10000+ royals are stealing most of the money. If Saudi Arabia were practicing true Islam, then it would have been like in the time of the rightly-guided Caliphs, where there was a [Bayt ul-Maal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayt_al-mal) which guaranteed welfare to unemployed and disabled persons and established a poverty threshold amongst many other things.  
  
So as you can see, the government of Saudi Arabia is a dictatorship that practices a bastardized version of Islam. They are in no way ""following the correct version of Islam"". The only thing which gives them leverage over the Muslim world is the presence of Mecca and Medinah within their territory."	t5_2qhbp	True

What is your problem?		89	30	178	"I'm not going to pinpoint who and who, but when someone asks for a question on lets say marriage or premarital sex or listening to music or just whatever.. Why do you answer with your own opinion? ''Sex is just awesome. Go and do it!'' or ''Go marry some atheists! God doesn't mind your spouse!'' or ''There is nothing wrong with some alcohol once in a while!''

You think these people don't know that? A person asks about a perspective or advice on something and an non-muslim person strolls along as if they were asked about their opinion. Of course we know that we can go have sex. Of course we know we can marry non-muslims. Of course we know we can go drink alcohol and smoke weed. But we don't because God has told us to. Then we ask our fellow brothers some advice on it, and some people come along as if we asked them what their opinion on it is. We don't need atheist opinions if someone is asking for muslim advice. You can give your perspective, but atleast say ''I'm an atheist/agnost/ignost/whatever but..''. 

Of course this is not pointed towards all atheists. There have been plenty kind and respectful ones. I even saw someone say ''I'm not muslim but I heard the muslim perspective on [x] is...'' which I found beautiful because it shows you do have an own opinion, but you acknowledge the OP is asking about a Muslim perspective. 

Also if you're not a muslim, please don't represent Islam *if you haven't heard a scholarly opinion on it*. I remember someone else asking about Islam and a non muslim came forward saying ''Well I know Islam's perspective is...'' even though his ''perspective'' was **definitely** wrong.

You are free to participate in other discussions and give your views and such, but don't claim to have Islam's view when you clearly don't, and don't give your opinion on something when the OP is clearly asking for Islamic advice. if you want to argue it out with someone on the thread self, that's okay. But don't make a directly reply to the thread. Make a reply to the comment you have a problem with. Or make a reply saying ''I know Islam says x, but I disagree because of y.'' Don't start talking as if you are representing the Islamic advice. We know we can get ex-muslim/atheist/buddhist advice too, but we're asking for a Fatwa by an Islamic scholar.

I also believe there is no god but God and that Mohammed is the seal of the prophets.  Some tell me that makes me a muslim already.  But the following things (among others) keep me from going to a masjid, etc:

1) Denying that Quran-alone Muslims are Muslims.  My understanding is that Abu-Bakr, Omar, etc forbade the documenting and cataloging of hadiths.  Why are these two caliphs considered Muslims and those who reject ahadith not?  I like some of the ahadith, but frankly, some are just vile.  And I'm keeping my pubes and my armpit hair, thanks.  If ahadith are secondary, and the Qur'an is complete and fully detailed, why do a lot of Muslims not like the ""Quraniyoon""?

2) Sunnah: yes, tradition is important and it does have weight in terms of supporting the idea that this is always the way it was done.  But it isn't infallible.  As someone who comes from the Christian tradition and who read the ""church fathers"" and can see the dynamic nature of church theology and praxis in tradition, this seems comparable to the concept of sunnah.  It is a good reference, but the claim that ""this is how Muslims have always prayed, so this must be how the prophet taught us to pray"" seems questionable.

3) Culture: I'm not going to pepper my conversations with ""inshallah"" and ""alhamdulillah"".  It is annoying enough when my Christian friends throw in ""praise the lord"" and ""halleluyah"" for good measure.  If I want to say ""God willing"" I'll just say ""God willing.""  I'm not growing a beard.  I'm married to a feisty, argumentative Italian woman and I like her that way.  I'm not going to make her abide by Arabic social conventions for women because our relationship works better when she doesn't.  We make our best decisions as a family from heated discussions between her and I, not when she is submissive.

4) Sunni vs. Shi'a: Honestly, it seems to come down to a very old political dispute.  I think the differences in traditions came after the disagreement on who should lead and people quit talking to each other, and not before.  Were I to convert, this is an issue I'd avoid altogether, and frankly, as someone who lives in a secular democracy (unless, God forbid, Santorum is elected), it seems to be an irrelevant question about whether or not someone is Sunni or not.

While maybe some will be offended at how I've addressed or phrased these concerns, I'm just trying to type them as fast as I can before the kids start waking up.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on these 3 things I've mentioned as stumbling blocks for me converting to Islam.  Thanks!"	t5_2qhbp	True

I made a couple posts a long time ago, and during that time I had been practicing Islam, although admittedly rather half-way.  This past two days though, I had something happen that sort of shocked me into reality.  

Yesterday, I had my car stolen right out of my apartment's parking lot.  They smashed a window, managed to find a spare key hid under my car, and took ol' Daisy out for a joy ride sometime in the middle of the night.  After I did the police report and all that jazz, I had to miss work because I didn't have a ride so I stayed home and watched the news for the US election results.  During this time, I did many things I am very not proud of in order to quell my nerves.  I smoked a cigarette, I had some liquor, and enjoyed (if you'll call it that) the companionship of nude internet women.  All of these things were intended to relax me and make me feel better about losing my car, but afterwards I realized nothing I did really made me feel better.  To be honest, it just made me feel worse.  Then after just sort of stewing in my emotions, I decided to peruse Reddit.  I ended up here on r/islam and started reading all the posts and stories and info, and found that I felt so much better after reading and learning more about Islam and Allah.  

Cut to earlier today.  My car was located up in midtown, alhamdulilah. First thing I did when my car's broken window spot was taped up was head to the masjid and formally take my shahadah.  No more joking around, no more halfway working.  It just really hit me how when I was stressed beyond belief, the only thing that could calm me was thoughts of Allah and reading of the Qur'an.  It was a major wake-up call, and here I am today.  The world is beautiful, I have a new lease on life, and my black trashbag temporary window matches my car's color scheme!  Jazakum Allahu khair, my friends, for reading all this way!  May you all have a good day!

P.S.  If it would at all be possible would you, my dear brothers and sisters, mind to please make dua for the young man that the police caught with my car?  I found a bracelet of his in the car and it was a bracelet with a help phone number for children in foster homes.  I'm afraid he might be a troubled young man that is really in need of some help, and I would so very much appreciate it if you could all join me in asking Allah to make this  boy's life easier and set him upon a proper path.

1342667598.0	wsqlw	Someone who never liked Islam or the Qur'an here was just deeply moved to chills by reading Thomas Cleary's new translation of Surah 81! I felt the hand of Allah and see that we do worship the same great God of the universe! Hello fellow lovers of God - from a Christian		75	15	38	"From The Qur'an: A New Translation by Thomas Cleary

Sura 81: The Rolling Up

In the name of God, the Benevolent, the Merciful

When the sun is rolled up

and when the stars fall lusterless

and when the mountains are blown away

and when the pregnant camels are neglected

and when the wild beasts are herded

and when the oceans are flooded

and when the souls are matched

and when the infant girl who was buried is asked

for what offense she was killed;



And when the pages are opened,

and when the sky is stripped

and when the blaze is fired up

and when the garden is drawn near

each soul will know what it has brought about.



Yes, I swear by the planets that recede,

run, and disappear,

and the night as it darkens

and the dawn as it breaks

that this is the word of a noble messenger,

endowed with power, his rank established in the presence of the Lord of the Throne

obeyed and faithful there.


So your companion is not insane --

he saw him on the clear horizon.

And he isn't grudging with the unseen;

and this isn't the word of an accursed devil.

So where are you going?



This is a message to all peoples,

for any of you who want to be upright.


But you won't want to unless it is the will of God, Lord of the universe.


Wow! Now that's what I call a real poetic translation of the Qur'an - gives you chills ... I saw for the first time reading this that Islam does worship the one true God. I have lots of other translations over the years, including the Oxford one, but they never spoke to me like this. This is beautiful poetry!

I explained that I wasn't a muslim and that this was my first time at a mosque and he totally took me under his wing.

Then for the recitation, they invited me to stand with them and the guy I met first leaned over and smiled and said ""just do what we do."" So I did.

I had no idea what was being said but it was very cool to be in that room with everybody. Afterwards I met the Imam and he seemed like a really nice guy.

By all means don't stop doing them, this is what reddit is for, but please bear this in mind:

Honestly, do you think a true knowledgeable scholar of Islam would be mildly interested in reddit? One look at the front page they would probably be, ""this is time-wasting, and there is a lot of things here that may lead into sinful things."" they would probably stay far away from reddit. They may know or not know about the existence of r/islam. But they would probably stay away from reddit anyway. They have other priorities.

r/islam is for for people like you and me, your ordinary, average, next-door Muslim. There is only what, 4000+ readers, how many of that are genuine accounts? how many of that are Muslims? and how many proportion of that has a decent knowledge of Islam? If you want knowledge of Islam, try harder than just reddit or google. Meet real people.

I personally come here to check out any interesting links &amp; articles. Or to get to know other Muslims or non-Muslims who are genuinely interested about Islam and Muslims. Reddit is addictive. But most of the time, I am here just to get 'amused'. I mean they have cats and all. But I put a conscious effort not to come here everyday.

Overall, for a small sub-reddit. I have to say that It's a pretty accurate representation of your average Muslims-Next-Door. If anything, you guys have been great. Supportive, calm, insightful, and as a random collection of people, Sunni, Shia, or others, we are generally speaking, United. Alhamdulillah. 

A reminder, to not get too worked up with the trolls or haters you see here. Log Off. Make real connections to your neighbors, classmates, workmates, your community. Muslims, trust me,  you will find that Non-Muslims, this includes Atheists, are much friendlier in real-life. They are less-defensive once they realize you are not trying to convert them and just want to have normal conversation about the weather or sports, etc. Every time someone claim to represent atheists, Christians, etc. I think of the real Atheists &amp; Christians I know personally. And I know a lot of them. It will help you form a more accurate perspective. After all, no one likes to be stereotyped.

Very interesting names, like bismillah, like mashallah. And this was totally normal for them, cause those were their names.
    
The teacher comes in the first day of class, he's taking role call, and he gets to one of the brothers from this village. He asks him his name and the brother answers ""Inshallah"". (In Arab cultures, if you answer a question with ""inshallah"", it basically means ""I'll tell you in a while"").

Confused, the teacher asks him his name again , the student answers again, ""Inshallah"", since this was his name.

The teacher gets very irritated, and says ""I'm asking you, what is your name!"" the student answers again, firmly ""Inshallah!""

Frustrated, the teacher remarks ""la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah"". Another student from the village raises his hand and says ""Present!""

This joke was taken from the 7th video in a [Lecture Series of the Tafsir of Surah Kahf by Yasir Qadhi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZxc42QNctUjlpxyXdb4Ylusj2rAjtkM)."	t5_2qhbp	True

there are some kinds of delusions of grandeur associated with his trolling. He doesn't want to be convinced of any truth, he just wants you to be ""butthurt."" 

just my opinion, but this is what I think you all should do:

1. if you see comment you want to respond to and you don't know the username, click their name and view their comment history. This guy makes accounts less than 2 weeks old and writes multiple comments per day despite his negative karma rating. Negative karma means you can only post every 10 minutes, but he often does it every 10 minutes on the minute. Either he has no job like he says or this is his job. 

2. if he looks like a troll, sounds like a troll, acts like a troll, *Do not respond!* His stated intention is not to resolve differences of thought, it is simply to sow discord and fitna. Just click the report button and move on. "	t5_2qhbp	True

I've listend to many scholars, students of knowledge and daee's of the ""salafi"" ideology/background.  I respect them and appreciate them.  They have taught me a lot and helped me a lot.

I also listen to non-Salafi scholars too.  I respect them and appreciate them too.  They also have taught me a lot and helped me a lot.

BUT

There is a problem in our ummah. From Pakistan to Mali.  From Indonesia to America.  Extremists exists.  Extremists Muslims who probably would not hesitate to kill us all because we don't follow their way.

Al-Qaeda and other extremists have a lot in common with Salafis.  In fact some could argue they are salafis.  They all listen and follow the same scholars.  They all love Ibn Taymiyah and quoting him.  They all love Al-Aqida Al-Wasitiyah.  They all love to hate on non-Salafis especially the Sufi and Shia.

To me the only difference between the extremist Al-Qaeda like Muslim and the Salafi Muslims is that the extremist will actually kill you and use violence whilst the Salafi Muslim may just verbally assault your creed and perhaps pronounce takfir.

My question to you the Salafis, yes terrorism is haram and what Osama bin Laden did is wrong, but ALL Muslims agree with that.  What about the destruction of history (that happens to include sufism) in Mali?  What about Shia and Ahmadis murders in Pakistan?  What about killing of Shia in Yemen?  What about the desecration of sufi graves and masaajid in Libya?  What about the desecration and destruction of historical Islamic sites in Madinah and Makkah?  What about the treatment women wherever Salafis are present?  What about the women scholars within the Salafi community?  What about the Salafi Islamic universities for women?  Why are the sources of the extremists Muslims source by Salafi scholars (Abdullah Azzam, Anwar Al Awlaki, ibn Uthaymeen on suicide bombing)?  Isn't the human life sacred no matter their belief?  Isn't being a mercy to humanity more important?

Maybe this is all one big test for the entire Muslim ummah.  Allah knows best.

I don't know how many of you caught this, but there's been a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uwogo/to_muslims_on_fittit/) on /r/fitness about how to maintain a healthy diet and a workout regimen in Ramadan. Since we all have a habit to binge on the samosa and baklava during the holy month, the advice on the post is a great reminder of how being healthy allows you to concentrate both on the spirit of the religion as well as your physical well-being. Though this post is primarily geared to weightlifting Muslims, all of us should consider some form of exercise during the month. Just to summarize a few key points (and adding from some of my own knowledge):

**Motivation:**

* Fasting does not slow down metabolism. You do not experience strength loss in of itself (i.e. muscle catabolism) from fasting intermittently during the month. Any decrease in productivity is purely psychological. [Here's a list of battles muslims fought/trained for during Ramadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_fought_during_Ramadan_by_Muslims). If they could march, charge, swing weapons while fasting, you should be able to pick up a few weights for an hour in an air conditioned room. No excuses.

* An undisciplined Ramadan regimen will undoubtedly lead to a decrease in strength and gain in fat, blowing away all the hard work you put in the previous months and making you work harder post-Ramadan to get it all back. Or on the flip side, you can use the time and focus afforded to you in the month to make yourself progress further towards your goals.

* A LOT of people who aren't muslims train fasted a couple of times a week as this boosts your muscle growth afterwards. Here's an [article](http://www.leangains.com/2009/12/fasted-training-boosts-muscle-growth.html) explaining why.

**The Plan:**

* **Workouts:** Don't be taken by the myth that working out while fasting leads to muscle deterioration. Three times a week, hit the weights 1-2 hours before iftaar. This allows you to work out then have a post-workout meal right after. Since you can't drink water, keep the number of reps to a minimum. Do fewer exercises and aim for compound movements to get the most out of them. Increase rest between sets. Avoid cardio. Training in the nights is also possible, but it has some disadvantages given the limited time we have in the nights in summer, especially in non-equatorial regions. [Please see Azeenab's comment below for a more detailed plan](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/uxtft/post_on_staying_healthy_in_ramadan_on_rfitness/c4zy8ng)

* **Diet:** Post-workout is iftaar. Have a nice meal focused on carbs and protein. Pasta's great and don't be afraid of fatty meats. In general, since you have such a small feeding window this summery Ramadan, eat clean calorie dense foods as often as you can (eg every 1-2 hours you're awake and don't be afraid of midnight snacking). General diet rules apply: Avoid sugars, fried stuff, sodas and don't forget the veggies! Use a calorie logger and don't aim for a large calorie deficit or a massive surplus. Maintain. Suhoor meals should be like iftaar but with more fat since it takes longer to digest. Oatmeal and eggs are great as is Casein protein if you're into supplementation.

* **Water:** At least a gallon (~4 liters) during the nights.

* **Rest:** A primary driver of your motivation and muscle recovery is good sleep. Sleep for a few hours before suhoor if you can and after fajr (before work). Nap during the day (esp. pre-workout) if you get the chance.

**Friendly reminder: Moderation in all things:**

Remember, the purpose of Ramadan is to allow ourselves to focus inwards and make our relationship with Allah closer. Though working out may be considered a form of ibadah, it should certainly not become the focus of the month. Cheat on your workouts and diet if it means spending some time with the family. Spend a few nights in qiyam. Grab that amazing samosa mom makes every now and then; And lets come out of this Ramadan feeling rejuvenated in mind, body and soul. "	t5_2qhbp	True

1308008637.0	hyxwt	Being Gay, Muslim, and asking r/islam for advice...	ThrowawayMuslimAcct	69	12	253	"I am so scared just even typing this. I was going to crosspost this with r/lgbt, but I think I know what most of the non-Muslim perspectives are on this issue. And I wish I knew how to reach scholars like Hamza Yusuf or Tariq Ramadan - but I'm hoping at least some of the more knowledgable of Islam in this subreddit reads this.

First, let me point out I'm not here to say homosexuality is permissible in Islam. And, reading some of the comments that have come up in this subreddit in the past about this topic, it is good to see that most of you don't blame the individual. That is, it's good to see there is a distinction between urges and action.

So let me start by telling you a bit about myself. I'm in my 30's and I'm born and raised in the Western Hemisphere. In keeping with my faith I try and pray 5 times a day, I fast during Ramadan, I give money to the poor, and I don't eat pork or drink alcohol. And, since I have never been married, I have never had sex. Man or woman. Not even kissing.

You might ask how, if I've never had sex, do I know I'm gay? I can't believe I'm using this wording but, it's a lot like how one can know they are straight before ever having sex. And, to quote Dan Savage (creator of the ""It Gets Better Project""), sexual orientation isn't just about who you want to have sex with - it's about who you want to fall in love with.

I've known I've been gay for quite a while. In fact, during my teens (just before graduating high school) and again in my twenties (just before graduating university), I was hospitalized for trying to kill myself. My parents (to this day) think that was about just being depressed - but what it really was about was me struggling with my sexuality.

Even getting treatment for this depression was tough because my parents don't believe Allah created mental health issues. My parents have consistently chosen to make a dua instead of accepting a mental health diagnosis or the validity of any medication a psychiatrist or psychologist would prescribe. 

Because of this, I've never really talked about my sexuality when in therapy. Such opportunities were sporadic (and sometimes had to be done in secret from my parents) and I feared they would put a stop to it if they heard I was talking about being gay. To this day they don't know.

Instead, what I've tried to do is seek religious help on the issue of my sexuality. I've tried working on this for many years. I've prayed about it, fasted about it, went on ummrah, asked a friend to pray about it when they went to Mecca, I've stayed in a state of wudu whenever possible, I've devoted myself considerably to charity work and service, and I've abstained from pornography for quite some time now.

Yet, all this has done is actually shown me that my attraction to the same sex is more than just sexual. I would love to have a partner in life, I would love to have someone who is the first person I see when I wake up and the last person I see before I sleep. I would love to cuddle, hold hands, and even kiss. I just want that to be a guy.

I've thought about also just getting married to a girl - if only to fulfill my obligation to honor my parents. But I've decided against it because it would be dishonest to whatever woman would be caught up in this. And, even without sex, I'd probably end up being as distant to my wife as if she were my biological sister. That is: I wouldn't even want to see her naked or share a bed with her. 

The reason I'm writing all this is because I don't know what to do next. For much of my late 20s, as I was coming to terms with my sexuality, I figured I could just be single for the rest of my life. But, especially of late, the thought of being Forever Alone in this life is starting to take it's toll. I'm getting depressed again like I used to, it's hard to work, and many days (when I can get away with it) I don't even get out of bed.

The reason for this long wall of text (sorry) is because I wanted to ask these questions:

* Praying the gay away and praying the sadness away doesn't seem to be working. I know if I go to a registered psychologist or psychiatrist, they won't see being gay or even seeking a same-sex relationship as wrong. So what am I supposed to do? Is my only option to keep praying things will change?

* Part of the reason I wanted to kill myself when I was younger is because I thought it better to take my own life while I hadn't committed any grave sins yet instead of living my life with the risk I may commit the sin of a homosexual act. In Islam, which is worse: Acting on a homosexual act? Or killing oneself to prevent it? What about going to an Islamic country where they offer the death penalty on being gay and asking for a ruling against myself?

* I know some scholars say that one can still be Muslim and do wrong deeds. Islam doesn't excommunicate based on deeds. But much of the literature I read suggests acting on homosexual desires nullifies all the good you've done in this world and guarantees you a spot in hell. Can one be Muslim and be in a committed gay relationship and have even the slightest chance of going to heaven?

* Finally, among my Muslim friends who are straight but who have cheated on their wives, some point out that some sexual acts (while a sin) do not count as zina (a grave sin). Is this true? That is could I try and fulfill my emotional desires to be in a committed relationship and perhaps have some form of physical intimacy that, while a sin, does not count for a grave sin worthy of death or guaranteed hellfire?

I should point out to the moderators that I am not suicidal now nor do I have any plans to kill myself. Thanks for taking the time to read all this.

*edit: I'm going to try and respond to as many comments as I can before I step away from the computer (it's late at night here). I can't thank you enough for the kindness you've shown here. I was genuinely concerned that many comments would be calling me a kufr or something. Insha'Allah, anything I don't read or respond to tonight I will get to tomorrow.*

*edit 2: Wow - didn't expect so many responses. Thank you for the level of kindness you all have shown. I also received a few comments and private messages from people asking/suggesting why I don't simply stop believing in Islam. I respect those who are atheists and it's hard for me to explain why I continue to be a Muslim. The best way I can put it is this: the only thing I am more certain about than my sexuality is my faith. I came to this subreddit because I am looking for guidance on how to preserve that faith despite this difficulty. But I take no offense to anyone who suggests I do otherwise. In fact I appreciate that you took the time to write or comment.*

*edit 3: Been spending what seems almost the entire day reading and responding to comments. Thank you again for the kindness you've shown. I know this isn't the kind of topic this subreddit likes to discuss because it often devolves into arguments about why homosexual acts should (or are) permissible in Islam. Please know I respect the fact it is not my place to make what is haram into halal. And I really do appreciate all the advice I've received from the Muslims and non-Muslims in this subreddit. I will keep an eye for new comments but am stepping away from the computer again.*

*edit 4: Thank you for everyone who is still leaving comments and replying. It means a lot. Going through more comments right now. I, of course, won't object if you want to downvote this and/or take it off the front page on r/islam.*"	t5_2qhbp	True

about a year or two into the conversion i started having little doubts about islam.  this mainly came from reading hadith.  i went through a tough period.  i would ask a lot of questions, and this made the SO angry.  not because he wsa angry that i was questioning religion, but because he saw me slowly becoming not as religious and that scared him.


we tried to work through this, but i think eventually he could not take it, and he left me. 


i was devastated when he left because i thought this was the man i was going to marry.  we'd shared everything together.  we had grown up together in many ways. 4  yeaqrs was a long time.  i had devoted my life to him and was 100% committed to him, not to mention loving him like nothing else.  but i took his leaving me for real.  about two weeks later, i had a very big and important event.  i wanted to look nice for it, and i did not want to wear the hijab.  and i had only ever worn it because the SO wanted me to.  so i took it off. because i thought, he was gone, he doesn't want to be with me, why should i restrict myself?  i also felt like it was a lie to wear it if my intention was not there


for some reason i thought he would not be mad.  he had left me after all. but when he found out about it, he was mad beyond belief.  he told me i should be ashamed of myself.  he hated me for it.  my Muslim friends that saw me that day, similarly, gave me the most awful looks.  it was like i had betrayed them all.  it made me so mad in many ways because, i dont know why so many people wrapped up the whole of being a Muslim in someone wearing a scarf.  they do not know if i pray, they do not know what is in my heart.  why is it so important to everyone?  more than other things?  more than the more important things?


anyway after reading his letter, i felt like absolute crap.  i regreetted going wihtout the scarf.  i felt terrible.  i have always loved life but i am going through a hard time and this really pushed me over the edge.  i have not eaten in days and have lost abotu 10 pounds.  well, the not eating was just a result of feeling terrible in general but the letter made it worse.   i have not gotten out of bed.  i am just in so much pain and i want to end my life.  i can not get over this misery.


is what ive done so wrong?  is there any person who understands this?  


EDIT:  thanks for the massive support.  this thread and the responses made me feel much better.  the SO called me last night and apologized for the message and explained that he was not angry he was jus thurt thinking i had moved on without him.  i had guessed as much.  him and i talked and i feel so much better.  i can deal with him leaving, but i could not deal with him leaving on bad terms.

Today I saw very frightening things posted by Conservatives on Facebook about Muslims. It seems the ""ground zero mosque"" imam gave a speech discussing integration of sharia practices in Europe and this apparently made some of these white, Christian Americans feel so threatened that they felt it was acceptable to talk about ""cleaning their guns"" and being ""locked and loaded"" in response.

This is so unacceptable, and on Eid no less. I would cry if someone said violent things to me about Judaism during Yom Kippur or Passover, and I'm not even a practicing Jew. I have never entered a masjid, I know very little about Islam and only a small bit of Arabic, but I love you my Muslim brothers and sisters as I love my Jewish brothers and sisters and my atheist brothers and sisters and all my fellow Americans. We are all in this together. We all have families and we all worship in our own way, whether within one faith, many, or none (yes, I believe atheists also worship; Carl Sagan's writings are indescribably beautiful in many passages and show reverence to the Universe and science like those of faith show to God). 

If you are seeing these things discussed today too, I just want you to know that I support you and so do many other non-Muslims. I am terrified that something like Japanese internment will happen in America again, but this time toward a religion, not a nationality. I will do my small part to prevent that however I can. I will challenge these people wherever I see them. I am not afraid of them. If they want to make the threats of violence against me instead, bring it. My countrymen and countrywomen are NOT targets for violent hatred, they are NOT an excuse to vent the ugliest parts of a disturbed personality with impunity, and they ARE my neighbors, brothers, sisters, and friends, REGARDLESS of religion.

I will stand with any person who seeks peace and opportunity in America, period. Today and forever. To those of you reading from overseas -- we are not all like those people, the Ann Barnhardts and Herman Cains and Peter Kings of our country disgust many of us. They are less American than any Muslim I know.

Peace and love to all of you, and I am so sorry to anyone who had to see disgusting, violent comments about your faith on Eid. 

Love,
Jennifer

Not to say that I am finding myself attracted to Islam necessarily but rather that my understanding of those of faith and those drawn to religion has greatly benefited. 

In my mind there are those that want to live in a world where they are not alone, and this sensation in part, as well as others, is what draws them to the glow of religion and the holy infusion it grants life. In my mind there are also others, such as myself, that live in a faith free world, not out of insult, but out of natural disposition and an attraction to the atheistic ascetic lifestyle of hard edges and lonely winds. Perhaps my philosophy will one day change, as I'm young and one disposed to thought.

I simply want you all to know that the certitude I've seen here has let me see another way, let me see another side of life.

Imaan isn't something magical that happens overnight, people strive hard for it, and it doesn't always come easy. Ask anyone who has converted to Islam, or all muslims in fact, they didn't wake up one morning with ultimate Imaan and say this is the haqq.

No one here on reddit, no person can strengthen **your** faith, you need to go and do the ground work yourself.

The best way of strengthening your faith is to learn about the prophet, read the Quran translation, be in the company of fellow Muslims and **ask questions!!**. If you see something you dont understand know that there are people who have dedicated their lives to this religion and can help you. You will see that gradually with time your faith will grow.

Ah, I did it all nice and proper at the masjid, too. Two witnesses and everything.

So... I'm a Muslim!!

I told a friend I'd write about the experience, and I thought I'd share about the journey here. If anyone wants to skip it, that's fine. My tl;dr is here at the beginning.

Anyway, for anyone who doesn't know, I've actually been studying Islam for about three years. I began because I really don't like bigotry, and the Islamophobia seriously bugged me. I knew how big Islam was, and I knew it couldn't be like what the media was saying.

My first real exposure to it was a documentary called *Islam*. It looked at Islam's history, and at the life of the Prophet, and at the spread of the religion. It was so fascinating, and it was beautiful.

Also, on Gaia there was a thread called ""The Halal Hangout,"" run by a nice girl whose online name was Call Me Apple. I asked questions and joined the conversation. I learned a lot there.

I ended up taking an unexpected hiatus from the internet. By the time I got back to Gaia, the thread had died.

However, I'd already discovered the joys of Reddit, and I'd found /r/Islam. Believe it or not, I've posted here before, before my stream of questions flooded the first page. Here I've gotten a lot of insight... I came back, after leaving Reddit along for months, because I began to consider Islam as a path to follow and I wanted to talk to Muslims about it and learn what I could.

I have two copies of (translations of) the Quran. One is a hard copy that is given out free by the masjid I took shahada at, though I didn't get it directly from them. A friend of my ex-husband had been given it, and he wanted to throw it away. I took it instead, because I'd been wanting a copy, and I couldn't stand to let him be so disrespectful either.

My other copy is the iQuran, an app I have for my Android phone that has the original Arabic, a translation, and the option to listen to a recitation.

I am on chapter ten on the digital copy. The more I read, the more it makes sense.

Ah... I need to back up a little. See, I was raised Mormon, and because of it I ended up with a really bad view of God. He seemed petty. Selfish. Childish. I wanted nothing to do with him, so I went elsewhere to find faith. I took to Buddhism, and though I never became a ""card-carrying"" Buddhist, I considered myself a student of the teachings of the Middle Way.

As I read more about Islam, I realized that the beliefs meshed with what I believed in Buddhism. I also was finally able to see God as I'd always though he should be: omnipotent, omnipresent, and, more importantly, omnibenevolent. The realization of these things filled my soul with a bright light, and a great joy.

And that's why I've been pestering you guys so much... ♥

While I was at the masjid today, for an Intro to Islam class they have, I was explaining all these things to the teacher. (I was the only one in attendance today.) He said that, from his perspective, I was already Muslim.

Another brother was there, and he echoed the sentiment. He suggested that I go ahead and take shahada, thus giving the shaitan less of a chance to dissuade me from doing so.

And so I did.

I don't feel any differently (though I will admit that I can sense my perspective changing as I embrace Islam more), and it wasn't like it was some big to-do. Just quiet, but serious. And though my stomach was suddenly flooded with butterflies as I spoke the words, first in Arabic and then in English, I know that I did the right thing.

I now have prayer clothes and a hijab I don't know how to wear... And a nice prayer mat and an instruction booklet. And a new class to attend next Sunday. One for new Muslims.

I don't know how to do it in Arabic yet, but I thank Allah for guiding me here. And thanks to you guys here, for being so kind and helpful with all my questions."	t5_2qhbp	True

1335373171.0	srzz8	Muslims have long claimed the Bible is full of errors. The proof lies in a comparison of the Bible to the Qur'an. Let's start with an example everyone is probably familiar with...	Elliot_Loudermilk	80	24	62	"&gt; In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
&gt;
Genesis 1:1

A verse most of us are probably familiar with. However...

&gt;Professor Ellen van Wolde, a respected Old Testament scholar and author, claims the first sentence of Genesis ""in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth"" is not a true translation of the Hebrew.
&gt;
&gt;Prof Van Wolde, 54, who will present a thesis on the subject at Radboud University in The Netherlands where she studies, said she had re-analysed the original Hebrew text and placed it in the context of the Bible as a whole, and in the context of other creation stories from ancient Mesopotamia.
&gt;
&gt;**She said she eventually concluded the Hebrew verb ""bara"", which is used in the first sentence of the book of Genesis, does not mean ""to create"" but to ""spatially separate"".**
&gt;
&gt;**The first sentence should now read ""in the beginning God separated the Heaven and the Earth""**

I was madly in love with a girl when I was 12 years old. She was in my Sunday school class and she used to dot her Arabic letters on the chalkboard with smiley faces. It made my heart melt like an ice cube in a frying pan. We had so much in common. I had a Red Power Ranger bookbag and she had a Pink one. I think Allah was telling me she was my soulmate.

I had it all planned out, I was going to ma
rry this girl. I was making about $70 a week from mowing lawns, and that would be enough to support her. As long as she loved me for who I am, and was really bad at math. So one day after class I asked her if she would like to be my wife. She said no. It was probably because she couldn't handle how manly I was with my peach fuzz mustache.

I asked her maybe not now, but how about when we're older? She said ""Please, when Palestine becomes a country, then I'll marry you."" As if she was implying that's never gonna happen.

WRONG! So as soon as I heard the news that Palestine got approved by the United Nations yesterday, I was like holy crap how hilarious would it be if I contacted this girl. I was gonna email her a CNN article and below it I was going to write ""So should we tell your parents the good news first, or mine?""

But then I found out that she is already married (Ok fine, I stalked her Facebook page and went through 37 photos of her wedding album). And that made me sad, you guys. Not because I was heartbroken, that would be ridiculous. Please, I havent talked to this girl in 15 years, there's no emotional attachment there since it was so long ago.

No, I was sad cuz that woulda been such a baller marriage story. Like I'd go to dinner parties making lame small talk with other couples and they'd be like ""Yeah, so my husband and I, we met in college. How did you and your wife meet?""

And I'd be like, ""UN General Assembly Resolution Number 181. I got 138 countries to be my wingmen on it.""

I will post about that later but one thing that struck me as a big surprise is how much things are different than what we always assume they are.

Few years ago, even before my interest in Islam, I read a lot about how muslims want to convert the west (I believe the word used was infidels, to make it sound extremist I guess).

Number of times a Muslim tried to convert me: ZERO.

since I announced my interest in Islam to people around me, here in Islam's reddit in particular, I have been getting so many posts for Atheists and Christians telling me of the ""mistake"" i am making and trying to convert me back.

most troubling are the ones that suggests something wrong with me. Wait a minute now. do not dare to insult my intelligence. I have a very professional life and high education background.

something came to my mind: Why would Atheists/Christians come and comment on every post here? out of love? doubt it. care about us? maybe but the tone I read from their messages suggests otherwise.

Doesn't this sound too familiar? wanting to convert others.. calling others names and questioning their intelligence because they do not agree with you??.

Now, this is when atheists and Christians start to sound extremist. wanting to convert me, trolling Islam 'fishing'.

sick if you ask me.
I found something I am happy with.. Islam is my religion now, respect that.

This isn't the first time you've created a thread, gone to another subreddit and asked for help. You claim you want to have an honest discussion, but instead your intention is to simply flood this subreddit with views that go along with your agenda. 

Recently there was a topic on how Muslims view homosexuality, which is a fair topic (though one that has been discussed in this subreddit), [you invited people to share their own view on whether homosexuality is natural or a lifestyle](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/gq922/do_you_guys_believe_being_gay_is_something/). However that wasn't your intention. Your intention is to troll individuals in this subreddit and fill it with your arguments while downplaying the opinions of others. Instead of keeping this discussion in r/islam, you resorted to going to r/lgbt to ask them to school the subscribers of r/islam.

It makes absolutely no sense.

See: http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/gqu31/fellow_gay_members_of_reddit_i_need_your_help/

Thats classic trolling. Its disrespectful and rude on your part and basically, pretty shady. Your credibility has always been in question, but your endless efforts only add to your lack of credibility.

So, here is my request, if you are sincere about your beliefs and wish to have an open discussion on the topic, stop going to other subreddits and ""asking for help"". Its quite pathetic really.

When Islam is applied by the State, along with its punishments, we lose the fear of Allah and gain the fear of our government. Isn't that shirk?

I feel like this when I see young teens falling for each other but then meeting secretly in fear of their parents or relatives. By imposing that fear, arent the parents taking the place of Allah?

When I lived in an Islamic country, you didn't commit zina, because it could get you prison time. When I moved to a non-Muslim country, I realized you didn't commit it because of your love for Allah.

I don't want the State to tell me how to live my life, because I want to fear Allah, not my government.

Also, why does the State have to be religious, when it will not be resurrected on the judgement day.

Just a small reminder to all the Muslims here: please don't think someone can *never* accept Islam based on who they are/were.

As we look into history, we see some of the best Muslims to have ever lived come from the most astounding of backgrounds: `Umar, may God be pleased with him, for example, embraced Islam while he was on his way to *kill* the Prophet Muhammad, may peace and blessings be upon him. 

So how can we ever have doubt that someone who doesn't like Islam, who speaks against Muslims, who might be racist, who makes fun of our Prophet, may peace be upon him, who degrades our women, who doesn't even believe in God that they will accept Islam? If we asked ourselves, ""do you think Bill O'Reilly will accept Islam?"", what's the first thing that comes to our minds? What about President Bush? What about Pastor Terry Jones? I hope you all understand what I mean. 

Allah is *al-Hadi*, the Guide, and He guides whom He wills, and He does not guide the arrogant and disobedient, but those who are truthful and sincere.

May Allah guide us all :)

I love you all, my brothers and sisters, for the sake of Allah."	t5_2qhbp	True

Well, eventually, anyway. 

Ironically, even though America at large was attacked by muslim extremists; it was muslim Americans whose lives were a living hell for years back there.  Bin Laden's death, while satisfying and a relief, is indeed opening old scabs for some.

There will be some sort of backlash towards you. However it should subside quickly and shouldn't be anything like 10 years ago. With that said consider the following points when going about your daily lives in the coming days.


*Don't feed the trolls.

*Don't mind the morons who will come out of the woodworks and attack you.

*Don't pay attention to the neanderthals who will call you names and blame all of 9/11 on you. 

*You don't have to take harassment of *any* sort from *anyone.* 

*You are not responsible for what a (now dead) man did 10 years ago from 1/2 a world away.

If anyone tries to pick on you, just give them a sympathetic *""are you fucking kidding me""* rage face and carry on with yourself.

If anyone else here has anything to add please do so.

[19.17] So she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our spirit, and there appeared to her a well-made man.

[19.18] She said: Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent God, if you are one guarding (against evil).

[19.19] He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy.

[19.20] She said: When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me, nor have I been unchaste?

[19.21] He said: Even so; your Lord says: It is easy to Me: and that We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter which has been decreed.

[19.22] So she conceived him; then withdrew herself with him to a remote place.

[19.23] And the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of a palm tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died before this, and had been a thing quite forgotten!

[19.24] Then (the child) called out to her from beneath her: Grieve not, surely your Lord has made a stream to flow beneath you;

[19.25] And shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree, it will drop on you fresh ripe dates:

[19.26] So eat and drink and refresh the eye. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent God, so I shall not speak to any man today.

[19.27] And she came to her people with him, carrying him (with her). They said: O Marium! surely you have done a strange thing.

[19.28] O sister of Haroun! your father was not a bad man, nor, was your mother an unchaste woman.

[19.29] But she pointed to him. They said: How should we speak to one who was a child in the cradle?

[19.30] He said: Surely I am a servant of Allah; He has given me the Book and made me a prophet;

[19.31] And He has made me blessed wherever I may be, and He has enjoined on me prayer and poor-rate so long as I live;

[19.32] And dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me insolent, unblessed;

[19.33] And peace on me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the day I am raised to life.

Rather than a uniform and unequivocal formulation of the law **it is a scholarly discourse consisting of the opinions of religious scholars**, who argue, on the basis of the text of the Koran, the Prophetic *hadith* and the consensus of the first generations of Muslim scholars, what the law should be. Since these scholars interpreted the sources in different ways, we often find various opinions with regard to one legal issue. The jurists and the rulers developed ways to make these differences manageable for those who had to apply the law. The institution of the ‘school of jurisprudence’ (*madhhab*, plural *madhahib*), uniting legal scholars around certain legal doctrines, brought greater coherence and consistency, because the adherents of such a school were bound to follow the opinions of the school’s founding fathers. Moreover, rulers could instruct judges to adjudicate only according to opinions of one school. However, even within one law school, there are many controversies on essential legal issues. In order to organise and manage this doctrinal variety, the adherents of specific schools developed hierarchies of authority with regard to the different opinions.

I'll start.	cldhrdfacts	61	8	78	I was a little stubborn at first, or not willing to give in too easily since I knew Islam requires so much from you (e.g) 5 prayers a day, no alcohol, etc. When I found out that Muslims believe in Jesus as a messenger watching this PBS documentary randomly, something just clicked. For the longest time I didn't even know Muslims believed in Jesus. I later came across some Dr. Zakir Naik videos online which pushed me to order a copy of the Qur'an. Upon reading the Qur'an, I was immediately surprised at how similar this is to the Bible but more clear. I remembering thinking 'if there is an All-Knowing God, then surely in this Qur'an is His message'. But even then, I was still not convinced. The thought of an after-life just seems to much to bear even right now. Everyone is going return after death? This is a really hard concept to wrap around your brain even though the Qur'an refutes this when it says it easy for God since He already gave you life once. Anyways, I was still not sure Islam was the truth but I was addicted to learning as much as I can about it. Somehow again, I came across Islam channels on youtube which feature countless number of lectures on the deen. I would watch one after another every night. It was then this one particular lecture giving by Nouman Ali Khan where he strongly recommends praying. I then decided to start to learn the salah which I would say was my first real step towards becoming a Muslim. I took my time since I wanted to perfect it and then one night, I finally had it all memorized and began my first prayer. Out of nowhere, I became really sleepy about 60% into it. It was the ishaa prayer but it was still strange since it was only 10 o'clock and i usually fall asleep at around 1 or 2. I stopped the prayer and went to bed with plans to wake up early for the fajr prayer which to me sounded better for my first time praying the early prayer to start the day. As I laid in bed, I thought I still need to at least finish the whole prayer from start to end at least once. So I started reciting it. As I was reciting the prayer I felt sudden chills and fever-like symptoms throughout my whole body. It was really shocking as I didn't know what was going on. I felt my head and body getting warm but I still kept reciting. When I finished the whole prayer 4 rakats, I felt an entire flush throughout my whole body and the fever-like symptoms went away. That's when I become fully convinced Islam is the Truth. What also left me that night was my previous mindset. Ever since that night, I become a different person. I don't look at girls in a lustful way anymore. I don't look at drinking as something to make me happy. I don't think about my future in this world anymore and what I will do for happiness because I have Islam. And Islam is all you need.	t5_2qhbp	True
1344270420.0	xrsdo	For all my Muslim brothers and sisters (old and new), here are some resources.	finally_made_account	57	9	16	"As Salaam Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh,

As we all know, Islam is based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and there is no room for sects or cultural traditions that go against what we find in the Qur'an and Hadith. Consequently, as Allah [](/swt) has said in the Qur'an, He has made it easy for us to read and understand -- whether that's through tafsir (commentary), hadith, classes, etc. The point I'm trying to make is that it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to research and learn about our religion.

Following is a list of resources that have greatly helped me in better understanding Islam and increasing my knowledge, and hopefully they can do the same, if not more, for you:


* [**Online diploma courses for Islamic studies** - WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS, In-depth, authentic -- be sure to check this site out!](http://www.fanarinstitute.com/)
* [Online Qur'an with many translations](http://www.quran.com)
* [Online collection of Hadith books](http://www.sunnah.com)
* [**Online tool for calculating prayer times based on your exact GPS location** - really nice, especially for **Ramadan**](http://www.salah.com)
* [YouTube channel with large number of good educational videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/khalifahklothing)
* [Another (small) YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/qfanar)

* [Site for ""fatwas"", question/answer, etc.](http://islamqa.info/en/search)

* [Site to download Qur'an audio (Mishary) with Muhsin Khan's English translation - Br. Sabbir](http://www.sabbir.com)
* More to come as I remember...

Hopefully, this list will benefit you. If it does, at Iftar please ask Allah to forgive ~~me~~ everyone for all ~~my~~ their sins and to grant ~~me~~ us Paradise in the Hereafter. Thank you and Jazak-Allah Khair

She left her brothers house to walk to her sisters house after iftar when 3 men passed by her car and shot a bullet into her and four bullets into her husband.  Her husband is in critical care at the hospital right now, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.  Alhumdullilah the baby's life was sparred from the bullets, but she unfortunately did not make it.  She leaves behind 2 sons and a husband.

Last night she had a dream that she saw her mother crying (who had passed away 1 year ago) and this prompted her to come home, about an hour away, to visit her mothers grave this morning.  After visiting the grave in the morning, she returned back to her brothers where she completed her fast and was murdered shortly after iftar.  Words cannot express the shock I am feeling at the moment.  

May Allah [ ](/swt) grant her family Sabr during this time.  Keep this family in your prayers please.

Today, if someone claimed to be a prophet, they'd probably be laughed at.

1360692594.0	18e0nb	To believe Adam wasn't born to parents isn't to disbelieve in evolution	Logical1ty	91	44	126	"This is for Muslims regarding different views of evolution among us:

To believe Adam wasn't born to parents isn't to disbelieve in evolution, only the evolutionary origin of man.

The creation of Adam and Eve (as) in Heaven was a miraculous intervention by Allah in the natural course of events.

It is like the belief that Jesus (as) was born without a father, but in this case both parents are absent.

Evolution is a natural process which was occurring in this world from its creation and will continue until its end. Miracles are divine interventions in the natural course of events.

The most popular Sunni accounts (whose basis I am not sure of) about the first people (how Adam and Eve began to populate the Earth) also entail miraculous intervention depending on how one views those reports, though these events are more like science-fiction rather than fantasy (if you are an atheist reading about them). Rather than God creating everyone from scratch (like Adam and Eve), the belief is that Adam/Eve were different from us biologically in how they procreated (which in our understanding would describe different genetic recombination during meiosis and different gestation). Of course these accounts are from supplementary material to the Qur'anic account and are not compulsory to believe for a Muslim (whereas the Qur'anic account is and describes a clear miraculous intervention outside the scope of the natural course of events).

As for how Adam was created in Heaven, the popular account from hadith is that God created him from the dirt/clay of this world (retrieved by an angel).

&gt; Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: ""Allah created Adam from dust after He mixed the clay and left him for some time until it became sticky mud, after which Allah shaped him. After that Allah left him till it became like potter's clay. Iblis used to go past him saying 'You have been created for a great purpose.' After that Allah breathed His spirit into him. The first thing into which the spirit passed was his eye and then his nose. He sneezed. Allah said: ""May your Lord have mercy upon you, O Adam! Go to those angels and see what they would say.' So Adam went and greeted them. they replied saying: ""Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah."" Allah said: ""O Adam! This is your greeting and that of your offspring.""
&gt;
&gt; (Sahih Bukhari)

Clay is regarded as an important possible medium for abiogenesis for the beginning of life on Earth (one of several theories).

Note that this process took time and wasn't creation ex nihilo (out of nothing). Being that God isn't very arbitrary it stands to reason for whomever trusts this account that this process was important even if only in a symbolic manner (the implication here is that God repeated the process by which life on Earth likely began). The reason for that is because Adam was meant for this world from the very beginning:

&gt; And when your Lord said to the angels, ""I am going to create a deputy on the earth!"" They said, ""Will You create there one who will spread disorder on the earth and cause bloodsheds while we, along with your praises, proclaim Your purity and sanctify Your name?"" He said, ""Certainly, I know what you do not know."" And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then presented them before the angels, and said, ""Tell me their names, if you are right."" They said, 'To You belongs all purity! We have no knowledge except what You have given us. Surely, You alone are the all-knowing, all-wise."" He said, ""O Adam, tell them the names of all these."" When he told them their names, Allah said, 'Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the skies and of the earth, and that I know what you disclose and what you have been concealing. 
&gt;
&gt; (Surah 2, Verses 30 - 33)

All the classical commentators say this knowledge that Adam was given was related to the Earth (life in our material world).

As for evolution, Muslims have long since categorized life on Earth as one big family tree, and have taken this beyond plants and animals to the mineral constitution of things. This was a very common view of the world, especially among Sufis, who made 7 ontological distinctions of soul (mineral soul, vegetable soul, animal soul, personal soul, human soul, and the last two are the secret divine connection (our raw metaphysical souls)). As for how the transitions happen, only with human beings was there a miraculous intervention. Kind of like inducting us into the world with a special ceremony of sorts owing to mankind's special purpose. The rest were described through various versions of evolution depending on the scientist in question (often a mixture of LaMarckism and Darwinism). Famous names include Al-Jahiz and Ibn Khaldun. Al-Biruni even wrote about a kind of natural selection:

http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/226430?uid=3738832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101799689877

Westerners who read their works often read them literally and figured we believed humans were just like everyone else (because that part is covered in the Qur'an so it wasn't put into scientific literature).

&gt; “I have to deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe has contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the Muhammadans. Surely they cannot be much longer hidden. Injustice founded on religious rancor and national conceit cannot be perpetuated forever.” (Draper, John William. The Intellectual Development of Europe, p. 42.)
&gt;
&gt; “[Christian] theological authorities were therefore constrained to look with disfavor on any attempt to carry back the origin of the earth to an epoch indefinitely remote, and on the Muhammadan theory of evolution which declared that human beings developed over a long period of time from lower forms of life to the present condition.” “Sometimes, not without surprise, we meet the ideas with which we flatter ourselves with having originated our own times. Thus our modern doctrine of evolution and development were taught their [Muslim] schools. In fact they carried them much farther than we are disposed to do, extending them even inorganic and minerals.” (The History of the Conflict between Religion and Science, John William Draper, pp. 118, 187-188.)

This guy was from Darwin's era: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Draper

At first this doesn't seem like a huge deal, and it shouldn't be. Overall Muslims have for most of history believed in a giant family tree for life on earth, where humanity was one of the branches (since this was natural philosophy not particularly unique to Muslims, not science based on experimental method which is the change that Darwin heralded, often a teleological approach was used where it was like with each species was a step leading to us, the most advanced). Whether one believes the branch of humanity was like any other or specially put there after a ceremony to distinguish it, seems like a non-issue with respect to science and that is correct. It is a non-issue with respect to science because both camps acknowledge the same empirical evidence with the same explanations about natural processes (a theory about our origin is actually unfalsifiable because there's no evidence left of our direct ancestors, so someone can say we were planted here by aliens and who could prove that wrong?). 

But with respect to *religion*, this comes down to:

1. Belief in God.
2. Belief in the special role God made for us (as described in the Qur'an).

Denying the entire account of Adam's (as) creation is pretty much a denial of the Qur'an because it's written right there. On the other hand, trying to interpret it to mean that Adam was just some human from an existing race chosen by God to start civilization (heavily metaphorical) is less of an issue theologically, but not entirely free from problems. For one thing, that's where all this junk (from Christians as well as Muslims and others) about Darwin being Satan or inspired by Satan comes from. Why such craziness? Because if you read the story, Iblis knew from the beginning the specialness of our creation and he turned against God based on pride, spite, and jealousy. It would be the best thing possible from his point of view for us to deny such an event and instead take our place among the rest of the lowly animals of Earth, which is the sort of ""speciesism"" he was engaged in (talking about how his race was superior to those made from Earth: material life, which to this point had been plants and animals). So there is this knee-jerk reaction from some corners of the Islamic theological community where they don't look at the belief itself (regarding Adam's origin) as problematic (where they could merely say ""this is some new interpretation based on Western apologetics among Muslims""), but rather the origin of that belief as outright *satanic* (the Devil, should you believe in him, would absolutely love this doctrine since he's said from the start we're just stupid animals and sought respite from God's wrath in order to get time to prove it here).
