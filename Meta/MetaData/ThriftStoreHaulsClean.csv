Before I started working at a popular, well known thrift chain, I would buy clothes at thrift stores and wear them right off the rack. That is a horrible decision. 


In just a few months of working here, I have found dildos, used condoms, lube, poopy diapers, literal poop just chilling in bags of clothes, bags of poopy underwear, and water bottles full of pee. This is all mixed in with regular clothing.


Why do people donate these things? I'm not sure. But we're picking out nice looking clothes that have been floating around in this stuff for up to weeks at a time, throwing them on a hanger, and sending them out to you. 

Thrift stores are awesome places to find gently used clothes, but I just figured I would remind everyone to be wary and ALWAYS wash everything! Happy hunting!!"	t5_2spop	True

1356364939.0	15dloh	Prepare your bodies thriftstorehaulers, the after holiday donations are coming	DFWPhotoguy	234	33	25	"After the christmas break I often see a huge influx in great stuff at stores. Families go home, get loaded up on stuff they dont want from relatives (often vintage!) or get new gifts and need to make room (get rid of old stuff at home).

Every year some of my best finds happen the two weeks after Christmas. Thrift stores near highways always get boxes dropped off of people who left town, get their parents or relatives stuff and just drop it off before even going home. 

So keep your eyes peeled, do an extra bit of digging in pockets, books and any nooks because much of this stuff hasn't been cleaned out so you never know what you may find!

Happy Holidays you cheap bastards!

1364840390.0	1bfqxb	[UPDATE] Original xbox signed by Jet, The Offspring, 311, Smile Empty Soul - I GOT IT!	kazoodac	214	55	15	"Ok everyone! So I went back to the thrift store fully expecting [this gem](http://www.reddit.com/r/ThriftStoreHauls/comments/1bd96h/found_this_at_the_thrift_store_todaycan_anyone/) to have disappeared, but to my luck it was still there!

Now I know I offered to sell it for the price I paid plus shipping, but there was a lot more interest than I expected. I figured the fairest thing for me to do would be to [list it on eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/251254043369?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649) for the price I paid. If the price ends up covering shipping and continuing upwards, I will donate any profit I receive to the [Child's Play Charity.](http://www.childsplaycharity.org) For those who don't know, Child's Play works to bring games to children in hospitals. Awesome bunch!

Special Thanks go to ExtraNoise, NullParameter, fr0stedwalnut, mondeus, diabloarcade, Emleaux, Demogorgo, a_random_username, EnragedFetus, einbierbitte, Damoss, and DCarmen for helping my figure out who signed this piece of gaming and music history!

TL;DR: [xbox autographed by bands for sale, profits go to Child's Play!](http://www.ebay.com/itm/251254043369?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649)
