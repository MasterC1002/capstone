1374777745.0	1j1lu9	Something I noticed about a possible mission while watching the game play trailer.	Rhymes_with_relevant	461	73	54	"I haven't seen a post or comment pointing this out yet, so here it goes.

I was watching over the trailer again and when it got to the [first plan](http://i.imgur.com/7V5ttMJ.png) I wondered what the diagram was of. So, I looked at the blueprint map and it was [the docks.](http://i.imgur.com/4D98Plv.png) I think the arrows show routes going in and then an escape route, with the x's showing we can't escape over the bridges. 

I [put them together](http://i.imgur.com/yDTxhZo.jpg) to make sure.

Going by [this board](http://i.imgur.com/CsGFtB3.jpg), we can see the top right tape on the wall may say ""To Do"" and the bottom right may say ""Approach"". What most interested me was the two apparent options, A being to either sink the boat, as the A drawing implies, or B, to go in with force. Even more interesting is we saw [this, a sunken cargo ship](http://i.imgur.com/xLlLRtt.jpg), in the beginning of the trailer. The cargo ship looks similar to the one in [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/bZDEvQ6.png) on the wall, if you're able to make it out. 
 
So, I'm guessing we will need to get something from the ship, and either go in loud and attract tons of attention, or sink it somehow and dive to retrieve whatever it is we need. Then another ship eventually floats in to replace the one we sank. "	t5_2t0xk	True

Sorry, just wanted to rant a bit. If you take the time to sub to this subreddit or you're anticipating GTAV this much at least take the time to search the subreddit for similar posts and/or realize this game has to have limitations and quit setting such high expectations. You'll only end up disappointed. Wait and see what R* has in store and go into GTA V like it's a new experience and with an open mind of everything they've already included which is an absolutely shit ton!"	t5_2t0xk	True

1375403872.0	1jj79i	Features from Previous Rockstar Games	sattizahn	243	38	109	"Lately in this subreddit, there's been a lot of talk about features from previous Grand Theft Auto games that Rockstar may include within GTA V. Some people have even mentioned game play aspects from Red Dead (hunting and game trade) and other recent games that could be included within GTA V. However, as I've been waiting for GTA V, I've been replaying most of the Rockstar games within my game library, and have some ideas about some less discussed games and their contribution to the world of Grand Theft Auto! Feel free to discuss these ideas, or present you own!

**The Warriors:**
This was an interesting [2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_(video_game) game from Rockstar based upon the 1979 movie of the same name. Importantly, Rockstar wasn't necessarily satirizing American culture, but rather re-imagining the gritty gang life on Coney Island from the 1970s. It allowed players to perform smash-n-grabs on various stores, steal radios from cars and even mug individuals on the street to take their belongings. It also had a *witness system* similar to what's seen in Red Dead Redemption; eliminating a witness before he/she reached a phone booth or police officer kept your wanted level down. This witness system is supposedly implemented in some way in GTA V, as well, and it would be interesting to see muggings be a possibility, too. Plus, it let you free gang members [handcuffed/zip tied by police](http://cf.shacknews.com/shack_images/sshots/psx2/092705_warriors_1.jpg)

The Warriors, both the fantastic movie and video game, are essentially brawlers. The theme permeating both is *beat the crap out of everything*. To accommodate this, Rockstar built a great combat system that allowed players to perform strong attacks, weaker yet faster attacks, grapple moves and to interact with grapple moves. You could tackle people, pick them up, knee them, throw them through bathroom stalls, etc., etc. It was an **amazing** improvement from Rockstar's previous hand-to-hand combat seen in things like GTA III and Vice City. The warriors even allowed combinations of moves to be used, integrating physical attacks and the surrounding environment (thanks to /u/edisleado &amp; /u/GreenSpartan12 for bringing this up). For instance, your bopper from The Warriors could perform the same type of face-smash that we see Trevor performing in [this screen-cap](http://www.thegtaplace.com/images/gtav/screencaps/trailer2_017.jpg). It would be interesting to have combat in GTA V be an amalgam of the varied combat from The Warriors (and *Bully*) and the counter-system used in Grand Theft Auto IV.

The Warriors also instigated a *hiding system* that allowed players to hide from police rather than the simple ""fight or flight"" that many GTA gamers are used to. After being spotted by cops, one was able to hide in an alley, sticking to the shadows, and use objects such as bricks or bottles to lure police away (similar to the amazing [The Last of Us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us)).

Also of interesting note is that The Warriors gave players the ability to *command others*. Certain demands could be voiced into the world, telling members of your immediate gang to scatter, attack, create mayhem, etc. Given that you will be often playing as one of three characters in GTA V, I wonder if a similar yet refined system will be used to control the others characters you *are not* playing as.

**Bully:**
This [2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(video_game) video game did some interesting things related to Grand Theft Auto that I don't think many have considered. It was largely the first Rockstar game to implement *scheduling*. Things happened at certain times of the day, you decided to attend said events (classes, in young Jimmy Hopkin's case) or skip them for ""better activities."" Grand Theft Auto IV used an almost watered down version of this, allowing players in some circumstances to schedule dates, meetings, etc. that would occur sometimes *days* later within the game. I'm curious if this will be flushed out more within GTA V. Scheduling yoga classes, meetings with the psychiatrist, etc. and the ramifications that befall one of the three lead characters when they skip these meetings would be interesting.

Bully also did something else interesting: it created *events*. Given the technology at the time, it was fairly limited, but the changing of seasons allowed for Halloween and Christmas-time events. The [carnival](http://static.gamesradar.com/images/mb/GamesRadar/us/Daily/2010/09-Sept/13/Why%20we%20need%20Bully%202/Carnival--article_image.jpg) rolls into town and you can visit it, taking part in its rides and attractions. It would be interesting to see similar types of festivals pop up over Los Santos. Perhaps a game-convention in the expo center or art shows along the pier.

One of the first Rockstar games to do so, Bully's soundtrack was composed by none other than [Shawn Lee](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bully-original-soundtrack/id200694329). The soundtrack is amazing, fits the themes of the story perfectly and is just a joy to listen to. GTA V is integrating the radio approach of previous games in the series, but it is also including an original soundtrack. If GTA V's original score is half as good as Bully's, we're in for a treat!

The combat system from Bully was pulled directly from The Warriors, and for good reason. It was balanced, entertaining and overall fun. The more pubescent themes of Bully created humorous combat interactions with the world around you, as Jimmy could stuff people heads in toilets, throw them into lockers or trash cans, or even give them tortures such as rug-burns. As mentioned previously in ""The Warriors"" section of this article, GTA V would be smart to integrate these combat-world interactions, and may have already shown proof of doing so in [this screen-cap](http://www.thegtaplace.com/images/gtav/screencaps/trailer2_017.jpg).

Bully utilized a *reputation system* separate from a *wanted* system; that is, our young hero Hopkins would have his fame and relation with other factions (Jocks, Nerds, etc.) change based upon his actions within the world. Arguably, the system was a bit *on rails* and related mostly to story missions complete, but is interesting nonetheless. Could GTA V use this in a way for dealing with the police force? Could certain characters establish rapport related to how many kick-backs they're willing to float the officers? It's an interesting concept, and I appreciate /u/nathanplays for mentioning it!

Although the ""hiding"" system was quite sophomoric and more *cartoonish* given the theme of ""Bully"", GTA V is rumored to have a system allowing players to hide from the police instead of simply running from them.

Although I doubt Rockstar will allow Trevor, Michael or Franklin to ride a skateboard, Bully did include the ability to ride both a skateboard and a bicycle. As we all know, the bicycle was actually introduced previously in Rockstar's ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas."" However, the bicycle mechanics were slightly improved in Bully. And by ""slightly improved"", I mean that they limited bunny-hops from CJ's leaping over mountains to Jimmy Hopkin's leaping over cars. However, Bully did have bicycle statistis, changing performance of bicycles depending upon speed and the terrain you happened to be riding on. The refined bicycling in GTA V should be a blast!

On one last note, Rockstar does a good job at placing homages from previous games within a game's universe. In Bully, the motel is a throw-back to the rural motel that CJ is forced to frequent in the San Andreas country-side. Similarly, there was a chemistry teacher in ""Bully"" known as [""Mr. Watts.""](http://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/7/74/Bully-Teachers-Watts.png) At one point in the game, Mr. Watts all but tells you that he is cooking meth. It would be hilarious and rewarding to see Trevor in GTA V have some relation to this ""Mr. Watts""; they not only look similar in appearance, but they also both....y'know, cook meth. (and I know the old vs. HD GTAs are different universes, but ""Bully"" isn't GTA, so fingers crossed)

**Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis:**
This may seem like an uneventful entry to some, but this [underrated 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games_presents_Table_Tennis) table tennis simulator was excellent (respectful low five to /u/MadMan920 for reminding me). The most important hallmark of this game, however, wasn't necessarily the world it created or the specific features. Rather, it was the first of Rockstar's game to use the [Rockstar Advanced Game Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Advanced_Game_Engine), or ""RAGE."" This is what allows all of those working gals in [The Triangle Club](http://gta.wikia.com/The_Triangle_Club) to be so nimble. 

**Manhunt:**
This series consists of the 2003 [""Manhunt""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(video_game) and the 2007 [""Manhunt 2.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_2) As many have pointed out from the GTA V game play video, shooting a weapon create a larger red radius around players on the in-game mini map, likely showing how a player's actions can alert others. This originated from the Manhunt series. In GTA V, it would be interesting to see varying levels of awareness showing upon the map given the caliber of weapon being used and if a suppressor is used. Obviously, a suppressor (""silencer"") doesn't completely eliminate sound, but rather reduces muzzle flash and slows rotation of bullets from the barrel of a gun. It would cool if GTA V took this into consideration, but it may be *too* detailed.

Many people have also expressed interest that GTA V included a more complex stealth factor. San Andreas had a fun stealth-kill system, but GTA IV had the ""knockout punch."" **shudders** Manhunt was a largely stealth based game, so it would be interesting to see any elements tweaked and included within the world of Los Santos.

**Red Dead Series:**
The sequel to Red Dead Revolver, Red Dead Redemption not only improved this franchise but open-world gaming as we know it. The vast, seemingly unending country side was a joy to get lost in. Or get attacked by a cougar in. 

Red Dead Redemption had some very well thought-out *dynamic missions* (an appreciative nod to /u/tokerdytoke for point this out). These missions were events and experiences that occurred pseudo-randomly within the open world that integrated seamlessly into the experience of just wandering the desert. Arguably, these dynamic missions have a history within Rockstar games; GTA IV had strangers you could meet, Bully had random strangers approach you to perform tasks, the warriors allowed you to organize some low-grade thefts and even older Grand Theft Auto games had things such as ""Rampages"" that were just located within the open-world with which players were presented. Grand Theft Auto V is sure to integrate these dynamic open-world interactions, and if they're as polished as anything within a Rockstar game, we're in for a treat.

Similar to ""Bully"", Red Dead Redemption included a superb, and at times heart-wrenching [original score](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/red-dead-redemption-original/id371357204). Hearing ""Far Away"" by José González as Marston races across the countryside is by far one of the most memorable moments in recent gaming history. Hopefully the original score in GTA V allows players to have similar climactic moments.

As we've seen in Trevor's initial screenshot with a billboard for [""J's Bail Bonds""](http://i.imgur.com/ESK82.jpg), and in the recent game play video, bounty hunting is making a comeback. There has been some speculation here about how to adapt [Red Dead's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption) system to swap the lasso for something like zip-ties, but we've also heard that Michael's special ability is similar to that of Bullet time from the ""Max Payne"" series and what was used in [Red Dead Revolver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Revolver), as well. 


**Max Payne Series:**
The 3rd person shooting seen from the recent [Max Payne 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_3) has been undeniably improved and implemented in GTA V. You can [see this here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMSdISbISik). Kudos to /u/riglet for posting the video initially. This is for good reason, too. Max Payne 3 was the best 3rd person shooting game that I, personally, have ever played. The series was also the first in Rockstar's game history to use [bullet time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_time#History), of which some iteration was used in the aforementioned ""Red Dead"" series and will be used as Michael's main special ability. 

**Midnight Club Series:**
The amount of vehicle customization seen in the recent GTA V game play trailer is on par with that seen in the [Midnight Club Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Club). Many have expressed deep opinions giving vehicle handling; some expressing interest in having something *more* similar to Midnight Club, others wanting to preserve the push towards realism seen in [GTA IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV).


So what do you guys think? Did I miss anything? Or is there something else from you would like to see from Rockstar's history make it into the upcoming GTA V? Discuss below! If anyone has not played ""Bully"" or ""The Warriors"", ""Red Dead"" or any ""Max Payne"", I highly, *highly* recommend them. Great music, voice acting, story and gameplay. They're fun ways to pass the time until GTA V!"	t5_2t0xk	True

To those mourning this subreddit, don't worry! My favorite part about this subreddit is that when it's a month or two before the release date, this server will BLOW UP. Many GTA fans, 3rd person shooter fans or just general gamers are going to fill this server up. It'll be great fun. 

And after the release, oh my. Months and months of amazing footage, funny montages, mod showcases, cheat codes, meet-ups (within the game, I'm excited for it) and of course we will still have the great community this server had around this time to give this server depth.

I can't wait for this game. Check out more things below:
http://www.gtav.net/news/single.php?id=4561

Features:

    Players can invest in their character through customizing their appearance, improving their stats, owning customized vehicles, purchasing personal property, choosing their favourite weapons and vehicles and taking part in missions, jobs and activities.
    Players have the freedom to explore alone or with friends, work cooperatively to complete missions, band together to participate in activities and ambient events, or compete in traditional game modes.
    As progress is achieved through the world of GTA Online, players will be introduced to new characters, missions, rewards and such.
    A maximum of 16 players can be active at any one time as part of an online universe of hundreds of thousands competing to earn Reputation Points (RP), money and almost limitless material acquisition.
    As you speak into your headset, your GTA Online character will lip-sync broadly in time. When robbing a liquor store, AI characters will react to the urgency in your voice, stuffing money more quickly in the bag.
    The Content Creator will allow players to create and share their own missions and activities via the Social Club cloud. Other players can beat your target times and scores, then rate your mission. You can even choose which creators you want to follow and curate your favourite missions.
    The Feed, a twitter-like program, appears on screen to relay all your emails, texts and messages from Social Club.
    The world of Grand Theft Auto Online will constantly grow and change as new content is added, and at some stage GTA Online will head into new locations. Access to Grand Theft Auto Online is free with every retail copy of Grand Theft Auto V and launches on October 1st.


General:

    Your ranking will be based off of shooting, driving, parachuting and flying skills.
    People can access their data through Social Club and via their iPhones or iPads.
    There is a mode called ""passive mode"" which means you can't shoot people and they can't shoot you.
    A ""Bad Sport"" stat will be given for bad behaviour such as blowing up another player's car, and if it's done persistently you will be punished.
    if your multiplayer character at Max Payne 3 had a high level, it will be carried over to GTA: Online for more bonuses that you will unlock.
    Matchmaking is based off of ranking, so it prioritizes your friends' rankings, crewmembers' rankings and even strangers so that when you need people, you know who to get.
    GTA Online tracks who your rivals are and lets you know when they've come online so you can get some revenge on them.


Multiplayer:

    You can assemble a team from your friends list, or recruit according to specialist skills. As you rob a liquor store or perform a heist, the team member that does the job gets the cash and can choose how much to share.
    It's possible to spread the wealth by sharing cash, weapons and ammo among your team. In turn, they can 'defect' and try to steal your cash.
    You can pick up your phone to 'ring' friends in single player and invite them into your world. Your friends will be listed under 'Contacts' on your phone.
    Set up challenges and post it to the Social Club and players can try and beat your score, if they beat your score -- you give them cash.


Miscellaneous:

    You start GTA: Online arriving to Los Santos pennyless and you must complete a few missions first to get a feel of the online.
    There will be loads of property to buy at different prices, according to their views and location. You can use your in-house CCTV to spy on people at your front door, or take showers, surf the net, change clothes and watch the game's many TV channels.
    You can take out insurance and ring for a replacement car if yours gets destroyed.
    You can pay a personal mechanic to fix your cars automatically, or deliver them to any location.
    You can also check any vehicle's stats for speed, handling etc, before making your choice to purchase.
    You can watch real-time events such as police chases on your TV moments after you see them speed past your house.
    Your custom cars show as markers on the map and get impounded if you leave them too long. You can pay to retrieve them.
    You will be able to deposit your money into your bank account as often as you can. When another player kills you, they can snatch the wallet right from your dead body.
    You can switch between single player and online mode by selecting your multiplayer avatar from the character wheel.
    If you're fleeing from another player, you can call up a buddy to hide your radar blip.
    Passengers will be able to change the in-car radio.
    You will have contacts available at anytime that will provide different services on or off mission, as you rank higher you will have access to characters with new and stronger abilities. Examples of such are being hidden from the radar and setting a bounty on another player if you're being chased.
    If you steal a vehicle, you can spray and change the plates. Some vehicle customisation businesses might not be willing to do that and you may get a wanted level.
    Weasel News will pick up people that have got wanted levels.
    There is a planning room in people's apartments.
    If you are in a heist and need some help, you can invite your friends and they will be teleported to you instantly.
    The experience is seamless between transitions for free-roam and missions.
    You can call up a private security firm to bring in an airstrike, i.e. destroy street races.

This isn't an observation/speculation specific thread (well, I didn't have to point that out since it's obviously too early but I'd like to just clear out any confusion if one would think this is)

Also, is there any IRC/chatroom? It would add up the hype. The GTAForums/GTANet IRC is pretty much in silence right now though, maybe people will chat there once the trailers are about to premiere.

Nonetheless we could post our reactions and pretty much whatever we have to say after watching the trailers here.

A lot of subscribers began to think we were overwhelmed, and we weren't taking care of the subreddit. This is just a quick post to let you guys know of the steps being taken to keep this place in order.

---

**Image Hosts**

It has now been made so that the only accepted image hosting websites are:

-minus.com - [Click here](http://minus.com)

-imgur.com - [Click here](http://imgur.com)

Image posts which do not use these hosting sites are automatically removed by a bot. This is to help reduce the amount of image links which may go to smaller sites and become overwhelmed, sites which are not particularly user friendly, and of course spam links. Imgur &amp; Minus have both proven to be very reliable and popular throughout Reddit, and so we've chosen to simplify things and keep it to those two.

---

**Spoiler tags**

Information on how to use spoiler tags is in the side-bar. This is just a reminder that we are now very close the the release of GTAV, and so please respect other members of the community and control your use of spoilers. If you really must post a spoiler, use the tags and make it as clear as possible. Thanks.

---
**Lost Posts**

If your post doesn't show up there is a good chance it has simply been caught in the spam filter. Just message the mods (Compose a new message and address it to /r/grandtheftautov) and we will take care of it.

---

**New Moderators**

Firstly, I'd like to thank our new moderator /u/Pharnaces_II, for joining us. Basically being a complete badass and blitzing the mod queue and introducing us to the auto moderator bot.

We have recently adopted the use of /u/automoderator to help minimize the work load. We've had lots of interest from people wishing to be moderators, however please remember...if you are willing to help moderate this subreddit it means you **will** be exposed to GTAV spoilers, it is not avoidable. For that reason I'm thinking it would be a good idea to have a few moderators who are not interested in V. This would enable them to see spoilers and not care so much.

At the moment it looks like the moderating team will be perfectly fine managing the content here, but we'd like to thank people for offering to help out and as we near release...I'm not denying the possibility that we may need more mods soon. We're just going to see how things play out for the moment.

Thanks. All suggestions are welcome, and hey...

**39 DAYS!!!**

**Edit** Test for spoiler tags on mobile devices:

[If you can see this without hovering over it - your app does not support spoiler tags. Please comment with details of the app you're using. Thanks.](/spoiler)

**Edit 2 - One last thing**

Please remember, we are the moderators and of course we do what we need to to keep this place a nice community, however it is also your part to use the upvote &amp; downvote arrows as required, too. We could remove everything we don't like...but this isn't Nazi Germany. It is up to you guys to define that grey area using the up/down arrows, and of course if you see something inappropriate, use the report button.

Thanks again."	t5_2t0xk	True
1369072244.0	1epfyr	Let's talk the possibilities of Prison in GTA V	Blind_3	163	23	54	"Hello everyone,

I just had a thought about the possibilities of one of the characters getting locked up and having a set of missions inside the prison managing an escape.

Most open world games don't dare keep the player confined in a prison environment as some players would lose interest in continuing to play.

However with the multiple protagonists it could work very well, you can have Trevor get locked up and have his set of missions inside the prison getting a crew to help him escape. Then you have Franklin and Michael on the outside with their own set of missions organizing getaway vehicles and gear for the prison escape, it could work the same way as planning heists.

Hell they could even base a multiplayer mode around this concept. One or a small group of players inside the prison with a set of objectives that assist their team mates outside who can either storm the prison or find a way in and the players on the opposite team will be the guards/police defending the prison. The outside team members have to break in and escort the prisoners to safety whilst the other team tries to stop them.

Anyway I'm getting ahead of myself here, it probably would never happen in the game and is probably a ridiculous concept, but it might be a fun discussion while we are waiting for September 17th.

**TL;DR** Prison escapes could work with multiple protagonists."	t5_2t0xk	True

Rules:
-5+ players start out a distance away from airport.   
 Ex. 3rd Island GTA IV

-All players start out on foot. Players then find a car and race to the airport.

-Last person to make it to a helicopter or plane is the hitman.

-The hitman does anything necessary to kill all the other players. Other players cannot use weapons to kill the hitman, but can use them to either shoot the hitman's vehicle or other vehicles to avoid him.

-Once the hitman kills a player, that player becomes the hitman.  Soon there will be one player and multiple hitmen.

-If a player some how kills himself while running from the hitman, he is automatically a hitman

1359146732.0	179y2k	I think V should have more positive/neutral/non violent ways to interact with the NPCs	TheOnlyWayToBeSure	149	18	42	"Let me explain. I decided to play IV the other day without the HUD or radar, and to just walk around like a normal guy. I would avoid violence at all costs, only use my friends to get cars, and never use a weapon unless it was absolutely necessary (and even then no more than a pistol).

If you've never played IV like this, you should definitely try it out. But after a while I started noticing that it's really difficult to be involved in the GTA world without being violent. It got to the point of, oh well I made it to the shore, oh look some hobos, I guess I'll go.....walk past them? Oh look a guy sitting on the bench smoking a cigar, seems like a cool guy, too bad I can't sit down with him. 

It's just a shame because NPC interactions in IV are actually quite good, but not as many people notice as they should because they're always running and gunning. 

For example, I accidentally bumped into a lady and made her drop her cup on my way to a diner to eat and get some health, and trying to play the part of a normal guy I picked up her cup and threw it back towards her, missing and hitting a passing taxi. A cop walking near by noticed and started chasing after me so I just ran off down the street to the diner. I ate and noticed that an NPC inside was talking crap to me and when I moved closer he started throwing punches so I left and he followed after. Another guy outside joined in on trying to hit me and I happened to pass another cop who noticed the guys and began shooting at them, killing them both but not before one of them pulled a shotgun. 

Long story short, NPC interactions are awesomely detailed, too bad we can't do more with it. "	t5_2t0xk	True

i thought of a few ideas that could work

one hideout could be this trashy downtown apartment building where you enter and you find out these guys are making some serious cash off the production of cocaine. and the gun fight begins. you clear out all the enemies and destroy all the equipment that produces the cocaine. 

another could be a group of crazy kooks in the neck of the woods shooting at you. you're walking around the woods and you see a dead body nearby. you check it out and some seriously crazy dude jumps out from behind a tree and starts running towards you. then he pulls out a gun and opens fire on you.
once the guy's dead. a whole herd of these crazies run out from a couple cabins nearby and also open fire on you. 

and another one could be where you are walking around the city and  some guy runs up to you saying that gets deep with the mafia and they're hunting him down. just after he finishes talking, a black car with a couple groups of mafia members take him out in front of you.
thinking you're with the guy, they try to take you out as well. a firefight ensues and your job is to clear out one of their hideouts.



these 3 were just off the top of my head.

what about you guys?

any ideas that could work for gang hideouts in GTAV?

When the police show up i watch them shoot it out from the sidelines. Then i finish off the loser and take on the winner.

GTA VC: I loved car surfing drive bys. Hop onto the roof of some pedestrian's car and shoot at people on the sidewalk. This wasn't possible in IV, the person in the vehicle would either exit the vehicle, or you would fall off the roof due to the improved physics. It would be nice if you could sneak onto someones pickup truck thats heading into balla turf and pull a surprise drive by.

&gt; 10 Teams of 2 players

&gt; Each team spawns in a completely random position/situation

&gt; No indicators as to PC's or NPC's

&gt; Only a basic 'Enemy Player in your line of sight' indicator and the ability to silently 'Tag and lock' characters you suspect of being PC's.

&gt; No respawns.

Last team/team member alive wins.

Sweet jesus imagine how tense this would be...

EDIT: ALSO, a couple of things I forgot to add.

&gt; Police still react to actions as normal, so killing an NPC may lead to a 1-2 Star rating. All other players would be able to see the 'Police ring' on the map, identifying where 'shit just went down', for want of another phrase.

EDIT 2:

&gt; To keep things a little more interesting - Every player is equipped with a ""POLICE SCANNER"", and every time a crime is commited and witnessed by any NPC (from speeding or running a red light, to a stolen car or a hit and run) an indicator is shown on the map as to the location of the crime and the direction the assailant fled.  

These games could easily last a couple of hours, and finally gives players an excuse to act like a 'citizen' of a GTA game, walking around shops, driving around the cities trying to keep in with the flow of traffic and stop lights.

Don't look at me like that. You all do it.

EDIT 3:

&gt; One of the best suggestions so far to keep things interesting;

When you kill an apposing player, or eliminate an apposing team, the positions of all remaining players last positions at the time of the kill show up very briefly on your map. This promotes killing and makes camping dangerous."	t5_2t0xk	True

SDBred619	150	30	262	"The details of GTA V is still slowly filtering through the web, today we serve to better understand some of the dynamics within the game and some of the characters. At the moment there are confirmed by Rockstar, but some come from as reliable sources like Famitsu own.

* The special abilities of each character can be activated with the L3.

* Franklin starts at the bottom on the ladder of crime, restoring cars for Armenian 'crappy' named Simeon Yetaria.

* ATMs can be used to check the balance of the protagonists.

* You can pick up hitchhikers on the streets and then leave them in their ideal destination.

* Playing as Michael - The ATMs can be stolen with a minigame, if we want.

* Internet cafes have been removed. Now you can navigate (even in social networks from the game) and watch videos on the mobile phone of our character.

* You will be able to drill a gas tank, drive the car into a group of enemies, then run and catch the trail to blow the car into the air.

* Hundreds of accessories available to customize your pet.

* Your dog can die or lose. You can buy a new pet in a pet stores spread over Los Santos.

* You can hunt the animals and sell the meat obtained factories or farms. (which are bought by Burger Shot)

* You can leave your car parked on the street, but if you put the ticket, the crane can take him. But you can recover in the warehouse prior municipal payment if you want to lose after having invested your money in editing.

* There are underwater exploration missions. They are considered by Rockstar as a game ""apart"".

(Screenshot in Description)	TheKRAMNELLA	138	24	160	"Spotted this in the gameplay trailer and I haven't seen this pointed out yet, so here I am to do it! Anyways, there appears to be a military base or prison of some kind in the background at about 2:30 when Trevor is fleeing the cops. 

Here is a link to a screenshot I made real quick:
http://imgur.com/a/weLLE

I think it looks more like a prison, but I know some of you guys probably have higher hopes :D. 

P.S. food for thought: At the very least, what if this was the complex out in the distance that many previews reported as a military base-like structure? They did spot it while parachuting, and I would imagine they could easily be confused (assuming it is not a MB).

Through the events we can reward custom flairs, things like XP, or whatever else Rockstar includes.  

Regarding the crew emblems, we are currently in need of some good artists to help out. So if you have experience in making Rockstar Social Club Crews emblems, please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGrandTheftAutoV).

Gang fights, Muggings, car jacking, purse snatching, pick pocketing, murders, bar fights... 

I would like to see that going on, have a darker side to the city, maybe can run the guy down and ""save the day""...

See police chase and arrest people, pull people over and go through the whole thing

Too many times in GTA 4 do i see a fat cop running after some guy, i help out and join the pursuit, push the guy down for the cop, then im getting a gun pointed at me and I’m getting arrested.. WTF cop...

What if you could link your own personal smartphone to your console by downloading an app that you launch as you play the game. Then as you would normally receive a call in-game, it 'rings' or 'texts' directly to your phone. The app could launch and look like the on-screen phone and you could use it to communicate with NPCs, apply cheats, and begin multiplayer mode. Essentially it's being used exactly like the on-screen phone, it's just your own phone. It wouldn't really have any functional advantage, just adding another layer of immersion.

Also, in the future, as voice recognition gets better and better, you could actually speak with your NPCs and have conversations with them. 

I'm not a wizard, and I admittedly don't understand if or how this would work, but I think it could be pretty damn cool. What do you think? How else could your phone be utilized?



edit: Also, this wouldn't have to be a mandatory thing- if, say, you didn't open the app, you would just use the standard, on-screen phone."	t5_2t0xk	True

It could be kind of like the comedy shows or cabarets in GTA IV— as you progress into the story new cutscenes are available there should the player care to drop by for a visit. Not only is there some great potential for comedy, but it'd also provide a ton of character development: among the best aspects of The Sopranos were the scenes between Tony and Dr. Melfy, and I'm definitely not the first to detect some Sopranos influences in Michael and his family.

It seems like a great way to add an optional layer to the narrative— I really hope all the scenes of the therapist we've seen don't just come from a single early cutscene (this may be the case considering a line in one of the trailers where the shrink implies Michael should see someone else).

If we don't get flairs for the crews then we could get flairs for platforms, like Xbox, PS3, PC if it releases there. If we start one now that would be a good way for everyone who was on this subreddit before it Skyrim'd (by that I mean grew in subs by like 10000000) to stay together. What do you think?

Okay, I've made a crew (http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/reddit_crew_1), if need be we can always have a mod create a crew and ditch this one. We'll see where it goes from here. I set it to Open Enrollment so I guess that means you can just join.

I loved these games to death and still play them both from time to time. But I would love to see GTAV go somewhere new and explore an environment it never has before.  
  
The idea of it being in a Washington style city really excites me. I'd love to see them explore the world of political corruption and the mega-rich. We all know that GTAV is going to be incredible, they seem to have nailed the sandbox formula and I'd like to see them do something new and exciting with that formula and take us somewhere we've never seen in a game of this calibre before.  
  
I know a lot of people were disappointed with GTAIV for being too boring and not having enough to do but R* did say that with the new engine and new platforms they wanted to start from scratch. I fully expect for GTAV to be a similar jump in terms of quality as GTA:VC was to GTA3.  
  
I'd love to see something new though personally. I don't want a strictly Washington based game but I'd love to see a game that focuses on the mega-rich. Previous games have touched on it but only for a few missions or so. Maybe a corrupt mayor or something but nothing ever substantial. Nothing that ever made you stop and think.

I'm honestly pretty okay with this but I'm hoping they decide to take it a bit further. I imagine it would be pretty cool if you were to acquire a wanted star or two and if you were to be arrested (which honestly doesn't happen often) you could optionally sit through the car ride while cuffed and on the way to the nearest police station have the option to somehow escape. With the character switching mechanic it would be possible to switch to another player and intercept your previous player who was arrested. From here you could cut off the cop car and take care of them quickly while grabbing your other player from the cop car and escaping the scene to lose your heat. Now this may not always seem very appealing but considering how rare it is to be arrested and to have this ""breaking your buddy out"" option I think it would add a TON of excitement.

**Q:** Can I use a golf club for melee combat?

**A:** yes

**Q:** Do we see CJ from GTA SA at all?

**A:** He is not a official Character but there might be an older man you meet named carl.

**Q:** Explain every sensitive detail about GtaV that you think the public does not know

**A:** Do you remember the transition from San Andreas to GTA IV it was big wasnt it. thats how GTAV will be. but alot larger.

**Q:** When is GTA V expected to be released (internally)?

**A:** No date has ever been spoken at Rockstar. we dont even know. **(In his previous thread he said they don't know a date but this year anyway)**

**Q:** He said shit we don't know. Not shit people already know. Tell us something that HASN'T been leaked.

**A:** Anyone here like gun modifications? 3 different gun classes now with 12 in each class

**Q:** Ok, better question. tell me the coolest thing you could tell me without risking your ass seriously. come on. tell us something fucking cool and exciting.

**A:** Trains, Jets, Golfing/carts, Segways, 6 Different knifes, Burglary, Mugging, Car Jacking is your choice (you can change the way you jack a car in the menus), Murder is very real.

**Q:** Alright, how big is the map gonna be in GTA V?

**A:** City Plus everything else in the world from top to bottom on foot it takes close to 3 Hours. Also thats if you are walking not running.

**Q:** Better yet. How closely does it resemble the San Andreas Los Santos

**A:** Nothing can compare the style is way more modern. you can kill teenagers.

**Q:** Are they going to fix the shit fall damage that was in IV? is the game going to be more like SA or IV? the answer will decide whether I buy It or not.

**A:** Its fixed, much more realistic

**Q:** I'm a nintendofag, but I think CJ is one of the coolest video game characters and I wanna see him in 5...

**A:** Travel to the local convenience Store and take a look.

**Q:** are there more buildings and places inside that you can enter and can you but your own apartments ike in sa

**A:** You own your own houses. buy, sell

**A:** One character and its one of the three in the robbery scene.

**Q:** why didn't you make the new GTA in London instead of fucking gay ass San Andreas 2.0

**A:** London Was a terrible idea we laughed about it. L.A. had more promise. We are redoing every City. Starting with IV

I figured there are 75 screenshots in total so if we really focus on one every day then the game may be released by the time we get through them all (end of March) or at the very least it will be a way to kill time while waiting for new trailers/ information. 

Here's my favourite screenshot to get things started: http://i.imgur.com/ON6bZ.jpg

What I noticed:

1) Man jogging in the background
- I think he's jogging as his left arm is raised horizontally and he's wearing tacky clothing (similar to the people jogging near the beach in trailer 1) which I think illustrates that we'll have a wide variety of NPC's doing a lot of different things unlike GTAIV where they pretty much just walked around and occasionally carried things

2) Draw distance
- In other screenshots it seems at large distances they will use fog to negate the need to render things far away. In this screenshot however everything is visible and they didn't use this fog trick (only clouds in the distance)

3) Vehicle variety
- People have complained that in previous games you will get in a car and suddenly the same car is being rendered everywhere all around you. In this screenshot we have a bicycle, motorbike, jeep, audi, taxi, SUV and sports cars

4) Reflection in car rear view mirror
- The car furthest to the left, you will notice a reflection of what appears to be the beach in the mirror. I initially thought this screenshot was more in the heart of the city due to the tall buildings near the back but perhaps Michael is close to the beach here.

And that's all I've got. Feel free to discuss or add other things you've noticed.

I seem to recall reading somewhere that NPC's cars can break down, I think it would be great to see a truck winching them, orange lights flashing, and driving off to a repair garage or something. The player could also use them to steal cars for missions, just for fun or to keep themselves while keeping them in perfect condition, I think it would be great. I would also like to see random NPC crashes where these guys turn up to take the smashed up car(s) away, along with the police, ambulance, and fire engine depending on severity.

Pointless fantasising really, since it's too late to add anything like this if they haven't already. Do you guys think this would be a good idea? Would you like to see any more emergency services or something similar?"	t5_2t0xk	True

So after calculating the pre-orders from VGCharts.

Grand Theft Auto V

Grand Theft Auto V pre-orders on the Xbox 360: 380,481
Grand Theft Auto V pre-orders on the PS3: 336,123

Total: 716,604 pre-orders.

---------------

Call Of Duty: Ghosts

Call Of Duty: Ghosts pre-orders on the Xbox 360: 156,773
Call Of Duty: Ghosts pre-orders on the PS3: 90,825
Call Of Duty: Ghosts pre-orders on the PS4: 41,627
Call Of Duty: Ghosts pre-orders on the Xbox One: 34,741

Total: 323,966

---------------

Open World Ubisoft Games

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag pre-orders on the Xbox 360: 46,637
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag pre-orders on the PS3: 33,259
(I couldn't find the Next-Gen pre-orders, as they were off the top 40 spots, which is under 25,327 pre-orders)

Watch_Dogs pre-orders on the PS4: 45,102
(I again couldn't find any other version, due to them being under 25,327 pre-orders)

Total: 124,998 + 177,289 for the 7 versions that were under 25,327, 7*25,327 (302,287 open world Ubisoft Games pre-ordered)



Total pre-orders for Grand Theft Auto V on the Xbox 360 and PS3: 716,604
Total pre-orders for all open world Ubisoft Games and CoD: Ghosts on all platforms: 626,253

So what this tells us is.
GTAV on the 360 and PS3 alone has more pre-orders than CoD: Ghosts, AC4, and Watch_Dogs do on all platforms combined.

This is an idea of my own and holds no actual weight in what could be in GTA 5, but I thought I'd just explain it and see what people thought. 

I was thinking that it would be cool if instead of changing the overall difficulty of the game, you could change police intelligence. For instance, in San Andreas, cops really aren't that smart. If you only get one star, they leave you alone sometimes as quickly as ten seconds. Even if you kill people, it's relatively easy to evade the police. In my idea, that could be the dumbest the police would be. 

On the other end of the spectrum, you could have police officers somewhat like what we have in the real world. For example, if you kill someone, they actually take the time to try to find you over the course of a few in-game days. I was thinking that you could even see information they think they have on you; things like a composite sketch based on any witness accounts, where you were last seen (they already do this in San Andreas), what you were wearing, known associates, etc...

This level of police intelligence would obviously change the entire game, where everything you did would have to be on an incredibly discreet level. It kind of reminded me of the insane difficulty in Fallout: New Vegas where you have to drink and eat to survive. Obviously that difficulty and style isn't for everyone, but it would be the hardest version with increments back down to the police intelligence we've known from GTA.

Let me know what you think, and any ideas you have about this!

EDIT: Keep in mind that I don't think this should be how GTA should always play. It'd just be a fun difficulty level if you felt like playing it, otherwise you could continue being heinous criminals, killing thousands in Los Santos with little to no consequence. "	t5_2t0xk	True

I'm talking about holding them at gun point while you have a 5 star wanted level. You know how you could do only two things while having a wanted level which is shoot at the cops and have a police chase this would make things at lot more intense, you would be surrounded within minutes (that's if your wanted star level was at a one first it would instantaneously jump up to a five) police guns will be drawn but would not fire unless you killed the hostage of course. Helicopters above swirling would have a spotlight on you, Weazel News pulling up would add a nice touch. To make things a bit more nail biting you could be shot at by a sniper on a roof if you stay at one place for a long time the pedestrian could put up a fight or bail.

I noticed in GTA IV after setting some cars on fire and calling the firemen, they don't do anything, they just come and leave. Would be cool if they would extinguish fires. Also, I'd like to see random homes/buildings catching fire sometimes and seeing couple of fire trucks battling the blaze and then after a few days you can see the house getting rebuilt. 

Also, with police, I see an officer running after someone, I tackle him and hit him and I get a star... It would be cool if the officer said thank you or something. Also, like radnom fires, random crimes, you see someone breaking in a car/home, you can call the police and look as the apprehend the criminal.

Little things like that make the game for me and I'd like to see many more than just these 2 I mentioned. It would give the game an infinite play time and it could last for ages.

Could the information have been legit? This list was compiled by user CarLuver69.

* Mountain ranges cannot be passed, however they can be scaled almost to the very top. GTA V is ""landlocked"" just like RDR. 
* Los Santos is the only major city in the game. However, this doesn't mean there isn't a lot to explore; Los Santos is ~50% larger than Liberty City, with a handful of smaller cities and towns beyond the countryside. One of the larger non-LS cities is based on San Bernardino, another is Tucson, both are about the size of Alderney.
* The world is definitely not going to be too small for people's tastes; Expect to see snow, deserts, and much more.
* The city of Los Santos alone is larger than GTA IV combined.
Los Santos is the largest and most important city. Unlike San Andreas, players will not be moving from one city to the next, doing missions restricted to that specific location. They will be structured in a way that's unlike what has been done in any previous Grand Theft Auto game.
* There are at least two cities apart from Los Santos which are the size of Alderney; They do not share a border with Los Santos or each other.
* The Italian Mafia will not be making an appearance this time around.
* Los Santos alone is the same size as III era San Andreas.
* The mountain ranges extend above the maximum altitude for player-controlled planes, therefore making it impossible to fly over them.
* Los Santos alone will feature three airports (more are outside of the city), with the world itself being more than twice the size of RDR.
* Ammunation will be making a return, however it is inaccessible; The use of underground arms dealers will be used instead. Shooting ranges will now make a reappearance as well, with the minigame being revamped and much more fun.

* Every plane shown in the trailer (excluding the commercial passenger jets) is pilotable. No big planes (ex. AT-400) will be present.
* NPC Passenger jets fly higher than the vertical limit of planes piloted by the player.
* There are 5 counties in the game, with Los Santos being the largest of them all. Overall, Los Santos is 1/3 of the entire map, with the map being over twice the size of RDR; This can be compared to New Austin and Neuvo Paraiso being one huge city, paved end to end.
* Bowling will be making a return, which will also be tied into a few missions. 
* ""ENEMA"" is a designer clothes label in the game, with the real-life equivalent being MANGO.
* Seasons change in-game, with the main story taking place over the course of more than a year.
* Safehouses will not be customizable, however they can be customized to spawn with different cars, helicopters, boats, and planes.
* Weapons will be customizable.
* Car customization will be making a return.
* Character clothing can be changed, but the overall appearance of the character can not be changed. There will be more than three clothing stores to choose from, however it is not a major component of the storyline and therefore optional.

* The ability to drive from a desert to an area with heavy snowfall will now be possible.
* Mt. Slippery is one of the highest peaks in the game. Mt. Chiliad will not be making a return.
* One of the weapons is a remote-controlled explosive miniature truck called the ""RC Tour"".
* There will be countrysides, deserts, and mountain peaks.
San Fierro and Las Venturas will not be making a return.
* The northern side of the map is bordered by the Tetas Grandes Mountain Range (the real-life equivalent being the Los Padres National Forest).
* Children of the protagonist will be present in V, however they cannot be killed. It is unknown if they will be making appearances outside of cutscenes.
* The protagonist has two children, boy Daniel and girl Skyler. They are about 10 years old and are too young to understand the protagonist's criminal history. 
* The protagonist is divorced, with the wife having full custody over the children.
* An achievement called ""Desert Bus"" will be featured.
* The hidden packages will be 100 crazy Sasquatches that will be placed around San Andreas. They will be recognizable by their faint red glow and constant cooing.

**The counties of San Andreas are:**

* Los Angeles County --&gt; Los Santos County
* Orange County --&gt; Valais County
* San Diego County --&gt; Santa Hueso County
* San Bernardino County --&gt; Brigham County
* Ventura/Santa Barbara County --&gt; Santa Catarina County
* Riverside/Imperial County --&gt; Trecena County

There will be snow-capped mountains in game. Most of them are within Brigham County, which is the second largest county compared to Los Santos.

* Attempting to boat around the mountains will result in a never ending row of mountains.
* The eastern border of the map is the Yucca Desert, which stretches on into infinity. A single road runs through it, however traveling too far out will result in a message implying there's nothing out there. 
* The west and south parts of the map is the Pacific ocean. 
* The southeast part of the map is the Mexican-American border, however it is only referred to as ""The Border"". Crossing over the boarder will result in 5 stars, unless the player turns around immediately. Beyond the border is endless desert.
* Dogs will be in the game, but only with their humans.

* The story focuses on Mexican drug cartels, mainly between two warring cartels, X1 and the Cholula Cartel and their ""army"", Los Illuminados.
* African-American gangs will return as the ""Families Alliance"" or even just ""The Alliance"". Their color is Black and Green. Their rivals are the Mafioso Alliance, who wear Blue. A third, smaller African-American gang called ""The Tracers"" will play the most important role in the story.
* A Korean mob, Yakuza, and references to the Irish mob will be present, along with the Triads and Russian mob.
* The protagonist's name is Ray, age 53, father of 2 children, divorcee, and an ex-con from upstate Liberty. Ray moved to Los Santos recently and was served with a divorce weeks later. Due to his criminal background, this prevented him from having custody of his children, thus giving full custody to his ex-wife instead."	t5_2t0xk	True

Snow areas, real-time seasons/weather, wingsuits, customization of vehicles (similar to GTA:SA), a shit load of easter eggs to find, co-op bank heists, and a zombie free-roam mode (similar to RDR but needs to be multiplayer)

It would be very similar to dueling in RDR where if Marston was passing through a town he'd be offered to duel, but instead if one of the three protagonists stopped at a red light there would be a chance for him to race the car near him. However it'd probably have to depend a number of things like what car your protagonist/ person you're about to race is in (if you were in a mini-van than you shouldn't be acceptable to race) but if you were in something like a Comet then you'd be offered to race. 

In game it should be like you're at the stop-light and you can hear the person next to you say something like ""Wanna' race?"" and you can press LB/ L2 to accept just like in RDR. Tell me your guys thoughts."	t5_2t0xk	True

That means that in this picture: http://www.igta5.com/images/official-screenshot-view-from-observatory.jpg that entire city area is only 25% of the map.

That city alone is bigger than gta4's city.

That puts the size of the world into a better perspective when I see that screenshot. A full fledged city, HUGE, and THEN 75% of the rest of the map is outside of that! good god.

1367630765.0	1dnlqa	For anyone who hasn't heard or seen the bit of info we got on police...	Rhymes_with_relevant	93	17	110	"...here is what we know.

The circular zone that flashes on the map will return when cops come after you, and you can try to get outside that radius, but you'll also be able to try to hide inside it. The cops will use a line-of-sight system, so they won't just magically know where you are. If they have a helicopter in the sky, they'll be able to see a lot, and you'll see police use hand signals to communicate.

Also, the six star wanted system is returning with five stars instead. 

How do you think the new system will work?

I think on one star, police will try to arrest like in IV. On two stars, they should shoot at you to usually kill you. Arrests should still be able to be made, but be very very very limited. If you return fire, then you should get two stars with no arrests, where the police shoot to kill. If you kill a few, then you should get three stars, where it's shoot to kill and a lot of police come looking for you with helicopters. Maybe some SWAT could show up after you kill a few cops on this star. On four stars, you should have FIB and tons of police but mostly SWAT and FIB come looking or you. The fifth star should have tons of Military, FIB, and some SWAT come after you. 

Also, what is your reaction to this news, especially the five stars instead of six?"	t5_2t0xk	True

1369960639.0	1fdgwo	My perfect multiplayer game mode	UnderstandingPrimus	91	22	88	"With with less than four months left, we are not left with much of a possibility of this happening. However, it's my ultimate fantasy and I would die just to see this happen. Hear me out. 

Game starts. 16 players spread out across the WHOLE map. Yeah motherfuckers, the whole god damn map. What is the premise of the game? It's quite simple. Last man standing. Everyone is anonymous to a certain extent, and its time to kill or be killed. When dead, you are out of the game, you are shoved to another one or you're left to throw your controller to the ground in disappointment because you couldn't do better. 

Now at first glance, this doesn't sound to fulfilling. It's too basic, too simple. Well that's what makes it so amazing. YOU'RE FREE. It's basically like free roam, only when you're dead you're well... Dead. This can extend into different modes. A free roam type version where you can stay until you die, or a death match type. I would probably play the second one more, because drastic times call for drastic measures. Rockets being set off, bullets riddling your car as you escape just before it explodes. You almost died, but you didn't. You're still in the race, and your next target is everyone, and everyone's target is you. 

Need a health pack? Fuck you, you ain't getting one. You better be careful because you're driving a little too fast. There's a VERY large plane behind you, and it might take you out before you have a chance to breath. Understand what I'm saying? The possibilities are endless, and the epitome of a fulfilled GTA game is freedom, and thats what you get within the short boundries of gravity and death. Team matches can be established, a gang type match is extremely promising as well. 

People of /r/GrandTheftAutoV, Rockstar is a very good listener. If we can make this happen, countless hours of fun can be had. It was just an idea of mine and can possibly lead to a very fulfilled game. No it doesn't refer to the graphics or the frame rate, it's just a simple concept that can go a long way.

I feel Max Payne 3 shitted all over GTA 4 and Liberty City Stories. Granted I did love GTA 4 and the expacs however Max Payne 3's gameplay, voice acting, how the characters look, story, visual effects, guns, character development, plot holes that get filled by plot twists, ect, ect was phenomenal. 

The subtle tears in Max's clothes/wounds he receives over time, there it so many details.. The suedo-cinematic events like sneaking through door way scenes that happen, voice acting, gun sounds, gore. Others might not agree but I fuckin loved it.

With that said, I am pretty excited about what Rockstar will incorporate from Max Payne 3. I noticed a lot of people talking about Red Dead Redemption and things from that game they may put in V but not from MP3. I feel if the game play is anything like Max Payne 3, of course GTA'esque it will be very a very fresh new evolved GTA game. Personally, at the time of playing GTA 4, I felt it was one of the greatest games I've played. I feel the same way, more so about Max Payne 3. Looking foward towards GTA V I feel it will blow away prior Rockstar Games. They weren't bullshitting when they said it was their most ambitious game yet (I feel Max Payne 3 is pretty ambitious...)

Moral of the story, GTA V is going to be epic as fuck. It will exude an epic level far greater than what we have ever experienced.

What would yall wanna see incorperated into GTA V from Max Payne 3?
EDIT: I also enjoyed the difficulty, I played on the medium difficulty, what ever that is called and some parts of the game were very hard, until i figured out a game plan.

EDIT2: I loved the addition of music in MP3... if GTA V has the same use of music, which I am sure it will, missions will have an extra oomph. Not going to spoil anything but the music towards the end of the game is fucking awesome and coincides with the context of the story beautifully.

I'm thinking heists/intense shoot outs in GTA V with MP3s music implementation will be bananas.."	t5_2t0xk	True

There is next to no evidence to suggest this other than a slight resemblance based off half a face.  
  
  
[Here's an interview from September 2009.](http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/741/updated-asked-answered-re-vice-city-red-dead-redemption-and-chin.html)  
This in reference to this [picture](http://images.wikia.com/gtawiki/images/3/3a/RIP_graffiti_%28GTA4%29.png).  
  
He doesn't rule out a return to the GTAIII canon but considering the interview mentions that most of the characters are dead and the wall of graffiti shows RIP messages for Tommy, CJ, Claude and Toni. This is pretty solid evidence to suggest that in the present day they are all dead.  
  
As far as Tommy Vercetti specifically is concerned Ray Liotta has been confirmed to have not appeared in the trailer.  
http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/121/1211384p1.html - As far as I'm concerned that's enough to rule him out.  
  
As well as the fact that R* have never used the same main charcter twice in a GTA game and the evidence shown above leads me to believe that non of the old charcters will be returning, at least as a playable charcter.  
  
  
If I'm being honest I'd love to play as them again but let's be realistic here. Apart from a slight resemblance to Vercetti there's nothing to suggest that he'd make a return. It's not in Rockstar's nature to do something like that.  
And you could go as far as saying that GTAV is the start of another world and canon, much like GTAIV was to GTAIII. We got 5 games out of the GTAIII canon and 3 out of the GTAIV canon. Maybe they've moved on once again? Who knows?"	t5_2t0xk	True

What I'm thinking is that instead of making a complete separate game like TBoGT and LaD was, what if the DLC added in one switchable character who is a cop? You can't kill civilians and good around, but you can go and perform jobs for the LSPD, and you can switch back to normal characters at any time. He can have a separate storyline, but if you start a wanted level with the original 3 characters, you can switch back to him and chase your own character around. 

I feel like they could add so much with the character switcher, since I predict that the whole switching thing will get boring, and this is what I think they should add.

1368444944.0	1e8m28	Why GTA V is going to be a new San Andreas.	crashedpumpkin	111	43	81	"I´ve noticed that V is going to be much like San Andreas.

This is going to be long and i apologize for this.

Okay, so, lets think; Why was San Andreas that great?

Because of its brutality, its dark humor and its well rounded gameplay?
Yeah, sure, but one of the main things why its was that good and that popular is, it gave the player freedom.
You had a huge countryside, 3 huge cites, a lot of vehicles and weapons and the choice to explore or use it.
Thats different to all other GTA´s before. You could redesign CJ, you could stay in the city and shoot some cops or go to the country side and shoot some rednecks. Its all about you.

In GTA 3 for example the world was a bit small, and you only had a city to live in and a strict plot to fill. But you couldn't decide for yourself what you want to do.

Its the same thing with newer GTA´s. IV is quite similar to 3. A tight, loud city you have to live in, no country side and not as much possibilities as in San Andreas. You also had a plot to fulfill.

I think V is going to be a all new San Andreas. Just a huge ass map, a shitload of possibilities and the choice is all yours. It gives freedom back to the player. You wont be sticking to any strict plot, its just you and your heist-buddys. 


3/ San Andreas and IV/V are similiar in another point too.

3 gaves us all new standards, we got things we´ve never seen before. San Andreas was just the same, on a really high level and with a shitload of possibilities.
The same thing applies to V/ IV.  IV gave us a whole lot of new things (if you think about graphics, phones, cabarets and all this stuff)

V is simply going to bring all this stuff on an expert level. Make it better, bigger, louder and filled with possibilities.


Do you share my point of view?
Is V just going to be the new San Andreas?"	t5_2t0xk	True

He was absolutely correct and now a [recent post](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=519075&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1062412773)  of his says 
&gt;""I'm sorry for my absence. My mother has been ill. After struggling to take care of her myself, I've decided to put her up in a treatment center in Seamen's Village.
Do you know what it's like to clean up your own mother's piss?""


It could be a clue if a new map area that may contain it's counterpart ""Fishermans Village"" in Marina Del Rey CA.

There is also a similar [lighthouse](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=519075&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1062413006), and there is also a [Christian Science Practitioner](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=519075&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1062413030) on the real map there which aligns the sick mother comment. The [boat channel](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=519075&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1062413079) there also resembles the Epsilon Logo.

I think they could do this, where maybe there is a Las Venturas casino heist that takes place in a linear level entirely inside the casino.

I think the setting would be great for a game that is putting emphasis on big heists and set pieces. Franklin does some sneaking through the casino's backrooms while Michael does something else important. Eventually the robbery starts and the two have to get to the roof where Trevor will bring the helicopter, while a NOOSE team is on their tail.

If they upgraded the melee combat, fleshed it out and made it more fluid, it would mean that guns wouldn't be the instant go-to for every mission. It would also fit with a more realistic theme, especially given how GTA stories normally progress. After all, a petty criminal isn't likely to be shooting thousands of rounds at people in a major city, is he? It makes sense that as the character becomes higher up in the criminal world, he might start packing more firepower, but in the early-mid stages of the game, I'd love to see a greater focus on hand to hand fighting.

It'd also provide more gameplay options; you could feasibly kill a bunch of enemies without getting the police involved, for example.

On top of this, if you make guns and ammo much, much more expensive than in previous games, it a) makes money much more valuable (further tying into story progression) and b) makes every shot mean something.

Welcome to Speculation Saturday!

This thread was inspired by the users that feel that speculation is a bit to rampant here and to have a place to more easily discuss the wildest of rumors and to speculate what you think will make it into GTA V!

This thread will allow for easier navigation for information as well as improve search for those looking for specific posts whether it before for information, photos, or rumors.

After the game launches I will change these threads into Sum-Up Saturday where I'll sum up the latest finds and news on GTA V!

Me personally? I believe the trailer is going to be a part of the visit to GamesCom that R* is taking. They promised a trailer of some sort there, but never specified the game. It takes place from the 21 - 25 of this month, meaning pretty close to a month before launch.

To me, this is probably the biggest pet peeve I have about gta, my absolute favorite game series.

Wouldn't it be awesome to see more realistic car/road environments?? Not only do you NOT see the same car on the same road at the same time, BUT you see different colors, modifications, damage etc...

Not only that, but different taxis, police cars, etc... Maybe saying different area/city names on them (like real police cars) with some minor variations (for instance there's the dodge charger police cars in real life, as well as the normal ones, the SUV's etc...) but in GTA there's always the ONE type driving around (you can really only see the others if you get certain level of stars etc...). So some variation here would be cool too.

Also, more vehicles with more people (like buses full of people, or a mail man in his mail truck stopping every block, or tow trucks taking away cars in parking lots etc..) - MORE real life events happening around you (like cops chasing people besides you that seldom happens, and if it does is very cookie-cutter scenario in GTA4)

And last but not least, I love getting into all the different vehicles in the game, and personally I would find it SO COOL if every vehicle in the game had a set hidden location (or not hidden for the more bland cars) so that you COULD get all the vehicles at least once, or at least say ""oh i know where that really awesome car is"" when you want to do something fun. To put this in real life perspective it's like the dock owner has a lambo, and you can always go there to steal it. Or the ""rich guy in town x has vehicle y"" and you can always go pick it up (maybe even only have it there at certain times) but overall, just open the availability of some vehicles (more fun to find hidden cars too). And on that note, make NO vehicle ""unobtainable"". Using cheats and game hacks is so pathetic just so you can get a vehicle that's already in the game :(

First of all, hear me out. GTA Online sounds like an MMO, but Rockstar has said that it is NOT an MMO.
Also, Rockstar has said that GTA Online is such a big change, that it's been compared to how GTA 3 changed everything for the GTA series, which means it's HUGE.

There's money on the top right screen, which indicates that the money is used in THAT server, and not for the whole GTA Online experience, like how GTA IV used money all-around for pretty much level-ing.

My theory is that it's sort of a minecraft-ish feel to it. When you join a server, you start by yourself, with the rest of the players in the server. You can most likely buy apartments, build homes, buy stocks, pretty much everything in single player, but the world is, just like they said, ""Online"", but closed to the amount of players that are in THAT server, which makes it un-like an MMO. The reason I said, ""Minecraft Feel"" is because, when you join different servers on minecraft, you have to start all over, with that community. You can't bring over your stuff onto that other community, just like how possibly, you can't bring your cash/stocks/whatever onto a different server/world on GTA Online (Theory).


Honestly, I spent about half an hour only thinking up theories, and that's the ONLY thing that makes sense. It's not an MMO, but it was so game-changing that it's been changed to GTA Online, and compared to GTA 3. The map is so huge, but due to console limits, it'll probably be limited to 16 or 32, which also prevents it from coming close to an MMO. Not only that, but this theory seems plausible, and hasn't been done on any console game before, hence, why it's game-changing.


One more thing, Sorry if I worded it a bit weird. I've had the idea for a week, and when I saw the trailer, it gave me an even more reason to think it's true, and made me excited.


**EDIT**

It seems half of you are asking for sources. If you'd really like one, then google them. In no means am I trying to be rude or selfish, but I've been following the news on GTA V since the very beginning, and have read out every news article about it so far, which include reliable news sources. I'm just quoting what I have read, but I didn't intend to gather up all the sources because I didn't think people would ask for such. I thought you all would have known the info that I do, considering this entire sub-reddit is dedicated to this one game. Just google it.

Ex. ""Yesterday a city bus was hijacked, but continued to follow the pick-up route and gathered passengers until all seats were full. The driver then drove the bus up the east side of Mt.

1. The map will not open up incrementally, it will be 100% available at the start of the game

2. Safehouses cannot be purchased

3. This will be the largest GTA map to date

So, if safehouses can't be purchased, it will be very hard straying far away from your initial safehouse at the start. The game will essentially tie you to a certain area because it'll be a bitch to go far away and then drive all the way back. As you progress and get more safehouses, it will be easier to move into new areas. An interesting way for Rockstar to keep gameplay ""focused"" on certain areas during the storyline."	t5_2t0xk	True
1349919460.0	11aauo	Sometimes you've got to think outside the box. Get excited for GTA V!	eliseatsbacon	76	15	54	"Disclaimer: I understand that all of Rockstar's games have been ambitious, individual projects. However, it's never a bad thing to think like a Rockstar Dev...

So this is an upcoming thing: http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/11/retailers-leak-rockstar-games-collection

Here's my view: GTA V has been a long term project ever since IV. All of Rockstar's games (in the pack plus Max Payne 3) have been supplementary projects building up to the new game. I see IV as more of a beta to the new GTA; they established next-gen physics, graphics, etc. Midnight Club LA then polished driving mechanics and car customization that will be found in GTA V. Next, Red Dead Redemption
built upon the established physics engine, created a beautiful display of nature, and added animal NPCs to the game. Red Dead also used the dead-eye feature in preparation for Max Payne 3. LA Noire established the studio's in game art and architecture. They built an accurate portrait of downtown LA and used facial recognition technology to further connect the audience to the game. Finally, Max Payne 3 built upon combat and multiplay features of the gaming experience.
GTA V will incorporate all of these awesome features that previous games have created. Rockstar ensures that they are hard-at-work on their largest, most ambitious project yet.

Yep, it's been a long wait. We've been waiting for this for 5 years.

We've officially been waiting for just under 2 years.

It's been around 670 days since we first found out about this glorious game. We have a tiny tiny snippet of that time left.

We only have 7 weeks and 1 day left.

3 menstrual cycles or something bloody and disgusting like that.

Sorry for the lack of great content in this post, but, it's a dry spell, there's no new info to be found anywhere, and it looks like we're gonna be holding on to this dry spell until mid or late august at worst. It's okay guys, hold on to your controllers!^^^^xbox ^^^^woo! 

It's not long till they release that juicy multiplayer info either, you just gotta hold on, it'll all be worth it when it comes around. I'm probably doing the worst out of all of you, every time I see a car that is mildly copied in GTA V in real life I can't help but imagine busting around the streets of Los Santos in it, or for example when I'm going through a housing estate, I wonder if there are going to be massive residential true to life areas in GTA, but all I can do is wonder and drive myself crazy with the wait.

We'll pull through this guys.

Keep your spirits up, why not do some fan art or something?

It's you normal free roam match except there is no indicators as to who is a person and who is a civilian.  So everyone chooses to either be a criminal or a cop.  The criminals are given missions like assassinate this character or rob this ATM or steal this car. The cops are obviously trying to find out who the criminals are and kill them.  The twist is that when you die as a criminal, you become a cop.  The scoring goes that the criminals get say 10 - 30 points depending on the difficulty of their job, and the cops get 20 points for every criminal they kill, but lose 10 points for every civilian they kill.  Could you imagine the havoc when say there's only one criminal left, the criminal has the most points, but a cop is just a few behind and it creates this super intense game of cat and mouse.

1373565008.0	1i3euo	Fun with voyeurism	Broncos_Fan	77	18	35	Many people seem to be freaking out over the idea of switching to a character (Trevor) and suddenly being stuck in a five-star chase. What everyone is forgetting though, is that that part of the video was showing off an amazing new feature that is available now due to having three playable characters: voyeurism. It is my belief that switching to a character doesn't automatically leave you in control. If you watch, the camera angles change when viewing Trevor and it's more like a cut scene. I believe that part of the video was entirely automated, just as it will be when we play it. How cool is that? You're walking down the street, trying to think of what you want to do next (debating what is within range, what you have time to do and still get a few hours of sleep, what sounds like the most fun) -- now, you can just check in on the other two characters and see if the activity they are doing sounds like a good time (or if they're close enough to something that does). You zoom in on Trevor and he's being chased by cops with five-stars... You don't have time for that, but why not watch for a few minutes. A decade ago I might have even schmeoooked a beowwwll. Then, deciding against spending the next half hour losing the wanted level, you zoom back out and check in on Franklin. Perhaps he is doing something/near something you want to take over. The hours of just driving around aimlessly are gone (except for the times that that is exactly what you want to do). Whenever you want a break or a change of pace, you can have it at the press of a button. It's the one feature that GTA has always been missing even if we never realized it. 	t5_2t0xk	True
