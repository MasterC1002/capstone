Could someone explain what this is?

I decided to make this thread because the announcement box was getting too big for the current update:

**The Playlist**

Take note that from now on the playlist will act like a proper ranking: that means that it will be limited to 150 songs, those songs that get pushed beyond the 150th position will be dropped. this decision was made for two reasons: the playlist was getting too big to handle and because a ranking could make things more interesting.

**The Current Theme**

As I wrote on another thread, I was going to change to a Gumi theme much more earlier, but I decided to wait, taking in consideration the proximity of her anniversary and our ""+2000 members"" milestone, fortunately at the end, the timing of both events was almost perfect :)

Sorry for the constant modifications over the course of the day, but I wasn't satisfied with many of its elements (I'm still not conpletely satisfied), it doesn't help that I usually have a very busy routine so I could only work on it when I had the chance.

If you have any issues with the current theme just let me know.

Any comments and/or critiques about this or other topics are more than welcome.

To celebrate [the official Hatsune Miku Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hatsune-Miku/10150149727825637) reaching 1 million likes, Crypton kicked off this ""FindMe"" contest, where all you have to do is tell them roughly where you live and you get entered into a prize draw to win a trip to Miku's next big concert (or some Vocaloid merch, if you prefer). Now if that isn't the coolest prize for a contest ever, I don't know what is.

###Why is it so important?

Aside from the fact that the prizes are **AMAZING**, the really important part of this is the part where *you let Crypton know whereabouts you live*.

With Project DIVA F getting a US/EU release and Miku English just around the corner, it's clear that Crypton is really eager to expand Vocaloid's presence across the globe. And in order to do that, they need to know where to expand to! If you fill this in, Crypton will be happy because they know there are Vocaloid fans where you live, and you'll be happy because it's just become a little more likely that there will be an official Vocaloid event in your area in the future (and you're entered into the coolest prize draw ever).

Crypton are ideally looking to get every single Vocaloid fan to sign up to this, which is why the prize is so big. So once you're done, send it to your friends! Please try to get all the Vocaloid fans as you know to help Crypton out and put in their details. We'll all be really grateful for it in the future.

[http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3548](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3548)



**EDIT:**

For those of you asking about the ""open source"" part of it: Yes, the Vocaloid software is not open source, but the argument here is that you can extend the ideas of open-source software to culture. Read more here (also linked in the PanelPicker page) -- [http://alexleavitt.com/media/sxsw2012-future15-miku-alexleavitt.pdf](http://alexleavitt.com/media/sxsw2012-future15-miku-alexleavitt.pdf) (sorry for the lack of videos in the PDF; this was a presentation I gave last year at SXSW in a solo talk, and these ideas act as the foundation for this year's panel discussion). The ""open source"" nature of Miku and Vocaloid is also an idea that Hiroyuki Itoh has discussed briefly in various conversations."	t5_2rn75	True

1341514652.0	w37qk	AX 2012 Vocaloid panel summary:	deviryuu	37	4	14	"So I went to AX again this year, and this year's panel was very exciting; to say the least. I'll start from the beginning:

On the first panel (it was split up into two days), we were greeted into a not-so-big room, with a mystery mesh in the back behind the panelists. They didn't explain much, and showed the intro video, made by kagomeP. Afterwords, they used the mesh screen to give us a suprise miku concert (dont worry, it was just MMD and stuff and it was kind of small). The only song I really recognized was freely tomorrow, but oh well. After that they were supposed to show an assortment of vocaloid song videos, but we went over our time limit and the panel was ended.

On the 2nd panel, however, was definitely an event to remember. It was in one of the big panel rooms, used to huge events and such. I remember being it literally full. As usual, the panelists came out, and they announced this years special producer guests (which was an amazing lineup this year):

from right to left:


* KagomeP
* (translator)
* agoanikiP (Was unannounced, huge surprise.)
* VocaliodP + his artist
* deadballP
* And last but not least, Dixie flatline.

Photo: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/396014_499800110036209_1474928153_n.jpg

KagomeP was first, he was the creator of the video for the panel as well as the song (I think), and he was pretty cool. He made a speech about how our drinking laws suck and how its worse in japan and ""Fuck the japanese government"" (actual quote, everyone lol'd). 

AgoanikiP was a very amusing part, mostly because the first words he said was ""I was supposed to practice english, but I got bored and started playing diablo 3 instead."" So, instead, we listened to his translator go at it. He had trouble getting there, mostly because he couldn't speak english and had to have someone at the airport write him a note and then somehow made it to san diego instead of LA. Oh well. He explained that he had made double lariat and such, and also revealed that he himself made the artwork for it. I thought that was a nice fact; but that's just me. He showed a song his sister made, which was also a premiere video. 

Next was VocaliodP, (just saying this now, i know next to nothing about him or his song so welp) who showed a premiere song and talked about how he met his artist and such. 

Afterwords was DeadballP, who showed off japanese ninja #1. Everyone laughed at the video, etc etc. His response was ""You know, I really don't know why I made this song anymore."" Then he went off to explain how his songs aren't for children and such.


Afterwords, was (the main event imo), dixie flatline's turn. My first impression was he looked a lot older than I thought he would be, which was a suprise. He had a very hartwarming story about how he was supposed to be a normal music producer in new york, but everything went wrong, and he had to move back to japan, his dreams crushed. Then, he got into vocaloid and made just be friends; etc. He said after he had seen mikunopolis and saw that his song was in it, and saw that everyone in the crowd was singing along to his song, even overseas, it made him tear up and make him realize that his dream had infact been realized. Afterwords, he showed his premiere song: an answer song to JBF. (I don't think this is on YT yet, it probably is.) 

Afterwords everyone flooded the stage for autographs. The end!

I am hesitating a bit about this since Reddit is not a video website itself, but it would not hurt to try?


**EDIT**: Whoa, this is getting more attention than I had expected. So if we were to really make this happen, we would need singer (duh), mixers, animators and maybe artists.

And as of our first song...I was thinking of doing something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEdzZIXem7Q) with a song that everybody knows, and include *everybody* who join, just ""for the shit of it"", to see how it works.

There's been some work on an alternative design for /r/vocaloid. I'd like to see some community input regarding this design, and the current one.

The alternative design is currently in use at **/r/sircmpwn**, for anyone who wishes to take a look. Give it some thought, and provide critique in the comments. Also welcome is any critique of the current design.

If you like the current design, please [upvote this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/15ve88/proposed_alternative_design_for_rvocaloid/c7q4y3a).

If you prefer the alternative, please [upvote this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/15ve88/proposed_alternative_design_for_rvocaloid/c7q4yu0).

Please take in consideration (especially for the new users) that both designs ""aren't set in stone"".

For instance the current one gets refreshed with a new vocaloid theme every 1000 subs and the alternative one could get some changes too. However the overall layout of both designs is pretty much finished"	t5_2rn75	True

One year later, it is **still** in the Weekly Vocaloid Rankings. Not once did it ever sink below rank 30.  Occasionally it would sink below rank 20 then suddenly surge upward again the following week.  I don't know if any other Vocaloid song has achieved this in the nearly five years the Vocaran has been running, but a congratulations is in order to Kurousa-P.  The song is immortal.

1358889485.0	172u6c	Regarding copyrighted music submissions on /r/vocaloid	sircmpwn	39	14	80	"The community is in uproar over the moderation's stance on pirated content, so we'd like to address it in more detail.

Firstly, I want to make our reasoning clear. **/r/vocaloid promotes vocaloid content**. We want vocaloid music to continue to grow and thrive, and **that means supporting the producers of music**.

Some people have claimed that YouTube reprints of NND songs is just bite-sized piracy. This is true. However, we're not blind to the fact that /r/vocaloid would be almost empty if not for these. We consider these posts acceptable because the producers have the means of having their content removed, or monetized so they get their dues. Additionally, most producers seem to be happy with reprints. **These are welcome on the subreddit**.

However, **copyrighted torrents hurt producers**. Massive amounts of copyrighted content included in a torrent such as the one that has sparked such controversy is a handy way to pirate music in bulk. It doesn't just allow you to see one song reprinted on YouTube, it's entire albums of copyrighted content. Dozens of producers having their content ripped off is considerably worse than a single reprint. A reprint usually also includes the producer and is more personal, with one song at a time, while the huge collection of stolen music is just likely to be thrown on shuffle and the producer will not be recognized. Additionally, producers have no means of having this content removed, and no means of profiting from it. Often, reprints include links to the original in the description, or links to where the music can be legitimately purchased. This is extremely rare with torrents, and is not present in the controversial torrent that inspired these
discussions.

The conclusion we draw is that **torrenting vocaloid music hurts vocaloid music**. We understand that many of you disagree, but we'd like to point out that there are alternative places to torrent vocaloid music if you wish to do so. We simply ask that you do so outside of /r/vocaloid.

In the future, please try to find the original NicoNico link when you submit music (or YouTube if the original is there). Anyone who knows where the original is, you're encouraged to link it in the comments of the post. We will also make it clear to posters what kind of content is not allowed on the submission page, and continue to remove posts that include pirated content en-masse. We will first issue a warning to the poster, and follow up with a ban if they continue to post these links.

**tl;dr**: Pirating vocaloid music in huge torrents only hurts the vocaloid scene. Our priority in this matter is to help
vocaloid music grow and thrive, and as such, we will not allow this content on the subreddit. Stick to YouTube, NicoNico,
and similar services when you post songs."	t5_2rn75	True

Hi r/Vocaloid!

Probably, you already noticed the banners used on other vocaloid related sites: Vocaloidism, Vocaloid Otaku, ProjectDiva.net and soon (when this contest ends) on VocaDB.

In case you didn't. At the moment there are 2 implemented versions ([**88x31**](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5049771/rvocaloid_banner8831.png) and [**180x60**](http://www.vocaloidism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rvocaloid_banner180x60.png))

The purpose of this contest is to come up with two new banners, (88 x 31 and 180x60). 

**Guidelines:**

* Submit your entries as replies to this thread.

* **Max: 2 entries/replies per contestant (one for each banner version).**

* Use PNG files.

* The banners shall have any of these texts: ""r/Vocaloid"" or ""Vocaloid Subreddit"", You can modify the capitalization if you consider that this change will fit your design better.

* Contest mode will be activated (entries are randomly sorted and the scores are hidden). 

* If you have any questions, please sent me a PM and if it's necessary I will address your questions in this post.

* Deadline: February 25th.

**Final Edit**: Congratulations to **Shiwaa** and **Swoax**! Both are the winners of this contest! 

**Shiwaa's 88x31 banner:**  http://i.imgur.com/LkTDbcL.png

**Swoax's 180x60 banner:** http://i.minus.com/jJSAuSmBaEFyw.png

Thanks to everyone for your participation/votes!

**Results:** http://i.imgur.com/BBywwSp.jpg

**Note:** I will start contacting the admins of the other vocaloid sites starting today to change the banners. I will post an announcement when this is completed.

&gt; This is your final warning about posting copyrighted material in bulk on /r/vocaloid, and the next time you do, you will be immediately and permanently banned, as well as reported to reddit administration.

I replied:

&gt; Are you serious? This is a subreddit entirely devoted to posting copyrighted material. Posting a torrent of MikuDB is no different from a page of hundreds of YouTube links if you care about meaningless absurdities like copyright law.
&gt;
&gt; Second, this is clearly what the users want - and subreddits exist for the sake of users, not sircmpwn - given that even after he did whatever, it still is one of my most popular submissions to the subreddit ever.
&gt;
&gt; Third, what is this 'final warning' BS? I don't recall being warned over my previous submissions like [EDIT: link removed at sircmpwn's order] so it's a little disingenuous to call a first warning a final warning.

(Emphasizing how *almost every* submission to /r/vocaloid is ""posting copyrighted material"", I got a chuckle out of [""I found a Vocaloid producer, NoMode, who licenses his music under CC""](http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/357405/nomode) - it's so rare to find submissions which are licensed appropriately that you can submit them as noteworthy!)

Both of my torrent submissions have done well and seem to be appreciated by everyone except sircmpwm.

sircmpwm claims that FiRez agrees with this threat:

&gt; FiRez and I are both moderators, my words is as good as his in the matter. I have discussed this with him privately.

---------------

So my question is this: is this unwritten rule against torrents (not in the sidebar or FAQ) endorsed by /r/Vocaloid in general?

Please leave your opinion so we can settle this matter once and for all."	t5_2rn75	True

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/quvrq/i_programmed_an_image_downloader_for_all_26000/) is the link to the original submission of this tool.

I added a lot of new features to make this tool more useful. [Take a look at this screenshot.](http://i.imgur.com/LTjQu.jpg)

**New features**

* Download all of the 30000 Hatsune Miku images from Safebooru

* Stores either in directories or archives directly to zip files!

* ""Take it easy"" mode for non-invasive background downloading

* Saves your settings so you can easily run it every day to keep your archive up to date


**Technical notes**

* Updated to .Net Framework 4.0 for integrated zip functionality

* Sourcecode is available [here](https://github.com/nomo-cc/MikuDown)


**Other notes**

* This tool doesn't comply with safebooru's [TOS](http://safebooru.org/tos.php), so discretion is advised.

* The months 2010-1 and 2010-3 had disproportionally many submissions, about 6GB in total, so MikuDown might struggle with these in zipmode. Try downloading in file mode and zip the resulting folders. Zipmode will properly recognize the files as already downloaded."	t5_2rn75	True

1342148949.0	wh9za	[Poll] Help build MikuRadio	NotMootyWaffles	26	3	12	"Hi /r/Vocaloid!

I know you are all busy, so **tldr: Building a new MikuRadio, vote on features [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBuaGlxc2ZXQmVoRE0zY0RxdHlsd2c6MQ#gid=0)**

Long form:

So I helped stream to something called Miku.fm. Lot of people liked it, we usually got ~5-7 people listening at times. I really enjoyed streaming for it, and it helped me and others expand their Vocaloid library. It kinda never got picked up again after I stopped streaming from my laptop, and I don't even know the current status of it, and with the site constantly being messed around, it was really getting inconsistent. So I want to build something when I'm not working (which right now is about ~11 hours a day), so MikuRadio is a natural project that I know that I will enjoy and *hopefully* others will too.

Anyways, enough back story, the main motivation is to keep this radio as community driven as possible, so I put together this poll so I can get a good gauge on what people want and don't want.

Thanks for reading the long wall of text, and once again the poll [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBuaGlxc2ZXQmVoRE0zY0RxdHlsd2c6MQ#gid=0)

Time to launch for this is probably going to be much much later, I still have a lot of things on my plate, but getting feedback early can't hurt.

**THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE RESPONSE!!!**

1325898143.0	o6650	Dear r/vocaloid: what is your opinion about our little subreddit?	Firez_hn	24	0	36	"Sorry for not directly addressing the MootyWaffles thread but I guess it was already too late when I finally read it, and this is a topic I've wanted to talk about for a while also I'm recovering from a recent surgery, the experience has been much more uncomfortable than I first thought, so because of that I've not been online that much in these last days.

When I decided to create this community Reddit timed out on me, so I postponed its creation for later, when I finally did it, I found out that someone else beat me for mere minutes: alice_m, she made me moderator and posted some few submissions but her account has been inactive for almost a year now.

There have been other moderators who have helped me greatly with some graphical aspects of this subreddit (fblan with his flairs and the guy who did the first css theme, sorry I don't remember his name) but they don't seem to have interest in the vocaloid scene. So I've been kind of alone on this task, but anyway these are some of the ideas that I want to implement/improve:

* I'm really glad to see that we're at almost 1000 subscribers and that despite its small size this subreddit has been quite active even with some great original content that I hope I can summarize in a permanent section (Songs, drawings, fansubs, etc).

* I know that the playlist needs a serious update just like my personal favorites almost half of the videos have been taken down. (I really miss the constant updates of VOCALOIDRequest2, PervertedNova, t12111 and other NND reprinters and fansubbers who got their accounts deleted, I just hope I can still find most of the lost songs) I will also add a note to the playlist layout detailing who submitted the video, the link of his/her submission, and how many upvotes said submission got.

* About the CSS theme, it has worked fine for me in 3 different configurations, [for me it looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/TNjOO.jpg), but it seems to cause some problems to others in the MootyWaffles thread, I wonder if you could tell me your resolution and/or provide me with a screenshot of your browser.

* I'm also considering making a video tutorial of the method I use to get Vocaloid songs (via NicoMiMi with romaji/japanese lyrics + PV as album art added to the MP3 files)

If you have any other ideas/suggestions please let me know, I will consider anything that improves this community. 

I've engaged in nice discussions, got really good recommendations for my music library and found facts about the Vocaloid scene that I didn't know before, so finally, I want to thank you all for being part of this community

Curious, I looked at the Japanese Vocaloid Wiki for KurozumiP's info page and there was a bullet point saying that on May 9, 2013, an illustrator that worked with KurozumiP, going by the name Kurochou, said Kurozumi has withdrawn from Niconico Douga.  

KurozumiP even deleted his twitter account, his Piapro page, and his own blog.

Here's the Wiki entry (Japanese) - http://www5.atwiki.jp/hmiku/?cmd=word&amp;word=%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8D%E3%81%9A%E3%81%BFP&amp;type=normal&amp;page=%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8D%E3%81%9A%E3%81%BFP

I hope Kurozumi decides to come back later.  Really enjoyed his style of vocarock."	t5_2rn75	True

So yeah, what the title says... what was your first Vocaloid song?

For me, my first song and the song which brought me into Vocaloid were different. The first one was Po Pi Po - I found it in a forum post labeled ""What is this, I'm scared"" 3 years ago. I thought it was just some random anime and forgot about it.

Fast forward 2.5 years, I hear Love is War the first time. I like it. I put it along with some other classics (World is Mine, Melt) on my MP3 player. It took me 3 days to find out it was a computer generated voice. 
And about 3 months ago, I found Po Pi Po again, this time knowing what it's about. It still creeps me out for some reason, though.

1351899212.0	12jgnp	Using Vocaloids for a School Project	Physcofalcon	23	5	45	"So we have to present a fake Facebook project in French, and one of the subjects I talk about is music. I was wondering what song I should use when the subject pops up. Maybe three people in my school know what Vocaloids are, and any mention of the word ""Japan"" brings a lot of prejudice and ""Japan is shit"" into the conversation. I am allowed to use Youtube for the presentation, which makes me wonder: what song would could change their opinions on Japanese music?
Some suggestions came to mind:

* ~~Trick and Treat~~ (I was supposed to present on Halloween but the date was pushed back)

* ~~Mrs. Pumpkin's Comical Dream~~

* ~~Remote Control~~: Fast paced and has a cool outfit/dance at the concert.

* ~~Servant of Evil/Villain~~ (Daughter of Evil is too long, Re_Birthday is too esoteric with the lyrics, and Regret Message will make me cry)

* ~~PonPonPon~~

* ~~Alice Human Sacrifice~~

* Duke of Venomania's Madness/Dance With Asmodeus

* ~~Triple Baka~~

* ~~Cantarella~~

* ~~Love is War~~

* Dancing Samurai

* Possibly The World by Nightmare, because I' also talking about favorite T.V. shows.
What does /r/Vocaloid think?

Edit 1: Nothing too techno-y. With an exception to [Triple Baka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQTZC3uNW4).

Edit 3: I am trying to have Pandora find me some songs.

Edit 4: Changed list of songs based on comment suggestions.

**Edit 5: After listening to a bunch of suggestions (thank you!) and clicking on youtube reccomendations, I have determined that the song chosen would be something dark by Gakupo. Duke of Venomania, Immitation Black, Joker, and the likes are all up there."	t5_2rn75	True

I personally think Iroha Nekomura needs more attention.
