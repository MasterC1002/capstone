and if so, what brand of condoms are they?


EDIT: UHHHHH wadashit.....IT WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION T.T as an update. yes my friends did find out. and yes i did get lots of shit and hell about it. not in the way everyone is thinking. most of my friends are ""christian"" and annoying ones at that. at one point in my life i was a christian but too many things happened for me to stay one. but i digress. ive been ratted out to my parents and deacons. awesome. are we allowed first names on reddit? not sure. if a mod has a problem i'll delete the first name. but for now. FUCK YOU TONY, AARON, JAMES, LISA, BETHANY. fuck you all. i dont give a rats ass about your opinions. this is OUR life. we will choose what we want to do. so FUCK YOU ALL TO HELL.

[https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace](https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace?r=NTczNjczNDU5)

Basically, log in with your existing Dropbox account (or create one if you don't have one already) using that link, then enter your UW e-mail address (and verify it after!).

The winning university gets 25 GB of extra space for FREE for two years for each participant. Alumni are eligible as well (you have to use your @uwaterloo.ca address, though, not @alumni.uwaterloo.ca)! Referrals get the team extra points!

---

UPDATE #1: This works for alumni too! Just make sure your @uwaterloo.ca address forwards to another one of your e-mail addresses. Also, because UW's mail servers have greylisting enabled, it may take a bit of time for the verification e-mail to come through!

UPDATE #2: Looks like we've got UW's official support: https://twitter.com/uwaterloo/status/257902100112089089

UPDATE #3: As per foozlewoozle, ""New users - Don't forget to complete the ""Get Started"" section to earn UW more points!""

UPDATE #4: ""Congratulations! You've earned 8 GB for two years. Now help your school win the space race by inviting your friends!""

UPDATE #5: ""Congratulations! You've earned 15 GB for two years. Now help your school win the space race by inviting your friends!""

UPDATE #6: Woohoo!! 25 GB!!! ""Your school is victorious and you get 25 GB!"""	t5_2rb5s	True

I recently got a ticket from him.

I had arrived at the intersection and pushed the button to cross University Ave. The traffic lights for Phillip St traffic was just turning green but the pedestrians' light still displayed the ""Don't Walk"" sign. I figured that it'd still be okay to cross the street, since it was just a matter of me failing to press the button early enough, and I didn't want to wait. I even made eye contact with the pickup truck driver waiting to make the left turn so that he and I were on the same page.

Unfortunately, the cop called me over as soon as I stepped onto the road. He asked me for my ID and then proceeded to give me a $50.00 ticket for ""disobeying the Don't Walk signal"".

Route 7 - Inbound to UW via Columbia will **not** divert via Regina Street. Outbound from UW via Columbia will continue to do so.

Route 12 - **Elimination of service west of Westmount.** The 12 will go west on University and straight down Westmount into Kitchener. For service west of Westmount (e.g: Keats Way, Fischer-Hallman), please see route 29 and 201.

Route 29 - New two-way service between The Boardwalk and King/University and new evening/weekend service to replace the discontinued route 12. Service will be every 10 minutes heading to UW between Fischer-Hallman and King/University during AM rush until around noon. Service will be every 15 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at other times. The 29 will **not** enter UW, so you will have to disembark at Seagram.

iXpress - Will be renamed route **200**.

NEW Route 201 - New iXpress route servicing mainly along Fischer-Hallman, then heading east on Columbia, south on Phillip, east on University, north on Hazel, and west on Columbia. Columbia Lake Village residents, **you can use this route as an alternative to route 13 to get to UW**. Note route 201 will **not** enter UW; you will have to get off at Columbia/UW stop. Service will be every 15 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at all other times of the week.

Fall schedules are now available on the GRT website with the exception of route 201, which can be found [here](http://www.grt.ca/en/routesschedules/resources/RT201.pdf).

I'm Sean Hunt, and you may have heard of me before. On Tuesday, I attended my first meeting as a member of the University's Board of Governors. At that meeting, the Board considered and approved the increase in tuition fees, effective for the Spring 2013 term. I've pulled out [the sections on the fee increases and the budget](http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~scshunt/uw-tuition-june-2013.pdf) from the Board agenda. Everything in that section of the agenda was approved as submitted.

**All governors of the University, whether they are students, faculty, staff, alumni, or just people from the community, are fiduciaries of the University. At a meeting of the Board, we are legally obligated to base our decisions on what we believe to be the best interests of the University, above our own interests and those of our constituents.** The requirement is re-iterated in the [Board Governance Principles](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/governance/board-governors/governance-principles). After asking a number of questions and listening carefully to the discussion, I carefully weighed the interests of the University, the positives and negatives of a tuition fee increase, and subsequently **I voted for the motion**.

I've been disappointed with the relatively poor communication from the University to students about the timing of the fee increases. The administration could have and should have better explained this to students both in advance and this week when they rolled out the increases on Quest. I spent most of this morning running around trying to get critical information, so that hopefully I can answer your questions about my vote, about the situation surrounding the increase, and about the impact it will have on everyone (me included!) this term.

So let's go, grill me!"	t5_2rb5s	True

**Update:** [We got linked in thestar] (http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1315033--university-of-toronto-student-group-hosts-epic-sex-club-adventure). Well, this is awkward.

**Update 2:** Ok, this post has also been mentioned on cbc.ca, Macleans, and Metro News. Didn't expect all this!


I should say... Although I didn't mean to mislead anyone, I refrained from using ""student sex club adventure"" in the title considering the post I made earlier quoting that got removed by the mods (it's back up now), and I didn't want to use the same title as the one that got removed. **I used the term ""orgy"" loosely and somewhat jokingly - it *is* an event where people can get naked and have sex non-privately.** ""Orgy"" is what I associated the event with. It's been said that this ""buzzword"" is what's shocking everyone and giving the event negative attention, but I think **it's really the concept of the event that's causing the reaction - not that it was called an orgy**. Unsurprising, there were shocked responses even when the event wasn't referred to as an orgy in my [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/16elg3/would_you_go_to_a_student_sex_club_adventure/) before it was deleted and remade as this. I wouldn't expect most people to be very open to the idea of going on a ""student sex club adventure"", though I know there are some who are open to things like this. Despite some negative attention, I'm glad I helped recruit those that would be interested in this kind of event."	t5_2rb5s	True

I am posting on behalf of student service group the [University of Waterloo Sustainability Project (UWSP)](https://www.facebook.com/UWSustain?ref=br_tf), Natural Landscaping Team (NLT)

NLT has been working towards **paving the gravel pathway leading from MC to DC**. The path is widening every semester and ruining the grass in the DC Courtyard. Additionally, whenever it rains or snows, the path becomes a sloppy and muddy mess that I don't think anybody wants to walk across. 

As you can imagine, this project requires a lot of funding. Student support will encourage various organizations to fund the project. We would greatly appreciate your testimonials regarding:

* Why the path should be paved and how this will benefit you
* Any statements about the current condition of the pathway
* General feedback or interest in the DC Paving Redevelopment Project

Please provide what faculty you are in with your comments. (Optional but Preferred)

Thank you so much Waterloo! 

P.S. If you are a keen student and this project sounds interesting to you, we love volunteers! Email uwsp.nlt@gmail.com for more information about meeting times or how you can get involved! "	t5_2rb5s	True

So far turnkey desk had nothing nor did UW police.
The ring is gold with my grandfather's initials engraved on it (EKW). It was my only heirloom from when he passed away. Needless to say its outrageously important to me. I would be more than happy to give a reward for anyone who might've picked it up or finds it.

So lemme help you in minimizing your confusion in riding our transit system. If anyone else has anything to contribute, go ahead.

1. If the bus is full, please don't exit at the front, unless you're one of those people who are standing right at the white line. Exit at the rear doors. It helps with the flow of passengers entering and exiting the bus.

2. Most of our buses have motion sensor rear doors. You wave as close to as possible at where the sign says ""Wave Hand Here"", or a little lower than the wave hand. Don't push the doors as they won't open.

3. The windows in our buses cannot be opened, so don't even try. There's a reason why our new buses don't have window openers.

4. If the bus is packed, please do your duty and move all the way to the back. GRT is generally one of the better transit systems when it comes to this, since students are quite courteous of others...and I want this to continue.

5. Don't ask the driver ""Does this bus go to the mall?"". There are four shopping centres that drivers serve in Waterloo Region, and the main mall in the region is not Conestoga Mall, it's Fairview Park Mall. So please specify."	t5_2rb5s	True

Describe the culture at your current co-op workplace for problem-solving. You can discuss your specific department or the entire organization. Who is involved solving problems? Who ultimately decides which solution to implement?  What processes or avenues are there for solving problems? Identify some of the pros and the cons of this culture.


Someone posted this answer:
This term I had trouble finding a job on Jobmine. Luckily, through one of my uncles in China, I was able to land a job. All my fellow co-workers speak Mandarin, some speak Cantonese, and some even speak broken English.  Although my mandarin is not great, I get by. I also get by with the pay, which is 1.21¥ a day. The working hours are 6am to 9pm. An autocratic management style is implemented, as there is one boss and many workers. For example, lunch is recommended to be optional. I guess it is due to a lag in the project schedule. I work at a small desk, approximately 2 ft by 3 ft. I consider myself lucky, some other work at desks that are 1.5ft by 2ft. Along with my desk I was given a sewing kit. When it is dark outside, dim lighting is used and sometimes even candle light (I think to set the mood? Or possibly because my boss is trying to cut back on the electricity bill).
 
When solving problems, the involvement depends on the problem. Sometimes, when solving the problem the boss and the worker with the problem are involved. Other times, only the boss is involved in solving the problem.


For example, at one point near the beginning of my work term, the relationship between me and my boss was not great. I felt like my boss was not impressed with my efficiency. Day in and day out, I was getting yelled at for not stitching fast enough. I was stitching as quickly as I could! I did not know how to tell him this. The main problem arose when he yelled at me for bleeding on his products. I bled because I tried to stitch faster than I am capable of. He did not believe this when I told him because he kept yelling. I don’t know if it is because my mandarin is not clear enough, which makes it a communication problem, or if my boss is just going through a rough patch in his life and taking his frustration out on me. He did not tell me how I could improve or breakdown the process and leave feedback. Instead he constantly yelled “更快”, which means “faster” in mandarin. Anyhow, I was able to increase my efficiency overtime, therefore solving the problem myself.
Another problem that occurred in the workplace began with a fire started by a soldering gun. To be honest, when this fire started I was pretty frightened because I have never experienced a fire so close to me before. Right then and there I was able to classify another workplace related problem. We did not have a proper fire evacuation plan! Oh boy, what a problem it was. I insisted to speak to my boss about it, but he had told me to be quiet and continue working. He took a pale of water and threw out the fire which has spread from the 1.5 by 2ft table onto my fellow co-worker. My boss had single-handedly solved the problem again.


Another problem that occurred between specific co-workers and my boss occurred when it started to rain. Our building has a leaky roof, but to be honest… there are massive holes in the roof. The co-workers that had a problem with the leaky roof were the ones sitting directly below the holes. My boss was very kind in dealing with this problem, he re-located my co-workers’ work stations to another part of the floor. He was very concerned with my co-workers’ health and not with his products being spoiled by the rain.


One problem that we were unable to resolve but eventually went away, involved workplace violence. On a bright and shiny day, three men dressed in black came to pay my boss a visit. Initially, I thought they were his friends who were going to ask him out to play baseball because they were all carrying bats. This mindset of mine changed when I saw them start hitting my boss and demanding that they pay them back. I wanted to call the police but there was no phone line at our company. I stood up and tried to run to help my boss but he yelled at me to get back to work. I was going to help anyways if I wasn’t restricted by the chain locked to my ankle. My co-workers in the other department, specialized in making iphones. I saw them frantically trying to assemble the iphones as quickly as possible so that they could call the police. By the time the men were done their bi-weekly meeting, they had left before my co-workers completed assembling their iphones.
 
There is only one process for solving problems: you either solve it or you don’t.
 
As for the pros and cons, overall, there’s not much to complain about. The only con would be that our department does not have a first aid kit, so when I was bleeding, I have to wait until the day is finished so I can go to the local convenience store and spend my day’s pay on a bandage. Those days are inconvenient because then I wouldn’t be able to afford dinner. As for the pros, there are many! Our boss is kind, displayed by the leaky roof problem; forgiving, displayed by my bleeding problem; non-violent, displayed by the workplace violence problem (he never hit back)."	t5_2rb5s	True

Using a simple python script, and a dictionary of 708,125 words [SCOWL](http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/), I went to work.

I had the script try each ""word"".uwaterloo.ca site in turn and log the return code. If the result was 200 or 404(which was the code that it was giving for  redirect pages for some reason), I logged the results to a file.

Two days later, the script located 491 uwaterloo.ca pages, which are categorized below by arbitrary categories that I made up.

A large number of them are ""Web server configuration/'Under construction':"", which means that they are mostly people messing around with setting up a web server, or may have a template page that they meant to fill in once upon a time, but never got around to it. Artifacts of a growing institution.

The ""Printers"" section seems to be the most likely to be abusable (from a security perspective). Obviously, I do not condone any abuse of this information of any kind.

""Permission Denied"" are interesting simply because I wonder what is lying behind the permission wall.

I've added a section at the bottom called ""Of interest"", which are sites I found interesting, humourous, or simply different.

Hopefully someone else finds this fun/useful. Going into the future, it'd be neat to make some sort of automated crawler for uwaterloo sites and a site where people can submit/comment on things they find.

There are no official crosswalks on ring road. This means CARS HAVE RIGHT OF WAY. As explained to me by one of the campus police officers, speed bumps are NOT crosswalks. There are NO flashing, marked crosswalks on ring road. 

Now let's think about this practically. I drive on ring road, and I also walk across it frequently. Due to the fact that there are no marked crosswalks, pedestrians simply have to jaywalk across. At least in my experience, drivers on ring road often yield to pedestrians and let them either cross or finish crossing without issues. But there are terrible spots on ring road, like right in front of CPH. It's a long curve and it's hard to see pedestrians with the wire fencing that's up around that corner. And at night, forget seeing pedestrians ahead. Pedestrians really have to be careful - I've had to jump on the brakes more than a few times because people either didn't see me or thought ""Hey! I'm gonna cross the road and the almost 4000 lb chunk of steel on wheels is just gonna magically stop on a dime!"" (Those are the best, I just figure Darwin's law will get 'em...*down the road*) We all know or have seen the suicidal idiots that don't look both ways before crossing the road. 

So just to reiterate, cars have right of way. Pedestrians really need to be more careful."	t5_2rb5s	True

1361607366.0	192m22	For all you Jobmine newbies - here's a list of things you should look out for in Jobmine (Not Official)	Pango56	51	10	25	"Hey guys, so I realized a lot of people have questions about Jobmine so I wanted to make a post to summarize things to look out for when you are Jobmining away. Remember, these are through PERSONAL EXPERIENCE and not exactly how jobmine works but I just wanted to help you guys out who are new to jobmine.

REMEMBER: If the job/position is NOT currently in your active applications, then unfortunately you did not get ranked/employed/selected for an interview. This basically means everything in your active applications are potential jobs and if it ever drops out of active applications (unless you get an alternate or something happens) you were not selected / not ranked for that job.

**Applications Available** - This means this job is still taking applications and HAS NOT gone the process of screening through resumes. However, many companies DO NOT update this status and simply contact many kids outside of jobmine so don't be surprised if a job position stays like this until ranking day.

**Applied** - This means you applied to this job

**Screened** - This means they have screened everybody's resume.

**Selected** - This means you have been selected for an interview - go pick an interview time slot!

**Not Selected** - Unfortunately this means you haven't been selected for an interview.

**Alternate** - If one person or more decides not show up for an interview or something else happens, you will be the first person to get the interview time slot (It will switch to selected if someone drops out)

**Scheduled** - This means the scheduling for the interviews for this position have been filled and ready to go.

**Ranking Completed** - Here is where it gets tricky. So you can tell 3 things from this status.

1) If it says Ranking Completed but it is NOT in your active applications, then if you had an interview with them they DID NOT rank you. If you didn't have an interview with them, it simply means they ranked the students they did have interviews with (so not you unfortunately).

2) If it says Ranking Completed and it is IN your active applications then congratulations you got ranked! So here you can check if you got an offer or not by looking at your active applications number and the number of applications you have left in your job inquiry. If you add these two numbers up and get &gt; 50 then congratulations you got an offer!

3) If not, then you simply got ranked and not an offer (still good)!

**Filled** - The position has been filled by students.

**Employed** - Congratulations! You have been employed by this company!

**Cancelled** - The position was cancelled

**Unfilled** - The company did not fill up all the potential slots they could have.
 

Many companies tend to NOT update things on Jobmine so don't get your hopes up if it's the final week of ranking and a company still says APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE - they probably did interviews already and picked their candidates. Also, be on the ball with interview time slots as it's first come first some AND REMEMBER TO PRESS SAVE AFTER YOU PICK IT. Many times people forget to press save and lose their time slot which is horrible especially if you need to fit it in with your school schedule.

Good luck jobmining and hope I helped out!"	t5_2rb5s	True
1354804513.0	14duj4	Jobmine FINALLY going to use PDFs! Rejoice!	anthony81212	46	5	26	"Got an email from them today! 

Here's the text body:
JobMine down in December:
JobMine will be shut down and unavailable from December 17 until December 21.
Why?
The shutdown will allow us to make changes in JobMine to eliminate the cumbersome HTML résumé uploading and printing procedures. These will be replaced with a PDF capability. You will not need to use or know HTML and applying for jobs will be much easier.
Looking for employment during the holidays?
If you are still looking for employment for the January to April 2013 work term and apply to postings during the University’s seasonal break, you will need to upload a PDF résumé to your first résumé spot (the default) in JobMine.

Coming back from a Fall 2012 work term?
If you take part in the interview process for a May to August work term, you will need to upload a PDF résumé to your first résumé spot (the default) in JobMine.
Please note that uWaterloo does not support third party applications, but PDF convertors are available free of charge online. 
Help
Online JobMine Help to support PDF résumés will be available when the system is back on line December 21. No technical support will be available during the University's seasonal break. Any questions or concerns will be addressed as of January 2.

Lately I see more and more people coming to /r/uwaterloo for very sensitive questions that have to do with their plan, situation, academic careers, and possibly the next decade. While this is a community with the all-in-same-school predicate, please do keep in mind that more often than not, we are students without much authority, especially on official business, often with only anecdotal evidences to support our points.

Granted, they're often right but there's no way to be sure. Some cases are strongly situational that a mere *I've seen people do...* type of misinformation could severely damage one's future plans.

If you have some grave situation or sensitive situation which require opinions of authorial, *do talk to them first*.

Solving a problem must always proceeded with gathering sufficient information. Only after preparing with sufficient information can you start asking for others' help, and asking /r/uwaterloo is, at best, the second stage.
 **If you see your sensitive questions answered with multiple replies like *you should talk to your advisor*, then you probably should.**

*You should talk to the advisor if your questions are:*

* of academic planning(such as change-of-program) that you are not sure if you will be allowed to undergo.
* of intricate matter that may affect your (academic)career( *can I graduate with this average? without this course?*)
* of admissions issues that you need to know precise answers to( *what if I pass this course with a 54 and not 55?*)
* of intricate financial issues with regards to the school/admissions (*can I get OSAP this term? How much OSAP? What are my options?*)

*You should probably discuss here first if your questions are:*

* of academic planning that you are not sure if you can pull it off, and wondering if anyone's done the similar before.
* of intricate matter that may affect personal lives(*to counterpart the  second point of previous table.*)
* of admissions issues that you wonder what other people have done in past in similar shoes.(*could actually be the next step after talking to the advisors*)
* of financial issues with regards to the personnel ( *what's the best way to conserve money? earn money for tuition? etc.*)

Talking with the advisors help vastly just to understand your situation precisely, if not perfectly. Knowing your options first is a strict prerequisite for considering them for discussion.

I've met a guy who relied only on anecdotal evidences for two years, that he had been taking the courses for the degree he wishes for, but *not* the program he is in with. He had taken so many useless credits that doesn't build towards his degree, that they couldn't even fit in the elective pool. It's dangerous.

**TL;DR: talk to your advisor, or people with authority guaranteed by the school.**

1364817753.0	1bf0va	[META] Announcing New Hours of Service for /r/uwaterloo	grapeape25	56	15	9	"Effective immediately, the new hours for using /r/uwaterloo are as follows:


*Saturday 7:00 AM to Monday 11:59 PM*

*Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 7:00 AM to 11:59 PM*

*Wednesday 8:00 AM to 11:59 PM*

*All times are Eastern Time (EST).*

Any attempts to use /r/uwaterloo outside of these hours will be blocked.

**Why the change?**

With the growing number of subscribers, we feel that allowing the /r/uwaterloo servers to get a good night's sleep will increase the overall responsiveness of this subreddit throughout the day. It is simply just not scalable for any website on the internet to be running 24/7. The lack of sleep is what ultimately leads to the downtime we see from sites such as Learn or even Reddit itself. By allocating 7 hours of sleep a night during the week (with an extra hour on Wednesday to get over the hump day), we feel that this will ensure continued reliability and sustainable growth.

We do not feel that these changes will negatively impact anyone. Afterall, students do not use the internet past midnight.

**There must be alternatives?**

Over the past year, the moderators of /r/uwaterloo have been searching for viable replacements to this relatively simple concept to no avail. After sinking millions into a potential replacement, code-named /r/uwaterlooworks, which was later scrapped, we have decided to put off the search for replacements and leave /r/uwaterloo in its current state until the search resumes in the future."	t5_2rb5s	True

1345660642.0	ynfo6	A wiki for all aspects of UW's history. (Launched today!)	thewarriorwiki	40	4	25	"Hey Reddit,

We're a group of UW students and alumni who have started an **unofficial** wiki for all things related to the University of Waterloo's history.

It's called **[The Warrior Wiki](http://warriorwiki.ca)** and can be found at **[warriorwiki.ca](http://warriorwiki.ca)**. It's based on the Mediawiki platform and looks and behaves just like Wikipedia.

**So much of the university's history has either been lost or forgotten, with no way for students to access it.** This is the problem the wiki is hoping to address. 

Students should have a repository where they can go to discover the facts about what happened on campus throughout history. Creating it in a wiki format enables students, staff, and graduates to help contribute the knowledge they've collected over the years to help others.

The site is just starting out, so things are pretty sparse, but it's beginning to get a basic covering of the topics.

Check it out. Perhaps you're president of CTRL-A, part of EngSoc, or **just plain know stuff**. Add pages for the topics that you know about.  We just ask that you please read the [Contributing Guidelines](http://warriorwiki.ca/wiki/The_Warrior_Wiki:Contributing_Guidelines) before jumping in.

We'll also answer any questions you may have. So go ahead, **Ask us anything!**

**[EDIT 1: You can also follow us on Twitter: [@thewarriorwiki](https://twitter.com/thewarriorwiki)]**"	t5_2rb5s	True

Some highlights:

- A new 202 iXpress route along University Avenue, between The Boardwalk and Conestoga Mall; travels along Erbsville, Erb, University, Labrador, Northfield. Stops at UW-Seagram (south entrance), University and Phillip. 15 minutes midday Mon-Fri service.

- The 201 iXpress has been modified from its previous terminus at Laurier to terminate at Conestoga Mall. New routing continues along Columbia, north on King to Conestoga Mall. 15 minutes midday Mon-Fri service.

- The 200 iXpress has a new stop at UW - Columbia (the north entrance). This gives a transfer between the 200 and 201 iXpresses at UW - Columbia. The 200 iXpress still stops at UW - Davis Centre.

- Conestoga Mall will now serve as a hub for all three iXpress routes. The transfer between 200 and 201 at Laurier has been eliminated due to the change to route 201.

- With the new 202 iXpress, 29 Keats Way has reduced service (30 minute intervals except morning Mon-Fri to campus east of Fischer-Hallman). This is due to the reduced demand as most riders will switch to using routes 13, 31, or 202.

- 31 Lexington now renamed 31 Columbia, and extended along Columbia west to the Clair Hills neighbourhood. Replaces 13 Laurelwood routing on Columbia between Erbsville and Fischer-Hallman.

- 13 Laurelwood routing modified to run between The Boardwalk and UW - Davis Centre via Laurelcreek Village neighbourhood. Offers two-way service in the Laurelcreek Village area instead of looping one way.

- Increased midday service to every 15 min on the 9 Lakeshore bus between UW - Davis Centre to McCormick and the 13 Laurelwood bus from Davis Centre to the Laurelcreek Village neighbourhood.

- 12 Fairview Park/Conestoga Mall modified routing between University and Weber and University and Lincoln; now runs south on Weber, east on Lincoln, serving Bridgeport Plaza.

- 5 Erb West has been renamed 5 Erb and combined with 6 Bridgeport. 5 Erb travels between The Boardwalk and the Bridgeport neighbourhood via Uptown Waterloo.

Just wanted to tell the story of Double Double Pizza and how they are by far the worst pizza place in waterloo. They have alright pizza, I'll give them that. However, their service is absolutely horrendous. Particularly the Erb st. branch.

First, it starts off when me and my three friends going in. We placed a walk-in order, which surprisingly had extra toppings to be charged on the receipt, but nothing on the pizza. I suppose they thought we were too drunk to notice the difference, and maybe we were, but when we got back to our house we saw on the receipt that it had a few orders of ""Bacon Kromboo"" which.. who the fuck knows what that shit is.. but that was like, $4 for it. As well, extra cheese for $2, which we didn't get. Just to note, there was nothing remotely like bacon even ordered on that pizza.

Second strike: a few months later we were lazy and the pizza place is right there. So, we decided to give them another shot. We order 3 toppings and they charge us for those three toppings, then they give us 2. We call and issue a complaint, which the call center gives us a $5 off our next purchase.

The *only* reason there's a chance at a third strike is that they gave us that $5 off. We place our order through their call center, then 5 minutes later we get a call from their store saying they're refusing us our credit and that we're not getting our pizza if we don't pay full price. I say that we're not going to order from there if we don't get our credit and he says that's fine. I end up telling him that I'll tell everyone to stay the hell away from that shitty pizza place who steals from people and gives terrible customer service.

So, this is, essentially, my follow up to that promise. I'm throwing it to you that this is *the worst* pizza place in waterloo. In fact, the worst pizza place I've ever been to, ever.

Thank you, and goodnight."	t5_2rb5s	True

I was wrapping up my 1b term at the University of Waterloo, and a very disappointing (res-wise) year at Eby Hall in UWP. I had rallyed some friends to live together for the next year (we had 10 people). Finding a house for 10 people was slightly inconvenient as you can imagine, so we found a solution in a small apartment building on Columbia. We were to rent 2 apartments in the building on the same floor. We had signed the leases after looking at some fairly nice apartments and requesting that the two suites be put on the same floor.

Fast forward to September 2011.
The new year was beginning and we started moving in. We pick up our keys, and to our dismay, we are in the basement. Now I know that this is fairly common for student housing, but this basement was nothing like the apartment we saw. 

*sidenote, from now on I will refer to my suite as 'our suite' and the other suite (we had 10 people, 5 in each suite) across the hall as 'the other suite'

Our suite was directly under the main entrance of the building, leading to long restless nights of drunk people stomping above us. The place was riddled with very strange looking bugs, that took a lot of research to classify. The living room smelled like mold and the carpet was covered in burns. Finally a fridge and the dishwasher were smelly and didn't work. On the contrary, the other suite, had laminate flooring installed, and none of the aforementioned problems. We sent some emails to them and nothing really got repaired.

Throughout the year, the living room continued to emit the horrible smell, and several other things started to go wrong. Horrifying mold started appearing behind the sink, the lock at the front of the building was broken, the glass at the back was shattered, and really sketchy people started showing up everywhere. We emailed and emailed and called to no avail. 
Also, this becomes a major point later, the subletters had spilled a hookah over, and caused burns to the carpet.

Fast forward May 2012
I had just moved back in after 4 months on coop. There was a new problem. In the corner of the living room, a wet puddle had appeared. Out of fucking nowhere. This augmented the moldy smell that was there since the beginning. We tried drying it out, but it was too late, the whole carpet had started getting visible moldy. We just gave up hope and fabreezed the fuck out of it at this point.

June 2012
We woke up one afternoon and saw that the puddle had grown. And every week it just got bigger and bigger. Now it was covering a quarter of the living room. I called and report flooding. I had to call 3 days straight before we finally noticed that someone had come. All they did was cut a hole in the wall and rip up the carpet.

So we took it to them. My buddy and I went to their office and complained. What was their response you ask?

'You guys are pouring water on the carpet to cover up burns.'

10+ litres of water (this carpet was SOAKED) 
The burns were on the other side of the fucking room, no where near the water

They gave us an air blower to dry it out. We agreed to this, thinking it would be solved if we just complied. 2 Weeks this air blower was working basically 24/7, and it was almost dry. They came back and took the blower, and as soon as we took it away, the water spread again. 

On top of all of this, they sent us an email saying that we need to pay for a $900 recarpeting job. (Remember that the carpet was already damaged from the burns)

This is the email that we sent back: (after some legal help from a law clerk)

*To the owners and management of ------------------------:

Please be advised that we will not be paying the amount indicated on
the invoice. Pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act, S.O. 2006, c.17
(the “Act”), a tenant is only responsible for repair of “undue damage
to the rental unit or residential complex caused by the wilful or
negligent conduct of the tenant” (s. 34).  We categorically deny
causing any such damage to the unit during our tenancy.

Pursuant to the  Act, a landlord “is responsible for providing and
maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it,
in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying
with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards” (2006, c. 17,
s. 20 (1)). Furthermore, “When a landlord or a tenant becomes liable
to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy agreement, the
person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable
steps to minimize the person’s losses” (2006, c. 17, s. 16).  You are
in breach of both of these sections of the Act. At the beginning of
the lease term, we complained about moldy-smelling carpet which you
deemed to be ""not sufficient grounds for carpet replacement."" You did
not even bother sending anybody to clean it. When you finally did send
somebody to inspect the water damage to the carpet, they cut a hole in
the wall that was not even directly above the problem area. There is
no way to see the floor behind the wall with the hole that was cut.
(We have a video documenting this.)  We  also noticed that the water
spot tended to increase in size following heavy rain storms, probably
indicating some sort of damage to the building's structure. However,
when we brought up the water damage issue with the landlord, we were
accused of ""pouring water on the carpet deliberately”,which is a
ridiculous, baseless accusation.  You chose to ignore our complaint
about the carpet for months. If you had bothered to investigate the
cause of the moldy smell properly when we first complained about it,
the mold issue could have been dealt with sooner rather than later,
minimizing the damage to the carpet.

We note that there are other outstanding maintenance and repair issues
with the unit and building. There is a large patch of black-coloured
mold behind the sink-side of the kitchen counter. We  informed you of
this and we were told that it would be removed. It was not removed.
Also, the back window of the building is broken, and the front door of
the building leading to the suites has a broken lock.

Given all the outstanding maintenance and safety issues with our unit
and the building, it would appear that it is the landlord, not us, who
is in breach of certain of its obligations under the Act and our lease
agreement. As we have not caused any “undue damage” to the unit during
our tenancy, you are not entitled to compensation from us and we
reiterate that we will not be paying the invoice.

Written and sent on behalf of all the residents of --------------------------*

After this email, there was no reply.

This company actually owns a lot of properties in the region. 

And from what I've heard, these types of stories are common with these rental companies. 

Take care, proceed with caution, and remember, the law is always on your side.

TL;DR: Landlord company was run by a bunch of lawless, shameless, useless mafioso thugs. They tried pushing a huge fine on us for no reason. We had to get legal help to escape the situation.

This is the first time ever I am speaking about this, over the past 1.5 years my depression has taken on another level and I am becoming suicidal, it has destroyed my life.  I know I can excel at my courses but I am completely unable to do anything and have begun failing. The only thing that keeps me going are my friends, who are none the wiser about all of this. I need professional help.

I cannot speak to my parents about this, not until I see a professional.

I've visited the UW health site countless times over the past couple years, but posting here is the first real step I've taken. (https://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/mental-health-services/services)

If anyone has dealt with UW health services can you please post here?

Important notes:

1. These forms are for if you were working in California for ONE term last year. If you were in Cali for both co-op terms, you also need to fill out IRS form 8843 and include it with your 1040NR-EZ

2. If your company deducted California state disability insurance (CASDI) and the amount shows up on your W2, you can add it to your state income taxes and that is the amount you enter for ""Itemized Deductions"" on your 1040NR-EZ. You CANNOT claim CASDI back on the 540NR form.

3. I included the 2011 Tax Table in the ZIP. This is for calculating your deductible on the 1040NR-EZ

EDIT: For the section of the 540NR Short that asks for your ""Tax"" use the California 2011 Tax Rates formulae. They can be found here:

Good Morning Residents:
 
 
In 2012 the University installed window limiters in all UW residences across campus.  Over the past year many concerns due to the style of the original window limiters have been brought to our attention.  After much discussion and research we have resourced and purchased a new style of window limiter which may be removed when required at the tenant’s discretion.  Being able to safely and securely operate a window which has safe guards in place to help control the windows opening so as to prevent accidental falls, while at the same time being able to be easily opened for egress purposes in case of an emergency, is critical in all of our residences.
 
We are currently in the process of booking contract staff for next week to remove the old style of limiter and install the new style.  Another notice will be sent to you prior to completion as soon as the exact date has been finalized.
 
Thank you for your patience
Sheila

Original post:
 
I live in CLV North. A couple of months ago, we got window limiters installed on all the second floor windows so that they only open to about 10cm now. The reason, according to UW Housing, is to protect (kids assume) from falls from heights above ground level. They said the safety provided by these limiters will far overweight any disadvantages, and in case of emergency (like fire), the fastest way to escape is to break the window with a chair.

I can't help but think they are hiding something. They wouldn't remove the limiters for residents without kids (I tried). And the fire escape method is just ridiculous. I'm a girl with little upper body strength and no chair in my bedroom to break the windows in case of emergency. This is making me feel very unsafe because there are no good escape routes on the second floor. It's also preventing me from using AC in my bedroom.

Does anyone know of any housing bylaws that specifically prohibits these? Any help would be greatly appreciated."	t5_2rb5s	True

The columns are divided equally so the main column with the content I care about gets the same screen real estate as the columns on the side that users rarely look at? I don't like reading the main content like it is a newspaper columns with a few words per line.

I’m 18, graduated high school last year, and currently living at my parents’ house as a failure.

I did go on to university in the fall… I went to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science. I did horrible in my first term. I failed Honours Calculus, withdrew from Advanced Intro to CS (I had epically failed both midterms), and nearly failed Honours Algebra (passed by 1%). I need the calculus and algebra for my degree, but I didn’t have to take the advanced CS. 

This was a punch in my self-esteem. I had graduated high school at the top of my class (95% avg) and math was one of my strengths. Moreover, most of my self-esteem depended on my academics. I was suicidal in high school and the reason I gave myself to keep struggling on was that I did well in school. It was my bit of hope and I wanted all my hard work to pay off. With this loss, I’m suicidal again…

Since I did so horribly and now had to repeat three courses for my next term, I decided to temporarily withdraw from university. I wanted to fix myself so that I wouldn’t make the same mistakes again. I believe part of the reason I did so bad was that I went to a shitty high school that underprepared me. But I have bigger problems… I have clinical depression and anxiety issues. I’m a maladaptive perfectionist… These mental health problems hugely impact my studying.

So my plan was to return to UW for CS after fixing and improving myself. Enter my toxic and controlling parents. They don’t want me to back to doing CS, especially my mom. They don’t think I’m good enough. My dad blames my failure on me. I’m too lazy. I’m not trying hard enough. God forbid my failure was perhaps linked to their years of abuse which gave birth to my mental health issues.  

They want me to go into nursing. Ryerson nursing. They want me to live at home and be a commuter. I might as well just kill myself now. I don’t want to be a nurse. I don’t think I’d be good a being a nurse. Although I am empathetic and compassionate, I don’t like people that much. I’m also an introvert. I don’t think I have enough energy to be a nurse. When I try to picture myself as a nurse, I see misery. But they don’t care. They think if I go to become a nurse, I’m guaranteed a job.
Also… I don’t want to live another 4-5 years with my family. I hate them. I am the scapegoat and the outcast. I need to get away from them. But I don’t have the resources. I don’t have money. And I am ill. But who gives a damn if I’m ill, because society (and my family) thinks mental illnesses are sad excuses to be “lazy”.

I took the time off to study and attempt to cure my mental issues, but I find myself too wrapped up in anxiety to do anything productive at all. It doesn’t help that the tuition for UW CS is ~$10k/year. And then the living costs… 

“Get a job!” you say. But there are problems with that too.  First of all, I’d need to make money before I move out. That means I have to continue to live with my abusive family until I make enough money. If I want to get out asap, I’d have to work full-time. But I need to dedicate a lot of time to studying too. It doesn’t help that I have depression which keeps my energy levels at a burnt out low. I am always tired and exhausted, mentally and physically, every fucking day. But who cares because my pain is invisible, right? It’s not like you’d yell at a cancer patient that they’re lazy for not getting a job.

I only have five more months till fall term begins again.

I don’t know what to do.

I should also mention that my parents threatened to cut off all support if I choose to go back to UW for CS. They’ve given me an ultimatum, typical of toxic parents. And the tuition is freaking expensive (at least here in Canada). Also, I’d need to make my own arrangements for moving out and getting all my stuff into my new place. They will pretty much be disowning me.

I am already $6k in debt cause of my first term… I need to somehow pay OSAP back soon.

I only have one close friend who is also my boyfriend.

I want to die.

Help.

TL;DR Abusive parents gave me an ultimatum – they’ll cut of all support if I don’t do as they say. I have mental health issues and lack resources. I feel like I’m at a dead end and should just kill myself.

I think my problem is studying not effectively. If anyone would like to give some advice on studying more efficiently?

Thanks

Overall she was fine. Probably a bad bruise on her wrist if not a broken wrist. But it very easily could have ended in tragedy.

We also recognize that there was no malicious intent behind the actions of the students involved.  Co-op students and student projects involved with Formula SAE will still get credit for their work during the term.

Despite the what the haters say, Waterloo has a lot of great looking ladies. However I realized that they are definitely not as easy to approach as girls I met in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal or LA. The worst was when I went to Firehall on Wednesday and I approached a girl who was sitting at a table and texting on her phone. Without bothering to look up, she told me to ""get the fuck out my face"". Really kind of ruined my night. And all the dudes I've been talking to are either too afraid to approach or they never go out (nothing wrong with that of course).
If any girl's reading this, I want to say that I understand if you have high standard, but please turn the guys down gently. Rejection is never great to swallow, so at least soften the blow a little bit. 
If any guy's reading this, I get it that you want to focus on your career and school work (I'm an engineer myself). But it's important to go out and meet people and have relationships. 
Of course my perspective can be very skewered since I've only hung out with a fraction of the school, but it's just my two cents.

The Registrar's Office, at some point in the past, purchased a timetabling software that costs enough money that the price isn't listed on [the website](http://www.infosilem.com/theschedulingpeople/). They went ahead with a lot of planning work, hoping to implement the new scheduling system by Spring 2013. The project was delayed, however, based on concerns from the upper level that there wasn't enough student feedback on the system.

There wasn't.

Thankfully, the Registrar's Office got the hint, and now they're looking for student feedback on timetabling, so that they can show that the new system really is an improvement and that students will like it better. Based on the numbers I've heard, this is correct, and I would like to see this project come to fruition because I think it will improve students' timetables. But right now, nobody knows for absolute sure. The Registrar's Office is looking for feedback from students, and wants to know what questions to ask so that they can tweak parameters to produce a schedule that's as close to ideal as they can get.

**What I'm asking you to do:** Think about the things that you would like to see in scheduling, and think about what questions you might want to be asked. Some examples:

* What is your favourite time of day for classes?
* What is your least favourite time of day for classes?
* What is the largest number of consecutive hours of class that you would like to have?
* What is the largest number of hours of class in a day that you would like to have?

If you can think of any questions along these lines, or other questions **that the Registrar's Office can ask students in a survey**, please post them here!

Am I the only one that thinks that this is a stupid idea?

Banning the sale of bottles of water will only result in an inconvenience for students rather than promote a better lifestyle which includes recycling and consuming less.

I just think banning anything is a bad idea in general. **In general** the same people who think banning things/actions are the same people whom if raised under different ideals/beliefs would be the ones banning weed, alcohol or even certain races from certain places.

The same ideology, since these people think they know what's best but also think that everyone else is too stupid to change therefore the only solution to save them is to ban those things that might harm them.

This is a small project I've been working on called [CourseMeter](http://www.coursemeter.com).

I decided to make it because I noticed that there aren't many resources to turn to when trying to decide on what courses to choose at enrollment time.

1346856951.0	ze8jf	VOTE tomorrow!	andechs	25	6	34	"Voting is happening tomorrow!

As many student on the subreddit are new residents of Waterloo, here's a couple tips on how to vote:

**WHERE TO VOTE**

If you are living in residence right now, you can vote in the SLC Great Hall [map for the froshies](https://uwaterloo.ca/map/#)

If you're not on campus, look up your polling place [here](http://faq.elections.on.ca/faq/performsearch.do?type1QuestionId=1)

**WHAT TO BRING**

Most people do not change their polling place from their ""family home""... despite the fact that you are now spending the majority of your time in Waterloo (at least 8 months a year; and with co-op, you can be spending as little as 2 weeks a year at home).

As a result, you will not be registered to vote in the Kitchener/Waterloo riding -- but that's not a problem.

*YOU NEED*

If you are an eligible elector (Canadian citizen over 18 years of age living in the riding), bring one piece of identification that includes both your name and residential address (doesn't even need a picture).

If you just moved into residence, you may not have these things. You can always AFFIRM that you are a resident of KW, and bring some sort of photo ID showing where you're from. 

According to the website, you need a registered voter to vouch for you (ask your Dons); but according to the Ontario Elections Act, you can actually vote sans any form of ID if you sign several affadavits, say some oaths, and affirm that you are a valid voter (I do this every year on principle)

**WHY IT MATTERS**

This riding has historically been very close:

* In the last provincial election, the winning candidate only won by ~4000 votes.
* In the last federal election, the winning candidate only won by ~2000 votes.

Polls have declared each major candidate this election as a likely victor (Lib, PC, NDP) -- this election will be a very close one.

**POSSIBLE OUTCOMES?**

* Lib win: Liberals now have a majority. *BIG FUCKING DEAL*
* PC win: Increased support for Tim Hudack's platform, which IMO is fucking crazy
* NDP win: Pretty much nothing happens; except a show of support of the NDPs request during the Liberals last budget to impose a surtax of 2% on income over $500,000... seems reasonable, bringing the total tax load to 49.5% for those making more than half a million

**IN CLOSING -- VOTE!**

Everyone should try to vote tomorrow. And you should probably vote NDP :)

Or research the issues yourself. Feel free to take a look at each party's extremely nebulous platforms on the web.

    ======================================================

**Edit1:** I just went to vote and the returning officer informed my that Elections Ontario changed the voting rules for this by-election to prevent out-of-riding voters 

I was told it is not adequate to merely have proof of identification and affirm an oath for my proof of address... despite having done this in the past 3 elections we have had.  A lease agreement or having a registered voter at the same polling station vouch for you is sufficient.

We filmed a ton of it on UW campus (and elsewhere in K-W), so you guys might recognize a lot of the locations, and maybe even some of the UW students that were in it.

We never got any money for it or anything, and basically just did it because it was fun and a good learning experience (just so you don't think we're spamming).

**Bike on the correct side of the road.**
Its great now that its summer a bunch of people have pulled out their bicycles to travel around Waterloo. But come on, bike on the correct side of the road. I almost hit two people yesterday because they were in the bike lane on the wrong side of the road. I didn't have problems like this even biking during the winter! Your bike counts as a vehicle, you still have to obey the law.

While we're on this...

**Bike on the road, get off the sidewalk.**
Its very annoying to have to get out of the way of cyclists when I'm walking along on the sidewalk. Seriously, the road is smoother, and you can go much faster (road is smoother despite potholes). Not to mention the Waterloo bylaw saying *not* to bike on the sidewalk. If you're too scared to bike on the road, then walk or take the bus. Nobody gets to drive their cars on the sidewalk ""because they're too scared to use the road"".

**Use some form of turn signals.**
Again, you count as a vehicle under the Highway Traffic Act, indicate where you are turning! Get in the correct lane, wait your turn, and go. Making a left turn? Don't just stay in the bike lane, then zip across the pedestrian cross walk, you are going to freak out the cars around you.

And last for you bicyclists...

**WEAR A HELMET.** Just do it. What's the deal with nearly everyone not wearing one? Oh, are you not ""as cool"" with one? Sure, you don't get that ""free riding"", wind in your hair feeling, but is risking your brain worth it? 

...And to those walking around on campus...

**Look before stepping out onto the road!** Just because you don't hear a car doesn't mean that someone isn't coming. More times than I care to think have I almost hit people because they'll just step out onto the road without looking. Of course, after they step out, some of them look, see me heading towards them, and just freeze there!"	t5_2rb5s	True

1320676283.0	m3il6	Is anyone interested in digitizing room locations on campus?	kolafson	28	8	38	"A team of env/geo students have been digitizing room locations on campus as part of a project that maps routes between rooms.  The web app they are developing will give you shortest path between 2 rooms, with options for indoor or outdoor travel.  

Half of the rooms on campus have been digitized, but the other half remains to be done.  A student who has done a great deal of digitizing estimates that it would take one person about 60 hours to digitize the rest of the rooms on campus (with the exemption of residence rooms for security reasons).  

I am very interested in this data as I think it would come in handy for the next version of the uWaterloo central events site.  I've heard some great ideas from student developers for other apps that could use this data so I know I'm not alone.  

I would like to organize an event to gather a bunch of people in a geo lab and get the rest of the rooms digitized quickly.  I sent an email out on the uWaterloo Open Data mailing list but didn't get much response.  If enough people show an interest, we could probably convince the geo-experts to get things ready for volunteers to come in and quickly add the new points.  No experience is required to digitize the room locations, people could be brought up to speed on the process very quickly.

I know there are some very talented software developers on this campus, if useful data is made available to them, impressive apps will follow.  If you are interested in campus data for application development, please check out the [Open Data Initiative website](http://opendata.uwaterloo.ca).

**EDIT:** *I am going to get a list of times with lots of available lab workstations, then we can determine what works best for everyone. I will msg people who indicated their interest when I have more information. I'm hoping to organize something in the 2nd half of November as I know that everyone will be too busy with exams come December.*

**EDIT 2:** *The event should be happening next week.  You can [sign up here](http://goo.gl/WBntJ) and we will send you a list of possible event times.  We will go ahead with the time that works for the most people.  I will msg the people who indicated their interest directly.*

Here are a few things I kept in mind that helped lavished my first year with unforgettable memories:

1) EVERYONE is on the same boat as you (they don't know anyone here either). They are looking for the same thing. Treat everyone like you are their first friend EVER.

2) Forget who you were in high school. No one here knows who you were and they don't have to know. That chapter of your life is done...you can be who you are around people here, it is safe.

3) Don't limit yourself to one social circle. You may be inclined to stick with the first friends you met and clicked with but this is so if there is ever a falling out within the group social dynamics, you will always have other circles to belong to. I don't mean to ignore your old group but don't commit to the drama-rama. Be the one associated with the good times, who's always leading the group to meet new friends and try new things.

4) Be neutral with the girls you meet...they are neither superior nor inferior to you. By this I mean, don't portray yourself in a way that will make them think 'all this guy wants is to get laid'. The message you want to send to girls you first meet is **'I just like to have a good time, I don't care who it is with.'** The easiest way to get girls chasing you is to have 'buzz'. Once they hear people talking about you and how interesting the stories they have about you, your work is 90% done. 

5) Don't drink before you try weed.

6) Devote at least 20 minutes each day to work (20 minutes is nothing and you will soon realize you will have to put in more hours but this is to get you started). This will be by far the most difficult thing in first year...way above making new friends and getting laid. 

7) Work out. Any way you can. Join intramural house teams. Buy a pull up bar (25$) and make an effort to do a few reps every time you walk in and out of your room.

One of our daughters just turned 17, is in grade 11, and is thinking about following my mid-life career switch and [becoming an actuary.](http://beanactuary.org)  Universities are **insanely** expensive down here, so there's a good chance she'll go back to Canada for school.  And, of course, Waterloo has an excellent reputation, including in its actuarial science programs.

Our daughter also has autism.  She's very high-functioning, most people who know her have no clue that she's autistic unless we tell her, and as long as she has enough ""alone"" time and space she generally does very well.  However, of course, going away to university is **different**, y'know?  But on the other hand, Waterloo's rep as Canada's go-to geek school suggests to me that she might not be alone there.

So, any students or alumni or faculty or other staff: How ""friendly"" is UWaterloo to students with autism?  Are there noticeable numbers of students ""on the spectrum"" there, esp. in the math faculty?  Any students or alumni (or faculty?) here on [/r/uwaterloo](/r/uwaterloo) who **are** on the autism spectrum and can share their experiences?  Are there good student support services?  Any other observations or bits of information that might help us?

I might need to enlist WatSFic for a DM willing to take on a group, because there are way too many people for me to handle on my own. That said, I want everyone to be able to play, especially if you are new to D&amp;amp;D, so message me your email address and availability if you are interested and I'll do all I can to make sure everyone gets to play!**

Edit 3: WatSFic meeting on Wednesday, I'll be sending out emails once I know what's going on. We have enough players for three groups of five, but if we get more interest, we can expand that. All depends on DM availability though, so we may have more smaller groups or fewer larger groups. 

I'm looking to run a D&amp;amp;D (4e or Pathfinder) campaign this term (and longer if possible) for 4-6 players. I've run one campaign before but my players have all left for the summer, so I'm looking for a new group. New players are more than welcome (I'm relatively new myself, so I'd love to learn together) and nobody is expected to buy anything in preparation (I'll have dice, tokens, character sheets and the rules books). 

If anyone is interested, sessions would be weekly (or more if we have the time and willingness) and everyone would be expected to come on time to every session (I understand its not always possible and it's alright if you have to miss a session once in a while, but I'd like committed players, not someone who *plans* to only attend once in a while).

We'd likely be playing at my place, but I can see if we can get a room in MC if that works better for everyone. Feel free to ask questions or check out /r/DnD. If interested, post here or PM me.

Thanks!

What we've got planned for this term:

* Weekly Lessons and tutorials, designed to help you build an application from the ground up.

* Dev Nights, where you can come and code, using what you've learned. You can get help from experts as well!

* Competitions. Many local companies want to sponser competitions. Win great prizes, and show off your talents to people that want to hire you!

Either way, we have something for everyone. If you want to make the next great app, we can help. If you want to use these skills to get a job, we can help. (A self-made mobile application is like employer crack.) If you just want to learn something new, and make something cool and useful, we can help you with that, too! Our goal is to get more people making these apps, and take people from no experience to making their own apps in a single term. 

Check out our [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/248346078606907/) for more information. If you want to get on our learning or competition mailing lists, PM me! Website coming soon! Questions? Post them in the comments!"	t5_2rb5s	True

*Update - February 8, 2012


I am sitting right next to him, first time I actually sat down and observed him. For people who don't know who this man is I will add picture later on, there is also an old post with pictures as well. 
-Every time he tees off (in the game) his hands jitter. It's wierd, but it's online golf how can it not make you quiver with excitement.
-He also drank a medium coffee (the old timmy medium size), I guess to make sure he still has his focus when making that birdie putt.

-I'm noticing cupcakes of some sort. Probably carrot cupcakes.... nice choice.  
- He is out of coffee and has moved on to clementines. He has eaten 3 so far. He loves clementines, as soon as he peels them he puts them whole in his mouth, truly remarkable. I guess it's a healthier version of gamer fuel, kudos to him for taking the natural way.

*Update - February 8, 2012


seems that iconwealth (see his comment in the post) gave me the ultimate task of figuring out which game he is playing. I feel that it is not safe to make contact so early.
-Just my luck, he went to the garbage to dispose of the skin of the mutilated clementines he devoured. I had only a few seconds, but with haste I managed to figure out the game that entices him so. WORLD GOLF TOUR. *Link below this point. Who knows how many countless hours he has clocked in.

Even if you're not using Windows right now, or don't plan on switching to Windows 8, you should at least sign on and grab CD keys for everything (you can do this without downloading the disc image). That's what I did; I don't plan on using Windows 8 or XP, but why not grab 2 CD keys for each of them (32-bit and 64-bit) just in case?

Just a reminder for those who are graduating to grab it while they can.

Also, that Dreamspark download site allows you to view your product key and download the product for two years after first ""purchasing"" it; however, it appears as though after those two years, you can re-""purchase"" the same product and get a different product key! I got Windows 7 in my second year, and just recently got it again and received new product keys. Four Windows 7 product keys in all for free isn't bad (again, two 32-bit and two 64-bit).

So first-years might want to grab keys now so they can double up in 3rd/4th year."	t5_2rb5s	True

I wouldn't normally care, but I have a midterm tomorrow that I could have put more time into studying for and a midterm next Wednesday that I'll have to study less for because of this. It seems really unfair because if we had screwed up, they'd just give us a 0, but if the school does it, they don't really do anything about it. I looked under policy 70 and it says:

""A grievance can allege such things as: [...] the instructor deviated substantially from the course outline without reasonable notice""

That seems to fit this situation, but I'm not sure if it's actually worth going through this process because I have a ton of midterms this week and next week and I'm not sure how they could rectify the situation. It seems unlikely that they'll let me write it (or even make a decision) this week, and it seems less likely that they'll delay it into the future or take marks off the exam.

It seems like I'm stuck here, but if anyone has any stories about doing this and how it went, that would help me make a decision about whether or not this is worth doing. I know it's only an intro class, but my other classes are upper year ones and I don't want those to get affected by this really stupid situation.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I appreciate the input everyone. I've decided I'm not going to file a grievance; I'd rather put that time towards studying for my other midterms."	t5_2rb5s	True

March 30, starting now (1pm) until I get tired or I run out of stuff:

I got a box of goodies from Reddit today [because we won the Grow a College Subreddit Competition last year](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/11/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html) - at that time I was a moderator. I'm giving away some stickers and lots of candy in upstairs SLC (one level above ground level).

Look for the /r/uwaterloo logo! I'm trying to keep it low-key so you won't see any giant banners (I did receive one) or tables, just me sitting quietly.

Yes, I'm doing this on a short notice, but this late to the term I don't think I can participate in a meetup. Don't worry, there's more stuff to give out if you guys ever have a proper meetup (and I'll make sure it gets handed to someone before I graduate)

* 1:30: If you don't see me, try again in 5 minutes, I'm probably just taking a break. When I actually leave, I'll update this post

* 2:00: I'm sitting near the elevator on upper floor SLC. Walk up the stairs and turn left.

* 2:15: [How I feel about the sour candy](http://i.imgur.com/g9GLg.jpg)

* 4:00: Still here, still plenty left.

* 4:30: CSClub stopped by and grabbed a bunch for their ""sticker bin"".. and lot of candy. I'm also expecting POETS regulars to show up. I handed out about half of stuff I had (stickers and candy). About 50 stickers left!

* 4:45 Only one reddit alien sticker, and 30~40 ""My name is"" stickers left. Still plenty of candies to go around. I think I'll stick around until 5:30.

* 5:30 I'm about to leave. I still have some stickers and lots of candy left. I'll try to do the same on Monday (after 3:30pm), but I probably can't stay that long.  I'll do another post so check back next week! Thanks for stopping by guys.

We also are having small raffles throughout the day, for some smaller prizes including Dota 2 beta keys, gift cards, and much, much more. You'll get tickets by simply showing up and sticking around for a while. We also provide pizza and pop for a lunch and dinner option.

So I'm a really shy and awkward person, and I know many others that are like me. I've read lots of posts on omguw about people that were lonely and suicidal and ones that have graduated without having any friends at all.

I've realized the only time that I've made any friends, was during the orientation week, that they forced us to interact and engage in group activities (but then my friends all moved back to their hometowns cause they're not in co-op like me).

Anyways, what I have in mind is a club, with only the purpose of meeting the new people, making friends. I know people meet and make friends in classrooms, gyms, clubs, or bars. But this is specifically for shy, awkward people who can't just walk to someone else and start a conversation and make friends with them. This is like a glue, that forces people to interact with each other and perhaps not feel lonely. 

I don't even know what kind of activities it would involve, it's more like just a club to make friends.

I attended Canada 3.0 (for work purposes) and when I read this article today, it got me thinking about the amazing PR machine we have at work here in KW. As a UW student, sometimes I wonder if we are just overselling ourselves and our ""startups"" environment. Are we so fragile and scared about BlackBerry imploding that we're willing to overtalk a bunch of self-entitled ""entreprenuers""? (ie copy ideas from others).

There are plenty of startups in the ecosystem but they are being ignored because they're not part of the circle jerk that we have around here. That is, startups that are eager to get on VCs get priority of notice over startups that go bootstrap and are actually profitable.

Another point was David Crowe's recent article: http://startupnorth.ca/2013/05/09/hot-shit-list-2013/?__lsa=d992-e7b0

As you go down this list, you will notice something very interesting - significant % are companies who've been in the business for atleast 4-5 years (ie TribeHr, FreshBooks, KiK, VidYard, Fongo) heck even 10 years for some: what is up with companies trying to brand themseleves as startups to justify their poor economic performance?

1355808712.0	151dvk	Pink Tie Calculators and You	JodoYodo	20	5	19	"Wanted to make this post because of my experience proctoring exams.

The math faculty policy is that pink-tie calculators are the only ones allowed on exams, if calculators are allowed at all.  This means the ones listed [here](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/calculator-regulation).  I'm not going to say that the pink-tie sticker system is great or even good, but they're the rules so I advise you abide by them.

Specifically, we have a black-list of calculators (the ones at the bottom of the list), plus guidelines for what calculators we shouldn't allow.  If your calculator can store functions or has an ability to integrate functions, it's probably not allowed.  Whether this is fair or not is between you and your course coordinator, but be aware that we have caught students who use banned calculators.  I have personally seen cases where either a student used a calculator that did not have a sticker, or had transplanted a legitimate sticker onto a banned calculator. The latter case constitutes academic fraud and can be taken quite seriously.

I know that not all course instructors care about this, but it's better to play it safe and use an approved calculator.  Using a banned calculator on a final can be interpreted as cheating, and claiming ignorance is not a valid defence.

I just wanted to follow-up with the survey from 3 weeks ago:
http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/w3oku/hey_guys_i_need_your_help_with_something_really/

Thank you to everyone who responded and up-voted. I wanted to share some of the results. Here is a short presentation on some of the main findings (not our presentation):

The main finding that we used in our marketing presentation, was the surprising fact that 85% of the respondents need excellent customer service.

CaseProtag	28	12	103	"I don't necessarily mean FEDS, the level of education, or any of the services in particular (feel free to reference them), but mainly: what do you think of the university's cohesive nature? What works? What definitely doesn't? Frequenting  r/uwaterloo, I've noticed people have some insightful things to say about the nature of the school and the students. What do you think? Is there a disconnect between the faculties? Is the school shaped by its most popular programs, or the history of its blue-collar reputation? What do you think about the university's effect on the infrastructure of the city and the tech companies? Is the landscape too hilly? Do the students and clubs over-use memes? Are there too many parking lots/not enough? Anything really. I also wonder what people think about student's expectations for the university (we've all heard each other complain). How do you think they're unrealistic? I know we all have an idea of the school, but what is it!? 

Please include your specs (i.e. Bio 3B), as well as anything else that you think makes your opinion biased (other universities attended, etc.).

Not sure what makes me more uneasy, the fact that this Jobkill thing hasn't been scrutinized by any papers or organizations (there's literally nothing online about them) or that there are already 3x as many UW students signed up for it than other Universities in the region.

I've been at this school for 2 years now.  At the beginning in year 1a I did reasonably well, but nothing exceptional (70-something average, as would be expected from a public high school graduate).  In my second term, this is where things start to go wrong, I dropped 2 courses and re-took one over the summer break (prereq for half my courses the following term).  At this point (~1/3 of the way through the winter term) I started talking to counseling services and really got nowhere, mostly because I believe I suck at expressing my problems.

From the end of my 1a term and still ongoing, I've been losing focus on life and not able to study properly, socialize properly, in fact, do anything properly.  I've become what could effectively be described as a train wreck.  My outlook on life sucks, I spend egregious amounts of time on the internet, and hardly feel motivated anymore (hell... I can barely find the pleasure in fapping anymore).  I have highs every now and then, but they are short lived as I remember how much of a fuck-up I am.

Basically, I need someone to talk to (beyond CS), because there is no fucking way I alone can get myself together and get my life back on track. (I don't want to try any of that self-diagnosis bullshit because I am not qualified/experienced in psychology) Is there anyone out there who could point me in a direction please?

At the same time, I don't find too many people in my class who share my interests.

I can usually find time to go outside, toss a disc with a couple of my friends, go grab dinner, etc. but I feel like the connections and the crowds that I'm used to are all gone. Back in first year, I'd basically have limitless people to hang out with whenever I was free. Now, it feels like there's so few people around... I've no idea where to start in terms of finding people to hang with, now that I'm in third year and out of residence. Does anyone have any ideas?

1301876514.0	ghxyx	This is a PSA for those who take the GRT.	Mackinstyle	24	8	39	"A few things I want to say with regard to fellow students who ride the bus.

1. When you get on the bus, move to the back. You're not Rosa Parks. When you stand right at the front, you make everyone who has to get on move around you and it makes everyone hate you.

2. When the bus is busy in the morning, move to the fucking back! I have begun simply pushing you jerks with my backpack the way I would a big compost bag of autumn leaves. There's more room at the back and if you don't take the opportunity to be courteous to others, myself and others will make you.

3. You know those magical doors at the back that are no longer push-operated? How stupid are so many of you? I see this day after day and it drives me mental. There are three little components at the top. One of them transmits (likely IR) radiation and the other two sense it being reflected back.  They work when you put your hand in the way to reflect the signal. The more you put in the way, the easier it will work. So skinny chicks, don't get so passive aggressive when they're not working. Hold your arm sideways under them or maybe use your backpack.  Wave back and forth too in case you're missing it. Do not push on them and do not look toward the bus driver in total distress. They're not going to help you; only laugh at how you're a University student and you can't operate a door.

That is all for this week.

This has been a PSA."	t5_2rb5s	True

1336202312.0	t83la	I need help - What should I do in this situation?	tankurr11	15	1	7	"Few weeks ago, my mom found a job working as cleaning staff in UW (through Kijiji). Her contacts are Serbian contractors and she worked two days for them, cleaning UWP. It was hard work (cleaning UWP after people have moved out...) and my mom ended up breaking a tumor in her belly so she couldn't return to work after two days. 

After letting them know of her condition, she asked for two days worth of wage, but they told her to call them back - and now they're not even picking up. She says shes scared to actually go talk to them or anything because apparently the contractors' crew had a bunch of heavily tattoo'd Serbian dudes (not trying to discriminate, moms just tend to be scared of these things). So here I am.

Hiring was done over phone and she didn't sign a contract so I don't have a proof to show anyone. UWaterloo likely won't take any responsibility for contractors' actions either. I do go to UWaterloo, a 4th year student in fact, and it pisses me off to know that my school is hiring contractors like these. I just want to know if there is anything I can do to let UW know that they hired a shady contractor who doesn't pay their staff properly. 

So I'm looking for - Phone numbers, email addresses, people I can book an appointment with, whatever. Hopefully someone at school cares."	t5_2rb5s	True
1336078443.0	t5p0d	Bike Stolen on Campus Today - Reward Offered	superkraan	17	4	21	"I locked my bike in front of the Math 3 this morning around 11:30 and by the time I left at 3:45 it was gone.  I couldn't even find the lock to see if it was cut off, but I filed a report with campus police immediately and looked all over to see if it had been moved but it hadn't.

This bike is extremely valuable to me as it is both my main form of transportation, along with one of my favourite recreational activities.  I am offering a reward of $50 to anyone who provides me with any information that leads to its recovery.

It is a hardtail (i.e. only front suspension) mountain bike with a Rockshox Pike suspension fork.  The frame is a Brodie Bigshot (written in graffiti script) and it is black and a metallic brownish colour with a few white details.  The rear tire is a full-blown mountain bike tire (i.e. knobs in the middle of the tread) and the front tire is a hybrid with the middle of the tread being smooth, like a road bike tire.  It also has Avid hydraulic disc brakes. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this bike is the grips, as they are a shiny, metallic gold colour on the ends, and red in the middle.  I have never even seen another Brodie Bigshot frame in KW, let alone one that is built up similar to mine, so if you think you may have seen it, chances are you have.

If you have any information regarding the whereabouts of my bike or even the person who stole it, please PM me!"	t5_2rb5s	True

What are the chances that in that 2 hour time frame, someone with such low moral value would walk into the room?

Let's get serious here; it isn't the newest phone on the market. It isn't in mint condition anymore, and hey, look at that, it has an entire phone book full of my contacts who could help get the phone back to me.

Hell, if you hadn't turned it off, or took the simcard out, I would have called you within 2 hours of you finding it sitting there. You could have even just tossed it in some office on campus, and I would have found it just fine. But no. You decided you needed that phone.

My boyfriend bought that phone for me for my 21st birthday, and it means more to me than you could even understand.

I figured that the following questions would be a simple way to see what people think about the program so I'd appreciate it if anyone wouldn't mind sharing their experiences.

----

**High school average:** 

**Advanced Functions mark:** 

**Calculus and Vectors mark:** 

**Based on this, how comfortable do you feel with the program?** 

**Any other comments:**

----

Sorry if that's a bit much, I'm just trying to get a feel of what people think since UW CS is ""supposed to be"" great and the admissions people are obviously going to make the course seem like it's the best thing in the world, so it's not entirely accurate in the way that it's trying to attract you.

Thanks."	t5_2rb5s	True

1322683468.0	mv3w7	Why don't we pay equal fees for extra courses?	eastlog	19	5	25	"We all know that people in different programs pay different tuition fees. This has always been justified by the school by the fact that some departments require more money than other. For example the engineering department needs more money to fund its classes and support its labs than the Arts department. This would justify the higher tuition during a academic term  but I fail to see how this justification could be used for extra courses taken during a coop or off term.

A student in Engineering taking ENGL 101 in a non-academic term would have to pay $1127. An Arts student sitting in the exact same class would have to pay $611. If these are both extra courses any hidden fees hidden in the course price to offset department costs shouldn't be needed. It is costing the school the exact same price for each student to take the course but one student is paying almost twice as much.

TL;DR: Some students are required to pay higher course fees for no reason.

Edit: Put in price for engineers"	t5_2rb5s	True

I was curious as to what were your experiences at UW like? How do you think UW compares to American schools like MIT?

Also, do you think there are a lot of negative stereotypes that UW doesn't deserve? One that comes to mind for me personally is that UW girls are ugly. When I came to campus to visit, this was definitely not the case. There were so many hot (asian) girls in math =).

1375812943.0	1jtrif	Computer Science New Grad, first salary negotiation	donglo2	26	13	53	"I've never done any salary negotiation for co-op terms because the process was too quick and I'm not exactly sure what to do now. I also have two competing offers so I'm not sure how having a second offer that the company knows all the details about would affect the salary negotiation (e.g. If they think they're matching the other company, can you still ask for more?)


Company A wants to give me a base salary of $90,000 with a company bonus that they say is usually around 20% but not guaranteed so they say this is basically like getting $108,000 (but it could be as low as 0%).

Company B wants to give me a base salary of $105,000.

I'd rather work for Company A. Company A already knows about the salary from Company B and they used that knowledge to decide on their own offer. They also use the average salary of new grads (but I have a lot of internship experience), the value of the company, and other salaries in that area to make this decision.

I feel uncomfortable choosing Company A with such a big difference in the guaranteed salary but they seem like they'd be open to negotiation. What's a reasonable amount I should ask for from Company A so I can get the highest base salary that they're willing to give?

Can I even ask for more since technically $108000 &gt; $105000? Do I have to give reasons or can I say that's just what I want? I'm not sure what reasons they'd want.

**EDIT 1:**

I looked at my offer from Company B and it mentions something about a bonus but it doesn't say anything about percentages.

Does it sound reasonable to ask Company B about what this bonus usually amounts to or what percentages they've had in the past and then use that when asking for a higher base from Company A?

**EDIT 2:**

Company B emailed me that the last time they gave a bonus (which they do twice a year), ""half of the people got over 35%"".  I have to call Company B some time today- should I ask for the average or something else or is the statistic they gave me enough?

So based on this, what's the optimal amount I should ask for from Company A? Or should I just mention that piece of information and not give a figure? Or should I just mention a figure and not give that information... do I need that information to justify asking for more or can I just say they have a similar bonus program?

**UPDATE**

I took Company A's offer for $95,000 with company bonus around 20%"	t5_2rb5s	True

Generally, at least in the Math faculty, the final grade that you see on Learn is probably not the final grade you will get on Quest.  Between Learn and Quest, the TAs, course instructors, and course coordinators will usually do adjustments to your marks, typically on a spreadsheet.

That includes things like promised formula changes (""We will shift the weight of your midterm to your final if you do better on it etc""), curving (i.e. bumping everyone's mark up so that the average is acceptable), and removing excused marks (i.e. when a student has a doctor's note).  Additionally (and this is at the instructor's discretion), we often bump people from a 46-49 to a 50.

We cancelled our September Pitch Night because there was a lack of applications. We're hoping uWaterloo students might have some awesome ideas worth $1000.

To get the money is simple: apply [here](http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/submissions/new) by October 3rd (be sure to select the Kitchener-Waterloo Chapter). You will get an invitation to come to our Pitch Night (at the Little Bean Cafe in Kitchener) for October 10. You give a 5-minute speech just to sell your idea, and then the trustees (the folks who put up their own money to make the $1000 grant) then decide who gets the main prize. 

There is also an audience-choice prize of $200 as well, so even if you don't want to submit an idea, please come out to the Pitch Night October 10 at 7:00 pm at the Little Bean and you can help vote on a winner.

Previous winners were The Secret Gardener (a Guerrilla Gardener in KW), The Smile Epidemic, and the Berlin Shorts film competition. 

Most importantly: your idea doesn't have to have a value of $1000 (sometimes it's a lot higher, sometimes it's a lot lower), we just have to feel that it is worth $1000 to the KW community.

This is the beginning of a larger project and we'd like to hear some feedback and suggestions from the UW Reddit community! 

At the end of December, Imprint’s Editor-in-Chief did an AMA here and digital distribution through NFC (near-field communication) was one of the topics that came up. A little over a week ago, we installed a pilot project incorporating NFC and QR codes at 10 locations around campus.

Check out Ron’s column introducing the intiative: http://uwimprint.ca/article/2955-can-i-beam-you-a-copy

In the first week of digital distribution, there were 24 NFC downloads and 19 QR downloads. We realise that these numbers are very small for UW’s population, and we want to grow that while enhancing the service to be something people will continue to use. 

People on all types of smartphones – iPhones, Androids, Blackberrys – are using digital distribution with the posters. 

We are Sam Nabi (/u/samnabi), Wil Meloche (/u/wmeloche), and Ron Kielstra (/r/bruvark) and we'll be around for the next few hours. Ask us anything!

Recently, I've felt that the quality of education at UW has been in decline. 

Before making a stink about this at school, I'd like to hear what you have to say and to see if there is anybody with similar feelings. I'll give some specific examples below. 

**Testing in larger classes is about efficiency and not about testing understanding of material.**

Marking tests quickly is [somewhat] important, but it's absurd to cram a few hundred people into the lecture hall and have us write the test while the grad students patrol for cheaters. Furthermore, the tests are almost exclusively scantron; to avoid marking. And done during class time; to avoid using another room and to avoid having the prof/T.A doing marking during office hours. I'll also note, that some classes have done away with final exams for the same reasons above.  

**Reduced materials in some labs.** 

I've only done biology labs, so I'll only comment on those. And to make it clear, I realize that there are some lab techniques that can only be shown to undergrads through demonstration or not all (too dangerous or extremely expensive). However, even some of the cheaper experiments have been folded into the ""observation"" only category or the number of students per group has been increased (4 students to do a 1 or 2 person experiment). 

Is this what we are paying for? 


I have some other complaints, but I'll leave those two for starters. If I'm the only one who feels this way, then I'll take my throwaway account and throw it away. Otherwise, I'd like to make a record of these complaints. 

**tl;dr: Has UW jumped the shark?**

The Faculty of Environment, AHS, Engineering and quite a few others are already using the system.  

We are currently in the process of adding the webform module to the profile, which will let site owners make forms on their sites.  As a part of this process, we want to make sure that all access to forms is redirected to https. At some point in the process, we started to ask ourselves ""why just do this for forms, why not do it at the server level for all content""?  

The most common objection is that it is a big CPU hit, but this isn't really the case any more (more true 14 years ago when computers were slower).  When gmail switched to https, they only reported a 1-2% performance difference.  Most other objections have all been found to be outdated or not relevant to our setup; except for two.

 - Sites that need to embed 3rd party content that can't be delivered over https will end up with those messages saying that ""not all the content on this page is secure"".  

I don't think that this will happen often, since most of the popular 3rd party content providers already offer up https (youtube for instance).  

 - Some sysadmins may block https on company websites. 

Shouldn't these people just be fired?  They're forcing employees to make less secure connections to the outside world.  Is this really still a thing that happens? 

Some popular sites have already started auto-redirecting traffic to https (github and twitter) and I get the sense that times are a changin'.. but maybe there is something I am missing.

General questions about phone interviews : 

* How would you start a phone interview ? How do you introduce yourself ? Any tip on phone interviews are appreciated.
* English is not my first language and so I'm kinda awkward on the phone, do you think I should mention that when the interview starts ?

Questions regarding google : 
* Has anyone done a google interview here ? I've seen some posts about the questions they ask, but I assume it's a little different for co-ops. Any suggestions on how to prepare ? What should I be expecting from them to ask ? ( They said it's two 45 minutes interviews back to back. )

* They emailed me asking which location I would prefer. Being an international student I can only pick either Montreal or Kitchener. I'm thinking of picking Kitchener because the office is tiny (less than 100 people) and I'm thinking it'll be easier to show myself there and meet people and therefore possible future jobs there. But then Montreal has the fancy google office. 
Also, kitchener works on mobile products, which is really interesting. But Montreal only works on Chrome and Anti-Malwares.  Which one would you pick if you were me ?

1323969238.0	ndysu	Should I defer my CS245 final?	waterloo_throwaway	14	3	24	"Hi /r/uwaterloo, I created this throwaway account to get some advice regarding my final exams. I am in 2A compsci coop program and doing pretty bad in CS 245 course... I got a 70% for the open book midterm, and I missed two assignments (4% each, but did fairly well for the other 3). I have exam today (15th) for stat, CS 245 on the 17th, Math 136 on the 19th, and CS 246 on the 21st. **The CS 245 final is open book.**

My problem is that if I end up getting around 50%, I would still pass but my average will take a hit, also if I study for it, then I might not have sufficient time to complete my review for Math 136. If I defer this exam to next term, I will for sure get a decent grade for Math 136, but I would have 6 exams, and the prof for CS 245 is different from this years, so I am not sure whether the contents would be the same... So fellow redditors in loo.. what should I do?

I can only work on weekends since I have a different job on the weekdays. I'd like to get a job that isn't too intense and offers some sort of human interaction like waiting tables, etc.. 

Oh by the way, I already graduated so I wouldn't be able to get any campus job that requires you to be a student. I wonder:

- What is the best way to get a part-time job. I used to just randomly distribute my resumes to stores or ask my friends to refer me when I was a high school student 5 years ago.

- Whether I should mention my co-op history or my current job (which is not related to customer service at all) on my resume. I don't have much experience in customer service, but maybe I can learn? You see, from what I remember from PD1 on my first year, I was encouraged to write my work experience whether it was related to the job I applied for or not. It's just a good way to show you have some sort of professional experience interacting with people. Is this the same in this case?"	t5_2rb5s	True
