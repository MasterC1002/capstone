I hear about this game all the time. Last week I decided to embark on a journey into the game. Since then I have created three world and embark into each one once. Today starting my 3rd world I scourged the map for the perfect embark location; Soil, shallow and deep metals, trees and no aquifers. Upon finding it I embarked and choose a prebuild party. aaaaaaaand then I got dropped in the middle of an arctic wasteland.

What gives, that's three times in a row I have painstakingly found a embark and it's dropped me somewhere totally different.

Their force was laughable this time, no bowmen to fight back against the marksdwarf force in my battlements.

The bridges raised, the Giant War Jaguars were released into the courtyard, and the newly trained militia, 30 strong, was stationed in ranks.

They had caught me off guard last time, it would not happen again.

The first row of traps took its toll. Trolls' twine clothes were bloodied, mounts were beheaded, and one unfortunate (and impatient) goblin tried to rush the inner entrance and was hurled 4 z-levels up (and then down) by a closing bridge.

The goblins had sent their war leader this time. An unarmed wrestler in bronze armor.

He made it past the weapons traps before my Captain's named War Leopard was upon him, tearing his arm off before he dodged into a cage.

The militia charged under cover of crossbow bolts and slew the invaders with no casualties. Oh, how sweet it would be to bandage up the goblin war leader and chain him on a 30 z-level high tower for target practice.

Literally a second after that thought, I got the notification:

""GOBOT HAS ARRIVED, A GIANT HARRIER WITH THREE EYES AND A FLESHY SHELL. BEWARE ITS DEADLY DUST.""

Pfft. Three squadrons of talented soldiers, of course I would cut through this over-sized dog like butter.

As my military were pouring down my 3x3 central staircase, the beast was hurtling up. Then it happened.

My staircase (and half my fort) was blasted by the dust. Easily 40 dwarves were now marked as -Paralyzed- on their status screens, and were all bleeding profusely from their orifices.

Within minutes, my entire fort was dead, and I abandoned.

...

My new reclaiming force, the Bells of Retribution, entered the ruins ahead of them.

It would take some work, but the land was still arable, and the pastures would soon be teeming with young livestock.

Then they entered the depths of the fort and saw two dozen green faces grinning at them.

The one-armed goblin had long-since escaped his cage, and was the new master of this fort.

Until a familiar dust began to leak up from the caverns, and we hadn't brought nearly enough axes."	t5_2qyn1	True

Lastly, is there a way to make enter/return/newline characters work as expected in posts/comments?  A single return doesn't seem to do anything, and two or more only does one return.

Do we really need this? I feel like I'm seeing the same post recycled every week. It's always something about killing children, or animals or something. 

The prime example yesterday was [I've started killing newborn infants, but the parents keep getting upset. What do I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/rzkbp/ive_started_killing_newborn_infants_but_the/). The post has two short sentences of content, isn't witty, original or interesting in any way, and yet at the time of writing this it's the fifth most upvoted DF post of all time.

I'd really rather see posts that actually contribute something to the community upvoted - posts that are actually funny, or ironic, or show off some impressive feat of sheer Dorfiness. What do you guys think?

I embarked in a frozen half-haunted region and after one and a half years I've found myself encased in my fortress with 35 dwarves (I buried 146 of them) and under siege by 60 undead including two necromancers. My military has been wiped out and I still don't have any kind of forging set up. Still, it is a bit of a stalemate for now, since they can't come in, I have stable food and drink production and the dwarfs are back to happy.

The biggest problem, I believe, comes from the fact that my miners died outside of the fortress, so I have no picks to dig, but, since I don't have a forge, I can't make any new ones, so I can't get to magma or shroom wood. Am I wrong? What options do I have?

1336994235.0	tmb5w	Released Dwarf Fortress 0.34.08	keenerd	363	52	251	"http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=109434.0

&gt; Here is a hauling release.  I'm sure it has all kinds of interesting issues -- we're going to iron out problems for the next few releases without embarking on anything major in order to restabilize it.  The tile-wise physics causes some oddities on its own (items can't be given a meaningful sub-tile width, so they act a bit strangely if you look at the collisions closely).  Dwarves are also a bit enthusiastic with their new bin/barrel jobs -- when they grab a bin/barrel to load it up, it might have objects in it, and that might lead to conflicts/false shortages on occasion.  We'll have to continue playing around with it.  **As far as I can tell, old saves load up fine and have usable minecart/wheelbarrows, so feel free to move your data/save folder over to the new version.**  You'll notice your old save stone haulers moving slower -- get some wheelbarrows built at the carpenter's for your stone stockpiles to alleviate that problem.

**New stuff**

* Minecarts can be used to haul things around on carved/constructed tracks/bridges ('h'auling to set up routes)
* Dwarves can be set to guide, push off, or ride carts that are ready to move to the next stop
* Track stops used to slow/stop cart and/or dump the contents on vehicle entry, can be disengaged with lever/plate
* Pressure plates can be triggered by carts
* Rollers can be used to push cart along when powered
* Minecarts limited to one per tile in general, various collisions can occur
* Wheelbarrows can be linked to stockpiles in order to move heavy objects (it'll auto-request one for stone stockpiles)
* Falling objects can collide with critters
* Camera can be attached to unit or item, can be linked to hotkeys from the unit/item screens

**Other bug fixes/tweaks**

* Stockpiles can be linked to workshops, can be set to give to multiple piles, can be set to accept items from links only
* Hauling jobs will often be combined, using one container
* Heavy items harder to haul
* Densities/colors updated, based on Uristocrat's data collection thread
* Can filter creature names in arena
* Mine drop rates tweaked, no longer skill-based
* Puzzleboxes/drum makeable
* Stopped blinking on bridges
* Projectiles using new code (most non-shot/thrown projectiles) can skip/skid on liquid/ground
* All flying units use new minecart parabolic flight paths
* Many projectiles do not resolve in adventure mode before your turn (so you can dodge a flying cart by moving away)
* Can create/assign to squads from v-p
* Squads can be given nicknames from v-p or the military screen
* Fixed broken clay stockpile option"	t5_2qyn1	True

1371973440.0	1gwea1	So I just discovered something completely insane.	WickedIcon	333	39	99	"I was messing around with syndromes in the arena, and I decided to do an experiment with rattlesnake bites and amputation, to see if amputation of the affected area would make symptoms go away either immediately or quicker (or at all, actually, I don't know if rattlesnake bites naturally clear up in DF).

I spawned in three humans, all on team 1; two were completely naked, unarmed, and unskilled, and one was naked, armed with a steel battleaxe, and a grandmaster axeman. 

I spawned in rattlesnakes and had them bite each of the unskilled men twice on the left hand (just to make sure it took). I then waited for the syndrome to kick in for both of them (which causes extreme pain, swelling, bleeding, rotting, and blistering in the affected area, as well as nausea and dizziness).

Then, I took control of the axeman and had him amputate the left lower arm of one of the bitten men. To my surprise, as soon as the man whose arm was amputated woke up, he was good as new; he didn't pass out again and when I flipped control over to him, he wasn't showing any pain whatsoever. He also stopped bleeding from the syndrome as soon as he was amputated; the stump bleeding took a bit, but that's an unrelated issue. The other one, however, was still experiencing extreme pain and all of the other nasty issues. The amputee also recovered from the dizziness and nausea quicker than the control human, from what I can tell.

So yeah basically, amputation is a thing in DF. It surprises me that it works in the arena (and presumably adventure mode) yet it's not a part of dwarven medical care yet."	t5_2qyn1	True

Toady One - You can carve tracks in stone now. I haven't done the wooden/metal constructed tracks yet. I haven't done minecarts either, but that's next. Tracks can be carved in stone floors or stone ramps, and it keeps track of the four directions in each tile so that you can have adjacent parallel tracks or carve writing into your fort without using too many tiles. For minecarts to make sense for mining, we'll have to change how mining works, but I want to get the carts moving first. By the time we're done, we're hoping to have the mining system remain about the same for new people, so they don't have to worry about tracks to get started (this might involve default embark wheelbarrows which dwarves would automatically use), but things will be much more efficient for people that use tracks and minecarts, across various industries.

So i started preparing by building her throne room and quarters, a grand throne room deserving of Nilashok, though certainly far more than the filthy bloodsucking witch deserves. Above the throne is the hammer: A 5x5x4 solid block of silver walls, held up by a single support linked to a lever that can be pulled upon my whim. I like to think of it as my own variation of the Sword of Damocles.

In the spring after I finished my preparations, she finally arrived, Cerol Degerith, Vampire Queen of the Pages of Murdering, along with her Vampire King Consort. I knew i had to get them both under the hammer. I checked the bloodsucking witch's profile, checked her kills. She had accumulated well over a thousand kills, all of them dwarves. If i had any doubts before about the righteousness of my cause, they were erased right then; Cerol had to die.

I put a burrow in the queen's throneroom, at the area under the hammer, just to make sure, and I put the King Consort into a squad, so I can be certain he's under the hammer. Luckily, it worked, they were now both under the hammer. It was time to put my plan into action, it was time to end the bloodsucker's madness, it was... 

**Hammertime!**

I ordered the lever to be pulled, and who else arrived to pull it but the Duke, who was the original expedition leader. It's as if that killing the queen was his idea, not mine, as if he founded Nilashok just for this moment, so he can avenge the hundreds of innocents who perished to slake Cerol's unholy thirst. He pulled the lever, the hammer dropped, and the filthy bloodsuckers were crushed to death.

I do not know what the future holds for Nilashok and the Pages of Murdering, but i know that i will rebuild the hammer, so that if a new king or queen comes to Nilashok, they will have to sit under the hammer, and be reminded of their place.

UPDATE: It's been over a year since Cerol's demise. We haven't had any contact with the Pages of Murdering since, not even a caravan, and as far as we know, they still haven't picked a new monarch. I'm wondering if the power vacuum I created started a civil war or something."	t5_2qyn1	True

But elder Urist smiled again.  ""It will be okay.  We will use the river we channeled as a moat, and build a drawbridge across it, and thick walls with fortifications with which to protect ourselves from harm!""

So they used the river channel as a moat, and built a drawbridge, and built walls with fortifications, and it was indeed okay.

Young Urist ran up to elder Urist in a panic and said, ""Father, father!  Farmer McUrist has gone beserk, and is attacking everyone around him!""

Elder Urist nodded grimly, and spoke to his son.  ""It will be okay.  Our axedwarves will take him down soon enough.""

""But father, they've only got training weapons to use, since we don't have any metal!""

""Then our miners and marksdwarves will put down the mad dog!""

And the miners were recruited and the marksdwarves ran about, and the rampage of McUrist the Insane was put to an end, and all was indeed okay.

With pinched stomach, young Urist crawled to elder Urist and complained some more.  ""Father, father...the beserk farmer killed all the other farmers, and you forgot to task new dwarves to take care of the plump helmet crop!  As fungitarians, there is now no more food, and we're all doomed to starve!""

Elder Urist closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to ignore his headache.  ""It will be okay.  The caravan will arrive soon, and our gems will be more than plenty to bring us mushrooms and wine.""

And the calls of the traders could be heard on the heels of elder Urist's words, and the caravans came, and much food was received in exchange for rare gems, and all was indeed okay.

Young Urist sprinted up to elder Urist, shouting and waving his arms.  ""Father, the force of darkness has come at last!  A goblin raid now rides down at our door.""

Elder Urist roared as he picked up a wood shield.  ""*It will be okay!*  Up with the drawbridge, marksdwarves at the fortifications, doctors stand by!""

Young Urist tugged on elder Urist's robes.  ""But father, a plot designation hid a pair of ramps from you, allowing the goblins to come down behind us!  And you were so worried about getting food from the last caravan that you forgot to buy metal for weapons!  We've got a full squad of axedwarves who are attached to their wooden training pieces, and they're falling to the dagger-wielding goblins left and right!""

But elder Urist could say nothing at all, for he was surrounded by goblins who ripped his limbs from his body and beat him to death with them, before killing his son and throwing him in the moat.

And it was not okay.

It was not okay at all.

[When the new update hit the scene, I decided to create a pocket world with a pretty long history of about 750 years, to see if I could find any crypts and artifacts. What I found was Tuftmatches, a fortress filled with ancient books.

[Unfortunately, I had made the mistake of not learning how to read, so I don't know what was in the books.](http://i.imgur.com/49rK9.png)

[""Nope!""](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.slashfood.com/media/2010/06/jimmy-dean-1964-obit-590.jpg)

""Do you want to?""

[""Nope!""](http://progresscityusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/fritz.jpg)

Well then you're not a necromancer, the latest and greatest threat to the system of good-natured family values that we call Dwarf Fortress. Necromancers, like communists and homosexuals, prey upon the weakest of our society, in this case the dead, in an attempt to subvert everything that makes Dwarf Fortress a thriving democracy where all men, provided that they're white, conservative, and happily married, have their fair chance at mining out a bit of native gold for themselves. 

Jimmy, do you know where your corpses are? 

[""Nope!""](http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/kirby/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/js1.jpg)

If you're like most young men, they're above ground. Fresh air negates the generation of miasma, which can make your dwarves sad and lethargic. However, this is the realm of the necromancer, and by allowing your refuse and corpse stockpiles to see the light of day you open your fortress up to all manner of ghouls. 

But do you think you're safe, having not spawned in an evil embark?

[""Yep!""](http://mrwriteon.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/the-soda-pop-board-of-america-1950s.jpg)

WRONG. The only thing that matters to Johnny Red is that there's a ""Tower"" civilisation on the embark screen, visible by pressing tab several times. If you see Tower, not only will you face periodic zombie raids, but necromancers will descend upon your little chunk of suburbia with all the fury of the dingo men back in '33. 

And Jimmy, do you think that the red menace cares if your corpses are hidden behind walls? 

[""Yep!""](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IC-asNVmgvY/Tp4tcNt9lVI/AAAAAAAACpw/VovfSwxVSkk/s1600/girl+on+tractor.jpg)

WRONG. Necromancers can raise the dead anywhere on the same Z level as long as it's possible for them to navigate to within visual range, and even then you're not safe because they raise through walls, raised bridges, and past both water and magma. If there's a corpse above ground, the red menace will find a way.

Necromancers don't even need a corpse to raise an undead super soldier. That horse skull you saved from your last genocide? That's an undead super soldier. Marmoset legs from your first spring? Undead super soldiers. A dwarf drowned in the bottom of your reservoir or local river? Undead goddamn supersoldier with no greater joy than ripping apart your war dogs and good Armok-worshipping women and turning them into undead goddamn supersoldiers.

The only way to combat the red menace is to think like the red menace, and to that end here are three helpful tips:

1. Don't cut zombies. An axe is to a dwarf like apple pie is to patriotic displays of misguided nationalist affection. However, with every swing you only cut off the hydra's nearest head, and within a few seconds that necromancer is going to repurpose any fallen body parts into undead supersoldiers. Make no mistake, Jimmy, the undead supersoldier's only weakness is its brain, and the tool of choice for destroying a brain without dislodging surrounding tissue is a war hammer. **Decapitation does not damn the red menace.** Eventually you may wear down an individual part, but only at the cost of turning every finger, toe, and meaningful chunk into an instrument of necromancy. 

2. Purge. [**This is the recommended graveyard/refuse set-up of the United States of Mountainhome.**](http://i.imgur.com/opL37.png) See how it's segregated from both the surface *and* the rest of the fortress? No miasma gets through those doors, and neither do the spooks! The refuse and corpse stockpiles are sectioned off from the fortress, the graveyard by an extra layer of redundancy. This ensures that even if a necromancer makes it into your fortress, his armies will be locked out and his strongest forces (*your* fallen military) will be shut down even harder. A magma-safe floodgate valve connected to a volcano ensures your ability to hold periodic holocausts, once and for all removing the future undead supersoldiers from this world while acting as an emergency weapon against any who do happen to rise up in the worst case scenario. Two ropes in front of that valve serve as sacrificial altars, as we're nothing if not slaves to Armok and every orgasm of fire should be in praise of he through whom all blood is spilled.

3. Retreat! The moment a necromancer raises any undead on the surface, they will take to hunting new prey, which will in turn become new undead. First he'll get your cats and wild animals, then your fisherdwarves and wood cutters, then caravans and egg-layers, and before you know it the surface will be overwhelmed as every dwarf below it scrambles up to collect the baubles of the fallen. The *second* you get the notification that an undead has interrupted an action, use the burrow system ('w') to segregate all dwarves below ground, lock down water and fishing supplies to underground reservoirs and wells, forbid (q&gt;l) any doors or hatches leading to the surface, draw up any bridges, blow your magma valves, and purge all that is above. Any dwarf still up there is a dead one, don't let the furious pounding and cries for help above you tell you otherwise. 

4. Real Mountainhomericans always list three things using four. Know the difference between the common zombie, the husk, and the thrall. While a zombie may eventually be destroyed, a husk or thrall is to the zombie as a hydrogen bomb is to a sling shot. If you see one of these monsters, and monsters they are, do not attack it. Do not approach it. Do not hope for a second that you have any chance at capturing or killing it. Lock down your fortress, release your magma valves, and purge everything above. You will not win against even a single thrall, not even hell wins against thralls.

Keep in mind these simple steps and the above diagram and you can indeed push back Johnny Red's attempts to dethrone the living. It is only through diligence, awareness, and copious amounts of sacrifice that Armok will guide the fine soldiers of the Mountainhome through these trying times and into the era of the dwarf. Now Jimmy, how about we go back to ""Do you want to"", because you're going to.

Anyway, this dwarven hero single-handedly ushered in a Golden Age by slaying *all* the bad guys in the world.  It got to the point where everyone would just shrug and say ""I'm flattered, but I have no use for you"" when he offered his services.  

A couple of civilizations had demon law-givers or demons posing as gods, and I thought about cleansing the world of them, too, but they didn't seem to be doing any harm and the people loved them, so in the end I left them alone.

Then I journeyed into the depths of the world, back to the slade temple where I'd found the adamantine scimitar that had made the heroic escapades possible.  Down I went into the pit, thinking I'd simply try to kill as many demons as possible — to reduce their numbers a little.

Dayfly brutes swarmed and coughed up some terrible extract, but their chitinous skulls couldn't withstand the adamantine.  An undulating blob of snow stood no chance, for obvious reasons.  Bronze insectoids were also a dime a dozen, but were dispatched easily enough with a quick stab to the head.  The first sign of trouble was a group of dimetrodon monsters, which actually managed to land a couple of hits and didn't seem to go down as easily as their smaller companions.  The dimetrodons soon became quite many, and were joined by dayfly brutes.  The end came in the form of a rib-crushing kick to the upper body, which sent Sibrek flying, shattering a bone in his right arm so he lost his shield.  Before he could recover, another dimetrodon which bit off that arm while another kicked *off* Sibreks right foot.  Sibrek had just enough time to lodge his sword in the thick skull of one of his aggressors before being reduced to complete mush.  

Somewhere deep below the ground, a demonic dimetrodon monster is walking around with an adamantine scimitar stuck in its head."	t5_2qyn1	True

We have weathered many goblin sieges and even captured and publicly executed the goblin civ's war leader. We are still bothered by kidnappers from time to time, however.

One such kidnapper showed up right by one of my children. Rather then stuffing him in a sack right away, he decided to tear up the poor kids arm with his knife. The kid was a quick little bugger and managed to run away even with his injuries. I dispatched my steel clad hammerlords to deal with this, but i figured the kid was probably done for. 

The kid actually managed to give the goblin the slip, and i noticed one of my hammerlords was gaining on the goblin. On a whim i checked his relationships, and it turns out the kid that got stabbed was his little brother!

What followed was what really surprised me. He was a hammerlord, he could have ended this goblin in a few strikes and been done with it, but he didn't. He sat there and beat the everloving shit out of this goblin with his silver hammer for a really long time, longer than i have ever seen an armed dwarf fight a goblin. He kept biting him and shaking him around, he smashed out all his teeth and broke his limbs, and in particular he kept on hitting him in the right hand, even though it was essentially mush.

Only after the goblin finally passed out from his myriad injuries did Feb Wheeledtomes the confederacies of raining finally bring his hammer down one more time on the goblins head and ended his suffering.

I don't know if it is just a coincidence or if he was exacting some dwarfy revenge for the attack on his little brother, but i love this friggin game"	t5_2qyn1	True

1340181796.0	vbk90	Whoa, dark...	Buttfranklin	203	18	33	"One of the prized jewels of my military, Lokum 'Smash' Tunvosut, a lye maker-turned-legendary hammerdwarf, popped out a baby while training. Naturally, I relieved Smash of her duties, as baby blood is a particularly traumatic thing to scrub off the walls of a danger room. She set down her ☼silver war hammer☼, and pottered about doing child-safe things for about a year.

That was, at least, until the goblins tried worrying the gates of Steeldreams. This first siege was conducted by a small party - only ten or twenty gobbos - but I decided to re-enlist Smash to The Ochre Nails to deal with the green-skins properly. After all, even after a year-long hiatus from training, she was still my best melee dwarf.

Of course, the goblins were defeated easily. The Ochre Nails, clad head-to-toe in exceptional to masterwork steel, didn't sustain a single scratch between them. Smash's daughter Asmel, on the other hand, was skewered on a silver spear almost immediately and bled out in her mother's arms.

Ouch. Smash's happiness plummets from 'ecstatic' to 'content' and stays there for a season.

But a season after that, I see the following message on the bottom of the screen: ""'Smash' Tunvosut, Lye Maker cancels Sleep: Seeking Infant."" Right now I'm thinking ""goddamnit, she squeezed out another goddamn turd of a baby while I wasn't looking"" and ""did she give birth in her sleep or what?"" but I check her relationships and she *doesn't have any more children*. Her relationships list nothing but her husband, her dead daughter and a bunch of acquaintances. I watch agape as she paths over to the exact place where her baby died - the floor still drenched with a pool of Asmel Boltpost's blood - stays motionless for a few ticks, snaps out of it and trudges back to her bedroom to sleep.

Did she dream hearing the wails of her child just outside the fortress walls? Did she wake up forgetting the memory of holding Asmel as she took her last breath? Did rush over there in a panic, only to be met with a pool of her *own child's blood* and the realisation that she's going crazy? Or is this just some sort of weird pathing error?

---------------
Loaded up a game and found a sight I liked, much like every other site I've ever embarked on:  cold, haunted, scarce trees, with a steep waterfall.  Good times, good times.  

Launched alright, took care of business by stationing my guard, but luckily every thing undead and crawly was either in the river and not interested in coming on land for the nonce, or on the other side of the map.  We were safe for a bit.  Time to strike the earth and move everything safely under ground.   

Ok so miners make quick work of the soil and we move everything into a temporary store room 2 Z levels down.  I've got Urdith the Axedwarf up top making sure nothing bad threatens the fort and uhm...wait what?  'An eerie vapor'?  The hell is that?  Well it's nothing Urdith can kill so move him underground as well and soon enough it blows over.  So that was new.  

Next an undead raven comes on the map and pretty much makes a bee line (he moves really fucking fast!) for Urdith.  Urdith dispatches him quickly, but 3 more ravens come on the map and do the same thing.  He makes quick work of them, so I go see what the miners are doing.  

They've made it pretty far, much further than I'd thought they would.  They've got the kitchen/processing room dug out, and are just finishing up the meeting room, so I'll have somewhere better to stash people than a temporary store room.  After that, they move onto the storage room and we'll pretty much have a legit base at this point.   So I move up top again and...what the fuck?  Urdith is still fighting ravens?  How many of them are there?  I check the 'u' menu (whatever it's called) and there's only 2 ravens on the map, so I figure I've caught the onslaught at the end.  But Urdith is getting tired and not dispatching them quite as quick as he did the first time.  But, with his axe, the raven undead are no more once again.  Oh and there were about 3 more of those vapors during all this, but they didn't even come very close to the base, so I let Urdith do his thing.  Back to the miners.

Oh hey, we got a stockpile and we've even got some fishies fished out of the river!  We are rocking along now and....wait, 'Urdith's body has been found'?  Wait wha...WHAT THE FUCK KILLED URDITH?!  How...what?  How does an undead raven kill an axedwarf?!  Where are these fucking ravens coming from?  Ok, no one goes above ground ever again!  The ravens have taken it over, let them have it, their spawn rate is off the charts in this embark evidently. 

Moving on.  He did his part.  I won't have a skilled tree cutter but it's no biggy, everyone else is safe under ground.  Lets get some industry going and get some stone crafts so we can trade the caravan when they show up, assuming they survive the raven onslaught.  Rocking and rolling again and, really one death isn't a big deal.  I've come back from 2 lone dwarves hanging out in a hole before thanks to a lucky immigrant wave, so I'm carrying on with my solid 6 and accompaniment of horses, kitties and doggies and...shit, freaking cat went outside and got the ravens all riled up.  Crap it's leading them in the entrance!  Damn it I've got 2 ravens inside the entrance now.  Granted there's still a few z-levels between me and them but you know how that goes....

And so it went.  The ravens killed the cat and severely depressed its owner.  Alright well let's send 2 miners (of my 3) and 2 others and surely we can kill two undead ravens.  I dispatch my cohort and they manage to kill both ravens, but evidently picks aren't useful against undead, which makes sense I guess, so it took a bit and thus one of the dwarves got severely wounded.  Oh cool he keeps lapsing in and out of consciousness.  Oh great it's Ulrick, the depressed one.  Well, disband everyone and leave him to his devices.  Oh good someone's picking him up and carrying him to a bed.  Good dwarf.  

Time passes.  Well Ulrick died of his injuries.  No coffins yet so I'll just stick him in a corner somewhere since I'm working on floodgates currently to get a sealable entrance going so stop the ravens.  The horses are getting hungry so far down, but I've got the miners looking for the caverns so they can chow down on fungi.  I think everything is under control.  

How the hell can you be interrupted by Ulrick?  He's dead.  How the hell can you be killed by Ulrick?!  He's dead!!   Well he's dead again because one of my dogs evidently got him.  Ok, hold on, the hamster wheel is starting to spin.  Oh, ok so corpses come to life now after you kill them?  That's cool.  Oh...shit so that horse that just starved not too long back....fuck.  

Well I quickly set all corpses to be thrown off the bridge, and all 4 of my survivors snap to that.  But, right, the ravens.  And...right let's just dodge into the water.  Good job number 4.  I hope you dro-  you weren't supposed to actually drown!  Fuck forget it, I'm walling everything off.  When all else fails, put a wall in front of it.  Ok so....yah you weren't supposed to seal yourself on the other side.  Well you're gone number 3.  Down to 1 and 2, but it's my fisherman and my last miner, but that's pretty much all I need to at least survive until Fall.  Hopefully the first wave will actually come given the....situation.  

Alright so spirits are flagging now that number 3 is officially dead.  I throw up a fishery in the corner of my 8x8 meeting room and dig a hole to the river.  Food and water, that'll do it.  Butcher the fish, eat the fish, mine down, rinse and repeat.  Butcher the fish, eat the fish, mine down, and....OH YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!  A mussel shell reanimates?!  Well how hard can it be to kill a mussel?  Not very as it turns out, as, in the end, it wasn't the mussel that killed my fisherman, but rather a pick straight through the head.  Evidently seeing the mussel re-animate was the last straw for my miner, and he raged, ragedhard, and quickly dispatched my fisherman.  I was left to just sit and contemplate how, how did it come to this?  How did I lose to a mussel?  'Fun', I think that's what people call it...

1376147812.0	1k3b0c	The Billion Dwarfbuck Meal	Smilge	198	26	61	"Mistem Logemgomath had never been the same after his wife and child were killed in an unfortunate drawbridge “accident.” Slabs were engraved in their honor, but the damage to his psyche had been done.

""I deserve this, that's why I was made Duke. I *earned* this!"" 

In fact, Mistem had been appointed Duke solely for his lack of preferred items. He hadn’t once issued a mandate during his term, and now he decided to make up for lost time. His subjects, however, were not amused.

“Impossible!”

“That kind of money doesn’t even exist!”

“It can’t be done! Right, Nish?”

Nish Aristrith, the legendary cook, remained silent. He had heard of [Planepacked](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Planepacked), the enormous statue that consumed far more materials than anything before it. [Could such a thing be done with food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/1jcy69/so_i_noticed_my_cook_was_grabbing_more/cbdeywd)

“I can make it,” Nish whispered to a stunned audience.

“What? A billion dwarfbuck meal? You’re joking!”

“I can make it,” Nish responded with slightly more conviction. No one knew what to say. Nish stood up, made his demands, and proceeded to the kitchen.

It was autumn when he began, and it took over three months for Nish to gather his materials from a nearby quantum stockpile. The dwarves watched in wonder, and cats flooded the kitchen to weave between Nish’s feet as he worked (leading to the fortress’s surplus of cat skulls). Even Armok himself watched and waited. But there was a problem.
 
Nish, after working non-stop for so many months, began to feel the effects of his age. He became drowsy, hungry, and thirsty. He considered abandoning the project entirely just to get a drink. The Duke was informed and arrived at the kitchen to survey the situation.

“Can he not complete his task? Bah!”

“Perhaps, sir, this is a job better suited for a vampire. We can begin training ours in the arts of cooking…”

“Train a new cook? Can we not simply turn Nish into a vampire?”

Nish, suddenly, felt much better and assured the Duke that his work would continue until the billion dwarfbuck meal was finished. The Duke confined Nish to a burrow to ensure his success. 

Finally, near the end of winter, Nish began cooking. It was a lot of syrup to mince, but in no time at all it was finished. [The billion dwarfbuck meal, consisting of 1,000 quarry leaves mixed with 10,000 gallons of syrup, was complete.](http://i.imgur.com/MDoYPIz.png)

Nish immediately collapsed from exhaustion, right in his kitchen. [It was truly a wondrous occasion, and beings from all over the world were overjoyed to hear about the wealth the fortress had created.](http://i.imgur.com/0kpZ8Kr.png)

Thank you, [Trey Stout, for Dwarf Therapist](http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/).

Thank you to everyone that have contributed to a tileset for us dummies that don't like ASCII. I particularily like Ironhand.

Thank you FogeyGaming, for [a tutorial that didn't skip any steps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3pg25RPtvM) and explained everything down to the smallest details of what hotkeys to use and some tips of **why** you did what you did. I hope to see more videos from you continuing from where you left off. Your effort was greatly appreciated.

Thank you captnduck, for [a massive amount of Dwarf Fortress tutorial videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/captnduck#p/c/5A3D7682BDD48FC2). I haven't watched everything yet, but I will as time allows me to.

Thank you everyone that has contributed to the [Dwarf Fortress wiki](http://df.magmawiki.com).

Adventure mode is about 100,000x as fun. Huge cities with dungeons filled with loot and ancient pyramids crawling with undead. The new city maps are just awesome, and the fact that you have to eat and drink now really adds to the feeling of going on long journeys. 

Dwarf mode is enriched as well. Most of the migrants you get now are historical figures, meaning they have their own skills and family lineage that goes back to the dawn of time. One thing I like doing is turning all the new rangers into marks-dwarves because they are already good at it. Another thing I noticed, but I hesitate to promise anything, is that the game runs way faster than before. 

I caught a vampire too. A fisher-dwarf accused the expedition leader, who I knew was innocent of course. So I had my sheriff drag the fisher-dwarf to the dungeon. I had no hammer, so he had to wait to be executed while we forged one. After 50 hammer strikes I knew I was right, because he lived. 

I think this release will be numbered among the mighty. And it's coming right around the corner.

1327583894.0	oxj3x	The tale of Stozu Scorpionfly, goblin thief. 		170	22	46	"Let me tell you about Stozu Scorpionfly, goblin thief. 

He was not a master thief. Not by a stretch. He blundered blithely into my fortress through an unfinished second entrance I was building (emergency as in ""EVERYBODY ON THE SURFACE GET THE FUCK INSIDE WITH ALL DUE HASTE""). I had one cage trap set up in it (I was gonna put some more in, but the efforts of my mechanics were required for maintenance elsewhere), which Stozu managed to get his ass trapped in.

Lame.

So off to the animal stockpile he went while I got that shit finished. Drawbridge in front of it, some cage traps to keep out anything that might slip in (i.e fucking goblins), another drawbridge somewhat further down the line. That shit was over-prepared as hell, but I had nothing else to do until I could start construction on a mega-project I'd started drawing plans for (never finished). 

This is where Stozu got his chance to fucking shine. 

I didn't have that many cage traps set up at the main entrance, but the few I did had accumulated gobbos like a motherfucker over the few years I'd been running the fort (had insane military with steel armour + weapons, felt good man). It was time to free up some of those cages. I didn't really need them, but suppose I would later on? I'd feel stupid, then.

Shortly before Stozu had blundered into that one trap, I'd stripped all the other goblins off their weapons/clothes/armour for a quick mass execution. ""Shit's gon' be messy,"" I thought. 

I had no idea.

I started pitting gobbos into the slaughter pit, with a relatively new and nooby squad of axedorfs waiting at the bottom of it. So many limbs. I pitted them about five at a time, watching with rapt glee as their stanky green asses got cut into chunks. 

Stozu was one of the last selected to be slaughtered. I'd forgotten all about him at that point. 

All about him and his fucking iron dagger. 

His first victim was the poor fisherman that had decided to help out with the pitting (river was frozen over). ""Oh sorry, did you need that right hand? WELL NOW IT'S FUCKING GONE"". Urist McFisherdorf later died of infection. 

I thought for sure that Stozu would just run to one of the exits and get re-caged. I was wrong. Instead of up, he went down. He was closer to the caverns than he was to the trapped exits to the surface world. 

“Let’s see this shit,” I thought.

In his mad dash, he cut down two more dorfs - a useless peasant with a stab to the lung that he eventually recovered from, and a spinner (lol fancy brown peasant) with a stab to the throat. So much fucking blood everywhere. The spinner was not long for this world. 

Good riddance, too.

So with three dorfs down and DF pathfinding being what it is, Stozu hoofed it to the caverns. He took a swing at a cat that cornered him, but missed it entirely. God damn it, you asshole, you can't at least solve my fucking cat problem? 

I'd like you to envision the entrance to the caverns. It's a long, straight hallway, no traps, with another drawbridge at the end of it. Around the middle of the hallway, another rookie squad is training. If an FB or blind cave ogre or some shit decided to attack them, that'd only weed out the weak, right? 

Stozu would suffice. 

The leader of the squad was named Id Mysteryknife. Don't remember their gender. Id was pretty okay with his (fuck it, Id is a he now) axe, but nowhere near the level of my millitia commander. Competent vs. Legendary, do the math. His squad was somewhere around the same level. So, kinda shitty. 

Enter Stozu, running into the middle of the barracks. I like to imagine him holding still for a second, putting on his boss face, and bellowing ""Let's do this shit, pussies!""

He killed two of them. Goddamn TWO of them within his first page of combat. One of them stabbed in the head, the other also getting an impromptu tracheotomy. Death toll: 4 so far. He dodged some more attempts at his life from the rookie dorfs, took a cut to the leg (not enough to disable him), and tangled with Id.

Id held up pretty well, all things considered. He managed to chop off an ear and two fingers before Stozu stabbed him in his left hand and scratched him in the right, irreparably damaging his motor nerves and causing me to later execute Id for bitching about not being able to pick his shit up constantly. Death toll: 5. 

He apparently judged that this was enough and finally ran into the caverns proper. As he made for the edge of the map, I imagined him shouting ""You will always remember this as the day you almost executed...Stozu Scorpionfly!""

I was fucking impressed, to say the least. Made him a little memorial - a small crypt with the corpses of the five dorfs he killed (although he killed Id indirectly), arranged around an iron statue. Can't tell you how many fucking iron statues I had my blacksmiths make and melt down before I got one that depicted what I wanted.

An iron statue of a goblin and a dwarf. The goblin is laughing. The dwarf is in the foetal position. 

Later, my fortress got its entire population slaughtered by a steel trips that shot fire out of its ass. But the memorial to Stozu Scorpionfly still stands in the forgotten depths. 

I salute you, Stozu Scorpionfly. I hope you're happy, wherever you are now. You mad fucking cunt.

Please, by the beard of Armok, tell us a little about the fortress and what made it so epic.

[Boatmurdered]( http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Boatmurdered) The most dorfy thing in all of existence. Murderous elephant raids, a lava megaweapon, and excellent storytelling. 

[Hamlet of Tyranny]( http://dfstories.com/the-hamlet-of-tyranny/) a DF story so epic it rivals Lord of the Rings and brings Dwarf Fortress’ sentience into question. 

[Flarechanneled]( http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/flarechannel/) Frankly just an incredibly detailed fortress on it’s own, but it also has some great stories (nay, legends) come out of it, such as [Catten and the Eagle]( http://www.bay12games.com/forum/index.php?topic=43679.msg825762#msg825762)

[Oceanshoots]( http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=101795.0) One man’s hilariously funny attempts to find out whether ballistae can be fired at whales.... for SCIENCE 

Tim Denee is the creator of both the [Bronzemurder]( http://bronzemurder.timdenee.com/) and [Oilfurnace]( http://oilfurnace.timdenee.com/) comics, which are amazing and epic tales of dwarven heroics and bravery.

I am always looking to expand my view of worlds both real and imagined, and I one of the ways in which I seek to do this is visualizing any number of dimensions. I can now successfully comprehend things like simple rotations of x-dimensional hyperplanes in a y-dimensional cross-sections of z-dimensional space, and similar operations on polytopes and such. The spatial dimension that I understand the most, however, is the next one, the fourth. I mentally feel as comfortable in it as in the third dimension, naturally processing the movement of objects in eight directions rather than our six (up, down, left, right, forward, backward, or however you wish). Recently, I have been searching for a way to bring it into ours: some sort of way to view and interact with a four-dimensional world, so that we may grasp it fully in its beauty.

You probably do not like where this is going.

I believe the fourth dimension can be modded into Dwarf Fortress. You know how we have z-levels? We break the three-dimensional world of Dwarf Fortress down into layers, for comfortable two-dimensional viewing on our two-dimensional computer screen. We cycle through these layers, viewing one slice at a time because we can not view the whole thing in one pseudo-three-dimensional shot, except in a clumsy manner with things like StoneSense, which require abstract rotation to view the whole thing. It's much better for us to take our square slices, in complete certainty of the x and y position of everything we see. This is practical in general for viewing the fourth dimension as well: take gradual, periodical, three-dimensional slices of the whole thing, each of which can be individually comprehended quite handily. To look at different parts of it, just cycle through the layers, in w-levels, like in Dwarf Fortress but with three-dimensional layers instead of two.

However, who is to say that these three-dimensional layers cannot be broken down into two-dimensional slices like the ones for Dwarf Fortress? No one. Simply, one must cycle through two axes of layers: the z-layers, with &lt; for up and &gt; for down, and the w-layers, with { for ana, and } for kata. Each pointy bracket press sends you to another vertical layer in the pile, like a delicious stack of pancakes peeled apart pancake by pancake. Each curly bracket press sends you to a different three-dimensional plane entirely, like several stacks of pancakes lined up next to each other, with you choosing to move to a stack on the left or right.

There is, then, the matter of mechanics. In three dimensions, you have a floor and ceiling, yes? You are usually attracted to the bottom layer, because there is a force pulling you downwards. Therefore, you place a floor underneath yourself, downwardly oriented to your center of being (analogous to a ""tile"" in Dwarf Fortress: floors are in the bottom of the tile). However, in four dimensions, it would be kind of stupid to be attracted to either end of the series for whatever reason, just because... well, all stacks are made equal. But the reason we can traverse in three-dimensional space at all is because of gravity: STAIRS. It is therefore prudent to come up with such an attraction anyway, for the sake of practicality. Where are we to put this magical source of attraction, however? I say place it on your embark stack, in the center of the series (it is going to be in the center of the series). Therefore, if you are ana of the home stack, you will be pulled kata, and need some sort of support directly kata of the tile that supports you. If you are kata of the home stack, you are pulled ana, and need to have supports ana of where you are. We do not need supports in both directions; in stacks, only an ana pull or a kata pull exists, but not both. Think of these supports as simply tiles that allow your dwarves to go places, designated ""you can walk here"" zones. We have walls, floors, ceilings... what do we call these four-dimensional structures? Let's say, marquees. These marquees are difficult to put onscreen: floors are already annoying to represent, as they get covered up when anything is placed on the tile, or even when a dwarf walks across it. Thus, the marquees must be viewed separately, by, say, pressing some button (shift-M?), which will allow you to see where marquees exist or not, preferably in some blinking overlay of plus signs. Of course, you won't have to build a marquee for EVERY tile: for example, underground, unless you are inside a cavern (or there is a cavern ana/kata to you), you have solid rock in all directions. Once you hollow out a tile, a floor is created with it: why shouldn't a marquee also be created as well? However, generally, there's just one rule for building marquees (switch around ana and kata if you're kata of the home stack): if the same tile in the next stack directly kata to you is not solid, then you need to build a marquee. Otherwise, you can just be supported by the tile as it is. Having magma directly ana/kata to you is great fun, I'll bet...

To actually have your dwarves traverse between the layers, you must build/carve marquee stairs, analogous to regular stairs that let you travel between z-levels. On that note, you can also build marquee trapdoors, traps, et cetera... there is no greater fun than watching your opponent splatter on a marquee six stacks kata to you. ""Oh no! Now I have to clean up four-dimensional blood!"" Or drop him into your magma chamber that's completely walled off in that stack... there is so much potential.

There is also the matter of what to actually put on the other stacks. I have come up with three options:

1. Exactly the same thing. Boooooring.

2. Something procedurally generated from your regular landscape, possibly with platforms getting vanishingly smaller as you venture into further and further stacks...

3. The surrounding few tiles in the overworld, lined up in a [space-filling curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve) sequence, with your home stack in the center. This poses the most interest to me: what if you embark NEXT TO a haunted biome, or such? What if you are adjacent to a volcano? What if you are close to both a glacier and a forest? How about a glacier AND a volcano? Four-dimensional pump stacks operational...

Memory problems and such notwithstanding: I'd play it. Thoughts?

I immediately got an idea and set to work. Build a room for your necro to be pitted in. Have a window on one side so he can see into ""the killing room"". On the other side, put a locked door with a cage on the other side. (this lets you unlock the door and collect him).

Between the window and the killing room, make a bridge so you can obstruct the necro's view of the killing room (so he cannot raise the creature and creature parts in there from the dead). The Killing Room should have a window towards the necro and be covered by an atom smashing bridge, which makes cleanup easy. This room should have some fortification opening for your marksdwarves. 

The Killing room, can be the bottom of a pitting shaft or a refuse pile to get dead things in there. Pit the necro, unobscure his view, station your marksdwarves and they will kill the undead indefinitely. My killing room is at the bottom of a 20z shaft.

1284117299.0	dc17x	The colossus in the flood chamber.	selectrix	146	16	35	"Picture a thriving fortress. Nearly a hundred dwarves, a burgeoning surface structure already well sealed against invasion, a thriving crafts industry, and more coke than Rick James could handle. The Plan, recently hatched by the fortress supervisor, was to open a gateway to Hell. And flood it.

Embarking on this endeavor, the fortress supervisor put military training on the back burner (though numerous weapons and armor pieces continued to be forged).

The river provided adequate water supply, and the holding chamber had been ready for some time- delays occurred due to discovery of massive fuel deposits around the mining designations- all that was left to be built was a lockable enclosure around the surface entrance. Construction had almost completed, when the 3-year Beast, in this case a fire-breathing colossus, made its much-anticipated entrance.

Dwarves were immediately alerted to a surface attack and rallied inside the fort. They promptly drew the bridge once everybody was inside.

So the colossus waited, variously hunting down stray animals and burning down approximately one fourth of the trees on the map. Then it saw the cats. They ran into the outside entrance within the partially completed enclosure.

The *cats*. They were the key. They continued to lure the titan further into the shafts, which, due to the fuel mining, had grown quite expansive. One scurried around, successfully dodging large gouts of flame... for a while. The second was hidden, shivering, on the stairwell one level down, several dozen tiles away. One of two floodgates stood in the way of the colossus.

It paused in front of the standing floodgate, not half a dozen tiles away from the one remaining cat, who still huddled in fear on the stairwell. One second it was standing not 25 feet away from its entrapment and watery demise; the next, it was standing in front of a pile of jumbled gears and mechanisms. *How could we have overlooked such a thing?* To think this could have been successfully accomplished had only the second gate been lowered.. well, lessons hard learned are hard forgotten. Crestfallen, the fortress waited in anticipation. Wells were built.

Bored again after another brief foray on the surface, the colossus decided to explore the furthest depths of the mineshaft. This time, the dwarves had taken the precaution of lowering both floodgates at the bottom exit of the holding tank, but again the beast stood but meters away from being stuck, at least long enough for a miner to breach the river. 

But maybe, just maybe, it would take long enough to reach the upper levels that a mason can seal off the tunnel with a wall for the purpose of later flooding.. It's the only chance now. Bridges lowered, but wait- no.. too many dwarves leaving.. Crap now the colossus is heading back up, okay quickly now.. Ha! Sealed! And- aww, over half a dozen dwarves inside? Well, worse sacrifices have been made. 

The colossus does not attempt to ascend the shaft, however, it's chasing a few dwarves around in one of the holding tanks dug underneath a subterranean lake for earlier experimentation purposes. And it doesn't actually seem to be killing them.

No, one hunter repeatedly takes aim and fires with his wooden crossbow from the rim of the pit, somehow keeping the creature confused enough not to ascend the numerous available slopes. Despite that it can surely come to no avail, the creature is occupied enough to allow for the digging of a tunnel around the wall. A few dwarves choose to surface, the rest remain in the pit. 

And truly, they were the lucky ones, for they bore witness the day that Kib Cerlomat shot a copper bolt into the eye of a fire breathing colossus and ripped a tendon in its *motherfucing brain*.

  Seasons later she gave birth.

  Months later the fortress was attack by a Weremonitor (monitor lizard). She and the small squad set out to beat its ass with their maple training swords. Nina ended up bringing the baby with her. 

  One dwarf had both of his legs broken, and the rest grappled with the beast. That included the baby.... before the baby could take any damage the were creature transformed back into a goblin and fled. 


  .


  A season later... Nina was doing her thing when all of a sudden her baby transforms into a hideous baby weremonitor! 

  She punched it in the arm and was bruising it. Then out of the blue, THWACK! And the babies head goes flying off in an arc! As the expedition leader chopped it off with a battle axe. 

  Nina fainted, her war dogs wimpered by her side...

  When she woke up she was in a state of shock, wandering around in circles. She eventually settled down and went to her room with her husband and dogs who comforted her... 

  However. She was a tough dwarf, and went on to have 3 more children and kick lots of ass."	t5_2qyn1	True

The fortress was thriving and migrants were common. 100 happy dwarves lived next to a river delta in 3 story deep fortress. It was not well organized, nor grand in any way, but it was home. Shortly after another migrant wave and a human merchant caravan arrived, the goblins struck.

The fortress was not without a militia, but it was meant to keep thieves and snatchers at bay, certainly not a goblin invasion. While the civilians rushed to the meeting hall on the lowest level, the humble militia guarded the drawbridge. Once all the civilians had made it inside, they retreated and raised the bridge. Two dwarves had fallen. But they had died saved the fortress...

The goblins would not be able to harm the fortress directly, but unfortunately, this was only the beginning. Soon, the alcohol ran dry and without a fresh water source within the fortress walls, dwarves began to die of thirst. They frantically dug through cavern walls into stagnant pools for temporary respite and raided the trapped trade caravan. It was too late. Several dwarves went insane, another turned up dead drained of blood, and still more succumbed to thirst. The few sane dwarves that remained knew that the fortress was lost and could not bear the sound of their brothers and sisters murdering each other in thoughtless rage. In an effort to preserve the memory of the fortress, they tunneled into the nearby river delta.

The fortress flooded, winter came and entombed the fortress in ice. When the last cry faded into the frozen wasteland, the goblins left."	t5_2qyn1	True

1315368029.0	k77dc	I think my dwarves just had a military coup.	tygea42	156	27	50	"Upon the untimely death of Mayor McMoosepuncher, the electorate voted in Mayor McHatedbyeveryone.  A repeated violent offender with a long list of mutual grudges throughout the fort with no experience beyond his work as a hauler.

Mayor McHatedbyeveryone was a surprisingly good mayor, under his rule the only mandates were for the construction of arms and armor or objects made of iron, and the only export ban was on diamonds, which we have none of to begin with.  When his duties were expanded to include trading with the merchants, he showed remarkable dedication to duty, not once failing to rush directly to the trade depot when a caravan arrived.

Then came the Winter of Tragedy, when a full three quarters of the professional military in the fort died fighting off a flying, fire-breathing badger made of vomit.  The battle was gruesome, as the militia was burned alive in their archery towers while those that ventured outside to face the threat directly were either torn apart, or encased in ice as the Titan melted the river beneath their feet, only to have it refreeze almost instantly.

One of the survivors, the last of his squad and having literally all his friends and family as well as his pet cat die in the defense of the fort.  Not only that, but one of his wounded comrades managed to set a significant section of the military housing and warehouse quarter on fire, so he lost his home as well.  He was obviously unhappy, but appeared no worse off than the rest of the surviving military, and was an excellent teacher and marksdwarf, so was assigned a squad of 20 immigrants to train to replace the losses the fort had suffered.

Things progressed well until mid-summer, bodies were recovered and entombed, memorials were carved, the military housing was rebuilt with a shower hall at all entrances and a fire control system was installed to prevent the loss from happening again.  Then our hero got it in his head to take his problems to the mayor to sort out.

He marched his squad down the hall to the civilian quarter, past the great dinning hall and the glorious workshops.  Down past the caverns he had helped clear and seal off, where farmers were now busy in the fields and butchers were slaughtering the excess population of llamas.  Down past the artificial lake where fisher dwarves hauled turtles from the water to rot on the shore to harvest their shells.  Down past the long hall of tombs and memorials from his fallen comrades.  Till finally he came to the Noble quarter, where he marched his command into the Mayor's mansion for a meeting.

Face to face with the mayor he pleaded his case, but the Mayor didn't care.  The Mayor had felt slighted by the brave veteran in the past, and the sight of his face drove him past the brink.  The Mayor overturned his masterwork silver table in front of the commander and his squad and made to attack them.

The now departed Mayor was killed instantly in a hail of crossbow fire and the Commander was almost instantly voted to replace him.  Upon his election, Mayor McMurderedthelastguy ordered the construction of slade armor stands, and began a 2 year break.

It's really just a solid guide to get your military up and running effectively so they can be supplement your fortress defenses instead of just being fodder when !!FUN!! slips by your traps.

I realized there wasn't really a good advanced guide to the military, so I thought I'd write one up. I recommend you have a grasp on the basics(like knowing how to make tables and chairs) before getting into the military aspect of the game.

[My Current Layout](http://i.imgur.com/JcNJJ.jpg) so that I can break things down by area. Yes, it's unfinished.

**What You Will Need:**

* Manager(With a small office)
* Bookkeeper(With all counts set to accurate and a small office)
* 8 Female Untrained Dogs
* 2 Male Untrained Dogs
* Mechanic's Workshop
* Butcher's Workshop
* Craftsdwarf's Workshop
* Carpenter's Workshop
* Bowyer's Workshop
* Leatherworker's Workshop
* Tanner's Workshop
* Metalsmith's Workshop
* Smelter
* Wood Furnace\*
* [DwarfTherapist](http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/)

\* Hopefully you have an available source coal or lignite to make into bars of coke at the smelter, otherwise you're going to need a lot of trees cut down to supply you with charcoal.

**Part One: Picking an Effective Squad Leader**

I found one of the things no one really ever points out is how a squad's captain influences the squad. They effect things like training and squad moral, so picking a good squad leader is the first step to building a good squad.

Using DwarfTherapist, we can determine who a good squad leader would be. There are three things you want to take into consideration: Military Skill, Social Skill, and Personality.

For a **melee squad**, pick someone who has existing(and preferably the highest rating) in Armor User, Shield User, Fighter(and/or Dodger/Biter/etc.), and one of Swordsdwarf, Hammerdwarf, Macedwarf, Axedwarf, or Speardwarf.

For a **ranged squad**, pick someone who has the highest skills in Archer, Marksdwarf, and Ambusher. Armor User and Shield User are important to have(as well as fighter/biter/etc.), but not as necessary for a ranged squad.

Now that you have found potential candidates, you want to check their **Social Skills**. What you're looking for here is someone who is a skilled Teacher, Leader, and Intimidator. Don't worry if your dwarves do not have any of these; they will develop in the role of a Squad Leader. Teacher helps them instruct other dwarves, Leader gives them better decision-making skills, and Intimidator helps overall squad moral and frightening away enemies.

Finally, you want to make sure you have a dwarf with an appropriate **personality**. I don't have a comprehensive list of all the personality traits, so I will give you an example of what makes a good squad leader:

* Calm demeanor
* Bravery
* Able to handle stress
* Awareness of emotions
* Trust
* Preference for security and stability
* Organized
* Confident under pressure

On the other hand, things you don't want your squad leader to be:

* Lazy
* Apathy towards other's suffering
* Thrill-seeker(though risk-taker is okay)
* Impulsive
* Disorganized
* Lacking confidence

With a handle on those three aspects of your squad leader in mind, you'll be able to pick an effective squad leader.

**Part Two: Building the Squad**

Once you have a squad leader chosen, you can move on to selecting the rest of the squad. Personality and social traits are irrelevant in the remainder of the squad. What you need to focus on is preexisting military experience. Assign squad members who already have Armor User, Shield User, and a melee skill to melee squads, and assign squad members who have Marksdwarf and Ambusher to ranged squads. If a dwarf has both, put them in a squad based on which one has room after assigning all other skilled dwarves. If both squads have room, assign the dwarf based on his highest attack skill(whether it's melee or ranged). Don't worry if your squad still has room left over, you can fill it up as migrants show up to your fortress. You don't want to assign dwarves with no military experience(thankfully this includes Armor User and Shield User) because they will get an unhappy thought(even though it will eventually go away, it will take a very long time).

**Part Three: Squad Equipment**

I've found that, unless you want to do something special like assign your Captain of the Guard that legendary mace encrusted with diamonds, you don't need to fiddle with squad equipment very much. Selecting the default set of Metal Armor for melee squads and Archer for ranged squads will do just fine.

Just starting out, you likely won't have any metal armor with you. That's fine, because the dwarves will use whatever armor they can get their hands on in the meantime. This is where your dogs come in. Designate a zone as a Pasture(n) and assign(N) all your dogs to it. Wait until they have about 8 or 10 puppies, and then butcher your dogs. **Do not** butcher puppies until they have grown into dogs and had puppies of their own. This way, you have a renewing source of *leather*, *bone*, and *meat* for your dwarves to use.


Once you've started butchering your dogs, you can put your manager to work. j-m to get to the manager screen, and then q to assign new tasks. Start typing in what you want(leather, bolts, meals, etc; I have space go back so I don't use spaces here) and select it. You'll want to start with *Leather Armor* and *Bone Bolts*, and later assign pairs of leather boots, gloves, cloaks, helms, etc. Assign 30 of each(it's the maximum for some reason); you will get a lot of messages that it cannot be completed for lack of resources, but as you continue to butcher dogs, you will churn out armor and ammo for your dwarves. This has the added benefit of providing experience to your manager dwarf and getting unfamiliar players familiar with using the manager system to assign tasks more quickly(which becomes helpful later on in this tutorial). In addition to leather armor and bone bolts, you'll also want to have your manager order the construction of crossbows, ensuring there are enough for both your marksdwarves *and* hunters, even if they're one and the same. They trade equipment sometimes, so you'll want to have excess.

Next, you want to check their Supplies(u). Set each squad to carry *no* food or water; waterskins and backpacks are buggy, and I noticed that setting them to food and water carried causes them, more often than not, to have Soldier(Cannot Follow Order) as their current task.

After you've cleared that up, go to Ammunition(f) and assign bolts *and* arrows to your squad. Dwarves with a crossbow won't pick up arrows, and dwarves with a bow won't pick up bolts, so in case one of your dwarves fancies that well-crafted elven bow, you want him to be permitted to get ammo for it. I usually designate each squad to have 200 bolts + 200 arrows exclusively for combat, and 100 bolts + 100 arrows exclusively for training. Another issue the game runs into is when you have one stack listed for both combat *and* training as is the default; dwarves will designate them for combat first, and you end up with none left over to be used for training. Having two sets(one at 200 and one at 100) will assign bolts/arrows to both combat *and* training, resulting in your ranged dwarves training more often. Don't forget to have your manager order the construction of leather quivers for your ranged dwarves, they won't be able to pick up *any* ammunition unless they have one.

This takes care of a squad's starting equipment.

**Part Four: Melee Training**

There are several tricks behind getting a squad to train in the current version(0.31.25) of dwarf fortress, and I'll post an updated version of this guide once I have a grasp on the military in the upcoming New Version we're all anticipating. First, you need someplace for your squad to train. On the linked image, **Area A** is my melee training area. I like to give them a nice open area, though 10x10 squares will do just fine.
Have your manager order the construction of an Armor Rack *and* a Weapon Rack. Put up doors in the room, and place both the Weapon Rack and Armor Rack in the training room. Using q to view them, designate each one as a barracks/armory and expand them to fill the room, ensuring they overlap eachother completely. Once you've made it into a barracks, use T to designate it as a training are for your military squad on *both* racks. This is important.

Now that you have an area for them to train in, you will want to schedule them to train. Go to the military screen and hit s to view the schedule. Clear(x) the currently full training schedule, and return to the top. Hit o to give them an order, tapping it again until it is on *training*. Use + or - to assign 4 dwarves to the training session. Hit Shift+Enter, then o to designate a *second* training session, also with 4 dwarves, to the *same month*.
This is also important, because having doubled-up training sessions + a doubled up training area will result in your squad sparring more often, which is something we obviously want a lot. Once you have the two training sessions in place, copy(c) the order and paste(p) it into *every **other** month*. You want your dwarves to have time off in between training sessions so they don't get an unhappy thought from long on-duty shifts. Do this for each melee squad you have, alternating months between squads.

That's all you need to do; once that is set, your dwarves will get training.

Here is the current index.

The Let's Play is more of a follow on from the tutorial with an easy embark and semi-guiding through playing the game.  I will perhaps do some hard embark once this one inevitably falls.

I started playing recently and after abandoning two early sites for silly reasons early on (i.e. Dwarves not digging) my third embark is looking promising. Nothing super eventful has really been happening at all, I've just been building my fort, and rather successfully it seems, at least for it being only my third.

For some unknown reason a Dwarven child went insane. I think I locked him in a room but after a while he got out and started bringing the ruckus in my dorm and bedrooms. No one was really around so after attacking a few workers who promptly ran away he got in a fight with a dog for around 20 pages worth of a combat log. The rest of the fort caught wind and it turned into a panic as they all chased him around, trying to restrain him. My mayor decided to take charge eventually and held him down while he beat him down with a Shearer and the dog from before. According to the previous entries in the combat log he was only able to hold him down (something that numerous other dwarves failed at) after he punched his right leg, tearing the ligaments and tendons. The other graphic highlight was when the Shearer punched him in the abdomen, breaking his ribs and causing them to puncture his lung, making it hard for the child to breath.

I unfortunately missed all of this except for the end. I was reading something in the wiki while the game was unpaused, I switched back and everyone was running around frantically. I figure this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of crazy shit that happens in this game, I look forward to playing more!"	t5_2qyn1	True

So /r/dwarffortress, I was playing on one of my more ""humorous"" forts, Throathammers. I've been doing plenty of experiments in the ""Area 51"" division of my fort, such as seeing how long trolls can survive in magma, how far I can launch goblins with bridges, trying to create a ""super hammerlord"" by continually feeding him vile forces of darkness, and so forth. Needless to say, the whole fortress is antics and I've probably irreversibly destroyed the cave systems/surrounding landscape.

Now, I was setting up a new section of the fort with the intention of making some ""magma pillars"", essentially magma falling from the ceiling through 30 or so z levels back into the magma sea where I had pumped it out. The reason why I wanted this was I was constructing a new throne room for the already mentioned super hammerlord, which I had pretty much appointed god-king of everything. I've even gone so far as to give him a slade hammer/suit of armor by changing the raws a little. Of course, the magma pillars didn't quite work as intentioned, and the throne room begin to fill with magma. My super dorf couldn't escape, but as the magma filled the room and all the dwarves died, not only was he surviving, but the magma wasn't affecting him. So my question, fellow urists, is if somehow his slade armor was protecting him from the magma? Have I discovered a way to colonize the magma sea?

**TL;DR super-dorf is somehow able to survive in magma with his slade armor**

If anyone is curious, here's a pic of the [hammerlord](http://i.imgur.com/2O2WT.jpg) standing under a couple z levels of magma."	t5_2qyn1	True

1363052969.0	1a4dbp	Urdim Liddumat Thidasgasis, certified badass	ledgekindred	144	24	13	"Urdim is a legendary Marksdwarf, Archer and Ambusher, High Master Dodger and basically my fort's only hunter.  He consistently brings in the most ridiculous things like Giant Slugs, Giant Snails, Giant Mosquitoes, a bucket of crundles and is the only dorf I've ever seen actually take a Giant Cave Spider one-on-one and win.  (He then decided he needed a drink and let some other poor sod carry the carcass up to be butchered.)  He's gotten himself a title by killing a half dozen goblin thieves and snatchers, one of them with a single headshot.  

The caravan just left and I'm thinking ""something exciting needs to happen.""  Yeah, tempting fate and all.  Then of course:

**A vile force of darkness has arrived**

Hooray!  Something for my military to do!  My only concern is that Urdim is out trying to kill something and is going to get caught in the siege and killed.  He's one of my most useful dorfs, keeping me in a steady supply of meat, leather and tallow to be turned into soap.  I look around the map and sure enough, Urdim is up north on the surface, hunting as usual.  Worse yet, a group of trolls spawned only a few paces away from where he was.  I give the ""Everyone inside"" burrow order and sadly decide to write poor Urdim off, thinking there's no way he'll make it inside.  Well, that was a dumb thought of mine.

Urdim immediately starts shooting at the trolls.  They converge on him - while I was watching he was surrounded by four trolls at one point - but Urdim is not going to go down without a fight.  He dodges everything they try to hit him with, still firing.  (Bob and weave, Urdim.  Bob and weave...)  He hits one of them in the face with a bolt and teeth go flying.  He ultimately scared off that squad by making five of them pass out from pain before the others gave up and ran away.  

Then Urdim runs east, which happens to be where a group of goblin lashers have just arrived right at the edge of the map.  ""Bugger,"" I think.  Trolls is one thing but lashers is another.  Although by this point I decide that I shouldn't be too hasty.  Urdim fires his last couple of bolts into the group and hightails it.  (Aside: my fort entrance is pretty much in the center of the map, walled off, with a drawbridge opening to the west side of the wall.)  Urdim heads south with three lashers following him.  Two of them give up chasing but the third closes in and manages to get a couple hits in, smashing two of Urdim's fingers and toes before Urdim smashes the goblin into pulp with his crossbow.  (I want to believe that Urdim didn't exactly get *hit* in the hand so much as tried to catch the whip so he could beat the gobbo to death with it as something new for once.)

So now Urdim is headed south, into a squad of swordgoblins.  Most of them are already heading towards the entrance, so only a couple give chase to Urdim.  He takes a diagonal to the southwest, bypassing them, while they run after him.  He skirts the bottom of the map before heading northwest again, still gobbos chasing him.

Meanwhile, the majority of the siege has entered through the drawbridge where I have 20 well-trained, well-armored and well-armed soldiers waiting.  They eat the gobbos for breakfast, sending the first two squads that hit the bridge straight to hell.  There's still the sword squad, with some of them chasing Urdim.  But at this point, Urdim is headed towards the fort entrance, at least in a general direction.

After the first couple of squads are slaughtered, my soldiers go back to their stations and wait for the rest to show up.  Urdim manages to make it to the drawbridge and *passes out on the bridge.*  Well crap.

The swordsgoblins that were chasing him show up and, for some reason, decide to leave the sleeping dwarf alone and get chopped to bits once they set foot in the courtyard.  The the last two squads show up and likewise make like ice cubes in a blender while Urdim is still passed out on the bridge, with everyone fighting around him.

Once the siege is broken, and I give the all-clear order, I'm watching Urdim to see if someone is going to drag him to the hospital and take care of him.  Then Urdim wakes up.  See, he hadn't passed out, he had decided to *take a fucking nap* in the middle of the bridge, during a siege.  So when he wakes up, what is the first thing he does? (he still has broken fingers, mind)  He thinks to himself, ""Why ain't I killin' nothin'?  Ah, yar, I needs me some more ammo."" and goes to pick up more bolts, and then heads right back out to hunt.

So, to paint a picture: he made a complete circuit around my fort, killing trolls and dodging lashers and swordgoblins before deciding ""Fuck this, I'm sleepy"" and taking a nap in the middle of the siege.

He is getting a nice tomb built for him.  I don't have any brass in the fort, so I'm going to use a handful of my few steel bars to make his sarcophagus, because that's what his balls are made of.

About 103 dwarves, an AMAZING military filled with elite dwarves decked out in the finest iron armor and weapons my legendary metalsmiths could churn out. I had a booming metal industry thanks to the massive amount of ores and a volcano, I was digging up some candy, things were great...until a Forgotten Beast came by.

Sox Uetdmeso ustru Snosstrosp(fun fact: It's name means Sox Carnagewaste the dead of clouting-a fitting name, as you will discover) was a giant, 6 legged dear. It undulutad rythmically, and it's most deadly feature: It spat webs. No matter. The second it reached the first cavern level, it would immediately be swarmed from all sides by my military-no way it could survive.

However, upon breaching the second cavern levels(where it spawned) defences, it went *down*, not up. As I discovered, about ~30 dwarves had gone down to collect the candy.

It massacred them. All of them. Not a single survivor. And, because of some horrible planning by me, they all had a LOT of friends.

It killed about 6 or 7 more-2 of them swordmasters-on it's way up. However, upon reaching the first level, it was immediately swarmed by my brave militia, who proceeded to very, very violently kill it. It fell by my axe lords hands.

Now, I'm dealing with a massive tantrum spiral. As I type this, about 50 of my original 103 are still alive. Of that, 36 are miserable, 1 is very unhappy, 1 is unhappy, 3 are content, 1 is happy, and of course, 2 are ecstatic(one of whom is my mayor, who is ecstatic for ""making an artifact recently"". The artifact? A dwarf bone hatch.) Probably about half of them are running around naked or throwing themselves off cliffs.

Here's the kicker, the thing that makes it great: I can NOT lose. My amazing military? While everyone else was busy getting drunk together, they've been training. While everyone else has been making buddies, they've been training. While everyone else was falling in love, they've been training.

The result? A hardened military, who doesn't give one shit about the rest of the fort. While everyone is down there punching each other to death, they're training-unless someone goes berserk, in which case it'll suck to be that guy when I send my militia after them.

In other words, when it's all said and done, and the dust settles, I will probably have 6(maybe five-the axe lord has family, and is currently very unhappy) dwarves left-dwarves who have killed cyclops and entire goblin sieges with ease. Dwarves who could give less of a damn about who's dead or alive. When it's all done, I plan on raising the drawbridge, and having them live the rest of their lives all on their own. It'll be fantastic. Like the ""Only the initial 7"" challenge, only with 5/6 of the most badass, drunken midgets around. I'm excited as hell.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that after Sox died, a second FB came-it was killed by a single bolt, fired by the Captain of the Guard. *THEN* a goblin siege came, numbering about 30 or 40, and after 30 seconds of skirmishing with my troops, they all lay dead.

DOUBLE EDIT: I'm now at about 27 dwarves, 14 of whom aren't insane.

TRIPLE THE EDIT FOR TRIPLE THE FUN: Yup, 5 dwarves. The axe lord went insane-but it's okay, her left arm was already fractured from a Spearmaster punching her, and she was....swiftly dealt with.

AND YET ANOTHER EDIT:...damn. My militia commander somehow got struck by spinning rock that shattered a few bones, and while he was unconscious from the pain yet ANOTHER forgotten beast finished him off.

FINALLY: Okay, here's the situation: I, unfortunately, have ten dwarves. I guess 4 of the little bastards decided not to go all bat-shit, much to my chagrin. So now I'm stuck with them. I plan on letting caravans IN, but migrants OUT. With any luck, I can get a breeding population of dwarves going. I have a child who I hacked to allow for hauling(it was for roleplaying purposes, I swear!).  I currently have half the old population entombed, and have only had one casualty to ghosts-nothing serious, just a ruptured pancreas. I came under siege, and not wanting to risk it with bowgobbos I waited it out, at the cost of a few war dogs. An elven caravan came(side note: How do you get them to declare war on you? I've been trying REALLY hard, and no dice) who were butchered by the siege, but they left a giant rattlesnake that I left outside chained and surrounded by cage traps so that anyone who comes will hopefully be eaten by it. There's some other stuff going on, but it's 5:30 in the morning, I ought to be sleeping. I'll update if you'd like."	t5_2qyn1	True

*TL;DR - you need a 12x7 embark for the full plans, which are in two parts.  The cropped version is a 5x5 embark, in one file.  The maps are only 6Z deep, and designate from the top-north-west corner.*


The megaproject I always wanted was to recreate the Mines of Moria - accurately.  Of course, it never worked - the plan was too big and never came out right.  Not to mention I never really had a plan...

The classic map - even if never endorsed by Tolkien, it's the best available - is awesome but incomprehensible to lay out in DF.  

[The map](http://i.imgur.com/lSvvi.jpg)

So I owe a big thanks to /u/Skage16 who hand-traced the map onto eight separate levels.  

[The Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/1gb89f/ok_i_have_completed_the_mines_of_moria_trace/); [the layered map](http://i.imgur.com/keg1gLJh.png)

From there, I downscaled the images, then put them through chromafort (which had severe trouble with such large images, even black &amp; white) and corrected the skew that introduced.  Then it was down to a lot of work in excel, making things geometric again and connecting the halls across z-levels with ramps.  I've also had to make some changes from the plans to fit things in - 12x7 embark is large enough (from 15x11!), and the contents of the top and bottom levels have been relocated to aid in cavern-related problems.  

The contents include: 
 - One excel workbook, with all the layers laid out individually (the source, for your own modifications of the plan).
 - a pair of .csv blueprints for Quickfort to lay out the whole 12x7 map (so big, Quickfort needs it in sections!).  This is the true megaproject.
 - a cropped edition [the western halls] cropped to fit in a 5x5 embark.  This one is a more plausible challenge.  
 - the two maps that the work is based off.
 - this document.

All I want to see is someone carve out and inhabit the full mines - it's a long held dream, and I can't wait for Moore's Law to overcome DF feature growth enough that a laptop I own will run the thing.  

*Dwarfbonus:  release, then neutralise a Balrog*

Those carps are traditionally alive in the store (at least here in Poland) and will get killed by the salespeople if one wishes to do so. Or one can take home live ones and kill them oneself.

The gran bought one, had it killed, had it packaged, and carried it around for about an hour. Then when she came home and wanted to cook it in boiling water... it started to twitch. 

So she notices that there still might be some spark of live left and brings it to the bathtub where it now is happily splashing about. Only her cat tries to get to it but failed so far.

So, the carp survived getting his head bashed in, getting carried around in air for an hour or more, getting put into cooking water, and currently is rather happy defending himself against a very nasty cat.

I'd just finished the final touches on the parapets and catwalks and was working on building the second layer to the outer walls. A happy troop of gorillas was passing by, and a lowly stone engraver, Endok, was out smoothing over some boulders for the main road.

Endok did not care for gorillas, it seems.

Endok did not care for them, at all.

Endok, for whatever intextricable reason, had decided to bring a steel crossbow and quiver of bolts that day, she'd never shot before, never hunted, never trained, never took the life of any living thing. She was as pacifistic as they come.

But she _did not_ like gorillas.

There she sat, chiseling away at that boulder when in the corner of her eye she saw it, those bastard silverbacked beast. A fury of rage, a stretch of bowstring, 

**PLUNG**

Through the eye, one gorilla down

**PLUNG PLUNG**

Two more down, half the troop scattered in fear, two charged Endok full force. 

**PLUNG**

Make that one, the other reached her and swiped 

**THUD**
---
Dazed, the Gorilla stumbled back, Endok's mind flashed back to those days in the Mountainhome, she lived in a small cave her father had dug by hand. It was in the deep jungles in soft loam soil, dug deep into the shale bedrock beneath. Ever since her mother had died, it was just her and Dad... Until that fateful thursday, 5th granite, 184, when the Gorilla's came.
---
**WOOSH**

Endok ducks under a mighty swing from the great ape's hand, landing a solid upper cut with the front of her crossbow. The beast is down, reeling from the hit. Endok slowly loads one last round.

------

When the gorilla's came, it was with terrible raucous noise, the great thrashing of the waterfalls that lay on the other side of the mountainhome would have been drowned out by the hoops and hollars of the gorillas, and the other animals fleeing from them. Daddy told her to wait inside, so wait she did, in her room on the bottom floor, just a few feet of earth between her and the magma channels that led to the mountainhome and gave her father the ability to work. He had been a metalcrafter, building intricate and tiny things that only a dwarf could appreciate. Little metal things, pretty things which Endok loved, but no more pretty things for Endok. For hours she waited for her father, who had taken that old copper axe that hung over the mantle out, he went to protect the mountainhome from the raiding gorillas. He was not a novice, he had served in the Dwarven Guard for many years, devoting his weekends to train for the event of a goblin or elven siege. ""Those good-fer-nuthin' elfs,"" he'd say to Endok, ""all they ever got is wood for wood, never 'preciate true metalcraft..."" Endok would not see her father again.

Some two days after the hollars quieted, a knock came to the door, Endok had not eaten in those days, didn't drink, didn't sleep.

""Hello? Anyone here?"", said a voice, hollow and distant to Endok.

""Hello?""

""I-- I'm"", Endok struggled for words, ""I'm here.""

""Ma'am, my name is Urist Macbaddenews, and I'm afraid I have something for you, it's not a pleasant responsibility, but..."", he handed her a bloodstained waraxe, made of Copper, the same one that fit where the dustless outline lay above the mantle. She choked back a tear and looked up, he pointed her towards a box that lay outside. She knew what was inside, she knew it was her father. 

""Now, we are happy to take him to be buried in the grand halls of the mountainhome, he was a brave dwarf, and killed many of those beasts before he was finally killed. The King himself has expressed his desire for him to lie-in-state with the other heroes who fell, but I suggested that we ask the families first, and our Gracious King agreed with my small suggestion. Now Ma'am, would you like your father to be buried there? Or do you have some family plot you'd perhaps prefer? Speaking of... where's your mom, miss?"" 

Endok sobbed, she managed to say that her mother had died, and that her father should be buried next to her, in the tomb in the lowest level of the house. Endok left that day for a new home, she vowed never to build a metal thing, never to return, to build a new life somewhere where no gorilla would ever dare go.

----

**PLUNG WOOSH**

Endok's bolt flew past the ear of the great gorilla. She saw him, lying there helpless, she saw his little son, off 10 or 20 feet away. She looked at him, and in that instant they knew each other's life story, She knew his mate had died. Maybe she killed her, who knows. She knew that that little gorilla had nothing else, she knew she had become the monster that killed her father, but she wouldn't let that happen to her.

She fell into a deep depression after that, and less than two weeks later, Endok was found dead, with the tiniest metal thing in her hands, a little gorilla made of silver and menacing with spikes of obsidian. The tiniest metal thing, and an old copper waraxe sticking out of her chest.

------

*NB. This, of course, is somewhat embellished, but all the (non-flashback) events basically happened. A Engraver named Endok randomly decided to carry around a Steel xbow and bolts, picked a fight with a passing troop of gorillas, killed 5 of them, spared one (she missed from 1 tile away, no kidding), walked back, fell into a melancholy and killed herself after retrieving a metal trinket from the stockpile and a copper waraxe.

I'll start:


* Instead of wasting all your wood on barrels, you can make rock pots that are functionally the same.

* When placing a building like a cage or a statue, you can press ""x"" the expand the building list and tell you what's in the cage, or what the statues are of. 


* You can use the manager to dispatch jobs very easily. Press u -&gt; m -&gt; q, and start typing what you want to build. Select the object, and then type how many you want. The manager will then dispatch these jobs and spread them out among the workshops you have (this assumes you have a manager and an office for them).


* You don't need to individually assign each dwarf a bedroom. Just set it as a room first and set the size, and eventually a dwarf will come by and sleep in the bed, and claim it as their bedroom. (Sure beats 10 mins scrolling through the list manually assigning rooms).


* You can set macros to record and play back key sequences. Use ctrl+R to record a macro, ctrl+P to play it back, and ctrl+s/ctrl+l to save/load. For example, say you want to haul trade goods to the depot. Go into the depot menu and choose the category of goods you want (say, crafts). Now, press ctrl+r and hit [enter] [down] 10 times in a row, and press ctrl+r when you're done. Now, whenever you press ctrl+p, it will press [enter] [down] 10 times, so you can use this to select all your goods for hauling to the depot. 

* Bonus tip: Have a tower you want marksdwarves to defend? Build a cabinet or whatever in the tower, and set it as their training barracks. For extra dwarfiness, make sure that the only walkable tiles are on the edge of the tower, right next to the fortifications (fill in the rest of the tower with walls or fortifications or whatever). This ensures the marksdwarves will be standing adjacent to the fortifications and able to shoot. "	t5_2qyn1	True

Forgetting the bronze armour stashed in the down below, poor Moldath Akilolin had heroically rushed to the defence of the peasants and hogs who were getting accosted by the winged pests.

Talon and iron met in a frenzy of feathers and beard hair.  Deep furrows were torn in flesh and it hung in ragged strips from the hero in the end - but he stood, and rallied the militia to run off the birds.  Two miners joined in the fight - and of course Unib rushed back from the forests  across the river.  The four fought bravely and the pests were driven away.  Moldath was dealt blow after blow and his body gave out.  He lay on the ground, too tired to move.

""Go.""  He smiled to the others.  ""I 'av me axe.  Go and git yerselves in bronze.""

They went, but as soon as they were gone the parrots - their beady black eyes pits of remorselessness, pecked and pecked until Moldath was no more.  The militia returned seconds too late.

Unib rushed to his friend's side, inconsolable.  The bereaved looked to the sky and let loose a savage roar; fell and terrible.  As the booming came to an end, the miners - standing well back overheard a whisper:

Here is my vision: A track configured to launch a cart (with dwarf rider hopefully) in an arc above ground between series of launch and re-entry silos. The silos are elevated so ground units can't get in and further capped with bridges/hatches that are opened by pressure switches as the cart approaches.

This Rainbow Scout arcs through the air in a dangerous above-ground area scanning for hidden ambushers while remaining safe from attack and unable to run wildly away in fear and get themselves killed.

I'd been training up a squad of marksdwarves for months and they'd been pretty successful chasing off the occasional kobold ambush well before the armored bullyboys could be bothered to show up and do the heavy lifting.  

So - the walking dead show up.  

They take out a kobold band that had been hiding well the other side of the map - and beeline for the chicken sentry tower (i'm going to have to put roofs on those) which put them squarely in front of my bastion.  Fine by me I think - and chuck the marksdwarves up there to pick off the besiegers.  

I spot the 2 necromancers - one of them has the temerity to start a campfire - and i figure ok - we'll make short work of them.  They're certainly within range of the crossbows.  

This is when i discovered one of them was a ranger necromancer... who promptly picked off 2 of my marksdwarves.  The second necromancer must have been waiting for the curtain to go up - because he immediately turned my 2 defenders into husks - which promptly ripped the limbs from the dwarves nearby...
i watched in horror as the suddenly much faster dead bodies zoomed  down into the fortress and started killing -- all with the gate still firmly closed.

1329852322.0	pzozw	I've found a simple way to figure out who is a vampire in haunted biomes.  	KennySheep	139	28	64	"After many, many tries I managed to get a fortress going in a haunted biome where the dead auto-resurrect. I was using an airlock system to keep as many zombies as I could out of the main fortress, which made me very confused why zombies would randomly pop up throughout the fort. This mystery was solved when one of the zombies was found drained of blood before it got up and started trying to kill everyone. 

Before I got a justice system up and running to try to catch the blood sucker, an unfortunate mishap while letting in some immigrants let a hoard of zombies into the fort. My militia fought well against them, so did the masons I recruited after all of the militia died. After that there was just too many zombies to deal with, the only surviving dwarves being a couple men lucky enough to lock themselves in their bedrooms. Not wanting them to starve to death I sent them on a mad rush through the zombie hoard to the pantry, where they would at least have food and water. One dwarf was ripped apart the moment he left his room, the other made it without a scratch on him.

In fact, the zombies completely ignored him. I assigned him to military service and had him rip a few zombies apart, they still ignored him. I took him off military service and sent him back to work, he happily went back to building dolomite blocks surrounded by the reanimated corpses of every other member of the fortress. 

I may have no proof that this man is a vampire, as far as I know he was just a popular fellow with the zombies. It seems much more likely though that the zombies simply will not attack their fellow night creatures, even if the vampires do not show them the same respect. 

If I'm right about this, than vampires will definitely be given all of my zombie cleanup and slaughtering jobs from now on, and be given the best rooms and a steady stream of useless masons to eat for their great service to my fort. This particular vampire I sent to the circus, since as neat as it would be to play a lone vampire in a fort full of zombie bros this man had eaten a few dwarves I was rather fond of and I was mad at him.   

**TL;DR:** Open up your fort to the zombies and let them kill every living thing in your fort. The survivor was probably a vampire. "	t5_2qyn1	True

1336191117.0	t7y00	Welcome to Ringwild, Fortress of the Dead.  Population: 1.	Vondre	122	14	16	"It had been such a good day.

Work on the guard towers was nearing completion.  The mechanics were busy preparing traps for the next inevitable goblin invasion.  The windmills were creaking in the crisp mountain air, the crops were in full bloom, and food and ale were plentiful.  The marksdwarves complained good-naturedly about having to practice in the sun, but the glare and heat were far preferable to the horrors of cave adaptation.  From the barracks came the clanking and grunting of the melee squad honing their skills.

A sudden goblin attack had left the fort wary, and several dwarves had been found in their beds, bloodless, desiccated. A vampire was on the loose, somewhere, but they had yet to slip up.

Ringwild's walls were strong.  Its forges were hot, its craftsmen were legend, its halls were vast and opulent.  And the Windy Grains knew of these treasures, of the riches to be had.  And so they came.

The smell of death on the air.

The horror of fifty corpses, trudging in unison towards the walls.

The shrieks of the goblin ambush as they were torn to shreds by rotting hands.

The shouts of dwarven panic as they attempted to close up the walls.

The masons were the first to fall. Fearlessly running to the open wall, hauling stones, attempting to shore up the open wall. Bolts whizzed past them, lodging uselessly in shambling flesh. Decaying hands, ripping, tearing, striking.

The melee squad charged forward.  Two corpses fell, three, four, and then the horde was upon them. Dwarf after dwarf, ripped apart, lives cut short at the hands of the undead.

The rest of the fort was soon among the ranks of the dead, raised back into unholy motion by dark powers.

Except one.

He still stood in the main courtyard, axe flashing left to slice off a leg, right to sever an arm, back, forth, an impenetrable wall of razor-sharp iron.  He darted from zombie to zombie, reducing the undead to piles of butchered meat. He was known to Ringwild as Nomald Cobaltseasons, the elderly, battle-scarred master of the axe.

For months he fought the undead, searching for the invisible masters of the rotting army, to no avail.  He fought without tire, without food without drink, single-mindledy crushing every undead abomination in his view, seemingly blind to their inevitable reanimation moments later.

Until, one day, he stopped. He hadn't eaten, hadn't drank, hadn't laid down for months.

He dropped his axe.

He wandered, thirsty, back into the halls of Ringwild, but the stocks of alcohol did not beckon him.

He passed the great dining room, with its barrels filled to the brim with the feasts of master chefs, but did not slow.

Nomald walked (slower, now, than before) the familiar smooth rock towards the masonry, ignoring the piles of furniture that had never been used, *would* never be used...

And, as the spirits of his restless comrades swirled around the room, he began to carve, slowly, painstakingly, a coffin, and a large slab of rock.

He dragged them both to the center hall of Ringwild; once the Stronghold of the Sabres of Helping, now the Slaughterhouse of the Windy Grains.

He took up hammer and chisel with shaking hands, carved the slab as best he could. Four hundred thirty-two years of life, and not a single engraving to his name.

And, with a final effort, he hauled himself into his coffin. He closed his eyes, and waited for the wailing spirits to end the long, bloody history of Nomald Cobaltseasons, known to the world as Das Clincheddreamy: the Unkempt Word of Splashes, murderer of five dwarves in Ringwild and thousands more across the world; vampire. 
________________________________________________

It was an enormous siege, with all of their mounted riders coming from the north across the river as well as a contingent of trolls presumably lead by Usbu the troll leatherworker coming from the south. A large section of the southern part of the river was already frozen rendering my cage traps on the bank of the river highly ineffective as the trolls ran across the ice and over my bridge. One troll ran ahead of the others and was chasing a small child and a mechanic who, just as the troll was about to reach the child threw himself at the troll delivering a barrage of punches buying the child just enough time to escape before the mechanic was gored to death.

By this time I expected the enormous amount of mounted riders to have gone through the 3 tile wide tunnel I had made that allowed access from the northern side of the river to directly inside my walls but instead they ran into the edge of the river where the water was lowest and became trapped by the current. After ten minutes of them just sitting in the shallows I realized my smaller squad of 3 people had managed to kill all of the trolls (about 10) attacking from the south without 2 of them even being harmed, the third however, was brutally killed.

I now sat watching as the siege of still roughly 35 goblins and their 35 mounts just remained in the river while my highly developed squad of 10 just sat inside the walls waiting for them to do something. I now began to fear that if they did eventually make it out of the river they would greatly outnumber the cage traps I had placed at the entrance as well as slaughter my squad of ten without even trying when *Poof* the entirety of the river became ice, the 65 became 0 and the siege indicator ticked off of my screen while I roared with laughter. 

TL;DR 65 invaders all decided to cross the river to my fortress but it froze while they were all in the water."	t5_2qyn1	True

The very first orders we received were foolish, but we did our duty. Two fledgling miners set to work carving a wide column of staircases, three by three to a depth of thirty levels, straight from the green hell that was the surface.

That first column of stairs gave just a glimpse of what promised to be a profitable fortress. Most of the levels we passed were useless chert, but as we decended we found metal ores, minor gems and even some platinum in these first walls.

At a respectable 25 levels below the surface we received the orders to begin excavating our new home. The walls were all of marble, and while the rough walls and floors were simple now, we knew they would one day shine bright with our accomplishments.

The main level was slowly excavated, while those on the surface were ordered to strip the land bare. Every tree, every bush was to be removed. With so little land to build beneath, we knew every tree would be precious until we found the caverns and their precious fungiwood spores.

With the surface clearing, and the main level beginning far below, the first level below the green was quickly dug clear for farms. We knew it would be a hard few years with nothing but plump helmets but it was better then starving.

With essential mining done, the first of the big projects was started. A single stair shaft was sunk next to the river, dropping 27 levels to a 10x10 cistern, two levels deep. A bit of fancy engineering ensured the pressure from such a column of water would not flood the fortress, and the river was breached. In moments the cistern filled and while not our first choice, we had access to water no matter the season.

From there our fortress progressed smoothly. We received many immigrants, built out a small steel industry and small clothing industry. The next project, a small waterfall in the midst of the fortress was complete, although not immediate, success. When the mountainhome sent their first traders, we sent them home with hundreds of trinkets, useless here but easy to send home as show of wealth. Maybe that was our downfall.

Within a season we were besieged, though we laughed at the attempt. We should have known it was a merely an advance force. Three undead goblins stumbled upon the land. The surface, having direct access to our main stairwell, had small chert block wall and a simple marble door to ward them off, and the wardogs left to pasture were sufficient to end the threat. We stowed the twice dead corpses below ground in a cave dug separate from our fortress, just in case. We should have known what was coming next, but we were foolish.

A few season passed and we continued to grow. A small force of twenty otherwise useless dwarfs were equipped with steel plate and battle axes and sent off to train against the future unknown.

When the next attack came, we were entirely unprepared. While the first force contained a measly three animated goblin corpses, the second contained dozens if not a hundred or more. Goblins, dwarfs, even necromancers were among them. In a panic, we were all ordered back to the fortress, but still we lost some to the hungry dead.

With the outer gates sealed, and the horde waiting just beyond, we brooded. Already we had taken losses that only swelled their ranks. Despite the odds, the militia commander was confident that twenty well armed dwarfs would be enough, even against 5 to 1 odds.

So twenty dwarfs assembled at the top of the stairs, behind a single sealed marble door, and the order was given. The door was unsealed and the militia rushed outside the walls.

While the militia commander was confident in his men, the mayor was not. After the first civilians fell to the horde and the fortress was successfully sealed, the order was given to produce slabs. An endless stream of memorial slabs. A memorial slab for every soul within the fortress. The mayor and his crafter may not have been popular, but they were ready.

Twenty fully armed and armored dwarfs are indeed a threat to wary of. Except these lazy bastards had spent all their days drinking and partying. None had faced real combat, few had spared even with each other, and half had forgotten their arms or armor. It was a massacre. Even those few undead they did manage to down were not out for long and in the end the noble, foolhardy, militia rose and joined the ranks of the enemy.

With the failure of the militia the fortress stayed on alert, but there was a problem. A goblin arm severed from a corpse landed up on top of the wall that ringed the stairwell at the surface. A blind, mindless arm, animate and crawling around. It played hell with the nerves of the civilians, who could see the thing every time they brought seeds to the farm or plants back. In the end, the main stairwell was abandoned. Walled off at the top and bottom of the fortress, with a new shaft dug in its place, it was a folly that should never have occurred.

The mayor in his wisdom decided that where a militia can fail an army could not. Steel production was doubled and new veins of metal ore and coal were breached. The bookkeeper probably saw it coming, but he was too busy with his numbers to think what they meant. The coke was exhausted, and the wood was all gone. With no access to the trees on the surface, there was only one option. Dig.

That same season we breached the caverns. The precious fungiwood spores rushed into the fortress and the caverns were resealed. Levels near the surface were quickly cleared to provide fertile ground for growth, and we were back on track. But the mayor had a glimpse of the caverns before they were sealed. He decided that there was no reason we should not harvest the fungiwood already grown.

A new militia was outfitted, still without any training, and sent to guard the entrance to the fortress while a miner dug a more proper route into the caverns.

The moment he finished, we heard the doom coming one and all. A forgotten beast, winged and spitting noxious fumes rushed the militia. In moments they had hacked off his wings, but could do no more. The beast finished the militia and climbed to the fortress proper.

I don't know why he did it, but the mayor in his dispair ordered the unsealing of the surface gate. Maybe he thought one evil would destroy the other. The undead horde surged in from above, while the forgotten beast rampaged below.

I am the last of them. Hiding in a corner, barely sane, and scribbling this tale. The dead fill all the hallways. The beast prowls among them. I do not know if they fight or not, but I know they are coming for me.

I am not sane, but soon I will walk with my brothers, my sisters, my children. Soon I will roam these halls once again. Soon I will rise forever.

I pride myself on taking very good care of my dwarves; even in the event of catastrophic tragedy, the opulence of my civilization is usually enough to placate even the most sorrowful of dwarves. I learned today that there is a hard limit to what my dwarves will tolerate.

I was using DFhack's 'autodump destroy' to clear up some clutter and help out my FPS. In so doing, I accidentally destroyed *every single item of clothing* my dwarves owned. Literally everything; shirts, trousers, socks, shoes. I always assumed that anything shown in the stocks screen was unused or unassigned, so I didn't think anything of it.

My 120 dwarves went from 100% ecstatic, to 100% miserable, in less than a game month. I panicked and immediately assigned some dwarves to making clothing, but they simply cannot keep up. 

There is currently a riot happening in my royal dining room. About 20 completely naked dwarves are throwing tables around the room, destroying my (lovingly created) gold statue garden, beating the shit out of each other, and I'm pretty sure a few of them are fighting a lion.

My clothing makers are working desperately, but I'm not so sure I can recover from this.

Let it be known that my 8-year royal metropolis fell because of dwarven nudity anxiety.

edit: an elven siege just arrived. I waited eight god damn years for an elven siege, constructing a labyrinth and elaborate traps for just such an event, but no. They just *have to* show up during a naked riot.

edit2: I sealed off my entrance before the elves arrived, but one particularly pissed off dwarf just smashed the cages in my zoo. There's now two black bears, a lion, three dingomen, a goblin, and a spider in the mix.

You hear people squeeing over the next CoD, and the next Pokemon, and the next Final Fantasy.
""Oooh look at the pretty graphics!"" 
""Oh my god they're adding three new spells/weapons/abilities!"" 
""Oh my god, a six hour campaign!""
""Oh my god, a new enemy type!""

Oh my god: everything just stands in place and waits for shit to happen. 

Sure, it looks pretty, and I like good graphics as much as the next gamer, but even games like Two Worlds Two got utterly boring towards the end of the swamp area an all the pretty graphics in the world weren't going to save it. I beat that game, went for a little wander around the world, realised that it wasn't as big and interesting as it looked and thought ""Well, that's that done."" 

The amount of work that went into the last DF update is bloody staggering! 
The random, insane occurrences that crop up in play are both insane and brilliant. 
Each new world with several hundred years of history, in which several hundred thousand randomly generated characters do things and interact with each other, built cities, wage wars, found religions and political groups, defile temples and tombs, gain status, form relationships, breed, die, and on and on.
The fact that you can impact these worlds in hilarious and potentially significant ways.
The insane combat mechanics which rely on insane body maps with tissues and arteries and bones.
The fact that you're very much mortal in adventure more - you get stabbed in the face, or shot in the neck, you're dead. You can kill a thousand people, and something will crossbow you from twenty feet away and there's no coming back from that. You lose a foot, or your hands, all your teeth, your tongue, or whatever: assuming you don't bleed t death, you're going to have a REALLY hard time continuing, so you might as well retire and start again. Let the legends live on in some random town, until they get bitten a were-iguana three years later, or learn to be a necromancer, and go destroy that nice little village that just sprang up...

I could go on, but you get the idea. 
I don't rule out every new game that comes along, and DF certainly isn't all that I play, but for the most part it has become one of the standards by which I judge everything else. 
People tell me about new games coming out like they're really deep - Skyrim and Final Fantasy (insert number here) are a brilliant example - and I tend to think ""Meh.""

This is why games like Din's Curse, X3, etc, hook me for such a long time: the game does stuff when I'm not looking. If I sit around for a while, something else is happening. The AI doesn't wait around for my arse to saunter over to some idiot with a question mark over their heads, tell me some bollocks about an urgent mission, and if I return a year later say ""Oh thank god you were just in time"" - it just goes and destroys a bit of the world, or kills the NPCs family, or whatever.

It turned out that there was a sufficient, if not plentiful, amount of ore in the area as well.  Wood supply was an issue, but with the caravans, they could maintain, although they would never be awash in it.

The metals industry came online.  They had a substantial farm set up and started brewing and cooking.  There was plenty of rock for crafts to trade for stuff when the caravans showed up.  There was even sand, so a decent glassmaking industry could be set up.

The geography of the area happened that the entrance to the fort was between two cliff faces, in a valley of sorts, with only two entrances on each end.  It was easy enough to wall off one entrance and put a drawbridge there for the caravans.  Then they started making glass cages and serrated glass discs (while not scarce, metal was still too strongly needed for armor and weapons) to make the other opening leading to their entrance a trapped path, ready to thin out any invading forces before they reached the meagre military.

The minotaur was no big deal.  The couple of ambushes were easily dispatched.

In a migrant wave came a dwarf who seemed suspiciously capable.  Investigation into his past discovered a vast array of previous citizenships.  A check of the teeth and yep... vampire.  

The dwarves' usual method of vampire disposal was to set them loose in the caverns and wall up behind them, until the problem solved itself via unwanted visitors.  This time, however, he was given a set of halfway decent armor and a pick before being set loose and the entrance walled up behind him.  He dug down, level by level, dispatching any number of underground creepy-crawlies with a swift pick to the face, until, in the third cavern layer...

**You have discovered a curious underground structure**

As the dwarves knew, ""curious underground structures"" are usually guarded by legions of undead.  However, being of their kind, the vampire explorer would be able to safely enter the underground structure without risk.  This was an unprecedented opportunity for the dwarves.  He proceeded into the structure to find the treasure in the center.

Meanwhile, upstairs, metal was flowing from the foundries.  Armor was being created for the now-halfway decent military.  Food and booze were plentiful.  Living spaces were made for each dwarf in the fortress.  Things were going smoothly for nearly 200 dwarves.  *Too smoothly.*

**A vile force of darkness has arrived**

The lever was pulled, the drawbridge raised, and the alarms sounded for all citizens to stay inside.  The military was stationed in the barracks, behind the entrance, and they waited for the siege to break against their traps, and, failing that, to have their remnants mopped up by the military. 

Including the Voracious Cave Crawler mounts....  And the squad of War Cave Dragons...  And half dozen goblin weapon masters....  A total of **98** invaders.

It could be worse.  Possibly?  No, probably not.  

The first squads hit the traps.  And sprung them.  The second and third squads mostly made it through.  Then the cave dragons and cave crawlers walked right over them.  So did the fourth, fifth and *Holy Armok there are at least fifty invaders inside the fortress.*

The military was wiped out.  The goblin crossbow squad laid down a deadly barrage of bolts into the waiting military, the cave dragons and cave crawlers annihilating anyone left standing.  

The invaders spread through the fort, smashing buildings and killing civilians.  An emergency draft was called.  Six squads of untrained recruits were pressed into duty.  Most of them died.  Enough of them did enough damage to the remaining invaders that some of them turned tail and ran out of the fortress.  That still left a dozen cave dragons, cave crawlers and goblins running around inside the fortress.

The combat made its way through the fortress until the creatures were cornered in the bedroom level.  More recruits fell, mostly to the dragons and crawlers.  More were drafted.  Then some migrants arrived.  The fresh, new dwarves were hastily assigned to squads.  They were able to pick up a few weapons and hastily don a couple of pieces of armor before running down to the apartment block to take on the six invaders remaining.

One-by-one the crawlers and dragons were struck down.  The price was horrible.  Bodies littered the halls and wounded dwarves lay incapacitated on the floors.  55 dwarves were left alive at the end of it.  The handful of dwarves who were conscious were incensed at the carnage and destruction and loss of fellow dwarves.  Fights broke out, things were thrown.

Then the insanity started.  Dwarves were struck with melancholy, moping around the rotting carcasses of fellow dwarves.  They went stark, raving, mad, running around and babbling amidst the destruction.  A recruit went berserk and started attacking anything and everything before being struck down himself.  Dwarves lying unconscious in the halls started dying of thirst and hunger from lack of anyone to care for them.  Tinworks was in its death throes.

*Except for the vampire explorer, waiting patiently in the center of a demonic fortress, stationed next to an upright, adamantine scimitar.*

---

As best I can tell, there are 9 remaining able-bodied dwarves among the  55 who are alive at all.  There is miasma everywhere.  There's still plenty of supplies - food and booze and armor and weapons - for the dwarves that remain, but I'm awaiting the inevitable tantrum spiral into doom.  It's possible the fort proper may survive.  Most of the uninjured dwarves are the new migrants, who haven't been exposed to *too much* tragedy, just yet anyway, and don't know any of the other, dead citizens, so they may stay sane and relatively content.

I was quickly laying out some zones and designations in the 2nd cavern: pasturing animals, designating plant gathering and woodcutting. I move on to something else, but after a minute I get an announcement:

Urist has cancelled task: dangerous terrain!

Oh shiii... Magma was oozing out of the magma tube and all over my horses and llamas which I had just put there! Apparently when I was designating I accidentally designated a large section to be mined out, and one of the corners was the wall of the magma tube. I ordered civilians into an interior burrow, hoping to save some of the livestock too. But it was too late. They caught on fire and their fat melted. I lost nine horses, two llamas and a miner that way. Even worse, the breach was at the highest z-level of the cavern, so that whole cavern was  doomed to be flooded with magma. I was also afraid that it would drain the volcano low enough that I would not have magma access for my magma traps up top.

Then I came up with a stunningly simple solution. The cavern layer above this one had a large lake. I dug a channel from the lake to the tile directly above the breach. I put in a floodgate, pulled the lever, and  let the water drain directly on the magma next to the breach. The surrounding magma tiles quickly solidified, including the breach. I patched up the magma tube! I let the water run and solidify the rest of the magma. My economic exploitation of the cavern will resume.

On my very next embark, I chose haunted surroundings so I knew I would need to be able to defend myself.  When choosing my embark setup, I have the realization that it is now possible for me to embark with 50 war doe rabbits at a reasonable price seeing as they cost very little.  Done deal.

As with any good dwarf fortress story, my plans did not pan out as I had anticipated.  As soon as the cart came to a stop, the dwarves become aware of a half rotten, undead cow mooing in the distance.  The one military dwarf collected his leather gear, his copper axe, and his swarm of ferocious rabbits and charged at the beast.  

The fuzzy storm of death engulfed the rotting bovine.  Though it seemed like an amazing idea at the time to bring a warren of rabbits to tear my enemies into small, carrot-sized pieces, it actually turns out that rabbits aren’t that strong and the foe was one-hitting them into rabbit chunks.  My immediate reaction was to hope that there were enough rabbits that the cow would sustain enough damage while waiting the time it takes to one-shot 50 doe rabbits.  Unfortunately, it took only half of the rabbits being smashed into higher entropy objects for my military dwarf to go insane from losing so many pets.  

While the decaying cow finished off the last of the rabbits, the remorseful bunny lover went to town on the rest of the embark crew, leaving nothing but a flutter of turkeys.  In the end, he himself was killed by the cow.  The only remnants of our fledgling expedition were a cart, a pool of vomit, and a mound of scattered rabbit parts.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to grow pipe weed in your farms? It could even require curing at a farmer's workshop, if we wanted to complicate it further (and, of course, we do). Smoking would require a pipe in the dwarf's inventory, and these pipes could be crafted out of wood, bone, stone, clay, glass, or precious metal. Smoking from a nice pipe could give the dwarf a happy thought each time he or she used it.

Additionally, and to make it even more complex, smoking fine pipe weed would give dwarfs a happy thought, but over time they could become addicted to smoking. This wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, but if this addicted dwarf was unable to smoke he could throw a tantrum or something.

Hi everyone,

Don't want to wait for DT to be completely updated? I've patched together all of the memory offsets found on the bay12 forums by stevedore, DwarfEngineer and dyn and packaged it in a zip file.

The end result is that you will be able to view and edit your dwarves' assigned labours, their current job, happiness, but not mostly anything else. 

Note: I take no credit for any of the work whatsoever. I was going to start working on getting it up and running, but, from what I can see, there are already four or five C programmers working on it. If you want to praise anyone for their hard work, send stevedore, DwarfEngineer and dyn, on the bay12 forums, a thank you note :).

***
Anyways, if anyone wants it, here's a link:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59858051/DT-TemporaryFix.zip
***
Instructions: 

1. Download the latest version of DT.
2. Merge the contents of the zip file with your DT installation folder.

Yet again, this is not an official release. Keep in mind that this program (DT) modifies memory and may not work as intended. Depending on how (un)lucky you are, it might take a few minutes to read your dwarves.

1360195935.0	1816hs	Long story, but because of you guys, I killed a dragon.	SlaveOne	111	9	36	"Haha, not because of your tips, but just because your sub exists.

So about two months ago, I got bored and started asking my phone to take me to random subreddits. Maybe it has to do with all the other game related subs I already subscribed to, but this seems more like fate to me. I'm a huge gamer who hasn't been impressed with anything lately. I like the Morrowind games, but even they get dull after I've done every quest in like two weeks. If you can believe it, r/dwarffortress was the last random sub I hit.

Last, because I had know idea what was going on. People talking about defeating dragons and cyclops, weird cartoons of dwarves doing odd things, and discussions on how best to build their fortress. I was more than intrigued. To the point that after watching y'all talk for a month, I downloaded the game.

I think it took me this last month to just survive. I spent my first weekend doing nothing but watch online tutorials. Then another week reading the wiki, trying to setup a fort and simple make it a year without dying of thirst or hunger. Eventually I made it far enough to start making things, but then goblins showed up and I had no military. Well, we all know the learning curve.

Fast forward to just now. I finally figured out how to embark right, picked a sweet spot, and then dug in. Channeled off the entire outside, built some drawbridges, and cut myself off from the world. I spent about the last three years watching migrants and traders get slaughtered by goblins that were just sitting outside the fort. They finally left, so I went out and began the process of claiming a giant pile of items they didn't seem to care about.

Enter the dragon.

I didn't actually get my bridges up for every ambush, so my first and only military consisted of 10 dwarves. 6 of them didn't make it this far, and because I was so comfortable behind my chasm and walls, I only ever replaced one of them, bring my total military up to a whopping 5. I'm thinking, ""Holy shit, I need to get that bridge raised now or I'm dead.""

Cancelled every job, told them to press the lever, and then followed the dragon. Followed him all the way over my bridge and into the fort. I let out a sigh and said, ""Fuck."" Keep in mind, I've never seen a dragon before. This is my first encounter with anything bigger than a goblin or thief.

Then it starts blowing fire.

What the fuck. 

I watch my livestock fry, a couple dwarves try to run, but they get dropped. Meanwhile, I've called in The Lucky Tours. All I'm thinking is, ""Well, I guess that was fun. I'll just have to be more prepared next time.

Then, out of what I can only suppose is smoke, I see one of my soldiers pop up next to the dragon. Then another. And another. My marksman lines up outside of the smoke, and starts letting off shots. Suddenly, I'm like, ""Wait, are they going to win this?""

Bam! Giant red D on the field and my dwarves headed back to the fort like it's no big thing. It never occured to me that they've been hanging out in their barracks and training room for the past three years doing nothing but getting ready for this moment. I seriously was so pumped, I paused it and came here to tell y'all.

Thanks for making this sub, I love this game! I honestly can't see myself playing anything else for a long, long time. I haven't even figured out how to forge stuff yet...

Alright, back to digging!

I formed a small band of military dwarves and opened a cave, unleashing the wrath of troglodytes and other various cave varmits onto my fortress. Suddenly, a troll spawned(who apparently was named Sweettears and had killed two gobbos already) charged up the cave stairs and wiped out my two swordsdwarves with a few lucky fell swoops. However, my dozing glassmaker was unaware of the troll rampaging around the bedroom area of my fortress. Before long, the troll was breaking down the doors and beds of every bedroom she could find, and eventually found my peaceful glassmaker. She ran into the glassmaker's room and began to frenzily punch it, punch after punch. Even as much as it beat it, it could not kill my sleeping dwarf. This went on for a week and a half, as you all know dwarves love their sleep. At this point, the glassmaker had bruises all over her body and had lost the ability to walk or grab because of them, also exhausted and in extreme pain, all while sleeping. The troll, on the other hand was in an exhausted state from doing so much physical work, and was faint. The newly assigned military dwarves weren't aware of the troll, and as on their rounds they dropped by her bedroom and saw the beast repeatedly punching her. Armed with only wooden swords, the three of them entered the room and began to fight the troll. The troll, distracted by the meatbag glassmaker, did not even notice the two soldiers before his fingers on her left hand were cut off. Finally, the troll fell with multiple stabs to the back from the soldiers, blood all over the room's walls. To this day there is an engraving of the event in the dining hall, in diorite.

They have this academic bent, retreating to their communal towers where they peacefully write book after book and compare notes.  Some of the books are tributes to people they know, some are autobiographies, some are details about fortresses, and a large number are about other books... but a significant number seem to be about their struggles to improve the planet (Can [NAME] Save The World?, [NAME] and the Coming Troubles, The World Without [NAME], [NAME] Is The Way).  

It's like these necromancers believe they're the last remnants of enlightened and literate civilization in a vast dark age, while the rest of the world languishes in caverns, guzzling booze and carving pictograms in the walls.  Yet these selfsame academics occasionally feel the need to ambush fortresses with hordes of walking dead.

What's their deal? Are they outcasts who gravitate toward each other because normal society shuns them? Or do they have an intelligent agenda to remake or repair society which just happens to incorporate hordes of undead?

After a while I decide I want to feed her some goblins, and arrange to drop some de-goblinited prisoners into her room.

Turns out she's a pretty good fighter, and tears them several new ones.

After she's done and gotten a new name suffix (the fresh hold) from breaking a bunch of their scrawny ankles apparently, I decided to let her run through the fort unhindered.

As I'm waiting for my dwarfs to (d)ump a literal mountainside worth of stone down the volcano's lava tube, I begin following her around.

Now I'm imagining her as a kinda tough but cutesy anime-style catgirl, leaping around my fortress killing vermin, digging around the armory, following my dedicated horde of cooks.

All this time, I'm creating a story in my head above and beyond anything that can be really justified with the few pixels that the Mayday tileset provides for the character.

And then it hit me, DF is epic exactly like LEGOs are epic. Not because the toy/game in and of itself is detailed or polished or feature-rich, but for the simple fact that it actually engages my imagination, it takes me from being a simple player to being a co-storyteller alongside Toady's game engine. I recall that [Extra Credits did a segment on this amazing aspect of good games](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/extra-credits/3555-The-Role-of-the-Player) and then I recalled the same thing happening back in the day during my first runthrough of The Bards Tale. 

It's not about graphics, or complexity, or flexibility. It is about leaving us just the right ambiguity in the right places that our own imaginations fill in the gaps and make the experience uniquely personal.

This is why DF is epic, because we use it as a framework to make our own story, something uniquely ours.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, now go make Armok proud.

1277818575.0	ck51o	My fortress turned into a horror movie.	Glyphic	106	8	17	"It all started with a goblin siege. My drawbridge was already down, so I figured I would let my military have some fun. I posted them in my killing room behind fortifications and waited for the goblins to get hit by my traps before they got within range. 

Suddenly, one of my marksdwarves enters a martial trance. ""Oh, neat"" I said. So, Urist McCrossbow walks out from behind the fortifications and right into the midst of the enemy. He fires a single bolt--which misses--and leaves the trance. He is promptly torn apart.

Mind you, his squad had been almost endlessly training, and a good portion of my fortress had been idling since last season, so when he died, roughly 30% of my fortress went into a melancholy. 

Except for the guards.

The guards went into a homicidal rage. My legendary wrestlers strolled into the killing field in trances and tore everyone apart. Limbs were flying. The goblins who tried to run were chased down and thrown off of cliffs. 

The siege was broken, but so was morale. No one would work. Carcasses lay rotting in the butcher shop. My military were so distressed that they wouldn't leave their posts. They died of thirst soon after. 

Suddenly, a dwarf in a rage destroys a cage. This cage was holding a titan. It is a massacre. Now roughly every hall in my fortress is filled with corpses and miasma. MY population dropped from 104 to 60 in ten minutes. Remaining dwarves are huddled in fear in a statue garden.

Suddenly, my tanner starts laughing maniacally. He grabs the nearest corpse and makes his way toward the surface. ""Great,"" I thought, ""he must be taking it to the graveyard.""

Nope.

He claimed a tanner's shop. He started a mysterious construction.

He made a dwarf skin toga. From the skin of what was possibly one of his closest friends.

He put it on and went about his day.

1317886044.0	l2sk4	Dwarven politics are no better than anyone else's: a rant in D Miner	unmaned	120	25	23	"So I've got a pretty good fort going, lots of steel, lots of silver, and I'd just learned that I could recall my Mayor without bloodshed (since the last one wanted things made of bismuth). I replaced the Mayor with my current Duke, with whom I'm totally in love because he always wants things made out of iron. *In a steel factory.* So, so far so good.

In comes a human caravan and a diplomat. And in comes a siege, the sixth or seventh this fort's faced. No big deal, but since I rely on traps a fair amount, I don't much want humans ticked at me--I hear they're not as dumb as goblins. 

So I make with the rescue operations, and the humans get in, but a few of my archers got shot up pretty badly by an elite crossbow goblin. I then spend a bunch of time mopping up the rest of the invasion. It's not until a good while later when I go back to see how the hospital is treating them.

But something I did not expect is going down in the hospital. The human diplomat is kneeling by one of the beds. Confused, I check the identity of the patient; it's my former bookkeeper, who has been lying in the hospital unconscious for three years. I hit Esc to check who the mayor is, but before I can hit n, I see:

""A human diplomat has left unhappy.""

Too late, I check, and yup, they did it. While I wasn't looking, dwarves elected Urist McSchiavo to public office. While I understand the appeal of a brain-dead politician, they don't make good negotiators. And now I'm rapidly losing the international respect I'd worked so hard to gain.

1287873733.0	dvgns	One of my fortresses finally had enough effect on the world to cause a change to the Golden Age.	DwarfFortressPlayer	109	10	72	"I have been playing my current fortress for just eight years (in game, not in real life ;) ), but it has already apparently had a huge impact on the world. Two notable achievements so far have been destroying the HFS with just ten legendary dwarves. No more demons have spawned since then.  The other notable acheivement was killing a goblin demon king.

Recently I built a bunch of adamantine weapons to boost my fortresses wealth and it evidently attracted the local goblin law-giver, a twisted three-eyed deer that breathed fire. He arrived with a huge siege force, mostly mounted on Rutherers and Jabberers.

I had already fought off a similar siege in the past, and had conquered the demons below my fort, so I wasn't overly worried. My two squads of fighters, now wielding adamantine axes quickly destroyed the goblins, but then spent a couple days fighting the demon king.

Not only did this demon king breathe fire that my dwarves had to constantly block with their adamantine shields, but its simple leather armor was evidently magical, because his troll leather cloak deflected even an adamantine axe.

Looking back through the logs it looks like my dwarves managed to bruise the demon king until it dropped one of its gloves, then one of my axe lord's lopped off the demon king's right hand, then the left hand. They took out the demon king piece by piece until it finally died.

The triumphant dwarf who landed the killing blow promptly renamed the steel axe she was attached to.  As my dwarves got to work cleaning up the massacre an announcement window popped up saying that the world had entered the golden age.

I looked it up on the wiki and this apparently means that the civilizations are expanding without or with very little warfare. Has anyone else had this happen before?  As I have never killed a goblin demon king before what happens now?  Will the goblins never come again?

If so it might be fairly boring, having already conquered HFS, and the goblins.  All that is left to do is complete my epic cast obsidian engraved tower into the skies.

**Edit: Screenshots are now attached**

How I conquered the HFS:

The attack center had a long one tile wide hallway with green glass doors and masterpiece spike traps, ten spikes to a tile.  The demons had to pause to destroy the door, and they got wounded by the spikes.  Most of them only received a broken limb or two, so they weren't too weakened by the time they got to my dwarves.  It was a very close battle, especially since my military commander got hit in the guts and spent most the time puking.

http://i.imgur.com/C8a6x.png -- Spikes up.

The military dwarves were put in that narrow corridor behind the six doors that sealed off the rest of the fortress.  The downward stairway leads to the pipe through the magma.  My dwarves already cleaned away the bodies, though they haven't cleaned off all the gross demon goo, hence the gray stains on the innermost green glass spikes.  I was fortunate that none of the demons had any really bad side effects in their blood.  Some of the dwarves got feverish and got temporary cases of narcolepsy, but they all survived.  It took almost a full year to get all the 10k weight demon corpses up the steps into the refuse heaps in my obsidian cast fortress tower:

http://i.imgur.com/ltFTW.png - The demon corpses in the refuse heap. (Oh, in case you are wondering what that thing in the center of the room is read the wiki about the dwarven water reactor: http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Water_wheel  I prefer to refer to it as the washing machine.  It is slightly exploity, as it is a perpetual motion machine, but it is the only sensible solution for powering the giant pump stacks that I am using the haul magma and water up to cast my obsidian fortress.)

Here is what an admantine pipe looks like, and what hell looks like below:

Here is the aftermath of the goblin demon king's seige.  It will take another few seasons to get all the crap and body parts cleaned up:

http://i.imgur.com/tHHZy.png

I cast another level onto the tower specifically to hold all the body parts.  It looks like I'll need another two or three levels though:

The demon king's corpse is just to the right of the yellow X cursor in the above screenshot.  Here are its stats.  Notice its weight.  It took about a week for one of the poor dwarves to haul it up to the top of the tower.

Last but not least, from the civilization screen you can see that the goblin land now no longer has any important leaders:
