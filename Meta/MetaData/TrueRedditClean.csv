1368379095.0	1e6wgm	Here's exactly how American expats go crazy in Central America, explained by an expat	NoblePeasant5	2840	1209	678	"Quick intro: I'm an American and I spent 7 years in Central America before getting out. For the sake of anonymity I don't want to say where, but after seeing a bunch of stories about expatriates going crazy in Central America, I'd like to offer my perspective




To understand expats, we first must understand travelers, because all expats start as travelers. It takes a certain type of person to trek it out as an expat for any length of time, which is why I'm going to go into the psychology of it a bit.  


I divide them into two subcategories: short-term and medium-term travelers.   



Short-term travel is the most common, and is something that most people have experienced. There's a hierarchy among short-term travelers based on the distance from home that you've traveled. For example, an American person who has been to Japan allows himself to feel slightly more superior than somebody who has been to Poland, and infinitely more superior than somebody has been to Mexico. Indeed, there's almost a sense of pity in the way that they talk to people who have traveled less than them. 

They are what I call ""commodity-based"" travelers, since that is how they treat landmarks, cities, and countries. Normally they will have a list of things that they'd like to see, and bounce around from place to place stuck in the golden haze of sensory overload. They want to see the Sistene Chapel in person not because it's an educational experience, but for the sense of awe that they get. They want to meet some locals not because they want to make a longlasting friendship, but because the locals are a novelty. 
 
This type of traveler is the least likely to convert to an expat since they normally do not want to commit to one place, when there's so much more to see. Some of them, however, will eventually pack up and buy a ticket to some exotic location for medium-term travel. 

Medium-term travelers will stay in one place between three to twelve months. They rent an apartment, live in a residential area, and shop for food in the same places as the locals. They get to know the lay of the land and pick up some of the language, often studying it full-time. Without a doubt, they get a more nuanced understanding of their new home. Yet there is a different, but equally potent, romantic ideal that takes over the medium-term traveler. 

I call it the Hemmingway experience. It's no coincidence that so many expats are writers. There is the feeling that you're doing and experiencing so much more than your peers and that you have to translate all of your deep insights into ink. You start a blog filled with scatching social commentaries and instagram filtered photos of waterfalls and flowers. You'll always want to remember them. 

You're also now experiencing life as a D-list celebrity. You're the center of attention where ever you go. Want to buy a burger in McDonalds? The entire place is staring at you and listening to your accent to try to tell where you are from. Want to get into a very popular club? Go during the daytime and meet the owner, and he'll gladly let you and your foreign friends skip the lines. Want to get a driver's license without taking the test? Make a friend in the government who can pull some strings. Get pulled over by the cops? Plead ignorance as a tourist. 

You get the feeling that this is how life should be. How did you ever survive in a country with so much red tape, where you can't just bribe government officials? How did you ever live in such fear of going to prison if you made one small mistake? How terrible was it when you could barely get a date or find a woman that didn't want you for your money? And the people back home, they didn't respect you. It feels like your whole life you've been a baby bird with a broken wing and now you're finally soaring over the trees. 

After a few months, the medium-term traveler will start to think of himself as a more important person. After all, in the third world there's no concept of equality as we have in the US. People are not born equal. The rich are born to run companies and rule the country, and the poor are born to work menial jobs. There's little social mobility and little chance of that changing, but it begins to look more appealing when you suddenly are one the upper class. 

It seems to make up for all of the sacrifices you've had to make to live there. You can't buy any of the brands that you had at home, but you can go to a five star restaurant for a fraction of the cost. You rarely see your family, but you've got a 256kb connection that works at least some of the time. You can't walk through a large portion of the city at night, but you've got a bodyguard and a bulletproof car. You make it work.  

Virtually every person from an English speaking country living in Latin America develops this sense of superiority. They are far more pompous than they ever were at home. After all, most people have a sense of unrealized potential, and being treated in this way gives them a big sense of validation. They are the important people that they knew they were all along. Again, this is why I say that it's the D-list celebrity effect. They get a little fame, let it go to their head, and begin to lose touch with reality. Combine this with the isolation imposed by a language barrier and surrounding yourself with similar people, and it spirals out of control. 

At this point, many of these medium-travelers will decide to commit to the lifestyle long term and become expatriates. After all, like any other positive feeling, you can become addicted to it. It's also important to realize that at this stage the medium-term traveler has way more cognitive dissonance going on than the short-term traveler. To get back in touch with reality, the ideal of the foreign country being so awesome and their new sense of important need to break down. 

But after awhile, it will break down. The reality of life as an expat in Central America is far grimmer than I can adequately express in a few paragraphs, but I will briefly say that everything you once valued and thought was great quickly turns to shit. You'll realize that all of those new friends that you made have bad intentions. Most of them want to outright rob you, trick you into a bad investment, or manipulate you into giving their family members jobs.* That wonderful system of government corruption that you enjoyed so much in the beginning will taste a little less sweet when you're slapped with frivolous lawsuits and ordered to pay. Those police that will never send you to jail will get old when you realize that nobody will come if you call the cops, and if they do, they'll ask you for money to arrest the guy who broke into your house. That household full of servants that seemed like such a luxury? You'll begin wondering how much extra you should pay them to prevent them from selling a copy of your keys to the many thieves that would be happy to buy them. 

You become paranoid and mistrustful of everybody you meet. It's hard to distinguish between an empty threat and a real threat after you see so many horrific things happening around you. People can (and do) hire hitmen for $20. Kids walk by dead bodies on their way to school, happily jumping over them like nothing happened. Businesses owners are regularly kidnapped and held for ransom. These are the stories of the locals there, and after hearing enough of it, things like CIA conspiracies and elaborate plots to kill you start to sound a lot more like the reality in front of you than what you used to watch on TV. After all, you're this extremely important person, and everybody already seems to want to rob you. It's not so much of a stretch. 

Then suddenly you're casually telling the people back home how you upped your bodyguard count to 8 and you're bulletproofing all of your cars because you made a political enemy by not donating to his campaign after promising that you would, and you sound nuts. You were an accountant before moving there. Plus, they once spent a week in Nicaragua and it was nothing like that. 

It's the cold shock that most expats receive toward the end. What have they let their lives become? Is not paying taxes and living on the beach worth it? What was life like before the fear? Can't I get that initial feeling of wonderment back? They leave. It all becomes a distant memory and we learn not to talk about it because people who haven't lived it can't relate. 

End.

1309815903.0	igolg	On July 4th, a (qualified) defense of America and its culture.	Khiva	2516	1077	747	"This post contains a handful of defenses/explanations of certain aspects of American culture that I've often felt were either too complicated or too unpopular to post on reddit otherwise.  I couldn't really see the point in putting a great deal of effort into an explanation that nobody really wanted to hear, but maybe on July 4th people the fine people of this community will hear me out.

By way of introduction, when I grew up I could not be more humiliated to be an American.  Everywhere I looked I saw a grey, brittle, decaying culture which stood in such stark contrast to the glittering, vibrant world surrounding us that I couldn't wait to explore.  As soon as I was old enough I hit the road, and in years since I've served tea in rural Scotland, practiced zazen in Japanese monasteries, broken bread with landless tribes in India, watched the sunrise in Bagan, sang karaoke in Pyongyang.  I've lived in Istanbul, in Prague, in Rio, in Shanghai, studied at Cambridge and the Sorbonne.  I've got calluses on my feet and there's nothing I'm more proud of.

Furthermore, there's nothing I enjoy more than living in a foreign country and slowly trying to tease apart how its culture works.  And yet, strangely enough I slowly realized that even as I got my head around Turkish hospitality and Brazilian exuberance and Chinese reserve, I barely understood the culture I'd grown up in.  Even more strangely, there were things that I actually missed.

What follows is not intended to be complete, because I could certainly write a much longer post on what I _don't_ like about American society.  Those problems, however, are already cataloged at length on this site.   What's missing, for the sake of both balance and perspective, is what works and why.

American culture is organized primarily around three edicts.  The first is, roughly, ""Let me do it myself.""  This sets Americans apart from the many European countries I've experienced in which people are generally quite happy to let the government take care of things.  The French, for example, see the government as the rough embodiment of the collective French brain - _of course_ it would know best, as its the Frenchest thing around.

Americans, in stark contrast, are far more likely to see the government as the enemy, infringing upon their autonomy.  This leads to a great deal of misunderstanding, particularly from people who are used to seeing solutions flowing from a centralized authority.  Americans, rather, would prefer to leave matters such as charitable giving in the hands of the individual.  [In 1995 (the most recent year for which data are available), Americans gave, per capita, three and a half times as much to causes and charities as the French, seven times as much as the Germans, and 14 times as much as the Italians. Similarly, in 1998, Americans were 15 percent more likely to volunteer their time than the Dutch, 21 percent more likely than the Swiss, and 32 percent more likely than the Germans.](http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/a-nation-of-givers).  This alone, of course, does not mean that any one side of culture is more ""compassionate"" than the other - rather, that such compassion is filtered through different culture attitudes.

Another good example of that contrast occurred when Bill Gates and Warren Buffet received a remarkably chilly reception when they exhorted German ultra-wealthy to give more of their money away.  The reaction, with some justification, was primarily one of ""why should I give more money to do things that the state, funded by high tax rates, is expected to take care of?""  You can come down on this one of two ways - one is that it's more efficient to leave such things to an organized central body, another is that such a system distances and de-humanizes people in needy situations, and that more efficient solutions are arrived at through direct, hands-on involvement by a multitude of private citizens.  Again, my intent is not so much to pick one side as to explain the rather more poorly understood American approach.

Another example of how this comes up is in the much-maligned (on reddit) practice of tipping.  One certainly _could_ leave the final salary to a central decision-maker, in this case either the restaurant owner or a government minimum-wage board.  The American ""let me do it myself"" approach, however, desires to leave the ultimate decision in the hands of the customer.  It's certainly debatable about how efficient or humane this is, but the pro argument is that it leaves a bit of discretion in the hands of the end-user, and therefore a bit of incentive in the hands of the service provider.  One can rightly call it an inconvenience, but there's a logic to it that fits into a larger system.

This cultural instinct was set in sharp relief in the poorly-understood healthcare debate.  What many did not understand is that the most powerful argument in the whole debate was not ""Why should I care about the poor?"", it was ""Control will be taken away from you.""  Such abdication is of course no controversy to Europeans already accustomed to state control.  To Americans it runs contrary to a deeply set cultural instinct.

And inefficiently so.  Personally, I think that the ""let me do it myself"" approaches leads to great innovation and personal initiative, but health care is one area where everything simply gets slowed down.  But again, the problem is not so much a deficit of compassion as much as a unique cultural impetus.  Americans don't like having their autonomy taken away and that's what the proposed reforms (some felt) threatened to do.

Another powerful instinct in American culture is ""Be different!""  One of the more interesting things captured in the film _American Beauty_ is how one of the _worst_ things that you can be in America is average, or boring.  To Americans this seems perfectly natural, but contrast it with, say, China or Japan where being an average member of the group is considered perfectly acceptable, even laudable.  In America, you have failed if you are average - which is arguably quite cruel, considering that average is by definition what most people are.

The upshot is that everyone is trying their best to be different from everyone else.  On the one hand this is quite a tedious exercise as people often seek to avoid what they by definition must be, on the other it leads to an explosion of cultural diversity.  In fact, whenever I see a redditor going on about how _different_ they are bemoaning how much they hate being an American, I can't help but think that this is the most American thing they could be doing.  Everyone is reacting against what they view as typical - even the flag-waiving ultra-patriots considering themselves rebels against the sneering liberal majority.  

The last great impulse is ""Look at me!""  Americans often don't quite realize how _competitive_ their culture is, such that one must even fail spectacularly.  A great example of this is http://www.peopleofwalmart.com, a website dedicated to people determined not to let any lack of fashion sense get in the way of being noticed.  Another thing that Americans rarely realize is that other countries too have trailer-trash and exploitative TV shows.  I remember watching one reality show in France about a Gaullic redneck whose wife was furious with him for blowing their entire welfare check on a motorcycle.  His defense was that it was pink (and therefore could be construed as a gift).  You simply don't hear as much about the dregs of other countries' societies because Americans simply fail louder, harder, and more spectacularly than anybody else.  Whether this is an upside or a downside is yours to determine, but misunderstanding it leads to not shortage of confusion.

In sum, I'm not opposed to anti-Americanism per se, as there are a number of things I'm wont to complain about myself.  I am, however, opposed to _lazy_ anti-Americanism, the kind which only looks for the worst in one country and the best in others.  I was that person and I'm glad I'm not anymore.  I don't expect that any of this will change anyone's mind, but I do sincerely hope that it makes those perspectives, even the ones I disagree with, a bit more robust.

not being able to pay more than 100% of his take home salary in child support, but this became 
very long and I thought it may deserve it's own thread. I don't talk about this often but I think that I have had an unusual experiance, and due to that have a perspective that people may be interested in hearing about. 

Before I launch off into this I want to put up my gloves for a moment in a preemptive defensive maneuver and say that I have a great deal of respect for **anyone** who raises children on their own. Single mothers are sadly, almost routinely left to fend for themselves with a deadbeat ex husband or partner in the wind. I feel for them and I actually know how hard it is (to be a single parent). This post is about my personal experiance with the system that makes that hard job even harder for some people.

I've been a single father for close to 10 years. Three children, one is handicapped and will need special care for the rest of her life. 

The particular way that I obtained custody of my children was very sudden, and upsetting for the kids. I had been driving 80 miles each way to visit my children on  weekends for about 5 years. Often times I'd end up sitting in an empty driveway for many hours because nobody was home where my children should have been. Their mother liked to take the kids out to the beach when it was my visitation time. She knew that I'd sit and wait to see them. She'd also not pay her bills because she knew that even though I was paying child support that if I found out the phone, or lights, or anything my kids needed was off or missing I'd make the drive and take care of that as well. 

Sorry about the tangent, I could write volumes on this, but this post isn't about that.

What happened was that my children's mother came to my home unanounced one night, dropped off my  confused children with some trash bags full of dirty clothes on the driveway and took off. She didn't even honk to let me know she'd been there. Strong face, hey guys - it's just like camping, who wants the sofa? We're going to have fun, everything is going to be Ok.

I found out later she'd contacted every family members of mine, asked for money to pay for her rent because she said she was being evicted. She then abandoned the house she was renting and  took her ""emergency"" rent money cash so she could go on a 2 month long bender.

I had full custody of my children within 72 hours.  When I got custody of my children I asked 
for $100 a week in child support total, around $30 a week per child. Not a lot. I also asked 
that she pass a drug test prior to having overnight visits. I didn't care if she was smoking 
some pot, but the word was that her boyfriend was a coke dealer. There was going to be no more of that around my children now that I had a say. That's another whole story. 

(When we got divorced she'd moved out of state and I was still enlisted. I'd used up all of my leave and emergency leave to spend time with our daughter in the hospital. I could't travel a thousand miles to appear in court so she got everything she'd asked for in the divorce because I didn't appear to contest what she had asked for. Flat tires happen, I would get out of the service, move to where the kids were, and get to work making sure the kids were taken care of.)

I was more than a little overwhelmed. I'm now raising 3 young children, one who has special needs,
and I'm working at least 50 hours a week. I reached out to a number of programs for help, for advise, for encouragement, anything. I was not given an inch of help from a single one. They told me they only helped single mothers. I asked why this wasn't about the wellbeing of the *children* of all single *parents*. Thank you for calling sir. Have a good day.

I hate asking for help, especially from social programs. I'm the guy that gets shit done, I provide, I don't want a hand out, but... sometimes you suck it up and ask because someone else is relying on you to get the shit done that you just can't do all on your own. I found out that my ex hadn't brought my daughter with the medical issues back to her heart surgeon in 5 years for any kind of follow up. I finally *had the right to bring her to a doctor*, we had work to do, and it was going to be a long and expensive journey. 

When I went to Social Security to see if I could get the same finacial assistance that my ex wife had recieved, I was told that I didn't qualify for assistance. I held a respectable position, and made a middle class salary, so they would give me nothing. Many years later I was told by an Advocate that that was entirely false and that Social Security routinely misinforms people as to what they are entitled to because they expect you to appeal. I was an idiot and took them for their word. 

After 2 years of not getting any child support I started calling the Department of Revenue and 
the Probate Court asking why it wasn't being enforced, and what I could do to try and see that they 
were motivated to try to enforce it's collection. I had to go to court and explain to a judge why the court should do something to enforce a mother to pay the child support the same court ordered her to pay. It made my head hurt. When I had been the non custodial parent if my payments slipped for a couple of weeks when I was in between jobs  my bank account was promptly levied. This did not seem like equal treatment.

About this time *my* bank account was leveid for the first of many times by the DoR for back child support. What I was to find out over the next few years was that any time I would reach out and ask for help, they would listen, then assume later when reviewing the case that the father must be the one negligent, and then attach my pay or assets. I did go to court about it and even though I would ""win"", and a judge would order the DoR to leave my money alone it would happen again a year later. I eventually gave up going to court and fighting them for my money back, it just became too much. Spoiler - I've paid the Department of Revenue more ""child support"" money since I've had custody of my children than my ex wife has, who is actually supposed to be paying.

I started making regular visits to the court, 90 miles away from my home, $50 per tank of gas, 
to appear again and again before a judge just to say ""I think it would be responsible if my children's mother took steps towards trying to pay anything at all towards the welfare of her children"". The court would give my ex a stern suggestion to try and get  a job and pitch in to help provide for her children. She'd laugh as we walked out. A judge at one point asked her if she could even pay 50 cents that day towards the thousands she owed. Nope, can't. Ok, try and do it next week. That's not even hyperbole. Not even fifty cents and walked out with a laugh.

A few months back I had an idea for a personalized alternative to reddit (I will explain ""personalized"" soon).


[I asked TrueRedit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/jayrb/suggestions_for_an_alternative_to_reddit/) for your opinion and sensed that people would love to try an alternative if it was good enough.
So, my friend and I spent the last four months on creating a link-aggregation website that studies your vote pattern and provides you with a personalized news feed using a smart social ranking algorithm. We took your suggestions to heart, and implemented features such as channel (""subreddit"") hierarchies and tags, and many more are waiting to be added in.

After doing some QA on our own and showing it to our close friends to check for bugs &amp; usability, we decided it's time to release it as an *alpha version* and let TrueReddit voice their opinion.

So, I am proud to present you with **Wubel**: [www.wubel.com](http://www.wubel.com)

Wubel works very similiarly to reddit before you register as a user: you see the most popular items first.
The main difference begins *after you register* -- you will have a new feed called *Recommended*, that is generated automatically for each user by Wubel and it will show you what we think you will like the most. It takes a little bit of time until it updates (a matter of minutes), and the more you vote the more accurate your *Recommended* feed will get, so be patient at first.

I would really appreciate any insight, feedback or whatever I can get :) , this is why we are doing this alpha phase.

Thank you all,

   Hexbrid.


**Edit:** Wow, thank you so much for your comments and encouragements! I'm overwhelmed by the big response this post got. I'll answer all of your questions and ideas, but I'm having a hard time keeping up! :)

1342551893.0	wprzg	To the moderator: Is it too late to reverse Eternal September? 		1623	588	572	"The sentiment comes up often, though it's expressed in a variety of ways. Some users lash out with hurtful invectives, while others drop 1,000-word lectures... regardless, they're typically downvoted. So how do we broach this sensitive topic? Here's an anecdote from a UseNet member, posted way back in '93. 

&gt; ***September that never ended***: One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking any sense of netiquette, made a general nuisance of themselves. This coincided with people starting college, getting their first internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what was acceptable. These relatively small drafts of newbies could be assimilated within a few months. But in September 1993, AOL users became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers' capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the period before, this triggered an inexorable decline in the quality of discussions on newsgroups. Syn. eternal September. 

The term ""Eternal September"" perfectly describes the gradual decline of subs like /r/Truereddit. Newcomers, unaware of the rules, post 'AOL!'-style comments and threads. Slowly, the tenor of the community changes, veterans of the board abandon ship and from there, the downward spiral continues. What's left is the same pithy, puerile nonsense that we all hoped to avoid in the first place. 

It happens to every permeable community. From SomethingAwful to Hacker News to the early Internet boards. The one guaranteed solution is vigilant moderation. 

Problem is: Kleopatra6tilde9, the resident moderator, refuses to pro-actively moderate the subreddit's content. S/he has a laissez-faire attitude about the group dynamics, believing that users will educate one another and vote accordingly. Here are some of his/her thoughts on the idea from prior comments: 

&gt; To me, community moderation is the only way to keep a subreddit about great articles on topic. Moderators cannot read everything. Otherwise, this subreddit becomes A&amp;L Daily.

I'm sorry, Kleopatra, but we don't (yet) live in H.G. Wells' future society. A community without enforced rules will eventually decay, no matter how much faith you place in the hands of individual users. Indeed, that's the crux of Eternal September--the small bands of newbies can originally be handled, but soon they overwhelm the mainstays. 

Yes, there are /r/TrueReddit users who are aware of and abide by the rules. Unfortunately, they're vastly outnumbered by newcomers. We've long passed the threshold where you can rely on users to curate content--at this point, some serious landscaping is needed. 

&gt; [Kleopatra6tilde9 cont'd] If people subscribe for something else, then that is their problem. TR is great today because people submitted content to get the original reddit back, not the other way round. Take a look at /r/modded. With 4k members, TR was far more active.

It's interesting that your rubric of success is activity, rather than the ""really great, insightful articles"" espoused by the sidebar. And what's your contingency for when the quality links are sacrificed by increased activity? Oh yeah, shoo everyone into esoteric subreddits and other websites. Great. 

Frankly, and with all due respect, you're a moderator. So please, moderate. I appreciate that you created this subreddit and that you're well within your rights to tell dissenters to find somewhere else to gather. But I hope that you rise to the spirit of democracy and hear the pleas of long-time subscribers. 

Besides the meager sidebar guidelines, there's nothing to stem the tide of one-line comments, editorialized articles and pun threads. What're my solutions? 

1. Take a more hands-on approach to moderating 

2. Share moderation duties (there are 130,000 subscribers. We need more than one mod to arbitrate all their output) 

3. Beef up the sidebar! 

As far as prospective mods go, I'm throwing my hat into the ring. Feel free to do the same, however, I can't promise anything--the ball's in Kleopatra's court. 

EDIT: As pointed out by HiddenText, [here](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#WhydoesredditneedmoderationCantyoujustletthevotersdecide) the admins of Reddit explain why a community can never moderate itself. 

&gt; The problem is that casual, new, or transient visitors to a particular community don't always know the rules that tie it together.

(If you can't follow the reddiquette all the time, please remove r/TR from your frontpage and visit it separately.)	kleopatra6tilde9	1159	503	145	"Judging by the upvotes, most should have read [The Rise of the New Groupthink ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/oi4ab/the_rise_of_the_new_groupthink/).

One core message is

&gt;“If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.” 

&gt;The **reasons brainstorming fails** are *instructive for other forms of group work*, too. People in groups tend to **sit back and let others do the work**; they instinctively mimic others’ opinions and lose sight of their own; and, often **succumb to peer pressure**. The Emory University neuroscientist Gregory Berns found that when we take a stance different from the group’s, we activate the amygdala, a small organ in the brain associated with the fear of rejection. Professor Berns calls this **“the pain of independence.”** 

So far, r/TR has surpassed all expectations but as always, there is constant decline and r/TR has been better a year or two ago. Actually, I think it is better in many ways, but we have to stick to the core values of the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) to keep it the [#1 community moderated subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/og1l1/moderator_statistics_round_2_this_time_down_to/).

It's all about turning [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) into Eternal December. New members need explanations, not downvote punishment. It's not like you can [treat them like ponies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fzTWJvpiccU#t=213s). If not punching ponies / not downvoting new members makes you sick, r/TR may not be the best subreddit for you. In that case, please unsubscribe and visit r/TR on a good day.

Everybody else, please remember:

---

**Please don't downvote articles just because you don't like them. A downvote is a distributed ban. (This is the original meaning which is kept in r/TR and essential for its spirit.) If you have to downvote, something went wrong and it's worth an explanation.**

(*edit: If there is already a good comment, just upvote that comment. In any case, make sure that there is a good explanation when you downvote a submission or a comment.)

This submission [And at one point, the man uttered what has to be the most searingly romantic sentence ever uttered in history, by anyone, in any language...](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/oiv27/and_at_one_point_the_man_uttered_what_has_to_be/) has one comment: ""Great article! Uncle Junior used [...]"" and 6 upvotes but is downvoted off the hotpage without any explanation. I think it is the kind of article for which r/TR has been made. If you don't like these articles, just don't upvote them in the same way that you don't buy music that you don't like (you don't burn it, do you?). That's still enough to push great articles to the top.

After a reminder, [Voluntary exposure to pornography and men's attitudes toward feminism and rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/ogqfi/voluntary_exposure_to_pornography_and_mens/) has become an example of how we can educate each other. There are 10,000 active members per day. Each one of you just has to explain one downvote once a year like *onlyzul* and *MrDuck* to maintain r/TR's quality. If you don't, we will be outnumbered soon and r/TR will become similar to /r/politics.

---

**Please don't join the hivemind and upvote enraging news**

(\*edit: **Actually, enraging news and other content that doesn't belong into this subreddit should be downvoted. Just make sure that there is an explanation so that the downvote is more than a punch in the face.**)

/r/PanicHistory is a joke but r/TR also falls for rage:


* [College presidents suggest differentiated tuition for different degrees](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/ogora/college_presidents_suggest_differentiated_tuition/)

* [Violence against women in India has jumped 44% between 1993 and 2011, new study finds. Kidnappings rose by 13% and rapes per capita increased by 23% over the same period. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/nyada/violence_against_women_in_india_has_jumped_44/).



This is another joke, but articles that are just fillers for an enraging headline don't belong into this subreddit:

* [""We won't lie - we're only highlighting this story to bring this wonderful picture to a wider audience."" - Football365](http://football365.com/news/21554/7330166/-Pressure-On-City-)

If you fall for this, please read this article:

* [The SportsCenter-ization of Political Journalism - Coverage that focuses purely on emotional conflicts and who's winning impoverishes our democracy and obscures the real, important issues at play.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/o46eg/the_sportscenterization_of_political_journalism/)


It's always a good idea to check the comments before upvoting.

r/TR is a place for respectful debates and it is tempting to share news with this community. Please resist and submit them to other subreddits and don't upvote them. Downvote them because news destroy this subreddit.
News are like pics, they are easier to consume than great articles. Upvoting them removes great articles from the top. We have seen the decline in r/reddit.com, no need to repeat it here.

/r/RepublicOfNews is a perfect place for news. I urge you all to subscribe now so that it is big enough. Unlike great articles, news need some form of dedicated moderation.
For political debates, there are already great subreddits: /r/moderatepolitics and /r/PoliticalDiscussion.

---

**Short hints**

* Read the comments (and the article!) before writing your own comment. No need to burden your fellow redditors with duplicates

* Please don't write the obvious one-liners. We already had the same thought, no need to read it again.


* Please check the sidebar to discover interesting subreddits

* Visit /r/TrueReddit on its own. Often, the top article on your frontpage is not the best submission of the day.

* If you need more indepth subreddits, check the sidebar of /r/MetaTrueReddit.

* /r/misc is becoming the new r/reddit.com, but without the spam. 

* [The last reminder from 3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/kkhar/a_reminder_about_eternal_september/)

* Please think twice if you submit a political article to keep r/TR balanced. They are like sugar - wonderful but it's too easy to get too much.

* [The Best Magazine Articles Ever ](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/the-best-magazi.php) - if you wonder what really great articles are.

* If you haven't noticed: I am the only mod and I try to only remove spam. Please keep the number of these reminders low by writing constructive criticism in comments yourself.

* Seriously, don't downvote just because you don't like an article or comment.

Racial discrimination has probably always been with us, but the one thing we *do* know is that race (and the resulting discrimination) is a social construction. The caste system in India, for example, didn't emerge as a product of human nature. The castes aren't entirely rigid either. Hierarchies and other social structures have causes and uses. Any racial segregation or caste system emerged because of social, political, or economic reasons. 

It's almost intuitive to think that the way we see race is the way it's always been seen. Historically multi-racial and multicultural societies have existed peacefully before. ~~I can think of at least two Roman emperors - [Septimius Severus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus)~~ It turns out that [Septimius Severus was pretty much black](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/statue_septimius_severus.aspx) (he had dark skin, yet was of Phoenician descent) and [Caracalla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla), his son, was biracial. Racial boundaries that we have today seemed much more fluid among the ancients. It isn't clear that there *needs* to be a racial power structure at all.

However racial discrimination in America has a more specific origin. We can point to a few defining characteristics of to racial discrimination's American incarnation. First of all, it was for a long time [justified ""scientifically""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Racial_theories_in_physical_anthropology.2C_1850-1918), secondly it was tied to an economic system (slavery, immigrant labor), and thirdly racially discriminatory policies were directed primarily at non-whites.

&gt;Did you know? At one time, [anyone who wasn't of Anglo-Saxon descent wasn't considered ""white""](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Toward-Whiteness-Americas-Immigrants/dp/0465070744)? Whiteness was ""earned"" over time by European immigrants in America. Even [within Europe, racial classifications existed](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Ripley_map_of_cephalic_index_in_Europe.png). 

&gt;**Edit: For more on this, you can read about [how the Irish became white](http://academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/white13.htm).**

**Did white people invent racism?**

Strictly speaking, no. The term ""white people"" has changed meanings over the last few hundred years and today it pretty much includes all Europeans. 

However, it was Europeans who pretty much ""invented"" the ""kind"" of racial discrimination we live with today in America, and in much of the world. 

What ""kind"" of racial discrimination is this? [Scientific racism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-eX5T68TQIo).

Scientific racism became really popular after Robert Knox's [*Races of Men*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-eX5T68TQIo#t=1610s). Others independently developed similar related ideas. In America, [Samuel G. Morton began measuring skulls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-eX5T68TQIo#t=1670s) and ended up with the conclusion that the different races were in fact separate species - that anything non-white (non-Saxon) was not really human at all. 

Others like the American doctor Samuel Cartwright developed a race-based psychology. Cartwright would create the infamous diagnosis of [drapetomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania) (a treatable mental illness that compelled slaves to run away). 

Scientific racism found its original footing with [Carolus Linnaeus' original taxonomy of humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Carl_Linnaeus). (Linnaeus was the guy who gave us Latin names for all animals). In addition to coming up with the taxonomy we apply for all living things, Linnaeus categorized each race by skin color and characteristics. 

From these descriptions try and guess which race, in Linnaeus' view, was the best of them all.

&gt;[T]he Americanus (Native Americans) were red-skinned, of stubborn character, and angered easily; 

&gt;the Africanus were black-skinned, relaxed, and of negligent character; 

&gt;the Asiaticus  race were yellow-skinned, avaricious, and easily distracted; whereas, unlike the character-imbalanced colored people, 

&gt;the Europeanus were white-skinned, of gentle character, inventive mind, and bellicose.

For the most part, Linnaeus' taxonomy stuck well into the modern era. We use some form of it today actually in how we categorize race in the lay sense. You'll still find people who divide humans into these four categories (Linnaeus had a fifth but it isn't relevant) as if it was the most natural/scientifically accurate thing in the world. Now you know where these categories came from in the first place, if you didn't already.  

So while racial discrimination existed long before now, *this* ""scientific"" kind of racial classification only appeared in the last 200-300 years and it originated in the European Enlightenment tradition. And *these* scientific-racism racial classifications (along with missionary fervor) are what crossed the seas to Africa, Asia, and America and formed the core of racial discrimination in America. Probably even around the world. 

&gt;&gt;Interesting fact - scientific racism was also exported during the colonial era. Colonized non-white groups would compete to be ""closer"" to whites than [their local other rival group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Rwanda#Belgian_colonialism).

&gt;&gt;&gt;[T]he colonial government became concerned with the differences between Hutu and Tutsi [and sought to exploit ethnic divisions for the government's benefit]. Scientists arrived to measure skull—and thus, they believed, brain—size. Tutsi's skulls were bigger, they were taller, and their skin was lighter. As a result of this, Europeans came to believe that Tutsis had Caucasian ancestry, and were thus ""superior"" to Hutus. 

And we all remember what happened in Rwanda in 1994. 

But let's just talk focus on America for now. 

**Why does scientific racism even matter?**

Scientific racism shows us that the racial discrimination we have today wasn't an inevitable consequence of interracial relations or just a natural product of human nature. Racial classifications and discrimination were actually constructed. Someone, namely Linnaeus, came up with these concepts purposefully, albeit Linnaeus' purpose was ostensibly purely scientific and descriptive rather than prescriptive. Other theorists then used these concepts to justify their world views - namely Empire, or European/white supremacy. 

This doesn't mean there was a massive conspiracy to keep minorities down. As Europe (specifically Britain) became the dominant power of the world, some believed this meant that the white man was truly the pinnacle and the hope of mankind. And it was the white man's duty to spread enlightenment to the poor, colored, but often noble savages.

Rudyard Kipling (the guy who wrote *The Jungle Book) summed it up thus:

&gt;""Take up the White Man's burden—

&gt;Send forth the best ye breed—

&gt;Go bind your sons to exile

&gt;To serve your captives' need;

&gt;To wait in heavy harness,

&gt;On fluttered folk and wild—

&gt;Your new-caught, sullen peoples,

&gt;Half-devil and half-child.""

Scientific racism also gives a legitimate-sounding justification for the hierarchy of races with whites at the top. Put another way, the domination of the white race in America even after slavery ended would be the ""natural order"" according to ""science.""  

Therefore it's no surprise that ""natural order"" began to ""assert itself"" in the law even while genetics and biology were blowing holes in the scientific racism paradigm. It didn't stop at Jim Crow or immigrant quota laws, anti-miscegenation statutes popped up across the states. Implicit behind these statutes was the idea that if you weren't white, you weren't entirely human. [There were court cases in which the courts annulled marriages because one spouse was one part (insert minority/immigrant group here)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia#Key_precedents). In one case, the court 

&gt; Defined Mrs. Monks' race by relying on the anatomical ""expertise"" of a surgeon. *The judge ignored the arguments of an anthropologist and a biologist that it was impossible to tell a person's race from physical characteristics*.

Why does [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/l01i4/its_1940_the_nazis_have_taken_copenhagen_they_are/c2opl7d) have 12 upvotes:
&gt;This is just as, if not more awesome.

while [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/l01i4/its_1940_the_nazis_have_taken_copenhagen_they_are/c2ood4t) sits at -5:
&gt;They could have probably gotten away with it by turning them invisible with corn syrup and a pyrex enclosure. Interesting nonetheless.

The first one adds nothing to the conversation, and could have been replaced easily with an upvote, while the second one (I'm no chemist, but apparently it wouldn't work), starts a discussion that is mature and intelligent.

Furthermore, comments like these receive upvotes:

1318338165.0	l88c9	In the aftermath of /r/jailbait being shut down for getting the site bad press, does anyone else feel like this entire dynamic is based on a fundamental confusion about the nature of the internet?	cacophonousdrunkard	1213	675	560	"Clearly the reason it was shut down was to avoid the stigma that people associated with this site hold some kind of negative, discrediting, or morally corrupt element and Reddit wants to preserve it's integrity in the mainstream.  It seems to me that at the root of this idea is some critical misunderstanding about what the internet is and what it really DOES for people and for the world.

I think it's still hard for people to truly keep in mind that we (the internet) are the entire post-information-era population of earth and that we (the internet) are exactly as diverse as the post-information-era population of earth.

The obvious difference between traditional media and the internet is that here we all have a semi-permanent public voice, and it's MUCH easier for us to find eachother. Instead of waiting for a subject to come up in conversation in our bars and dinner parties to find likeminded people, we now have an indexed, easily searchable database for all of the moments and feelings we face as human beings--you can find blistering rage for no good reason, tender and heartwrenching matters of love and family, you can find someone's darkest darkness or most socially unacceptable sexual taboo, and sometimes you just find fucking puppies.

If nothing else, the existence of /r/jailbait should simply be a mirror held up to those something-thousand members of the post-information-era population of earth that like to look at pictures of teen girls. There they are, doing that. Take it for what you will, but understand that that's truth staring you back in the face. On some level that's a reflection of a streak that a lot of current-day humans are capable of having and here is where they go to have it.

We can choose to make any moral judgment or not from there, but I think that it is very important in this new medium not to begin to define degrees of free speech or limit the ways we're allowed to see what we are as a whole.  There are assholes and perverts and rapists and killers and hippies and grandmothers and cocaine abusers and buddhists and drunks and homeless people in the world, so there are assholes and perverts and rapists and killers and hippies and grandmothers and cocaine abusers and buddhists and drunks and homeless people on the internet.  The only difference is that now we SEE THEM.

The point is that we (the internet) need to realize that WE ARE HUMANITY, and humanity is us. They are not separate things.  A site like reddit is not some niche community centered around baseball or motorcycle modification or teen sluts, it's just a certain percentage of humanity being themselves.


disclaimer- it's early, and i'm sorry if this is incoherent

EDIT- there seems to be a portion of redditors here that are reading this as either a slippery slope argument or an outright defense of jailbait or moral ambiguity....  im not sure where youre getting that but my intent was to avoid that debate altogether.  i am more interested in the implications of an online community as large and diverse as our offline communities and the way we seem to regard them differently even though its the same people.

one other thing is that i was unaware of the actual cp changing hands and thus the legal implications to the owners of reddit"	t5_2qyt6	True

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**I have always been annoyed by everything that has to do with Muslims.**

**Tonight** the streets are filled with love. I hope i can keep this feeling. I hope politicians can keep this feeling. And i hope the Muslim part of our population can keep this feeling.

**I have been annoyed** of Muslim cab drivers with long beards. I have been annoyed of Muslims that have probably been on their way to or coming from prayers. In any case, i have seen their outfit and thought to myself that they are going to a mosque, which i also think maybe shouldn't have been built at all. I have been a little more annoyed of over-covered women. I have been annoyed of Muslim terrorists. I have been annoyed of Muslim inmates that want halal meat. Had the Koran been that important for them, then they wouldn't have been in prison in the first place? I have been annoyed of the 50% of people in securities in European airports being of the same faith as the one they are supposed to protect us from when we stand there getting ready to be searched. I have been annoyed of Somalians that don't work. I have been annoyed of most that has to do with Muslims, including their lack of tolerance.

**When the bomb exploded** and i heard the news on my way home from work, Friday 22 July, i thought to myself; ""Now the fucking politicians have to wake up and finally do something."" I think i even thought; ""Now they HAVE to get them out!!""

Then it was I who would have the big awakening. The shock alone, that this was NOT done by Muslim would have been enough to wake most people back into reality.

Deep down I knew that if the attack had been carried out by a Muslim, I would blame the entire Muslim world.  Every person with a dark mustache and beard would have ended up in the category of ""GUILTY"".  I think I had been so full of hatred that I would become physically ill.

**When the image of** Breivik surprisingly appeared early on the TV-screen, one of the first ""new"" thoughts of mine were; that now i only saw ONE, SINGLE SICK INDIVIDUAL. I did not blame an entire religious group even if he characterized himself as a ""Christian"" and a ""Conservative"", something the media made out to be ""Conservative Christian"" - to make him appear more specifically dangerous.

Then it hit me that if the deeds were done by Muslims, then we probably wouldn't have followed any Imams eventual request of finding a ""quiet Mosque"" for reflection, like we did when ""The Norwegian Church"" invited for a open church. It was after all a ""Conservative Christian"" that had done the deed.

**Another new thought:** It is probably not likely that all Muslims look at those who do ""Muslim terrorism"" as good Muslims, just as likely as the Norwegian Christians see Breivik as a typical good Christian.

With my newfound self-knowledge it struck me that it was still good that there was a genuine Norwegian who was behind it!

In the following days, I have gotten my everyday racist attitudes put to a serious test.  A test that many of these attitudes simply do not pass.

**However, Im probably not the only one** who has had my attitude put to the test, again at the risk of being biased, I believe that the imam who went hand in hand with Kvarme (Christian Bishop) has had his attitudes put to the test.  I also assume that it was a new experience for the imam who walked next to the female vicar in Nesodden when Bano(one of the Victims who was a Muslim) was buried.  I also believe these, including Kvarme have experienced a sense of community that is new to them, a feeling that warms and gives hope!  It has also been impressive to see young Muslims who expressed pride in being a part of the ""community feeling"" we now are experiencing.

**How would ""The Norwegian We"" have turned out** if this event actually was done by someone who claimed that they were Muslims?

We would probably not have been particularly concerned about the terrorist's rights.  Especially not if Brynjar Meling (publicly known as a defender of a Muslim Extremist in Norway) had taken on the role of defender, which he certainly did.  We would probably not been a whole nation, which also includes the Muslim population.  I do not think we would have stood up for the innocent Muslim men, if they were subjected to verbal, physical and mental abuse.  I would not bet the entire month wages on that the Crown Prince, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and a bishop would have visited a mosque to announce that today we are all together in grief.

**After the last weeks events**, I have become more aware of segregation in the society we are a part of.  My contribution to the split has been that I have been in agreement with most simplified statements. Initiatives that have put all Muslims in a big box, a box that both have the label ""Terrorist"" and ""Parasites.""  A Box that has also been labeled ""Forced Marriage"", ""Genital Mutilation"" and much more. 

Integration and integration-politics are two words you almost do not dare use today.  The words are associated with a debate that certainly has seemed more exclusive than inclusive, especially in the group we would like to have integrated. 

**But it is precisely now** that we should talk about integration.  Both we who will accept people from outside, and those who want to enter and participate in our society.  To achieve integration, we need to want to include.  We need to include *each other*.  With our flaws and idiosyncrasies. 

In this connection, I think the Anti-Racist organization ""Teatime"" is an excellent measure.  Inclusion is very often to just get to know each other.  Now, everybody is open, and standing side by side against a common cause. 

**If the church and mosques stand together** and manage to show that it actually meant something to go hand in hand over Grønland (A huge march in the ""immigrant community area"" of Oslo for the people who lost their life.), and all of us manage to keep over us our new national feeling: ""The Norwegian We"", then we can experience a new era in the question of integration.

kleopatra6tilde9 is the only mod in this subreddit at the moment. Truly she/he has done a great job thus far. My suggestion is mostly a preventative measure.

(I'm not saying it should be me, mind you.)

**EDIT**: To be clear, everything seems pretty good here right now. But this subreddit will only get more subscribers and attention, and it's good to prepare. As far as I know, it's not common for a subreddit this big to have only one mod.

If we encourage more contributions to this subreddit, which I believe we should, we will require other mods to mind the place for times that kleopatra is not around.
