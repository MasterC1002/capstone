1353697713.0	13of74	Question for Tard's owner: How did Tard come about?	Ruruskadoo	162	43	45	"I know people love Tard, so this will be tossed to downvote hell, but I'd like to hear a straight answer from the people who actually bred this cat if it's possible. 

It's stated on your site that you bred Tard yourself, and you're no cat breeder, just the owner of unspayed/neutered moggies (cat mutts). An article online saying they'd interviewed you guys said that you usually give your kittens away through advertisements in the paper.
Here comes the unpopular part: Why? Why are you breeding your cats? Is this just a one time fluke and you've ""fixed"" them now, or is this something you do regularly? Are you still breeding Tard's mom even though you know she has a history of producing kittens with neurological issues? Was it just your indoor only unspayed female escaping while in heat, or do you let your unaltered animals roam free?

I'm not afraid of the downvoting or ""OMG U H8 TARD CAT"" comments, and I'm willing to accept the consequences of that, but I would very much like to hear the answer to these questions firsthand."	t5_2v4nn	True

1348684021.0	10ioz4	I've made a list: Top 10 things to love about Tardcat	Goomb	103	12	5	"10. Tardcat's critical, frowning face reminds us to always be critical and accept only the best for ourselves.

9. Tardcat teaches us that even the weirdest-looking among us can achieve internet fame â€” as long as we're a cat.

8. Just look at him! I mean, come on!

7. Tardcat has never made a promise during an electoral campaign that he didn't keep. 

6. Tardcat was in no way responsible for the Japan tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster.

5. Seriously though, look at the little guy!

4. If you add up the numbers that correspond to placement in the alphabet for each of the letters in the word ""Tard,"" you get 43, which is the 14th smallest prime number, and Beethoven's 14th piano sonata (most commonly known as the Moonlight Sonata), kicks ass.

3. The following statement not been disproven: Tardcat's meow has potent anti-diarrheal qualities.

2. ""Tardcat"" rhymes with ""hardhat,"" and the thought of Tardcat in a hardhat is absolutely delightful.

**Report:**

* Posts that have absolutely nothing to do with Tard
* Gore or full frontal nudity
* Comments and posts that are offensive (don't go full SRS, though)
* Posts containing minor nudity and NSFW language should only be reported AFTER the OP has been asked to tag the post. If the post isn't tagged when it's 6 hours old, it can then be reported.

**DO NOT report:**

* Posts or comments you don't like or don't agree with
* Posts of grumpy cats other than Tard, post /r/grumpycats in the comments and leave it at that
* Comments with NSFW language

The ironic thing is that from what I see on video, this ""grumpy"" cat is not at all unhappy or grumpy. She seems very content and easygoing. She's just kind of funny looking, really! If she was in pain she wouldn't let her owner take her all the places she does or let her owner pose her for photos. She seems to be well adjusted (can get along with DOGS!) and sweet. She just looks goofy! For the love of Pete, this cat is not abused or handicapped. She's got an underbite that makes her look like she's scowling and her legs are a bit stubby, which makes her waddle. Her disposition and temperament suggest that aside from some quirks, she's a normal cat."	t5_2v4nn	True

So I don't know how many of you know about Brother Jed, but he's a pretty infamous crazy campus preacher.

I'm looking for a good grumpy cat picture to use, but Google Image search isn't showing me anything greater resolution than about 400x400, even with changing setting.

I recently found a independent t-shirt design company based out of my college that makes awesome t-shirts for a reasonable price. I would really love to support the business - it's helping the owners pay for school. They agreed to make a t-shirt with a design of Tard on it if I could find a suitable image of her that I liked. 

So here I am, seeing what the depths of Reddit can bring up. I'm open to original interpretations or just anything awesome in general. And I promise, I will post the finished product if everything turns out well! :)

The most persistent is ""Do the Grumpy Grump"", based on ""The Humpty Dance"" by Digital Underground. (The runner up has been to the tune of that old ""Lollypop, Lollypop"" song from the 60s. Every time that one gets stuck in my head it is very hard to get rid of it...)

Anyway, I was looking for a good still image from the Humpty Dance video, to photoshop, but I can't find anything above a 320x240 resolution, and even the versions of the video online all seem to be pretty low-res. If someone can find a decent resolution image similar to this one: 

http://content.internetvideoarchive.com/content/photos/205/008614_11.jpg

It would be great to see that photoshopped with her face in place of his. If you can find a pic but don't have photoshop skills, let me know and I can do it.

I'm actually a little worried about her. I mean, it's amazing that she's getting all these deals (eg. the commercial, the spot on TMZ), but all the moving around, the fact she's being passed around to strangers all the time, it's actually really bad for a cat, and causes stress and diminished lifespan. 

I think things like ""The Daily Grump"" and the tshirts are great ideas, but is it really necessary to send Tarder Sauce all over the country? I'm just worried she's actually being harmed by all this, like any animal would be. 

**tldr**: I'm worried that Tard's life is being negatively affected by all the moving around and media attention she's getting. "	t5_2v4nn	True
