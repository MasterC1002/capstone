That game yesterday was essentially Vick's first preseason game.  Not making excuses here - just being honest.  The man saw 12 TOTAL snaps in the preseason.  He's going to be rusty.

Teams would kill to have Mike Vick under center.  He forces defenses to do so much more than most other QBs in this league.  We're spoiled to death with this team, and people want NICK FUCKING FOLES to start against the BALTIMORE RAVENS DEFENSE?!?!    

Give Vick a chance you idiots - this is his final audition to get this team deep into the playoffs.

I have been old enough to actually follow the Eagles since the mid 80's and pretty much every year since then, I have rooted for a dumb team. Not always dumb in the same way, but always dumb in *some* way. 

Last year we drafted like a smart team drafts and the result was 5-6 guys who helped the team in year 1. I am cynical like all the rest of you and assumed that draft was a fluke. This years draft was also really smart. I am now a believer. Out of nowhere I am genuinely optimistic that these players are going to help this team. 

Never again will we see crap like...

drafting players 7 years older than their peers(who are all better anyways)

""I am a WR when not training for olympic skiing""

""Empty backfield shotgun sets with 4 injured OLinemen

""Star player that did not play Junior or Senior seasons with injuries.""

Trading up to reach way down for a player, etc.

I am really looking forward to the next few years. It is going to be a fun ride.

1376615536.0	1kgil8	In all honesty, the QB competition is pretty much over	tiggs	65	2	73	"Taking nothing away from Nick Foles, but Michael Vick has looked tremendous in both games.  On paper, Vick has the obvious advantage, but this new offense is literally the perfect system for him to be running.  He's showing a confidence in the pocket that we haven't seen from him EVER, smart decisions, pinpoint throws, and using his legs to run in correct situations.  

If you take away that last hail mary at the end of the half that got picked off (which there's no way he would have thrown if it wasn't the end of the half), he would have only had a single incompletion in both games combined and a perfect QB rating.  Even his single incompletion in the last game was a smart decision, because he put the ball low and hard on 3rd down where either his WR would have made the play or it would have fallen incomplete.  He's moving the offense in a great, great way and with proper pass protection and excellent play-calling, he's looking better than ever.  A HUGE part of this also has to do with how organized things are on the sideline.  There's no last minute shuffling things around, burning timeouts unnecessarily, or forcing plays that the opposing defense has figured out.  The players enjoy playing for Chip Kelly and believe in this offense, which is absolutely invaluable.  

I don't want to get too far ahead of things and it's still early, but this marriage between Michael Vick and Chip Kelly is starting off on fire.  The entire offense just looks in sync and for a guy like Michael Vick that excels in a quicker paced offense, we could be in for a VERY special season from him.  This type of situation also favors McCoy and Jackson as well.  With an emphasis on a quick tempo, multiple options on every single play, and getting the ball in the hands of play-makers quickly, this could be the most dynamic Eagles offense we've seen in a long, long time.  

Again, I still like Nick Foles very much and he's going to make either a great backup QB for us or possibly a starter for someone else after this season, but Michael Vick has worked very hard this offseason, come into camp more focused than ever, and the results are really showing.

The coolest thing happened tonight. I was hanging around on twitter (if you follow me, you know I spend a lot of time doing that. Soliciting rides from the airport and whatnot), when I saw Brian Rolle send out a tweet saying something to the effect of ""I just got stood up, who wants to go see a movie"". so I of course wrote back ""I will"". To my surprise, he was serious, and I was the only one to get back to him. So we made plans to go check out Mission: Impossible at the UA theater in south philly (go see it by the way, it's good). 

He was an incredibly cool guy, we bullshitted about the team a bit, he acted really offended when I told him I was a penn state student. Just a real nice dude. I watched him give a girl his number, the guys got SWAG!

He improved every year and was the absolute heart and soul of the team, not just the defense. He's a community oriented guy, and was never in trouble during his time in school. He's extremely coachable, learns fast, and leads by example. 

His numbers would have been out of this world at a larger school, and I say that with complete confidence. There were times when Marshall played against upper echelon teams - like WVU and Virginia Tech - where he was being triple teamed off the line because he was the only person they were concerned about, and he still forced early throws and was able to knock down the quarterback. He doesn't quit on plays, and will get to the ball in the backfield.

I'm disappointed that Atlanta didn't take him, but I'm excited that he'll get a chance to play near his family in New Jersey. You guys got a good one. Hope to see him on the field soon."	t5_2qi5w	True

These last games are showing us who will play to the end of eternity. The guys that don't and won't quit no matter what.  

We're also getting a chance to see the young guys play REAL teams. This is a chance to really analyze them and try to see who has what.  

If you're rooting for your team to lose you need your fan card revoked.  There's no way you can tell me that the difference between picking 5th and 10th is going to make or break this team next year or for the next 3 anyway.

I have never seen such sore losers in my entire life.  I don't understand how they can't possibly accept that we out played them.  It was not the refs who let Celek open the entire game.  It wasn't the refs who left Maclin wide open in the endzone and it wasn't the refs who decided not to run when there was a minute left and had two time outs. GET OVER it. I mean its also not like the Eagles turned the ball over 4 times and their offense didn't capitalize either.  All this week I still hear on the radio claiming the Refs were for the Eagles and there was no other way we would win.  I know I'm preaching to the choir here but my God I just can't stand it anymore.  Thanks for letting me vent guys. /rant	t5_2qi5w	True

Mike Vick’s thighs are a thing of wonder

Charged with power of an angelic kind

They tore our defense into sunder

With legs so fast they’ll leave you blind



A galloping steed cannot equate

He leaves the grass to burn and singe

His on field skills fill us with hate

His breaking tackles makes us cringe

So onward Vick with your sexy thighs

Your running form deserves a crown

While Giants fans were filled with sighs

You torched the field for another down


Chocolatey smooth and flawless thee

Your sexy thighs are a sight to see"	t5_2qi5w	True

I watched a few games last season and the last couple of superbowls and found them to be very exciting. After watching silver linings playbook I decided the eagles were the team to support. I bought a DeSean Jackson jersey (which i'm currently wearing) and I'm now eagerly awaiting the first pre-season game. So i'm wondering what are some of the important bits of the eagles history that I should know? Like nicknames, rivals, great victories etc. And maybe anything else I should know about them or just football is general. I know the basic rules but things like safeties and the defence is still rather confusing.

1320599573.0	m2hzf	ESPN INSIDER: A Philadelphia Eagles uprising (whole lot of sensationalism, but it'll get you pumped as hell)	swatkins44	39	5	7	"Poor Rob Ryan.

That's not sarcasm. Here you had the Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, one of the really good ones in this league, publicly apologizing for what happened to the Cowboys' defense on ""Monday Night Football."" It was as if he'd given the defense a week off, skipped the film sessions and just told 'em to make sure there were 11 guys on the field. There's just one issue: it really wasn't the case.

I've watched every play; Dallas had a complex game plan for the Philadelphia Eagles and Michael Vick, one that has worked for other teams. They Cowboys brought blitzes that have given the Eagles problems -- casino, safeties off edges and linebackers in the middle. They moved their game wrecker, DeMarcus Ware, all over the place to create matchups and they mixed up their coverages. This wasn't some remedial defense that Vick and the Eagles mechanically picked apart as if it were playing a couple of men down.

But that isn't even the scary part. No, what should truly scare opponents of the Eagles from this point on is what Vick said after the game. He told us that nothing Dallas did surprised him. All the looks, all the countering, all the adjustments -- he could see it coming. Remember, this is the same guy that once griped about ""the grind"" of training camp, about how he just wanted to play. How once he got out there, things would be fine.

Maybe he didn't know better then. But the reality is, he does now -- if he truly comes this prepared, and channels his abilities, there isn't a team in the NFL that can stop the Eagles' offense. None.

And it's not just Vick. There are really two themes involved here, which I'll explain -- but it starts with No. 7.

The Vick adjustment

The totals Vick put up last year show a pretty good season. But even good evaluators fall into the habit of seeing a season as an entity unto itself. That diminishes patterns. And while Vick did some fantastic things last year, punctuated by the monster game in Washington, he actually struggled down the stretch, throwing six interceptions in his last five games, a number that could have been worse. And that carried into this season, with the low-point a being a Week 5 loss to the Buffalo Bills where Vick ran too much, made bad reads and threw four interceptions.

But since then, based on both Vick's play and his words, it looks to me like the light bulb has come on. It's as if he's realizing something that may sound crude, but sort of defines where he is. He has to quit being a butcher and become a surgeon. It has to be about preparation instead of instinct, caution instead of winging it and trusting his athleticism as a backup plan instead of his ""go to"". To be a surgeon, it has to be mind over body.

Just watch the tape from the Washington game. On a late drive, he saw the linebacker front set to blitz and checked to a perimeter run right for LeSean McCoy. He did this again in the Cowboys game, foiling the Dallas plan again and again. It's important to see Vick continue to check into plays that utilize the talent around him, not his own legs. It's important for a guy who throws 100 mph to find a changeup. He's the most athletic player to ever play the position, but the fact is, defenses would rather see Vick run. It makes sense -- he's hitting 67.2 percent of his passes from the pocket, among the best in the league.

Which leads to the last adjustment he seems to be making: he's running selectively. For one thing, he knows he'll never last if he wants to run. Let's face it -- he's not a big guy. Secondly, he might also see that he's not a good thrower in the play after he scrambles. The tape on this doesn't lie. When Vick takes off, he often makes poor decisions on the next throw; he gets tired, he becomes erratic and his throws get short.

With these adjustments, Vick doesn't just become better, the whole team does.

Why Eagles can be unstoppable
The fact that Vick is more selective in his running doesn't mean he won't. The threat is and will always be there. And because of that, you have the first of reasons the Eagles' offense can take off.

The threat of Vick keeps linebackers glued to the line and opens up acres of real estate in the middle of the field. Safeties drop, knowing that DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin are two of the biggest deep threats in the league, and you just see massive gaps for guys like Jason Avant and Brent Celek to exploit.

Then there's the debate of whether to go man or zone versus Philly. If you go zone, you play to Vick's throwing strengths. He's simply a much better passer against the zone, throwing into the windows as guys settle down. But if you go man, not only do you expose yourself to the terrifying reality of turning your back to Vick who could take off, you force yourself to cover the dynamic Philly receivers while a patient Vick uses his legs to extend the play not as a runner, but as a thrower. It really takes brass to turn your back on Vick.

As much as the conversation revolves around Vick, the Eagles can have a fantastic ground game when they want to use it. They struggled early, but that's because they're starting a pair of rookies up front. With Jason Peters playing brilliantly on the left side, the line is starting to jell. McCoy leads the league in yards per carry among all rushers with more than 50 carries. And it's not just the line. McCoy makes the best lateral cuts without losing speed since Barry Sanders. He's gotten better, and opposing defensive coordinators can see it.

Finally, Philly is armed with blitz-busting plays. If Vick sees it coming, as he did against Dallas, you'll get beat. This is the fastest offense in the NFL in terms of overall speed, and blitzing may get you close to Vick, but it leaves less to defend against all the dangerous targets in this offense.

Ultimately, it still comes back to Vick. It comes back to his willingness to utilize the talent around him before he utilizes his own legs, and see and memorize defenses on tape before he reacts to them on the field.

Vick's just the starting point. But if he prepares and performs like this, and truly trusts the talent around him, the Philly offense isn't going to be stopped. And Roby Ryan won't be the only one saying he's sorry.

You've seen a couple of posts about how people are tired of watching a losing team, and I agree, those posts are whiny, myopic, and laughably misguided. These people either forget or ignore the decade of great football the Birds have given us. Those are bandwagon fans. Every good team has them. And their true colors come out at the first sign of trouble.

The problem is you're projecting this attitude onto everyone who has legitimate gripes with the team. Like it or not, there are fundamental flaws with this team. We have an offensive line coach at defensive coordinator. We can't stop the run. We can't protect Vick in any consistent way. Pointing out those flaws and wanting them to change does not make us, as fans, bad fans. It's how we show we give a shit about this team. Ignoring those flaws and sitting there trying to placate everybody with your ""Everyone hold hands and stay positive!"" attitude does not make you a better fan than everyone else. It makes you sound deluded and passionless. Get off your high horse and be disappointed in these first 5 games like the rest of the fans, the city of Philadelphia, and, hell, the team itself.

And if you care so much about the way our fandom is perceived, I've got 2 options for you: 

1) Get over it and stop bashing everyone so we can continue to root for the Eagles thick and thin, or ...

2) Fuck on off to r/nygiants and give control of the subreddit to somebody who cares more about the team than their petty quibbles with how the fanbase is perceived, because we come to this subreddit to hear about the Eagles, not to get some preschool teacher lecture about how our negative attitude is bringing you down.

This season the curse we have saddled our daughter with truly hit home, the curse our parents gave to us: that of Iggles fandom.  We thought the lil' McCoy jersey and Eagles bibs and pacifiers were adorable.  Then my daughter got to see me at my worst, as the Eagles collapsed against the Lions.  And I realized, every Sunday in the fall she is likely to see her father meltdown, and she will carry that rage with her as well.  Heaven help her if we move to Dallas or NYC, because like me she'll have to hear the taunts of Giants and Cowboys fans.  However, as infuriating as being a member of the Eagles nation can be, I don't know how to love any other team.  And neither will she.	t5_2qi5w	True

alright, down to business. got to shame some people after this loss, might as well make it the fans. that's right, ***you***, the fans. not the fans who are saying ""shit, tough loss. get em next time."" y'all are cool, see you next week in the IRC where the rest of the cool people hang out, when we dismantle the Lions.

no, i speak of the bad fans. the fans who watched the team lose and automatically decide to bitch and whine about who lost the game for us.

lookie here, jack: [this](http://i.imgur.com/pyyQn.png) was the new queue as of writing this. that is one, two...wow, eight posts complaining about somebody or something, mostly Vick. you'll notice i downvoted them (and you should too!) because we don't need this sub inundated with your driveling complaints and your requests to cut who, trade who, fire who, or start who else.

(for the record: there was also a really lame advice animal that i downvoted, that just goes to the unspoken ""don't submit shitty content"" rule)

###GET THIS STRAIGHT, PEOPLE: YOU ARE NOT IN CHARGE FOR A REASON.

it's fine to express disappointment in somebody's play. should Vick have done a better job holding onto the ball on that mad dash for the endzone? you're goddamn right he should've. it's fine if you say Nnamdi got beat a bit too many times for comfort. say whatever you want about somebody's play. it's fine if you say our offensive linemen (the good ones) got beat here and there; they sure did. it's fine if you say whatever offering some kind of insight.

hat being shed, nobody wants to hear why we need to shakeup everything because of one loss, or even really, one play. Nnamdi got beat? ***CUT HIM!*** Vick fumbled? ***BENCH HIM!*** Andy called too many passes? ***FIRE HIM!*** it's like living in a fucking mental hospital, listening to you shitty fans after EVERY SINGLE LOSS overreacting to every mistake regardless of how big. mistakes and losses will happen, people. Vick is gonna have some bad games. let's look a few weeks ago at what happened on Monday night in Atlanta. Peyton Manning threw three interceptions. do you think Denver was calling for him to be benched in favor of a rookie? no, they weren't. because Peyton has a history of winning. juuuuuuust like another QB i know who brought his previous team to the playoffs a bunch, and then, on his new team, has a record of 18-12 including playoffs. fuckin right it's Vick.

the Eagles are a **professional** football team. let them do their jobs and at least give them the appearance of support. because, quire frankly, you're making the rest of us (read: the good fans) look bad.

###tl;dr: if you're gonna call for a player to be cut or benched after his bad games, you have to call for his number to be retired after every good game.

what, you don't wanna do that because that's ridiculous? oh, then maybe you should shut the fuck up with your depth chart suggestions.

almost forgot:

##Additional Note: 

I decided to randomize the list of 23 people **100 Times** instead of just 3 times.  I figured this would make sure the list was nice and scrambled.  I am going to include a Screenshot and Video of the drawing so you can see that it was done legit.  The person to finish in the #1 spot wins the Jersey - The people who finish in slots 2 and 3 will both receive some Reddit Gold.  

Hope you guys enjoyed the contests.  I know we had a lot of fun setting this up. Thanks again for playing along with us.

Our D will be tested on a whole different level. A more physicial and speedier RB in Ray Rice. A QB who is more inclined to throw the big ball down the field and tear up defenses. Also some more physicial WRs. 

What really worries me is the Ravens D... Those safety and corner blitzes are going to be a nightmare for our O line and Vick. Ray Lewis and Ed Reed looking for Vicks balls up in the air and laying big hits. 

This is going to be either go big or go home for the Eagles. This will be a true testament to our Birds. All said, I will be at the game cheering my lungs out for the Birds on Sunday.

1375968017.0	1jyca3	Tips for watching the Eagles in the rain	BlackCoffee73	29	3	17	"Going to the preseason game tomorrow night?  Thunderstorms are predicted.  Here is what I know, please chime in with your own tips. 


* **No Umbrellas**. They won't go through security, leave them in the car. cheap quality ponchos are available at the stadium ($3?), but you are better off getting them at a dollar store, or using a trash bag. 


* no matter what rain gear you wear, you will be wet by the time the game is done.  Keep a towel in the car.  Remember you will be cold when you are wet. Avoid wearing cotton. 


* Your feet will get soaked. You will most likely have to walk a mile or more like this... Wear crocks/keens/whatever.  Prepare for blisters.  Be careful, the concrete in the stadium gets slick. 


* If there is lightening, the game will be halted and may be cancelled. 

* Only the box seats will remain dry.  If you are in the seats with the common folk, prepare to get wet. 

* Remember the NFL's new policy towards bags.  Clear plastic of limited size. This is pre-season for security too, so they will be slow, give extra time to get in the stadium.

1366416014.0	1cpk3o	Little story of an encounter with a small eagles fan.	Imperial_Panda	32	5	4	"Ok I have a little story with an eagles fan I met at work the other day.

I work at a fairly large retail store, and I was having a crummy day so far. Anyways, later on the day I see a guest who needs help finding something, and I notice her son(probably no more than 7 yrs. Old) with her and he's wearing none other than an Eagles hat!! 

I'm kind of blown away at this point and decide to ask if he's actually an eagles fan. His eyes immediately lit up and is surprised to see I'm one aswell. So I give him a high five and he starts talking about how he's been playing with the eagles on madden and that he's beaten the patriots, the giants, and the cowboys over 100x! All the while his mother is just smiling at her son. 

I ask him if he's excited for next season and again his eyes lit up and he says he can't wait for Chip Kelly's Eagles! That little kid honestly made my day, it was awesome to know that even at such a young age, half way across the country there are passionate eagles fans! :)

1355089584.0	14kem8	A few things we learned today.	tiggs	31	6	17	"We won today and it feels great, even though we don't have much to play for except pride.  There were a few things that really stood out though and are almost impossible to ignore.

1.  **Nick Foles** - The kid's a gamer.  He still makes poor decisions from time to time and his vision isn't the greatest (ie. trying to squeeze it info McNutt when Maclin was wide open on final drive).  He's showing an amazing amount of improvement week to week though and that's a VERY good sign.  This is the type of kid that will have a full training camp and come back as an absolute beast.  My one gripe with him is his deep ball accuracy.  I'm not talking about the types of passes that he hit Avant at the 1yd line with.  I'm talking about when he's got someone deep and he lobs it up.  On the pass to Avant down the sideline when he was WIDE open with nothing but space in front of him, he actually threw a pretty poor ball.  He didn't lead the receiver at all and Avant had to just sit there and wait for it, while the ball was fading towards the sideline.  

2.  **Wide 9** - Wow, our defense looked very good today.  I think it's safe to say that getting rid of the wide 9 is the best move we've made all season.  Our pass rush was getting good penetration and most importantly, our new system doesn't rely as heavily on the safeties to do too much.  In the wide 9, they had to worry about a run lane.  That wouldn't be an issue if we had good safeties, but ours suck.  This way, they're responsible for normal types of safety things and we're not asking too much from players without a high talent level.  Shit, we all know how weak Colt Anderson is at safety and he even played well in this new system.

3.  **CBs** - Our cornerbacks played great today.  DRC was an absolute beast and Nnamdi did his thing as well.  Nnamdi allowed 2 completions, 1 of which was a TD, but his coverage was great.  Very few balls throw his way and the TD was just a great throw and catch. Nnamdi had good coverage, but it was simply a case of good defense and better offense. I'll attribute this to the lack of the wide 9 as well.  This had nothing to do with the ""pep talk"" Andy Reid had with them, like the announcers kept pointing out.  This had to do with a system that didn't work, that had no pass rush and had safeties being pulled out of position and blowing coverage assignments.  It was making the CBs look horrible, but most of it honestly had nothing to do with them.  I really hope we get to see our last 3 games play out like this, so Nnamdi and DRC can prove to the fans that they really are the real deal and not the bullshit the media has made them out to be. 

4.  **DL** - Our pass rush looked great.  We didn't necessarily get a ton of sacks, but there was penetration on almost every play. We saw some big plays from Vinnie Curry, Fletcher Cox, and Brandom Graham.  Trent Cole was also in the QB's face all day.   I believe Jenkins had our only sack (edit: Cox had one too) and this is a group we should bring back in it's entirety next season.  

5.  **Defensive Play Calling** - Since ditching the wide 9, we have the ability to call a wider range of defensive sets.  In the wide 9, you ALWAYS have to worry about those run gaps, so you're kind of crippled as to what you can call.  Because we no longer have this issue, we were mixing in all sorts of exotic blitzes.  I hate to make the comparisons, but I haven't seen so many different blitzes mixed in since the days of Jim Johnson.  Our defense is getting it's nuts back and I'm happy as fuck about it.  

6.  **Injuries** - We were missing 8 of our 11 starts on offense.  We would have literally blown them out if we had our weapons.  That says quite a bit about our young players though, to step up and beat a hot TB team in their house.
