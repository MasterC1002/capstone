1329106490.0	pn04j	To the waiter who shook my hand for being a NASA scientist - I hope you read this	sm_usagi	2633	873	188	"You served us on the upper west side tonight, and mentioned that you read reddit, so I hope you see this. You overheard some of our conversation and asked what we did - at the table were two astronomers, one former astronomer and a lawyer. You mentioned how much you like the science posts on reddit, like the Kepler discoveries. That's when I told you I was a NASA scientist and that was the mission I worked on. You almost stepped back, and then asked more quietly if you could shake my hand. It was humbling and an honor to oblige! You made me feel like a rockstar, and as a nerdy science type, I don't get that very often (or in fact at all). Thank you so much for being excited about science, and for totally making my trip to New York even more amazing. We need more people like you! The only reason sciences like astronomy get any funding is because the public get excited by them, so to me, you are the rockstar. Stay awesome.

&gt;How has my perspective of humans changed? It's an interesting question, because you really have time to reflect when you're so far from home. You know, there are six of us on board and we are completely separate from the other six and a half billion of the rest of us. So you feel that physical separation. But, it may be surprising to you, but in fact I feel closer to everyone I think as a result. When you live in your house and your street and your town and your province and your country, you tend to identify those things almost like layers of a fortress around yourself. You know, I'm from this place, and all those things are barriers between you and everybody else. And even travel tends to break that down. But to be in a position where you can go around the world in 92 minutes and see every place over and over and over again, those barriers fade. And of course I still see the strife and the stupid things we do, like what happened yesterday in Boston, and then the suffering we have to put through like the enormous earthquake in Iran today; things still happen, and some people still horribly misbehave. But the vast majority of people are good. And people are just trying to find joy and raise their children well and find grace in life. And for me up here, I found part way through the flight, I just feel like I just refer to everybody as just ""us."" It's all of us, together, in this and so I think it's a perspective that some people get naturally and that some people will never get, but I know it's a perspective that having the chance to see the world the way that I've been trying to show it in the pictures I've been sending back, it's a perspective that you definitely get when you live on board a space station."	t5_2qhor	True

1344686086.0	y1mng	I was out stargazing last night with my 8-inch dobsonian telescope, and I saw the ISS - I mean REALLY saw it, in detail!	Destructor1701	386	69	64	"It was incredibly clear here last night. 

I've been hobbying at astronomy for the last year or so, and I've just gotten a beautiful new scope, an Orion Skyquest XT-8 Classic Dobsonian - 8 inch aperture, about 4 feet of tube length, it's quite the monster.

I had spotted 3 galaxies in close proximity in Ursa Major. I was so hyped about that, I ran in to get my laptop and brought it out to identify them (I'm pretty sure they were M81 and 82, and whatever the one to the east of them is). 

While I was sitting on the ground doing this, my laptop's battery died. In frustration, I threw my eyes to the sky, and my attention was caught by a very bright, steady, moving light. I knew it could only be the ISS, which I've seen pass over a few times (including during the docking of the last shuttle mission last year).

I occasionally train the telescope on satellites as they pass over and track them across the sky, more for the thrill of the chase than for any visual reasons. This time, though, while I expected to see the usual point-of-light, I was met by - gasp!

*SOLAR PANELS*!

I looked again - 

*HAB MODULES!*

I started tracking the ISS with the telescope, watching the sun glint off individual solar panel prongs! I could see how the undulated surface of the panels reflected light unevenly! 

As I watched, the station passed into the shadow of the Earth's atmosphere, it became tinged gold, and then bronze, and finally blue before fading from view.

I stood there in the darkness, with the milky way painted over my head, panting the words ""HOLY SHIT!"" over and over again.

If I ever meet one of those flat-earthers, or moon landing deniers, I'm going to have an even harder time now, not smacking them in the jaw.

What I saw was [like this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsc80evqJ88&amp;feature=related), only much smaller, shinier, and more beautiful. Also less jerky."	t5_2qhor	True

Over the past couple of years we've seen this subreddit grown into a great place where experienced astronomers, and those new to the field can connect. 

The spam filter is doing a much better job of ensuring that content is of high quality. 

We've added a number of great resources to the sidebar over the past year, and are compiling a list of even more items to add. 

The decision to make the subreddit more friendly to novices by removing the downvote link has been well received by a good majority of the subscriber base. 




A small minority of people have expressed a negative opinion towards the lack of a downvote button on posts, and I'll be the first to admit the decision wasn't made lightly. We really do have to balance the need for a open, friendly area for astronomers of all backgrounds (and experience levels) to connect, however, we can't have this subreddit clogged up with garbage content either. 

I'll remind everyone once again that if you see a post that is blatantly violating the subreddit rules (blogspam, rage comics, etc.) PLEASE report it, as it will be flagged for review. 

As for comments, we'll be re-enabling downvotes on comments in the near future and will closely monitor for signs of abuse.  If comment downvoting ends up being abused again, it will be disabled again.  We didn't have as much abuse with comment downvotes as we did post downvotes, so it's a pretty safe decision to re-enable comment downvotes. 

Regarding ""appropriate"" content for /r/astronomy :

Astronomy means different things to different people. Some observe our Moon, and other planets in our solar system, while others observe meteors and comets. There are even those who follow the latest astrophysics research.  Of course, there are also the backyard observers who would like to share their views of the night sky, as well as those who'd like help getting started. 

That all being said, let me take a moment to remind those who are considering submitting that this is an astronomy-related area.  

While many of us here are fans of NASA and SpaceX, posting about the latest Dragon launch, or SLS/Orion isn't really astronomy related (unless said launch is a new space telescope) 

Please also check to see if something has already been posted before you post. Many other subreddits are plagued by people finding ""creative"" ways to re-submit content that has already been posted.  We've seen this happen a few times here, and are looking at ways we can curtail it. 

As always, if you have feedback, (positive or negative), feel free to message the moderators by using the link in the lower right corner. 

Thanks again for participating in /r/astronomy!

1348825167.0	10m19y	For the curious, this is the unnamed galaxy that was at the top of yesterday's Astronomy Picture of the Day	Antibody624	300	26	16	"Yesterday's [APOD image](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120927.html) was spectacular, as they usually are, but when I enlarged the image and looked at the top of it, a little to the left of the center, I saw what looked like a spiral galaxy. [I've pointed it out here](http://i.imgur.com/1e9rb.jpg) (It's larger in the APOD image, but I wanted to include some point of reference). They didn't mention it in the image's description, but as it was the only galaxy that immediately caught my eye, I felt compelled to find out more about it. So I opened up Google Earth and [followed the bright stars above NGC 6726 to find it and its coordinates](http://i.imgur.com/JRaPr.jpg). Once I did, and entered the coordinates in SIMBAD's coordinate search, the result was [ESO 396-16](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=ESO%20396-16&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;submit=submit%20id&amp;Radius=2). 

The galaxy's SIMBAD page, at first glance, looks a bit empty, but by just knowing its [Morphological Type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification), we learn that it's a SBd, which means it's a [Barred Spiral Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy). The APOD image looks like a barred spiral, but that Google Sky image sure is blurry. To be sure what we saw in the APOD image are actually the arms of a spiral galaxy, let's take a closer look on [SimPlay](http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/SimPlay/#target=ESO%20396-16&amp;lp=true&amp;rp=true&amp;bp=true). Looks like it matches up!

My hope is that I'm not the only one here who saw this galaxy and wanted to know more about it, and that by making this post, I've helped satisfy your curiosity, and at the very least helped show ways you can satisfy it for yourself if you ever run into a similar situation to this!

This is a very urban area, like those that will be affected by this storm. Take advantage of 'clear skies' and 'no city lights' to see what you only get to see in photos. Please share them here on Reddit.

It shook my house and rattled my windows. But I went outside and could hear a series of small distant explosions/pops to the east of me. I am in Pioneer CA, in the foothills of central California. The local news is just starting to talk about it. It may have been a piece of the comet Thatcher.

This was important because I won't live to see the next Venus transit, but I missed it. 

I am interested in astronomical events of this nature coming up in 2013 so I can prepare for them in advance. Something where an important experiment or calculation of historical significance can be repeated for the purpose of learning...
