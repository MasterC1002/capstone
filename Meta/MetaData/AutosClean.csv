1360086247.0	17xy5c	Lane Splitting and Driver's Reactions	bravo145	463	99	357	"Sorry if this is considered off topic but there is currently a discussion on /r/motorcycles about legalizing lane splitting and the obvious point was brought up that of course our subreddit is going to agree on it. So auto guys, what are your feelings on motorcycles being able to lane filter/split? If you are against it what reservations or concerns do you have? What has formed that opinion? What can us motorcyclists do to sway you to our side?

I am linking this post within our current discussion as well so hopefully we can have an interesting conversation on the different perspectives on the issue.

**EDIT:** Since this is getting bigger than I thought let me provide some background info for new readers. Lane filtering is the ability of a motorcycle to move between cars at a stop light to the front. Lane splitting is moving between cars within moving or potentially moving traffic such as rush hour and traffic jams. I am not referring to the idiots you see weaving through traffic at 100mph, I'm referring more to CHP guidelines which dictate that traffic should be slower than 30 mph and you should not exceed the flow of traffic by more than 10 mph.

1370484449.0	1fri7h	A stranger let me drive his Model S	garytherival	307	52	51	"I left the library late last night, at about 12:30 AM. I was ready to go to sleep but I got that urge to take the long way home on a quiet night. So off I went. I cruised around town for about 10 minutes, taking a route shorter than my normal ones because I was tired.

I ended up in a nice residential area tucked along the river. The streets are narrow and poorly-lit so I was taking it easy and just enjoying the scenery.

As I turned around a bend, I saw a semi parked in the street. Keep in mind, this is late on a Friday night in a residential area of a small city in Iowa. I slowed down to make sure there was no traffic before I passed it. As I drove by, I saw the door open and the taillights of an A6 flashed back at me.

Intrigued, I stopped behind the truck to see what was going on. There were more cars in the trailer but I couldn't quite make them out, especially the ones on top. (It was a closed trailer.) Then, the lights of the car above the A6 turned on and I couldn't tell what model it was, which is very unusual for me.

As they began to back the car out onto the ramp, I saw the wheels. It was a Model S. In Iowa. I had to find out what was going on.

I backed up and parked in the street. As I walked back to the truck, there were two younger men standing behind it. ""You saw it, right?""

""Yeah, I saw it but I don't believe it,"" I said. The man introduced himself as Ravi. He and his friend were excitedly watching the car be unloaded. I looked around for someone who could be the owner but it was just the three of us and the truck driver.

I asked Ravi for the story behind the car. He simply replies ""I ordered it about 18 months ago and I've been waiting for this night for a long time."" I didn't expect this guy, who was no more than 30, to tell me the car was his.

He was pretty cool. I told him that I had to hang around to get some pictures of the Tesla. He said he could tell I was an enthusiast by my car (G37 coupe) and invited me to park in his driveway.

I walked down from the house and there it was. The presence of the Model S is stunning. It was painted metallic brown, similar to Porsche's Macadamia color, and it was gorgeous. As Ravi signed the paperwork, I got my time with the car, inspecting all the shapes and details. As Ravi and his friend returned, I was ready to thank him and be on my way.

""Hop in! We're gonna see what this thing can do.""

Now, it's not often that I get into cars with strangers, especially with ones who intend to thrash freshly-delivered rockets. But there was a Model S 85kW before me and I wasn't going to get this opportunity again. I got in the passenger seat, awestruck.

Ravi wasted no time. He put it in drive and nailed it, with no regard to the men standing around the truck, the fact that he was driving blind into oncoming traffic as he passed it, or the 25 MPH speed limit in this quiet neighborhood. All I can do is echo what the journalists all say - the sensation was unreal. Swift, forceful, and silent. We had hit 60 before I knew what happened. It crossed my mind that this may not have been the best idea.

We slowed down and got to talking. Ravi told me that he owned some local hotels and I told him I was still a student. We cruised around town for a little while, launching from stoplights, playing with the regen braking, and trying to figure out the dashboard. (It's very cool but very frustrating to use. It took three young, tech-savvy, car guys far too long to figure out the volume control.)

Ravi took us to the interstate for some on-ramp action. Not only did he floor it, taking us past 100 before we hit the end of the ramp, but he barely braked for the curves. I'm a spirited driver but I would have to be VERY comfortable with a car before I tried this. I was genuinely terrified.

""I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but if you could refrain from killing me 15 minutes after I met you, that would be great.""

He sensed my tension and reassured me that he does this to his cars all the time. But he said he would take me back to my car before he and his friend took it to some empty roads to open it up. This was fine with me - I didn't want to impose.

He pulled into a gas station after we got off the interstate. ""Your turn,"" he said.

""Wait, what?"" I replied. ""You don't mind?""

""Nah, it's fine. You seem cool.""

I got in the driver's seat and brought us back. Again, I'll echo all the reviewers- that acceleration is intoxicating. I didn't hesitate to open it up (and then I understood why Ravi drove it so hard earlier). I was begging to find an M3 or something at a stoplight but the streets were empty, which was perfectly fine.

We arrived back at the house and I thanked the man gratuitously for the drive. ""If you ever get a hankering to drive a 5 year old G37, you give me a call,"" I told him. I got into my lowly combustion-engine thing and drove home, disturbed by the noise and vibration of it compared to the Tesla. I had this feeling after my first time on a speedbike that driving would never be the same again. It won't."	t5_2qhr3	True
