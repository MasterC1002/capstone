1366390944.0	1consf	A word from a recovering conspiratard...	Typoking	451	42	209	"* One time I called in sick because I was convinced the stock market was gonna crash that day.  I stayed at home and watched CNBC all day.  Turns out it was a slow day in the markets.  

* One Christmas Eve, I went down to my local store that was advertising flu shots on a billboard type sign outside.  I spray painted ""They'll kill you."" on the sign.  I had done my part, I thought.

* I believed in reptilians.  David Icke, Annunaki, reptilian shapeshifters... the works.  I spent hours upon hours smoking pot and studying youtube videos of fox news anchors to see if i could make out reptile eyes.  I even compiled a list in notepad which I titled ""evidence"" where I thought reptile eyes, or shapeshifting glitches (ie. video compression issues) were giving them away.  

* I researched the masons, oh Christ, how I researched the free masons.  I genuinely considered molotoving the local freemason church in my area.

* I thought that the government was on to me the entire time.  I thought that they were tracking my browser history, and were keeping a close eye on me because of the 'secrets' I was exposing.  

* I thought my neighbor, who's a cop and an ex-soldier was a spy and that he had bugged my house.  

* I thought that the NWO was controlling the globe in order to breed slaves and that the top tier of this cabal was a ring of pedophilic reptiles, the top being Satan.  

* I saw symbols everwhere.  Lady Gaga videos, Lil' Wayne, Bieber, Jake Gyllenhall, Ryan Gosling... I was convinced that these were all brainwashed robots victimized as children by reptiles and bred to become famous and to pacify the masses as their leaders stripped them of all freedoms.  They brainwashed the masses using hand gestures and satanic imagery that hypnotized the viewers. 

* I just asked questions.


These are a few of the things I was into as an ex conspiratard.  I'm not as ashamed looking back as I am glad that I'm not into it anymore.  I remember thinking how I was the only who could 'see'.  I remember thinking how smart and observant I was.  I was convinced the world was going to end.  I bought a rifle.  I was convinced social order would break down and decay would set in at any second.  But it didn't, and it won't.  

I think I'm gonna write a book about my time as a conspiratard.  It would make for hilarious and frightening reading.  But I digress...

I just wanted to say that as a former conspiratard, this subreddit is the funniest shit ever.  EVER.  "	t5_2r2dd	True

1331829101.0	qxybb	Hello friends, I am from r/conspiracy and wish to ask some questions/understand what r/conspiratard is about.		402	95	1142	"So yeah,

Since late 2011, I was completely oblivious to any of these views and I used to eat up whatever the MSM would tell me.  After Gaddafi's death, I was pretty happy because the newspaper told me that we killed an evil dictator and all of the Libyan people were going to finally live in a peaceful, democratic country.

One of my friends told me that Gaddafi was actually pretty cool and nice to the citizens of Libya.  He believed in equality, and that everyone in Libya should have shelter.  He had a major role in the African Union and had a big man-made river created in Libya, to help farmers grow crops in the desert.  I was like: ""what?  why would the television and newspaper lie to me??"".  This was a turning point in my journey towards the truth.

After that moment, I stopped playing StarCraft II and used my time to research stuff, using alternate media and the [/r/conspiracy](/r/conspiracy) subreddit.  They were really cool.  I watched infowars for a bit but I felt like Alex Jones was kind of fear-mongering too and would just go on about stupid stuff, so I stopped watching him.  Same with that former governer/pro-wrestler guy with a cheesy show, I felt like he took stuff that could potentially be real and interesting and he made it look retarded. :-/

Anyway, I now use websites like corbettreport, mediamonarchy, vigilantcitizen, endthelie, RT (even if its like a russian Fox News, there's lots of info you wouldn't get from western news) and my favorite: globalresearch.ca with Prof. Michel Chossudovsky.

I'm here, wondering what Conspiratard's view on all things conspiracy-related is.  I'm not sure if you guys are just here to poke fun at [/r/conspiracy](/r/conspiracy) or actually believe in some conspiracies, but just do more research and look for the hard facts (something I admit isn't always present in other subreddits).  Do you guys believe the holocaust was a zionist conspiracy or that the Illuminati is running the world, or Barrack Obama is actually a CIA agent named Barry Soetoro.

Well, thanks.

Edit:  I'm not totally trolling.  Just some parts.  I'm actually interested in your guys' perspectives."	t5_2r2dd	True

I would first like to say, well done to all of you brave and intrepid people. May your scales glisten with goyim blood! Our plan to render /r/politics into a non functional entity has been immensely successful. 

Instead of bringing attention to developing political movements and relaying news through acceptable mediums, it's now reduced to a series of fringe news websites spewing paranoid propoganda; rendering it's readership useless, inept and paranoid miscreants.

Our next plan will require a great deal of work, so you know the drill, meet in the secret masonic hall underneath the secret synagogue underneath the capitol building. Bring your best robes!

There will be unflouridated water for all to enjoy and snacks.

Given our recent spate of success in instigating endless war, mass racial tension and with FEMA's recent advancements in the concentration camps, I think it's fair to say we can slow down our plans for now and just enjoy what we've got.


However...

I must bring to your attention some alarming news. It does appear David Icke, Mark Dice and Alex Jones are onto us. 

We really need to stop leaving so much crap lying about, I mean who's damn idea was it to leave the All Seeing Eye on the dollar?! Which one of you lizards is responsible?!

And who in the hell took out insurance on the twin towers?! Come on guys! Paper trails!

That's all I have for you today, carry on about your business, and remember! Divide et impera, novus ordo seculorum!

P.S. Nibiru is coming into view soon and we'll be aligned, so get yourself ready for the anti-christ.

As some of you may know, I recently got into a series of heated conversations with the distinguished Nobel laureates that make up /r/conspiracy in this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ctkq5/cannabis_cures_cancer_and_big_pharma_has_the/

I've received a number of friendly messages from individuals claiming to be from this board, and I figured it would be easier to show my gratitude here rather than individually. As I've told a number of people, I certainly had no intention of going through that thread and explaining  medicine in a way that would be 100% effective. While I may be a pessimist, the reality is that a majority of those individuals will never change. This is assumptive, but the types of people found in these places have never developed the cognitive faculties to process information to a degree necessary to alter their worldview. 

Anyways, you all seem like a delightful crowd and reading through the frontpage posts when I get a chance has proven to be quite entertaining. Keep fighting the good, and likely futile, fight."	t5_2r2dd	True

Back in 2001, I was 21 years old and somewhat religious. I might even call my political belief back then to be center or even conservative. Back then, I believed marriage was between a man and a woman, but I did not hate gay people. And yeah, I used to believe in God. Silly me. 

Anyways, I remember 9/11 well because my TV channel went to snow (I know, /r/firstworldproblems), but I was able to catch the burning towers on another channel and called my friend to talk about it while it happened.

When the first tower collapsed, I was convinced that something was fishy. I saw the smoke plumes jutting out the towers. I saw the neat collapse. My mind had already formed the first part of the conspiracy for me -- and this is key. My observations were based on fear and poor human judgement, I had to make sense of it all. And a controlled demolition seemed right. My next mistake was to go online...on digg...and Alex Jones...and any other site that confirmed my suspicions (what a coincidence, the very thing I fear has a website and brave men dedicated to uncovering it). And in truth, we were not liars -- just very misinformed and very ignorant.

So who lied to who? All the conspiratards lied to us. To me, my friends, my family. And I repeated those lies. They took half-truths and partial information from photos and videos and made up their own conclusions and then fed them to us. We happily gobbled it up because it satisfied our suspicions.

Let me tell you something that will chill you to your core. Religion is dangerous. There is not one religious person on this planet who believes that they will be punished for their so-called sins. There is no religious person who believes that it is they who will suffer. That is supreme arrogance and it guides they way they think. It used to guide the way I thought. You think you are invincible because some invisible sky fairy will whisk you away upon death and reward you with immortality in another dimension while all the suckers who didn' follow this path will burn. The people that believe this are dangerous. They believe they are above the ""material world"" and that they are above the United States government or any government or laws. Religious persons are loyal to one thing only -- their deity. They will fuck over this country if it so pleases their beliefs. Do atheist conspiracy theorists exist? Absolutely, but that is another debate. I got swept up in that religious-backed fervor after 9/11. It felt like it was a sign to believers. And we were foolish. We remained ignorant. We dismissed the facts. We shunned those who disagreed with us as being blind to the truth. If anything, it made our beliefs stronger because we were being ""attacked."" You'll never get a bigger hard-on than when you feel you are being ""persecuted.""

It's that simple. Take fear, combine it with ignorance and you have a dangerous mix to get anyone to believe anything.

When I was on digg, I once honestly believe the story of another member who claimed that at any day now, Cheney would launch martial law against the United States or a ballistic missile would fly into the city to support a false invasion or permanent FEMA detention camps would be erected. I fell for it. I actually told my mother and warned her. I was scared at any loud noise from outside my house and dreamnt about planes crashing into buildings. I was terrified. And that is how they keep you in the cycle of fear and ignorance. After a while you start to just conjure up fears without any help. You then feed those back into the conversation and its one big circlejerk.

I believed in thermite explosives, that was debunked. I believed in WTC7 being a controlled explosion, that was debunked. However, I had my ace-in-the-hole with the Pentagon! AH-HA! How do you explain the small hole, my fair sheeple? Well, easy. Another photograph showed the Pentagon three days after it was struck with a massive collapsed section. But. But. I saw the small hole! It was a hole made by a piece of the aircraftc falling off and rocketing into that part of the building. Easy, simple logical rational explanations. And for close to a decade I was blind -- willfully. I choose to stay in the dark because it was comfortable. I had an enemy -- the conniving government, muslims, Cheney, Rove, Dubya, PNAC! That was also key -- you need an enemy to keep the conspiracy alive. It makes a better story -- like religion.

Anyways, I am all better now, thanks to the Internet allowing me to look at all the evidence. Also, keep in mind that governments across the world can often be scary and have performed fasle flag attacks, but governments are also bloated, uncoordinated, often staffed by idiots and would be at a loss to properly conduct a well-timed attack such as 9/11/01. Beyond the morons, there are hard-working honest people working in governments across the world. You cannot keep secrets for long -- they always leak. And I believe in good people who would have blown that whistle a long time ago. (Unless of course, the masked CIA SAD/SOG operative assassins got to them first!)

I think I know how many conservatives in America feel right now. I have walked in their shoes and I hear the same ignorant arguments that guided my thinking when I was younger. It's all about fear with a sprinkling of religion. You need both for a winning combination. However, you still need a hook. Simply discover what a man fears and you can make him believe, say or do anything you desire. You can even make that same man hurt himself so long as he belives it keeps his fears away.

TL;DR I was a truther because I was ignorant and afraid and people capitalized on that fear.

http://i.imgur.com/ZNrlYmj.png



Not on this account though. No, this account was banned long ago. I got banned on my alt account - /u/InterrogatoryBunny. 9 months ago after coming across a link on Youtube, I had the brilliant idea to make an alt account to test exactly how racist /r/conspiracy actually was. The plan was this:



1. Create an account with a subtle and not-too-blatant name to post with.



2. Collect stories, articles, videos, etc. about Jews in innocent contexts that I found while browsing the internet.




3. Apply overtly racist overtones to the post, both with titles and comments.



4. Post them to /r/conspiracy, carefully controlling who I told about the posts so the response was as accurate as possible.



It did better than I expected. Many of the more 'blatant' and ridiculous posts were downvoted, but a few of my links got over 100 net upvotes.


A screenshot of my userpage: http://i.imgur.com/7PI8Vrp.png



The comments were also unsurprising, with brilliant moments such as:




* http://i.imgur.com/1xilEsC.png


* http://i.imgur.com/A2yTIas.png



* http://i.imgur.com/s8JPxOA.png






Top posts:




* 'A Jew owns reddit' - 297 upvotes, 142 net upvotes




* 'The guy who shot Lee Harvey Oswald was Jewish' - 87 upvotes, 30 net upvotes.




* 'The FBI investigated the Jewish Defense League for extortion' - 121 upvotes, 90 net upvotes







Sadly, it seems like my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1gm8lf/has_anyone_ever_noticed_that_jew_boys_have_their/) pushed it over the top. It was just too blatant. Several users called me out for repeated cases of racism, and about a day after posting it I received a ban message.



However, I don't think for one moment that the /r/conspiracy mods actually banned the account for racism. I think that someone tipped them off. Admittedly, I bragged a bit about my account in an open chat room with almost 90 people in it. Someone noticed. A week ago, I got this message on IRC:

[14:45] &lt;XfhGe485&gt; I know what you're doing


[14:45] &lt;BipolarBear0&gt; ?


[14:45] &lt;XfhGe485&gt; Don't play dumb.


[14:45] &lt;BipolarBear0&gt; Do I know you?


[14:45] &lt;XfhGe485&gt; I know you have an account named InterrogatoryBunny, and that you're using it to discredit /r/conspiracy and make us look like lunatics.


[14:46] &lt;BipolarBear0&gt; wtf are you talking about? /r/conspiracy does that well enough on its own

[14:46] &lt;XfhGe485&gt; Don't think you can pull your fucking shill bullshit on us. I told the /r/conspiracy mods. You're gone.

1370171996.0	1fij6n	This guy is pretty great	Facehammer	131	15	68	"Good afternoon, fellow troll-shills! I'd like to introduce you to someone. You'll like him a lot.

[cpkdoc](http://www.reddit.com/user/cpkdoc) is a chiropractic ~~quack~~ doctor, bitcoiner, Truther, anti-GMOer, anti-vaxxer, and chronic sufferer of the Dunning-Kruger effect. He is, of course, a regular poster in r/conspiracy. But what else is he?

To kick things off, he believes there is [a global Satanic child ass-rape conspiracy with vampires or something](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dgka6/til_according_to_the_us_food_and_drug/c9rfi9a?context=3) because he saw a documentary about it on youtube once! He knows it's legit because it was on the History Channel!

He sincerely believes [hyperinflation is just around the corner, and to prepare for it you should default on your student loans](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fgqfk/obama_sticks_up_for_students_because_they/caaimfs?context=3)!

He thinks [big gummint Obamacare will have patients dragged out of hospitals and left in the streets](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1eon1k/la_to_go_after_vegas_hospital_accused_of_dumping/ca2dnif?context=3)!

He's a [freeman on the land](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19ytuh/bitcoin_tax_calculator/c8snevv?context=3)!

He likes [bashing out walls of text citing debunked pseudoscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1f8081/guitarrr_claims_that_i_and_a_large_group_of/ca8cij6?context=3)!

He thinks [there are shills, shills everywhere and he has the magic words to beat them](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f7efu/russia_warns_obama_global_war_over_bee_apocalypse/ca7zfob?&amp;context=3)!

He likes buttcoins because [The Man can't control him](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1eknut/cnet_winklevoss_twins_on_bitcoin_time_to_work/ca1d1tz?context=3)!

He thinks [vaccines cause autism and whale.to is a serious source](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dgka6/til_according_to_the_us_food_and_drug/c9zcqoo?context=3), and that [smallpox wouldn't be so bad](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dgka6/til_according_to_the_us_food_and_drug/c9rzou4?context=3)! Naturally, this doesn't go down [quite as well as he had hoped in r/TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dgka6/til_according_to_the_us_food_and_drug/c9q3zsa)!

He loves to [pontificate on science and medicine to scientists and doctors,  despite knowing nothing about either](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1e6eur/british_psychological_society_declares_that/c9xq4nk?context=3)!

He thinks the Pentagon is targeting your brain with flu vaccines! (Quoted here due to vicious censorship from r/science's fascist mods):

&gt;Isn't this great? At least we know the pentagram and DHS won't use anything like this on people. There is a leaked video from the pentagram discussing using flu vaccines to target genes in the brain from 2005. 

(Bonus points: [his r/conspiracy thread on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1d84fc/leaked_pentagon_video_flu_vaccine_use_to_modify/)!

He is also [a truther](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dooym/what_is_a_theory_you_at_one_time_believed_but_now/c9seetp?context=3), and if you disagree, well clearly you've [drunk too much fluoride](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1blcno/lets_see_if_it_collapses/c98def1?context=3)!

He thinks [HAARP causes earthquakes](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cgdjp/80_earthquake_strikes_iran/c9gatdn?context=3)!

And, *of course*, he thinks [the Judeo-Bolsheviks are behind it all](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/197v8u/russian_redditers_how_is_joseph_stalin_viewed_in/c8lpijp?context=3)!

When I started digging through his post history in preparation for this thread, I honestly had no idea what a goldmine I'd just hit. I've been chortling like an idiot for the last half hour. I really think that we're looking at the next Conspiratard superstar here. And remember: people come to this guy and pay him for medical advice!

To be honest it really drove me up the wall. I had tried to tell him a million times that he shouldn't believe everything he reads and that I don't share his views and that sometimes bad stuff happens for no reason, only for him to scream at me and insult me for being so blind and stupid.  I got out of that job but still run into these nut jobs on almost a daily bases and they're always unbelievably rude and will not shut up. 

I just wanted to say thanks for giving me a place to vent and thanks for assuring me that there are still some people that don't believe every scary youtube video they watch.

It ends in claiming all conspiracy theorists are neo nazis and further ostricizes our growing subreddit by claiming to have all the answers in five easy to read paragraphs.

The Reddit-sphere is clever enough to know the truth; why should they believe it to be a fantasy.

**Bush:** Thank you gentleman for coming to this important meeting. Today, we're going to plan a terrorist attack on the United States.

**Bob:** Why?

**Bush:** So that we can have an excuse to invade Iraq and get all their oil.

**Bob:** Why don't we just invade Iraq anyway? We're the US, we've never needed an excuse to invade anybody before.

**Bush:** Bob, I'm running this meeting so if you can just quiet down, thanks. Okay, so the way Dick and I thought of it is, we're going to attack the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and *[flips through notes]* uh...apparently we have no third target so we're just going to shoot down a plane over Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Bob, you'll be in charge of the WTC plan, Jeff, you do the Pentagon, and Greg, you guys are in charge of the Shanksville plane. We'll meet back in a week.

*[One week later]*

**Bob:** Alright Mr. President, here's our idea. We're going to rig the WTC with bombs, and then on September 11 we'll blow the buildings up.

**Bush:** That's good, but the public will never believe somebody could bomb the WTC.

**Bob:** You mean other than when it already happ--

**Bush:** No, we need a cover story. Have hijacked airplanes crash into the buildings, and then blow them up.

**Bob:** ...wait, what? Why are we doing both? The planes and the bombs? Either will be sufficient to knock down the towers, adding both just makes it more complicated.

**Bush:** Bob, I'm running this meeting, so can you just do what I say?

**Bob:** Okay, fine, we rig the towers, the planes hit, then we instantly hit the detonators so the towers collapse on impact.

**Bush:** No, wait a little while. Let the planes hit, then wait a few minutes to blow them up. Wait about an hour, let's say.

**Bob:** Wait an hour so most of the occupants can escape? What the hell is the point of that?

**Bush:** Alright Bob, we've heard enough from you. Jeff, what's the Pentagon plan?

**Jeff:** Well, I liked your plane idea. So we're going to have a hijacked airplane crash into the Pentagon.

**Bush:** No, nobody will believe an airplane made it past our defense systems. Use a cruise missile instead.

**Jeff:** But sir, airplanes fly over DC all the time, it'll be the perfect surprise.

**Bob:** Yeah, how come I have to use airplanes but he doesn't? Shouldn't we be consistent here?

**Bush:** Dammit Bob, simmer down. Jeff, fire a cruise missile at the Pentagon, then plant airplane debris on the front lawn to fake the plane crash.

**Bob:** Instead of faking a plane crash, why not just crash an actual god damn plane?! Isn't that a lot easier?!

**Bush:** Bob, you're testing my patience. Greg, we've come to you. What's the Shanksville plan?

**Greg:** Just as you ordered, sir. A plane gets hijacked, and we shoot it down over Shanksville. The public will be grateful that we stopped what could have been another disaster.

**Bush:** No, they'll be angry we followed accepted military protocol and shot down a civilian plane. Make it look like we tried to shoot it, but failed, and the passengers rebelled and crashed it instead.

**Bob:** I'm not even going to comment on how stupid that is.

**Greg:** Yeah Mr. President, why bother shooting the plane down if we're just going to claim we failed? Why not let it hit some other target?

**Bush:** Moving on. We're going to blame Al Qaida for the attack, and then move in on Afghanistan, who we'll say is harboring bin Laden.

**Bob:** I thought you said we were invading Iraq?

**Bush:** No, first Afghanistan, then a couple years from now we'll do Iraq.

**Bob:** Why not just say the terrorists are from Iraq? We can skip Afghanistan completely. This makes no sense.

**Bush:** Bob, your voice has been heard, now please sit down.

**Bob:** I refuse to be part of this needlessly complicated conspiracy. I'm out. And I assume you'll kill me now since I know too much.

**Bush:** Actually, I'm going to let you and the hundreds of other people involved in this plot live and just hope you don't tell anybody. By the way, I left some important documents about the plan in WTC Building 7. Would anybody mind knocking that one down too? We can just wait for everybody to get out first.

**Bob:** Let me guess, with another hijacked airplane?

**Bush:** No actually, you can just blow that one up with your bombs. Make it look like wreckage fell on it or something.

**Bob:** ...holy shit you're stupid. I'm out.

*[Some time later]*

**Bob:** ...and that's how it happened.

**Loose Change Creators:** Holy crap! We have to tell the public about this!

**Bob:** Are you kidding? This was the most convoluted, inconsistent, needlessly complicated conspiracy I've ever been a part of. Nobody will ever believe this is what actually happened.

**Loose Change Creators:** Nah, we'll just throw together a snappy documentary. People love that shit.

I also posted this in the original thread, but decided to make a separate overall update since the original thread is almost 24 hours old. I will post more screens once I'm sure there's no info that can tie back to our inside disinfo agent. 

----------------------------

BTW,I had one of our disinfo agents go ahead and take the bait. Here's what he's adding people too: 

**drumrolll:**

http://i.imgur.com/rypjF.jpg 

That's right, ""Monsanto Employees"" (ROFL), he's adding people as moderators and approved submitters to those that ""applied"". My theory is this kid was hoping that a bunch of us would jump on this (because we're obviously shills) then he could screenshot the usernames of the approved submitters and moderators as ""proof"" we're all paid shills. 

BTW, really nicely done boys, [the style sheet looks excellent](http://discoatemybaby.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/slow-clap.gif). I especially like the attention to detail on the moderators: 

http://i.imgur.com/Ag14x.png

Really great. Now in one of the screenshots there was a whole thread of ""HR contacts"" and other important contacts. All pretty much using the same phone number. Which I thought was odd. For a couple of different reasons: 

1. Monsanto would have to fill out your W2s. You would already have a contact number of HR 

2. Even Evil Monsanto is going to do a background check before hiring. They are going to want to make sure they are not hiring fellons. 

3. All the numbers lead to one VOIP line. Why would Monsanto HR being using a Skype number? Wouldn't they just use many of the freely available lines at their corporate headquarters, or maybe actually use the corporate headquarters HR phone number: http://jobs.monsanto.com/careers/ ?

~~Now I will applaude you for removing any personal identifying information from Google tied to the main number you listed, you even removed your name from your Amazon store. You really made sure that if anyone googled the phone number you had listed in the forum there, that no-one would be able to find anything through Google that tied back to your real name.~~

~~So sad.~~ 

~~Here's the issue, you didn't think to check Bing. And your name is definitely *not* Rick. It rhymes with ""Noahs Ark"" ;-) and you appear to be in High School. Oh, and you enjoy soccer.~~ 

**Edit: According to the [edit: ok not GoT, whatever] troll shitheads who put this whole thing together, he/she just picked a random number. Apparently, however, not checking to see if that number actually tied back to anyone real. Which it did, and it was a High School kid. I think you should be thankful this whole thing ended before it was actually made public. Some poor high-school kid would be getting death threats from conspiratards otherwise. Bravo, scumbags.**

Now, that's not the only problem. Your other problem is you didn't take two seconds to google who's *actually* in charge of Monsanto's social media. I do like how you went Jews all the way down, all the names are jews (LOL). However, a quick trip to google reveals that the Director of Social Media is not a Jewish man, but an blond Italian looking middle-aged woman: http://northcoastvoices.blogspot.com/2009/08/faces-behind-mr-monsanto.html, you didn't even get the sex right (ROFL).  BTW, the actual head Monsanto's ""Internet Relations"" is not a Jewish woman, it's actually this guy: http://www.linkedin.com/in/glynnyoung?trk=pub-pbmap (ROFL X 2!). 

That's who's *actually* in charge. In fact, searching LinkedIN (which 99% of professionals now-a-days have a LinkedIn profile) finds no reference to a ""Rick Bergmann"" working for Mansanto anywhere. In fact **none** of the people you have listed, actually seem to work for Mansanto. 

Also, feel free to search LinkedIn, but there's not one social media personal named ""Rick Bergmann"" in social media listed on LinkedIn. This scenario is highly unlikely. Considering most people hired to be a Social Media Director, have profiles everywhere. 

TL;DR: You might want to actually take two seconds and check to see at least if your story has *some* facts before trying to bait a bunch of Skeptics. 

So much time spent on the style sheet, so much time setting up your profile to build ""cred"" with /r/conspiratard, and you couldn't be bothered with checking to see if the people you listed, actually work for Mansanto? /facepalm. 


**EDIT** Disinfo agents in the field have just relayed that the stupid high-school students who created this just all deleted their accounts and ran, LOL. 

**EDIT 2** Now the people who put this together have come in here and claimed ""HEY GUIS, LOL, WE WERE JUST TROLLING, FUNNY JOKES, HA HA!"". Of course! Of course it was meant to be a funny troll all along guys!

Ok guys, I need to vent. I'm sorry if I ramble on at points in this post, but I'm pissed &amp; in need to vent to like-minded individuals.

I've pretty much had it with our ever-growing conspiracy theorist culture. I used to have fun with it, reading different ridiculous theories predicated on blind conjecture. The theories in themselves were relatively mild in comparison to the nasty ones that are rampant in conspiracy forums now. (sandy hook ""crisis actors"" , batman shooting,  &amp; most recently, Woolwich.) I just cant be humored by these people &amp; their theories anymore. Being completely devoid of critical thinking is one thing. Most of these people just ignore any &amp; all evidence that conflicts &amp; disproves their preconceived notions. Thats just how they ""critically think."" &amp; that was fine to me, at least up until Sandy Hook. To say that brutally murdered children &amp; teachers were crisis actors was the most disgusting thing I've ever heard become a conspiracy theory. I stopped reading conspiracy forums for months after that because I was so disgusted. 

Now we have the incident in Woolwich, with conspiratards calling the soldier that was decapitated a ""crisis actor."" I just don't know what to say. Their reality has to be a scary place. I find the complete absence of empathy in these people to be even more disconcerting than their lack of logic.

Anyways guys, thanks for reading to those that did. I'll possibly be back in a month or two once this blows over.

A lot of homeowners here have those special angled flag-holders by their front door, the kind whose brace takes four Phillips screws.

1332250227.0	r51bd	My friends has turned into a conspiracy nut, and he's getting worse. What's the best tactic to make him stop?	Goldexer	119	22	120	"One of my friends is 27 years old and he has, during the past 5 years, turned into a conspiracy nut. He's always been a bit of a ""funny guy"" and also very aesthetic. Also his father pretty much left him was a child (he sees him every few years, and he is also a conspiracy nut. he sold all his belongings and quit his job due to the Rapture in 2011). His mother is also a bit of a nut, and he barely has contact with her (which is good).
He spends all his days reading infowars and similar sites, and mixes all conspiracy theories freely.

Most of the time we just change the subject when he makes an outrageous conspiracy theory claim. The few times we have argued about it, and successfully punctured his arguments, he usually turns to some claim about ""All media being owned by government"" or ""all scientists are employed by the big corporations/government"".

One of the funnier conversations we have was about the ""fake"" moon landing. He claimed that he, as a photographer, could see that the photos were faked. I don't remember how it ended but my biggest counter-argument was just that it's impossible to cover something like that up, seeing how many people were involved in the project (i cant even get 1 person to hold a secret, let alone 3,000).

I usually turn to the argument that he is the one with claims that differ from the rest of the world. It's not up to me to back up my claims that something happened, it's up to him to give me plausible scientific evidence for his claims. If i go up to a person and claim that gravity is fake, it's not logical that that person should have to prove it to me. I'm the one with the ""new"" claims, and thus have to prove my point.

I also say that the sources he gives must be plausible and acceptable sources. Someone who has made 100 claims in the past that where totally outrageous and proven wrong doesn't cut it. And something which isn't peer-reviewed doesnt work either.

**My question is:** What is the best way to deal with this if I want him to stop it with all this conspiracy bullshit. I thought it would get better, but it's only gotten worse. I don't just want him to stop around me, I want him to see that what he's reading is total bull."	t5_2r2dd	True

Extra extra bonus points for claiming that, somehow, if they can remain calm while spouting bullshit, their bullshit suddenly becomes true.

Extra extra extra points for claiming that any contrary evidence and the people presenting that evidence are paid shills who are in on it.

Extra extra extra EXTRA points for being the absolute scumbag that claims Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombing were 100% faked with no real victims. Seriously I want to see just ONE of those fuckers with the balls say that to someone who lost a child in those events. You absolute shit stain. God forbid one of those fucks loses a child in a horrible and public manner and someone says that of them. God forbid they are ever of the receiving end of their own disgusting pig behavior.

The other thing that they seem to forget is that NONE of their amazing theories ever fucking pan out. I should have had a chip in my hand and been in a prison camp by 2004 at the latest. Remember how avian flu was a plan to cut the world's population in half, and all it ended up doing was killing like, what, 12 people? On Chinese chicken farms?

It's just like with the anti vaxxers - so comfortable in the disease free world brought about by vaccines that they have the privilege of claiming they're a fucking scam. These conpiracy fucks are so comfortable in the first world, with all the privlege and rights thereof, that the have the luxury of sitting around pretending we're in a police state, when they have NO FUCKING CLUE what a police state is actually like.

The supposed ""conspiracy"" here is that Monsanto (via their government shills) ordered these bees killed off because they were resistant to roundup. The idea presented in the comments is that Monsanto doesn't want plants to be pollinated so that farmers can't recreate their seeds (somehow).

This is ignoring the fact that without pollination, plants will not produce fruits. Without being pollinated, a plant will not produce any crop to be sold.

So the next time you get a lecture from a conspiratard on how Monsanto is destroying agriculture, remember this is a community that doesn't understand the basic biology of plants. "	t5_2r2dd	True

1376361518.0	1k9349	/r/technology is being weird. Like, really.	moor-GAYZ	96	10	87	"So, another post about NSA, and among the top comments there are highly upvoted people who say things that are, like, a bit too weird even for usual reddit. I think.

[Exhibit A:](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1k7qik/the_nsa_is_commandeering_the_internet_technology/cbmbrd3?context=1)

&gt; In a totalitarian state no presence is as damning as a bad presence. I would recommend leaving some presence and pulling some. Figure out what you're most sensitive about or what kind of things you figure would single you out in the coming purge. IMO you need to have a dual life so there is plausible deniability. Sadly there is probably no way to hide your heritage so we have to hope that isn't going to be the next big issue.

[Exhibit B:](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1k7qik/the_nsa_is_commandeering_the_internet_technology/cbm9me7)

&gt; A throwaway account because I'm making a comment. Because of the Snowden confirmations I've drastically reduced the amount of time I spend online at my NSA dumb terminal. I no longer submit comments or links on Reddit opting to lurk only now with a new account. The majority of time I used to spend on the net has been replaced with an offline ereader and books instead. We're not in Kansas anymore. Trust has vanished, never to return.

And another dude [replies](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1k7qik/the_nsa_is_commandeering_the_internet_technology/cbmfk3j?context=1):

&gt; I'm the same way:

&gt; * I no longer have a FB account and I delete my Reddit account every week or two to help keep it anonymous (and to prevent myself from getting wrapped up in karma whoring). 

&gt; * I have a Twitter account, but I no longer use it. Don't delete it just because it's my real name and don't want someone else to grab it. 

&gt; * I no longer talk politics in emails or over the phone. I've already had to tell this to a number of family members and friends who started to talk about such things, telling them I'd prefer to talk about the issues in person.

&gt; * I've deleted some posts of political nature on G+, in hope that that makes them less searchable in the future. I would delete my account, but occasionally use hangout to chat with friends.

&gt; * I leave my cell phone off most of the time. Even though I'm not going anywhere interesting (grocery store, bike ride, etc.), it just feels better to have a little privacy.

&gt; * I no longer am considering buying political books on Amazon. If I want such a book I'll buy it locally with cash (which probably means I won't buy it, because that can be more of a hassle). 

&gt; All in all, anytime I can get around releasing any information about myself I do. Thanks NSA.

And [yet another dude replies](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1k7qik/the_nsa_is_commandeering_the_internet_technology/cbmfy58?context=2) with a long comment, the best part of which is:

&gt; You should talk politics over the phone. Talk about not voting for any Democrats as long as this spying continues. Do this in texts often. The word will filter up. Back up the threat by changing your party affiliation to Republican, even if you have no real intention of ever voting Republican.

--------

I am amused and slightly disappointed that this is all definitely just empty talk, none of these brave revolutionaries (including those who bravely upvoted them) will actually leave reddit, despite the imminent purge."	t5_2r2dd	True

[This](http://i.imgur.com/AgpQ3Td.png0) was in my inbox today after I posted to /r/bipolar about how it can difficult to know when my emotions are 'normal' as opposed to 'irrational'. In my response to this genius, felt = dealt. I kept trying to spell it delt and the phone understood what I meant. /s

It's bad enough that people like him give people like me a bad wrap. It's bad enough that I have to sometimes defend my own illness because so many people think that we're all *that* kind of crazy. But to go so far as to interject between me, my doctor and I, to suggest that what I've experienced my entire life, what I have only recently come to *kind of* understand, what can be a living fucking hell, to suggest that this is a gluten allergy is to tell me that you know more about my illness than I; as if you know who the fuck I am, what the fuck I have to go through almost every day, how people act when they find out I am bipolar. 

Fuck this motherfucker and everyone like him. He's not just retarding progress, he's contributing to a living hell and potential death. Fuck. Him.

EDIT: He's an SSRI conspiratard. Because he knows someone that had a known reaction to an SSRI, something everyone is warned of *every time* they are newly prescribed, *he* knows that they are going to kill everyone who takes them. So yes, he's *as bad* as the antivaxtards.

Their only way to verify anything is to actually seek evidence (the old fashioned way?)

And the increased paranoia makes it look even more like a mental institution.

I just wanted to say a few words to celebrate the victory.
In the words of Hitchens,
""One of the beginnings of human emancipation is the ability to laugh at authority.""

Whether its religious authority or cult-like (in the case of /r/conspiracy) I think this quote certainly applies.

Anyways, where to now?

I hear there's a private party at /r/conspiracyv2 and we're not invited. How dare they.  &gt;:(


EDIT: Figured I'd show you guys the email between myself and the Atheist Experience (I'm sure most of you guys know of the web show):

My message:

&gt; So I stumbled onto some videos by the Prophecy Club.  One of the speakers (Bill Schnoebelen) is an admitted pedophile who believes the following things:

&gt; - Vampires and werewolves exist (claimed he used to be a vampire).
&gt; - If women don't keep their heads covered they'll be raped by aliens.
&gt; - Having anal sex with children gives you access to alternate dimensions (!!!).  What a rationalization, eh?

&gt; Now, guess what else:
&gt; - The Alex Jones Show endorsed him.
&gt; - Kent Hovind also spoke at the same club and about similar topics.

&gt; We did our own little analysis of the video and of the connection between popular conspiracy theorists and fundies.
Video was posted on reddit with my highlights in the top comment.

&gt; Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgZfQCzmw-I

&gt; Timestamps:  http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1c5w64/rconspiracys_new_role_model_the_magic_pedophile/c9dbhlg

&gt; And a few of us were banned from /r/conspiracy (on reddit) when I discovered a moderator supported the guy and everyone started asking him about it.

&gt; And finally, my question!
&gt; I often compare ""Conspiracism"" to religions like Scientology where they gradually introduce their subjects to accept increasingly absurd ideas, until they accept anything coming from a certain source.  Their ""higher OT levels"" (Xenu stuff) include werewolves, vampires, and lizard people.  Should we start considering this its own religion, or basically point out that its a gradual scam like Scientology?  I think doing this may help some people view it more skeptically.

&gt; Anyways, keep up the good work,

&gt; flipcoder



And the reply from Frank of AE TV:



&gt; Howdy,

&gt; Sounds like a great guy, this Schnoebeten.  But, unless this club only invites pedophile, vampire, 
alien believing, anal child rapist, I can't say that Hovind believes all this.  But he is plenty messed
up on his own accord.  Did he get out of jail yet?

&gt; Alex Jones.  Sigh.  Alex used to do his show in the same studio we do ours from.  What Alex
Jones is, he's a fear monger.  He makes his living by scaring people and then selling them vids,
survival crap, and so forth.  And, a fairly good living he makes from it. .  He has made
failed prediction repeatedly, one of the most amusing was his lead up and ultimate humiliation 
during Y2K.  ""The Russians are on their way with nukes"", ""buy my products"".

&gt; So, it appears in every way he is just like a religion.  He uses fear and loathing to keep people 
scared and sending him money.  He makes end time predictions, and he has his followers 
completely hoodwinked no matter how wrong he continually is.  He also has a boogie-man
(the 'government') to scare people with.  

&gt; I have a friend that follows his crap.  When I (continually) bring up how wrong he always is, he 
just brushes it away and ignores it.  Very scary.

&gt; On my way home today, I saw someone with some sort of Alex J. sticker on one side of their
bumper and something about 'Fluoride is poison"" on the other.  They were drinking a &lt;brand name
left out&gt; bottled water.  I started laughing out loud because while I was digging up evidence to show my
conspiracy theory friend that the 'government' wasn't trying to make him stupid by putting 
fluoride in the water, I found out that there is more fluoride in that brand bottled water than in fluoridated
city water.  That person with the bumper sticker would actually get a smaller dose of fluoride by 
drinking the fluoridated Austin city water than by drinking that bottled water.   Dumbass.  He's
probably a theist too (snark).

&gt; Now to your question.  Answer, yes.  But I have to say:  This is the way that we humans act
with most things.  Someone tells you something interesting about a planet and get's you thinking
and reading about the subject, five years later you have a huge telescope and a dome in your 
backyard that you hunt asteroids with.  Just our general process of education works on this
principal.  You advance through levels of learning.

&gt; If anything, conspiracy mongers and theist both tap into this and use it to their advantage.

&gt; Thanks for the nice words.  I'll have a look at your video.  I wanted to comment before I did.

This man is, without question, the worst source of news in the history of the US media-- that is, the worst source of news who has gained any notoriety. If you look up [the stats](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=site+hits+for+infowars.com) for his website, it gets 3.8 million hits a day, and 1.1 million unique visitors.... That is A LOT of angry people.

Now, we know for a 100% fact that Alex Jones is a [compulsive liar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7t0fqD83TI), a complete [scam artist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWPxLzlyOTU), and that he has loads of fans that believe his every word.

On his radio show, he has [called for executing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU5hxTVJrX4&amp;feature=plcp) the perpetrators of the so-called New World Order-- an idea completely manufactured by himself. 

Alex Jones has run for political office before, and is now helping to run a candidate for office, purely based on opposition to fluoride in the drinking water.

Do you see where this is going? Alex Jones is getting close to having enough fans to actually have people win political office.... In fact, he was a major part of promoting Ron Paul and Rand Paul to where they are today. Ron Paul was previously just popular in Texas, but is now a nationwide name.

OK... This is scary. This is just how radical people have come into office in the past. They use a failing economy, and appeal to the stupidest people in society, in order to build a mass movement against the established order--- and no, that doesn't mean the government. It means society. It means you. It means anyone who is perceived to be a supporter of the so-called New World Order.... 

Think of all the people in /r/conspiracy who blame everything on the Jews-- like complete Nazis.... Well, Alex Jones doesn't blame it on the Jews. But, he does blame it on the fluoride, the ""New World Order"", the ""chemtrails"", the ""globalists"". He even names names.... He has said [Bill Gates is worse than Hitler](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B_uZmEhFtM). He blames random professors for being so-called supporters of eugenics.

I really think that this man is dangerous. All it takes is for his stupid fans to shoot a few people, like his fans have been responsible for before. Remember Jared Loughner, the Arizona shooter? Well, [he was a big fan of Alex Jones](http://newsone.com/974095/az-shooter-jared-loughner-was-fan-of-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-movies/).

While I tend to think that most of his fans are just depressed basement dwellers, some of them are very angry, and own guns, and all it takes is for a few of them to start political shootings, and they could start ripping apart the fabric of America, and bring psychopathic behaviour into the mainstream.

I've also heard Alex Jones say that if your friends don't believe in his conspiracy theories, you should probably get some new friends. So, he's trying to build this isolationist, Scientology-style cult-- where people are just sitting around all day, raging about conspiracies, going completely insane, and sprouting completely incorrect things, and actually bringing this all into the real world. It's not just some radio show people laugh at. This becomes their life, and they actually vote for people -- and have their real lives affected -- based upon this conspiracy mindset. I think that's very dangerous-- like a worldwide psychotic group of insane cult members, being given confidence by their leader (Alex Jones) that they are in the right, when in fact, they are completely wrong, and being fed completely false information.

So, maybe I sound like a conspiratard. Maybe not. But I really think Alex Jones is dangerous, and at the very least we should be 100% convinced that he is of no value whatsoever, in terms of information. We have to be 100% certain, with absolutely no hesitation, that he is a compulsive liar, who does not believe what he is saying at all... And at the most, we need to be proactive in trying to destroy this man, politically, emotionally, and financially.

[A list of failed predictions that were * definitely* going to happen]. 	robotevil	93	21	23	"It is well known that /r/Conspiracy is a target rich environment for failed predictions. I noted that I started making a list of these failed predictions in another thread and someone requested I post it. So by request, here's a small sampling. 

Background: Sometimes when r/Conspiracy predicts something is *definitely* going to happen [PROOF]! I'll search and see how many times it's been predicted before. Take for example in this list we have ""Zionist are plotting to end the world"" and ""WAR WITH IRAN ANY DAY NOW!"" (which I swear has been predicted every week for the past 8 years on the Internet). 

Disclaimer: It would be impossible to have only one self post for that tracked all the failed predictions. This would return a document almost as large as /r/Conspiracy itself. That being said, I did want to add to it a bit more first before posting it because one keyword will bring up pages and pages of failed predictions. Eventually, I would like to have a list with a little more variety.  However, someone asked for it, so I'll go ahead and post it here and update the list periodically (until I get to that 3 month editing max, then start a new one).

Anyway, without further ado:

Selected extracts:

*I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks* [**Bay of Pigs**] *may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--for reducing this threat or living with it--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity*.

*This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for far greater public information; and, second, to the need for* **far greater official secrecy**.

---------------------

*I have no intention of establishing a new Office of War Information to govern the flow of news. I am not suggesting any new forms of censorship or new types of security classifications. I have no easy answer to the dilemma that I have posed, and would not seek to impose it if I had one. But I am asking the members of the newspaper profession and the industry in this country to reexamine their own responsibilities, to consider the degree and the nature of the present danger, and to heed the duty of self-restraint which that danger imposes upon us all*.

*Every newspaper now asks itself, with respect to every story: ""Is it news?"" All I suggest is that you add the question: ""Is it in the interest of the national security?"" And I hope that every group in America-unions and businessmen and public officials at every level--will ask the same question of their endeavors, and subject their actions to this same exacting test*.

Also there would be less disease/insect problems when you literally reduce a body to ashes.  

I can't understand why people think that it makes sense the Government would be so carefree/uninhibited about killing it's citizens, but then decide that they should give us all proper burials.

I dismiss this as his attempt to try and change the topic rather than admit he's just attacking jewish people as per usual. Then he posts an interesting story about so called ""Violent attacks on Christians"". Initially he just copied and pasted the article text, so I googled it. It was reported in 2 locations. The Australian and stromfront.org. Now, it's probably a safe bet he doesn't read the Australian so I called him out on where he got his story from and then panic mode set in. He edited the post, added a link and deleted a few of the phrases from the top of the post... text and formatting from the Stormfront thread he got the article from. I wish I would have gotten a screen shot of the before, but there you go folks: Green-light gets his anti-semitic news directly from one of the largest White Power sites on the internet.

We chat before the meeting and discuss economics and politics. He brings up the fact that wages generally have been stagnant for 30 years (not increasing with inflation) while profits have soared. He also notes that this occurred *while* productivity has increased. Seems like a knowledgeable cat with politics similar to mine. After the meeting I chat with him some more and then I realized he was a conspiratard. Here is a summation on how the conversation went. 

**Me**: Oh hai, so I enjoyed what we were talking about. 

**Dude**: You know what the big problem is? Its the jew bankers. They are manipulating the system for their own gain. 

**Me**: Ohhhhh, ok (Im thinking, ah you are crazy). 

**Dude**: Yeah, both Adam Smith and Karl Marx were the first to talk about economics and how it influences people. They were both part of these jewish power groups.

**Me**: Ummm.......

**Dude**: Yeah you know that over the past 400 years there were two countries that sent over political operatives to control the governments at the county level. They did this because if you control the counties, you then control the state, and that means you control the federal government. 

**Me**: What two countries were they.

**Dude**: Scotland and Wales. 

**Me**: Oh, I am of Scottish ancestry. 

**Dude**: *gives me the stare of death* Oh, well I have German ancestry so I cant be a part of that secret group.

[A reminder that the government is actually run by the Illuminati.](http://i.imgur.com/IZoNshD.jpg)  Also corporations are their robotic patsies.

[Drills = state sponsored terrorism.](http://i.imgur.com/Iw5EHqc.jpg)  That's a mathematical fact (didn't you see the equals sign?).

[Another reminder that law enforcement agencies *never* run drills, brought to you by Satan.](http://i.imgur.com/ywxZyPn.jpg)  I especially like the implication that all terrorist attacks are caused by the government.

[A grand summary of Boston.](http://imgur.com/a/Nx8EU)  I know its old, but its notable for containing all of the crazy in one place.

[More Illerminaughty.](http://imgur.com/a/1sGZa)  ""I think I recognized a guy in a car with tinted windows from behind; therefore he is exactly who I think he is.""

[New me-me: le government censorship face](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2714/4037817972_acde8da830.jpg) (sorry for shitposting).  I'm disappointed they didn't work the nazi symbol in there somewhere.

[Democracy don't real.](http://i.imgur.com/fWsa2JR.jpg)  This truck told me, so it must be true!

[The Syrian Army has literally never killed civilians.](http://i.imgur.com/XCSm1gR.png)  Also they hate joos, so they have to be the good guys.

[Does it feel a little euphoric in here, or is it just this guy?](http://i.imgur.com/606vaSw.jpg)

[A video was taken down from YouTube?](http://i.imgur.com/6tfR2Ov.jpg)  This literally never happens.  It must be the government!

[A combination of two conspiratard favorites, chemtrails and flouride.](http://i.imgur.com/Se5zthH.jpg)  It even manages to mix in mind control.  

[The government is using printer stenography to track literally everything you print.](http://i.imgur.com/IKYwCws.jpg)  No that doesn't sound like it would be insanely expensive, horribly impractical, and nearly impossible.  Why do you ask?

[The irony.](http://i.imgur.com/RjUc1Iu.jpg)  It hurts.

[Finally, an example of paralyzing paranoia in image macro form.](http://i.imgur.com/ciOXplM.jpg)  This type of post is not uncommon (second I've seen this week).  A lot of people there need help; the sad thing is most would probably just reject it."	t5_2r2dd	True

Synthcraft92	74	13	53	"Been posting a few things here and there for a few weeks now, but I wanted to share this because it's what really got me loathing and laughing at conspiracy theories and the people behind them. I hope you read this; you may be entertained.

In October 2011, I, along with a dozen other students in the political club we were in at my college, decided to take a trip to NYC and check out what was going on in regards to the Occupy movement. We were greeted to the smells of what you would expect from Coachella, and the sights of what you would see from a fever dream of political ideologies coming together in one big orgy. A noble overarching cause, mind you, and I was personally intrigued by the coordination and cooperation between these different groups. Grassroots actions like this take time, and to see it all come together was glorious. Inspired, we traveled back the two hours or so north of the city, and decided to hold a rally in solidarity of the individuals protesting down in Wall Street. I was pumped, because as a politically and socially active guy myself, it seemed like the best thing I could do was get involved in some way. So, on October 15th, our idealistic selves went to the busiest part of this city of 30,000 people, and began chanting and holding up signs. The signs weren't specific for the most part; while mine was something along the lines of ending Citizens United, others were about ""occupying love"" and ""finding truth"". You know, that New Age shit we all just love *so* much.

We reconvened at a small park (which I later learned is a known drug park) and one of my fellow students decided we should occupy full-time, and begin our own occupation. Sparing meticulous details, we ended up getting into it. I slept that weekend, a few days later, and was addicted. Addicted to the rush that protest brings. Addicted to the feeling of community and that microcosm of society that exists in this little square of an urban park. So here I was, living my life and sleeping in a fucking drug park. In the hood. *In the 3rd most dangerous place in New York.*

The community was confused at first, but supported us, and from the outside, it was [actually tightly run](https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/331547_2666441012771_561323914_o.jpg), and had a clear message that I attempted to sum up to as many people as I could, as one of the unofficial ""leaders"" of the group.  I even helped coordinate a rally with MoveOn (a group that the nuts distrusted as part of the evil system) and got around 250 people to show up for a rally that had a specific message and purpose. But we were intense. **Really intense.** It went from Citizens United to paranoia in about two weeks; I assumed police had bugged our tents that we propped up, and urged everyone to look around every morning to find little microphones or devices placed nearby. Perhaps we were indirectly inspired by a heroin-addicted, self-described ""Catholic communalist"" and his band of heroin junkie anarchists, who became more mentally insane and dependent as the days went on. Let's call this guy P. P ended up telling me his life story: How he and his posse meditated for months at a monastery some few dozen miles away, how he was mooching from house to house but seeing it as giving back with his presence and spirit. Basically, he was in denial. Some of his more specific views:

* People who own any form of technology are sheep to the system
* The system exists because we let it exist with our thoughts
* Truth can be found by seeking truth which is sought by first accepting truth
* Women and black people are below Irish Catholics

This guy managed to influence quite a few people. One guy, R, was probably the most annoying fucker of them all. He spouted, non-stop, ""Please wake up!"" every morning to commuters going to work, and believed in chemtrails, HAARP, reptilians, ancient aliens, the works. And this guy was someone I went to school with, who seemed and acted COMPLETELY NORMAL. Soon the predominantly center-left fiscal political views of this local branch of the movement became a centerpiece for conspiracism, paranoia, drug hustling, and mistrust. I myself really got into some hard drugs, but stopped it before it became a major habit. In the end, after 53 days of sleeping at this park, after 53 days of eating nothing but vegan and vegetarian food from a group of super liberal Quakers, mooching off people and friends' families, after giving interviews to radio and blogs, and traditional media, we ended up getting evicted. But at that point, I was well away from it. I had grown disillusioned, and I had, for the first time in my short life, witnessed the taint that the fringe successfully instills in EVERY un-organized political movement. 

What I learned from this, and what I believe many of us realize after spending time here and in person with conspiracists, are three things: Drugs are always around in conspiracy circles, many conspiracy theorists have elements of paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by said drugs, and mistrust is often due to personal problems and failures (school grades, fired from a job, rough family life). People deal with these things in certain ways.

Ask questions if you want more specifics about this time and what I saw, because there's a LOT that I remember vividly that needs to be let out."	t5_2r2dd	True

1354344744.0	143f3j	The guy at the table next to me at dinner tonight...	RiseAM	71	8	27	"..went on a massive, rambling, illogical rant. And I don't mean under his breath, he was practically yelling at some points. Apparently Obama bought the election victory with the help of massive electoral fraud, including somehow conjuring a hurricane that allowed him to gain all those New England electoral points that he wouldn't have had before. He was also in collusion with the Red Cross to actually help the victims of a natural disaster... all so they would vote for him. Trucks helping from other states and the Red Cross giving people food in a natural disaster is an outrage, or so I hear. The entire Democratic party is completely corrupt, you will never see another honest Democrat run for office again, because ""They are an entire party built upon taking advantage of the benefits that immigrants and blacks enjoy in today's society."" Somehow he blamed that on 9/11, and then shit started to get real... No, Bush didn't plan it this time. It was the Democrats and foreign liberals, in collusion with Al Qaeda, and they did it to make Bush appear weak in office, and to gain advantages for the minorities... somehow. Because they are totally being advantaged by being discriminately singled out for extra searches and stuff. But they are also the ones to blame for creating a totalitarian, ""Nazi"" government that was too invasive into people's privacy... I don't really know where he was going from there, because they got up to leave at the insistence of his poor wife... I think she was mortified as she kept trying to change the subject, but he was on a roll.

Abso-fucking-loutely hilarious if it wasn't sort of sad, I really wish I had a video camera, but dinner table manners and whatnot. My family actually abandoned our previous conversation (about which of the 13 dwarves in the upcoming Hobbit movie had the most sex appeal), and we all started laughing at various comments and making snide remarks to eachother softly... So whoever he was , I thank him for the most fun family dinner I've had in at least the past year.

Just had to share that experience with someone, especially with a conspiracy twist I haven't had the displeasure to run into yet. It was too good to keep to myself."	t5_2r2dd	True

1360397356.0	186nqr	Opinion: On Alex Jones	Nemesis6	74	20	41	"I've been wondering about this for a while now: Why do people take Alex Jones seriously? A very basic question, but still...

Before I frequented this subreddit and started reading about conspiracy theorists like David Icke and Alex Jones, it was plain as day to me that they were wrong, and that was before I saw videos like ""123 Alex Jones lies"" and actually tried watching their videos.

What I don't get is this: Are people unaware of just how crazy they are? One thing that's tossed around here is how Alex Jones for example believes that the silver lining in juice boxes is a government plot to make people gay. That alone should disqualify any thinking individual from taking anything he says seriously, and if people listen to his show, they've heard that and probably a thousand more crazy things like it, and yet he maintains a following.

Here's another angle: Have a look at the recent Piers Morgan interview. To me it's just so cringe-worthy to watch; the man is clearly incapable or unwilling to engage in actual debate, as is evident when he stoops so far as to make fun of the interviewer's accent. I found out that Alex Jones has recently participated/joined demonstrations against Piers Morgan, too. To me, behavior like this paints a picture of a narcissistic, megalomaniacal charlatan; He lies readily, and is often called out, yet makes money off of said lies and the rhetoric with which he employs it by selling survivalist-oriented products, etc. He is incapable of admitting being wrong, and all his material is employed with a classic fear-mongering narrative. This last thing is perhaps the most ironic aspect of his shtick: He talks about the government doing this, and he does exactly the same, all the time.

After a while, or rather, after trying to put all these pieces together and get some sort of overview, I've come to what might seem like a facetious opinion, but one that I believe is accurate: He is doing this for the money. Even if he believes what he spews out, if I were him I would not be able to stand the cognitive dissonance, knowing that people have pointed out all that I've mentioned above, but I guess I'm projecting a bit here.

What do you guys think? Is it a money-shtick or does he genuinely believe it?"	t5_2r2dd	True

Hello all. I've followed this subreddit but I never posted here before. In fact I've never posted any links before to any subreddit, so here goes.

I've often gone over to ATS (those guys love their pointless acronyms after all), and noted that there seems to be a general increase in the number of meat-headed right wing christian fundamentalists over there. A cursory glance at Godlike Productions and David Icke's forum reveal similar populations of 'bibletards', so perhaps this is an increasing phenomenon globally. Who knows.

Being Scottish myself I am proud of our progressive government, especially in ignoring the bullying pressure from the Catholic church here. However Above Top Secret doesn't share my enthusiasm. For such a 'turned on' bunch of 'true intellectuals' who 'question everything' they sure have some dark ages attitudes. I've picked out some pithy quotes for y'all.

&gt; Oh thats good. The men in Scotland have been wearing skirts for hundreds of years. Now they don't have to be in the closet anymore.

A tad insensitive to Scottish culture. Maybe this guy was a Campbell in his former life.

&gt; You aren't allowed to express a differing opinion. The Homos are determined to bully anyone who has a view other than their own. It is absolutely sickening to see the disgusting and unnatural acts these people commit be legalised.

It are a conspiracy!

&gt; I find your desire to force your unnatural lifestyle and mental health issues into everyones face to be hate speech.

Homosexuality is a mental illness! Deny ignorance!!

&gt; Thankfully the majority of people find homosexuality to be repuslive and disgusting as it is. 

Deny ignorance!

&gt; Same sex marriage is an abomination and an offense to decent society. Argue all you want but keep what I have written in mind.

Ron Paul!!

&gt; I can't believe people even believe there's such a thing as homosexuals, it's a lifestyle and a big joke.

Wake up sheeple!

&gt; maybe you should do some reading up on GORDON HAMILTON who massacred school children not so long ago see who signed his gun licence or holly greig thats our glorious leaders all a bunch of pedos

I lived in Dunblane and was in the school when Thomas (not Gordon) Hamilton killed those kids. I hate anybody who tries to stir up a conspiracy here and not let us move on from that bleak affair.  But wait... there is more...

&gt; god made adam &amp; eve not bob &amp; steve this is sick sold out by a bunch of liberals .people should look up the HOLLY GREIG case this is the kind of SCUM who lead us protecting pedophiles in power .when the queen swore her oath to protect GODS laws in 1953 she put her hand on a 1611 copy of kjv bible that states that all queers /rapists / murderers be put to death she is guilty of treason .send them to iran see how long they last . sick totally sick.

Jeez....

&gt; Scottish men wear skirts which is why they are allowing immoral acts to be legalised.

Deny ignorance. Wake up sheeple.... I'm losing the will here...

Its amazing how little of this is getting moderated given the blatant racism and homophobia in this thread. I'm always surprised by the jingoist hate speech that is allowed on Above Top Secret with out any moderation given some of the stuff the mods actually take offence at."	t5_2r2dd	True

It would be far more efficient since the chems would be concentrated both at ground level (rather than 35,000 feet up) and in areas where people actually live (rather than sprayed indiscriminately over oceans, forests, deserts, etc.). 

If the chemicals actually are sprayed out of big tanks on the airplane, it seems it would be a lot easier to instead build some industrial looking building in the industrial part of town that secretly sprays out the chemicals out of the smoke stack. [Make it look like this and no one will know the difference](http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/dam/public/safety/notification/Markets/Spotlight/Industrial.jpg)
