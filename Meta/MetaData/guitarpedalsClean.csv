I know I can buy kits that would help, but would that be the easiest method? Should I just dive in head first, or would it be better to have an understanding of how everything works before attempting anything? [This site](http://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2007/07/15/identifying-electronic-components/) was pretty helpful, but I still feel like I don't know anything about *why* resistors are color coded/what that indicates, the difference between a resistor and a variable resistor, etc. 
Is that information even necessary to know? Where is the best place for a complete beginner to find this information?

I am a film studies major, with absolutely 0 knowledge of any of this stuff, but it is so incredibly fascinating to me that I want to become an expert. I want to be able to fix my own pedals, and to know how the circuit board of a delay pedal differs from that of a fuzz pedal. Eventually I want to create my own pedal, but I don't know if that is even really possible since I would essentially have to build the circuit board myself, right?

The guitar shown is a Fender American Standard (I use a few others) and the chain goes as follows. 
Guitar into a  Boss NS2, in the NS2's loop is a Boss MT2 for texture on my tele, and an Ibanez TS7. All of that runs from the out of the NS2 into an a/b/y box that splits into the two amps shown (an Orange Micro Terror and a Blackstar HT5R) which I use separately or together depending on my mood. The a/b/y box makes for some interesting tones and fun when you consider that there is no effects loop in the Micro Terror. I play around a lot with wet/dry mixes as a result.  
In the Blackstar's effects loop is the Boss BF2, into an Ibanez ES2, into the Cathedral Reverb, into the Line 6 DL4, and lastly into the Nano Doctor Q.

I don't have many other guitar pedal addict friends, so here I am looking to share my latest incarnation. I play in a blues rock duo, so being the only guitar player i needed a fast way to switch between multiple gain stages: enter the Octaswitch. Its a one touch programable effects looper with 8 loops. My chain goes as follows:

Fender '61 Thinskin,
Thomas Organ Crybaby
Octaswitch Input,
Loop1 - MXR DynaComp
Loop2 - Keeley Modded BD-2
Loop3 - Fulltone Fulldrive 2
Loop4 - Fulltone OCD + MXR DynaComp
Loop5 - Fulltone '70 (Big Box)
Loop6 - Way Huge Swollen Pickle
Loop7 - Pickle + DynaComp
Loop8 - Boss TU-3
Octaswitch Output,
Electro-Harmonix Pulsar,
TC Electronics Flashback,
Boss RC-3,
Fender Blues Deluxe.

The OD's and fuzzes are ordered from least gain to highest, the entire board is powered by a DC Brick and one additional chained 9V wart (New isolated power is next up on the wishlist). Wired with Planet Waves American Stage and Planet wave pedal patches, with some additional Hosa 3 foot patches.

Let me know if you have any opinions on different wiring or ordering, I would love some feedback! Also let me know if you have and questions about individual pedals!

1370545094.0	1ft4ri	R.I.P. My Little Green Friend: DL4	pharmacybear	30	9	15	"Reality is sad, sad indeed.  Sad, because I'm about to blog about my sense of loss over material possessions.  Sad, because you're going to read this pathetic post.  But what's most sad, is my long lived Line 6 DL4 has kicked the bucket.  That big green echo monster was my baby, I've had it for 9+ years now.  There are many magic spaceship delays out there right now, and I'm sure there are some that make glitter and unicorns shoot out of your guitar's headstock, but the DL4 was my favorite delay. 

I remember getting into guitar gadgets when I was a meaty, sweaty, angsty high school kid.  This mysterious emerald device kept showing up on pedalboards of my favorite guitarists.

Aaron Pill of The Appleseed Cast.  One of my favorite guitarists.
This photo's pretty damn old too.
I probably watched hundreds of YouTube videos about the pedal.  I had to have it...so the antagonizing began.  I was relentless and I never stopped talking my mother into buying it for me.  After over a year of unsuccessful murder attempts my mom plotted against me, she finally had to cave.  On Christmas morn, the glorious DL4 became mine.  Oh the delight I had in twirling its knobs, making whale sounds, and creating god awful feedback!  I used it in every band I've ever played in.  At one point (during a heavy Minus the Bear phase) I had borrowed a second one and had both on my board.

No.  The DL4 does not have the best sounding delay, nor the best features, and there are little annoyances (like the ever-so-common volume drop issue).  I love my DM3, Moog 104M, and I loved my DMM (before Howard Davis f*&amp;#ed me over).  But like these other famous units, nothing else sounds quite like it.  It's not a pristine clean sounding digital delay, it has some quirks.  However, I've had phases where I just flat out didn't want to use it anymore because it was ""outdated"", I didn't have the $$$ to mod it, or other various pathetic excuses.  The Line 6 M series spaceships came out, promising all of the features of the DL4 but better!  I quickly acquired these devices, hoping they'd knock my DL4 out of the park and provide me with more shit I didn't need.  I've bought and sold both the M13 and M9 on at least two occasions.  They just didn't sound right to me.  They were ""too perfect"".  The Reverse and Auto Volume didn't sound right, and the new M Series Analog Delay setting didn't sound as dark as my DL4.  The Eventide and Strymon fads have come, and will go.  I've considered ""upgrading"" on multiple occasions.  Prior to my current debacle, these new units never really offered more realistically usable features than the DL4 did.  

My DL4 had burnt out once previously.  I used it for 8 years, then randomly it farted out last year.  The local prick who fixed it says I was using a ""questionable means"" to power it (One Spot + L6 Adapter = questionable?  Probably not).  $80 repair.  Pretty hefty cost since you can get them secondhand for well under $150 now.  But hey, it has sentimental value.  A couple weeks ago, I decided to bust it out again.  Plugged it in.  Lights came on.  Abnormally flashed a few times.  Then nothing.  I tried different cables.  I double checked the owners manual to my new power supply I've bought since the last burnout.  I tried a different power supply.  Nothing.  I've read on all the forums about static under the chip, hard resets, yada yada.  I've tried it all, it's toast.  I'm well beyond my warranty on it.  Another $80 doesn't sound too appealing.  So I feel like it's time to retire it.  (Unless someone wants to fix it up free :D  )  

Now I'm in a weird situation I haven't been in for years, what's going to replace it?  Not sure I want a second one yet.  It's like being single after a long relationship, except the end result will have less Crabs.


R.I.P. my little green friend.

I didn't even realize this was a sub. I built this board about 6 or 7 years ago and haven't moved away from it since.

[Picture of the pedal board.](http://i.imgur.com/ec3lohO.jpg)

I play guitar mainly by myself (no band) so I wanted to find a way to add some ""depth"" to my playing. So what I've built is a David Gilmour inspired pedal board.

The idea is that I use left side of the board to do volume swells while I use the right side of the board to solo over the swells, a la Pink Floyd's, ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"".

So what I've got is a Morley A/B switch separating two pedal setups. I can play them independently or together.

The ""Left"" side runs: Morley A/B Switch &gt; Ernie Ball Stereo Volume Pedal &gt; Boss DD-6 Delay &gt; Boss BF-2 Flanger &gt; Amp

The ""Right"" side runs: Morley A/B switch &gt; Dunlop Crybaby Wah &gt; Boss DD-3 Delay &gt; Rocktron Rampage Distortion &gt; Amp

Also on the pedal board is the foot switch channel selector for my amp, a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, to allow ""Clean"", ""Drive"" or ""More Drive"" on both channels.

Like I said before, I've been playing with this board for years and I really enjoy it. I plan on adding a looper pedal some time soon. I'm not sure if I'll add on to the ""right"" side or if I'll finally abandon the whole ""left side, right side"" idea altogether.

First post here and it's a repost. Not a great start at all, but I've got a question I've been meaning to ask people who know what they are talking about, so I think it'll be worth it.

Could you recommend any online retailers or stores that offer international shipping (or at least ship to Europe) and sell effects pedals / DIY kits?

I've got a small pedalboard that I'd like to expand some time in the future. There are a number of music shops in my country, but there is little to no variety in their selection of guitar effects pedals and the pedals themselves rarely come cheap. That's why I'm looking for other options. I know that I can always check out eBay, but I'd really like to see if there's anything else out there before I make my first eBay purchase.

My text from youtube:
This is a comparison of these two power supplies with various noisy pedals.  I tracked the max volume in my sound editor and have the following results.

The numbers represent the max volume during the wave recording.  These numbers are all negative numbers so the closer to zero they are, the louder (worse) they are.

          PP2   Brick
nothing          -53.2 -48

CS3              -35.3 -34.6

CS3+TS9      -25.6 -25.6

+wah            -10.1  -15

dyna/bd2       -20    -18.8

dyna/ts9        -23    -22.4

dyna/sd1       -5.7   -6.8

dyna/fz5        -7.2   -5.8

dyna/ds1      -28.8  -30.1

dyna/keeley -13.7   -11.2

+wah            -3.6   -5.0

all                -2.1    -2.2

In general, they were pretty close.  The PP2+ won with most of the settings but the brick won whenever the wah was engaged.

No, I would never have this many pedals on at once, I just wanted to see for myself whether there was a clear difference in the sound before picking one.  I think the PP2+ wins, but probably not enough to justify the higher price (they tend to go for ~40 more on Ebay).

I used the Y splitter cables only because I needed them to power my pedals so I wanted them in on the comparison.

One more thing... all the noises are generated using the bridge pickup in single coil mode with the tone at 10 (trying to get as much noise as possible).

I did this for my own peace of mind to make sure I was selecting the right unit.  If it helps someone else, great."	t5_2r0bp	True

With only one razor cut on my hand I put together my new pedalboard, and I gotta say it sounds amazing! I have in the past had giant pedalboards and it feels great to switch to something like this. I'm sure plenty would say that this board is still rather complicated, but I planned this out to have a ton of sounds if I want them, but I can also play in a rather straightforward fashion and still sound good.

The signal flow is, Strymon Ob.1 Compressor -&gt; Z Vex Mastotron -&gt; Whammy IV -&gt; Strymon Mobius -&gt; BOSS DD-5 -&gt; Strymon Timeline -&gt; Strymon Bluesky Reverb. The boss is mostly there for the hold function which I love, and the expression pedal and be used on both the timeline and the mobius simultaneously. It's put together with George Ls and is powered by a Voodoo Labs 4x4. The board itself is a Pedaltrain 2.

*  The pedals came in the mail extremely fast. I think it took at most four business days from order to arrival at my door.

* Of the five pedals ordered (Joyo's vintage overdrive, 6 band EQ, Octave Fuzz, flanger and equalizer) two of them were replaced with pedals I hadn't ordered (vintage overdrive and flanger were replaced by ultimate drive and california sound)

* The pedals themselves are pretty decent. Of the five I tried, I WOULD recommend the Ultimate Drive (if you're into heavier overdrive/distortion tones), California Sound (Mesa Boogie Mark IV emulator) and 6 band EQ (feels like it's built to last unlike some Behringer counterpart, plus the LED's are awesome) but the Voodoo Octave is lacking in its ""octave"" function and cuts away a lot of low end and the compressor definitely has its issues as well.

I hear it has a 'auto-riff' setting that you can edit a different sequence for each note on the fretboard. for some reason Boss hasn't made a stand-alone unit for this effect. Has anyone had a similar quest and tried one or even two of these options to compare them? The qualifiers for a different selection are:
a)ability to set a scale

I built this board last year sometime, it's a suitcase design and it closes with nothing exposed. Made of solid pine and some cheap latches, a handle, and a long hinge I bought at the local hardware store. I gig a lot, so I wanted something I could just open, plug in and play. The pedals (besides the dl4 and the whammy) are powered by a daisy chain that is stapled to the bottom so there are no lose wires piled everywhere. The adapters are permanently plugged into a power bar that (like the pedals) is held down with industrial strength velcro. 
Sometimes I switch up the order, but this is where it's at now:

Fuzz factory -&gt; vox wah -&gt; whammy -&gt; tuner -&gt; super overdrive -&gt; dl4 -&gt; small clone -&gt; small stone -&gt; A/B switch that goes into a Marshall avt 275 and a fender hot rod deluxe.

The only new pedals for me are the JHS Mini Foot Fuzz and the Wampler Ego compressor (replaced my Keeley comp), so this project was mostly just making all of the cables and wiring everything up to my true bypass looper.


Here's the rundown:


**This1smyne 8-loop true bypass looper with the following:**

* TC Electronics Polytune Mini
* Wampler Ego compressor
* JHS Mini Foot Fuzz
* Mad Professor Little Green Wonder
* Caroline Wave Cannon
* Wampler Ecstasy
* JHS Morning Glory (likely going to be replaced with a JHS Superbolt soon)
* Paul C Timmy

**After the looper comes:**

* T1M buffer (under the board)
* Ernie Ball volume pedal
* Strymon Ola
* Empress tremolo
* Strymon Timeline (with a T1M mini expression knob)
* Strymon BlueSky


The board is a Pedaltrain 3 and everything is powered with a pair of CIOKS DC-10's. All of the cables going into and out of the looper are from the Lava solder-free cable kit and then there a few Mogami cables connecting the rest.


One cool feature is that I have a little patchbay box (yet another piece made by T1M) that comes after the volume pedal, so I can easily run the modulation+delay+reverb part of the chain through an effects loop without having to rewire anything."	t5_2r0bp	True

The board is nice but nothing unique, it's a Pedaltrain PT-2 powered by a Voodoo Labs Pedal Power 2. The signal chain goes: Boss TU-2 tuner, Dunlop Crybaby through a Loopmaster mini looper (not shown, this was added after the photo was taken), MXR Dynacomp, Fulltone OCD, and Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer. The effects loop goes: Danelectro Cool Cat Tremolo, GFS Classic Chorus, Hardwire DL-8 delay/looper. I use a Radial Twin Cities buffered ABY pedal to split my signal to two amps; one amp runs dry and one wet for stereo effects.

I like the looper for the wah pedal, not necessarily for true bypass, but more for a surefire way of engaging the wah and having a bright LED telling me that it's engaged or not. I really hate the wah pedal's mechanism for engaging, and also really hate that it doesn't have an indicator LED. I know there are other wah pedals that have LEDs and nicer on/off switches, but they are all pretty expensive; my Loopmaster mini looper was only $40.

I like the stacked overdrives. I use a pair of Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amps for stereo,  but only the clean channel. The OCD with volume dimed and drive off gives me the crunch boost for rhythms (in fact, the OCD is almost always on, for cleans I just dial the volume pot on my guitar back), while the TS-9 has drive set to about 12 o'clock and is used as a lead boost. 

One thing I would like to eventually upgrade is the tremolo pedal, I got the Danelectro because it was cheap and there is one song where I need a tremolo effect. I'd like to get one with a tap tempo, but those are usually pretty expensive."	t5_2r0bp	True

I'm looking for a pedal that I can put next to the Whammy that will take both outputs, and let me mute them one at a time. Bonus points if it will let me re-route either input to either output, but I think that's probably a stretch. Is there something pre-made that can do this, or alternatively does somebody make pre-made 1590LB-sized killswitches for cheap? I can only seem to find pedals that will take one input and route it to outputs A, B, or A&amp;B. 

Here's a rough diagram of what I want: http://i.imgur.com/nROIuz2.gif

Recently, I've picked up playing the guitar again mostly due to playing with the effects in Jamup Pro on my iPhone. I've got my dad's old '54 Danelectro with piano strings plugged into it via a Peavey AmpKit and have been happily jamming away with headphones.

When I was in Guitar Center to get the AmpKit and some picks (had a gift card) I played around with some of the hardware, and left wanting either an EHX Electric Mistress or a Rat2. Poking around review sites / YouTube now has me considering the EMX Tone Tattoo as while I love the sound of the EM, I'm not that good with the guitar and probably wouldn't get as much out of it.

Most of the appeal of the Tone Tattoo to me is that it's all analog, and sitting downstairs on the couch with one pedal in front of me is going to appeal to Mrs. Drelbs much more than a handful of boxes and wires (which I'm supposed to keep confined to our study upstairs.) I'm also looking at getting a practice amp for jam sessions (my wife sings, plays the piano and other instruments. Our daughter plays various things on ""her"" iPad...)

Do you guys think this would be a decent pedal for a novice guitar player start off with? Or should I just stick to using my iPhone and Jamup Pro until I get a bit better (or at least an amp? At the very least a pedal could live off the FX Send on my mixer panel upstairs...)

For reference, I play shoegaze, post-rock, ambient, alt-rock, indie, stoner metal, and sludge metal (CP Jazzmaster, Tele, and Les Paul copy through a Hot Rod Deluxe as a setup). The OD would primarily be used for the first five, but bonus points for being usable in the second two."	t5_2r0bp	True

The advantage would be that I can map (and remap) everything on my board exactly the way I want to have it, but always have the exact same connections to make in the back. I also won't have to worry about pedal placement, so the beginning and end of my loop would have their connectors free to plug and unplug a cable.

So my questions:

1. Would this degrade signal quality noticably?

2. Has anyone done this before? Can you share your experience?

3. (Related, but only barely) what plugs do you guys use on your pedal board to interconnect pedals? Ideally, I'd use all Neutrik gold-plated connectors, but that would run me â¬180 on connectors alone, which is a bit steep imo."	t5_2r0bp	True

I don't think it came out too bad considering it's my first DIY anything; and being that it's my first DIY anything, everything was hand sawed, hand drilled, hand screwed. Actually I'm quite pleased with the outcome and though blood was shed, I have a very warm, fuzzy, happy feeling inside of me right now... :p

Cut myself with the saw three times and got a splinter once during the duration of the project (2 days since I started last night).

I'm pretty much done, all I need to do is spray paint and coat it.

Everything is cut pretty straight considering I cut it by hand and had to constantly make sure I was cutting along the line I drew.

Anyone have any suggestions on what I should do with the electric tape? I put an explanation of why I put it there, but I don't think I should keep it on for the painting and coating process... right?

Does anyone here have hands-on experience? I'd be using this for guitar *and* bass.

edit: The Barnacle Fuzz had also been brought to my attention, any thoughts thereof? It looks enticing..."	t5_2r0bp	True

1370477560.0	1fra5l	Help picking a compressor?	resurrection_man	9	1	32	"I'm trying to decide on a compressor. It would be mostly used for clean or almost clean playing. The main genres would be post-rock and ambient, as well as some alt-country, singer-songwriter stuff like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zTFIz2plU), and shoegaze (also stoner/doom/psychadelic, but I don't see using a comp for those.) My guitars are a Fender CP Jazzmaster, Squier CV Tele, Epiphone Sheraton II, and Gibson SG Standard, and I'm running through a Hot Rod Deluxe (if any of that makes a difference.)

I don't mind a pedal that adds some top end, but I want something quiet and on the more transparent end.

My ideas right now:

1. Xotic SP Compressor (~$130)- I like the idea of a blend control and the small shape, not to mention the price.

2. Barber Tone Press ($160) - Parallel comp similar to the SP. Again the blend control is nice, and it seems that having better control over the sustain puts it over the  SP. 

3. Walrus Audio Deep Six ($200) - Mostly because I have their Mayflower OD and it's the best pedal on my board, so I have faith in their craftsmanship. But I haven't really heard much buzz about it.

4. Strymon OB.1 ($200) - Again the company has a great reputation, but for pedals other than the compressor. Nice for also being a clean boost.

5. Diamond Compressor (~$210) - People seem to throw this around a lot as a great compressor. EQ seems like a good control to have. Also, [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GubWX0lejwY) uses one and I really dig his tone.

Budget-wise, the Diamond is really the top end of what I want to spend (so a Keeley 4 knob is out). Unfortunately, all the shops in my area have a shit selection so I'm going off of videos, reviews, and internet word of mouth. 

Anyone have experience with these pedals and  a suggestion of which one I should go for? Or is there something else I should be looking at?

EDIT: Given the endorsements people were giving the Keeley, I decided to check eBay, and lo and behold, someone was selling a used 4 knob for $180. At that price, it seemed like a no-brainer, so I went for it. Thanks for the advice!"	t5_2r0bp	True

1374595321.0	1iw2sv	Adding a volume pot to Ibanez WH10v2 Wah	Antijawa	8	1	7	"So i'm looking forward to the upcoming weekend as i've decided my ver first attempt at any type of pedal modding is going to be adding a volume pot to my WH10v2 wah.  Any of you familiar with this pedal will understand why as it has a very loud volume boost when engaged, apparently depth=more db with this pedal but i'm sick of having to dial back the depth to compensate for the boost.  So on to the good stuff, i'm actually looking at gutting out the dry out components as I don't use it at all, and then install the pot there, poking out of the dryout hole on the side.
So where to start, I have heard 100k pots are pretty much the standard for doing this, so i'll likely pick that up friday.  Now, before I go into my humble theory/plan of action for you guys to review/critic, here is the schematics for said pedal:

[WH10v2 Schematics](http://www.dirk-hendrik.com/temp/wh10_v2.pdf)

So the new pot will have 3 lugs, lug 1 goes to ground, lug 3 will go to the tip of the output jack, and lug 2 would go to the last component before the output jack? (lug 2 is what throws me off)  So if that is true, would that mean lug 2 would go to the R30 before the output jack, effectivly bypassing the signal through the new pot to the output?  Luckily I have a friend who will help me out and is generally good with these things for the hands on portion, but I want to make sure i don't screw up to badly.

so to recap my questions:
where do I make my connections for the lugs? (see schematic)
Will gutting out the dry components have any negative effect?
Anything else I should know?

I really appreciate if anyone familiar with this would be willing to chime in and share their wisdom with me!"	t5_2r0bp	True

This is the first compressor I've ever owned and I don't have too much experience with them. I've watched hours of video on YouTube of various Dyna Comps and other compressor pedals, so I have a good idea what it should sound like.

When I play with the pedal activated, almost every note I play is squashed down so much that it is inaudible, then the volume slowly rises back to unison. I understand that what I'm describing is the essence of what a Dyna Comp should do, but it seems like the effect is really extreme. The beginning of every note or chord I play is literally cut off.

I've tried different settings on the pedal, different guitars (single coil and humbucker), as well as different amps...all the same result. I have nothing else in the chain between my guitar and amp.

Am I missing something, or is this what I should expect from the pedal?

Problem is that I feel like with my set up I won't really benefit that much from the looper. I would probably only have one pedal in each loop, for example I might have my RAT, Green rhino, and supa germ fuzz pedal in their own loops and have my Pork Loin out of the looper since I often stack that pedal with my other distortion type pedals. Another thing I could do is have my Whammy DT and tuner in one loop.

I've heard bad things about the behringer and FAB flangers, anyone able to change my mind on those? 

Thanks! 

Edit: as naazrael pointed out, I forgot to mention what sound I'm going for. Well I like the old Hendrix flanger sound, I think he uses it in bold as love. On the other hand I'm also in love with the Tame Impala sounds from the lonerism album. I'd say my flanger has to be able to do creamy thick flanges with a warm sound and has to be more than subtle. 

Edit2: I've decided to go for an ibanez cf7 because I got it for like 10 dollars. Since it's a very whacky effect I'll be able to try out all the different flanger modes and try to find one I really love. Then when I've sold enough pedals to be able to buy a new one, I'll buy either the mooer eleclady or an electric mistress. Thanks folks!

Edit3: So, I've bought the Rocktron hypnotic flanger for 50 dollars, and it's warm! Very warm. It's subtle though, you can't get the crazy stuff out of it, but I don't care, it really has that electric mistress warm-ness all over it. "	t5_2r0bp	True

I grabbed a MarkOne Audio Looper the other day and tried out a few different pedal loops. I'm currently quite happy with this layout. Very tight squeeze though!

I have the Pitchblack going into the Maxon OD-9, into the input of the MarkOne and the ouput going into the amp. The first loop goes into the EQ, DD-3 and then Ditto Looper. The second loop into the NS-2 with the LPB-1 through the return/send.

It basically allows me to use the one pedal (MarkOne looper) to control everything on my board without having to tip toe around, as well as making it possible to switch between a dialled back tone with some delay to full on overdrive with one switch.

First, let me say, please let me know if this isn't welcome here, the last thing I want to be accused of is being a shill as that is not my intention at all!

I work for a company called [Endangered Audio Research](http://www.endangeredaudioresearch.com/). We make the [AD4096](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6V9XyzgcM) analog delay pedal and the infamous [Gristleizer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lxd_soyuG0). We are a very small company trying to carve a niche in the pedal market by offering something a little different. Our pedals are unique, noisy, and from the circuits to the knobs almost every part is made in America to the highest standards of quality. Every single pedal we make is assembled here and is personally played and tested by one of us before it leaves. 

Right now we are working on generating more traffic on our facebook page, and to do so we've decided to have a giveaway. We'll be giving away swag for our company, DIY kits, and even some pedals if it goes well! The details of the contest are [here](http://www.endangeredaudioresearch.com/the-ear-facebook-giveaway/), and our facebook page is [here.](http://www.facebook.com/EndangeredAudio)

Also, while I'm here if anyone has any questions about my job, our company, or the pedal industry in general I'll be happy to answer them to the best of my ability!

As far as genres, I play 90's alternative/indie rock and modern indie and punk. Stuff like Radiohead, Brand New, Nirvana, Cloud Nothings, Japandroids.

Or, I could take off the swivel thing, and use the side with the lip. I'd either put some carpet or something in it to level the lip, or just keep it and utilize the lip. In this scenario, I could attempt to build some kind of footing to angle the board a bit, like a pedaltrain.

I found that it created a significant amount of loud pops and crackles (not just normal OD/Dist. hiss), especially when the gain was up fairly high. We're talking pops like when you play a really, really dirty record. So I called PGS and returned it. They said it was a perfectly working pedal because they tested it and it didn't do any of those things. I'm pretty sure it did, as I tried it with many amps (solid and tube), many guitars (Single coils and humbuckers) and many cables (some that I bought brand new a few days prior). 

Either way, they sent me a new one a few days ago, and I found that it has the same pops/crackles. It's really distracting and it pisses me off that something I paid $150 for isn't playing nice. Anyhow, now that I've gotten 2 different units, I can't help but wonder what it is. It's almost definitely not my rig, as I run some pretty heavy fuzz/distortion already and there are no pops/crackles. Not to mention that I changed rigs/isolated the pedal testing it. Could it just be the nature of the circuit? I find that hard to believe, too. Could I have just been unlucky enough to get 2 bad pedals in a row? Harder to believe still. 

Do you have this pedal? Does it backsass you like it does me? What would you do if you were me?

Thanks in advance.

PS: In the process of returning the first pedal, PGS sucked. I mean, sucked. I called 3 times over the course of a week before anyone picked up the phone. Then they took my name and order #, and then forgot to send me a postage sticker. So I called for like a week after, when they finally picked up it took them a while to figure out that they forgot to send me one. And then it took them 2 weeks to call me to tell me that I was being stupid and that the pedal was fine, at which point I had to call back (a few days later because they wouldn't pick up) and ask them to send a new one anyway. I don't think I'll buy from them again. The prices were high (as expected for new, relatively boutique gear) so I was really banking on the service being excellent. It wasn't.

ZakkThrift	7	3	18	"So I play a Gibson Explorer through a Peavey 5150, and the main problem I have is getting a nice clean tone. It has two channels but they vary so much, the 'clean' channel will be on 7 in volume and the 'distorted' on 3 and somehow the distorted will still be louder than the clean. I play in a band that switches a lot between the two dynamics and when going from distorted to clean there's always a huge sound loss, and when going from clean to distorted it just is too harsh a transition. 

I was wondering if there was a certain pedal or multi-effects unit that could help with my problem. I was thinking possibly getting an overdrive or distortion pedal to replace my 2nd channel so it's not so abrupt, but I really doubt I'll enjoy the tone of that, my distorted channel is really pretty nice.

Well my band currently uses loops live to have a bunch of math-y guitar riffs playing off each other, but we're a jam band at heart and find the constant tempo throughout songs too restrictive.

I am home on break and I want to build a new drive pedal. I play guitar for a melodic hardcore band that has lots of ambient parts so I have some unusual requirements for distortion and overdrive. I play a fairly even mix of rhythm and lead. My rhythm parts are usually complex chords using all six strings, so clarity is an important aspect. My leads are usually tremolo picked with lots of delay and reverb, so I need a sound that won't be overpowering. We also have heavy parts that use lots of feedback and noise.

My guitar is a Classic Player Jazzmaster, and I use an Ampeg V4 and a Sunn Model A in stereo. Right now I'm using a Boss HM-2 for heavy parts and leads and a Catalinbread SFT clone for rhythm. I like aspects of both and they stack nicely, but I think I can find a pedal that is better and can replace both of them. 

Right now I'm looking into the Pharaoh Fuzz, a tweaked/modded Rat clone, the Zvex Box of Rock, and some of Walrus Audio's overdrive pedals.

My effects loop board is mostly for my time based effects. I use my M9 is used mostly for delay (analog and sweep are the go-to's) and reverbs ('63, Octo, and Particle), the Holy Grail is almost always on the spring setting, but Flurb is used some, the DL4 is used only for looping live, the LPB-1 is a solo booster, and the Moog Murf is only used in a few places but the sound just leaps out of the speakers.

EDIT: any reviews on the memory toy and the holy grail? Are they worth it?"	t5_2r0bp	True

As both a guitarist and someone who works with synths, I often feel like stuff made for guitars doesn't have the same amount of deep, you could say, ""clinical"", relatively, parameter control that synths have. For example, I don't just want a standard wah pedal, I want one where I can control the bottom frequency, the top frequency, and the bandwith/resonance (wahs are bandpass right?).

To extend this idea, I'd really like to see this for all effects. I'd like to be able to control *every controllable factor* of a given effect, within reason of course. I'd like a multi-band EQ in pedal form. ( Is that asking too much? Should I look into rack gear?) If not, just a straight highpass (+ lowpass, band, etc.) filter pedal.

I'm still a bit hesitant though because I'm not sure if it is it versatile enough to justify the $289 price tag. Also, do the joystick controls feel like a gimmick?

In the 2000's I was all about modeling amps.  Simple rig; was awesome for gigging, but I was never super happy with the tone.  I have now come full circle and want to get rid of all the digital/solid state amps and go full tube with stompboxes.



I am not super sure what amp I want.  Right now I am leaning between as Fender Hotrod Deluxe at the high price point, and a VOX AC15C1 at the lower end.  Basically something loud and with a nice clean that is not too expensive.


The problem is cost.  In order to get one of these bad boys, I need to sell a few other amps.  This can take some time.  I could sell it in a day, or it might take months to sell.  
I do however have the cash to start my new pedal collection right now.

Would it be worth getting a few now and using them with my current amps (I will get to those in a second)??  Or wait a while to get the amp first?   

The amps:  **VOX Pathfinder 10.**  Little practice amp, Solid-state.  Might not sound the greatest, but not gonna blow anything up in the amp.   

**Fender Mustang III.**  The guys from Fender seem to say it is OK.   Obviously using a dirty setting then adding a distortion pedal is gonna be clip city, but I figure a clean setting should be OK.   (In this scenario, I can also use the stomp-box function of the 4 button footswtich to use some effects like chorus and compression.   There is also an effects loop on this amp.


Last amp, and the one I use at rehearsals and have used at every gig I've played (not that I like it, it is just loudest) is an old **Line 6 Spider II 212.**

Never used any pedal with with amp.  I have read some forum posts that say it works.  Originally they advised not using external effects with that amp.  

So that is that I have for now...


The Pedals I want to get:

My band plays metal, but we have always used weird combos of guitars and amps to do so.  We also play various kinds of rock, blues...or anything we find fun at the time.

I want a simple, yet versatile setup, so I am thinking Little Big Muff, Metal Muff, Bad Monkey (might splurge for a more expensive OD)Small Clone, Holy Grail, Tuner, Crybaby and maybe a compressor.

Right now, Like today, I can grab the Metal Muff and LBM.  I already have a Crybaby.  I am just not sure if I could get the Amp first (Chicken) or the pedal collection (Egg)

And even then, are these 2 the best two on that list to get?  Is there a more practical combo?  

Are any of the micro or Nano versions of these (Small clone, Holy Grail, micro Metal muff) as good as their big brothers?


I wanna thank anyone that actually makes it all the way through this post.  And even more thanks to anyone that can offer any advice or wisdom on the matter.

I have a POG2 on the way that will go on the top right, I'd like to get an EHX Cathedral to put on the top left.  The only thing big enough to take up a decent ammount of room would be a looper (as in independent channel one).

Depending on whatever amp I end up using that could take up some space as well if I mounted on board.  I'm not even sure if I could find someone to do a straight up trade of PT-3 for my PT-pro.  I think it'd be ideal since the PT-pro cost more ...but not sure.

1335115278.0	smtbs	Delay w/ Expression Pedal	jad7845	7	1	11	"Hey all! I actually happen to be a bassist, but I'm looking for some advice on delay pedals.

My ideal pedal is a delay with three features: a tap tempo, _and_ an expression pedal connected to the delay time (i.e. tempo), and (perhaps) a 2nd expression pedal connected to the wet/dry blend.

That last one seems like the least likely to happen - if it's impossible, is there some sort of ""volume-like"" pedal to blend between two separate inputs? Because then I could just split the signal between the clean bass tone and the delay and send both into the 'blend' pedal to pull in and out of the tone.

The idea here is to be able to manipulate all of these easily to just do some crazy things.

Here's what I've got so far: the [Delay Lama+](http://www.jampedals.com/delay-llama/) is a boutique pedal with a ""hold"" switch (when held down it activates infinite oscillation) and an exp pedal delay time modifier. Other than that, there's a [mod company](http://www.analogman.com/dd5.htm) which will modify a Boss DD5 to have a single expression pedal modify the delay time.

Mostly jam in private, and used to be into recording more (still have all the gear).  I like/play a wide array of music genres, with primary influences falling into 70s Rock (Sabbath, Zep, Floyd), various blues artists (SRV, Hendrix, Allman Brothers), Grunge Era (Pearl Jam, Pumpkins, Radiohead), and Metal (Metallica, Slayer, Lamb of God, The Sword).  Lately, it's been mostly about the Metal.

When it comes to effects, I've really never messed with or learned *real* pedals too often.  Mostly, I've had a PodXT I've used directly and for recording.  Amps include a Fender Ultimate Chorus 2x12 (Solid State), and a 5150 Block Letter Peavey Amp paired with a slant Mesa 4x12.

I've been stagnant on playing in recent years, but recently picked up the 5150 + Mesa and now the juices are flowing.  I'd like to build the pedals around this amp.  Obviously, this is going to be a heavier setup...

So just today really I got to thinking that I really want an M9...I've known about them for a while now but I always brushed them off since they were a lot of money. However, just today the brain storm came that if I sold off a good chunk of my board which could be recouped through the utilization of the unit, the cost wouldn't be that bad at all. Obviously it's a little unsettling to think of, but I think overall it would be a great idea, considering I have a list of pedals that I'd like to buy in the future that could all be satisfied with the M9 as well.

So now for some questions...first off, anyone have any experience with these units? Has anyone ever sold off their pedals to use one instead? 

For anyone that does have either an M9 or M13, is it your pedalboard, or is it just on your pedalboard with other pedals...if so, what do you find it lacks that you use outside pedals for?

In my preliminary brainstorm, I figured some pedals I think I'd need in addition to the M9:

* another delay

* a volume pedal (and an EXP for the M9)

* a looper (I know it has one, but I think it'd be best to have an individual looper

* maybe keep my BD-2 or Muff...the M9 has plenty of dirt selections, but these two are both not on the list of features...the Muff is included in the M9 but I take it it's the American version and I love the Russian.

I think that in the long run, such a decision would be more practical and useful for me.

Another question for users...how is the durability? I'd hate to invest in it and sell off back up pedals only to have it break and me be left with nothing.

1367517481.0	1dkblu	Need help finding the right Multi-FX unit	TablatureDude	6	0	5	"I have been playing for 30 years using a strat, vibroverb and some form of distortion pedal. that's all I know.

I have been asked to join a group playing all Eagles songs. So, I think I need the following things in a single unit (so I can manage it with one button per ""sound"").

* Delay
* Chorus
* Reverb
* Flanger
* Tremolo
* distortion (not mandatory I could use a loop if needed)
* Smart Pitch Shift. (songs like Hotel California that have 5 guitars)

From my searching it seems that the pitch shifter is the hardest to satisfy. What's my best bet?"	t5_2r0bp	True
1367378228.0	1dgjsa	Volume pedal placement?	FoolOnThePlanet91	4	0	12	"Hey all,
I have a volume pedal that I keep at the end of my chain, right before the amp. I use it for swells but most often as a mute to silence the signal so I can unplug cords without pops, etc.

My question is, would placement earlier in the chain, like after dirt and delay and everything, be better for the swells?? Could it still be used as I usually use it?

How does placement affect volume pedals?

Thanks!"	t5_2r0bp	True

I know that both guitarists use Malekko CHICKLET pedals, which are the small pink ones and I assume the white pedal in the top right is Chris' tuner. Is the red one next to the CHICKLET a Boss RC-10 Looper on Chris Reimer's board? Is the yellow MXR on Pat's the Micro Chorus? Any help naming any of the others would be lovely.
Sorry for such bad quality, this comes from the only decent video I have that captures both clearly. Would love to find a clearer picture.

1367333700.0	1dew50	Multi-FX instead of spending $500	CorneliusDawser	7	1	17	"Hay guys! I am a bass player, but I recently started getting serious about guitar playing. I already have a good pedalboard for my bass (which has about 500$ worth of pedals on it), but I just don't want to spend the same for the guitar, since I have yet to get a guitar of my own and, of course, an amp! 
So, here's my plan: A friend of mine could sell me his Boss ME-20 for 140$. Fair enough, I believe. Since the biggest problem with these are the horrible overdrives and distortions, what I would do is put a good OD before it, maybe a dirt or fuzz (Always wanted a Fuzz Factory, but since it sucks on bass, could never justify it), and maybe one of these Boss Fender amp imitator pedals after everything (since I don't have the money for a good Fender amp). 
Would all this setup be a good idea? Or maybe getting the ME-20 is a bad move?

I have been trying to reproduce the really washy, drone type sound they get, with moderate success.  What I would like to do is find a way to take the percussiveness off of the front end of the notes I play, so that when the signal goes through delay pedals, I don't hear the beats from the repeats as loudly.  I have been achieving this recently by maxing out my holy grail, but I was wondering if anyone knows of a pedal specifically for making notes ""Fade In,"" per se.  I was thinking about a volume pedal, and a compressor also seemed like it would suit this purpose.

to reiterate, I am looking for a way to make notes have less attack, and be less percussive.  Do you guys have any suggestions?"	t5_2r0bp	True
1364918878.0	1biss5	Elusive Vintage Electro-Harmonix Small Clone	Pasta_Macgyver	4	1	2	"So in high school, I was a huge Nirvana fan and began acquiring gear that Kurt used.  In 1999, I came across an EH Small Clone (Full Chorus ca.1981) and purchased it from a used guitar shop website.  I think I paid $200 USD.  They were really hard to find, I had to have one. 

About a year later, I needed some $ and put it up for sale on a forum and it was quickly purchased for $300.  Fast forward a few years and the pedal is reissued by EH. I play with one at Guitar Center to much disappointment.  Not even close to the sound I remembered with the original.

Anyway, I am not sure if I missed out on a big investment because I can't find much info on the original.  So a few questions if anyone can help:

Has anyone else used the original?  Did they all have green LEDs like mine? How much are these worth in a fair market? Are there any analog pedals that are comparable?   Thanks."	t5_2r0bp	True

My current board is powered, but I'm not opposed to buying a power supply if the new board is unpowered but otherwise ideal (size, design etc).

I prefer simplicity but I'm pretty open to anything.

I also play live a lot so portability and some sort of external case are a must
