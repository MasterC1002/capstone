But when I think about Berkeley, I am instantly in a happy place. It was an excellent mix of vigorous intellectual exercises, social explosions, and personal development. I hope you all continue to work very hard, and also play very hard.

Over the past several years, I have met many people from different colleges. The big takeaway I've had is this: I was incredibly lucky. Cal was an incredible experience. I talk to people today who had forgettable college experiences. High school 2.0, if you will.

And my, how you are all so lucky! I hope you all are having a great semester. Live your lives beyond the maximum. Do amazing things every day. Thanks for letting me get sentimental here. Much love, and GO BEARS!"	t5_2qh9w	True

I was incredibly disappointed to see protesters rolling joints, hurling unnecessary verbal catcalls at the police, being uncooperative with police asking to see ID, etc. This type of behavior helps solidify negative stereotypes about Occupy protesters nationwide, and undermines the serious political goals of the movement.

I fully support the grievances aired by the Occupy movement, but I worry about its future if people don't begin acting more professional. The police were in the wrong when they tore down the camp, but that's no excuse for some of the things I've seen. We need to show the world that we're not going to be immature, that we're not jobless hippies protesting simply for the sake of protesting.

Thank you.


EDIT: To address some of the points people have brought up:

Yes, I'm aware that smoking weed is common here and I don't have a problem with it in general. But I don't think it's too much to ask that people refrain from doing it during protests.

Additionally, when I refer to catcalls, I don't mean verbal condemnations of police activity. I mean personal attacks and racial slurs, which I heard a lot of. Yes, it's within our first amendment rights, but it hurts the movement's image. The police were filming the whole thing.

As for the IDs, the police were asking for ID to see who was a Berkeley student. I could be in the wrong here; I don't know whether the law is that people on campus have to show campus ID, but some people who did have Berkeley IDs and eventually ended up showing them were uncooperative at first just for the sake of being uncooperative. I don't see that as productive in any way."	t5_2qh9w	True

There was cheating on the final, and Professor Sahai posted the following vehement note on the classroom forum:

&gt;We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

&gt;**If you yourself cheated, I strongly urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley and possibly, to have your name and reputation ruined for all time. (Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)**

&gt;For those of you who saw something, please comment (anonymously (or not) as a follow-up in Piazza, or by sending us an email) telling us a. if you saw this, b. where roughly you were in the room, c. where the cheaters were.

&gt;If you know or suspect who the cheaters were (or can provide a description), please report that too if you can. Your accusation will not result in anyone being falsely accused as we have all the exams scanned in and will only proceed on the basis of hard evidence. It will just allow us to more swiftly verify it and most importantly, to isolate those scores from our thinking as we adjust grade thresholds.

&gt;It is really important in this case because we are trying to be fair to everyone in adjusting the grading to compensate for the unfortunate and unforeseen loss of 15 minutes. The cheaters are going to be hurting the grades of all the honest students in the class. They deserve no mercy or loyalty after doing such a despicable act to their fellow students. Please think of the good of all of the other students in the class and help us quickly find and isolate them from the sample.

&gt;We have tried our best to make a fair exam with a chance for students at all levels of ability to demonstrate their understanding, we let you drop questions on the final, we made a special practice exam whose difficulty was calibrated above the actual exam, we released a specially made exam skeleton to reduce any uncertainty about the format, we allowed students to bring 3 handwritten sheets of paper, and we offered ample extra credit opportunities in the class. **We created and staffed homework parties and study parties to help students both interact with each other and get attention in what would otherwise be a large and impersonal class. To have students cheat in this context is extremely upsetting to me. To do so brazenly, in view of their peers, is a shameless act that is simply shocking. I have never seen such a thing in one of my own classes in my years at Berkeley.**

&gt;For those who saw something, do not enable this kind of behavior in others. This is not normal. It should not be tolerated. They are contaminating your environment by their presence.

And later:

&gt;UPDATE: Our estimates show that the extent of the truly egregious cheating seems to have been quite limited --- less than 2% of the class. We have had confessions and detailed reporting that has helped us in the process of identifying perpetrators. Those guilty really should confess if they know what is good for them. **As Brian Harvey has eloquently put it, cheating is fundamentally a violation against yourself.** Character is built out of habits, and cheating is a very bad and addictive habit. **Cultivating good habits and shunning bad ones is absolutely critical in your life, especially your youth when your character is most malleable. The violence cheating does to your intuitions of right and wrong is a terrible thing.** It is not too late. If you come forward without prompting, it'll be like stealing something that was in a sealed package and returning it without it being either opened or missed. We will be lenient and your character (and grades) will benefit greatly.

&gt;For those of you who know something, please do step forward and report what you know to us. We've got lots of info, but your corroboration is very important. This is a matter of solidarity with your fellow classmates --- unrepentant cheaters have violated all of you. They must be rejected.

&gt;Original Post: We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

&gt;If you yourself cheated, I strongly urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley. **(edited to remove a stronger outburst of anger at the foolishness of provoking the wrath of Berkeley faculty.)**"	t5_2qh9w	True

*It still feels weird to type, but in a few short weeks, I will no longer be at Berkeley.*

*I’m not sure what I’ve learned in my time here, but I am going to share with you what I think I know, right before graduation takes me.*

*What follows is not intended to be the be all, end all guide to everything about college – no one could ever possibly write that, and I am woefully underqualified to do so. Rather, this column is going to consist of some reflections on my experience these last four years, categorized into some loose pieces of advice for readers at large.*

*Welcome to what has been my life. Hopefully it’s useful.*

*Pretty much nothing will go according to plan. That is okay. I started here aiming to finish my English degree in three years, mostly because I wanted to save my family some money. I had everything set up, every class drawn up and planned out, the kind of plan I’m sure many of you have right now. But the time table changed – and so did I. Come May 18th, I’ll still be graduating with a B.A. in English, but it will be in my fourth year, not the original three I had sketched out. Accompanying it will be minors in Education, Asian American Studies, and I fell one class short of my third minor in Creative Writing.*

*None of these things were on the schedule – they were interests that developed or were furthered during my years here. In the case of Asian American Studies, all it took was having an open slot in my schedule, and thinking hey, why not? What followed was one of the most intellectually rewarding experiences of my college career, one which I wasn’t prepared for but went with anyway.*

*Don’t keep your self strictly on a track, because you will miss a lot that way. Even if you have a ton of pre-reqs and requirements, be sure to make room to do something different too, whether it’s a class, a DeCal, or just an extracurricular. College is not about remaining where you are comfortable – it is about testing yourself and growing in ways you never thought were possible.*

*For the love of God, go to office hours. You don’t have to once you get the hang of things or you feel comfortable with how you’re doing, but it never, ever hurts to pay your instructors a visit. More on that here, though [[flip to page 24-25](http://issuu.com/calibermag/docs/issue6?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222)].*

*Nap. This one speaks for itself. You are not superheroes or cyborgs. You will need sleep, and whether it’s 20 minutes or an hour, naps can do wonders. Nobody’s that busy.*

*Almost everybody thinks they aren’t smart enough to be here, at one point or another. You are not alone in that. The important thing is not to let that self doubt cripple your ability to actually do anything – use it as motivation, as fuel to keep doing better. If you don’t feel smart enough, you should be working even harder to prove that you belong, not falling apart because of it.*

*In truth, if you’re reading this, you’re already here, which means it no longer matters if you think you’re smart enough or not. You are a Berkeley student – a title that exists because you’ve been accepted here; perceived intelligence be damned – and nobody is going to take that away from you unless you want it to be taken away from you.*

*Learn how you learn best, as soon as you can. Some people do well in groups. Some do not. Some work best visually, through an army of highlighters and sticky notes. Find a routine and a style that gets you the results that you want, tweaking and modifying it until you’re happy with who you are as a student. Do this beginning from your first day on campus, because who you are as a student and how you learn best are always changing. I only found out last month that I work best when tape recording lectures to listen back to at my own pace, since I have a hard time sitting still.*

*[You would also be surprised how many people have no idea how they learn.]*

*There isn’t one way to do college. Do you. Four years here, and I’ve never gotten shitfacedly drunk anywhere – I hardly ever drink at all, really – never been to a frat party, never woken up with some girl I didn’t recognize, never done any drugs, or any one of a billion things that make up the quintessential  “college experience”. Do I wish I had done a few things differently? Sure, who doesn’t? But do I think that that means my college experience was invalidated because I would’ve failed any Berkeley Bucket List? Hell no. I grew as a person, a student, and a future educator – and I’m happy with who I became here, as well as who I’m still becoming.*

*Growth doesn’t happen the same way for everyone. Don’t fool yourself into thinking there are things you “have” to do to get the most out of college – the only thing that matters is that you’re taking steps to being who you want to be.*

*Berkeley is amazing. Make it last. This place isn’t going to be a good fit for everybody, but I grew up dreaming of coming here, and while it hasn’t always been perfect, it’s been everything I hoped it would be. Give it a chance. All this goes without saying, but do take advantage of what it has to offer – all of its eccentricities and imperfections, its world class classes and its spectacular sights. You won’t regret it.*"	t5_2qh9w	True

1315184128.0	k4uml	Reminder: UC Berkeley Reddit Meetup Sunday, the 11th	DJCaboose	67	9	42	"**If you're planning on showing up, please just post saying you're planning to show up on the thread, just to get an idea of how many people we're gonna have.** My original guess was that around 30 people would show up, but I'm beginning to worry that may have been too conservative of an amount.

I guess if anyone is wondering how to find the meetup when it happens I'm a guy with blue/greenish and red streaks in my hair and I recently fractured my fibula so I'll also be on/have crutches. 

This is a repost/reminder for those interested. 

**When**: Sunday, September 11, 2pm - 4pm

**Where**: Memorial Glade

**What**: Potluck

**Why**: ????

**Who**: UC Berkeley redditors

Sunday, September 11 (I know), is the date that most people are able to make, according to the results of [this poll](http://www.doodle.com/28v47r8a9cyq4q8r#table). As for the time, let's set it up for the afternoon, perhaps 2 - 4 PM.

**Edit#2**: A lot of people seemed to like the idea of a potluck on Memorial Glade. Unless too many people object to that idea, we should organize/gather supplies around the potluck (food, drinks, plates, cups, forks/spoons, towels/blankets if you don't want to sit directly on the grass, entertainment stuff, etc...). To make it so that people don't buy too much of the same thing, let's quickly just come up with a list of stuff we all can bring. Just shoot me a PM and I'll compile a list over the next week.

**Edit#3**: This probably has been a bit of a potential issue for a while, but due to the fact that this is all being organized on a post, we're probably going to face attrition from people who stopped paying attention to the post and also we're going to face the lack of any potential fresh blood because people aren't going to see this post. So, feel free to invite your friends/spread the word (although I guess you don't need me to tell you to do that). In hindsight, it probably would've been better to make this on a facebook page as someone had suggested, but meh, I wasn't necessarily going in with the intention of doing all this &gt;.&gt;. Although, I guess I could always just make one now...

**Edit#4**: There's still a week + before our established date. The established time so far is 2 - 4 pm (ppl are free to organize their own little after meetup/party, I've seen the idea of a bar from 4 - 6 tossed around), if you have your objections and would like to suggest another time of the day feel free, as stated above there's still plenty of time to set up a different meetup time that will suit the most people. Anyways, continue sending me PM's (private messages) with whatever you can/want to contribute to the potluck. The idea is that we can spread the costs around a bit, so not one person or a few people has to bring everything.

Food: Karojo (chips, cookies)

Drinks: Vkmita (maybe? need confirmation), DJCaboose (Some juice and soda)

Plates: 

Cups: Vkmita (maybe? need confirmation), DJCaboose 

Utensils: DJCaboose (Forks)

Viewing party of the stream in 234 Dwinelle starting at 2:30 pm, w/ pizza for $2!!	8mmspikes	58	6	31	"**EDIT: VIEWING PARTY START TIME MOVED UP TO 3 PM**

**FACEBOOK EVENT FOR VIEWING PARTY: https://www.facebook.com/events/280751332031859/**

Traditionally the Collegiate Starleague has been centered in North America with its events, with some recent European involvement. Tomorrow that all changes. 

**The Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has challenged one of the CSLs top schools, the University of California Berkeley, to a best of 9 showmatch to prove their own mettle.** Boasting a lineup of Korean players such as Dream Team Gaming’s Sickness, and confirmed to be a team that practices with top Korean team MVP, KAIST is a strong challenger. Yet UC Berkeley is no small threat either. Winners of the very first CSL Season and consistent top finishers in subsequent seasons, UC Berkeley has been one of the CSLs finest representatives. Led by team ace CheckSixSuppy, the top placing American player and MLG Breakout Player of MLG Anaheim, UC Berkeley will look to defend its honor, and the honor of the CSL, in battle against the Korean challengers. **Who will emerge victorious in this international clash of educational institutions? Tune in TOMORROW starting at 3:00 pm PST to find out!**

----

**THE EVENT: UC Berkeley vs KAIST in a best of 9 showmatch**
 
**THE FORMAT: GSTL all-kill format using the GSTL Season 2 mappool**

**THE STREAM: [twitch.tv/cstarleague](http://www.twitch.tv/cstarleague) starting at 3:00 pm PST**

---

If you live in or near the Berkeley area there will be a live viewing party of the event hosted by Berkeley CSL as well, taking place on the UC Berkeley campus in room 234 Dwinelle Hall. Space will be limited so be sure to show up a little bit before! Pizza will be available for $2!"	t5_2qh9w	True
1335252686.0	spnil	My one piece of advice for incoming freshmen.	chaoticvoid	55	2	21	I just wanted to put this out there, as a lot of people don't browse through all the comments.  My advice is just to get out there, and join a community.  Almost every one I met in Berkeley, I met through a group.  All of the people I knew benefited a lot by joining different groups on campus.  Don't be afraid to go out there and experiment different things, there are so many different organizations out there, it's almost impossible not to find somewhere you fit in.  Just put yourself out there and find something that fits you, it'll benefit you tremendously.	t5_2qh9w	True

As a result I've been struggling a lot with purpose and self-worth issues. Honestly have no idea how I'm going to enjoy life with my plans not going the way I thought they'd go.

But that's not what this post is mainly about. I guess the real problem here is just... I have no one to talk to about it (maybe this is obvious since I'm here annoying you guys instead of keeping my business off reddit and to myself). I feel like no one really understands me, cliche as it sounds. My acquaintances here have dismissed my complaining--they're not aiming for grad school, so they often have a different idea of what a good GPA would constitute. My acquaintances who *are* keen on getting into grad school wouldn't understand me because they've been strong enough to avoid the pitfalls and to conquer the travails that ruined me. Think the stereotypical ""overachiever"" friends who would simply view rants like mine as a sign of weakness. 

I do have friends from before coming to Berkeley. However, these friends from outside Berkeley are drifting away, furthermore they go to different schools and study different fields and they don't really have time for long conversations about life anymore. So in general I guess I'm just lonely, and this loneliness is most bitterly experienced in times of extreme self-doubt, times of utter destruction of any faith in my own aptitude. Sometimes, I think, just having someone else there for validation would work wonders for my emaciated confidence. 

**TL;DR:** Fucked up academically this semester, I just have near zero faith in myself right now and it sucks being alone and having no one to vent to.

**Edit:** I am so grateful for all the support my post has been getting from people in this subreddit. This seriously means a lot to me; this seriously is the most anyone has helped me out regarding my issues (granted, it was several people, but it's still the most feedback I've gotten). Thanks to all those who replied, who continue to reply, and who will reply. "	t5_2qh9w	True

1371679757.0	1gopan	Hungry Homeless Berkeley Students	maxdougherty	53	10	23	"	Berkeley has a long history of supporting its large urban homeless 
community. Through donations and food drives, UC Berkeley students give 
their time and money to provide shelter and necessities of life. But this often 
skips the largely under-recognized community of homeless students on our 
own campus. These are students who live out of their cars or in the library. 
Those who use the RSF to shower or ""couch surf"" moving around nightly among
acquaintances. They are students engaging in a full course load on top of 
worrying about where they are going to spend the night and find a reliable 
meal. Many of these students are too ashamed to ask for real help or just don't
know how to. Most of us, as students ourselves, don't have much to give, but 
we can make a difference and there are some institutions in place that try to 
help. 
	Programs like ""Meal Points for the Homeless"" allow you to buy food at 
the GBC and then hand it to student volunteers who take the donations to a 
homeless shelter. But unless willing to seek help at a shelter, this effort 
excludes the homeless student population. Instead I propose a point donation 
system. If we had the ability to donate our remaining meal points to a pool to 
distribute among these students rather than turn them into a nearly literal pool 
full of reese's cups or other non-essentials that most students quickly buy at 
the end of the semester to spend their remaining points, we could help make a 
difference in the lives of our fellow students.
	Of course there are a number of questions to answer and any real 
program would have to be thoroughly developed, but my hope is to start a 
university-wide discussion. Maybe we could really make a positive impact on 
the lives of many of our fellow students. This Berkeley community is a family 
and has traditionally stood up for those in need. Why not include our own 
student population! Let me know what you think and whether you want to join 
the effort to make a difference.

This is most common with Cal students not from the area or with people who are not from the bay. Don't get me wrong, I love Cal, I'm a fan of all there sports teams, and if I wasn't the underachiever that I am, I probably would have attended the school myself. I just have gotten to the point that I'm staring to resent the seemingly judgmental looks I get whenever I tell someone not familiar with the area, that no I don't go to Cal, I just live in Berkeley and I take classes at Berkeley City College. So if you are one of these people I speak of, I am just here to inform you that Berkeley has a population of over 100,000 people.

I think it's quite hard to defend the position that Jeff Tedford should remain the coach of the California Golden Bears. 

Yes, he turned the program around 11 years ago (longest tenured head coach west of the Mississippi, or some such). And we're all grateful for that. But things have gotten pretty bad. The players seem to have turned against him. There's yelling on the sidelines, people look confused. We're unable to staff key positions with quality players.

I saw some stat the other day that we are like 8th overall (in the nation) in producing NFL talent. That's insane. Yet, we can't manage to put together a (.500 + ε) season. That's coaching. 

This isn't just a W/L problem. This is a financial issue. We went pretty far in debt to pay for the stadium retrofit, banking on us being able to sell seats. If we can't fill the stadium, I'm not sure what's going to happen. And thing's haven't looked that great the last two games.

He was going about 40-50 mph and was about 150m away from us in the crosswalk before I realized he wasn't going to stop. If my roommate and I hadn't booked it, we would've definitely been hit. There was one person behind us that saw the entire incident but we didn't get his name or anything, and we couldn't see the license plate of the car or anything. It was just a tan car (or some light color) that was pretty old, the guy who was inside slurred a very unapologetic 'sorry' before speeding away again. I was wondering if anyone else saw the whole thing or had any other information, this guy was completely reckless and he would have seriously injured us. I know we don't have alot of information since it was dark and we were pretty shaken, but anything helps. Also, if you're reading this, thank you to that guy who gave us a shout when the car started accelerating, you saved our lives tonight. 	t5_2qh9w	True

A girl decides to cross (which I have no problem with) yet she doesn't look left or right before crossing and steps out literally right in front of me. I had to run over her feet because I had zero room to maneuver out of the way.

Please people, watch where you are going for all of us. I understand I'm an asshole when I'm riding on sidewalks and such and I try to avoid that at all costs, but please leave the roads to us. If you aren't crossing at a cross walk, GET OFF YOUR PHONE AND LOOK BOTH WAYS."	t5_2qh9w	True

He kept asking me if I could log his computer on so he could email tech support and see what's happening. I told him no, and that he could use my computer which he didn't seem interested in doing. He said he had a project due and needed the net to work on it, but I politely told him I couldn't log him on using my name.

Assuming he had probably been kicked off airbears for something, I asked him, and he said he had a torrent open. 

Just a reminder not to let anyone use your internet. Had I logged him in, he could have gotten me kicked off, or done any number of things, not to mention, easily snag the keystrokes and take my info to log on at his pleasure. (imagine if you had no airbears-- it would suck and how tempting would it be to steal someone's log-in.) I'm not saying he had anything malicious in mind, but there's always that chance.

I'm subscribed to this sub, even though I'm not a Berkeley student. I've lived in Berkeley for 10 years, and just sort of enjoy seeing what you all are up to. 

I'm just curious how many of you get out and do stuff around Berkeley- do you head to the Marina? Have you been to the Albany Bulb? Or the neat beach made out of old crockery pieces dumped there in the early 1900s, up a bit north? Do you go hang out at the beach in Emeryville when it's nice? Do you go shopping on 4th street, or wander on Solano avenue? Tilden Park? Indian Rock Park to watch the sunset?

Or are you pretty campus-centric due to no car, no time, etc? I'm just curious. There seems to be a pretty big separation between ""town"" and ""campus"" aside from those bits of downtown right next to campus, and Telegraph of course. 

I'm always up for playing townie tour guide, if anyone would be interested in a trip to the Bulb and the crockery beach or something and doesn't have a car. :)

Free to attend, more info inside (venue to be determined) :D	CSLBerkeley	44	10	12	"**UPDATE: ROOM HAS BEEN DETERMINED - ROOM 3 EVANS HALL UC BERKELEY CAMPUS. STREAM WILL BE twitch.tv/cstarleague POST BELOW UPDATED TO SIGNIFY THESE CHANGES**

The Collegiate Star League (CSL) and UC Berkeley would like you to come out this weekend to learn about the CSL and eSports events in general. With that in mind we'd like to present THE BIG MATCH, a matchup between the Starcraft 2 teams of the two rival schools, Cal and Stanford, as part of the CSL’s regular season. Cal, currently 12-2 on the season and 2nd in the division, is looking to finish the last stretch of the regular season on a strong note after suffering their second defeat of the season to UC Irvine’s squad last week. Led by ace player CheckSix Suppy, and with a strong squad behind him, Cal is looking to get into prime form and solidify their place in the division as the playoffs draw near. Stanford, currently 9-5 on the season, is looking to make playoffs by placing top 30 in interdivisional play. There’s a lot at stake for their team with only a few games remaining in the season, and they will have a sense of urgency to win as a result.

The breakdown: http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6118/bigmatchfinal.png

What: THE BIG MATCH - Cal vs Stanford, best of 5 matchup for the Collegiate Star League

When: Saturday, February 4th starting at 1 pm

Where: Room 3 Evans Hall http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html

Event: The matches will be brought to you live via stream with commentary using the projector in the lecture hall. Attendance is free, so please come by to check it out and support our team! Tell all your friends!

Format: The Collegiate Star League uses a best of 5 format for the regular season, with three 1v1s and a 2v2, and one closing ace match with unannounced players. Teams submit their lineups for the first four sets 3 days before the match, with the ace player by each team during the match if it reaches the 5th set. The order of sets goes:

Set 1: xSixSuppy **&lt;GSL Daybreak&gt; ioRemarK&gt;** ioRemarK

Set 2: IMtwentyoneJ **&lt;MLG Xel'naga Caverns&gt;** SituatioN

I love this subreddit, but I didn't get in as a transfer from a UC. Got into UC Davis, but I am absolutely devastated. I plan to appeal, but I don't have anything new to say, so the chances are slim I guess. Out of high school, I was rejected everywhere except UCR and UCSC. I hoped this would be my second chance, but I am not smart enough like you guys. Fuck. 


Fuck me, fuck my life, and bring on the downvotes. Thanks for the fun you guys, going to unsubscribe now.


TL;DR - A rant to feel better about my shitty life.

As a fellow student, I thought I'd just propose the credit union on campus, CUBS. credit unions are non-profit. they're located at lower sproul and offer highly competitive interest rates and various free debit accounts with no monthly fees. It's open to Berkeley students and staff so it's actually a good opportunity to take advantage of the time you're here to use the on-campus ATM's (there's like 10 of them). I have a student VISA with them too and was easily approved (unlike at BoA) and can start building my credit early, which is great. 
It's $5 one-time fee to become a member, and there's always promotions to waive, or get a referrer. check out their website cubsonline.org for info. Or just walk in on lower sproul beside the cal1card office, and check it out. they're run by students so they legitimately are watching out for our best interests. or pM me.

* Tear down Evans, Moffitt, and Tolman. Replace with Neoclassical-architecture buildings (I like Neoclassical...). Evans is visible from most corners of campus, the undergraduate library HAS to be more aesthetically attractive than it is right now, and Tolman is a massive (and ugly) safety hazard.

* Put carpet in the North Reading Room. Got this idea from Yale's library, where the entire Reading Room doesn't shoot daggers at you when you drag your chair.

* General maintenance in the Chemistry Quad. I'm pretty sure a bunch of leaks aren't good for the structures.
* Endowing more landscapers/gardeners and janitors. The former to upkeep the grounds; the latter to keep the Evans, Dwinelle, Wheeler, and Barrows bathrooms cleaner.

* Form an endowment to keep Main Stacks open 24/7 throughout the year. Studying is important!

I think you get the idea. We LOVE boardgames! And we're super excited to share games and meet new people! We regretably don't have a group website yet, but we hope to have one before the end of September. For now we have a facebook group [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/386451501365588/) which you can request to join for updates / rsvp to events. 

We're going to be providing **free pizza** (a slice or two per person) for those attending, but we need to gauge how much to get! If you think you might come **please** upvote the ""attending"" comment below, or join the facebook group and rsvp! 

Werewolves summary:
""Bearwolves is a game known by many names (Mafia, Werewolves of Miller's Hollow). It takes place in a small village that's haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or special character such as The Hunter, the Witch, The Seer, The Devil and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. 

The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is ""lynched"", reveals his/her role and is out of the game.

The Village wins if all the Werewolves are killed. The Werewolves win if there are an equal number of Villagers as Werewolves."""	t5_2qh9w	True
1342646806.0	ws5hf	Would anyone listen to a Berkeley talk show podcast if I made one?	SuperTurtle	29	3	18	"I looked in the iTunes store and couldn't find any podcast for UC Berkeley. Throughout the summer I've loved listening to podcasts of just a few people talking about their lives, making jokes, just having a good time in general. I'm no professional broadcaster, but I think a show revolving around people's experiences at the same school cold add a personal element that most podcasts lack. I'm also friends with a good number of comedians at the school, which could really liven up the show.

I know Berkeley students have a reputation for always being busy and not having a ton of free time, so do you think this is the sort of thing enough people would listen to? My goal is at least an average of 30 listeners per show.

Let me know if this seems like it would be worth the effort! Thanks for reading!"	t5_2qh9w	True

Just wanted to start off by giving a little background of my cofounder and I. We're currently both juniors at UC Berkeley. We recently started a mobile gaming studio called Yowza! We are working on our first game called picmypic. We were chosen to present at the EA headquarters in front of the EA CEO. He loved the idea and offered us free access to his facilities and free consulting from his top game devs for no obligation. My co-founder and I are going to the EA headquarters next week after spring break to work with some game developers.

We are looking for more Objective C programmers to help us create this game. We plan to have a beta out by the end of August.  

If any of this sounds interesting, and if working at an extremely young startup is something you'd like to do, please send me a pm. All of your work will have a significant impact on the direction of Yowza! We'd love to talk to anyone and everyone. A startup is nothing without great people and great talent.

The rate we pay is negotiable.  Please let us know your going rate!

We look forward to talking to you and thank you so much for your time.

I see that there is a growing population here but no one, or at least to my knowledge, has yet proposed a true reddit meetup. I figure if one is going to happen it should be as soon as possible before things start getting hectic. 

Edit: **Sunday, September 11** (I know), is the date that most people are able to make, according to the results of [this poll](http://www.doodle.com/28v47r8a9cyq4q8r#table). As for the time, let's set it up for the afternoon, perhaps 2 - 4 PM. 

Edit#2:  A lot of people seemed to like the idea of a potluck on Memorial Glade. Unless too many people object to that idea, we should organize/gather supplies around the potluck (food, drinks, plates, cups, forks/spoons, towels/blankets if you don't want to sit directly on the grass, entertainment stuff, etc...). To make it so that people don't buy too much of the same thing, let's quickly just come up with a list of stuff we all can bring. Just shoot me a PM and I'll compile a list over the next week.

Edit#3: This probably has been a bit of a potential issue for a while, but due to the fact that this is all being organized on a post, we're probably going to face attrition from people who stopped paying attention to the post and also we're going to face the lack of any potential fresh blood because people aren't going to see this post. So, feel free to invite your friends/spread the word (although I guess you don't need me to tell you to do that). In hindsight, it probably would've been better to make this on a facebook page as someone had suggested, but meh, I wasn't necessarily going in with the intention of doing all this &gt;.&gt;. Although, I guess I could always just make one now...

Edit#4: There's still a week + before our established date. The established time so far is 2 - 4 pm (ppl are free to organize their own little after meetup/party, I've seen the idea of a bar from 4 - 6 tossed around), if you have your objections and would like to suggest another time of the day feel free, as stated above there's still plenty of time to set up a different meetup time that will suit the most people. Anyways, continue sending me PM's (private messages) with whatever you can/want to contribute to the potluck. The idea is that we can spread the costs around a bit, so not one person or a few people has to bring everything.

TheFlashGordon	26	5	28	"So  I know we already have [this thread for new freshman](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1b79uq/congratulations_on_your_acceptance_to_uc_berkeley/), but I wanted to post this for all the spring admits since I was one and remember not knowing what to make of it. So, here is some basic info on it.

**Why am I not accepted to the fall semester?** Nobody knows for sure. Some people have ideas and theories about it being totally random, some think it's some bottom percintile, but nobody is 100% sure. Don't take it personally. Yo still live in the dorms, still go to classes that count for your grad. requirements, and will have the same expierence as regular admits.

**Are the classes harder/easier?** It's a bit subjective since most people don't take the same courses on FPF as they do on campus. I'd say it mostly depends on your instructor. In general, however, in my expierence and that of my friends, our FPF classes were a lot easier than our classes on campus. We always joke about first semester being easier, but that wasn't such a bad thing. haha 

**What are the downsides of FPF?** The class selection is terrible. Virtually 0 interesting classes, mostly general introductory classes. The ""professors"" are mostly GSI's. You have a unit cap, which isnt terrible but still sucks. The building sucks. It makes you feel like you're in high school because of the setting.

Almost everyone I knew was in what I call ""FPF Denial."" Which is a case where FPF kids were in denial that there was anything wrong with FPF. I suspect it stems from bitterness from not being on campus first semester. Common bullshit you'll hear:

* It's a great transition
* The classes are just as challenging/rewarding
* There's no difference between classes on campus and at FPF

These are all kind of half-true. Personally, I don't think yo really need a whole semester to transition. 

That said: **DO FPF!!!** I know i kind of just blasted FPF, but it is way better than coming in spring. You'll still have an awesome first semester, and it's a lot harder jumping in spring and trying to meet people and all that. When you start on campus, you'll already be familiar with the campus and you'll appreciat the class choice even more. Good luck to all! "	t5_2qh9w	True

Hey everyone, Thursday (October 13) from 12pm - 1pm there will be a zombie flash mob. Titled, ""Day of the Living Debt,"" this flash mob hopes to communicate the message that students in debt simply can not run away from it forever. Debt will always chase you. The longer you run, the larger the debt grows, and once you get tired and stop running, it will consume you. Due to fee hikes, most students will accrue debt as they attend school, as a result, to some extent, we all have already been bitten and infected. With little prospects of stable employment after graduation, our only choice is to succumb or to find the cure. 

If you wish to participate come meet up at Sather Gate at 11:30 PM. All you need to do is dress as a zombie! You can create your own getup at home or we will have some makeup to provide at the gate. If you don't or can't get dressed up as a zombie well then you can be one of the unlucky students who get to be chased around by the zombie debt mob!

**Why bother participating?** Well for one it'll be fun. Number two, without increased forms of collective action we might as well all bend over now and let the regents stick their Campiniles in our nether regions. Someone posted Hanging by a Thread on this subreddit under the post, ""What do you think of the UC Regents?"" That's a good video to watch, there's also some links on the facebook event page for more info. 

**Is this one action going to solve all of our problems?** No, of course not. This is an event that aims to energize the people at Cal to actively participate. 

**Edit: What is the metaphor of the zombie?** Well what do zombies do? They chase people. For how long? Until they're dead or those being chased are dead. The same concept goes with student debt, especially with a plan for 81% fee hikes coming. Either you somehow find a way to pay off your debts, which will be difficult because finding stable employment is not necessarily all that easy, or they will pretty much consume you. You can cut off an arm or a leg and throw it to the zombies to satiate their hunger for a little bit, but after that they'll still hunt you down. With debtors they will chase people down until the very last cent. 

Anyways, anyone is free to come. We're gonna gather up around Sather Gate around 11:30 am. I'll probably be there a bit earlier with some other folks. Invite your friends or anyone that would like to participate. And coincidentally our flashmob event happens to fall upon the same date and almost the same time slot as the call for a national student walkout for the occupy colleges thing, if you're into that. 

Also, if you want to watch something related....[UC President and regent, Mark Yudof Thriller](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-GZ-hrciBk)

Oh yeah, according to the weather channel, Thursday will be sunny with ""0% chance of rain,"" so uhh yeah, let's hope so!

Honestly, I feel already done with college. I just don't feel I'm smart enough in this environment. I don't even think I got into Berkeley because I was smart, but because I did a lot of great community outreach in high school. Now I have tons of reading all the time that I barely understand, and essays I think are crap. I've made friends with my floor mates and other people, I have friends in classes, I go out, but when it gets to the studying I just feel so overwhelmed all the time, and everyone around me seems so prepared and they just know so much stuff.
Also, none of my club stuff seem to have started, which was usually my escape in the past, and it's just so stressful. I don't know what to do. I just want to go home. I know this should past, but I just hate it so much right now.

tl;dr: I'm not smart enough for college.

There was a gas leak in our house last night and the pge guy said he could only find one of the leak sources: our dryer. apparently the landlord's handymen were too lazy to find one long pipe to connect our dryer to the gas so they tacked two shorter ones together....hence the gas leak. the dryer did not have a proper lint filter so there was a bunch of lint back there, and he said it could have started a huge fire. maybe only 3 days ago everest sent over one of their handymen to ""fix"" our dryer.
so now our gas is turned off because we need to wait on everest to send over a handyman to fix it. we have no hot water, gas, our stove doesnt work, and everest may take a week to address this...past experiences with them have taken that long, but nothing was as urgent as this. 
other issues in our janky ass house: everything leaks. faucets, showerheads, everything. we have no heat downstairs(pge guy said this was because the furnace wasnt installed corerectly, and he fixed it last night. also wrote a whole list of things we need everest to replace for things like the water heater, etc)

From the moment he came into my apartment, he has been the best little pet ever. Today I found out, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I can’t move him with me back down to SoCal. I tried to call and speak with some animal shelters in order to surrender him, but no one is picking up their phones. After asking around, I found out that I can surrender him to PetCo, however, I just really, really, really don’t want to give him to them. Thus, I am making this post to ask if any of you guys would like to adopt this little fur ball. I will provide with him the Normandy (a 20 gallon tank), food and bedding accommodations for a month, his toys, and his little wooden house. So if you guys are interested please PM me or just leave a comment here. One note: I promoted him last year to admiral when he survived a short car ride….so you have to call him Admiral Craig Shepard of the Normandy the Hamster…but that’s it.

In terms of finding internships and jobs at companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc., is a degree from one of the institutions more prestigious/valuable?


**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the feedback. I have a couple more concerns/questions.

**Waitlists:** Everyone always complains that it's impossible to get the classes you need at Berkeley. Is this true for EECS majors? How commonly are you put on the waitlist for a class/how easy is it to get off the waitlist?

**Stress:** Everyone knows both schools are stressful, but how much stress do EECS majors face at Berkeley? How prevalent are dropouts/suicides? How many hours of work do students typically put in a week?

**Extracurriculars:** What are some common extracurricular activities for EECS majors?

**Entrepreneurial Spirit:** Everyone knows Stanford has this entrepreneurial spirit, and it's something I found lacking at Caltech. What about at Berkeley (at Cal Day, professors mentioned some EECS students drop out to form startups. How true is this/how frequently does this occur?)










**Original:**
Here are a couple of key comparisons between the two schools that I have noticed:

**Class size:** Class size at Caltech is obviously smaller than Berkeley (35 CS majors vs. 300 EECS majors). Some lower div CS classes at Berkeley get as big as 200 students.

**Classes offered:** Caltech only has about 14 CS professors, whereas Berkeley has about 85 professors in EECS. At Caltech, they said that they didn't offer as great a variety of classes as schools like Berkeley because of the small department size. Caltech's CS is also very theoretical, according to both students and professors.

**AP credits:** Caltech does not accept AP credits, but Berkeley does (allows me to get out of more lower division classes)

**Core requirements:** Caltech's core is notorious for its rigor and difficulty (proof-based calculus anyone?) but makes me a better problem-solver and thinker (something interviewers like to see).

**Semester vs. quarter system:** Berkeley is on a 15 week semester system, whereas Caltech is on a 10 week quarter system. At Berkeley, I would have to take on average 4 classes a semester, but at Caltech, I would have to take 5 classes a quarter.

**Cost:** Berkeley is a lot cheaper than Caltech because I would pay in-state tuition (~$30,000 vs ~$55,000)

**Scholarships:** Berkeley is offering me the Regents' Scholarship of $2500 per year. This guarantees me housing for four years, gives me priority registration for classes (a big deal at Berkeley), a personal Faculty sponsor, and the ability to join the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (which hosts faculty dinners, alumni dinners, etc.) I don't know if this would give me a significant leg up over other EECS students in terms of getting letters of recommendation, finding research, etc.

**Housing:** Housing is not a problem at Caltech. At Berkeley, I have the Regents' Scholarship, so I am guaranteed housing for four years.

**Research:** About 70% of Caltech undergrads do research, but only about 1/3 of EECS undergrads do research. Caltech pretty much throws research at you; at Berkeley, professors want you to have more upper div classes under your belt so that you are more useful. Also, I feel like at Berkeley, I would be competing with other EECS students for research opportunities. Caltech is conveniently situated near JPL, and Berkeley is situated near LBNL.

**Internships/Jobs:** Everyone at Caltech says that a Caltech degree opens a lot of doors for you, regardless of your major (one professor offered the example of a Caltech Mech. E student who is now working for Google). At Berkeley, I feel like I would be competing with my fellow peers for the same jobs/internships/positions. However, these Berkeley grads seem to be doing fine (https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm), and Berkeley is conveniently located in the Bay Area (I'm from the Bay). Berkeley has a larger alumni network because of its larger size and because Caltech students are more academically inclined (more pursue academic careers versus professional careers).

**Environment:** Berkeley is known for being cut-throat. Caltech seems very friendly and welcoming (more cooperative than competitive).

**GPA:** The average GPA for Berkeley EECS is about 2.7 to 2.9. At Caltech, 130 of the 230 or so kids graduate with honors (3.5+ GPA)

**Double major:** At Berkeley, I have the ability to pursue a joint major (EECS and Materials Science or EECS and Nuclear Engineering). At Caltech, a common double major for CS students is CS and Business, Economics, and Management (BEM).

**Master's:** Berkeley has a 5 year's master's program for highly qualified EECS students (roughly 10 to 15 EECS students).

**Rankings:** US News &amp; World Report ranks Berkeley higher than Caltech for both computer engineering and EE (#4 and #3 vs. #8 and #7). Among people I've talked to in the Bay, they say that I should go to Caltech (more prestigious)."	t5_2qh9w	True

It is a large frame Globe hybrid.  It's black, missing the front wheel, had a wire rack on the back with a basket on the right side, all black.  It wasn't registered, but the sticker telling me to register is still on the frame.  There's also a mount for a U-lock on the frame and it looks pretty new.  If anyone sees anything like it, please contact me here! 

Thanks r/Berkeley!"	t5_2qh9w	True

1325283373.0	nwrh1	Grow a College Subreddit Competition UPDATE: As a community we need to decide a few things about the distribution of prizes.	vkmita	21	1	12	"Moderators of /r/berkeley got a message from admin [bsimpson](http://www.reddit.com/user/bsimpson) a day ago:

&gt;Just wanted to check in and let you all know that we've assembled a meetup themed prize pack with custom stickers and other assorted stuff. Can you let me know where we should deliver it? (I'll warn you when it's sent out). Also we're thinking of doing the frontpage logo and style changes at the end of January in a sort of reddit college bowl week thing, but let me know if you wanted to do it on a different day (e.g. homecoming) and we'll consider that.

It has been decided that the package will be sent to me. I will not open the package until we actually distribute the prizes.

The next thing that we as a community need to decide is when and where we will distribute them. I think it would be the most logical to have a meetup probably somewhere on campus sometime at the beginning of the next school semester. The 28th of January seems like a decent date. It's a Saturday that's on the second weekend after school starts. In my opinion the first week is always too hectic.

Another thing we must decide is the date of frontpage style change. Homecoming sounds like good day, but perhaps somebody can think of a better date. If you have any opinion on any of these things please feel free to comment. I want to decide pretty much everything as a community so that it's the most fair :D 

I hope you are all having a fantastic break!"	t5_2qh9w	True

1321307593.0	mc8to	Chancellor's message regarding last week's events on campus	NaderM	21	2	6	"Dear Cal Campus Community:

I returned to Berkeley yesterday after a week-long trip to Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai where we successfully advanced some important new partnerships that will benefit our campus.
  
While away, I remained in intermittent contact with Provost George Breslauer and other members of our leadership team and was kept informed, as much as possible, about the Occupy Cal activities on campus.  However, it was only yesterday that I was able to look at a number of the videos that were made of the protests on November 9.  These videos are very disturbing.  The events of last Wednesday are unworthy of us as a university community.  Sadly, they point to the dilemma that we face in trying to prevent encampments and thereby mitigate long-term risks to the health and safety of our entire community.
   
Most certainly, we cannot condone any excessive use of force against any members of our community. I have asked Professor Jesse Choper, our former Dean of Law, and current Chair of the Police Review Board (PRB) to launch immediately a review of the police actions of last Wednesday and Thursday morning.  As is normal process, University Police Chief Mitch Celaya is concurrently undertaking an operational review of last week's events.  He has requested that it be conducted by a senior member of the command staff at one of our sister UC campuses.  This report will be provided to the PRB.  I am confident that Professor Choper will provide a fair and balanced judgment as speedily as possible. 

We believe that we can best move forward by granting amnesty from action under the Student Code of Conduct to all Berkeley students who were arrested and cited solely for attempting to block the police in removing the Occupy Cal encampment on Wednesday, November 9.  We will do so immediately. 

I believe that as a campus community, we can and must join together and focus on our common goals - inducing the state to reinvest in public education, working to repeal Prop. 13, finding a way to reverse Prop. 209, and instituting reforms that will help California regain its status as the door to the American Dream through public higher education.  Thanks to the efforts of our students who worked effectively with Assemblyman Cedillo, myself and other members of our campus community, we were able to ensure that the legislature in Sacramento passed AB 130 and AB 131 which Gov. Brown ultimately signed.  This example of successful and peaceful activism with students and campus leaders working together can guide us in how we can collaborate to effect real change that will benefit us all.  We share the aspirations of the Occupy movement for a better America.  I am confident that as a campus community we will find a peaceful and productive way forward.

Robert J. Birgeneau
Chancellor, UC Berkeley
