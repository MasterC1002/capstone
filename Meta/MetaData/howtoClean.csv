1335554088.0	svplv	TIL how to get results from any cable company. Details inside	GepettoZHog	456	78	64	"First off, a little background:

I live in New York, and have been dealing with the scourge that is Time Warner Cable. We were getting lousy speeds, and upgraded to the ""Extreme"" plan, which for $75 a month, gave us...the same crappy speeds. Since November,  when we upgraded, service has been intermittent and generally lousy. When I called to talk to TWC reps (repeatedly), they were nice...but not willing to do anything other than ""wait it out."" There were occasional service visits that resulted in no fixes (and one specific instance where the guy was ""missing"" for a while and showed up 6 hours late).

Further, trying to get any money out of them was like drawing blood from a stone. Weeks of failed communication and being ignored (and not having solid internet) took its toll.

**Today, I tried a different tactic, which got results within 20 minutes.** Here's what you do:

* Go look up the website of your local Public Service Commission. For NY, it's [here](http://www.dps.ny.gov/complaints.html).
* Fill out a complaint form. Provide specific information and examples if you have them.
* Immediately after doing this, call back your cable company. When the first person to take your call answers, tell them that you have an open claim with PSC concerning your account and would like to talk to the supervisor to resolve the issue.

Not only do you get to talk to the supervisor who is willing to help, but you're also likely to get a fair answer. An open case with PSC is pretty brutal for them, and also requires requires the cable company to follow up on EVERYTHING. It is in their best interests to get you to go away happy or otherwise, and be on their best behavior until the ticket is closed.

In my case, I argued that I was getting their lowest quality internet package ($29 a month) roughly half the time it was working at all. Subsequently, I argued that I should be paying only $15 for service like that, and since November, that's 6 months of ""that service."" I asked to be credited with the difference in the bill ($60) for each month.  

**TL;DR - I got $360 back from Time Warner for 5 months of subpar service.**"	t5_2qh69	True
1329810374.0	pz2pb	How to browse the Deepweb (aka Tor)	torthor	445	69	122	"Over the course of the past few years, I have heard a lot about the so-called ""Deepweb"". I've always been curious about it, but never taken the time to understand it until recently. Now that I've taken the plunge, I wish I had earlier. It's easy to get started, and it truly is a unique and intriguing place. I'll outline the steps to get started:

Download the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en). This package contains everything you need to run Tor on your machine.

 * Windows: Unzip the file, and run `Start Tor Browser.exe`
 * Linux: Untar the file, and run `start-tor-browser`
 * OSX: Just run `TorBrowser_en-US.app`

At this point, Tor will start running and a browser called Aurora will open up. This is just a standalone copy of Firefox which is pre-configured to work correctly with Tor. You must do all of your Deepweb browsing from this browser. If you are accessing the internet from a country that limits your internet access, you will notice that you now have access to the entire internet. You will also be browsing the internet in a true anonymous fashion - the onion routing capability of Tor will protect your ip address from servers and snoopers. So, feel free to just browse the regular internet anonymously - however that is just scratching the surface of the Deepweb. There is a lot more out there on ""Hidden Web Sites"".

A Hidden Web Site is any site that has a domain name that ends in "".onion"". These sites are different than regular websites, because not only is your ip address hidden from them, but their ip address is also hidden from you. This gives these sites leverage to host more freely - without fear that a repressive authority will find their servers and shut them down.

Because there is no central registrar, there is no single repository of all .onion sites. Many of them you just have to hear about through direct communication with other Tor users. However, there are a few great places to start (Open these links from the Tor browser):

 * [The Hidden Wiki](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - An excellent landing page to the onionland. There are many useful links here - but be wary: there are also links to scam sites.
 * [The Silk Road](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/) - I'm sure you've heard of it before - the place where you can buy many black market substances using Bitcoins. Even if you don't plan to buy anything, it's interesting to take a look around and see what's available.
 * [WikiLeaks](http://zbnnr7qzaxlk5tms.onion/) - A clone of wikileaks.
 * [RedditTor](http://k6gsb4ibatcico35.onion/) - A clone of reddit that is running in onionland. Yay open source!

Many people compare the Deepweb to the internet before AOL. It is much less populated - but the population is generally more technically savvy. You also have to watch out for scams and fraud - there is no regulation - so keep your wits about you.

I also found out about a program that only the University of Wisconsin offers right now where one is able to test out for a degree with no required class time or credits. I called the university and got the phone number for the program's advisors. I'm calling tomorrow as it is after normal business hours where I am right now. I'm very excited and so I hope that by posting this, others can take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to get a degree even if they have $1.77 to their name like I do right now. I sincerely wish the best of luck to everyone who chooses to do so.

Edit 1, 9:11PM CST - I will update after I call tomorrow after work (between 2 and 3ish my time).

Edit 2, 6:52PM CST - I wasn't able to call because I was sick today and hubby and I are also moving today and tomorrow. I will try to call tomorrow or the next day. Also, negativity from people who are inconsequential to my life and fail at reading comprehension."	t5_2qh69	True

This is part 2 of 3 that I have for helping redditors with jobs/resumees/interviews.  All the nuts and bolts are in the first [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/q8bu6/how_to_get_a_job_1_of_3_the_postingresume/)

I've broken it up into 3 bits, so it's a little easier to go through:  

1.  [The posting/resume](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/q8bu6/how_to_get_a_job_1_of_3_the_postingresume/)  
2.  [Before the interview](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/qijna/how_to_get_a_job_2_of_3_before_the_interview/)  
3.  **The interview and afterwards**  

This is the most stressful part of the process, and the one where things can go the most wrong.  These are some things that I've done myself, and what I've absorbed from the other half who works in HR, and has done more than her fair share of hiring.  


**The interview and afterwards**  

 - **PHONE.  OFF.**  
 - Be up front with what you can and can't do. If you say you're a Linux god, and you aren't, they're going to find out. If you're straightforward about that, they may be willing to look past it and give you some on the job training (unless, of course you're applying to be a Linux admin).  
 - Bring a notebook/pad of paper and a pen to make notes: FIRST NOTE: Names of the interviewers. Now you can look down, remember the name and say ""Good question Jennifer"". Now you have a connection with Jennifer, the HR lead who remebers you, because you remembered her.  
 - Bring 3-4 copies of your resume to the interview, and put them in a folder. If one of the interviewers has forgotten their copy say, I brought a few just in case...and now you're ""the prepared"" candidate.  
 - Use one of the resume copies to follow along with the interviewer in case they want to go through it line by line  
 - For your ""makes you look good"" story, you're looking for an opening, not the perfect opening.  You may only get 1 shot to work your story in.  
 - When a question is asked, identify what they're looking for.  *""Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a colleague""* isn't asking about the problem you had with Ted from accounting, it's asking how you **solved** that problem.  Tell both parts of that story.  
 - You know that thing you're awesome at? You're awesome at it because you do it all the time; the thing you suck at you never do. So get someone to ask you some interview questions and practice, ask for feedback and get better at interviewing, it's a skill.  
 - Clean yourself up. Make sure you're dressed for the part.  Wear a clean, unwrinkled shirt/blouse/top. Shave (beard, moustaches are OK, 49 hours growth isn't) and sit up straight. Do that and you're better than 2/3 of people who apply for entry level positions (even in ""professional offices"".)  
 - Pay attention, cell phone off...phone off...turn that goddamned phone off.  
 - You will probably get asked *How much do you expect to make?*  **Don't push this back on the interviewer.**  They asked because they want an answer, and it's very difficut to get *them* to answer it without coming off as confrontational.   Try to land in the middle and be reasonable.  Don't short change yourself, but don't ask for too much (this will take you out of the running.)  This comes up often, so so some research into the position/sallary range, have a a good answer ready.  
 - If you are already employed, answer the above with ""I make this much now **PLUS** this much in yearly bonus/stock options/preformance bonus/whatever else"".  
 - Make sure to ask when they expect to make a decision, that way you won't freak out by not knowing, and you can follow up a week or so past that deadline.  
 - And finally, don't talk shit about...well anyone really. No one wants to be around the guy who has a shitty outlook on life and points out the bad things. If your last job sucked, say it was a challenging work environment and you're looking for a better experience then move on.  

**After the interview**

 - Send a followup email. Just something along the lines of ""Thanks for your time, I really enjoyed meeting with you and find this opportunity very exciting."" It takes 2 minutes, can break the tie between 2 candidates.  
 - If you didn't get the job, be gracious.  Thank them for the experience and their time.  Tell them that they work for a great company that you're still interested in working for.  It will never hurt to be nice.  Mistakes are made and sometimes the winning candidate leaves after 2 weeks, or turns out to be an ass and doesn't pass their probation period.  I've had that happen, and I called the other guy to ask if he was still interested (he was).  If he had whined or bitched I wouldn't have.

1328375038.0	par8f	"Why you should (and how to) taste a bottle of wine in a restaurant.
"	la_collectionneuse	341	85	86	"I thought I'd jump on this one as I just got home from work at a restaurant where this has been an ongoing topic of discussion. When the restaurant first opened, all bottles of wine ordered were opened by the bartender or wine director and checked to make sure they were good before taking to the table. The reasoning behind this was, the owners of the restaurant knew that not everyone was comfortable with the ceremony of checking a bottle and they wanted to create a casual atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that people were getting a good bottle of wine. (There's nothing worse than opening a bottle at a table, knowing the moment you pull the cork that it's bad, but having the person tasting approve it because they don't know what they're doing.)

So here's my two cents, for what it's worth (and several of these points have been touched upon in recent posts):

You taste wine at the table to make sure that it's ""good"". For those of us less sophisticated oneophiles, that means that the wine is not ""corked"". Corked wine will smell just like what it sounds like - rotten cork. It can sometimes be subtle, but oftentimes, it's pretty obvious. This is different from smelling ferrous, or earthy. It's a very off-putting smell and once you've smelled it, you don't forget it. You are not tasting / smelling the wine to make sure that you like it. If you have ordered the bottle and the bottle of wine is not defective (eg: corked) you are expected to accept the bottle. The understanding here being: you either know what you're ordering or, if you know nothing about wine, there is someone you can ask for guidance (the server or sommelier). If you detect a defect that is not cork, chances are you don't need to read this post.

If the list is unfamiliar to you or if you just don't know a lot about wine, I would suggest asking someone to help make a recommendation for you. Some questions they may ask that will help to narrow down their recommendations might be:

Red or white? (Obvious)

Do you want something full-bodied, medium bodied, or light-bodied? (This refers to the weight / viscosity of the wine. Depending on what you're eating, you may have a preference - lighter wines tend to pair better with lighter, or leaner fare. Fuller bodied wines tend to pair better with heavier, oftentimes, meatier fare.)

Do you want something brighter or rounder? (Brightness usually refers to acidity. Acidity develops in regions that have cold nights. That's why wines from northern regions typically have higher levels of acidity than wines from warmer, southern regions. Some people describe high acid wines as being sharp or sour, however, acidity can be a great complement to rich, fatty foods, as the acid in the wine helps cut through the fat. High acid wines are also a great compliment to seafood and citrus.)

Do you want something dry or fruity? (Dry denotes tannins. An extremely tannic wine will make your mouth feel dry or gritty when you drink it. I think these wines are best had with food - they're not often casual sipping wines. Wines that are more ""fruit-forward"" will generally be softer, more lush, juicy, and sometimes, with a bit of perceived sweetness.)

Other things to keep in mind:

The language of wine is complex. It might sound like bullshit if you're just getting started, but wine is fun to explore and you should experiment with it to find out what you really like. Your tastes will inevitably change the more you learn. When in doubt, try to choose a wine from the same region as whatever food your eating. If you're eating a pasta from Liguria, chances are, a wine from that region will compliment it well! Sometimes the way a wine smells and looks will be very different from how it tastes. Most of the time, smell and look can provide you with important clues about taste.

You will come to differentiate fruit profiles (fresh bright red fruits like pomegranate or cranberry / red cherry / black cherry / plum / brambleberry: blackberry, raspberry / stewed or dried fruit / raisin or prune - in the case of reds) and for whites (stone fruits like apricot, nectarine, peach / citrus like lemon, lime, lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel / orchard fruits like apple - red,yellow, and green, pear / melons / tropical fruits like guava, mango, kiwi).

And other flavor profiles you might consider: For whites (grassy, green, mossy, hay, petrol, oyster shell, sea salt, white flowers). For reds (iron, blood, leather, tobacco, peaty, smokey, violets, roses, herbs). None of these are hard and fast - there are a million different things you can smell and taste in a wine and many of them are somewhat subjective, as our palates are all a bit different. Some of the above descriptors for whites can readily be applied to reds and vice versa. Minerality in a wine typically reflects the land the grapes were grown in. It could be limestoney, clayey, volcanic, seashelly, etc.

There's a difference between ripe fruit flavors and secondary (or baked / stewed / dried) fruit flavors. Some wines are spicy - either hot like cinnamon red hots or warm like cardamom, nutmeg, clove.

Some wines taste great paired with some foods and awful paired with others. A good rule of thumb is to choose a wine with flavor profiles that are either consistent with what you are eating, or complimentary to them. Think about it in terms of condiments. Red wine with fish or other light dishes is often a fail because it's overpowering and doesn't help the food you're eating. Similarly, light wine can lose its luster next to heavy, saucy meat dishes.

Now, for what you're supposed to do and why:

First step: LOOK at the wine.

Hold your glass at an angle (over a white tablecloth or paper will help) and look at the color of the wine. This will give you an indication of its age, weight and fruit profile. Older wines tend towards the rustier end of the spectrum. Younger wines will have a more vibrant color. Lighter wines will be more translucent while fuller bodied wines will be more opaque. Purple hued wines will tend to be on the plummy / blackberry side, while red hued wines will tend more towards red fruits - typically cherry or, if lighter, pomegranate or cranberry. For whites, very pale wines will tend to be lean, higher in acidity, more citrus-y while more golden colored wines will tend to be rounder, fattier, with riper fruit.

Next Step: SMELL the wine

This will, in most cases, tell you if the wine is bad. As I said before, cork is a terrible smell. Your wine should be pleasant smelling - that could mean anything from incense to dried flowers to grass to plums to tobacco to leather. It should not smell rotten. If you are drinking a still wine, swirl it briefly and tilt the glass to the side as you sniff it. Never swirl a sparkling wine, silly!!!!

Final Step: TASTE the wine.

Oh boy, best part! Yum! There are many methods for tasting but I won't outline them here because I don't want your friends to think you're a total jerk when you taste wine at a table. If you get really serious about tasting wine, you'll figure these things out. Just take a sip! Even if it's not your most favorite wine ever, if the bottle is good and you're with good friends having good food, you win. And if you pay attention to what you're drinking, maybe you will make a more informed choice next time. Or maybe you love it! Congrats! It's just wine, afterall, not rocket science!

The last thing I have to say about tasting wine in a restaurant: Don't be an asshole. The classiest way to taste is to swirl and sniff and give the nod of approval (provided the wine is ok.) Save the full on examination for after you've given the thumbs up that the bottle is good.

Some people take wine way too seriously. Wine is meant to be enjoyed. If you're not having a good time, you're doing it wrong. Some of the most knowledgeable wine people I know are also the most easy going when it comes to tasting. Over analysing a bottle at the table is a red flag that immediately says you don't know what you're doing. So relax. Savor. The more you drink, the more you learn! Be adventurous!

Best to everyone in their explorations of wine and please, if you have anything to add, do so!

**TL;DR: Swirl, sniff. If it's not corked, you bought it.**"	t5_2qh69	True

1. [Go here](http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/). The colours are based on the [Bortle Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_Dark-Sky_Scale) for sky brightness/light polution. Find where you live and locate the nearest patch of land that has either a blue, black or grey tint to it. Reason being that those colours represent the last two panels in [this image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gtno7TdEu4s/TKomyG7WfOI/AAAAAAAAAT8/qH37y4JsFWA/s1600/bortle1.jpg), which means the night sky is so bright that it can cast shadows. Green is pretty decent as well, but when I went to a green area on a clear night I wasn't able to see the milky way.

2. Having located where you are going to go, make a note of the location/coordiantes and check out [this website](http://cleardarksky.com/csk/). Find that same location and look at the stargazing forecast map for the next few days. The data comes from Environment Canada, but it shows all of the US as well. By taking into account several factors like clouds, particles in the atmosphere and ""seeing"" ability, you can tell when the absolute best time of the best day would be. Dark blue across all of the top three markers is the absolute ideal stargazing situation, but even a standard blue or two or a teal is okay.

As an example: say you lived in Syracuse. Well, from the first map, I'd say the best possible option would be to go out into the Adirondacks, ideally near Raquette Lake. Looks like there's a campground in the area, so maybe you can make a weekend of it. [As per wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquette_Lake), the coordinates are 43°50′N 74°39′W. 

Now we head over to the second page and pop the coordinates into the pink box. Looks like the [Wakely Mountain location is pretty close](http://cleardarksky.com/cgi-bin/find_chart.py?type=llmap&amp;Mn=astronomy&amp;olat=&amp;olong=&amp;olatd=43&amp;olatm=50&amp;olongd=74&amp;olongm=39&amp;unit=1), and from the colour under the ""Light Polution"" heading, we can see that this site agrees with the other one on the potential for sky visibility. So, we click that one and it brings us to the page for this specific site so that we can take a look at the characteristics of the sky for the next few days.

Now you can see why a couple of lighter coloured squares is detrimental in the descriptions of ""Cloud Cover,"" ""Transparency"" and ""Seeing"" below. In all honesty though, this site was created for people who are taking a telescope out to look at details of the night sky. You're going to see dots no matter what on a clear night with the naked eye, so you probably don't need to worry about [""Seeing""](http://weather.gc.ca/astro/seeing_e.html) as long as it's not going to be terrible.

If you want to learn more or watch neat animations of this info like [this one for transparency](http://weather.gc.ca/astro/imageview/viewImages_e.html?urlpath=/data/prog/regional&amp;Type=ANIMATE&amp;TITLE=Sky_Transparency_Forecast&amp;start=3&amp;end=48&amp;format=png&amp;imagename=00_054_R1_north@america@astro_I_ASTRO_transp) (not cloud cover, mind you) go to [Environment Canada's site](http://weather.gc.ca/astro/index_e.html) and take a look at where all this data is coming from."	t5_2qh69	True

- Made from recycled material

- Light weight compared to the real stuff

- Looks just as cool 

- Can be designed to fit perfectly

Disadvantages

- Will not save your life in battle 

This is what I made:  http://i.imgur.com/ZBIJz.jpg
	


What you will need:

•	Large amount of tabs (amount depends on the size of the project)

•	Several spools of 5/8” ribbon. You could also use thick yarn or strips of fabric (color of your choice)

•	Scissors

•	Needle nose pliers

•	Any kind of tape


1.	First you need to collect the tabs, which honestly is the most difficult part of the whole thing. Ask everyone you know to save the tabs for you. Once you have a large amount of tabs you can move to step 2. 

2.	Please don’t skip this step!!! You need to wash the tabs! If you do not wash the tabs they will eventually grow mold from left over beer and pop all over them.  I just put the tabs in a strainer and used dish soap to clean them which worked just fine. Let the tabs air dry completely.

3.	You also need to clean up the sharp edges of the tabs that look like this:  http://imgur.com/hTQzM.jpg 
(To do this I use needle nose pliers and flatten down the sharp part) 

4.	Measure your yarn or ribbon to be about ½ the length longer than the pattern:  http://imgur.com/86fFo.jpg 
(I don’t really have a pattern for the tab armor that I made but you can easily make your own pattern by using clothes that you already have)

5.	Tape the end of the ribbon or yarn to make it easier to thread through the tabs: http://imgur.com/POWiX.jpg 

6.	Complete one “stitch” :
•	Take 3 tabs and hold them like this:   http://imgur.com/0TkdF.jpg        
•	Then take your ribbon and pull it up through the bottom like this (pull it almost to the end of the ribbon leaving about 2 inches at the end):   http://imgur.com/7fr15.jpg              
•	Then pull your ribbon down through the top like this:  http://imgur.com/DMxqi.jpg 

7.	Now repeat step 6 by adding one tab at a time and continue weaving in and out like this: http://imgur.com/PlA2l.jpg 

8.	Once you have created two long strips of tabs, you can now connect them by either doing the same stitch which will look like this and be slightly stiffer:  http://i.imgur.com/LycqY.jpg
Or you can stitch them together like this which will allow it to move more and will be more comfortable for something like a skirt: http://i.imgur.com/NuF7M.jpg
To do the second stitch I aligned the faces of the two strips of tabs: http://imgur.com/Rf7oP.jpg   &amp; http://imgur.com/TWuoQ.jpg 
Then stitch the ribbon in through the back and out the front:  http://imgur.com/LyoEP.jpg 
When you unfold the tabs it will look like this: http://i.imgur.com/VYb3w.jpg 

9.	Tie off the ends of the ribbon and attach the pieces together. 

You can line the chainmail with fabric to make it more comfortable. I used fleece to line the chainmail by hand sewing the fleece to the tabs.
 
If this “how to” is confusing at all (which it probably is cause I suck at explaining things) feel free to ask any questions. Also if you do end up making chainmail please send me a picture because I would love to see how it turned out! 

P.S. Once you get the hang of working with the tabs, you can make lots of different things like hats, belts, purses and who knows what else.

1330364303.0	q8bu6	How to:  Get a job 1 of 3, the posting/resume.	Kayge	298	55	67	"I've seen a number of posts/comments in the past few weeks with people looking for help with jobs/resumes/interviews.  So while I'm not a hiring professional I've been on the interviewer side of the table, and the other half works in HR so I've learned tones through osmosis.   I started writing, and ended up with a wall of text (which I've tried to pare down).  I'm going to break it up into 3 bits, and post 1 a week so it's a little easier to go through:  

1.  **The posting/resume:**  
2.  Before the interview  
3.  The interview and afterwards  

I'm doing this because people are starting to apply (and businesses are starting to think about) summer students and hiring new grads, and I remember how much it sucked looking for the first job, so I'm hoping to help out.  

Finally, most of the hiring I've done is in IT, so it's biased that way.  Try to take the spirit if not the exact context.  

**The posting/resume:**  

 - Look everywhere.  With the way the economy has gone, a lot of SMB's are posting on Craigslist to save on the high cost of posting on a larger job-board.  
 - The employer will ask for everything possible in the posting, but they know that finding someone with 5 years experience in SQL, Office 2010, Windows7, Ubuntu 10.10, and Remedy isn't going to happen, so they will trade 1 skill for another (especially in the nice to have areas).  
- Often times when requirements are flushed out, IT asks for 5 years experience in Windows desktop.  HR looks at their computer, and they're using Windows 7 so you get a requirement of ""5 years with Windows 7"" posts.  They're not looking for someone who was on the Win7 dev team and are generally looking for 5 years experience with Windows.  Don't freak out over version numbers.  
 - They want someone with experience, but will often look past it if there are other skills. They asked for 2 years experience...you have 6 months, and ran the computer lab in University...that could be enough.  
 - 7 years experience generally means 5 years experience.  
 - 5 years experience generally means 3 years experience.  
 - 3 years experience generally means you've seen it before and played with it for 6 months.   
- Some (in my experience better) companies hire more for fit (personality) than skills.  Sometimes the 6 months isn't even necessary if you can make your resume and personality stand  
out.  
 - Postings tend to happen cycle quickly, so don't think I'll apply tomorrow. If it ends up on Monster or workopolis, they'll get a **couple hundred** resumes in a day, then HR will pull the  
listing to minimize their workload.  
 - Get a LinkedIn profile and keep it up to date (log in twice a month.) I've received a number of emails from headhunters and got my current job through it. For the amount of effort involved it's well worth the time.  
 - Post your resume on as many sites as you can, make it searchable.  
 - Tailor your resume for the job, each job is different, update your resume to speak to the skill set they're asking for.  
 - A resume is there to give a snapshot of who you are, and to get your foot in the door.  Be brief and give highlights.  The real sell is in the interview.  
 - Take a look at the posting and steal their language. **VERY important**...If their posting has: *Anticipate, identify, track and resolve issues and risks affecting the application.*  Put *Served business leaders by anticipating, identifying, tracking and resolving application issues and risks* in your resume (as long as it's true).  Don't do this the whole way through, but a couple of lines are great; now HR can present you because you have exactly skill X that they're looking for.  
 - Get someone else to look over your resume to spot your mistakes and make suggestions.  In a perfect world you'll find someone who cares more about the resume than your immediate feelings.  A resume is a very personal thing, and you'll likely end up pissed off by the time you're done.  Get past it.  
 - Your resume should be made up of bullet points, not stories.  
 - Where numbers are available, use them (*Increased sales by 50% by cross selling to new markets*).  
 - If you are going with a standard resume, the rule of thumb is no more than 2 pages.  This is a good rule, stick to it.  
 - If you have the chops to pull off something different, make sure you knock it out of the park.  One of the first, and still one of the best is [Michael Anderson](http://www.google.ca/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1008&amp;bih=580&amp;q=michael+anderson+resume&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=michael+anderson+resume&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-S1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=3&amp;gs_upl=10373l13521l0l13680l23l22l0l6l6l0l185l1482l5.8l13l0).  This works because he can show off his skills in the format of his resume, and he knows his audience.  
 - I've seen a few resumes on PowerPoint/keynote which have worked out well.  These should be no more than 1 page.  
 - If you're using a program other than word to create your resume, save it as something that everyone can open (like pdf.)  The Design group will be able to open PSD's, HR may not.  
 - Each job is different, and your resume should change to reflect that.  I've said that twice now.  It must be important.  
 - And finally a brilliant tip from [madoxster] 
(http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/h4upl/any_other_students_having_a_really_hard_time_with/c1sm46y).  *""In your past job history, don't simply state things like 'Implemented APIs in PHP' or 'Wrote stored procedures in mysql'. That’s equivalent to saying 'I can tie my shoe'.  Explain what problem you were solving, how did your stored procedure solve it, stuff like that.  It only has to be one sentence, but give me something. That’s what I look for, so I know who to call in for interview....Don't take menial Joe jobs and pretty them up to sound impressive. Its obvious and immediately makes me think less of your resume. It’s fine to just state the Joe jobs without the fluff.*  "	t5_2qh69	True

The algorithm can be simple, and every website will generate a new one.

Here is an example:

1. take the name of the website i want to log into:
google

2. take the first letter, and type all the characters on the keyboard in that column. from top to bottom:
5tgb

3. then take the second letter, and type all the characters in that column, from bottom to top:
.lo9

4. put those two strings together:
5tgb.lo9

5. you now have a random password, that takes no memorization, and can be recalled as quick as you can look at the keyboard.

However, this algorithm is very simple, I encourage you to think of a better one, use it, and not tell anyone. Some ways it could be improved:

* to be more random (brute force attempts incorporate some patterns, like ""asd"")

* to include capital letters

* to guarantee to include symbols

* to be longer

* take care of special cases (some websites don't allow some symbols, or password lengths)

* to work on mobile phones, where the keyboard may be layout differently, especially with regards to symbols

I have been using an algorithm like this for over a year and it works amazingly. Every password of mine is different, and I haven't memorized any of them.  Muscle memory kicks in after a few days and it is as simple and quick to type these passwords as it is type ""easy to remember"" passwords.

It used to take me an hour or so to fall asleep, but these days, I've got it down to maybe 2 or 3 minutes on average.  Here are the steps I took that have worked really well for me.

* Avoid any actions or thoughts that make your adrenaline surge for an hour or so before bedtime.  No arguing, no fisticuffs, no violent video games or sitting around pondering what objects in the room you would use to defend yourself in the event of zombies.  This can take some discipline but it gets easier with practice.

* Gradually reduce the light levels around you as you get closer to your bedtime.  No bright light for at least a half hour beforehand if you can manage it.  Your body is pre-programmed to get sleepy in the dark.  When I'm eating a late dinner, I just use one lamp to provide the light.

* No sugars, alcohol, or fats for an hour before bed, and keep the carbohydrates to a minimum.  I'd probably avoid nicotine too.  Lean protein has been the best for me.  This can make a HUGE difference.

* Create a bedtime ritual.  Do it every single night before bed to reinforce to your subconscious mind that you are approaching bedtime.  I usually shower, floss, and brush, and then go immediately to bed.

So now you've got yourself in a calm, peaceful state, you've gone through your ritual, and you're laying on your pillow... now what?

First off, this is not the time to think deep thoughts!  Right before bed you are tired, and it's dark, and it is a particularly bad time to be thinking about nearly anything.  Thoughts have a different feel at night.  Everything is more serious, more grave, more somber.  It's just because of the circumstances, though.  The best time to think about things is when you're awake, and alert, and feeling ready for action.  Bedtime is for sleeping.  That's it.

One of the best ways to fall asleep I've ever found is by running through some complex mechanical task in my mind in as much detail as I could.  Rebuilding the carb on my dirt bike or doing mountain bike maintenance were the ones that worked the best.  Don't just run through a checklist of the steps- really picture yourself there, performing every action.  Think about picking up the tools, setting down each part, etc.  The more detail, the better.

I personally don't read right before bed anymore, and if I do, I do it before I start my bedtime ritual.  It's too easy to keep reading just one more page until you've wasted an hour.

Hopefully some of this is helpful to those of you out there who have trouble getting to sleep.  It can take some work at first, but it is absolutely, definitely worth it.  As it gets easier, you'll look forward to bedtime more, and it sets up an upward spiral.

EDIT- One last thing: I find it helps me to cool off a bit before climbing under the covers.  I can't sleep at all if I'm even a little bit warm.  I think this may be one of those things that varies a lot from person to person, though."	t5_2qh69	True

----

MS (Memory Store): stores the currently displayed number in the memory.

MC (Memory Clear): erases the number stored in the memory.

MR (Memory Recall): displays the current number stored in the memory.

M+ (Add to Memory): adds the currently displayed number to the number in the memory and stores this sum as the new number in the memory.

M- (Subtract from Memory): subtracts the currently displayed number from the number in the memory and stores this result as the new number in the memory.

-----

Example:

(480 + 5)/6 - 3(20 - 3) + (5 - 7)

1. Calculate (480 + 5)/6. Press MS (or M+ as the starting number in the memory should be 0).

2. Calculate 3(20 - 3). Press M-.

3. Calculate 5 - 7. Press M+.

4. Press MR to see the final result.

5. Press MC to clear the memory.

6. ?????

7. Profit!!!

So imagine this:  You're on a date, or in a potentially romantic situation, and then that moment happens. That moment where you're maybe a bit closer together and the conversation slows to a halt...and you're (especially guys) thinking ''so...is it go time?''  This can be fucking stressful! Especially if you really care about this working out. 

So here's my trick: When somebody wants to kiss you, they look at your lips...A LOT. It's a subconscious thing, but if they're thinking about kissing you, they'll be looking at what's on their mind. 
Now, there's a critical distinction to make here:We often look at people's mouths when they talk, so that doesn't count. This trick is for when the conversation dies, and nobody is talking. 

Also, we' re assuming that there's nothing weird (food, cold sores, grillz, etc) going on with your mouth that they're looking at just because...well, because we like to look at weird shit. 

So there ya go. I know it's not any huge revelation, but hopefully it will help somebody out.

What about those companies that simply refuse to remove you from their lists?
Here's a simple way to get yourself removed that only takes about 10 minutes. Google the company and terms like president, board of directors, cto, ceo, cfo, and any other important title you can think of.

Gather up a list of the names and create email addresses based on them. So if Mike Hunt is the CEO of domain.com, his email is likely mhunt@domain.com (note: if this address fails try things like mike.hunt@domain.com).

Forward the spam you've received from this company to the email addresses you've collected letting them know that their company is in violation of federal CANSPAM laws. Tell them they have 24 hours to notify you that you have been removed from their mailing lists. If they fail to respond, you take that as acceptance of your emailing policy and you will begin signing them up for every newsletter you can find (pick the good ones, the ones that never remove you, no matter what, kind of like the current company you are emailing).

I have had CEO's of multimillion dollar businesses respond to my emails asking me to stop signing them up for newsletters (I kind told him that I would stop as soon as his company stopped). I've had frantic after hours emails from marketing departments begging me to stop emailing their Board. I've had email marketing companies cuss me for getting their contracts cancelled.

tldr;

1. Receive spam from real company

2. Gather email addresses for import people in said company

3. Email them asking to be removed

4. Sign them up for as many newsletters as you can find

**Torrent**

You'll need two things -- a torrent client and the .torrent file or magnet link from a trusted source that will provide the client with the needed information to hook up with other users and begin downloading.

If you're looking for a client, [µTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) is a very popular and lightweight client for all platforms. I myself prefer [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) (linux/mac only). [Here's a list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/y39vb/utorrent_becomes_adsupported_to_rake_in_millions/c5ry6hq) Don't be a jerk, seed to at bare minimum 1:1 ratio, and 1:2 down/up normally.

**Open directories**

Open directories are simply unprotected folders that have been left open to the public (be it intentionally or accidentally). Huge pots of files can be found all across the web full of pictures, music, videos, porn, whatever. Once you find an open directory, you can either click on the wanted files one by one to download or grab them all at once using wget (available on all platforms, tutorial [here](http://www.regravity.com/documents/Wget%20%96%20A%20Noob%92s%20guide%20-%20Regravity.com.pdf)). /r/opendirectories is an awesome reddit to subscribe to, and the community will be a good place to ask questions or get help with wget.

To search for files in open directories, you will use a custom Google search. Knowing how to use [search operators](http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html) is helpful but not necessary.
You want pages containing ""index of"" in the title. You do not want HTML pages, so you eliminate pages containing ""html"", ""htm"", or ""php"". Put the type of files you want to end up with in quotes (for example, ""mp3"" or ""epub""). You end up with a search looking like [this](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=queen+news+of+the+world+%22.mp3%22+-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+-inurl%3Aphp+intitle%3A%22Index+of%22+-site%3Awallywashis.name&amp;cad=h).

If you want to use wget, here is my usual command:

    wget -e robots=off -r --no-parent -c --limit-rate=150k [url here, no brackets]

remove --limit-rate=150k or change the number if you like, I use that so wget doesn't hog all of my bandwidth and so I can continue browsing whilst using it.

**File-hosting sites**

[Filestube](http://www.filestube.com/) searches Mediafire, Rapidshare, Filefactory, and other sites (see the advanced search option for a full list). I've found filestube to be far superior to its rivals, which tend to only search a few of the big sites.

1375902809.0	1jwi8c	How to Dance	finalxcution	262	65	19	"I've been looking at Youtube tutorials on how to dance for the past few months. Definitely the best decision I've ever made.  I've gotten so good at it that I'm usually the best dancer in the club now (Not hard considering 90% of people who go don't actually know how to dance).  You don't need any special kind of talent or athletic ability either.  I've turned friends with zero dancing experience into pretty decent dancers within an hour. I've seen overweight dudes busting it out on the dance floor.  **Anyone can do it.**

At first, you'll probably want to do this somewhere you can be alone to avoid being self-conscious. You don't really need a mirror when you're starting out either. You just need to learn how to get in the groove and be comfortable. Pop some earbuds in, put on your favorite music, listen to the beat, and practice some basic moves. It's very therapeutic.

First thing you need to learn how to do is to listen to the beat of whatever music you're listening to.  It's usually the drum or bass in the background and remains steady throughout the song.  **The secret to dancing is to simply match your movements to the beat.**  You can move however the hell you like - as long as it fits with the beat.  As a beginner exercise, listen to the drums in [Another One Bites the Dust](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE) and bob your head to it. Easy isn't it?  Next, while still bobbing your head, move your hips side to side on each beat.  Got it?  Congratulations, you can now officially follow a beat.  As long as you can recognize and move to it,  you can dance to anything.

Now for the actual dancing.  Easiest way would probably be to start off with hip hop style moves like the [two-step](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3QrP1kiRko), [shoulder lean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QRBu44TKyc) and [kick-step](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wwxl4jjrXaM) and progress from there. They're ridiculously easy and you can dance to pretty much any song with them while at the same time, looking like you know what you're doing.

Once you got the basics down, check out other genres of dancing and see what you like the best.  

* If you like techno/electronic/dubstep, I'd look up shuffling, popping, liquid, and jump style.

* If you like latin music, I'd look up salsa, cha-cha, and mambo. A lot of latin style dancing requires a partner 
though so you may need to find a local bar or club to do it in.

* If you like hip-hop/r&amp;b, you'll want bboy, popping, locking, turfing, krumping, and jerkin.

* Rock and metal music doesn't really have a dance style as it mainly just involves jumping up and down, fist pumps, and head bobs.

* There's also swing dancing which usually involves a partner like in lindy hop, charleston, jive, and west coast swing.

Personally, I took a stab at all of them just to add to my move repertoire so now I can dance to any music at any time. 

Plus, as you get more and more advanced, you get some insane workouts out of dancing without even thinking about it. As you get more skilled and your body gets fitter, your self-confidence levels will shoot through the roof. So even if you don't ever plan to dance in public, you'll still feel the effects of it in your daily life.  You won't regret it."	t5_2qh69	True

It probably has to do with wearing dress pants and a button up shirt most days.  I walk or ride my bike to work and am usually sweating by the time I get to work.  Then it’s just stuffy enough in the office to keep me sweaty all day.

It doesn’t help that I sit most of the day.  The chair doesn’t breathe and my pants seem to form a sauna.

I’ve always suffered from “swamp ass”.  I’ve tried everything.  Here are a few things I’ve done to stop it.

A cold burst – End your shower with a cold burst.  A lot of times I get out of a hot shower and am actually sweating.  It seems like I can never stop sweating in the morning if I do this.  I love hot showers, but have to have a cold burst at the end to cool off.  Then I dry off and stay dry.  Which leads me to…

Start dry – After showering in the morning, make sure that you’re completely dried off down there.  Use a blow dryer if you have to.  This makes a huge difference.  If you start the day damp, then throw on some stuffy pants, you’ll never get dry on your own.  Then once you’re dry apply…

Gold Bond – Gold Bond is basically baby powder for adults.  It has menthol in it and feels like sitting on a block of ice.  Make sure you’re dry when you sprinkle some on though or else you’ll have a mess.  Gold Bond is best used with…

Moisture wicking underwear – Get the good kind.  I always grew up wearing regular boxers.  They’d bunch up and be a sweaty mess.  Then someone told me about moisture wicking boxer briefs.  I tried them out and never went back.  They keep you cool, reduce chafing, and are very comfortable.  All of these things work, but are nothing compared to having…

A fan – This is by far the best way to keep cool all day and avoid swamp ass.  I bought a small desk fan the other day and it’s amazing.  Everybody should have one of these at their desks.  The thing was six bucks, but has completely changed my life.  There’s just something about having a constant breeze on me that makes a huge difference.  It keeps me cool and keeps the air from feeling stuffy.

Any other ideas?

For those who do not wish to log in in order to view what might be inappropriate material on YouTube, there is a very simple bypass.

For example Mr. Ghetto - Walmart has a content warning:

By changing the url to this:

You can bypass the warning. :)

1. Wash eggy first! Then place the *still-in-shell,* uncooked egg [in the center and on top of the coffee grounds.](http://imgur.com/4Oge7.jpg) 
2. As soon as the coffee is done, or a minute or two after, [pull the egg out](http://imgur.com/zRSXY.jpg) (careful, it's very hot) and run it under cool water. 
3. [Peel and enjoy with your cup of coffee!](http://imgur.com/uJTBM.jpg)

The first step if you have any friends or family that buy things from Amazon is to make an account [here.](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)

The next step is to find out if any of your friends have an associate account or are willing to make one for your purchases.

HOW TO BUY CORRECTLY:

Do you have a friend who has an associate account?

Yes - 

* Take a link such as this http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/

* Get a tag and save it some place so you can use it. Mine is eonstuf-20 for example so I will show with that.

* Add ?tag=eonstuf-20 at the end

* [http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/?tag=eonstuf-20](http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/?tag=eonstuf-20)

* Now a percentage of your purchase goes to your friends account so they get a small percentage of what you payed

No - 

* Take a link such as this http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/

* Add ?tag=childsplaycha-20 at the end

* Now a percentage of your purchase goes to Child's Play, a charity

Any time someone buys from amazon without one of these they are denying either their friend of free money or a charity of some money.

I shape coded the numbers to better show the set up and added my own way to arrange the addition in the later steps.

The Procedure:
1) Lay out the numbers as shown in a grid formation.
2) Multiply each grid intersection.
3) Add the columns together vertically.
4) From right to left add the first (or first two) number(s) from each column to the value next to it.
5) Carry down the final values to reveal the final value!

Here's a YouTube video showing the procedure (not me):

1331768423.0	qwyao	As requested: How to give your guitar a professional paint job.	Riemann_Solution	158	32	27	"So 17 hours ago I created this account and posted a pic of my guitar's [new paint job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qvfz1/finished_painting_my_guitar_what_do_you_think/) Reddit approved, and I got a few requests for a how to, so here it goes (I'm gunna try to make this idiot-proof):

[Here's](http://imgur.com/7RRn7) a before picture, and [here's](http://imgur.com/plgzS) after.

**Things you'll need:**
Go out and buy these things. Home depot will have most of the stuff, but not all.

* Your guitar (Like I said... idiot-proof)
* The highest grit sanding sponge you can find 
* Mask, to shield yourself from death
* One can of spray primer
* 1 can of lacquer spray paint for each color you want
* 3 cans of lacquer clear  spray paint
* 3M perfect-it rubbing compound (gotta order this online)
* 3M perfect-it swirl mark remover (online as well)
* 600, 800, 1200, 1500, etc... grit wet sandpaper
* 2"", and optionally fine-line, masking tape
* Exact-o knife
* 2x2 block of wood
* [Screw-on hook thingy](http://photo-dictionary.com/photofiles/list/6181/8142screw_hook.jpg)

**Things to know:** First and foremost, this will take a long time (like months). It took me a year and a half to paint my baby from start to finish, mostly because of laziness and having to drive to my parents' house to paint. Also **don't mix brands of paint!!!** If you do, expect to see cracks in your finish. Don't paint outside, or somewhere where small particles float around (I made this mistake, and now my guitar has wood shavings embedded in it). Don't spray paint without a mask! And open a window for god sakes! Finally, don't paint while on fire. If you're on fire, you're doing it wrong.

**1. Disassemble your guitar:** Use a screwdriver to disassemble your guitar. Put the pieces in appropriately labeled zip-lock bags and store them somewhere. Make sure to label where each wire is connected. If your guitar's neck detaches, **make a note of how high the bottom of the neck sits off of the body!** For mine, it was 3.99 16ths of an inch. [Example.](http://imgur.com/gJNk1)

**2. Sanding the paint:** The layers of paint on your guitar are like so: paint-&gt;primer-&gt;wood grain finish-&gt;wood. Start sanding your guitar with the sanding sponge (use your mask). Once you see silver, you've hit the primer. Sand the primer off, but no more! If you do it right, your guitar will be smooth like Pootie Tang. If it's rough to the touch, you've sanded past the wood grain finish, and you'll have to paint on some more of your own finish (I didn't have to do this, so you're on your own here.) [Here's](http://imgur.com/Qjz2Q) mine halfway through sanding. Notice the silver primer on the edge of the red paint.

**3. Mask off the neck socket and binding:** So yea, mask off the neck socket and binding. I didn't mask off the binding on mine, but you would use your fine-line masking tape to do this. Make sure you do a good job of masking the neck socket- If paint cakes on anywhere there, you won't be able to reattach your neck exactly as it was before.

**4. Whip out the hook 'n stick:** Take your 2x2 stick and cut it to about arm's length. Screw in the large hook to one end. Screw on the other end to the guitar as if it were the neck. The purpose of this stick is to 1)  hang the guitar while it's drying, and 2) to have something to hold on to while you're painting. You can see how I attached the stick [here.](http://imgur.com/W3Va7)

**5. Modify the wood:** If you're planning on putting in new hardware, I highly recommend drilling any holes you need before you start spraying. I had to file down the holes that the volume and tone pots fed through, but I did it after I finished painting. I ended up peeling off some of the finish doing this, but thankfully the knobs covered up my mistake.

**6. Learn the spraying method:** For the parts that involve spraying, you need to know how to do it the right way. The nozzle should be about a foot away from the guitar at all times. Too close, and you'll get runs - too far away and the paint will dry before it hits your guitar, giving the paint a rough texture. Start spraying away from the guitar, not while you're aiming at it. Make horizontal passes over the guitar, taking about 1 second per pass. Each pass should overlap half of the previous pass. If paint starts running, stop painting, let it dry a little, sand the run down, then keep painting. Spray the sides first, then the back/front. 

**7. Spray the primer:** Using the above spraying technique, spray on the primer. Look on the can to see how many minutes to wait between coats. 

**8. Spray the base coat:** Your base coat should be the lightest color you're using. If this is your only color, skip to step 13. (Note: when you're spraying your colors, don't expect to get a full color on the first coat- Since your spray passes are 1s long, you'll barely be covering the guitar. You won't get the color you want until your 4th or 5th coat. Working slow like this is the best way to avoid runs. I didn't get a single run when I painted my guitar.)

**9. Mask your guitar and slice it:** Using the 2"" masking tape, tape over the entire guitar. Draw whatever design you want with pencil, and with your exact-o knife cut out the sections that should be colored with the 2nd and 3rd color.

**10. Spray the second color:** herp derp. This color should be your next darkest color. If this is your last color, skip to step 12.

**11. Tape up again, spray last color:** Add bits of tape to cover up the sections that should remain the second color. Spray your darkest color.

**12. Peel off the tape:** Now you can peel off all of the tape you put down (except for the tape in the neck socket). When peeling, don't pull up- Instead, pull back. That way you don't run the risk of pulling off any paint. Try not to get any drool on your awesome looking guitar.

**13. Spray ALL the clear paint!:** Herpin derpin. When you're done, your finish should have a neat orange peel texture.

**14. Agonizing Torture:** Now you have to let the guitar sit for 3 months. I know, it sucks, but this is a necessary step. If you rest your guitar on something before the paint is cured, you'll notice that the finish will take on the texture of whatever it's resting on, which is a terrible way to ruin your paint job. I read that Gibson lets their guitars sit for 6 months before they touch them, so you should feel lucky.

**15. Wet Sanding** Start wet sanding using a sanding block and your wet sandpaper. You'll notice that there are obvious bumps between your colors. This is because you caked on so many layers of paint.  Start with lower grits- your goal here is to get rid of the ridges. When you get to the higher grits, the goal is to get as smooth as possible. Your guitar should have a dull finish now. Don't worry about sanding too much- with 3 cans-worth of clear paint, you probably wont hit the colors. IF you start to see color on your sandpaper, though, stop what you're doing, get another can of clear, and go back to step 13.

**16. Buffin':** Whip out the 3M buffing solution and a 100% cotton fabric (I used an old t-shirt). Apply a dab of solution to one section of the guitar and rub it in with the cotton. The harder you rub, the shinier it gets. Work in small sections until the entire guitar is shiny. Then repeat this process with the Swirl Mark remover.

**17. Reassemble and Enjoy:** In case you haven't noticed, your guitar is finished now. Reassemble it and ride off into the sunset with your shiny ax.

I didn't take any pictures while I was spraying on coats of paint, so sorry. :/

**EDIT 1:** So some people were asking how I did my design specifically. When I was at step 9, I drew a single dot on the body and a straight line through the dot. Drew another two lines through the same dot, but angled 60 degrees away from the original line. Then proceeded to draw parallel lines to each of the three lines, spaced uniformly. This created a triangle pattern. If you look at the illusion, each cube is actually a hexagon. 6 Triangles make a hexagon... you see where I'm going with this."	t5_2qh69	True

I work for a radio station, and we always throw out t-shirts at all the local 4th of July parades. This year we decided to step up our game and build a t-shirt cannon. 

Our needs:

* Throw a shirt about 50 feet.
* Be able to fire multiple times in reasonably quick succession. No bicycle pumps.
* Cheap. We payed for it out of pocket, so no fancy CO2-powered monstrosities that would cost an arm and a leg. 

Someone at the office suggested one of those three-man water balloon slingshots. Perfect! It fit all of our must-haves, but we wanted something that could be fired by one guy. 

After much brainstorming - and some inspiration from [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Slingshot-Cannon/) - we came up with this cheap, easy to build, easy to use t-shirt slingshot cannon.

[Check it out.](http://morethanabeard.com/2013/06/28/i-made-a-t-shirt-cannon-for-10-and-so-can-you/)

Start out by having this partner hurl chickens up in the air at a close proximity. You should be able to practice this 3-4 times with each chicken; dead ones offer no practical experience. After you have mastered the chicken uppercut, move on to more slightly mobile game. Wild pheasant is preferable. It will take some time to gauge the appropriate range and timing. This is usually where people dismiss this goal as either not worth it, or as being too cruel; pussies. After you have established a high success rate, it’s time to work on your stealth skills. A common misconception with punching eagles out of the air is that they will approach you if you bait them properly, this is absurd; the eagle is a formidable enemy. In order to work on your carnal stealth skills, it is advisable that you start out hunting small game with your bare hands. Using the range and timing you have developed with the chickens; squirrels, gophers and other small mammals will train your reaction time and accuracy. It is assumed that your observation skills and tree climbing ability will also improve at this stage. Given that you have not pussied out at this point, your next focus should be on smaller, airborne prey. Magpies and crows are the primary targets, as they are assholes by nature and no one will look down on you for exterminating these noisy fuckers. Your range, timing, stealth and accuracy will all improve during the weeks of crow punching. After you achieve a 95-100% successful punch rate, it will be time to be called up to the big show. Birds of prey are a whole new ball game, firstly, they will test your mental ability. Falcons, hawks and eagles all have a tendency to fight back. There will be fear. The true test of an eagle puncher is his ability to hone this fear and convert it into pure aggression. Expect an elevated heart rate, heavy breathing and excessive sweating. Secondly, birds of prey will test your physical strength. You will most likely be unable to kill the bird with the initial blow. Two outcomes are now presented; fight or flight (literally). The bird will gauge your dedication level, and either fly away, or attack. You must be prepared for the attack. Assuming you have had adequate training and have followed my directions above, you should be able to take the bird should it choose to fight. The rest is in your hands. Some, less psychologically strong, eagle punchers will carry weaponry in the case of the attack post initial contact. This is obviously a personal preference; however, depending on your location, shooting an eagle may land you in serious legal trouble. PM me if you have any questions.           	t5_2qh69	True

I spilled some on the (valuable, wonderful) couch, and immediately freaked out and looked up ways to self-clean.  The universal suggestion was to make a baking-soda/water paste, wipe clean with water, sprinkle some baking soda on, and vacuum it up.  I did this and the stain went from two little spots to this monster you see here.  I think the paste was too watery?  And maybe the material was porous?

The material is either linen or canvas, I think; if there is anything anyone can recommend, please do as it would be a LIFESAVER!!!!!

so i'm not part of the apple cider vinegar industrial complex, work in any industry involving vinegar, apples, cider or bottling. i have no stake in lying. and i'm a regular redditor who has engaged in discussions not involving quackery or apple cider vinegar.

i'm a computer graphics artist that has always had three smallish but distinct moles on my face - elevated ones - that i always wanted to just get rid of but never did cuz they're cosmetic and therefore not covered by insurance and the cost of cutting or lasing the suckers off was ridiculous... easily in the xbox 360 range...
so on impulse, i just started looking up some internet quackery to see if there was anything out there that looked plausible, cheap and non-dangerous... something to just give a whirl on a quiet sunday.

sure enough, i came upon a strategy using apple cider vinegar (which evidently has loads of other uses).
i didn't have much faith but i figured i didn't have anything to lose that some neosporin won't fix up even if everything went to total crap so i tried.

and it worked **AMAZINGLY** well.

note - i've had a doctor previously look at my moles (in the hopes of getting them removed) and the doc said they were completely benign and therefore uncovered by insurance. don't try to remove a mole BEFORE you know whether it is benign or what. if you somehow remove a malignant mole, it can make diagnosis hard or impossible later.

----------------------
WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

- apple cider vinegar - i got a natural, ""cloudy"" one at kroger's. 3% vinegar about $4.
- sewing needle/sandpaper scrap/emery board. something to scratch your mole with.
- scotch tape.
- toilet paper.
- eyedropper or qtip - just something to moisten the toilet paper scrap with - more on this later.
- everything should cost less than $5 and most of it you'll have at home.

------------------------------------
PROCEDURE:

- using a sewing needle, sand paper scrap or emery board, abrade the mole so that vinegar can penetrate the whole of the mole. it doesn't HAVE to bleed but i figured it's better to be thorough. also, mine were elevated a bit (smaller than a small pimple but still elevated) so i ended up pincushioning it with the needle too.
- get scotch tape, tear up a small bit of toilet paper and fold it up to the size that will just cover your mole. stick that into the middle of your scotch tape and you've created a kind of band-aid.
- use the eyedropper or qtip to get the ACV and soak the toilet paper pad on the tape.
- put the tape such that the ACV infused pad is right on top of the mole.
- if you abraded correctly, that motherfucker should sting like a sonofabitch.
this means it's working! leave it on overnight.
- next day, remove and wash up. as you go through your day, you should be able to feel that the mole has changed character and is becoming more and more like a scab!
that acid in the ACV is totally not messing around... it has BURNED your mole to the point of killing it!

-----------------------------------------------------
i did my moles for two nights in a row and they became quite emphatically scabs.

i even got impatient to see if there was anything UNDER the mole so i pulled a bit of scab off to look underneath (something i would not have been able to do at all with the ""healthy"" mole). PALE SKIN! and at about the level where the rest of my skin lies! (note, you'll probably get nicer results if you don't pull the scabs off and let it heal and fall off on their own).

i'm currently on day 3 and am just applying neosporin to help the healing process.

what should happen now is that the scabs should heal and fall off and with them, any remnant of the moles.
may leave a bit of a discolored mark or scar underneath though i've read that for many, it eventually heals up completely, but either way, i am just happy to be rid of my black little moles.

note - i cannot guarantee results or good results that you would like so definitely do your research and test on non-essential places (bottoms of feet or something... may not want to start with your face if you're a model or something) if you can. i am not liable to what you do to yourself.

especially if you are a model or actor or someone whose appearance is their life, it might be worth it to you to get it professionally resolved.

but for me, this was the shit! got the nuisances off with little pain, little money and little effort.
anyhoo, i just post this as someone who is skeptical of internet quackery and i'm just confirming that this worked for a redditor.

please be careful. rock on.

p.s. all my moles were elevated... little bumps. i hear they are shallower than flat moles. i have no experience on how well this works on flat moles so if you want to get rid of those, please do additional research. i can only testify to what happened to my raised moles.

--------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: before pic: http://twitpic.com/5cozb6 ... sorry, don't have many photos and no super clinical close ups.  as you can see, i have several little dots on my face but the three circled bugged me cuz they were raised and larger than the others.  i'm currently in the midst of healing and don't really feel like trying to snap a pic of them but they're pinkish red wounds about the size of the burned off moles and looks like they'll heal up well.  will take and post a pic when i can.

---------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: screw apple cider vinegar - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCLTT8 this is much easier, more powerful and produces nicer results.  seriously, this should be an ""on-label"" use for this stuff - burning off unwanted moles.  the gel dries quickly to form a glue like seal and continues burning off the mole as long as you have it on and after a night, you can just peel it off.  again, YMMV but for me, this worked great and i would recommend compound-w dry sealing gel much much more than apple cider vinegar.  thanks for the folks who recommended it in this thread."	t5_2qh69	True

For the last three years, we at Vakanala, a non-profit organization, have been working to conserve and restore the unique primary forests near the rural community of Ilomena in southwestern Madagascar. One of the top ten hotspots of biodiversity on Earth, the forests of Madagascar are home to over 200,000 different species. An estimated 80% of these plants and animals are endemic to the island of Madagascar and are found nowhere else in the world. Even so, over 100,000 hectares of these forests, and the rare plants and animals in them, disappear to logging every year.

To reverse this dramatic decline, we have established a large nursery in the Madagascan village of Iantoha, which allows us to plant more than 200,000 trees just this year, but we can't do it alone. To support us, we are offering seeds of a Madagascan baobab tree (Adansonia za) for you to plant at home. The funds raised here will go directly to the nursery and reforestation program to help us grow year over year.

Each seed purchased helps fund the planting of two new trees.


**More informations** :
As said on the website, we are a small non-profit that try to make rural community in madagascar to embrace reforests restoration as a tools for biodiversity conservation but also local development.
What is not said on the website is that we are absolutely need new funds to complete this years, and plant the trees that are currently in the nursery (they will be planted in December, when the rainy season start).
We need at least 5 000€ , mostly to paid our nurserymen (ad women), that are all from the village where we work. These salaries are very needed for them, as it is the only source of work available in this area.
That is why we came with this idea of selling seeds to support our project : we need money to continue our initiative
We already have made some sells, but it not enough yet. Even if you can't buy seeds, why help will be welcome to help us and so continue our project!

**We needs feedbacks to help us sell more seeds!**

Some questions : 

* Is it ok for you, non-european redditors that the price are in euro? not to repulsive?
* How about the price? not too expensive? what if we had a 5 seeds packs at 5€ ?
* What else??"	t5_2qh69	True

I sent e-mails to all of the local towing companies and locksmiths and asked them for their best price on lockout service , giving them my exact location, model, etc at their earliest opening time. One place gave me a call at 5 AM, an hour before I would normally leave work and offered to do it for 20 bucks at some time between six and seven, as it was on his way to a vehicle he had to tow.

5x+20/10=30 x = ?

How I did it;

1. Change the name of column C to myvar or even x.
2. Insert the problem into A1. Ex: 5*myvar+20/10 or if you used x, 5*x+20/10
3. Select Goal Seek
4. Set Cell: A1
5. To value: 30
6. By changing cell: C1
7. Enter or Ok

It will place 5.6 in C1, which is the correct answer for X.


It will even work for repeating variables.

Example:

5x+20/10+x=62 x = ?

Which you would enter as 5*myvar+20/10+myvar

It will show 10 in C1, which is the correct answer for x.

I just shelled out $600 for oil and now I'm losing my mind because I'm having a hell of a time getting it to kick back on. I've had to troubleshoot in the past so I know how to bleed the line and press the reset button, but I've done this several times with no success (bled out about a quart over several attempts with no air and only minor crud noted). Last year, I replaced a nozzle that had gotten gummed up. I'm scared that I've hit the reset button too many times at this point and potentially flooded the furnace. I don't see any oil spraying when i open up the furnace, but I'm not totally sure I'm looking in the right place. So, what do I do now? Leave it alone for 8 hours and try the reset again? Or am I just screwed and need to call someone out?	t5_2qh69	True

Fast forward to present and we are now in the process of trying to save the books.

It´s amazing -- a little bit of Easy Off on the shower wall/floor and the soap scum melts away.

I was thinking my stand up shower was past due for a good cleaning... Turns out oven cleaner foam left sitting for 30 minutes takes off all the nasty with **zero** effort.  Splash some water on the dried bubbles and your shower is clean.

I was amazed it actually worked.  My shower is now clean and I´ll probably die when I slip in the shower tomorrow because I don´t have soap scum traction on the floor of the shower any more. 

I´m all about finding the easy way to keep my place clean...  Feel free to post other tips below!"	t5_2qh69	True

Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer.

We will be using sandboxie to run our browser securely. This by itself is a great start. It runs your browser in an isolated area, a 'sandbox' things can come in but nothing can come out. This is a layer of security for virus' and other malware that is prevalant while browsing. Also, by itself if you were to browse certain sites in the sandbox then open a regular browser your history would be locked into the sandbox. Remember things can come in (like programs and data) but nothing can leave. (unless you specifically pick data to remove). **Do not install sandboxie yet. ** But download it.

Truecrypt Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk. This is how we will be using truecrypt. If you don't have it already download it, and go through the simple tutorial and set up an encrypted volume. The tutorial is very easy to follow and is quickly done. The encrypted volume can be anywhere on your computer it doesn't matter, or even on another hard drive. Give it any name.


Now that you have your encrypted volume set up. Mount it using your password. Your volume should be mounted like another disk with it's own letter (you choose w/e letter you like).

Now you can install sandboxie. **but first** choose to install sandboxie *within* the encrypted volume. So browse to your encrypted drive and install it there.


And now you are done. You have set up an encrypted volume. That you can use to store files like pictures or videos. And you also have your sandboxie program installed to the encrypted volume. This is done just incase somebody finds the sandboxie programs and opens a browser in it to find your browser history. this keeps that from happening by having it the the encrypted volume. once you are done accessing the volume and dismount it the sandboxie program wont be accessible due to it now being encrypted.



**::IMPORTANT::**


**KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECURE**


**REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT YOUR ENCRYPTED VOLUME WHEN YOU ARE DONE** (leaving it open defeats the purpose you know)

1374778932.0	1j1nio	How to cure warts (with photos)	v0lrath	111	32	38	"About 5 years ago I had really bad warts on the back of my hand. They were rapidly getting worse and I was desperately trying everything. I tried:

* Freezing at the doctor
* Freezing with a home kit
* Duct Tape
* A pocket knife
* A bunch of other crap that really hurt

Finally, out of desperation, I tried the apple cider vinegar trick, and within a month my gigantic wart infestation was totally gone. I'll break down the process here. First, supplies:

* Apple Cider Vinegar (I used a $1 bottle from WalMart)
* Medical Tape ([this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Durapore-Medical-Tape-Silk-yards/dp/B000C4O7GC))
* Cotton balls or cotton pads
* Scissors (useful, but not 100% necessary)

Here is what you do. Every night before you go to sleep, cut a tiny piece of cotton just big enough to cover your wart. Dip it in the apple cider vinegar, and then use the medical tape to secure the vinegar cotton to your wart overnight. If you have different scheduling needs, you can do it during the day too. The idea is to cover it with vinegar for 8-12 hours per day. Do not cover it 24 hours a day!

When you remove the tape each day, the warts should be white for a couple hours until they dry out. This is a good sign that you got the vinegar on there correctly.

After a few days of this, the warts will begin to harden and a layer or two might be able to be picked off. I usually tried to pick at mine every day when I showered. Be consistent and don't give up if you miss a day. Just continue the process the next day. Eventually your warts will be nearly gone. DON'T STOP YET. After it looks like the warts have completely disappeared, keep using the vinegar for a few more days or there is a chance they will return.

During this process, the skin around your warts might start to get irritated (usually from using a little too much vinegar or a piece of cotton that's too big.) This is okay. If you need to take 1-2 days off, go for it. Just remember to start up again and do it for as long as you can.

1311799824.0	j1ias	Quick tip to easily flip a bug over right-side (and move it) or remove a bug from a water dish [nifty reflex response]	zumzink	141	60	54	"I've been getting a lot of random bugs in the house due to the warm weather. For some reason I'm finding a lot of them on their back, flailing legs-up trying to turn over.  The pet's water dish outside gets several bugs each night, mostly beetles. 

Sometimes I don't want to flip over the bugs with my fingers because I'm afraid I'll damage the fragile legs or body. Other times I don't want to risk getting bit/stung. And in the case of the water dish, it's ridiculous to try to fish those little suckers out or dump the bowl without drowning them.  

Flipping them over each time and/or removing them (part of the Insect Relocation Program) has been comically awkward until I stumbled onto this tip by accident:  

- Fold a piece of tissue or paper in half.  
- Hold it over the insect's body lengthwise, hovering between the insect's legs. 
 - The little legs will immediately stop flailing and clamp onto the tissue/paper (it's actually kinda cute and funny to watch).
- The little critter will then climb up and over the tissue/paper, righting itself. 
- Done!

Once it's on the paper you can either easily carry it outside, or just lay the paper on the ground and let the bug walk off, happily right-side up. This works when you're fishing bumbling insects out of water too. If the critter is on its back in the water, then just follow the same instructions above. If the critter is right-side up in the water, place the paper almost level with the water surface and slightly under the bug -- it will respond in the same way, allowing you to relocate it. 

This has worked with several kinds of beetles and general bug-like things, so I imagine it'll work with most insects."	t5_2qh69	True

I will be attending medical school in the fall (please attend my early funeral) and I want to convert a wall into a dry erase board. As I haven't moved INTO my apartment yet, I am unsure of the dimensions, but l, for the sake of argument, will say it should be a 5 foot x 6 foot space of whiteboard. 

Now, the deets:

I am aware there are some options. 

1.) get an actual dry erase board (mad expensive, right?)

2.) get the paint that allows your wall in your new apartment to become a dry erase board....(okay, but kinda nervous about painting a new apartment wall...with a substance that may NOT come off?)

3.) build your own by getting the laminate, and then doing...something?

Hello Friends I hope this will be helpful to someone out there!

edit: The inspiration for this came from my bike however these will be useful anywhere a normal ziptie would slip around due to lack of friction. Metal, glass, ceramic, other plastics...

I have a older frame that came without mounts for my new hydraulic brake cables. I tried to remedy the situation for a while with some zip-ties but they kept coming loose against the frame and my cables would slide around.

I came up with a cheap solution that works so well that I thought I would share it with you!

**Plasti Dip**
""Multi-Purpose Rubber Coating""

Line a bunch of zip-ties on some old cardboard and spray the underside of the zip-tie, that will contact the frame, with a few passes of the magic spray.

*Preface: Recently chrome has decided to release its own sandbox version of flash called ""Pepperflash"" which is not to be unwelcome, but being new has some inherited risks of usability as the bugs get worked out.*

It's fairly easy to reverse, but can become undone as new chrome updates are released.

Simply go to **chrome://plugins** in the Chrome address bar, hit the ""+details"" button on the top right, and find the ""pepperflash"" version of Flash in the bellow plugins list (you can simply ctrl+f and look for **pepflashplayer.dll** if you don't want to bother looking). Once found simply hit **disable**, then restart chrome for good measure. Now it should be using the standalone version of flash (that also comes default with chrome now)."	t5_2qh69	True

What's your recipe?	codyanne	107	31	53	"After perusing the internet for detergent recipes for about 2 minutes, I decided on [this one from The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/04/09/making-your-own-laundry-detergent-a-detailed-visual-guide/) and I substituted 1/2 a bar of [Fels-Naptha](http://www.felsnaptha.com/) laundry soap (I found it at Wal-Mart a lot cheaper than I found it online).

I used 1 cup of Washing Soda, 1/2 a cup of Borax, and 1/2 a bar (about 2.75 oz) of Laundry Soap (but you can use any bar soap you wish). Then I heated 4 cups of water in a pot &amp; added the shredded soap to it until it melted, then added all ingredients to a bucket with 3 gallons of warm water in it &amp; stirred. It was that easy! It'll be ready to use tomorrow night.

My total cost is... *drumroll please* ...a whopping 2 cents per load, compared to 11 cents per load for All Small &amp; Mighty Free Clear (via Amazon). About $20 will make 18 batches of that recipe, and that's over 900 loads of laundry.

It'll take one cup per load, and I might try different recipes in the future, but I'm excited to get a few loads going. Has anyone else tried making their own laundry detergent? What's your recipe?"	t5_2qh69	True

It’s suffered 6 long years of being peed on by our four legged clientele. I’ve washed it down, scrubbed it all with a stiff wire brush so I think I’m ready for the painting/priming. As you can tell from the photos I already tried applying black spray paint directly only the metal before I found out it was nickel coated.

It’s chipped and scratched really easy so far so I’m hoping someone can tell me what to do and what to use to make the paint stick and not scratch off so easily.

1334163383.0	s4kph	Homebrew UHF-VLF antenna and receiver for picking up pretty much anything in the radio spectrum.	Craigellachie	89	24	10	"Ok, so I posted yesterday about using an old UHF TV to pick up other signals in the band like private security cameras (unencrypted) and local analogue bands and the like. There was some interest so I'm going to go in detail on how you can make it yourselves.

First off if you have no idea about radio or electronics at all for that mater I'd recomend building a [diode radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio). There are plans all over the internet for this and they are vary simple consisting of an antenna (any long metal object that will resonate with radio frequencies) a coil of copper wire which acts as an [inductor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor), baiscally a filter removing residual interference with your selected frequency. The number of turns and the diameter of the windings are directly porportional to the signal you get. By reducing or increasing the number of turns (via a sliding contact) you can tune your radio. A similar method of tuning is by using a [variable capacitor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_capacitor) in parallel with your inductor to change the frequency it is tuned to. But we still have a problem because our radio waves are now tuned but still sloshing around back and forth like water in a bucket. To rectify this we use a [rectifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier), a one way door of sorts for electricity which allows the signal to be modulated to be used by a pair of earphones. The signal tends to be very weak unless you use a large antenna so you have to use special pizeoelectric earphones (which have to be bought at speciality stores which are rare) or by using a voltage boosting circuit via a transistor. 

Ok so that wall of text aside, much of the same principles apply to higher radio frequencies like the UHF (ultra-high-frequency). The problem is that the higher your frequency, the smaller the gap between channels and the more sensitive your tuning needs to be in order to get good reception. Anyone who needed to fiddle with bunny ears knows that. To tune my setup (it will differ depending on your TV) I used over 5000 turns of 12 gauge copper wire (make sure it's insulated or enamelled) around a 2cm diameter pipe. This setup (which is at my home so I don't have pictures) looked pretty ridiculous (it was a few meters long) but worked pretty well for manually tuning a TV. One you have a good tuner you just need to get a good antenna. You can buy a logarithmic VHF-UHF antenna at junk stores or specialtiy electronics retailers. Or you can make your own [loop antenna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_antenna) which is really just some measured wire arranged geometrically. The calculations for the size of the loops of wires are not simple and if you want to do this, I'd recommend you buy yourselves electronics hobby books or kits as they go into far more detail than I can. It then becomes a simple matter of buying an adaptor for the antenna port on your UHF TV and fiddling with the tuner. The efficiency of the antenna and the quality of your tuner will determine what signals you pick up. I know a guy who used a massive  8m homemade horn antenna to actually pick up cosmic microwave background radiation. There is even a ham radio on the space station so if you arrange a time you can call them up. However that is the result of years fiddling with radio signals.

Amateur radio is a great hobby to get into as there are thousands of stations on air and millions of walkie talkies, police scanners and truckers on all the time, every day. If this interests you I would strongly recommend exploring on your own and building gradually more complex radio circuits. Good luck and I hope I was slightly informative and sorry for the lack of pictures.

1372692730.0	1hfi89	How do I go about making a toothbrush?	RightFootStar	104	38	27	"Here's the back story. One day, brushing my teeth I got sick and tired of always hitting my teeth on the plastic back part. I've had it. So I came up with Mouth Brush.

Mouth Brush is a tooth brush that has a 360º degree bristles is the shape of a tear drop. As the bristles get closer to the point of the drop it will be more firm bristles which would allow you to dig into food holes in your teeth.

Having the bristles going 360º around will cut brushing your teeth in half because while you are brushing the top, you will also be brushing the bottom. But here's the best part. this brush will not only brush your teeth but your whole mouth. This design will allow you to easily scrub your cheeks walls, tongue, pretty much your whole mouth.

Oral care needs more than a toothbrush... It needs a mouth brush. 

[Shitty example of a visual](http://i.imgur.com/KnUdnyK.jpg)


Here's where I need reddit's advice, help and opinion.  I have no idea where to even start on this.  How do I make this?  Where would I start?

Thanks in advance.

edit1:  I tried searching for similar products but only came up with a [image of a cheap brush](http://toolmonger.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/toothbrush.jpg)( with a head that was like a paint roller... terrible.  This was a while ago and I tried to recreate the search results but couldn't find it.  

In regards to the bristles to the front I was even thinking instead of it just getting shorter bristles, have a have a point towards the tip where it's all thinner and smaller size bristles.  Picture it as the fairway and the green.  

Patents are outrageous, it's like $1000's of dollars.  That's next level stuff, would even know where to start on that.  But I really do believe this would be a great brushing experience.  Nothing has changed in as long as I can remember, you have your back and your front.  I want the 360º!!

molds might be a good start?  i'm guessing.  even that, where would I get tooth brush molds?  Does that even exist?

[I got a pair of old school (probably late 70's to 80's) wooden (possibly particle board) speakers.](http://imgur.com/a/TXupY) the last picture in the album is a corner that got bashed off at some point. i threw it in to try to show the particle board looking insides. 

the wood finish is hardly in keeping with my rooms modern asthetic. (or the one i'm hoping to have by time i move out.) i'm thinking spray paint would be easiest, i'm really not artistically inclined at all, but tape and spray is pretty hard to screw up.

i'm just wondering the best way to go about it. i was kind of hoping to do it without removing the actual speakers from the cabinet. only because i don't want to accidentally screw up the electronics. the cover/dust guards are gone so no chance of just using those.

* do i need to sand them? 
* what type of paint should i use? 
* can i just tape over the speakers or would that definitely look like crap? (i've decided the best alternative to this might be to take them out of the cabinet, but not disconnect the wiring, maybe wrap them in plastic and do the painting then put them back)
* if i have an idea laid out to use black, blue, and yellow, is there a color i should use first? 
* is there anything i should avoid doing in order to not totally screw this up? 
* any idea how many coats to make sure it looks good or do i just play it by ear? 
* any specific way to make it look glossy or matted?

1.  Allow water in bowl to recede to it's lowest level

2.  Take ice bucket bag (where provided) and insert your hand inside it.

3.  Unwrap plastic drink cup (if wrapped in plastic) and insert your gloved or ""bagged"" hand inside the plastic wrapping down to the bottom of the cup so that two or more of your knuckles are touching the bottom.

4.  Take the top of the ice bag ""glove"" and hold it tight against your arm with your free hand (if available, try using a rubber band, scrunchie™ or hair tie to achieve the same effect in order to leave this hand free)

5.  Insert cup into the toilet drain (hole) with a firm grip inside the cup and with the makeshift ""glove"" still on, and mimic plunging actions (thrust cup in, thrust cup out) into the drain repeatedly.  Try to insert the cup flush with the drain so as to create adequate pressure towards the obstruction. The cup will likely bend against the inside of the drain but try to maintain it's shape as much a possible by experimenting with the way you hold the cup (fist, knuckles, etc.)

6.  Repeat until you see the remaining water recede and/or hear the ubiquitous ""gurgle,"" denoting that the blockage has been removed.

1. I used Google Documents to create a user form [(Google Form Help)](http://support.google.com/docs/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=87809).  Once the form is created, it will automatically generate a spreadsheet in which the responses will be placed.  Each field on the form will correspond to a column in the spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet also adds a column (Column A) for a time stamp on when the form was submitted. 

2. Once you have the form created, copy the URL from the ""Live Form"" (select under ""Form"" while in the spreadsheet view).

3. Paste the URL you copied into a QR Code generator.  I used one offered by [Delivr](http://delivr.com/qr-code-generator).  You can also search on Google for other generators that have more or different options.  Save the QR Code block as a jpeg or other image file.

4. My fiancé designed the invitations on [Mixbook](http://www.mixbook.com/).  After she worked her magic, I worked mine to import the jpeg file for the QR code and place it on the back of the invite.  

5. Sit back and rub it in to your fiancé when people start RSVP'ing from their smart phones, when she told you they wouldn't.  

I was going to go into more depth with a legit tutorial (screen shots, links to actual forms, etc.), but it was brought to my attention that it really isn't that complicated.

1370265972.0	1fkv28	How to solve an outdoor drain that causes flooding inside my house?	The_Teeds	84	25	15	"I have a basement door that continually gets flooded every time there is heavy rain.

The drain is a standard drain that sits flush with the ground.  But when there is heavy rain, debris (leaves, dirt, &amp; sticks) piles up on top of this drain and clogs the drain - preventing any water from going down the drain.  When this happens, and the rain is heavy enough, the basement will start to flood.

I have seen some dome shaped drain covers before and I think this would resolve my issue but I have been unable to find one.  Does anyone know where I could get one or have a different idea to solving this issue?


thanks!

This is by far the best way I've found to wash my cats.  The trick is to get the cats clean as quickly as possible and with the minimum of personal injury.

Have a shower with a sliding glass door, and one of those shower heads on a flexible hose. It also helps to have a no-slip mat for the shower so the cat can dig his claws into something other than you.

Get in the shower with the cat and close the doors. It helps if you have kind of a dumb cat who doesn't know how to open sliding glass doors but if not you can keep one hand on the door to keep the cat from getting out, or a friend/spouse on the outside to make sure the door stays closed.  Close the bathroom door so if the cat does get out he won't run off under the bed while still soaking wet.

Do **not** try to hold the cat. This will only guarantee a clawing at some point. Let him keep his feet on the floor and he won't be thinking about sinking them into you.

Spray the cat down with the shower, avoiding the cat's head so you don't get water in his eyes or nose.  Put soap on the cat and lather without moving him.  He might wander around the shower trying to get out, so all you have to do is rub the soap in.  Try and get soap everywhere up to behind the ears -- but again, avoid the nose and eyes. 

If you are gentle your cat will not claw you though he might continue to try to escape one way or another. I often use a cat brush to get the soap in better and to help remove loose fur.

Rinse off the cat, getting everywhere you put soap. Since you have a shower on a hose, you can rinse him all over, including underneath, and thoroughly get all the soap off.

Have a couple of dry towels handy once you turn off the water. Leaving your cat's paws on the floor, use the first towel to soak up as much water as possible, almost like a squeegee to get the excess water off. Work from the head down towards the other ends. The second towel is to dry the cat as best you can.

It's nearly impossible to dry the cat completely without a hair dryer, which they don't like at all and which probably isn't that great for them. I just dry mine as best I can then let them run off to finish by licking themselves. Takes about another hour or two before they're fully dry.

Yes, the cats will make unhappy noises, but they're pretty used to it after all these years and don't freak out too much. And say what you like, but they really seem to enjoy being clean once they've dried off. 

I usually bathe them only a couple of times a year, ideally when the weather turns warmer and they start shedding.  Most of the time I get away with no scratches.  I figure a 75% pain-free rate is pretty good.

It might work for a recent model but they manufacturer might have fixed it. If you lift up the handle of your Ranger there are two holes. If you take the unscrewed radio antenna and put it in the hole  closest to the bed of the truck (MAKE SURE THE WINDOW IS ROLLED UP OR YOU CAN RUIN YOUR WINDOW) You need to take the screw end of the antenna and maneuver the antenna around inside the door you can feel the lock mechanism start to push up. If you push get the lock to push up as high as you think you can you want to slowly release the handle still holding the antenna in place. If done correctly the lock will stay in place and not fall back down. It may take a few tries and it can get quite frustrating. If needed I can post a video of me doing it but it will probably come out crappy. Good luck and thanks for reading!

However, they laid one diploma on top of another and the hanging hooks on the top frame scratched the wood on the bottom frame. The scratch is very small, but noticeable. Short of sanding the frame down or anything that might affect the stain, how can I repair these surface scratches?"	t5_2qh69	True

When I take him outside he marks stuff outside that is appropriate, and when i'm home he won't mark anything. When my wife and I are both not home though he will mark. He knows he's not supposed to mark in the house, as he has been caught doing it once or twice. Now he seems to have learned, ""Don't mark in the house when my owners are home."" rather than, ""Don't mark in the house."" What can we do?"	t5_2qh69	True

1339301743.0	uu64i	Summer Project	Jyar	66	16	12	So I have decided to take on my first *big* DIY endeavor. I have been in need of a new bed frame for years, and have finally found a design that I like. [This](http://i.imgur.com/wUuve.jpg) is the sort of bed I will be taking on. I have figured out the plans for the outer box and headboard/footboard, as well as the slab the bed will sit on. The only issue I'm having now is that I cannot figure out how to properly position and mount the [struts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PGAQGS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A3PJ1K68EUK6I3) under the bed so that it can lift and close properly. The other images of beds such as this have some complicated setup of hinges and brackets that I can't seem to figure out. Any help will be much appreciated!	t5_2qh69	True
