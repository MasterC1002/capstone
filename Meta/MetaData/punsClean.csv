 After a few drinks the 5th is diminished and the G is out flat. An F comes in and tries to augment the situation but is not sharp enough. A D comes into the bar and heads straight for the bathroom saying,*Excuse me, I'll just be a second""

An A comes into the bar but the bartender is not convinced this realtive of C is not a minor. Then the bartender notices a B-Flat hiding at the end of the bar and excalims, ""Get out now! You're the seventh minor I've found in the bar tonight."" The E-Flat is not easily deflated, comes back to the bar the next night in a 3-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. The bartender who used to have a nice coporate job until his company downsized, says, ""You're looking sharp tonight, come on in! This could be a major development."" This proves to be the case as the E-Flat takes off the suit and everything else and stands there au natural.

Eventually C sobers up and realizes in horror he is under a rest. The C is brought to trial, found guilty of contributing to the diminution of a minor, and is sentenced to 10 years of DS without Coda at an upscale correctional facility. On appeal, however, the C is found innocent of any wrong doing, even accidental, and that all accusations to the contrary are bassless."	t5_2qidh	True

A Spaniard he was, by both birth and spirit. We duelled relentlessly, always gaining ground only to see it slip away, a pun-of-war as it were. A seemingly eternal struggle for dominion. This endless struggle took its toll on both him and I, until I realized that it was time to stop. I chose to cede the mantle to him. And I will never go back to that life.

One night when he was sweeping up a corner of the exhibit, he noticed a figure jump over the railing into the enclosure. He crept closer to see if he could make out the person, when he saw, to his surprise, that it was his sister. To his further surprise, his sister took off her pants, bent over, and had intercourse with an elephant. My cousin stood, shocked into silence, until the act was finished and his sister had left.

My cousin kept his silence about this event until seven months later at next year’s family Thanksgiving dinner. His sister arrived with her fiancé and with a noticeable bulge in her tummy. As his family ate their dinner and talked, my cousin seethed. Finally, toward the end of the dinner, my cousin abruptly stood up and said, “Alwight. I now wealize that no one else is going to addwess the elephant in the womb.”

1348850516.0	10miq9	A short story	scshunt	13	4	4	"John Deavensmit was not having a good time. After an incident involving a coffee spill, he'd been sued for $50 million, and somehow the jury had ruled against him. There was no way he could pay that much money; he'd go bankrupt.

Naturally, he filed for an appeal, but the winner of the case was already beginning to hound him for money, hoping to get at least something before the judgement was overturned. John was nearly at his wit's end before he found an unusual package in his mailbox.

It was from a couple of his friends, who all went on to law school when John left to create a startup. They'd all been very successful, and had gone on to be justices at various levels, from courts in a small county in Wisconsin all the way to the Supreme Court. When he opened it up, he was surprised to see an ink drawing of a thick wooden stick. It was signed by his friends, and accompanied by a note:

&gt; Hey John,
&gt;
&gt; We're sorry to hear about your loss in court last month. We met up at a judge conference in the Davison Center, and we thought that we'd do something special for you. We met up in the Grapefruit Room and all worked together to draw this. We hope you enjoy it!
&gt;
&gt; Your friends

Now, John had been to D.C. a few times, and knew about the Davison Centre. It was renowned for its *very* offbeat architecture. The Grapefruit Room was one of the weirdest: it had been constructed by taking a world-record grapefruit, carving out the flesh, and preserving the rind. The result was a walk-in fruit, and it always smelled of citrus.

It took John a while to work out the significance of the gift, but when he realized it, he was overjoyed. His good friends had seen fit to grant him a stave judge-men penned in a peel."	t5_2qidh	True

1322439558.0	mrcwd	Puns of Varying Quality on the Subject of Linguistics (created in a fit of procrastinative inspiration) some of which I thought someone, someday might appreciate.	kieuk	8	4	2	"Note: Quality Very Varying (I see what I did there) and sometimes subject to specialist knowledge. So I apologise in advance. Shame me with your better puns.

While I was languishing in the Language Centre, doing some semantics antics and considering how all the other linguistics students despised and derided me, I was accosted by a stout man with large glasses who made me a preposition. It was that I should collect terrible puns, to do with linguistics, in order to ingratiate myself yet further with the other linguistics students (including even the phonetics fanatics).

I'm struggling to think of a pun to do with grammaticality that both makes sense and ""Is grandma tickly?"" correct. I'm also stuck on 'morphologician'. (I'm not actually sure that's a particularly logical word for the subject, though I guess that's more for, er, more for a logician to worry about.)

The problem I have with writing about phonological variation is that one is constantly forced to choose between being fun or logical - very Asian!I always get in trouble with electricians, they think I'm calling them a 'dialectician' whereas in fact I'm just saying ""Die, electrician.""

I like pscycholinguistics – the only department of linguistics where it’s acceptable to wear a cycle helmet.
My Australian accent is terrible but I like to think my Sath Efrican one is predicate.
My favourite accent is Received Pronunciation, because it is the accent chiefly used by invisible Japanese people who are ordered online. When the first recipient of an invisible Japanese person got the parcel, they wrote a complaint saying ""Received but can't see Asian"" and the name stuck.

Why did the speakers whose native languages weren't English, but whose only shared language was English, but they weren't very good at it and kept on having to stop to think about it, stop talking to one another? They came to an agreement. (Get it? If not, write your answer on a pastecard and paste it to the below address.)

What did the 'a' say to the 'the'? ""You definitely are ticklish, 'the'!""

Why was the small man eaten by the large bear, which was proportionately bigger than him? It had, er, relative claws.

I think the reason there are so many speakers of Russian is because they all partake in an activity called ""copulae shun"". (Ok, ok, I know, that was Pushkin it.)

I know a man called Hillary who can, might, should, did, must, shall and will ride an ox. We call him ""Ox Hillary"".

I always think the verb 'to be' in the sentence 'I just want to be friends' must be in a good mood, because 'friends' gave it a complement.

Why did the verb cross the node? Because that was its object.

There's a semiotician Ian Eagle and his wife, who receive a lot of strange parcels. People think he's saying 'Send me a tissue, an Andean eagle, and his wife'.

I'm doing a paper in discourse analysis. You ask me why I do dis course, I say it's becourse I like large groups of people dancing to music. (discos)

Wid ye elect an MP on grounds of their idiolect?

The problem with trying to use 'Li', as in 'Li4', in a pun to do with lying, is that you end up having to pronounce the word 'Li' strangely. (I think I just elide it...)

What did the 'to catch' say as it passed the 'goes' one evening? ""It's a fine night for a verb.""

There was a race between the two parts of the compound noun 'door key', and 'key' won the race - it was a head.

I can tell that nouns get turned on by pluralisation - they always get an inflection when it happens. (So sorry.)

I'm really annoyed that the word 'perish' hasn't arrived yet, I ordered it weeks ago!! I called the company to complain, but they just said ""There's nothing more we can do, because it's intransitive you know what I mean?""

What do you call an Irish lexicon? A leprechaun POHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHHOHAHAAAAHAHAAHHAA

One of the teachers at my primary school was sacked for calling her pupils 'Sir' and 'Madam'. She didn't even use the right register!

You should never say or write 'Would you care for some extraordinarily burnt toast?'. When I did it I got 'burnt' by an intensi-fire. (Sorry)

When asked what my favourite lexical category is, I reply ""Noun"". When asked if I would ever consider revising my answer to this question, I reply ""Noun again.""

A friend once had a section of their garden converted into a swimming pool. But then, one day, as he often recounts, ""The section was ~~stolen~~ by our next-door neighbours"". But, due to a speech impediment that prevents him from using the word 'pool', he cannot explain the missing participle.

('the missing part is a pool'? oh, never mind.)

I'm not a homophone. Europe in general is very modern about the whole thing - they let their nouns take any gender they please. As for me, I just think it's aphasia go through.

I used to get excited in phonetics lectures when I thought we were about to witness some postal workers tap dancing with their violas but apparently it was just a recording of a postalveolar tap.

Which consonant has the most affricates? Africa of course!

Why was the strangely literal-minded phonetician making a sound that sounded like a so-called 'clear l' but more weird? He had been told to think less literally and more lateral /i/!

If you're ever unsure as to quite what someone means when they declare their love for you using all kinds of exotic words, adjective I were you. (And then, later, adverbally phoneme).

The UN gets alarmed whenever I try and emphasise something - there's a lot of intonational stress.

My dad gets angry when I say things like ""fuck you"". He says it's a “vowel” phrase (whatever one of those is).

I was once lost in the New Forest when I came to clearing full of tents. Oddly, there didn't seem to be anyone in any of them at all. Spooked out, I called out ""Will anyone help me?"". At that moment it started to pour with rain. I got drenched. After the rainstorm, an old man crawled out of a tent nearby and came over to me. I asked him why he hadn't responded to me earlier, when I had called. He said, ""Should have used the present tents."" (this kind of works, right?)

Today we learnt about subordinate clauses. Seriously, people should know this from primary school, we don't need to do it in university. 'Subordinate clause' indeed. More like 'so bored in that class'. YEAH

You know why they call Inuktitut (the language of the Inuit) an agglutinative language? Yes, it's some kind of a pun about 'igloos' and 'natives'.

Three syntacticians walk into A’.



To end on a serious node (it's a terminal one): it is my belief that linguisticians should be interested in investigating the Sidgwick Site because it will help us reveal more about the nature of the language faculty. In fact, it has already raised it to a whole new level. (Note to those not familiar with the Sidgwick Site, Cambridge, UK: the language faculty, as the department is known, is in a building with no ground floor, so you could say it is raised by one level).

1344376576.0	xuh15	How have puns ruined your life? Inappropriate puns...what is the most insane misinterpretation/misuse or inopportune wielding of a pun you have ever witnessed? 	JanglyPangolin	2	0	1	"For instance:  I had been dating this man for seven years, on and off. We had moved in together.  His constant drug use was making him a zombie and I couldn't deal with it.  (Pot is no big deal, but if you have to get high before you do ANYTHING, there might be a problem, and there was.  Everything in moderation.)  
I couldn't stand it anymore and told him straight up:  The drugs or me. 
A few days later he approaches me and says he had been talking to his friend, who had told him to 'shit or get off the pot.'  IE, start taking things seriously or leave the relationship. 
 And so I asked, ""ok, which is it?""   
 And he replied....""Get off the pot.""    Which I thought meant, 'I want to break up.'
 To which I replied matter-of-factly, hiding my pain, ""Ok, I'm moving out.""   
The look on his face was perplexing.  He glared at me and then walked away back to his weed/computer room, where he spent 95% of time at home. 

Cut to months later and I receive a drunken text from him accusing me of breaking up with him even after he told me he was going to stop smoking pot and focus on our relationship. 
I deduced that he was trying to convey this message by using the phrase ""get off the pot"" in its literal context.  Which is a questionable communication strategy after you have just used the same phrase in a metaphor.  I ASSUME IT STILL MEANS THE SAME THING unless you use your words to tell me otherwise.  Obviously there were some deep rooted communication issues happening.   

  We're both better off now, but damn...learn how to use those things or you'll poke your eye out. 

**tldr: I broke up with my boyfriend of seven years because I misunderstood what he was saying due to a faulty pun-esque use of the metaphor ""shit or get off the pot.""** "	t5_2qidh	True
