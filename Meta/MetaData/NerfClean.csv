1352850958.0	135fzv	Regarding orange tips...	FireSpokes	64	13	42	"Hello all,

Today I stumbled upon this subreddit, and found a post of someone's black nerf gun. The top 4 or so comments said he ""needed"" an orange tip, and this bothered me. I then saw someone quote a federal law saying that orange tips were legally required, but he left out the part that said they are NOT required on imitation firearms that use compressed air. Let me start off by saying that I'm an air softer, and no, I do not have orange tips on any of my guns, and here's why:


1.) They do not do me well in games when I'm supposed to be the unseen hand of death.

2.) Contrary to popular belief it is NOT federal law that you must have an orange tip on your gun so long as it uses compressed air to expel the projectile (be it a piston system or HPA, makes no difference.). You DO need an orange tip to buy, sell, or transport the imitation firearm (over state lines only?)

&gt;This part does not apply to:
&gt;
&gt;(b) Traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof

Source: http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html#15:3.1.3.7.1.0.33.1

3.) I'm aware that nerf guns are not quite as realistic as airsoft guns, but the following still applies: Having an orange tip does not mean it will be treated as a toy by law enforcement officers. If you paint an orange tip on your gun, expect to be told to get on the ground if you go walk into a police station with it. The reason for this is that it's easy enough to paint an orange tip on a REAL firearm.


The constant ""You need an orange tip"" that I've found here displeases me greatly because you are instilling a sense of false security in each other. You should expect the public's response to a publicly brandished orange tip gun to be the same as a real firearm.

Personally, I don't bother with orange tip, because in a serious situation in which law enforcement officers are present the orange tip will not do anything.

Original comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/Nerf/comments/12skrj/hey_rnerf_anthing_else_that_you_think_i_should_add/c70ybr9

Yesterday, we were approached by the school president and the campus police chief and were told that there is a high chance of banning Nerf blasters from the school in the wake of Sandy Hook. We were also told that the faculty seems to have gotten more paranoid of a possible school shooting or someone bringing a gun to school under the cover of our game. According to my club president, the ban isn't in effect yet, but we have until April to either wait until the faculty calms down or prepare to mount a defense for our game. Currently I'm looking for as much information as I can to prepare for a possible presentation to the faculty i.e: statistics, news articles, other colleges running HvZ. So far we've been pulling back on advertising for the game since we're redesigning most of posters because they either have crosshairs on a zombie or a Nerf blaster being prominently shown. If anyone has any ideas, advice, or information, please  comment on this.

My Engineering Design class group is thinking of building a prototype Nerf grenade for our project. Before we decide on which project to undertake we would appreciate some feedback on what you, as product users, would want from a nerf grenade. 

The grenade would be designed to shoot elite darts in an area burst, but would obviously not be NERF branded. We've looked at the Lanard Scatter Blast for some inspiration and think there is much room for improvement.

So yeah, if you wouldn't mind answering some questions, that would be great.

[](/sbbook)~~I think I'm starting to understand why Hasbro went off and made just a bunch of small arms blasters (i.e. some handguns, a shotgun, a crossbow, and a sword). It seems to fit the whole ""zombie apocalypse"" theme well, as it should be doing.~~ 

[](/ohcomeon)~~Think about it, if we were to suddenly go into a zombie apocalypse, would you, or any common citizen, have an automatic assault rifle (which translates to a Stampede or RapidStrike), a rocket launcher (which translates to a Titan), or a long range rifle (which translates to a Longshot/Centurion/Homemade +Bow)? Not on hand, most likely, or even in your home (maybe hunting rifle, but that is besides the point). Maybe you have a handgun (Hammershot/Slidestrike), or a shotgun (Sledgefire), or even a crossbow (Crossfire) at home. Maybe you scavenged it off someone else's home. And you're not likely to find any *big* weapons, like an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle, or military-grade explosives, etc. Unless, you know, you manage to scavenge some off a dead soldier or something. Or you run into a huge warehouse full of military-grade weapons that were smuggled in by known terrorists before the apocalypse. As for the Vortex blasters, I have no explanation for that, honestly.~~
 
[](/disbored)~~But the point is, stop complaining that you didn't get something practical (like a magazine-fed blaster, or a belt-fed blaster), save maybe the Crossfire, the Hammershot, the Sledgefire, and that one decent-looking sword. At least Hasbro made the weapon choice, for the most part, something that made sense, save for those Vortex blasters and the sword.~~

I've been looking to do an ammo counter system for my stampede and I've seen a few different ways they have been done. I've seen a couple that were static (only worked for 6 or 18 round clips) and others that have some sort of adjusters (knobs or dials) to change the clip size.

What I've been thinking about is some sort of ""smart"" system that can identify the clip to change the counter setting automatically to the proper size.  I've been thinking of a few ways to do this and here's what I've come up with so far-

1. The counter board would need a way to identify the clips

* This could be easily done a few different ways but I'd like to see what you guys think.  My first thought was a simple bar code that you would attach to the outside of one of the ""fangs"" at the top of a clip. But I'm wondering if there is a more simple option. 
* Another option I thought of (not sure how realistic this one is) is just a series of 3 binary dots you could just do with a sharpie. With 3 dots you could handle every size clip from nerf right now with combos of dots being on and off.  I'm just not sure if there is a sensor that is simple and small enough to detect something like that. But this one seems very simple, 6 round clips could be on/off/off, 12 round could be on/on/off, 18 rounders on/on/on, 25 rounders off/on/on and 32 rounders could be off/off/on, with plenty of room for expansion for future clip/drum sizes from nerf.

2. The on board controller would have to be able to adjust itself from the input of the bar code (or 3 dot system or whatever system we could come up with) and display ammo count automatically.  Not sure if we'd have to use something like an Arduino to do that or if there was a simpler method.

3. Make kits to have these easily adaptable to most blasters.  Would need to make sure it had normal functionality still, like resetting after each clip removal. But basically have the components be as small as possible while still being economical enough for the average nerfer to afford.

Anyway, I'm personally not that great with electronics or programming but I'd be happy to fund, or help fund someone who is willing to take on a project like this.

So what do you guys think? Is this the best place for this discussion or should I post this on one of the boards?"	t5_2qz7g	True

1329609593.0	pvtl6	What is the best off the rack gun to shoot my cat with?	GALACTICA-Actual	29	4	32	"Now don't misunderstand me: I love my cat; we have been together for 13 years, and she has seen me though the thick and thin of the battles that life has to offer. This does not, however, change the fact that for at least ten of these years she has been plotting my death, and in the past five, actively seeking it.

Her latest plan seems to be to drive me insane, (presumably resulting in my taking my own life and her thus inheriting my vast wealth and spending her remaining days sucking down endless supplies of tuna, as if she didn't already look like Jabba the Hut,) by staring at me from just outside my bedroom door then suddenly erupting into meowing tirades then running away when I yell at her, only to resume, smugly mocking me like I'm her little bitch or something.

So what I need is a rapid response weapon that can be grabbed quickly from a sitting position on my bed and be fired with an accuracy range of about 10-15 feet, preferably with around a five to ten round capacity, and of course not actually hurt her, in the $30 or under range.

So that there can be no mistaking the seriousness of the remorseless savage that is my adversary, I have included a picture of the [beast](http://i.imgur.com/OKXU4.jpg) in which you can see the cool, calculating cunning that lurks behind her regal facade."	t5_2qz7g	True

Decided to mod my Sledgefire to shoot MEGA darts. It no longer needs ""shells"". Here's how:

I cut away and dremeled out all the air restrictors in the plunger (it pulls away quite easily from its housing if you lightly pry up on the small tab on the right hand side of the tube). Taped-off the 3 air holes from the outside, and filled the bottom of the plunger tube with an 1/8"" of epoxy, in a nice level layer. On the outside of the tube, I removed the tape and filled any remaining voids with epoxy. I also sanded flat the 3 small circle bumps that meet the ""shell"". The face should be smooth and flat.

In the barrel, I removed the ejection systems for the ""shells"" (slide off the small spring and the piece its attached to on top, and the tiny ""L"" shaped piece with the spring in the barrel break hinge) I sanded down the 2 horizontal ridges in the loading half of the barrel, and the ""shell"" stopping triangular ridges about half way up.

Then, I pushed a 6"" long 3/4""id PVC pipe down the middle of the barrel (duct tape along the outside makes it snug). I put 3 thin and short strips of duct tape inside the loading end of the PVC to snugly hold the MEGA dart (3/4""id PVC is just a smidgen too big for a MEGA dart not to fall out, so you have to add some layers of tape to make it fit) Lastly, I super glued an O-ring on the loading end of the PVC pipe to fit to the newly flat plunger face when you close the break-barrel.

Find the center of the seal between the new PVC pipe and face of the plunger, and drill a hole 3/8"" to 9/16"" (your choice) big. This is your new air hole.

When the gun is closed, press the PVC pipe against the plunger face, allowing the O-Ring to form a tight seal around the newly drilled hole.  Epoxy the PVC pipe into place so that it creates a good seal when closed. Boom. You can now fire MEGA darts. I see it as a grenade launcher now. I also removed the stock, so its more of a pistol-grip

Let me know if you have any questions. I am happy to answer any. Pics soon"	t5_2qz7g	True

Basically, after a few beers he told me that something big will be released soon and said ""keep you eye on the toy brochures in June"" and gave me a wink.

Although nerf doesn't like the fact that people mod their blasters, I believe they can capitalize on it by:


• Selling sperate accessories

• Selling upgrade (""mod"" not used on purpose) kits

• Selling more tactical rail accessories


You may be able to think of more, but I'm going to focus on the first three.  Because of masterkey mods, and even the fact that a lot of guns that can use stocks/barrel extensions don't come with them, people need more, but many (like myself) are unwilling to buy a whole blaster for just a few things that come with it.


As far as upgrade kits go, we all know that the [mega centurion] (http://nerfhaven.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=23724) is going to seriously increase the use of Nerf guns in the near future.  If Nerf sold kits to increase ranges, we'd find that Nerf and [OMW] (http://www.orangemodworks.com/Default.asp) would be competing to boast the best (safe) ranges.  That's good for us, and good for both companies.


Nothing to say on tactical rail accessories, because I know all of you - modders and stock nerfers alike - share my opinion about the shortage of them.


Obviously this post won't change much, but I was hoping to see some of you that agree, and some of you that have ""other opinions.""  If anyone hears news of nerf selling more accessories in larger quantities, a link would be appreciated.

We modded two Raider CS-35's for maximum potency (removed air restrictors, new springs) and then melded them together with a hacksaw, some sturdy cardboard supports, and lots of tape. What we ended up with is an absolute monster of a weapon. It holds 72 rounds when fully loaded, and with the dual-triggers, you can choose between single firing each gun or firing both simultaneously. As you see in the video, this gun can unload 72 darts in about 10 seconds, which would be about 400 darts a minute.
