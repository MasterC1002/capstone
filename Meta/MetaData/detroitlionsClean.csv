x-posted from /r/nfl.


*  Great person, team-player, great teammate, hard worker, and has improved dramatically every season, except perhaps 2012 when the entire offense slipped backwards with Greg Knapp as the OC.  

*  Tough.  He can get the stuffing knocked out of him and then stick his head right back into the mix as if nothing happened.  Eg., v Pittsburgh 2012 took a headshot and was carted off, came back against Atlanta and trucked Dunta Robinson.)

* Very good-to-great edge run blocker which goes with his physicality, toughness, and willingness to put in the work.  Will always block hard and won't complain even if his role for an entire game is to strictly block.

*  Above average route running.  He was miserable as a route runner when he first came into the league and now (2012) he is doing some really good things.  He's no Isaac Bruce, but he's not a liability in route running.  And this means that his track speed is translating more and more to football speed.

*  Very VERY good RAC WR.  Strength, speed, and toughness combine to make him very good in space.  At his best, he breaks tackles and then explodes upfield outracing DBs to the endzone.  

*  Can make impressive, acrobatic catches that make you think, ""YES, DHB HAS ARRIVED!""  

* Still inconsistent with basic catches.  Can drop passes at critical times--like a 5 yard square out on 3rd-and-3--that make you think, ""DHB WILL NEVER ARRIVE!""

*  Rarely seems very natural catching the ball and often seems to be fighting the ball  (""The ball is my friend."").  In traffic, he sometimes will come up with the ball, but more often than not, he won't, even if the defender never even touches the ball, but just distracts him enough.

*  Will sometimes make some elementary mental mistakes that leave you scratching your head, wondering if he's ever going to ""get it.""  

* CAN hand-catch, but prefers to body-catch.  His ability to reach out and snatch the ball out of the air has improved and is probably adequate at this point, but he still prefers to body-catch, ideally with the ball hitting him square in the numbers.  This leads him to try to align his body with the ball most times.  This means that he sometimes jumps when he doesn't need to and also that his best, most consistent routes are ones that have him facing the QB  (Curls, digs, crossing, or settling in zones).

* Is improving at 9-routes and double-moves.  Since he now is effective running intermediate routes, the double moves are more dangerous and he is able to get out of his breaks well to compromise defenders;  he has also improved in providing area between himself and the boundary on sideline routes (in the past, he would often run too close to the sideline), in getting separation, and in tracking and catching the ball deep.  He seems comfortable catching nice ""rainbow"" passes (fades as well as go routes).


Comparable to Demaryius Thomas.   He is similar in many ways to pre-emergent Thomas, but with (probably) more inconsistent hands and (perhaps) more raw speed.   But unlike Thomas, he has not emerged and there are certainly questions as to whether he will.  Still, what will make him interesting is that he does have this type of POTENTIAL.  And if he's in a conducive system that plays to his strengths--more like the 2011 Raiders--he could be a surprisingly good player.  Even if he never emerges into a true stud, he can make enough some big plays to make you cheer for him.

In other ways, he may be called the Tebow of WRs.  Fantastic guy that has 9 out of the 10 qualities you want.  But the missing 10th quality is the most important!  For Tebow, it's throwing the ball; for DHB it's catching the ball.

He's a good man and has worked hard and given his all.  I'm sure he will continue to do so and is a good person to have on a team.  If he were a 2nd or 3rd round pick, there would not be the kind of criticism leveled at him and he may still be on the Raiders.  I wish him well and hope that he does end up in a nice offensive system with a Great QB and hope that he can flourish. 

Having said all that, while he should be a positive addition to any team, it's hard to imagine actually allocating very much money to sign him.  It may end up being best for all involved for him to take a 1 yr, ""Prove it""-type deal.

Judge for yourself.

Presenting Infographic #3: [Detroit Lions](http://i.imgur.com/0PB8xPa.jpg?1)

Inspired by [this chart](http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/hockey/edmonton-oilers/history/index.html) I've begun making similar charts (though mine don't have the hover info) for the NFC North teams.

The information was primarily procured via Wikipedia as well as a bit from DetroitLions.com.  Now I'm sure you'll find that there are a few errors here and there.  I am happily accepting feedback and adjusting as I go.  I'll be making any necessary fixes and reposting down the road.  As you can also see, there's quite a bit missing in terms of presidents and GMs so if you have any info that can help me, it would be much appreciated.

When I did the Packer chart, I figured I had completely lucked out on the uniforms however it turns out there's a website called Heritage Sports Art that does paintings of all of the uniforms (lucky me!).

In case you're interested, here are my past charts:
[Green Bay Packers](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1cy1kc/i_created_a_visual_history_of_the_green_bay/)
[Minnesota Vikings](http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/1f8c9s/a_visual_history_of_the_minnesota_vikings/)

1349036810.0	10q44m	What the Lions have been doing wrong since 2011 and why we'll continue to lose if we keep trying.	ReaganSmashK	52	7	28	"Here's a compilation of things I've been ranting about since 2011 that the Lions need to stop doing to win. I was taken less seriously back then because we were winning games. Now hopefully people will listen.

1. Stop running draws on 1st down: They don't work, for most teams, ever, let alone a team without a running game. If you want to run the ball, use 2TE sets and audible into something for Shef if you don't feel good about the run. This playcalling is bad and the playcaller should feel bad.

2. PUT AN END TO THE WIDE 9 DEFENSIVE LINE: It's awful. It's just awful. For those of you who don't know, the wide 9 defense is where you spread out your defensive line to improve the pass rush. Sounds good right? Well not when the other team runs the ball more then they do pass. It leaves the middle wide open for RBs. Just stop it.

3. Stop being so god damn aggressive on special teams coverage: It's gotten out of hand. The ST coach is telling players to over-run their gaps to try to hit the returner for 2 or 3 yards less then they would if they stayed on their gaps. It's ridiculous. You risk a big return and the only reward you get is 2 or 3 yards back for the other team's offense. 

4. STAFFORD WINDOWS, LET HIM USE THEM: We've been wrecked on offense by the SF and now MIN Cover 2 defense. The reason? We succeeded against Cover 2 last season because our OC wasn't being super conservative. All of Staffords throws have been in front of his receivers and in front of all defenders. The playcaller isn't letting him use his windows to throw between defenders for big easy games. You won't let him dictate the pace of the game when you keep forcing him into short passes.

5. Empty backfield: As someone who actually has an X and O's football IQ, watching Stafford in an empty backfield is miserable. He needs an RB option blocking back there. 4 recievers, one guy blocking in the backfield. If that man has nobody to block, he options out into the flat for a dump-off. Stop, the, empty, back, field.

6. THE SHEF. USE HIM: He is basically a slower, white Calvin Johnson. We can't use him when you don't use 2 TEs, and when you don't allow the use of Stafford windows. I suppose they used him a lot last season, but so far, he's been a non-factor, and that's wrong.

7. Jim, we're not a running football team. Stop trying to make us one: We don't need a good RB, we need a mediocore one. Instead, he's trying to force mediocore RBs into LOOKING like good RBs by running the ball too much. Don't come at me with a pass/run ratio from this past game, because the lions were on pass on every down mode right to the end. It's the run/pass ratio that PUTS us into a pass on every down scenario that needs to be noted. You have one of the better QBs in the league and the best WR in the league. You don't put it in these rookies two out of 3 downs. Stop.

Summary: It's the play calling. It's not Stafford, it's not our running game, it's the play calling. Stop trying to be the Belichick of the NFC and being ""unpredictable."" All we do is run the wrong plays, regularly, until we're on 3rd and long and the defense KNOWS we're going to pass. That's the beauty of Stafford, everybody knows he's gonna throw, and he still completes the pass for a 1st down. We're given chance after chance thanks to him.

This game is still essentially a fluke, because we most likely would have won hadn't it been for the 2 awful special teams play. Hopefully by now the play callers know what works and doesn't work. They have a whole bye week to fix this shit. Spend it criticizing yourself, coaching staff, not the special teams."	t5_2rynx	True

edit: I'd also like to add that I think it's fair to attribute a fair amount of blame for this loss to the play calling. Consider our last drive. 3rd &amp; 5 around the 50. We could try to run a slant play to Calvin, which has been working all game, and go for a field goal to make it a 2 score game again, but instead we run the ball, punt it, and give the Colts a chance to win. Very disappointing. I also think that our offense going stagnant for periods of the game was because of the predictable play calling."	t5_2rynx	True

Unfortunately none of us got a picture and we realize how dumb it was, there were cameras from a news station (7 News) and a few other cameras from I am guessing the Lions.

I am not from detroit so I don't know where to look, I was wondering where I could look for pictures or if anybody knows where they the pictures are. This is something I want to get my father for his birthday in a few weeks

I'm a new fan after the [/r/nf](/r/nf) / [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) crossover so I'm looking forward to the new season. I asked about the Lions on [/r/nfl](/r/nfl) and got some good responses - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rrw4k/another_newbie_ish_detroit_lions/)

 Obviously I'm new so don't really know much of the franchise, just what I've read. Currently watching the game at The Cowboys ( 17-30 at the minute) on YouTube.

From what I know Stafford, Johnson (Megatron) and Suh are our best players. The franchise was run horribly until recently (0-16 in '08) but we've got better recently. From what I can gather we need better rushing next season and need a quality HB along with a few others in the draft (which I sort of understand)

 Barry Sanders is our greatest ever player. Someone put a curse on us in '58 (50 years later we went 0-16) and we play at Ford Field. 

From what I've been told this is one of the best times to start supporting the Lions so that's good. From what I've read supporting The Lions is like supporting my soccer team (Leeds United). A great fanbase but the team doesn't perform to the standards expected and we've been rubbish for ages.

I'm in The UK so won't get to see that many games but will try to watch as many as possible. 

I'm a soccer fan so if you have any questions regarding that I will be more than happy to answer."	t5_2rynx	True

1365014511.0	1blrfe	We need to win in Green Bay this year for my sanity.		47	5	23	I'm a 32 year old Lions fan living the heart of Packer country. I've went to every Packers vs. Lions game at Lambeau with the exception of 1998 ( came down with the flu ) since 1995. I was at the Suh Stomp spectacle at Ford Field two years ago on Thanksgiving. What i'm getting at is I've been to my share of Lions games over the years and I've never once seen the Lions win. I will once again be at Lambeau this year rocking my Honolulu Blue so let's hope this pathetic streak comes to an end!! 	t5_2rynx	True

1323650729.0	n9158	Update: Lions Playoff Scenarios	sosuhme	44	1	17	"Things look much more optimistic this week, although we have some uncommon luck to thank.

It's likely we will win 1 or 2 more games this season.

That puts us at 9-7 or 10-6.

The Falcons are in pretty good shape in terms of grabbing the 5th seed after an impressive comeback against the Panthers. I would be surprised if they didn't win at least two more games, which at 10-6 would give them the likely tiebreaker over us.

The Bears OT loss after a game of bad luck did a lot for us. They certainly aren't out of the race but will need to win at least 2 more games to have a real chance. They will have to hope that we lose more than just 1 game. This is all assuming that both teams lose to the Packers, so an upset by either team would likely have the final say in the standings.

As far as NFC East, things will become more clear tonight, but due to the Giants and Cowboys having 2 remaining games against each other it would be very unlikely for both to have enough wins to compete.

In terms of playoff berths, we are still likely headed for the 6th seed. The Saints, however, are tied for overall record with the 49ers and although they are losing the tiebreakers right now, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Saints finish with a better record and get the 2nd seed meaning that we would face the 49ers in the first round. I'm not sure which one I prefer, but I watched the Cardinals beat the 49ers tonight, so it's possible that we are seeing a downturn.

I've been drinking since the Lions started trying to lose, so forgive any grammar mistakes."	t5_2rynx	True

Suh plays hard whistle to whistle and I can appreciate that. The guy is already rich with a (60 million dollar contract) and has a great education (Engineering degree from Nebraska). The fact that this guy goes so hard every down and with reckless abandon is a great thing to watch because he is certainly not doing it to benefit himself. Instead of chastising him people should want more players to emulate him.
The stomp was bad but he has since learned from that. It was an emotional response to whatever was going on at the bottom of that pile. Give the guy a break and get over it. The guy takes intimidation and domination to the next level and he was virtually unblockable during that Texans game.

It's not the country or the culture shock or the difficulty of the school that makes me homesick, but rather it is Michigan that makes me so depressed. I want to go back to my daily lifestyle. I want to eat nasty pizza at epicurious. I want to smoke hookah in Dearborn. I want to go back to Wilderness State park by Mackinac Island. I miss having a car and cruising down I-75. But I can't and I've been disconnected from my hometown. And the only thing that I remained truly connected to was this Detroit Lions team. And you Detroit Lions fans. Imagine living in a place where NO ONE you know watches or cares for football, they're more concerned with an argument as to why it is called football. Nevertheless, our historic season comes to an end. And that means one less linkage back to Detroit. This depresses me. And I felt like I had to release it, to those that have at least helped me along the way. Thank you for your unknowing support. And here's to Next Season.

Sh4d0wlynk	44	9	21	"I was actually a bit angry because I wanted to see the end of the Lions-Vikings game last week,  but they had to cut to the Packers game. I know we are in the same division. I hope you fail when we play each other. That being said, I root for you the rest of the time. I hope that you are the wild card this year (obviously I'm rooting for the Packers to win the division, and we SEEM to have a pretty easy schedule).

I would love to see 11-0 Packers v.s. 11-0 Lions on Thanksgiving. I think it would be epic. I do have a feeling the Lions will beat the Pack on Thanksgiving.

Anyways, great to see them doing so well!

We need to relax.

Remember where we were 4 years ago. Totally devoid of talent. Look where we are now. On the verge of competitive in the best division in the league.

Did we take a big step forward this year? Well... Yes and no.

Let's be honest about last year. How many games did we barely win? And then there's the whole thing with the Bears completely collapsing after Cutler and Forte went out. We probably shouldn't have made the playoffs in the first place. We never beat a really good team and we never found consistency. Our players were highly emotional, which led to some amazing plays, but some serious issues. Stafford had an amazing season for his first full year, but was majorly inconsistent and was often on the receiving end of some serious luck if you look at his adjusted INT ratios. We weren't ready to compete just yet.

Forgetting all the drama, which really hasn't proven to mean much at all, the Lions had a solid offseason. A draft that many people questioned at the time, but has proven to be pretty good, and a lot of work on not letting emotions dictate the game.

Unfortunately, then the injuries started. Obviously Broyles came into things banged up, so did LeShoure who was still recovering. Our secondary immediately started to fall apart even in the preseason, and of course Calvin has been at various stages of not 100% all season. I said before the season that I thought the team who was most likely to win the division would be the team that stayed the healthiest. The Lions have not been that team by a long shot. It's affected all three phases as even our regular special teams players haven't been able to focus on their jobs while filling in elsewhere.

Luck has bitten us in other ways as well. We ruled turnover differential last year. We were 3rd in the league (I believe) in TOD, that's amazing. We were picking off QBs at will and forcing fumbles left and right. I already mentioned Stafford's favorable fortune in this area as well. Part of the problem has been our constantly shuffling secondary, who even last year were more consistently healthy. Part of it has been the teams we have faced, who are largely conservative and run oriented teams. Part of it is luck. We were lucky in that area last year, we haven't been this year. Take a look at the 49ers defense from last year to this year and the difference in turnovers created. It's huge, and they essentially have the exact same defense they had last year. You just can't count on TOD maintaining constant from year to year.

So, how upset should we be if we miss the playoffs this year? I argue, not very. It's not time for us to be so presumptive about our position. The team still has major depth issues that even 4 years of solid drafts haven't been able to completely make up for. Speaking of drafts, we had terrible timing for taking 3 high draft picks in a row with Johnson, Stafford, and Suh. Because they came in the limbo before the new rookie wage scale, we were forced to pay up the ass for them from the get go. Imagine the kind of trades we'd have been able to make if we weren't paying such a huge chunk of our salary cap to 3 players. That is a MAJOR disadvantage, and one that could take a few more years to overcome.

But I'm not trying to come off as completely pessimistic either. It's quite likely that ST will be a focus this offseason. Were it not for special teams issues, we could just as easily be sitting at 7-2, or better. Stafford started the year rough, but in the last 3 games he's looked great. The kid is still young and obviously learning. We've got two young WRs who just need to find consistency. We finally have what looks like a running game. Not spectacular, but enough to provide balance. On defense, we have great players all over the field. They looked pretty damn good early in the year and with a little more luck with health and depth next year, they could easily be top 10 or better.

I'm not sure what the rush is, frankly. We suffered for so long, let's just be happy we have potential for once.

Edit: Also, I should say, the Bears defense is on the verge of losing it's 3 of it's best players to age while their offense is still stagnant. They are likely to trend down. The Packers have shown they are human and while they have the best QB in the league, they might be in trouble elsewhere. They will remain tough, but not invincible. The Vikings are having a fluke year. They are decent, but not 6-3 good. They will still struggle to finish 8-8 in my opinion. I'd attribute both of our losses to them largely to ST and field position."	t5_2rynx	True

* Kansas City is coming off of a big psychological blow in week 1 and will be desperate to redeem themselves.  This will lead to turnovers.

* Without Eric Berry the Chief's pass D is even weaker than it was last week when they gave up 4 pass TDs.  Stafford will exploit this for multiple pass TDs.

* Detroit's front 4 will stuff the Chief's run game and cause lots of 3-and-outs in the first half, effectively controlling the pace of the game like they did to Tampa Bay.

1325509747.0	nzqov	Analysis of Stafford.	sosuhme	41	6	16	"Regardless of what happens in the post season, talk of Stafford and where he belongs on the list of top QBs will be rampant in the offseason. Arm yourself.

First, the statistical stuff.

Despite having only the 3rd most yards this season, Stafford is one of only 4 QBs (Stafford, Brees (2 times), Brady, Marino) to ever throw for more than 5000 yards.

Stafford finished the season with the 3rd highest passer rating for a QB under the age of 26. The other two were Marino with a rating of 108.9 at 23 and Culpepper with a rating of 98 at 23.

The only QB under the age of 24 with a higher completion percentage in a season was Marino in his record setting year.

A quick side note. The more I look through stats, the more it looks like the only QB under 25 to have a more impressive season in the history of the NFL was Marino in '84.

Stafford threw for the 7th most TDs of any QB in history following Peyton, Brady, Brees, Rogers, and Marino (2 times).

Though the Giants outscored the Lions by 16 points in the 4th quarter of games this year, the Lions actually outscored the Giants by 50 points in the second half of games. While the Giants trailed at one point in 8 of their 9 wins this year, the Lions were only a game behind that at 7 games. Frankly, this is a stupid argument though as it over values comebacks. I would much rather see us get the lead and hold it more often.

I'm moving into a bit more subjective territory now.

That said, one of the most relevant statistics regarding Stafford is that he threw for the 3rd most attempts of any QB in history behind Peyton in 2010 and Drew Bledsoe in 1994. For him to be only 23 and carry that much burden is incredible. The Lions won or lost solely on the play of Stafford this year and despite having a few games affected by his broken finger, he was remarkably consistent, as seen by his completion percentage and that he had 10 games above a 100 passer rating. 

Consistency is constantly what people point to when they want to talk about how Stafford isn't a top QB yet. I won't necessarily disagree, but let's talk about consistency. 41 TDs to 16 interceptions (we all know 10 of those interceptions came while he was wearing the glove, but for now I'm just going to pass on that). That's a ratio of 2.5625:1. Of QBs who played 14+ games (basically, take away Schaub) only Brees, Brady, Rogers, Romo, and Smith had better ratios. With 17 TDs and 5 interceptions, the data pool on Smith is too low to really compare him to the others. Anyway, regardless of his injury, 2.5625:1 is a damn consistent number. When you look at the other QBs this year, there are only a few who were arguably more consistent. Add on top of that the 5th highest completion percentage, despite his ridiculous number of attempts, and you start wondering why this is even a topic of debate. Of course, one good year is not enough to go on as far as whether or not a QB will be consistent, but as far as the connotation that he isn't consistent, bullshit, there is more supporting evidence that he is than vice versa.

Of course people talk about Megatron. And the truth is, it is a huge advantage and would be for any QB. However, before this year 81 was considered a top five WR by most, but after this year he is hands down #1. He had 561 more yards and 4 more TDs this year than last (also, 3 of his 12 TDs last year came in the one game that Stafford both started and finished).

Aside from boosting Megatrons stat line, Stafford was able to maintain production for Pettigrew, Burleson, and Scheffler, while giving Titus Young a very respectable 607 yard, 6 TD rookie season. It was the 7th most yards for a rookie receiver and the 4th most TDs. The guys above him are A.J. Green, Greg Little, and Doug Baldwin, who are primary receivers, and Torrey Smith, Denarius Moore and Julio Jones, who are their teams secondary targets. Titus Young is our 4th leading receiver.

That's as much as I feel like digging up right now. Feel free to add to this with anything you can think of and be ready to plead the case for Stafford this offseason. Of course, I should add, if he wins the Super Bowl, we probably won't need to do much pleading."	t5_2rynx	True

Tampa's defense aren't slouches and we managed to run the ball effectively, that's a big win for us. Best looked great and the change up backs both did their jobs perfectly. We should feel pretty good about this.

Tulloch proved his worth. What a player. His addition to the run defense was phenomenal, and seeing him in the backfield after Freeman was a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a pro-bowl year this year, just needs some name recognition.

I was very relieved to see improved play out of our DBs today. It wasn't perfect and Mike Williams still hauled in a couple more passes than I would have liked, but they covered well and didn't miss a lot of tackles. The prevent defense worked to perfection. I got very worried because we have lost so many games in the last minutes due to big pass plays, but they really handled it well.

Our biggest problem is still those moments in the game where we lose focus and make mistakes. This game was a lot more one sided than the score suggests, and we won't always get away with out throwing our opponents if we make stupid mistakes. I see a direct parallel with the Chargers. Hopefully things will get majorly cleaned up over the week.

1353640741.0	13nf5d	I accidentally became a Lions fan today (xposted from /r/nfl)	Chiggie	33	5	16	"I am not a football fan, really. I like to play Tecmo Bowl and watch the Longest Yard, but nothing fanatic. I'm more of a baseball guy.

What I do love is FANTASY football. I rarely ever watch the games and have never had a favorite team. I just liked breaking down the stats and working on predictions. It's pretty much a numbers game to me, and I ended up learning football along the way.

So, I had to work today and the only thing we had for entertainment was the Lions/Texans game. Seeing as I have Stafford, C.Johnson, Leshoure, and at different points in the season I also had Kevin Smith and Titus Young I thought, what the hell. My fate has been in these guys' hands so much maybe it will be fun to see it happen in front of me.

So, the game was really great and when it went into overtime I thought, awesome, the longer these guys are on the field the better for me. If you saw it you know that these guys almost ran down the clock just fighting back and forth to get into field goal range. It was exciting as hell.

But, something weird happened. I live in northwest Louisiana. That means Saints and Texans fans. But the more I watched, with everyone around me just waiting for the Texans to win, the more I wanted Detroit to win.

You have to understand, it doesn't matter to me who wins a game. I want the players to do well, so to hell with the game as long as I get my points, you know? But, I found myself cheering louder and louder every time they kept it alive, and being almost crushed when they lost (everybody in the world knew he was down, asshat refs).

So, there I was. I started the day a cold numbers player, ended the day a fan. What the hell am I going to do as a Detroit fan in Louisiana?

TL; DR: Today I accidentally became a Lions fan."	t5_2rynx	True

There are 3 separate video files in the zip folder, one for the first half, another for the 3rd quarter, another for the 4th quarter. The video format is .flv, so you may need to play it using realplayer as opposed to the common windows media player to get the game to play at normal speed as opposed to slo-mo or fastforward, which happens with windows player sometimes.

The reason for the odd video format is the fact that the game was recorded off a stream (with the written consent of the NFL, of course of course) that broadcasts using flash player. If I were to convert .flv to something more common like .wmv, the conversion would most likely cause audio lag, frames to skip, and the file size would be around 4-5gb. So yeah, keeping it raw.

The download time is gonna vary user to user because we all don't have the same download speed, but it's highly unlikely it takes more then half an hour to download for most users.

The play calling on every side of the ball is horrible. It's predictable and does not adapt to the situation. We run the ball WAY too much. You know when the run actually works? When we get a successful pass attempt. 

They refuse to make any real changes to the schemes. Why is Logan our returner? Him fumbling is nothing new. Him being worthless in terms of return yards is nothing new. I always CRINGE when it's return time. You know why? Because he drops the ball SO MUCH! I only recall one, maybe two returns worth noting. It's amazing when you compare Logan to the other teams returner. Pettigrew? What he does is nothing new. I get not dropping him to #2, because you want to see if he can improve. He clearly hasn't. Scheffler is the most solid TE we have. IDC if he can't block. Put in two TEs if you have to. Scheffler makes catches Pettigrew would never make in his life.

What has Schwartz even done? The only good thing he's done is bring in old Titan players like Tulloch.

You know the fumble by Bell at the goal line? WHY WAS HE EVEN IN THE GAME? They did it AGAIN. They put in Bell in the redzone and do not use LeShoure. LeShoure was suppose to be our GOAL LINE RB. They did this exact thing against the Titans. LeShoure didn't see one snap in the final redzone drive.

Look at the defense. Even the announcers said we blitz like idiots. Our LBs are not blitzing LBs. They are coverage LBs. The guys who get the tackles. The lineman are actually doing their job. What they did last night is nothing knew. We have more TDs on offense, then TDs allowed on defense. 

We've played against some of the TOP RBs in the game.

SJax, Gore, CJ2K, AP, Vick, McCoy, Forte.

SJax: Combined 70 yards, 53 rushing.

Gore: Combined 105, 89 rushing.

CJ2K: Combined 19, 12 rushing.

AP: Combined 122, 102 rushing.

Vick: 59 Rushing.

McCoy: Combined 48, 22 rushing.

Forte: Combined 100, 96 rushing. 

These are THE TOP RBs in the game and it's not stopping yet. We have to play Lynch next week, MAYBE MJD, AP, Foster, Turner, and Forte again this season. Only one time did a RB get over 102 yards rushing and it was AP. They're only getting these high numbers, because teams were wanting to run the ball and kill time. Even then, these numbers are nothing. These guys are capable of straight killing teams. The fact we stopped Forte from being a factor in the passing game is why it was so close. I had no doubt he'd be taken out of the game. I even benched him and started Marshall.

So defense isn't an issue really. Yeah, we WILL allow a TD to their #1 WR. It's just going to happen until one of our #2 CBs step up. Mainly, because for some UNKNOWN REASON they're not forcing Houston on their #1 WR. Why was A. Smith covering Marshall last night? 

So what we had fumbles. Yea, take those away we win. So what if Megatron had his one bad game. We lost because of horrible coaching. 

This team is not a team that uses the run to setup the pass. HOW LONG DO THEY NEED TO REALIZE THIS? Setup the run with the pass and THEN run. Our best runs last night were RIGHT after a decent yardage pass. 

DONT FUCKING RUN LESHOURE UP THE MIDDLE ON FIRST AND TEN FOR NO REASON! They do goal line rushes for some ungodly reason. LeShoure was stopped horribly multiple times on these rushes.

The fact we had so many turnovers that were costly, shows how good this team can be. The limiting factor is coaching.

Right now, fire at least the offensive coordinator. Even tho the defense has been good, the plays are keeping it back and what not. You can't fire everyone at once. Work your way to them and eventually to Schwartz.

1329811382.0	pz344	How a Packers fan views the Lions First round pick	thatkuhlkid	24	1	7	"*Disclaimer: I am a Packer's fan, but I pay very close attention to the entire NFCN. Know thy enemy and what not...*

I've seen a lot of talk about the Lion's first round pick, so I thought I'd do a little digging. The Lions' last years draft class was a rough one for Schwartz. He only had 5 picks and 3 of them didn't play at all. (Leshoure tore his achilles, I don't believe Hogue was activated for a single game, and the T that was drafted in the 7th was arrested recently).

The Lions also may run into some cap issues this year as they are projected to be close to the cap with only 37 players under contract. I realize that re-signing Calvin could free up as much as 8M, but the lions need to try to re-sign Avril and Tulloch, tender Levy and Lee-Hill, and either re-sign or replace their starting CB and LT, and neither of those positions are cheap.

In Kiper's last draft I saw that he chose Janoris Jenkins as a possible pick for the Lions. I can agree that CB is a position of need, but Jenkins was convicted of assaulting a police officer. I'm all for looking the other way on minor off the field issues such as testing positive for marijuana, but assaulting a Police officer is a serious offense and speaks to some deeper issues that could arise again.

So who do I see the Lions going with? I think that Mike Adams (OT out of OH ST) would be a solid pick that would realistically be available at 23. He is a solid prospect and as ready to start in the NFL as any OT in the draft (short of Kalil). 

If he isn't there, I could see them grabbing Nick Perry ( DE out of USC). I know Lions fans probably don't want another pass rusher with a high pick, but the fact of the matter is that Avril may not be returning and in a pass happy league, nothing is more important than being able to get at the QB. The Giants did just win a SB with this formula... 

Another direction they could go is Peter Konz (C from Wis). Centers aren't generally taken in the first round, but Konz is an animal. With Raiola turning 34 next season, he is going to need replacing and I can think of no higher priority than protecting the franchise (Stafford).

While I don't believe the Lions will move up in the draft, it's always a possibility. 

According to the [draft value chart](http://www.draftcountdown.com/features/Value-Chart.php), if the Lions were to bundle their first and second, they could possibly trade up to the 14th spot, but more realistically the 15th spot.

If they were to bundle their first and 3rd, they could move to pick 17, and their 1st and 4th would move them to the 20th spot.

I know this was long, and I'm not sure how it will be received as I haven't posted anything like this to another teams subreddit, but I thought I'd throw my 2 cents out there. Feel free to correct any ill assumptions that I may have made as I'm sure there are fans out there who know more about the Lions than me. I look forward to your thoughts.

1324474868.0	nl89r	Just how good will Stafford be?	sosuhme	24	0	29	"So... With Aaron Rogers looking like he may very well end up being the best QB of all time (I don't mean to get ahead of myself, just that he is on pace), I decided to look at how things started off for him, and compare them to Stafford.

Seeing as how Rogers spent his first three years on the bench and Stafford spent the first two years mostly injured, I'm going to skip straight to comparing the 2008 version of Rogers and the current stats of Stafford.

On 536 attempts Rogers completed 341 for a completion rate of 63.6%. After 14 games Stafford has a whopping 568 attempts and 356 completions for 62.7%. There's a couple things to look at here. First of all, the completion percentage for Stafford is .9% worse. Without crunching numbers I think that equates to about 9 more completions Stafford would have had if his percentage was the same. What the reason for the lower percentage might be is up for debate.

Next up, we've got yardage. Rogers threw for 4,038 and had his average yards per catch at 7.5. Stafford is already above his total yards with 4,145 and is averaging a slightly lower 7.3 ypc. When you look at that you can tell that the result of Staffords higher number of attempts is netting him more yards. Without doing as much research as I probably should on the subject, I'm going to guess that the 2008 Packers were not as relient on the pass game as we have been this year. Anyway, .2 ypc is not enough of a difference to warrant too much discussion.

In 2008, Rogers had a total of 28 TDs and 13 interceptions. Any time you have half as many interceptions as you have TDs, you are doing pretty good. Although Stafford already has one more interception than Rogers had in 2008, he is sitting at 33 TDs on the year as well. This is when I will get into Staffords finger injury. In the first eight games of the season, Stafford only had 4 interceptions to his 19 TDs, and in the last three games he has only had 1 interception to 7 TDs. That means in a three game span he racked up 9 interceptions to only 7 touchdowns. To me, that is a likely sign of him playing with an injured finger. If he hadn't returned to form as it healed, I might have been more willing to accept that it was mental issues or overall regression, but looking at the numbers shows a very clear trend to the contrary. Anyway, he is well on pace, despite the injury, to have a better TD to interception ratio than Rogers in 2008.

Sack numbers will likely be almost identical, nothing of interest there.

The number that really caught my eye here was passer rating. Through 14 games Stafford has an identical passer rating to the one Rogers had in 2008, 93.8. I'm not a believer that passer rating is a perfect system, but it's a pretty good indicator of performance. This should leave you all feeling optimistic about the future.

In fact, the only place where Stafford is lacking significantly compared to Rogers is he has less than half as many rushing yards, but to the contrary, he has half as many fumbles, so I'll count that as a draw.

So how good will he be? I have no idea, but the ceiling is about as high as it gets on this one."	t5_2rynx	True
1323103812.0	n190o	Why yesterday was a good day for the Lions.	nevillebanks	25	1	18	"First off, all of the wild card teams in the NFC lost, and the Lions had the second hardest game to the Giants. Second of all the Bears lost Forte and now have basically no offense.

Current Playoff Picture

Bears, Lions and Falcons and 7-5 and will not be division champs (unless the Falcons somehow catch the Saints)

Cowboys are 7-5 and lead NFC East, Giants are 6-6.

Bears have @Denver, Seattle, @GB, @Minn     
Without Cutler and probably Forte for all 4 games, I think they will lost to both Denver and GB, and could lose to Seattle the way the are playing, and could also lose to Minn. IMHO they will go 2-2 or 1-3 to finish 8-8 or 9-7

Lions have Minn, @Oak, SD, @GB                         
Minn should be a win, as should SD. After the way Oakland got killed by Miami, they have a good chance to beat Oak. GB will most likely be a loss unless they rest starters. IMHO they will go 3-1 or 2-2 to finish 10-6 or 9-7

Falcons have @Car, Jac, @No, TB
Falcons should win at least two of the three against Car, Jac and TB, if not all three. They will most llikely lose to NO. IMHO they will go 3-1 or 2-2 to finish 10-6 or 9-7

Giants have @Dal, Wash, Jets, Dal.    
Dallas have NYG, @TB, Philly, NYG

Since they play each other twice, the best record the division runner up could have is 9-7 (If Giants go 4-0, finish 10-6 then Cowboys go 2-2 and finish 9-7 or Giants and Cowboys go 3-1, Giants finish 9-7, Cowboys finish 10-6). The Giants have lost 4 straight, and I would expect them to drop at least one if not both to the Cowboys, and probably another one to the Jets or the Redskins. IMHO the Cowboys win the NFC East and the Giants finish 8-8

Summary                                
Lions- 10-6 or 9-7
Falcons- 10-6 or 9-7
Bears- 9-7 or 8-8
Giants- 8-8

For tiebreaker if Lions, Falcons, and Bears go 9-7 the Falcons will get in. Then between the Lions and the Bears, the Lions would most likely advance due to the record vs. common opponents. Lions are 1-1 vs. Uncommon opponents (SF and Dal). Chicago is 1-0(Philly) with Seattle left to play, and to get to 9-7 Chicago will likely need to beat Seattle, raising their Uncommon opponent record to 2-0. If this happens, then then Detroit advance with better record against common opponents.

TL;DR: Lions should still make the playoffs.

I'm just waiting for the league to announce the schedule so I can start making plans to come down for the Cowboys game this year.

I'm looking forward to about 1000 yards of passing between Stafford/Johnson and Romo/Bryant.

I've never been to Ford Field so hoping I can get some friendly advice for a visiting fan. What section do the visitors usually sit in? (I'll be bringing my 4 year old to his first game... so if there's a ""dawg pound"" equivalent for your team, I'd like to avoid it!).

Tips on places to stay near the stadium, parking, eating - all that stuff will really help me out.

I'm also a Lions fan (and a big Wolverines fan, but booooo Red Wings) and I really thought you guys were on the brink of something a few years ago... hope you can turn it around a bit this year. You've got something special with Stafford and Johnson.

I can't take this signing seriously, so I'm not grading it seriously either. The fact that the Bears think they're actually upgrading J'Marcus Webb at left tackle by obtaining Jermon Bushrod is an absolute joke. In fact, I really don't think the front office has watched a second of Bushrod's tape. 

Bushrod allowed tons of pressures every week. The reason his sack total was so low was because Drew Brees released the ball so quickly. Bushrod's sack numbers will increase exponentially as he's trying to block for Jay Cutler. That means Cutler will likely miss multiple games due to injury yet again. The Bears would be better off with Webb manning the blind-side position again. I find it so ridiculous that an NFL front office would pay so much money to a pedestrian player.

1367105175.0	1d8qw8	Draft Recap	AUae13	26	4	14	"Now that the draft is over, it's obviously time to start evaluating it. Why wait, right?

We went in with no obvious starters at LT, RG, RT, DE, OLB, CB2, WR2, or KR, although we did have some pieces to play with, especially at corner, wide receiver, and on the o-line. The picks we made tell us something about how we plan to use some of the pieces we already had.

**Round 1: Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU:** This was a lucky co-occurance of BPA and need. Ansah won't be ready to play at a high level week one, but he has a very good chance of becoming an outstanding player. We now have 3 first round picks on the defensive line, which speaks to Schwartz's commitment to that position group.

**Round 2: Darius Slay, CB, Miss St:** This pick confused me somewhat. Slay is a high upside corner who hasn't yet become terribly good. He, like Ansah, probably won't be ready to start week one. He has the measurables to become a serviceable starter though. This also tells us that the front office doesn't have the faith in the triad of corners taken last year as some of us fans do.

**Round 3: Larry Warford, OG, Kentucky:** An easy slam-dunk pick. Will be the first of our rookies to start and make an impact. Further, it means that we trust Reiff to play on the outside, which means that Fox and Hilliard only have to hold one spot between them. Our Oline next year is pretty much established just by this pick.

**Round 4: Devin Taylor, DE, USCe:** I like this guy as a hedge against Ansah. He doesn't have the upside of Ansah, but is more polished now. I expect him to strongly compete with Willie Young for a starting job until Ansah is ready.

**Round 5: Sam Martin, P, App State:** I hate this pick. A good punter is a weapon, yes. But punters are very nearly fungible goods - they're easily replaced. We didn't upgrade *that* much by taking this pick. I'd rather have had an impact WR here or a backup DT or S. But, on the flip side, it was the bottom of the fifth round, and this is a guaranteed player. So there's that. 

**Round 6: Corey Fuller, WR, VT:** I don't love Fuller. I don't think he's good enough to start, and I don't think backup outside reciever was a big need. I would much more rather have taken a risk on Da'rick Rodgers or Marquess Wilson with this pick. Yes, they may have been Titus Young 2.0, but the talent was worth the character risk in the 6th. I doubt Fuller will make the team.

**Round 6: Theo Riddick, RB/WR, Notre Dame:** I like Riddick as a WR, less as a running back. After thinking about it, I suspect he's a depth slot WR, hedging against Burleson or Broyles not being ready for the season. For that role, I don't dislike the pick. He may also be useful on special teams as a returner or gunner.

**Round 7: Michael Williams, Hback, Alabama:** Well, we needed an H-back since Helelr is gone. Williams is a competent player, so there's that. Has a good shot of making the roster as a 3rd TE / Hback. Will never threaten to start at TE though, so don't confuse him for a replacement for Scheffler or Pettigrew as their contracts expire.

**Round 7, Brandon Hepburn, ILB, FAMU:** I'll be honest, I'd never heard of Hepburn. I guess he'll be a practice squadder who will try to make the special teams units. Obviously low expectations here, but we can hope.

Altogether, I think we did a good job with linemen on both sides. We skipped OLB entirely, so obviously we have some degree of faith in Whitehead and Palmer there. We also skipped center entirely, so we either trust Nagy (possible), or have a desperate need to address the future at safety next year. Other than those two spots, we did a decent job of getting high-potential players at spots of need, which is about all we could hope for from the draft."	t5_2rynx	True

Ok we gave up a fifth round draft pick for this guy towards the end of last season for some reason but I have no idea why. 

I mean I get it was for depth or whatever because all of our WRs were dying by the end of the season so you would expect him to take snaps as WR2 right?

NOPE we put fucking Kris ""onecatchwonder"" Durham in front of him and he takes way more snaps in the last two games whan M80. Not to mention Thomas has a strong case of butterfingers.

Apparently he can return kicks or punts because supposedly he's really fast right?

NOPE fucking Stefan Logan still returns shit after the trade and continues to suck ass. Then when we finally bench him, Bell returns kicks instead.

Ok well we can use his speed for endarounds like we did with Burleson right?

NOPE not once. We never used him on a run play all season. 

Ok so to recap we gave up a fifth round pick for a WR who can't catch, can't return kicks or punts, or even run the ball for us. 

He is essentially worthless to the team and a total waste of potential talent we could have drafted. I have no idea why we traded for him or why he's still on the roster now. Did we not know he sucked before trading for him?

This is not a good epiphany, but the kind that forces you to stare in the mirror and admit your own selfish shortcomings.  This is just my own personal experience, but I consider this place to be somewhat of my family in some ways and I wanted to share.  This is what brought me a little bit of peace after yet another disappointing loss and maybe it will do the same for you.

After the loss at home today and I finally calmed down a bit; I started thinking about the importance of this game.  This game was fairly important if there was any outside shot of us making the playoffs this year, although I suspect the odds of that were pretty low anyways.  The truth is though, that of all the games played this week the most important one was played by a 1-9 team and a 3-7 team.  Two teams with pretty much nothing to play for except draft picks.

The Chiefs, the Chiefs organization, and the entire Chiefs fan base needed a win this week more than anyone else.  My heart truly goes out to all of them.

We place so much importance on our teams and our players.  We hate the players that cost us games (looking at you Pettigrew) and idolize the ones that win us games (All Hail Megatron!).  The truth is that professional athletes are regular people with regular problems just like us.  They are not invincible.  

It's one thing to intellectually know that.  It's another thing entirely to *know* that.  

Imagine if you will that this had happened to one of our beloved Lions (no matter who it may have been).  I literally would be beside myself with grief.  Grief for people I have never met.  Not only would it be the first tears I've shed since my wedding day, but a hell of a lot more too.  (If you are reading this... sorry babe).

I would imagine that many of you feel the same way I do about this team.  The truth is that for whatever reason, I love them.  I don't just love them, I am IN love with them.  I love them all as if I know them personally.  Even the screw ups and the people I want cut immediately.  As long as they are in a Lions uniform, I love them all even in spite of their shortcomings. 

The loss this week and every other week may infuriate us.  It may cause us to have heart attacks and brain aneurysms.  This week may have flushed our playoff hopes down the drain this year.

I can think of more plays than I can count of my hands and feet that went very badly for us - namely Staff staring down Megatron, bad penalties, Hanson's unlucky dink, that stupid fucking bounce at the end (seriously, Hanson pulls out his 56 degree wedge, but also grabbed a ProV1? Shit stopped on a dime, totally whack)... but remember who was on the other side of the field. Literally the best team in the NFL. At home. In their time zone. Considering those circumstances alone, we did pretty well, I'd say.

Only 1 turnover, and only two sacks. I'm pretty sure we went backwards at most *three* times on offense. How many times did we give the Niners a loss on offense? 7, 8 times? While they're not known for having a dynamite offense, they're still probably the most efficient machine in the league right now and have the weapons to produce serious firepower if needed. Gore is a power back with moves on the side - the perfect combination (not an agile back with some power on the side, a phased out style of back that we unfortunately have in Smith/Best) - Vernon Davis has to be the best TE right now - hands, power, speed, composure - Moss, Crabtree, Manningham, and Ginn make up an unfair plethora of targets for Alex Smith to choose from, and Alex Smith doesn't throw interceptions. He doesn't. He now has a system to rely on and a great mental foundation to support all of his decisions.

And David Fucking Akers.

Don't even need to talk about the defense either.

So this is a great fucking team we played against. And our tackling was god fucking awful, sure. That's the one aspect of the Lions that has remained **completely** unchanged in the last 10-12 years. Does  Gunther need to go?

All I'm saying is it's okay to lose to the San Francisco 49ers of 2012 on the road, possibly jet-lagged, and on national TV with an even later start. And on top of that in Week 2? Hell yeah, still love our chances.

I guess I'm saying that because it doesn't feel right. ;_;

I've gotten the impression that people have forgotten why we drafted LeShoure where we did. He was drafted to be the Thunder to Best's Lightning. He was never supposed to be the big play guy. He was supposed to be the guy who got extra yards out of bad situations. And even though he was forced to carry the majority of the load this last year, that's what he did.

I was re-watching the highlights just now and it seems like 1 of 2 things happened on every play. Either he was run out of bounds after getting a respectable gain, or he was swarmed after breaking through the line. Very rarely was he brought down by one guy in space. I know we want to see a guy breaking tons of tackles and juking all over the place to make guys miss, but that was never what LeShoure was supposed to bring to us.

On the flip side, I'm also sitting here watching the Lions/Bucs game that got posted last night, and Best really struggled on runs where he didn't have a wide open lane or he bounced to the outside. It was a match made in heaven, even if our line blows at run blocking.

I don't know if the matchup with Bush is quite as perfect, but I am very excited to see what he can do in a role more like the one we drafted him to play. Not to mention, he'll come into the season healthier than he ever has been.

To help cure the boredom, I'll do what I can to look up stats/watch old games, etc.

This got me thinking...What is your favorite/most memorable Lions game? Could be watched on TV/attended, past or present, doesn't matter.

I have a few:

* 1999 vs Washington - My family used to have season tickets for the Silverdome, I can still remember going to those games as a kid. I used to be a huge Michigan fan and remember to this day the 1999 game vs Washington where Desmond has his debut PR TD. 

* 2011 vs Chicago - The return of the Detroit Lions to MNF. I was lucky enough to be in attendance for that game and remember just what a great atmosphere it was. Two plays I remember well was the TD catch by Calvin and the 88 Yard run up the middle by Jahvid Best.

* 2011 Vs Dallas - Taking emotion out the the equation, This was the best game I have seen the Lions play. In Calvin's coming out game to the rest of the NFL, I remember Rob Ryan saying that he would be the third best WR on Dallas that year. Specifically remember that catch in the back of the end zone with two defenders draped all over him. What a comeback, what a game.

* 1995 @ Philly - I think as a Lions fan we have at least one memorable epic Lions loss burned into our memory. For me, this game is it. In a wildcard game played @ philly, I remember Rodney Pete throwing the ball all over the field and the game not even being close. "	t5_2rynx	True

Badass defensive end. Non-stop motor, great size. This defense needs production at defensive end to be effective, and the Blitzkrieg (I'm giving him that nickname) will give them that and more. 

[Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbGvKbXSpQ)

*Luke Joeckel (T)

One of the best tackle prospects in a decade. Put him at either right or left since Reiff can easily man the other. When you consider too that the Lions will have the services of Bill Nagy, suddenly their line gets a lot scarier for opponents in the NFC North. 

*Jarvis Jones (OLB/DE)

An elite talent at outside linebacker, he could give the Lions defense some razor sharp teeth. 

[Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJsBr8HqsEA)

*Damontre Moore (DE)

If any of the above three are gone, Moore would be a solid pickup to upgrade the Lions pass rush. Plug him in at defensive end, and let Avril and KVB go. The Lions would immediately have a younger, more talented, and cheaper defensive line. 

[Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxj59C-Xzag)

*Chance Warmack (G)

You want a run game? You got one with Warmack. This monster could give the Lions some beef and talent they sorely need on the interior on their offensive line. 

*Matt Elam (S)

The Lions need a few guys capable of playing the safety position at a professional level. Elam was a top prospect coming out of high school, and killed it playing for the Gators. If Delmas stays healthy the Lions could turn a position that was a liability into a major strength. 

[Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ue7wlWAhgg)

*Andre Ellington (RB) 

This guy brings speed and pass catching ability and plenty of numbers playing in the explosive Clemson offense. He could be a great threat out of the backfield for the Lions, and replace Logan returning the ball on special teams.

It's nice to see that the play calling has changed for once. There's small glimpses, but at least it's changing. 

I can't see Megatron's routes, but I'm guessing they're using him as a decoy. Hopefully sending him deep. Now they just need to send him to the middle and/or perhaps have someone there to pick off a defender. 

Hopefully Stafford can now get into a rhythm and the defense tightens up. It's clear we're stopping them some what, just need to stop giving up that 1 big play.

1: Win at home against Min and one of the next two games. Lose one of the next two games and lose at GB.

Final record: 9-7

Division record: 3-3
Conference record: 6-6

2: Win at home against Min and both of the following games. Lose at GB.

Final record: 10-6

Division record: 3-3

Conference record: 6-6

(It’s certainly possible that we could beat GB, especially if they already have one loss but have clinched home field through playoffs, but I’m not betting on it.)

Let’s explore our competition.

I’ll start with our division opponents, Chicago.

Thanks to their current situation on offense we may not have to fear them, but here’s some hypotheticals.

Their schedule is easy enough that they could win as many as three games. If they end up going 10-6, the only way we would get in the playoffs over them is to win all four of our remaining games. I think it’s more realistic, given their situation, that they will only win one or two more.

If they win their next two games, but lose to Min in the final week, we would have (assuming we beat Min) the most relevant tiebreaker over them.

What I think is more likely though is for them to lose the next three weeks, suffering from the losses of Cutler and Forte and Martz’s ineffectiveness at adapting. They could still likely beat Min though and finish 8-8, effectively removing them from the playoff conversation.

Where things get tricky is if they lose to Denver, which is a common game win for us, but win at home against Seattle and in Minnesota. In that case, they would still hold a tiebreaker on conference wins and we would have to go 10-6 to beat them out. This is unfortunately likely.

Next up is Atlanta.

Obviously, they hold a head-to-head tiebreaker, so we are hoping for them to struggle in their three remaining division games.
The toughest two games for them will probably be at Carolina and at New Orleans. They get a bit of a freebie at home against Jacksonville, but even though they have struggled this season, Tampa Bay beat Atlanta once already and will certainly be looking to play spoiler in the final game of the season.

It is likely however that they will finish at either 9-7 or 10-6. If they finish 9-7, we need to finish 10-6 to be seeded higher and if they finish 10-6, we would need to win the rest of our games.

It is unlikely at this point that the Falcons won’t make the playoffs, but if we would finish at 10-6 and they at 9-7, they would lose a head-to-head tiebreaker against the Bears, were they also to finish 9-7.
Finally, the NFC East.

It’s obviously a race between the Giants and Cowboys at this point. They have two remaining games against each other and we are actually rooting for the Cowboys to win both of them. It would essentially eliminate the Giants from the wildcard race.

That said, the relevant tiebreaker between us and the Giants were we to be tied would be conference record and we currently have a two game lead with a likelihood to improve that with a win this week.
Lastly, we hold the obvious tiebreaker against the Cowboys as we beat the early in the year.

The most likely path to the playoffs I foresee for us is a continued collapse by Chicago and a sixth seed berth due to losing the tiebreaker to Atlanta.

Unfortunately for us, that likely means we head to New Orleans for the first round of the playoffs. We played well there though and a change in behavior as well as Suh back, maybe we have a chance. "	t5_2rynx	True

---

**Week 1 Vs. Minnesota:**

I love this matchup to start things off and get back on the right track. With our team healthy, I think we match up well against the Vikings on both offense and defense. On offense they can’t stop Johnson and Bush will have a good shot to dominate in the short pass game against a less than stellar LB corps. On defense, our secondary will be healthy and should be able to almost entirely shut down their pass game. Peterson will have to do it on his own. As a last note, our special teams failures were a huge factor in both games last year, but with a new coordinator and no Logan that should at least be partially improved.

---

**Week 2 @ Arizona:**

Another matchup I’m excited for. A chance to show that the worst game of our season last year was a fluke. The Cardinals might actually have a decent passing attack and Palmer will have better weapons at WR in Fitz, Roberts, and Floyd than he had the last few years. That said, our secondary will probably still be healthy and Houston, Delmas, and Quin will be tough to move too much on and their O-Line will be exploited by Suh and Fairley. Their defense is tough, but not phenomenal. They don’t have anyone who can matchup with Johnson and are lacking in pass rush so I expect he’ll have a big day with a few deep catches.

---

**Week 3 @ Washington:**

Better to face the Redskins earlier rather than later right now. RG3 may not be back yet and even if he is, I think he’ll be in a transition period and won’t be much of a threat to scramble. In either case, without that running threat, their lack of high end talent at WR will be exposed to our secondary. Their secondary was weak last year and they don’t have an elite pass rush. That spells a big game for Stafford to spread the ball around.

---

**Week 4 Vs. Chicago:**

The Bears are one of the toughest teams to predict this year. I was pretty harsh on them in my power rankings because so much is changing between the coaching staff and with Urlacher gone permanently. It’s also worth noting that they have several starters on defense above 30 and could easily face a slew of injuries as a result. On offense they added a decent TE, but their O-line is still very weak. The only reason Bushrod looked good at times as an LT was Brees’s quick release, which Cutler and the Bears offense lacks. I expect to see a few sacks, even if the Bears work on the short pass. However... If the coaching transition goes well, they could see some improvements on both sides of the ball and be a very tough team to contend with.

---

**Week 5 @ Green Bay:**

I’d like nothing more than to end our losing streak at Lambeau. I don’t see it happening. The Packers went 11-5 in an “off” year. They’ll be returning all of their key players from that team and are traditionally excellent at adding through the draft and developing players. It is likely to turn into a shootout, but unfortunately for us, they just don’t produce as many turnovers as we do. There’s always a chance though. Maybe Rodgers will get the flu right before the game. Oh, and they’ll be coming off a bye.

---

**Week 6 @ Cleveland:**

Our last of 4 road games in the first 6 weeks. Fortunately, it’s against one of the weaker teams on our schedule. The Browns shouldn’t be underestimated, especially on defense, but on offense they are like a weaker version of the Vikings. If we can score a couple TDs that’s probably all we’ll need. It’s likely to be a good game for Burleson and Broyles, as they lack CB depth past Haden. 

---

**Week 7 Vs. Cincinnati:**

I also think the Bengals are a tough team to predict. Their offense doesn’t have much bite beyond Green, but he could easily emerge as the 2nd best WR in the league this year. They’ve also got a decent line in terms of pushing for tough yards, but they’re still a team that’s likely to go 3-and-out more often than not. Their defensive line is very frightening, but beyond that their defense isn’t stellar anymore. Linebacker and safety are both weak positions for them so we could have success in both the short and deep pass game, although we’ll likely have to get rid of the ball fast.

---

**Week 8 Vs. Dallas:**

This is likely to be one of the most exciting games we play this season. Two teams with great passing attacks. With Witten, Bryant, Austin, and Murray, I think their offense is probably more well rounded than ours, but I also think our defense has a better secondary and will have a great matchup against their weak interior O-line. There will likely be an extensive highlight reel from this game, hopefully they’re mostly ours. Hopefully Durant doesn’t have a game against us the way Palmer did against the Cowboys last time.

---

**Week 9 Bye:**

Not sure you can get a better bye week and for us it’s particularly valuable to get our guys healthy going into weeks 10 and 11.

---

**Week 10 @ Chicago:**

This is probably the best game of the season to have after a bye. The Bears coaching staff will have had enough time to get things evened out by now, but it wouldn’t be surprising for injuries to have started piling up. They’ll also be coming off a game against the Packers which is a good time to get them.

---

**Week 11 @ Pittsburgh:**

Even though the Steelers don’t scare me as much as they used to, this is still likely to be rough because we’re on the road for the 2nd week in a row and coming off a division game. Their offense is likely to be pathetic. Wallace may be overrated, but he gave them an explosive element they now lack. In the run game, Dwyer is the best they’ve got and he’s not great. Their defense is good, not great right now, and isn’t likely to get better as the year goes on with 5 starters over 30, some of whom struggle with injuries already. I would not be horribly surprised to see the Steelers end up at the bottom of the AFC North this year, but realize that that is a pretty bold prediction.

---

**Week 12 Vs. Tampa Bay:**

It’s a good thing we get this game at home, because the Bucs scare the crap out of me. They added probowlers at both safety and corner back, which means they won’t be easy to pass against. It will be fascinating to see Calvin go up against Revis for 2nd time in his career. Last time he was held to 1 catch for 13 yards, but that was 2010 and he’s gotten better since and so has Stafford. Pass rush probably won’t be too big of a concern with Bennett gone, but we’re not going to be able to get much going in the run game against that D-line. On offense, they’ve got weapons to do some serious damage. We’ll see if Freeman is developing.

---

**Week 13 Vs. Green Bay:**

Still a ridiculously tough game. Not much different from the last one, but injuries for both times will likely play a bigger role in it’s outcome.

---

**Week 14 @ Philadelphia:**

I would have rather seen the Eagles early in the season, as there are massive changes going on all over. It’s tough to guess how well they will mesh, but I do like Kelly and 14 weeks into the season he may have gotten them operating at a high level. The only thing I can say with some confidence is that they are likely to be lacking at QB. They’ve had struggles with injuries to Jackson and Maclin as well, so this late in the season that could be a major issue for them.

---

**Week 15 Vs. Baltimore:**

Probably the toughest game on our schedule other than the Packers games. They pretty well replaced their losses in FA, so I doubt at this point they’ll take a huge step back. The biggest thing for them is improving at WR, which they could easily do in the draft. Our best chance in this game is for Flacco to cough up an INT or 2 and for Johnson to dominate their secondary.

---

**Week 16 Vs. Giants:**

A good game to have at home, that’s for sure, but the Giants don’t scare me so bad right now. They lost fantastic players at safety and tight end, as well as depth all over the field. They are weak at WR beyond Nicks and Cruz, their LBs are less than inspiring, their secondary may be lacking this year too. They can put up a bunch of points but will likely give up a ton too.

---

**Week 17 @ Minnesota:**

I love the bookends on the season with Minnesota. It wraps the regular seasons story up perfectly. Hard to tell where both teams will be by this point. It could end up being a game with playoff implications for either or both teams, or it could be just for pride. Either way though, it should be a great game.

---

Ultimately, I kind of like this schedule, both from an entertainment standpoint and from a potential to get wins. The NFC East is relatively weak right now and could easily finish as the worst NFC division again. The AFC North is definitely tough but since I see the Steelers struggling again this year, and the Bengals being only kind of playoff worthy, it's not as flat out intimidating as it would have been the last few years. I think we can feel like we at least have a chance, which is better than nothing."	t5_2rynx	True

&gt;6th Seed - Detroit
Wins tie break over New Orleans and Seattle based on strength of victory. Division tie break was initially used to eliminate Tampa Bay (New Orleans wins tie break over Tampa Bay based on head-to-head win percentage).

Okay, so obviously this relies on some ""upsets"" and MIN shitting their pants the rest of the season, which really isn't that farfetched except for the game I had STL beating them. It requires some teams to win certain weeks and lose other weeks. But it's possible. Obviously we can play around a little more if we go 8-8 or 9-7. Other than a couple of games though, I don't think this scenario is completely ridiculous. Maybe PHI getting to 6-10, or the entire NFC east besides NYG being 6-10 is a little ridiculous. 

Do I expect this to happen? No. But it's not out of the question anyways. The tough win will be vs CHI, but we could still get in with losses @ GB and vs ATL, with a little magic.

Anyway, I didn't really see much from Kevin Smith this game. However, outside of his one run into our own o-linemen, Keiland Williams impressed me a lot. I thought Young also showed why he's an up and coming WR. Broyles also looked pretty good, but there wasn't much his way.

I haven't heard anything about Logan yet, but I don't think it wasn't anything serious. 

Kellen Moore, IMO, looked way better this game. Not many deep balls, if any, but his other throws were very good. The o-line by then just wasn't very good. 

Talking about the o-line... I thought they looked excellent! Rieff also looked great and is maybe why Williams had just a great day. 

Pettigrew also looked a lot better. I don't recall a dropped pass. That's his biggest problem from becoming elite. He's already top 10, but he could break into top 5 this year.

From what I remember, Ronnell Lewis also looked decent.

Our special teams however, outside punting, was atrocious. I really hope it was because the starters weren't on the returns. "	t5_2rynx	True

Before I continue, no, this is not some crappy ""I'm gonna simulate every game in accordance to our regular season schedule and act like Madden is the magic conch shell of prediction."" thing. 

We, as Lions fans, have been able to watch a master of the off-season, Martin Mayhew, do his thing for the past few years. To see our team improve so much from drafting, I think Lions fans have become increasingly educated on all off-season topics and team management.

With this being said, I was wondering if there are people from this subreddit who would be interested in the following things involving Madden 13. 

* A simulated play-through of the 2013 season to start.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on re-signing decisions .
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on staff signing.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on rookie scouting.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on drafting.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on free-agency.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on depth-charting.
* Discussion posts and poll-style voting on roster cuts.
* Lather, rinse, repeat.

I won't be recording any video. I would be posting team information in the form of text, professionally formatted as possible. I may use something like Excel for this, rather then inserting text directly into a self post. 

I think it would be really fun for everyone on this sub-reddit to test and see how well were are at managing a team, even if we're throwing the entire season at what is essentially a dice-roll during simulation.

How often I would start a discussion post or a voting poll would depend on what you guys want. I think it would be great if we could do a season in 6 days (Aug. 29-Sept. 04) As to not flood this subreddit with posts unrelated to the regular season which would start. Then, when the regular season starts on Sept. 5, I'd probably make a separate subreddit that way virtual Lions news doesn't water down a subreddit about real Lions news. 

Would anybody be interested in this?

With both teams facing significant injuries (defense for us, offense for them), who wins out?

If McFadden is back, will it make a difference?

Will Cliff and Alphonso further increase their stock?

How much impact will having Suh back make?

Edit: Was just looking up some stats, thought you guys should be aware. As far as I can tell, we are 3rd in the NFL in takeaways at 29 (that's about 2 per game) behind GB (32) and SF (31). Tied 2nd in ints and 2nd in fumble recoveries. We are FIRST in defensive touchdowns, at 6, as well after our two this last weekend. This is what a solid pass rush can do, and with Suh back in the rotation this week it wouldn't be surprising if we came up with at least two more turnovers.

1363483556.0	1afvh7	How restructuring a contract works	honolulublues	18	0	6	"So I've seen a lot of posts suggest that some people don't really know how restructuring of contracts work so I will attempt to clear it up a bit (at least from my limited understanding). 

Ndamukong Suh, for example, was due roughly 11 mil in base salary this year. By restructuring the Lions can take his salary as low as the minimum (under 1M dollars) and pay the difference up front as a bonus. This will then spread that bonus as an equal cap hit over the remaining years of his contract including this year. So instead of a cap hit of 11Mish your looking somewhere in the 3Ms this year, freeing up 7-8M.

So while it seems like some magic wand that the Lions waved to get a bunch of free agents when they really did not have a whole lot of cap space to begin with, you're really just putting it all on a credit card with intentions of paying it later. Is this a good way of managing the team finances? Probably not. But Mayhew/Lewand/Schwartz are worried about their jobs after this year, not in five. Here is an article on salary cap if I didn't do a good job of explaining: http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-contract-restructuring-takes-advantage-of-loophole-2013-2

This will probably be a little lengthy and may not flow well. Please bear with me. I'm just going to write what's coming to me. Please feel free to correct me or partake in the discussion. 

Let me start by saying how disappointed I am with this year's Detroit Lions. The potential for this roster is huge yet they seem to find a way to remain ""the same ole' Lions"". So, in my opinion, what is wrong and how do they, as an organization, make it right?

-COACHING: I'll admit from the start, i'm not much of an ""X's and O's"" guy however, I do understand the game of football rather well. I've heard a lot of people lately calling for the firing of Schwartz, Linehan, or even the whole coaching staff. On these points, there is one that I can partially agree with: Linehan. Linehan's playcalling is as predictable as can be. We all know this but he doesn't have a lot to work with. Yes, we have an explosive offense through the air but the problem is, everyone knows that. Even with the threat of Calvin Johnson and Co., we still can't seem to consistently have a running threat. Burleson said it best after last year's Cowboys game...""they say we're a one trick pony (referring to megatron)...well, that's one hell of a pony."" Sure, there are times when we're all scratching our heads or facepalming at a playcall, but Linehan has done a pretty good job with what he's had to work with. 

Now, onto Schwartz. I have such mixed feelings on the guy. The Lions NEEDED the tenacity and attitude he brought when he signed on as HC. It worked. He reminds me a lot of Suh in regards to how I feel about him. I love that he's passionate, fiesty, and has an attitude but he needs to be able to keep himself in check. Has Schwartz lost his cool? Yup. Has he made mistakes? Absolutely. However, I think, overall, the guy has done a good job and has earned at least one more year to show whether the real Lions are last years Lions or this years Lions. 

Firing the coaching staff will set this team back into rebuilding mode. I truly believe they just need some ""tweaking"" in a few areas. 

-MAHEW: I think he started out very strong as a GM but has certainly made some bad decisions. I don't need to go into detail about past draft picks, we've all discussed that extensively. I'd like to try and focus the discussion around this off-season and upcoming draft. 

Let me just say this, I would not envy being Mahew right now. He has a lot of difficult decisions to make in the near future. The secondary absolutely has to be addressed this year. This will be the litmus test for him. Make or break. Not only does he have to deal with the off-season and upcoming draft, he has to try and figure out how to make it viable, financially, to keep 3 stars from the previous CBA. Yes, megatron has a new contract but I don't see how we are able to keep both Stafford and Suh without the rest of the team suffering. Obviously, based on my flair, i'm a Stafford supporter and don't want him going anywhere. Speaking of Suh..."	t5_2rynx	True

--------------------

My thoughts:

**Round 1:** Good pick and fine by me. I liked Janoris Jenkins and thought he was worth it, but an Iowa OL is a good pick for us and fills a big need.

**Round 2:** Very odd and a huge shocker. Had to think about this one for a second to see why he was picked. In short, I have to believe he was selected for mainly his return abilities. He has to be a Nate Burleson replacement/improvement. Really they are/were the same player. In terms of team needs, he fills the kick/punt return and #4 WR slot and/or #3 WR slot in 2014. Okay, fine, but I don't really get the point of it. In terms of needs and the impact of the needs filled, I just don't get it. Janoris Jenkins fell to #7 in the 2nd round. There were two scenarios we should have done. 1) Take Reiff #1, then trade up to take Jenkins in the 2nd or 2) Take Jenkins #1 and then address the o-line in the 2nd round with either Peter Konz or Mike Adams. Broyles is a good WR there's no doubt there, but he wasn't the BPA by a stretch. From what I've read, the Lions were never taking Jenkins no matter where he fell, which is ignorant. His off the field incidents were nothing serious that couldn't be out grown. A very minor bar fight that someone else started by trying to steal his chain, and smoking weed. Chances are if he was in a different state, he would not have been kicked out of school, but Florida is one of, if not the worst state in terms of laws and weed. Any risk IMO was gone once he fell past the 1st round. Instead of addressing our mediocre/bad secondary and return game, we only address our return game.

**Round 3:** Excellent pick. Addresses our secondary problem and got a good value with the pick. Could have been a second round pick easily. 

**Round 4:** Odd player for this defense, but another excellent value pick. HEAVY hitter and a great special teams player. Addresses one, possibly two needs: OLB and special teams. There's talk about him playing DE, but who knows.

**Round 5.1:** Want the secondary fixed? Well, here we go doing it. Greenwood is ANOTHER excellent value pick. 6'1 193lbs and runs a 4.42. Amazing stats for a CB, especially in today's league. Your average CB is under 6 ft and Greenwood is 6'1, nearly 200lbs and can run a 4.4. Can be our sleeper pick of the entire draft. Did I mention he's a local player out of Detroit?

**Round 5.2:** This... This is the worst pick in the entire NFL draft this year. He won't be a OLB on this team. He will be on special teams if he even makes the team. We gave up a 4th round next year for him. He was projected to go in the seventh round or be undrafted. Horrible pick. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

**Round 6:** Very odd pick... Can't say much but that he runs a straight 4.4 and is 5'11. Was projected to go undrafted. I can only assume the front office has been watching him and liked him a lot.

**Round 7:** First off, great steal this late in the draft, however why not draft Kellen Moore for our #3 QB? There's the Titus Young connection and everything. He could have developed into a nice trade prospect later on and would be great insurance if Stafford was forced to retire or move on due to injuries. T. Lewis probably has a decently sized ceiling, but will he return to what he was early in his Oklahoma career? It's nice there's that Oklahoma LB connection, but how much is that worth? Would have preferred to have just taken him instead of Whitehead and then Moore with this pick or even RB Chris Polk.

Walterfootball.com grading:

23. Riley Reiff, OT, Iowa: A+ Grade
History repeats itself. Two years ago, Iowa tackle Bryan Bulaga was a top-10 prospect who dropped to the 20s. That pick worked out really well, and I'll be shocked if the Lions don't have similar success with Riley Reiff. Detroit really needed a tackle to protect Matthew Stafford, and Reiff was the best player on the board. Great move.

54. Ryan Broyles, WR, Oklahoma: B Grade
Hmm... maybe the Vikings should have drafted Morris Claiborne after all. This is crazy. If Ryan Broyles pans out, how are teams going to stop their offense? Broyles, if healthy, should be a good player for Matthew Stafford, who will need someone to throw to once Calvin Johnson suffers from the Madden Curse. I have to wonder though, why not improve the defense? I feel like there were better prospects available, but I don't have a problem with this selection.

85. Dwight Bentley, CB, Louisiana-Lafayette: A Grade
The Lions do what they do most of the time - they select the best player available. Dwight Bentley could have possibly been selected at the very end of Round 2, so Detroit is getting really good value with him. He obviously fills a need as well; it's been well-documented how anemic the Lions' secondary is.

125. Ronnell Lewis, OLB, Oklahoma: A+ Grade
I'm not sure how the hell Ronnell Lewis fell into Round 4 (let alone Round 3). The Bills are getting a major steal. They don't need a linebacker in terms of a starter, but Lewis is way too good to pass up at this juncture.

138. Tahir Whitehead, DE/OLB, Temple: D Grade
I thought the Lions took the best player available? Tahir Whitehead was a seventh-round prospect. I also don't see how he fits into Detroit's defense. He should have been drafted by a team to be a 3-4 rush linebacker.

148. Chris Greenwood, CB, Albion: B Grade
No surprise that the Lions selected a second cornerback. They really needed help at the position. Chris Greenwood has good upside and fits the range in the middle of Round 5.

196. Jonte Green, CB, New Mexico State: C Grade
Detroit really wants to fix the cornerback position. I don't think many people had Jonte Green as a draftable prospect, however.

223. Travis Lewis, OLB, Oklahoma: A+ Grade
Another Oklahoma linebacker. Another steal. Another A+. This new Lions regime knows how to draft. The only question is, why didn't they fire Matt Millen sooner?

A good kicker if he is in form, the worst in the NFL if he isn't (which is more likely, especially considering the NFCCG against the Falcons where he missed a 37 yarder, inside a dome, when he was directly in front of the goal, if the Falcons didn't choke he would have been stabbed probably). Rugland on the other hand, doesn't have any experience, but I remember reading a few months ago Schwartz saying that he thrived under any challenge they gave to him. I believe at least giving him a legitimate shot can give you a chance at the next Janikowski, maybe more. The influx of European players changed the NBA forever (starting with the greatest European player of all time, Drazen Petrovic to the likes of Gasol, Parker and Jerebko just for you Pistons fans out there), so I'm asking you Lions fans, is there any chance Rugland gets to become the starter in front of Akers?  	t5_2rynx	True

1357076139.0	15sdu4	Firing Schwartz is not the right move...	FriedDuck	19	2	13	"Guys, my fellow Lions fans, none of us want a losing season and none of us were impressed with the team we saw this year. This being said, we cannot forget where we came from (0-16), the pieces we have in place, and the incredible level of play we know can perform on. We can't let the frustration of a bad season lead us to rash conclusions. What would firing Schwartz really accomplish? He took us to the playoffs a year before this for the first time in over a decade and is responsible for almost every solid and productive aspect of the Lions. He struggled this year because of the lack of depth and his failure to adjust concerning injuries and discipline problems that consumed the Lions.

However, is starting from scratch really going to get us a winning season next year? With good draft and a healthy team, we will go to playoffs again under Shwartz, not if we completely restart[1] our schemes and management. I'm no huge fan of Mayhew, but I honestly believe Schwartz is the right guy for the job. Do not forget how close almost every single loss was with great teams (bears, packers, the texans - we won that game); we lost 12 games, yes, but 10 of them were within a single possession and many of those came down to a single play even with a defensive secondary torn to shreds with injury and 4th+ string wide receives next Johnson. And how many wins in the 2011 season were within a single possession or play? The difference between those 1 possession/play games in the 10-6 and 4-12 seasons wasn't a vast difference in talent or skill or scheme or coaching, but a difference in lack of depth and adjusting concerning injuries and discipline in all phases of the ball. The record speaks a nasty story of the Lions and like Schwartz said, that is all that will be seen by the world. But let us, true Lions fans, not be rash. We must see the true value this team has if it works out the kinks. Changes are needed in personnel, but I see us in the playoffs next year with this coach, not if we cave into the hysteria and call for Shwartz's head. Let's go 2013 and GO LIONS!"	t5_2rynx	True

We’ve been close in almost every game, yet we have a losing record and deserve a losing record. And with season nearly lost beyond redemption comes the inevitable chorus of cynicism. Demands for trades, cuts and firings are nothing new and neither are the claims that the Lions are forever doomed. However, unless you believe the Lions are genuinely cursed, there is reason yet to be optimistic.

Consider the talent we have on this team. We have a 24 year old quarterback who is already on pace to shatter the franchise record for passing yards, TDs, and completions. We have a 27 year old receiver who will likely own the franchise records for receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs, and who already owns the franchise records for receptions per game and receiving yards per game. We have one of the most feared defensive lines in football and have drafted loads of other young, talented players with lots of upside. We have not had this much talent or potential in a long time if we ever have at all. 

However, it would be foolish to expect such talent to immediately result in consistent success. Young players need to progress, team chemistry needs to develop, the bad apples need to be weeded out and clearly, there are still some holes to be filled. Mayhew and company know how to make that happen.

Take the Saints for example. In 2006, New Orleans signed Drew Brees as well as Scott Fujita and drafted Reggie Bush, Roman Harper and Marques Colston. That year, the Saints finished 10-6 and made it to the NFC championship game. Over the next two years, they continued to build their team adding the talents of Jeremy Shockey, Tracy Porter, Sedrick Ellis and Jonathan Vilma. Nevertheless, the Saints took a step back and went 7-9 in 2007 and 8-8 in 2008. Their patience and finally paid off in 2009 when the Saints went 13-3 and won the Super Bowl.

Or consider the Patriots. Before winning the Super Bowl in 2001, the Pats went 8-8 in '99 and 5-11 in '00. Or how about the Ravens? Whilst building the franchise, the Ravens endured three losing seasons and one .500 season before winning the Super Bowl in 2000.

Of course, each situation is unique and young talent is no guarantee of success, but there are a lot of good reasons to be optimistic about this Lions team. It’s going to take continued additions and subtractions to the roster and it’s going to take time. But unless you believe the Mayans, we still have plenty of time."	t5_2rynx	True

1351039260.0	11z8s2	"Oh, surprise surprise. ""Stefan Logan will continue to be Lions' return man, Jim Schwartz says"""	JustHere4TheDownVote	21	6	20	"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121023/SPORTS0101/210230451/1004/sports/Stefan-Logan-will-continue-to-be-Lions--return-man--Jim-Schwartz-says

This is the difference between our staff and the staff of a competent organization.  

Logan is not Valverde (Tigers' reference). He has no history of actually doing well as a return man. He does have a history of fumbles.

What other teams would keep him on returns? SO many other teams would have replaced him by now. This just continues to prove my idea of how stubborn this staff is. They refuse to adapt to the current situation and just grind it out for no reason. It's show on and off the field. 

I'm so fucking raged right now I can't stand it. Not only does our defensive special teams blow, but our returner has just as much chance of giving the other team a TD or the ball back in great fielding. 

I just don't get it. At all. You have Edwards and Broyles. Both AMAZING returners in college. Yet, neither are used. Hell, even Bell could return probably. 

As far as I'm concered the season is over with. I doubt we beat Seattle. They have an amazing defense and Lynch is going to put up 80 yards. The only way we win is shutting down Wilson, which could happen. Then we play JAX. That's a win. So 4-4 at best. Then Vikings. 4-5, GB, 4-6, Texans, 4-7, Colts, 5-7, GB, 5-8, Cards, 5-9, ATL, 5-10, Chicago, 5-11. The best I see us doing is 6-11. Which is fucking horrible. 

The talent being wasted is just depressing. The fact our schedule is harder this year is just magnifying the issue with the play calling and coaching staff. It's that simple. It doesn't matter if we have turnovers. This team is built to strike back and match teams. The defense is made to shut down teams. The defense is actually improved this year and Linehan is just giving games away, over and over. Not to mention Schwartz can't control his players. For whatever reason, the receivers are not learning they're plays. Now either Schwartz or Linehan is to blame. If they can't learn them, make them simpler. This isn't the Patriots. We don't need complex plays because we lack talent.  The only thing keeping this team from dropping to a top 10 draft pick is this defense and considering how glassy the secondary is, I doubt it'll last all season. 

Excuse the rant, but unless something changes this or next season, we're back to rebuilding and won't be winning for years to come. Plain and simple. Players will start to leave. Suh probably will. Why would he want to stay with incompetent coaching?

Can't wait for my only highlights of Lion football to be looking forward to the draft and how high we can get. "	t5_2rynx	True

ReaganSmashK	18	0	10	"There's many reasons why I'm not a Saints fan, and was even rooting against them in their super bowl run. 

For starters, I hate the natural sympathy that their players are given for playing in a city that was devastated by Katrina. The players, themselves, were mostly unaffected. They live lives of luxury and were, like I said, for the most part, unaffected because of their quality of living. The players had to overcome nothing because of Katrina. 

Second reason, the way their team is built. Horrific defense that gets way too much credit. They're also a team that hasn't really been ""built"" as much as they've been ""bought"". What many consider to be the top 3 players on Detroit, Calvin, Matt, and Suh, were all drafted. The top 3 players in New Orleans, Brees, Nicks, and Evans. Brees was acquired, Nicks has been given away, only Evans is a true breed Saint.

Third reason is their attitude. Saints fans say they can act the way they act because of their history of being bottom feeders. This is ridiculous. There have been many good seasons for the Saints in which they fell just a touchdown or two short of a superbowl run. 

Fourth reason is their stadium. Jesus Christ, not even Hitler put up that much ""YAY US"" stuff in his home. Use some space to respect your past legends, Saints, it's not all about your plain logo.

Fifth reason is their unbelievably ignorant and infuriating response to the clear evidence of a pay-for-performance and bounty system. 

With that being said, that's why I want the Saints to actually do decent enough this year to be a wild-card team, so we can take them down a peg.

A lot happened this week that changed our playoff situation. If you think any of what I say here is wrong, please let me know.

First of all, it looks as though we will have a very difficult time stealing the #5 seed from the Falcons. As long as they keep pace with us in wins, they go in ahead of us, and although they face the Saints in New Orleans next week, they get Tampa Bay at home the following. It would be surprising for them not to get at least one win and that, I predict, is the number we will also get.

It gets a little brighter after that.

Thanks to a Giants loss, it is now impossible for the NFC East to send a wildcard team. If the Giants win both of their upcoming games, they will win the division and the best the Cowboys could finish at would be 9-7, and the Lions hold the tiebreaker there. There are several other possible scenarios surrounding who finishes where in the NFC East, but it is irrelevant in terms of the wild card.

Seattle and Arizona both won, which means, they are both desperately hoping we lose two more games, because if we win one more there is no way they can catch us in wins. Of course if we don't get another win, we still may be alright. Since they meet in week 17 it is only possible for one of those teams to get to 9 wins. The Seahawks face 49ers next week and the Cards have to play the Bengals in Cin City. Let's just say, I'm not picking either of them to win, but even if one of them does, the other has a good shot to win the week 17 meeting and play spoiler. Of course, all of this is entirely moot if we manage to get one more win.

Chicago... Poor Chicago... Their last two games are away games within the division, and they'd need to win both to have a chance to beat us out now. I'd say the chances of that are nigh on impossible, as even the Vikings should give them a run for their money at this point.

Basically, what it comes down to is we will clinch a playoff berth automatically if we win either of our remaining games. Even if we don't though, there is a good chance we will make it.

What follows is purely conjecture.

What happened at Arrowhead today could not have been better for us. 

First of all, it showed that the Packers are not invincible, which was a very important lesson for everyone to see. 

It's safe to assume that the Packers main goal at this point is to get the #1 seed. I'm not positive about this, but I'm pretty sure that either a loss by the 49ers tomorrow (or one of the next two weeks) or a win next week for the Packers will secure it for them. I realize that the Chiefs just beat them this week, but I have serious doubts that the mangled Bears can go into Lambeau and get a win.

That leads me to our meeting with them in week 17. The Packers will likely be sitting at 14-1, having clinched the #1 seed, with a lack of motivation to play with the same physicality they usually do. If there was anything on the line for them I think they'd play their starters all game, but they learned a tough lesson by losing Jennings last week and may chose to sit some of their players for insurance. The Lions on the other hand, if they lose next week, will be giving it every ounce of effort they've got to secure the wildcard. It's not a game a favor the Lions in under most circumstances, but we may see an exception.

From what I've seen, at times, the Lions seem to use Scheffler as a sort of 'hybrid' if you will, playing TE and also splitting out to the slot. Does this happen often? Is it successful?

If I've offended or embarrassed you, that was not my intention. I would like to hijack this thread to have a discussion about posting etiquette and content of /r/detroitlions. I know we don't have a FAQ or posting rules as this is a rather small community of avid fans, so I'd like to throw some ideas out there. One rule I like in the smaller subreddits I subscribe to is the limit of two post per day. This way, the front paged doesn't get over run by one users posts. Another thing to keep in mind while posting is quality over quantity. For instance, Friday injury reports typically have little to no new information, but if someone is on there by surprise, make a link to an article about that player. Let me know what y'all think. Cheers and GO LIONS!  
Here's my original post, I'll leave it up as I live with no regrets ;)  

Seriously, the front page is riddled with Espn NFCN blog posts. Seifert occasionally writes some really good articles, but stuff like '*Final Word: NFC North*' and '*NFC North Friday injury report*' have very little substance and can easily be accessed by visiting his blog. I'm not saying post from blogs do not belong here because they are great ways to get news and spark conversation on /r/detroitlions. I'd rather see post from one of the Lions beat writers and insiders like Dave Birkett, Chris McCosky, or Tim Twentyman.

[what up with that???](http://cdn.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/whats-up-with-that.gif). Part of fixing this problem is benching Logan, only let Bell play when we're winning, make better play calls (but I'll get to that one). People obviously have the Logan muffed punts (yes he did it twice but one was lost), Bell's drop at the goal line, and Mikel's fumble in mind, but Pettigrew fumbled twice. Luckily the ball went out of bounds both times. Pettigrew has been notorious this year for dropping the ball - literally and figuratively. Give this guy a whipping Schwartz! 

I would rate missing tackles as our second biggest problem. As Terry Foster put it, we made Cutler look like *White* Denard Robinson. By the way, how many times did we crush the bears on 1st and 2nd down only to give up a huge 3rd down play? 

Now, the play calling. This is by far the most frustrating thing for me last night. I have been saying this since week 2, we do the same damn thing all game and it doesn't work. So why not just switch to a complete no-huddle offense as it works in the 4th quarter... Linehan you've lost it, they showed the same play you did against the Bears on MNF. I can point out times in this season where you completely went Marty Morningwood on us. I'm sure you all remember the epic come back by Shaun Hill and our clever 4th down play. Back to last night, Mikel is running people over out there, GIVE HIM THE BALL ON THIRD AND 1. I swear I was able to call some of the plays before they happened. 2nd and 10, up the middle every time, ok that didn't work and now it's 3rd and 10, lets pass short.

1339921146.0	v68gj	A deceptively good offseason so far. Sleep on us at your own risk.	sosuhme	16	2	7	"There has been so much pessimism surrounding the Lions since the season ended. I don't think it's warranted.

I'll start with the perceived issues.

First of all, we all know what everyone talks about with the Lions this offseason. Lack of discipline. And I don't think any of us were happy, either with the number/type of penalties the team had last year, or the offseason conduct of our 2011 draft class.

Also, our drafting was considered questionable by many. Taking a WR in the 2nd round when we had a pressing need at CB seemed very odd to some.

On top of that, Avril has yet to sign his franchise tender and Best, LeShoure, Tulloch, Spievey, and others have been dealing with injuries.

From a casual perspective, I can see the reason for doubt. As someone, however, who is paying a lot of attention, I feel that most of the doubt surrounding the team is largely misplaced.

Let's talk about discipline. 

First, the 2011 draft class issues. By all accounts Young has rebounded from his incident with Delmas amazingly well. He publicly apologized and even Delmas said they were closer now than they ever were before. Reports indicate he has been lighting up in OTAs and minicamp since he was allowed back into team facilities.

Fairley has also publicly apologized. He sounded sincere and from a statement Cunningham made it sounded as though he got plenty of discipline from inside the organization. What got lost in all this is that he was a monster in the weight room this offseason and has been also performing very well at practices. He will likely face a suspension of at least 2 games, although probably more in the 3-5 range, but I see that as the kind of thing that will spur him on to perform at an even higher level when he gets back on the field.

LeShoure really impressed me with his public statement, making it clear he understood the cost of his actions, especially in regards to the team. Then he hit mini-camp. At 233lbs and finally allowed to participate in contact drills, he was apparently running and making breaks without hesitation. It seems he is either completely healed, or nearly there. He faces a two game suspension, but at least one of those games we should be able to win without his help. The San Fran game is going to be tough either way and it's too bad he won't be there, but Smith should be able to carry the load early in the season.

Who cares about Culbreathe? Sorry to be crass but I'd be surprised if he makes the roster.

Now in terms of discipline as a team, most of my concerns have already been at least partially addressed. For starters, after things blew up last year, Schwartz was able to get things reigned in a bit by the end of the year. The number of penalties stayed higher than we want, but personal fouls dropped off entirely(I think). The team stopped acting like a bunch of morons on the field. It has been eluded to enough times to satisfy me that the team is addressing the issue whole heartedly, and I think the public statements by Schwartz, as well as the 2011 draft class players, have been some specific evidence of that. Everyone is being held accountable. I don't expect us to have a league low penalties in 2012, especially with the aggressive nature of our defense, but I do think we will be much closer to the middle of the pack.

I'm sure most of you know the good and bad parts about the draft, but here's my thoughts.

I too was curious when we took a WR with our second round pick. As things develop I have less and less concern about it though. Firstly, Broyles was clearly a 2nd round talent, save for the injury, but would like have have been taken shortly after the Lions took him anyway. As far as the injury is concerned, everything I've read seems to suggest he is ahead of schedule. Although he hasn't been active in any full contact practices yet, he has been participating in drills since the OTAs started. He should be ready by training camp to play. He'll have more practice likely than Young had before he played in the regular season last year. It looks at though Young will likely get used more in the return game, which will not limit him greatly in the offense, but enough I expect that Broyles will get a fair number of snaps as the #3 in 2012. In the long term, he is an ideal replacement for Burleson and I have no problem with the pick at all.

It's hard to figure out who will and won't work out among the rest of the draft class, but several of them made good impressions in the rookie minicamp and it's not unreasonable to think we will have new back ups on the roster at CB, DE, and LB.

Avril's slightly overblown sense of self worth doesn't bother me that much. He's motivated to stay fit and come out and dominate this year in hopes of getting a new contract from someone. The stupidest thing he could do to himself is holdout, so I don't expect that to be an issue at all. He's not vital, IMO, and while his presence adds to our overall DLine, his absence doesn't cause major chemistry issues for the group. Hopefully he signs a contract for a long time at a reasonable price, but if he doesn't, and he ends up elsewhere next year, I won't lose sleep over it, especially if we take a new DE in the early rounds next year like we should anyway.

Tullochs injury worries me much more, but I am hoping that the lack of much news on the topic is a good sign and that he'll be 100% by the time training camp rolls around. This is the one thing I am a bit apprehensive about right now.

The other significant players with injuries are seemingly making great progress. Best, LeShoure, and Spievey are all cleared for physical contact now, so I don't think there is too much cause for worry, aside from the ever present risk to reinjure, but that's nothing new. As a side note on Spievey, it seems clear that he has been made aware that this is his last chance to step up or move aside. I hope he steps up, but if he gets relegated to back and we put someone else in, it might be an upgrade anyway.

Actually, the whole issue of the secondary isn't bothering me that much. Depth is still an issue, but I don't think we lost any depth at CB as I think Berry is, or will be, at least as good as Wright was, maybe better, and if Lacey's late season performances last year were an indication of the direction of his level of play, he should be a great nickel CB. Safety depth is still the larger issue as Delmas's injury last year had a noticeable effect on the quality of secondary play. Coleman has been having a very good offseason, and would be a good backup for Spievey, but I don't know how well he could replace Delmas. Overall, I think the secondary will also benefit from the presence of Fairley once he returns from suspension. Even a slight improvement on our pass rush from the DL will help players like Spievey make big plays and raise their level of play.

Overall, it seems like almost all news coming out of OTAs and minicamp has been good. I think we have a good chance to continue our forward progress as a team. I expect us to win some tough games that we lost last year. With even a small improvement we could end up besting San Fran, Atlanta, and Green Bay at least once. Houston is tough, but I don't think they're that much better than us. I'm sure we will drop some games, but I don't expect to see the Lions out of any of their games this season and I do expect to see some dominant performances."	t5_2rynx	True

You guys put a hurt on us in week 5, and have been having a great year.  I think my Bears sorted some things out with their O-Line lately and won't make the same mistakes as before. 

Do me a favor though:  Knock the shit out of Green Bay when you play them in a couple of weeks."	t5_2rynx	True
