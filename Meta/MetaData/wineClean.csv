I have a new series coming online called Brown Bag Wine Tasting.  While I love a good glass of wine the rating numbers and high brow ""five dollar"" type words used to describe wine I think make the ordinary person afraid of talking about and enjoying the pleasures of wine. 

What I've done is take a bottle of wine wrapped in a brown bag so I don't know what it is or what it has been rated and go out to the person on the street and together we do some wine tasting and instead of talking about aroma, body, finish, etc... I have them describe the wine in the vernacular of their own occupations.

For example a butcher may describe a good wine's body as ""filet mignon"" or ""top round"" while a bad wine as ""rump roast"" or ""processed meat"".  

It's fun, it's not to be taken too seriously but I hope it takes the snobbery out of wine tasting and hopefully makes someone less afraid to talk about their love of wine.

I'd love to share the webisodes with you on this subreddit.  

May I?

1351570965.0	12blzz	Best wine/party game EVER: Wine War 	benjaminkahlemusic	108	13	30	"I learned about this amazing wine game years ago. My wife and I decided to call it ""wine war"" and have since had 6 wine wars at our home. Each being a big hit. Here's how it's played: 

First, decide if it's going to be red or white wine. You can only do one or the other. Then, invite over 6-12 friends/couples. Each person/couple brings 2 IDENTICAL bottles of red or white. Take 1 of the bottles and put it somewhere safe. Then, take the other bottle and wrap it up with a brown bag, foil, or something that completely conceals the body and label. Then label it by number. 

Once everyone is there and the bottles are labeled, pour each of your guests a small pour of each wine, one at a time. Each guest will judge the wines one at a time in 2 parts: Nose and mouth, by a point system. (We used numbers 1-5, 5 being highest) You'll need to provide a score sheet. We made our own. 

Depending on how many guests you have, it will take time to taste all the wines and people will begin to get a little tipsy, so it's a good idea to provide water, cheeses, fruits, charcuterie, bread, ect to help the buzz and palette. 

After all the wines have been tasted, the host will tally up the scores. The person/couple with the highest score keeps ALL of the unopened bottles. 

Best. Game. Ever. 

Some advice: You can play with the rules for your specific party. For example, we did a party where the $$ cap was $15.00 (one friend who knew nothing about wine brought Charles Shaw.... and it placed 5th out of 13). 

We had an all cabernet wine war, a ros√© wine war, and a riesling wine war. It's a good idea to buy a 1oz wine pourer. It keeps folks from getting too hammered. A VERY good rule is to outlaw screwtops. We had a situation where one of our guests cheated when he recognized his wine by the unconcealed screwtop, and voted himself up, winning by 2 points. In all fairness, he copped to it :) 

I hope this sounds like fun to my fellow wine lovers! If you think of any ideas to improve or improvise the game please post em!

Who are these ""experts"" exactly? If you are in the wine biz, how many experts do you know? So many people in the wine business consider themselves experts. Does tasting a lot of wine make you an expert? Does it make you a taster? No, well, not necessarily. Here is the trutth that the people who compose these studies should focus on: most ""wine experts"" do not know how to critically taste, dissect and evaluate a wine. There, I said it. Just because you taste 1000 wines a year doesn't mean shit if you do not know how to taste. And many professionals do not know how to do this. This is a HUGE problem in the wine industry but no one really talks about it. In fact, you would run a high risk of being called a snob for doing so. 

I would not consider myself a wine expert. One day I hope to know much much more than I currently know. I have been through thte entire WSET program, which teaches a very reliable and consistent method of tasting. I am currently in a program with a very intense focus on wine tasting. What do these programs teach that is so important? Taste what is in the glass. If you do this, your descriptors for the white wine with redfood coloring will puzzle you and you will wonder why this wine has tropical fruits but is red. You will not be able to figure out what red variety this is and will be stumped, but your notes will make it obvious one the asshole who put the food coloring in the wine shows you the bottle. 

Again, I am no expert taster but when asked to sit alongside sommeliers, journalists and distributor and supplier professionals at a major market rodeo wine judging, I had a strong feelings that we were judging the under $12 category wines. We were told the variety but nothing about price, quality or region. Many of the wines tasted similar and they tasted cheap. The fruit was simple, the tannins rough, the wines lacked complexity and the oak was not integrated. While many around me felt the need to find wines that had to be of grater quality, I stuck to the system I learned. When we were allowed to go into a room and view all the flights, low and behold, we're were tasting the under $15 wines.

My point is not that I am a bad ass taster..I could not have told you exactly where all these wines were from (through an educated guess of California would have taken care of th majority) and I would have had a hard time telling thte difference between quite a few of the varieties at this price point had we not been told that ahead of time. Point is, tasters can differentiate quality levels. Of course, there are times when it is tough and there are many wines that are more expensive they you would probably guess in a blind tasting (ahem, Caymus SS for example) because they taste more like a $35 wine than it does a $135 wine.

And what did that ""bullshit"" article say about not being able to process or taste more that 4 or so tastes in a wine? Really? Plum, pepper, spice, vanilla, mineral, mint, cedar, eucalyptus. How many of you can find those relatively easily in a barossa Shiraz? Ok, I might be pushing it with the mineral in a typical barossa.

If you taste what is in the glass. You would know that there was something wrong with that Grand Cru bottle that was filled with VdP wine or you would say ""this is one helluva VdP, I will take 5 cases at that price."" you might not say ""hey, why the hell did you pour Latour into the VdP bottle?! What's wro with you?"" but you would know that something was definitely odd and exceptional.

Typing is this small box makes it difficult to gauge how much I have written and I feel I have possible gone on too long. Let me end on this...it is possible to objectively taste wine. It is possible to decide upon a quality level and price range by tasting the wine. Is also possible to deduce many things about how the wine was produced and the method used by tasting the wine. It is also possible to make, while not always correct, educated guesses about a wine's origin or a very plausible argument about the origin after tasting blind. I have seen many people do this and I am learning how to do it.

So, don't say wine tasting is bullshit. Instead, say many wine tasters are full of bullshit. Instead, insist that these expert tasters demonstrate that they know how to taste and can write notes that tell you something about the wine, not just try to come up with the most gushing, poetic crap at they can. Make the notes a bit more boring and scientific, in a sense. What kind of fruit? Just say that it is red or black and that it's ripe or unripe. This means more than listing exotic fruits and flavors. 

Is it just me or does anyone else feel this way?

We're getting rid of everything!so we don't have any idea where we are going or what we are doing when we come back. There has been talk of perhaps trying to hit australia or NZ for their harvest but we can't afford to get there.  
THE FUN PART: I'm not sure we will have enough money...but the plane tickets are already paid for.   
Last but not least I could potentially try to go to UC davis but we still have my wife's loans and I'm scared of talking out more loans.  
**Edit2** sorry if my responses have been short. I can only reddit from my phone right now.

The moral of the story is I think I'm jumping of the ledge and I hope something catches me.

1357497776.0	162kkr	Brunello di Montalcino	ChampagneFloozy	67	4	28	"So, [Brunello di Montalcino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunello_di_Montalcino) is a category of wine that I do not have a ton of experience with. For those that don't know, it's a wine that comes from the town of Montalcino is Tuscany, made from a special clone of Sangiovese, different from the ones used in Chianti, called Brunello (which is local dialect for ""the nice dark one"").  By law, the wines must be aged for longer than most other Italian wines - for four years, two in oak for regular BdM, or for five, with 2 1/2 in oak for the riserva. The region is small, a mere 3,000 acres compared to Chianti's 41,000 acres. As you can imagine and probably know, the wine can be cost-prohibitive.

I've tasted a handful of Brunellos at trade shows and in a work environment before, but I had never brought one home for immediate consumption (you might also be aware that it is a region known for requiring the patience of bottle age). 

I decided to splurge last night and broaden my horizons a bit. I was assured that the [2004 Tenuta Vitanza Brunello di Montalcino](http://i.imgur.com/SjLMC.jpg) ($70USD) was firmly in it's drinking window and thought I would give it a shot. Knowing it was a wine that demanded a hearty meal, I grilled up some ribeyes and served them with rosemary and garlic roasted potatoes and a salad of watercress, baby spinach, lemon, olive oil, and shaved pecorino toscana. (That salad, btw, is simply divine - give it a try sometime.) 

I opened the bottle while I was cooking and poured a little bit into my glass without decanting. Dark reddish with brown tints, opaque. Aromas seemed slightly earthy and very muted. I decanted most of the wine, poured out quite a good bit of sediment, and decanted the wine back into the bottle. It started showing some crushed red berries and leather and the same earthy notes. Still seemed somewhat muted, confirming what I expected to be a big, brooding sort of wine. When I prepped the salad, I tried a little bit of cheese with the wine. Thats when the wine stood up and said hello. The sweetness of red fruit jumped right out, and the wine softened dramatically.

We drank the bottle with the meal, and the experience with food was entirely different than the muted, brooding wine I had in the kitchen. The wine was lively and played nicely with everything on the plate, from the fatty steak to the earthy potatoes to the delicate, lemony watercress. This was not a brooding wine at all, it just needed the right company. With the meal, it was, above all, graceful and elegant. Based on my previous experiences tasting Brunello in a professional setting, I never expected it to be ""chianti-esque,"" but in a home setting I could definitely see the kinship between this and some better examples of Chianti Classico Riserva - red berries, leather, a little floral note, lively acidity, though more earthy notes - loam and mushroom - than is usually present on Chianti.  

Would I buy it again? If I won the lottery, sure, I would probably stock a few in my cellar and enjoy them in the winter with a hearty meal. And I still might when I'm feeling like I can spend the money (I get wholesale cost at work, so $42 is a little easier than $70) and am in the mood. It won't be often, for sure, but I'm glad I got to have the experience last night. 

Any experiences with Brunello di Montalcino you care to share? Any experiences about the changing nature of wine when paired with the right food you care to add?

1295367076.0	f4hpt	Please stop asking about sulfite-free wine. You cannot taste sulfites. You cannot smell them. They make the wine better. And you're not allergic to them, I promise. 		74	16	38	"   To make matters worse for your insufferable wine fad, no serious winemaker would even consider processing their wine to remove the natural sulfites that occur in grape skins. 

  So not only is this wine fad completely silly, but the wine itself that you drink as part of the fad is usually crap. A few hyper-local ""raw wine"" makers may have a decent bottle or two that had no added sulfites, but the large-production wines that make it into the grocery store are not decent, by a long shot.  
   
  About 1 in 10,000 people have a sensitivity to sulfites. A much higher percentage of people are sensitive to tannin, or are allergic to alcohol, or just feel bad the next day from drinking. As nifty as it that people attribute all kinds of physical effects to the glass of wine they drank, the much more likely reality is that you got bit by a mosquito in the night, or you have bedbugs. Those welps on your face are not caused by the red wine you had the night before. They're sure as hell not caused by the sulfites in that wine.

  For those of you who actually, really are sensitive to sulfites, please don't drink wine. Unsubscribe to this reddit. Sulfite sensitivity is dangerous, and can cause serious asthma-like attacks that can be fatal. And sulfite free wine sucks.
  
  For the rest of you, please stop. Listening to people tell me they have sulfite sensitivity all day long is like listening to people tell me that they're clairvoyant. It's a fad, and you're a moron. You'd probably believe you were sensitive to oxygen if Oprah did a show on it.

all of my bosses came in late last night (i was bartending), which in itself wasn't too strange. my phone is connected to our twitter account, and around 11 or so (when I still had about 5 active tables), I get a tweet from the food reporter for our local paper saying that we are closed. clearly i think this is in error, since i'm currently standing there making drinks and pouring wine. i show my phone to our owners and am like WTF?!! and they're like WTF?! at which point my immediate boss leans over the bar and tells me ""this is why we're all here tonight. we wanted to come down here and tell YOU personally that tonight was our last night of service"" i was floored. shocked. we all kind of thought this was coming, but we thought that we would have more time. 

ugh. i sent a note out to all of my wine reps thanking them for working with me for the last year + as i built the list into what it is today. most said they'll continue to hook me up, which is good.  so today i went back to the store to clear out all my personal stuff (wine books), and i took home a case of wine that was open. so i have a lot of wine to drink. like, a lot. i'm trying to get friends to come over to help me drink it! it'll be easy to find another server/bartending gig (the f&amp;b comm is a tight nit one around here), but finding another wine buying/somm gig is way more difficult. 

so i'm just kinda sad. and i wanted to tell you guys, because you're one of the best wine communities around. and since i'm kinda proud of what i built, these were my lists: [Summer of Riesling Menu](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22654/SOR.pdf), my [Riesling manifesto](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22654/manifesto.pdf) (inspired by paul grieco's list) that was the back of the menu, and [my BTG list before](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22654/oldwinelist.pdf) SOR kicked off.

I am quitting my job today. I'm an IT manager for a pretty big company and I've been here for 4 years. I am quitting to give myself more time to pursue my wine dream.

Right now I have a blog focused on California food &amp; wine which will eventually be a retail storefront for affordable, ""natural"" wine from California. I am in the process of setting up my company. So far I have a LLC, an account with the BOE, and my business &amp; home office are registered in the city I live in. All that's left is my TTB and ABC applications.

I hear the ABC application process can take a really long time. I planned on keeping my full time job until the licenses are approved; Unfortunately I've found that I am unable to spend enough time building an audience, blogging interesting material and interacting with people on social media - which I think is going to be essential to my success as a retailer - while maintaining a very emotionally and mentally draining full time job.

The whole Somellier handing you a cork to sniff thing.

It is a pretentious ceremony based on a misunderstanding which I personally ignore.

The point of examining the cork is to verify the vintage. Once upon a time most corks were branded with the vintage, so when the rats chewed the labels to bits, you could still verify the year.

Few corks are vintage stamped anymore, and fewer labels are rat gnawed. As I mentioned in the other thread, the cork can tell you loads about the cellering conditions, but nothing about the wine in the glass before you.

Yes, sometimes the cork has a funky smell, but what matters is not how the cork smells, but how the wine does.

So, when presented with the cork, ignore it (and don't be cute and put it in your ear, wine stewards have seen that hundreds of times)."	t5_2qhs8	True

1346004396.0	yv0fz	/r/wine Education Series, week 1 - The 5 Senses	IndustrialSabotage	49	2	45	"Welcome to week 1 of the /r/wine Education Series.  I‚Äôm planning on taking Sundays and devoting them in a thread to a specific topic about wine.  For those more experienced, we‚Äôre going to start slow, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you need to shy away for now.  I highly encourage as much participation as possible.

Who am I to teach?  That‚Äôs a good question.  I have 2 years retail experience, and another half dozen drinking on top of that.  I‚Äôm hoping that others in this sub are going to chime in and correct me where I‚Äôm wrong, or put in alternate points of view when it‚Äôs subjective.  Go wild, everyone!  You‚Äôve probably read some ridiculous description somewhere, at some time in your life.  If they‚Äôre not afraid to speak their ridiculous mind, then you shouldn‚Äôt be, too.

So, tracing back from the glass takes a lot of work, and most everything is educated to drinkers in context to how it affects the flavors in the glass.  Without a common vocabulary we can‚Äôt have a discussion about the variables that go into making a glass of wine what it is.

If you‚Äôve ever read a description of wine it mentions foods, geography, emotions, etc, and if you‚Äôve not been around enough, you might as well just throw it all out the window.  What I‚Äôm hoping to do in this is explore the 5 senses as you drink, and let you know what people mean when they say they can detect ‚Äúa hint of grapefruit,‚Äù or a ‚Äúnose of pencil shavings.‚Äù

I‚Äôm going to post sub comments about the different senses and how they pertain to tasting a wine.  This is from the perspective of someone analysing a wine in order to write a note or review, so applying these techniques backwards can help you to look at a shelf talker and know what they‚Äôre describing in their long flowery prose."	t5_2qhs8	True

This time, I offered to pair wines from my cellar (read: closet).  It was my first time doing pairings for a multi-course dinner like this, and I couldn't have been happier with the results.

[HERE'S THE ALBUM,](http://imgur.com/a/oiXpX#0).  His food pics turned out way better than my drunken attempts at capturing bottles with food, as you'll see.


* deviled soft-boiled egg with dill, mustard, and sriracha

       Paired with *2011 Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc Cellar Reserve* - Admittedly, I wanted to warm up the crowd with something easy.  It definitely worked.  Almost clear in color, with classic NZ SB nose of Lime, Grapefruit, Grass, and a touch of Jalapeno.  A little more restrained and elegant than the base level Villa Maria, which I sometimes find to be wayyy over-extracted.  The hint of sriracha on the egg made this first pairing a knockout.  

* buckwheat crepe with ramp confit, homemade ricotta, and balsamic syrup

    Also paired with the Villa Maria.  I wasn't quite expecting this dish to be so focused on the balsamic, so I probably would've changed up the wine, but it worked just fine.

* asparagus soup with crispy tips and croutons

    paired with *2011 Stadt Keller Krems Gruner Veltliner* - Huge florals on the nose and palate, with mouthwatering minerality and acidity that paired well with the creaminess of the soup.  Perhaps lacking in body and the peppery finish that I so enjoy from Gruner, but pleasant enough as a simple pairing.


* chicken liver mousse with sweet-pickled rhubarb, radish green, and lovage potato chip

    paired with *2006 Kreydenweiss Moenchberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris*  - Golden, almost apricot tinted.  Deep, ripe, sweet stone fruits and yellow apples.  It felt like it was just beginning to take on a syruppy quality, yet was completely dry on the palate.  The acidity was muted, the finish incredibly long. This pairing was remarkable, and was one that stick with me for a long time.

* lake huron trout in parchment with morels, green garlic, and bracken fern fiddleheads
    
    paired with *2010 Trombetta Family Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast*  I was way more interested in pairing with the morels than I was the trout, which was a little too delicate to stand up to this unfiltered, gently oaked Sonoma Coast Pinot.  Hints of smokey cedar, vanilla, creamy black cherries, and a spritz of minerality.  Juicy on the mid-palate, with a light touch of tannin.  Another crowd pleaser, although given another opportunity, I would've gone for Burgundy.

* lamb meatballs with herb choux gnocchi and mustard sauce
    
    paired with *1998 Pertinace Barbaresco Vigneto Castellizzano*  After decanting for an hour and a half, this wine was open, but surprisingly youthful.  For a Nebbiolo, it was still dark garnet in color, with very little browning around the rim.  Ripe cherries, red licorice, sprinkles of wet earth, and just a touch of tar.  It was deep, but not one of those revelatory moments I've had with Nebbiolo before.

* fried purple haze goat cheese with wild watercress and honey

    the star of the night, *1987 R. Lopez de Heredia Rioja Blanco Gran Riserva Vina Tondonia*  Dark golden brown, with an oxidated nose of salty caramel and nuts, very much like a Fino sherry.  On the palate, incredibly complex, and constantly changing.  Mashed apples, lemon, herbs, almonds, and ash, all with a waxy texture and an impressive amount of fresh acidity.  Paired with fried goat cheese and honey?  Holy mother..

* strawberry pavlova with pistachios  Paired with an after dinner nap, because after that white Rioja, we were DONE.

My fiancee and I have a combined 72 bottles currently, and with the many case clubs we belong to that number is constantly growing (that's not even counting random pick ups from wine shoppes).

Anyway, we had some friends over for dinner the other night. Most of my friends are well-educated regarding wine. These are people we regularly go to vineyards and do tastings with. We've travelled to Napa, France, and other parts of the globe with these people tasting wines. Essentially, we all have rather educated palates.

At this particular dinner party, in addition to our normal guests, we invited a few other couples that we normally don't hang out with socially.

Basically at our dinner parties we tell everyone to bring a bottle, and we spend the night enjoying them and having a good time. We had some great varietals at this party, but there was a bit of an awkward moment that spurred discussion after the fact.

One of the couples we don't normally hang out with brought a box of Franzia. Initially most of us thought it was a lark. One of my friends actually said, ""Ha, Franzia, that's priceless."", but then the couple that brought it said, ""What's wrong with Franzia? We drink it all the time."".

Now I'm not a snob, but I never drink Franzia. I absolutely hate the stuff, but this spurred a debate amongst friends the next day; is it appropriate to bring a box of Franzia to this type of get-together?

I'm of the belief that it is appropriate. They could have brought it due to financial constraints, or maybe they were just well-intentioned and didn't know any better. Basically I took the ""Grandma's house mentality"" of never rude when it comes to a gift. I thanked them, said ""Thanks for bringing it."", and I made sure it was opened and served alongside everything else that evening ... as to not be rude.

I even drank a glass with them myself, to make sure they didn't feel out of place.

A few of my friends thought it was rude of them to bring that. They thought it was the equivalent of bringing ""Bud Light to a craft beer get-together"". I think that's a bit of a pretentious opinion, but others I've spoken to agreed with them.

It was an interesting dynamic, and I'm curious as to how some other educated wine drinkers from this sub-reddit would have felt about the situation if it was their party, or had they attended the party."	t5_2qhs8	True

What is Chardonnay?

Where does Chard grow around the world?

How is it typically made?

Does it blend? By itself? Sparkling?

What are the traditional taste profiles in the various regions where it grows? Is it aged in oak? How much oak? 

Who are some of the distinguished growers and producers? 

What are some great vintages per each region?

What are some great values? 

What bottles do you enjoy?

What is your relationship with Chardonnay? What do you think of when you hear the term ""Chardonnay""?

And of course, add any other questions, comments, etc. you have. 

Have fun!

Edit:  If you're willing, please put in your posts what your relationship to wine is.  I.e., are you a casual drinker?  Winemaker?  Etc.  I think this will help everyone get a clearer understanding of the context of each post."	t5_2qhs8	True

But this Tokaji Asz√∫ - the Royal Tokaji 5 puttonyos - if this is what good dessert wine is meant to taste like, I'm officially converted. What an incredible experience. The seemingly unbelievably high sweetness (120 g/L) was perfectly balanced against the equally eye-opening acidity. Great flavors of apricots, peaches, and honey - and it paired extraordinarily well with a few strong cheeses after a meal.

I see myself drinking a lot more Tokaji from now on. I'm curious to hear what others think of this amazing wine, and any recommendations for particular producers or vintages."	t5_2qhs8	True

Are you for or against this paradigm shift?	6ixfoot5ive	49	12	86	I am responsible for ushering in a new era of wine service in Ontario. Wine on tap is gaining momentum among restaurants and the buzz has been getting louder with every sip. Not only is this trendy approach the most eco-friendly option, (no recycling) but the wine actually tastes GREAT! Restaurants can either minimize their by the glass menu by offering this concept as a house pour, or abolish bottles, corks and labels all together. Your profit margins will increase and your carbon footprint decreases by 50%. Each keg holds up to 26 bottles or 130 glasses, served at 5 ounces. With zero chance of oxidization, the first glass tastes as good as the last. So next time you're dining somewhere in Toronto, ask them if they serve wine on tap...you'll be pleasantly surprised.	t5_2qhs8	True

1365613576.0	1c2nst	Quite an astonishing blind tasting!	winever	43	7	36	"I just had a tasting class which blew me, and everyone in the room, away. The theme was our perceptions and the influence that they have on the wine. 

These three came out - we only had a sodium light on and the blinds drawn so it was nearly impossible to ascertain any hues of colour etc. He asked us to throw out a few descriptors and then how much we would pay for the bottle (done auction style - so highest bidder).

1) Oxydised, walnut, Sotolon, Bitter. The majority would not buy. One person had an idea what it could be and said ‚Ç¨15.

2) Brett, Chocolate, Oxydised, Earthy. Would pay ‚Ç¨3.

3) Menthol, Fish, Oaked, Vanilla, Animal. Would pay ‚Ç¨25. I personally found the wine to be clean, of a medium intensity with a decent volume in the mouth but rather coarse tannins which lead to a slightly chalky finish. Decent length but nothing astonishing - would say I've drunk wines around ‚Ç¨15 of a similar quality.


So the grand unveiling:

1) Tio Pepe: Fino sherry. So here obviously we'd all been expecting a white wine and found this oxydised, bitter concoction which most of us rejected as an old, overly evolved wine. Must note that my course is in France so sherry is not very well known. Actual price ~ ‚Ç¨25.

2) Cos Estournel 1984. Actual price ~ ‚Ç¨49. To be fair, this wine was pretty spent and definitely had more than a touch of Brett. Having said this, you serve the bottle with the label out at a nice dinner etc. I think people will be a lot more forgiving and find a few other descriptors!

3) This is where it gets interesting... Ch√¢teau Angelus 2004. Actual price ~ ‚Ç¨190. 

This is a room full of trainee winemakers here! Bordeaux, fine wine prices, all this aside, Angelus is reputed to be one of the great wines of the world. Unless they're being seriously fascetious, there are few who would say it is not a very good wine and I think most of us would pay handsomely (if not the asking price) to taste it. This left me in an almost existential crisis! If a room full of winemakers can not taste quality then how could a consumer? What is quality if it can only be judged when attached to a label? I realise that this phenomenon is quite well documented but I always slightly ignored it and though it couldn't be quite true but whoa!

1353694416.0	13oc6f	T-Minus four weeks to the Mayan Apocalypse. Time to start drinking the top out of your wine cellar. 	sdeutsch	38	5	13	"The best thing about the Mayan apocalypse is that there is no point in preparing for it. This is the lazy man‚Äôs Y2K. For those too young to remember, Y2K was when computers threatened, at the stroke of midnight in the year 2000, to prank us by giving us the wrong time. This sounds silly in retrospect, but at the time people were terrified to the point of hoarding canned food.

In the case of the Mayan apocalypse, hoarding is exactly the wrong strategy. After all, if the entire planet is reduced to a smoldering cinder, your stockpile of MREs and ammunition will do you no good. If the Earth is doomed, consuming is the smart move. To that end, we‚Äôve been drinking the top end out of our wine cellar.

If you needed an excuse, now you have one. For the next four weeks, live every day as though planet Nibiru is soon going to collide with the earth and send us spiraling into the sun. (Feel free to Google it. We did not make this up.)

We have read the NASA press release stating that there is no evidence of a pending apocalypse. We do give weight to their analysis since they are the same people who landed a rover the size of a Toyota pickup truck on the surface of the planet Mars. They do know a little about science.

On the other hand, famed scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson recently tweeted that he was drinking a very expensive bottle of wine from Burgundy, specifically a 1958 Jaboulet-Vercherre Volnay Santenots Cuvee Jehan de Massol. As far as we can tell, this bottle is not currently available for sale anywhere in the world. We therefor cannot quote an exact price, but it‚Äôs a safe bet that the bottle would retail north of $1000. This has to represent the top echelon of Dr. deGrasse Tyson‚Äôs cellar. Clearly, he is implementing our ‚Äòdrink that bottle‚Äô plan.

So your choice is simple: listen to what the scientific community has to say or watch how they actually behave. In other words, if you have a bottle of Burgundy from the late 1950s, now appears to be an excellent time to drink it.

Since we had gotten there in advance of the others, one friend already had a glass of the merlot going, and she said it was surprisingly good, given that it was the House brand. So, instead of buying individual glasses, we decided to go with a bottle, at only $20. The waiter brought it out, and at that time we learned it was [Red Diamond Merlot, 2009](http://www.reddiamondwine.com/wines/release/2009-merlot/). My friend then looked up prices for it online and exclaimed, ""SIX FREAKING DOLLARS?!"" 

Sure enough, yesterday I found it at my local grocery store for $6.50. It was the last bottle on the shelf... the wine steward said it was the most popular brand under 12$ and since it was Sunday, they were sold out and wouldn't get more in until later this week. 

I'm not saying this is a super awesome wine you simply must try, but it has incredible bang for the buck, and apparently is [a top 10 ""house wine"" for many restaurants.](http://www.snooth.com/wine/red-diamond-washington-merlot-2009/) "	t5_2qhs8	True

I know I was one of those people not but a who months ago!  

So if you're interested/curious/whatever, please fire away and I'll do my best to answer and give you a good overview of what this job/world is like.  I actually have the day off today (woo!), so I should be around for a bit to answer questions.  And if any other interns see this, please chime in, 'cause I'm way less experienced than most in this winemaking world.

Edit:  I made the wines for these labels: [Kesner Wines](http://www.kesnerwines.com/), [Bink](http://www.binkwines.com/), [Genius Wines](http://geniuswines.com/), [Lost and Found Wines](http://www.lostandfoundwine.com/#!home/mainPage), and a few varietals for the [Hess Collection](http://www.hesscollection.com/).  There are about 30 other boutique style labels that produce there, many of which you'll probably have heard of (Donum Estate, Laurel Glen, Carlisle, Sequana, and more).  The nature of the winery is that you help everyone help if needed too, so I contributed in one way or another to pretty much every label we produce for.  Pretty awesome walking around a wine shop and seeing multiple labels you know personally!

Rita Hills of Santa Barbara County for 19 years, and biodynamic is still practiced by some in this Valley.  Most would admit, at least after a few glasses, that it's marketing hoopla, and the impact cannot be quantified.

I am constantly asked about my opinion on BD as a grower, so here goes:

Positive:

Observation and walking the vineyard every day is the best fertilizer and way to manage.

If BD gets you into the vineyard more often, it may have a positive effect.

Negative:

Rudolph Steiner was a charlatan who did not believe in atomic theory, and wrote that humans were 'stuck' on their way to becoming beings of ether.  he had no formal agronomic training and admits as much in almost all of the pubbed BD lectures.  

I equate BD and Mormonism:  batshit philosophies, but generally very nice people who practice it.

BUT HERE'S THE MONEY SHOT:

Even if BD is 100% efficient in doing all the things the hippies want it to, there's a serious problem applying it to New World vineyards, especially California.

BD was a system to encourage ripeness in Northern European vineyards, specifically in Germany where it is very difficult to achieve ripeness over 22 brix.  The goals of CA viticulture are 100% antithetical to those of germany.  they want to encourage ripeness, we want to hinder it and get as much hang time as possible to achieve full flavor while balancing brix and pH.  

So even if it worked, I posit that it would reduce quality of CA wine because of hastened ripening and minimizing hang time.

Thought I'd share.  I have a video of me debating this with Randall Grahm--I'll try to get ituplaoded soon so you winos can check it out.

For those of you that do not know what a McGangBang is, it is a McDouble, double cheese burger or a quarter ponder with a McChicken or a Spicy McChicken patty in the middle. If this helps at all the way I will be ordering them is a McDouble with a regular McChicken patty only mac Sauce. 

And for those of you who have not yet tried one of these bad boys are missing out, Go to McDonalds right now and order one. Just Walk up to the counter and order one if the cashier does not know how or if they can do it ask to speak to the manager. Tell the manager to ring up a ""McDouble, Ala-cart McChicken patty, ask me. the ask me is to put the McChicken patty in between the McDouble."" they can and they will do it, trust me I Work at McDonalds.

1339607780.0	v03d5	Argentina - Beyond Malbec	81611	29	3	19	"While Torrontes is the ""other"" grape of Argentina, it is far from the only other grape grown here. Some with more success than others.

Cabernet Sauvignon is the most notable. While in most parts of the world Cabs tend to be tannic and need some time to soften, in Argentina, for better or worse, they are much softer, and easier to approach young. I personally really like the style. In Tupungato (where I live) the Cabs tend to have a spicy character, along with being fruit forward. In the Barrancas section of Maipu, Cab as with all the grapes grown there, tend to have more structure, but are still softer than most other parts of the world. Even without a ton of tannin, the Cabs tend to age well, thanks to the ample fruit that sees them through the years.

Bonarda is not well known outside of Argentina, but it is beginning to be. At its best it can age to become complex and similar in flavor profile to a Bordeaux. At its worse it tastes like grape candy (foxy). Yield is everything. At one of the spectrum it is wine in a box, at the other it is fine indeed.

Tempranillo gets the short shift, even in Mendoza. There are a few ""serous"" attempts, but because of the lack of popularity, most are lighter, and very approachable. There is a charm to their soft cherry character even at this lower level. While they may not have the complexity of a Malbec or a Cab, they are often a more perfect lunch companion, especially in the warm days of summer. At around ten dollars, in a restaurant, they don't hurt the budget much either. I would be surprised to see many of these exported.

Petite Verdot is a blending grape which in Bordeaux has largely eclipsed Malbec. In Argentina it is the other way around, with a touch of PV going into Malbec dominated blends. I am always astounded at the quality of Petite Verdot here. Some winemakers don't like it because it is so complex, they like their flavors simple. It is the complexity that appeals to me. A few wineries produce varietal PV, one of the most notable being Vistalba.

Syrah is common, but I have not met one I like. It is often added to blends, but I have no idea why. It adds color, but there is plenty of color already. One of my favorite grapes elsewhere, it is not wowing me here.

Merlot has varying success, and Cab Franc is rarely bottled varietally, but like Merlot is common for blending.

Viognier is one of my favorite grapes, and so I may have a soft side for it, but I like it here, more than any of the other white grapes. Acidity is a real problem in these high dessert vineyards, and Viognier does a good job if holding its own. 

Chardonnay is prevalent, but it is just one more new world Chard. Some can be very tasty, especially in the lots of oak and diacetyl styles. Chard at least hides the ever present acidification better than some grape varieties.

Sauvignon Blanc. Sorry, there are too few to recommend. Few are terrible, fewer are good.

Friulano (formally known as Tocai Friulano, also known as Sauvignon Vert which to add confusion is not the same as Furmint from Hungary, but is sometimes referred to as so).  This rather ordinary grape with the name issues is the backbone of white wine in Argentina, bad white wine in boxes. Some references cite there only being a small amount planted, but my on the site references assure me there is a lot of it. The one bright shining star from this grape is the Grand Lurton, from Francois Lurton. It is the base of a very interesting, maybe even exciting blend. Along with Viognier and Chardonnay, the Friulano makes a complex wine that is worth looking for.

Riesling, Gewurztraminer and Muscat exist in small pockets but they are not great, or even really good.

Sparkling wines here are inexpensive, and fun. Not up to Champagne standards by a long shot, but for those that enjoy a Cava like experience, the sparklers here are not to be missed."	t5_2qhs8	True
1339156850.0	urg7i	Any amusing or bizarre stories of snobbery (failed or actual) out there?	grandpa_kens_burrito	29	3	138	"I was doing a tasting a few days ago with a large group of mostly regulars.  We got to a bottle of Malbec that was very up front about a small amount of Cabernet Sauvignon being blended in (6%).  This started an interesting conversation about a winemaker's motives for adding a small percentage of blending grape into his or her wine and everyone was cheerfully chiming in until one guy tried to shut us all down by saying that he had worked in the wine industry and without exception the only reason why a winemaker would add such small amounts of another grape to the varietal was because he or she had some extra lying around and needed to get rid of it.  It's not art, it's not choice, it's business.  Period.

Another regular disagreed, saying that while it may be true that some wineries approach it that way, he thought that most of the smaller houses (insert definition here) would never be so cavalier about what they put in a bottle.  Shut-down guy took offense to this and jumped right into the ""well you don't know, do you?"" argument.  This went back and forth a few times and got pretty heated until we had to step in and end it.  The rest of the class was awkward.  Anybody else seen wine knowledge go haywire?"	t5_2qhs8	True
1337730929.0	u04f6	To anyone seriously considering a career in the wine, beer or spirits industry, please read this rant	AnInquiringMind	45	16	39	"Today, I met a friend of a friend who is about to graduate from a brewer's training program at Niagara College. I was introduced by my friend, who asked that I impart some advice about entering the industry - I have been in the business for about ten years, and I've owned a small but reasonably successful wine agency for a good chunk of that time.

The conversation started off pretty lightly. We talked about beer styles and trends, about the influence of different countries in new brewing techniques, about the direction things might go in the future. I realized that this very nice young fellow was also quite intelligent, and had some very creative ideas. I decided it might be worth it to put him in touch with one of the largest and most successful craft breweries in Canada, the owners of which are very good friends of mine.

This is where things took a turn. I mentioned the name of the brewery, and he immediately looked up and said ""oh, they make faulty beer."" Of course, I asked him to elaborate. ""It's a diacetyl fault. The beer is too creamy.""

Alright, let's back up for a second. Right after I try and give you an opportunity to work alongside one of the pioneers of craft brewing in Canada, you've now gone ahead and insulted their product. But let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

""Have you considered that people like that style of beer? Maybe that's why they sell so well?"" (To be honest, this is the truth - it's a unique beer, a cream ale texture wrapped around a pilsner core)

""No. It's bad beer.""

I don't normally get upset over things like this. But I'll be honest, this kid made me want to punch a wall. But, benefit of the doubt time. I am also acquaintances with a large macro-brewer who could give this kid a solid paycheque and valuable industry experience.

""No thanks. I think macro-brewing is killing the industry. I don't want to be a part of it.""

And rather than argue, I left it at that. Thanked him for the conversation, didn't bother getting contact information, and seriously hoping I never see him again.

Now, as promised, I would like to give every prospective winemaker / brewer / other new entrant into the industry some basic pieces of advice.

**1) UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR BUSINESS IS PEOPLE, NOT PRODUCT.**

You are only as good as your ability to interact with other people. The general rule of thumb in the industry is a sparkling personality can sell a reasonably good product, but not the other way around. If you deal with people the same way this asshole does, you will not do well in the industry.

**2) THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY IS A LOT LIKE THE ART INDUSTRY.**

I've never met someone who, to this extent, insisted on artistic integrity and creating what they feel is their own expression of a perfect product. *This will not get you far in the industry.* More often than not, industry best-sellers are the product of testing, reviewing, and marketing to a segment that can reasonably support your venture. Yes, there are a handful of people that develop their ""perfect recipe"" and manage to garner enough interest to support themselves, but for every one, there are a hundred ""starving artists"" out there.

*Understand that you will have to compromise your artistic integrity, at least in the short run.* If you want to create something out of pure love for the process, then create a small batch for yourself or a few friends. If you're well established, you can make limited batches for the public. But if you're fresh out of brewer's college, don't start getting the impression that your kale-and-chipotle-porter is going to have you rolling in money and women.

**3) DO NOT MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU ""LIKE"" THEIR BUSINESS MODEL.**

There is something to be learned from absolutely everyone in the industry. Large companies can teach you about scaled production, marketing, and retaining a competitive edge. Smaller businesses can give you insight about the biggest hurdle, which is gaining market entry. Do not ignore this, it is vital. When was the last time you saw a want-ad for ""winemaker""?

**4) NEVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. INSULT SOMEONE'S PRODUCT.**

Would you show up to an art gallery and tell the artist ""your painting is absolute shit""? No. If you don't like it, you smile, you say ""it's not to my taste"", and you move on. You try and understand why some people like the artist, and why some people dislike them. But you definitely don't talk shit about them. The industry is not as big as you think. People talk. And in an industry where the biggest names have been around for decades, names are not easily forgotten.


OK. That's about it for me. Anyone who made it this far, thanks for reading. If I can help just one of you out there improve your career prospects, then I consider it worthwhile.

There's a wealth of great information on this sub, and I thought it would be fun for some of us to share where we are (and where we've been) in the industry, how we got into the wine business, and how we developed our palates and wine knowledge. I'll start:

I grew up stocking shelves and breaking down boxes in my parent's delicatessen/wine shop/bierstube. My dad started teaching me to taste with Riesling and Gewurztraminer when I was between nine and ten. When I turned 21, I started tending bar at their establishment. 

When I moved away for college, I found a specialty beverage retailer (espresso bar, beer and wine shop, bulk teas, etc.) and took over their beer and wine department. After building up their program, I left and took a management job at a resort restaurant, where I ran their wine program and locked down my first sommelier certification.

After the restaurant, I got my dream job: running my town's largest and most-awarded wine shop. I managed a 2400 SKU inventory, and did approx. $4m in gross sales/year. It was a ton of fun, but I was working for a gigantic, soul-sucking corporation and I hated the ethics of my company. I left after 2.5 years. 

I'm now a sales representative for a fine wine distributor. I have about 50 accounts: mostly independent retailers and locally-owned restaurants. My book is heavily Italian (we represent Winebow, Dalla Terra, and Small Vineyards), but we also have a large NW presence, and a handful of California cult producers. Commission sales is a little nerve-wracking, but I love that my efforts translate directly into my paycheck. 

My ultimate goal in the industry is to end up as a national sales representative for a single winery or a portfolio that I strongly support. I love the wine business, and feel uniquely blessed that I get to make my living selling, promoting, and drinking the world's best wines.

So, r/wine: what's your story? "	t5_2qhs8	True

So I pushed the glass away for a bit, but after a little while--like a faithful college kid--I came back to it and had another sip from my glass and it had completely changed.

Staying: Likely in Yountville - somewhere like Maison Fleurie - we are planning to spend 4 days in the Napa Valley and 3 in SF.

Food: We are currently debating going to The French Laundry. It's long been a dream of mine but worried husband will be underwhelmed because of cost (if we can even get a reservation). Would you recommend going or spreading the wealth to various other places? Recommendations for awesome hole-in-the-wall type places?

Wine: We love big cab sauvs and zinfandels. My husband also loves beer and I understand a visit to the Russian River Brewery is a must. We plan on visiting Cakebread, Stag's Leap and Chateau Montelena for sure. Someone told me to book at tasting at Cakebread NOW - is this true? I understand that September will be busy because of harvest season. We mainly like reds but will taste whites as well.

As for San Francisco, any suggestions for places to eat there?

Anything I've missed? We are open to trying anything!

Edited to add: We plan on being in the Valley from a Tuesday to Saturday.

Well, here comes the weekend. Lets talk about the best piece of passing advice someone has given you that you've never forgotten


Mine was in that first catering job I mentioned in another thread. I was working a function at the Town Hall and one of my duties was pre-opening the wine behind the bar (This was in the days when screwcaps were just starting to take-off in New Zealand, but were still regarded as a curiosity). 


I'd seen my supervisor go through a case of wine and just take the entire foil capsule off the bottle neck. Ok, I thought, that's a quick way to do it, and I started copying him. Moments later one of our more experienced staff came over to me, slightly horrified, and said, ""What are you doing?"". I explained, and the guy says, ""Ok, you *do* *not* open bottles of wine like that"". 


He took out his Pulltap and showed me how to do a perfect [French cut](http://img4-3.realsimple.timeinc.net/images/food-recipes/cooking-tips/0808/081-s1-wine-bottle_160.jpg). He explained to me (nicely) that the foil is part of the bottle and removing it in entirety is akin to removing the front label. ""Ok"", I say, ""But why cut it below the ridge? Everyone else just [cuts the top bit off](http://www.wine-tastings-guide.com/images/open-a-wine-bottle-2.jpg)"". ""Well"", he says, ""When you're drinking good wine you don't want *anything* coming into contact with it before it hits your glass. The foil is often made from metals and if you cut it at the top, the wine dribbles over the metal before it reaches the glass. It can potentially effect the taste and it's better not to take the risk"".


Well shit! I wasn't sure if I believed him, but I later found out he was very well-known around town as a professional waiter. I was a teenager.


Later in life I would be taught how to decant old wine with a candle and what glasses to use with specific wines, but to me, this simple lesson in etiquette and history changed the way I thought about opening wine. Well, to be honest, I actually started *thinking* about opening wine. And that's a good thing.


It's not a huge deal really, but every time I go out to a nice restaurant I always look at how they open their bottles. It all goes back to the 60 seconds that guy took to teach me something new."	t5_2qhs8	True

CondorKhan	31	7	15	"More than a couple of times it's happened that I go to a blind tasting and end up really liking huge, oaky, alcoholic fruit bombs at the expense of more subtle wines. I buy a bottle, and I get home and I take 3 or 4 days to finish the thing because on its own, I find the super oaky fruit bombs to be fatiguing to the palate after one glass. Whereas I open like, 1er Cru Pommard and have to stop myself from gulping the whole thing in one sitting.

Then I put myself in the position of a wine reviewer that has to taste 30 wines in one sitting... after having a bunch of stuff and your palate becoming more numb, isn't it reasonable to expect that big, fruity wines tend to stand out more and sort of smother down the more subtle ones, and therefore the scores would be biased as a result? Is the practice of tasting long flights of wine inherently biased against softer, subtler wines?

1332865770.0	rg11b	The myth of Biodynamic wines	81611	32	9	120	"If you ask people of they believe in magic, few will respond in the affirmative. And yet, how else do you explain the popularity of biodynamic wines?

[Here](http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4026) is a decent, rational look at biodynamics.¬†

According to the biodynamics.com website:¬†Most biodynamic initiatives seek to embody triple bottom line approaches (ecological, social and economic sustainability), taking inspiration from Steiner‚Äôs insights into social and economic life as well as agriculture.

This sounds great, and I am all for it. Where is the magic you may rightfully ask? Read the [link](http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4026) above (this is the same link). I am linking to Skeptoid.com not only because he does a good job of exploring the topic, but to keep this post shorter.

My question to the believers, even those that reply ""well some parts of the practice may be odd or even silly, but it does make better wine"" is simply: what makes you think so? ""I have had great biodynamic wines"" you might say. so have I. There are undeniably great winemakers using biodynamics, but is the wine good because of biodynamics, or the winemaker?

You can only make great wine from great grapes, but is biodynamic the reason the grapes are great? If so how can there be great wines made from more reasoned approaches?

One of the great myths of wine is that non organic or biodynamic wines are the product of much fertilizers and chemical sprays. There are a few problems with this assertion. First and foremost, stressing vines, not coddling them is how you make great wine. Secondly is the age old problem of economics. The less you spend the more you make, so why would anyone want to do more than they have to in the vineyard?

Bad wine is made from bad grapes (and all too often from good grapes and bad winemaking). Bulk wine vineyards are much more likely to be fertilized and sprayed. No one is making bulk wine from biodynamic practices. Why not? Cost. Even if the magic works, biodynamics is a solution looking for a problem.

Reward those who do rational research and move wine forward, not those who practice superstition and are moving wine back into the dark ages."	t5_2qhs8	True

2- In your opinion, what are the most important things to know when you're a beginner in wines?

3- Where the different flavors contained in wines such as vanilla, mushrooms, earth, other fruits and many more come from? Is it part of our imagination or is it due to the oak barrels and additional flavors?

4- What is the best way to differenciate all of the words such as tannin, acidity, light/medium/full bodied, rich, soft, dry, simple, complex, etc., in an effective way? Any other answer than just taste as many as you can?

5- How do you know what year a particular wine will be at its best? Because of the grapes used or somebody just taste it every year? Do they sell bottles made for aging in regular wine stores?

6- Are barrels generally used for aging the wine just good for one season or they can make several seasons? If so, the newer the better or having an old barrel is better?

Thank you for answering!

I've been reluctant to bring this up, because I'm very conscious of the fact that wine can be an intimidating subject for many people, and I want [/r/wine](/r/wine) to be a comfortable and welcoming community for all people who enjoy wine, regardless of their experience or knowledge level. HOWEVER, I feel that there are a couple of types of posts that come up over and over again here that are getting really repetitive and tedious and drag the overall quality of the subreddit down:

**Post type #1: ""I found this old bottle of wine, is it worth anything?""** 99.99% of the time, the answer to this question is no. Usually the wine is not something capable of long-term aging to begin with, and even if it is, it almost never has been stored properly to have any resale value. 

I think this could be solved with a simple addition to the sidebar simply stating that the bottle of wine that you found in grandma's closet probably isn't worth anything, and suggesting a couple of other places to check before posting here about it (wine-searcher.com, hdhwine.com, etc.).

**Post type #2: ""What are some good (cheap) wines to try?""** This is just too broad of a question to foster any discussion of value, and really is just exploiting the expertise of the community without adding anything back into it. There are dozens of websites that offer wine buying advice if that's what you're looking for. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with people asking about specific types of wine to try.  For example, ""What are some good zinfandels under $15?"" can spark an interesting discussion about different peoples' experience with zinfandel, but just asking ""what are some good wines to try?"" is like asking ""what are some good books to read?"" 

I'm also a member of [/r/bicycling](/r/bicycling) , and after getting inundated with ""which bike should I buy?"" posts there, the community decided to start a separate subreddit called [/r/whichbike](/r/whichbike) specifically for buying recommendations. That might be a bit extreme for [/r/wine](/r/wine) at this point since we're still a relatively small community, but perhaps, like many other subreddits do, we could provide a list, or a link to a post with a list, in the sidebar of some places to go for wine recommendations (i.e., eBob, Jancis Robinson, Speculator, etc.), with a suggestion to check them out before posting asking for blanket recommendations.

I really want to see this community become an active and vibrant one for discussing all things wine. I don't know if anyone else is even bothered by the issues I've brought up, but I'd love to hear your feedback. If others feel that this is indeed a problem, perhaps some else will have a better solution to suggest than mine. I'm also happy to help put together sidebar content, or start a master post of wine publications, if people think that would help. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!"	t5_2qhs8	True

http://www.antoniniceresa.it/prodotti.asp?lang=en&amp;c=Vini&amp;s=Fragolin&amp;p=Fragolin-Rosso

However, even though it's referred to as strawberry wine, it's not made from strawberries. It comes from this grape: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_(grape)

I'm currently studying abroad in Florence, and I asked my wine teacher about it and she told me that it's absolutely fantastic wine, but impossible to find anywhere unless you go to a local farmer's vineyard.  Unfortunately, I've only got a little more than a week left here and don't have the time to scour the country side :( (believe me, I'm kicking myself in the ass for not buying some from the restaurant).

But I've fallen in love. She told me to look into Brachetto, but I've tried it and it doesn't have the same deep color, nor flavor that this wine had (though admittedly, still quite delicious in its own right). Are there any other things I should try while I'm here? I've also looked into finger lakes wines (since I study up there for college) and there seems to be a fair share of Isabella grape wines up there, but those will have to wait till September for me to try ):

Some French winegrowers planted American vines after their Vitis Vinifera died so they would have something to drink and sell, even though they all hated the flavor. One American vine called the ""Noah"" grew easily and produced a ton of grapes, so people delt with the bad flavor. It was a white wine, but people added coloring to make it a red wine if they so desired. A few years after it became popular, heavy drinkers of Noah were going blind or falling into dementia. Decades later the French government learned that fermenting Noah grapes created a side-product of pyschotropic ethers like wood alcohol, which is a violent toxin to the human nervous system.

1346208087.0	yzyva	For All the Haters	ChampagneFloozy	27	4	20	"A little history: Back in the 60's and 70's (and much earlier), some folks in California were figuring out that they had the potential to make really *great* wine. They had the right soil, the right climate, the right people, the right moment in history to do such a thing. And it was wonderful - passionate people set out to make great wine in this new frontier. As one would reasonably expect, those who sought greatness used existing standards of greatness as models: Bordeaux and Burgundy. So they planted Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Chardonnay. 

When they harvested and vinified their Chardonnay, they also emulated greatness: The *greatest* (and most expensive) wines of Northern Burgundy - Meursault, Montrachet, Puligny, et all - are heavily oaked. These versions of oaked chardonnay are different, though. Taste them in their youth and they are all buttered popcorn and burnt toast. Give them 5 or, sometimes, *many* more years,  and they are the personification of elegance. Fruit, mineral, subtle oak spice, perfume, and that *je ne sais quoi* of great wine...

Over the next 30 or 40 years, however, many California Chardonnay producers (the big ""Brands"" being the worst offenders) seemed to acquire an ever-accumulating, long running amnesia about their original, Burgundian model. Oak became an overbearing but easy way to compensate for the lack of quality fruit, which was an unfortunate, economic necessity for those looking to turn a large profit. 

By 2012, the ""California-Style"" of Chardonnay is so far out of favor that it is a laughable joke. ""Anything but Chardonnay"" is the dominant decree.  California has only itself to blame for this, as it bowed to what it thought people ""wanted"" and *would pay for*, rather than producing the best wine it could produce.

That being said, I want to remind the average wine consumer who, understandably, avoids Chardonnay: *It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest and most noble grapes on earth*: A mystifying chameleon that is capable of harnessing both a dominant personality and the complete submission required to express *terroir*. It saddens me that it is the brands of California which dominate the definition of Chardonnay in the mind of so many consumers. It saddens me to see people judge chardonnay without judging it's origin and producer first; this particular chameleon is only as great as its handlers, which I suppose could be said of all vinifera grapes. 

So, I would like to remind you of the wonderful things produced from the same grapes as Rombauer Chardonnay and Kendall Jackson Vintners Reserve Chardonnay, and I assure you, none of them taste like ice cream or a hot buttered rum:

- [Champagne Salon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_Champagne): Considered the greatest Champagne on the planet. All Blanc de Blanc Champagne is 100% Chardonnay, and many more Champagnes incorporate Chardonnay into the blend. Champagne is probably one of Chardonnay's sneakiest masks, if you are trying to judge the wines by grape rather origin - which is, actually, another good reason to avoid judging wine by grape before origin.

- [Chablis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chablis_(wine) is considered by many to be one of the single greatest expressions of *terroir* on the planet. It is 100% Chardonnay.

- While oaked California Chardonnay currently plays the wine-nerd villain, there are producers who continue to ignore fashion (kudos!) and produce the best, oaked when necessary - often heavily, California Chardonnays they can. [These wines](http://www.kistlervineyards.com/chardonnay/) are, contrary to popular belief, capable of aging, often for 7 - 10 years or longer, and they are world-class.

- And of course, let's not forget Burgundy proper, not counting Chablis. While the south, the Macon, is the source of an unbelievable amount of affordable, delicious Chardonnay (which tend toward unoaked but are variant), it is the Northern part of Burgundy that shines the brightest. The [Cote de Beaune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_de_Beaune) is home to the greatest concentration of great Chardonnay villages, but the [Cote de Nuits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_de_Nuits), despite its pinot-oriented rep, is home to a few as well. 

I would also add that Chardonnay has found wonderful homes in Italy, Australia, Austria, Oregon, South America, and South Africa, (and more) especially when in the hands of quality driven, passionate producers.

So I beseech you, next time you hate on Chardonnay, check the source. Consider this amazing, noble grape's history and track-record of proven excellence before you decide you hate Chardonnay.

In the meantime im thinking, why did i just shed $50 on this ? If the world of wine is an amusement park, champagne is the seesaw. 

so let's go in steps here: 1st i want to know HOW to do it: meaning, should i try them not so chilled ? should i pour it in regular wine glass ? how long should i wait and how much swirling without losing the gas ? 2nd i want non exorbitantly priced pairs that teach me 1 - body, i went from lansom to veuve, couldnt see the difference in body (i have tasted most of the big labels mentioned on zraly); 2 - differentiating pure chards vs pure pinot (blanc des blanc vs blan des noirs), the scents should have been obvious but never were; 

id rather you give me examples in growers instead of big labels.

now, im not saying i dont enjoy it, i enjoy bubbly, but when im not paying attention.

MyNameIsDano	27	7	51	"Yesterday as I was driving home from work and getting excited at the thought of visiting my local wine shop to pick up a new bottle of Sherry, I realized that I have become a Sherry lover. It started as trying new things last fall. I kept drinking it because the bottle is good for a long time after opening, and most nights I just want one glass of wine in the evening, so the already open bottle of Oloroso or Amontillado seemed like a better choice than opening a new bottle. And I can pour half-glasses because it's so strong, so the bottle lasts longer. And it's been really cold in Boston so a strong, nutty Sherry has been perfect lately. And now I love the stuff. It's been about all I've been drinking the past few months. I was disappointed at how few Sherries are available at the two best wine shops in my area. One had one dry Sherry, a Pedro Romero Oloroso for $13, and one had a few, with the most expensive being a Lustau Oloroso for $23. Since a bottle lasts for weeks, I would happily pay more than $23 to try some really great stuff, but I don't have that opportunity (I may have to go exploring this weekend). 

So all that is to say, any other Sherry lovers out there? Why do you love it? Who is a good producer to look for?"	t5_2qhs8	True

It's very consistent in so many movies, and I'm wondering if it's deliberate. It's not aesthetically pleasing and it's just wrong.

Now for some more discussion. Out of curiosity, what are your drinking, eating, and exercise habits? What styles and brands do you find yourself drinking during the different seasons and how much a day/week/month? How much does an ""everyday"" wine cost and what do you usually spend on a bottle for a special occasion (and how often)? What do you drink other than wine? Care to share your age? How you go into wine? Lastly, why do a lot of people drink champagne only on special occasions?? 

I know some of these questions are a bit personal so please don't take offense; I simply love learning about other people's habits, preferences, and so on. Cheers!"	t5_2qhs8	True
1368537776.0	1eb93u	What's the deal with California chardonnay?	apingyou	27	6	52	"I'm mostly partial to French wines all around (they're what got me into wine) but love CA and Oregon pinots, New Zealand sauv blancs, etc. The one thing I have consistently disliked, however, is CA chardonnays. I'm sure it's simply a matter of never having a good bottle, but what are they doing with the oak that the French don't do (or do differently)? Over the past weekend we were sharing some great bottles of white Burgundy but eventually ran out. My mother-in-law then opened her bottle of Kendal Jackson reserve chardonnay and I couldn't stand it. The oakiness was extremely overwhelming, it seemed to have a buttery, artificial vanilla taste, and was basically undrinkable. Even one of my favorite local breweries does a CA oak-aged double IPA and I can't drink it because of the overpowering wood notes. 

Any info? Can someone recommend a CA bottle that will be similar to a Burgundy, or are they just different breeds all together?"	t5_2qhs8	True

This is not to be a moment of mods jacking each other off and I'll be brief:  Imho, the only value a bricks and mortar shop can add is someone w/ excellent nose doing the triage, filtering the lake of average wine and picking the jewels and i feel her shop in asheville does that better than most independent shops I know. The wines were in the $20s to late $30s, had length, evolved, and had many fruity and funky notes, some were close to perfection and, had i tasted them blindly I would have guessed at least twice the price. specifically they were anton bauer 07, albert mann pinot gris hengst 10, reichsgraff von kesselstatt 06 spatlese, and crampilh madiran 07. So the purpose of this is, if you are new to wine, live in the south, and want to either learn about wines, or get some interesting stuff, her place is where i'd go. Every fortnight, there's someone here on reddit asking for directions on how to learn about wines and we steer them to our mediocre FAQ.

I think most of their beers are mediocre, so I got to wondering if their yeast is one of the reasons I don't love it. And that got me wondering how much of a role yeast plays in the styles of New and Old World wines. I know the lines are blurring and there are earthy, toned-down wines from America and fruit bombs from Europe, but they're generally different. I went to a tasting last week with half a dozen white, half a dozen reds, half from the New World, and half from the Old World.

1354745324.0	14chwd	A Note from a Retailer Regarding Special Orders	Son_of_a_Bacchus	24	5	16	"I don't want this to come off as a rant, but I notice that many of my customers aren't really aware of the challenges/obstacles I have in special ordering certain wines. I figured that while I had a day off, I'd vent/inform some of the folks in here about why I might be less than eager to take your special order.

1) You had a wine while on vacation, and want to buy it here: All wines are not distributed in all states. This means that if you had something in Arizona that you adored, I might not be able to find it in Kentucky. However, I'm going to take the time to check with 12 different distributors to help you find it. This really does take a fair amount of time. Also, that wine you drank while having lunch on a hillside in Tuscany is going to be 2-5x as much here, and probably not taste nearly as good while eating frozen pizza around screaming kids; prepare yourself to be underwhelmed.

2) Ordering a single case of something might not guarantee that I can get it to you at the best available price. This varies from state to state, but I often have to plan out purchases in 3-15 case buys of various items within a particular portfolio. Otherwise, I don't hit the level of discounting that another retailer who is more heavily invested in those brands might achieve. These buying levels can affect the single bottle cost as much as $2-$6, depending on the buy.

3) Please God, order an entire case. My distributors charge me anywhere from $.25 to $1.50 for a split case. Additionally, I lose whatever case discounting I might get for the whole case purchase. When you ask me for a price quote on a three bottle purchase, I'm probably going to look bad and I doubt you're going to stick around for my explanation as to why I'm so expensive. As a retailer, I get REALLY nervous about people perceiving me as being too expensive.

4) Please pick up your order in a timely fashion and buy the ENTIRE order. While we work really hard to accommodate as many people as we can, your ears might start to burn a bit if you special order something, only to make me trip over it in my stock room for 4 weeks before you bother to pick it up. I can definitely see where some smaller retailers might feel the pinch of having their operating capital tied up in a case that they're holding for one person. Also, ordering a six pack of something and then deciding you only want two bottles is borderline infuriating. I'm now stuck with product I didn't want and have to figure out what to do with it. There's probably a good reason I didn't have it on my shelf in the first place.

I really hope this doesn't come off as overly bitchy and I'd welcome rebuttal from other retailers and consumers. It just seems to be a chronic lack of understanding from the consumer's side of things. Also, I realize that laws vary from state to state. These are simply the challenges that I have."	t5_2qhs8	True

I would love recommendations (or alternate suggestions). I am primarily looking at Thanksgiving at the moment but have a bit of room for a few food-friendly bottles.

I was thinking of picking from different crus so we could compare.  If so, what should I look for? Or is this a bad idea? Also, are there any domestic gamay noirs that are worthwhile and reasonably commonly available?

I've been out of wine for a couple of years and am just now getting back in.  I have access to a local liquor store that carries a nice selection of wines, some grocery stores, and a Trader Joe's, but no specialty shops, sadly.

Please, any suggestions - Thanksgiving or not - would be wonderful.

[ Beaujolais blanc thread that inspired me](http://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/139h6y/beaujolais_blanc/)

Edit: I went to our liquor store and found the cru Beaujolais section. Practically every bottle they had had deBoeuf on it - deBoeuf Moulin a vent, Brouilly, etc.  I'm not sure those are worth trying?

The good news is, I found a local independent wine store as I was leaving the parking lot!!!  They were doing a wine tasting so I'll probably try back on Monday.

There is an amazing study done by Hogue Cellars [Here](http://hoguecellars.com/feature/homework.html)

There has been a good deal of study on enclosures and their resistance to oxygen. Scholarly papers tend to cost a great deal to read, but even the¬†
abstracts are worth glancing at. [Here is a Google Search](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=oxygen+permeation+cork&amp;hl=en). Summary : More air may get in through the sides of natural cork then through the cork itself. This changes over time, and natural cork is better over time than some alternatives, but screw caps start and remain hermetic unless a gas permeable liner is employed.

The jury is out on the importance of oxygen permeability during aging. Peynaud said no, hermetic seals are what we want. My gut feeling is the same. Oxygen ruins wine, and turns it brown. We want fresh as possible wines, even those aged for decades.

TCA is responsible for the nasty aroma of a ""corked wine"" due to the bleaching process of the corks (not a fungus) but as [Perdue points out in this quick read](http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf) just using chlorinated water or certain cleaning solutions may lead to airborne TCA contamination.¬†

For 10 years I taught a wine tasting course and the very first exercise was a component tasting. This is an invaluable tool for everyone, even pros (more on that later).

You take several bottles of simple red wine and you add the basic wine flavors to each.¬†Control (nothing added), alcohol, sugar, grape tannin, tartaric acid, untoasted oak, toasted oak. A teaspoon of each, or so, is all you need.

You learn three valuable lessons when you do this. First, that wine tastes bad when throw it out of balance. Two, what each of these components really tastes like (pros especially, see the note in the next paragraph). And finally that each of us has different thresholds for these basic tastes.

Note: Most people, even or especially pros, get tannin and astringency (from adding acid) confused. This is because of the balance triangle, change one side and another side is also affected. Adding acid makes a wine astringent, which is the dryness against your front teeth that is associated with tannin but is made more pronounced when the acid balance is raised - technically the drying of the buccal membranes [Source](http://www.sensorysociety.org/ssp/wiki/Astringency/). The haptic sensation for tannin is a tightening in your jaw muscles. Grape tannin about half way back, and oak tannin all the way back.

The upshot of each of us having different thresholds is that it to some degree determines our preferences. If the wine with the tannin doesn't taste too strong to you, then you likely enjoy Cabs (and probably black coffee). If like me you grimace at the tannin, you probably like Zins and Pinto Noir.

I have done these tastings at shows and wowed people with my predictions of their likes and dislikes.

So next time you pass up dessert remember that it is because you have a low threshold for sugar and it is much sweeter to you then for most people.

Arrival day, everyone in the party flew into the Oakland airport with an AM arrival time and then we loaded into a 15 passenger van that was rented from Avis. First stop was at Urban Legends Wines just 10 minutes from the airport. The next stop was at a large club warehouse for supplies (all breakfasts were made at the house we rented in Cloverdale, CA.). Then we stopped at a Whole Foods in San Rafael, CA. for the snacks we ate each evening while enjoying wines from the day on the porch and in the pool/hot tub that was situated in the backyard. Shortly after the two supply stops we made it to the house with ample time remaining to settle-in and familiarize ourselves with the house before heading to dinner reservations in nearby Healdsburg. We topped the evening off with beers at a brewpub walking distance from the house. First tasting day, day one, we were picked up by Jonathan in his Wine-A-Bay-Go at the house around 9:30am and headed out to our first winery appointment. I‚Äôve mapped all this out in google maps with attached details of who to call or email at the winery to make the appointments and the layout of days and times. The links to the maps are below. Please use my planning to maximize a trip for you and your friends. I was focusing on the wineries that are small, off the beaten path, or new-up-and-coming. There are 4 wineries that I would not skip, Pech Merle, Ellipsis, Mary Elke, and Sbragia. We only did two days with the help of Jonathan and his Wine-A-Bay-Go. The other days we drove ourselves around because I choose to taste and spit. It was all worth it. I found that Jonathan was a wealth of knowledge and wished I would have used his ability to get tastings at locations that were less likely to make appointments otherwise.

It is a subject I have been thinking about more recently especially after reading this [Eater.com article](http://eater.com/archives/2012/09/07/corkage-culture.php/?) on the subject.

I broached the subject a little last week in the [""How much more have you paid at a restaurant vs. a wine store?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/zbpzc/how_much_more_have_you_paid_at_a_restaurant_vs_a/) thread.  [This was my comment to the submission.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/zbpzc/how_much_more_have_you_paid_at_a_restaurant_vs_a/c63ehhu)

I wanted to see other people's opinions on the subject since I am admittedly a little biased since my pay is [indirectly] linked to the restaurant's wine sales.  The policy at the restaurant I work at is this: we allow a maximum of 2 bottles per party, regardless of party size or bottle size [so a party of 12 people would be allowed either 2 x 750ml bottles or 2 x 6L bottles].  The bottles cannot be exact offerings on our wine list.  We charge $25 per 750mls in the bottle.  We waive one corkage for each comparable volume of wine purchased from us (i.e.- bring in a 1.5L and we will waive the corkage fee with the purchase of 2 x 750ml bottles).  

* What are your experiences/observations with corkage?  

* Have you noticed an increase, decrease, status-quo?  

* What do you think a proper stance for a restauranteur to take is?

the 97 muscadet - nothing like any muscadet i have ever drank, doesnt look smell or taste like it. believe it or not it's deep gold, it smells tropical fruit and tastes mineral. it would overwhelm the traditional oyster pairing. if it were a blind taste, everyone would flunk. excellent.

robert denis azay-le-rideau 89 - nose different from palate; deep yellow, acidic, had this sweet cognac scent. huge length.

clos the roche blanche 98 cot - my favorite malbec ever; at 12%, dense liquid, cowpie and plummy nose. again, clueless in a blind taste.

the clos rougeard 97 - the best cabernet franc 4 out of 5 of us have ever tasted: olives and cigar, no fruit at all, length, i can still smell it in my mind, again 12% alcohol as every wine should be.

96 le mont sec. apple pie &amp; funk, acid and heavy body, smells sweet, it is not.

coulee de serrant 07 - letdown or, the least interesting, no acidity no freshness, a lil sweet.

le mont 71 moelleux, tasting history, a lil oxidized, very discrete sugar, still lots of acid, dark, yet another scent i didnt think chenin had, would go perfect w/ a white risotto, a chicken w/ creamy mushroomy sauce, but than again, it would be a waste to eat too much w/ it. by then i confess my nose was tired. the coteaux du layon impressed me more.

I know, I know, Sauvignon Blanc, right? Believe me, I'm as over it as the rest of you, but I'd have to have my head in the sand if I didn't acknowledge what this expressive grape has done for my county's wine industry. Think of all those NZ Pinots, from generous to silken, we make some amazing wine. That wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the great crowd-pleaser itself, Sauvignon Blanc. It keeps our industry afloat with the sheer volumes of it we export and it broke us into the international scene at a time when we were being associated with sweet, German-imitation Muller-Thurgau and bad Riesling.


So I take my hat off to you, Sauvignon Blanc. You might not be my cup of tea, but I admire your teapot. Tell me about some of your favourite Sauvignon Blancs from around the world...


I'll start with three of my favourites. 


Cloudy Bay Te Koko Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough - Gorgeous barrel-fermented Sauv from the people who put kiwi wine on the map. Supremely full and balanced wine, without being over-the-top and lip-puckeringly acidic.


Merry Edwards Sauvignon Blanc, Russian River Valley - It says a lot that I took a bottle of this back with me to NZ after my CA visit. A kiwi bringing American Sauv home, taking up one of the valuable 6 allotted slots. Yep. This wine is the business. Myriad tropical fruits, great texture and a raunchy label to boot. The wine tastes and feels like a peach.

Part of me feels like this is something of a waste, in that champagne should be for a special occasion, and something to share etc. 

That said, I feel that whenever one has champagne on a special occasion, it's often:

(i) preceded by other drinks (which potentially dulls the sensation of what can be a quite delicate wine);

(ii) taken in an environment of noise and frivolity (weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduation etc.) which inhibits the ability to concentrate and savour the taste.; 

(iii) served at sup-optimal temperatures, either because it's been left out before being opened, or because it's been sat in a glass, poured but not drunk, during lengthy toasts; and

(iv) is often shared amongst a number of people, so you don't really get to to experience as much of it as you want.

Is the above sufficient and legitimate reason for doing this, or just greedy self-justification?"	t5_2qhs8	True

This was sent to me by a regular customer of mine a few months ago (only just remembered it). She had bought a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc from us and consumed most of it without anything untoward appearing, but after leaving it in the fridge overnight and pouring the end of the bottle into her glass, this appeared. She said it also tasted/smelled really strange (I can only guess that she didn't notice the substance until she'd had a mouthful, because why the hell would you put that in your wine-hole?), but couldn't really elaborate on what the off flavour was. 

Now, the really interesting bit - this particular bottle was one of thousands that my company fills out of a tank in our warehouse, and not one single other bottle came back with the same complaint, nor did we find another in our stores after we had a look. I thought initially that maybe whatever it was had precipitated after coming into contact with oxygen, but as we keep bottles of this same wine open in the stores for tastings and none of those exhibited the same junk in the bottom, my theory bit the dust...

Can anyone shed any light on this? As it's not happened again, it's purely to assuage my curiosity. Due to the colour, I was thinking maybe it's some kind of precipitate of copper sulfate?? That particular Sauv had definitely had some DMS and H2S-type smells so I wouldn't be surprised if the warehouse folk had given it a bit of copper to clean it up.
I guess we could call shenanigans on my customer, but she's been coming in for years and has never pulled anything weird before...

After some google searches on a few of the bottles but couldn't come up with anything conclusive as to their worth.
I live in a small town, so finding an expert on vintage wines would be difficult.
Could any of you offer any insight, or direct me to someone in the Dallas area who could shed some light on this?
I'd like to make sure I'm not ruining a good vintage wine if I crack one open. :)

Edit:  I had a family member take [pictures of the necks](http://imgur.com/a/sXu6E) to show you kind people how much ullage these bottles have.

I do not intend to drink or sell them, but I'd like to learn something about them. Can't say I've ever tried a Tokaji before, but from what I gather they're not too unlike a Sauternes. 

Info from the label on the back of the left bottle (only about half of the label is intact):

1868 Tokay Es...

This wine was formerly property of the Royal Imperial House of Austria-Hungary...

The right bottle is in much better condition. The label says:

I've been working quite a bit of overtime lately, and as such, I have a little bit of spending money in the old bank account. I have had what I would call a love affair with wine for quite some time, and would like to buy myself something ""fancy"". 

Mainly why I'm here is to get advice on (obviously) vintage ports. As I'm still in what would be considered the 'noob' stage of wine as far as taste go (I do love a good merlot or cab sav.), I know for a fact that I love me some port. Since I also have delusions of grandeur (see my r/cigars posts for more on that), I would like to get a nice, tasty, all out awesome  bottle of vintage (90's or earlier) port. The problem is: I dont know enough about wine/grape year production values. I dont know if I'm even using the right terminology here so I'll throw out some laymen terms here. I want a good grape harvest/wine production year for the possibly best port that was made in the past 10 - 30 years. 

Since I'm also a self proclaimed ""cheap bastard"", I'd like to keep it under 150 - 200 dollars. If you guys could make some suggestions, also where I could find it online to order from, I would be forever grateful.

the useless brood: this all started with the exchange i had w/ [winever](http://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/viv1r/a_collect_call/c55e6up), me being the usual dick, he/her being the usual polite/constructive redditor. the idea is to compare the way we describe the same wine, positively or negatively, showing traits we tend to emphasize and our blind spots. It is a great opportunity for pros, academics and noobies to exchange methods, views and approaches. there was a thread on jancis that started like this:

""In my experience with blind tasting competitions I've been fascinated to observe the cultural differences that seem to exist when tasting wine.

The British school of thought, with which I'm most familiar with, seems to favour a highly analytical approach - perhaps influenced significantly by the WSET. We are taught to assess colour, the intensity and profile of aromas and flavours, then the 'structure' of the wine: acidity, alcohol, sweetness, etc. We then arrive at a conclusion about the wine relating to its origin, its quality, the winemaking, etc.

The French, by contrast, seem to have a much more holistic approach. Specific fruit aromas or alcohol levels are ignored in favour of how the wine feels and the overall harmony and balance of the wine.

The Australians I've observed focus a lot on the texture of a wine - where the wine 'hits' the tongue, how long it lasts there, where it progresses and whether it comes back on the finish. Are there layers of textural sensation or does the wine follow a linear progression. I've even seen a first hand demonstration of a winemaker poking his own tongue out and illustrating with his fingers where he finds different aspects of the wine engage!

I'm curious as to how everyone tastes and assesses wine (whether blind or not) and if you have noticed any particular approaches associated with different cultures.""

So let's do this experiment.

you can leave a comment on the initiative, or preferably, the wine you think we all should taste on that weekend. why the 25th of august ? because that leaves plenty of time for us to circlejerk about which wine and time to buy the fucking wine. let's get it on...

NOTE 1 : without the experts and pros participating this project goes to shit. so, to the latter please, please participate by suggesting which wine you would be willing to drink analytically, through and through.

I have been to more than these, but this was a convenient list to work from. The purpose of the magazine is to promote tourism in Argentina, and so I have never published a critique like this one. The closest I have come, other than the regular blind tasting reviews, is the results of last year's People's Chice Awards (which I did not have a vote in - and winners are noted).  So this is an exclusive report for /r/wine. 

* Achaval Ferrer - Tiny winery with very high quality wines with even higher prices.
* Alta Vista - Solid performer, especially at the Premium line and up. Premium Torrontes is a favorite. Vineyard designate and appellation wines are especially good.
* Andeluna - Founded by the heir to Frito-Lay. An early player in the Uco Valley / Tupungato area. Great views, decent lunch, wines over produced for my taste.
* Atamisque - Small but gorgeous winery with well made wine that are not my favorites. Restaurant for lunch is famous for their trout.
* Benegas - Old family winery that has very pricey wines. Most too structured for my taste. Top wine good, but should be at that price.
* Bodega Bomba - Beautiful estate, wines old fashioned an unremarkable.
* Bodega Norton - A long time leader in production. Good for the money, but uninspiring. Decent restaurant.
* Bodega Weinert - Specializes in high quality wines with a great deal of age on them. 
* CarinaE - Tiny winery, one of Michelle Roland‚Äôs clients. Decent wines, great place to visit on your bike. Pricey.
* Catena Zapata - One of the best known of the top wineries. Their very best is very good. Everything else is good for the money.
* Clos de Chacras - Structure forward wines that are good examples of their class. Fun little restaurant.
* Diamandes - Part of Michelle Roland‚Äôs Clos de Siete group. Very over produced wines, not at all to my taste. Expensive, and popular with the oak loving crowd.
* Dolium Winery - A very small winery built underground. A true gem. Their Cabernet especially ages well and is exceptional. Buy any time you see one.
* Domain Bousquet - Formally Domaine Jean Bousquet. High quality, especially for the price. Organic grapes (and I like them anyway). I consult to their hospitality department. One the most medals in the blind tasting.
* Don Bosco - Old churn owned school and winery. Wines are not up to modern standards, but a great place to visit.
* Familia Zuccardi - The biggest of the big. Their Santa Julia line is common, and well priced. Of the top tier Q line I am most fond of the Tempranillo and none of the others. 
* Finca Agostino - Solid medium of the road producer.
* Flichman - Big, but high quality. Their Cab / Malbec blend ‚ÄúExpresiones‚Äù won top honors in the tasting. Look for their regional Malbecs.
* Francois Lurton - One of the original Europeans to discover  the wine potential of Argentina. High quality, well made wines. My favorite of theirs is actualy an unusual white blend Gran Lurton.
* La Azul - Microscopically small winery with very high quality wines, and recently a new cute bistro.
* Lagarde - Very high quality, especially their top line. One of the best Viogniers in the country.
* Lopez - The big boy of aging wine in casks forever. Moderate quality but a rare chance to taste well aged wines for very low prices.
* Masi Tupungato - From one of the largest agricultural companies in the world, based in Italy, comes a unique concept, passito (dried grapes) based reds and unusual white blends. Kudos for individuality, even if the wines are not my favorites.
* Navarro Correas - Owned by Diageo, one of the largest producers of everything alcoholic in the world. From spirits to wine and beer, if you drink you have had their brands. This winery is decent quality, it helps to have deep pockets. Best at the upper end.
* Nieto Sentiner - A solid performer and producer of perhaps the best Bonarda in Mendoza.
* O.Fournier - Very high quality, and priced accordingly. Beautiful winery far to the south of Mendoza.
* Otero Ramos - A self made man who worked his way from picking grapes to owning a modern winery. The wines reflect the experience and passion. One of the best high end Cabs.
* Pulenta Estates - A very old and prestigious wine making family. the brothers who own this winery are more famous for racing cars, and the winery in part exists to export wine to allow them to import Porsches. Good quality, especially the Pinot Gris that got a Best of Show at the tasting.
* Pulmary Winery - Fly speck of an organic winery in an old repurposed bodega in downtown Chacras. Pricey for what they offer.
* Ruca Malen - Very high quality, and long lived wines at a price. Decent lunch. Their Chardonnay won Best of show at the tasting.
* Salentein Winery - Beautiful winery, with a great art gallery. Well known and some of the wines are better than others. Not my favorite.
* Tapiz - Great tour, fun llamas, good restaurant and hotel (far from the winery) . Wines are decent to slightly better.
* Tempus Alba - Innovative and high quality. Their Vero Malbec is one of my very favorites, although it is very expensive.
* Terrazas de los Andes - Solid but not inspiring producer owned by Chandon.
* Trapiche - Largest exporter of Argentine wines. Most are unspectacular until you get to the top.
* Trivento - Yet another large producer with decent wines at the top level.
* Vi√±a Cobos - Paul Hobb‚Äôs winery. The middle line, Branemare, which are regional and vineyard designated, are by far and away my favorites.
* Vistalba - Decent wines, great restaurant. Their Corte A and B at the top end are very good, but you pay for it. They make a varietal Petite Verdot that is worth looking for."	t5_2qhs8	True

**sub-question**: would a wine seller be offended - as my father warned me - if I asked him for a low quality wine?

I am currently reading [Emile Zola's L'Assomoire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Assommoir), which is a very immersive window onto my ancestors' day-to-day life. One of the things that has made a strong impression on me is the way the working class (including the children) consumes wine as if it were our nowadays' water. Wine was also highly regarded in terms of health effects and, in one funny monologue, the husband even goes on to explain how - despite living a life of poverty and being despised by the ruling class - wine is the only scale to which the worker can be equal to the emperor, as they could both challenge themselves to a drinking contest and there would be no unfair advantage to the benefit of the ruler.

But this bottle is 12 years old. 


Am I going to need to decant it and, if so, how? Do I pour the whole bottle into the decanter? How long does the wine need to sit in the decanter before I can chug away at it?

I'm having a big, multi-course wine-centric dinner in my home for some friends this sunday. After a big meal I like a simple, refreshing dessert, like sorbet or mousse. So tonight I whipped these up to serve at the end of the meal:

**Lemon-Moscato Sorbetto:**

Make a simple syrup with about 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water. Squeeze 3 lemons, grate the zest of one, and combine this with the simple syrup and 2 cups of **good quality** Moscato d'Asti. (Remember if you can't drink it, don't cook with it.) Put this in your ice-cream maker and let it work its magic. Freeze for a few hours to a couple days before serving. I'll be garnishing mine with candied lemon peel.

**Raspberry-Brachetto Sorbetto:**

Make a simple syrup again with 1/2 cup each sugar and water. In your food processor or blender mix the syrup with 2 cups of raspberries (fresh or frozen) and 1 1/2 cups good quality [Brachetto d'Acqui.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachetto_d'Acqui) Once again, into the ice cream maker and then the freezer. I'll be garnishing this one with grated chocolate.

These are tasting delicious, and I imagine will be moreso after they are more thoroughly frozen in the freezer. I used [Sant Evasio Brachetto d'Acqui and Elio Perrone Moscato d'Asti](http://i.imgur.com/9XWVoLh.jpg).

I'm still just a beginner but this time around I managed to only trip up on the Chilean Torreon de Parades. Once I got that sorted out, the others kind of fell into place.

Sorry about the picture quality!

http://imgur.com/a/Owd8c

Some of my woefully inadequate notes follow:

From the left

1. Chateau Lanessan Haut Medoc 2003 France (Bordeaux)
    Not a bad Bordeaux. At this age the colour starts to become a seductive bricky red rather than the deep red of the jailbait vintages. Really nice caramel and black cherry wafts. I also got fresh chopped bananas... Medium body with the tannins settled but a bit of a short finish. If it were cheaper I would recommend it as a show of how certain flavours in wine develop over time.

2. Torreon de Paredes Valle de Rengo Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - Chile
    I tripped up on this one at first. I mistook it for an Australian wine. Hey, I'm new at this, whattya gonna do. Anyway the colour was lighter than I expected. The nose was heavy with a tarry scent, but once you get past that there is some strawberry as well. The taste is quite fruity, a bit of a contrast to the smell. Very tannic but would be pleasant with some grilled meat I reckon. Medium body with a decent finish. Not a big fan of this one, but that could be my limited palate's fault.

3. Aramis Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon 2010 - Australia
   This was the kicker. I thought this was French at first. Beautiful deep colouring and a powerful fruity nose with plenty of cassis and chocky too. This wine is a great mouthful. A really rounded, quite full body with texture right across the palate. 8/10 would drink again, and again!

4. Ile La Forge Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - France (Languedoc)
   This Paul Mas wine was very up front with aromas of ripe mandarines. Light on the tannins and not a bad finish but not much length. Pretty cheap so would have no problems drinking it again.

5. Mercedes Eguren Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 Bodegas - Spain
   This is the one my nose kept coming back to. I think because I am still new to all this, there are so many aromas that I haven't experienced in wines yet and I was just amazed at the enticing citrus on the nose. The mouthfeel was quite sturdy with rich tannins. Again the citrus was prevalent in the flavour and I just had a feeling of Valencia oranges...but anyway this affordable wine is really worth a look. 

Well, that be that. I hope it was adequate. I really do enjoy the whole tasting experience and can talk about wine for ages, but anyway I welcome everyone's comments however vitriolic or complimentary! Thanks for reading. Now, bring it on...
