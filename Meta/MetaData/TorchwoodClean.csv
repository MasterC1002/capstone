When I was watching ""End of Days"" (S1E13) with my dad, I started freaking out when you can hear the TARDIS and Jack leaves at the end of the episode. He has absolutely no idea why I'm so happy/spazzy, so the next day we spend 9 hours watching Doctor Who. After about..oh..a week, he had caught up to the current Doctor Who episodes (when Matt Smith was just starting out). Then we started Torchwood over and watched all four seasons together.

TL;DR: After 17 years of not really having much to connect on with my father, Doctor Who and Torchwood have given us something to talk about together. &lt;3

And then I watched Children of Earth. and Ianto dies, and I know it's not his fault, and then he sacrifices his grandson to save the world, and I can't stop myself from thinking ""There's not another child in a mile radius you could have stolen?"" I could feel the hatred his daughter had for him and I understood it, but I also understood, that if there was one man on the planet that would sacrifice his love, and his family to save the world it was him. That's who Jack is. His daughter even says in ""He can't die, he has nothing to lose."" And so there I am, mad at him, but knowing that he did the only thing he could, and that only he could do it, and at least that made him a hero. Until the end, when he quits, and runs away, and he turns into a coward once again. and I think more than anything else, that's why I want to hate him. because it's as if it's all for nothing, he's just run away, his daughter will grieve alone, Gwen will have her family- but no purpose in life besides that. 

I know there is Miracle Day, but as It's not on Netflix I don't know when I'll be able to watch it, and after all everyone's said about it, and the emotional  rollercoaster I just went through, I'm not sure I even want to. 

It was a good story, one of the best seasons of television I've ever watched, no happy ending, lots of death, and showing the human race for what they are, some of them are great, and will stand up to anything, and some them are cowards who care only for their own skin.

Edit: Thanks to everyone for your comments and fantastically detailed opinions. I really appreciate the discussion.

Chucklebuck	37	6	5	"I'm rewatching Torchwood after a number of years and I'm really starting to appreciate the merits of the earlier episodes that I had previously discounted. Small Worlds has an underlying air of sinister menace and Countrycide is downright *terrifying*.

However, Random Shoes is the one that really got me. When I first watched it, I thought it was merely an alright little episode, but now, with much more life experience, I've discovered that it's really a message that you're always living life to the full, no matter how trivial and unimportant what you're doing really is.

We focus on the good, but never on the bad, which is what makes the good things happen in the first place. We don't appreciate the bad things, which, while painful sometimes, are just as important as the good things. We focus on the big events in life, when the small, everyday pleasures and frustrations are just as, if not, more important.

Essentially, nothing you ever do or any emotion you feel in life is a waste of time. It's all we have, so no matter how we spend our waking moments, it's all a worthwhile exercise, defining who we are and the legacy we leave behind.

Random Shoes is now one of my favourite pieces of TV of all time, along with Children of Earth and Deep Space 9's 'Far Beyond The Stars'.

In ""Captain Jack Harkness"" Tosh and Jack were stuck in the the 1940's.  Jack claims he fought in WW1 And WWII. Does that mean the future Jack was frozen in Torchwood, while the other Jack was working for Torchwood in the 1940's, and the present day Jack was their with Tosh, so 3 Jack's in the same era?

The Doctor, for all his good and bad is NOT human. He burns at the center of time &amp; can see the turn of the universe but he is NOT human. Jack is. Jack Harkness is vulnerable to all the human emotions we are, but being ""immortal"" he suffers it worse. He has seen more death, felt more love, endured more pain than any of us could and it shows in his actions &amp; personality. Yes he can be a dick, but he can also be an incredibly passionate &amp; caring man, and I think, once you accept and realize he isn't ""The Doctor"" of Torchwood but a mere Human, trying to do his best to right the wrongs in society &amp; put things right, he truly becomes the character he was mean to be.

Why didn't Captain Jack do it? If he were to go back to 1918 and he can't die, he would just live life all the way up to the point he went back in time and it would be as if he never left.

I became a Whovian this summer, and finally got around to watching Torchwood in the last couple weeks. Season 2 finale was pretty brutal, so I began CoE thinking it would be like a rebuilding of the crew (spoilers ahead) only to have the hub blown up, Ianto die and then the totally effed up Day 5 with Jack's grandson. Woah. I'm beginning to wish I hadn't started watching Torchwood. When I rewatch Doctor Who now the character of Jack is going to be very different, almost tainted. I was just shocked by the dark turn the show took (and it was a pretty solemn show to begin with). Did everybody else have this reaction when they first saw CoE? Maybe I just need time for it to sink in, but right now I'm certainly wondering what the point of that was and what the writers were thinking. 

Ok, rant over. Thanks for listening Reddit!

And before anyone who goes ""oh she told Rhys before retconning him!""  fuck you.  That doesn't count, that was a selfish dick move on her part.

Checking out Amazon, I see that there are several different versions out of the collected show - some with Miracle Day, some without, some on DVD, some on Blu-Ray.

Are there any major differences between the various versions that I should be aware of?  I'm mostly talking about bonus materials here, of course - I know that the image quality on Blu-Ray is going to be higher than DVD, but if the DVD has cool extras that the Blu-Ray doesn't, or if I get more bonuses by buying Miracle Day separately or even buying each season one at a time, that would definitely factor into my purchasing decisions.

Also, I know that on Doctor Who the BBCA version is slightly shorter than the regular BBC version - if Torchwood does something similar then I definitely want the longer version (though formatted for US players).

1335914136.0	t2b6e	Thoughts on the series	Dura1110	5	0	8	"Hi, I just found this subreddit, never thought of actually looking for it (along with Doctor Who) and I was wondering what everyone thought of the series or if it is easier how everyone liked each season.  

It has been a while since I saw all the seasons but the ones I remember the most are the third and fourth (third because I was sad that they were ending the show and fourth because I was excited and thankful that starz picked it up again).  The main reason I started torchwood was because of Jack and it being a doctor who spin off but it became it's own thing.  I think the one persistent problem I had with the show was Gwen.  First season she was the newbie so her behavior was understandable but then the second season it kind of keeps happening but honestly looking back I think the main problem was that she had a personal life which screwed with everything.  

Anyways, it died down a bit and she still isn't my fav, but she is accepted.  Looking back, I can't recall it all but I would rank season 1,2,4 all equally good but the 3rd was just too damn awesome, by far my favorite.

Thoughts?

They watch Doctor Who so they have heard the word Torchwood thrown around and are somewhat familiar with Captain Jack Harness, but otherwise they are unfamiliar with Torchwood.  

I am trying to come up with a list of Torchwood episodes so they can get a feel of the series and have a better appreciation of Children of Earth.  Then hopefully they can be convinced to go back and catchup with the entire series.  =P

Does such a list exist or does anyone have any suggestions of essential/key episodes to capture the essence of Torchwood?

So far I've got:

Season 1; Episode 1:[spoiler](/s ""Introduces Gwen and the rest of the team.  Introduces Jack's ""unique"" nature."")

Season 2; Episode 6-7:[spoiler](/s ""Brings in a familiar face(Martha Jones), shows the kind of tasks Torchwoods deals with, explains Owen's zombiness"")

Season 2; Episode 1, 12-13: [spoiler](/s ""Introduces Hart, sort of sets up stage for COE"")

And you are enraged because the writer presents it in a negative light (it is Gwen's father, and Gwen is you, she acts as audience surrogate). But then MD is over and I stop to think. Wth? Would we really do that? Yes, some people will not pull the plug on their loved ones if they end up in a state that they are kept in life only artificially without chance of recovery ever, but it is not what most people would do. And in MD we are talking people that are in pieces.

Miracle Day movie was ok. That kept me waiting to see what was next.










Children of Earth was more of a Doctor Who story, that they pass on and gave it to Sarah Jane and they passed. Leaving Torchwood to use it. I mean good story but drags on a little to long in some parts. I hope they make new ones soon, New writer could work too.

In Who, only Gwen and Ianto show up as Jack's team which means that it obviously takes place after season 2 and before Children of Earth.  However, in those episodes the team clearly meets and talks to the Doctor.  In Day 5 of Children of Earth, however, Gwen makes the video asking about the Doctor as if they never met.  Not to mention...where is the Doctor when an alien race is taking the earth's children?!?!

1337943912.0	u4b1n	Does Torchwood get any better with Miracle Day? Children of Earth was so disappointing! [Spoilers]	jjness	2	3	7	"So as a recent Doctor Who fan, I was surprised to find out Torchwood wasn't a show about the Wild Wild West (guess that's Deadwood maybe?) so of course I watched it on Netflix.

Seasons 1 and 2 were ok, entertaining enough, but nothing fantastic. Children of Earth came along and wow, things are suddenly... great! This miniseries is gripping, frightening, powerful!

Until they get to Day 4, and the virus. The 456 release a virus in Thames House and it kills everyone (but Decker or whoever that old guy was, and Jack, of course). Then, at the very end, all those dead people are laid out in a gymnasium, under blankets, and they're letting any old person just walk in there and see them?!?!

How the hell am I supposed to believe that the sucker-punched government is going to enter Thames house, disinfect the entire building, analyze the released virus, deem it not dangerous or contagious anymore, remove the bodies, and allow anybody to walk up to them without protection or precaution?!

This was the point where I became disillusioned. I watched Day 5 just to finish it out, yeah there were some powerful themes, Jack's sacrifice of his grandson, blah blah blah. It didn't get better. There was no real conclusion, no resolution. Nobody questions why they are dealing with druggies?! That doesn't change their policy? Not one mention of how the government, nay, how the world, changed 6 months later, just some half-assed attempt to end Torchwood as an institute when the world needs them most?

Children of Earth felt like the BBC wanted to step up and play in the big leagues of well-produced and well-written television, but I feel they've fallen flat. It's disappointing, as I enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 as a campy, fun, almost b-rate sci fi series, and just when I got my hopes up that it had graduated to something more serious and dramatic, the rushed conclusion and loose-end questions only stood out all the more obvious.

So, should I bother with Miracle Day? Does the story ever get resolved? Or should I just cut my losses and move on to a new series? I know this is a rant post and probably an unpopular opinion, I just wanted to know if Children of Earth was as bad as it gets.

1322287101.0	mpmre	I'm not trying to be offensive, but i had to ask. Why is Jack so gay?	diabolical-sun	4	6	7	I want to start by saying dont get me wrong. I have no problem with gay people. This isnt an anti-gay thing, but i've always been curious. In Doctor Who, the thing i liked about Jack's sexuality was that because he was from the 51st century, he was attracted to ladies and gentlemen and variations thereupon. During the 51st century, human's new mission was to seek new life and... dance (so many species, so little time.) But in Torchwood, he mainly goes for men. You rarely see him look at a woman.

1338046727.0	u621b	Finished the 4 seasons yesterday, this is my impression on the whole series	Charliiiiie	1	3	0	"I started looking at Torchwood about a month ago, and with an episode rate around 2/day, I finished Miracle Day yesterday. I must say I really liked the entire serie. I was first surprised at the beginning (like ""wtf iz this show"" at episode two with the orgasm hunter alien), but then I found out that it was a nice serie. I was a bit disappointed by the number of episodes without aliens or really strange stuff, but in the end it's not that much important. While I really liked the whole serie, I'm not a fan of the direction the serie is taking from season 3, I think having one plot per episode is way much better than only one plot for an entire season (if I want that kind of stuff, I'll just look at 24). Also, what I liked about the first two seasons was that it happens exclusively in Wales, whereas season 3 happens mostly in London and season 4 in the US, with almost no welsh/british actors. I find that it takes a little element out of the serie, season 1&amp;2 have more ""charm"".

So here are my impressions about the four seasons. I'm sure I forgot a lot of things I wanted to say but my point was that I really liked it, and that I'm a bit worried how it will turn in the following seasons, I'd really like that it comes back at something like in season 1 and 2. I hope there will be a next season soon (I read that won't happen in 2012, but didn't find much more information about when it will restart)."	t5_2rsvo	True
