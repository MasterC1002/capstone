1340326199.0	vetj6	Curiosity on demographics of this subreddit.		22	5	43	"I'm american and graduated college a couple of years ago. I was suggested Peep Show on Hulu during my senior year and the next thing I knew I was spending all of my free time on Hulu (I nearly had to attend another semester to graduate).  I always held the opinion that Seinfeld was the end all in terms of television comedy until I saw Peep Show (now I can't put one in front of the other).  I met a couple of guys my age that were visiting from the UK and when I told them I loved Peep Show they were really surprised.  They condescendingly told me they didn't think Americans were into that kind of comedy. Those guys were asshats but that's neither here nor there.  My question is, how wide spread is the fandom of this wonderful show?  Is it popular all around the world or just the UK?

Therefore, I firmly believe that what made ""Mitchell and Webb Look"" more popular (especially with its global impact) was that laugh track, making all who watch feel connected with the scenes and supported in laughing at a show with clever and wit.

The show was still funny, but the plot fucking sucked!!! 

I'm honestly depressed by series 7 and 8, I found a quote that sums it all up:

""It's almost as if Quantocking is the last absolute golden episode maintaining Peep Show universe and by Quantocking II we're in some horribly deformed alternate reality. (Although the moment Mark gives terminal illness reasoning for the failed conference is perhaps the prelude over-the-top moment to this)

This also coincides with a change in director, Tristram Shapeero to Becky Martin. The latter of which has directed every episode since Quantocking. Together with the false flat set and losing the headcams for ""better quality"", the heart of Peep Show is alterted. Zany quotable lines over banal Seinfeld-show-about-nothing character driven things has made it a show I care little about. ""How thick is wall?"", ""Depends"" to Hans being shot in the rear with a ball bearing? It's some journey this show has taken!""

The show tries too hard with the inner dialogue now. No one gives a shit about Dobby when you turn her into such a crappy character, Peep Show was at its best when the focus of the episode was not always the same fucking thing for the entire series. Instead the plot is shit no one cares about that goes for an entire fucking series. Notice how the series had to rely so much more on Superhans than it used to, the 2 main characters have turned into such cunts, and Olivia left because Sophie also turned in to such a shit character (seems to be what has to happen for mark's love interests) Dobby's friends are just boring and shit.""
