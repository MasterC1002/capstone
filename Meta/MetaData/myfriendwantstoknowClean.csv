My friend was having sex with his wife, not doing anything out of the ordinary, and BAM: Huge penis.  He said it felt like a bat in his hand when he pulled out and finished on her.   He also said his wife was EXTREMELY pleased with the performance of this penis that he didn't know he had.  My friend says his penis is fairly aggravating normally.. The ultimate grower as it turns out.   Hangs like a squirrel on normal days,  to the point of discomfort sometimes and terribly embarrassing to see if anyone didn't know better, but grows to the high side of average for a typical hard-on...

I know, you're probably thinking, Chris is so gay! But I swear he's a great, Christian guy, and his parents are straight so he can't really be gay, right?

1364423229.0	1b50zf	MFWTK how to respond to a girl who suggested a super-expensive restaurant for a first date.	Kuhl_Bohnen	74	5	38	"So my buddy recently met a girl, and they've been exchanging texts.  They've had to postpone meeting up once, due to her irregular work hours, but they're all set to meet up next week.  In the course of their correspondence, she asked him if he had tried this sushi restaurant that generally costs around $150-200/person.

So there's two parts to this: He's not sure what this might indicate about the girl in general, and he's not sure exactly how to artfully and diplomatically say, ""Hell no, I'm not rich, woman! Your suggestion is unreasonable!""

She is Japanese and not very Americanized, so we're not sure how this plays into her expectations of first date etiquette.  Maybe she isn't automatically expecting him to pay for everything?  Who knows?  He also hasn't gotten any indication yet that she's a ""gold-digger"" or that she thinks he's loaded, or anything like that, but he also doesn't really know her all THAT well yet.

What do you all think?  Is this a red flag?

4/4 UPDATE:
So my friend replied to the girl saying he already had a place in mind.  Still a sushi joint, but not a super fancy one.  Girl responds by saying she actually needs to postpone again, and that was the last he heard from her.  I think he dodged a bullet here...  Thanks for all the advice, folks!  Good stuff to keep in mind in here!"	t5_2vj9t	True

Recently he has noticed a complete lack of emotion, I think i'll just start giving examples. His mom is dying of cancer (she kicked him out of the house 3 years ago and they haven't spoken since) and he does not care. His best friend is a girl who has very similar family problems, and they had begun making out drunkenly, and then having sex drunkenly and then soberly doing both. He really wanted a relationship with her, but she was concerned about losing what she considered to be her most valuable friendship, and wanted to take things slowly, while at first he was heartbroken, he noticed that after a week or two it just didn't bother him. She normally slept in his bed with him every night, and in the small dorm room beds he had, this meant sleeping in a very intimate way. This used to make him smile ear to ear and make him feel 'warm' emotionally, but now there's nothing. When she used to kiss him all of his focus was on her, but now he feels too apathetic to even try.

His grades haven't suffered, but his motivation for everything seems to have vanished. While he used to motivate himself to study and do work by a lust for knowledge, but now it seems like he's just going through the motions.

He used to suffer from severe depression, and says that this doesn't feel even remotely similar so he doesn't know what to think. Does anyone have advise for my friend?"	t5_2vj9t	True

1375140096.0	1jb7nv	My friend wants to know...what happens if an employer overpays them for a total of about 2000$ extra over the period of 3 months...and they only just noticed.	LOOK_AT_MY_ALL_CAPS	55	9	25	"So...what happend is this. 

My friend is working a helpdesk in a student position. They've been working there for almost 3 years. The summer time is weird...because instead of hourly they pay you a set salary per month...but they deduct time NOT worked...rather than adding up what time you worked.

The catch is he is taking summer classes on afternoons about 3 days a week. So they are paying him for about 40 hours by default (at about 15$/hr)...but he is really only working about 30.

At the beginning of the summer he outlined exactly how many hours he was going to be working every month and gave that to his boss.

However they are in the middle of migrating everyone to VDI and windows 7...and they're also in the middle of negotiations to get a brand new billing and work management system to be implimented company wide and replace the current backend...so they've been really busy, and I think that it has slipped people's minds.

So my friend thought they had it set up that they didn't get any income tax taken off...because they are a student and they only make about 14,000 a year. So he would be getting it all back anyways. Anyways...he just checked his pay stub for the first time this summer (it's online and he was really busy with 2 difficult summer classes)...and not only have they been taking about 600$ off every paycheck...but the amount they have overpayed him is about 2000$ dollars in total (ballpark figure)

He's a broke college student that has no extra money to spare. He's paying his way through university by working in the summer to pay tuition.


How does he not fuck himself over. He doesn't want to be a thief. They WILL find out when it comes time to give him his vacation pay at the end of the summer....but he cannot afford to pay the money back AND pay for tuition...as the money was ""eaten"" by taxes...so he won't see that money until January.

Even though it is their mistake...he feels responsible for not watching his budget closer. And mind you...this is in a casual position, and this job is otherwise paying his way through school. Don't want to bite the hand that feeds you.


edit: He also found the original email that he sent to his boss with the summer hours detailed in them, as well as an email that he sent out with his complete and full summer schedule that he set up as a shared calander in outlook.

edit 2: he is also canadian...so applicable laws and all that jazz.


edit 3: They're going to take it all off his next paycheck ...ouch. He's basically got to save half of this paycheck and them pay himself next month...but at least it's resolved."	t5_2vj9t	True

In the past, she didnt negotiate very well out of desperation to find any form of employment that wasnt menial, and the shitty job market.

Now, however, she feels she has a bit more leverage and doesnt have to settle for the first sum her prospective employers throw at her...

1) When is the best time to bring up compensation?

2) How do you negotiate it to your advantage?

3) She has a hard time determining what Qs are appropriate to ask, and when, can anybody shed light on  this for her?

4) She wants to know how to say ""No, thats not enough"" in a way that isnt rude or aggressive, or wont end her chances of landing the job

5) She would also like to know any general advice, or tips and tricks that one can use to their advantage.

One was something along the lines of public intoxication, or drinking in public because he was stupid enough to drink on the streets..($300 i believe, this was in Boston)

The other was not so much a fine as unpaid dues... his POS bank BoA's records indicate that he owed them $400, for a number of overdrafts (never loans or credit or anythign like that)

Anyways, he left the country a few months after the first incident and never got around to paying what he was supposed to. This was almost three years ago.By the way, he is a US citizen

He was just wondering
a) what would happen upon his return to the U.S

b) How this would affect his job-hunt in the U.S, if at all

c) What, if anything, he can/should do to remedy the situation, given that he resides abroad.

No major damage, just some scratches on one car and a small dent by the passenger front door on the other. With both of them being in a rush, my friend gave her his AAA info instead of his insurance info. Honest mistake. Neighbor calls AAA, accomplishes nothing, so goes to my friend's house while he isn't home and talks to his girlfriend. 

Apparently, her side of the story is that I ""plowed into her car"" and ""smashed it"" while she was parked. If she was really parked, A) this would not have happened, and B) she would have been parked illegally on the wrong side of the road. My friend will be giving her correct insurance info later today, as well as calling his insurance company BEFORE she does to explain his side of things.

Also, neighbor rang friend's doorbell at 6:45 in the morning, waking up the whole house. He missed her as he was taking his morning piss, but left a note with his phone number explaining that he would be by later tonight to talk.

She found out a couple days ago and was crushed. He cheated a month ago while out of town. 

When he came back they fought all weekend long. Then he was completely withdrawn and asking for space and pushing her away. Which she knew was off and tried to hold on tighter. She read his e-mail about two weeks ago. She felt bad about reading the e-mail and told him and apologized. Then he let her know that the relationship probably wasn't going to work and that he need for space/ a break. 

After all of that she found out about him cheating, the boyfriend seemed remorseful and wanting to change. He let her know he really loved her and was wanting this to work out. Letting her know she didn't deserve this and would make it better. 

However, this morning she started talking about wanting to spend time together and needing to feel loved. He freaked and said he needed space. He completely freaked out and yelled and went on about how angry he is and how now his feelings are being ignored. She now finds her begging for time. Which hurts even more and feels more lonely. 

**Is he just turning is guilt into anger?**

**Should he even be asking for space right now?** 

**Should the need for space be put on hold to help her right now?**

The question is should the problems he was creating be put on hold to deal with this big amount of hurt right now. *The question is not if she should break up with him. Which is what everyone will say!*

1365185873.0	1bqy3p	MFWTK how to score some weed when he's socially awkward and has little/no connections.	6574839201	22	2	25	"Yeah, so, my *friend* is a socially awkward motherfucker and he has no idea how to go about this.  He has very few friends, and they're all 100% undoubtedly non-smokers and are all acting like douche-bags right now, anyway - well except for me, I'm pretty awesome, but I digress.  He has a job, but his immediate colleagues are mostly old and obviously don't smoke, and he doesn't really talk to anyone else at his place of work.  He has a girlfriend who can't smoke because she's looking for jobs ATM, and she doesn't really know many people, either.  His other friends ""don't do that stuff,"" so he's left on his own here.  

He managed to score some weed two years ago in what seems like a stroke of luck, when a friend of a friend (who he's no longer in contact with) got in touch with a dealer through her own connections (she was kind of slutty so she ""knew"" a lot of people).  Being new to the whole buyer/dealer relationship, he didn't get the guys number, but through an incredibly awkward exchange that involved finding him on Facebook and getting his number from there, did actually manage to get ahold of him again and buy some more.  However, once the guy had his number he felt uncomfortable as the guy would keep texting him asking him if ""he was good,"" and telling him about his supply for April 20th. I guess he had sort of a mailing list thing going on with all his contacts. My friend was afraid that someone else might see his phone messages and get him in trouble, and he just didn't like his dealer contacting him like that.  When my *friend* didn't answer because he  was considering getting clean to possibly look for a job, he never heard anything from the dealer again.  When he did finally work up the courage to call him a couple of months later, his number had been disconnected.  However, he knows the guy didn't get pinched because they're still ""friends"" on Facebook, and he can see his updates.  He doesn't really want to get in touch with that guy again, and he's pretty sure the dealer won't remember him anyway because they only met twice two years ago and he appeared to be blazed out of his mind both times.  However, he did supply my friend with some pretty dank master kush, so my friend does realize that this guy has some quality goods.  

He came very close over the summer when the boyfriend of the same friend from before tried contacting a dealer, but he didn't answer.  This person for some reason knows a lot of people who know drug dealers, however she doesn't smoke herself.  My friend doesn't talk to her much anymore because now she's dating a married man who is kind of douchey, and she's been acting pretty stuck up herself lately, so fuck her!  ..so says my friend.

Currently, my friend likes to drink every once in a while, but he gets a bit disheartened because he gets sick very easily from alcohol.  He pretty much refuses to drink unless it's a couple of hours before he intends to go to sleep, so that he can immediately sleep it off which still sometimes results in a slight hangover.  He likes how weed doesn't make him feel nauseous, and he also finds the act of smoking relaxing but doesn't want to smoke cigarettes because they taste nasty and he doesn't want to get addicted.  He feels that he doesn't have an addictive personality for things like alcohol or weed, so he feels more comfortable with the ganja.  He said that weed gives him an ""afterglow"" where, even when he's not high, he feels more motivation to do things with his life, where otherwise he suffers from a lack of motivation and alcohol has no such effect.  He said that he re-applied for college while he was smoking and felt inspired, but now he's back to feeling lost and wondering what he's doing with his life.  He's constantly overthinking and over analyzing everything, and he feels that smoking helps him calm down and see things in perspective.  He has a pipe just sitting in his drawer, that he bought back when he first started smoking that has been sitting there unused for two years now.  He's really itching to get back into things, but has no idea where to start.

So, any help for my friend?"	t5_2vj9t	True

They made out again a few weeks after that, and she stayed over at his after only coming over to give him back his VIP card for a nightclub. He told me that she said ""I should go"" then proceeded to stay and cuddle him on the couch and subsequently his bed.

He is currently in a long-distance relationship and this anxiety is particularly bad for this, considering whenever his girlfriend doesn't respond for a while, or doesn't show up when she usually does, he just starts panicking and it's hard for him to get control of himself. He just wants to find a way to make it go away, or at least significantly lessen it. He knows it will be a gradual thing, but he needs to know where to start first. Any help for him would be appreciated.	t5_2vj9t	True

The issue is that he's working with people from all over the world in his office with only one being native English speaker, so it's not really easy to improve his accent by just talking with his colleagues. Some of their accents are even worse than his, so he sometimes tends to forget to make efforts with the right pronunciation...

He's willing to make efforts and invest time on it, but can't think of a good approach to start with.

He doesn't think that it would look good to say that he dropped out of high school and wants to try to find a way around it. 

If he were to say that he graduated from a school where someone with the same name graduated from, would this work? Is this any kind of fraud or identity theft? How much checking do employers do on people's education history, anyways? Do they do it at all? Could he get away with just fabricating his high school graduation altogether? Also, I think that home-schooled kids have some kind of test which gives them a diploma or an equivalency or something, could he say that he was home-schooled and get away with it?

Now after he has any kind of sexual activity, he gets the tremendous neck pain. What can he do?

**UPDATE** She went to the interview and essentially aced it. She had notes ready and everything, wore professional clothing and she thinks she left a pretty good impression. The only problems now is that one of her references didn't call back within the weekend they were going to be contacted, so  it took her an extra three days to get another contact (they wanted 3). She sent an e-mail to the boss and they haven't contacted her back.. Should she follow up with a call and ask if they have received the e-mail/seen it? It's been nearly a week since she sent it off. She also attended a funeral a day before getting the contact so it's been pretty rough the past week.

**UPDATE 2** she didn't get the job.. She decided to do a follow up e-mail and got a call immediately back. The boss told her that the position was already filled due to them needing someone very soon, but said to call back in 2-3 weeks because they have some positions open in that time or in a couple of months..

1365731454.0	1c6fpf	My friend wants to know if she should accept this job.	helpasisteroutbro	4	1	3	"My friend wants to know if you think she should accept her first salary job that pays 48k per year. While 48k in it of itself is a relatively nice chunk of change, she is hesitant because of a number of reasons.
Firstly, this would not be her first job, but rather her first salary job. They are offering her the job because her previous work history consists of many different odd jobs that build up to the requirements of this job. The reason she is hesitant is because these odd jobs lead up to the potential of becoming a union member of said odd jobs, which would pay 55k minimum on the ultra low end or 78k-90k in the more realistic range. Note that these are not salary either, just the equivalent pay if it were salary. Benefits and all would be provided by the union so no difference there.
Another issue is that the salary job offer, when comparing the salary based on the title being given, other companies are offering much much more... something in the 90k range... however, it should be noted that these comparisons are only in job title as the companies offering this job title is not a direct competitor. Is it reasonable to compare the salary of say... a marketing manager at a marketing firm vs one at a company that has a dedicated marketing department? On one hand, they're completely different in that one deals with clientele who outsource their marketing to them while the other deals with only one company, however on the other hand, they have the same job title and functionally do the same thing. Perhaps the marketing manager at the firm deal with more complicated systems considering that they need the ability to have a wider range of functionality, but ultimately the job is the same and the approach to the job is the same.
My friend just doesnt want to walk into the job already resenting the company because she felt cheated or taken advantage of. That's a very bad mental environment for her to work in... and frankly for everyone else as well. She has already expressed her willingness to give it her all and work crazy OT hours if absolutely necessary even though salary doesnt pay OT. She feels that that kind of dedication would be a valuable asset for a company that deals with constant deadlines. She doesn't have a social life so she's cool with it, but she feels she should be adequately compensated for such a commitment. Her mentality is though that the amount she's willing to give to the company is at a higher value. She's willing to work at the 48k range but not at full capacity... only at 48k worth of capacity.
On the opposite end of it though, she is relatively in need of a job. Her odd jobs have been drying up slowly so the idea of having something stable is comforting.
So what do you guys think she should do? Should she counter and risk losing the opportunity? Should she outright reject because she's headed for a miserable life if she feels she got the shit end of the stick? Should she accept and just suck it up?
Perhaps a comparison into your current or past situations would bring light and fuel her to take action."	t5_2vj9t	True

The others take about a few days to get out of his mind, but this one has taken two weeks. It is really bothering him, and he really likes her personality. 

He has been on one date with her, later he was hanging out in her room for an hour or so just talking and she asked if he was looking for a girl because she had a friend who is really similar to my friend's personality (but she really wants someone else, so that is not an option for my friend). Then my friend said that he was already looking for another girl who was awesome, smart, and really kind. She (the original girl) asked who it was, and my friend said it was her.

She said something along the lines of I don't think you can handle my bitchiness. My friend just left it alone because it sounds like it is just a BS excuse for not wanting to be with my friend (either now or ever).

Should he just keep them around, for those terrible sick days, hangovers, and sports injuries? Should he attempt to sell them?
Is there some place to forfeit them? Should he throw them in the trash?

He says there's basically no chance he'll get addicted or something. Like, he says he'll prob just throw them in a drawer and forget, and maybe find them in like a year. I'm just worried because they're controlled substances, and I don't want him to get in any trouble. Or, if it's not super risky, could he make a bunch of money?

I have another friend who's a recovering painkiller addict, who's told me that he would pay like $80 per pill of oxycodone, or some exhorbitant amount. I don't want to hit up that guy to help move these, because just him being around that world might be enabling.

Zoom to last night and she and her best friend are all over friend 2, so he's like see sweet threesome, not thinking of first friend at all. walking back to our house friend 1 fucks off and leaves the women and friend 2 alone, eventually they move to his room, he tries it on with friend 1's girl but just plays a bit then has sex with her best mate instead while she passes out. 

Friend 1 walks into his room middle of the night calls him a cunt and disappears, friend 2 follows tries to calm and explain but cant get through turns our friend 1 really wanted to get with her and feels betrayed. Woke up this morning and the entire house hates friend 2 and he can't think of anyway to make it better knowing he fucked up. Friend 1 wont even listen to the truth calling it lies constantly.
