I have a mountain of bike parts that are unused/out of date/broken so I melted down a few rims, a handlebar, a stem, and some old chain rings and cast them into ingots as an intermediate step to casting them into actual useful shapes.

a) Can I get rings made out of the hardened steel I have?

The diameter of the hole is 6 mm, the radius is around 12-13mm and its center is the same of the hole's.
The aluminum rod is 20mm wide and 3 mm thick.

I have a router like [this](http://www.blackanddecker.co.za/powertools/productdetails/catno/KW900E/).

I thought I will make a router table, and use it for that too.

Is that machine is able to mill aluminum with a proper cutting tool?

It was the first attempt with the cheap wood bit. The result was better than expected.

The rig is half done (and quite getto), fixed with clamps, etc, but I wanted to try it, so I just made a simple holder : [rig1](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4221854/_temp/20120512_1933_alu_rig.jpg) [rig2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4221854/_temp/20120512_1934_alu_rig.jpg) [rig3](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4221854/_temp/20120512_1935_alu_rig.jpg)

The final version will have a small plate with the pin what I can move on the table. Maybe that plate will be metal.

I'm specifically interested in what types of foam can be used when filling a mold for the foam pattern. In my research I keep seeing expanded polystyrene (EPS) come up as the foam used in the filling of a pattern mold. Through the the use of venting steam into the mold, the EPS expands filling the mold. The foam part is then removed and all that's left is to glue your gating system on and cast.

I am wondering if there are other foams besides EPS that can be put into a pattern mold, that will then expand to fill out the rest of the mold, while at the same time be suitable for casting using the lost foam process.

I'm a bit of a novice, so if I did a poor job explaining anything let me know. I can provide more details if needed."	t5_2qkuc	True

They have a very interesting look to them because we have left the mill scale on them.  We are hoping to keep this look.  We don't want to sand or grind to create a consistent texture.  We would like to have a matte-ish coating that can hold up to a lot of touching, that also won't wear off on all the architectural paper type things.  Basically, we just need to keep them from rusting with as little change as possible to the current character of the steel.

Another thing to note, the desks are fixed where they are.  So heating up the whole thing or taking it to an automotive shop is pretty out of the question.  

So far in my research I have come across recommendations for everything from linseed oil to polyurethane to parafin and  beeswax.  We are fine with reapplying periodically if it's a wax type finish.  And in an ideal world, we'd like for it to be eco-friendly.

Its current condition is actually pretty good.  It's got that bit of light surface rust.  It is cast iron as far as i can tell.  Everything functions properly, and nothing needs welding or any major repairs.

My goal is to remove that rust, and get it 'protected' so it can sit outdoors again for a few more years before I have to re-protect it.

my current plan is to de-rust it by covering it in vinegar soaked rags and taking a hand held scrub brush to it afterwards.  That is what i do for a lot of my other small metal projects, but I'm not sure it's appropriate (or simple and easy) for this.  If i go with a wire brush on a drill (that's what i got, i don't have a grinder or anything), would that cause any unrepairable scratches or anything?

Once it's de-rusted, what are my options for protecting it?  I wasn't, at first, too keen on painting it, but I've gotten more into that idea since I stumbled on the idea of painting my army crest or some such logo on there.  if i don't go with paint, what can i use?  if i do go with paint, should i know anything ahead of time?

Here is where I'm at so far: http://i.imgur.com/sDs2ZZL.png

The upper horizontal is a 96"" 3x1.5x.125 steel tube, which is probably overkill but I want to build and test before I make a version that's weaker. It has horizontal holes near the ends which get bolted to plates, which also bolt to the uprights.

The uprights are 1.5x1.5x.1 and 2x2x.1 steel tube, nested. The inner one (which is taller and colts to those upper plates) has a horizontal hole every 4"" and the outer one every 5"", so with two pins I can adjust the height in 1"" increments. The outer tube is welded to a horizontal plate at the bottom, which has two bolt holes in it to connect it to the legs.

The legs are 2x2x.1 tube oriented horizontally with an adjustable foot screwed in vertically at each end.

The legs are also attached to the outer upright by two diagonal tension supports. Those might be cables but this drawing has them as conduit with flattened ends (I'm familiar with that style of assembly from making geodesic domes).

Stores sell carbon fiber in sheets, and it would be a nice support to really smoosh the PCB down to a heat sink that it is attached to. Drilling screw holes is easy enough, and proven...  The problem is that all of the electronics would get in the way, I'd need to either make full cut outs (and expose the high voltage components) or mill troughs to accommodate them. 

Has anyone milled a trough into carbon fiber sheets? What is the finish like after, I assume it is pretty sloppy once a milling bit tears the hell out of it. I don't mean raw fiber I'm talking about dried resin impregnated stuff. 

This is pretty unimportant in the long run since the PCB is purely a prototype, but it's always fun to put this level of fit &amp; finish on a personal project. TIA!

http://i.imgur.com/DFhCs.jpg

It is the upper end of the OTA (optical tube assembly) of a home-made telescope. The OTA is made of Sonotube - thick cardboard tubes used in the construction industry to pour concrete cylinders. It's surprisingly stiff, especially if you soak it in epoxy or polyurethane on both sides.

To protect the tube end against denting, the owner made a tube ring from an aluminum band. Since it's pretty thin, it was easy to bend and shape it around the Sonotube.

I want to do the same for my scope, except I made the OTA from aluminum. And I want to make the tube ring from a much more thick aluminum band - maybe 3 mm (1/8"") thick or so (the one in the picture is half that thickness). Maybe even thicker.

My question is - how to shape that thick chunk of aluminum into a perfect circle to match the OTA? The forces required to bend it are too much to use the OTA itself as a template. Also, it may be tricky to put a smooth curve on it - it may have the tendency to bend sharply.

Any suggestions?

I saw some gold and silver inlays done in ceremonial tibetan spear head. It was really quite beautiful. I'll try and get some pictures so you can see what I'm talking about. 

So I'm wondering how I could do something similarly. I obviously can't afford gold or silver, but how well would brass work? 

Could I carve out a groove in the design I want and simply hammer in a brass wire into the groove? 

How effectively would it stay in affixed in the steel?  

I would think of using a dremel to carve out the design, but are there any other tools that would work as well or better?

Would you imagine brass as the best option for an inlay that would last, or could you suggest a better metal?

Would annealing the steel piece be a good idea before working on it?

Back to the Dremel idea, what kind of bits would you suggest for engraving work? And for simple metal work as well?

Thanks.

When I picked it up, I noticed that the guard had been taken off, which seemed...odd.

The guy who pointed me at the angle grinder said something to the effect of ""Hey, that disk is about done, there are new ones over there""...which seemed odd, because the disk looked about the same as a new disk on the grinder in my shop.

I was grinding a bit, and he says a few more times about the new disks.

So I grabbed one of the ""new"" MUCH LARGER (probably 8"") wheels.  I trashed one of them (oops), and when I went to grab another one, I noticed that they were rated for 8500RPM.

The grinder I had was rated at 11,000 RPM.

This seemed pretty sketchy to me...and I didn't feel like a hospital trip, so I headed over to ace and grabbed some 4 1/2"" in disks (with proper RPM ratings) to work with.

Is this a case of manufacturers derating the tools?  (Saying that it can only handle 8500 rpm, but it can really handle twice that).

Since I am around thoroughbred racehorses, the shoes are mostly aluminum with only the [toe-grabs](https://www.thorobredinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wedge-front1.jpg) being made of steel. They are also just tossed aside by most people, so in the months I was working at the track, I have at least a hundred or so of them.  We mostly clean them up, spray paint them silver, and give them to the kids who visit our farm(I'm a bit of a hoarder, so whenever I see any thrown out shoes, I pick them up, just in case).

Since I am out of a job, I was thinking about melting down the shoes I will not need, and selling the melted aluminum for scrap(I was told that if I tried to sell the horseshoes whole, the metal toe grabs would make it considered ""dirty aluminum"").  I have a cast iron dutch oven that I bought years ago, but never used, so I figured that would make a good pot to melt in.

So what kind of torch or heat source could I get that would heat the oven up to melt the aluminum?  To get rid of the toe grabs, I imagine I would simply need to hold the toe grab with a pair of vice grips or similar, and dunk the horseshoe into the already melted shoes and that would cause the aluminum that holds the grabs in to melt away.  

Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: I weighed some shoes and also some toe grabs that I found left in my fire pit after I threw some horseshoes in(the fire melted them, but in no controlled way.  The way they are cast, there is no easy way to remove the toe grabs without grinding/cutting them out).  The shoes are about 3+oz each and the steel toe grabs weigh about ~0.40 oz each, so I would need about 6-7 shoes to make a pound of aluminum.  "	t5_2qkuc	True

I've been following /r/metalworking for a while, and machining my own parts has been one of the unexpected joys of graduate school. I need some metal parts that I'm having a hell of a time finding and I'm hoping that you guys might be able to help.

The problem with doing academic research is that I typically need small batches, which can be hard to acquire. 

The first thing I'm looking for is aluminum machine screws. Specifically 6-32 x 1/4 or 6-32 x 1/2 (as long as they are longer than a 1/4 inch, I really don't care). Any head style as long as the head is flat on the underside. I work in ultra high vacuum, so that means that I need a low zinc alloy, so 7075 is out. 2024 looks promising, but the best I've been able to do is to have a supplier tell me I need to order 50,000 minimum.

The other thing I'm searching for is 2 sintered copper plates. Roughly 8 cm x 8 cm x 1 cm. Material requirements are a lot less stringent for this, though it needs to be an open celled material and smaller pores are better (I only need it to pass air).

The first problem is the motor spins 2x as fast, in the wrong direction, and is non-reversible. I'm probably going to make a friction wheel drive, or mount the motor upside down (either would also use the existing belt and pulley setup) to compensate for this. 

I figured this would also be a good time to try setting this up for light milling work. The Jacobs chuck has a taper to it, which will pull loose during milling. I'm thinking about drilling a hole through the column to put a pin through the chuck to keep this from happening, but I'm not sure it that will work since it is enclosed in the (non-rotating) support column (maybe a threaded insert instead?)

Other: I also plan on ordering an XY table to mount to the existing table, and attached an old car scissor-jack for Z travel. Possibly attaching digital calipers to the 3 axes for measurements. Structural reinforcement if needed.

Thoughts? Ideas? Additional problems? Solutions? I'm trying to keep this project kinda cheap (hopefully &lt;$100) because obviously if I had more money I'd just buy a mini-mill.

From what I can tell, cemented tungsten carbide seems to be the best bet for this. Unfortunately, I haven't had much luck in terms of figuring out how to make actual parts. It seems to me that cemented carbide is made by mixing up powdered carbide (in this case tungsten) with powdered cobalt, and heating it to the melting point of cobalt. The cobalt acts as a glue which holds together all the carbide particles. Now, unfortunately, things are never this simple. So, some questions:

* Does this need to be done under inert atmosphere? 
* I'm assuming Co-WC can be cast in the first place, is that true?
* Cobalt melts at 1500 C, do I need special materials (e.g. plasters, crucibles) for these temperatures?
* Is there any sort of heat treatment that needs to be done to anneal the part?
* Is there anything else I should know that I'm overlooking?

If you can't tell, I'm rather new to metalwork, but I am eager to learn! I am a very cautious person, and I have worked with potentially dangerous situations before (chemistry) so I understand the need to take the hazards of working with metals at high temeperatures seriously, and to respect them. Anyway, if anyone here has any experience with this stuff, please let me know!

EDIT: Just to be clear: the Co-WC goes inside a steel vessel. I didn't ask about steel because there's a lot of information on steel casting online. The reason why Co-WC needs to be used is that it functions as a pressure transmitter essentially. I need something which is brittle so I can exert a lot force without plastic deformation.

Ideally I want to convince them to stop using hot-rolled material.  But in the meantime, what can I do?  The fiber backed discs are aluminum oxide... would all of my problems be fixed if I moved to zirconia alumina discs?  I believe that muriatic acid strips mill scale... but lets skip that option.  I hope reddit has a sneaky answer for me!  THANKS!

Does anyone know of a website/retailer which sells custom-format small-scale metal lettering for mounting?

I'm looking for a 1/2-3/4 inch high, 1/2-3/4 inch wide metal letter in Garamond font, suitable for mounting.

I've done my best with Google, etc. Most websites can provide the right font, but stop at 1 inch size. The letter is going to be mounted on the front of a walking stick, so the size isn't too flexible (1 inch high would be fine, for example, but 1 inch wide is too wide).

Alternatively, does anyone have any tips on how I could buy a letter that was slightly too wide and curve it to the contours of the stick so that width wasn't a problem?

What I was thinking so far is to use thin strips and fold them over the edge. Inlays being held in place by tucking them under the edging. The two problems I see with this is:

* Inlays would have to always go to the edge of the card.

* I hardly know anything about metalworking and have no clue how to get clean, precise curves.

It's not a precision part; as long as I can get somewhat close to the original specs, it'll work just fine. How would *you* make something like this?

It isn't something I use regularly, but whenever I can find a use for it I try to turn things on this amazing Hardinge lathe in a shop I have access to. I am absolutely in love with this machine. I feel like whoever designed this thing decades ago had worked on tons of frustrating machines and decided to design a machine with everything exactly in the right place. I don't even regularly use it and I find myself intuitively reaching for knobs and levers I need almost without looking while I keep an eye on the work and the spinning bits. 

So my question is this: do any of you more experienced workers ever find yourself almost hypnotized by the work/machine? In other words, when things are going smoothly--like turning some easily machinable aluminum--you find yourself sort of ""out"" of it because it is so smooth? I am not a full time machinist, but if the power feed is on, and a long chip is streaming off a piece of dull aluminum that is suddenly shiny I almost have to shake myself out of it to make sure I don't drive the tool into the chuck...and I totally realize that this is not particularly safe. Since I am not doing the most precise work, I will turn off the power feed early and do things manually.

From my understanding, when a piece of steel is quenched after it is brought to red heat, the carbon (gas? or what?) is trapped in between the iron molecules (Individual atoms, or molecules?) and that makes it hard somehow.

Also, when a piece of steel is heated to straw heat (I honestly think someone needs to distinguish because the term straw heat makes me think of almost forge-welding heat, but in this case, I'm referring to the straw tint) and then letting it cool, then it will allow the iron to crystallize, which doesn't happen when quenching, as it cools too quickly. Furthermore, the carbon that is trapped during quenching is not allowed to escape.

I have access to a kiln that is capable of reaching the required temperatures (above 2000F), however the instructions for the device only mention caveats with working with glass and ceramics. Are there any concerns I should have if I use this to melt metals in a crucible? Basically, is it a horrible idea to use the kiln for this purpose?

Speaking of the crucible (I'm gonna go with graphite): I've read that it's recommended to have a separate crucible for each type of material to avoid contamination. Is this really that necessary? Don't the impurities either burn off or float to the top during the melting process anyway? If not, is there a way to clean the crucible of contaminants after it has cooled?

About the mold materials: I'm not sure what materials I should use. I'm going to be doing rather crude designs at first to get the hang of the process, but hope to progress to much finer details.

Newbie to grinding, have brought myself a powered grinder with course wheel and whetstone.

The whetstone rotates away from me, so the rotation forces a cut away from the edge.

I don't know if this is ideal, or just the way that it panned out.

But, drill bits can be held so that either wheel grinds towards or away from the edge - is there a preference?

I have a question about a  ring with moving parts.	ringaway	10	3	13	"**TL;DR - can a spinning fidget ring realistically last a while without breaking, and also where could I get a custom-made (and cheaper) puzzle ring similar to [this one](http://www.krikawa.com/jewelry/body-of-work/details.aspx?style=118)?**

Sorry guys, I'm new here, so if this should be somewhere else please tell me. Also, throwaway for reasons that will become clear soon.

So. I want to get my boyfriend an engagement ring (I'm a girl). The plan is that he is going to propose to me, but when he does I want to have a surprise for him too :3

When we were scooting around jewelry stores, these sorts of [fidget rings](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2369469693_f9d7fcf78a.jpg) really caught his eye. The basic premise is that it's actually made up of two separate pieces, and the middle one spins. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAzK58r7G1A#t=11s) a video of it. They are gimmicky, I know, but I could *really* tell he thought they were neat. He's sort of an antsy guy, likes to have something to do with his hands when he's thinking; he's also very utilitarian, so I know that he thinks if he's gotta have a ring it might as well be sorta useful for something. I know he would love something like this.

So on to my question: Is it reasonable to expect that I could find a durable one one of these that would last as a wedding ring? Meaning wearing it every day, probably spinning it an inordinate amount of time, exposing it to the elements... etc. I know with the moving parts it's likely to wear out or dirt and stuff could get stuck in it, but I wanted someone's opinion who knows what they are doing. 

Could I theoretically find one in a jewelry store, or even commission a jeweler or a metalworker or something to make me one, and expect it to last more than a few years? What do you think my chances are? They're also rather hard to find, so that one fails, I was thinking about an option two:

A puzzle ring. You know the kind, right? They're made of many rings and you have to put them together to wear them. Have a picture [before](http://www.langantiques.com/university/images/thumb/4/42/Puzzle_ring_1.jpg/300px-Puzzle_ring_1.jpg) and [after](http://www.langantiques.com/university/images/thumb/5/54/Puzzle_ring_solved.jpg/300px-Puzzle_ring_solved.jpg). The only problem with these is that the traditional ones made out of many rings look way too girly, and I know he would not like them at all. I did fine [this gorgeous one] (http://www.krikawa.com/jewelry/body-of-work/details.aspx?style=118) that I know he would like, it's in a much better style, but it would cost over $1.5k. Really? Yikes! That's probably as much as he's going to spend on my ring, and I'm not even out of college so that's completely not an option for me. I was hoping something along the lines of non-precious metals, no more than $500. 

So if I'm going the route of the puzzle ring, do you know who I could approach someone to make me a similar one? do jewelers do that without charging an arm and a leg? 

Sorry, I know this is long, but I really don't know anything about this so whatever help you can give me is great!

1342501185.0	woq6w	I have a little question about a copper sculpture I'm going to make.	CaptainBruno	11	4	9	"Okay so I want to make a sculpture out of copper. Problem is, I've never worked with copper on a large scale before. I've made a little rose and a bird out of copper sheet and that's it.

I will put a picture so you guys/gals get an idea of what I want to make. I'll have a picture up within 8 hours.

But to get to my question. I want to give certain parts of the sculpture a oxidized patina, but other parts to remain shiny and clean. Is this possible? say I apply a patina in a line on a sheet of copper, and apply a coating sealer on it, will that stop or prevent the rust from spreading to the rest of the sheet?

And last question(I promise that's it!) How well would several pieces of copper sheet hold together with rivets?

Thanks a bunch.

EDIT: PICTURE!! http://i.imgur.com/3jwtq.jpg  So the piece is going to be a bust. I want the bust to be from the top of the shoulders up. What you see in the sketch is the top of the head which will be full scale. So my question is about the trickle of water which would have carried the oxidization down from the little copper roof you see on the tower.

As for the rivets. I plan to make a detailed bust and face out of the copper sheet. So how well would it hold together with just rivets? But I can always braze or weld it if need be."	t5_2qkuc	True

1328932693.0	pkd5n	Tool Help, Opinions on a Smithy Granite 3-in-1 for a Hobby Shop	projecthouse	7	1	22	"I've been wood working for over a decade now, but as I've gotten into making, my project have involved more and more metal.  Several projects on my to list will require a metal lathe and a mill to build.  The Smithy seems to be a good match for me, but like all 3 in 1, it has a lot of detractors.  I'm hoping Reddit can provide some insight.  My options are a 3 in 1 like the Granite 1324 and separate Chinese made bench top machines.  

- I'll explain why a Bridgeport is not an option.  Not only is space an issue, but my shop is in my basement.  I have no walk out access.  The tool will have to be carried down stairs and around a 180 degree corner.  It's simply not possible to get a 6' long lathe, or a 2000lbs knee mill down there.  Even getting the Smithy down there might require some dissemble and building a ramp down my stairs.  
- The biggest stand alone mill I could fit in my shop would be a Grizzly G0619.  Even then, the mill stand would also have to be on wheels and moved a lot.      
- I like buying used, but I don't want to buy a a 50 year old tool that requires work right away. I can't make repair parts until the mill and lathe are working.  
- It will be for hobby use only.  I'm not going to try to make any money with it.  
- I plan to do 1 project at a time, so I'm hoping I can do all my lathe work first, and then switch to the mill to minimize setup time.
- The granite has a 21 speed quick change gear box and a variable speed DC motor.  This seems to be a major benefit since the other hobby lathes in the class have at best a 9 speed gear box if any.  Since my parts will be one off, I imagine I'll be speeds and feed rates a lot.
- The granite has power feed, x and y, for both milling and lathe operations.  
- A milling attachment is available for some lathes like the Precision Matthews PM1127VF, but, as far as I know, there's no fine feed on the X (Long) axis.
- I'm worried about small importers like Precision Matthews, when he retires, where do I go for parts?   

As for projects, I'm hoping to work in aluminum most of the time, but I need the ability to do steel occasionally.  Taking small bites is fine.  Some projects I have in mind are a small 3 axis CNC router, a 2 axis remote control SLR camera mount, and parts for my wood working tools.

I'm looking at constructing my own (metal) bed frame and have already drawn up a plan using google sketchup. I'd like to move forward with my plan but before I do so I was wondering if I could get some advice on how best to join together the various pieces of my frame. 

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rsesv1q5xbrzjmb/bedframe.skp) is the google sketchup file for my bed frame. 

As you can see, there are 4 pieces: a 'footboard,' two side-rails, and a 'headboard.' I'm trying to figure out how to best join the side rails to the foot and headboards so that they maintain structural stability and don't end up collapsing. 

For what it's worth, I plan on making this frame out of 1/8th inch steel , powdercoated. 

In my current plan, I've extended two 'arms' on the side-rails to allow for bolt space. Would four bolts (two connecting to the headboard and two connecting to the footboard) per side rail be sufficient? 

let me know if you have any questions... I'd really appreciate any help with this endeavor!

We don't have bore gauges at work, so the next best thing is a telescoping gauge and a mic. I found that after multiple different readings the bore was .0005-.002"" over the upper limit, which means a re-bore (and another $150+ for a new piston and rings). Now, to get to the point... After bringing this up to a guy that's worked there for 35 years, he mentioned that the reading you get from a telescoping gauge depends on how tight you tighten the lock down, and should turn the thimble on your mic accordingly. I've heard him say this many times in the 7 years i've worked there, and have questioned it, but never really tried that technique until today. I measured the bore multiple times with different tensions on the tele gauge and it read exactly the same every time. I'm not one to believe someone based on the fact they've been doing it for a long time; I need visual evidence when it comes to situations like this. It's also hard to tell him he's straight-up wrong, when he's been doing it for so long.

1314189554.0	jssy6	New to the subreddit, question about arbor presses and coin rings. Advice?	MadeByMonkeys	5	1	13	"I'm trying to learn how to make coin rings with an arbor press and a set of ball bearings of increasing size.  I've read online that it's possible to drill a hole in the center of the coin and then press successively larger bearings through the hole, warping the coin into a ring shape before filing and finishing the ring.

Currently I'm using a steel ring sizing mandrel and a nylon hammer, and each ring takes hours and hours to create.  I know that I can work much faster with an arbor press but I'm not sure how to physically secure the bearing in the press so that it doesn't fire out laterally when pressure is applied. I'm also not quite certain if I need a particular sort or size of press.

I'm (obviously) just not very handy.  I've thought about using some sort of large nut to hold the bearing but whatever I use must not damage the coin and must still allow the bearing to pass through the drilled hole in each coin.

The reason I'm doing this is that my daughter is very ill, and my wife and I are in a lot of debt.  We have great insurance that covers all of her medically necessary treatments, but we're not giving her the comfort and quality of life that we could be if not for our debt.  For example, every few months my daughter will wake up immobilized by pain (she has daily moderate joint pain but sometimes it's very severe).  We want to fix up our front porch, which is falling down, and add a wheelchair ramp so that she won't be confined to the house on those days (which sometimes last a week).  Because we're paying double our minimum debt payments (to get out of debt in 4 years) we just can't afford this.

Anyway, I guess none of that is necessary to the request for instruction but there seems to be a lot of secrecy surrounding this process because those who know how to do it don't want competition.  I've recently re-discovered a medium-size coin collection that my Granddad left me.  I've already given all of the truly unique and/or valuable coins to my brother for safe keeping, and I'm planning to use the less unique/valuable coins in this process.  I've already made a number of charms and things from indian head pennies, V nickels, mercury dimes, and the like, but I've got a big stack of silver half dollars that are circulated and worn and only really worth their melt value that I'd like to make rings from in order to sell towards eliminating our debt so that Sarah can have a better life sooner than 4 years (which would be the remainder of her childhood, which I sincerely hope, but fear she may not, reach.)

I have no experience whatsoever.  What little I know about welding comes from reading on the internet.  Why do I want to learn to weld?  Welding, it seems to me, is a good trade to know should society collapse, or the Zombie Apocalypse happen.  ;-)  Aside from its industrial uses - the fact that if I knew how to weld I could build cool stuff for myself (like the adult-sized jungle-gym I have always wanted) - welding can also be a creative outlet; getting artsy with welding  seems cool to me, and I am a naturally creative man.  Also, if I knew how to weld, I am sure I could always find some sort of work to do somewhere, i.e., it's a marketable skill (cha-ching . . .$$$).  And extra cash flow every month is a good thing.

I have looked into welding programs at my local trade school.  It lasts about 1 year and leads to a national certification.  Is it necessary to go to the trade school, or can welding be learned on-the-job?  And do welders take apprentices?  Or, can I teach myself to weld via DIY manuals and tinkering at home?

I've recently got permission from chunky_bacon to work on getting some info up for everyone regarding metalworking, and some good resources.

I'd like to compile a list of questions that should go in the ""FAQ"" section, and any other information you think we should have.

What I have thought up to add:

* Welding Info

* Foundry/Metalcasting

* Heat Treating

* Basic Metals information, Information on alloys, and properties

* Links to good YouTube videos such as the Tubalcain series

* Conversion charts, and tables

What I need from you guys:

* List of ""FAQ's""

* Some questions YOU want answers to, maybe this will eventually morph into a weekly question thread. I will try to answer all questions given to me on the wiki, even if I have to research them.

* Some tips/tricks you have regarding anything metal/mechanical/welding/etc

* Some Youtube channels you think I should add

* Any resources you've found helpful that I can add to help others


About me:

I come from the electronics world, I primarily build electronic projects but I have a little shop, and have some really big mechanical ambitions.

My Mechanical/MechE related interests:

* Steam, Tubine, Pulsejet, and Internal Combustion Engines (Rcdon, crabfu steamworks, aardvark, powerlabs)

* Metal Casting, and All things fire (Burner Design, Insulations, etc) (Backyard metal casting)

* Alternative Energy, particularly hydrogen (otherpower, Maybe some motor design links?)

* Gears. I love gears for some reason, something so..fascinating about them.

* Induction Heating, I build a nice little induction heater that one day I will scale up into something bigger.

* Thermal Vapor Deposition

* Pump design

I like to take a mathematical approach, and have been designing a foundry I plan on building in preparation to make some lights.

I am also leading the reddit community flashlight project. I am working on this with project with four others to create a very low cost, and high performance flashlight which is build in the good ol' USA!

A few weeks ago I bought a Myford ML7 lathe, it's a nice machine [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/C112X.jpg) I had to re-wire the motor, the wiring was old rubber cased wire and just disintegrated when I moved the machine. I also had to buy a new motor capacitor but haven't received it yet, but runs fine so long as you give the chuck a bit of help starting (dangerous, I know, don't worry.) 

Anyway, I used it after re-wiring and it was fine, turned quite nicely, however, when I came back to it the following weekend, I couldn't turn a diameter without it chattering like crazy! [image](http://i.imgur.com/7D6By.jpg)

I don't know what's wrong, I've tried different tools, grinding my tool, supporting with a centre, and tried different materials. [Aluminium.](http://i.imgur.com/SDQxI.jpg) [Aluminium swarf.](http://i.imgur.com/Qalou.jpg) I have also tried adjusting the cross slide thrust and jibs, which improved the finish a little.. but still not great!

The strange thing is that it will turn a beautiful finish on the face of a part but cannot handle turning a diameter... it'll let me drill and ream too!

Any ideas? The spindle bearings have little or no play in them, registering not even .01mm on my DTI, so I doubt it's them, but I am prepared to be wrong."	t5_2qkuc	True

My previous shop had every sexy toy you could think of, and we had an amazing Kaltenbach cold saw that did anything we needed.  My new shop is limited both in what they possess and how much money they have.  

So my question is which saw do I go with?  Horizontal band saw or a cold saw?  We do not have $20k to spend on a saw so a nice Kaltenbach is out.  Also, I have never used a horizontal bandsaw so I'm not sure of the pros and cons.

We cut:

-80% steel and the occassional stainless, brass, aluminum
-With regularity cutting up to 1"" solid
-A lot of angle, up to 2""
-Tubing up to 2""
-It's custom work, and not much production.  At most 60 pieces or so of one dimension
-Our price range is around $3,000

Looking at the charts I see that for this to work I need a clearance hole of 33/64(.515) and a tap size of 27/64(.422). We didn't have a .515 drill bit so I went with a .5 instead, and found a tap in our set labelled 1/2-13. Problem is that this tap barely marked the inside of the hole, certainly not enough to have a useable thread. 

Clearly the clearance drill was too large, even after I went .5 instead of .515, but what I want to know is what clearance drill size should I use then if the chart isn't going to help?

I'll go ahead and link my full message describing the project to the Etsy craftsman below, but my main questions to you, reddit, are:  

* is this project doable within reason? Are the angles too difficult to execute?
   
* Would crafting a steel bar top as designed be very expensive? Should I resolve to use a wooden bar-top? What would you charge? 

* What information would be helpful to provide to the craftsman?  
 
* Any other thoughts that might not occur to me, being that I am unprofessional just trying to bring a concept to life?   


And finally- if there is any interest, any California metalworkers interested in discussing the project further, if the Etsy craftman does not come through?

Cheers all! And thanks in advance for anyone's comments :)  


&gt;Hello Lee,

&gt;I've done my best to articulate the design with the following diagrams- a few notes (I apologize in advance for inundating you with such a long message!)

&gt;Album: http://imgur.com/a/ckmIs

&gt;* The space we're planning to put the bar in is irregularly shaped, necessitating a parallelogram-shaped bar surface (and by extension, parallelogram-shaped features). The second image in the album shows the orientation of the room and surrounding furniture- as you can see, everything (including the wood floor panels) is aligned with the left wall, so the diagonal wall throws it all off. Hence the need to keep everything still in proper orientation! :) The sharper, right-hand side of the bar is not ideal...but I can't think of a better way to resolve the loose end. The right side of the bar enters the living room.  

&gt;* Because everything is so oddly shaped, although I would LOVE for the entire bar to be in steel, I'm thinking that the cost to cut and weld all of the parallelogram shapes would be prohibitively expensive (where wood would be simpler/comparatively inexpensive). If possible, could you provide a quote for a wooden bar top, as well as a steel bar top?  

&gt;* I was hoping for metal with a dark, somewhat matte patina- something dark, urban, and industrial. Our home has a fair number of items from Room and Board with their 1.5"" black steel legs (such as their Parsons desks)- so I'd love to keep loosely in theme. :)  

&gt;* The design was originally inspired by the first image in the album. We'd been meaning to have a custom table made, but changed our mind to a bar (it's a small space), and then to a bar with an awesome inset icebox/smokeless grill (more on that in a moment). The difference between our design and the one pictured in the first image, is a sleeker look- we don't want the icebox to sit atop the table, but rather to sit in a depression, on a lip. We could then have a cover crafted to sit flush with the bar top, when the boxes are not in use.  

&gt;* The bar would need a sheet of metal on the back to secure it to the wall (bolted in)-  this doesn't have to be as large as indicated, but for heat protection, I was thinking the sheet should be at least as deep as the boxes.  

&gt;* The inset boxes would primarily be used to hold ice, for chilled foods (raw bar) and drinks, but we were also hoping to make them functional as a sort of smokeless, yakitori grill. Lets say, about 2 inches from the bottom of the box, in each of the four corners, you were to affix a bead of metal, such that a grate could rest on the beads, and stand elevated 2 inches from the bottom of the box. We'd use this grate to hold smokeless charcoal, then use a second grate on the top to  grill small kebabs yakitori-style. (The bar would be up against enormous windows, so I am not concerned about ventilation)  

&gt;I think that covers it all- and well, this is the first time I've let the idea leave my brain, so it could be doomed to failure, unfortunately I know nothing about welding :( Our budget is pretty broad, but we are trying to avoid a huge expenditure because I doubt we'll be living in this apartment much longer than another 5 years or so.

1341868071.0	wah3l	I want to make copper rivets for my Roman Centurion armor. Where do I start?	erichhaubrich	6	2	6	"I was thinking about making a form out of scrap steel by drilling an 1/8"" hole about 1/2"" deep then putting 1/8"" copper rod into the form, snipping off most of the excess and forming the round head of the rivet by using a concave tool and a hammer. Once this is done I would put the rivet through the materials I'm joining and peen the head and use the same concave tool to make the round shape, or just flatten it, depending on the location of the rivet.

I want the rivets to be as authentic-looking as possible, so I don't want to use quick rivets or other similar modern-style rivets.

When tapping holes it's easy to tap crooked, especially in soft materials, so I took a piece of scrap stainless steel and made a ""foot"" for tapping.

I'd already made the foot before deciding to take a couple of pics or taping it, but [here's a couple of pics of the setup I used to make it](http://celotil.imgur.com/in_the_workshop#miCT8).

Take a piece of stainless steel, lock up everything on your drill press tight, and for a M12 tap drill a 11mm hole, then take out the drill bit and in its place put a Dead Centre so the tap is perfectly straight to start with - unless your drill press can do tapping, which ours can not. You get the idea.

Then if you've got 10 holes to tap or 100 (damn it), you can always keep them straight. I just use the foot to start the tap, but you can leave it there the whole time if you like. If the material you're tapping is a bit hard and the foot is just lifted up by the tap, use a pair of vice grips or small clamp to hold it down.

In no particular order:

1. Furnace design. It seems a lot of people are divided over coal vs propane. We only plan on casting ~3 lbs at once tops. My friend is leaning towards coal but I really like [this propane design](http://www.howtocastbronze.com/2012/02/constructing-cheap-and-efficient.html). I can't seem to source that refractory blanket in non-bulk though, and I'm concerned that a lot of what I've read says many propane torches can be quite weak.

2. Casting. We're just thinking plaster or sand methods, does anyone have any strong opinion?

3. Crucible tongs. Where can we get something sufficient without breaking the bank? We've sourced a crucible, [A2](http://www.budgetcastingsupply.com/Crucibles.php)

I have a google CR-48 chromebook.  For those of you who don't know, these ""prototype"" laptops were built poorly and google wont service them.  They have this ""hinge"" issue where the hinges break.  No parts are made for them, either.  

Mine had the hinges break.  Now, this is where it gets weird.  From all the stories I've read on these, it's the actual hinge that breaks (and to keep it from breaking, you just need to epoxy them).  I had the *same* issue but the *cause* was different.  

The way the laptop is built, the LCD screen sits on top of these two metal pieces. These metal pieces get screwed into the hinges, connecting the top half of the chromebook to the bottom (screen to keyboard).  I took mine apart to find that it was one of these metal pieces that actually broke.  Not the hinge.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/AS1Cm.jpg) is picture of the metal pieces I'm talking about. The one on the right is perfectly fine. The one on the left, however, the lower-right portion of it is bent up (which causes the chromebook to not open/close properly as it doesn't sit on the hinges).

Before anyone asks, I have looked for pieces on ebay and for broken models to use for parts but no one is breaking them OR they want $$$ for them!

Does anyone know of what sort of shop I could get a custom one made?  Cutting a new piece out of steel (or other metal) doesn't seem like it would be too difficult, but the bends/holes need to be precise.  I'd like to get it done in Seattle, WA and preferably not pay $$$.  I've tried getting ahold of a couple ""hackerspaces"" but none have gotten back to me.  Or, if anyone here could do it, I'd be happy to send them out to you/pay you for your work!

I can understand that he's modifying the tips of drillbits in order to cut better. Since I can't understand a word, I'm probably missing some inportant information there.

Some concerns arise. Doesn't this procedure take the temper off of the drill bits?

There's a part where he seems to speak about the proper angles and dimensions. I think that is the important part.

I know that in theory I should supply more air for more temperature but I'm not sure how this translates to a handheld torch.

Sliding the airvalve all the way to the left gives me a nice blue jet flame. Does this mean the airvalve is open completely?

Sliding the airvalve all the way to the right gives me a yellowish regular lighter flame. Does this mean the airvalve is closed completely?

Sliding the gas valve just seems to increase and decrease the size of the flame.

I think I could make these myself given plans, so if you have them, they would be appreciated.

A little background: Been welding for fun with a cheap MIG(it just does up to 1/4 inch) both flux and shielded, been soldering electronics and oxyacetylene for years. Built a tack welder with the old microwave transformer trick, building a plasma cutter soon. I'm not so much of a fan of stick because of how hard it is to keep the rod on target at that distance. TIG sometime in the future, when I have the money to make one(yeah, I know the difficulty but I'm mostly a coder and a partial electronics guy so it's just a step up to voltages capable of melding). TIG seems fairly interesting to me and much more controlled, plus a separate hand for the feed like I am used to in soldering.

So I have this insanely small really cool custom (modified) PC case: http://imgur.com/a/0ldrZ#4  I made the mistake of putting a cheap crappy fan on that cool looking power supply heat sink that functions as the side of the case. 

So in my haste to modify the power supply I ended up overdoing it a bit with the fan cutout, essentially, it looks like I hacked at it blindly with my good hand tied behind my back, stupid drill press.

In my pursuit of making a really nice OEM looking replacement I decided to make a [real PCB](http://i.imgur.com/xq9Gn.png) (that is an old rev) for the power supply, and to machine a nice replacement heat sink to be anodized. I started up emachineshop and modeled out the part. Then modeled it again, then again, then again. After a few days I got to the ""cheapest acceptable"" perimeters, but the damn thing is still majorly expensive. Here is a picture of the piece: 

http://i.imgur.com/n3B0A.png

It is 304mm x 56.6mm x 15mm, I could even skip the drill holes as I have the facilities to drill and tap all the screw holes that I need. 

So to the point: Is there anybody desperate enough to do a one-off cheaply, or how can I save money getting this thing milled? 

I know I can use those reef-tank LED heat sink anodizing services which start at $20 once all is said and done, or I can maybe get a bit of acid and anodize this myself. 

In fact, I may consider going so far as to just having a solid block with a heat sink thermal glued to it in some way/shape/form, I would still need to do the fan cutout but I think I can do a much better job on my own. I dunno, how would you folks go about it?

Thanks in advance for all the help!

He plans on putting some plant stuff (I'm assuming weed) in the pipe, and pouring liquid nitrogen through it, and having the endcap with screen catch the frozen plant.

So the problem is, what would be the best way to make this?  His original plan was wanting a screw-on endcap that had the screen installed.  But cutting threads in a 3-4 dia aluminum pipe would be a trifle bit impractical since my lathe head isn't that large, and I'd have to make a matching cap for it as well.

The best idea I could come up with was sticking the pipe end on an anvil and tapping an outward flare in it, and then simply fastening the screen over the end with plumbers clamp, the flare being so it doesn't simply fall off, especially when the pipe contracts from the temperature.

I was looking at the cheaper 140s and I feel like it’s worth spending a little more upfront to get something with the power and versatility to grow as I learn and grow.  Also my garage is wired for 120V right now but I like the idea of being able to do 240 in the future. But I would love to hear other opinions.

Second, I am currently renting, but I have talked to my landlord and she was really enthusiastic about creating a shop space in the garage, which is great. But I was wondering if there are any building or fire codes that I should be especially concerned about (I live in VT). And more generally if you guys think it is feasible to set up a small shop in an old wooden 1 car garage.

Third, I have a rough plan for ventilation but not sure what I really need.  I want to keep the garage door closed in the winter (It gets fucking cold up here) so I think it is really important to have some sort of exhaust.  My current plan was to buy a cheap inline blower [like this]( http://www.amazon.com/LEDwholesalers-GYO2402-6-Inch-Hydroponic-Booster/dp/B003YFADW8/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hi_6) , and get some of that flexible venting and hook one end up to a window and then create some sort of hood that I could position near the area I was going to weld and then just to flip it on, do the weld and turn it off (to conserve heat in the winter).

Finally I was thinking of buying some [fiberglass welding blankets]( http://www.harborfreight.com/welding/welding-accessories/8-ft-x-8-ft-fiberglass-welding-blanket-67701.html) to shield around the welding area.  I’m not really sure if that’s too little or too much as far as protection.

Also I’m obviously going to get all the other standard personal safety equipment.

Anyways, I would love to hear your input and additional things I should think about.  I hope this sort of post is ok in this sub. Thanks.

I mostly make jewelry, so I need to figure out a sand casting mixture that can pick up fine detail. I know this requires fine sand, but I'm having trouble figuring out a suitable clay. I know delft is the obvious, pro choice, but would love to hear other ideas, especially if they're cheaper since the price of delft is a little steep.

I know backyardmetalcasting.com suggests play sand and fire clay, but I can't figure out what kind of fire clay it is (he sells it for 27 a small bag, where as you can get 50 lbs of fire clay at home depot for 8 bucks, so what's the difference between these two non-descript fire clays?) and I'm not sure that mentod is fine enough for jewelry detail (he seems to be casting larger things.)

1356179332.0	15a0ua	Planning to make engagement ring. Hit a wall.	xylidylproject	1	0	1	"I want to make the engagement ring I'll give my SO and have settled on lost wax casting as it seems to be easier and i would be able to make more intricate designs with overall less tools and skill. I hoped to start with making a great many pieces in bronze then later some sterling silver and finally with gold for the engagement ring. Making the wax rings seems straight forward enough and i have few concerns about this step. 

As for making the cast, I've found investment plaster for bronze, silver and gold. I read from a few forums that the wax can be burned out using a home oven and the need to heat the cast above 900 F could be avoided by simply waiting several weeks for the water to leave the cast rather than using a kiln to remove it. As for removing the air when metal is poured in again i found forums saying a centrifuge wasn't necessary and that having a second or several holes was enough to let the air out as the metal falls in.  I would use a stainless steel flask for the cast as a precaution against it exploding on me and as far as safety goes i have a flame retardant lab coat and would use casting gloves, long pants and a face shield when handling the metal.

Now here's the wall. I was trying to find out how i would melt the metal and read that i can melt a couple of ounces of silver with a butane or propane torch, though i have also read elsewhere of people not being able to get it hot enough or heat it evenly which might crack the crucible. I have seen various professionals use oxy-acetylene torches but don't want to risk keeping a tank of oxygen in my home. I also considered furnaces which would evenly heat the crucible better than i could with a torch but am not sure if a professional furnace such as those on www.riogrande.com would be a reasonable investment as i can see that it could melt a large amount of bronze but am not sure it can get to the heat needed for gold and a 1Kg crucible for a couple of ounces of bronze seems excessive. I've seen various examples of people making their own furnaces on youtube for aluminum or steel and was hoping maybe i could make a small furnace and use a hair dryer and propane torch to get it evenly heated but again have no idea if this would work.

So i suppose i want to know just how can i melt the metal? Also will the plan so far work and is it even safe? I'm very keen on this idea and don't want to give it up easily.

TL DR: Want to make an engagement ring but can't figure out how to melt the metal.

One of my friends recently got a small (~1x1x.5 cm) cast jeweler's bronze pendant and wants to put an engraving on the back. However, it has a strange pattern inset into it (sort of like a honeycomb they said) that's probably about a millimeter or two deep. I don't cast metal so I don't know if it could be flattened on this side or if it's a lost cause.

Would, say, a jeweler or someone more experienced with this type of metal be able to either grind the design flat or fill in the holes or would it ruin the pendant to try?

I could use some advice on the smart way to do this.	wonderweirdo	1	0	0	When I was in high School, I went to a Vocational school called Prosser Vocational on Chicagos North side.  There I had the chance to work with machining and got lots of experience on lathes, drill presses, and milling machines.  We had just gotten in some CAD/CAM equipment and was given my first real work experience with computers.  I was pretty good at writing programs for the machines, but I was a bit more fascinated with the computers.  I gravitated towards jobs in the computer tech field and went to college majoring in computers.  I never finished my degree, I went to one of those for-profit colleges that was priced into another galaxy and dead ended when my student loans were maxed out.  I'm working a help desk now, but I'm not happy with it.  I realized the mistake I made and remembered the joy it brought me to be make something out of steel or aluminum on machines that were so well made they were being used during World War II.

  So I like to machine things as a hobby.  I taught myself on a Sherline mill and lathe set (""The Peter Dinklage of Shop Tools"") that was kicking around work, and have been saving for a more substantial setup for my home shop for a while.  My budget is around $5000, and I figure I can get a bench-top mill, lathe, and basic tooling set with that. I can't get anything larger, since anything I use must be carried down a narrow basement staircase and around a tight corner.

I was looking at the Smithy line of products, but rumblings on the web say that they are no longer made in the USA and the quality has waned.  They make a big deal out of their 3-in-1 products, but every single opinion I've heard about the whole design concept is that it is inferior to a standalone mill and lathe.  

Industrial Hobbies seems to have a good mill, but they don't publish prices and the website seems to lay on the hype a bit thick.  Don't know what to think about that.

Around '06 everyone was into the Sieg X3.  Is it still awesome?  Grizzly seems to be selling a rebranded version of it.

Any opinions?  Thoughts?  The intended use is for my own robotics projects, so there will be a lot of aluminum, and some steel.  "	t5_2qkuc	True

I know what when I just freehand it I always weld it a tad obtuse first and it usually works.

Tramagust	1	1	0	"I have[ this torch from China](http://dx.com/p/honest-extra-large-butane-jet-workshop-torch-6824?item=3) that I bought just to have a quick and easy source of flame. It has 2 valves: one to control the air intake (on top) and one to control the butane gas intake on the side.

I know that in theory I should supply more air for more temperature but I'm not sure how this translates to a handheld torch. 

Sliding the airvalve all the way to the left gives me a nice blue jet flame. Does this mean the airvalve is open completely?

Sliding the airvalve all the way to the right gives me a yellowish regular lighter flame. Does this mean the airvalve is closed completely?

Sliding the gas valve just seems to increase and decrease the size of the flame.

I am left wondering what position the valves should have for maximum and minimum temperature. Can anyone offer some helpful information?"	t5_2qkuc	True

Three iPod minis; one hard drive failure, one battery shot, and one headphone board disconnected. Put two back together from the parts.
Anyways. Wanted to do something with the case. Decided to polish it to a mirror finish. Well, thats the idea.

Ive sanded off the anodised aluminium colour off, sanded the bare aluminium, up to 2000 grade sandpaper, and probably given myself alu. poisoning in the process.

I cant get any closer to that elusive mirror finish though. My local hardware store doesnt have any specific alu. polish (the netherlands). Silver polish doesnt seem to work great; takes off alot of material. Have another chrome polish, doesnt seem to do anything.

Any help, tips, for polishing aluminium? Drill-powered buffing pads helpful for this kinda thing?"	t5_2qkuc	True

I have a CAD program (Autodesk 123d) and I'm trying to make a metal yoyo.


Yoyos have changed considerably in the past few years. The wooden toys you guys might remember have changed into high precision, CNC machined (On a lathe), expensive novelty toys that go anywhere from $50 to $250. They are usually made from Aluminum (6061 and 7075) and also Titanium. 

The project I have been working on is pretty simple:

1.Use CAD and design a yoyo.
2.Go to a local machinist and have him/her make me a run of about 50-100 yoyos
3.Have them anodized by an anodizer.
4.Sell them to other hobbyists.

Although price varies, I'm aiming for a $100-$150 selling price. I'm most likely going to use 6061 aluminum. Machining tolerances have to be pretty high (0.003mm or maybe a bit less.) 

The outer diameter of this yoyo will be anywhere from 50mm to 56mm, which means I'll be using a bar of solid aluminum with a diameter of 2.5 inches to machine this.
The weight will be 64-68grams.

The yoyos are machined one half at a time. Therefore, one yoyo consists of 2 halves, an axle (Usually a grub screw),and a bearing. 


This is where the question comes in. 

I am aware that lots of factors can change the price, and I need an official quote, but how money would it cost to have it machined? Let's say that I'm going for a run of 100 yoyos, so that's 200 halves. I want it made on a lathe, and not a mill. I don't really care for anodization and other things, but I want just the price for machining+base price for the metal (6061 aluminum). I just want a ballpark estimate of how much that would cost before I go out and bug my local machinist. Tell me what other factors I need to include if needed. Thanks!

It needs to hold about 300 - 350 pounds, preferable have felt or something like that on the bottom so as to not harm the ceramic tile it will sit on.

Added bonus: I would **love** for the top to be able to swing out about 45 - 90 degrees, if that is at all possible.

I am trying to figure out approximately how much something like this would cost. Basic black square metal bars would be perfect as the thing it is holding is just black metal as well.

I have absolutely no tools at home for metal working, so buying it from someone makes much more sense to me.

I live in the Philadelphia area and buying local so I can pick it up and buy you a beer would be preferable, but not mandatory."	t5_2qkuc	True
