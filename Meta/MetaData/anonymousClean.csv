politics"	sobermonkey	226	15	14	"It's nice to see people are finally paying attention to H.R. 3523, otherwise known (now) as CISPA -- but a sequel to SOPA this is not. 

CISPA represents the merger of the NSA and corporate America, and had you been reading The Raw Story back on March 7, you would know this.

(For reference: I'm a journalist who wrote this story last month -- http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/03/07/bill-would-create-partnership-between-nsa-and-u-s-corporations/ -- and this story today -- http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/05/sequel-to-sopa-would-see-nsa-spy-on-journalists-media-pirates/ -- along with the story that hit Reddit's #1 spot last week about the former Colombian president sounding off on America's drug war.)

Make no bones about it, CISPA is part of a bigger cyber-security plan being orchestrated by the ""too big to fail"" technology companies, who all want the NSA to be their bodyguard, essentially. Now that it includes gathering intelligence on copyright infringement, that means Americans will be lumped in with NSA's spying activities if CISPA is passed. 

Another key note: You should not expect to get the big outcry on this one like with SOPA. CISPA is supported by the following companies: http://intelligence.house.gov/bill/cyber-intelligence-sharing-and-protection-act-2011

So, you're already massively behind the game on this one, Reddit. If this troubles you, the time to get working against it is yesterday (the bill was proposed in NOVEMBER), but it's still not too late.

That is all. 

(TL;DR -- CISPA merges the NSA with corporate America, which is kinda freaky.) "	t5_2qhw1	True

I want every living human to be able to wake up without fear.

Without the fear of censorship, or government retaliation for views.

Without the fear that the government is going to swoop you up in the middle of the night.

Without the fear of spilling your blood, sweat, and tears against your will.

Without the fear of backlash of outside parties because of the actions of your government.

Without the fear of citizen spying.

Without the fear of being hypnotized.

Without the fear of forced to live a live a life full of false ideologies. 

Without the fear of being controlled by paper.

Without the fear of being beaten by those who are there to protect me.

Without the fear of a golden nametag giving you precedence over any other human.

This is only why I personal support the very first world revolution, because I am afraid and it the feeling I share with people from every part of the globe.

I fight for the tribesman of Africa, for the Greeks , for the blind folded people of China, for the women all over the world, and for the children of this world who are luckily too naive to see that their future is at stake.

As long as your heart beats, you are my brother and I will die to protect my family.

The software is [here](http://www.bbvforums.org/forums/messages/7659/82111.html).  

You will note that this company was the one that given $2M by Florida to [purge voters](http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&amp;itemid=689) prior to 2004 election.

Many states paid them millions of dollars for [faulty software](http://www.big4.com/news/voting-with-their-feet-accenture-struggles-with-the-electoral-market/) and dropped [them](http://www.wisdc.org/wdcaccenture.php).

DHS has given this company $18 billion to manage INS lists.  And the Dept of Defense has contracted with Accenture [to develop the overseas military voter internet voting](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/08/business/technology-briefing-software-accenture-to-develop-voting-system.html).

This company also avoids paying taxes by [hiding it's offices offshore](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124338175183056465.html) and did so in the [past for the billions given by DHS](http://www.forbes.com/2004/06/10/cx_da_0610topnews.html).

They are currently purging voters in FL and TN.

Please take a look at the code.

TL;DR = A group of neocon Zionists (no exaggeration) came over to reddit after getting banned from Digg where for years they defended Bush and the wars and attacked anyone not toeing their line. Now they operate a fervently dedicated anti-Ron Paul campaign here as well as spew disgusting hatred, bigotry, lies and pro-war pro-Israel propaganda.

""crackduck"" wraps this one up nicely: 

&gt; I'd like to point out that everyone from Digg seems to have known and still knows that these people are ""neocons, pro-Israel, pro-war"". I never used Digg and I find it noteworthy that nearly everyone I've encountered from there knows about their antics. 

&gt;They did not try and downplay it there like they do here. In fact they didn't try here either until they created r/EnoughPaulSpam . They are desperate to keep it quiet here on reddit because most of their fellow anti-Paul devotees (and by-proxy vote brigade) are DNC/Obama supporters, are not pro-war (so they want to believe anyway), and do not unconditionally support Israel.

What are we dealing with here? Good question, but follow these clues and make up your own mind.
They are very concerned with hampering Ron Paul or anything libertarian, they work unilaterally across
sites and this is not the first time they are caught doing this.

&gt;Over 75% of the funding for American Majority, which hosted this training session, comes from the Sam Adams Alliance(12). In 2008, the year in which American Majority was founded, 88% of the alliance’s money came from a single donation, of $3.7m(13). A group which trains rightwing libertarians to distort online democratic processes, in other words, was set up with funding from a person or company with a very large wallet.

Like other advocates, astroturfers attempt to manipulate public opinion by both overt (outreach awareness, etc.) and covert (disinformation) means. Astroturfing may be undertaken by an individual promoting a personal agenda, or by organized professional groups for pay, or by activist organizations. Services may be provided by political consultants who also provide opposition research and other services. Beneficiaries are not the campaigners but the organizations that orchestrate the campaigns.

r/anonymous is compromised, at least ethically. There are certain people who are getting very sloppy right now and its beginning to show, ad hominem attacks is futile at this point. This is an organized group who are very distinct and they have been kicked out of communities like Digg for creating chaos and spreading some kind of incoherent propaganda, do your own research and don't listen to the barrage of bullshit, this is their main weapon. The most dangerous thing here is the fact that many reddits might be compromised modwise. Would you accept Reddit being politically filtered to fit the views of one extreme group? Say Israel apologists?

After [my link was removed](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/qsgbk/reddit_i_would_like_to_bring_something_very/) from OWS during their hiatus, I get this message from a bot, /u/ModsAreKillingReddit, and then i was introduced
to http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/
 
 If this individual or individuals is so concerned with politics, they can also disclose who they are and post proof. There are certain issues that should be raised, some are more serious than others. But this is the kind that will sweet talk anyone to be a mod, and bury you if you dare shed light on them.

I will resist the urge to go on a massive investigation and make a thesis out of this, but that is exactly what I think this needs. This is their main tactic, bogging you down in bullshit. Any attempt at putting me in a box with leftists, fascists,  david icke, conspiratards, ron paul supporters etc will be dragged out in the forest, left there to die alone, and become useful again as compost. The vitriol they spew should be enough of an indicator as to where they stand.

But this issue is much broader than Reddit, and reddits like this will become more relevant in light of recent events:

For such a jolly bunch of motherfuckers, they seem to anger a lot of people not only on reddit.  And its hard to wash off the feeling of being talked to out of the same sphincter, its the same banter all the time.

Recent debacle on Reddit that started with Laurelai, resulting in many things coming to light:

""The FBI turned a computer hacker to build its case against a group of people it alleges are responsible for a string of audacious attacks that captured the personal details of more than one million people."" : http://thehackernews.com/2012/03/fbi-actually-leak-stratfor-e-mails-just.html

Confirmed. OWS moderator Laurelei is an FBI rat, directly named in this Ars Technica article about LulzSec: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/the-hbgary-saga-nears-its-end.ars

To Laurelai:  

&gt;So the trolls were added by 'nebula42' just to piss you off? Am I reading this right?

Response:

&gt; She sometimes acts rashly. Like I said she is a good person who is going through a bad time, honestly we both are. One of her close IRL friends is speaking to her about this either tonight or tomorrow. I haven't even been able to get a hold of jart for a week due to irl stuff shes got going on.

It would be fun to apply different levels of heuristics to these profiles and see what comes out. Whatever the reason or outcome, I just hope my words will bring an important issue to light. This is a threat that shuns the light, and it is neutralized through exposure. That is my only sentiment in this case, and nothing else.

And you know what happens when you expose trolls to the light of truth, I will end on this note. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKG07305CBs&amp;fmt=18

The copyright alert system is a graduated response framework agreed upon by participating ISPs and Intellectual property organizations in which a third-party will monitor file-sharing networks, collect the IP-addresses of suspected copyright infringement, and submit the IP-address to ISPs who will in turn issue the suspected infringer a copyright alert.[1] Those suspected of copyright infringement may be issued six copyright alerts, one for each subsequent infringement.[2] Consumers who fail to respond to the alerts may have their connection throttled, though their account may not be terminated.[3]

These rules are not set in stone, but draw from a good deal of knowledge on the FBI's history online.

Though many believe that the FBI is technologically adept, MOST of their arrests are the result of subpoenas, financial trails and human intelligence. Some of the following may seem like common sense, but I feel like it's still good to have it written down and acknowledged.

*If this makes you Paranoid:* Good. But you need to realize that the only information that they can get on you is the information you put out there. Restrict the available information and it doesn't matter if every single person you deal with is law enforcement.


---------------

You can break up most investigations into a few stages

1)Initial Identification of Low Hanging Fruit

2)Identification of Leaders

3)Infiltration/Identity Takeover

--------------------------------------------

**Step 1: Initial Identification/Low Hanging Fruit**

This is what we've already seen with the identification of members participating in the DDOS attacks, and the identification/contact of lower echelon LulzSec members. These are generally somewhat peaceful meetings. Unless they are looking to send a message(as they are with SOME of the DDOS people), they want information more than arrests.

From these people they're looking for others higher up the chain. More than that, they want logs and internal information. They will likely be mostly interested in things like chat logs that reference pastebin posts, search engine searches, information on others VPNs or cell phone numbers. The point is that things like PasteBin(or HideMyAss, as lulzsec found out) are where people get lazy. People frequently abandon their anonymity measures when searching the internet or posting to pastebin. Even if you're just sending the link to someone privately, be aware that it may spread past them and for that reason it's worth maintaining security measures.

All they need is a URL the person accessed and a timestamp, and then they move up the chain....which brings us to Step #2.

Example #1: HideMyAss was leaked in chat logs(human intelligence) as the VPN of choice for certain lulzsec members. HideMyAss tells us that they then received a subpoena for the information.

Example #2: The ""top 1000"" list of IPs attacking Paypal was in part an effort to simply identify low-end members that *may* lead to high end members. The rest of it was sending a message so they don't look impotent.



----------------------------------

**Step 2: Leader Identification/Arrest**

Using the information acquired from Step #1, they move on to the leaders. Most leaders they can identify will be arrested. The ones that aren't arrested will be the most useful of them - IRC server owners, message board operators, etc. While we are sad for the arrests, it's the others that are worrisome to us. For high-level offenders, an additional risk is the close-knit relationships many have. Things like cell phone numbers are shared(and indeed were with some members of lulzsec) that can make a clear trail leading back to the user.

But once they have a few of the top guys(or worse yet infrastructure guys) in custody/contact, the real shit begins.

-----------------------------------------------


**Step 3: Infiltration/Identity Takeover**

The point of this step is the dissolution of a community - reducing it to a distrusting mob that scatters into the internet.

A common FBI tactic is creating a centralized location for their targets to gather - this can be a forum, chat room, or anything else. This is frequently done by using the identities and reputations of people already within the community. Watch out for people who disappear for a period of time, then come back with little explanation. Also be wary of any community gathering location that seems to have lasted an extraordinarily long time. 


These are not people/things we should outright avoid on the basis that they *may* be FBI - doing so just creates ""COINTELPRO"" style infighting. Instead, keep your wits about you, keep your anonymity measures up, and avoiding giving those in high ranking positions information to identify you. Keep in mind that if they run a chat room or a message board, all of your ""private"" messages are available to the server owner.

Example #1: ShadowCrew - This community trusted a single VPN provider nicknamed CumbaJohnny. CumbaJohnny was arrested, but was allowed to continue operating as an FBI informant. When the ""raid day"" came, nearly every high level user of his service in a cooperative jurisdiction was arrested(28 known). This would not have happened had the community avoided centralization, which gives the FBI a strong attack vector.

Example #2: TheGrifters - After the takedown of ShadowCrew, the FBI used one of their arrestees (El Mariachi) to found a forum called thegrifters. This forum was entirely about credit card fraud, and was authorized to run by the FBI. They had access to every PM, every server log, and every user's account information.

Example #3: DarkMarket - a carding/identity theft forum that existed years ago. In this case, the entire forum was an FBI sting. The FBI assumed the identity of a Polish spammer nicknamed [Master Splynter](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/10/darkmarket-post/) who existed prior to DarkMarket as a non FBI agent. This user's identity was also used as an ""in"" into the spammer and malware communities.


----------------------------------------------


**So How the Fuck do We Avoid All of This?**

Avoiding these tactics is incredibly difficult if you wish to maintain an effective community. A downgrade into paranoia was the entire point of the early COINTELPRO operations against protesters and radicals in the 1960s. This must be avoided, and can be simply.

First, you need to think to yourself ""Am I a priority target?""

**In General**

* Just because someone has access to a nickname or a twitter account doesn't mean it's that person.

* Those considered ""trustworthy"" by the community are in a way less trustworthy simply because they're targets. Don't avoid talking to them, but don't give them anything you wouldn't post to the open internet. Not having leaders is a strength because it's harder to infiltrate. Don't sacrifice this strength because you get starstruck talking to someone who is well known.

* Don't give your fucking cell phone number to anyone. Ever.

**If you are NOT a High-Priority Target**

* The goal here is not being the lowest hanging fruit. For most problems in this arena, the solution is TOR. It's not perfect, but it's a big enough pain in the ass that you'll be safe in most if not al cases.

* Don't sign up for anything with a real e-mail address.... Register one using tor. Then register on the forums using tor. Post to Twitter using Tor.

* If you're going into the IRC channels, find a web IRC website. There's lots of them. Visit it using tor. The IP address the IRC server(the high risk server) sees will be that of the website. The website meanwhile will see the TOR IP in their logs if they're subpoenaed. Avoid clients that use Java applets if at all possible. 

* If you're posting a link to ANYTHING (google results, pastebin, etc) do not execute the search from your home connection if at all possible. Yet again: Tor.

**If you ARE a high-priority Target**

* If you are leaking information, you don't have to say how it was gotten. If it was an attack, keep the method quiet. If you work there, STFU about it.

* Use prepaid credit cards. Buy them at the gas station with cash or get a trustworthy friend to. These can be traced to a sale location, so the further away from your house the better. Use these for any services you may need. The specialty of law enforcement is financial trails. Don't give them the beginning of one or they'll tear you apart.

* Setup your own VPN, or have another computer(hacked, open wi-fi, or TOR) in between you and the server you're connecting to if possible. If possible, it's also good to have the VPN/proxy on your server sending OUTBOUND connections through another middleman. Is it a pain in the ass? Yeah. Deal with it. Oh yeah, and turn off logging. If you're going to use a commercial VPN service it's HIGHLY recommended you have this server sitting in-between.

* Don't give your fucking cell phone number to anyone. Ever.

* Don't host anything on a domain that you've used for anything else. Buy a new domain with a prepaid, use fake information. Same goes for the server.

* If you're running a server(for a VPN or otherwise), re-host frequently, and vary the countries you're hosted in. The US and UK are bad bets. Remember that it doesn't matter how secure the server is if the FBI can have feet on the ground there.

* International bureaucracy is your friend. The internet allows us to shift jurisdictions quickly...often faster than paperwork can follow. Make it happen.

* Be aware that the FBI can *use* illegally obtained information as long as they're not the ones who did it. Other hacker groups can do whatever the want and forward the information and there's nothing you can do about it.

* Do not probe a server or visit a website from your home connection if you're planning on attacking. You want to be NOWHERE in those logs, even if the visit itself seems innocent.


----------------------

Final Note: When using tor keep in mind the data can be decoded at the exit point. They won't know who sent it, but they'll know what it is. The first node(the one you connect to) will know who you are but not what you're sending. So keep identifiable information going over TOR to a minimum.

Back story: I live in a college town, and since school started in the fall some good soul has been hanging up Anonymous/Occupy posters. They're on just about every light post downtown, and change every few weeks.

Anyways, I was walking back to my apartment, which is next to an intersection with poster about the May Day strike on each corner. When I was getting close, I noticed two middle-aged women standing and looking at one of the posters. The light turned green, and I crossed a little behind them, close enough to hear them talking. One was asking questions about us, and the other was telling her about what Anonymous believes; knowledge is free, the government is held accountable by the people, that sort of thing. I was floored. Here were two women who had grown up without the internet, who had probably never heard of reddit or 4chan, and yet one of them knew of us, what we stand for, what we do. And even more importantly, she was spreading the word.

1334771935.0	sgcn1	POLICY NOTICE: On the subject of FBI, Laurelai, Illegality, and Paranoia	FVAnon	91	26	128	"So we’ve seen a few wonderful dramaful threads lately where people point fingers at whoever they think is a secret undercover fed that day. The purpose of this post is to clarify the role of this subreddit and to issue an ‘official’ subreddit policy statement on the issue of potential illegal activity and its consequences.

Let me preface by saying that I have not seen any pattern or evidence of illegal activity on this subreddit for as long as I’ve been here, and that this policy notice is in regards to hypothetical scenarios that some jumpy people expressed concern over.

-------------------------------
**First things first: POLICY NOTICE**
-------------------------------
**Illegal material of any caliber is not welcome in this subreddit.** This includes links to pirated content. This includes planning and execution of illegal operations. This also includes obvious ‘grey area’ information such as links to DDoS programs and instructions on how to operate them. This also includes **asking** for instruction on illegal activities. 

**This is a zero tolerance policy.** First offense will result in a permanent ban, and removal of the offending post. And all “removals” are soft removals. This means that the posts you make will still exist in the history right next to your IP and will NOT be erased from reddit. Reddit admins will not fight your subpoena. Neither will the admins of this subreddit lift a single finger to cover your ass if you do engage in or admit to illegal activity here.

-------------------------------

With that out of the way, I would like to remind everyone that Anonymous does not equate to crime. Anonymous is not illegal. *Being* Anonymous is not illegal. Even *freely associating* with the Anonymous name is not illegal. Contrary to a lot of scare talk around these parts, Anonymous has *never* been declared a ‘terrorist group’. There are tons of perfectly legal Anonymous operations and cells. I know this, I’ve been heavily involved in one such cell for four and a half years. Equating Anonymous with crime is not completely honest. In fact, it is dishonest. Sure there are a lot of people acting under the Anonymous flag who are being arrested. But please remember, these people are not being arrested for being Anonymous. They are being arrested for doing illegal shit. Such as hacking. Such as DDoS. Such as running botnets. You know, actual crime. 

Anyway, I know why you came to this thread. You want the answer to this one question.

**Is Laurelai a sekrit FBI spy?!?!**

Well, I am about to give you the true, honest answer. Here it comes. You ready for this?

*It does not matter at all.* If you are scared of the police, feel free to assume that we are all secret agents, if that makes you feel better. It’s a safe assumption. Because this is a public forum. Anybody can see it. If law enforcement wants to see whatever dumb shit you posted, they will simply type in the URL into the browser and see it plain as day. There is no privacy here, and you should have no expectation of privacy here.

Feel free to use this as the designated thread for discussion of all of the concerns addressed above, so we don't have to have a new one every two weeks.

TL;DR: Relax and don’t be an idiot."	t5_2qhw1	True

The above links only serves to show that anonymous is not immune to infiltration. And my point is that it doesnt have to be government infiltrators. But just ordinary people with their own selfish motives that can corrupt and corrode things from the inside by being completely incompetent.

What's the best way to go completely anonymous while surfing the web and also keeping torrents from being traced back? I have a couple tools on my computer already, such as Tor and Hotspot Shield. I have heard of people complaining because they were still traced even when using Tor, though. They were probably doing something highly illegal but still I don't like the fact that it's still easily traceable by the authorities. 

So is there a better way(and free) to pull off total anonymity online? Links to online tutorials would also be very appreciated. I don't do anything that's highly illegal, I just am a bit paranoid and would sleep easier knowing I have the tools and knowledge to go completely off the grid when online if I needed to.

1329923574.0	q0yrv	So uh, what are you guys doing to prepare for the oncoming shitstorm?	Fluffytapehiss	84	23	47	"1. You've got your NSA and chums talking about a cyberwar of whitehat spies vs manchild romanticists, which is obviously a precursor to organized conflict.

2. Everyone over 30 thinks you're terrorists due to our lovely MSM... that brings along with it the mentality that got us muslim-hatin' in the first place (trillions of dollars and freedom-intruding-regulations later)

3. You've got rogue teenagers stealing information, taking it out of context and sensationalizing it worse than a Fox report about black people. This resulted in incriminating a perfectly innocent cop - seemingly very akin to the actions taken by our own government.

Before you downvote, please realize this is not just aggressive criticism. These are constructive talking points that I really think your movement should consider. Unfortunately in the real world, a good offense is not always a great defense.

For many of us in this election cycle, the option to exercise our vote seems little more than a vacant gesture in and of itself. Perhaps you don't see a point in voting for either candidate, given the hold that special interests still practice on our government. Perhaps you recognize the insanity of relying on easily tampered-with voting machines, or are disgusted by the prevalence of voter suppression, fraud or other methods of disenfranchising the electorate that have become staples of the political process. Perhaps you are angry over the opening of the floodgates holding back corporate, possibly foreign money from buying the oval office. 

Perhaps, like me, you've simply lost faith in the process, in the system, and in the office itself. 

Many of us will not vote this cycle. Some out of apathy, some out of anger, some out of despair. It's to those of you who feel there is no point in voting that I suggest using the vote provided to you as a U.S. citizen to send a message this election, that our representatives are only necessary so long as they *represent the citizens*.

In short, vote for the citizens. Vote for everyone. Anonymous 2012. 


To those who still have faith in the process, or who honestly believe one candidate is better for the country than the other, please vote as your conscience dictates. The reality is that voting Anonymous won't change anything, nor is it meant to. The system in place is sick to the roots, and as long as money rules our elections, the system won't change from within. 

But for those of us who see no point in participating in the system as it stands, at least there's a chance to use the rights we're afforded to speak our conscience."	t5_2qhw1	True

But in the meantime, there's a few things that I want everyone here to remember, as anon is not without some chinks in it's armor:

1) Your IRC chats are monitored. If you run one, *do not* ban TOR from coming into the chat. Really, TOR(and VPNs) should be almost the only thing logging into the chats. Web-based IRC is not a substitute for TOR or a proper VPN, but *can* be used in addition to either.

2) Any URL you paste into an IRC chat, assume that law enforcement will be trying to get logs from that domain. Do not visit it with your real IPs. This goes for PasteBin as well.

3) Do not host a chatroom or anything an anon is logging into from the country that is being attacked.

4) A country like the Netherlands identifying an entire sect's leadership means something went really fucking wrong. Them identifying so many people suggests there was a systemic problem in how they operated, not individual slip-ups.

5) If you're part of a smaller clique or mission use [WASTE](http://waste.sourceforge.net), not IRC. ([Moar info here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASTE))

&gt;Who exactly did what in the HBGary hack remains unclear. The hack had several stages: the initial break-in, the theft of the e-mails, and then the destruction of Hoglund's server. Publicly, the hacking of Hoglund's server was the work of a ""16 year-old girl,"" with Kayla habitually claiming to be a female teenager. **In chatlogs leaked by Wesley ""Laurelai"" Bailey** and published by Backtrace Security (the group that successfully named Sabu months before he was arrested), however, Sabu claimed responsibility for the entire attack.

...but then there's [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/qnc24/laurelai_gets_caught_abusing_her_mod_powers_in/c3zo8vp), part of [this apparently unrelated](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/qnc24/laurelai_gets_caught_abusing_her_mod_powers_in/) subreddit drama.

&gt;""Backtrace security is Asherah's and Laurelai's 'security' company.""&lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;No, it is not. It is my company, and Laurelai hates me more than anyone else on earth right now.

&gt;**Yes, Laurelai passed us information, with the intent of hurting Sabu. She(really a he) did not know who I was or what I was up to at the time.**

&gt;Most Anons don't like me, and I'm fine with that. I am not fine with being associated with anything Laurelai.
)




and then there's all [these comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/qtjws/confirmed_ows_moderator_laurelei_is_an_fbi_rat/) calling for his head.



you guys sure know how to brew up one hell of a shitstorm!

*(in fairness, I personally have had nothing but pleasant and respectful dealings with Laurelai in my time submitting things to this subreddit; this all comes as quite a surprise)*

***edit:*** What Laurelei is accused  of (alleged abuse of modpower aside for a moment) is betraying his cohort within the Anon 'movement', who was in turn recently outed as an informant himself. All of this was relevant to IRC and the twittersphere much moreso than here on reddit; very few if any AnonOps (or even OWS events) were/are ever planned on reddit itself. 

Because of this, I wonder just how interested the FBI would really be in reddit beyond checking for duplicate usernames from twitter/IRC and gathering background intel on certain people. (and then there's violentacrez and his penchant for shockporn, lol)  That said, only Lord Xenu knows what goes on in their minds or who gets misrepresented as something they aren't. One thing for me is certain, however: If you're doing something for personal name recognition then you're the opposite of  Anonymous.

1) Instead of taking down a site that no one looks at (CIA, NSA, etc) why not take down a site that people DO look at? Why not modify MTV to redirect to an Anonymous site that features a laughing Anon mask with the tagline ""Your government is about to attach a digital ankle monitor to your every move. Click here to learn more about CISPA.""

2) Fight fire with fire. Get every single lawmaker that voted in favor, then reveal 100% of every digital communication he or she has ever sent and received, and then post it online. Every affair, every N-word laden rant, every bribe scandal, etc. No more phone calls that go ignored, just career-ending scandal. Chances are quite a few of them have something in there that will destroy their career. Probably lots.

I just get tired of ""look how bad CISPA is. Let's organize a boycott!"" Without an internet-wide shutdown like with SOPA, nothing will happen. And since no internet shutdown is planned, it's just too late.

I think a combination of the above tactics would work quite well. But it's going to be too late soon."	t5_2qhw1	True

And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.

... No longer is your consent required.

1331869583.0	qywd5	Formal apology from the person who introduced r/Anonymous to the fake Anon-OS.	LadySerenity	62	13	20	"As the wise Admiral Akbar would say: IT'S A TRAAAAAP!

Let me start by saying... I'm not EVEN a script kiddie. I'm just a big fan of Anonymous and everything you guys stand for. 

I have a few ""friends"" who are associated with Anonymous. A few minutes after this article was posted (http://thehackernews.com/2012/03/anonymous-os-01-anonymous-hackers.html), one of them sent me a link to it. 

I thought it looked really cool, but had no interest in downloading it because I'd probably just be confused to death... I tried using John the Ripper once... My ADHD got the best of me before I ever got around to getting it running.

Something seemed fishy about the Anon-OS, but there were no comments at the time and I thought it could be legitimate. I wanted to be helpful, so I posted it here. Derp.

I am very sorry to anybody who actually downloaded it. I was informed that, unsurprisingly, it contains AT LEAST one trojan.

I don't belong here and again, I am so sorry.

**TL;DR:** The Anon-OS is bullshit. I have a ton of respect for Anonymous and I'm sorry for introducing it to you. Please don't hack me."	t5_2qhw1	True

1327440081.0	ov02o	The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I have changed my mind.	Hemms3	55	5	11	Back in the good old days of 09 and 10, I remember anonymous being little more than a few basement dwellers who had nothing better to do than troll. As a Furry, we went to war. But that was childsplay. We all were young and stupid and thought things mattered that didn't. Since then I have been venomously against anonymous. I have opposed and fought against everything you stood for... untill you actually stood for something. Anonymous seems to have found a purpose and a goal. The invincible shield between the forboding establishment and the working man. With the takedown of megaupload, and anonymous's subsequent rebellion, I have changed my mind. You are all heroes. Every single one. You are a shadow that extends over all of society. A nameless, faceless shadow that common sense tells I should be terrified of. But there is no name behind you. No corporate backing, no money other than in the working mans pocket. I feel...safer knowing that there are those out there who can take down the website of the justice department and get away with it. Who have the guts and the knowhow to play this game. In this age of sopa and pipa this is a war, and you are the warriors. If you are domestic terrorists for standing io for freedom and defence of the common man, then I must be a threat to society too just cause I dress up as a walking talking fox. I think its a damned shame we ever fought in the first place. Anyways. This is my letter to you. You are full of intelligent, capable, and remarkable people. And fearless. You are all fearless. If you loose in this fight for a free world, then thank God you do not forgive, and do not forget.	t5_2qhw1	True
